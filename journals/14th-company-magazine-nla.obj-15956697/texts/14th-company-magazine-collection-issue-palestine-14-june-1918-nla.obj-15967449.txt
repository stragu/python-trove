PERSONAL.
Monsieur le Captaine passed Monday
last in his E.P. tent.
He recived young Kenny at OQOO, and
spoke to him about overstaying leave.
Pte. Kenny passed Sunday in Ismailia.
He did not attend prayers.
Young Conlon (Lance-Jack, one) spent
a couple of days in Cairo ?Lots of rations
to spare while he was away. Since he
has returned the surplus has greatly
diminished.
Young Conlon (Lance-Jack, one) ex-
pressed his satisfaction with Cairo general-
ly, and spoke unto the shop-blokes, and
to the railway porters and to the boot-
blax.
After washing and mange-dressing the
camels the boys of Fourteen Company
passed an hour at prayer?in the Mess
hut. 'T really, of course, was a compul-
sory parade ?but not likely?we are tel-
ling you that.

HYMN OF HATE TO MY CAMEL.
You splaw-footed cow,
You humpty-backed freak !
Listen here now,
You lop-sided streak!!!
With ticks on your hide,
As thick as the sand,
And there to abide,
Till picked off by hand.
Washing and grooming
Your misshapen frame,
Scraping and greasing?
Oh, who can we blame ?
My back-bone is bent,
My pains are all hidden.
The Lord never meant
You to be ridden.
Splutter, spit at me,
And blow out your bags,
But let me go free,
And back to the nags.

WINNING THE WAR I
When Australia heard ?bout the ?men-
dous tensive in Frarnz, New South sang
a National Hymn, Western Aussy said
it was determined to have a successful
victory, and so on?-ad infinitum. And all
of the other lickle states did some lickle
thing, save Victoria.
Course Victoria always was a Nark. . .
Now if we could only persuade old Vic.
to sing ?Yankee Doodle? ?or any old
ditty, so long as it showed it were like
Barkis ?and ?willin?? ?we might be home
by Xmas. . . . Who knows ?
A certain Person, who visits this Com-
pany, was asked if he?d read the French
translation of Omar Khayyam.
O yes ! he loved Omar Khayyam :
? And very nice too ! ? I warmed !
? Who?s it by ? ? said he.
You know I felt my sides going?lt
couldn?t have been good for me It
must have killed most people.

S gt J. KERMODE M.M.
Our society reporter was fortunate in
obtaining an interview with Sgt. Kermode.
He found him modestly reticent; clothed
becomingly in shorts and sox. A
welcoming smile ! Passed the bottle a
few times. Accused voluntarily gave
the following information after being
duly warned.
The Sergeant was born in S. Australia,
34 years ago, coming June twelve months,
on a hen ranch, 10 miles out of Adelaide
(presumably North of Adelaide).
There is a violet farm next to his old
home. He is the only member of his
family without a �] 000 Insurance Policy...
or in fact without any sort of policy !
Sgt. Kermode thinks he won his D.C.M.
and M.M. at the second Gaza show, hold-
ing the Turks at bay with his machine
gun, which he bandied with commendable
professional stolidity during our retire-
ment (Ed.?-I understand on this occa-
sion he also volunteered to go out and
bring in the damaged tank).
He has two brothers in France. An
ardent admirer of Charles Chaplin (of
whom you have heard).
Sgt. Kermode was on Gallipoli (not
that that's anything) and was a total
abstainer till he was 12. However he
smoked like a Tudor Chimney at the age
of seven.
He has never been married or wounded.
Sergeant Kermode is one of those few
Australians who has not written a book.
Asked if he intended writing a book he
replied, ...... lots .... of lime yet! And
not to make the pace too warm !
In conclusion we might say Sergeant
Kermode, J., D.C.M., M.M., is alright, if
you take him the right way.

LANCE JAX, WICKEDNESS OF.
Now these are the names of the camels
of the 14th, which came into Palestine.
Every man and his camel-~-came with
Captain Tolma.
(2) Stinker and Suzanna and
Walker's Whisky and
(3) Modesty and Brother Bell and
Denzil and
(4) Bullocky and So So and
Backsheesh and Five Hundred.
(5) And all the camels that came
out of Palestine were not. And Captain
Tolma?nor was he. For he was in Egypt
already. (Authority vi.8.2 A 76 B).
(6) And all the Bickeneers died, and
all their brethren of 15 Coy ; and all
that generation.
(7) Till at last Fourteen were issued
with Camels, bint for men's use of, and it
came to pass, the camels were fruitful
and increased abundantly and multiplied
and waxed exceeding mangy and hungry
and all the rest of it!
(8) Now there arose a new Lance
Jack ?who knew not the ways of camels,
nor of mange-dressing, nor of tibben, nor
of dhoura, nor of ticks, nor dandy-
brushes, nor tooth-brushes, nor Sweet
Fanny Adams ! And he said unto his
Line-guard ?Behold the camels upon the
lines are more and mightier than we ;
come on, let us deal wisely with them,
lest they multiply, and it come to pass
their new-borns develop mange so that
we shall be short of this dressing for our
mounts, so that we shall not have enough
of the tooth brush to cleanse their teeth,
nor of dhoura for them to devour, nor
enough ticks to go 'round. Thus he
addressed them.
(9) And he said : When ye do the
office of Line-guard to a Camel, and see
her upon the stool, if the young camel
has 24 hours' rations, a tin of mange
dressing, ticks, and dandy-brush, then ye
shall save it.
(10) But if the young camel has not
24 hours' rations,a tin of mange dressing,
ticks, and dandy-brush, then thou shalt
slay it.
(11) But the Line-guard feared the
O.C. and did not as the Lance Jack com-
manded them but saved the non-equipped
camels alive ?in their sleeping huts,
under their pillows, and any-old-where.
(12) And the Lance Jack called on
the Line-guard and said : Why have ye
done this thing, and have saved the non-
equipped camels alive? And the Line-
guard said unto the Lance Jack, Because
they have come in to this world fully
equipped. And they, each of them (or
all of them) showed unto him the full
equipments. Wherewith he waxed sore
and said : 1 will be bound these are the
long lost brushes of my section men.
Well, I never! And he charged them
with ?Missapplying"? -2125?2069s ?and
all that sort of thing.
Therefore. the Colonel dealt
lightly with the Line-guard ; and the
camels multiplied and waxed very mangy.
And the Colonel charged all his thing-a-
me-jigs saying : Every camel that is born
you will save alive. And it was so !
And even unto this day, Fourteen
Company saves, .all. .their nevr-born
camels alive.

OLD STIGGLEDY WICKS AN? ME.
My walking stick and I have had little
experience with nurses. But my walking-
stick assured me on one occasion I?d met
a very nice nurse. She had blue eyes
and a jolly nose?and showed me thro?
her ward, once, when I went to see a
patient, who had stopped a piece of
shrapnel. She was nice; really tho? !
You?ve no idea !
One might say different walking sticks,
different customs. Might not one now ?
One cannot prevent one?s walking stick
associating with others, in Cairo restau-
rants, these times; so my silly old
walking stick starts skiting to all the
other walking sticks, ? My skipper has a
nice nurse. She has blue eyes and a jolly
nose?and showed him thro? her ward,
once, when he went to see a patient who
had stopped, a piece of shrapnel! ?
All the Privates? walking-sticks shook
the room with laughter?so that all the
Louis XIV mirrors shook?and all the
girls held on to the edges of their tables
with their left hands ?and held on to the
edges of their hats wif their other
hands?which ever they might be.
Then one stick, as in the case of ?I?ll
be your sweetheart?if you will be
mine? ?answered in this refrain! . . . .
? My skipper is only a Private?he was
admitted to hospital; they took ail his
clo?es from him. Allowed me to stay
with him. I was glad i Awfully musty
smell in the kit stores. I should have
smothered. I know I should 1 He, too,
met a nice nurse. A norfid nice nurse-
jolly nurse! You understand? Fell in
love with her. Boys all knew ?bout it.
Swank?and swish?no name for it! He
was transparently proud of his new bint!??
? Nice music ! ? another stick gurgled.
The other sticks observed, that it was
nice music, and that that was really ail
they had come for?the music. Silence
followed.
When the orchestra .had finished and
packed its music and instruments and
gone upstairs to make noises to the hun-
gry ivy attitudinizing, before circular,
marble-topped tables ?my walking stick
broke the silence. ?My skipper has a
nice nurse ?blue eyes and a jolly nose-
showed him thro? her ward, once, when
he went to see a patient, who had stopped
a piece of shrapnel This reminded
the Private stick, and in a tone of some
asperity, told the other walking stick not
to be silly, and, like Brutus, paused for a
reply ; but, as none was forthcoming,
continued ? When my skipper was
discharged from Hossy he wrote to his
nurse such a swe-heet little letter 'Dar-
ling?, y?know, and all that! 'Honey? and
'Sweet?, 'Love and squeezes?.
How he paused for a reply ! Till at last
one day :
'Private Binks,
If I hear another word from you
I?ll report you, to your G.C.
?Sister Suzan.??
Ugh! ! The world was full of
brown leaves eddying, rustling, scurrying
all over a flower!ess world. (Further
particulars See Adams? or Wells? or
Frank Reid?s, and them ).
Another stick beamed rather spite-
fully ?? O tempora ! O mores ! Into
what moral flaccidity might your skipper
be weakening?er !?
Another, more sympathetically ; ?and
as in the case of ?The longest way round
is the sweetest way home ???whispered
this : ? She would probably be the type
of nurse who makes lemon-drinks for her
patients?and squeezes the remainder of
the lemon on her hands ?to staye them
whyte! ?
All the other sticks indulged in laughter
of careless irresponsibility, and of
thoughtless debauchery ?and replied that
probably she would.
Another stick, as in the case of??Don?t
take me home ? struggled and then
replied ?? She?d be the kind of cat Louis
Wain would have made the villain of the
piece ? ?and they broke into laughter
once more.


THE EDIFICE ERECTED BY JOHN.
This is the Farmer sowing l his Scorn
From Zeebrugge to the Golden Horn.


And still another stick,-as in the case
of ? Never laugh at a man when he?s
down in the gutter? ?? She might have
her eye on some Officer Bloke?some paw
unfortunate* Officer Bloak ! ? And again
they laughed, like anythink ! And some-
think awful!
And still (or yet) another stick?as in
the case of?'? Old man Jan?what can
the matter be ?? smiling he replied,
? I bet her Dad walks on flower beds, and
that she goes late to theatres?and all
that.? At which all the other sticks
laughed heartily ?and swore by their
respective halydames they?d never heard
the like before, in all their lives or in the
history of walking sticks.
Then the orchestra came downstairs
again and seven very long-haired
Frenchmen got thro? some very whole-
some stuff in the way of Minor Chords ?
and Crescendos, and other sorts of things
they do with very long hair, violins,
pianos, and ?cellos, before a crowd of
music-lovers, attitudinizing before cir-
cular, marble-topped tables.
Then I went to my walking stick and
said ? Ole Stiggledy Wicks ? ( which I
knew pleased him) ?have I kept you
waiting ??
And away we went ?home ?wending
our way thro? the mysterious songs of the
mosquitoes whose very great grandads
must have stung Moses, and all them Pots.
Who knows exactly what such insects
( Hymenoptera family or Hemiptera or
somethink) might?just might?be a sing-

PROMOTIONS.
Some of us would never make good

We come on parade with holes burnt
in our tunics?and no puttees on our legs.
It is to be regretted that, after two or
three years service, we ( some of us ) get
tired and too lazy to keep ourselves clean.
Then we wonder why the new chaps,
just over, still smelling of their sea-
sickness, get all the promotions?But this

Palestine, X.Y.Z.
ON THE MOUNTAINS OF JUDEA.
The impression made on my mind by
travelling over the Mountains of Judea
is indelible. For, innocent as they were
of every modern convenience or comfort,
and the mountain scenery round about
being utterly devoid of any mark of
present-day civilisation, one?s mind in-
voluntarily slipped back a few thousand
years, and the tents, flocks, and herds
of Jacob and Esau, with their idyllic
patriarchal times, became suddenly vivid.
The Bible allusions to the habits of the
Ishmaelites are wounderfully carried out
in the lives of these tribes. The men
tend flocks and herds, and the women
tend the home, and are ? hewers of
wood? and ? drawers of water?. It is
wonderful how little these tribes re-
quire to live on ?their staple food being
barley or corn bread. A woman, Em
Hassan, we will say, would turn back
the long hanging points of her sleeves ?
about 3 ft. long each ?and tie the points
together behind her neck in order to
keep them out of her way. Then she
would shake out some dark flour from
a sheepskin bag into a basin, black from
months of usage without being washed,
pour on it a little water, in which a bit
of yeast had been mixed, from a cruse
or a goatskin bag, and start mixing. As
for her hands, washing them was always
superfluous. Then the lumpy dough,
scarcely kneaded, was flattened out into
a thick round cake; the daughter Fathma
made a fire, placed the girdle on it, and
the flat cake was laid on that to bake.
The result may be left to imagination. A
loaf is baked for every meal. The fact
that the women grind the barley or corn
themselves immediately reminds us of
the Biblical picture ??Two women shall
be grinding at a mill; one shall be taken
and the other left? ?for two women
always grind the corn together.
There are no vegetables to be had out
on the wilds of the Judean mountains. I
have often seen women walking to some
city miles distant, a baby slung in a sack


across each woman?s back, and a big
basket of dairy products balanced on
their heads. Then at evening they come
trudging home, the babies slung on their
backs, but the basket containing a few
vegetables, perhaps tomatoes, cucumbers
and onions, anything that does not
require cooking. It is marvellous what
great weights these women can carry on
their heads. Huge loads of wood or
enormous jars of water I have seen them
balance,unsupported by even a finger,just
as though they had no weight whatever.
The recipe for making Esau?s pottage
has been handed down through the
centuries to these present-day ?lsmaelites,?
and I have no doubt many a hungry
Bedouin has indulged in the really
delicious lentils, rice, and oil, after a day
spent in very similar pursuits to Esau?s.
Yet, after all, a piece of the above-des-
cribed black bread,an onion, and maybe a
little wild honey, would be an all-suffi-
cient meal to a shepherd Bedouin tending
his flocks out in the wilderness. Their
only beverage is coffee, which also is the
only luxury they indulge in at all frequent-
ly. It is considered a great delicacy, and,
as everywhere else in the East, it is
redundant with ceremonious meanings.
They have a quaint way of pulverising
the roasted beans; a copper or brass
mortar and a wooden pestle are used. As
the man lifts the pestle out of the mortar
after a blow, he strikes the sides rythmi-
cally and with lightning speed, making
beautiful bell-like music. The pestle is
manipulated somewhat in the way a
kettle-drum stick would be. So much
for the coffee. As far as tea is concerned,
they know nothing about it. A man was
ill with smallpox, and I went to see him
and made him a cup,of good strong tea
to revive his drooping spirits. He said it
was the nastiest medicine he had ever
tasted.
On my way to visit these tribes I con-
stantly rested at the wonderful Cave of
Adullam, situated about two hours? ride
from Bethlehem. Small wonder that
David could house about 600 men in there.
Everyone that was in distress and
everyone that was in debt, and everyone
that was discontented, gathered themselv-
es unto him. (l. Sam., xxxii. 1-2). It is
perfectly obvious also how Saul could
be asleep in the cave at the same
time that David was concealed there, and
that David could easily pass out unheard
after cutting ?Saul?s skirt off.? ( I- Sam.
xxiv. 4). Outside, round about the cave,
the numerous gullies mark where the
winter rains have swept down, so force-
fully that they carry away the tribes?
sheep and goats sometimes. Looking
away from the entrance of the Cave of
Adullam, David?s route as he fled over
into Moab is very visible. Over the
beautiful bushy ?hocks of the wild goats?
he must have tramped down into the
valley past Engedi (the ?fountain of the
kid?) and then across the Dead Sea, and
thus coming to Mizpah of Moab, for
safety from Saul. (l. Sam. xxii, 3.).

Your letter ?delicious. I would love one
of your photos. The cake ! The cake I

(h) Mister Reginald,

Els. I am engaged to a Captain ?(expect-

en the second finger).

(a) State exactly what 20th century
Emperor might most appropriately soli-
loquize in this manner.
(b) Whether it illustrates the dynamic
force of prayer. Give brief summary of
such Emperor?s prayers as they have
happened since 1914 (without appearing
too blasphemously).
(6) Think of a number ?take away 3
divide by two ?turn round three times ?
take half the number you first thought
of ?add to the present number ?serve

This should give you approximately
the century in which the war will end.
Prove this.
