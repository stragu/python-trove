Foreword.
by
Lt, Col. A. R. Wiltshire, M.C.,C.0.
22nd. Battalion.
It is not because our Battalion needs
advertising, that this Regimental paper
is being laimched. Deeds speak louder
than words and the deeds of the 22nd
Battalion through three years of hard
campaigning have already won it a
proud record of battle honors and a re-
putation for successful work that are
second to none in the Force.
It is thought that, for ourselves here
and for our friends and relatives at
home it would be of interest to have a
regular chronicle of our daily doings on
active service at the Front.
Most little townships support a local
newspaper,or perhaps two, and here in
this community of ours with a 'populat-
ion' never much below 1000 in strength,
there is always enough of interest
happening to keep a printer busy.
So let everyone do his bit towards
making the "Twenty Second's Echo" a
journal worthy of the Battalion and a
true record of all its doings -the shifts
and changes, the ups and downs and all
the things that go to make up the daily
life of the wearers of those good old
colours- Red and Purple.
DONATIONS.
We are much indebted to Messrs.
John Haddon and Co. of Fleet Street
London for their advice and assistance
in connection with the starting of this
paper and to Mr. Walter Haddon for
his very generous gift of the printing
press which is being used in its
production.
The sum of �ioohas been generously
donated to the Regimental Funds by
Mrs. Craig wife of Major Craig D.S.O.
late Medical Officer of this Battalion.

A Billet Way Back.
(By Clio.)
We were dumped there at the
usual unearthly hour and were told
variously that we had 8 to 16 kilos to
march. The road is the usual winding
one, refusing to run straight for more
than a hundred yards. It is noticeable in
France that if one starts from a given
point and walks long enough, just follow-
ing the road, one is surprised to reach the
commencing point just as the conclusion
is reached that it is time to turn back.
Walking along the tortuous road by
daylight, I had a Micawber-like feeling
that at any corner, "something might
turn up," but mostly it didn't, for the
estaminets were few and far between.
Well, we finally struck the village, and it
was fortunate our billeting N.C.O.'S were
there, for although the name of the place
appeared in large black letters on
the wall of a barn it was quite possible in
the dark, to march right through the
village without suspecting its existence.
The billet
itself was just an old barn with
a depth of hay sufficient to ensure
warmth and a comfortable sleep for the
troops. The hay however was a dimin-
ishing quantity, and as we watched the
daily armfuls withdrawn to feed the cal-
ves, we found ourselves ruefully wonder-
ing how long it would be before we
reached bedrock. The sky was not
visible through the roof, and as the latter
was plentifully festooned with spiders'
webs, we decided it must be rainproof.
As the pig had not previously been
housed there, we took possession with an
easy conscience secure in the knowledge
that no potential "soldiers'breakfast"
was roaming houseless, owing to our in-
vasion.
Twenty, yards away was an old
brick milli with a huge cumbersome-
looking wooden whhbl. To reach the mill
from the billet, one had to cross a little
rustic bridge, which spanned a stream of
beautifully clear water. The stream
at this point was fordable.
A climb up some slippery
worn stone steps enabled one to inspect
the mill wheel. Only a small volume
of water was required to turn the wheel
the remainder of the stream turning
sharply off and foaming itself down a
miniature fall. Altogether the sur-
roundings were peaceful and it didn't re-
quire much imagination to clothe the
country round about, in its spring
mantle and appreciate what a lovely
spot it would be later on.
Another platoon was billeted in a loft
above an estaminet. Gazing at the
ladder outside by which the platoon
gained access to its billet, I mentally
withdrew all unkind things I had said
when the rum issue was cut out.
A isions of pay nights made me dizzy.


However, it was a good place, was that
billet; how good we are now beginning
to realise. The sound of the running wat
-er at nights served as a lullaby for the
troops, and the noise of the guns was
not.
Captain V. C. Alderson M. C.
Arrives In India.
Captain Alderson who some time ago
transferred to the Indian Army has,
we are pleased to say, arrived safely at
his destination. He writes that he miss
-es the Battalion very much We
wish him the best of luck in his new
sphere.
THE IRONY OF FATE
Twelve men went marching out one
night,
With heavy packs, but spirits light.
The war from all their minds had
passed,
Their "Blighty" Leave had come at
last.
Two days had passed - twelve men
marched in,
Not one of them could raise a grin.
They'd reached the pier, and then,
alack,
Leave cancelled - they were all sent
back.
"GUTZERS" indeed - they're straf-
ing Fritz,
Instead of dining at the Ritz.
'Tis sad, but duty must be done,
So cheerfully they face the Hun.
-G. B. S.
* * *
The Yanks, have a 36 inch gun. The
recoil takes the wounded to the base
and brings back the rations. - Wireless.
"WHO'S WHO'' IN THE 22nd.
Colonel Wiltshire he hands out the
fines,
To the man who his Leave overstays,
Then the sentence is read in the lines,
It'sF. P. Royal Warrant - ten days.
Paddy Stewart is Adjutant now,
And his duties the wily Keith shares,
To their orders all O's. C. must bow,
Though each one of them often
despairs.
Jacky Smith is O. C. Lewis Guns,
Bobby Groves our intelligence gains,
While McCartin the Signallers runs,
Bobby Bourke at the Transport now
reigns.
Major Smith to our souls he attends,
Captain MacMahon our ailments
he heals,
And ould "Dinny" our footgear he
mends,
So he cares for both soles and for heels.
Old Tim Dorgan his needle he plies,
While to pay us old Froomes doesn't
fail,
The good Tom he keeps canteen
supplies,
And from Dickins we sometimes get
mail.
Reggie Hawkins our rations hands
out,
When there's plenty he's covered
with smiles,
If they're short, he will find a way
out,
He just says "You must see Tommy
Miles."
To the brave lads who fought and
went under,
May their share in our records ne'er
fade.
Our Battalion has made the Huns
wonder,
'Tis the best in the finest Brigade.
- G. B. S.


IN MEMORIAM.
by
Major F. H. Durnford, M. C. late Padre
22nd Battalion.
The opening number of the Battalion
Periodical would be incomplete without
some mark of respect for the Memory
of those of The Battalion' wh6 have
made the Supreme Self Sacrifice.
To do justice to the fortitude, valour
and endurance of the men who read
this periodical- to say in any adequate
way at all -what ought to be said about
them; how difficult this is! : As one
looks back and conjures up in one's
memory all one recollects about them,
their faces- the things they used to
say- their different ways of doing
things (often very characteristic of
themselves)- and the thousand and one
things by which they endeared them-
selves to their friends- it is not easy to
put down in writing much about our
friends. Still it may be profitable to put
down these few thoughts.
To begin with, they will never be for-
gotten. It may be said of them- as was
said of some famous men of olden time
(the words here quoted were written
about 180 8.C.) "Their seed shall remain
for ever and their glory shall not be
blotted out. So long as the world en-
dureth it shall not be blotted out.
Their memorial shalt not depart away
and their name shall live from gener-
ation to generation."
Does a man sometimes think that his
comrade is forgotten, his comrade with
whom he has shared everything since
they embarked together?
At such a time let him call to mind
the cross over the last resting place-
the letters written to the home folk by
company commander, friend, chaplain,
the official notice to the authorities- to
say nothing of the memorial that will
forever preserve his memory across
the sea.
What a wonderful sight those memor-
ials will be during the next decade!
North, South, East, West, they will be
erected: in Cathedral - Church - Chapel
as well as in. Public Hall - Institute -
Schoolroom and Market Place.
* * *
Their real selves and personalities
have not ceased to exist. Quite apart
from the theological side of the question-
and putting the matter on the basis of
Reason alone- is it not logically certain
that the sacrifices those heroic men
have made, do lead to something?
We all know that in trivial matters,
when we make sacrifices, or take some
action that costs us something, some.,
good al ways come out of it. How
much more will not the greatest sacri-
fice a man can make - namely his life-
lead, not to an indefinite vague noth-
ingness but to a very definite Future?
Our Fallen Comrades -as we call
them - Our Comrades who have indeed
voluntarily surrendered up their stat-
ure physique erect bearing and alert
step to lie prostrate and still on the
earth tor the sake of Australia and the
Empire send us a message. It is given
in two words- but surely two of the best
words that we can look up in the Dict-
ionary. "CARRY ON."
The modern scientist tells us that we
are now learning much about telepathy.
But I think it needs no telepathy to tell
us that were they with us now they
would say just that "Carry On."
1914-5-6-7-8 - Will it never end? We
all get dopy and fed up with army life
at times - who can help it? "Well when
we do let us be still for a moment and
try and listen in the silence to the
\ oices whispering that message "Carry
On." .


After all we owe it to them. It
would be untrue, disloyal to their mem
-ory to do anything else but carry on -
till the job is done. It is good to respect
the memory of heroes - by cross, or let-
ter, or public slab. But it seems to me
the finest way is by quietly observing
Nature's great Law of Continuity, to
go on with what they were compelled
to lay down.
There used to be in old days among
the Greeks a race called the Torch Race
where each runner in turn handed his
torch (often dropping dead beat while
he did it) to the next runner who in
turn handed it on again to the next.
There was also an old Roman custom
that the Lamp in the Temple of the
Vestal Virgins should always be kept
burning. Let us in our turn hand on
our torch and never let the light they
kindled go out.
ROLL OF HONOUR.
We regret to record the deaths on
active service of the following:-
2nd Lt bobbins L. A.
2nd Lt Parsons W. H.
5312 Pte Bartlett T. M.
6775 : Coridas L. G.
6851 : Mitchell F. J.

The Battalion sympathises deeply
with their relatives.
Musketry Instructor: "At the dirty
Bosch on the sky line"?
Discerning Pupil: "That's not a
Bosch sir; that's a Wack and that's a
dingbat with her."
Editorial Note
A permanent feature of this paper
will be the column "Latest- Bulletins."
Many men leave the Battalion from
time to time and nothing further is
heard of them. They may correspond:
perhaps, with one or two members of
the Battalion, but others of their pals
interested in their welfare, fait -to-
obtain tidings of them. So when you
hear from that pal of yours, just let us
know and we will publish a brief para,
under this heading. Other permanent
features will be "Random Shots" and
"We want to know" columns. Send
along suitable items, but dont make
them too personal for we have no de-
sire to be damaged.
Dont be bashful. Those funny little
stories and jokes that make you split
your sides, will make others laugh too.
Send them all along. Now that the
sap is beginning to rise, the spring
poets will be plunging into all the
agonies of composition. We want to see
their efforts. Some of them may be
printable.
All correspondence should be ad-
dressed to The Editor, Corporal C.
Blatchford.
Visit From
GENERAL BIRDWOOD'S SON.
The Battalion was recently visited by
2nd. Lt Birdwood, son of General Sir
W. R. Birdwood, Commander-in-Chief
of the Anzacs. Lt. Birdwood is only 18
years of age and is fresh from school.
In feature, he resembles his father very
much and is very keen to become at-
tached to an infantry battalion, in order
to gain experience.


WE WANT TO KNOW
When are we going to Italy, Egypt,
or even Australia? As Horatio has
relinquished the business, will some-
body else kindly prophesy?
Is the arms outwards stretch of Mr.
Proudfoot when issuing commands, a
new drill movement?
Is there any likelihood of the new
line dress (underpants and gum boots)
that Sgt. Tipping was endeavoring to
popularise some little while back, be-
ing adopted by the authorities?
Why a certain Sgt. keeps a pair of
running shoes handy? What is he pre-
paring for?
Did the R. S, M. ever recover that
dixie that an enterprising Lance Corp-
oral "borrowed."?
Was that football team of ours min-
nied or what happened? What a crash
there was when the 24th. skipped into
them.
Did Sgt. Lusby increase his know-
ledge of "jerks" at the N. C. O.'s school?
Who was the first member of the
Battalion to enter Baupaume? Was it
Driver Tod Flower riding Boko and
carrying a pair of wire cutters?
Do the Orderly Sgts. still have diffic-
ulty in finding fatigues? At recent rum
issues the number of thirsty men wear-
ing steel helmets and waterproofs was
surprising.
Who is the Senior Corporal
in the A. I. F? It is a vexed question.
Some argue for William, while others
plump for Oliver.
The name of the soldier who said to
the Colonel when the latter visited him
on post, "Hello, Digger, what company
do you belong to?"
Did Cpl. Crowley say anything when
he received a bag of gum boots in lieu
of a bag of rations?
What is the name of the officer who
is prepared to rush to the front with a
number of "wily diggers" and stop the
Hun should he break through?
Why did a certain member of the O.
M. recently remain on duty, though
wounded? Because he was (H)able.
Whether Pip Yic Martin and Monar
are going to remain cobbers if the latter
doesn't give up his present bad habit of
challenging every Hun he sees on the
opposite side of the river?
Whether that little bit of rum after-
wards has anything to do with the
present rush of volunteers for "A"
Company's patrols?
A Billjim's reason for those aeroplane
trailer signals that Fritz fires from the
ground sending up a string of sparks.
"You see the bloke in the 'plane has got
both his hands on the control wheel and
the only way the poor can get a
light for his fag is by his cobbers in the
trenches sending up a spark or two now
and then."
The password was "Paper." An
officer coming on a post in the darkness
was pulled up with an abrupt "Halt,"
and as quickly answered "Paper!"
Billjim.- "Pass Paper. All's well. You
haven't got "Truth" have you?"

MONT ST QURNTIN MEMORIAL.
k sum of �1230 has now been subscribed by the Division for the erection
of a monument to the memory of our comrades of the Division, vvho
lost their lives in the fighting round Mont St. Quentin. An Australian
soulptor in London will undertake the work.
The memorial will be plaoed near Elsa Trench, whence the 6th. Brigade hop-
ped off in the final attack. It will consist of a concrete base, with a series
of steps leading to a platform on which the statue will be erected. the
latter represents an Australian soldier in battle order (excepting that he
wears a soft hat). His bayonet is transfixing a German Eagle which he
is trampling underfoot. Around the base will be brass tablets descriptive
of the Battle, giving the names of the Units engaged and showing the
various arms at work.
The work for the brasses is being done by Miss George-Baker who
will come out from England and visit Mont �St. Quantin next week.
Colonel Annand of the 2nd Pioneer Battalion will be in charge of the
construction of the concrete foundations and base, and it is hoped that the
rest of the memorial will be ready for erection! at a not too distant date.
When the friends and relatives of the brave men who died on this
hotly contested field, visit the scene they will find a worthy and striking
memorial TO the valor of those whoi? so gallantly fought and bled there.


"THE TWENTY SECOND'S
ECHO."
April, 1919.
this is the final issue of the
Twenty Second's" paper we
acknowledge our indebtedness to all
those contributors whose efforts have
enabled us to publish twenty-one
editions. For consistent contributions
special thanks are due to Colonel
Wiltshire, Capt. E. Gorman, Corp. E.
Stell and Pte L. Pimbiett whose
sketches have been a most interesting
decorative feature of this paper.
We also desire to mention our appre-
ciation of the loyal cooperation of
Ptes. A. H. Ladd' and E. E. Webster,
who have been associated ?in ?-the
production of the journal since its
inception
We have heard an oft expressed
wish for a continuance of "The Echo"
in Melbourne. Nothing can be done
here to give effect to that wish,
but should the members of the Re-
turned Club decide to issue a per-
iodical publication, doubtless the name
of "The Echo" will be perpetuated.
The activities of "The Twenty Sec-
ond Returned Social Club" will
doubtless demand a periodical chron-
icle, and such a publication would
do much to keep country members in
couch. The project may be consid-
ered in Melbourne at ? Inter date,
when the Club's rr r-- '> -ship rolls
i re completed.
BOXING CHAMPIONSHIP.
?
WALKER WINS.
TRIBUTE TO A. I. F.
j[lM the presence of large and en-
thusiastic crowds, boxing cham-
pionships for the Army Corps were
decided at Charleroi, on March 10,
11, 12 and 14. The boxing was con-
ducted under Army and Navy rules.
This Battalion was represented
by Pie. Walker who won the cham-
pionship of the light heavy class in
fine style. He was never extended.
The Fifth Division gained the highest
number of points.
At the conclusion of the bouts the
championship prizes were presented to
winners by General Sir H. Rawlinson
G.C.8., G.C.VO., K.C.M.G., the Com-
mander of the Fourth Army, who
afterwards addressed the gathering
from the ring. Choosing his words
with great deliberation, the General
paid a fine tribute to the A.I. F.
After recalling how the Corps had
learnt the art of war by the severe
battles and hardships of the years
1915 to 1917, General Rawlinson said:-
"T realise what I am saying, and I
speak the truth when I say that
the Australian Army Corps is the
finest and best in the whole British
Army."
This remarkable testimony from
a public platform in the presence


of many English officers, was re-
ceived with great enthusiasm by the
troops - more especially as General
liawlmson has the reputation of be-
ing sparing with his praise.
At the instance of General Sir J T.
Hobbs, three hearty cheers were
given for the Army Commander
POZIERES REVISITED
Some account of a recent visit to
Pozieres may be of interest to
old " Twenty Second" bo.vs who fought
there. Our party in charge of the
erection of the memorial cross was
faced with several problems - the
main one being how to transport
ourselves, a huge wooden cross, picks,
shovels, rations for a week, barrels
of cement and bags of sand from
Charleroi in Belgium down to the
battlefield - a distance of some 120
miles. However we managed to get
ourselves and gear on a train and
got as far as Mons, before deciding
that any other means of locomotion
would be better than a, dead slow
Army train. At Mons we struck a
Tommy motor lorry park and put
the bard word on their Colonel ( who
was a good sport) for a lorry to
Cambrai. Arrived there we dumped
our cargo and started to look round
for another lorry park. This we
found and eventually secured a lorry
by dint of Australian cheek and
bribing a Tommy sergeant. The rest
of the distance to Pozieres was cov-
ered in tine style, and oil arriving
there we made ourselves known to
the 0. C. of the 278 th Prisoners of
War Company, who had his Huns
there busily engaged cleaning up
some of the mess they made in 1916.
Next morning we erected the 13' 6"
high cross about 30 yards west of
Gibraltar (which was 22nd Battalion
H.Q. during all the Pozieres fighting)
and about, the same distance in from
the Bapaume-Albert Rd. The erection
of a railing completed a very fine
job and the result is that the brave
22nd boys who fell at Pozieres, have
a splendid memorial that will endure
for years and will be one of the
outstanding landmarks of the district.
The opportunity was taken of attend-
ing to all scattered graves of Red and
Purple lade and putting their surround-
ings in good order. While we were at
Pozieres the Maireof the village and
his daugther returned and were living
among the ruins.
Our return journey to Charleroi
was done by "lorry hopping" as far as
Cambrai, and then by various trains
ranging from goods trains to the
Paris-Liege express.
In passing, we sent a small party
out to Beaurevoir and Montebrehain
to tend the graves of the boys who
fell in our last fight of the campaign.

THE TRIALS OF "GUNBOAT."
A* no stage in its history lias the
Battalion been so closely assoc-
iated with Belgian civil life as dur-
ing the last few months. Officers
and men have alike been received
with open handed hospitality which
will be remembered long alter the
last member of the Battalion lias
received thirty shillings to purchase
a civvy suit. One of our officers,
who wears amongst other things, two
stars and three ribbons, and whom
we will oall "Gunboat" knows more
of-the depths of Belgian hospitality
than most of as.
While at Gourdin ne, "Gunboat"
endeared himself to the people with
whom he was billeted. On the day
of the removal to Marcinelle, copious
tears were shed over his person and
he was only released from the fam-
ily embrace, on promising to return
each weekend.
The first week end visit was a
pronounced success. The second one
was memorable. The journey from
Marcinelle was made on a very cold
wet day. Nothing daunted "Gunboat"
set out and arrived at his destination
soaked and shivering.
The labor of caressing in turn every
member of the family exhausted him.
He coughed and the eagle-eyed old
Madame detected symptoms of'flue.
He was immediately put to bed.
Normally ""Gunboat" isn't over-
weighted with avoirdupois, and after
24 hours treatment, he was but a
shadow of his former self. Hot
bricks were placed against his feet,
his body was packed with hot sand
bags, and cloths dipped in boiling
water applied to his head. The weight
of the blankets oppressing him pre-
vented his moving an inch. He was
dosed with pills washed down by a
steaming beverage, concocted from all
the noxious weeds, known as herbs
in Belgium.
Madame was untiring and worthily
maintained the traditions handed
down by.Florence Nightingale. While
the patient suffered untold agonies,
his murnaurings and appealing glan-
ces were interpreted as signs of
gratitude. As a last resort, lie de-
termined to try telepathy. Fur'two
hours and thirty one minutes, he lay
motionless, concentrating his remain-
ing energies on an 5.0.5., which slowly
but surely disturbed the slumbers of
a very healthy brother officer in an
adjoining chamber. Finally the lat-
ter awoke with a sense of impending
disaster. He dressed hastily and
burst into "Gunboat's'' room, deter-
mined to confide his fears and make
plans for an early departure. He
found his friend in a state of collapse
with Madame contentedly purring
over him, mistaking the swoon for a
peaceful sleep - the ? consummation of
her whole-hearted ministrations.
Oh yes"Gunhoat recovered but that
is another story . - E.T,

OURSELVES
last issue of the "Echo," the
Battalion has continued to live
more or less quietly in billets at
Marcinelle. The excitement of the
gay life of Charleroi has commenced
to wear off, and the majority of
troops continue anxiously to antic-
ipate the next Home draft. Prophecy
is more thankless than usual in
these days of strikes, but it is under-
stood that the "Heads" are laying
odds on a draft pushing off in the
first few days of April. Meanwhile
the Brigade has been still further
concentrated and now consists of
one large composite Battalion under
Colonel Wiltshire, although the sep-
arate identity of each unit is being
preserved right up to the death knock.
Taken all round it would be hard
to find more comfortable billets than
we now have. All the diggers are
well dug in, and most have real
beds to sleep in, and all the com-
forts of home life. From all accounts
conditions here are a hundred times
better than over in Blighty, and if
there is any waiting to be done,
here's the place to do it. All the
same it is the fervent hope of every
Two-two that no more interruptions
happen in the demobilization.
It is expected that after the next
draft goes, the remainder of the sth
and 7th Brigades will come over to
Marcinelle, and what is left of the
stli Division will replace them at
Marchienne. After that nobody seems
to know what is going to happen.
MARCINELLE.
The origin of the name has been
much discussed. Probably it takes
its origin from that of the Roman
General, Marcellus, who is said to
have been buried hereabouts. Many
vestiges of the Koman occupation
have been found, mainly by excav-
ation at various times, when new
buildings in the suburbs have had
their foundations laid. Funeral vases
coins, medals, and pieces of Roman
armour have all been unearthed.
Marcinelle Church is built of rare
old stone, weathered white by age.
Some authorities say it was erected
in 9th century - some 11th Records
exist which show that the choir was
rebuilt in 14th century and lateral
chapels in 15th:* A very ancient cem-
etery used to encircle the Church.
Inside there, is a fine triumphal
cross 500 years old, and fonts of
similar age with ancient inscriptions.
The pictures, are aged and valuable
and there is a statue of Notre Dame
de Walcourt. A picture over the High
Altar recalls a miracle operated
thereby in 1732.
Marcinelle suffered much in the
different sieges of Charleroi, espec-
ially the wars 1692, 1693 and 1794.


I l|�f)D?lTo(?
'
The Bridge leading into Charleroi
"when erected was a novelty in en-
gineering owing to rigid girders be-
ing used without the usual crose
beam supports. It was built to
plans executed by a professor at
L�uvain University.
FUND S.
From Ist. inst. all canteens are
being run as branches of the Div-
isional Canteen. One result of this
will be that about �l2O capital now
in our canteen will be freed
for Regimental Funds. This,
added to present balance and
to an expected dividend of
nearly �5O from Brigade
Cinema profits, will bring our
funds up to a credit balance
of about �3OO. The spending
of some of this on a Batt-
alion dinner in the near fut-
ure is now under consider-
ation. A sum of about �5O
has already been paid into
a sinking fund to provide
for comforts for the troops
on homegoing transports.

BATTALION DANCES
For some weeks past
each Wednesday evening
the Battalion has held
a Grand Ball in the
Local Du Cerole G.ym-
nastique, Marcinelle. As
social functions these
gatherings have been
marked by complete
success, and reflect
credet on the organisers.
On each of these eveni-
ings things have gone
merrily from 7 o'clock
to nearly midnight.
Incidental music was
supplied by the Band
Orchestra. The boys
generally appreciated the
dances as they afford
some small opportunity
of returning the many
kindnesses extended to
them by the civilians.
r . Sgt. 'Dad' St u rrock
has devoted his after-
noons to the instruction
of diggers in the art of
dancing and many of his
pupils have graduated
into the ballroom.
Sturrock's Academy has
become a most popular
institution, and we won-

I'HE TWENTY SECOND'S ECHO
Tea in Support Trench - Westhoek Ridge, Sept. 1917

In a Charleroi paper a letter was
recently published about the treat-
ment generally of ex-army horses
and mules. It went on to state the
need for patience, as the animals
hitherto had only been used to Eng-
lish. It is suggested that a few of
the Transport Section might get jobs
as interpreters to translate, the orders
of the owners into pure Australian.
The workers of Charleroi observed
3rd March as a day of general strike
and demonstration. Miners andotheis
paraded the streets as a protest against
alleged long hours and scanty pay.
Labor conditions here are about a
century behind those of Aussie, and
the present agitation is for an eight
hour day. A. feature of the mines
is the laborious surface work done
by girls, who toil for 10 hours. The
men and boys working underground,
seem to be very fed up with con-
ditions.
An interesting lecture was delivered
on 15th March by Mr C. Vaughan,
ex-premier of S.A. His subject was
" America and Britain " Mr VAughan
recently concluded a lecturing tour
of 12 months in the U.S., whither he
went at the invitation of the Amer-
ican Government, to seek to vis-
ualise to the people, the part Aus-
tralia had played in the war.
Copies of "The Twenty Second s
Echo" are filed in the Melbourne
Publio Library for future reference.
A letter has been received from the
Chief Librarian acknowledging re-
ceipt and stating that "the papers
are of great interest and will be
much sought for in the future.
While we read of the Hue s in-
cursions at home we have not our-
selves been entirely free from its
annoying presence. Although a fair
number of members of the Battalion
have had to lay up for a few days
there have been no serious ca.�es.
Among the Belgian civilians the
epidemic seems to have assumed
large proportions, if the all too fre-
quent tolling of church bells and
passing of funerals can be taken as
an index.
The Brigade Cinema was closed
for a few days but it soon re-com-
menced business.
After Church Parade on 23rd ult.
the Archdeacon of Stowe (Lincoln-
shire) gave a talk on Industrial Mat-
ters and presented his point of view
in a convincing manner, giving
his audience plenty to think about be-
fore he had finished. Naturally on a
subject like this, opinions differ, and
there were many present who did

not at all agre� with everything
the speaker said. Still his argu-
ments provided food tor discussion
in the billets and the pro s and cons
were much debated over the stew,
plum and apple etc., at lunch time.
Oil the 20th Mr A. Sharp gave a
lecture at the Cinema Hall mainly
on "Going on the Land." His sound
practical advice was much appreciated
and should do much to save diggers
loss of money when they get hack.
Mr Sharp stressed particularly the
necessity for a good deal of prac-
tical experience in farming before
embarking any money. He advised
about 2 years "jackerooing" before
launching out. Another point in the
lecture was the need for one and
all to have the will to work hard
as the Repatriation Dept., though
liberal, cannot give "something for
.nothing" and all loans made by it
must sooner or later be repaid by
cash earned by hard work.
?The lecturer was formerly Editor
of the Victorian Agricultural Journal
and was also associated some years
ago with Dookie College.
Now, (as Immigration Expert re-
presenting Victoria in London) he has
the distinction of being one of the
very few Australians at Australia
House. Most of the other people
who hold good jobs there have never
seen Aussie.
Since the Armistice about 30 or 40
new reinlorcment# have joined up.
Colonel Wiltshire addressed the new
arrivals and gave them a, hearty
welcome to the unit.
The C.O. commented on the splendid
work done by the reinforcement draft
which joined up before the Mont St.
Quentin operations and reminded the
new-comers of their responsibility in
upholding the fine reputation of the
Battalion, right up until the date
when the last man is demobilised.
These new boys are a. smart looking
draft and have made many friends
among the older soldiers. We wish
them the best of luck and a happy
stay with the Battalion.
It happened near Baizieux. A col-
umn of Australians was passing a
typical batch of subdued and docile
Tommies engaged on road-mending
Some of the Aussies were playing up
and said one Tommy to his mate,
"Say, Choom, if oi wov an Australia!
oi would be s woild feller."
On 4th March, Capt W. J Denm
M ('., gave a lecture on Re pa: viatioi
and demobilisation in the Cinenv
Hall. Capt. Denny was forme-
Attorney General of S.A., and enlistee
as a private. He said there are 10,
000 wives of members of the A.I.E.
waiting in England for transport
home. Evidently the digger has been
active since the Armistice when there
were on !v 7,000.

AMOROUS ALEX.
By S.B.R.
carefully seleoted a good post
for lounging against and with grave
deliberation expectorated through
the spokes of the cooker wheel.
"The fact that in England at the
present dace, there are 10,000 wives
of diggers waiting boats for Aussie,
opens up some interesting specu-
lations," he remarked, "all the more
so because not later than November
last there were only 7,000. Evid-
ently since the War stopped, 3,000
more love lorn Anza.es have rushed
into the holy and pleasant bonds
with their accompany ing novelties of
honeymoons and separation allow-
ances."
"And very nice too ! " remarked old
Porky, the off-sider, who was peeling
spuds and spoke with all the con-
sciousness of being the father of six.
Alex disregarded this interruption
and continued "From present indic-
ations there will be a fair number
of our blokes wandering round Blighty
as late as July this year, and rec-
koning the present marriage rate to
continue, the total wives in July
ought to be about 13,000.
"Especially as the sentimental
season of Spring is now at hand"
said Porky, "the sap rising, the little
birds singing and the orange blossoms
gaily blooming on the orange blos-
som trees."
"Yes" went on Alex, dreamily,
"adding 13,000 husbands to 13,000
wives you have a total figure of
2fc,000 who want the special trans-
port; ot family boats, joint passages
and all the other luxuries to be
dished out by the repatriation mob -
perhaps! "
"You're forgetting 'Jes enfants' "
said Porky, tipping the spuds into
a dixie, "just as it is not considered
the best form to have 'enfants' with-
out, weddings, so it seems impossible
to have latter without the former. "
"Reckoning one 'enfant' for each
family, you have another 13,000
bringing your total family strength
for transport up to 39,000."
Alex slowly unwound himself from
his supporting post and staggered by
the magnitude of the figures, "Blime"
he exclaimed, "how's the getting
home ot us mere bachelors going to
be done if this marrying wave
keeps on ? "
"You can take it from me"
said Porky, with all the confidence
of one who knows "it will keep on.
There's plenty says it's not fair to
Aussie tabbies, but have they thought
ofwhatarush of emigrants there'll
be to Aussie after the Peace - all
fine young coves fed up with the
cold country? It will be the turn
of the Blighty bints to roar when
these blokes start marrying the
Aussie girls. I reckon, sonny, that

self wont have a chance of finding
an Aussie girl once the pommy rush
starts[ "
"P'raps you're right" said Alex
pensively, as he moved of! mut-
tering something about fixing the
day tout�-de-suite with that fluffiest
little, dearest little, sweetest little
bit of skirt in Glasgow, who'd been
sending him the long letters a,nd
the shortbread ever since his last
leave there.
KING'S COLORS
King's Colors will be presented to
the Battalion at an early date on a
ceremonial parade. These fine Colors
are being presented to each fighting
Regiment in the A.1.F., and will be
sent back to Australia in the special
care of a selected Color party.
Ours will be banded over to the
Home Battal ion, 22nd Infantry (Yarra
Borderers) at Gipps Street Richmond,
Victoria. Before sending them home,
an endeavour will be made to have
them dipiiued in the Rhine. All the
flags at present with the Battalion
have already made the trip to Col-
ogne and have been well and truly
im me rsed.
The Battalion colors that were
sent home from St. Vast (near Amiens)
have arrived safely in the bands of
Col R A Crouch, V.D.
2nd Lt. A. Tipping is back in Aus-
tralia ere this. Writing at sea, be
reports the presence on the same
boat of Sgt. Kinsman, Pte. J. Palise,
Mrs W. De Boos and - the baby. Tip
expected to break the monotony of
the voyage by fatigue work (mind-
ing the baby.)
Pte. Percy Hill has added an M.M.
to his 1914-5 ribbon. As he has about
five wound stripes as war souvenirs,
the smiling Percy may be considered
well decorated. Good luck !
Lt Charlie Button M.C., was mar-
ried while on leave recently. Con-
gratulations ! : Speculation is now
rife in the Officers' Mess as to who
will be the next to follow suit.
Some familiar faces are again on
view in the Battalion, owing to the
return of old identities like Laury
Binns, Vic. N- Moore W. De Boos
and W. Pinkerton, from O. T . C.'s in
Blighty. This quartette are trying to
sustain the weight of pip* and Sam
Brownes, as if their commisions
dated back years instead of days.

(In bound volume The Twenty Second 1 s Box 48,
Echo, in Mitchell Library). Ballarat,
Victoria.
(13/2/24)
Sir,
Under separate cover I am forwarding a bound volume of the
complete numbers of a trench journal called the "Twenty Second's Echo".
The issue of this paper was commenced in the Ypres section and it was
actually printed from time to time in varions positions along the front
line of France and Belgium. The press used was a very small BHB
hand one which was carried round by the 22nd. Battalion on a limber
and installed from time to time in any convenient dug-out. The blocks
for the illustrations were all made by London "Punch". The procedure
was to send the original sketch or photograph over to London and back
by some one going on leave.
As the number of these trench journals in the A. I. F. was
strictly limited it seems that the volume in question will have a
growing historical value as time passes. For that reason I am
offering it to you for whatever sum you like to suggest and would be
glad to hear from you.
Yours truly,
A.R.Wilshire.
