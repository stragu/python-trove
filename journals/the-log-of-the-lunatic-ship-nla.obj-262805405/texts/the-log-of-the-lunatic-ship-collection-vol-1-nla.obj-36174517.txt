The Log
OF THE
Lunatic Ship
The name of newspaper has reference to the
fact that the on which we travel is
known at the Admiralty as the “Lunatic Ship,"
on account of the many hairbreadth escapes
that she has already had. May she have one
more and may we be there to see. This paper
presents its compliments to the gallant Skipper,
and wishes him every sort of luck ; the toast
to be honoured when the first ram ration is
issued—meanwhile the wishes are in full working
order.—(Ed.).


The Log of the Lunatic Ship
VOL. I.
THE INTRODUCTION
Fathered by war and mothered by the ocean*
we present for your inspection our newspaper
bantling, to be handed round, read and criticised.
But, as with the human babies in such case, you
must deal gently with its faults. Be kind then to
the “Log/ ’ or old mother ocean may come blunder-
ing in at your porthole, and /[ take it out of” your
kit bag and “the little thingsythat a. fellow cares
about.”
We are well aware that print means many
coats of paint on merely written words. Well*
we’ve got to give you the naked article without the
paint.
Here is a community of nigh upon 2,000 people,
mostly males. It is a good-sized country town
adrift without an address. It is never anywhere
in particular, but always—“somewhere on the sea”
—or anchored in a port wdthout a name, in no
particular continent. However, it is full of news
of various kinds. It is a mine of good paragraphs*
verse, and short yarns, and we hereby appoint the
population of the aforesaid town our contributors
and reporters, only rehiinding them that space is
limited, and that the censor is in our midst.
The size of this issue will be plain evidence that
much sifting will have to be done if the whole of
the staff just appointed gets to work. Therefore*
put your best nibs to paper, heave ahead, and get
into the “Log.”
■':: o :
Printed and published aboard the “Lunatic
Ship” by Messrs. Looney, Mooney, and Dope, at
great risk to limb and life, on materials very kindly
lent by a gentleman named Smith,
HOT MONEY BUT BRAINS.
Our editor’s box, which is situated on G deck,
has not yet been bombarded with contributions.
Some blighter, with a perverted sense of humour,
led off by filling it with stale bread crusts and cheese
parings. . His mental. standard can as easily be
imagined as his /‘bringing ups.” However, the
instalment of the “box” (which, by the way, is a
large sized biscuit tin, open at the neck), was re-
sponsible for one humorous incident when we an-
nounced its presence and called for-contributions.
A khaki-clad hero glanced at it doubtfully and in-
quired of a pal: “What’s that for?” “Contribu-
tions for the newspaper,” replied the pal,
“ ’Struth, I don’t want to cast any reflections on the
surrounding honesty, but do you think it would be
safe to leave money for the paper in that ’ere
place?” was the reply. Way, comrades, it is not
shining..silver, but bright paragraphs! of happening
—-the humorous, or tragic, which have come beneath
your notice , on shipboard or any old where in the
military. We require pithy pars or pieces of
jingle from you all to assist to make the “Log” a
shining success. The object of the “Log” is to pro-
vide a little literary diversion during the voyage.
Copies in future will be sold at 3d., and there should
be sufficient for all hands and the cook available ui
the price. All profits will be donated to the
ROYAL MERCHANT SEAMEN’S ORPHANAGE.
Wow, don’t be shy. Let us have an avalanche of
letters, paragraphs, and jingles to keep the “Log”
merrily rolling.
PERSISTENT.
There was a gay doctor named ——
Who had the hilarious knack
Of joking with ladies,
Who wished him to Hades,
But still he keeps hard on their track.


In the Stars v. Stripes (Officers v, N'.G.O.’s)
cricket match the latter suffered an ignominious
wash-out, 38 to 11 being the scores in favour of the
Stars. The bowling of Spofforth, Turner, and
Trumble w r as simply overshadowed by that of Ser-
geant Teddy Hill. His deliveries in turn struck
the roof, the lower portion of a sergt.-major’s spine,
the starboard net, and, finally, almost knocked one
of the three sisters out of her deck chair. Sensa-
tional f Bather!!
Since boat drill and lifebuoy parades some of
the men are contracting “submarinitis.’’
T’other night, just as the Sergeants ’ Mess was
spooning to slumber, the pantry door slammed with
a; reverberating clash, and one gallant sergeant sat
holt upright in his hammock, with his hair standing
on end—“My God,” he ejaculated, “have we been
torpedoed.”
Mess Orderlies are taking a glorious pride in
polishing up their tinware since the half-sovereign
prize has been promised for the most dazzling dis-
play. Private Price, of the 36th, has made all the
other Mess Orderlies turn purple with envy. The
Colonel spoke to Private Price one morning.
“What did he say?” eagerly inquired the other
Mess Orderlies, as the “head serang” moved along.
‘ ‘ Oh, he only said he would like to borrow MY
dixie for a shaving glass,” said Price solemnly.
One of the Signallers occasionally borrows that
marvellously polished dixie to heliograph messages
back to his best girl in Melbourne, PACT!
The martinet drill sergeant in last act, scene
of shipwreck. He is about to drop off the raft
exhausted, and gives his last order: —“ Hang on*
you blighters! Nobody under the rank of sergeant
allowed to smile in this part of the blanky sea. . . ,
Hang on, d’yer hear? . . . firm grip with both
hands . . . head erect . . . legs swinging
easily to the motion of the sea . . . body . , ,
Goo’-bye.” , - ,
Private Stubbs of the 35th is a human dynamo
of condensed energy. Daily he boxes all comers
and knocks ’em like ninepins. He is ever open to
scratch-pull; wrestle, or sing any son of a gun on
board or out in the world. When boxing, the light
of battle in his eye is calculated to make the boldest
quail, and at detailing physical jerks he has more
style and determination than any S.S.M. He has
risen like a rocket, promoted by his pals from, pri-
vate to corporal, to sergeant, and now to the dizzy
pinnacle of sergeant-major. There is no doubt
about the field-marshal’s baton in his knapsack.
The officer of the bridge is always sharply; on
the look-out for things uncommon, and sometimes
he is rewarded by the sight of strange things. Last
Sunday the wonders of the deep struck him hard
where he carries his astonishment. He had scanned
the horizon and was bringing his outlook home again
when he caught sight of something in one of the
boats swinging above the topmost deck. Thinking
he must have gone to sleep standing up, he rubbed
his eves and looked again. There was no mistake
it was the real thing in naked bodies lying under-
side unpermost across two seats of the boat. The
officer jumped to the natural conclusion that some
hideous murder had been committed in broad day-
light, and he steadied himself with a deep draught
of ozone, which is the Lunatic Ship’s substitute for
grog. The chief of the Scotland Yard force was
hastily sent for, and told to approach the corpse
carefully lest the murderer should be lurking near
his prey. Being constitutionally unable to be care-
tul in the face of danger, the M.P. made a dash for
the boat and looked in. It was only Billzac taking
a sunbath. The Sol-abluting soldier was staggered
to find that what was quite the thing inside the
Bendi swimming bath was “agin regs.” on a troop-
ship. , j ;
Three whoops for Bandmaster Bradley and the
band aboard. Like a young kangaroo, it has im-
proved by leaps and bounds. Even the porpoises
following the ship now cock an appreciative ear up
out of the ocean when Bandmaster Bradley turns
his melody on at the meter.
BLUE WATER PARS.


The munition workers are a unit of merry men :
they are living a life of luxurious ease at present—
no physical " jerks 77 in the morning, no mess orderly
horrors, no putting on puttees to attend Church
parades, no nuffln 7 . They are longing to be jug-
gling with shells;;, ,so we suggest; that the chief
steward should supply them with a couple of shells
each for breakfast, with fresh"hen-fruit” inside to
fill the - aching void. Doubtless they would look
upon it as an (ahem) egg-shell-ent ideal
Once after a heated argument between a sailor
and a soldier as to their respective professions, the
soldier asked the' sailor: " When do you intend put-
ting your beard oh the reserve list? 77 "When you
put your tongue on the civil list/ 7 was the sailor's
witty retort, o/n.
Whilst' issuing kit to some recruits in one of the
camps lately, the Q.M.S. asked one of the recruits
what size headgear he required. "Six-seven-
eighths, 77 wns the answer. "Next, 77 cried the busy
Q.M.S. "What size headgear do you take? 77 ad-
dressing a burly recruit. "If that in front of me
took a 6-7-3, and .I 7 ve got a bigger head, I thinks,

commend this man for the Military Police.—Ed.)
One long blast and three short ones on Friday
morning and all and sundry flew for their lifebelts
and scurried like stampeded brumbies for their boat
stations. No casualties are reported to have occur-
red during the helter-skelter. One company,
though, rushing upstairs met another coming down,
and for a moment there threatened to be an irre-
sistible body meeting an immovable object, but one
crowd decided politely to wait. It wouldn't do for
this to happen if a "tinned fish 77 gets its strike into
our hull. However, all the troops looked real
swank in their cork corsets—excepting those who
had them on up-side-down.

Lately at - : Military Camp, somewhere
in Australia, a soldier was returning from final
about midnight. He was in a mood of mixed jovi-
ality and bitterness "engendered by unwise and vari-
ous potations. A stalwart hot pie distributor was
shouting about the succulence and savourine'ss of
his wares, and laying great stress upon their heat.
To him the soldier: “Are they really hot! ” “Hot-
test pies ever made.” “Very hot indeed’s wot I
want, ’ ’ said the soldier, 6 ‘ Can T beat these, they ’re
red hot.” The soldier steadied himself, and with
great deliberation answered, “Then tie ’em round
your frozen feet, you cold-footed —-——111”

A LETTER HOME.
Dear Mother,--- ■ 1: ■
We are having a bosker time, and may well say
4 ‘This is the life.”
Excitement! Dear heart, there’s plenty of
that. As I write we are being chased by three
enemy cruisers which are constantly firing at us-
Just before tea a 12-inch shell lobbed on the deck
close to me. I was unconcernedly shaving at the
time, so I put down my razor and picked up the
shell and threw it overboard (that means into the
sea, you know). My O.C. talks about the V.C., but
I thought nothing of it, and don’t like to hear the
boys cracking me up. The cruisers will never catch
us, we are too fast. The stokers are all working at
once, and each man has two indiarubber tubes in
his mouth, and they pour beef tea down one and
port wine down the other all the time. Isn’t it
wonderful!
The day before yesterday four submarines
suddenly popped up, two on each side, and tried to
torpedo us. Bless you they hadn’t got a show. We
turned and twisted like a wounded snake. There
was a heavy sea running, and once they nearly had
us. They fired two torps (that’s slang for torpedo)'
at us at once, but the ship was, standing up on end
at the top of a big wave, and the torps both passed
under her. Luck, wasn’t it, dear mother ? Oh !
it s the life for mine alright. Then they waited a
bit and made a splendid shot for us amid ship (that
means in the middle of the ship), but Bill Jones: and
I—you remember Bill—threw over a bit of netting
that they use to keep the cricket balls from going
over the side. We .caught the torp and landed it
harmlessly on the deck. You should have heard the
cheering. The Captain said I could bring it home,
and when I come I will present it to our Museum
at dear old Bundadungababu. I think I will stop
now, though I could fill pages with the extraordin-
ary things I have seen and done. Do not give this
letter to the Bundadungababu “Banner.” "News-
papers are quite unable to believe the things we do,
but if they have got a new editor and not that snuffy
old thing that used to be there, you can just let him
have a look at it. It seems a pity not to let the
people know what the boys, are going through.
My w r ord, they’ve got nerve. '
POETS' CORNER.
■ FADDY. ' ...
He wears a red band round his hat,
A cane clasped in his hand,
And round the deck goes' pit-a-pat
In manner simply grand.
He’s keenly witched by every “rogue,”
And he speaks with a fruity brogue.
You’ll twig him at the dry canteen,
His glance is fearful stern,
For “pointers” he don’t care a bean,
He makes them take their turn.
At tracking “crooks, ” well, bet your bones
He paralyses Sherlock Holmes.
He strides as if he ownsi the ship,
And wicked is his wink.
And if you “bloques” give too much lip
He’ll cork you in the clink.
When gazing on him, faith, you scan
A wondrous Oirish gintleman.
TO GLADDEN.
How soon we would gladden the world
How easily risrht each wrong,
If nobody shirked, but each man worked
To help his fellows along.
A PRATER TO CAPT. MILLINGTON.
Dear Captain, we all pray of you,
Wed] give the Bosches beans,
If you will land us at the Thames
And dodge the submarines.
(For we have not the slightest wish
To taste old Kaiser Bill’s tinned fish.)
TO HER.
And I shall feel, wherever yon may he.
Even tho’ in absence, and in alien clime,
The shadow of the sunniness of thee,
Hovering in patience through the clouded time.
Stay, stay/ 5 she ; cried, “stay. by my side/ 5
. It stayed™ of co Asht did I 1 : ;


OUT OF THE BOX.
Some people live in deadly fear that their fel-
low-man is eternally attempting to take them down -
One of our braves from the back-blocks was ten-
dered his issue card lately to sign for one clasp
knife. But he bucked. “Yes, I have the knife,
but you haven’t given me the clasp yet!”
A gem from Adam Lindsay Gordon that is al-
ways well worth remembering, so far as our own
mates are concerned, during the big job we have
taken on
“Life at best is troth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone:
Kindness in another’s trouble,
Courage in your own.”
“Soldiering?” ejaculated one of the knuts the
other night, as he paced the boat deck beneath the
glory of the stars. “I’ve completely forgotten that
I am a soldier. I’m having such a ripping time
since coming aboard. Soldiering! Why, hli’me,
feel more like a tourist”!
The latest wireless whisper states that Chidley
has enlisted in Sydney, and is forming a bare-legged
brigade to help pulverise Kaiser Bill. Chid states
that as Bill of Yarmany has asked for Her Tag he
will give him the “Answer.” Bnlly for Chidley
Bill.
It is noticed since the war began that Bulgaria
Rock is superseded by Roumanian Rock; and it’s a
brave man who is game to go into Sargent’s and
ask for a Berlin him with his coffee; the waitress
would wither him with a glance of “scone.”
THE MYSTERY OF 666.
It is not generally known that the Great Sea
Battle occurred on the 666th day of the war, that
Lord Kitchener was in his 66th year, whilst the news
of his death was received on the 6th day of ihe 6th
month of 1916, and the crew of the “Hampshire 5 ’
numbered 666,
THE AUSTRALIAN BUGLER.
(We are publishing this little ballad, written
on board, to be read to the kiddies back at home).
I wonder if yon trooper folks - ■
Hare ever heard the tale
Of the young Australian Bugler
Whom Hun scouts did assail.
They took him as a prisoner,
s Twas in the Kaiser’s days,
When that bombastic Emperor tried,
To set the world ablaze,
A very easy thing to plan,
But difficult to do,
As Haig and French made clear to him
At Marne and Pozieres too.
To come back to our Bugler Boy,
They took him for a spy,
They dragged him to the Emperor,
“Plead guilty or deny.”
With courage high the lad replied,
■ “A Bugler Boy am I,
A young Australian soldier,
Pd scorn to act the spy.” f .
“WeTl soon see if these words be true,
A bugle bring to aid;
Kow little bugler sound the Charge,”
The Kaiser curtly said.
With head erect and flashing eye i
The bugler blew the call;
“How, the ‘Retire, iP the Emperor said,
The lad moved not at all.
In firm but yet respectful tones,
The Bugler Boy replied, y
“Your Majesty, I know not that,
Australians: ne’er retire.”
“Good,” said the Kaiser, “ you are brave,
And truthful I can see,
That boy could never be a spy,
Unbind and set him free,”
* iQ >*, —i
At least one swaddy with us is in haste to get
to heaven by any means. It is rumoured that he
was charged the other day with burgling another
chap’s bag of a bible. Kow had it been a flask of
whisky, well, we might not have been so staggered,
but a Bible!
Ob ! Shermominy !!!


FOR THE SOLDIERLY SPIRIT.
Leave ofi: cadging cigarettes from your cob-
bers-. Buy your own, they’re cheap enough.
Don’t hog all the batter at the table in one bit,
other men besides yourself like to have their innards
greased with the substance- churned from the coo
juice.
If a pal is asleep with his money-belt beneath
his head, leave it there. He can spend all the
“dough” it contains- without your able assistance.
Covet not bis cap, nor bis equipment, nor his
hammock, nor his overcoat, nor anything that is
his, because it is better or handier than your own.
Perchance he has a private mark on all his gear, and
you may find yourself in the clink if you yield to
temptation.
Have a bath at least once in a decade, and
change your shirt once in a blue moon. School-
masters and others will explain the exact length of
each of the two periods mentioned.
See that you are not standing in the gangway;
leave a free passage everywhere about the ship.
SCULLED FROM KIPLING.
A BOER WAR REMINISCENCE.
“And I saw Sydney the same as ever,
With its picnics and brass bands,
My little homestead on the Hunter River,
With its new vines joining hands.
And it all came back to me in a flash—
Quick as a shot through the brain,
With the smell of the wattle by Lichtenburg
Riding in, in the rain.”
: o : .
Does any cine know:—-
The sea new chum who was feeling it badly
after leaving Melbourne, looked too soon for com-
fort and ease. “Thank God,” he said, “it wall soon
be night.” Asked how night was going to help
him, he replied: “Because the ship will be tied up
and stop this infernal heaving.”
EDITORIAL NOTIONS.
All is not bold that titters.

SONG.
Where womanhood and girlhood meet,
She stood upon a day ;
Shower’d down about her tiny feet,
The crimson petals lay.
She’d woven a garland passing fair,
Her golden head to deck;
Now dashed upon the terrace bare,
It lay, rose-red wreck.
Love must be born, so love must die,
And roses have their day,
Those petals whirlwind scattered, cry,
“Love ! love ! while yet we may.”
(The “Log” invites men of musical talent to
set to music the above original lines).


SPORTING SPARKS.
The only horse that is safe to put your shirt on is
a clothes horse.
It is better to have luffed and lost than never
to have sailed at all.
In the South Sea Islands they have rings in
their noses, but in Horstralia we have Noses (the
Bar Yons) in the ring (the Betting Eings).
You may never back a winner,
You may never throw a main;
But you needn’t lose your manhood—
You can always play the game.
"A fellowffeeling makes us wondrous kind, 5 ’
I wonder would the poet change his mind
If in a London crowd he chanced to find
A fellow feeling in his coat behind.
BOXING ITEM.
The training of Private—-now /'Lieut.” —
Stubbs for the boxing battles proceeds apace.
Daily his admirers rub his "legs down with Sarto,,
and enable him to get a firm footing on the deck
when sparring, with powdered ginger nuts. He is
also being doctored inside and out with other
magical mixtures. It is recognised aboard the
ship that he is a star artiste, and should enter the
ring as fit as a Melbourne Cup winner.
CRACKS AT CRICKET.
In the cricket match, 36th v. 34th, the former
‘‘spiffHeated” the 34th by 35 runs.to 9. Corporal
Mclntosh wears the tin halo of glory as a result.
He knocked up 23 runs for the 36th, and carried out
hi 9 bat in a blaze of glory. , Mac., by the way, is
a Boer War warrior of renown, and a.cornet player
of prominence. He can play any musical instru-
ment, ever invented, but is particularly effective on
the flute at the mess-table.
■ A man of many parts by gosh,
Is canny Corporal Mclntosh.
NUISANCE COLUMN.
There are many excellent pianists aboard, but one,
at least, requires being waited upon by a deputation
with an axe. He is a champion at turning out dis-
cords. He also has the hide of ptersdactyl in re-
fusing to cease piano-punching, even when counted
out by his pals. He almost sent the sergeants mad
and filled their souls with fury as they were dawd-
ling over the nuts and wine in the mess t’other even-
mg. A piano can ; become a fearful instrument of
torture beneath some people’s fingers. We beg and
pray of this dreadful person to desist.
