PREFACE.
In bringing the First Volume of the Colonial Literary Journal to a close, the
Editor deems no apology requisite for giving some account to his readers of the
progress of the Work.
For the satisfactory measure of support which has been accorded to his labours,
he desires to express his sincere thanks, and to state that he has reason to trust,
as the work (together with the extreme lowness of its price) becomes more known,
the number of subscribers will likewise proportionately increase.
The present number of subscribers to the Colonial Literary Journal is not
now less than five hundred; and the Editor takes this opportunity of suggesting to
those of them who approve of the nature of the Work, that it is in their power
to render much assistance, by recommending it to the favourable notice of their
friends and acquaintance.
One portion of the expectations held out at the commencement of the pub-
lication, which has not been accomplished, perhaps demands some explanation.
Allusion is made to the promised discussion of the various aspects of colonial
politics. In accordance with the expressed wishes of many contributors, the literary
portion of the paper has been allowed to preponderate, and it was thought fit to
abstain from the field of controversy, as tending to prevent the pages of the Colonial
Literary Journal from presenting a ground common to all parties, on which all
might meet in pleasing harmony. The necessity of not intentionally lessening the
number of subscribers—limited, compared to the low price of the Work—also
suggested this course. The plan adopted, therefore, of devoting the greater part
of its pages to general literature, in accordance with its title, will also account for
the scanty abstracts afforded of British, foreign, and domestic intelligence. The
Editor has reason, however, to hope that not one error of the slightest importance
can be pointed out, and ventures to promise that, for the future, the literary
character of the Work shall progressively improve.


The Editor is bound to acknowledge, with gratitude, the kindness with
which a considerable number of individuals have rendered him assistance. Many
respectable contributors have, from its commencement, signified their approval of,
and interest in, the Colonial Literary Journal, by furnishing essays, scientific
and miscellaneous articles, to its pages. Where all have come forward with a good
will and constancy so equal and laudable, it would be invidious to distinguish.
It has been the Editor’s duty occasionally to decline the productions of his
correspondents, as being unsuited to the character of the publication under his
care . he trusts that, in such instances, his excuse has always been allowed, and the
honesty of his motives admitted.
The Editor will only add, that he is encouraged, by past success, to solicit the
yet more vigorous exertions of his literary contributors; and, as the Colonial
Literary Journal is the rival of no other Work, as its plan materially differs from
that of any other colonial publication, and the expression of particular political
sentiments is avoided in its pages, the Editor feels that he can safely venture to
invite the co-operation and support of all portions of the community.
