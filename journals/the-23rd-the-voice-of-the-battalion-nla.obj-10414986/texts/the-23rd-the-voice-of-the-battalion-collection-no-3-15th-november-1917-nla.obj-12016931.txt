THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION
No. 3. NOVEMBER 15, 1917. Price, Twopence.
CARRYING ON.
" Here we are, here we are, here we
-tare again, printing the third, of the old
23rd," whether in shine or rain." Yes,
we're coming on, and we're gaining honor
?forgive the pun.?Not Crowned Heads
as yet, but heads of all other kinds have
complimented us, and we feel just a little
proud. Without being bombastic, well
not even Fritz has disturbed us. The
boys appreciate it, and we appreciate
their appreciation so " Let's all be
Jubilant." The last issue had to be
duplicated, so great was the demand for
copies, so who knows to what fame we
will aspire. Give us your assistance.
Contribute as well and as often as you
can, and the Colonel, the Editor, the
"Devil," and all the satellites will smile,
arid you, and yours will smile also. "The
Voice of the Battalion " has got to be-
come a great loud one, that can 're heard
right from muddy France to sunny Aus-
tralia. Help its lung power, help, help >
even better than you have done, and a
magnificent success will be yours?and
ours?Sure.
AN AIR RAID.
9. ?
The wind has dropped?gone the rain,
The crescent moon shines once again,
Now comes a plane-?the direful Hun?
Ushered in with smack of gun ;
He drops a bomb with fearful Bump
Near(?) an ammunition dump :
Smack it goes ; we curse our foes
And murmerloud and shiver.
* * ?
A fleecy cloud comes drifting by,
The Hun dives straight behind it,
And anti-aircraft bark in vain.
The gunners cannot find it.
Machine guns start to stitch the air
With silver bullets sewing,
Bombs fly around in airnless flight,
The pandemonium's growing.
Searchlights grope across the sky,
Their long white fingers stealing;
For stealthy Huns amid the clouds
At midnight come a-stealing:
The shrapnel splashes in the night,,
Nosecaps are whining?falling ;
The air is filled with crunch and crash
The horror is appalling.
� * *
Then silence reigns round once again.
Save for the Hun plane droning,
And far away in the still clear night
A stricken mule lies moaning.
?-F. Crossley, 'Anzac Coves,' late 23r.


CORRESPONDENCE.
Lieut.-Col. Brazenor has received the
following interesting letter from Lieut.-
Col. G. H. Knox, Commandant No. 1
Depot, A.1.F., Sutton Veny, Wilts., and
kindly made it available for publication :
" My dear Colonel,
" Thank you very much indeed for
your letter of the 19th Nov. It was in-
deed good of you to write giving me so
much information about the battalion.
It has been splendid the work they have
done in the recent stunts.
" The newspaper, I hope, will be a
very great success, and I have read it
with the greatest interest. General
Gellibrand was speaking to me about it
yesterday, and he thinks it shows fine
enterprise to think that you can publish
a paper like this so close to the line.
The record of original officers is parti-
cularly good ; it certainly put me right
/m a" number of points which I had
forgotten.
" In regard to your suggestion that I
write up the original history of the bat-
talion, rest assured that I will gei on
with this as time permits. One incident
that I feel sure will, in the future, be of
great historic interest, is the retirement
from Ga'llipoli, which wo played a fairly
prominent part in. I have often meant
to write -out the accurate details of the
events that led up to this, as well as, the
incidents of the night of the 19th Dec.,
1915. I have still got the Divisional,
Brigade and Battalion Orders covering
the operation, but unfortunately sent
these home to my trustees about a year ,
ago for safekeeping.
"You will also remember our first big
-bombardment on the 29th Nov., 1915,
when so many men of the 23rd and 24th
battalions fell at Lone Pine. It will be
my privilege to refer to them year by
year in the 'ln Memoriam ' columns of
the ' Argus' and ' Age ' on that date.
" I want to congratulate you very much
on being in temporary command of the
Brigade, and you know that should this
.be an augury of promotion for you, none
wishes you more success than I do. It
is given to some of us tot stick in this
country, for others to cafry on as you
May every possible success and
good luck follow you, which your splen-
did service in the past undoubtedly
warrants.
" I have been seeing quite a lot of
General Gellibrand. He very often re-
fers to the old Brigade. Yesterday he
spent the afternoon with me. Colonel
Watson is in command of the Overseas
Training Brigade, and is his usual self.
It was very kind of you to refer to my
brother, Major W. Knox's, death. It was
certainly a great shock to all. The
latest is that my other brother has lost
his leg, and is now in a London hospital.
" Please accept my kindest regards
and all good luck.
Sincerely yours,.
24.10.17. G. H. KNOX."

A German officer (who was taken

'Yes, but you came

A dug-out at the

That we acknowledge a gracious compli-
ment from Lady Dunleath, of-Baliywater
Park, Baliywater, co. Downs, who says--"
" Your paper is most interesting,, and I
have read every word of it."
That our Beer Emma had a wonderful
escape the other day. A pool of mud
fortunately broke a fall from his steed.
Better a crown of mud than a broken
neck.
That Capt. Hinchcliffe is to he thrice
congratulated. First on winning the
Military Cross by his excellent work and
leadership in the recent stunt. Secondly,
on his promotion to three pips, and
thirdly?a little bird whispers it-he is a
proud father of a bouncing boy, whom he
has never seen.
That our present subterranean resi-
dence is recognised by some who were
with the battalion twelve months ago.
It is not a bad house either, except for
the water, the mud, the chats, the bad
air, not to mention the bad language. It
is well to be an optimist.

ing a Saturday half-holiday smile, two
red tabs on his tunic, and-well in the
background-a battalion en route from

for this beautiful sunset effect ? Name

ing." Artist unknown.
Our old Brigadier is once more on the
war path. After filling a most important
post in England for four months, Brig.
General J. Geliibrand has taken over
command of the Brigade. His. record
with ours was long and continuous and
his guidance through many a stiff propo-
sition in France earned for him the ad-
miration and respect of all ranks. The
lucky Brigade.is to be envied in secur-
ing-one, of-the A.l.F.'s best commanders.
We.hear from a returned Bliglityite
that Lieut. G. McLaren is booked for a
passage to the Southern Cross, as his
head wound has proved more serious
than was at first anticipated,. -
The" " Anzac Coves " were honored by
a visit from our General, Sir Wm. Bird-,
wood, and staff one evening last week.
The Coves were in merry form, and pro-
duced gems of the choicest from their ex-
tensive repertoire. The distinguished
visitors' appreciation of each item was
shown in no uncertain manner. Our
"guiding star" was accorded a hearty
reception 'by the boys on his arrival at
the show.
REGRETS.
; On behalf, of the Battalion we extend
our sincerest sympathy to Lieut. Col.
Knox in his du'al spprow, the loss of one
brother, Major W. Knox, and another
brother, who has lost a leg.
All ranks mourn the death of Lieut.
E. E. Eitelberg, a sterling soldier who
came away with the 22nd and worked
his way up to commissioned rank. Our
heartfelt sympathy goes out to his widow
living in England.
HOSPITAL NOTES.
Pte. Zarth may yet reach Austral's shore
* -Pte. Jack Pearson has flitted Blighty-
wards. ? .??
Corp.. "Coon" Johnson is keeping
cheery. He is in Blighty, but finds diffi-
culty in partaking of food.
We will be glad to hear how comrades
are progressing in hospital or convales-
cent camps, and open this column for
such information. Give any items to
your Q.M. or hand in to the Editor.
Those absent from us can avail them-
selves of the postal facilities and for-
ward to us by mail.

AUSTRALIAN CABLES.
What, we may expect in the future :
At the advanced age of 94, Major
Kumagutzer, the last of the " Original
Anzacs," who, as a youth of 17, enlisted
in the year 1914, has been killed in action
while leading his men in an attack by
the Huns, against Marseilles.
Another aboriginal rising is reported
from Queensland. The Bullenbeefery
tribe is heading the revolt, which is
expected to last for a few years. The
natives are said to be equipped with
22in. and other large gunr, in addition to
petrifying gas, electric death currents,
and other fruits. Anzacs willing to serve
at home send their names to the Editor.
On Sunday last many Hun planes
were observed over Sydney harbour,
evidently mistaking it for a shell hole.
They then attempted to bomb the city,
but without material result. The Gothas
then proceeded to drop bombs on Mel-
bourne without effect, owing to Percy
Brunton and his peanut cart obstructing
observation.
LIMERICK COMPETITION.
FIRST PRIZE, TWENTY FRANCS.
SECOND PRIZE, FIVE FRANCS.
In order to enhance interest in the
Battalion newspaper, it has been decided
to institute a Limerick Competition.
The above piizes will be awarded for
those considered to be two best attempts
for the best five 'lines sent in, commenc-
ing with the following lino :
" A bloodthirsty brute called the
Kaiser."
The Competition is .open to every in-
dividual in the Battalion, and the under-
mentioned conditions must be observed:
The Limerick must not contain more
than five lines.
No signatures will be attached to the
Limerick, which must be forwarded in a
sealed envelope, addressed to the Editor.
The' C.O. has consented to act as
judge, and the winning contributions
will be published in the next issue.
Entries close on 2oth November.
EXAMPLES.
A bloodthirsty brute called the Kaiser, .
Old England, he thought to surprise her,
But the bull dog awoke
And grasped at the throat
Of the tyrant who sought to chastise her.
A bloodthirsty brute called the Kaiser,
Got stoushed on the Somme and the Yser
And long, long before
This fourth year is o'er
He'll wake up much sadder?but wiser.

TOLD BY THE GRAZIER
A certain man, wishing to economise
in poultry keeping because of the war,
put one third sawdust in his poultry
mash. He had a friend who thought he
would go one better, so he made his
poultry mash entirely of sawdust, the
result was that every chicken was hat-
ched with a wooden leg, except one and
it was a woodpecker.
It occurred on the Somme. A Billjim
new to traffic control, received instruc-
tions to divert traffic along another road
This did not suit a particularly famous
British regiment, and the C.0., after ex-
postulating, wound up with "but don't
you know we are the Guards." Quick
came the reply, " I don't care if you're
the blanky engine drivers ; you can't go
this way." They did'nt.
Lieut. Wernher, the millionaire son of
the great South American mining n ag-
nate, has been killed in action. He was
19 years of age, and a legal technicality
has arisen in regard to his will.?'Vide
Press.
"He fought with our Millions against
Millions of Huns,
And surrendered his life to their guns,
And yet for the Millions he leaves
behind,
A sordid wealth-war has begun.
During the last stunt an English
officer turned up at Brigade with two
Lewis guns. He asked where Y street
was, and directed to our Div. Head-
quarters. He put his men under cover,
and left the guns on the duckfcoards. On
returning he was surprised to find, the
machine guns gone. A Staff-Captain
will probably soon figure in an inquiry
as to why two Lewis guns we re lost (?) in
action.

ENTENTE CORDIAL."
*s?
� It was on the Somme, and we were
out for our first real spell from the
trenches, after a heart-breaking exper-
ience of many months during the sever-
est winter for forty years. However, the
snow had given place to smiling spring,
with its sunshine, its green trees, the
birds?the time when a young man's
fancy turns to sublime thoughts, and this
in one of the prettiest parts of the north-
ern coi niryside.
He was just the gayest, most carefree
soldier that ever donned the uniform of
the- King. Not handsome of face, but
with a manner and personality which
won for him the esteem of his superiors,
and the affection of his brothers in arms?
a sport, a soldier, and a true comrade.
Neither the rigor of the winter, or the
trials of the trenches, had any effect on
his sunny disposition, and he was a
great favorite in the battalion.
She was a petite little thing, the mod- '
est fille of a more modest pere and mere.
Atypical village'maiden, unspoiled by
contact with the large cities of the once
pleasure-loving people of France. She
had ne'er a thought for ought else but
the pigs, the cows, the beet fields and the
home garden, until this bright-faced
Anzac came into her existence. A
cheerful disposition enabled her to for-
get her only sorrow?two brothers taken
as toll in this great war. They met in
the most prosaic way, just in the course of
trading for those luxuries in billets,
dainties rare in a soldier's life?the coffee,
the eggs, the milk, the fruit?purchased
while back from the firing line.
He was just a little interested in bier
and her pleasant ways, and she in his
frankness, and a natural courtesy for her
and hers, so much in contrast to the
manner of many of his comrades. A
friendship grew up between them. His
visits to her mother's improvised cafe
became as regular as the daily reveille,
and should duty or other causes prevent
his appearance, the girl's customary
cheerful smile would soon disappear.
Not a word of love-making such as we
read of to-day, but an unconscious i "aw-
ing together that as time wei, m ip-
ened into a deeper feeling.
� # *
It is nearing the end of our relaxation,
and vague whispers of an early move for
ward soon become facts. In a day or
so the battalion receives marching orders.
'Tis the eve of departure, and closing
time at the Cafe. Gocd'byes are said,
and in manner subdued the two find time
for a moment's farewell. With a linger-
ing hand-squeeze she whispers?" Au
Revoir, Sandy, and will you sometimes,
think of Marie.,' " I will, always, ma
cherie," and just one kiss?their compact
sealed. - ?
* * �
In the fall of the year the vicissitudes
of war bring us badk to our haunts of
spring time, and a merciful Government
grants us another rest. Prospects are
bright, for a break in the war cloud shows
signs of peace. Old acquaintances are
renewed, and the two meet again. Time
finds them faithful to their springtime
promise, and in the twilight of an autumn
evening it is renewed.
" I have never forgotten you, Marie,
Will you marry me soon?"
" Apres le guerre," she foudly replies.
