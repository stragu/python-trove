THE VOICE OF THE
No. 5. DECEMBER 15, 1917. Price, Twopence.
THE WEEKLY WHIRLIGIG.
-?+
We are now in December and if you'll
remember, last year the cold was in-
tense: but this year you'll agree its
just N.T.8., for the winter has hardly
commenced. As so far goes the war,
again do we score, this time near Cam-
brai on the West; our tanks did the
test, the boys took the rest, and as the
dawmbroke in the morning, old Tommy
with might, carried on the good fight,
till soon in the village was storming:
the poor refugees now sleep quite at
ease, with dreams of to home soon re-
turning. The Russians propose the
Allies to " bull-dose " with a patched-up
peace of some kind, but the Leninite
crew, at best a mere few, have not upset
our peace of mind, for the more they
dissemble the more we'll assemble on the
fronts for the fight for mankind.
The musical stunt, with A Coy. in
front, proved quite a tres bon innovation,
for the items they gave, both humorous
and grave, met with everyone's keen
approbation ; may B, C and Don soon
folio** with song to drive away some
melancholy, and just, if you please,
carry right on with these nights of pleas-
ure, so jolly. The Battalion day's sport
?as really it ought?was quire up to our
expectation, for each event tries, for
medal or prize, contested with keen
animation. Each officer there did his
full share, and the band played its part
in the game, so we do reason that through
the cold season we'll have many sports
meetings the same.
FROM A FALLEN COMRADE.
+
That I am slain demands no bitter tears;
I tasted death, and straight the warmth
of life
Runs coursing thro' my viens, and only
bears
A memory of the pain and earthly strife.
Oh! comrade, who in sorrow mourns
awhile ,
Know this of me ; beneath another sun,
The sun of God's full-welcome, praising
smile,
I rest in peace, in knowledge life is won.
Friend of my hardships, dangers, glow-
ing hours,
I feared that death would light love's
funeral pyre,
Itestead love burns with unaccustomed
power,
And from dead ashes, flames to vivid
fire.
I gave my life, and life came back to me
Flushed with a strange and everlasting
beauty.
STRIKE FIGURES.
+
In 1914 there were 337 labor disputes
in the Commonwealth, mvolring a total
of 71,049 workers. 1915 saw an increase
to 358, involving 81,292 toilers. In 1916
the barometer again rose, 508 being the
number of disputes, rendering 170,683
persons workless. Figures for 1917 are
not yet available.


COMPANY SPORTS.
During the past two weeks each of the
five companies have engaged in prelim-
inary sports, with the admirable idea of
choosing the best men to represent them
in the battalion events which followed,
and later to take part in the Brigade
function. Results are as follows :

oon with 14 points.

A COMPANY'S CONCERT.
The concert organised by A Coy?the
first for many months?was a success
musically, and at the same time provided
another link in the social chain being
forged in the battalion. The 23rd talent
was supplemented by items from mem-
bers of other units-also a praiseworthy
idea, and, under the chairmanship of
Capt. Moss, all "went merry as a mar-
riage bell." The C.O. and representative
officers from each coy. were present, and
Lieut Findlay capably managed the show.
The band was responsible for the open-
ing blow, well delivered, then Pte W.
Littleton gave " My Old Shako," in good
voice, but a little nervous. " Absent," by
Pte Norm. Shepherd Twenty-second Bn.
was well received. Cpl. Romaine told of
the angularities, etc. of his " Boney
Mary" in good humor, and his encore
sketch got the boys completely. Pte
Jones, of the Twenty-first, added a good
item, and Pte Trewartha described voc-
ally " The trail that leads to Home,"
while Lieut Love admitted being fas-
cinated by "Two Eyes of Grey." A Yid-
dish sketch by Sgt McKenzie and Pte
Penny, of the Twenty-second M.G.
Coy., entitled "Shop," illustrated the
difficulty of trying to make love and sell
comestibles at the same time. Pte White
had a fair passage along the " Swanee
River," and the audience was well in the
swim too. Pte Street, Twenty-first Bn.,
humorously asked "Wasn't it a silly
Thing," and was recalled for it. Pte
Robertson sang to beat the band in ' A
perfect Day"; they finished with honors
even. Cp Radford 24th, contributed "The
Deathless Army," and Cp. McDonald, of
the same unit, told some breezy Scotch
stories. " Mother Machree" by Pte
Crabtree Twenty-fourth, was sung perfec-
tly, and Pte L. Herz Twenty-second, fin-
ished the bill with an encore item to
"The Volunteer Organist. Pte Johnson,
C Co., "pianoed" for the singers, and all
were duly thanked atihe conclusion.

due to the officers, who contributed
donations to the prize fund, which, in
addition to the amount allotted to H.Q.,
made it possible to give three medals or
trophies in each event.
FOOTBALL NOTES. .
+- ?
The battalion team is now in full swing!
with the makings of a fine combination,
which with,a little more practice should
give a good account of itself against an;
other. A great drawback to the team
was the loss of Lieut. Kirkwood, who in"
jured himself in the Battalion sports.
Selection has been difficult, as we want to
obtain the best talent in the unit. We have
already played two matches and won both
Before this issue we will have played our
final for the Brigade Cup.
Our first match was against the 2nd
Pioneers. It was not a good display, as
most of our team had not played together
before. Individual efforts won the game
for us. System was lacking.and this, with
team work and combination is what we
want, and what we must have in future.
Kew Ming showed to advantage in the
centre: McKenzie wing. Doak, Robin-
son, Ingles, Carroll, and O'Brien all
played well. Young Thompson kicked
three goals. Scores?Twenty-third, 9.11
(65 points); Pioneers, 4.5 (29 points.)
On the sth inst. we played the Twenty
Seco id for the Brigade Cup. After.an
exciting game we won by one point.
Alterations in the team were made which
still can be improved upon. The credit
of this game rests with our back line.
The scores were sgls Bbds to sgis 7bds.
Murchison played a great game in the
ruck. The backs were Jack Garden,
Grolis, O'Brien and Carroll, Davis, in
goal, showed judgment and dash. Centre
play was marred by the tricky ground
and light ball. Macqueen shaped fair for
the first run, and Ingles is improving,
and with a little more dash should be a
tower of strength half-forward. Sgt
Osborne has stripped once again, and
although he has not played for a long
time, should be helpful following. There
are others whose claims are >eing con-
sidered, and we feel sure of putting up a
good display against the Twenty-Fourth
Battalion in :the Final. (The result of
the match appears on another page.)

BATTALION SPORTS.
O.i Decemper Ist the Battalion sports
diy eventuated, and was just a repetition
of the success in the company events.
Competitions were equally keen all
round. A company were prominent in
most items and finished winning the Bat-
talion Cup. The Tug went to C company
after some grand pulling. Lieut. Kirk-
wood had the misfortune to strain a
muscle when he appeared an easy win-
ner in the Hurdle race. Lc Cpl McMil-
lan caught the cross-country event in
18 and a half, while Cpl Hutchison pro-
ved a stayer and sprinter both, for he an-
nexed the 440 yds and 100 too. The Wheel-
barrow Race provided amusement, but
the " fun of the fair " was the Officers'
Mule Race, in which the stubborn quad-
rapeds were responsible for some mirth-
provoking falls. The band helped in a
merry day, and so did the Y.M. with
hot tea. The judges were Lt.-Col Brazenor
and Cpt. Beith; committee, Capt. Moss,
Lts Hepburn and Jenkins; stewards,
Lts Roxburgh and Findlay ; starter, Lt.
Weir; secretary, Lt Anderson; recorder,
Lt Short. Results:?

THE LAST REQUEST.
The Lewis Gunner raised his head,
And viewed around the shambles spread.
The Bearers hastened to his aid,
But with these words their course he
stayed:
" The Pistol Grip's stuck in my back,
Beneath my ribs you'll find the rack ;
Cut off my boots and you'll find complete
The Pinion pieces in my feet.
My liver holds some thirty springs,
Extractors, screws, and other things,
Collect them all; spare me no pain,
Then assemble the gun again."?M.W.
YEARS HENCE
From a recent report of an Archael-
ogical Research Committee
Recent excavations in Northern France
have resulted in a most interesting dis-
covery.
At a depth of ninety feet a relic was
unearthed, resembling a shepherd's crook
of the Stone age. But Professor Shrewed,
to whom it was submitted, has now
classified it as belonging to. a much later
period?the High Explosive age-and
places it as a stick used by the Anzacs,
a savage horde who overran Europe
about 1917 A.D., in strange rites called
Hockey or Shinty matches.
These rites were usually performed in
a bloodthirsty manner, and it will be
noted that this ghastly relic commemor-
ates thfem fittingly in a number of notches
carved on the handle, each of which
doubtless marks an opponent success-
fully Hockeyed or vanquished.
The 23rd tribe were the chief expon-
ents of this strange and terrible custom,
and a subdivision of the same tribe called
the Acs supplied the Hereditary High-
Priests.

SIXTH BRIGADE SPORTS.
As will be seen on reference to previous
pages, sports have been the order of the
day for the past two or three weeks, and
reached the culminating point on the Bth
inst,. when the big Brigade meeting at-
tracted the attention and interest of all.
The meeting was undoubtedly as great
a success as could be imagined. The
day was fair and the track in good con-
dition, thanks to the excellent prepara-
tion. The contests between representa-
tives of each battalion wore keen indeed.
Of course the greatest interest was
centred in the three-mile cross country
event, and this went to the 23rd Battalion
after a fine run. The " crack " of the
red and brown diamond, Cpl. McMillan,
led the field until almost at the tape,
when he was just 'pipped' by S.M. Sproule
of the 21st, for the gold medal honor.
The highest aggregate number of points,
which entitl ed the holders to the silver
cup presented, was obtained by our unit
as the result of annexing the principal
items. Following are the events won
by this battalion :
100yds.?Cpl. Hutchison, 1.
440yds.?Sgt Phillips, 1; Cpl Hutchi-
son, 2.
High Jump?Not decided yet. Ptes
Appleyard and Holman in final.
Half-mile?Sgt Phillips, 1.
Relay Race?Sgts McDonald, Phillips,
Sew Ming, Cpl Hutchison, L-cpl Harrop.
Ptes Higgins, McKenzia, Rimes.
Cross Country Sgt Moodie, L-cpl
McMillan, Ptes Grohs, Rimes, McClure,
Hoban, Higgs, Gilvear, Boothroyd,
Withers.
The effect of the decision to make
sports part of the daily battalion routine
has been highly encouraging to those in
command. The beys have appreciated
this pleasant method of becoming fit
by wholeheartedly inc. Iging in the free
and easy method of raining, welcom-
ing it in a pronounced manner.
VALEDICTORY.
Oa a recent date Capt, Norman, of the
6th Brigade Staff was accorded a fitting
farewell on the eve of his departure to
take up the position of Brigade Major
to General Gellibrand. The function
was attended by Divisional and Brigade
officers, and officers from different bat-
talions. Speeches, expressing their good
wishes, were made by Cols. Brazenor,
Wiltshire, Duggan, James, and others.
Captain Norman carries a record for good
.work in the A.1.F., and has been associ-
ated with the 6th Brigade since
Gallipoli.
THE LIMERICK COMPETITION,
Tho Limerick competition closed on
December 10th, and we regret to state the
number of verses received was under a
dozen. The C.O. has decided to award
one prize, 20 Francs to the writer of the
following five lines
A bloodthirsty bruto called tho Kaiser,
Of foul crimes an-arch-fiend deviser,
In his madness made war
'Gainst Bight, Truth, and Law-
Till the world lias become his despiser.
Y.M.C.A. GIFT.
A suitable and seasonable gift was
made to each and every member of the
battalion on Tuesday last, when they
became the recipients, through tho
Y.M.C.A of handsome writing tablets
and wallets combined. These Xraas
souvenirs are nicely bound in leather,
and will surely be valued as lasting-
mementoes of the war.
This is how a 44th Battalion officer ex"
pressed his admiration of our newspaper
-"Well, by Gad, this is the toughest
thing I've seen."

OUR VICTORY.
?4. ?J
THE G.O.'s APPRECIATION,
The three-mile race had been run and
the men from all units in the brigade ,
were streaming 6if tire ground as Colonel
Brazenor stood receiving the congrat-
ulations of brother-officers on the victory
of the battalion. "A victory well earn-
ed," was the frequent comment, and the
C.6.'s pleasure was expressed in every
line oi his trim figure.
" Yes," he said, later in the day, as ho
warmed himself contentedly _ at the
bright fire glowing in his cubible, it
has been one of my proudest days since
X came away with the 23rd Battalion.
Indeed, except for those occasions when
I have received praise for our work in
the actual field, I know of no prouder
day. And it was not so much in the fine
individual performances. Those were
excellent, and we have to thank our run-
ners for their fine work. But even better
was the determination shown by every-
one that the battalion should win, even
at the sacrifice "of some individual effort.
That was shown most clearly in the
half-mile, when I saw one of our men
deliberately sacrificing his chance of
victory that another "runner should have
the necessary pace.
1 think that instance typifies the feel-
ing that ran through the whole battalion.
We were out to win the Cup. And it
could be done only in one way. By un-
selfish co-operation between ail striving
for trophies. Nothing pleased me more
than the obvious fact that the battalion
came first, the prizes second. It seemed
to provide a new motto for the battalion
" Victory through Unity."
" And is there any other contributing
factor?"
" Yes," said the Colonel still smiling
happily into the glowing embers. Our
organisation of training from the platoons
through to the companies and up to the
Battalion had a decided influence on our
win. Every man. was brought into close
touch with the races. It was not merely
a few enthusiasts intent on a common
sport. Bur each man through his platoon
had been interested in each particular
event. He had tried, or seen a section
comrade try to win the 440,880, or three
mile. And so. when the companies con-
tasted for the Battalion cup on December
Ist the excitement pervading every Con-
test was extraordinarily keen. And
when the Brigade sports came along we
had nearly a thousand men determined
to win that Cup as" though it were an
enemy objective. As C.O- it was my
pleasure to receive the congratulations
on our fine performance. But i wish to
pass those congratulations on first to the
starters who achieved the victory, se-
condly to the officers and N.C.Os, who
assisted in their training, and thirdly to
every man who so keenly determined on
that victory."
" And a word in conclusion," said the
Colonel as he turned to a document just-
brought in by the Adjutant, " the work of
the #ports committee?Capt, Moss, and
Lieuts. Findlay, Weir ana Morrell?was
energetic, enthusiastic and thoroughly
efficient. I can give the members no
greater praise,"
SERGEANTS' DINNER.
The 23rd Sergeants were en fete on ths
night of the Bth Inst., and gave a dinner
to celebrate their stay in this camp.
The mess room was decorated tastefully
for the occasion with bunting represent-
ing the allied nations, and a'numb or of
warrant officers and Sergeants from sis-
ter battalions ana the L.IL Regiment
accepted invitations to be present. After
doing justice to the edibles contained in
a very excellent menu, music and song-
filled in the balance of a most enjoyable
few hours. Serg, "Jack" Phillips was
prominent in the arrangements, and all
lent a helping hand.
December 15. THE TWENTY-THIRD SUPPLEMENT.


OFFICERS' MESS.
The neccessity for going early to
press prevented us from announcing the
change in secretarial duties. Lt. Bastow
was called away to work in another
brigade, and Lt. Anderson has succeeded
him in the job of looking after our mess
interests. As we thanked Lt. Bastow
so we find it necessary to thank our new
secretary. His work is given so unsel-
fishly and willingly that we are apt to
forgsf the irksome nature of its constant
call on time and energy.
Our mess event was the smoke night
on Dec. sth. A large number of visitors
cams along from Brigade and the other
battalions. The room--decorated with
flags of all allied nations and warmed by
a cosy fire?looked inviting and comfort-
ing. The Battalion Press printed a menu
card. There was one for each diner.
By the end of the meal the cards had
been passed round for signature. Evi-
dently more souvenir hunting?and one
safer than searching for shells in the
front line. It must be confessed that our
visitors provided most of the musical
entertainment. Apparently?among the
officers?we don't harbour musical talent
in the battalion.
All who were at Gallipoli will ha
pleased to know that Major Matthew
Baird is now Minister for Education in
Victoria. We trust that his health will
stand the strain ï¿½f his new duties.
We stated that Lt. Cuthbertson was
suffering with a serious throat trouble.
He is returning to Australia, where it is
probable he will undergo an operation.
Our sympathy is with him. His bright,
boyish spirits were a constant pleasure
in our social life and his fine work in the
line has added to ths reputation of the
battalion.
Lieut. Bastow is with a Gas Brigade
in charge of a section in a company of
the R.Es. He mentions with appreci-
ation .the exce;le/it mess. Lieut. Bastow
always had a keen palate.
We wonder how Capt, Dawson likes
this? Just out of hospital for a look
round he met the Brigadier on the sports
ground. " How long haVe you been ill ?"
said the Brigadier kindly. "Thirteen
days, sir," replied the Captain. "Oh,
well, you'll be able to consider that as
your leave," said the Brigadier as he
turned away.
The mess has been improved by the
addition of a wet canteen open strictly
in off parade hours. We hear that one
officer can sometimes be seen working
out tactical platoon exercises in the
evening with glasses for men, They
form fours excellently and stand very
steady.
The breath of scandal has passed on
the battalion. Lieut. Short has been found
corresponding with Lieut. Torode's wife.
And he remains unashamed.
The officers provided all the fun at the
Battalion sports, and the mule race
enabled the rank and file to get a bit of
their own back. Lieut. Roxburgh des-
erved his fine victory. He rMe his beast
as though he and it were one. Capt.
Moss had a most gallant style, but his
mule forgot to gallop until the race was
over. Lieut. Jenkins provided the
sensation of the day with a dive off his
animal's back. It was most artistically
done?a full header. Capt. Hinchliffe
imitated the renowned John Gilpin,
riding the distance round his beauty's
neck. Indeed there was not an officer
who did not provide a laugh in his en-
deavour to urge an unwilling beast into
a gallop hat would win the race.

' Fï¿½OTBALL FINAL.
?
ANOTHER VICTORY.
The final match for the Brigade Cup
was played on December 12, between the
23rd and 24th Battalions, who had beaten
the 22nd and 21st respectively. The
match had been awaited with the great-
est interest, but among the hundreds
assembled there were few who expected
the 23rd to win. The other side came
on the field with a reputation for consis-
tent vieiory thx; gave their supporter*
every confidence, while there who so
keenly desired the 23rd to win dare not
take even odds on their possible victory.
The weather was fine, but the ground
sticky and heavy.
From the first bounce of the ball a
great surprise fell to the spectators. The
23rd went away with a rattle that was
maintained through every quarter but
the third, when the partisans of the 24th
were assured of victory. The first quar-
ter was an open game of good high
marking and long kicking. For our side
Osborne, Murchison, O'Brien and King
did fine work. When the whistle blew
scores stood at 2.1?1.2.
That was the first surprise. In tl:e
second quarter our men maintained tine: r
good fbrm. It seemed as it, under the
skilful leadership of Phillips, they
played with the greatest vim and dash.
Half forward Robinson scored goals,
playing and marking in beautiful style.
The 24th attacked, but were held. Then
two goals were scored in this quarter
from penalties. The score at half time
was 5.3.---3.?.
The third quartei* belonged to the 24th,
Burge playing a great game for them.
Cameron, Inglis, McKenzie and Garden
did good work for us, could not pre-
vent their opponents from notching three
goals. Barracker J for the 24th felt sure
the game was won, for the scores were
7.11?6.4.
With 13 points behind the 23rd faced
the last quarter with the strongest d -
termination to win that match. Ke
Ming in the centre, Garden, Lt. Ro. -
burgh, Carrol and Grohs-were superb la-
the back line. For a long time we at-.;
tacked but could {only creep up to tne
24th by scoring befiinds, The time wash
almost up, and still we stood two poin{s-
behind. Then a rush occurred, Thg
ball flew down to "the right of the 24th ?
goal. The excitement was tremendous.
Petrie was seen to mark, and with a
beautiful kick scored a goal, and ran
home thh twenty-third by four..points.
The scores were:
Twenty-Third - Bgls 9bds.
Twenty-Fourth - 7gls llbds.
The umpire was Pte Keenahan, 27th
Battalion.
The twenty-third supporters went
delirious with joy. Hats were thrown
in the air, and amid great cheering the
team were carried off the field. That
game will live long in the memories of
all those who witnessed it.

BILL ? ADAMS--ANZAC.
Scene : A buffet, wherein sit an Ar.zac
on leave and an affable old gentleman. .
Affable (lent: Good day; I presume
you are an Anzac on leave from France?
Anzac: Yell.
Affable Gent: I take a great interest
in our Colonial boys, and always like to
get some account of personal experiences
from them. Perhaps you can tell me
something?
Anzac: I'm no blinkin' good at telling
a yarn.
Affable Gent : But surely you can tell
me some little story about yourself while
in the firing line?er?comeandavadrink ?
Anzac: Well, here you are. The first
time I went into the line we had to
"? hop the bags and I was very fright-
ened. We were lined along the trench
with fixed bayonets. Every man was
tense, silent and grim; -shells, fell all
round us, thick and fast. Word came
along-- three minutes to go." I was
very scared, then came " two minutes to
go." I pulled myself together and
tightened my grip on my rifle, then, the
whisper, " one minute, to go," came, I.
was getting ready for the great moment,
when suddenly there was a blinding
1
flash and a tremendous report. I as
flung to the ground, smothered with dirt
and mud, and sick with the reek and
stink of shell fumes, but remembering
my duty I sprang to my feet, grasped sjuy
rifle in a grip of steel, and discovered
with horror that the shell had blown my
bayonet clean off my rifle. There was
no time to replace it, but when word
came, " over you go ! " I scrambled out
of the trench, charged across No Man's
Land. How I. got through the rain of
shells I will never know; comrades fell
all around me ; I sprang into the Hun
line, thrusting, jabbing and slashing the
demoralised Germans. I saw red ; I was
mad;.wbh the lust, for killing! My
bayonet was stained and dripping with
German blood. Dashing along that
trench I picked out a huge Hun. He
showed fight, ar.d came at me with his
bayonet. He made a terrific lunge at
me ; I parried his thrust and plunged my
bayonet into his??-
Affable Gent: Wait a moment, my
friend, w'ait a moment; didn't you dis-
tinctly. say previously that your bayonet
was blown off before you hopped ever ?
Anzac (with withering contempt):
You blanky old blighter, I see its not a
story you want at all; why, you're look-
ing for a blanky a.rjumont l-W.E L.
