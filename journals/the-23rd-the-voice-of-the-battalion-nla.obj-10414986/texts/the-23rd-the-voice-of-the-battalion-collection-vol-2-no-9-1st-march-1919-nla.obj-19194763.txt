Hostilities Cease.
NOV. IMh., 1:2 a.m.
Word has just been received by the
-0.0., Major Beith that hostilities
ceased to-day.
The following is a copy of the message
received by the unit:
TO ALL BATTALIONS.
From Marshall Foch to Commander-in-
Chief.?Hostilities will cease from 11
o?clock (French Ti�ie.) Allied Troops
will not cross the line at that time
until further notice.?
The news, although expected, was re-
ceived with subdued feelings at first, fol-
lowed by cheers after the first shock-
The band\ was formed up by Serg,
Wilson, and played the National Airs of
our own and Allied countries, the first
choice being ? The Marseillaise.?
Vive La France.

Thoughtfulness.
When orders came for those who were
left in the battalion to become merged
into the 22nd Battalion as it were, the in-
formation was not received with any de-
gree of pleasure, and the deepest regret
was expressed at having to leave the com
fortable quarters and bonny Belgian
friends in Nallium s-ITaies, for new and
strange surroundings at Gourdinnes.
The questions were asked ?? What will
the 22nd be like ? What sort of a re-
ception will we get ? ? ? What rotten bil-
ists we?ll have.? Be it said, however, that
the sincere comradeship that has always
existed between the two units was never
more pronounced and never better exem-
plified by the 22nd than when the boys
arrived. The C.0., Col. Wiltshire, had
given instructions that arrangements be
made for the comfort and convenience of
the incoming troops. Immediately, straw
was procured for bods lor the men, a lim-
ber of coal provided, transport put at
oiir disposal in addition to an offer to
instal electric light wherever needed.
Neither officers or men were neglected,
in fact where anything was possible to
make the change more agreeable, in a true
sense of esprit de corps, it was done.
It was thoughtful indeed, and we hasten
to record our appreciation and thanks
to the officers, N.C.O?s ; and men of the
red and purple diamonds in this last phase
of the war, for by such acts are we welded
together as portion of a great nation, to
play our part in the great drama of life,
either in peace or at war. May the two
battalions be associated in many pleasant
doings in the near future.
Caution.
We are now in the last quarter of the
big game we he.ve played for the last four
years, and a little advice in regard to
that high marker ?Flu? is perhaps
timely. This malady seldom misses,
and apparently its germs are in the air,
in the theatres, the cinemas, and else-
where. It is singularly fond of attack-
ing civilians, particularly the younger
generation, but now and again tranfers
its affections to soldiers with dire re-
sults. Therefore tor the sake of those at
home in the land of sun At the first
symptom of the malady?-BEWARE.

Battalion Organisation!.
No. 4. ?MEDICAL.
Before coming to France the writer?s
ideas of the work of the Medical Service
in the field were derived from Boer Wax-
pictures and imagination. The result
was so unlike the x-eal thing that it is
thought an accouxxt of the work may be
of interest.
The room or dug-out in which the
battalion doetor or R.M.O. works is
termed the R. A. P. ?Regimental Aid
Post. To assist him he has a L.-Cpl.
medical orderly and a private, who has
charge of the Maltese Cart. To assist
the M.O. in the supervision of water-
supply and sanitation there are an
N-.C.0. and four nxen for each of the two
departments.
The obvious duties of the M.O. are the
treatment and evacuation of sick and
wounded. In addition he has the
equally important work of acting as ad-
visor to the C.O. on all matters affecting
the health of the troops. This latter
task is rendered easier by the fact that
with the experience of the last few years
most senior officers are themselves keen
experts in the various factors which
raise or lower the health of their men.
The water supply in France and Bel-
gium is always regarded with suspicion.
Water is obtained either from streams
nr wells. In neither case it is . reliable
owing to the drainage from the many
farm houses, and the soakage through
the heavily manured fields, All sources
of water are tested axxd re-tested, and in
accordance with the result of the test
the water is chlorinated before use
whether it is boiled or not. This pro-
cess consists of the addition of bleaching,
powder, with the subsequent liberation
of Chlorine, which purifies the water.
Incidentally it often gives to the water
a strong and unpleasant flavour, which
at no time adds to the enjoyment of
either porridge or tea. As a rule the
water N.C.O. and two of his squad assist
in the work of the R.A.P. as well.
Throughout the advaxxce which com-
menced in August a constant effort was
made to have all sources of water lo-
cated, tested, and labelled as soon after
the capture of a village as possible.
The importance of keeping both rest
billets and trenches in a clean condition
is recognized, and they require regular
and thorough supervision, and in this
xxxatter the M.O. is greatly assisted by
reports furnished by the sanitary N.C.O.
During rapid advances, or where the
front line consists of a series of outposts
such inspectioxx is impracticable, and is
temporarily suspended.
The R.A.P. work varies of course ac-
cording as the battalion is in the line or
at rest. In the latter case the work con-
sists mainly of sick parades, which are
held daily at 8 a.m.
The stock of xnedicine in an R.A.P. is
necessarily limited.
The sick parade bugle call is supposed
to say :
?Come the sick, come the maixxx,
Come you blighters, you?ll all get
the same.?
But it is not as bad as that.


In the line medicine in pill form only
is available, and though various com-
binations of these are possible, the best
known are certainly either a ?No- 9
straight ? or a ? Two of this and one of
that.? If the soldier does not approve of
the particular pill supplied, it is carefully
tucked away under his tongue, and later
is ejected with vehemence. Of course
this long-established custom is attended
with difficulties when the medicine in
question takes the form of castor oil.
When the battalion moves, the whole
of the medical equipment 1 ? 12 stretchers',
splints of various kind, cane baskets or
panniers containing drugs and dressings,
primus stoves, etc., are carried in the
Maltese cart, a two wheeled vehicle
marked with a Red Cross. This cart
when fully loaded is always regarded
with suspicion by the transport officer.
He suspects that a tarpaulin can cover
a multitude of personal belongings
which should?nt be there. He is always
reassured to the contrary, but is never
convinced,
When the battalion moves into the line
the splints, dressings, primus stoves and
other essentials are carried by hand to
the allotted position. If the relief is on
a well known area the two M.O?s
frequently change over many hours .be-
fore the battalions move, generally during
daylight. Otherwise the A.M-C. go with
battalion headquarters in the rear of the
companies, and eventually reach the new
R. A.P. in spite of barb wire, shell holes,
trenches, and flares which seem to in-
tensify the darkness.
The R.A.P. is generally a dug-out in
the side of a trench or a sunken road.
For the sake of the wounded it is made as
safe as circumstances will permit, and its
distance from the front line varies, but
the average is between 500 and 700 yards.
Each company in a battalion has a
squad of four men, who have volunteered
for the work of regimental stretcher
bearers. There are therefore 16 R.S.B.s
in a battalion who have been instructed
in First Aid, and are supplied with First
Aid equipment and stretchers. There is
also a reserve of 16 with the battalion to
fill vacancies or assist as required.
If the battalion is fortunate while in
the line the S.B?s will have an easy time.
On the other hand, when it does occur
the work is both heavy and exposed.
Stretcher cases cannot be carried along
the trenches. It is up and over ail the
way to the R.A.P. Regimental stretcher
bearing requires the exhibition of physical
and moral qualities of a very high standard.
The wounded are divided into walking
wounded and stretcher cases. The latter
are carried to the R.A.P., where, if
necessary, the wound is cleared, dressings
and splints applied, and the patient is
transferred to another stretcher, where Ira
lies between blankets. He is then carried
back by relays of Field Ambulance bear-
ers to the motor-loading post, and thence
by car back to the A.D,S. (Advanced
Dressing Station.) ?
A. walking wounded case generally ar-
rives with a field dressing already applied
Often this does not need to be changed,
and he is directed or accompanied on his
way back to the A.D.S.
It is a mistake to think that all
wounded men receive sympathy. Far
from it, A small percentage are serious
cases, but the remainder are classified as
? Good Blighties,?? and the lucky ? pos-
sessor of a Good Blighty receives the
congratulations of his mates.
Sick parades are not held while in
the line. Men who require attention
come to the- R.A.P. during the night;
Hot coffee or cocoa is generally


available at the R.A.P., and is invaluable.
Professionally the work at an E.A.P.
is always unsatisfactory to a doctor.
Rarely, if ever, does he see any result
from his work with the wounded. His
main object is to get the patient out and
away in the shortest possible time. On
the other hand the life with a battalion
both in and out of the line has attractions
hard ,to express in words, but none the
less real.
It is good to have had the experience.
M.O.
A Greeting,
The following is a copy of a letter
received by one of the boys from a citi-
zen ot Nalinnes-Haies, with whom he
had become very friendly. As will be
seen it makes characteristic reference to
the pleasures incidental to a soldier?s
life, including one of the several Xmas
dinners given in the battalion:
Monsieur Jack ?
Retour Australia tres bon.
Beacoup zig-zag. Bon diner Brasserie.
Hors d?Oeuvre.
Rosbif Pore. Rostbif Cochon.
Plum Pudding. Plum Cakes.
Yin Blanc.
Tabac, Cigarettes, Allumettes, Bougies.

coup pleurer.
Finis promenade dans le hois. Cane
fait rien. C?est la guerre.

Tres bon.
Finis correspondence. Bonsoir.

Proof Positive.
?Newspapers, nowadays, are a swindle,?
said the man who liked a lot for his money.
?Everything in I hem is condensed, cut
down almost to nothing. They are not
worth buying.?
? 1 differ, said another member of the
company. A modern newspaper, to my
mind, is a marvel of production. Why !
for a mere coin you get something for all
classes of the community, the politician,
the sportsman, the financier, the theatre-
goer, the literary man, all are catered for.
There?s something in it for everybody,
and everything in it interests somebody.?
?Then, who does this interest ?? asked
the first speaker, pointing to the stop-press
column, which happened to be blank.
?Oh ! That,? replied the other, ?proves
my argument ; it?s for those who can?t
read.?
Football.
A team representing the 6th Brigade
met a team from the 7th one day during
the week, and were defeated by 13.6 to
4.7. Up to the last quarter our team
held their own. but during the final 20
minutes the pleasure s of the past month
or two told their tale with the result as
above shown.
From a reliable source we glean the
information that the furphy that a man
on embarkation leave in England is only
allowed' to draw �4 is incorrect. This
apparently only applies to those who
have a debit in their pay book, and evi-
dently those in credit are allowed to draw
according'to their rank.


Transport Ball.
A unique incident in the history of the
battalion was a little dance organised by
Lieut. R- Hume, and carried out success-
fully by those attached to the 23rd Trans-
port. The function took place in the
schoolroom at JSfalinnes-Haies, and so
great was the enthusiasm, that eventu'
ally it developed into a plain and fancy
dress affair. Needless to state the village
folk readily accepted invitations to be
present, and for about five hours all went
merry as a marriage bell to the music
of Mile. Vonderbost (violin) and Pte.
Webb (piano), with Ptes. M. McKenzie
and A. May in charge of the dances.
Refreshments, such as sandwiches,
biscuits, and cocoa were handed round
about 10 p.m,, and when home going ar-
rived it was mutually agreed that the
evening was ? good-oh ? indeed.
Following is a list of those who ap-
peared in fancy dress
Serg. R. Clues, -l Toreador.?
Serg. Muggeridge, ? French Gentle-
man.?
Cpl. Hamstead, Madamoiselle.?
Pte. Dowden, ? Perriott.?

Our Cinema.
One of the most interesting and enjoy-
able entertainments instituted in the
A.I.F. is the 6th Brigade Cinema. An
innovation is the introduction ol Aus-
tralian subjects in Australian hlms por-
traying events in our own country, so that
although we are far from home such hap-
penings as the A.J.C. and Y.R.C. Spring
Meetings are brought near to us. Thu
show was a fixture in the Ecole Catho-
lique, Marcinelle, but unfortunately the
precautions taken against influenza have
necessitated its closing down temporarily.
The 22nd and 24th battalion bands pro-
vide the music, which is always appropi-
ate. The pictures are well projected, and
Sergt. Ramsdale (in charge), Ptes. Var-
coe, Fox, and Pearraan are to be compli-
mented on their excellent management.
