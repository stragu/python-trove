� GENERALITIES.
This issue is not as large as usual
on account of the very heavy work en-
tailed in the production of the " Annual,
and the movements of the Battalion.
Capt. A. .T. Noall has heen operated
on, at the Caultield Military _ Hospital.
It will be some considerable time before
he will he able to leave.
A sincere friendship has grown be-
tween our Battalion and the adjacent
Tank Unit. Lieut. Lou Maddrell has
had something to do with it? and the
football matches.
The late M.0., otherwise Capt. A. J,
Orr, is now resplendant in all the brass-
work of D.A.C. Brilliancy is said to be
a habit with that Unit,
The "Pip-Ess" is back from Blighty
0.K., and reports that the Comforts
Fund' H.Q. is a place of great size and
importance there. Major I. Henley and
Capt. Cridland arc the enthusiastic offi-
cers in charge.
The endeavors of Sgt. Kamsdale as a
manager and performer in introducing the
entertainments to break the monotony _oi
the long evenings are apparently heartily
appreciated by those who have attended
the series preseuted at our last billeting
place. O. Johnson, Rix, Trewartha.
Thompson, Mr, Carter, Donnelly, of the
Y M.C.A., and Lieut. Holland deserve
tire thanks of all for their splendid efforts.
That there is talent in the Battalion is
without question, although it be of modest
pretensions* and with a manager as at
present a combination could be formed of
at least, very fair merit.
Colonel Brazenor, although convalescing
is not as well as ho might be. His return
shortly, however, is not unlikely.
Col. McKenzie, who has been enjoying
leave in Paris, has returned to duty.
One of the invalids in hospital writes?
"l met Major Bladen nearly every day,
and the grand old man is looking better
than ever.''
Captain Daniels our M.O. has returned
from English leave,
Lieut, W. Whi thread, of the 21st Battel,
has been transferred to us.
Lieut. P. J. Smith, D.5.0., has in-
creased his shoulder decorations by 100
per cent, also Lieuts. Campbell, Kent,
and lioldsworth.
The raid for those of the doubtful
character, unfortunately iu �ur ranks, was
very successful, and quite a number of
these vermin have been either extermin-
ated or imprisoned,
� � �
The officer in charge of football (the
Australian game) reports that the hoys
are putting in a lot of time training and
are practising splendidly.
? * * .. .
Hearty congratulations to Major
Pascoe on receipt of his Crown. Well
earned is the opinio� of officers and men.

Thanks to Capt. E. T. Bazeley, M.C.,
for his willing assistance during publi-
cation of our Annual,

Lieut. C, B, Hislop is just as busy as a
bee in connection with the Brigade

NICE.
YPSES � BIG9BSEINBE
Vol. 1. ?No. 2. Ist NOVEMBER, 1918. Price, Ten Centimes.
How hard it seemed to realise that
one stood not amid the wreck of villages
or on shell-torn battlefields, but in that
beautiful city beneath a sky of cloudless
blue : that one listened no more to the
shriek of shells and the hiss of bullets,
but to the whisper of the Mediterranean
laving that pebbly shore; that one
breathed no longer the gas laden air of
the forward zone but the bracing sea
breeze or the scented zephyrs from the
encircling hills.
How that wonderful promenade along
the sea front gleamed in the sunlight,
its brightness broken here and there by
the gay colors of the thronging holiday-
makers. And, as he rejoiced in the life
and brightness of it all, one's gaze wan-
dered here and there as lie listened to
the passers by, and forgot that he was
still in a land at war. On through the
wide streets of the white-walled, red-
roofed city with its pleasant gardens and
graceful avenues: up over terrace upon
terrace, where the autumn tints of the
vineyards blended in a glorious glow of
color, contrasting sharply with the som-
bre grey-green of the olive groves. Up-
ward still where the green ot bracken
fern and the grey of outcropping rock,
mingled in one harmonious color scheme,
and where the air was filled with the
music of falling waters: and higher yet
towards those giant peaks standing like
sentinels beneath their mantle of eternal
snow !
What a picture,?and what a setting !
But the days passed like shadows, and
Nice with its brightness, its beauty and
its charm had become, and will forever
remain, a delightful memory.? H.C.H.
IN FLANDERS FIELDS.
Some few months since we published
a short poem with the above title, writ-
ten by Col. John McCrae, of the A.M.C.,
who was killed while doing his duty in
191?. It may interest those of ours who
have not already done so to read a very
spirited reply by a comrade who is still
in the fighting line :
'' Fear not that ye have died for naught,
The torch you flung to us we caught
Ten million hands will hold it high,
A,nd Freedom's cause will never die;
We learnt the lesson that ye taught
In Flanders fields."
Frederick Milner.

Sgt. Protheroe is the proud possessor
of a medal won during his course at the
Musketry School. That's the spirit !
"Digger" suggests that a court-martial
is like two-up, because the "heads"
always win.
A WESTERN TRIBUTE.
From W.A. comes the following tribute
to our Battalion paper. Captain Farrell's
brother writes; "I consider it a very
nicely compiled and neatly designed
booklet and well worth preserving as a
souvenir. Probably the copy we re-
ceived is the only one that has reached
W.A. I have already shown it to sev-
eral of my friends and have promised
others the loan of it. So although the
23rd is not of W.A. origin, you will be
pretty well advertised and a warm wel-
come awaits you if ever you come this
way."
AN OFFICERS' HOLIDAY RESORT.
Captain Farrell, who returned lately
from a month's leave spent the time at
Stencourt in Wales. Gol. and Mrs.
Currie, who are the owners of this estate
have given the use of- their magnificent
home tor overseas officers. One hun-
dred spent leave there last year. All
sorts of sport is provided in the way of
hunting, shooting, etc. Lady Harrow-
by, with her army of lady workers,
makes all arrangements.
LATE FOOTBALL.
The results of the two matches played
by the Battaliou on the eve of publication
are as follows 1
AUSTRALIAN GAME.
23rd v 6th Brigade.4 goals, 14 be-
hinds to 2 goals, 1 behind.
SOCCER.
In the 23rd v. 24th match a win was
notched by the latter with 2 goals to nil.

FOOTBALL
This popular branch of sport has be-
come quite part of the Battalion routine,
and a thoroughly organised plan of
campaign has been drawn up. Practice
has been regular and thorough, a com-
mittee of management formed (Lieut.
J. Phillips, capt., Cpl. B. Godfrey, vice-
capt,, Lieut. Kirkwood), trainers appoin-
ted (Clancy, A Coy., Yanevery, C Cov.,
Hanslow, D Coy., Forrest, H.Qrs., and
Cpl. Johnson in charge), and all the
details necessary for the carrying out of
a successful series of matches attended
to. Our own national game of course
takes preference, but soccer finds many
supporters, and with Lieut. Maddrell at
the head of a strong combination it is
quite possible the Battalion will reach
the two objectives (silver cups) at the
end of the final round. Below will be
found results of the matches played. A
list will be compiled showing position
of each Coy. and published in next and
following issues till completion of com-
petition.
Matches Played.
D Coy., 17gls 17bds beat C Coy., 4.5

Two more matches to complete
first round.
Inter-Battalion.
23 rd met the 4th Pioneers and won by
6 goals. 11 to 5. Behinds napoo.
The old firm knocked spots off the
22nd. The red and purple collapsed
much as Austria and Turkey in the
final flutter. Casualties: 23rd, 15.13;
22nd, 3.6.
SOCCER.
The 23rd Battalion Soccer team, which
opened its season at Cappy with a couple
of wins over the 22nd Battalion, recently
played two matches with the neighbor-
ing Tank Battalions.
The first, played on the ground of their
opponents, resulted in a win for the Bat.
by two goals to 1. The finish came with
the Tanks striving hard to equalise. On
the whole it was an enjoyable game, wit-
nessed by a crowd of approximately
300.
The return match, played on the home
ground in fine weather on the 26th Oct.,
was the visitors'game all the way. They
had hard luck in not increasing their
lead of 1 goat before time. Lt. Maddrell
at right back played a magnificent game,
and was the best of our side.
Ihe visitors were afterwards enter-
tained at a hot tea arranged by secre-
tary, L.cpl. Holmes, who, ably assisted
by L.cpi. McCourt and Pte Blackwood,
saw that all .had a good time. Later the'
Y.M.C.A. generously reserved seats for
the party, and all enjoyed a good con-
cert programme by battalion talent.
Up io date no competition matches have
been played, but the team hope to bring
the trophy home.
The following form the committee of
management: Lieut. Maddrell (Capt.),
Ptes Blackwood, Schilling, and McKenzie.
L.cp. W. Holmes, secretary.
HOCKEY.
The following are the results in the first
round of the inter-company Hockey Com-
petition :
C Coy., 3 goals, heat B Coy., 1 goal
II 7 goals, beat A 3 goals
C 11 goals, beat A 1 goal
B 4 goals, beat U 2 goals
C 4 goals, heat D goals
B 5 goals, beat A 2 goals

� A MESSAGE. �
The following are extracts from a
letter received from our old friend Padre
Bladen:
"... I can never forget the some-
time strenuous but always happy days
that I spent with the boys in Oallipo.i,
Egypt and France. My heart is always
with my old Battalion.
I follow with intense interest the
magnificent record which it continues
to put up and rejoice in its successes.
I congratulate you heartily on the little
paper you publish in the field, and I read
with eagerness and pleasure the latest
news of the weltare of the Battalion and
its work. . . ? Remember me kindly to
the old boys of whom I always think
with great affection. Kindest regards.
Your affectionate Old Padre,
PERCY BLADEN.
pg? x often meet boys from the old
Battalion in this hospital and find the
keenest pleasure in renewing old associ-
ations with them.
Ia a later communication, referring,
to the personnel of the Battalion, Padre
Bladen writes? 1
" They will do me, and my association
with them will always be one of the
proudest recollections of my life. You
may rest assured that I keep my eyes
open for the old colors, and I never let
them pass me without having a chat
with the wearer. I understand that you
are all out of the line now, and I hope
you have a good long rest, for no one
deserves it more. It is a grand thing to
do such magnificent work as the Aussies
have done, but its very excellence has
kept them continuously at it for a long,
time, and I fear they have paid very
dearly in casualties.
I will always be glad to have news of
the old Battalion, . . . With kindest re-
gards to the old boys who remember me.
I am. Your affectionate Old Padre,
PERCY BLADEN.
