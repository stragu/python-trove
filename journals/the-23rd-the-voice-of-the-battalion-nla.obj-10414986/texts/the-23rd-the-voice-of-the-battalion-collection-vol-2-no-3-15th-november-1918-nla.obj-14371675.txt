This has been the first occasion for
four and a half years that flags have been
flown generally in Paris.
Immediately after the announcement of.
the cessation of hostilities, the band rose
to the occasion and marched through the
village playing " The Marseillaise," and
other popular Allied National airs. The
Battalion Press published an extraordin-
ary edition half an hour after receipt of
: the news, and copies were eagerly sought
after as souvenirs. Gaiety was the.order
of the afternoon and night, officers and
men celebrating in a fitting manner the
great occasion-
We prophesied in a recent edition that
" the war will end when Major Beith has
a drink and a cigarette." Does the little
bird speak the truth that whispers he
just had one at the noon hour on Arms-

lighting of the recreation hall, and the
illuminations aie now in good order.
For the next ten nights the #th Brigade
Y.M.C.A. Cinema, under Mr. Carter,
shows to the Battalion. There are quite
a number of musical and mirthful items
also.
One of the well-known Lena Ashwell
concert parties visited us during the week.
The performance, which included two fine
sketches, was excellent, and enjoyed by all.
The band went off to tickle the musical
palates of the St. Ouen folk on Thursday.
A few days since the Countess Praeve,
owner of the chateau which shelters H ,Q.
officers just now, visited her handsome
home for the first time in three years.
Knowing the Australians were in tempor-
ary occupation, word was sent forward
asking that two rooms might be prepared.
This was gladly done and shortly after-
arrival-the Countess and her party were
entertained by the C.O. and officers at the
Battalion Mess. After a stay of three
days the lady, returned to Paris.

PRIDE OF THE REGIMENT.
In the new plan for perpetuating Aus-
tralia's lighting traditions, of which de-
tails will shortly be issued by the Defence
Department, it will become possible for a
lad in a cadet battalion to know that he
himself may inherit a persona! share in the
glories of the fighting unit which has made
its name famous in Gallipoli, in Egypt, or
in France, Briefly it is provided that each
battalion ot the Australian Imperial Force
sliall be designated by a name, which, of
course, will not displace, but be in ad-
dition to its official number, and that the
senior cadets and militia of each district
shall receive the number of the same active
service battalion. For instance, it is pro-
posed that the Yarra Borderers, a. metro-
politan unit of the Commonwealth Forces
may receive ihe number of the 23rd Bat-
talion of the Australian Imperial Forces,
which battalion would then be known as
the \ arra Borderers. These changes
would unite a famous battalion with The
youths who will at some time to come be
the defendeis of A ustralia. Under this
plan returned soldiers of the 23rd will
have the right on their discharge, to join
the Yarra Borderer's Reserve of the Aus-
tralian Army Reserve..
THROUGH!
Through forty miles of misery
We ride; scarred hill and-scattered plain,,
Smashed hamlets, woods without a tree,
And find ourselves in France again.
In France, as fair France used to be?
A lovely green untortured land,
Goodly and beautiful to see,
Where still the little houses stand.
Red-roofed against a smoky sky,.
Half hidden in their apple-trees,
And from a window, waving high.
The old flag fiaps against the breeze.
In Malincourt and Walincourt,
Selvigny, by the river-side,
And many a little village more,
They crowd around us as we ride.
And, oh ! their eyes are wet with tears, .
Although the time for tears is done ;
Rifted the shadow of those years :
Four years-four years !-beneatli the HlmS?
Their famished mouths-a last we fill,
At last their anxious hearts set free
Of dread of death : but better still,
We bring them back their liberty !
For every murdered town a town ;
For every broken life a life ;
Justice and Vengeance share one crown 1
Before we set an end to strife.


"POMPEY."
When our Empire gave the call to arms, amongst the first to heed
The War Drum's sullen rumble, the call for man and steed,
The first to note the danger, the first to show the way,
Was one whom we had learned to love, to honour, and obey.
W r e knew him in the office, and on the mimic field
Where Australia's youthful legions their weapons learned to wield,
He'd already tasted danger, was already known to fame,
But we called him Pompey Elliott, the man who plays the game.
And he mustered round him hundreds of the best we had to give,
Our gallant sons and brothers, who died that we might live,
We gathered in pur thousands to cheer them on their way.
We little knew that August morn the part they were to play,
Those sons of the youngest nation, in the art of war unskilled,
Who fought for British Freedom, their hearts with valour filled,
They were the Mighty Anzacs who made Australia's name,
Who were taught by Pompey Elliott to always play the game.
Yes, he took them, loose knit striplings and he turned them into men
Of mighty brawn and muscle, fit to beard a lion's den,
And for halt a year be trained them on Egypt's burning sand
Till the "Seventh" was the model for all that Austral band.
And they loved him as a father, and they gloried in their work
- As they waited for the orders to be ied against the Turk,
For they knew when that would happen they would not be led to shame
By Colonel Pompey Elliott, the man who knew his game.
By the Pyramids of Egypt, on Anzac's famous shore,
On the bloody fields of Flanders, in the stunt at Bullecourt,
'Gainst bomb, or shell, or bullet, or hidden German mine,
Whether raiding German trenches, or " straight'ning out the line,
Wherever there was fighting and duty to be done,
And Australian soldiers followed Australia's noble son,
He was still the same old " Pompey," giant heart in giant frame,
Our dear old Pompey Elliott, who always playod the game.
Now they've made of him a Gen'ral, with honours by the score,
In addition to the ones he gained whilst fighting Brother Boer,
And gallant little Serbia, and Russia, and the rest
Have handed him some baubles to pin upon his breast.
* * * * * *
They may make of him a Marshal, and cover him with stars,
Give all the medals they can mould, with twice as many bars,
They may deck his breast with ribbons, and add letters to his name,
But he's still "Our Dear Old Pompey," who always plays the game.

The day we wengfc to Ailly to play the

(With apologies to "Banjo.")
" There was movement at the Transport'
For the word had passed around
That the 23rd were due to play away ;
So a G.S. and four trusty nags stood
waiting patiently,
'Twas the best that could be found to
pave the way."
Yes, twenty-five of us crowded into
that old G.S. Those who couldn't get in.
Oh, well, they were stiff, and walked-
SOCCER.
On the afternoon of 10th inst. the 23rd
Soccer Team played the first competition
match against the 22nd Battalion away.
It was a hard, fast, and exciting game,
with no score at half time. In the second
half the 22nd lead off by scoring the first
goal. Soon afterwards the 23rd equalized,
and towards the end a penalty given in the
23rd favor resulted in the winning goal
from the sure foot of Thomas, left back,
C, Coy. The game was witnessed by a
large number of the 22nd, and the absence
�f 23rd supporters was strikingly noticable,
and it may be stated that Scotty Regan
of A. Coy. played a very stubborn game
as inside left.
The team were as follows : ?Goal,
Nolan; backs, Lloyd, Thomas; half
backs, Davidson, Scolly, Gray, Foley;
forwards, Sefrs, Holmes, Evans, Regan,
Pye.
The Education Scheme.
The 23rd Battalion branch of the A.I.F
Education Service, although in its infancy,
has taken its first steps. Classes in Short-
hand, French, Arithmetic, and Algebra
have already been commenced, and it is
hoped that English, British History, Aus-
tralian History, Geography, Economics,
Book-keeping, Anatomy, Physiology, and
other courses will be arranged in the near
future. Before the period of demobiliza-
tion, when we are waiting ��r the boat
bound for the beloved '"Land of the
Southern Cross,'' special classes to prepare
men to resume their civil occupations will
be difficult to arrange on a large scale. We
hope, however, that an opportunity will be
taken by as many as possible to improve
their general education by attending the
classes that have been arranged. A good
education is an asset in any walk of life,
so our advice is " make hay while the sun
shines."

Our Christmas Dinners.
COMFORTS FUND. IDEA.
In a copy of the Melbourne " Herald," dated midway in August, (lie following
interesting paragraph appears The Committee of ihe Sixth Infantry Brigade
Comforts Depot is launching a
scheme in order to raise �5OO
for Christmas dinners for the
members of the Brigade 011
active service. This scheme
has as its foundation the idea
of direct appeal, and is worked
out in a way which it is hoped
will appeal to anyone desirous
of helping by a small subscrip-
tion each week. Five hundred
cards are to be issued,and each
subscriber is asked to fill up
one card at the rate of one
shilling per week for twenty
weeks, starting from 16th Aug-
ust. The committee will be
glad to receive as soon as pos-
sible names of anyone desiring
to subscribe. Communications
to be addressed to the honorary
secretary (Miss Sadler), Sixth
Infantry Brigade Comforts De-
pot, Flinders Buildings, Flin-
ders street, Melbourne. It is
hoped that the sums aimed at
will be raised in order to ensure
that a Christmas dinner will be
available to every member of
the Sixth Infantry Brigade at
the front this year.
Maybe a little of the �5OO
will come along this way !
[Since the above has been put
in type sensational develop-
ments have occurred will prob-
ably mean participating in the
feast in peace and quietness.)

Obituary.
SGT. A. B. BROWN.
The whole Battalion, and particularly
its first Company, deeply regret the death
of Sgt. A. B. Brown, which occurred un-
der most unfortunate circumstances a
few days ago. Sgt. Brown, who was an
original member of the Battalion (No.
90, A Coy.), contracted pneumonia, and
after struggling against the malady for
days had to be evacuated, and that just
on the eve of his departure for an Offi-
cers' Training College, His decease
removes from our midst another popular
member and good soldier of the old
Brigade.
23rd SOLDIERS' FUNERAL.
From an English paper we take the
following:
" Another grave space in Locltwood
Cemetery on the slope reserved for
soldiers who die at the Bath War Hos-
pital this afternoon received the body of
a gallant Australian, Cpl. John Albert
Wetzlar, of the 23rd Battalion Australian
Infantry. He had had a leg amputated,
and then pneumonia setting in proved
fatal. Especial honor was done to a
brave and popular soldier, for a firing
party came from the No. 1 Command
Depot at Sutton Veny-under Lieut. J. S.
Anderson, and also the splendid band of
the depot, which won t'he War Office
Competition on Salisbury Plain. This
was under the bandmaster, Warrant
Officer Compton, and played beautifully
Chopin's March Funehre and the Dead
March in " Saul" as the cortege wended
its way from the hospital to the cemetery?
where the procession arrived about 3.15.
The Rev. D. J. Pring, chaplain of the
hospital, officiated. Many comrades
were present, and a large number of
comrades were present and a large num-
ber of residents in Weston. Three
volleys were fired over the grave by the
A.I.F. contingent, and Trumpeter Harris
sounded the "Last Post."
