THE PATH OF THE HOMELESS.
The move period, piior to i a king over
recently, was.one of the most interesting,
and at the � ;U!!C time veiling, that the
Battalion has passed through. The epic
]oucney was full of incident, and some
scenes from the huge drama that was un-
rolled along the roads, a3 we hastened by,
will be recalled by the majority long years
hence. . .
For instance, that fascinating one?the
family group, with all its goods and chat-
tels making its way back along the traffic-
congested road ! The mind instantly re-
call! the man of the party, smoking stol-
idly, arms folded, as he strides along, mak-
ing a brave show of indifference for the
s;ik<i of his womenfolk beside him.
And the super women of Franee ; whose
tyue worth can be estimated only by those
who have seen ! And the youngsters, who
itching- the
cavalcade of strange activity pass by. All
these we can see as we saw them then.
The war became intensely personal as
never before. And even the least heroic
in imagination, one
ful eyed kiddies cowering behind him and
he would not fail-.for he was a Knight-
rough if you will; but still a Knight,
sworn to deliver and to aid.? '!. NY

THE VOICE OF THE FALLEN.
(The author of the following has
since been killed.)
In Flanders' Fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place? and in the sky
The larks still bravely singing fly.
Scarce heard amidst the guns below.

We are the dead ?short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow;
Loved and were loved; and now we lie
landers' Field !
Take up our quarrel with the foe
To you, from falling hands we throw
The Toich? be yours to hold it high ;
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep though poppies grow
In Flanders' Field !

A TRIBUTE.
We of the 2nd Division weie begin-
ning to feel that we were being left
behind in the glorious achievements of
the other Australian Divisions, though
through 110 fault of our own. The bril-
liant capture of Villq-sur-An.Qre the other
day has, however, righted us, as Is evi-
denced by congratulatory orders from
General Haig, General Rawlinson (Bdgr.
our Army), General Bird wood, and Sister
Divisions The role of the Battalion
depended on opportunity. It came all
right, and all ranks engaged did rapid
and magnificent work in the task of
the " mopping up " of Ville-sur-Ancre.
The dash, leadership and co-operation
by our lads were the great feature of the
success, not the least being the signal
communication. It was a fitting climax
to gruelling and preparatory work which
had been done on the other sector, and
our lads went into it keen and eager.
The operation stands out as one of the
best the Battalion has been in, and it is
good to relate, with minimum casualties.
Everyone in the Battalion feels that it
has kept in fore the good reputation and
name of the 23rd. ?Lt.-Col. W.B.
"IS IT WORTH WHILE?"
Is it worth while that we should bid adieu
To those we love ?to mother, sister,
friend :
With men to stand upon the field of war
Where Britain's soldiers Britain's
rights defend ?
Is it worth while'to tread the weary way
'Mid ice and snow; anon, 'mid parch-
ing heat:
To march and halt?onward march again
To hear the ceaseless tramp of march-
ing feet ?
Is it worth while to fight from day to day;
From morn till eve ; from even unto
morn :
To fight in hope,?and after hope is gone;
And still to fight,?for nations yet un-
born ?
Is it worth while to die for such a cause;
In victory's hour, or vanquished in the
fight;
That nations hidden under slavery's cloud
May gaze again?at last?on Freedom's
right ?
"Is it worth while ? " and clear from
rank to rank
The answer comes?a mighty ringing
cry
"All we have, in Honor's name we give,
That men may live, it is worth while
to die ! " H.C.H.


BATTALION ORGANISATION.
No. I.* -1 SIGNALLING.
It is proposed, through the medium of
our own iittle journal, to publish articles
occasionally, dealing with the organis-
ation and interior economy of an infantry
battalion on active service. Such articles
whilst becoming a permanent record will,
we feel sure, be appreciated by our home
folk, a great number whom we know are
quite in the dark as to the multiple
branches or departments which are part
and parcel of the unit.
From both the tactical and adminis-
trative aspect, whether it is a battalion
or an army, one of the most important is
signalling, or inter-communication. This
may be by various means, all of the fol-
lowing methods being used : Telephonic,
Wireless, Power Buzzer (the latter which
makes use of mother earth as a conduc-
tor!, Visual forms are of various, types,
e.g^Lamps, Shutter and Flags.''A
stant change and improvement has been
made with visual signalling since the
outbreak of the war. Prior to 1914 the
Heliograph form was in great demand.
It has been replaced by artificial light in
the form of highly-charged electric port-
able lamps, which, unlike the heliograph,
are not dependent upon climatic condi-
tions in the way of sunlight, the only
deterrent to its value being heavy fog.
It is used most effectively both by day and
night, and its powers of radiation are as
effective on the darkest night as 011 the
clearest day. It can be read most clearly
with the naked eye at two miles' distance.
Next to the telephone the lamps are the
main standby of a battalion, and mounted
to supplement the telephone, which is so
often lost use of by enemy action, e.g.,
shell, machinegun and bombs breaking
the wires. Five lamps are issued, one
for Battalion H.Q. and one for each Coy.
Other forms of visual are carried out by
shutters, which are worked by a cord and
spring attachment to smalL blinds, give
the necessary Morse code of long and
short exposures of white cloth against
dark green background. The old and
popular signallers' flag is not used now,
except for training. Its use in present
warfare being almost impossible. Under
open warfare conditions it would be of
great value, but only after the lamp and
other means had failed. Telephones are
the mainstay of a battalion, whether in
in or out of the line. They are extremely
light (about 51bs), small in bulk, and the
type now standardised are most reliable
and durable. The issue to a battalion is
five, and disposed of through the xinit as
the lamp. The advantages of a 'phone
over all other forms of signalling is the
rapidity of inter-communication, and the
direct touch with the various Coys., etc.
Its disadvantages, of course, are destruc-
tion o l f wires, and enemy intercepting
conversation by special instruments.
Other forms of communication are the
special methods utilised with aircraft.
Obvious reasons make it impossible to
divulge the methods used, though, natur-
ally, this form is very limited in the
length of the message. Sufficient is it to
state that it is most effective and reliable.
Other means used are rockets, messenger
dogs, and last, but by no means least,
are the runners, of whom the annuls of
the Australian Forces will undoubtedly
ring with praise of many gallant deeds
done by them. A future article will deal
with a signaller's training, his duties,
and courageous work under fire. J.A.W.

ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION.
A few days' rest at Pont Noyell.es gave
the opportunity of celebrating the third
anniversary of the day on which the Sixth
Brigade bade farewell to Australia,
in the form of an officers' dinner.
Among the guests of the evening were
Brig.-Gen. Paton, Capt. Galbraith, of the
3rd Div. A.S.C., Licuts. Hislop and Mil-
ligan, of 6th Bgde. 11. Q., and Mr. Carter,
of Y.M.C.A.
After a splendid repast
the following toasts were
proposed : " The King,"
by Lieut,-Col. Brazenor;
" 23rd Battn." by Brig-Gen.
Paton, the C.O, responding;
" Silent," by Padre Clever-
don, " The Visitors," by
Major Bateman. The en-
joyment of the even-
ing was greatly
ad led to by the
band, which ren-
dered one of its
finest programmes.
The thanks of the
diners are due to
Lieut. J. Pindlay,
whose untiring efforts
were responsible for the
success of the evening ;
to the vocalists, whose
items were so thoroughly
appreciated ; to the band ? and all tuosc
who assisted. A feature of the evening
was the autographing of the souvenir
edition of " The Voice of the Battalion,"
a copy of which was presented to each
guest. Midnight saw a deserted room,
the departed guests being well pleased with
their entertainment.
CHANGES IN COMMAND.
During the last few days notable changes
have taken place in the higher command
of our Australian Force. Gen. Birdwood
has left to command the Fifth Army,
With him has gone his Chief-of-Staff,
Major-Gen. C. B, B. White. Major-Gen.
Monash succeeds Gen. Birdwood, with
Col. Blarney Chief-of-Staff. Major-Gen-
erals Walker and Smith are replaced by
Brig.-Generals Brand and Kosenthal,
whilst Brig.-Gcneral Gelli-
brand, the former
Chief of this Bri-
gade, replaces
Major - General
Monash.

At the same time as the 6th Brigade
were attacking at Ville-sur-Ancre, a
certain officer of the 23rd was also hav-

All objectives were attained, several
prisoners being brought in. Enemy

rumored that the officer will duly receive

LINE DOINGS.
No triumph of this Battalion will he re-
called in after years with more pride and
satisfaction than the one aclieived only a
few mornings' ago. True, a miniature
undertaking, under thirty all told forming
this Battalion's quota, hut its flawless con-
ception and brilliant execution well qualify
it to rank with those greater gems of
Broodseiude, Buliecourt, or even Pozieres.
It was an affair of a swamp and a battered
village (known well to most of us in hap-
pier days) with a sluggish stream in the
foreground. Hearts beat tensely while
this Styx-like water was bridged by the
Engineers, but the enemy suspected nothing
The 1.0. officer, Lieut. Weir, was respon-
sible for the tactical operations of this
daring scheme, and it speaks well for his
work and responsibility of this dangerous
mission that the Engineers specially re-
quested the services of the same party for
later bridging. The preliminary recon-
naissance was equally successful, and the
unknown territory thoroughly investigated.
Another night of silent preparation fol-
lowed?i then the stunt. The barrage was
annihiliating. The guns relentlessly con-
tinued their work as sister battalions fol-
lowed closely behind the line of smashing
shells, and their success signals were ob-
served half an hour later. In half an hour,
:again, our men filed silently through the
darkness to play their part in the drama.
Poor paths, at best, were picked through
the swamp. In some cases swimming was
actually resorted to to naake progress, but
the line was formed without mischance just
outside the village.
At 4.15 a.m. the barrage lifted, and
simultaneously orders were received from
H.Q. to advance. A nest of machine guns
gave our hoys their first opportunity.
There was no mad rushing when the enemy
were sighted, but a cool, methodical stalk-
of the quarry. A few grey forms were
shot as they tried to man their guns. The
remainder decided on discretion, and made
helter-skelter for the buildings near by.
Then events followed more quickly than
description could hope to keep pace with.
Suffice to say that by 4.40 a.m. the wel-
come news was back, twenty prisoners and
three machine guns? and that was only the
beginning. Isolated encounters in cellars
followed, and prisoners were captured al-
most too rapidly for escorting away. Only
once did the enemy really show fight, and
then his bravery was besmirched by an act
of base treachery. A Hun officer com-
manding a small party surrendered and
then made for another building from which
he shot three of our men, who unsuspect-
ingly approached him. He paid the full
penalty for his infamous deed a very few
minutes later. In marked contrast, it was
gratifying to note the chivalrous conduct
of our own lads, who not only assisted in
caring for and carrying out enemy wound-
ed until his inhuman artillery made it im-
possible, but even carefully refrained from
depriving prisoners of their war decorations
which must have impressed even the be-
sotted Hun. Another party from C Coy.
arrived to assist in the collection of the
thoroughly beaten enemy, and the final
figures for the Battalion were : Prisoners,
77 (including two officers); estimated
killed, 50 ; machine guns captured, 8, and
also one bomb thrower. A large quantity
of valuable maps and documents was also
collected, and due regard was paid to the
requirements of our war museums, which
were enriched by the addition of articles
of equipment, uniform and telephonic

communication, to mention only a few
of the varied collection sent back.
The glory of the achievement, of
course, rests primarily with the Bat-
talion special party; and the Colonel
must congratulate himself on having
encouraged the forming and maintaining
of such a force, and in his choice of lead-
ers of it. Regarding these it is super-
fluous to comment. The best testimony
to the work of Lieut. Lowe, who during
many weary weeks, overcame step by
- step, by almost insuperable organisation,
difficulties, and at the same time infused
every man in the party with his own in-
domitable enthusiasm, and who, in com-
pany with Lieut. Smith (whom we take
this opportunity to congratulate on his
well-earned promotion), finally led them
to .this unparalled success, lies in the
fact that so many of the enemy were put
out of action under two hours, by twenty-
seven all told. Lieut. Wiltshire, to whose
initiative iu running out a wire and
maintaining communication back to the
Battalion throughout much of the suc-
cess of the operation was due, was always
in the forefront of the battle with his
signallers, and took a most active part in
the fighting. As tar as the party is con-
cerned, perhaps Lieut. Lowe's first re-
mark in the village, when he was con-
gratulated, deserves to be recorded as the
highest testimony
"The lads did it! They're great!
They're simply wonderful!
Each man performed a Goliath's part
none more so than Cpl. Flynn, of B
Coy,, who was killed by the treachery
mentioned before. He was the ideal
combination of dash and caution, and in
his death the Battalion has lost another
of its most capable and unassuming
N.C.O.s. He will be sadly missed by his
many comrades in B Coy. Ptes. Wilding
and Hargreaves, both severely wounded,
were the other casualties suffered, and
their gallantry before being wounded was
only equalled by their fortitude after-
wards. Sgt. Dixon, who returned to the
Battalion two' days previously, led his
party with his old consummate dash
but it is impossible to individualise. At
least a dozen names recur momentarily
to the writer's mfemory, and he saw only
a minor part of the show.
Altogether the Battalion may rest well
satisfied with--the- honor that it has won.
No doubt all who were absent through
duty elsewhere would have infinitely
preferred to have gone forward in the
stunt, but any -disappointment must be
amply compensated for by the success of
the whole operation, to which those who
only stood and held the line -contributed
in no small degree. The co-operation
of the Cos. was enthusiastic and helpful.
Major Batemam, ourC.O. this time, in,
was responsible for much of the general
scheme and the preliminary organising.
At all times he remained an optimistic
master of the whole situation, and
with Lieut. -Elliott -as Adjutant, and
?Lieut. Weir, the Intelligence Officer,
supervised and co-ordinated "the various

A HIDDEN FIANCEE.
Lifting motor engines from trucks is no
easy task, and one can quite imagine how
the perspiration streamed down our faces
though the atmosphere was cold and the
ground frozen. We had a few Tommies
helping us, and one appeared particu-
larly interested in me.
I moved towards him, "Fairly warm
work, Tommy?" I remarked.
"Yes, Chum, too warm for me. I
eould do with a drink. You don't hap-
pen to have any water in your bottle?"
"No," 1 replied. Carrying ice to drink
out of a water bottle, is like promising to
pay a debt when y&ur pay book shows a
debit balance."
"Well," chimed Tommy, " one must
.remain dry."
" Not at all," I said, " come with me."
We were soon facing one another in
front of the Australian Comforts Fund
.with a condensed milk tin full of cocoa.
" Does this come from your people at
home Chum ?" he asked as he sipped and
.flinched, owing to the heat of the drink.
" Well?it does, indireotly," I said, and
I noticed he wanted to give some sort of
thanks to the Australian people.
"How do you fare for letters or parcels?''
"I get my letters alright, hut parcels?l
.cannot honestly say I receive half what
are sent."
" Shame !" he said and I could see that
a problem was now in his mind. His gaze
was still upon me. I offered him a cig-
arette which he thankfully accepted.
" Are you one of those Australian ab-
originals ?" he asked.
I smiled, and felt rather pleased with
rnyselt for having discovered the cause
of the strange glances,
"Oh, no!" I replied,-"I haven't that
broad nose and those parapet looking
lips, nor that springy walk and boom-
erang smile, but I was born in Australia,
and so were my mother and father."
He smiled, then became somewhat
serious. He then handed me a piece of
paper with an address written rudely
across it, and told me to write to the lady
for anything I needed urgently. I felt
rather in debt and it was my glance that
now became mysterious.
The morning passed without any fur-
ther developments. I wrote to the lady,
and in quick time received a tin of cig-
arettes and some chocolates. I replied,
thanking her, and promised to write
often. It was after the fourth letter that
I received more cigarettes and a few
lines stating my letters were exceedingly
interesting, and that I should be most
welcome if ever I was fortunate enough
to reach London.
There came a time when I was unable
to write letters and my lady friend in
London had quite left my memory.
Whilst in a hospital in London as a
result of illness?and lonely?l risked
another short note :
Dear Mrs. Goodall,
You will be surprised to learn I
am in a London Hospital, and shall
be having a few days furlough
shortly. I would like to call and
thank you personally for the many
kindnesses. We could have say?an

In a few days I received a reply.
Dear Mr.---
Sorry you are in hospital, but as
we did not hear from you for so long
we naturally thought you were taken
prisoner or killed. Since then Eva

THE FRENCH PEASANTY
?
FRIENDSHIP AND SHREWDNESS.
The soldier who has lived in France
for two years becomes acquainted with
many sides of French life. Some are to
his advantage; some not. In the big
towns he sees the more sparkling and
vivacious character that is like the cham-
pagne of the country. But in the vil-
lages that lie near the front line he learns
to appreciate its more honest vintage.
To know well the peasant life ot France
is to know a life totally different from
anything that has birth in Australia. It
is impossible to consider all aspects of
peasant nature, but there are two which
go together that in their combination are
very typical of the people. These are
friendliness and shrewdness. The two are
not always found in the same person.
Sometimes a woman or man is all friend-
liness, often his or her eyes glitter with
the sharp appreciation of the well-earned
franc. But when combined surely no one
is so characteristic of La France.
Their friendliness makes the most ex-
cellent companions for our boys, who are
themselves the most friendly of mortals.
Difficulties of language form no bar to
pleasurable association. If it be no more
than tres fatigue ;" in the hands of an
expressive French girl that can be made
to mean a great deal. And a round of
pleasantries crop up that is kept going
until it is time for " couchez."
These people, who live so poorly and
hardly, appreciate a hearty "bonjour"
or " bon soir." If you live in a billet and
do not spend an hour of your evening in
conversation, of however limited a nature,
your hostess will be offended or fancy
you are offended with her. Nor do they
ever forget a face. Yisit one of your old
billets after two years absence and yo
welcome will be as immediate and warn
as it you had left the week previous.
And so it is with some surprise we
learn to know the shrewdness that is hot
so pleasant a trait in their nature. Bu
we must put ourselves in their place

But still the feeling rankles. A typjca
instance occurred recently when some-
officers were stranded in a village. An
interpreter introduced them to the Curt
who was only too pleased t
use of an unused room. Hearing th
the Cure and servant were refugees the
officers gave them bread, butter and lux-

feeling of gratitude. An occasional tin
of cigarettes and a nip of whiskey was
included. But with the order to move
came a personal request from the Cure
for fifty francs?'the use of the room at
three francs a day. There was just the
feeling of being " sold." Yet the
Cure s f "riendliness had not been assumed?
No ! The French folk are merely wise in
their generation. Who can blame them ?
