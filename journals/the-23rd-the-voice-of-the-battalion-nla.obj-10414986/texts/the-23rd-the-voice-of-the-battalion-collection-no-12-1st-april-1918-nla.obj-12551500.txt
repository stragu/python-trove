In view of the enlargement* and im-
provement, which was promised an issue
or two back, and which commences
with this number, we have to make
another appeal to officers and men of
the Battalion to ease our task a little
?with a few contributions to these col-
umns. Without any bewailing or grous-
ing, at times we are at a loss to gather
an assortment of reading matter that
would be interesting, and at the same
time original. We will, therefore, wel-
come literary effort by members in verse
or any other form. Contributions need
not have all or any of the merits of
finished journalism or authorship, sim-
ply something in the way of an attempt
at helping to keep up the standard of
the paper that lias proved such a wel-
come news bearer to all our homes in
Australia. In fact, if you have an in-
spiration of something literary, the
material for a story, the subject of a
joke, or the outline for an article, let us
have it. We will try to turn it into
shape, and by doing so you will be add-
ing to the power and quality of " The
Voice of the Battalion."

"THE PIP."
Surrounded tho' we be by stirring life,
Enfolded'in the mesh of battle's strife,
Appears at times a haunting, phantom
myth
A happy home, across the fbatn.
Tho' comrades all around may merry be,
Laughing banter mingle un happy glee,
Surmounting all remains the memory
Of a happy home, across the foam.
Tlio' cloudless sky above make's perfect
day,
Wildflowers bloom around in line array,
O'er verdure green does skylark trill his
lay-
He sings of home, across the foam.
W hen in the West an orb of gold does dip,
When wood and ridge by ghostly moon
is lit,
Tenfold enshrouds that feeling of the
" Pip ' w
And thoughts of home, across the foam.
If perchance thou should be warned
for Blighty leave, be kind to the blokes
at Calais or Boulogne, in ca-se thy leave
should be short, but on the return Jour-
ney thou can'st show thy independence.

ON RE VISITING HOME.
?-
There is a peculiar joy that has befallen
some Australians, whose families were in
England at the time of their enlistment.
These men have had the opportunity of
seeing again friends and relatives under
circumstances of unusual grace. They
have returned after offering their lives for
the Empire. And to do that is to be
thought a hero in the circle of those who
love you. Englishmen, who fight so near
their homes, have had something of the
same experience. But they have not
been that length of time away which makes
a renewal of acquaintance almost like
meeting strangers. Their friends were
with them when they enlisted, saw them in
their hours of training, and in the few
days of final leave. They know them
intimately in their hopes and fears. Aus-
tralians who have returned home know
also the joys of re-union. But their case
differs from those Australians with English
homes. There has not been the long sep-
aration in days of peace, when old interests
faded in the brighter light of present
events. And so we can write of these men
as enjoying a pleasure unique amoug our
troops. Let us examine a little its peculiar
circumstances.
In the early days of the war, when the
Australians came first to France, many
found themselves at a base on the coast,
but a few miles from England. It was
-possible, on a clear, sunny day, to discern
the faintest outline of the shore, and in the
imagination vividly reconstruct that coun-
try sheltering mother, sisters and brothers.
And with the vision would come an in-
tense desire to bridge that narrow gulf.
As never before came the longing to be
amongst them once more. But army
orders, which liave no consideration of
feelings, would detail the man for the front
line. War must be seen before leave.
He would be in bis first fight ; learn the
tragedy of battle ; the monotony of army
life. Then would come that first leave.
The next ten days can be viewed as a
singing joy, a melody of lightness. Not
Mercury himself moved with swifter feet.
To have been under fire but added to the
ecstacy. But through all the happiness
ran a sense of something missing. An
intangible feeling that anticipation had
again triumphed over realisation. And
the reason could be found. The life in
another country had given a breadth of
outlook that made home seem a little
limited and narrow. The breathing spac-
iousness of the bush would be felt in a
fleeting moment as though the fields of
England were cramping. And now the
first leave was over.
But the next brought a deeper joy.
Memories of kindness and affection in the
interchange of letters were now added
to the pleasure of freedom from the line.
Slight differences became obliterated in
wider sympathy and knowledge. Every-
where would be found an intensifying of
love based on the deepening foundation of
friendship. If the war teaches men to see
one another in the light of their virtues,
the same holds good with relatives and
friends. Little oddities and comparisons
are lost in the sunlight of their finer
qualities. If a man has the good fortune
to see service through two or three years
he builds up on his days of leave a palace
of affection that will last a lifetime. He
is in danger o'f forgetting his Australian
home by the close proximity of his new-
found affections. That is a very wonder-
ful experience. The heart warms at the
? thought of a hundred tiny acts done in the
spirit of sheer delight and joyousuess of
' service. Where he was self-consciously
? thinking of causing trouble, the man

knows how lie is thoroughly welcome.
The early morning cup of tea; the morn-
ing hath, with its delightful cleanliness,
and the little breakfast so clean and.neatly
laid, become the outward symbols of a
love that glows in the eyes at the sight of
you. Scott said no truer words than
" One crowded hour of glorious life
Is worth an age without a name."
But the interpretation does not lie in
the heroic deed-; on battlefields, but in the
rushing hours of leave when love is awak-
ened that in more peaceful times would
take years to arouse. Indeed, so conven-
tional is the peace-bound person, that the
knowledge might never he learnt. But
given the chance of knowing again your
former friends and you carry hack such
memoried joy that dangers can be faced
serenely. You have had the crowded
hour and passed beyond the days without
a name. ?L.G.S.
AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
?
A. letter has just been received by the
Colonel from Mr. A. W. Ethell, father of
the late Lieut. J. O. Ethell, who for-
feited his life about Ypres in October.
Mr. Ethell writes in the following strain :
"Dear Col. Brazenor,--It was very
kind of you to send me particulars of his
death, and J appreciate it very much, as
also your remarks about his general char-
acter. . . . It is hard to lose him, but
regrets are useless, and, after all, one is
proud to think of the name which he and
all the others will leave behind. The
rotters left in this country will realise it
when the true inwardness of the sacrifice
comes to be known."
Sgt. J. Osborne has been promoted to
C.S.M.
".COO-EE"."
The following are extractions from a
letter received by Colonel W. Brazenor
from Rev. D. Macrae Stewart, who, it
will be remembered by many,-shared the
dangers of the Peninsular as spiritual
adviser.:
" V ery warm congratulations on the
D.S.O. There are lots of people out here
who will be greatly pleased to see that
you have got the distinction which you
earned long ago. ..... It is getting to be
a long time of waiting for those on this
side. lam almost afiaid to ask after old
comrades, because so much has happened
in the last year. A.nyhow, 1 hope you
will remember me kindly to any who are
with you yet. The old 6th has done
splendidly, and I am constantly back with
it in imagination, though realities have
pulled-me bacx among the stay-at-homes.
~ . . There is a big welcome awaiting you
when you come back. The Rev. John
Walker has just returned. He saw a
great deal, and is in fine-form, in spite of
all that he has suffered through the loss of
his gallant hoys."
We extend our -thanks to the Melbourne
"Age" for their recognition of our modest
efforts at trench journalism, and will try
to retain the good opinion of Victoria's
leading newspaper.
According to files to hand the conscrip-
tion issue has caused a good deal of con-
troversy in Australia. Both sides have
been throwing " gas " shells.
Chief Justice, Sir John Madden, has
died in Victoria.

There's rumors of rumors rumored, as an
art cut very fine ;
In soldier's palaver '' furplis " they are
called, and busy as busy they be,
In variety most inexhaustible of hap-
penings on land and sea.

and pounces on the mess,
" 'Ave yer 'eard ther latest ' furph,' " he
cries,." I'll bet yer cannot guess ? "
" All married men to pack their kits,
they're wanted 'ome ' toot sweet.' "
"The population's all a-dwindling ; 'ell!

not their lonely wenches,
Their " spell" is o'er, they move along
" toot sweet " into the trenches.
" Mails from 'ome 'ave all been sunk,"
goes round in piteous wail,
And after that a shout goes round ?
" Blank Company fall in for mail' "
The hardest of the lot is the one that
makes you grieve,
When it goes round on rapid wings," 'Ave
yer 'eard they've cut out leave ? "

????s
On 26tli March, 1916, the 23rd Bat-
talion landed at Marseilles, after the
memorable evacuation. Little did ihey
think that more than two years was to
be spent in France, There are still many
left who can look back on that period
with pride. But, alas, there are many
who have found their last resting place,
gone, but not forgotten.

LINE DOINGS.
_?+
Our first few days forward were' spent
in the vicinity of the " Hill."
If only Lewis Carroll lived to-day
what could he not do with the conglom-
eration of fancy that always strikes one
there ?
For instance, those mystic spirits
called guides who flit in and out of the
dark underground passages with almost
supernatural intx - epidity, while one stag-
gers after them seeing S.O.S. and other
stars as he bumps his head on a low
beam.
And then those fires eternal that tor-
ment while they ventilate.
Then the Gun Boot King! Imagine
Lewis making the ogre say to the delin-
quent who has lost his boots, Off with
his feet! Off with his feet! "
Or the Camouflage Fiends ? What
opportunity for a dress of sackcloth and
slcish6s
All staged, of course, under those
electric lights whose peculiar property
is utter darkness at inopportune mom-
ents.
The material is excellent call it
" Billjim in Underland." If you care to
elaborate the phantasy, intersperse be-
tween the scenes a few sinster figures
called " Esses Emmas" and a multitude
of other shadowy forms. Have numerous
tragic episodes called " gutzers" when
the first meet the second, and the dram-
atic element will be amply provided for.
But to resume
All this applied to one Company only.
The remainder were distributed along
the broad highway, where the stars from
heaven twinkled coldly down and Fiitz
shells hummed a rather unsettling kind
of lullaby. Here it was S.M. Cox
answered the last roll call, and everyone,
from the Colonel down, deeply regrets
the loss to the Battalion of one of its
best.
The move to the line was uneventful,
and the first few mornings equally so,
though the " minneuwerfer " people did
their best to relieve the monotony.
A few mornings later, however, it be-
came very lively, and where we had
been given only samples before, we now
received the whole stock in trade, arid
even the average Australian youngster
on Guy Fawkes' anniversary would have
been satisfied with the fireworks display.
Unfortunately Sgt. King and six other
men of Major Beith's Coy. were killed
in the bombardment, and to the relatives
and friends of these comrades we ex-
tend our si-ncerest sympathy. The other
regrettable feature of the morning w:.s
that Fritz didn't come over on to us.
Had he done so there is not the slightest
doubt but that retribution to the last
ounce would have been exacted.
The remainder of the period was with-
out incident. The Colonel, after seeing
us safely installed, had to leave to at-
tend a school, and his mantle descended
on the broad shoulders of the Second in
Command, who carried on in his usual
practical style.
Company officers and men again up-
held the best traditions of the Battalion,
and, in conclusion, a special word is due
to ration carriers, the working details,
the scouts who nightly piloted Company
formations, the Padre and his feeding
of a numerous flock, and the A.M.C,,
under recently returned Captain Grr.
?M.W.
It is believed that while on duty.rigt.
Gamel had the misfortune to break his
leg, and is now in hospital.

C Company's headquarters were sur-
rounded by water on the occasion of
taking over, which left Major Beith in a
quandary as to whether ho should post

A FRENCH MARKET DAY.
f ??
Imagine a town about the size and
population of Shepparton (Vic,) or
Albury, and.let your mind drift back to
the morning of a country show in Aus-
tralia, when every available vehicle,
horse and mule is brought into requisi-
tion, and you,will have some idea of the
first phase, with the exception that the
roads into these French towns on two
days of the week are lined with pedes-
trians ?men, women and children?'ail
on the way to do barter for some article
of produce.
As you' approach, the square, where
improvised stands, marquees and stalls
of all kinds are erected the. evening be-
fore, you hear a medley of strange and
unfamiliar sounds ?the bray of a calf,
the squealing of numerous pigs, some
being tethered, others in bags, the crow
of a perky, rooster, or the quack of a
duck or two.. This row, combined with
the chattering marketmen and women,
goes on from early morn until the midday
hour, when generally the bulk of the
day's., goods have bee-n disposed of.
Nothing but what can be found some-
where in the space allotted for the sale
pork, potatoes, poultry, eggs, cheese,
fruit, vegetables, fish and sweets. Even
clothing, hats, boots and shoes, are on
sale, and the womenfolk are the principal
vendors. The chattering and gesticula-
tions are more or less varied as the bargain
being driven loosens or becomes harder,
but, withal, it seems with the farming
and village folk to combine the oppor
tunity to lay in supplies for the interval
between that and the next fair, and the
pleasure of meeting friends from distant
parts. On the whole it is a vein happy
sort of business,, and is entered into with,
the usual whole-liearted spirTfso pica!'
of the French, It is one of those sights
that the writer would not have piissed
for worlds.
