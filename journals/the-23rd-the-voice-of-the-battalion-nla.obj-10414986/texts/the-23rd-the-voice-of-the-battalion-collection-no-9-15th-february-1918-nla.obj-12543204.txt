It is a rule with properly organised i
and well-conducted papers in civil life, j
as their foundations become secure, and ]
their permanent success assured, to in-
crease in size and quality, and at the r
same time reduce in price. The 23rd
has been supported right royally by all
ranks, and its financial position has
become good. A soldier's journal should
be no exception, so in recognition of
these facts, it has been decided, from
this issue, to make the price ONE
PENNY. In regard to the improve-
ments, well, these we hope will include
an additional page or two of reading
matter, a number of topical sketches in
cartoon, illustrations of our daily life
and doings, with all due regard to the
censorship laws, an improvement in the
title page, in fact a remodelling all thro'-
It is also intended as far as possible to
supply every member absent from the
battalion with a copy either thro his
comrades, or by direct application to the
office. Your support has been splendid.
As for value in return?well, wait and
see."
THE SONG OF THE PLANES.
? +
A wliirr of wings in the dead of night,
And between the earth and sky,
Hidden from our peering eyes-death
goes quietly by
The engine sings it's morbid rhyme, like
the song of the lost banshee,
And maybe it's song, high in the sky, is a
song of death to me.
It fades away in the void?l strain my
listening ear
To catch the sound of its hymn of death,
I clutch my heart with fear.
* * *
And far away a clash-of chords?that
break life's tangled skein,
Majestic, deep, low sounding notes?l'll
never hear again.
And when they drop their message brief,
someone has to go,
1 For human hearts are not yet tuned to
! catch the message ?so
5 A whirr of wings in the dead of night,
s and between the earth and sky,
? Plidden from our peering eyes ?death
1 goes quickly by.

WHERE WE ARE.
1
No. 11.
" Somewhere in France,nestled
among, and surrounded by hills,
lies the village, peaceful, and undis-
turbed, save by the murmer of the
rippling brooklet that winds and sparkles
through the meadows and farm lands on
either side of its pebbly banks. Un-
scathed by marauding Hun, and un-
spoiled by soldier vandals it remains
almost as before the lust for blood and
conquest gripped +he hearts and minds
of men. Red tiled or thatched, the
houses are dotted here and there, and
in the more protected places the sun-
shine of an extremely mild season has
persuaded the Snowdrops to burst into
early bloom. A strange contrast to the
surroundings of our last place of abode,
where shot and shell held sway.
An historic church rises high above
the ancient graveyard alongside, where-
in rest the remains of past prominent
citizens. From the bell tower chimes
the Angelus at eventide, and knees are
bent in prayer, for they are pious people
these villagers.
On the hillsides intensely cultivated
holdings are seen, on which from dawn
till dusk old but industrious men, aided
by their womenfolk, perform the agri-
cultural labours that in peace time
would be allotted to more stalwart sons
of the soil. But, alas! the country
called them, and those left are nobly up-
holding France's reputation for thrift
and independence.
In the distance through the haze
smoke stacks that usually denote the
manufacturing centre can be dimly dis-
cerned, but again the war tells a story,
for the furnaces are silent; no dense
columns of smoke issue from the chim-
neys, and but few toilers emerge from the
factories at the cease work hour. A
peaceful quietness and hopeful resig-
nation reigns around, and were we our-
selves not active participants in the great
tumult of nations, the fact would be hard
to believe.
In this sweet Auburn of France Aus-
tralian troops find a home, and respite
from the nerve strain and the physical
weariness of the firing line.
MOVING DAY.
$
Orders to move ? Back from the
firing line. Great, isn't it ? Yes. Wo
rise at 6.30 a.m., breakfast at 7 a.m.,
blankets rolled for transport at 7.30, and
what then ? Move off? No. Fall in
for inspection with packs complete.
This done, then we await further instruc-
tions, The battalion will march out at
11.30 to entrain at an adjacent railhead,
But it doesn't happen. A derailment or
something incidental to troop transport
ocsars, and the delayed movement
commences at 3.30 p.m. So far, so good.
A march of about three miles brings us
to our entraining point, and some tin e
after nightfall sees usboarding a French
" train de luxe" for a part unknown
to us. Through five hours of the night
we travel as comfortable as circum-
stances will allow," and in the nipping
air of early morn we detrain among the
hills of a northern province. Another
two miles of pilgrimage, and 10, we are
at our destination. In the "wee sma'
'oors " we retire to our allotted billets,
tired and sleepy, but satisfied for. the
time at least. We will miss the vigil-
ance of Fritz and his " whizz-bangs."
So much for the Intantry. Transport
lucky dogs?toured by road, a distanae
of about fifty miles, viewing the beauties
of the country by the way. Nevertheless
they arrived one day later than the
battalion. No matter, a few hours sees
our new home in order. Such are the
ways of soldiers.

MUTUAL CONGRATULATIONS.
?
In the absence of the C.O. Major W.
J. Bateman forwarded a letter of con-
gratulation from the Battalion to Colonel
G. 11. Knox, on receipt of his recent
honor, and the following reply has been
received:
"My Dear Major,?l want to thank
you most sincerely for your letter of
congratulation, which I have just re-
ceived. I felt sure that the old Battalion
would be pleased, as these honors are
given not so much to the individual as
to the organisation over which, for the
time being, he is command, and in my
case I feel that receiving the C.M.G. has
beep a recognition of the efficiency of
the-old Battalion and my present Depot,
much more than to any particular merit
by myself.
I am delighted that Colonel Brazenor
has received the D.5.0., which he has
long since merited. Again let me thank
yon very much indeed for your kind
letter, and wishing you all safety and
every good wish for the New Year,
I remain,
Yours most sincerely,

A FAREWELL LETTER.

The following letter, which speaks for
itself, has been received by the Colonel
from Captain Dawson, cn the eve of his
entry into the Indian Army .:
"My Dear Colonel,?'l have been pur-
ting off ray task of saying farewell to
you and all the members of the Battalion
for some days now, as it not an easy
thing to do.
As you know I have been selected for
the Indian Army, and now only await
my embarkation orders, which may
reach me any day, probably about the
sth February.
I cannot express my feelings in words,
but I should like to thank you especially
for the kindly T way I was received into
the 23rd, and for the loyal assistance
you at all times gave me. An Adjut-
ant's work is not, as you know, the
easiest, but with yourself and the
officers of the Battalion it was made
quite a happy position to fill, and I only
hope that my efforts were of service to
the Battalion.
The change I have made is indeed a
big one, and although I may lose my
identity on the surface as an Australian
I shall always be one at heart. I fear
this is a most uninteresting epistle,, but
I assure you it is the hardest letter I
have had to write for many a long day,
and can only say, in conclusion, that I
thank you, the officers and men of the
23rd for their kindness and loyal assist-
ance at all times, and wishing the old
Battalion good luck, new honors to add
to the present glorious record, and a
safe and happy return to Australia.
Yours very respectfully,
29.1.18. KEITH DAWSON.

WITH THE FLYING CORPS.
?
Having recently been attached for
4 days to a squadron of the R.F.C, per-
haps a few of the lessons learnt and the
experiences may be of some interest.
A lecture explaining the object of the
course precedes appointment to various
flights with the pilots. These men are
on an average about 21 years of age, ten
to eleven stone in weight, and have
had various "bags" to their credit, a
young Canadian heading the list with
twelve Bosche.- A fine spirit prevails,
and all spoke with enthusiasm of the
new machines we were bringing out, and
the maintenance of superiority in the air.
Our first flight was a short one, for
experience. It was not without sensa-
tion, the most marked event being a
" pocket" encountered when a turn was
made. An elderly Colonel remarked :
" It was going splendidly, and I was en-
ioying it immensly when suddenly the
pilot dropped one wing, stuck it in a
solid piece of air and spun round on it.
I can assure you for a moment I wished
I was back with my battalion."
The next trip was over the Somme
battlefields, and the conditions favorable
for observation, so we were given several
points to pay special attention to, the
two chief being, " How much more diffi-
cult it is to locate an object when flying
low, i.e., from 500ft..t0 1500 ft., than when
flying from 1500 ft. to 5000 or 7000 ft.," and
the "resemblance of the open,cultivated
country to a chess-board, and with what
ease an observer can pick up an unatural
feature." The first point was clearly
demonstrated to us at 7000 ft. and brought
back atr anything from 500 to 1000 ft.
When at a greater height various well-
known places were picked up with ease,
but at the lesser height over the same
country the same thing cotild not be done.
*The second point teanhes an important
lesson, i.e., to conceal an object most
effectively it must blend with the sur-
rounding features, care being taken not
to create an unnatural shadow, as this
shows up clearly in air photos.
At one stage we were flying at 7000ft-
above a huge bank of cloud, and the
pilot decided to turn for home and to
dive to a lower level. Wo descended to
2000 ft. through a dense cloud, not a very
pleasant experience, as when you are iti
the cloud you can only see for about
thirty yards, and the air j� very moist.
When we landed the machine had ice all
along the leading parts of the planes and
the front edges of the struts.
On our third trip the programme was
for a scout machine to engage an artillery
'plane, the observer in the latter being
armed with a Lewis gun containing a
camera, which snapped the opposing
scout, and thus registered the capability
of the observer as a gunner. This was
most exciting, and clearly showed the
advantage that a scout, wiih its greater
speed and firing through the propeller,
has over the artillery 'plane, also it
demonstrated the amount of cover the
opposing scout, well handled, can get
from the body of the 'plane which it is
attacking when the attack is conducted
from a lower level. Thus a " low " flying
machine robs the bast scout of the oppor-
tunity to dive and manoevre, and crea+es
one reason why low-flying machines
must be engaged by ground fire. Another
reason being that the lower a machine
is flying the harder it is to locate from a
higher level, especially if the upper sur-
face is painted a dark color and the
machine is flying over broken and shelled
ground.
Pilots say that the noise of rifle and
machine gun fire directed against them
is very evident to a height of from
2000 ft. to 2500 ft., and has a most deter-
ring influence. ??E.T.B,

REGIMENTAL FUNDS.
f ?-
The matter of Regimental Funds in a
Battalion concerns each member, and a
short article describing the working of
same will probably be of interest to all.
King's Regulations provides for the pro-
per and legitimate expenditure of the
fund, and the auditing of same. Such
moneys can only be utilised for the bene-
fit of troops and the purchase of necessary
articles for Battalion use, which are not
provided by any Army Supply Depart-
ment.
The chief source of our receipts has
been the canteen profits and donations.
The latter has come entirely to the 6th
A.I. Brigade Depot. Up till six months'
ago only an intermittent system of
battalion canteen was in vogue. Since
then, however, thanks to the energetic
working of our Padre and an efficient
staff, there has.been a constant revenue
received.' The goods are purchased at
E.F. canteens, ,who allow five per cent,
discount to battalions, fihe latter charge
E.F.O. prices, and it is surprising the
revenue that accrues and the amount of
turnover.
On a glance at the cash book covering
the past six months items will be seen
as follows:
On the receipts side Battalion canteen
profits show as totalling. �207 19s Bd.
Divisional canteen .profits account for
the very tidy amount of �73 16s lid, and
6th Brigade funds, �B7 10s. (Total for
1917, from this source, �ll2 10s.) The
Battalion paper is responsible for �2B
10s, which readers will agree is a very
creditable result.
On the expenditure side of the ledger
the main items appearing are Xm.as
dinners, �6l 125.; band (instruments
and music), L2B 6s 6.d; sporting material,
L2B. 16s Primus stoves, L 27 ; Battalion
sports trophies, L 3 5; contributions to
Brigade sports, Lll ; grant to companies
(augmenting company funds), L 29 2s.
The battalion paper has proved such a
successful journalistic venture, despite
adverse circumstances, that it has been
decided to make improvements and
alterations in its production, reference
to which is made on the front page.
Battalion Sports Trophies:?These
have been ordered, and delay in arrival is
probably due to transport congestion.
Company Grants: ?This is an in-
novation of the last three months. The
principle of helping those who help
themselves has been observed, and each
company (in all five) was supplemented
in its mess funds to the extent of Ll
16s 8d per fortnight. This company
fund has been a great benefit, inasmuch
as it secures vegetables and other little
extras above and separate from rhe
ration issue. It has been found that
where company funds have been organ-
ised, the small contribution of 5d per
week stimulates the interestofeach man
in his own company and its welfare, and
proves ample for requirements. There
is no doubt as to the appreciation of the
men, and their recognition of full value
in return.
In conclusion it might be mentioned
that a proposal is on foot, with a view
to the allocation of a portion of regi-
mental funds in two directions, both of
which proposals will, When fully out-
lined, will meet with the hearty ap-
proval of every man in the Battalion.

Do you ever pause when the dawn is
breaking ?
Do you falter not when the earth is
shaking?
When your eyes grow dim, and your
limbs are aching,

Do you sometimes flinch when the sun
is shining
Through the wreaths of smoke that are
upward twining
From the bursting shells where the
shrapnel's whining,
Stretcher-Bearer ?
Do you halt when the shades of night
are creeping
O'er the fields, where Death is the har-
vest reaping,
When the call goes forth, do we find you
sleeping?
Streicher-Bearer ?
Tho' you work alone 'mid the din appal-
ling,
While your comrades brave like the
leaves are falling,
You will never fail while a voice is
calling?

LINE DOINGS.
?_9
After a week's gruelling work at
draining the trenches forward, whose
condition would have made Noah think
seriously, had he been there, of casting
around for another ark, the Battalion
moved into the line.
After the boys had left the vicinity of
the tunnelled hill, the Hun sent over a
few heavies, but didn't succeed in
" crumping " anyone.
The voyage in was without incident-
The gum boots showed an increased ten-
dency to remain embedded in the mire.
A stretcher bearer, using his stretcher as
an alpinstock during a halt, found it re-
fused xo budge from the ground. A sym-
pathetic creature asked the very neces-
sary question?'" Say, Digger, what d'ye
carry them stretchers for ?"
After delving the mud from around his
gear, he shook his hand free from " the
Slough of Despond," and replied with a
sarcasm made pointed by the biting wind
-"Don't know, 'cept suppose some of
you blighters faint from the heat."
Once the line was taken over the active
policy of draining and reclaiming was
proceeded with, and the first night alone
saw big improvements effected, while
simultaneously tracks were laid in the
back areas and approaches which greatly
facilitated the work of the various carry-
ing and ration parties, whose work
throughout was beyond praise. On suc-
ceeding nights T heads were constructed
from some posts, others were drained
until as one private put it" you could
take off your boots without feeling wet-
footed."
A party from D Coy erected wire along
the front with almost ?magic celerity.
After the inter Coy. relief, when C and
D took over from A and B, work proceeded
with the same precision and dispatch,
works officer Lieut. Jenkins directing
the efforts of the various parties.
The health of the battalion throughout
was splendid. Capt. H. J. Orr, tho' even
then suffering from the illness which
later caused his evacuation, performed
sterling work. The co-operation of offi-
cers and men in care of the feet was
admirable. The C.O. was a radiating
centre of cheerfulness, and his daily
visit to the line, with the Adjutant, was
eagerly anticipated by all ranks. Trying
conditions told on his health, and our 2nd
in command (Major W. J. Bateman)
carried on for the remaining 3 days.
The only casualty was Lieut. W. J.
Simpson, a popular and capable officer,
who was severely wounded while
organising his men in the front line dur-
ing a heavy minneu-werfer bombard-
ment. The weather was as fickle as the
average madameoiselle, and the boys
stuck it out in the veiy best spipit.
