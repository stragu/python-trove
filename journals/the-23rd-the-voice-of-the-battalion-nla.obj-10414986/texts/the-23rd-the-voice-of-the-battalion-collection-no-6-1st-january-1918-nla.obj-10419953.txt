THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION
No. 6. JANUARY 1, 1918, Price, Twopence.
THE WEEKLY WHIRLIGIG.
?+ ?
Here endeth a week of festivities,
dinners and jollification galore. Head-
quarters commenced the attack, and put
up such a barrage of good things that it
was hard to get thro'. A Company
followed, and each Company and Trans-
port, in its turn, did something great in
the cuisine line. The battle of viands
finished on Christmas niglrt, when the
Officers held their Christmas feast, and
the Sergeants did Likewise in a manner
reflecting the spirit of the Battalion.
It was a merry time?other units
assisting in the harmony?and everybody
enjoyed ihemselves to the fullest. So
much in contrast to last year, when our'
Yule-Tide was spent in the line, without
even the chance of exchanging good-
wishes one with the other. Officers
and men joined in the revelries, and an
attachment has grown that will surely
never be broken.
To cap the proceedings we had our
first real snowfall on Christmas night,
which cast a cold but. beautiful mantle
over all things. Needless to say it
didn't damper the ardor of the boys, who
readily availed themselves of the
opportunity to indulge in the vigorous
sport of snow-balling as a-grand finale.
VERSE?AND WORSE.

'? THE DARK BEFORE THE DAWN."
When shadows fall at evening, and all
the world is grey,
When th� chill night's winds are wailing
at the closing of the day,
There's a whisper from the land of sun-
set, faint, and far away,
The voice of those that died before the
dawn.
When the tempest-driven cloud-banks
scud across the darkened sky,
When earth is black with shadows, that
tell the day is nigh,
Above the rustling tree-tops you can
bear their swelling cry,
The voice of those that struggle at the
dawn.
Look where the East is paling; look
where the first glad ray
Shines indts dawning splendours on the
hills so far away,
Hear ye the shout of victory that greets
the rising day 1
The voice of those that triumph with the
dawn. ??l. M.
At a recent parade of bull-dogs in Mel-
bourne a prize-winner was curiously
named " Adenough." Appropriate, eh?
We know some humans whom the name
would suit.


XMAS FESTIVITIES
No Xmas in the history of the batt-
alion?'and it is already establishing a
a history of Xraases has been so inter-
esting as that of 1917, Circumstances
permitted a definite programme to be
carried out, a programme that brought
all in touch with each other. This was
done through the company dinners.
They began a week before Xmas day
when Headquarters opened the bill, and
finished on Monday 24th inst., when the
Transport regaled themselves on turkey
and beer. There is one person qualified
to give an opinion on the merits of each
dinner. Major Smith, who in the capa-
city of C.0., attended them all. His
gigantic frame alone could have stood
the severe strain. There were other
officers -?such' as Capt, Bsith, our acting
second in> command'?who also " swelled
wifeibly " during that eventful week.
Arrangements were carried out by
each Company. The men put in so
many francs per heads? it. was- left to
their own decision ?the officers and
N.C.O.s added their quota, and battalion
funds paid out halt a franc for each franc
contributed. The result was a tidy sum
-of nearly 1000 francs that enabled a most
excellent dinner to be provided. It was
fortunate we were not in England for the
food controller would have frowned fier-
cely at the elaborate menus. A word of
warm praise is due to all company cooks
who worked together with a good will that
entirely echoed the Season's message.
Tiia menu cards were all designed and
printed at our Battalion Press. We have
not yet heard a grumble from any one in
the battalion as to the success of each
dinner. Many factors contributed to their
excellence. For one thing the canteen
hut was large enough to hold 200 men
with plenty of space for the band and
the second room for serving. It was
warmed by two stoves and several braz-
iers and hung with blankets to keep out
the cold. The weather was certainly
seasonable. Where the fuel was obiained
it was wise not to enquire too closely.
If Australian soldiers can't get fuel there
must be few in the British army who
can. A story may throw some light on
tha means employed. A sentry was on
guard over a coal dump when a soldier
approached with the obvious intention of
net going away empty. " Can I have a
sack, mate," he asked the sentry.
"You're making it a bit of a welter, dig-
ger," replied the man on guard." can't
you come along after dark."
There was no dinner complete without
a few toasts. The King's health came
first, and there was sadness in "Fallen
comrades," drunk in silence. " Absent
Friends" were not forgotten, and that in-
cluded Col. Brazenor, whose absence was
regretted keenly. These dinners, ex-
pressing such good feeling throughout
the battalion were dear to his heart.
And it was due to his suggestion that
they were initiated. The cooks were
not forgotten when words of apprecia-
tion were spoken. One cook informed
his company that his head cook thought
himself " Gr.O.C. cooks," and " if that is
so," he said, " then I'm C.O. of cooks."
(Loud cheers and laughter). Concert
programmes followed the dinners. One
or two companies were fortunate in get-
ting some of the Anzac Coves. They gave
the professional touch.
The writer was not so fortunate as the
Major in receiving an invitation to al!
the dinners, so cannot supply details of
each event. No doubt each company
claimed to have supplied the best dinner.
We heard that the Transport turned out
a most appetising meal, but then so did
A, B, C and D Coys., not to mention

Headquarters. But it was the comrade-
hip that made the success of these din-
ners, a comradeship among all ranks.
But tho' everyone enjoyed the week, no
one, even in the height of enjoyment,
was heard to say " May we have many
more." When the next Xmas comes
may we be by our own firesides or out in
the gloribus bush. That was the thought
in all minds.
Other Xmas festivities included the
Sergeant's dinner on Xmas day. The
decorations were delightfully vivid. We
learn that they came from Paris, bought
by Serg. Phillips. But it was evident he
must have been accompanied by one of
the gentle sax. The decorations bore
evidence of a woman's taste. And surely
he was right. Their dinner was a bril-
liant example of the cuisine d'art. Its
length promised to carry them thro' the
night. But they were heard serenading
the officers about midnight, so doubtless
it finished by then.
The officers also held their Xmas din-
ner on that night. That it was a
thorough success was evident by the
sound of bagpipes and drums that floated
thro' the camp as the officers paraded to
the Sergeant's mess. They sang their
goodwill to the strains 61 "The Cock of
the North," and departed for fresh fields
and pastures now. And that concluded
our Xmas festivities. Vfie had no holi-
days, but in our leisure hours made up
for the absence from home and the holi-
days we were used to in the old days be-
fore the war carried us ali 12,000 miles
away from home.
HEADQUARTERS' DINNER.
On Tuesday Dec. 18th H.Q. details set
the ball rolling. Without a doubt the
event was an unqualified success. Hearts
were opened and tongues loosed when
the good things came round the tables.
Tho cooks excelled themselves and the
guests (Major Smith, Capts, Beith and
Dawson) were well looked after, arid, ex-
pressed their unbounded admiration at
the excellent repast provided. As to
what the boys themselves thought one
had only to look around to see content-
ment and jsviality on every face. H.Q.
officers were fully represented, except for
our C.O. The N.C.Qs ware well served
at their table by R.S.M. Woodlands. In
facvhe proved an old hand at fair dis-
tribution of good things. The men
rolled up in force, and the remark was
overheard that such a largo " parade " of
H.Q. had never been seen before. When
the plum pudding had been made to look
" properly silly," and the toast of Tho
King honored, the following musical
programme was gone through March,
Band; songs by Bdsman Robertson, Cpl.
Clough, Pfce. Hertz, 21st Battn., Pfce
Schultz, and humorous items by Cps. Lee
and Streeter, 21st, and Romaine. The
event wound up with a vote of thanks,
proposed by Lieut. Fethars, to the
cooks, Ptes. Stobus and Trevena, also tho
waiters, helpers, Press, and musical
contributors, which was carried v?ith
true Australian vigor.
A. COMPANY.
A company's dinner followed, and it
Was great too. Improvements were
made in the warming arrangements, and
the hut was comfy indeed. A. number of
visiting officers graced th� guests'
table, and Capt. Moss presided over a
merry crowd, while the band played the
dinner accompaniments.
After a barrage of edibles fit for a
Prince had been gone through, and th�
King's health duly drunk, the President,
with kindly thought, remembered it was
the anniversary ofPte Trewartha's birth-
day, and asked the bays to ? drink his
jolly good health. It was done with
with right good feeling too, and musical
honors.
Immediately this incident had passed
and the honor had been acknowledged,
Capt. Moss expressed the hope that
January Ist. THE TWE^TY-TfllM�.

that they would enjoy the dinner. He
made reference to the two cups won by
the Battalion, and to A company's prom-
inent position in the sports results. Every
man had done his bit, and the old plod-
ders had stuck to it well. The dinner
was one of the best, and in thanking the
cooks he recognised the difficulties in
connection with such an undertaking,
He also thanked the committee of two
N.C.Os, two men and an officer who got
such good value for four francs a man.
He remarked that the cup fer A Co., and
the medals were on the way, and would
probably be presented at a future dinner.
Would they now drink a combined toast
to the competitors, cooks, and all who
had helped The toast was drunk with
musical honors, and cheers tollowed.
Pte. Salisbury expressed his appreci-
ation, and that ofPtes Egan, Pinnel and
Mills, his cuisine associates, fof the
toast, and said they were all glad to do
their best for the company.
Serg. Toiman responded on behalf of
the competitors, and in turn proposed
Capt Moss' health. This toast was
drunk heartily, the captain responding in
a few suitable words. Items by Sgts.
Wiidows and Smith, Cpls Romaine and
.Lee, and Ptes Hertz, Robertson, Rix,
Trowartha and Smith finished the
evening.
B COMPANY.
This company's "night out" was
another great success to those concerned.
The capacity of the hut was taxed to its
utmost in meeting the accommodation
of the assemblage. The dinner was en- 1
livened by those present joining in the
popular airs rendered by the band, and
good fellowship reigned supreme. Lieut.
Jenkins officiated in the chair, and
Major Smith, Capt. Beith, Adjt. Dawson
and other visiting officers participated
in the evening's revelry. Between the
' concert items Capt. Hinchliffe tendered
thanks to Sgt. Foote, Pte. Lillicoe and
Lieut. Jenkins for their successful
efforts as a committee. The cooks, the
band, A Coy. and the artists were also
eulogised by the Captain for their share
in the suceess of the evening. T.
Macauley, on behalf of the culinary
staff (R. Walker, L. McQueen and T.
Price), said what they had done had been
a pleasure, and would be so on any other
occasion.
There was hardly a dull moment in
the concert programme, rendered by
Sgt. Widdows, Bandsman Robertson,
Cpl. Lee, W.O. Baxter, Dr iver Lindsay,
Pte. Ryan, Sgt. McClure, L.-cpl. Martin,
Pte. McQueen, and last but not least,
Driver Gilchrist and L.-cpl. Chisholm,
whose duets and individual items de-
manded repeated encores. Cpl. Berndt
as usual, proved an efficient pianist.
C COMPANY.
The above. company provided the
fourth wave in the battle of feasts, and
by this time the objectives are becoming
easy matters. Decorations had been
added to, and dainty serviettes gave a re-
fined aspect to the dinner tables. Lieut.
Short presided and the C.O., Capts. Beiih
and Moss and other guests surrounded
him. The band as usual, led the charge,
and as soon as such obstacles as roast
pork, fish, pudding, swoets and savories
had been cleared, Royalty was honored at
the request of S.M. Kilgour,
Capt. Beith then spake unto his com-
mand, and in pointed words said one and
all would surely agree it was a success
fui function. The success was due to
the work of a number of persons ; firstly
to the committee headed b.y Corp. La-
rnonde, who undertook 110 light matter.
Then the cooks were to be very highly
commended; also Corp. Romaine as or-
ganiser of the concert party, the band

and the waiters from D company. He
proposed their healths conjointly, and
asked them to put their hands together
in recognition, After Ptes. Darcy and
T. O'Connor had acknowledged the toast
en behalf of themselves and Ptes. Wall
and McGrath, Sgt. Foley proposed " Ab-
sent Friends," which embraced our
absent C.O. Melody supplied by the
following filled in the balance of the
night, with Lieuf. Short as M.C.?Ptes.
Hertz, Sheppard (22nd), Cpls. Romaine,
Lee and Bandsman Robertson. The
Anzac Coves were represented by Sgt.
Gannon, |Cpl. H. Shaw, L.-Cpl. Frank
Crossley, Ptes. Ross, Ben Davies and
Fred Reade, who received a great
ovation.
D COMPANY
Still another ridge of comestibles to be
taken and held, and this was success-
fully attacked by tlie above company, on
the night of 22nd. Lieut. Love chair-
maned the function','' and as on previous
nights, a number of guests were present
fey invitation, including the M.O, and
Q.M., and Capt Farrell. Immediately
after the toast of the King. ; had been
drunk, the chairman announced that on�
of the co's favorite officers,'Lt. McSwiney,
had sent his good wishes to them, also
that the 2nd Army Commander had for-
warded the season's compliments to ali
ranks, and wished them success in the
1918 campaign.
Capt. Galbraith took the opportunity
to thank the cooks, Ptes Ingram, Kelly,
Conway, and Grubb, the committee, Corp
Lamonde, the performers, in fact all the
boys who had been so united in helping
towards success. They would no doubt
remember the dinner for many days to
come.
Then there was music, mirth and mel-
ody by members of the Anzac Cores,
Q.M.S. Parsons, Sgts. Widdows and
? Milne, Cpa. Harris, D.S.C., Romaine, and
. Pts Lee and Robertson.
TRANSPORT.
We are nearing the end of a week of
Xmas frepasts, and last, but not lea�t
of the company dinners was the above.
Lieut. Hume commanded, and the acting
C.0., occupied a seat among the guests,
After the feast, Serg. Wright and the rest
drank to the King, and Capt. Farrell pro-
posed The Guests, remarking that it was
a pleasure to have them at the table.
Major Smith, acknowledged the toast,
and then personally congratulated the
cooks on providing one of the best din-
ners he had eaten. He thought it a fair
thing if, now that the Transport had fil-
led them with good things, they brought
their limbers round to take the guests
home. (Laughter.) He congratulated
the battalion on winning the football
cup, and thanked them all for his recep-
as a " foreigner " in the 23rd.
Gapt Beith added his praise and com-
pliments to the eooks (Ptes Ely and Wil-
son), waiters and helpers, and so did Lt.
Dodgshun.
Ops. Lee and Romaine, and Ptes Jones,
Shepherd, and Hertz provided an excel-
exaellont musical programme.
SERGEANTS' MESS.
Christmas night was a gala night in
the Mess. Dinner was served at six
o'clock, and was a triumph |of culinary
art, covering ten courses. Nothing but
praise could be found for those who pre-
pared it. The contents of the bon-bons,
which were opened during the meal,
caused much hilarity. It was regretted
that duty prevented some members from
attending. After the toast of the King
Sgt. Foote proposed " The Battalion,"
and gave a brief resume of its doings
since leaving Australia., Jt hal the
honor of gaining all objectives, holding

them without retiring. It may have
been our good fortune, but it's a tact.
The battalion had also distinguished it-
self in sport, as the possession of three
silver cups proved.
"'Fallen Pals " was entrusted to Q.M.S,
Parsons, who feelingly referred to com-
rades who had fallen, and quoted " Grea-
ter love hath no man than to lay down his
life for his friend." The toast was drunk
in silence.
R.-S.M. Woodland proposed "The
Mess," and outlined its history since in-
ception last April. It had created a fel-
lowship that would last. The C.O, and
Adjutant had given their support, and
granted every reasonable concession.
The toast was received with acclamation.
During the evening a visit was paid
by the Acting C.0., second in command,
and Adjutant, who in a few remarks com-
plimented all on the decorations.
A concert, by sergeants present and
members of the brigade party followed,
and " Auid Lang Syne " was sung at mid-
night.'-I'' Eat, drink and be merry, for
to-morrow ' Que Savoir.'"
�FFICEES' MESS.
$
Since our last issue the most interest-
ing event in our mess has been the Xmas
festivities. At breakfast we had the
presents from friends in Australia, sent
through the Australian Comforts Fund.
Each officer had a box containing small
articles and comestibles. The fun was
in learning who had given the pleasant
reminder of home affection. In the even-
ing we had our dinner. The menu would
have frightened the British Food Con-
troller, and its quantity was no more
than the quality. The evening opened
quietly, but under the influence of the
good cheer, tongues grew talkative.
When the toast " absent friends, sweet-
hearts and wives" was reached Xmas
goodwill was flowing through the mess.
Capt. Galbraith was seen to offer a toast
to two Parisienne "pictures who decor-
ated the mantlepiece. The doctor sur-
passed himself in geniality. There wero
few members to whom he did not offer
his glass. Major Smith found the bat-
talion good feeling as fine a compliment
as could be desired. And he spoke as
" a stranger who had become a friend."
Of the Football Cup he said " You thor-
oughly deserved to win it," (loud cheers.)
And then all present drank champagne
from that famous cup. A jheavy fall of
snow had whitened the ground during
dinner. The opportunity for a fight was
irresistible. Lieut. Roxburgh led an
attack on the msss, and in a short time
the room was as heavy in snow as the
ground outside. A visit with bagpipes
and drum to rhe Sergeants' mess, later
to a neighboring battalion, finished an
exceedingly happy evening. And there
were some sore heads in the morning.
A bevelled mirror?brought by Lieut.
Lowe from a dugout in the line?now
adorns the mess. While it was being-
put up Capt. Galbraith walked in, He
stood _ for a moment admiring the
reflection, and exclaimed "Hullo! old
chap. Who are you? By Jave, its
Gal. Come and have a drink, old man."
And they had two.
It is with regis t that we announce
Captain Dawson's departure for England
to try his fortune in the Indian Army,
Shall we no longer hear his jovial "By
Jove, that's d ?? d funny"? And to
whom shall we go for initiation into tie
delights of feminine beauty. We shall
indeed be a sad battalion. But we "wish
him " bon voyage." If there are flashing
scuitars to be carried and dashing
dangers to be ridden in his.new army,
we are sure Capt. Dawson will acquit
himself well. But what is to become
of the fur-collared coat ?

competition in one ward as to which offi-
cer can get up with the most pained ex-
pression. It is rep'ofted Lieut. Torode is
an easy winner. Who would have thought
that?
Lieut. Hislop is on duty as Divisional
Bombing Officer. He rides his horse
with all the ease of a bushman, although
he hails from a seaport of Melbourne.
It is a pleasure to see him handling his
explosive material. He does it with
the affection that a child has for its toy.
He handles detonators with the pleas-
ure one sees him drink his favorite tonic.
The mantle of Elijah has fallen on
Elisha. Lieut. Short has taken over sec-
ret irial duties from Lieut. Anderson, who
has gone to a school. Kindly pray that
he may prove as efficient and tactful.
Capt. Noail sends his greetings. He is
doing well, and expects to be boarded
very soon.
' Congratulations to Captain Beith on
the attainment of his majority.
A cable was forwarded to Colonel Bra-
zenor conveying New Year greetings
from all ranks.
FAREWELL TO CAPI. DAWSON.
A farewell dinner to Capt. Dawson,
who left on Dec, 31st for London, where
he has been nominated for entering into
the Indian Army, took place in the offi-
cers' mess on- the previous evening. In
well chosen warmly expressed words
Major Smith dwelt on the fine work done
by Capt. Dawson as company comman-
der, and later as Adjutant. He had won
the respect and affection of all ranks.
Captain Dawson showed signs of deep
emotion in his reply to the toast. Ho
spoke of the affection that ripens between
men who have lived in the line together.
He came as an intruder into the 23rd,
but he left it the personal friend of every
officer in the battalion. He would not
say he did not wish to go, but his affec-
tion for if would always be with him.
XMAS. GIFTS.
As children we all hung up our stock-
ings on Christmas Eve, and woke early
in exquisite expectation of finding new
toys and treasures, A recollection of
those days was given us this Christmas
through the happy thoughtfulness of the
Australian Comforts Fund. Early in the
week Mr Norris informed the battalion
that Christmas gifts were to hand for
each officer and O.R. in the battalion.
Would we send in a timber to fetch
them? Would we? Why the horse
nearly fell over in his eagerness to bring
back the presents. On Xmas Eve the
men opened their boxes finding a variety
of articles that help to fill out a soldier's
scanty rations. It seemed that all Vic-
toria had united in a thought for the
" soldier boys." There were plum pud-
dings, woollen mufflers, Tommy cookers,
cocoa and milk, etc. So our Xmas was
made brighter by the affectionate thought
of those in Victoria who sent these wel-
come gifts. The battalion unites in its
hearty thanks to them all.
