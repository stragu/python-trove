GREETINGS.
The following extracts from a letter
written to the Colonel shy Capt. Dawson,
now with the Indian Army, will no
doubt prove interesting: ?He says
"We. arrived safely at Bombay, and
after lingering there for 24 hours started
on a journey of 1500 miles to the frontier
station, Kohat. This occupied three
days and four nights. Travelling in
this country is different to anything I
had yet seen. The train compartments
are huge, and usually have four beds in
them- There are electric fans and bath-
rooms, one each of the latter for ladies
and gentlemen. The four of us from
the old Brigade all came out together,
but were split up on arrival at Bombay.
Lloyd went to Lahore, Bunning to
Quetta, Cawthorn to Bannu, and he is
the nearest of the two to me, some 80
miles away. I was very fortunate in-
deed to be posted to a splendid regiment
of the Frontier Force.
The regiment has been twice on
service abroad during the war, once to
France, and once to East Africa, and we
expect to go out again in the near future.
The station is a very pretty one Indeed,
and has the reputation of being one of
the best in India. It is situated a>t the
foqt of the ranges, which form part of the
nor.tli-west frontier of India, between us
and Afgbanstan. There are three Infan-
try regiments and one of Cavalry in the
Brigade.
I was delighted to find that the Brigade-
Major vyas Major Wylly, Y.C ~ who used
to be on the Corps Staff, so I am not al-
together frjendless. Strange to relate
this station was at one time under the
command of General Birdwood, and the
foundation stone at the entrance porch
of the church was laid by him. There
are two Australians here, one named
Barclay, in the 109 th Infantry, and
another, Boileau, in the 37th Lancers.
I note in the cables that the Bosclie is
keeping you busy, and I read with pride
that the Australians' work and valor was
" magnificent," to quote the cables own
words. I sincerely trust that you and the
dear old 23rd are quite O.K. It seems
incredible to read of the fall of Baiileul,
as it is not so very long since I was in
hospital there.
Best wishes and good luck to the
regiment."
TANK AND AEROPLANE.
Just as King Sol was rising from his
couch in the Orient, and after the "'orri-
ble 'Och " had been routed from a certain
portion of " le bon Dieu's " fair domain in
the recent " over the bags " exploit, the
" caterpillary " female tank, " Mabel,"
came in her long, rolling, nautical stride
(not exactly a lady-like deportment) along
our advanced line, looking for a bit of ex-
citement,, she being at the time well
primed up, but there was " naught doin' "
so jauntily swinging round, the modem
Amazon arrogantly pratted her huge
frame toward the other heavy stuff, in-
cluding the "bull" tanks 'way back, and
it was an exceedingly pretty sight to see
one of our airmen gracefully glide his
'plane down alongside, evidently to con-
vey felicitations for elephantic work
accomplished, and continued to be her
light fantastic partner for some consider-
able distance. It was a significant sight
to see these wonders of the " blue eth-
ereal " and " terra firma" promenading
in what was' before the sun sank in the
Occident, the previous evening, "Ko
Man's Land.'"-* C.P.

TO OUR ALLY.
" Vive la France ! "
Nation of gallant men
aii d noble women;
We Australians greet
you on your annual
fete day, and join the
other nations fighting
with you and with us
in a fervent hope that
by the 'help of the
Omnipotent your
next great national
day wi 11 be celebrated
with the flags of vic-
tory flying from every
flagstaff, as the sym-
bols of a promise
fulfilled, viz., to fight
on until the end for
freedom, peace and
honor. As united
have we been in our travail for Humanity's . sake, so should we remain
in staunch friendship thro' happier times ?welded closely by the suffer-
ings of a long four years of warfare.


THE FUTURE.
Luring the last, week Australians out
pf the line were addressed by Messrs.
W. M. Hughes and Joseph Cook, who
are representing Australia at the Imperial
War Conference. Both our statesmen
received a splendid and attentive hearing.
Particularly were their utterances appre-
ciated when they gave the assurance
that Australia had at heart the true and
best interests of the fighting men when
they returned to their- Homeland. Thi s
note struck deeper than the expressions
of pride in our achievements which were
also conveyed by our representatives on
behalf of Australia,
The fighting man, who has come
away and is paying the price of liberty,
realises more than ever the great
heritage which is his to enjoy when he
returns to take up his duties as a citizen.
Let us one and all keep in mind our
duties and responsibilities to our Sunny
Land, and realise the power we may
wield as citizens in shaping the future
destiny of Australia. ? W. B.

- GENERALITIES. -
Lieut. Torode and Lieut. Geo. Hay ward
rccupy neighboring cot? in a London
War Hospital. Both doing well.
We have heard from our late M.0., Dr.
Orr. The "little Doc."' is O.K. and
wishes us well.
Lieut. Val. Roxburgh is now on a
Training Brigade in the " Old Dart."
S.M, Foley has been given a Com-
mission in the field. So has Cpl.
Burke. General opinion? well-earned.
Lieut. F. Holdsworth is at a Corps
School. So is Sgt. "Robbie," D.C.M.
The 6th Brigade magazine, the
organ of the Melbourne branch
Australian Comforts Fund is
to hand. It quotes liberally
from our columns.
The preliminary barrage put i
up in the recent stunt was gen-
erally voted one of the best yet
presented to the enemy. One
of our officers described it as
" beautiful," and envied the
daring airmen hovering above for
" having a better view."
In the valuation of salvage for
the weekly period ours was high-
est with a dip into the three
figures.
We have to thank Lieut. P.
Harris, of " Aussie," for providing
us with a number of blocks appear-
ing in our last issue.
Much surprise was evinced when
'planes were seen dropping ammun-
ition to our advancing meu, the
other day, A greater surprise was that of
a party of A Coy.'s warriors. They had
captured an outpost, and after a time an
enemy 'plane came along and kindly
left witli the newcomers the previous
occupants' rations.
After the football match, Brigade
officers (three per battalion) dined with
the officers of the 74th Zouaves, and an
interesting and enjoyable evening was
spent, notwithstanding -the diffi-
culties of conversation.
The C.O, is ; again Act-
ing Brigadier. Premier
� # O
place in the battalion is
being filled by Colonel
McKenzie.
The G.0.C., on his recent
visit, was perfectly frank in
his remarks in reference to
relief, etc. His candohr
was appreciated too.
Capt. Clues, whose inter-
est in the battalion is un-
doubted, has been instru-
mental in securing quite a
quantity of useful material.
Thanks.
Major Melntyre, M.O;,
who for a long time lielpdd
to alleviate our bodily ills
and aches, is in charge df
of an adjacent C.C..S, so
we are told.
The boys much appreciate
the "tanks'' on their Hun-
routing excursions. Their
ugly appearance and ungainly
movement are in themselves
sufficient to put the " wind
up," but when their " for'ard" belches
into a tiame of spitting slaughter, our
sympathies should be with the enemy.

FISH AND FISHERMEN.
Still the craze increases, and finny
specimens, large and small, continue to
be caught.
The usual number of whoppers have
been missed during the period.
The honor of capturing the champion
has been rudely wrested from us by an
ardent angler of another unit.
Still in aggregate weight of fish, we
are well in the running.
The palm for anglership has been
willingly given to the interpreter of a
sister He is recognised as a
past-master of the art.
Our Padre has had one or two tries
with the rod and line. But his patience
is not of the kind that endureth.
" Mull," of the transport, has created a
new departure by securing a couple of
elusive eels. Guess Dad " had t some
job in preparing same " a la somor.
Exchange of fish stories are now of
nightly occurrence, and, of course, the
Murray cod tales predominate. It is an
old recognised fact that great fishers are
accomplished deviators from the narrow
path of truth, and, listening to the various
experiences of these latter day swingers
of the line, one sadly arrives at the con-
clusion that they are no better than elder
fishers when the world was younger.
There is great secrecy and deceit about
bait, forcing writer, who seldom mounts
Pegasus, to blossom into verse, thus ;
If you lie about bait, remember thy lips
are sealed, ,
And the brand of a fish is upon him by
whom is the secret revealed.
If there be trouble to fishers, and truth ot
the brightest can clear,
Lie, while you have the bait, or a fishei-
man is alive to fiear.

CONGRATULATORY.
;The following messages have been re-
ceived by the Battalion in reference to
its successful action early this month:"
From Commander-in-Chief British
Armies , in France and G.O.C. Fourth
Army
"Will you please convey to Lieutenant-
General Sir John Monash and all ranks
under his command, including the tanks
and the detachment of rd American
Division, my warm congratulations on
the success which attended the operation
carried out this morning, and on the
skill and gallantry with which it was
conducted."
" In forwarding this message, the Army
Commander desires most heartily to con-
gratulate the Australian Corps, and
especially on the way in which the
scheme was drawn up, and the gallantry
with which the operation was carried
out. The part played by the tanks and
the artillery was a prominent factor in
bringing about success, and reflects great
credit on them-"
The following letter was sent to the
Brigade Commander by General Sir W.
Bird wood:"
" Just a line of heartiest congratula-
tions on the good work carried out by
your brigade in the completely successful
operation yesterday morning. Evidently
things could not possibly have gone
better, and the greatest credit is due to
yo,u and every lpan .concerned in it. I
sliall.be so, grateful .if you will pass on
my very hearty congratulations both to
battalion commapaers and all their
men."
From O.C? nd Australian Div. Signal
Company, to the Colonel:
" I have written to the th Inf. Brigade
in the endeavour to express the appre.
ciation of the Signal Service for the
work performed by the officers and men
of your battalion upon cable burying
whilst in the present area.
The standard of work performed, and
the rapidity with which the tasks were
effected, has yet to be excelled."
From Major-General C. Rosenthal,
commanding nd Australian Division :
My heartiest congratulations to
yourself and your brigade."
THE BAND VISII
On an invite from American comrades,
the band "hiked" to co-operate in
the celebration of France's Day recently.
A short pleasant trip brought the pur-
veyors of crochets and quavers to the
scene of festivities?a neighboring camp.
After an exchange of greetings, and a
cup or two of cheering fluid, everybody
was in festive mood-
The band played a march for a pipe
opener, and then proceeded to dispense
that rag-time melody so dear to Yankee
hearts. They joined in the chorus songs
in a most appreciative and wholehearted
way. Gounod's " Faust " was then ren-
dered for those of the French Army
present, who seemed to prefer the senti-
mental, but after that " rag" held sway
for the balance of the afternoon, the
program being brought to a close by the
rendition of America's own " National
Emblem" march and the French
National Anthem- A few words of
thanks were expressed by a French
soldier, unfortunately not understood,
except by elaborate gestures and gesticu-
lations, which evidently meant to convey
to all present that it had been a most
enjoyable day, and .that Allied unity was
at last very real.

BILL!
Bill joined the battalion during the re-
cent touring duty in the line ; not quite
in the front trench, for I am not sure he
has that courage. But while one of the
companies was in reserve.
He walked into the dug-out while a
couple were playing a game of poker (1
hope the Censor passes this!), and was
immediately invited to make a third, Two
at the game is very dull. As he did not
reply, his silence was understood to mean
consent. He was dealt a hand. " What
are you doing, Bill?'" Still an unper-
turbed silence, "Damn it, man, can't yon
speak ? " " Well, never mind," remarked
the other players, " we'll judge his hand
for him." They did so, and he didn't win
the round. You see, drinks were
and who better to pay for them than Bill.
And Bill didn't seem to mind. He
merely grinned facetiously. And so the
game went on. Bill always had his hand,
but he never made a call. And invariably
he lost. But when all was ready for
settling, he suddenly rose and made as
though to leave. " Where are you going
man," they cried ia chorus. It is said he
muttered something like ravine. But the
word Was'lost ?at all events, it was stated
he walked out with a periscope over his
shoulder. And most of us know the
ravine was in the front line.
And that was Bill's introduction to the
Battalion.
The next day everyone heard of the
mysterious visit. "Have you seen Bill?"
became the universal query. In fact his
presence remains a mystery to this day.
His poker game remains unconfirmed, ex-
cept by those two players.
He is still reported to visit a game of
bridge Or poker. Always in the evenings
when the severity of discipline is relaxed.
Some assert he swims and plays cricket
occasionally. Don't believe it. He hasn't
the courage. Perhaps ho may be seen
making an uneven way to his dug-out at
midnight. Who knows. Still, who
Bill ? anyway.
HOPE
(A Mother's Prayer),
Hope 1 sweet as scent of morning air,
And bright as glistening dew-drop fair;
Hope ! stay beside my darling boy,
And bring him bliss without alloy.
Hope, like a rosebud wet with dew,
Bring him fair dreams which will come true.
Hope ! never leave him night or day,
But from thy brightness send a ray.
Hope, may thy Presence cheer his way
Till he come 3 home again to stay.
Hope, Joy and Peace, blest three abide
With him whatever may betide. M.P-.
Lieutr-Colonel W. Brazenor, D.5.0.,
Commanding Officer, has received the
following congratulatory message frorir
Australian Corps Headquarters Dear-
Sir, The Corps Commander directs me to
thank you very much for the copy of your
Battalion publication which you were so
good as to send him. He read it with
great interest. Yours sincerely, C. N,
Simonson, A.D.C., Australian Corps."
