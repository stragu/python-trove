FISHING!
UNSOLICITED FRIENDSHIP.
A digger had shown some small com-
passion to a German prisoner by giving
him a cigarette and a drink of tea. The
Hun showed a lively sense of gratitude
which he expressed in broken English by
saying "Give me your address in Aus-
tralia and I will write to you after the
war."
"Thanks for nothing," replied the
Australian,
SAUCE.
The password for the night was " Hol-
brook's." A patrol , led by a tired Ser-
geant came back to the trench about
one a.m. "Halt and give the password,*'
cried the alert sentry. " Lea and
Len in's to you," replied the Sergeant, as
he parsed on.
The German who stands by the Kaiser
is safe. He will never be near the Eront.

MONT ST. QUENTIN
It was the Colonel's desire to write a
few words expressing his appreciation
of the work done by the Battalion in the
capture of Mont St. Quentin. But the
many details that require attention after
a " stunt," and his sudden departure on
leave have prevented him from carrying
out his intention. And so the mantle of
Elijah has fallen on Elisha. What is
one to say to such courage and devotion
to duty as men and officers displayed on
that memorable day? Words are but a
faint expression of the emotion felt.
It is interesting to review the congrat-
ulatory messages that have been issued.
Our own Routine Orders are quoted in
extract on the cover page; from Div.
Hdqrs. comes the same appreciation
" The capture of Mont St. Quentin was
an amazing feat, and will rank among
the finest achievements of this war."
From Corps Headquarters?" The cap-
ture of Mont St. Quentin has evoked a
chorus of praise throughout the press of
the world as the finest single feat of the
war." From Army Headquarters ?"The
capture of Mont St. Quentin by the
2nd Divison is a feat of arms worthy of
the very highest praise." There was
something unique about the event. The
attack had many of the elements assoc-
iated with old-time warfare. The long
slope of hill crowned by the terraced
houses of the village gave the picture of
an ancient fortress. The trench at its
base, the disused moat. And the advanee
over open country under the withering
fire of bullets has been reproduced in a
hundred battle pictures. There was
much discomfort wriggling forward on
the stomach, sweating under the load
of the L.G., and aching of neck and
body in the necessity for keeping low.
It must be that those who have died
will know of the glory of their achieve-
ment. The wounded will be bouyed in.
their suffering by the thought of partici-
pation in such a victory. Those who
came thro' untouched are more than
repaid for their hardships and exposure
to danger.

on a health trip to England.


- JULY OPERATIONS. �
After the successful occupation of
enemy trenches in the "Hansel Stunt"
the Battalion advanced: its line by the
gradual appropriation of No Man's Land.
On the night of July Bth-9th it was re-
lieved. Until July 19th the Battalion
lived in the trench- system near Blanghy
Tronville, being engaged in cable bury-
ing during the period of relief from Front
lino work. On that date trenches run-
ning. S>B�- of Villers Bretonneux were
taken over from a sister Brigade. The
position was novel to a degree, scarcely
pleasant. The right flank of C Coy. was
separated only by a road from the enemy,
D Coy. in the centre occupied Syria
trench, held on the left by
Germans, and on the
right A Coy. established
a block under similar
conditions.
The weather during
these days was very un-
certain. Heavy rain ren-
dered the trenches almost
inJpassable. Ration and
carrying parties had an
exceedingly difficult task
in working their way
along the narrow saps leading to the
frontline. On the night of July 21st-22 ! nd
a party of 0 Coy., under Lieut. Baker
was organised- to attack and occupy a
portion of the enemy trench across the
road. It was thought to be lightly held,
but the party found a Company there
with a quota of machine guns. Sur-
prised, the enemy retreated, but reorgan-
ised when they realised the small num-
bers of our party. Some very fine work
was done by C Coy. who drove back the
counter attack with rapid and L.G. fire.
Later the trench was occupied by the
whole Cov.
On July 24th the enemy attempted a
raid on an isolated post held by A Coy,
They succeeded in entering and occupy-
ing it, but later were driven out, leaving
a wounded prisoner in our hands.
Heavy rain continued to fall, rendering
the trenches extremely uncomfortable.
By an unfortunate accidenjt Lieut. Ellis,
6th Field Coy. Engineers, was killed
while laying a tape for sap construction.
And on the same night, July 26tli-27th,
Sgt. Jacques lost his life by the acciden-
tal explosion of a bomb. American
troops were attached to the Battalion
during this time in the line. Although
the new experience left them a little
dazed they were wonder-
fully keen and ready to
learn from the "Diggers."
On the night of July
30th-31st another Bat-
talion in the Brigade re-
lieved our men. But the
rest was only for a brief
period. On August 2nd-3rd
the Battalion moved into
a position north of Villers
Bj-etonneux.
THE ADVANCE,
It was while the Battalion was in the
line this time that it was engaged in the
series of operations that led to the vic-
tory that drove the enemy from their
Villers Bretonneux line right back to
Harbon Villiers. The scene of that ad-
vance was one of extraordinary interest.
The co-operation of all arms, including
the cavalry with their long lances, gave
the impression of tremenduous move-
ment. Lines of prisoners passed tliro*
in the opposite direction, while immense
quantities of war material lay scattered

OFFICERS' MESS.
Lieut. Harry Field is in the 3rd -Lon-
don General Hospital at Wandsworth.
Lucky to get out of it, Harry,
Capt, Poulton, M.0., has left us after
a very brief stay. His place is filled by
Capt. Daniels.
The " Little Doc.,"' otherwise Capt,
Orr, is again amongst the trenches and
shell holes as M.O.
Lieut. Gabriel, according to informa-
tion received, is at No. 5 Rouen,
The last of Capt. Moss to be seen by
the boys was a smile from the front seat
of an ambulance. He directed his mail to
be sent on.
Lieut. Short, whose work in the line
during recent operations needs no com-
ment, had a couple of narrow escapes, A
barrage of bullets forcibly removed his
"tin hat." Nearly a "header'' for
" Shorty."
Genuine regret all through is expressed
at the unfortunate aceident that caused
the death of Capt. Farrell s hack. The
horse was a favorite one indeed, and an
" original," having left Australia with the
boys.

SPORTS.
Considering the weather, and other
things, the Battalion Sports held on a
recent date were successful.. Head-
quartets secured the bulk of the prizes.
The elements caused the postponement of
the Brigade programme for a day, but a
quick-drying wind and sunshine eventually
allowed for a splendid outing and the
carrying out of well-arranged events.
Ideal conditions prevailed for the Divis-
ion meeting, Enthusiasm and keen com-
petition was shown throughout. Detailed
reports will appear in next issue.

over that area. Enemy motor lorries,
guns, trains, and transport fell into Our
hands. It was a paradise for souvenirs,
of which the men made the utmost use.
At the beginning of these operations our
Battalion moved forward in support, but
by August 15th was in the front line
near Herbeville. Under the somewhat
ironic title of "peaceful penetration 1 '
very valuable work was done. To pene-
trate peacefully means to steal ground
from the enemy without preparatory
bombardment, but it does not exclude
the likelihood of enemy opposition. On
August 17th a system of trenches were
cleared by A Coy. under the control of
Capt, Moss. The work was done in the
afternoon, meeting with
considerable opposition
from the enemy. He put
up the S.O.S. flare which
brought down heavy ar-
tillery on our outpost
line. On this day Lieut.
Weir received the injuries
from which he died.
An intricate part of
the line known as the
maze still remained in enemy hands.
It was decided to attack it from the
Iront on the succeeding
18th. Under Lieut Summers the Coy.
moved forward with artillery support
and linked up with another battalion in
a combined post. B Coy. bombed towards
C Coy. five minutes later. The fight on
the previous afternoon had lessened
enemy resistance at this point and B
Coy. successfully linked up with the
? right flank of C Coy. On the night of
August 17th-18th the Battalion was re-
lieved, moying back to Daours by motor
transport.
THE ASSAULT.
A week of delightful rest succeecfed
this strenuous period. Billeted in a
chateau with large grounds the men
were able to play cricket, while a tennis
court gave others the opportunity of
playing their favorite game. The river
and canal were used daily by all in the
hot spell. Those days were idyllic. But
a rough awakening came on August
31st, when sudden orders to move were
received. In the evening the Battalion
was being taken by motor transport to a
line of trenches in front of Morcourt.
For several days it followed the retreat-
ing enemy by a series of daily marches.
Each night the men would dig in anew
and construct shelter from
any available material.
It gave a fine instance of
our soldiers' quick adap-
tation to new surround-
ings to see how comfor-
table an hours' work
could make them. Down
to the banks of the
Somme, in front of Per-
onne, the Battalion fol-
lowed the enemy. Here
he put up his first serious resistance for
several days. On August 31st the Bat-
talion moved across the river at Fevil-
lers with instructions to advance in
small bodies of men into an uncleared
sector beyond Clery and to the right of
Mont St. Quentin. If Mont St. Quentin
had been held by one of our brigades, as
was stated, our task would have been
comparitively easy. But it was not.
The hill and Anvil Wood on its right
were strongly defended by the enemy.
As the Battalion advanced under con-
siderable shell fire, it met with some

" WALLY."
It is said sometimes that popularity
and good soldiership do not go together.
And this is another way of saying that
a popular man in the Battalion is sel-
dom a good soldier. But such a state-
ment is amply refuted in the case of
Lieut. Walter James Clay den, who was
killed in the capture of Mont St. Quentin
on September Ist. Popularity was
essentially his achievement in our Bat-
talion life, yet as a soldier in and out of
the line he was excellent. His charm
and sweet temper made him beloved by
all ranks, his manliness and courage
made him the fine soldier'he was.
" Wally," as he was called affection-
ately, joined the batt, as a private in 1916.
His fine bearing and education signalled
him out for promotion, yet his modesty
prevented him from applying whilst
" older battalion men awaited that dis-
tinction." But length of service does
not claim promotion in war time, and it
was not long after joining that lie be-
came a corporal. In a short time he was
a Sergeant and then C.S.M. After Bulle-
court applications for commissions were
called. Lieut. Clayden's name was' sub-
mitted, After a course at an Infantry
School he received his first star on 24-7-17,
He will be remembered by the Batt-
alion chiefly as a subaltern in A. Coy.
He was always ready with his smile,
always had a cheery word of
welcome; always encouraging his
platoon in the strenuous conditions of
the line. And Death claimed him for
his own on September Ist in one of the
finest achievements of the Battalion.
We feel the sadness in the loss of a man
so young and full of life ; so ably fitted
to carry on his work in our Australian
life. But he has attained the greater
honour and has left us a memory
fragrant as the wattle from the country
that he loved and for which he died.
PRIVATE "MAC."
" He was only one of the Boys," as the
song says. Not an old soldier, as length
of service counts, but he died as only a
hero can die, and the thoughts of his
valor will remain when Time has ef-
faced most other records from the tablet
of battalion memories.
The above reference is to Private R?
Mactier, of B Coy, and following is ths
story of his sacrifice for duty's sake:.-*
Doing important work as a scout in the?
line during a most anxious period, at the
instigation of his officer, Lieut. Jenkins,
he went forward to ascertain the cause
of the battalion being held up. He soon
discovered it in the shape of a nest
of Hun machine gun positions. The first
of these ha attacked with bombs, even-
tually throwing the gun over the para-
pet. Immediately on accomplishment of
this feat a second post became his objec-
tive. He soon accounted for this, and
six Germans were forced to surrender.
Another obstacle remained as a bar to
progress, and gallantly Mac rushed this
hornet's nest, giving his best in the
third of a sequence of almost unparalleled
deeds.
Apart from soldiering, Mac, who hailed
from Tatura, was liked for his cheerful
and obliging disposition. He was recog-
nised as the most uncomplaining
"digger" in the Coy., and whether the
job was pleasant or painful, with a smile
he did it. Asa footballer in our premier
team he took a prominent part in the
sport of the battalion. In short, " a Soldier
and a Man."
The following officers are at present
on leave: ?Lieut-Col. Brazenor, Capes.
Farrell, Clues, Martin, Lieuts. Maddrell,
Elliott, Hume, Bragg, P. J. Smith, and
Dixon.

resistance the further it moved. D Coy.
took the right flank with A Coy. in sup-
port, while B Coy. with C Coy. took the
left. In the afternoon strong resistance
was encountered, A 77 c.m. gun was firing
point blank from Anvil Wood and mach-
ine guns played along the trench reached
by B and C Coys.
It was obvious that Mont St. Quentin
must be cleared if progress was to be
maintained. In the evening Brigade
issued orders that the 23rd, with the
24tli on its left, would attack the hill at
8 a.m. on the morning of September Ist.
That day's operations was described in
8.R.0.s as " the greatest feat achieved by
the Battalion." The day was a succes-
sion of surprises, An energetic patrol
of the enemy oqcupied the J.O. trench,
and was holding it with machine guns
ha!f-an-hour before zero. B Coy., led by
Lieut. Jenkins, simply took the post by
storm. They would brook no resistance.
It tvas here that Pte. Robert Mactier lost
his life in circumstances of extraordin-
ary personal bravery. When the attack
opened in a rain shower the machine
guns from the hill played a withering
fire on our men. D, and A. Coys, were
held up on the right, white B and C, in
small numbers, reached a trench that
ran at the base of the village. ThM
trench was occupied by a battalion of
the sth Brigade, which had done
ful service in a previous attack in weak-
ening the defence of this almost impreg-
nable position. Under instructions from
Battalion Headquarters the 23rd rested
while a barrage was put in the village
for an hour. Then the men moved for-
ward with the reinforcement of two com-
panies from the 21st Battalion. Success
was immediate. The enemy guns were
captured or forced to a hasty retreat and
in the afternoon the battalion held a
trench on the far side of the hill. A
splendid panorama of country with Per-
onne in the valley on the right lay be-
fore us. The line was held until the
night of September 4~f>. On that night
we moved back towards our rest camp
A noteworthy feature of that relief was
the provision for feeding the tired men.
Hot porridge and tea at the first halt,
cocoa and biscuits from the Brigade
Y.M.C.A. at the next, and stew, tea and
a tot of rum to send the men into a
warm, welcome sleep. The days had
been hard and strenuous, but the men
bore themselves with the courage and
devotion to duty that is the soul of the
Australian troops.

Another regret shared by the Bat-
talion is the death of Lieut, C. Lead-
wood, which occurred in the Mont St.
Quentin stunt. The late officer only
joined us during our last spell out and
although, as an active service soldier
he was known only in one action, he had
created a favorable impression by his
work. _ In private life he was a familar
figuie in the musical world, appearing
on innumerable occasions on the concert
platform as a favorite baritone. He was
also a sport of no mean order and prom-
inent in leading clubs of the Australian
world of cricket.

porarily in charge of the Battalion,

THE FRENCH PEASANTRY.
�
THEIR DAILY LIFE.
If an Australian were asked to live
the daily life of a French peasant he
would say emphatically "Be d?d."
And if you questioned him closely you
would find the reason for his emphasis is
a restless spirit that has no counterpart
in ancient France. This restlessness is
not a fault. The larger and freer con-
ditions of our Australian life demand the
different spirit, We live for the most
part under conditions where the ways
and means of life have to be found.
Where initiative is a more important
factor than patience. But this differ-
ence of outlook does not entitle the
quicker and more vivacious nature to
look down on the slower and narrower
one. There lies behind the French
peasant experience of many many years.
He is weighted with the tradition of the
ages. And he sees life as something
into which he has to fit. Not an oppor-
tunity for carving his own career. If a
man has that broader vision here his
eyes wander to distant fields. He is
certain to emigrate.
I remember talking to a girl who had
lived her twenty years in a tiny country
village. I asked her "Do you ever de-
sire to get away, to see the pleasures of
town and the sights of other countries ?"
And she replied " No, I am quite happy.
Before the war we had our fete days and
other country amusements. They were
enough. And often if I were asked to go
to a dance I would refuse. lam con-
tented with my work and the quietude
of my own thoughts." Her English was
not quite so correct as I have given, but
that was the substance of her remarks.
They seemed to me strikingly typical of
the uniform life of the French peasant.
I suppose of peasants all over Europe.
And what is their life ? It begins very
early in the morning and finishes very
late in the evening. The peasant's cap-
acity for work seems in direct ratio to
his need for sleep. It is probable their
work is no very severe tax on their men-
tal and physical powers. There is no
bustle, no rush, no sudden or prolonged
demand on their mentality. As they did
yesterday so they will do to-day ; as
they did last year so they will do next.
At five in the morning they are astir
with the small fire lit that boils the water
for their cup of coffee. After looking to
the needs of the animals that live so
closely with them as to seem part and
and parcel of their little homes they sit
down to a meal that would hardly suffice
an Australian at the point of death. A
little bread soaked in their vegetable
soup or perhaps an egg spread on bread
and butter. The coffee is usually drunk
without milk, the beans ground for that
particular meal and the quality excel-
lent. Of their work in the day the
countryside speaks best. There is hardly
a square foot not under cultivation. Where
a farmer in a new country will leave a
yard they'll leave an fnch. And this
despite the war that has left only a few
old men and women to look after the
farms. Their patience and thoroughness
was shown well in a field of wheat
cut near the front line. Before the crop
had grown high some wire defences had
been run thro' it. Criss cross so that a
man would have much difficulty in get-
ting through it. Yet when the crop was
ready for harvest every bit between the
barbed wire had been cut. It had meant
hours of work, but the sturdy thrift of
the peasant folk could not endure to
leave one grain of corn not gathered in.
For dinner some more vegetable soup
and perhaps a little meat will suffice
most families. And supper is not so
very varied again from that. A little

thin wine is added in place of coffee.
Their two staple drinks? 1 wine and
coffee.
Their hours of leisure are the last few
between sunset and the time to ge to
bed. It is sometimes a little difficult to
understand their nature in the few
moments of freedom. It is no uncom-
mon thing on a winter evening to see
three or feur men and women sitting
round the stove ?the open fire is found
only in the poorest homes?staring vac-
antly at its red-hot body. They say no
words to each other, but the men puff
fitfully at their short pipes. What is in
in their minds ; ot what are they think-
ing? It is then that you wish the
weight of the ages was not so heavy
upon them, that one among them would
get up and shout aloud or throw his
pipe with a gesture of impatience on
the stone floor. Such immobility is
uncanny. It savours of the prehistoric
ages. But all are not saturated with
immovable patience. The girls in many
cases will talk and enjoy a bit of fun.
The Australian soldier has helped them
much in this respect. And BO we leave
these peasant folk in quiet enjoyment of
their daily lot. If they do not know
the excitement of new ideas and new
scenes they escape, perhaps, the dis-
content that such things too often breed.
They live and die placid and unperturbed
with the achievementof good, solid and
valuable work to their credit, Will they
need more recommendation in their
new life ??L.G.S.
SALVING OF CIVILIAN PROPERTY
The following letters from Australian
Corps are published for information.
They show the French people's appreci-
ation of the efforts made by Australians
to salvage their property in the forwarid
area. It is proposed to expend the monies
mentioned in cigarettes for the benefit qf
Divisional Units
(1.) "The civilians evacuatefl
villages in the Somme area, whosejPKp-
perty has been salvaged by Australian
troops, have forwarded 770 francs to be
distributed among the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and
sth Australian Divisions. This BUBO has
been handed over to the Paymaster,
Australian Corps, and 492,50 francs rpay
he drawn by each of the four Divisions
from their respective paymasters for the
benefit of the troeps."
(2) "The late residents of Villers
Bretonneux, whose property has been
salvaged by the Australian troops, have for-
warded a further sum amounting to 1020
francs to be distributed among the five
Divisions. This sum has been handed
over to the Paymaster, Australian Corps,
