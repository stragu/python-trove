No. ?>. ?TRANSPORT.
As will be seen such a department de-
manded a good deal cf battalion man
power tor its upkeep, and what is more a
good type of soldier who would take a
pride and interest in the team allotted to
him. In this repect the battalion has been
most fortunate. Every driver has made it
his aim to maintain the prestige and good
name ot the unit. This has been well evi-
denced by the splendid results in compe-
titions held from time to time, The most
exacting demands made on our transport
have been when the battalion was in the
line, for it is at such a time that it must
daily bring up food, water,, ammunition
and bombs,, and right nobly has this duty
been carried out, generally under heavy
shell five, aud very often under most ap-
palling weather conditions.
No one in an infantry battalion, who
has known the conditions can accuse the
transport driver of having a ? cushy ? job.
A number of our drivers wear the M.M.
for gallant service. Transport right
through has been a self-contained unit,
having its own cooks. Maintainance has
been kept up effectively by blacksmith,
saddler, and painter, and the value of the
work of these tradesmen is proved by the
fact that 90 per cent of the harness
brought from Australia- iu 1915 is still in
use, and 70 per cent of the vehicles have
been working for three years. The care
and attention to horses has enabled us to
retain about 50 per cent of our draughts
brought t� France, and of 6 officers? horses
brought from Australia, 3 are still with
the batt. after nearly four years? service,
- T.P. F.
Soliliquies.
The whole world beautiful, and every-
thing beautiful in the world was plainly
seen in and around Vaux, especially so
being the joy of colour that ran riot
throughout the crops seen on all sides.
But as we came further north on the
track of course it was seen the hand of
winter had been in advance of us, and
had ruthlessly taken the sparkling green
from the graceful trees which form nearly
all the beauty of France. As we marched
on the cold, dull touch of early winter
were all the eye had to rest upon. Flora
had long since vanished, the trees
had shaken off the last leaf, and stood
stark and naked thus, their long slender
arms stretching towards the sky of
winter.
That glory of autumn we left behind
had vanished in these parts. The world
of trees and dowers will sleep until the
gentle voice of spring bids them awake,
and after the long winter, break again
into new life, and once more make glad the
heart of man.
In many places along the way the eye
would be arrested by a little isolated
white cress, marking the spot where a
soul went out.
Those little silent graves will look with
their sightless eyes up to the same wintry
sky, and will do so until the fall of snow
covers them, after which the green soft
grass will grow around, and perhaps even
now seeds of scarlet poppies, blue corn-
flowers have been brought by the wind,
later to burst into flower, and bedeck these
little resting places with the glory of their
color. May the scarlet of the poppy
stand for the blood of those who died that
we may live, and the blue of the corn-
flower be a symbol of the Eoyal way the
sacrifice is regarded hy They who live.

This issue finds us in a state of de-
mobilisation, and incidentally in one of
pleasurable anticipa-
tion, as to whether or
not it will be our turn
next. The veterans
of the battalion have
left us with the best
wishes of those re-
maining, amid parting
cheers, and a number
are possibly plough-
ing an ocean furrow
that leads to home.
We are a small but
nevertheless a happy
family carrying on in
an easy going but dis-
ciplinary manner.
Our first and last
thought is ? Home,
sweet home,? and the
general topic of con-
versation is ? What is
in view for the future.?
Of course numbers have availed them-
selves of the Educational Schemes, and*
Lieut. Pederick is easily the busiest
wflficer in the battalion. Dances and ;
evenings are quite a common occurrence
in the school room, arranged by the
boys, and in the
private houses of the
villagers, who have
literally taken us in
their arms. The
Y.M. Cinema is
handy, and leave to
Charleroi and Brus-
sels is liberal. Thus
the monotony is re-
lieved, and so with
the same old spirit
that won us our way
in war*?we are wait-
ing, waiting, waiting.
We have received
a long letter from
Miss E. Garside, 213
Dank St, Albert Park,
enelosing some fine
photos of the arrival
of General Pau in
Melbourne, with Col. Knox in the fore-
ground. We are unable to publish same.

,
The Diggeresses.
The following verses were written by
one of the boys as an appreciation of the
kindness shown them by the lady wor-
kers at the Army and Navy Leave Club
Paris :
When you. enter the Leave Club just look
to your right
And there you will gaze on a beautiful
sight;
For seated on stools,, clad in azure blue
dresses,
Are two of the Dinkiest-di-Diggeresses.
* � e
They smile on each Aussie and give him
advice
As to places in Paris both nasty and
nice;
They tell him that he has a generous
face,
Then they sigh for his hat badge with
wonderful grace.
� * �
Of course ail the diggers enjoying their
leave,
Know just 1 about what and what not to
believe,
And while one lady says ?Oh that
show?s a disgrace,?
The other will wink and then whisper
? Some place.?
? * *
Should you want to go somewhere, just
ask them the way,
And they?ll tell you just how to go, so
you shan?t stray:
Though I in my innocence once did as
I was told,
And spent the whole night wandering
round in the cold.
They really are nice though, and I know
full well
When I reach rny unit, the others I?M tell
Of the two winsome ladies, with corn-
tinted tresses.
Who when A.ussies they see, whoop out
? We?re Diggeressps.?
We have received Xmas and JSJew Year

Battalion Sports.
Again, possibly for the last time, the
battalion has been en fete, this Line with
a little sports gathering on the village
green, entered into with zest, and car-
ried out with more organisation than
perhaps ever before- The crowd was
riot great, and the fields not large, but
the competition all round was keen, and
interest well sustained. The popular-
event of the afternoon was the officers?
race, and the win by Lieut, Bastow gave
pleasure to all. An amusing incident
occurred in the pull, when the rope,
which had stood three years? test of war
would not stand three minutes tug of
war, for twice it let both teams down on
a soft spot in thek anatomy, amidst
great laughter. The good old Y.M. was
there with cocoa and biscuits, and a
petite canteen provided the throat
lotion. The 21st band played an ex-
cellent musical programme, and Lieut.
Jack Phillips and committee can feel
quite satisfied that everything went
?good oh.? Following are the entries

cord for all

Memories.
?Put on some wood and pull your chair
up to the fire. Ugh! What'a -of
a night i It?s raining again. Listen to
the wind howling round the houses !
Remember that night when we went into
the line at ! It was just
like to-night. Black as ink; mud and
rain and shells ! Remember how they
pasted that little village. Good job we
decided to go round it instead of taking
the short cut! We?d, have got right into
that barrage. He put a lot of gas over
with it too. I went through it next day,
and even then you had to wear a mask.
And then to make things worse, half the
company took the track to the left. You
know where that .big mine was ! ?and
got tangled up in that barbed wire. I
came across a map of that place to-day-
And then, that two hours? wait for the
guides. By . those coves were
glad when we relieved them ! They must
have had a , run those first four
days ! I?ll never forget that night. You
weren?t so badly off. You had a sort of
a dug-out. He lobbed an eight inch fair
on that place just after we were relieved,
but (we had to sit in these ??shell
holes for three days. It wasn?t any good
trying to dig in ; as fast as you dug a
hole it got full of water!- At night-it
wasn?t quite so bad: you could move
about. But if you tried ?to stand up in,
the day time, that - - ? machine gun-
ner in the bank would have a go at you.
T saw that place afterwards. It was a
bonza possy, just where that big,,tree had
been blown down across the road. Stick
some more wood on ! ? But that was, a
picnic to our second time in at ?
The mud was ?awful, and
we had no rations for two days. I saw
one poor devil bo'gfed there. The mud
was up to your waist in places. Wasn?t
that where you got trench feet? By
jove you were lucky to get away from?
that place! That?s where poor old
?? was killed ; got a 5,9 right
in the trench !??
? Come in ! When did you get back
from Sydney ? You?re just in time for
supper. Say, you remember that second
time we were in at ????? 1 We were
just talking about it. Doesn?t seem ten
years ago, does it ? 1 What are you doing
to-morrow? , Well, after the match come
round, both of I you: - ! T6 : in? ?^? will
be there. Cheerio! Good night.?

Armistice Night, Melbourne
The following clever description gives
a very vivid picture of that eventful
night?
? Melbourne took its peace-making
very lightheartedly. The news came
out at about seven on Monday evening-
I had gone home very tired, and was in
bed. What, abed, with the Armistice
signed? I got up as soon as I could
and boarded a tram in to see if the news
was true.
?Collins Street was full. There was
a band playing opposite the ? Arghs ?
office, and the crowd were singing patri-
otic songs and hymns indiscriminately.
I didn?t know that a crowd singing could
be so sweet and so moving?'but then the
circumstances were enough to move
more than the Wilkinson family, who
are somewhat accustomed to the exer-
cise, A wag was dancing and making
love motions to an elderly lady. Some-
one jumped on the shoulders of someone
else and stuck the Union Jack into
Berlin on the ?Argus? map, and then
everybody had to stick Union Jacks all
over the map of Germany.
? A disorderly procession of returned
soldiers butted; into the crowd from the
West and paraded up Collins Street.
Sober, sedate-looking people broke out
into sudden noises that might have been
song or an imitation of a motor horn, or
anything that your fancy suggested.
The trams were piled up from the Audi-
torium upwards, and the crowd surged
on to the roof. They found it great fun
rocking them till they swayed right off
the rails, when they ran them through
the crowd and beached a young army of
them in Post Office Place. The police
watched from afar. It was a very good-
natured crowd. Most of it looked as if
it might have decently been in the
trenches?'the crowd that smashed the
trams, I mean, but I suppose it was tired
of taking a back seat, and leaving the
chairs to the men in khaki.
It was a clear, starry night? just a
hint of cold in the air. The sky was a
perfect blue. The city was brightly
lighted and here and there people carried
torches. Irene and I went up to the
roof of the Auditorium and watched it
from there. It was a sight I shall never
forget. Neither shall I forget the
internal excitement of the hour. It will
never be lived through again. I forgot
that I had been tired. I got home at a
decent hour and slept the sleep of the
just.
?The next day: was a holiday. The
city was a seething mass of people.
But the spirit of the night before was
lacking. It was impossible to feel
again, even so soon, as we had felt on
first hearing the news. Besides, the
daylight lacked the splendour?bright
and fine as it was ?of that purple dusk,
fading into the starlit beauty of that
night of nights.?
