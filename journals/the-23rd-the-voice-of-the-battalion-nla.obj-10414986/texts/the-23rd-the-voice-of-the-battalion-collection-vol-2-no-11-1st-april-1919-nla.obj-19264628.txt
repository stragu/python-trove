V.C.?s For Towns,
The French Government has decided,
on issuing the Legion of Honour to towns
the names of which have become immor-
talised by their gallant stands against the
Hun during the three years of war. This
is an example the British Government
might follow, and it suggests that our
King might easily award V.C?s. to towns
and villages equally heroic for defence
from our point of view. Look at Poz-
ieres, the graveyard so many of our Aus-
tralian comrades, and the key to one of
the most difficult positions on the never-
to-be-forgotten Somme. Hasn?t it de-
servedly won the coveted Victoria Cross.
And Ypres, the scene of more than one
sanguine, but nevertheless successful en-
counter, or Bulleconrt, where the one
small dent in the almost impregnable line
was made-by our beloved Sixth Brigade.
What a record of heroic bravery is sec-
reted within the walls of these now silent
towns. Yes, award them the Y.C. by all
means in recognition of a thousand brave
acts, and a memorial for all time to those
who fell therein.
To Our Defenders.
To every man in khaki clad,
Whether abroad or home, good lad,
Great Britain says in accents glad,
? We thank you !??
To every man who on the sea
Has kept the waves from foeman free,
Securing food for you and me,
? We thank you.'?
To every man in submarine
Whose deeds are seldom by us seen,
A work of danger yours has been?
?We thank you!?
To every man who in the air
Has risked his life to do and dare,
Most nobly you have done your share
?We thank you !?
To each Australian boy who came
To help his comrades win the game,
Accept good wishes in our name?
?We -thank you
?J.L.Ct.

Mont St. Quentin Memorial.
The total amount contributed by the
Officers, N.C.O?s., and men of the 2nd
Division reached the total 0fL1230 9s 7d,
and the designs for the statue have now
been submitted by a leading Australian
sculptor now resident in London. The
work will shortly be undertaken.
Trie memorial is to be placed near Elsa
Trench, the hopping off place of the 6th
Brigade in the final attack. The con-
crete base of the pedestal will rise in a
series ot steps to a platform on which the
statute will be erected. The later repre-
sents an Australian soldier in full battle
order, with the exception that he wears
the national Australian hat in place of
the steel helmet. His bayonet is trans-
fixing a German eagle, which he is
trampling underfoot. Around the base
of the pedestal will be four brass tablets,
one descriptive of the battle, and giving
the names of the units engaged. The
other sides will depict scenes from the
fighting, and will show the infantry,
artillery, and others at work. This work
for the brasses is being done by Miss
Baker-George, who will come out from
England and visit Mont St. Quentin next
week.
Colonel Annand, 2nd Pioneer Battn.,
will be in charge of the construction, and
it is hoped the memorial will be ready
early. Friends and relatives of the brave
when they visit the scene will find a
worthy memorial.

General Rawlinson Speaks.
Speaking at the Dniversite de Travail
Charleroi during the presentation of prizes
at the finals of the Australian Corps Box-
ing Tournaments. Genetal Sir Id. Raw-
linson, 4th Army Commander said that as
he was being demobilised, he would like to
take the opportunity of saying good-bye
to the Australians. He had watched
them during the whole of their career as a
Corps, and their progress in the art of
war wag n arvellous. He cited Gallipoli,
theearly days in France. Pozieres, Gjnchy,
and followed on till the 1!)18 operations,
when he said the Australian Corps had
reached the position of being the finest
and best in the British Army. Continu-
ing lie said he realised he was speaking to
a mixed audience of Australians and Eng.
lishmen, but he had chosen his words care-
fully, and what he had said was the truth.
Lieut. W. Whitbread has left, en route
for Australia.

Poor Bailleul.
When the 23rd Battalion moved out
of the line after Broodseinde-Ypres fight-
ing it settled down to rest in the neigh-
bourhood ofï¿½ailleul ; first at Locre in
November. 1917, and in Deceriiber at
Canteen Corner, just before Ploegsteert.
Although a great deal of work was done
on the trench fortified system in the
'area,, plenty of time was spent in pleasur-
ably enjoying what the district offered.
Many'friendships were made among the
inhabitants, and Bailleul held a place in
the hearts of most of us. Pont Nieppe,
Neuve Eglise, aud Steenvorde became the
nucleus of future happy memories. But
the German push in 1918 drove us down
south, and during our absence his troops
pushed thro? that part of the country
with disastrous consequences to the folk
and their villages. A journey along the
road from. Armentieres to Caestre re-
veals a desolation that ?can compare
equally with the ruined country that we
know so well on the Somme, There is
hardly a house standing with four com-
plete walls, hardly a tree that hasn?t been
touched by shell fire ; hardly a bend of
the road that does?nt show ruin on all
sides.
Nieppe is flooded on each side of the
Armentieres road, with the remains of
homes soaked by the spread of water.
At Pont Nieppe the little shops that stood
in their dingy way along the main
Bailleul road are impossible to find ; only
little mounds of broken bricks tell the
tale of their existence. Where the road
to Neuve Eglise meets the Bailleul road
there stood a little estaminet, in which
a mother and two daughters lived when
driven from their native village in the
first German advance. They earned
their livelihood by the sale of beer, and
very deftly the elder daughter handled
any men who had drunk more that was
wise. Again they have been driven to
seek a new home, and the little estaminet
stands gaping to the wind and rain,
Bailleul is recognisable only by the
direction of its streets. The square is
broken and grass grown, with not one of
its circle of shops intact. The civil
cemetery has been so torn by shells that
the vaults lie open with the coffins
broken, showing the wrapt remains of
bodies that were laid to rest ?what irony
of fate ?many years ago. Bailleul.
which seemed set in such a quiet homely
aspect, is flooded with a light that re-
veals the hideous wounds it has re-
ceived.
Armentieres was the first town in
France where the battalion learnt the
simple amusements that after became so
common a method of relief from the
front line. It had tea shops, restaurants,
and estaminets, that gave a change from
the misery of trench life as it was known
in the early months of 1916. Now the
town is perhaps one of the very best
examples of what appalling destruction
modern warfare can inflict. If it
were preserved for perpetuating as an
example, it would be typical of all that
has been, the dreadful fate of so many
places in poor sad Northern France.*?

The Ramblings of Rammy.
And it came to pass that after four
years of fighting an Armistice was ar-
ranged,. and the Battalion Sigs. waxed
exceeding busy, and hurried them to the
C.0., saying, Oh, King, the war has
finished, at which the 0.0. waxed ex-
ceeding wrath,, saying ??verily,, verily,
woe is me, for now I shall have to go
back to work.?
But the Battalion Sigs. waxed ex-
ceeding glad, and hastened to the nearest
Boosery, there to acquaint the ancient
soldiery with the glad news, saying,
hark, ye men of bloody battles, to-day
the war is finished, and to-night you
will be given sundry divers monies for
the purchase of the wine that maketh
weak the legs of men.
And it came to pass that on the same
night, there were strange noises at the
Castle gates, and a dusky warrier sought
to kill the King, but his knees became
as water, yea, verily he tumbled to the
ground.
Then one that was among them said,
let us hie ourselves-to the Sergeant?s mess
and seek a sober Sergeant, but ?twas all
vain, yea, verily they were very drunk,
then said another seek ye an Officer, but
they also were stung.
And the night then was filled with
music, and the soldiers likewise with
wine, and there was not one among them
who was sober, yea, verily not one, and
so the long night passed, and peace came
in the morning, but not to those who had
drunken.
And it came to pass that after a time
there came-a stranger among us, and on
his breast were the colours of the rain-
bow, and his boots shone with the
brilliance of the Kiwi, and he said to-day
shall we journey to a strange country
and seek fresh honours, and the multi-
tude said yea, verily shall we go with
you to this new country ,but not to-day.
So on the following day the multitude
assembled, and the soldier having packed
all that was not his, departed for the
promised land, and so we left the land of
the Somme.
And it came to pass that after we hart
traversed many and varied cobble stoned
roads, and quaffed many a glass of beer,
we came to the land of the Belgians, and
there were some of the soldiery who said
yea, verily this is a fair place, and there
were some who said,? This will do me.
For there were many maidens there, who
looked fair comely wenches.
It was then that the soldiery waxed
eloquent and spoke of away lands,
and there was much music and dancing
to which the fair damsels came, and ver-
ily the warriors lost their hearts and
heads. Many of the soldiers were dug in.
Yea, verily their hands had lost their
Gunning, and they acquired others which
Gleaned their boots and fetched their
shaving water, yea even to the door of
their chamber.
And there were some among them who
spoke of a passing fair country where it
neither rains or snows, and everything it
touches turns into gold, so we fain would
go to view this fair Elysian, because we
are sick with this climate. But verily.,
yea verily, there are compensations.

Down the Rhine.
(Continued.)
Metz. The old Hun here showed his
cleverness when he took Alsace-Lor-
raine from the French, for as the train
winds in and around the valleys the sce-
nery is beautiful; early spring has
brought the leaves to the trees and made
the hillsides like scenes from old cpuaint
stories we read years ago.. No wonder
France wants this beautiful part of the
country back again. The feeling of the
people is never as it has been before. The
French tricolour is everwhere ?on the
flagpoles, in the shops. Men wear it
in their buttonholes, the women in their
corsage. The children are simply plac-
arded all over. The spirit of relief from
bondage is everywhere, and the people
have thrown dull care to the winds now
that they are free.
Passing through the outer defences of
forts we come to Nancy, one of the best
French towns we have seen. On to
Chateau Thierry, where the Americans
put up such a good scrap, although the
shelled country is nothing at all in com-
parison to Pozieres, Ypres or Bullecourt.
Epernay next, and there we have a glass
of champagne for 50 centimes, quite a
change in prices for us. From Epernay
a short run takes us to Paris, with its
beautiful architecture and wonderful
boulevai-ds and avenues makes us soon
forget the solidity of the German cities.
People here who had denied themselves
all] pleasures and luxuries during? the
war, are making up for lost time. ? What
care we,? says the Parisian. ?We have
beaten the Bosche : Alsace-Lorraine is
ours once more, so away with dull care ;
To-day is ours, ours, ours.?
The cates are full, the theatres are
crowded, and the boulevards packed with
a most cosmopolitan crowd.
Sitting at a table in front of the Rue
de la Paris, one sees beside French,
English, Americans, Italians, Japs,
Chinese, Portuguese, and other nationali-
ties too numerous to mention, while
every now and then along comes the old
slouch hat, with that swagger so un-
mistakable in any crowd.
At present Paris is more like the peace
time Paris than at any time during the
war, at least that is what I was told. I
think, after that, I should like to see
Paris in peace time.
Our leave is nearly up and reluctantly
we make for the Gare du Nord to catch
our train back, ?C?est I?armistice,? I sup-
pose, but it?s cruel, all the same. Back
in Charleroi once more everything seems
dull,but who knows when we maybe
able to go away again.
This time to , I wonder if any-
one can guess. However our trip has
been a wonderful experience and an
education, and we turn in to-night dead,
tired, but thankful for having had the
opportunity, and seeing all what we have
seen. ?J.A.P.
