Looking Backward.
PUBLISH I KG our first annual issue I.can lookback with pardonable
S pride at the achievements of the Battalion since the first copy of our
paper was handed to me on the strenuous Vpros battlefield of
October, 1917. Since that date our paper has been enabled to
chronicle very fully the battles and phases of Battalion life on
active service. Broodseinde, Ploegsteert, Albert, Ville-sur-Ancre,
Yillers Bretonneux, Hamel, 8th August offensive, are included in
this service. This last �ffensive drove the enemy from the proximity of Amiens, and
defeated his intention of dividing our armies. It was quickly followed by the splen-
did achievement of 1st September, 1918? the capture of Mont St. Quentin, To each
member of the Battalion and Brigade to which we are proud to belong these names
will serve always to remind us of the hard fighting endured, but with one prominent
thought? " Success." We realiso that the wearying strain is fully compensated by
the splendid results achieved. It is possible that in a wery short time these results
will secure a peace honorable to the nations on the side of Right and Justice. ? W,B,

It is difficult to send you a sincere Christmas Greeting.
It is intended for those we love? are not you among the number
JT | ? and we do not expect that joy will be singing in your hearts in
these days. And so my greeting is tentative. Take as much of
joy as you desire and know that it is not more than my thoughts wish you. And
there is reason for an increased happiness this Christmas in comparison with those
of the past four years. We feel that we are on the floodtide of success, which is
overwhelming the enemy in its intensity, and carrying us on to the shores where we
shall meet you again. If our hearts are not yet singing they arc near boiling point.
And we can leave our message at that, The hope is high in us that our next greeting
will be more intimate and wholly exultant. It shall he sealed with the seal of close
and immediate companionship. The year has not been without its sorrow ; keen and
keenly felt. Companions of many happy bonis have disappeared from the familiar
ranks. Where I stood beside a pal I now stand alone. But as a solace and a strength
I have had always the knowledge of your affection. This Christmas message is some
acknowledgment of that debt; of the constant thought expressed in so many letters
during the past year. Do not think to find me hard and callo-us, for suffering has
taught me the value of life's sweeter things. And I have found them typified in
your ever affectionate remembrance. My thought is ill-expressed, for I am a sol-
dier, but I wish you,-a Christmas olquiet joy, and so remain, ever your affectionate
- ? ?.....in the 23rd.

Good News.
We're Winnin'!
Our Double Assault,
interesting feature
|p?7of our iast tour of duty in
K* the line was the two at-
' cl| tacks that carried us
pi through the Beaurevoir
line. The second followed
the first so closely as to
make really one attack. From our rest
home at Cappy the Battalion moved out
on September 27th-28th. And on Octo-
ber 2nd we were in reserve to a sister
Brigade on the Joncourt-Estrees line.
Orders were received that with two other
battalions in the Brigade an attack
would be delivered at 6.30 on the evening
of October 3rd. Our position was on the
right. On the map the objective looked
a deep trench of six feet. In reality it
was a skeleton of six inches. Passing
thro' the sister Brigade our men made
their way forward in the rapidly-darken-
ing night. B Coy. was on the right in
the first wave, with D on the left and A
in the second wave. There were many
anxious moments for Coy. Commanders
as their men moved forward in the
gathering dark. A lone tree formed the
guide for the right flank, and a
ridge was the objective. It
was found and held. And the
men dug in for the night.
But orders were received in
the early morning hours for
another attack with our Bat-
talion forming a pivot for a
swing round to the right. The
attack was made at six o'clock
on the morning of October 4th.
Another ridge was the objec-
tive with formation, of Coys, as
in the previous attack. Very ?-
heavy machine gun fire was met, espec-
ially on the left, where- IJ Coy. was held
up. It was not till night that the posh
tion was reached and made secure. The
high ground gave a most extensive
and interesting view. Parties of the
enemy could be seen moving round dug-
outs. It was easy to detect machine
gunners seated at their guns and batteries
loading and firing point blank. The
shelling was considerable on that day.
During the attack by two battalions on
October sth enemy tanks were seen
moving in defence of their men.
On the night October sth-6th the Bat-
talion was relieved by American troops.
A most eventful six months of continuous
work in and near the line was over.
The troops were going back many miles
from the line. In every heart there was
rejoicing that so arduous a time had come
to an end.
And the work has been finely done. At
no period of its short history has the bat-'
talion done better. It shares with other
Australian battalions a reputation that
has earned the affection and deep grati-
tude of the French people, The villagers-
speak of Australians with a touch of
reverence and pay them the
greatest compliment in their
power by saying " Et les Sol-
dats Australiens sont aussi bon
que les notres." They may be
better, but you could not ex-
pect a Frenchman to think so.-

THE VILLAGE POLICEMAN.
When we saw him first he was totteripg"
along tlie country load with tlie aid of a stick
gnarled and knotted as himself. He was bent
with the work of many years, wizen-faced and
old as a village oak. He would stop every
few minutes and peer round the fields as the
on the watch for something.
The Maire stopped for a chat and introduced
me. Monsieur is eighty-live years old, he
said. And Monsieur's face broke into a
wrinkled smile. He raised his hand and
brought it down on my shoulder saying " Si
vous etes un brigand, je vous metterez en
prison car je suis le gendarme du village."
Which in Australian meant " I am the village
policeman and will afreet you if you ,;mis-
behave."

ON BATHS.
A bath! In the days before we were
soldiers, a normal necessity of our lives ;
but now a strange unusual thing like a
pearl of great price found on the shores
of Queensland or the coast of West Aus-
tralia, and as greatly valued. Thoughts
on baths divide themselves into two sec-
tions?the frequency of baths, perhaps it
would be better to say " infrequency,"
and their style. In early days the in-
frequency was the hard thing to get
used to, and that the body should go un-
washed for days and days became
weeks ?was a thought of horror to the
merely camouflaged civilian mind. But
custom steadies all things, and it is
doubtful if the wash of the " altogether "
is viewed with the same complacency as
in better days. Certainly its absence is
no longer a worry. A study in the
progress of bath construction would re-
veal the development of army organisa-
tion. It might even show us the methods
that have lead to our recent successes.
For have we not been informed on high
authority that it is the staff who is win-
ning the war ? And is not the staff
responsible for the baths ?
There was the bath in Egypt. When
you filled a bucket of water hung above
your head and by a system of pulleys
drew the pailful over you in one deluge.
Sometimes the pail, came down too.
But with skill you retained a small
amount of water to. take off the soap.
When the heavy splash had fallen there
came the hasty soap-over before the
water dried in the hot Egyptian sun. Of
Gallipoli there is no need to write, for,
I understand, no one ever had a bath
there. With the best intentions in the
world you oould'nt get into your mess-tin.
And when we came to France other
difficulties awaited us. It was no longer
the heat but the cold that became the
burning question of the hour. For those
early French baths were no gentile
white-tiled luxuries; but small drippings
from leaky taps on to wooden boards
dirty with the tread of many army boots.
The taps warned off from the inquisitive
gaze by a wall of thinnest hessian that
quivered in the icy December wind. The
water may have been warm when it left
the tap but by the time it trickled down
your back it had a glacier touch. Ugh 1
But things improved. There did come a
time when the trickle became a spray,
and real live hot water descended on
your crouching back. What a delight-
ful sensation. Three weeks in the line,
caked in mud from head to foot, chatty
and irritated by many torments and then
this exquisite freshness and the removal
of a leaden weight. And with luck the
baths soon improved. Barns were util-
ised. Turned into bathrooms by the ener-
getic Australians. And clean linen neatly
stacked in bundles at the side. A strange
thing that a man should grow accus-
tomed to the idea of handing over his in-
ner clothes in exchange for others-
washed certainly ?but worn previously
by some other person. How many of us
could have endured the thought in
civilian days.
It must be confessed that victory has
its disadvantages. Baths suffer. The un-
certainty of the established line means
that proper accommodation is not easy to
obtain. And so we find ourselves back
once more to the hessian sense of decency
and the trickling tap. "Now, boys, all
under together and we'll turn on the
water." And some of us, poor blighters,
have been standing nursing our shoul-
ders this past ten minutes.
Our joy is the summer? long and warm.
We forget baths then and dip into the
Somme with a daily regularity that
whitens the skin to its original colour.
We forget almost that the war is on in
the joy of our refreshed and renewed
vitality.? L.G.S.

Not Yet!
FROM BLIGHTY BY AIRPLANE.
?- ?-
To deliberately miss the return leave
train was a risky thing to do, but the
opportunity of flying from England to
France does not eome one's way every
day. It was more than usually risky
this particular morning because the
chance of a " fly " seemed quite remote.
I woke up at six to hear the rain steadily
drizzling down outside and a thick haze
settled over London. What chance of
flying such a day as this ? In airman's
parlance it was a "dud" day. I "ex-
isted " between hope and despair all
morning, and at midday was rewarded
by a glimpse of the sun.
By 2.30 p.m. my "pilot"
and I were on our way to
??, to the " drome." My
small kit stowed away
somewhere in the " fuse-
lage," and the pilot aboard,
I crawled carefully into
my apparently frail hole,
fastened a broad leather
belt round myself, donned
goggles and buttoned up.
Our "bus" was a "De
Havilland 9," a two-seater biplane which
is noted for its steadiness and reliability.
That was comforting to know at the
time, although you may not appreciate
it. After testing the engine we moved
off, slowly at first; but soon letting out
the engine we were roaring and bumping
across the field at sixty miles an hour.
Suddenly the bumping ceased, I looked
over my pilot's shoulder at the height
indicator and found we were 1500 ft. above
the ground. One's first sensation is to
wonder what would happen if the bottom
of one's seat should fall through the
" fuselage." The roar from the engine
was deafening, and the wind from the
blades of the propellor was stifling,
but having left the earth all other sen-
sation of speed vanished. I was inter-
ested in the speedometer and height re-
corder, and also in the country beneath.
Presently we ran into clouds, with hail
and rain. Earth and sky were blotted out
and our compasses were the only guide
for direction. Flying out of the squall
we found ourselves over the Thames,
and along its twisty course hundreds of
craft looked like flies on a pond. Pass-
ing over beautiful green country, cut
into a mozaic of allotments of various
tints of green, then over dark grey towns
and manufacturing areas, we came to
Folkestone. Here we descended to
report all correct. Fate was kind that
day, as the weather was
now beautiful and the
channel looked her best as
we flew over it at 4000ft-.
Looking down we saw
England on our left and
France on our right, with
the insignificant looking
channel separating them.
Many boats were toiling
across, hardly seeming to
move. In fifteen minutes
we could see Calais, and
swinging south, soon sighted Wimereux
and its beach dotted with bathers. A
few minutes more brought us over Boul-
ogne and then, having seen that city
from a new viewpoint, we made inland
to our drome." On the way thither a
great silver dirigible balloon passed
underneath us looking like a huge fish-
moving slowly. A few minutes later,
and we were gliding down, down, until
the familiar jolt told us our wheels had
touched earth, and we had reached our
destination. As a " finish "to a Blighty
leave this way of returning is recom-
mended, and the writer's thanks are ex-
tended to the sporty "teelow' r who
gave me this fine experience.? Ida

Australian Corps
' sllliSlli�! joined the Army on
. ?: Bth April, 1918, they
have passed through a
period of hard and uni-
// .< formly successful fight-
ing of which all ranks
have every right to feel proud. Now
that it has been possible to give the
Australian Corps a well-earned period of
rest I wish to express to them my grati-
tude for all that they have done. I have
watched with the greatest interest and
admiration the various stages through
which they have passed from the hard
times of Flers and Pozieres to their cul-
minating victories at Mont St. Quentin
and the great Hindenburg System at
Bony, Bellicourt Tunnel and Montbre-
hain. During the summer of 1918 the
safety of Amiens has been principally
due to their determination, tenacity and
valor. The story of what they have
accomplished as a fighting Army Corps,
of the diligence, gallantry and skill
which they have exhibited, and of the
scientific methods which they have so
successfully applied, has gained for all
Australians a place of honor amongst
nations and amongst the English speak-
ing races in particular.
It has been my privilege to lead the
Australian Corps in the Army .during
the decisive battles since August Bth
which bid fair to bring the war to a suc-
cessful conclusion at no distant date. No
one realises more than I do the very
prominent part that they have played,
for I have watched from day today every
detail of their fighting, and learned to
value beyond measure the prowess and
determination of all ranks. In once
more congratulating the Corps on a series
of successes unsurpassed in this great
war I feel that no mere words of .afninh
can express the renown that they have
won for themselves and the position they
have established for the Australian uatioli
not only in France, but throughout
the world. I wish every officer, N-C.O.
and man all possible good fortune in the
future, and a speedy and safe return �tO

\ Dear, I hope you're
I J i s ' :en f� the tale I tell;
How I wish I was at home
F Is the subject of my poem.
[ The shells-are .screaming
cJ overhead,
And eggs are dear and so
is bread.
How are all tjie cows and chickens
And can you send me twenty "thickuns?"
Give my love to the dear old dairy
Where I filled my little Mary.
How's the wood bean and the blocks?
I'd dearly like some good old chops.
I'd like to have a chat to you,
The " chats " out here are awful blue.
At present we are on a farm,
It's smell is like a soothing balm ;
They keep their dust heap in the yard
This war is really very hard.
They have a pond in every town,
From which they make their beer so
brown.
They wear wood clogs and. little shawls,
And mud and straw for overalls.
I'd love to see the trees of gum,
01)1 will those old days never come.
The lady in our billet here
Washes herself once a year.
She really is a coy young thing,
Looks like a bag.tied up with string.
She has a good heart, though, I think,
And says to soldiers "plenty drink."
When I get home, excuse my grief,
I'm cutting ou.t this bully beef,
You want to know what meatless means'
Find the pork in pork and beans!
Now the Huns are going home
I think I'll close my little poem.
And lots of fun we'll surely see,
Berlin is always on the Spree ;
So good night, Dad, I'm off to snore.
Will be home one nine two four.

Vice-Consul would have been obliged t� stay to the last ! 1 was
working 20 hours a day for the fir st fortnight. At night we had to walk the streets
with care iir case we fell into trenches. We had a visit from G.H.Q. and the Portu-
guese Governor-General, so that Quelimane has been the hub of the universe and the
Western Front was almost forgotten as a side-show.
It took me twenty-four days to reach this
place from ?Durban. From Dehrgoa Bay to
Beira I travelled orr a cattle-boat, caught a
small vessel there for Chinde at the mouth
of the Zambezi and prepared for a seventy
mile trip overland. Eighteen porters were
escort and they carried me in a ham-
mock for six hours. After crossing four-
rivers itt dugout catroes I had a six-mile
trolley ride to Micshunc, travelling down
the river of that name by motor boat. We
passed swarms of pelican, wild duck and
flamingoes attd witlrin twenty yards of two
huge lrippos. 1 saw no crocodiles tiro their
tracks were plainly visible in the mud.
After four hours in tire boat, I was
cairied in a hammock for three hours to a
place called Tubassunge. I reached Quel-
imane by the aid of another motor boat, but
with no luggage as the carriers had fallen
behind on our long journey. lam rationed
