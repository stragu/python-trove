TRAINING.
?
When out of the line the miin prin-
ciple to be followed is to make fit every
man individually and collectively in mili-
tary knowledge, so that when he is next
called upon he will be so trained that no
matter what obligation comas his way he
will have reached a proficiency sufficient
to attain the object in view.
What a change the old soldier must no-
tice in the training of to-day as compared
to the time he enlisted. Though the old
principles still apply Lewis gunnery, anti-
gas measures, bombing, use of rifles, gren-
ades, scouring, and intelligence are only
a few of the multiple subjects taught.
The object is to make each subject in-
teresting, and the chief aid to this is a
spirit of competition and the avoidance of
the constant repetition of the old days.
How often has the instructor been seen
marching his squad in a small area with no
change of movement for 15 minutes, when
by 5 minutes drill he could possibly secure
a maximum number of movements, which
would have been of greater value and in-
terest to the soldier, ensuring ke-ener men-
tal activity. On these lines our comman-
ders hope to secure proficiency. A wise
proposal, which has borne fruit, is the in-
troduction of organised games as part of
our training. To Australians nothing
could have been more encouraging, and
every man is induced to become an active
participant in come form of sport. Cer-
tainly since its introduction the gallant op-
erations by the A.1.F., prove that this
form of training has improved in our fight'
iug force both their mettle and morale, the
two greatest essentials to a unit on active
service.?W.B.

No. 18. Ist JULY. 1918. Price, Ten Centimes.
REMENISCENT.
The accompanying
picture is a reproduc-
tion from a photo of
the late Major E. T.
Brind, taken while on
leave in Blighty,
which unfortunately
had to be left out of
the souvenir through
it being unprocurable
at the time. Major
Brind was one of the
originals of the Bat-
talion, and left Aus-
tralia with three star
rank. He was this
unit's first adjutant,
and received his maj-
ority in May, 1916.
Missing in action at
Pozieres on July2?th
1916, while in com-
mand of B Coy. In
private life the late
officer was pr o m-
inent in rowing
circles, being an oars-
man of interstate
repute. His record
as an officer of the
Battalion was one we
were all proud of, and
his influence over his
company was great
indeed.
Recently while pas-
sing through a park
one of America's sol-
diers was greeted by
a young lady, who
asked him, " Are you
going to France?"
"No," answered the
Yank, " l am going to
Germany." So much
like our own thoughts
in the beginning.
MAJOR E. T. BRIND.


WAS IN THE SUMMERTIME
?
Ti,e tonr of the front line work just
ended might be called by several names.
It was. "'War" under very novel and in-
teresting conditions. Imagine it an
'epoch, of drab colors, mud and travail.
Conditions were novel in that our posts
were set in parks and gardens, crops of
standing corn, beside a running stream,
which reminded us of the good day s
swimming we enjoyed when in reserve.
To those of us who knew this same
'countryside in Dec.-Jan., 1916-17, the
change was striking. In daytime, the
time for a snatch of sleep, our lads in
some of the posts crawled out of the
narrow trenches into the long grass
where they basked and slept. Condition's
were more than usually interesting on
account of the varied nature of the
ground covered by our sector. Within
our boundaries lay an important railway,
a, river, a well-timbered patch with heavy
Undergrowth and grasses,�" as .well as
country bare but for more, or less grown
crops.
We were not entirely without an issue
of excitement either. Ourpatrols, under
Lieuts. Lowe and Smith, with Sgts.
Dixon and Robertson, south of the river,
kept the wily Hock thinking seriously.
Several times did our "big, brave Anzacs"
get well and truly into touch with him.
Each time the Hock, 110 doubt, returned
to his lair a sadder and wiser man,
Beautiful weather prevailed, and we had
an easy time of it as regards shelling,
with the exception of the night we came
out, when things livened up a bit for an
hour or two.
Our late B.S.M. Wilby was particul-
arly unfortunate in receiving the full
contents of a whizz-bang while riding a
bicycle on his way back to the support
area, He was wounded in no less than
fifty places. Back at the dressing station,
while the R.M.O. set a badly fractured
limb, he smoked a " Woodbine " and pre-
served the . fortitude of a true, Anzac.
The -shock, however, proved "too much,
even for. his iron will and constitution.
One of our officers achieved great dis-
tinction in a single day by his endeavors
to preserve the valuable life of our res-
pected Brigadier from the Billjims. He
steered a successful course thro' our
front line and wire into No Man's Land,
while our unsuspecting boys slept peace-
fully at ten a.m. There are one or two
proverbs which are applicable, e.g.,
" Fools rush in," etc., " Where ignorance
is bliss," etc , "All's well that ends well,"
and so on. (Cook's have written to say
they have no use for the services, as a
guide, of an officer with fair hair, a large
smile, and who cannot talk.in his sleep.)
The Battalion caught some gas shel-
ling on its journey out, but the pre-
"cautions taken have fortunately cheated
the Hun and C.C.S. At the time
of writing we are haying quite an
easy time. Any account of our trip
in would be incomplete without a refer-
ence to' our attempted raid on a Hock
trench, recently. Although we were not
as successful as might be, we. are not
disheartened, and we should be sorry to
be a Hock when next our raiders get into
holts. As was said by one in high com-
mand, "the effort? of our raiders-arid
those who organised the affair deserved
a better fate." The result goes to show
that the Hock is not the fool that we
sometimes take him to be. ?C.A.F.
What was the Hock thinking while
our boys were "in"? Not "who is in
the line against me," but "Ven vill doze
Gottdam Australians reliefed pe. Mein
Gott, I haf nod der sleep had for many
nights! "

AMONGST THE BOYS.
?
Serg. Ramsdale writes a cheery note
that he is again smiling in the sunshine of
a well-known seaside resort. He expects
to be imshied out tout suite hack to the
battalion.
" Eammy '' remarks that _ they don't
issue many trips across the silver streak.
He plays cricket and tennis too. Gad !
On being repriman-
ded by a Colonel for
not saluting, a recent
reinforcement gave as
an excuse that lie un-
derstood the ?tli Brig-
age didn't salute in the
forward area.
During the Brigade
sports Fritz did drop a
couple of his small iron
foundries, but tli e y
didn't get a prize.
'Spose he thought he
ought to be represented.
Definition of an Aus-
tralian, according to a
Tommy " A brown
lanky bloke, who calls
his cobber a cow."
Serg. W. Gamel is
now ploughing the deep
across the blue that
leads to Young and
Jacksons, So is Pri-
vate Armstrong.
A certain private of Ours whose birth-
place happens to he a Foreign country,
while on patrol lately, was challenged with
the usual " Halt, who goes there !'
reply -- "Ve vos Australians," sounded
rather strange.
Corp. "Jim" Romaine of ours is now
almost the oldest "pro" in the Hun-killing
business, as far as the A.l.h . is concerned.
He is still going strong, and is a good sol-
dier and good fellow.
Serg. Dick Richards of O.R. and 'Bing'

tised by immersion, to wit, precipitated into
the angry waters of the lake. Neither is

OFFICERS' CHAT.
Capt, McGregor and Lieut. Jenkins are
both at Sutton Yeny. The Captain has a
pretty bad limp. _ .
The deepest regret is felt, particularly
by A Coy., at the unfortunate circum-
stances of the loss of Lieut. Gordon
Breen, M.M. His soldiering qualities
were undoubted, and his popularity as an
N.C.O. and during the short time he wore
a star, was battalion wide.
Capt. B. L. Poulton has been locum
tenens to our M.0., Capt. Barboui, dui-
ing his absence in Blighty.-
It is typical of the comradeship in the
battalion that the C.0., the second in
command, the Adjutant, and the Q.M.,
are often seen having a game of cricket,
and an officer invariably umpire s the
scratch matches played. Incidentally
the Major bowls a pretty good ball.
Apropos of cricket, the aoc, Lapt.
Barbour, who has an Australian inter-
state reputation, didn't do quite as well
as we thought he might in England.
Still we are proud of him.
The H.Q. officers' mess m a recent sup-
port area ws unique in one respect. It
had more doors in it than any constiuc-
tion of it size in the world. In fact it was
made entirely of doors salvaged from
ruined villages near by, jt
Our adjutant had a long run, but
kept his wind well till the Hun took it
with a piece of plonker, which fe,i in the
B.H.Q. Do damage done, however, we
are glad to say. .
Lieut. Weir has stepped up to Brig-
ade temporarily as S.O. He will there
have wider scope for his energies, it he
can be persuaded that he is really some-
thing more than a glorified clerk.
Major Bateman is on a visit to the
land of lovely lakes and charming
colleens, shure.
FISHING?AND FABLES,
Angling lias claimed the spare time of
a number of the Battalion members
lately.
As fishing and fables are inseparable
some high grade romancers have de-
veloped.
Numerous stories are afloat regarding
" beauts," ranging from from lib to 251b,
that have been missed.
Every imaginable kind of bait has been
experimented with, from the issue bread
to the gaudy dragon-fly that haunts the
reeds.
Even ye progeny of ye baleful blowfly
has been tried to tempt the provoking
piscatoria,
There has been an early rising compe-
tition also, some of the Izaac Waltonrtes
endeavoring to wake the bird that catches
the proverbial worm.
Not even the most ardent rod manipu-
lator has secured enough of the finny
tribe to feed even half the multitude.
Notwithstanding, some very fine catches
have been made,
Were it not for the unsportsmanlike
blowing up of fish, it might be an angler s
Paradise.
The Press were fortunate in hooking
quantum sufficit for a fish? supper before
the rush set in.
Dafter, Higgins and Co., are credited
with the capture of the largest fish up to
date, about 21bs in weight. Since this
event the craze has spread to orderly
room and other highly important
quarters.
Bv the wav, the Americans are about
to can whale flesh in view of a possible
shortage of food. Gee !

THE FRENCH PEASANTRY.
MANNERS MAKE Til MAN.
THE FRENCH PEASANTRY.
MANNERS MAKETH MAN.
It has been all along an accepted axiom
among English people that the French
have perfect manners. But such generous
recognition has been toned down by the
suggestion that such perfection is largely
superficial. They may be more outwardly
polite has been the argument, but when it
comes to true courtesy the French cannot
compare with us. Such generalisation has
been confirmed by the tourist on one of his
hasty week-end trips to Paris, when doubt-
less lie was cramped in some scramble on
an underground station. His dignity was
insulted and he returned to England
firmly convinced that despite his expres-
sive gestures the Frenchman has little true
politeness. But like most generalising on
foreign nations the truth is more apparent
than real. To live among the French
peasants ?who after all represent the only
criterion for judgment?is to be vividly
impressed with the extreme delicacy of
feeling that marks the French people.
For what are good manners hut the open
recognition .of the right of other people to
consideration, even at the expense of
yourself. They are founded in
sympathy and expressed in action. And
so, when we meet them in whatever circle
of life w r e know that we are face to face
with gentlemen and gentlewomen, however
lowly may be their lot. And when wa
apply this to the countryfolk, with whom
a soldier on active service spends so much
of his leisure time, we find that they meet
admirably the conditions.
What finer courtesy could be shown
than the reception given to the Battalion
when they moved out to rest after a long
spell in the line. Though t,he hour was
in the early morning hot coffee and omel-
ettes were ready at many billets. And
that was consideration shown to strangers.
Uuder the influence of intimacy the same
fine manners were revealed. Did a soldier
come in tired and need a cjiair- was not one
placed instinctively at his disposal ? Up
would rise a boy or girl at a sign from
their mother and, make the offer, if that
be superficial manners then, it is a Y vqry
exquisite form. And so in all the small
details of daily existence. TJiey never
forget-" eon jour'" or " bon' soir "; as the
door blows open by a distempered wind, it
is immediately shut by an observant peas-
ant girl; is a ( plate or glass:wanted, how
quickly and .willingly -it is fetched., Nor
is such refinement kept only for visitors.
It is seldom that a child receives a little
gift from a soldier without a warning from
the mother or. elder sister to say " ir.efci
beaucoup."
It was in the writer's experience to live
with a mother and daughter whose father
was at the war. The motheivcould neither
read nor write, yet the upbringing of her
young daughter would have been a model
for a prince's house. In none of the smal-
ler refinements of social life was there any
passing over or neglect. And when you
came to the deeper intimacy of sex rela-
tions there was the same quick under-
standing. Tease the girl with the enjoy-
ment of a walk with a soldier and'she
would reply gravely that her father would
be tres fach " if he thought she indulged
in such harmless pleasantry. Though
they might earn the paltry sum of a few
pence per week as a means of livlibood

these two women moved about their nar-
row household, ladies to their fingertips.
And so we learn thro' the medium of
daily intimacy that the mannersofFrench
folk are not dependant on education, and
if they are not dependant on that they
must be inherent in the social training of
the nation. And allied with the country
ig an, independance of thought that
flashes out again and again in conver-
sation. There is no servility in their de-
lightful manners. No bowing to a pos-
sibly superior class.
FUN AT THE FRONT.
[By " Tomski"]
It was ray good fortune to witness a
very amusing and interesting spectacle
recently. Camped near here (D.A.D.O.s)
is a D.A.C., and all the mules being con-
sidered fast, and each supposed to be
faster than the other, caused some argu-
ment amongst their respective drivers.
All this ( was settled by a race of three
heats and a final. Much betting even-
tuated, and queer the mules looked as
they lined up at the starting post. Every
color of the rainbow, and other indescrib-
able tints were represented. The jockeys
wielded sticks, whips, and branches of
trees, some four inches thick, while all
wore spurs.
" They're off!" Away .they go with
much noise, . bustling, and ear-wagg'ing,
each rider a trier for position. They get
fairly under way with ears back and tails
straight out. Coming round the turn,
some of the " Donks " were not nimble
enough on their feet to take the corner
cleanly, with the result that they shot off
the course and into the wood, while others
bumped and struggled with each other
until they straightened out enough to
continue on their way. The thuds of
the varied instruments of torture on the
animals' ribs sounded like a bombard-
ment. At last the field thins out, and
three are left in the running. Leading
is an old rusty black mule, who hops
along like a ball, without bending his
legs. This " donk" specimen differs
from the others, inasmuch that he has
enormous ears, which, contrary to the
rest, he keeps straight out in front.
Struggling with " Rusty," for first place
is a mouse colored mule, very fleet of
foot, but cannot pass the other. At one
period Moussy " seemed like heading
off " Rusty," but the old fellow bored
straight into him and pushed him off the
course. (I think "Rusty had been at the
game before.) However, after a close
and exciting finish " Rusty " won by his
ears, poked straight out, while "Moussy"
laid his back, thus losing him the event.
The win was very popular, both mule and
rider being loudly and deservedly cheered
as they proudly walked in the ring.

A GRIEVANCE.
[To the Editor.]
Sir, ?Will you please bring under the
notice of the " powers that be through
the medium of our journal, the indis-
criminate manner in which the available
supplies from our
battalion cante en
are distributed.
Would you kindly
inquire why certain
of our ranks are
able to purchase
(through the back
door) " the cup that
cheers" in an al-
most un 1 i m it e d
quantity, per'petrol
tins, buckets, etc.,
whilst many of we
other mortals can
hardly get suffi-
cient to wet our
whistles. Further-
more, why are the
prieds charged-in-
variably higher
than, for instance,
the Y. M.C.A., or
other brigade can-
teens.
Yours, etc..
THOSE THAT FIGHT.
Lieut W. W. Anderson, the war
museum officer, paid us a visit the other
day. "Andy" takes a great interest in
his job, and came along to see a number
of trophies secured by the boys in some
of their recent adventures.
