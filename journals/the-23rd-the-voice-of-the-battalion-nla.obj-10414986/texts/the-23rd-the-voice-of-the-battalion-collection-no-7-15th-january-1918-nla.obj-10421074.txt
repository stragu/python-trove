THE VOICE OF THE BATTALiOM
No. 7. JANUARY 15, 1918. Price, Twopence.
ON RE-JOINING YOUR BATTALION.
1
The soldier knows that war is a dull
affair. That while a small part of his
days are spent in the excitement of the
line, by far the greater number are
occupied in*a routine which becomes ais
much the ordinary business of his life as
was his ordinary civil job. It is only
those who have never been who feel the
real thrill of war.
But if war has its dullness, it also has
its pleasures. And these are heightened
and deepened for ail of us by the tragedy
that becomes an everyday part of our
existence. There are the pleasures of
a good meal, a fine drink, and the comfort
of an unaccustomed bed. The senses are
quickened in appreciation of natural
well-being that in normal times is taken
for granted. There is no greater mistake
than to suppose soldiers became inured
to their discomforts and prefer the hard
and aching floor to the luxury of a
mattressedbed. If anyone should think
so let him. go with a soldier on leave.
He will find the tale very different.
But there are deeper pleasures
than physical well being. And these
also are increased by our abnormal life.
The emotions are freed from their con-
ventional retieence, expanding and
growing in a manner that means a vast
increase of joy to the soldier. We all
know it in letters. How a word from
iho.se we know and love in Australia
becomes the very fullness of happiness
to us. And what a freedom of express-
ion is found in those letters 1 Only the
constant presence of danger could throw-
aside the reserve that marks our ordinary
relations even with those we know best.
And perhaps this is most clearly marked
between men. They are given to think-
ing the expression of emotion rather
silly. Yet each one knows it is of the
salt of the earth. One of life's gifts that
help to keep it sweet.
And this brings us to the thought
which is the matter of these few words.
There is a joy that all of us have known
who have been long with our battalion.
The inevitable day comes when wounds
or sickness carry us away. It may be for
weeks, it may be for months, but
inevitably the day cbmes that sees our
return. And what a joy that first
moment of re-union is! The dangers
and dullness ahead are forgotten, but
those that lie behind and have been
shared by our comrades give an elixir to
that first clasp of the hand and the first
cheery word that make one of the great
moments of our lives. It is doubtful if
any one of us will ever forget it.
Perhaps conditions lightened its dra-
matic effect. The previous days may
have been spent in those long, cold,
interminable train journeys that seem
an inevitable part of military movements
in France. Cold, tired and hungry we
are turned out on a siding in the dark and

rain. A march of some
cobbled roads and muddy lanes is rhe
usual sequence, and to a destination
unknown. Cursing the day we were
beguiled into the foolishness of enlisting
we strike at last a dimly lit camp of a
few tents encircling a muddy field. An
enquiry at the first tent elicits the reply,
"Hullo, why, I am glad to see
you."
You have lighted on someone from
your battalion. All your woes vanish.
There is the hearty hand-clasp and the
.smile of welcome. However meagre the
surroundings you feel at home. Other
pals arrive and join in the meeting. Some
supper arrives?let us hope a little whis-
ky'-'and once again the world seems
hearty. Such is one of the joys of war.
The pleasure of rejoining your battalion.

WAS MUSEUMS.
+
It will possibly be interesting to soldiers,
and certainly to civilians, that, the
Commonwealth government have decided
on the formation of War Museums
which will contain collections of war
trophies, photos, sketches, trench papers,
etc. The Australian war records section
is carrying out the work, and in order to
make the museums at least as fine as
any in the world each individual mem-
ber is asked to co-operate, so that it
should be a memorial worthy of the
A.I.F. Some units have already pro-
vided fine trophies, and unless all feel
the same enthusiasm, possibly some
thing historically valuable will be
lacking. It is up to the 23rd Battalion
to take a foremost part in this National
Scheme, just as they have done in most
things previously, and hand any trophies
of war in to the C.O. Do we want to
be overshadowed in this direction by
other units ? No.
AN APPRECIATION AFTER THE
LINE.
One day I lived where Death had broken
bounds
The next I travelled on the Underground
Sheer delights to me were common sights
and sounds.
The red and green lights letting trains
go through
The rush of passengers as evening grew
The neat advertisements that all eyes
drew.
Dear little child going your East-end way
What pleasure in your gurgling laughter
lay
After the drumming guns across the bay.
I saw a lady angry with the mass
Of hurrying scurrying thoughtless lad
and lass
Fleeing monotony ere the day should pass
I thought how she would like a lonely
trench
VCith *dead for company?' and all the
stench
The loss of friends'?and all its awful
wrench.
An old and stately man in corner placed
Frowned at a couple with hands inter-
laced, -
How dare they show their love so open-
faced !
He should have lived where womanhood
we miss,
No touch of hand, no soft caress-mo
kiss,
Only the memories of such eager bliss.
Oh. wan conductress, working wearily,
Opening and shutting doors so drearily,
As though life held you so contrarily.
I'd change your place for joy it would
impart
Of riding close to London's mighty
As thro' and tb.ro' it with the trains I
dart. ?L.G.S,


OFFICERS' MESS.
The advantages and comfort ot our
mess have been fully appreciated this
fortnight. Officers who have risen early
to go to work near the line, have been
able to come back to a fine fire in our
famous open fireplace, enjoy a good din-
ner and the pleasures of bridge in the
evening.
? Among the decorations at the New
Year was an M.C. for Capt. Pascoe. No
award could have been more wel�ome to
the other officers in the battalion. The
quiet unfailing cheerfulness with which
the Captain has always carried on his
work has been one of the marked features
in om- battalion life both in and out of
the line. We hear he is looking bonny
after his holiday. He is at the Chelsea
school.
We regret that Lieut, Bastow has been
evacuated to base with his old gastric
trouble.
Major Bateman has come back to us
after a fairly lengthy stay in the land
of training camps and queues. He now
acting C.O.
Lieut. Maddrell is once more with us.
We saw him first, his neat trim military
figure dressed in the smartest little trench
coat. He has always bean one of our
most " distingue" officers. We believe
his collar and tie are irreproachable even
in the severest trench. Someone asked
why we always call him " Lu Maddrell."
Surely because of our affection for him.
Most industrious salvage work has
been performed, by companies recently.
But when the delicate susceptibilities of
our new Major- 1 who it must be remem-
bered has only just attained bis majority
are shocked it is time to cry "halt."
It appears that a pair of silk stockings,
the necessary article for keeping them
firm on the leg and?it must be men-
tioned a pair of those articles that give
such elegant shape to the feminine form
were found outside a company dug-out
on a recent tour of inspection. Are there
any officers in B Coy who can explain
the salvaging of such essentially civilised
articles in such an essentially uncivil-
ised area.
A school for bricklayers has been sug-
gested. For officers to attend. One of
the lessons to include instruction in the
art of chimney building: It is said that
an officer undertook to build a fireplace
in a Coy. dugout. Immediately a fire
was built the home was filled with smoke.
No outlet had been made for that inevit-
able factor in a fire. We understand
that Lieut, Morrison's name has been
submitted as the first candidate.
The question is " who really secured
the mirror." It was certainly not Lieut.
Lowe. Lieut. Jenkins puts in. a strong
claim, but the transport also have a word
to say, and Lieut. Weir thinks it was
conveyed from the line by means of his
own initiation?aerial transport.
We extend our sympathetic congratu-
lations to the relatives of the late Lieut.
Brewster, who has been awarded the
.M.C. He was one of the most fearless
and beloved of our comrades. ,
The sporting element in the Battalion
are naturally glad to see Lieut. Kifk-
wood back with us, after treatment for
the injury received at the unit's sports
meeting. It is regrettable that, from
what " Kirky " says, he will not be able
to play Ills part in the athletics of the
Battalion for some time.
Captain Moss has gone to the 6fti
Training Battalion for six months. A
well earned change.
Capt. Farrell and Lieut. Hepburn have
returned irom Blighty looking well after
furlough.

PERHAPS.
We hear from an unreliable source? 1
the same chap told us we would be home
this Xmas?that a new system ot com-
munication is to be introduced between
Australia and the A.I.F.
A covering letter from the P.M.G. reads:
The present system of communication
based on the individual letter is cumber-
some and inefficient.
The new system is a rational appli-
cation of the collective principle, which
will obviate palpable disadvantages.
Correspondence to the forces now
comes under a few headings?the war,
politics, religion sport, fashions, love,
sundry happenings, etc.
Letters are merely simple or elaborate
groupings of these headings.
Take an example. ?Miss A sends a let-
ter to B who belongs to a Battalion
abroad. She may write 10 or 15 pages
but her letter without losing any of its
force could be condensed to say one hun-
dred words, arranged suitably in classifi-
cation, according to our headings. In
the condensed form the letter would read:
B is to get leave and come home im-
mediately. Her brindled cat has 8
kittens. The tennis has gone flat. Misses
X Y Z are married. Her new hat cost
�2 2s and so on.
That is -the application of the first'
principle. How for the second, which is
that of collectivism:
Miss A's letter has been treated and is
now reposing in a box at the Receiving
Bureau's office.
During the day Misses C D and E ar-
rive with letters for friends in the same
Battalion as B.
Their letters are summarised in the
same way as Miss A's was, and those
summaries it will be found, contain sub-
stantially the same items of news as Miss
A's did.' The minor details may vary,
but the broad classification holds.
For instance Miss C's hat may have
cost �5 ss, Miss D's cat had 3 kittens, or
Miss Es tennis has gone better than ever.
That does not affect the application of
the principle.
At the end of the day, a collation of all
the summaries is made. The addresses
naturally being grouped in units and the
results cabled. On the following day in
France, at a mail parade, one hour before
breakfast, the O.C. will read
To 23rd Battalion. ?Weather dull and
showery in 537 parts ; fine 632 ; 627 men
to apply for leave to get back to Aus-
tralia and be married, because 1820
women want them so; 60 cats, black,
white and brindled, had 843 kittens; 25
hats cost �33, all are beauties ; conscrip-
tion is a certainty, 810 ; no hope, 43 ; 725
sports lost �750 on Cup day ; 28 horses
ought to have won, and so on.? Signed,
No. 1 Bureau, Melbourne.
The advantages of the new system over
the old are obvious. It will be proved
to be most economical, prompt and
efficient, and if news from home is
regarded as a mental ration every man is
assured of his portion.
Strange as it may seem the scheme as
outlined above has not met with
undivided approval.
The Love Sick Flappers League has
denounced the whole thing as unneces-
sary, unnatural and horrid.
The Rev. Theosophus Pullegg, in an
interview not long ago, said:
"The whole thing is ludicrous, For
three years now I have sent a weekly
letter of 17 pages dealing with current
religious topics to my young friends at
the front, and they have always reached
them."
To which, at a iater hour, a sporting
individual replie d:
" And a jolly good reason why. We
want a change.?M.W.

"THE CHARGE OF THE "LIGHT"
BRIGADE."
[With apologies to Tennyson.]
Half a loaf, half a loaf issue.
To cut out six equal shares, thick as thin
tissue.
There was the jam on the wall.
Margarine, fromage and all,
Lined up there yonder.
Hounds to the right of them
Hounds to the left of them.
Grumbled like thunder
It was the jaws of, well
Unappeased hunger.
EPISODES.
Lieut. W. to Band Sergeant?"We
want half-a-dozen more men on this
tarring job Sergeant."
Sergeant W.?"Well Sir, half the band
are already black with tar."
Lieut, W. : "That's just it Sergeant, we
can't have half the band turning out
black on parade and the other half
white."
The same officer is noted for his
humor, and the following little conversa-
tion was overheard up in the forward
area the other day. Some telephone
lines had to be laid and connected in a
certain time, so the following:
Lieut. W.: "I want you chaps to stay
and finish this job. J suppose you have
brought your lunch with you."
Sig.: "No Sir, we ate that at breakfast
this morning."
Lieut. W.: "Oh well, you'll have a
good tea when you get home this after-
noon."
Sig.: "Oh no Sir, we ate that for
breakfast also."
Lieut, W.: "Well then, you'll have a
good appetite for your breakfast in the
morning."
??? A BALL ON THE BATTLEFRONT.
?t ?
Just the ?' dizzy limit" in festivity was
reached when the 6th Field Ambulance,
A.I.F. actually organised and carried out
only a lew kilometres from the firing
line, an excellent fancy dress ball, with
all the embellishments, decorations, and
musical perfection of a private life
function. The only absent factor was
the fair sex. However, the " ladies "
were very cleverly improvised with
the aid of make up and female apparel,
begged, borrowed, or from various
sources.
The C.O. of the Corps (Col. Mozeley)
took a great interest in the function,
which was a pronounced success. The
24th Battalion dispensed melody for the
waltzes, two-steps, sets and other terpsi-
chorean frivolities. Costume prizes were
awarded as follows :
Best dressed lady-Pte. R. Jennings.
Best sustained character Pte, Mowat,
" Gippo Book Black."
Consolation prizes were presented by
Capt. Pottinger, dental unit, to Pte H.
Hardy " Imp. M.P," and Pte. B. Williams
as "Charlie Chaplin."
The 23rd Battalion were represented
by Ptes. R. Davidson, A. Forest, and J.
Tomlinson as M.M. Clemeneau and son
CHARACTERISTIC APPRECIATION.
Without vouching for its originality,
we publish the following humorous ap-
preciation by an Anzac of some of our
fair knitters:
" Dear Lady.-I thank you for the sox?
some fft!
I use one for a hammock, the other for
a mit.
Some day I hope to meet you, when I ve
done my bit;
But in the meantime, tell me where the
h?11? you learned to knit."? J.B.

BIG SPECTACULAR PANTO.
Produeed for the first time on any
battiefield," Yes, written, rehearsed
and acted within four miles, of the Iront
line, within range ot all Fritz's guns,
and in the gas danger zone. Shelled by
day and bombed by night. Can anyone
at home realise it while they sit in their
armchairs or bask in the warm, southern
sun ? It's a fact, and one which can be
verified by thousands of our boys, to
whom it has given pleasure and relax-
ation during leisure hours, or while rest-
ing prior to another attack on the enemy.
Why, even while the producer, L.-Cpl.
Frank Crossley, one time member of our
own battalion, was writing the screed on
a glorious moonlight night, a bomb fell
close enough ro almost upset the im-
provised soldiers' theatre. But undeterred
these actors in khaki carried on, and
" Diek Whittington and his Cat " has
long since passed the first night stage, to
remain a pleasant memory to Australians
and "Tommies" alike, when many
others have faded.
Now for those who filled the caste
As "Dick" Fred Reade looked just as
positively handsome as Frank Crossley
looked plain as the leading soubrette
character, " Martha Mixit." " Idle
Jack," or better, Idol Jack (Harold Shaw)
was responsible for more screams than a
mouse at an old maid's tea party. The
next best fun provokers were Harry Ross
and Hugh Gannon, as two jolly tars.
Bobbie Roberts played "Alice," "she"
looked sweet, and sang sweetly too. Les.
Williams did "Alderman Fitzwarren"
well, and Jack Davey lent dignity to
Fitz.'emporium as "shop-walker." Jas.
Gibb made a most affectionate cat, and
was also responsible for a clever comedy
juggling act. Ben Davies led the chorus
and Ralph Sawyer, as Fred Reade's
partner, created a furore in the Apache
dance. What with the Egyptian ballet,
topical songs and jokes, the
whole panto, was a humorous riot.
The dozen scenes were painted by
Gervais Cooper; stage properties im-
proved by Cpl. Bower, electric light and
effects by Wallie Euxford, while the
costumes were designed and dances
arranged by Ptes. Reade and Roberts.
Driver Donovan musically directed, and
the programmes were printed by the 23rd
Battalion Press. The whole show was
splendidly managed' by Rannall-Carlisle,
with a staff including C. Jessop. W.
Holiowell, R. Seagraves, R. Watson, J.
H. Shaw (operator), and Smith (engineer.)
