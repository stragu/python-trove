ANNIVERSARY.
May Btli, the date on which the Sou-
venir of the Battalion was published,
marked the anniversary of the sailing of
the Unit from Melbourne three years'
ago. Its career through that time has
been an unblemished one, with many
honors to its credit, and none for the
other side of the conduct roll. We have
had our losses of comrades, and sadness
has been our feeling more than once, but
withal we have had little gleams of sun-
shine, and on those occasions, when
something great has been done, we have
felt that after all action and work is a
great panacea for sorrow.
That feeling of unity and pride so
pronounced since the beginning has
lately been stronger than ever, and help-
ful in a great degree to those joining up
from time to time. As we enter the
fourth year of active service we do so
with the full determination to uphold the
laurels of the past, and perhaps add to
the list. " Forward, Undeterred," is our
motto, and while looking for the silver
with which every dark cloud is said to
be lined, we do so with that finest of
English words? HOPE-uppermost in
our minds, and the belief that the next
Bth May will see us hack on the other
side of the world.

A MUSE FROM BLIGHTY
"Truly ye come of the blood," our
Empire's most worthy son,
Giving the best of your efforts, knowing
the deed to be done;
Throwing aside all comfort, home, and
the pleasures of ease,
Keeping them only in memory? the tired
heart to please.
Ever facing forward ; with courage, and
full of cheer,
For laughter was ever a tonic ?no room
for the grumbler here.
Yet never forgetting the hundreds which
fought with you side by side,
And fell as they fought?you saw them
you know how they died.
But remembering always the Promise,
which the Lord of Hosts hath said,
"In that day when I make up my Jewels,"
and you smile and think of the dead.

THE WAR MUSEUMS.
We. have all been told of the museums
lhat will be built in Australia after the
war for the purpose of housing represen-
tative collections of the present conflict.
But although everyone is familiar with
the proposal, it still needs to be driven
home that the present is the only time
when a really genuine collection can be
made. If these days are let slip by when
priceless trophies can be obtained so
easily, the opportunity will have gone
for ever. The matter must be viewed
with imagination.
The museums divide themselves into
two classes, and their contents are also
twofold. There is the big Commonwealth
museum and there are the local museums
which will be in the big towns and dis-
tricts. These collections will contain
the trophies particularly dear to batt-
alions associated with the districts, the
big museum will show ta future genera-
tions by what methods and what material
this great war was waged. It is obvious
that every museum cannot have a tank.
But the intimate trophies collected by a
battalion and symbolising with some
of its finest achievements will find a
home in a district most closely assoc-
iated with that battalion. It is a matter,
of coutse, in which units will have to
trust the organisers. But units can be
certain that full justice will be done in
this respect. That the Commonwealth
museum will not be enriched at the ex-
pense of the local ones.
And for the methods of building up
this valuable record. There is the work
of the artists and sculptors, who will fill
the gallery allotted to pictures of famous
places and personalities ; there is the
library with its war diaries and books;
there are models of trench life. All
these things will he the work of those
appointed to organise the museum re-
cords. But there is the other side, the
small tilings that alone will bring home
to our sons, grandsons and far distant
generations what this war really meant
to each one of us. This can be done
only through the articles collected now.
There is scarcely a useless article to-day
that will not make a priceless trophy.
And it is because the articles appear so
useless to us that they are so seldom
preserved. It is not enough to say " Why
not visit any salvage dump?" The
articles need some little history attach-
ing to them that will bring vividly be-
fore the spectators what the hourly life
in the war was like. And it can be done
only through those apparently useless
articles. And as there are to be several
museums so a large number of these
things will be required.
If the men in a battalion would re-
member this and preserve any trophies
they see, arrangements are in existence
for them to be directed to the war
museum staff. Nor need the men fear
that special trophies will be given to a
museum in another State than that to
which he belongs. A properly labelled
article containing a few remarks as to
the history and by whom given will one
day figure in the local museum with all
those vitally interesting facts set forth
and the name of the giver attached for
all time. The staff has its work in
building up a scheme that will make the
museums of thrilling interest to future
generations of Australians. But without
the help of the men who are fighting on
the fields to-day the museums will be
lacking in just that intimacy that alone
will make them alive. The material lies
in abundance behind every front line.
It only needs a little imagination and
energy for it to be collected and for-
warded to the recording staff. ?L.G.S.

AS OTHERS SEE US.
For a considerable time we have been
the recipients of congratulations from
various sources, both civil and military,
on our regimental paper, and perhaps
those in the Battalion, as well as at home,
will be interested in the general good
opinion held of the " 23rd " in England,
France, and Australia. We therefore
quote a few :
Dear Colonel Brazenor, ??
I have received and
read with considerable interest the copies
of your Battalion newspaper. Its "issue
marks an important event in the history
of the Battalion, and besides being of
very great interest to the members there-
of and their friends across the ocean it
should be of considerable historical im-
portance later on.
Yours sincerely,
J. PATON.
Lieut. P. L. Harris, Editor " Aussy,"
says ; Congratulations on your paper.
It improves with each issue, and you
certainly do marvellous work with the
plant at your disposal."
The Officer in charge of Australian
War Records section : " Copies necessary
to complete the issues are needed, and
will be glad if they could be forwarded.
They will be an appreciated portion of
the War Museums."
Thus the Melbourne "Herald" in a
recent issue : " ' Forward, Undeterred,' "
is the motto on the title page, which
also bears record of the main battles
fought by the battalion-Lone Pine,
Gallipoli, Armentieies, Pozieres, Ba-
paume and Bullecourt. The cover is of
brown paper, in conformity with the
prevailing paper famine, and the journal
consists of eight small pages. Each line
which does not convey useful informa-
tion is humorous and optimistic in tone,
and it is evident that the 23rd is in good
heart.
A Victorian mother of three fighting
boys, one of whom is in the 23rd Battn.,
writes: " I feel I must congratulate you
on your very newsy little paper. In one
edition you hoped it would reach Aus-
tralia. Well it has, and is now eagerly
looked forward to by all who have some-
body near and dear in the battalion. As
my boys say, it is "tres bien," and I hope
it is a little encouraging to know how
much it is appreciated in Australia."
BEFORE ACTION
' 4-
Theoretically every soldier before a
stunt should become meditative, devout,
and concerned with things that are not
of this world. In actual practice, how-
ever, the reverse is the actual case, and
the average soldier is never so inclined
to levity and lightheadedness as just on
the eve of battle.,
Which recalls the experience of an
ardent moralist who approached a little
group tempting fortune with the inevit-
able pennies.
Before action," he said to one of the
group, You don't, of course, go in for
this, do you ? "
No," replied the lad slowly, " before
a stunt does make a difference ?then
we double the bets ! "
Much the same was that writing on
one of the busses recently, "This way
to the fight; Is the whole way ! "
But do not be deceived, scratch this
veneer of levity and you will come to
sterner stuff, only pretend never to notice
it, even in your pal. M.W.

"ANY COMPLAINTS?"
(Contributed.)
The old man growled as he ncared the camp
"Not a hut in sight, spare m' days,
You can bet we'll have furthest to tramp,
We get the dirt rubbed in always.
The other Battalions get all the luck,
While we get all that is rotten,
And when there's a chance of poking muck
You can bet we're never forgotten."
At last we lobbed at a Frcnohy's place,
Such au awful whiff as we enter,
The littered yard was an awful disgrace
With a cess pool in the centre.
Of course this riled old dim Gum more,
You'd ha' thought him almost barmy ,
He cursed the stables, foul-smelling floor,
And everything in the Army.
Well, we settled ourselves in our new abode,
Made up quite respectable possies,
While scouts went out for eggs and wood,
As is the way with Aussies.
Then old Bill let his woes transpire
As we emptied our baversacs
'Neath a leaky roof he sat by the fiie
And talked about bouviacs.
"Reckon you're talking Egypt," one said,
" Heliopolis or Tel-el-Kebir,
Where covered with sand from feet to head
We thirsted for canteen beer.
I'll ne'er forget those manoevres, I know,
'Twas no co]), I say on the level,
To signal a message for all I could go,
Then chase the O.C. like the d .
Those were the days with "Knobbo" chief,
And Briud was the man of affairs,
Till fortune of war brought sincere grief
For the fallen at l'ozicres.
The gallant O.C.s of A, B, C ar.d Don
Held the hcaity goodwill of their men,
And who could help but dote upon
Such a fine, manly character as Ken.
The tire burned up with a ruddy glow,
And all became reminiscent,
They talked of happenings of long ago
Of scenes that were varied and distant.
Of the voyage upon the good old " Eurip,"
The well deck, mess mons or
Then how old Abdul pelted Brown's Dip
With salvos of broomstick bombs.
Then came rare tales of what had been don#
Sufficient to make a bloke stare,
How many had got into grips with the llmr
In the raid near Armentieres.
A hundred odd subjects thus seemed to fit
Into the mixed conversation,
Of charges, barrages, unhealthy chalkpit,
Somewhere in Eranee ?Contalmaison.
Mentioned was sector where we had fought,-
The Somme ot somewhere about,
Troneswood, Becourt, Mamctz, Fricourt,
Near Ginehy or Scott's lledoubr.
Of llun observation from his (>. P. station
On the Butte dc Warhneourt,
His cvacnation.--scraps in open formation,
Bight up to Bullecourt.
Of how we clung to the Hindcnbcrg line,
When the flanks were hanging to blades,-
Or in Broodsiende, that somehow reminds
Us of tales that are perfect hair-raisers.
These stories were told of dangers facial,
Faded with the courage or men,
How comrades fought, and not disgraced
The confidence placed in them.
I turned to Bill in jest to say
That others had records brighter,
When he opened out in his little way.
He said Now look here, you blighter,
I growl and curse the heads of this show,
Heap up blasphemy undeterred,
Yet, all the same, I want you to know
That I am proud of the Twenty-third.
A hen is like the British Empire-- her
son never sets.

LINE DOINGS.
After a fatiguing march and a hurried
? ouncil of war, near a wood, we trudged
orward through the darkness and the
nud to take over.
The relief of a famous unit completed,
ve started immediately on a programme
f work, rendered necessary by the
absence of cover, and the inclemency of
the weather. Material was collected
and carried, and parties organised, and
by the end of the first period all the for-
ward people were under some sort of
shelter.
The ensuing few days back provided a
well-earned respite, the brighter feature
of which was baths for all?'a further
indication of the battalion's initiative in
looking after the boys.
The next period was far less trying to
all.
Among some of the best who were lost
to the battalion this time were Sgts.
Foote and Ellis. The first-named, who
was sniped while endeavoring to get to
close quarters with a Bosche patrol, had
had an especially long and honorable
association with the battalion, and his
loss is deeply regretted by all.
At a later date Lieut. Boss was also
killed, and his stalwart figure and bluff
personality will be greatly missed by
his fellow-officers, and the men of C Coy.
Throughout the period few other changes
veie recorded.
The C.O. showed his usual masterly
grip of detail throughout the whole piece
in a manner that inspired cheerfulness,
in all ranks. In this he was ably second-
ed by the Adjutant, whose activities
ranged from pin-pricking a map to dig-
ging out a new 8.H.Q., when matters
became interesting.
Capt, Orr and his band of helpers had
rather a busy time, unfortunately, but
they were equal to the occasion, and
carried on magnificently, as usual.
And last, but not least, were the Coy.
officers and men, whose conduct was
right level with the battalion's standard,
beyond which it is impossible to further
eulogise.
