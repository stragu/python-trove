Regimental Recreation.
Recreation is a necessity to life, and
now that we are awaiting the happy
hour of discharge, the latest innovation
in the shape of a reading, writing, and
recreation room for the Battn. has re-
ceived the appreciation of all. These
little institutions are fixed in the Rue
Neueve, where two rooms were given
grateously by M. Buck, of Marcinelle,
with a third
apartment in
the Rue de
Hayes, do-
nated by
another resi-
dent. The
scheme was
organised by
Ser g t. B .
Milne, and
with the as-
sistance of
the Adjutant,
Lieut, Find-
lay, is now
an accom-
plished fact.
For the pro-
vision of games and writing material we
have to thank the Church Army, and the
Y.M.C.A. for magazines and reading
material, with the promise of a billard
table later. It is one of the finest
schemes yet introduced, and under the
management of Cpl. Young, Ptes. Mc-
Millan, Quincey and Dvr. Bussell, is sure
of permanent patronage by the boys, who
will readily avail themselves of the
benefit?luntil such time as we arrive
home, when
th es e and
other such
things be-
come un-
necessary.
We are in-
debted to M.
F. Delacre
& Fils for
the Belgian
views pro-
duced in this

ingenuity of such experts as Sgt. ?Fat?
and his little band of workers. Many of
his gang are noted characters in the Bat-
talion. A number of amusing incidents
originate from that quarter, perhaps the
best known being one by ? Yin Blanc? on
? How I came to enlist,? a tale of the
Wallaby. Much more could be said
about the work of the pioneers, but we
must not imagine that he forgets his rifle.
At any old time he may be called upon to
substitute his tools for his ?best friend,??

NOTES.
Sergt. S. J. Ro-
bertson has been
sent to hospital
with illness.
The last bat-
talion dance was a
thorough success.
The old manage-
ment carried, out
the affair under the
Presidency of Lt.
J. Smith. About
50 couples danced,
to the music of
piano, violin and
cornet. It is in-
tended to conduct
these dances regu-
larly while we are
here.
Lieut. L. J. Short
is now official cor-
respondent to the
A.I.F.
The 6th Brigade Cinema intend to run
a concert party in conjunction with the
pictures. Our old friend, Jim Romaine
will take part.
A number of our old officers have re-
turned to the battalion pending em-
barkation. Likewise a number of our
soldier comrades.
Football.
?? ?
The final match of the Inter-Divisional
competition in Australian Rules football
will be played on Saturday, March 22nd
at Mont St, Marchienne, between teams
representing the first and second Aus-
tralian Divisions.
The 23rd contribution to the team is
Lieut. J. A. Phillips, C.S.M. Cameron,
Sergt. Garden, and Cpl. Yeomans.
Both teams have been defeated twice,
and a good exhibition of football is ex-
pected.
The second div-
ision won the
Corps Champion-
ship in both Soc-
cer and Rugby,
both teams being
undefeated.
Incidental to the
above it might be
well for those who
play football in the
street to remember
'?there are win-
dows in Belgium.?
Not only that, the
bootmakers, the
hairdressers, and
printers are of an
extremely nervous
temperament.
There are damages
also to be consid-
ered.

l'Universite du Travail.
Mt no greaf;dlsfanpe from la Place de
la Vilie Haq.fe, Charleroi, stand two
large, substantially built, airy, modern
brick buildings. These together form
rUjhiversite du Travail, which before the
war was an excellently equipped Techni-
cal College, the finest of its kind in
Belgium.
Ih;normal times, the Belgian lad in
this./town or neighborhood commences,
at the age of ten, his manual training in
conjunction with his general education ;
and-it was primarily with the object of
providing the most efficient manual train-
ing |)ossible that such, colleges as the
University du Travail were founded.
Under this sy stem, a boy emerges at the
age of eighteen as a journeyman trades-
man. Some, however, pursue advanced
courses, and four years or so later qualify
for a diploma.in architecture, surveying,
engineering, ior, some other such pro-
fession.
Thus it will be seen that the manage-
ment of this institution conferred no
small benefit on the men of the 2nd Aus-
tralian Division in throwing open its
doors to receive as many of them as
could be accommodated, and for whose
training sufficient, tools and material
cou Id be found.. Our friend, '?the Boche,?
during his occupation of Belgium,
evidently considered that the fine equip-
ment of the University, consisting of
hundreds of machines of various kinds
for demonstrational purposes, together
with tools and stores of material, would
bp much more valuable to him in techni-
cal schools far young Fritz and Hans
that adorning the walls of workshops
for Belgian students, and acted accord-
ingly. For this reason when the Aus-
tralian ?occupation? of Charleroi took
place there was little to be seen in the
workshops but the traces of a former
glory.
Great strides have been, and are being
made towards the re-equipment of the
workshops and the replacing of the lost
mechanical models ; and in this matter
the Australian invaders have rendered
a great deal of assistance. One ex-
ample might be quoted. The black-
smith?s shop, when the first class of
Australians entered, was almost devoid
of the ordinary tools of the trade. The
class, therefore, under the guidance of
an instructor commenced its course in
blacksmithing by making for itself a set
of necessary tools.
What impresses the visitor most is the
excellence ot the work done by the men.
Another fact that cannot fail to strike
him is that each man is taking to his
work a great fund of interest and in-
dustry. He does not see a man idle, for
all are working for the love of doing
something. Here there are none of the
jealousies between employer and employe
that one finds in the real industrial life
of to-day ; and grown men enter into
their work with the same zest, as child-
ren into play. This furnishes us with a
fine example of the attitude to work that
might and would exist were employers
and employes each more sympathetic in
their endeavour to finderstand the others?
point of view, and were they capable of
seeing that co-operation and not antag-
onism is the secret of all really success-

ful industrial enterprise. As an ex-
ample of the attitude to work that exists
at the University, one sees a man in the
. fitters? class with sleeves well up and
shirt front open, perspiring treely at his
work with a file. When asked,however,
how he likes his job, he replies, ??This
job will always do me while we are here.
It?s better than shoeing horses for the
army.?
Space will not permit
a detailed account of all
that one may see en-
' gaging the attention of
Australian soldier-stu-
dents at this fine school.
One must be content with
giving the merest outline.
In the woodwork room
the beginners are getting
experience in the use of
tools by working at a set
of graduated exercises in
the making of joints.
Cabinet makers of ex-
perience are supplied
with the necessary tools
and materials, and given
a chance of?getting their
hands in? once more;
while there is a variety
of wood-work machines
for the use of those who
are following that branch
of the trade.
The electrical fitters
commenced by making a
wire strainer, and follow-
ed this with a fine little
switch and some practice
in wire joining. The two
articles first mentioned may be retained
by those who make a practice of collect-
ing ??souvenirs de la guerre.?
It was found that the blacksmithing
c!a�s consisted for the most part of
farmers who desired to know enough of
the trade to repair their own farm imple-
ments, etc., and for this reason the in-
structor has designed his course specially
to meet the requiremen ts of these men.
Another interesting class is that for
motor mechanics. Some invalided Ger-
man motors have been ?'salvaged? and
dismantled, and the parts used to build
up already at least one car that runs.
There are also classes for
boiler makers, telephone
amd telegraph mechanics,
fitters, machinists, and
industrial chemists, and
what is called a handy-
man?s course is about to
be started.
At the time of writing
there are 265 men of the
Division receiving in-
struction (of whom
twenty wear a chocolate
and red diamond), and it
is expected next week
that the number will be
increased to the vicinity
of 400.
Considering the diffi-
culties that have been
met and overcome, one
cannot pay too high a
tribute to the 0.C., Lieut.
Lawrie of the 2nd Div.
Engineers, and his staff
of instructors, who have
secured the whole-heart-
ed assistance of the Bel-
gian teachers. One can-
not conceive of a better
method of employing our
men while awaiting demobilization than
by preparing them for the resumption of
civil life. Those who have the privilege
of attending a course at the University
du Travail are indeed fortunate. ?E.B.P.

Battalion Organisation.
THE PIONEERS.
Little is perhaps known of the im-
portance of the Pioneer section of the
Battalion, and the amount of work they
do.
During the present war, the battalion
pioneers have more than justified their
place on the establishment of Head
Quarters. Their work has been in-
valuable to the battalion, both in the line
and in billets.
The section, sometimes called the
?bees? of the battalion, at the present
time is composed of one
Sergeant, in charge of the
section, with ten men, all
skilled artisans at their
various trades (carpen-
ters, engineers, painters,
plumbers, etc.) Though
really part of the Q.M.
branch, more often the
pioneer section work
directly under the Ad-
jutant, especially while
in the line. The sanitary
section, at the time the
battalion left Australia,
formed part of the pioneer
section, but since coming
to France has been a
seperate unit, acting under
the medical officer, yet
always dependant on the
pioneers for any constructional work,
such as latrines, ablution places, cook-
houses, etc. The work while the bat-
talion were in the line was always
strenuous. The. section were, when
possible, situated at Battalion H.Qrs.,
not often a healthy locality, or as some
people imagine a place where all jobs
are of the ?cushy? order. H. Qrs. itself,
oftimes situated in cellars or old build-
ings, very often required the first at-
attention. Then comes the great work
ofgiving a decent burial to those of our
pals who have made the great sacrifice.
Where possible the body is taken to a
secluded spot behind the line, and laid to
rest with other comrades, the Padre read-
ing a short burial serviee. In the actual
advance the section is actually a carry-
ing party, and it is their job to get am-
munition, bombs, etc. to the front line.
Many tall tales are told of
these trips to the front
line, and, as our friend
? Cocker? once said while
on the job at Bullecourt:
?Pioneering ain?t no cushy
job about Somme parts.?
While ontof the line (at
rest?) the pioneers first
thoughts were a job that
all hands were ever willing
to undertake, that of mak-
ing and erecting crosses, a
small token or tribute in
itself, but one which the
battalion has at all times
endeavoured to carry out
well. The battalion have
a standard design of cross,
with the inscription carved
into the woodwork and painted black.
While in the vicinity of Cappy-sur-
Somme the total number of crosses erected
was over 60. The workshop about this
time was a veritable hive of industry.
The lack of material often tested the

Down the Rhine.
?Nach Coin.?? On the way to Col-
ogne. What will Germany be like ? My
first idea of entering Hunland had always
been after marching many kilos. Instead
I?m lying in a bunk of what was once a
hospital train drawn by a German engine
and two Bosche drivers, and incidentally
moving at a very decent pace. The train
stops. Someone says this is Kerberthal,
the border town. I jump out of my bunk
all eager for a sight of Hun life. Yes,
they?re Huns all right. The sight of that
drab grey cloth gives one a tingling of
the pulse. But what?s this ? A man ap-
proaches dressed like a staff officer, salutes
us and says ?Funfteen minuten hier.
Ober Lentnant. Wateraal Bahnsteig
Ein,?? which explained meant we had fif-
teen minutes there, and that there was a
cafe on No. 1 platform. So off we go,
and have a cup of the vilest coffee ever
made, and off again. So this is Germany.
After a short run through Aix la
Chapelle we arrive at Cologne. Onleav.
ing the station we are up against the
Cathedral and crane our necks to look up
at its two tall spires. It is certainly very
beautiful and is quite untouched although
a good landmark for British airmen.
The next thing that strikes us is the
cleanliness of the city itself. However
delay is impossible, for necessity demands
a hotel. The Town Major provides the
billeting slip, with instructions as to pay-
ment etc.
To create a good impression with the
British is the evident keynote, for we find
a modern hotel, with porters and all sorts
of people fussing round. In the cafes,
shops, and everywhere it is the same, even
among the women and children. Their
motive becomes more apparent as they
realise the impossibility of a return to the
old friendship. We pass down the main
street (the Hohenstrasse) and many small
things are noticable. The Hun servility
(pretended perhaps), the punctilious man-
ner in saluting, the quickness in making
way for us to pass?< acknowledging the
superiority of the British army.
In the shops are English signs and all
kinds of articles from iron crosses or 4711
Eau de Cologne to Goertz cameras
and Zei�s field glasses ; all marked up
at ridiculously cheap prices to enveigle
the British to commence trade again.
But we did not see any rushes to buy
these things, and in this direction, also
the Huns must be having a lot to think
about. A visit to ?Das Opernhaus,?
where an opera of Wagner?s is being
played, reveals another side of the Ger-
man nature, for in every cafe, small or
large, we find' an orchestra?Beethoven,
Wagner, Schmran, etc.?the smallest
plays them all. We wander along until
we come to the boast of all Germans ?Der
Rhein.?? It really is a fine big river. A
walk brings us to the Hohernzollern
bridge, with its massive statues of two
members of the Imperial'llt�use guarding
the entrance. At present, however, a
smart English guard has relieved the
family of all responsibility. This bridge
carries two sets of railway lines, two elec-
tric tram lines, a carriage way and foot-
paths. It isn t beautiful but is built with
all the German ideas of solidity, and in
THE TWENTY-THIRD. 15th March.

presents rather an ugly appearance.
Over the bridge and we have crossed
the Rhine. An electric tram takes us
down to Bonn, which has a fine univer-
sity. Somebody remembers that Beet-
hoven was born here, so off we go to
look for his house, eventually finding it
in a very small street. For a few marks
the old caretaker shows us round. All
the old manuscripts are kept in this
home. The original draft of the Moon-
light Sonata interests us, likewise his
piano, although now badly out of tune.
Back to Cologne, and we catch a train
down the river for Coblenz. We are
nowin the American area. Here the
Moselle runs into the Rhine. The junc-
tion of these two big rivers is marked by
a tremendous statue of Kaiser Karl
Frederich on horseback, again of typi-
cally German build, while at the top of
the hill on the other bank is the Herts-
breiten fortress,
tormidab 1 e and
frowning, co m -
manding the ap-
proaches along the
Moselle valley and
both banks of the
Rhine; just now
the flag flying on
the staff is not
German, and and
an American sol-
dier can be dis-
cerned on ?sentry.?
From Coblenz to
Mainz the river be-
comes even more
grand, and all along the opposite bank
castles appear at intervals?the old
mediaeval type that one read about in
Grimm?s Fairy Tales. Built way up on
the furthermost crag or peak one won-
ders if the occupants have aeroplanes to
reach their front door. Arriving at
Mainz we tram it to Wiesbaden, cross-
ing the Castel bridge, the longest struc-
ture across the Rhine, covering a length
of 680 yards, Wiesbaden, the most
famous of watering places in Germany,
is certainly all that has been written
about it, The home of about 170 mil-
lionaires who have all spent thousands
of marks beautifying the place. It rests
at the foot of a range of hilts which
supply the town with its famous waters,
in fact a bath in Wiesbaden can be sel-
ected from as many as eight different
classes of water. The Kurhaus or Cas-
ino is a magnificent building, and one
can listen to a symphony orchestra there
from three in the afternoon until ten at
night. This is the French area, and
discipline does not seem as strict as in
the British zone
perhaps. The
type of Germans
in Wiesbaden are
considered to be
a high standing
intelligent type.
Music, song, and
Rhine wine ap-
pear to be their
favorite mode of
life. Every Ger-
man has his or her
bottle of ? Osken-
heiner ? in much
the same way as
we have our after-
noon tea.
Time is passing, so off once more.
This time for Strasburg, and then on to
