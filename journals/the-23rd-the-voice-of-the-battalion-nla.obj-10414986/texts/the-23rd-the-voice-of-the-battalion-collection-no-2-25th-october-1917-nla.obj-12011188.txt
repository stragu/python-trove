THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION ]|
A XMAS MESSAGE.
? '
HERJ&we are approaching Xmas 1917,
and in the fourth year of our travail.
But are we downhearted ? No ! Home-
sick perhaps. This message we send to
you on the eve of Yule Tide.?"Never
at any moment during this plash of arms
for Honor and Right 'gainst Savagery
and Might have we Australians felt
more confident of a'complete and glori-
ous victory over our enemy?perhaps
e ven before this.reaches its sunny destin-
ation will peace bells ring." Your
1 Christmas >yiU be spent under a sum-
-1 mer sky to t)\e strains of " Adeste
Fidelis," and the music of the bells;
'midst the froit and the flowers, and in
| the beams of a warm southern moon
?ours perchance in a dqg-out of mud
and mire?Somewhere ?to the ac-
companiment of the shells, the snow,
with thp chorus of Boom ! Boom!
Boom! but albeit with the surety of
a triumph, for humanity, and security
for you all. There is an affinity between
us, our thoughts are of each other, and
mingled with these thoughts is the proud
belief that we from the Southern Cross
are doing a great and earnest duty for
the Empire, and upholding the spirit of
the song of our boastful days, when,
with patriotic vigor, we shouted " when
the Motherland calls, 'Australia will be
there.'"
THE SEASON'S GREETINGS.
4
A Happy New Year, is our wish to you,
We are having a happy time too;
It's such fun to tlounder a.id stick in
the mud
Up to your thighs, thank God it's not
blood.
It's such a huge joke to see others fall
Into a shell hole, equipment and all.
Fritz sends greeting and a nice Xmas box,
A tabloid earthquake, and a few 'lectric
shocks.
What a great lark when a shell bursts
near by.
We scatter like shrapnel, then prostrate
we lie
In the oozy slime of France's fair land.
By gum, it's such fun-it is, it is grand.
How jolly it is when nice, teeming rain,
Wets everything thro'again and again;
Just lovely you know 'cause we're sure of
a drink,
Bum, did you say? Yes, I don't think.
It's a great bit of fun to go out on fatigue
In the land of No Man, when rest's
what you need;
And merry we are when out of the line,
Forming fours in the snow, and quick
marching time.
Yes, that is our New Year so you will see,
We are as happy as happy can be.
We think of those gone?comrades who
fell,
And giving Fritz something?giving him
Hell. ?" Dad."


THE TWENTY-THIRD.
The great night took them suddenly
At Pozieres and the Pine ;
They fell with Brind and Kennedy,
And by the Siegfried line.
But while a hand can hold a pen
Or human heart be stirred,
There'll be great honor to the men
Who made the Twenty-Third.
?C.E.W.B.
BATTALION COMPETITION.
Competitions were held under excellent
conditions on Saturday, 20th inst.
In judging the best turned out platoon
A[ajor Crowther, 21st batt., and Capt.
Bazeley, 23rd batt., were confronted with
a difficult task, and after a keen contest,
No. 3 platoon, A Coy., was declared the
winner, with No. 12 platoon, C Coy., a
close second.
Drill movements, under platoon com-
manders, resulted in a draw between 14
under 2nd"Lieut. Kirkwood, and
No. 5 platoon, B Coy., under 2nd Lieut.
F. Jenkins.
The verdict of the judge, C.S.M. Pad-
dock, who is a past master in platoon
competitions, was a popular one.
Although the time did not permit the
completion of the Lewis gun competition
the judges, Lieut. Ball, 24th batt., and
Lieut R. Bazley, 21st batt.. after a keen
contest, deciared a win for No. 2 team,
A Coy., with the maximum number of
points. Two teams from B Coy. and one
from D Coy. gained 95 points each. As
most of the men were fresh to Lewis gun
work, this was a very creditable perfor-
mance.
It was generally agreed that the com-
petition, originated by the commanding
officer, Lieut.-Col. Brazenor, and organ-
ised by Capt. Moss, Lieut. Anderson and
Lieut. Weir, was a decided success.
The band, under Sgt. Wilson, contri-
tubuted a fine and varied programme.
GENERALITIES.
Lieut. Roth Gordon is said to be pro-
gressing favorably towards recovery.
Some of the members of the Battalion
have been allotted to transport duty.
Rumor has it that erstwhile Sergeant
Toovey, of this battalion, is now a Cap-
tain in the Rjyal Engineers.
We wish to make feeling reference to
Lieuts. Brewster, Etheli, Woodburn,
Frost, and Moore, who made the great
sacrifice in a recent action.
, The improvement in the band con-
tinues. We want/to see it top-notch in
musical quality, so carry on Serg.
The receipt of news telling of the com-
plete failure of Fritz's latest stunt with
his new type air monsters was very
satisfying.
This issue represents an attempt to
produce something in the shape of a
Xmas souvenir for home. If we hav'nt
succeeded, please forgive us.
Vv e have just had a visit from Capt, C.
E. W. Bean, official war correspondent to
the Commonwealth. A poetical refer-
ence to ourselves from his pen appears
in the next column.
Capt. Beith has returned to the fold,
and is temporarily in command, in the
a K sence of the C.0., who is Acting
Brigadier. Capt. Pascoe is Acting second.
Lieut. Maddrell writes to compliment
us on the institution of the battalion
newspaper. He is well and doing well,
and inquires after everybody, especially
D company.
This comes from Germany through a
captured officer:?" The Australians are
the best thought of prisoners we have.
They are good tempered, and do the farm
jobs to which they are al.otted with fine
spirit."
If any member of the 23rd who is ab-
sent from the battalion desires to become
a s �bscriber to its very own paper, all
he need do is to forward an amount
covering a period of weeks, to Lieut.
Wiltshire, and it, will pe duly forwarded.
The pi ice of a single copy is Twopence.

OBSERVATIONS.
??7?
Our " bon vivant" Adjutant found
time only once to sliaye, wash and mani-
cure. Who said effeminate? Not on
your life.
Some old battalion identities passed
out this time, notably Rus. Hause, who
got one through the h>3ad, and Donovan,
the runner, who also had a long " run."
His number was 531. " Juggler " Davies
got a Blighty, which will keep him
away for some time.
Major Bateman writes that Lieuts.
Baker, McLaren and Holland are pro-
gressing favorably, though it will a little
while before Mr. Holland's face will be
fit to show Fritz again. Our solid sec-
ond in command, who is attending, a
school in England, is getting into con-
dition with a course of "Onguardinout."
We hear the dummy sacks are quite
knocked out. The Major has passed his
riding tests.
How a Tommy officer got the shock of
hw life?a story in a few words.?Lieut.
X of the Regiment, having lost his
way in the dark, walked iito a pill-box
up the line to inquire for his Regiment.
The sight which met his gaze caused him
to shake at the knees and turn ghastly
white, for in front of him sat a good
looking (?) Hun, with cap and fierce
moustache, evidently preparing plans
for our destruction. Fortunately the
" Hun " deigned to notice the intruding
English officer before he fainted, and re-
cognised in him an old acquaintance.
The Englishman looked again before ex-
piring, and the recognition became
mutual. He thereupon recovered morale.
It is inadvisable to wear Hun caps, even
if your head IS cold. What is wrong
with a steel helmet anyhow ? It cer-
tainly keeps off the drips from a dug-out
ceiling.
We are all sorry for Capt. A. J. Noall,
w;ho will not be able to sit up for some
time yet. Latest reports are favorable.
His wound was" fundamental." By the
way the Cap is at No. 1 Duchess of
Westminster Hospital, and writes, wish-
ing officers and men good luck. He
thanks the stretcher bearers for their
promptness and says he is lucky to be
aliv�. His M.O. thinks finis la guerre.
Our Padre turned up trumps. Two
journeys while we were " in," both times
with a pack full of cigarettes, gift of the
Y.M.C.A. They were much appreciated,
as everyone had just about run out of
smokes. Funny thing, when a man gets
a knock the first thing he asks for is
either a drink or a smoke.
The Battalion M.O. Capt. H. J. Orr
who had his first experience of some-
thing big in the hop-over line, came in
for all round commendation from the
men. His work was continuous and
fatiguing, but he smiled through it all,
and so did his assistants in the A.M.C.
Illustrating the spirit of our fellows
Best liop-over I've had in France," re-
marked a hefty private, as he " blew "
into Headquarters, loaded up with
souvenirs.
" SQUARE THE DINK."
When an "Aussy " goes home on his ten
days leave;
He's the time of his life no doubt.
The first days has " tabbies " and taxis
galore.
" Come on, have a booze ?" he will shout.
His ticket is made out for Scotland 'tis
true,
But the only Scotch he sees is whisky,
And, accompanied by "cobbers" from
" Woolloomooloo "
At times he'll get rather too frisky.
He may get a bit rash and blow up his
cash;
Even get stiff and might finish in clink ;
Still, he's had a good time?a " bonzer "
big dash?
Keep on smiling boys? " Square the
Dink."

IN MEMORIAM.
The following few lines are dedicated
to our gallant comrades, officers, non-
commissioned officers and men, who fell
while doing theirs and Australia's duty
during our last action :
In her hour of greatest trial, in the test
that lay in store,
Britain sent the call for succour to that
fai-off Island shore :
" Help the Motherland," was echoed
through the cities and the towns,
Through the forests and the ranches,
through the uplands and the downs.
When again across the oceans to those
'far off homes you go,
Where the Wattle and the Cactus 'neath
the sunshine ever grow,
May your memories often linger on fair
Britain's rocky shore,
And-the battlefields where comrades shall
return to Home no more.
[The above verses are taken from a
contribution received.]
Regarding our little paper, General Sir
Wm. Birdwood says "So many thanks
for sending me the first copy of your
23rd Battalion newspaper. I quite agree
that anything you can do to foster a
spirit of esprit de corps in the battalion
is quite excellent, and I wish you the
very best of good fortune in this
venture."
The following is an extract from a let-
ter received from Capt. C. Mills, 31st Bat-
talion, who is a prisoner in Germany, in
reference to a popular officer, also in the
enemy's hands Lieut. L. G. Grieve is
one of the pluckiest men I have ever
met. I know that ho does not know what
fear is, and in addition is. one of the most
popular officers in this camp." The
letter, which came through the High
Commissioner's office, states also that
Capt. Mills and all British officers are
not being well treated.

WHIZZ-BANGS.
?
A Merry Christmas to those at home
is the . wish of the lads who in France do
roam.
"Where will I dump the rations, Q.M.?"
asked the transport driver. " At the old
church," was the reply. " But they have
just put a 9in. shell into it." " Oh, never
mind, drop them in the hole."
If you want a cert Blighty try as a
recipe grooming a well-known mule in
the 23rd transport lines. He kicks like
a dirty rifle.
The "A nzac Coves" are really "coves"
worth knowing, you know. They are
" tres bon."
Xmas comes but once a year,
But there's not much strength in can-
teen beer.
To Let.?Handsome dug-out, facing
the weather. Apply the Editor, Mud-
street, Somewhere in Belgium.
Found dragging.?Top of fountain pen.
If the loser will apply at the editorial
sanctum of this publication he will be
ple'ased. Dinkum.
An English paper wants.to know when
England is going to wake up and help
Australia win the war.
Hum-or amongst the mud, even in
the murky Yser canal. These are stir-
ring times, hum-orous and otherwise.
The fall of Bap-aume was not in it.
Old Fritz's big Zepps. went roaming
in the gloaming. They met the French
airmen. The Huns now sing, " Will
they nb' come back again ? "
One of our " babblin' brooks " loves
the ladies, as shown by his romantic
ardour in showering kisses on a local
dame of many moons. Probably the
effects of chlorinated water ?probably.
" They tell me that the stews are weak,":
Observed the new-joined soldier;
" That all the bully beef is cold,
And really makes you colder."
The old-head cleared his hungry neek,
And said " I'll not defend it,
For the only ' hot joints,' on this track
Are the cooks who superintend it."
The popular soldier warbler, " Jimmy
Komaine," is with us again. A concert
should develop.
STOP PRESS.
FRENCH VICTORY.
The following message was received
from Brigade just as we went to press:?
French have taken about 7,500 pris-
oners, and 60 guns.
FINAL RESULTS, COMPETITION.
The concluding items of the Battalion
competitions were contested yesterday.
The opening event was the final between
Nos. 5 and 14 platoons, who had tied on
the first day for the best drilled platoon.
Mr. Jenkins had the satisfaction of see-
ing his platoon carry off the prize.
The relay race was run off in heats.
A and D Coys, surviving. A Coy. even-
tually scooped the francs.
The tug-fef-war went to C Coy., after a
tough go with B Coy. for final honors.
Kicking the football resulted in Pte.
Garden, of A Coy. winning the drop
kick, and Pte. Denier, of D Coy., the
place.
; The concluding event, the band race,
was won by Private Green. The big
drtlm was prominent until the half dis-
tance was reached, when amid a most ex-
traordinary medfey of sounds, the field
closed up, a very close finish resulting in
Greeh getting the verdict. Thustermin-
ated~& most interesting and instructive

PEACE, PERFECT PEACE.
By " Tomski."
The light, southern breeze was gently
stirring the leaves of the gums, the birds
were beginning to twitter their evensong,
for the day had been exceedingly hot.
Everything had suffered, and even now,
in the balm of the twilight, the feathered
world were only just answering each
other in a monosyllabic language of
their own?all save one, and this little
creature seemed to be in somewhat of a
thankful mood. As he soared aloft his
little throat filled, and he poured forth
thrill upon thrill of the joy that came
from his bird-like soul?a song of thank-
fulness Jhat the fierce rays of old Sol had
been overwhelmed by the coolness of the
evening.
The long, hot road is now being
shadowed by the giants of the forest, as
the sun goes down in the western hori-
zon. A lonely figure trudges onward,
heedless of his immediate surroundings.
His head is bent, and he limps slightly,
but in his eyes is a light of anticipation
that brightens his whole face. He has
walked far this day, with a determined
purpose, and his presence in the home of
his youth and manhood is unknown. He
looks not for the noisy reception accor-
ded a returning warrior. His clothes are
in vivid contrast to the quiet and peace-
ful surroundings, for he wears the proud
uniform of an Australian soldier.
A bend in the road brings him in sight
of a snug little homestead, nestling on
the side of a hill. The windows are al-
ready one blaze of light. There is an
air of festivity around, for it is the eve
of Xmas. The soldier's head goes up, he
smartens his pace, a big hearty guffaw
leaves his lips. He hears again the laugh :
of the Jackass and the warble of the mag-
pie, sweetly familiar. His glance turns
upwards into the branches of the gums,
and he voiced his feelings in the one re-
mark?" You're just great."
With slightly longer strides he ap-
proaches the house. Suddenly a door
opens and a grey haired mother appears.
She embraces him passionately, the pent
up love of years finding vent in the tears
that course down the wrinkled face. "My
boy! Home at last! " she cries, and is
enfolded in the arms of this bronzed
soldier. He struggles hard in his efforts
to answer her, but cannot, something
choking him. The old mother disen-
gaged his arms, and hand in hand they
cross the threshold, for a peace has
come into the home?a Xmas gift.
God's own Peace, 1

NOTES ON THE OPERATION OF
OCTOBER NINTH.
?
BY ONE WHO WAS THERE.
?j We formed up in our JOT at 4.20
) a.m. Fritz was fairly quiet; a good stait
I was made at Zero hour. D company
; were followed by A C and B.
j We got to our first objective with a
: good many casualties from machine
< gun fire on our right flank, and waited
| for our barrage to lift.
We reached the second objective
| Bright, and dug a series of posts con-
imeeting up with the sth Brigade on our
I left, but found we were not in touch on
our right. We therefore swung a post
i round to face our right flank, and Cor-
-1 poral Robertson did good work with a
patrol in that direction.
It was trying work with one flank "in
the air, "and our boys did well to hang
on until relieved about midnight.
It was very sloppy work down in the
hollow, after getting accustomed to the
(comparatively) dry sand up on the
ridge.
On the whole it was a job of which the
Battalion may well be proud. Our lads
were not fit after days in the mud, bury-
ing cable and laying tracks, but it was a
case of intense necessity, and they
"stuck it " as they have always done.
They were very tired indeed when
they hopped the bags, but they " gol
there " just the same, and hung on too
Ttiey say Lee. Cpl. Hatt and Observei
Bed were responsible for our fellows
keeping direction, and pulling up at the
right place. It was good work on their
part, considering the featureless nature
or the country after our barrage had
finished with it.
On the way over-a number of FriL
dug-outs and machine gun positions
were diligently searched for skulking
Huns, and any spoil that might be
" dragging. No result, however, for the
Hochs had " buzzed " off and taken all
portable gear with them.
Lieutenant Griffin and Private Bell
were responsible for a batch of prison-
ers, 6 in number, which they secured on
their way back, and marched them
triumphantly to the collecting station.
More power to them.
The greatest regret is expressed in B
Coy. at the loss of Lieut. Frost, who was
generally conceded to be " one of tht
whitest " officers in the battalion. The
affection the boys had for him was sin-
cere, but Fritz claimed him before he
had even half a chance. Just the
fortune of war.
