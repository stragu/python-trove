THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION
V01.2.?N0. 4. Ist December, 1918. Price, Ten Centimes.
Patience.
+
Hostilities have been brought to an
end by the combined strategy of our
generals, and the bravery and dogged
perseverance of our soldiers. Naturally
the prospect of departure for the dear
homeland is first in v our thoughts, and
au impatient Australian love of con-airy
beeoms.B pronounced. But with that same
spirit that held us together when elands
were darkest and victory seemed farthest
away, we should exercise patience. The
British Government and our Common-
wealth have numerous ideas in hand for
demobilisation of Australian soldiers,
and out of these will, no doubt, evolve
something concrete to deal fairly and
equitably with each man as his turn
comes round. In the interim opportunity
will be given to those desiring to im-
prove themselves in almost any trade or
profession, and to a certain degree fit
themselves for their particular niche in
civil life. By a unanimous effort on the
part of all, the nation can, and will,
emerge satisfactorily out of its difficulties,
or in this phase of war, as in battle?
" Union is Strength."
The Triumph.
Across the soiden Flanders plain
The wind is loud with fierce despair,
Tossing' the shattered branches bare,
Hiding from earth the last small gleam
of light.
Thro' the mud and dark ef trackless waste
My faithful engine beats her way ;
.Comrade, when all else fails, by night
or dav,
Mid cold and storm and perils to be faced,
The driving rain beats in my straining
eyes,
Yet loud above the tumult cf the stores
I hear that pitiless slayer without form,
The shrapnel bullet striking as it flies.
Enid M.
At the request of one of our officers above
is inserted as a tribute to the "Triumph"
motor cycle, so much used during the
war.
Weather conditions are remarkably
mild considering [that it is well into the
cold season. Perhaps the Peace Confer-
ence is .warming the atmostphere.


The Sergeants Celebrate.
What a flutter the Sergeants of our
most excellent battalion must have
caused in the hearts of the village mai-
dens one night while at Yaux, when they
donned their glad rags for a real ball
given to the French folk in the locality
to celebrate the signing of the armstice.
Once the great moment (to celebrate ?
not to sign) arrived they simply went
their hardest, did their best, and invited
the Mayor (M. Vast) and other civic
notabilities of the village.
What a sight they presented in the
hut, decorated and seated for the oc-
casion, with " Sammy " the dear boy in
the forefront, and such handsome chaps
as Arthur Bertuch, Dick Richards,
"Cam," "Max," "Tom" Hume, and
"Billy" Wilson. A sprinkling of
officers provided the giot frame to the
picture as it were, for Major Beith,
Major Pascoe, the Adjutant, and several
Company Officers honored by their
presence. It was just great. And such
dancers! Gee! They would have
turned the most ardent Yankee"ragger"
green with rage. They waltzed, schott-
isched, and romped through the Lancers,
etc. till supper, which was in charge of
"Jimmy ' Bruce, "Vvag " Gomel! and
" Jerry" Moore, and comprised hum
sandwiches, biscuits and coffee, No need
to remark on the appetites. The flow-
ing bowl was much in evidence through-
out the evening, and gaiety held sway.
Melody was provided by D Coy s Quar-
tette Party, S.M. Bertuch, Sgt. Harris
and others, while L.-Cpl. Reg. Berndt
tickled the ivories in great style, i lie
following ladies were present: Mines. E.
A. Vast, G. IT. Delafeorte, A. Darrat,
B. Quiret, IT. Smville, A. Lover, 11.
Robillard, A. Quiret, T. Quiret, E. Ray-
mour, A, Defiafis.
A Presentation.

To the Editor,
Sir,? Reading in your issue of 15th
November that Sgt. Ramsdale and his
party were sadly in need of a piano the
undersigned hasten to fill the want.
Kindly present as publicly as possible.
Wishing you and all the diggers a bonza
time in France and Germany, a happy
holiday with their best cobbers in go�d
old England, and a speedy and safe return
to the " Laud of the Wattle.''
From yours truly,
Belcher, Mums, Auntie Li 11 and Cynthia,
35 Market Place, Warminster.
You will be glad to hear on Armistice
day the boys round here behaved (as
always), like gentlemen, and caused no
trouble or disturbance.
[The piano will be presented during
the Christmas festivities.]
Soccer.
The return match against the 24th
Battalion was played at Vaux. The
game was slow at the commencement, and
soon after kicking off a long, low shot
from the boot of Seers scored for the 23rd,
At half time the score was? 23rd. lgl. ;
24th, nil. At the change aver 24th tried
hard to equalise matters, and eventually,
after some hot work in frort of the home
goal, a fast corner shot beat our custodian
Scores evened, the visiting team made a
bold bid for victory, but our defence was
too good, and the game ended in a draw.
S.M, Cameron acted as custodian and
played a beneficial game for his side.
Sgt. Harry Le&i is recovering from an
attack of doable pmtemonia.

Hidden Treasure.
A curious spectacle was witnessed re-
cently when a number of French people
dug up a large safe which had been
buried by the thoughtful.village Mayor,
prior to occupation by the Huns. It
contained the people's securities and
other private valuable papers resting
securely six inches under the surface of
terra firma, alongside what was a Bosche
officer's billet.
Socks.
From shop to shop we c hase for wool
To make your knitted hose,
Then use one color for the leg,
Another for the toes-.
But black or white, or green or red,
Whate'er its color be,
The love we put into our work
Is boundless as the sea.
We chase the wool, yon chase the Huns
And each of us gets there,
Australian grit and knitted -socks
Will stand the.hardest wear.

THE AUSTRALIAN.
The skies that arched his land were blue,
His bush-born winds were warm and
sweet,
And yet from earliest hours lie knew
-1 he tides ot victory and defeat;
From fierce floods thundering at his
b i rtli,
From red droughts ravening while he
played,
He learned to fear no foes on earth
The bravest thing God ever made."
The bugles of the Motherland
Rang ceaselessly across the sea,
To call him and his-lean brown hand
To shape Imperial destiny ;
He went, by youth's grave purpose willed,
The goal unknown, the cost unweighed
The promise of his blood fulfilled? 1
" The bravest thing God ever made!"
We know ?it is our deathless pride !
The splendour of his first fierce blow;
How, reckless, glorious, undenied,
He stormed those steel-lined cliffs we
know !
And none who saw him scale the height
Behind his reeking bayonet-blade
Would rob him of his title right?
" The bravest thing God ever made !"
Bravest, where half a world of men
Are brave beyond all earth's rewards,
So stoutly none shall' charge again
Till the last breaking of the swords;
Wounded or hale, won home from war,
Or yonder by the Lone Pine laid,
Give him his due for evermore
" The bravest thing God ever made !-
W.H.O. in "London Punch."
[Judging by the numerous requests made for publication oft'he above tribute*
it has not been generally read by our fellows, so we accede to the request-
Ed.]
You have weathered the storm of war. Let the home folk know.
