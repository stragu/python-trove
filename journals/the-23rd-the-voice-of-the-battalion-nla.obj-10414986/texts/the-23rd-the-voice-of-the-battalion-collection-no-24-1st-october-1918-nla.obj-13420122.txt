OUT OF EVIL
When we think of the great world
war it is difficult to find anything but
hideous horror, ruin, desolation, death
and that moral suffering that is perhaps
even worse. But against all the devilish
misdeeds which have brought about
these terrors is the sublime spectacle of
human heroism ; of a noble duty carried
out; of selfishness conquered and the
practise of self-sacrifice made the law of
life. Certainly the price paid by
humanity for a glimpse of those devel-
oped qualities is appalling", and yet
the benefits is almost beyond price.
Surely, in the future, it will prove its
worth. Generations to come will truly
benefit by the general bettering of man-
kind, and ours and our children's chil-
dren reap the golden goodness of a har-
vest of bloodiness, thus proving the
truth of the old Biblical quotation
"Out of evil cometh good things."
Lieut.-Col. Brazenor, our C.0., is at
present ill in No, 4 Australian Auxiliary
Hospital, Welwyn, Herts. He sends
regards and hopes to be soon with us.
His heart is with the Battalion.
TO AN AIRMAN.
Swift as an eagle wheeling in its flight,
We saw him mount the sky ?held our
breath
A speck upon the blue he passed from
sight
Into the realms of d^ath.
An English boy with frank and fearless
eyes,
He stood foursquare to all the winds
that blow,
Holding his honor fast, despising ties,
And we who Jovecfiiim know,
That as a lark imprisoned on the sod
Freed from its trammels, sudden up-
wards springs
His radiant soul went circling up to God
With sunshine on its wings.

Australians are not used to the round,
smooth-running wheels of the railway
carriages in Blighty after travelling on
the apparently oval or square wheels of
France. Where's the difference ? Is it
the spring or the Spirit;?

BRIGADE.
Fine weather favored the Brigade
event, and an excellent programme was
carried out. The arrangements for
comfort and convenience were com-
plete in almost every detail, and Lieut.
C. B. Hislop and liis band are to be
complimented on the whole day's pro-
ceedings. The Battalion was represent-
ed by the following: ? Major Beith,
Lieuts. F. Jenkins, M.C., Holland,Foley,,
R.S M. Osbnm, D.C.M., Sergs. C. Wright
and Porter.
Despite the absence of the majority of
our best athletes the Battalion did re-
markably well in almost everything,
Pte. Jack Engel being the mainstay in
the foot events. His determination and
grit are something the unit feels proud
of, and when our sprits were at a low
ebb Jack "came, to light," saving the
situation, with the result that at the end
of the day the Battalion finished 10 points
ahead of the other three, and, for the
third time winners of the Brigade Cup.

In a certain School appeared a sign
which indicated that the apartment was

for some of the boys, who immediately
altered it to read:?Not Servants, but

The previous course at the Australian
Corps School left the 2nd Division witlp

Is it true that " Rammy " was offered

show, which he daintily refused.

A commendable spirit of rivalry is
noticeable among the companies doing
guard, and the turn-outs have
been splendid. Perhaps "B " Coy's last

There is a prize, we believe.

GENERALITIES
"Jack" Phillips is back with us again
with a star that will soon twinkle in the
sphere of football, we hope.
Soldiers, who have sufficient to their
credit can draw up to 175 francs on next
pay day. This is to provide for Xmas
contingencies.
It is a pity the Div. Concert Party
can't keep away from questionable jokes,
especially when some of our nurses are
present. A good show spoilt by sugges-
tiveness.
At Melbourne's welcome to Lieut, Col.
G. H. Knox, which was an enthusiastic
one, there were present Chaplain-Col,
Macrae-Stewart. Major M. Smith, Major
Baird, Lieut, Mclndoe, and many others
of the old boys of the 23rd Battalion,
The Colonel was very pronounced in his
denunciation of the public house loun-
gers and race course habitues who stayed
at home and watched their comrades
fight for them. " The man who had not
done his job, should be ostracised," he
said-
At the Div. sports meeting three offi-
cers that were once our own, Capts. T.
Miller, E, T. Bazeley, M.C., and Lieut.
C. B. Ilislop were prominent. We were
directly represented on the committee
by Lieuts. P. J. Foley andSerg. Porter.
The President and Committee of 6th
A.I. Brigade Sports have asked me to
tender to you their thanks for your gen-
erous assistance in connection with the
above sports. The success of the day was
due in no small degree to your efforts.
On behalf of the Committee, yours faith-
fully, C. B. Hislop, Lieut., Hon Secretary
6th A.I. Brigade Sports. Brigade's
recognition of our work in printing their
programmes.
TO THE BOYS.
The following few lines from our very
own Miss Dorothy "Bmnton, whose affec-
tion for the hoys is only equalled by their
love for her, will no doubt be appreciated
as all such messages are : >?

Dear Brother Aussies,
Ever so many thanks for jour dear old
letter and paper. The latter I have read
through and through.
I want to tell you how much I appreci-
ated your letter to me ?your loyalty is too
wonderful for words. Eever a night goes
by at the theatre, but there is a Coo-ee oi*
a cheery cry trom somewhere in the house.
You are all just great and I love you hoys
more than anything in the world. This
may sound a very sweeping statement, hut
it's true.
My love to the boys of the 23rd Battn.,
Ever Sincerely,

Lance Corp. Fitzpatrick writes to say
he is progressing slowly towards re-
covery. It will be a couple of months
before he is able to take his position oil
a homeward bound transport. He is,
however, a sure thing for Aussie,

DIVISION
A blue sky, and bright sunshine tem-
pered by a lovely cool breeze favored
Division on their day out. The pro-
gramme was a large one, and eaeh
Brigade had some "hot stuff," either in
horseflesh or man-power, representing
them, so that speculation was rife and
the tote and commission agents were well
supported. There was a canteen (cer-
tainly much too small for the occasion),
and the Y.M.C.A- provided the familiar
cocoa and biscuits. Perhaps the most
important event of the day was the Band
Contest, an innovation in military sports,
and 12 bands faced the adjudicators
for the quick step. In this the Sixth
brigade scored a decisive victory, for the
24th Battalion band finished first, with
the 21st a good second. Nobody was
surprised and the general expression was
that "the best band won." Our own
musical combination evidently fell far
short in proficiency, for its position was
only eighth on the list. We all felt a
little disappointed, but perhaps defeat
will act as an incentive to greater things
next time. General Birdwood showed
by his presence that we are still first in
his thoughts, and during the day he could
be seen in conversation with many of the
"old brigade." It was a big event, and
everybody enjoyed the outing.
Following are the events in which we
scored :
Wrestling on Horseback?6th Brigade
Team, 1.
Relay Race.?6th Brigade Team, 1.
Lagnicourt Stakes [lOO yds.] ?Lieut.
Painter, 3.
Peronne Hop, Step and Jump.?Pte.
Appleyard, 3.
Sack Race. ?Driver McMenanin, 3.
Total points scored by the Brigade, 15.
POINTS ALLOTTED
The allotment of points in the Brigade
Sports was as follows :
23rd Battalion 31 points
21st ? 19 ?
22nd ? - 17 ?
24th ? - 10 ?
T.M.B. - 1 ?
BAND CONTEST.
f ?-
Competition amongst the bands of the
"Diamond" Division roused much en-
thusiasm, and the interest displayed by
all ranks indicates that Orphans will
surely play a prominent part in the future
life of the Australian when the world is
again free of war's tentacles.
Included in the conditions of the eon-
test were superiority in drill, marching;
cleanliness of uniform and equipment, etc.,
which entailed much cheerful activity and
anticipation on the part of the various
battalions for the right and honor of say-
ing " Ours is the best."
Following were the points gained in the
main items :

TO AMIENS CATHEDRAL.
Ameins Cathedral! You will remain
for Australian soldiers one of the war's
most potent memories. Long after hard-
ships and dangers are forgotten' in the
return to normal comfort your soothing
beauty during many months of tragedy
will remain fresh and sweet. It is
strange how your loveliness meets the
eye at every turn near the front line.
You stand with your town in a hollow
at your feet. Beside you the close-
surrounding houses dwarf your giant
greatness. But ascend to the hills that
stretch far on every side and your
grandeur rises high above the huddled
homes.
Supreme in your unique adaptation to
the sky and country against which you
are set, to many weary eyes you have
been a beckoning picture of repose. It
is this completeness that gives, in a
large measure, the fascination that w r o
feel. If at any time or from any angle
you feel harsh or unkind we should
associate you with some of the terrible
moments of our lives. And we might
come to hate you. But so admirably do
you fit your natural surroundings that
we are moved to dream our highest
ideals before such perfect dignity.
We have seen you under all conditions
of sun and rain. In the early morning
you rise in tenderness from a sea of
downy mist. No monument of stone,
but soft in all the charm of feminine
outline. The risen sun has changed
you to a rock of strength, whose granite
base is edged with foam where the sun's
rays catch your flying buttresses. In
the summer evening you have been a
jewel of deepest blue in a setting of gold
mingling with the poppies' brilliant red.
Sometimes the clouds have sent their
shadows chasing in sheer delight across
your face, while tho sun, shooting thro'
them, has brigtliened it with purest light.
And there have been the varying moods
of war. Tired from the line you have
wooed us to rest. In desperate thoughts
of further hardships you have spoken
with unfaltering beauty of the transitory
nature of our troubles. In moments of
ease you have won us to serenity by the
sheer charm of your unforgetable outline.
We have been in many sectors, in many
parts of Northern France, but nowhere
has such nobility urged us bo our best.
Amiens owes much to the Australian
soldier, who has saved you from the
desecrating hand of the enemy. But
we owe more to the men who in the early
days built such a symbol of eternal
beauty. Your creators were faced with
the same troubles that burden our minds
to-day. They knew strife? 1 in peace and
war. And they have shown if suffering
has to be endured it can be conquered by
beauty. Your town is deserted, a city
of silence and death. But you, in your
loveliness, tell us that in the heart of
suffering lies beauty. The beauty that
is truth. And here you have been before
our eyes these many months, whence all
who run may read.?L.G.S.
