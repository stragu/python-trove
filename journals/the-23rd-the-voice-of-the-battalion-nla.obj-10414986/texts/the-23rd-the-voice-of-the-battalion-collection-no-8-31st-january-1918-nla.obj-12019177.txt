THE VOICE OF THE BATTION
JANUARY 31, 1918. Price, Twopence.
THE WEEKLY WHIRLIGIG.
o grave things from gay, we pursue
our war way, and please don't imagine
we're slacking, for tho' think night and
day, we perforee have to say that news
for this issue is lacking.
The fashion to-<iay is " Paris leave
gay," for officers and other old rankings,
and believe us 'tis true some tales are
Quite " blue" of their' sight-seeing and
other wild prankings.
The wily Germ-hun, with intriguing
glib tongue, continues the Russian to
harrass. The Cossack from Don seems
prone to fight on, and otherwise Trotsky
embarrass. With fire they are playing,
it goes without saying, that ere autumn
breaks on the sinners, we'll finish the
war with quite the top score?" Right,
Truth and Justice " the winner.
Lord Rhonda will test with patriot's
zest a scheme to ration the nation. If
it succeeds and fills the food needs it
surely will meet approbation.
While things are all muddle we con-
tinue to puddle in and out of the line
doing duty, with full hope in store in a
few years or more we'll return to home, ,
love and beauty.
THE SILENT TOAST.
, "To those that were, and are not!"
Through the days,
The weary months, the years, our
thoughts went back
To those we knew beneath the Southern
Cross;
On Afric's burningsands; Gallipolf;
The shell-torn, blood-stained battlefields
of France.
The Deathless Army claimed them;
and each man
The summons heard, a smile upon his
lips :
Looked in the eyes of Death,, and
laughed ; and, so,
To those who knew and loved them
best,?Farewell!
" To those that were, and are not!"
So we drank
The silent toast to men that played the
game
With Death,?'and lost; Yet, in the
losing, gained
A wider life, an immortality.
?H.G.H.
Since the scheme of rationing Eng-
land in a systematic manner introduced
by Lord Rhonda is to become a fact the
country will M'rdly be known now as the
food hog's " Rhonda-Vous."


WHERE WE ARE.
[lt is mended in this series to endeavor
to Record conditions and surroundings
as movement occurs from place to
place, which will probably be looked
back upon with interest when the
Empire has again settled to a normal
state. For the present dates and
names are omitted lor obvious reasons.]
I.
" Somewhere in France," Digger, but
it is a long trail from, the hills and shady
gum trees of Gippsland, the fertile plains
of the Western District, or the sun-baked
wastes of the Mallee, to the torn and
bloody battlefields of France and Bel-
gium, where shell-shattered ridge and
wood are the surroundings. Leafless
trees stand gaunt and cheerless! amidst
railed farm-houses, and shell-tossed dug-
outs are strewn around.
The particular occasion under review
is a Sunday morning, and it is winter,
with grey sky overhead. A calm at-
mostphere prevails, which occasionally
vibrates as a guttural "plonk-plonk" of
an enemy messenger crashes on its
deadly errand?perhaps. Mud and water,
scattered farm implements, fallen trees
and stumps intermingle in confusion on
the ground. Shell holes of varying
dimensions line the roadside, filled to
the brinu the result of a very recent
deluge and;the melting of. the snow.and
ice, which had held sway previously.
A famous hill looks formidable and grim
in the greyness of the morning, and
shells speeding overhead from our own
batteries cleave their way with a long-
drawn sigh.
Human ants have honeycombed into
the heart of the hill, and underground
galleries are made suitable for human
occupation, and a shelter from the
spreading shrapnel or venomous shell.
On the surface khaki-clad ants pursue
multifarious duties, at times uninterfered
with, and at other times spontaneous
rushes are made for the "cell" entrances.
*Tot by any stretch of imagination could
the trenches or circumstances be called
comiortable or home-like, but cheerful
faces and jovial greeting reign over all
personal discomfort of comrades hailing
from a distant land, and standing
staunchly and bravely shoulder to
shoulder in a common cause. Few are
on the slushy road, leading in one dir-
ection to cosy hamlets and villages,
and in the other to rain-drenched,
broken trenches. The hill frowns on a
dense wood below. The thickly grown
saplings and trees are splintered, shat-
tered and uprooted on the perforated
ground.
Close by the entrance to the subter-
ranean " home," at the foot of the hill,
nestles a small cemetery where heroes
of past conflicts lie at rest beneath the
mounds, far from their native soil, and
at no great distance stand ragged walls
of brick and mortar, pierced,, unstable
and crumbling, silent and grim, as wit-
ness of a fiendish foe's spitefulness.
Sandwiched between the scarred earth
and the murky clouds guardians of the
air flutter hither and thither in graceful
evolution, seeking an advantage, direct-
ing the aim of the artillery, or turning
snemy air machines back to their own
lines.
Away in the east a gleam of gold
steals through an opening in the grey-
ness, as a winter's sun endeavors to
peep over the scene of desolation.
So much for the dismal record of the
first of this series, but others to follow
will show that there are occasions when
even a soldier's life is flooded with sun-
shine, which will duly be recorded as
time goes on.

AROUND THE BRAZIER.
-
It was a cold night and the snow fell
in great flakes outside. A party of the
lads had been out the previous night on
a raid?ta r coal raid?So all was comfy
within the dug-out with the heated coal
lowing cheerfully in the brazier, casting
a delightful warmth all around.
' The .boys sat round in cosy languor
discussing events generally of a soldier's
life. Bill, who had a big "A " over his
colors, told hair-raising tales of Gallipoli,
but Egpy t would do him after experiences
in France for nearly two years.
Young Joe, who had recently arrived
with a batch of reinforcements, told of
the diminutive lieutenant who led his
company on foot on a ten-mile march
one fine day. The lads, to make things
easier, humorously carolled " And a little
child shall lead them " quite often. The
company eventually reachtd their quar-
ters very tired and weary, but before
being dismissed they were addressed by
their midget leader thus " Men, your
marching was splendid, your discipline
excellent. To-morrow we will try a
fifteen-mile march, and " A little child
shall lead you "?on horseback.
Bright Pick, the Q.M., took up the
cudgels of reminieences, and related the
instance, while in charge of a guard,
of a soldier laboring under the unfor-
tunate handicap of an impediment in
his speech. Dick knew nothing of this,
and in detailing the soldier for night
duty, met with excited ejaculations and
the reply, " Y-y-you c-can't put m-m-me
on night d-d-d-duty, 'cause I w-would
have to s-s-s-shoot a man b-b-before I
could s-s-say " H-h-h-h-halt."
The next story was of our Comman-
der-in-Chief, who was visiting the line
quite recently, and met one of our own
sergeants indulging in the pleasant, but 1
not quite lawful sport, of shooting hares.
Good day, Sergeant," remarked the
General, "having a little shooting?"
"Yes, Sir," replied the Sergeant. "Is
the sport good?" "Not bad, Sir.".
''How are you keeping, Sergeant?"
"Good, Sir." "Very good, Sergeant.
Carry on." And the lads round the
fire wondered what would happened had
it been a " Tommy " officer.
Another story was told �f a popular
Sergeant, possessed of more than ordin-
ary strength, who was being imposed
upon, by the wily taxi driver, while in
" Lunnon." The fare was exhorbitant
and the N.C.O. gaily announced: " I am
the strongest man in Australia, and will
push your b?? taxi over." It did'nt
take long to convince the automobile
Jehu that he meant it. Peace was soon
declared.
As the rum issue was about due,
one of the bandsman was mentioned
as having a habit of stumbling badly
with the French names as applied to
camps. He had got a little out of his
course on a recent night, and on meeting
an officer, enquired thus Excuse me,
Sir, can you tell me where I am?"
Officer: "I might, if you can tell me
whereabouts your camp is." Private :
" Well, Sir, I think we're near a place
called ' New Valise !' "
After a good tot of rum had been dis-
posed of, quiet ? 1 volunteered to sing
a parody on "Sweet Adeline," which
went something like this :
Oh, margarine, where have you been ?
For many days we have not seen
You at our mess, so you can guess
How we miss you when no issue,
Margarine,
That settled the harmony of an other-
wise quiet evening. Snow slid down the
roof, the fire went out, Fritz dropped
Bombs, and all crept stealthily to their
blankets and spfingless boards.

OFFICERS' MESS.
Naturally enough we are looking for-
ward +o the reformation of our mess,
comforts and social re-unions, occasional
bridge nights, and the like.
It will no doubt delight ail ranks to
read that Lieut.-Col. G. Knox has been
invested by the King with the Distin-
guished Order, Commander of St. Michael
and St. George (C.M.G.), as well as the
D.S.O. The heartiest congratulations of
all in the Battalion are extended to him.
Lieut.-Col. B. Duggan, who for a short
while was in command of the 23rd Batt.,
has been invested with the D.S.O.
Lieut. Fethers has gone to Brigade as
Intelligence Officer. We omitted to
record this fact in our last, and he is
well worth mentioning too.
Returning officers are unanimous in
stating that weather conditions similar
to last winter prevail, and that there is
at present three- or four feet of snow on
the ground. For the change of locality
this year let us "be thankit."
Is it a fact that a very popular lieuten-
ant has developed a love for coffee, even
if it is served in uninteresting surround-
ings? Coffee and bridge between shells
must be a fascinating pastime.
The following officers are attending
Schools: Lieuts. A. H. Yogler, G. W.
Griffin, W. A. E. Bragg, H. C. Holland,
T.-S. Milligan.
In view of the fast- thai one of our
officers, in the person of Lieut. Harris,
has taken up a position on the Corps
paper, we look forward with .pleasurable
anticipation to its iiiitijil issue.
A current story is that of a number of
our officers visiting the trout line, under
the guidance of the A.A. A treacherous
set of duckboards were safely negotiated
by all but our hefty second-in-command,
who fell rather heavily. His remark on
recovering equilibrium was : " Is this a
sample of the Adjutant's humor? "
SIXTH A.I. BBE. COMFORTS FUND.
T
A few words of appreciation are due
through the medium of our Battalion
newspaper to our Sixth Brigade Com-
forts Fund organisation, which is still
working hard as ever in providing com-
forts for the men of this Brigade.
The most practical manner for the
man in the trenches to receive the great-
est benefit from their efforts has been
solved by this splendid organisation
paying into regimental account their
accumulated funds from donations and
profits from their sale of goods. In
addition, parcels of sox are periodically
received by the Padre for distribution,
and the boys are eloquent in their thanks
at receiving these in preference to issue
stock. About two weeks prior to Xmas
the sum of �5O was cabled to us, and
this sum was the foundation of our
famous Xmas dinners, a Company event
which will be spoken of for many a long
day, and voted by the lads as the best
and most enjoyable time they have had
in the Battalion.
The splendid women of this organisa-
tion are by no means war-weary, after
close on three years hard work and self-
sacrifice, and it is to-Mrs Fethers (Presi-
dent) and her band of willing workers
that all ranks send their grateful
appreciation.? W.B.
BALLARAT BRANCH.
The C.O. has received word from Mrs
Brazenor that a Branch of the above
organisation has been successfully start-
ed. Rooms have been secured at the
delicensed Club Hotel, Lydiard-street,
and a live branch of the institution is
assured.
We regret to have to record the fact
that Lieut. W. M. Simpson has been
wounded for the second time.
Sgt. Jack Phillips has gone to the
O.T.C. Everybody feels glad.

AMONGST THE ROYS.

The first issue of the Battalion paper
has reached its intended destination,
Australia.
* * *
Tres bein weather, lads.
* * *
Nevertheless mud pretty rotten, eh?
* * #
Does Fritz think he's going to a hop-
over ? If lie does, let him " 'op."
?* * �
Trenches not too good. Cheerio.
The Hun knows we have put him a worse
predicament.
* * *
H.Q. lost their rum jar the other night.
There seemed to be a lot of garrulity in
a certain quarter after lights out.
* * #
Old Tom is no ap-prentice as regards
our own drains, but does not " compre "
French excavations for the same pur-
pose, as his experience shows in a
recent deluge. He got a new pair of
pants out of it, anyhow.
* * *
Sgt. Stewart has gone to school. We
hope the Sergeant with the little stick
will not play truant..
* * *
Cpl. McPhee's " guests " have no cause
to complain.. They do well under his
protecting wiing.
* * *
That wretch, Fritz, was throwing
stones (otherwise " duds ") at the detail
camp, without result, on Friday last.
* � *
There seems to be a lot of disquietude
among the followers of Allah. The up-
setting of Turkey seems to be imminent.
* * �
Some of the cooks have gone to a
school to learn some more cooking
wrinkles. Tres bein for the troops ?
* * *
Perhaps we will soon be able to con-
gratulate a certain N.C.O. on a well-
earned promotion.
* * *
S.M. Kilgour has gone to Ist Anzac
Corps School as instructor.
�? � �
" Gouge " should have been in hospital
last week but for the fact that the mule
missed the target. The kick was well
meant.
* * *
We are not too cold, but we are cer-
tainly not coaled.
* * *
S.M. Bertuch has blown back amongst
us from a peregrination, looking like
something just fallen off a wedding
cake.
* * *
By the time the issue is out we ex-
pect to be " on our way to Mahdalay."
or somewhere, to put on a bit more
condition.
* * *
The Brigade Concert Party showed to
the 22nd Battalion last week. The
weight of the show is practically borne
by one or two artists. Perhaps it is too
early to criticise, as they have hardly
yet got out of their swaddling clothes.
We are much interested in the enter-
tainers, and when the raggedness is
worn off, will be quite candid critics.

A village cafe adjacent bears the sign-
board, "Hop Baths." It ought to be a

IN.-AND OUT.
%
English proverb brought up to date.?
" Eat,-drink; and be merry, for to-morrow
we ration."
This paper has been produced in some
extraordinary places. In one instance
" the cottage was a cowshed."
An English paper says during a recent
visit to the Western front Plindenburg
was nearly knocked down by a train.
What punishment the train received w�
have not heard. Perhaps it was sent up
the line.
Gossip says purple eyeleashes are the
latest craze in Blighty. Purple noses
.are quite the winter fashion among sol-
diers in France.
" Summer time will be enforced again
this year." What if .it refuses to obey
the law ?
Mr. Lloyd George was 55 years of
last week. It's a wonder he isn't 96.
A difference. ?The oldest newspaper in
France will cease publication until the
Hun is driven out. The first born trench
paper will Not cease publication until he
is driven out.
The channels and waterways around
look like great bowls of mint sauce. No
resemblance in the smell tho.'
Linoleum and paint manufacturers in
England are greatly incensed because
they " can't get the oil." It's needed for
foodstuffs.
Some of the noble food profiteers in
England have got 50,000 rabbits held up.
Wonderful. What a boon these men
would be to Australian squatters.
HOSPITAL NOTES.
Capt. Noall has had the misfortune to
meet with an accident, while convales-
cing, which will retard his recovery.
Lieut. Roth Gordon, who is now con-
valescent, sends best wishes to the Bat-
talion, and hopes to be with it at an early
date.
Sergt. B. E. Symthe B Coy., is by now
on his way to the place where schnapper
turn the scale at over lOOlbs.
Lc.cp. J. R. Hudson of the same com-
pany, hopes to soon shake hands with
" Lofty " on the same golden shore.
Pte. Davies, who lost a leg, is doing
well, and should soon bask in a southern
sun.
Lc.cp. Wallace is convalescent at Hurd-
cotte. His progress has been tres bien.
Sgt. Robertson, M.G., is swiftly recov-
ering from an illness which necessitated
a trip to Blighty.
Pte. R. Comb, evacuated sick to 14th
Stationary Hospital, is mending rapidly.
Pte. H. Nihil], who is at the 3rd Can-
adian Hospital, is also making good.
Pte. Geo. Willis, of the Transport has
been evacuated with the "spots." Hope
he doesn't turn into a leopard.
Pte. Les. Lenowry has reached that
haven of rest- 1 " Aussy," minus one pedal
appendage.
Pte. J. Flannery, who had the misfor-
tune to lose both feet, writes in cheerful
vein that he will probably soon join the
Flying Corps, where they need wings
most.
Pte. T. R. Bremner should now be
ploughing the Indian Ocean, according
to a letter to hand dated Dec. 26th '1
The mild weather of late has been a
great factor in alleviating sickness
amongst us.

A NEW YEAR'S EVE EPISODE.
[Contributed.]
So you want a story do you,
A.bout the beastly Hun ?
Well, if you'll listen quietly
I'll try and tell you one.
The scene was near a farmhouse,
Away down by Aimentieres
In a quiet forsaken spot sir,
Where you soon forget your fears.
"A" Coy's fourth platoon, sir,
Were billeted around there;
They lived in a dingy cellar
Breathing damp and smoky air.
Well, things were going smoothly
And New Year's Eve came round
W hen a Furphy wafted 'mid the lads
That a sniper's lair they'd found.
The rum had just been issued
Which some had gulped down whole,
When some bx-ave heart suggested
That we send out a patrol.
Well, off the patrol started
But they hadn't got very far
When " ping " a bullet whistled
And they all dropped with a jar.
Franky dived into,a shell-hole,
Which he said was not too nice ;
You see it was his first acquaintance
, With the awful snow and ice.
T*hen he heard friend Matt whisper
Follow me Frank and take care,
But then Pal Bert loudly shouted
" Stand still ?there goes a flare.
Well, after that the small patrol
Decided to retire
For Smithy said they should go back
And discuss it round the fire.
They eventually straggled homeward
O'er snow and shell-holes great
And so that patrol ended
As they staggered through the gate,
A meeting in the cookhouse
Billy once more hurriedly called ;
A second patrol should go out
The sniper must be stalled.
The same old crowd all volunteered
To forever root him out;
And then they added to their number
Bory Moore the " dinkum " scout.
As they again approached the trenches
The Hun sent up a flare
And once more Frankie cuddled up
In a hole just like a bear.
" Prepare to hurl a bomb," said Bert,
And Franky pulled out the pin
Then handing it to Tich, he said,
" I'll do the beggar in."
Three bullets left the sniper's gun,
And one went through Frank's coat,
Captain Bert got very wild
And roared " Get down you goat."
And then from out of the darkness
They heard a Foreign voice ;
It might have been Bill Holmes,
But the brave lads had no choiee.
Said one, " We'll use the bayonet,
A bomb makes so much noise,
We'll try and take him home alive,
And so surprise the boys."
Just then the shooting ceased, sir,
And as the lads felt damp,
They decided to give up the chase
And return once more to camp.
So back they came to the cookhouse,
But believe me as I live
'Twas the first time that the 23rd
Had failed in their objective.
And now the story is ended,
I hope you've enjoyed my tale
Of how we spent last New Year's Eve,
- You'll admit 'twas not too stale.
And when you get back to Australia,
Should you wander South Melb. way
Just tell them Franky's going strong,
And should be famous-some day.

REDEEMED.
S? was the worst soldier in the
line, almost as bad as it was possible to
lie. That was the opinion held by all
but the few who were sufficiently of the
same kidney to be his few remaining
friends.
From the C.O. down he was known as
" the rotter," and in vain did the officers
tiy to find a redeeming trait in his char-
acter. Chance after chance he was
given when up before 0.R., but no, he
remaine4 incorrigible.
In Egypt, on the Peninsula, in England,
France, same to S? ??. The grea-
ter part of hi� military career was spent
in confinement?in clinque for every
sin in the military calendar except that
unforgivable one ?" Desertion and cow-
ardice in the face of the Enemy,'* the only
reason wiiy the walls of a military
prison were his Sanctuary?for he al-
ways missed the line.
A schemer, malingerer, an apparent
coward, this soldier pariah was shunned
by nearly all.
For once the fa+es intervened, and an-
other charge, the twentieth, stood to the
discredit of S?? ?. The Battalion was
well under strength, with a big " stunt "
iii view.
The authorities in their wisdom, de-
cided to send forward those held in deten-
tion, an opportunity to wipe out mis-
deeds by good work, and regain the good
opinion of those above them.
'Twas the eve of what promised to bo
one of the greatest offensives yet under-
taken by our armies. Conversation on
all sides centred around our chances of a
successful encounter.
? ? ?
The Battalion was taking up its posi-
tion, from which the great attack was to
be made, and last to move in were the
prisoners, each escorted by two shining
bayonets. Last in the line marched
S?? ?, sullen as storm cloud, but with
face that betokened a set resolve. Some
grim determination possessed him that
only increased as the evening barrage
of our enemy become more and more
violent.
? ? ?
Zero hour arrives, and the moment
when best and worst in man meet in
conflict. The word " Charge " flashed
along the line. First to leave the trench
was S? ? ?. On, 011 he goes, teeth
clenched, fighting as man seldom fought
before, heedless of the earthly hell blaz-
ing round him until ?a blinding flash 1
and he lay stilll?a soldier-*Redeemed.
