THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION I
No, 4. NOVEMBER 30, 1917. Price, Twopence.
THE WEEKLY WHIRLIGIG.
On going to press, we have to confess,
last week was a bit of a stunner! what
with Russia upturned, and the Dago
turned up, both have got rather a
" Wunner." But to balance the bill, the
Turk's got a pill, and one that is awk-
ward to swallow, for his forces they scat-
ter, in Jerusalem?no matter?the old cry
of "Allah!'' he'll "holler." Old Can-
Ada's best, Passchendale to possess, with
Tommy fought up to tradition, for tho'
odds they were rough, the " blood and
'iron bluff,'-couldn't save this valued pos-
ition, and if rumor speaks right, the re-
sult of this fight.?" Some thousands of
Hochs posted missin.'"
Our General, 'tis true, has been here
to review, and fix ribbons to brave-
hearted breasts of those who have proved
the true metal, and who'll do so again
tho' hard be the strain, when Teutonic
1.0.U.'s we will settle. Out home well, we
hear, conscription is near, or rathpr the
papers do tell us, and if it goes thro', as
'it's near sure to do, reinforcements will
soon come to swell us. Then 5000 Anzacs,
three years on the track, the broad roll-
ing ocean might follow to the land of some
sun, away from Fritz Hun, on a 6 months
'permission' "jollo." We in our turn, for
'home sights will yearn, but with no out-
W&fd sign of our sorrow, for while out for
a rest?4 weeks of'the best-we' ll get fit
for a future mud-wallow.
VERSE?AND WORSE.
VISIONS.
Gently fade the stars away,
Gently breaks the dawn of day,
Crimson rays and shafts of gold
Peep o'er the wooded ranges ;
Creeps the silvery light on high
In radiance to the purple sky,
Its darkened hues exchanges.
Song birds, early on the wing,
Sweetly to the new morn sing, -
Fluttering o'er tree and shrub
In gay and merry prances ;
Wild-flowers shyly peeping thro'
Crystal globes of dazzling dew,
The early morn entrances.
Children's voice and merry prattle
Rise amidst the sound of battle
To he who lies in trench of slime,
With leaden sky o'erhead ;
Shot and shell speed on their mission
Unheard through the glorious vision,
By angels fair outspread.
Music, soft, steals to the ear,
Church bells chiming sweet and clear
Peace and love they seem to peal
In sleeping soldier's dream.
* * *
A- flash!. a crash ! the dream is o'er,
Reality is the cannons' roar,
And vanishes what may have been.
?" Dad."


WHAT IS IT?
It is intended that this Magazine shall
assist in the maintenance of that spirit
of union in the battalion, known by the
French word--" esprit-de-corps."
Why we have no word in our language
for such a necessary virtue is an inter-
esting point. But there it is?we have
to. borrow from an Ally.
Just what it is. may not be very-easy
to define. A dictionary will probably
prove of little value in the matter. You
will almost certainly be referred to
another word-or string of them-equally
vague in meaning.
And so we may seek a definition of
our own. Let us call it the battalion
definition. But just let us consider what
it is not. It-is not self-esteem. That
pride in your unit, which makes you say
-no other battalion can compare with it
in valor and discipline. It may be true
-no doubt it is-but leave the saying to
some more unbiassed judgment than
yours. It is so notoriously hard to see
one's own faults. It is not pride already
assured of its own perfection ; a pride
sure from the jump that everything is
all right. That there is no need for
further effort. It is not a virtue that
can be left safely to the attention of the
other fellow in the battalion, but does
not touch "me." It is an elusive sort
of thing, this "esprit-de-corps." Very
easily lost if not carefully watched. Like
a will-o'-the-wisp it is seen suddenly at
times, only to vanish as quickly, and yet
it is very insistent in its endeavour to
join your battalion. We may call it a
striving For what? Obviously an
ideal; and what sort of an ideal ? A.
military one compounded of many vir-
tues, none very easy to obtain in perfec-
tion,. Like all military ideals ft is
achieved only in details. By careful at-
tention to the most subordinate matters.
It is to be found as readily in the daily
cleaning of boots as in the heroism of
the battlefield. It can be seen on the
punctual parade and in the avoidance ol
orderly room ; in the virile performance
of drill and in the pleasure of organised
games ; in the hours when you are in the
battalion as well as the times you are
away from it. In every moment of your
days as a member of the 23rd battalioh
this ideal of esprit de corps clamors for
admission into your life, and only when
it has been admitted into every detail of
battalion life can the search be said to
be ended.
That is why it is not self-esteem nor
false pride. They are found before you
begin.
But this ideal of affectionate pride in
the unit to which you belong is attained
only after striving. A constant effort
undertaken by every member of the
battalion.?L.G.S.
AN APPRECIATION.
The following few lines of appreciation
have been received by Lieut.-Col. Braz-
enor from Brigadier-General Paton, 6th
Infantry Brigade:--
" Many thanks for the third copy of
your battalion newspaper. It makes
interesting reading, and its publication
under the circumstances and surround-
ing conditions shows enterprise, and a
credit to all concerned."

GENERALITIES
The London correspondent of the
" Argus," speaking of one of the Somme
battles, says " The 6th Brigade made a
magnificent fight?a marvellous bit of
hanging on. They have good reason to
be proud of themselves for the work they
did that day."
One of our officers caused considerable
comment amongst the Tommies the other
day by wearing bachelors' buttons on
his epaulettes as stars. Why not? He's
a bachelor.
A friend of Capt. Beith's, who is in
the printing business, in a large way in
Ireland, is an admirer of our paper?and
a subscriber also. He says he wishes to
keep in touch with the trade, even when
conducted in the firing line.
Capt. Rossiter sends kind regards to
all the boys of the 23rd. He expects to
be back amongst them soon.
Capt. Hinchliffe's " bouncing baby
boy," mentioned last issue, by the way,
has almost become a young man, for the
Captain informs us he is 15 months' old.
The news was a little belated.

OFFICERS' MESS.
OFFICERS' MESS.
?4
And our Officers' Mess is again an ac-
complished fact. And a link in the gold
cliaih of battalion unity.
The hon. secretary is Lieut. Bastow,
whose fatherly interest bids fair to make
our stomachs heavy and pockets light.
We are told he keenly enjoys the job.
We.,would think so, judging by the ex-
tent of his growling. On a wet and
muddy afternoon he was seen leaving
...... with a heavy packet of fish under
his arm. After a walk of four kilos,
surely a few words were justifiable. But,
to be serious, all officers are united in
appreciation of his work.
At the formal meal a new president
sits daily, so that all junior officers shall
have the opportunity of learning wisdom
from the senior table. It is said some
junior subalterns think this impossible.
Major Trew sends his love to the bat-
talion. He is on light duty just now,
acting as C.O. Officers' School, in the
Overseas' Training Brigade, England.
His desire is that he may return to the
battalion immediately required. A tele-
gram had better be despatched forthwith.
The following extract from the " Bul-
letin " will interest those who know Lt.
Hain. It refers to a book on Aus-
tralian war stories recently published.
"The writer is Gladys Taylor, M.A.,
L.L.B. (Mrs R. E. Hain) who was for
some years a practising solicitor in Mel-
bourne. Hej: husband is a Melbourne
barri-st-ef, an officer of the Citizen Forces,
who volunteered as soon as the war
broke out. He went to the Front with
the 23rd Battalion in May, 1915. He
has served on all the fronts, and is now
on the Headquarters Court Martial at
Tidworth, more or less knocked about."
An officer of the battalion was seen
one evening outside our camp gate. He
was overheard asking the sentry " where
is the 23rd Battalion camp?" And. it
was just after closing hours !
Another officer was heard to exclaim,
as he looked at the news from Italy, " I
won't touch another drink until the war
is over." We believe it was after a night
of several, and uttered beneath his
breath. Such a vow y you know, is not
altogether binding.
The Padre has been on leave in Paris.
We are told the Parisian girls, like.
Padres even more than the combatant
Australian officers. They find them so
" nouveau."
Lieuts. Roxburgh and Jenkins?we
congratulate the latter on his second
star?were also on Paris leave. Just be-
fore departure one of them was heard to
exclaim excitedly, "Oh ! it makes me
feel so restless." They have been much
quieter since their return.
We regret that Lieut. Cuthbertson has
been invalided to England. He is at the
3rd London General Hospital suffering
frSin a throat trouble.
Lieut. McSwi ley, who lost his leg
after being wounded at Bullecourt,
writes cheerfully from a home in Ireland.
His leg is sufficiently healed for a new
one to be fitted shortly. He writes :" It
is a being on crutches, but when I
get my new leg I hope to face life as
cheerfully as ever." That is very char-
acteristic of Mac.'s happy view of things.
Capt. Moss has " une petite marraine "
in .somewhere in France. The Ad-
jutant informs us that Capt.
has applied for Paris leave, with an
extension to . As one privileged
to scan the letters to " mon chere Dick,''
we can assure him it is time wasted.
Lieut. Holland is now on the active
service list.
Lieut. Maddrell is likely to be with us
before Xmas.


FOOTBALL JOTTINGS.
A representative battalion team ap-
pears on the horizon, and everybody,
from the Colonel down, is looking for-
ward to the inter-battalion matches,
especially one battle. Wo have the
makings of a very fine team; with
coaching and training the flag should be
kept flying.

strongest combination, played A and B

THE ATTACK AT DAWN.
Exhausted, grimy, blood bespattered,
he threw himself wearily on the blood-
drenched ground. He could go no lon-
ger. His outraged muscles refused to
further respond to his weakened will.
About him lay many mutilated bodies,
clamily oozing blood. It was a sanguin-
ary scene. His clothes were mud be-
spattered and blood-clogged. Congealed
blood covered his hands and lined his
finger nails. He contemplated his blood-
drenched surroundings without emotion.
A great weariness saturated his soul
and deadened his senses.
This was the first time he had rested
since just bef jre dawn, when he had been
rudely awakened and told to go to his
post. He had done so quickly and with-
out hesitation. He was determined to
do his duty to himself and to his
comrades.
After the start was made he had gone
on and on?never flinching, never hesit-
ating, never complaining at his bloody
task. He had striven manfully and con-
scientiously. His face was hard and set,
as of a man doing an unpleasant duty
nobly.
He had spent a hard and strenuous
couple of hours. The work required all
his energy, ail his determination, all his
strength. Vigorously, continuously, he
had kept on~viciously thrusting forward
and to left and to right, his keen blade
rending flesh and muscle and sinew and
bone. The sweat stood out on his brow.
His frame trembled from the vigor and
speed with which he worked.
And now, at last, he had been forced to
take a short respite. Sitting there amid
the fresh blood and lifeless flesh, his
mind went back to the past. Away
across ten thousand miles of seas his
thoughts flew to the pretty, dark-eyed,
sun-kissed laughter-loving Australian
girl he had left behind.
Oh, if she could only see him now!
Would she recognise the once immacu-
lately dressed and neatly groomed youth,
holding a good position in a Melbourne
bank? What a contrast between his
conditions then and now! How little he
imagined in the happy, care-free days of
peace that he would be able to bring him-
self to perform what he had done at dawn
that morning. His peace-loving, genteel
soul would have been nauseated at the
prospect.
But grim necessity, born of a patriotic
fervour, had demanded it. He had heard
the call of duty, strong, insistent, imper-
ative. And he soon learned to adapt
himself to the work. Duty had ordained
it should be his, for necessity is nature's
master.
? ? ?
Lost in thought among the lacerated
bodies and general disorder, he did not
notice his officer approaching.
" Don't sit there day-dreaming ; get on
with your work!" came the voice of
authority.
He jumped to his feet, saluted, and,
sharpening his knife on a handy steel,
he again vigorously attacked the gory
work commenced at dawn that morning
of cutting up the day's meat ration.
He was the Battalion butcher.?P.L.H.

HOW WE FARED IN THE LINE.
We had a fairly good spin in the line
this trip, and if the weather had only
held up, instead of raining cats and dogs
on the second last day, and the last
night, we would have called it a good
holiday. The rain made things very
uncomfortable in the front line, flooding
the shelters and causing the trench
wails to slide in. One company (H.Q.)
had a coushy little dug-out till the
heavens wept, after which the inmates
had to sit on the table or other improvised
eminences. Oh, what a life !
We had our roughest time going into
the trenches. At times it was " pas
bon," and but for the fact that the bombs
dropped on us from a friendly Hun plane
were " made in Germany," and therefore
mostly duds, we would have had to re-
gret some casualties.
S.M. Bradshaw was a casualty which
we much regret to record. He was one
of the Battalion's early reinforcements,
and a thorough soldier. He was known
to have had a presentiment of impending
bad luck before he Went up, which seemed
to have been very strong upon him. Un-
fortunately it proved true.
While in the line we took: the oppor-
tunity of erecting crosses to the memory
of Lieuts. A. Brewster, L. H. Eitelberg,
o. O. Ethell, N. J. Moore, C.S.M. F. E.
Bradshaw, Sgts. T. Thomas, J. F. Corn-
mions, Opl. R. J. McLean, Lee. Cpls. T.
H. Rowe and F. Wilson, Privates L. B.
Sims, M. L. McGannon, W. Russell, C.
V. Thomas-, T. J. Carlson, W. J. Purcell,
G. Tehan, A. C. Brakey, D. Bruhn, A. H.
Williamson.
The work of the battalion runners was
again good, and they are certainly to be
complimented on their achievement in
guiding the relief forces into the line.
This they did with only ono casualty,
under the officership of Lieutenant W.
M. Simpson.
Our relief was carried out without
any serious happening, although shells
were numerous.
During our time in a Tommy officer
and 50 men had been told to report be-
tween two pill-boxes at a certain hour.
The party duly arrived at the appointed
time, but didn't count on the clocks
being put back, and were therefore an
hour ahead. The men were promptly
collected by the 23rd, and thus 50 of our
men were relieved in the work of bury-
ing cable.
