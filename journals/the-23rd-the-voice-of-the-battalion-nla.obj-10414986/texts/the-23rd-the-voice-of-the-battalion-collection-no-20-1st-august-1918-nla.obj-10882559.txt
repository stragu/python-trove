WHERE WE ARE.
VI.
? / "
On guard. Before a great city?the
enemy's objective of but a short time ago
in a spasmodic rush for the goal so much
desired, but never will it be realised. Al-
though metaphorically "on, guard," and
assisting in acting as a buffer previously
between a peaceful populace and hordes
of ambitious and merciless invaders, we
are not stationary by any means. The
tables have turned, and the object of pro-
tection recedes gradually to the rear and
ominous sound of the guns are less heard
by those plying their peaceful vocations.
The national motto, "Advance Australia,"
is maintained valiantly and truly by
harrassing, persistent and determined
tenacity, shattering the aims of the Bosch,
and forcing him slowly and surely from
whence he came at tremendous sacrifice.
Although gaining ground and inflicting
punishment consistently, it is pleasurable
to note the remarkable low ebb of casual-
ties, notwithstanding a trip " over the
bags " and other strenuous duties.
The weather has been favorable lately,
and necessary work is carried on in cir-
cumstances much more pleasanter than #t
certain periods of the year. The numerous
woods surrounding are beautifully green
and delightful to the eye, despite the
ferocious despoilers' daily attempts at
destruction from long range. Ridge and
valley slumbers under blue skies and
snow-white flitting clouds. The deserted
villages bear silent testimony that the
dread, ravaging monster War Iras
cruelly descended in their midst, but the
effort of complete devastation frustrated.
The trenches are dry and easy of peram-
bulation, thereby assisting in the work of
consolidation, etc,; roads are more pleas-
ant,on the march ; bivouacs are compar-
atively comfortable, and there is water in
abundance in moot parts for ablution &Dd
domestic use. The great boon of river
bathing is indulged in and greatly appre-
ciated by the boys when relieved for a
spell from trench vigil and fatigue.
Our trans-atlantic cousins having joined
in the fray, intermingle occasionally in
splendid comradeship, and confidences are
exchanged as only mutual admiration
allows. The newcomers have been tried,
and have already set a standard of
courage and efficiency worthy of the
world's greatest Republic.

FRONTISPIECE
?The cover design on the front page of
this issue is the work of Lieut. G. L.
Nightingale, of B Coy., and embodies all
the original ideas, as well as the motto
and honors of the Battalion in a new
theme. We feel proud that it is alto-
gether the idea of the artist, for we have
made a practice of carrying on the little
journal on lines entirely our own. Mr.
Nightingale, who in private life is an
art teacher of high repute, was unfortun-
ately wounded in a recent encounter,
but we wish him a speedy and complete
recovery, and trust that many more
specimens of his talented work will
appear in these columns from time to
time.
It is four years ago this week since
the blare of trumpets resounded through-
out the world, calling to arms the defen-
ders of Liberty aud Justice against a
tyrannical foe. 'The tide of victory has
swayed erratically, but the ultimate
predominance of Right is without doubt.
The beacon of Hope gleams brightly
ahead.

HUNTING IN ONE NINE ONE EIGHT.
" Say, Digger, I hear we're going to
relieve the Germans to-night." Thus
one of the Anzacs in the old frontline
the day prior to the " glorious fourth,
to our Divisional Commander, who was
round " just to have a look at the boys "
before the hop-over in the morning. Re-
ceiving a glance and smile for his wit,
the " live" Anzac quickly saw the open-
ing for the " hard word, and added,
" what about a bit of relief for us, Gen-
eral?" This reminds one of another
story of which ,the unconscious author
was the well-known and admired senior
officer at present attached to us. The
C.O. of the " Base " was going the rounds
of inspection. Halting before a party
fallen in in front of their tidy tent he saw
one man whose face he remembered.
Like an old soldier he halted and spoke
to the "digger." Moving on, these words
fell from the mouth of the man next to
him spoken to 1 ? "Strike me pink!
An' 'e never put the 'ard word on for
leave. Out 'e goes outer this. tent.'
But this is digressing from the story of
the stunt.
In the line twenty-four hours before
"zero," to get a knowledge of country,
the time was spent polishing bayonets,
"cleaning specks of dust off rifle bolts and
Lewis guns, looking carefully at our
precious " Mill's," and straightening the
pins slightly. Time dragged slowly,
especially the last hour or two, until at
1.30 a.m. came the order to file out of the
trenches. ' This we did noiselessly and
Lfoifnd the J.O.T. Forming up into our
Lproofer positions in the long wheat crop,
we were not much troubled with enemy
fire, altho' chubby Cpl. Ellis, M.M.. of B
Coy., met his end " on the tape.
* " Say, Bill, that's a ' dinkum ' barrage,"
was heard amidst the roar of harrassing
fire at 3.2 a.m. It was nothing to what
was to come, however. At 3.10 the noise
was hellish, and over we went. It is at
this moment that a man knows no sen-
sation of danger, pain, hunger or thirst.
His nerves- are strung to the highest
pitch of-excitement, which carries him
on. A short distance to go, a short sharp
fight hero and there, and the objective
trench is ours, except for a small section
in the gap between B and D Coys. Our
boys are bombing along already, tho,'
and Fritz gets out and dashes tor the
crops in rear. Many never reach it, and
those that do have a sorry time, for now
a noise like a hundred aeroplanes thun-
ders down on us, and over our newly-
won trench glides our latest monster
tanks. They put the fear of God into
Fritz, and give us a feeling of security
so that we can proceed to organise the
captured trench against a possible
counter-attack. "A " Cov., on the left,
had further to go, and their duty was to
establish a chain of posts between " B "
Coy. left flank and the right flank of 21st
Battn. This was done, and done well.
It remains to be told how, later in the
day, our C.O. personally reconnoitred
the captured position, and also a 'possy"
offering a better site some two hundred
yards in advance ; how we occupied this
additional ground, how we found Fritz
quite demoralised and forced for want of
C.T., and owing to our commanding
position, to send rations to his forward
men per aeroplane. We shall only add
that fourteen more machine guns
other trophies are now labelled " Vv T ax-
Museums, Australia," and that lxxany
Hunnish Hocks are labelled elsewhere.

As there are numerous enquiries from
officers and men who have returned to
the unit after a period of absence, for
back numbers of this journal, we beg to
state that copies cannot be kept unless a
personal notification is received as soon

is to supply each member of the Bat-
talion with a copy, and circumstances do
not permit " hoarding " of paper.
Cricket reports will appear next issue.

CORRESPONDENCE.
�
THE CANTEEN.
To the Editor " 23rd."
Sir, ?In your issue of July Ist, under
the heading of " A Grievance," two alleg-
ations? " Favoritism and Overcharging "
are made against the canteen staff. In
justice to them some reply is necessary.
With regard to the first charge we will
admit that, at times, petrol tins of beet-
were taken away from the canteen, but
only to the extent of five francs' worth to
each Company cookhouse when it was
asked for, and on one or two occasions, a
limited quantity to the Transport. This
concession was made to place the cooks
and the men of the Transport? who were
all engaged about their duties when the
beer was on sale? on an equality with the
other members of the Battalion. Apart
from these two instances no " favoritism "
in the distribution of " the cup that
cheers " has been shown.
With reference to the charge that the
prices in the canteen are 66 invariably
higher than those ruling in the other
Brigade and Y.M.C.A. canteens, one of
the two things is the case: either the
writer shows a pitiful ignorance of elemen-
tary English, cr is purposely maligning
the staff. The latter alternative we re-
fuse to believe, and will, therefore, chari-
tably conclude that lie is unaware of the
real meaning of the word " invariably.
Will not the dictionary, Mr. Editor, bear
us out in defining it as "without, excep-
tion ? " Such being the case, if it can he
proved that any one article is sold at a
similar price hv any other Brigade or
Y.M.C.A. canteen, then his statement is
palpably misleading and untrue. For the
information of " Those that Eight, how-
ever, it may he stated that " the powers
that Toe toured the various canteens
mentioned and compared prices, with the
result 'that in practically every instance
the charges made were identical. The
exceptions were in the case of goods
which had been purchased at French
shops, and which had to be,sold at higher
prices than if we had purchased them at
the E.F.C.
We welcome enquiry, but of your kind-
ness, gentlemen, in making charges, do
not be so sweeping indefinite, but quote
something specific, and if the charge can
be proven, " the powers that be ?" will
undertake to have any abuse rectified and
cause of complaint removed.
In view of these facts, Mr. Editor, may
wo be pardoned if we think that those
who made such charges would have been
acting much moie fairly if they bad not
sheltered under .'lie cloak of anonymity,
but had let us know to whom we were
indebted for the kindly (?) interest and
attention.

FRANCE'S FETE DAY.
As everyone knows Sunday, 14th July,
;vas France's great national day, and
was not only celebrated in her own fair
ountry, but right throughout the far-
ung lands of her Allies. How gloriously
and bravely she has borne herself in this
fierce conflict against the Teutonic ag-
gressor seeking to subjugate all the free
people of the earth has been told over and
over again. What valor at Verdun!
What heroic visions that name calls up.
The very trenches there cemented with
France's best blood. Yet, after her
bleeding and fighting, this wonderful
nation is advancing against the des-
poilers ?a .veritable Goddess of Ven-
geance 1 France, with her glorious
history, will again be, as she has in the
past, " the gern and wonder of the
earth."
The French troops were " en fete " on
that day and entertained a number of
our boys with "beaucoup " of every thing.
On their red issue wine the Australians
drank to "la belle France," and the
French, in their polished manner, drank
to our distant land, and praised us for
being jolly good fellows and valiant
fighters. One dusky soldier, belonging
to the " Legion d'Afric," spoke English
"tres bien," and had quite an audience of
the red and brown diamonds around him.
He was kept plied with questions anent
matters of no military importance. It
was perfect how he punctuated tales told
by our boys about their wonderful, sunny
continent, with " Surely now; by the
Lord God ! " Souvenirs changed hands,
and night had drawn on her sable rai-
ment ere the " Aussies" departed to their
billets, taking with them pleasant mem-
ories of many pleasant hours spent
with their famous French comrades,
among the tall poplars.
THE TWENTY-THIRD. Aug. Ist.


"TOMMY."
?
" Greater love hath no man than to
lay down his life," etc. ? How often can
the old Biblical quotation be applied to.
those who have gallantly fought and
faced death?for a pal, for an officer, for
King and country?and died as only a
soldier can.?His duty done. " Tommy''
was a soldier with an accent on the'first
and last syllable. As good a lad as ever
donned a uniform, or carried a pack
thro' -France and Flanders. A sunny
son of a sunny country ?a comrade in
every possible sense of the word. When
"Tommy" wasn't cheerful, well, there
wasn't anything left to be cheerful about-
In the height of summer or the depth of
Europe's snowy winter it was almost a
tonic to hear his " tres bien" in reply to
the customary " How are you,-Tom ? "
As "factotum" to a popular platoon
commander he appeared to be his pride
and joy, and they were more like brothers
than officer and man, for in times of
stress, the same funk-hole in the trench
often accommodated the two, with the
remark jocularly passed that it was with
them like " the babes in the wood." It
seemed that one was as "mascot" to the
other.
He was one of the early enlist-
ments, and came away with the Bat-
talion when it set out on its since com-
pleted thousand days fighting enterprise.
He .weathered, the stormy times of the
Peninsula and the Pine. His anecdotes
of those days were told with a truthful
simplicity that was pleasing to reinforce-
ments of later dates. Even in France
his lucky star was in the ascendant, and
altho* taking a proud and prominent part
in almost every stunt of note, he escaped
the serious attention of Fritz's artillery
again and again.
There came a time, when in action
during one of th 3 Battalion's most stren-
uous northern poriods, it happened that
a large portion of the trench was blown
in, and a number of officers and men
buried 'neath the?arth. " Tommy " was
the first to extricate himself, and it was
his diligent work in gallantly digging
(altho' badly shaken) that was respon-
sible for the lives of those who were
saved, his officer amongst them, but badly
wounded.
Recognition came in the shape of a
medal militaire from the Belgian govern-
ment for gallant conduct?'a decoration
deservedly awarded.
The exigencies of war brought about
the officer's evacuation, and caused a
change in the routine of Tommy's life.
The same manner, but settled into a quiet
reserve, and he faced the line with a
cheerful resignation to anything that
Fate might bring him. And so he passed
this life ?until ?orte morning, "sniped,"
we heard. With that bullet went thedife
of " Tommy."
Along with thousands of others he lies,
the spot marked only by the regulation
cross, but if there is room in Heaven for
those who have fought, then surely there
will be a place reserved in its brightest
corner for a soldier known and loved by
us all.
A "Bulletin" writer says: ?"I was
standing in the Strand awaiting a friend
when a Queenslander walked up and
asked, " Are you doing anything ? " Af-
ter my explaining, he said, "Oh, it
doesn't matter. I only wanted a witness
to my wedding. That's her over there
waiting qn me."
