No. 17. 15th JUNE, 1918. Price, Ten Centimes.
AN AIM.
4
After three years' active service one's
thoughts might naturally turn and ask
" What is the paramount obligation of a
soldier to maintain the prestige and good
name of his battalion?" Undoubtedly the
spirit of loyalty, whether it be to those
placed as leaders, or to his comrades,
stands out most prominently before us.
The life of a soldier, no matter of what
rank, is, on active service, an exacting
strain on the democratic spirit of an
Australian, and it cannot be otherwise,
suddenly torn from a life of comparative
independence and freedom to that of a
fighting man, with its periods of moton-
ous routine, hemmed by restrictions of
all kinds and wearying fatigue, to that
of intense strain on mind and body in
the forward battle zone. Despite this
disability, our lads have worthily filled
the role, and it is to the splendid spirit of
loyalty and co-operation throughout that
has undoubtedly helped to maintain the
prestige of Australia's Army. With our
Battalion the spirit of loyalty and good-
fellowship has always been uppermost.
May it never be lost. Rather, it behoves
us one and all to carry on, maintain and
foster that chief essential " Esprit de
Battalion."?W.B., Lt.-Col.
PROPHECY.
Absolute knowledge have I none,
But my aunt's charwoman's sister's son
Heard a policeman on his beat
Say to a housemaid'in Downing Street,
That he had a brother who had a friend
Who knew when the war was going
to end.
CONGRATULATORY.
The following messages have been
received from Australia, re the recent
stunt:
Melbourne, 20th May.
Continued successful work of our
troops very gratifying. Congratulate
2nd Division on their recent action.
SENATOR PEARCE.
Melbourne,- 22nd May.
Convey congratulations 2nd Divi-
sion on their splendid work.
SENATOR PEARCE.
A. parcel mail for Victoria, posted
approximately between May 3 and 16,
and a parcel mail for N.S.W., between'
April 15 and May 16, have been lost at
sea through enemy action.
THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION ?


BATTALION ORGANISATION.
SIGNALLING.-No. 2.
In our last issue we dealt mainly with
means and instruments utilised for inter-
communication on active service. In
this article it is proposed to show how
are welded in the Batta-
e.g., man power, how
is organised, training,
etc. Battalion sig-
nalling demands
the services of
fifty-two men,
twenty-eight on
Brigade H.Q. staff
?ll and six per Coy., in
addition to twenty-eight run-
. ners required. The preliminary
training and the work itself re-
quires a well-educated man, keen and
alert. In the early days the whole train-
ing of a signaller depended upon instruc-
tion given in the Battalion. Nowadays,
however, the reinforcement who has been
selected for the signalling branch goes
through a fourteen weeks' course before
classifying as a signaller, and joining up.
In addition to this course, conducted in
England, at the training base, schools
of instruction are held in France, and
a percentage from the line battalions are
sent to the school. At these schools the
syllabus includes training in all means
of communication in the field. A thor-
ough working knowledge of telephones,
lamps, amplifier, power buzzer, flags,
shutters and aeroplane signalling is
required. The foundation of communi-
cation by these instruments is the Morse
Code, which is universal. The final
tests are buzzer (take and send ten words
per minute), lamps, flags, shutters (six
words per minute). The procedure
adopted, office routine and writing of
messages, is by no means the simple
phase of a signaller's work that the un-
initiated would imagine. This is ail
thoroughly taught and explained.
The signallers in a battalion are classi-
fied operators or linesmen, and if a
battalion is fortunate enough to secure
the trained mechanic, he is enrolled, and
does invaluable work in the care and
upkeep of the delicate instruments com-
mitted to his charge, thus saving the
return to repair workshops.
The control and supervision in a bat-
talion is carried out by the signalling
officer on Battalion H.Q. staff, one Ser-
geant, one Corporal and one L-Corporal ?
in charge of operators, and one of the
latter rank in charge of linesmen.
Though signalling demands the best
type of soldier, and the training is most
exacting, as will be seen by the small
number of N.0.0.s on establishment.
Promotion is very slow. This, in itself,
is a great disadvantage, for 95 per cent,
of our soldiers are anxious to rise. .
On moving into the front line the
operators take over their miniature,
and sometimes improvised, switch boards
and secure the code names of each
station. The linesmen get into touch
with the comrades they are relieving,
first having the routes and any compli-
cation of wires explained, then a
run over the route of the wires,
and the relief of their depart-
ment is complete.
The value of
maintaining
communica-
tion is appar-
ent. By its
means many
an action of the
enemy has been
forestalled.

SIXTH BRIGADE DEPOT.
It is with grateful thanks and appreci-
ation that the Battalion acknowledges a
further gift of �25. sent for the purpose
of providing comforts.
The depot is still a very live institution
of the Brigade, and one in which all
ranks feel a deep sense of gratitude for
the manifold comforts it provides. I rem
the thriving Ballarat branch of recent
formation we have already received par
eels of sox, included in one being a
whistle cord made by Mr. Rowlands, who
has well passed the allotted span of three
score years and ten.
Much interest is caused in the perusal
of a paper now issued by the headquar-
ters of the Depot. The few copies which
reach the Battalion are eagerly looked
for and passed around. The items deal
with the work of the Depot, and also in-
clude news from the Brigade, The paper
serves a further link with the lads at the
front, and the loyal band of womenfolk
who devote so much time and work in
helping those on active service.
In connection with the War Loan
Day, in Ballarat, during March, a pro-
cession was held, followed by a big rally
in the Alfred Hail. All those who had
relatives at the front, or who had assisted
in war work took part.
A feature of the procession was the
banner of the Ballarat Branch of the
Sixth Brigade Comforts Fund. Brigade
colors occupied the central position in
the color scheme of the four Battalions,
which was worked in the corners, with
A.A.M.C. in between. The banner was
the work ol the ladies of the branch, all d
was carried by a number of them. The
following ladies known to the Battalion
took active part:?Mesdames Brazenor,
Matthews, Baird, Morrell, Kinsman, Lin-
eker, Beith (mother of Maj. Beith), Pascoe
(mother of Capt. Pascoe.)
THE CALL!
" Should I enlist? " This question daily
comes
To each man's heart,?and answer he
must give.
Why ? Because the nation's calling now
On him ?you, and me, that it may live.
The years of gladness and of peace are
gone ;
And loud the warcry peals o'er land
and sea.
I hear a voice of comrades calling loud ;
Yes, calling for you ?for you and me.
Can you sit in silence while that voice
In accents low and deep your help
implores ?
Can you sit idly by, while others go
To' fight your fight,-to die for Free-
dom's cause ?
Lurid warcloud lights the western world
And men in thousands die,? yet thous-
ands come.
When Duty calls with its clarion voice.
And bids you answer, ?will it find you
dumb ?
Weary months jiass on ; you linger still,
"Some day we'll go!" you say, and
still you wait,
And others go?Perchance, some day,
you'll find
When you have gone, that you have
gone too late.
That cannot be! In this fair Southern land
Each man will nobly answer Duty's call,
With comrades brave will fight a hero's
fight:
And for his country he will nobly fall.
Again that voice in anguished tones
shall call !
The hero's voice ?the laurel round his
brow
I listen to the words you now shall speak,
I hear your answer?"l am coming
now!"I?H. 1 ?H. C. Holland.

A swimming carnival, in which the
following events were contested, was
held by the Battalion on the atternoon of
May 30th.
The number of entries was good, and
the interest which the carnival evoked
was evidenced by the attendance of
spectators.
The contests resulted as follows:

terpretation of " The Sky Pilot " was
excellent.
Cricket has began to get popular in
spare time. Incidentally, we might
form a good team, now that a prominent
Inter-state player has become our M.O.
in succession to the " little doc."
Transport and Coy. Cooks played a
one innings' match in the transport
lines the other evening. The game was
much enjoyed, Transport winning by

BATTALION ORGANISATION.
(Continued from page 4.)
Our artillery are notified to place a bar-
rage on a certain sector of No Man's
Land. Information to higher authority
is of greatest importance, as only by such
means can supports and reserves he quick-
ly made use of. Day and night the
'phones are manned, reliefs being worked
two hours on and four off. Where possi-
ble the signal office, which one might term
the nerve centre, oi the battle sector, is
placed in a deep dug-out. This is not
often, but the importance of a compara-
tively secure office from enemy shell-lire is
recognised, and our Engineer Company
quickly takes steps to remedy any deficen-
cy in "this respect. The signals' office is
always 'placed close to Battalion Head-
quarters, usually in a spot 300 to 1000
yards in the rear of the front line. To the
linesmen falls the nerve-racking and haz-
arduous tasks of maintaining the wires,
and too much praise cannot be given to the
heroic and splendid services they render,
for "it is generally recognised that their
work calls for great bravery, going and
coming' from the line through the barrage

OUR PEOPLE.
Across the oceans' boundless blue,
From Austral's shore to Egypt's blaz-
ing sand,
Thro' shimmering calms and storms a few
By many a strange and foreign land.
Thro' searching heat and noonday glare,
Where dusky maids in garments white,
With gleaming teeth and raven hair
Welcomed the boys who had come to
fight.
On thro' the Agean seas, sparkling and
clear,
To the slopes of the barren, windswept
Gallipoli,
'Twas there he learnt to fight l ?to shed a
tear
For our pals who had fallen for home
and liberty.
Of the way we left there, .there is little
to relate,
But we left our name for ever, and
many a pal so true,
Back to the sands of Egypt ?to march,
and swear and hate*
The very sight of camels, and the land
that bore them too.
Far from the lure of cities, and sight of
water cool;
In-solitude made bearable, by song and
sport and band
We spent a happy time, tho' sandstorms
were so cruel,
Until we marched Moasca way, a, far
more fertile land, :
Our next move was to France, the bur-
den there to share
With French and British-soldiers of fame
a,nd great renown,
Who'd fought as men should, who never
would despair,
Tho' odds were great, their hearts were
not bowed down.
Three long years, of joy and sorrow too,
In many a nasty corner, where death
was lurking near;
Thro' snow and mud and rain, when
never a man but who
Knew not and cared not when he'd
hbar the call to clear.
But wherever we may be, in sickness and
in health. �
Our hopes will e'er be strong
To return to the land of the Common-
wealth,
And " Our People,!' yrho have waited
so long.
?A.Q,
PINCHED PARS
The following appears in " sassiety "
columns of Melbourne "Punch": ?The
marriage of Miss Gwen Warnock, second
daughter of Mr, and Mrs. S. J. Warnock,
of" Wombalano," Toorak road, Malvern,
with Mr. John L. Wharton, (late Lieut-
enant 23rd Battalion, A.J.F.), only son of
Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Wharton, "Clive-
den," East Melbourne, is arranged to
take place quietly at the Melbourne
Grammar School chapel shortly. VVe
" presumption " that the deed has since
been done, and send congratulations to
the couple.
The Victoria Amateur Turf Club (says
" Australasian ") has decided to give the
State War Council �5OOO towards its
funds, also �lOO to the Red Cross Volun-
teer Motor Corps. Altogether the club
has given approximately �40,000 to war
funds and other patriotic purposes since
August, 1914.
