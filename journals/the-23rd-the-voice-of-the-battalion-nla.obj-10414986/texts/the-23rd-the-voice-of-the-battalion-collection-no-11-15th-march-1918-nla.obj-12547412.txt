AU REVOIR.
?
To the most peaceful village it has ever
been our lot to billet in?Farewell. To
the simple and kindly folk of one of the
hundreds of hamlets of similar kind we
said our An Revoir last week, and as we
prepared for our journey to take up grea-
ter and graver duties rheir feelings were
made manifest by the many little acts
just prior to our departure in the dim
light of breaking dawn. Small were these
tokens of regard and affection?such as a
cup of coffee to ease the chill ere the move-
ment began, a scrap of some French
dainty to supplement the scanty ration, or
a bottle of home-made cider ?but they
?were appreciated far and above their value
by the boys, and they will be remembered
long after, and thought of often when the
turmoil ceases and the guns have given
up their roar. True, our acquaintance was
all too short, but the friendship was as
sincere as it was spontaneous, and we have
reason to believe that the 2.lrd Battalion
made an impression that will develop into
a lasting good opinion �f those soldiers
who hail from the Southern Ctoss, that is
provided those who follow us uphold the
good reputation, and "carry on " as men
and soldiers should do.
FORWARD.
?
There's a deal of slick commotion
When the troops are set in motion.
To pack their kits and toddle to the line.
They leave their "rests' with sorrow
Their thoughts arc of the morrow,
When they go to face the whizz-bangs and
the slime.
Coquetting with winsome wenches
They prefer to grimy trenches,
But their chatties bang together with a
click ;
The day that they are shifting
To shell crash and duckboard lifting,
And dodging into dug-outs pretty quick.
They leave behind the roguish glance
From maidens fair of " sunny " France,
While settled in the hamlet for a rest.
For Billjim's greatest pleasure
When out on well-earned leisure,
Is to " parlez vous " with them in honest
jest.
So through this life they go
In sunshine, rain or snow ;
The "in " and "out" of war a constant
grind
But where e'er the boys may be
There's a sweet, long memory
Of Anssy and a girl he's left behind.


BIRTH.
TICH.--In the Transport lines, on Sun-
day, March 10th, "Little Tich," the
Mascot dog, of a triplet family. All
doing well, Australian papers please

GENERALITIES.
Sorry, Capt. Moss,but Lieut. Morrell's
fine platoon got pipped on the post at
the Brigade competitions.
It must be pleasing to Transport
Officer, Lieut. Hume, to see the boys
pull off so many prizes in the recent
parade.
The Brigade Major, who has been
recently married, was the recipient of
the good wishes of all the officers and
men.
Orders say that the boys are to be
issued with caps in lieu of "le grand
chapeau" when they go on Blighty
leave. Are we to lose our identity ?
Much ado about Nothing. ?One of the
most exciting incidents during our stay
in billets was the birth of a calf. After
waiting for quite a lengthy period for
the great event, "baby bully beef"
arrived on the- scene. After that, great
rejoicing and wine all round, in which
the boys of A Coy. duly drank the health
of the new-born
-O- bashful young W.O.
At Paris was doing the sights,
. The mornings were " snoosy,"
The afternoons ?" Susie,"
But what of the beautiful nights ?
The Y.M.C.A. picture show, opposite
the Transport lines, is a great boon to
troops of all branches of the service, in
helping to pass the long evenings. The
fact of no charge being made for ad-
mission emphasises the good work being
performed by that organisation.
The clocks'were put forward one hour
at eleven o'clock on Sunday last?Sum-
mer time.
"Jockey Jack," Lieut. Wiltshire, was
the envied recipient of the Brigade Blue
Ribbon at the horse parade.
" Where We Are " is where we were
in the first article on that subject, but
the snow and mud is absent, and things
are much livelier in the line.
The idyllic sublimity of climatic con-
ditions now prevailing brings into being
a feeling of exhuberant exhilaration,
causing the blood to pulsate through the
veins in vibratious effervescence, as cool,
sparkling water dashing over roughhewn
rocks.
We will not be surprised at being
overwhelmed with an avalanche of spring
"poetry" next issue. But steady, lads,
the Fighting Editor is very fit.
Many thanks to Lieut. Hume, of the
Transport, and those under him, for the
great care always taken with the Bat-
alion Press gear when on the move.
L-Cpl. Larry Herz has, we understand,
written entirely from memory the old,
but ever-green comedy, " Fun on the
Bristol," which will be produced in due
course by the Red Diamond combination
of actors, known as the Sixth Brigade
Concert Party. It is presumed that
L-Cpl. Herz will manage the production.
That Australians loVe their health-
giving field sport was evidenced at the
last billets by the fact that on one after-
noon there was quite a variety to choose
from by the onlooker. Over the hill the
Australian game of football was being
played. At the foot Soccer or Rugby
was being contested by enthusiasts, and
a short distance away equestrian com- *
petitions were taking place. Perhaps,
also, the Colonel and Second in Command
were touring the meadows with "goff"
sticks and polite language. (?)

FINIS.
SERGEANT-MAJOR COX.
With the deepest of regrets, shared by-
all, we record the death of the above
comrade, gallant soldier and good fellow.
To his people in Australia we here
extend our sympathy, and tablet the
fact that he was " one of the best," and
a pal of us all, who will never be for-
gotten.
SHARPS AND FLATS.
?
A report of the band trip appeal's on
pages 4, 5 and 6.
At entertaining, the Australian nurs-
ing Sisters " beat the band."
Anzacs arm in arm with W.A.A.C.s
promenade the seafront. " Tommy "
looks on. Cheeky wretches, Anzacs!
" Amex" well represented in the sea-
port town. Some swank, too.
" II Trovatore," so capably rendered by
the band at the two hospitals, was the
composer's (Verdi) greatest achievement.
One, at least, of our officers is popular
with those most charming of our Aus-
tralian women ?the nursing sister's -
judging by the vivacious bevy he was
surrounded by at No. 2 Australian
General.
When " an outsider " got too close to
N , the result of a stealthy potion
of the " the cup that cheers " reached
her nostrils, but she was polite--very
polite. An excited ejaculation, " You've
been-you've been ?Gassed ! " was her
way of putting it.
" RAMMYISMS."
?
The A.I.F. is indeed a wondrous thing.
In it are many men and manners. It
taketh the rich with the poor, and per-
adventure thy Batman of the day may
be the Brigadier of to-morrow.
Speak kindly to the Quartermaster,
and peradventure, thy reward will surely
come.
Take heed to dodge the " minnie "and
the " whizz-bang," that thy days may be
long in the land.
Blessed is the " Aussy" who spends
two years in Blighty, for then shall he
be classed as an Anzac, and be entitled
to spurs and feathers. s.
Beware of the Red, which means
Staff, and the Blue, which means Anzac.
Dodge them as thou would an Engineers'
fatigue.
Speak kindly to the Sapper, and give
him cigarettes of the brand that are
Players, so that thy fatigue party may
get home early.
Verily, the duckboards are a blessing,
but when Fritz shells the track we
assuredly get the " wind up."
The House of Horseferry Road is in
deed a large house., and in it are many
maidens, likewise many soldiers," who
liketh not the smell of the trenches.
In rest thou shalt have many drills,
and kit inspections, and for any short-
ages thou shalt pay.
Look not on the " vin " when it is
"blanc," for then shall the road rise
up and smite thee, and thy legs become
an abomination.
If on one tot of rum thouwouldst take
three lines of trenches, God help the
Kaiser if thou bad'st the whole jar.
Verily, a sandbag is a comfortable
thing. It buildeth up the parapet, and
improveth thy dugout, but if a 5.9 strike
it, then who can save it'?

A MUSICAL FEAST.
TO HOSPITAL PATIENTS.
Whirr! Buzz!! Not a whizz-bang.
It is the 23rd Battalion Band off on a
twenty-five kilo motor trip, to sea-
side, on an entertaining ' stunt, to help
to break the monotony of comrades
convalescing or on the sick bed. Hie
performers aboard were : Bandmaster,
W. Wilson ; soloist, J. Baird;. solo cor-
nets, J. Robertson, J. Doake ; first cor-
nets, S. Savage, H. George; second
cornets, C. Davis, F. Hamilton ; third
cornet, R. Dawson; solo horn, A.
Bennier; first horn, E. Browne; second
horn, S. Harris; third horn, G. Cole-
man ; first baritone, R. Ferguson ; second
baritone, R. L. Hudson; solo uphonium,
R. Berndt; euphonium, A. Green; Eb
bass, W. Ketterer, W. Pomeroy; Bb bass, ,
W.Scott, H. Carrol; first trombone. S.
Wickers; second trombone, J. Hosking;
bass trombone, W. Hansen; side drums,
J. Reid, G. McKenzie; bass drum, A.
Hudson, and Drum Major E. Langley.
Major Beith and Capt. Galbraith also
participated in the first day s trip, and
kept the driver company in the more
than cool atmosphere.
No. 25 General Hospital.
We glide steadily along to the beat and
song of the driving band, between leaf-
less but neatly trimmed hedges, up hill
and down dale, with snow-capped hills
all round, The day promises fair at the
start, but eventually glowering clouds
bank up over the hill tops, and a raw,
bleak wind penetrates muffler and great-
coat, but does not cool the ardor of the
boys on their journey to give pleasure to
those less fortunate than themselves.
The Brigade Concert Party is picked up
~by the wayside, bent on a similar errand
and �ff again we rattle past picturesque
farmhouses, through quaint villages, and
the narrow, winding streets of small
towns. The roads are fair until nearing
the sand dunes of the coast, then they
become as if a severe barrage had been
thrown on them, and our conveyance
bumps and rolls like a tank chasing
Huns, as we approach our
a typical French seaside resort. The
hospital is the second largest in France,
facing the channel, and evidently an
ideal position when the sky is blue and
summery zeyphyrs breathe, but on this
occasion an arctic wind blows, and
blizzards of snow sweep the esplanade
and seafront. A fine hall, however,
awaits the lads, and after the necessary
operation of revictualling, under the
direction of two kindly "Aussy" sisters
the band renders its'programme to a
gathering of between 700 and 800
patients, who appreciated the items
muchly, especially the solo parts and
selections from the operas. The follow-
ing was the treat served under the baton
of Sgt. Wilson during the afternoon
March, "The Cossack" (W.Rimmer);
grand selection, " II TTovatore ' (Verdi);
selection,." Bound to Win," (Henry E.
Pether); cornet and euphonium duet,
"A Night in Venice " (G. Lucantoni),
J. Baird and A. Green ; descriptive fan-
tasia, "A Soldier's Life" (W. J. D.
Sherriff); grand selection, "Faust''
(Gounod); march, "The North Star
(W. Rimmer).
The Concert Party.
: In the evening the large hall was
again packed to its utmost by those able
? to get about, including many sisters re-
r lieved of their strenuous duties for the
> time being. The personnel of the concert
party consisted of Cpl. Romaine (23rd
> Battn.), Cpl. J. Lee (22nd Battn.), com-
edians; Pte. N. Shepherd (22nd), female
3 impersonator; Ptes. C. Seffior and A.
THE TWENTY-THIRD. March 15th.

Jones (21st) balladists ; Pte. A. Dawson
(23rd), juggler; M. Penny (6th M.G.C.),
yiddish comedian ; Johnson (23rd), pian-
ist; J. Trevor, M. Hayes (23rd), the
lights, and L-Cpl. L. Hertz (22nd), man-
ager, and successfully entertained the
audience, raising outbursts of hearty
laughter and applause. Jim Romaine,
as usual, bore the brunt of the recalls,,,
and Jack Lee was second favorite. The
other performers received due apprecia-
tion, and everyone was pleased. The
band were again in demand, and acted
as orchestra, rendering " Maritana"
(Wallace) as the overture, and including
"Merry Wido.w" (Franz Lehar) in the
selections. R. Berndt efficiently acted
as pianoforte accompanist.
Personal thanks to Sgt. Wilson and
L-Cpl. Hertz; a game of billiards or a
cup of coffee ; a confab over the fire, and
the journey back to billets at 1 a.m. left
a feeling of tiredness and satisfaction,
and everyone looked forward to the
second stunt, commencing a few hours
later.
No. 2 Australian General.
On the Sunday a journey to the above
hospital was undertaken, per shanks'
pony and train, on which there were no
speed recoids broken. Eventually the
train journey came to an end, and
1,25 p.m. saw the band, led by the drum
major, marching through a mercantile
and fishing town of large dimensions,
also a port of embarkation and disem-
barkation of troops. In a short walk to
the elestric tram compre electric tram
Digger ? ?there was seen faces of almost
every nation on earth, from the Kaffir
to the wily Chinee, even the " square-
head" was in evidence. A cosmopolitan
town indeed in war time ! A trip round
the edge of the sea to the accompani-
ment of waves dashing against a seawall
in places, with a fine view of the channel,
soon brought us to the No. 2 Genera!
Hospital, nicely laid out on the, crest ot
a hill, and mostly under canvas. Tho'
cool, the day was calm, and a slight
mist hung in the distance over the broad
expanse of water, lending an eerie soli-
tude to the scene. It is safe to say that
many gazed yearningly Blightywards
?so near and yet so far. The band was
received by a bevy of Australian sisters,
each of whom wore the trim and neat
nurses' uniform and a perpetual smile ?
one of those which won't wash off?-and
they immediately opened up a barrage of
delicacies from which the lads had to
eventually retreat for the business of
the afternoon, under a heavy fire of
beaming faces, nuts and sweets. The
charming sisters hailed from the har-
bour city and the city of gardens and
wide streets, and as Australians we had
to "pinch" something, so we "pinched"
their names for publication, which are
as follows: ?Acting Matron, Sister E. A.
Cuthbert; Sisters E. Gallin, M. Fisher,
C, Potter, M. R. Thomas, A. Dorrington,
E. Gallin, G. J. Whiting. A. S. Sweet,
B. Creswick, Norali Lehman, Victoria.
Sisters K. Rees, A-. J. McKenzie, E. P.
Wright, M. Fillans, N.S.W.
A programme was rendered by the
band on one of the lawns, which was
received by the inlying patients in the
wards with applause, and was much
appreciated by them. The items were
as follows: ?March, " 8.8., C.F." (J. Ord
Hume); selection, "Barber of Saville"
(Rossini); waltz, "Destiny" (Sydney
Baynes); selection, " Bing Boys" (Nat
D. Aver); selection, "The Turkish
Patrol " (Th. Michaelis) ; serenade,
"Birthday Greetings" (Paul Linki);
march, "Through Bolts and Bars"
(Ernest Urback.)
Impromptu selections were*again ren-
dered in the evening at the Y.M.C.A.
hall from six till seven, after which the
boys were let loose on well-earned

parole. The sleeping arrangements were
in ' keeping with, the reception. We
were tucked safely in " dinkum " beds
by acting sisters Geo. Mackenzie and
"Eat" Davis, who thoughtfully enquired
after their patients' throats. They all
proved dry, and the " dinkum oil " was
prescribed in suitable doses. There
were some very bad cases which required
a double dose, -and even that was. not
sufficient for the official scribe. He
was consoled with the fact that " there
was a wee drap in J th' bottle for th'
marnin'." It was not long, however,
when everyone was in dreamland in
the cosy snugness of a blanket or two
over the issue, to the accompaniment of
the flapping canvas of a huge marquee.
Some of the boys said that no sooner
had they gone to sleep when reveille
sounded. However, they had a good
night's rest and turned out spick and
span, and in good nick to again cheer
stricken comrades with a morning per-
formance of the programme which
relieved the dullness at No. 25 on the
Saturday. To say their efforts were
appreciated is putting it mildly. The
in-patients thoroughly enjoyed it, as a
visit to the wards proved. The Camp
Commandant heartily thanked the lads
for the treat, and the sisters' enthusiasm
was displayed in bountiful relays of tea
and toast, and the ever present smile,
combined with jovial banter, not for-
getting the "glad eye" and flirting?'
yes, flirting!
A hearty lunch, exchange of greetings
and souvenirs, a couple of hours sight-
seeing, and once more the train is
boarded, and only a memory-remains
a memory of sweet faces by the seaside,
and gratitude of striken comrades.
A big, hefty sergeant, named Harry,
For a trip went to lovely Paree,
When the girls knew his name
They said " fie for shame,"
Not "Petite" but "Grande," ma cherie.

A DREAM.
?
FRITZ SNIPERS TURNED INTO
FLY WHEELS.
In-Chicago they turn everything about
the pig into money except the squeal.
But -it has been reserved for a well known
Australian officer to outdo even that re-
markable fact.
Early one morning last week the sacred
precincts of our office were invaded by a
gaunt figure whose eyes shone with the
fiery gleams of some tremendous achieve-
ment. To add more to the "tout
ensemble '"'of his entrance, a terrific noise
of shellfire filled the air, and it was in vain
we tried to hear what he had to say.
After frantic gesticulations, he indicated
a desire for us to accompany him, and we
did so, dodging shell splinters, duckboards,
mud, etc. on the way. At the end of one
of the trenches he suddenly stopped and
pointed proudly to a strange looking ob-
ject built on the lines of a waterwheel. On
the end of each blade was a cut out head
and shoulders of a private. By pressing
a lever the whole wheel rose up a couple of
feet and almost immediately commenced to
revolve rapidly, while we had to take shel-
ter from a rain .of flattened bullets which
seemed to spatter from the top of the
wheel.
The explanation was simple. Each
head just peeped over the bank and was a
target for Fritz. As each blade came up
bringing another head into view, Fritz
simply peppered away, and the impact on
the iron heads provided sufficient power
to turn to useful account.
" There you are," he said-. " A row of
these and you Can. drive almost anything."
The colossal possibilities of the inven-
tion struck us dumb with astonishment.
What a glorious idea to drive bur new
multi-quadruple machine?when it arrives!
The shell fire havipg moderated some-
what, we could listen to his discourse on
the stupendous value of the invention,
and visions of millions and possibly more
floated before our dazed imaginations.
Then Well, when we woke up, we
discovered that our office was a thing of
the past, and pending a new and safer
dugout, most of our time is engaged in a
search for sufficient type to sec this issue
through. .
