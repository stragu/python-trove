Vol. 2.-No. 8. 15th FEBRUARY, 1919. Price, Ten Centimes.
Belgium?s Ruler.
?
The following brief sketch of the King
who has reigned during Belgium?s most
tragic period will no
doubt be interesting in
view of the fact that after
fighting for the liberation
of his people, we have for
some time partaken of
their hospitality?-
King Albert was born
on April the Bth, 1875,
and is therefore 43 years
of age. He is the second
son of the Count of Flan-
ders (a brother ot Leo-
pold II), who renounced
his claim to the crown in
favor of his eldest son.
This son, however, died in
1891, leaving the present
monarch the next in line.
Albert was the heir pre-
sumptive for eighteen
years, but was not proclaimed King
until 1909 at the age of 34. In 1900 he
married Princess Elizabeth, (daughter of
Charles Theodore, Duke of Bavaria, and
Marie Josephe Beatrice Duchess of Bra-
ganza, Princess of Portugal), the present
Queen, and there efre three children of
the union.
Albert has been in ac-
tive command of the army
almost from the begin-
ning, keeping in close
contact with his troops,
and in the last great
battles led them to vic-
tory. He is beloved of
his people as a soldier
and administrator, is an
ardent patron of the arts,
is intellectual to a degree
and has encouraged lit-
erature and learning to
the fullest extent. Under
his regime commerce in'
creased largely, and his
people before the war
were properous and
happy.
The King paid an in-
formal visit to Charleroi during the last
week in January, inspecting the in-
dustries of this thickly populated
centre.

battalion Organisation.
RATIONS.
'The British Army fights on its stom-
-'eh> has been .said again and again,
therefore the Q.M. and staff becomes the
most important medium thro? which the
feeding is done. Briefly-the establish-
consists of an officer in charge, a
I .i.i.S., a butcher, and two storemen,
?although in times of stress it is often
tound necessary to increase the per-
sonnel by two or three. Independent of
rood, the Q.M. handles the clothes, boots,
claukets, etc., and supervises the issue of
coniforts. The store acts in close liaison
with the front line, and difficulties, such
as Dad roads, and shortage of transport
are frequent. Punctuality is an essential
audjt is to the credit of Capt. Clues and
stau that only once during active service
have the troops been without supulies
for a day, and then only thro a hurried
change in arrangements. On one oc-
casion heavy shelling prevented the lim-
bers getting through, so an immediate
transierrer.ee of rations into sandbags
was effected, and headed by the Q.M.,
the party carried on, luckily without a
casuaiy. Once a church which was to
have been a depot for 24 hours? supplies
was demolished ten minutes before ar-
rival of the limbers. When on the march
iron rations (bully beef and biscuits) are
issued, a two or three days? supplies are
kept in the store in case of emergency.
Naturally enough the quantity and
quality of the army necessaries vary.
The rum and cigarettes are short, bread
is four to a loaf, accidents happen, and
the Q.M. is blasphemed, but as an auth-
ority on array supplies once remarked ?
?* I have seen the men with half rations,
and even quarter rations, but I have'
never seen starvation.?
Let ?lm Through.
A TOMMY'S PRAYER FOR HIS
CHUM.
Uli, Gawd, I a?int no ?and at prayin?.
An? sides it alius seems to me
As you must get fed up sometimes
Forgivin? everybody?s crimes
An? settiu? sinners free.
You must.be overworked a lot,
An? Peter?s got ?is ?ands full too.
Rut just look ?ere? my pal? ?es dead,
A chunk o? shrapnel in his ?ead ?
D ye fink as you could let ?im froo
When ?e comes up to you ?
Eh, d?ye fink you could ?
I wish you would ;
For, Gawd, ?is luck?s been awful bad,
Right bad it?s been,
An ? not a pal in ail the world ?cep me I mean
Ts face was all agen ?im
Tho? ?e id it best e?could.
That there mustashe was not much use
All yeller wiv tobaccer juice,
Altbo? it did some good.
But Gawd, just tell old Peter
To overlook his face,
So?s when my pal ere comes up there,
?E?ll billet ?im J don?t care where
So long?s Vs got a place ;
For I knows ?im Gawd, I knows im,
An? his missus an? kids as well.
An? I knows ?ow ?es slaved it forfifty hob,
An? i knows ?ow ?e listed an? chucked
, ? is J ob >
An? I know" ?e can fight tike ?ell,
An? I tell yer straight? if yer damns my
mate,
Y^er can blinkin? well damn me too,
But if yer the Gawd I takes yer for,
T e?ll see as my pal gets throo.

Parting Glances.
horgheus our weak effort this time for
the end is near.
Lieut. Jack Wiltshire is no* our Ad-
jutant. Bon.
For the first time in our memory the
battalion clinque is empty. ?Tis better
so.
For more than a fortnight the country-
side has worn a mantle of snow, ??Just a
a little thaw, then a little more.?
A record of one
years? active oper-
ations will be found
on page three.
Lieut. 0. M. El-
liott has left us to
take up some im-
portant position in
Angleterre.
A very excellent
photographic so u-
venir is on sale,
through Serg. Tom.
Hume.
At the educational classes at Rue the
boys are studying pretty hard.
S.M. Cox and Sammy Widdows, late of
us, are in a draft for home, resting at
Sutton Veny.
Four civilian deaths have taken place
since pur arrival in the village.
The customs of the people are naturally
strange to us.
The funeral services appear to be a
strange mixture of sorrow and glad-
ness.
Perhaps in their faith they believe the
deceased has gone to a better place.
We are a house divided. Scattered as
by the four winds.
B Coy?s last dance was a success. Much
sorrow among the madamoiselles.
Big things in the wind for the foot-
ballers. So ?tis said. A Paris trip, per-
haps, after the inter-division matches.
Lieut. Jack Phillips is in command,
and Mark McKenzie is the cuisinier.
The 2nd Division
are holding a second
big race meeting on
the course adjacent
to Charleroi cn an
early date.
Three erstwhile
N. C. O?s, viz., V.
Smith, Corke. and
F. Walters have
just returned as sub-
alterns.
Buy the illustrated
souvenir. It?s good.
We have come to the parting of the
ways.
W.O. Kilgour is still at Rue School, and
always gives the 23rd boys a great
reception.
General opinion. Gourdinnes is not a
patch on Nallines-Haies for comfort or
hospitality.
Q.M. Leo. Lamande is gallivanting in
the French capital.
Brussels seems to hold?a great charm for
both our officers and men. It certainly
has innumerable attractions.
Adieu!
Beaucoups, beaucoups deremerci-
ments aux bonnes gens de Nalinnes-
Haies pour toutes leurs bien veillances
envers nous pendant le temps que nous
avon ete ici en repos.
Ce sont les sinceres compliments
des officiers et des soldats du 23ieme
bataillon.
II n'est pas possible pour nous
d?oublier votre bonte ! !

Lady to Officer on leave; ? The hours

We have it on good aut^
Pte. Chas. Prior, late �t the canteen
staff, has succumbed to an at J ony
fluenza in England- i-d -- - -
of fate.
We believe that the canteen is to cease
its functions. Lieut. Bastow has been
in charge lately.
? Our rations are light, but our hearts
are still lighter ;
With visions of home, and prospects the
brighter.?
