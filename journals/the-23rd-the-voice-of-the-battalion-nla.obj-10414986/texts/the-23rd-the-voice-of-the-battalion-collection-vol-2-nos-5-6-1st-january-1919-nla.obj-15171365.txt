ROBERT MACTIER.
“ On the morning of the Ist September,
1918, during operation entailing capture
of Mt. St. Quentin, this man stands out
for the greatest bravery and devotion to
duty. Fifteen minutes before zero the
Battalion was unable to move on to its
jumping off trench. Two Bombing
Patrols had failed to clear the way.
Mactier, single handed and in daylight,
jumped out of the trench from the lead-
ing Company, rushed past the block,
closed with and killed the machine gun
garrison of eight men with his revolver
and bombs, throwing the enemy machine
gun over the parapet. He rushed for-
ward another 20 yards through a garri-
son of six men, who immediately sur-
rendered. Continuing to the next block
through the trench, the enemy gun here,
which had been firing on flank ad-
vancing troops, was swung on to him,
but he jumped out of the trench into
the open and disposed of this post and
gun crew by bombing them from the
rear. Before he could get into the
trench he was killed by an enemy
machine gun on flank at close range.
In the trench which Mactier rushed, 15
of the enemy were killed and 30 taken
prisoner. It was entirely due to this
man’s exceptional bravery and de-
termination that the Battalion was enab-
led to move on to its start trench mid
carry out the successful operation of
capturing Mt. St. Quentin a few hours
later.”

The terror and tumult of war hasceased,-
Life will be refashioned on those great

And we must honor the deeds of our
deathless ones.
Remember the blood of Australia’s sons.

Forward to Belgium.
0m November 2J2.nd we left our happy
home at Vaux-en- Amiens and began our
move forward into Belgium. It was
nearly a month before we arrived at
our destination—Nalinnes-Haies, about
ten kilos from the big town of Charleroi.
We went by train to Bertry, marching
from the station to Bohain. On Nov-
ember 26th we were at Souplet, where
Col. Braze nor rejoined the Battalion.
After a night at Favril we marched to
Rouge Croix on the 27th, a village near
Avesnes, which was at one time the
Headquarters of the German High
Command on the Western Front. In
this little village we settled down until
December 17th. It must be confessed
that the troops came very near to ex-
treme boredom during this spell. Con-
tinuous rain prevented football and
other sports, and the size of the place
permitted of no amusements to relieve
the monotony of the dull evenings.
Everybody was glad when we received
orders to move forward again on Decem-
ber 17th. We crossed the Belgian
border near Soirl-de-Chateau, where we
rested a night. On the 18th we were at
Renlies, marching on to Walcourt the
next day and reaching Haies on the
20th. The four days’ marching was
made under the most adverse conditions.
We started in rain and finished in rain.
With our waterproof capes over our
equipment, our hats turned down against
the rain, and our heads bent to the wind
;e matched doggedly on. Intent only
on escaping from the wet and cold. Our
instructions had been to march with
flags flying and all the “ swank pos-
sible, but they were sorry figures that
halted at the end of each day’s journey.
The interest of our move has been
that we have passed thro’ villages that
were held by the enemy for four years.
As the village folk made us welcome
round their fires in the evenings they
told us the trials of living under enemy
rule-. And they were governed with an
iron hand. At Bohain and Bertry we
heard the saddest tales, but as we went
towards the frontier they changed. And
in Belgium conditions were much im-
proved. The poor French peasants had
lost all their cattle, but here they have
not been robbed so thoroughly. Copper
and brass were always taken, even to
the door plates and window knobs. At
Renlies we learnt that the women were
assembled in the square and selected for
work at Cologne if they had no children
to look after. In fact, a trip to Cologne
seems to have been the fate of most
women. The children were frequently
sent into the woods to collect leaves
that formed the tobacco for German
soldiers. In several houses we found
packets of these dried leaves.
In Belgium we found every thing much
better. The houses are built of brick
with slate roofs, and have an air of com-
fort that we have not known since
leaving home. The price of butter, eggs,
etc., is very high, but the things can be
bought. The countryside has not the
desolate look of Northern France, where
a stray cow was the only sign of life
for miles around. And the people are
much happier. They have had their
hard times and do not love the Bosche,

but they have not been so badly treated.
The French villagers do not speak in
very friendly tones of the Belgians. At
Renlies they told us the Germans had
given stolen French cows to the Bel-
gians in exchange for a meal or a bed,
and that Belgians were trying to sell
them back to owners at abnormal prices.
But our experience has been one of ex-
traordinary kindness. In every town
and village we are welcomed with smiles
and greetings. If the cooker needs a
home and yon ask for a barn the owner
will turn out everything for its accom-
modation. And in the morning you find
the cooks installed in good rooms and
that they had hot coffee before getting
up in the morning ! Only tbe estaminets
charge for a cup of “ cafe ” ; from the
others it is a gift for “ notre camarade.”
Our few days in Haies promises a very
friendly relationship between the inhab-
itants and ourselves. No one is too
poor to do something for our comfort,
and many of the homes are very,
comfortable.
On Our Return.
Within a very few months a great, num-
ber of the battalj.cn will be returning to
their native land, and under tiie proposed
scheme of demobilisation their active con-
nection with the 23rd Battn. will immedi-
ately cease, but will the glorious memory
of a soldiers’ association with this service
unit for ever fade? No! I am sure
no member wishes that. Bather I feel
that each soldier of the battalion looks
forward to joining .some organisation that
will constitute a link between his career on
active service and that as a private citi-
zen. The nearer in kin that organisation
is to his old battalion tlie stronger the
bond of unity aud comradeship. This is
why I hope that all ranks will cu reach-
ing their sunny land take,immediate steps
to become members of the “23rd Battn.
Returned Soldiers’ Association ” now es-
tablished in Melbourne.
We have already in Australia an as-
sociation for returned soldiers, and vary-
ing reports haie been received as to its
character. Already sectarian and political
questions have caused strife. This is
where, a battalion association will gain
No such controversial questions would be
permitted, our objects’ being the reunion
in social and other benefits for battalion
members. By this and other similar in-
stitutions I believe more beneficial work
could be carried out under the various re-
patriation schemes. For example, such
an association, without going direct!j into
the political area, could greatly influence
any Government in power towards the
betterment of the conditions of those who
have fought for the Empire.
1 trust these few words will appeal to
every member of our battalion—and pro-
voke a thought as to which is the best
means of keeping alive the spirit of gpod
comradeship which has existed for so long.
There should not be one of us desirous of
sinking into nonentity, and I feel sure the
glorious record which the battalion has
built up during nearly four years of active
service can be perpetuated in the truest
spirit by an active membership of the
23rd Battalion Returned Soldiers’ Associ-
ation.--W.8., Lt. Col.

The Price.
Did you dream of the price you’d have
to pay,
On the day that you turned to war?
When your sons went out from your
sunny shores,
There were some would return no
more ?
When they took their place with the
rank and file
To fight in a living hell!
That the cheer you gave, and the glad
good-bye,
Were proving a last farewell.
Had you known of the price you’d have
to pay,
When you turned your face to the west,
Would you still have said to your sol-
diers—” Go !
“’Tis time that you stood the test!
“ Tis time to prove you’ve a part to play
” Where the blood of a nation’s shed ;
“ Though your bones may bleach on the
riven field
“ With the bones of the glorious
dead! ”
Did ever a thought of the fearful cost
Of a place on the stage of war
Across your mind for a moment flash,
Like light from an open door ?
Did ever you dream of the grief and pain
That you would be called to bear,
As the long years passed with the len-
th’ning lists
Of the men 1 gone west ’ out there ?
Yes! You counted the cost, and you
paid the price
In blood of the nation’s best:
In the aching heart and the stricken
soul
Of the mother whose son’s at rest:
In the weary wait, and the hopeless
wish
For the touch of a vanished hand : ’
In the hours you dream of those who
sleep
Afar in a foreign land !
Yet the thought may come to the aching
heart:
“ W as the price too great to pay ? ”
But the answer comes from the man
who died
For the sake of the golden day
When the angel Peace be o’er a stricken
land
Her healing wings should spread ;
And the cornfields wave by the lonely
graves,
Where the tide of* the war ran red;
“ There is never a price too great to pay
For a place on Freedom’s shield !
There is never a price too great to pay
For a place on Honor’s field!
In the shining days of the years to be,
These a place we died to earn
For you ! It is yours to have and hold,
Till the planets cease to turn! ”

Au Revoir.
OUR C.O.’s DEPARTURE.
That Col, Brazenor should leave us at
a time when we are enjoying the fruits
of our hard fighting is a bitter blow both
to himself and the battalion, All thro’
the hardships and heavy fighting of the
year he was constantly with us and did
not take his well-earned rest until we
moved back to Gappy after the capture
of Mont St. Quentin. Illness prevented
him from coming back until after the
Armistice was signed and we were going
forward to the Belgian frontier. He had
been with us a few days when influenza
sent him to bed. The doctors decided
that a cold northern winter was no cli-
mate for his weakened health and at
Boulogne-sur-ITe!fe he went back to Eng-
land with the probability of an early re-
turn to Australia. It has been his won-
derful spirit that has kept him with us
for so many months for his physique has
never been strong.
But he said in a recent letter that he
was very keen to be with the battalion
when it had no other worries than look-
ing forward to a return to Australia.
And it is peculiarly unfortunate that he
should be denied this happiness as the
reward for his loving care of the 23rd.
He left Australia in 1915 with the bat-
talion in charge of C Coy. After Pozi-
eres he became our C. 0., until illness
sent him to England at the end of the
year. Before the fighting at Ypres in
1917 he was back again, and has been
with us until illness has once again sent
him away. It was the very genuine
wish of everyone that he should be with
us until the battalion as a fighting unit
in the war had been disbanded.
The position of a battalion commander
is one of the most difficult in the army
to fill successfully. He has his orders
from the higher command and yet he is
in close touch with the men who have to
obey them. It calls for the qualities of
a fine soldier and the sympathies of a
man. He must have courage in the
field, an intimate knowledge of his work,
and the power of winning the affection
of his men. In all these our G.O. ex-
celled. In every action in the line he
gained his knowledge from personal re-
connaisance of the front trenches. When
he was in charge the men knew that
every detail would be thought of and
fitted into the organisation of the day.
it was a pleasure to sit in some little
dugout during some of our hardest
times and hear him arranging transport,
rations and hot meals with the Q.M.
and Transport Officer. His thoughts
came very quickly, were expressed very
concisely, and he forgot nothing. The
men who came out of the Mont St.
Quentin stunt will always rememberthe
hot porridge and tea they received at
Clery, the cocoa and biscuits that fol-
lowed an hour after from the Y.M.C.A.,
and the hot stew and tea that awaited
them before turning in for the night. It
was a fine bit of organisation deeply
appreciated by tired soldiers,
It was at Locre in November, 1917,
that the battalion reached its zenith in
vitality and fine spirit under our G.O.’s

Wally Summers.
We have had many sad events in our
battalion historv but none more poig-
nantly felt than the death of Lieut. W.
r , _ 0 . ,
O. Summers, M.C., on Saturday, Decern-
her 28th. That he should have come
away as an original member of the bat-
talion and survived all the dangers of
four years’warfare only to be killed by
the chance explosion of a nosecap is
,i f c *■
the very irony ot tate.
TT ... . , ,
He was a soldier of whom we have
, , , TT-
always been very proud. His quiet un-
assuming manner hid a wealth of fine
qualities that showed at their best when
front line work had to be done. A job
that Wally Summers had in hand was a
jbb that was certain to be well done, He
earned his decoration at Villers Breton-
neux on July 4th and his work on that
day typified all he did in the battalion-
Leading his platoon steadily forward he
occupied his objective and before the
morning was far advanced he sent a
nofce tQ hiB Coy commander that wire
was erected in front of his position. And
h e enclosed a map showing his exact
position. No bustle, no excitement, just
steady straightforward work well car-

He was buried in the little village

that. And although Australia has lost
a fin e soldier and a most excellent citizen
there is comfort in she thought that
Wally rests in an honoured grave far
though it be from his own home.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. R. MACTIER
WE, the Officers, K.C.O.s and Men of; B Coj. unite in
expressing the great honor and esteem in which your
son, Pte. Roht. Mactier, was hold during the time he
was associated with ns,
THE VICTORIA CROSS, the highest honor that the
Army can accord, is a telling tribute to the almost
unparalleled example of bravery performed, and to the
noble self-sacrifice made.
Pte, MACTIER, V.C., gave his own life, but by doing
so saved the lives of many of his comrades, and what
he accomplished at Mont St. Quentin contributed greatly
towards the ultimate success of the Battalion’s operations.
Here your son was honored by us as a man among
men, and those of us who are left will alwavs cherish
* • «
the memory of a fine character, and for duty well done
the example he set will never he forgotten.
We all sympathise with you in your great loss, which we
know you feel so much. Soon we expect to be back in
our ow'd homes in Australia, then some of us shall have
the opportunity of expressing what words we are unable to
convey.

watching care. It had come out to rest
from the severity of the Ypres-Brood-
seinde stunts. And in a very short
time it had gained its elasticity. When
the Brigade Sports Cup was won the
C.O. was pleased, but when the football
cup was claimed also after a wonderful
win against the 24th Battalion his joy
was complete. And the following day
he went for a month’s leave to England.
If the 23rd Battalion has earned its
fair reputation for fighting in this war a
great deal of the credit is due to Col.
Brazenor. He has been with us in our
greatest hardships and our greatest
triumphs, and nursed us back to health
in our hours of rest. That he is not
with us this Christmas is the deep regret
of every man in the unit. But we trust
to see him in Australia where he will
be assured of our continued affection
and regard.

havoc with the warriors’ hearts. Cpl.
Johnson added to the variety of the
evening with vocal items, W. Ledger
proved an efficient M.C., and the musical
arrangements were under the supervision
of L.-Cpl, R. Berndt. The tournament
was won by W. Tehan, D. Vogt being
second.

Our Christmas.
The Christmas dinners of 1917 were so
successful that it was decided to hold
similar celebrations in 1918 if conditions
permitted. And so when the battalion
settled into their new billets at Nalinn.es-
Haies mi December 20th the organisation
of the dinners became the work of the
moment. Lieut. Findlay had been busy
for seme weeks buying food in every
possible quarter. And his efforts.were so
successful that the Coys, had little more
to dp than draw their stuff from him, cook
it and carry on with the dinner. Bat-
talion Headquarters had generously given
Lt. Findlay a free hand in expenditure,
so that any cost over and above that
subscribed by the companies would be
defrayed from battalion funds. Such a
beginning promised well for everyone, and
it is generally agreed that if the dinners
last year were a success, those of this
year excelled them.
M. Piron. a resident of the village,
very kindly gave the use of a large room
and, indeed, assisted in a hundred ways in
securing a grand show for all companies.
That lie put us in the way of obtaining
the good' beer was no mean item. The
officers held the first dinner on Christmas
day. To run thro’the menu might he to
raise envious thoughts at home. It suf-
fices to say that turkey and plum pudding
were not lacking. It was a very excel-
lently cooked meal done under conditions
that would have sent an hotel chef mad.
There was keen regret expressed that
Lieut.-C®l. Brazenor should have again
missed enjoying the companionship of
those happy hours.
Headquarters Coy. held, their dinner on
tne next right. JL o be first is always a
disadvantage for there are many little
improvements made each time that make
for the smoother running of so large a
feast, lint there was in Headquarters men
who had no complaint, sojit can he taken
for granted that everything disappeared
like the proverbial hot cakes. Transport
followed with a turnout that hinted at a
very liberal use of their own transport in.
providing “ tucker.” It would be indis-
creet to question too closely the admirable
“ wine list.’ But it was lengthy enough
to loosen all tongues and persuade every-
one to enjoy a dance with the beauties of
the. village.
That D Coy. should have an equally
successful dinner was certain. Among
his many qualities as Coy. commander
Capt. Galbraith has the gift of happy
intercourse with all ranks. And it is
such a quality shows to perfection at Coy.
dinners. All present said that the dinner
went perfectly from beginning to end.
If there was any regret at the dinner held
by C Coy. it was that Capt. Addison had
gone away two days before. His quiet
geniality was missed by everyone. That
the football team had won a fine game
against the 24th Battalion in the afternoon
added to the jollity. And the Coy. began
its dinner with a toast to “ The Team.”
An old friend—member of the Coy., Cpl,
liomaine, brought two friends, who gave
a delightful concert. It is seldom in these
war conditions that we hear so fine a
tenor as Sapper Martin.

Our Christmas.
The dinner given by B Coy. might be
termed the swell event of the week. The
E acier had promised to be present,
and everyone was keyed up to their best
company manners. The dinner was
admirably organised. A very tine musi-
cal programme was given by a trio of
Belgian musicians. It v/as a novelty
very much appreciated. The Sergeants
of the battalion held their festivities on
Hew Year’s night. If the Sergeants
cannot get everything they want there
must be something wrong. So when you
read of “ I’eau de vie ” and turkey you
know somebody has been busy. It
would be so like the Sergeants to be
content with water. “A” Coy. came
last with a dinner that showed no lessen-
ing of interest or triumph. Major Pascoe
—■ baek that evening from leave —candid-
ly told a digger that he would be a fool
to be absent from the battalion when
such good things were going. And
Major Beith drew visions of banquets in
the Exhibition Building on Christmases
to come. Anyway we can be sure of
re-unions in the future and the organ-
isers—as Q.M.S. Lamande suggested
will have to go some if they wish to
beat the battalion Christmas dinners of
1918.
Our report would not be complete
without a few words for the cooks. It
appeared to be a mutual agreement that
one should help the other through the
Christmas ordeal, and loyally every
Coy. cuisinier stood by his compact.
There was Gpl. Holcroft, H.Q. offi-
cers; Ptes. Stobaus, B. McCourt and
W. Dale, H.Q.; Pte. S. Seyrrat, R. Tre-
wartha, S. Rivers, J. Henry, J. Rolan

Transport. The band gave musical
assistance. L.-Cpl. Reg. Berndt at the
piano, Ptes. H. Savage (violin), R. Baird
(cornet) made excellent melody at the
Sergeants’ function.
At the hands of Mdme. Balle, one of
the kindliest of the village folk, a number
of the band were regaled at a dainty
Hew Year tea. Typical French deli-
cacies comprised the bill of fare, and a
most enjoyable time, interpolated with
an exchange of the season’s compliments,
was spent.
The article headed “ Our Y.C.,” on the
front page, is the official account of the
winning of the decoration by the late
Pte. Robt. Mactier.
A light fall of snow occurred on
Christmas Eve, the first of the season,
and on Christmas morn the countryside
was clothed in a mantle of white typical
of this side of the world. Pte. Claus
was A.W.L. on this occasion.

Football.
BRIGADE CUP AGAIN WON.
January 4th dawned fine, but the 22nd
ground was very heavy. A large crowd
had assembled to see the match. Amongst
the onlookers were the Divisional Com-
mander and the Brigadier. All sorts of
units’ colors could also be seen. The
22nd turned out in force and kindly sent
along their band. The pace was solid
from the start. At half-time 24th had a
three point lead which they maintained
until the end of the third quarter. Our
backs were playing beautifully but the,
forwards’ kicking for goal was poor. The
•24th were showing good work around the
ruck. The last quarter opened up with
both sides '‘all in.” For some time
neither side could score ; at last the 24th
scored a goal, hut their triumph did not
last long, as we replied with one within a
few minutes. We still kept attacking,
but could only score behinds. Our op-
ponents crowded their back line in order
to try and smother us out. Excitement
was intense as point after point was
scored by us, until with only a few min-
utes left for play, we were still one point
behind. With a last determined effort
we attacked again. Down forward went
the hall, where Cameron, with a flying
leap over four 24th men, took a wonder-
ful mark, and kicked a goal. Then—
the whistle, and the old 23rd again won
the Brigade Cup.
It would he impossible to endeavor to
pick out our best players, as everyone in
the team was “ all out ” to win. Cameron,
though, must be specially mentioned, as
in every game we played in the competi-
tion he was an exponent of fine football,
and there is no doubt that he has the
making of a champion. As a team the
23rd deserved to win. The manner in
which every man entered into the spirit in
training, which was by no means light,
and taking into consideration the relative
number of shots, we would have been
unlucky to lose.
The final scores were :
23rd . sgls. 12bds.—42 pts,
24th . sgls. 7bds.— 37 pts.
After the game dinner was served up in
our billet, and many were the toasts and
songs. Speeches were made, and every-
one was proud ot having had the privi-
lege of carrying the brown and red
diamonds to victory in the last football
competition in the Brigade on active
service.
NOTES.
The second round ended with the 23rd
beating the 24th, which left these teams
level pegging on the premiership list.
This match was played on our ground,
and after a give and take game we ran
out winners by 13 points. Scores: 118
to 8.13.
The final game necessitated hard train-
on the part of both teams.
Our team, billeted together, was indeed
a happy family.

Battalion Organisation.
No. 2.--TRANSPORT
One of the most important branches
of the battalion is its transport, and a
few lines dealing with the organisation
and work in general will probably be
of interest.
The battalion left Australia with
transport consisting of nine C-.S. limbers,
one G.S. waggon, one water cart, and
one Maltese cart. The utility of such
transport to the battalion whilst training
in Egypt was very little, and when the
battalion moved to Gallipoli it was left
behind. This is not to be wondered at
when the front line was only 1,150 yards
from the beach, and the couniry con-
sisted of most rugged features. The
transport difficulties, however, were very
well overcome by the use of mules.
Whilst the battalion was in Gallipoli a
percentage of the transport, had their
fair share of active service conditions
by being attached to 10-th British Divi-
sion in Salonica, where they rendered
valuable service. About the end of
March a move was made to France, and
our Australian transport, which was by
no means as complete as the British
utilised iu France, was returned to Ord-
inance in Egypt. Our Australian-drawn
horses, harness and saddlery, however,
were taken to France, and immediately
on arrival at Abbeville the battalion was
issued with the following vehicles : ten
G.S. limbers for carrying machine guns.
S.A.A., bombs, signal equipment and
tools, described in official terms as the
echalon limbers. They had to be always
loaded to certain requirements in order
that if suddenly ordered into action the
battalion would have its supplies; two-
water carts, each capable of supplying
120 gallons, a most important adjunct to
the battalion; four cookers, one per Coy.,
each capable of cooking for about two
hundred men. The value of these
cookers cannot be too greatly eulogised
for the great work they have always
performed in feeding our troops; one
Maltese cart, which carries panniers
with the medical supplies; twelve
stretchers and other equipment; one
mess cart, which carries foodstuff and
cooking utensils for officers’ messes.
These eighteen vehicles complete oiu‘
vehicular transport known technically as
first line transport. Thirty-seven horses,
consisting of light and heavy draughts,
are used in these vehicles ; seven pack
horses, each carrying two boxes S.A.AT ;
eleven riding horses, distributed as fol-
lows : One eacli for C. 0,. second in Com-
mand, Adjt., Q.M., T.O , four-
Coy. Commanders, and one for Trans-
port Sergeant. Total number, with
spares—fifty-five horses.

The Skylark's Song.
As I sit in my dug-out, writing home,
The bullets like hail pepper down ;
The drone of the planes, like a million
bees,
Proclaim “something doing” around.
The guns thunder forth their hymn of
hate,
The shells plough the field for their
slain
When lo! in a lull I caught the song
Of a skylark arising again.
Oh ! How can you rise from that blood-
red field,
With a song that is sweet and clear,
As ever rose from dew-spangled flowers,
Or fields of ripening ear?
Above was composed by the wife of a member of the Battalion (Pte. Hill)
from a letter written by him.
Write home at once, or you will possibly he there first.
Are you glad the war-god holds carnival
there,
With death-dealing blows in his train ?
Oh! you cannot rejoice at the shattered
homes
And the brave hearts that mourn for
the slain !
Ah, no! methinks ’tis a true “Cheer-o”
To the lads in the trench over there ;
An earnest of Peace, a whisper of Hope,
Of courage to “ do ” or “ dare.”
Sing on, God’s messenger of holy cheer.
Though the sky be leaden and grey ;
The lads who are war-weary, worn and
sad,
Need the vision of a perfect day.
L. Hill, Blackburn.
