THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION J
YPRES � BROGDSEINDE.
No 21 15th AUGUST, 1918, Price, Ten Centimes.
HOPE.
*
? " Hope springs eternal," are the words
of one of our poets in effort to define that
extraordinary feeling of expectancy of
good things near at hand that takes
possession of one-even when clouds are
blackest and all is dark around. As we
enter the fifth year of this fight for the
freedom of peoples, our star, which until
two or three weeks ago, was (if we had
allowed ourselves to believe so) on tne
wane, is now brightly in the ascendant,
and our hearts leap at the propect of de-
velopments full of the promise of peace
and prosperity for all lands. The lead-
ing lights in the world of statesmen are
convinced that the victories of lecent
dates have brought peace nearer the sky-
line, and we, in common with the rest
of the fighters teel confident, although we
haven't yet succeeded?that the end
is nea-r.
AT SIX 808 A DAY.
?? ?-
We're the six bob a day tourists,
Launched on a world-wide tour;
E"o lighting did we want to do,
'Twas just the lucre lure.
We've been at Gallipoli, Ypres, and
Pozieres,
At Broodseinde and Bullecotirt sure ;
England's little island too,
Which makes us love her a!! the more
The gates of hell have opened wide.
A glimpse of that we've seen ;
Our blood flows red and our bones lay
bare
Wherever we have been.
'We're the six bob a day tourists,
Visiting our kith and kin.
There's another little place we'd like to
see ;
We're anxious to visit Berlin-


DEPARTURE OF THE PADRE.
�
Major Cleverden, the battalion padre
and spiritual adviser, left us a few days
ago after nineteen months' service with
the unit, wherein he succeeded that
beloved of the boys, Chaplain Bladen, in
January, 1917, at "C " Camp, Trones
Wood. His was a difficult succession,
following one who had become a veritable
father to us all. Padre Cleverden carried
on (his financial ability and management
of funds making him very valuable indeed
in canteen, Comforts Funds, and other
matters) until the granting of his Majority.
This was the hint that he would soon
leave for England. His loyalty to the
Battalion and his regard for its personnel
was undoubted, and in a few parting words
to the writer he remarked that he always
had and would still look upon it as his
military home, lie had found the officers
and men of the highest type in the A. 1,1,
To him it was the best unit. He was
proud to have belonged to it, and would
always cherish memories of the good-fel-
lowship, the comradeship, and the happy
times he had spent with it. He felt quite
sorry that lie could not take all to England
with him for a good spell, but perhaps
that would be hard to take ! At all
events the. Battalion would always have
premier place in his regards, and he would
watch it closely all the time, feeling con-
fident it would do deeds to make us all
proud.
The Padre, on leaving, wished the
Battalion, its officers, N.C.O.s and men
continued success, a long spell and a sale
return home, and would be glad to hear
from any of the boys at any time, and
would bespeak some measure of kindly
consideration for his successor, I adie
Jeffreys.
RUNNING SHOTS.
?
The late padre's English address is
Chaplain Cleverden, R.8.8.A., Heytes-
bury, Wilts.
Lieut. Dodgshun paddles Blighty wards
en fete.
A short school course is occupying
Lieut. Short's time just now.
Lieut. Holland has returned to the
fold.
In brief, the stunt, as far as we were
concerned, was a thorough success.
Further particulars later.
It was a plucky act of " Dan " the
other day, when two lads got out of their
depth while swimming, He took seri-
ously the calls for help, that others
thought were play, and succeeded in
bringing the pair to safety. Two was a
tough job and risky.
The following appeared in the Mel-
bourne papers: ?"Returned Soldiers,
23rd Battalion. A meeting of members
interested in forming a Social Club will
be held at Sargent's Cafe, Elizabeth
street, on Friday evening. Members de-
sirous of attending kindly notify
promptly.?R. F- Maberly Smith, 97
Elizabethistreet, City." Evidently "Mab"
still retains his interest in the old bat-
talion.
Says the "Herald" anent a recent
procession.'?"Special interest was cen-
tred in the returned members of the 6th
Brigade, who wore between their shoul-
ders the purple diamond that denotes the
award of the King's colors, being the
first of all the British fighting forces to
gain their objective in the attack on the
Hindenburg line at Bullecourt. lhe
award of the King s colors had i ot been
officially confirmed, but no one denies
that the men are heroes, and they were
treated to rousing volleys of applause."

STUNT INCIDENTS.
Hey, Presto ! We have stunted for the
umpteenth time- 1 and successfully too.
The weather is quite summery,.and is
just the thing for the work in hand.
It was the greatest, grandest, most
gorgeous, g?(enough adjectives) we
have yet been in.
Prisoners! ?There were "bags of 'em,"
as the Tommies say.
Short Huns, tall Huns, boys who were
hardly Huns at all. AU joined in the
march.
For days there was
a constant stream
of " butcher birds "
to Australian and
Canadian cages.
The boys marched
up, tanks rolled up,
the cavalry rounded
up, and the Huns
turned up.
There were some
grimly humorous in-
cidents during the
offensive-
Hun (to Australian
Private): "I am an
officer, my man."
Private (tearing off
distinction braid) :
" Not now, mate.
Fall in over there,
toute suite, stand
slack, and none o'
jrjar blankity-blank
fcack answers."
One austre high-grade officer, marching
in at the head of a column of captures,
looked the most indignant person writer
had ever seen. His headgear was gone
probably souvenired, and his bald
head scintillated in the sun.
One story is told of an N.C.O. starting
out with fifty prisoners, but before going
many kilos his responsibility had amoun-
ted to a hundred and fifty. The others
had joined in voluntarily out of funk
holes en route.
The cavalry.were
the recipients of
rousing cheers from
the Australians as
they i galloped -thro'
to muster.
The Bosche the
bayonet cowardly
shuns ; From glist-
ening steel he quick-
ly runs, Leaves am-
munition weighing
tons; Beaucoup pri-
s'oners, beaucoup
guns That's bow
they "fight" the
dirty " mongs."
The fear of the
tanks cause many a
Hun to lay down
his arms without an
effort of resistance.
The fear of the bay-
onet causes him to
squeal like others of
his progeny the
skunk. Comparison
hard on the skunk.

WIVES !
�
[Reprint from "Oriel" (Argus) after
the arrival of a shipload of wives from
England.]
Wives, wives, way for the wives - Let
down the gangways and bring forth your
wives. Wives from West Dorking, Car-
marthen and Ayr, Fond wives and fre-
ckled wives, wives dark and fair; Fat
wives and thin wives, wives saucy and
shy, Tall wives and small wives, and
wives n.e.i. Wives who would play
startled fawn to their hunters, Dull ones,
domestic ones, stop-outs and stunters;
Wives with bad tempers and wives hav-
ing none, Hair Marcel-waved or made up
in a bun ; Counting all classes and claim-
ing each creed, Wives built for comfort
and wives built for speed; Brown eyes
and blue eyes and eyes made of glass,
One or two widows (fair dinkum and
grass); Wives a bit dowdy and wives
a hit smart, Wives table d'hote, yes, and
wives a la carte; Big wives and little
wives, wives in outsizes, Precious few
blanks, but oh, plenty of prizes, All of
'em bound for the time of their lives-
Way for the Anzacs and Mesdames
Their Wives!
Down on the waterside there stand
arrayed, The patient platoons of the hus-
band's brigade, Adipose husbands and
husbands right lean. Fussy ones, cussy
ones, husbands serene ; husbands clean
shaven and husbands with whiskers,
Stodgy ones, podgy ones, fast ones and
friskers ; Some ot 'em eager to rise and
rejoice, Some a bib nervous to look at
their choice (For he who proposed on a
seat in the park, And gazed on his donah
while yef it was dark, May live to re-
mark when the sun starts to shine, " Good
gracious !" or something much worse?
"ls this mine'?" So they press in a
curious clamoring crowd, As close to the
gangway as they are allowed, Each
waiting and watching to spot his wife's
face (Like droyers out drafting their
sheep in the race). Pushing and shoving
he gallantly Strives To pick out the
winner from two-forty wives.
Sigh not, ye local young ladies, nor
sob, Complaining they've diddled you
out of your job, Greet not the fair
maidens who've capturecl your sparks
With lemon-faced glances or catty re-
marks. But brandish the olive branch,
let loose the dove, Remembering all's
fair in war and in love. The worrihn an
Anzac has claimed as his bride, Now
standeth as sister-in-laVf at yOar side
So "can " ail your cattiness, finish your
fuss, And let her remember shie's now
One of Us !
Wives, wives, welcome the wives.
Here's luck to Bill Anzac and all of his
wives!
PINCHED PARS.
#
Two suggestions, amongst many, for a
substitute for " Australasia " are ingen-
ious (says the " Bulletin.") R.A.M. pro-
poses " Auzealia." It allows the
Australian his " oss " (Auz) and doesn't
deprive the New Zealander of his "zeal."
Sam A. Browne wants " Austoria," the
first part of Aus-tralia and the last pari
of Ma-ori. However, " Anzalia " seems
to have met with general approval.
The joyous blue and gold of Austral skies
He bartered for a glorious name in
France ?;
With singing lips and steadfast, daunt-
less eyes
He died a hero in the Great Romancb.
And I am glad and proud as when he
left-
He cannot now of honor be bereft.

' HOME SWEET HOME."
4
How sweet are these words among
tire wide-spread people of the English
speaking world. How fondly memory
of "Home" lingers in the thoughts, be
it on boundless ocean or in foreign land.
To-the French the meaning is a hundred-
fold dearer, and the scenes as presented
in their earth-scarred, shattered, bleed-
ing land should be recorded to the
eternal shame of a vicious and inhuman
foe. Picture the humble habitations of
a thrifty, hard-working folk, cheerless
and deserted, In village and city. Once
cosy dwellings snuggling in picturesque
spots by riverside or in valley ; in ham-
let, on hillside, or by highway, where
nought reigned but peace, industry and
contentment. Built much more solid
and compact than in Australia, to con-
tend with sterner weather conditions,
they are certainly not so inviting as in
pur own fair land, and the interior is
somewhat cramped. The roofs are low,
and cooking and heating stove almost in
the centre of the room, with massive,
old-fashioned bedstead in the corner, and
generous proportioned sideboard, with
inevitable crucifix in globular glass en-
casing, and numerous dainty nic-nacs,
does not leave much spare room in the
limited space. But, nevertheless, it is
the dearly-loved home of the peasant or
artisan,.left to the tender mercies of all
and sundry, while the clash of arms
and the booming of the guns goes on.
But all are not deserted, e'en tho' the
screech of shell or crash of bomb
resounds around. There are many of the
old folks to whom the scenes of child-
hood and maturity are sweeter than life,
and should the scythe of devastation
sweep these from their sight, nothing
is left to make life worth living, as tho
aged " madam " will convey to you by-
language or sign, as you sip her coffee,
and she shuffles over the stone-flagged
floor or bends her silvery-locked bead
over the stove. " Monsieur " sits stolidly
in the corner, with folded arms and
vacant look, nodding now again, and
occasionally emitting "oui'oui" from
his toothless mouth and slowly shaking
his old grey head. They are explaining
that their sons are beyond recall, and
made the supreme sacrifice in defence
of their beloved country?and Tlome.
