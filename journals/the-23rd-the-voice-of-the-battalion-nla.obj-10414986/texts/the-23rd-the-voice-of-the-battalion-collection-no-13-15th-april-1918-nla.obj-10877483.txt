THE VOICE OF THE BATTALION j
No. 13. APRIL 15, 1918. Price, Ten Centimes.
TSE WAY OF WAS.
-?? ?-
Since last publication the venue of
operations has changed. A long, long
trek per motor lorry, train, and foot has
been accomplished successfully, although
it was a weary battalion when the first
part of the movement was completed.
It is just over eight months since saying
au revoir to this area, and, it is almost
safe to state candidly, wishing never to
again see it, except under peaceful
conditions. However, here we are again,
and it is not for us to reason why, but
to " carry on," adding leaf upon leaf to
the crown of laurels already won, and
making the Australian people prouder
and prouder of their young manhood in
so illustriously assisting the Motherland
in her hour of greatest need. "Carry
on," lads, Australia is watching you, and
holds hei head high amongst the nations
for what you have already accomplished.
It has often been said that it is a long
Jane that has no turning, and so far we
have trudged manfully along, and the
turning should not be so very far off
now. The indomitable spirit will help
us on the way, and when normal times
come back again we will look back and
say " Ours were deeds ?not words."
AN INVITATION.
?
Have you heard them drone in the crisp,
clear air,
When the day is calm and the weather
is fair ?
Have you seen them glide o'er the
enemy's lair,
Gracefully, the Battleplanes ?
Have you seen them soar in the cloud-
flecked sky,
Amid snowy fleece arid blue?ever so
high
Mastered by men afraid not to die,
The men and the Battleplanes ?
Have you heard the sound of spluttering
guns
Pouring wound and death on barbaric
Huns
Whom free men loathe?an honest nation
shuns ?
" Carry on," ye Battleplanes !
Have you seen spreading shrapnel burst-
ing around
In desperate attempt that billet may be
found,
To bring frail structures crashing to the
ground,
The Pilots and the Battleplanes ?
These sights you will see?these, and
many more
Amid the grim music of the cannon's
roar,
So come along and help them ?help them
win the war,
The heroes of the Battleplanes.


WHERE WE ARE.

IV.
Between two cities, the names of which
have been discussed broadcast throughout
the world. Billeted in almost deserted
villages, or bivouacing in woods. The
fighting force is well forward stemming
toe attempted rush of enemy hordes.
Theirs is not an enviable position, with
occasional weeping ? sky for roof, and the
soaking ploughed fields underfoot. Some-
times a ray of sunshine breaks through a
oarrage of murky, clouds, but not long
iiiough to warm, the atmosphere for any
ength of time. The night* are cold, and
-he little shelter afforded does not alleviate
he dampness of the air. But it is war-
;are?war to the bitter end?and valiant
learts cling staunchly in unison for the
;ommon cause, and thwart the designs of'
i cunning enemy. The ruined city in the
entre of the turmoil has borne the brunt
if clashing armies for years now, and was
.ot so long ago freed from the destructive
hell and bomb, but the vicissitudes of
ombat have decreed that it shall suffer
nee more the force of opposing armies.
?he peaceful villages of last year, which
estle on the outskirts, have been deserted
y most of the civilian population, although
here are some whose homes are dear to
hem, and refuse to leave, preferring to
rave the risks of stray shells sent on an
rrand of spiteful intimidation by enemy
>ng range guns.
There is also a wonderful display of
lilitary activity on highway and by road- <
de. Transports, mounted troops, infantry,
iove steadily and surely to positions 1
Hotted in the great game, and the organ-
sation of the various branches of the
service seems astounding to the layman.
It is certainly a gigantic undertaking, and
each individual has his task to perform, as
a cleat in the cog wheel of a huge machine.
Overhead aeroplanes glide hither and
thither, cleaving their way through the
air when conditions allow, and the swish-
ing or long-drawn sigh of shells inter-
mingle with the hum of the engines. A
loud explosion and a fountain of debris on
the right or left, as the case may be, de-
notes the arrival of a tabloid earthquake,
but as a rule they merely fall in ploughed
field or lonely wood. The enemy's objec-
tive remains well protected by this appar-
ently confused conglomeration, as he
knows by costly experience.
It is to be regretted that the hard labor
of the peasants during the winter months,
in the area of bloodshed, is to come to
nought. The result of their tilling, Fur-
rowing and sowing has been nipped in the
bud by merciless claws of the war monster
and they suffer silently and stoically for
their beloved country, in the full know-
ledge that there are others sacrificing
their all?life and limb?to the god of
wars.
AMBITION.
�
I'd love to paint some pictures of scenes
'midst battle's hell;
I d love to put on canvas deeds performed
'midst crash of shell.
I d love to forever perpetuate?if with
artistic gift endowed?'
The deeds of young Australia's lads in
sunshine and in cloud.
Of many hues, could I but choose, and
pictures true unfold,
My choice would be but only one?an
embellishment of gold ! ~"l>ad."

A LONG TREK.
A LONG THEE.
There is one redeeming feature in
moving. That is it is much more pleas-
urable when patches of blue are in the
sky, and the weather is fair, than when
mists hang heavily in a damp atmos-
phere, slushy roads are to be waded
along, and the keen chilly air penetrates
to the bone when necessary delays
occur.
Favorable conditions were with us in
the movement just completed, and al-
though tiring and trying at times, it was
accomplished successfully and without
mishap.
The first stage was from a compara-
tively quiet part-of the line, albeit lively
en.ough at times. On the way out there
were one or two narrow escapes, but
" all's well that ends well," and before
one o'clock on Tuesday morning the
battalion were resting in a half-ruined
town, some distance from the duckboards
and Fritz's " minneuwerfers.''
It was 11-30 the same morning when
we again got under way, this time per
motor lorry, and a delightful journey it
certainly proved to be, notwithstanding
the dusty roads. Magnificent scenery
was viewed as the motor climbed steep
hills or raced down the inclines. At
places could almost be seen the trenches
in the distance. There was also discern-
able in the clear atmosphere skeletons
of ragged walls and smokeless chimney
stacks of a large deserted city standing
gaunt and grim. When well away from
the scenes of destruction quaint villages
and old-fashioned towns are passed as
we whizz merrily along the highway.
Ploughed field,'sprouting with delight-
fully fresh greenness just peeping out
of the ground, and cultivated hillside
also appeared before the eye in beautiful
panorama. The sounds of the guns were
left far behind when the journey canae
to an end, and the Coys, were allotted to
billets in scattered farmhouses, where
peace and contentment reigned. It was
good to be among the simple, homely
tolk for a day, although our resting
place was but barnhouses and haylofts.
Well rested, another move was made,
per train for a change. It is probably
the first occasion we knew for certain
the area we were bound for. The far-
mers' dogs seemed to be barking it, the
farmyard cocks crowing it, the pigs
squealing it, and the young skylarks
singing it. " Furphies " were having a
well-earned rest, and hard facts stared
us in the face. However, we moved out
under an enveloping cloak ot darkness,
and most inspiriting was the march
through a fair-sized town. The band
was fresh, and in the inky blackness of
the night the crashing of the har-
monious brass instruments in the narrow
streets, confined by buildings on both
sides, aroused the martial spirit to the
highest pitch as the troops swung
steadily along.
An all night trip in covered trucks,,
with barely enough room to meditate,
was the next phase, and a nod or two
between the bumps (as only a French
enginedriver knows how to deal out
these bone-shaking operations) left us
at daj'break somewhat seedy, with that
washed-out feeling such as is felt in
civvy life the morning after the " annual
ball." Again the countryside is viewed
for five or six hours, and glimpses of big
towns in full industrial swing are ob-
tained. Eventually detraining,-the end
of another stage is reached with a gen-
eral sigh of relief, stiff limbs stretched
and loosened, and the body re-harnessed
with equipment, blanket and pack.
A refreshing panhiken of tea and a
snack awaits us in the village, and
after a spell a march is undertaken,
which is duly recorded on another page.

IN SHA'DQWLAND.
WEKEY-LIGHTS.
V
Not hard to take.?W.A.A.C.s. !
The question of the day.?Have you
got trie bread rash ?
We hear that one soldier has been dis-
charged because he had quite a lot of
'' asparagus " veins.
A paper says that the " elastic rooil "
spoken of by the Kaiser means that he has
lost the rubber.
The restrictions 011 such
as coal and gas in Eng-
land hardly allow a num-
ber of people to " keep the
home fires burning."
Her Majesty the Queen
recently fired one or two
shots at a factory during
some gun making cere-
monial. Her aim is not
quite as good as Fritz's,
for there appears to be no
hits recorded.
An Australian retort to
the American boast about
a wonderful new rifle.?
"Yes, but we've just got
one that the harder you
pull the trigger the fur-
ther the bullet goes."
The Second in Command is not a bit
" swank," and does not mind joining the
boys when bathing. He is a hefty indi-
vidual and proportionately b*ilt, but it was
with something of a shock, when attired as
Adam before Eve stole the apple, "one of
the boys" playfully dug a finger in his
ribs and ejaculated " Say, digger, bet
you're a cook !
Leave is cot half such a sweet thing as
it was. Two causes?i Fritz and the sugar
ration.
" Santoi," one of the transport horses
has passed to the Great Beyond, per
medium of a shell while on rationing duty
forward.
Congratulations to our little contempor-
ary, " The 22nd Echo,'' on its first two
issues. We welcome its entry into the
"inky way," and wish it every success.
Diamond Cut Diamond.
When our transport
officer "built up " a lame
horse for the purpose of
securing a sound one in
exchange, he was very
pleased when the deal
came off. Next day, how-
ever, his new moke broke
down. He had received
a Roland for his Oliver.
A new gun in the course
of construction is design-
ed not only to annihilate
those in the trenches, but
when a soldier is hit his
next of kin drop dead at
the same moment.
Jot that laughable in-
cident down and address
it to the Editor, " 23rd."
Potting Huns on the wing is the latest
recreation in the twilight." It is mostly
the twilight that is hit.
The world on me may darkly frown,
I do not care a " cuss,"
I love thee still, my Margarine,
For better or for " wuss."

The " Pip-Ess" had some revolver
practise the other night. Rain now
comes in through a hole in the roof.

" Kelly " is a soldier who thinks deep-
ly and long. While sleeping in a loft, it
was not until the tenth shell landed near
him that he decided to " coushy " on the
ground. It was too far to fall, he decided,
should he receive a direct
hit.
Exhibitions of diving have
been in vogue lately. A pro-
minent cornet soloist in the
band opened the programme
by taking a header into an un-
clean channel one night while
er- 1 resting. Ihe cornet
under his arm got very wet
and (to be continued).

Q.M. Assistant " Tiny " went one bet-
ter. While returning from the line he
rode the pack horse into a deep and
slimy trench, rudder skywards. In four
hours several units dug him out, and the
language was as lurid as the flares.

f A gracious act was that of
General Birdwood the other
day. While passing through
the detail billets he had his
car stopped and distributed a
bundle of papers, including
latest cables from Australia
A few members of the band
were the fortunate recipients.

"Bill," who distributes the

valise when assisting in load-
ing for the long journey. When
he at last managed to get it on

An N.C.O. '* out for experience" in

dier rushed madly ? for his " gaspirator "

denly woke up to the stunt. The amuse-
ment to the boys was great.

ON THE MARCH.
Much speculation is rife while a snack
and a spell is indulged in, as to the dis-
tance to be covered on the foot slog-
ging" caper. It is evidently a long,
long trail. The first intimation duly
arrives, and quickly spreads from man
to man. "Eighteen kilos.,, causes an
outburst of indignation and pent np
feelings, but there are optimists who
suggest that it must only be about five
kilos. However, the column forms up
and steps out briskly at the start with
the aid of the band. When getting on
the move minds are made up tor the
eighteen kilo stunt, and at
the first halt for a rest it
is positively asserted that
half the journey is com-
pleted, but on inquiries it
is found that not a quarter
of the distance is traversed-
When the packs become
heavy, the gait slow, and
limbs are beginning to creak
another halt is made, and it
is a common idea that we
are nearly "there," Fur-
ther inquiries elicit the
information that we have
probably been doing a two-step?one
forward and one backward-as our ob-
jective seems as far off as when a start
was made. However, a long tr idge
through village a id hamlet, on winding,
corkscrew roads, eventually comes to an
end towards eventide. A typical village
is the bivouacing point, where tired feet
are bathed and weary limbs rested for a
few hours. Daybreak'next morning sees
the previously quiet village dotted .with
khaki-clad figures moving briskly in
preparation for another day s march,
and before night falls the troops reach
a point from where operations can be
carried out in the serious manoevres.
HOSPITAL NOTES.
Pte. T. O'Connor writes to say that he
is in Blighty. Gassed and influenza was
his diagnosis. A lady doctor attepds him
and he says he has not been able to get
a word in for ten days.
Word has been received from Bruce
Godfrey that a successful operation was
performed in France. He has orders to
pack for a journey across the channel.
Lc-cpl. Hunter has also received a
buckshee trip to the Motherland where
he is doing well.
Sgt. Mounier only got as far as the
35th General Hospital, where he is mak-
ing good. He evidently did
not know the ropes for the
Blighty stunt.
W. O. Davis is at No. 40
Stationary Hospital- An
operation performed leaves
him weak enough to antici-
pate a long period away
from the battalion,
Sgt. J. Robertson has had
a relapse, and is now in the
clutches of bronchitis and
trench fever.
Pte. Geo. Gardiner is to
be boarded at an early date.
We .are led to believe that Pioneer
Tom Prentice has hopped off with a
Fritz bullet- 1 in his leg.
Let us know how your pal is. For the
sake of comradeship drop us a line as to
his whereabouts and condition. Address
it to Editor " 23rd."
"LEST WE FORGET."
Before leaving last area of operations
crosses were erected in memory of C.S.M.
J. W. Cox, Sgt. W.King,L.-cpl.l. Jones,

SOW TO WIN THE WAR.
By H. W. Gells.
As this subject is a deep one, it becomes
necessary to logically sift the question
from all points of view. Firstly, the in-
terrogation arises : " Are we at war ? "
Deductions from facts presented during
the last three and a half years convinces
us that such is the case. Were we not
at war most of the population of the world
would not be garbed in soldier's toggery,
nor woula nearly half the people on earth
be throwing bung-bungs, and such like, at
one another, while the others shy " gas "
shells. Thus it is clearly proved by this
simple process of reasoning that there IS
a war on.
The second phase asserts itself clearly
and plainly in the direct query Why
are we at war ? Is it because, or is it
becausen't ? " The average woman will
maintain it is because, but often enough
it is|found>that there are those of the
same sex who disagree, and stoutly stand
by their opinion that it is becausen't.
The man -in the street (or principally the
the man at the private bar) leels off rolls
of doubtful language, amongst which can
be heard such expressions as "the Huns,"
" We're winnin' easy," " L'yd George,"
etc., between drinks. When the point of
exhiliration is reached he demonstrates
how he would fight for his country, and
if he was there the whole thing would
have been settled, and the world at peace.
His head is too sore next morning to
think of volunteering, so we are left to
pursue our blundering way ?those who
are doing '* their bit." It is, of course,
necessary, in this brilliant article, to
dissect the question from all points of
view, so thus the " secondly " is disposed
of easily.
At the third stage the politician enters
the arena. He is stripped for combat in
loin cloth or leopard skin. (It would be
much better if he were dressed in khaki.)
He calls upon the people to stand back
to back, and listen to words of wisdom
as expounded by him. He glares fiercely
at the heckler who informs him that he
would be doing his country a turn by
having his brains boiled to supply the
country with food, thus saving some poor
sheep's life for a time.
Owing to the allotted space being
covered for this article, it must be con-
cluded in a nutshell. To "talk, talk,
talk," is the only way to win the war
?for the enemy.
