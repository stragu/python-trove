CHAPTER 1 : INTRODUCTION
Introduction
1.1 On 5 June 1991, the Senate established a Select Committee on
Superannuation to inquire into, and report on, a set of terms of reference
which was one of the most detailed and comprehensive ever given to a
Senate Committee.1 Since its appointment, the Committee has reported on
its 17 terms of reference according to five themes:
♦ the regulation of superannuation which was addressed in the
Committee's first report Safeguarding Super;
♦ the depth and breadth of superannuation coverage which was covered
in the second report, Super Guarantee Bills, and a background paper
titled Super System Survey;
♦ the impact of superannuation on the financial sector was covered in
the Committee's third report, Super and the Financial System, which
also addressed the problem of unfunded liabilities in public sector
superannuation;
♦ the taxation arrangements applying to superannuation and the
interaction of superannuation with social security was covered in the
Committee's fourth report, Super - Fiscal and Social Links. This
report also addressed the reference pertaining to vesting and
preservation of benefits and;
♦ fees, charges and commissions and their disclosure relating to the
provision of superannuation. This matter was addressed in a number
of reports and papers and the Committee's sixth report, Super - Fees,
Charges and Commissions which will be presented in June 1993.
1.2 Table 1.1 lists the Committee's reports and papers against the relevant
terms of reference.

Table 1.1
List of Committee Reports and Papers
The Committee has presented the following reports and papers to the Senate:
1.3 This report, the fifth report of the Committee, addresses the
superannuation supervisory levy and arose out of the following motion by
Senator Richard Alston, Deputy Chair of the Committee, in the Senate on
25 November 1992:
(1) That the provisions of Statutory Rule No. 283 of 1992, increasing the
Superannuation Supervisory Levy from $40 to $200 per $500 000 of assets
in superannuation funds be referred to the Select Committee on
Superannuation for inquiry and report on or before 14 March 1993.


(2) That the Committee makes recommendations on the appropriate future
levy mix on superannuation funds having regard to the particular needs
of smaller funds and the need for further increases in future years.
Conduct of the Inquiry
1.4 Following the despatch of more than 550 letters to those persons and
organisations on the Committee's list of submitters and interested persons,
22 written submissions were received on the supervisory levy reference.2 A
public hearing was held on 26 March 1993 in Canberra at which witnesses
from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Association of
Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) and the Life Insurance
Federation of Australia (LIFA) appeared.
1.5 In order to facilitate community discussion, the Committee agreed
that, unless otherwise ordered, written submissions would be published on
receipt. Likewise the Committee circulated uncorrected Hansard transcripts
as soon as they became available. References in the Report to oral
testimony are to page numbers in these uncorrected Hansard transcripts.
1.6 The calling of a general election meant that the Committee was
unable to present its report by the 14 March 1993 deadline. To this end the
Chairman wrote to the President of the Senate advising him of this difficulty.
On 13 May 1993 the Senate resolved that the Committee be reappointed
with terms of reference which included reporting on the supervisory levy.
1.7 The arrangements governing the supervisory levy are outlined at
Chapter 2 of this report. Chapter 3 examines the reasons for the increase
in the supervisory levy and canvasses the evidence received by the
Committee on the increase. Chapter 4 examines the implications of the user-
pays approach (including the nature of consultation with the industry) and
which parts of the costs of regulation should be recoverable through the
supervisory levy. The final chapter discusses the impact of the levy on small
and large funds, the impact of small and large funds on the costs of
regulation and the question of subsidisation.

CHAPTER 2 : OUTLINE OF
THE SUPERANNUATION
SUPERVISORY LEVY
Outline of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy
2.1 The superannuation supervisory levy is a tax on fund trustees the
purpose of which is to fund the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's
(ISC) supervision of the superannuation industry. It requires that a fund or
trust which lodges an annual return with the ISC is liable each year to pay
a levy which is graduated according to asset size. The levy has operated
since 1990/91 when it replaced a flat fee.
2.2 The superannuation supervisory levy is regulated by:
♦ Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991 (the'Levy Act');
♦ Superannuation Supervisory Levy Regulations (the 'Levy
Regulations'); and
♦ Part IIIAA of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987
(OSS Act).
In addition, the ISC issued ISC Circular No. 24 in September 1991 which
explains the operation of the levy (at that time) and provides useful
background information to its introduction.
2.3 For the purposes of the levy calculation, the assets of a fund are
defined in Regulation 4 as the net balance of the fund at the end of the
relevant year of income obtained from the audited accounts of the fund.
The exception to this is where the fund consists entirely of policies of life
insurance on the lives of individual members, in which case it is the amount
assessed by the insurer as the current value of those policies.
2.4 In addition to the basic levy amount, late lodgment and late payment
penalties are payable where applicable.


2.5 Pursuant to the High Court decision in Air Caledonie v
Commonwealth 3, the ISC operates on the assumption that the supervisory
levy is a tax.4 To satisfy section 55 of the Constitution the levy is imposed
by the Levy Act while liability is described by the abovementioned sections
of the OSS Act.
2.6 The Levy Act received Royal Assent on 20 May 1991 and has only
seven sections. Section 5 imposes the levy described by Part IIIAA of the
OSS Act. Section 6 describes the amount payable and limits the basic levy
amount at $30 000 for an annual return. Section 7 enables the making of
regulations but requires the Commissioner to consult ASFA, LIFA and such
other appropriate persons. The Superannuation Supervisory Regulations
(SR No 154 of 1991) were gazetted on 28 June 1991 and prescribed the levy
that was payable for funds when lodging their 1990/91 annual retuirn.
2.7 Prior to the supervisory levy, a fee was payable for the lodging of ISC
annual returns. For the 1987, 1988 and 1989 years the fee was set at $30.
The Treasurer announced in the 1990 Budget statement that the fee would
be replaced with a new levy of $40. Table 2.1 shows the scale of the levy for
the 1990/91 and 1991/92 years.5

Statutory Rules Nos 154 of 1991 and 283 of 1992.


Amounts Recovered
2.8 The levy is intended to recover fully the ISC's costs of supervising the
superannuation industry. In its first year of operation it was anticipated that
the levy would raise $7.0 million, however, only $6.2 million was raised. In
addition, the Occupational Superannuation Group of the ISC incurred costs
of $9.2 million, $3 million greater than anticipated. Thus the levy raised only
67.4 per cent of the operating costs of the group.6 Table 2.2 shows the costs
and revenues associated with superannuation supervision since the
establishment of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.7 The ISC's
budgeted outlays and revenue to be raised through the levy are outlined in
Chapter 3.

projected costs for 1991/92.

CHAPTER 3 :
THE LEVY AND ISC COSTS
The Levy and ISC Costs
3.1 This chapter examines the steep increase in the supervisory levy
payable with 1991/92 annual returns and outlines the ISC's budget for the
1992/93 year. Table 3.1 shows the manner in which Statutory Rule no. 283
of 1992 increased the basic rate of the levy.
TABLE at
SUPERANNUATION SUPERVISORY LEVY
1990/91 & 1991/92
3.2 The ISC estimates that $26.3 million will be required to recover the
full costs of superannuation supervision for 1992/93. In addition, certain
costs are not recovered by the ISC through the supervisory levy. These
include the costs of the ISC's role in administering the Superannuation
Guarantee Charge (SGC) scheme. A breakdown of ISC budgeted costs for
the 1992/93 year is provided at Table 3.2.

TABLE 3.2
The Need for Greater Regulation
3.3 The Committee's first report Safeguarding Super made 47
recommendations concerning the regulation of superannuation. The
Government responded to the Committee's report on 17 December 1992,
accepting 18 recommendations, partially accepting or accepting with
modification 16, deferring 4 and rejecting only 7. The reform process that
had been accelerated by the Committee was consummated in several pieces
of legislation introduced into the House of Representatives on 16 December
1992. This legislation followed the Treasurer's statement of 21 October 1992
- Strengthening Super Security. These bills were withdrawn pursuant to the
issuing of writs for the Federal Election of 13 March 1993. It is understood
that these bills will be reintroduced in the new Parliament.

3.4 The Committee reiterates its arguments for increased supervision of
superannuation funds. In Safeguarding Super, the Committee noted that
prudential supervision is necessary for a number of reasons. These are
reproduced at Table 3.3.
TABLE 3.3
THE NEED FOR SUPERVISION
The Cost of Regulation
3.5 The ISC asserted that there are essentially six components in the cost
of supervising the superannuation industry:
♦ examination of annual returns;
♦ recording of benefits received in order to determine whether they are
within the reasonable benefit limits (RBLs);
♦ technical correspondence on the operational standards and the RBLs,
determination of benefits in excess of the benefit limits, early release
of benefits and responding to appeals on the administration of the
standard and benefit limits;
♦ auditing of superannuation funds;


♦ provision of policy advice and management of the preparation of
legislation; and
♦ education of the industry and community at large.9
3.6 The ISC provided evidence which apportioned its recoverable costs
among ten different cost categories. This is shown at Table 3.4.
TABLE 3.4
ESTIMATED FUNCTIONAL SPLIT OF COSTS
3.7 The Committee recommended in its first report, Safeguarding Super,
that sufficient resources be made available to the ISC so it could discharge
its increased responsibilities as envisaged in that report.10 It also
recommended that an independent review of the ISC's resources be carried
out so that its resources are compatible with its increased regulatory
responsibilities. In that same recommendation, the Committee endorsed the
user-pays approach to funding for the increased responsibilities of the
ISC*
3.8 A joint review was undertaken by the Department of Finance and the
ISC of the ISC's resource needs for discharging its existing functions in an

li


adequate manner.12 This review was undertaken in 1992 and found that
an extra $4.2 million was required by the ISC for the 1992/93 year.13
Furthermore, the Government decided in August 1992 to establish an audit
and investigation program and to expand the inquiry service. This expansion
entails an extra 107 people and will also allow the ISC to open offices in
Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Perth and increase staff in Canberra,
Sydney and Melbourne. The total cost of salaries, establishment and
administration of these measures is expected to be $7.8 million for the
1992/93 year.14
3.9 The ISC provided supplementary evidence of the apportionment of
the ISC's budget among the various state offices and this is reproduced at
Table 3.5.15 While useful, a more accurate idea of underlying anticipated
costs would have been gained from three year forward estimates.
TABLE 3.5
NOTIONAL SPLIT OF RECOVERABLE COSTS BY STATE FOR 1992/93
Note : The above amounts were notionally assigned to the state
offices as an indication of costs recoverable through the
Superannuation Supervisory Levy. The split does not indicate full
cost attribution as in some cases it was either not sensible or
convenient to do so (e.g. last year's shortfall, corporate overheads
and property operating expenses).

Concern About Costs
3.10 There was understandable concern at the steep increase in the
levy.16 In addition to the Committee's evidence, the ISC advised that it had
received approximately 500 telephone complaints, 30 letters to the ISC and
117 Ministerial representations. 7
3.11 Those who raised their concerns with the Committee asked what
additional value superannuation funds could expect to receive from the
increased levy.18 While it is always difficult to quantify the direct benefit
that a fund receives from increased government regulation, the Committee
believes that the overall integrity in which the industry is perceived and
operates is sufficient indirect benefit for all superannuation funds.
3.12 Several submitters called for scrutiny of the ISC budget inferring that
it may have unnecessary items of expenditure or that the organisation could
operate more efficiently. Similarly the Motor Trades Association expressed
its dissatisfaction with the absence of any explanation as to the increased
costs of the ISC. The Life Insurance Federation of Australia (LIFA)
suggested that a detailed breakdown of how the annual budget is derived
including a breakdown of functions to be performed by additional staff
should be made available.19 The Committee notes that the ISC
Commissioner is required to consult with the industry before setting the
supervisory levy. The Committee also observes that LIFA is specifically
included in the consultation process by section 7(2) of the Levy Act. The
Committee will comment on the consultation process in Chapter 4.
3.13 Some witnesses wished to revisit the underlying policy requiring this
increase in resources.20 These witnesses questioned the level and

complexity of regulation or were concerned at the approach to supervision.
Regulation policy was dealt with in the first report of the Committee and is
beyond the scope of this report.
3.14 Concern was also raised at the manner in which the increase
apparently discriminated against small funds.21 The problem alluded to is
that the levy cannot be averaged over a number of members in a small fund.
The question of the impact on small funds of the supervisory levy is
addressed in Chapter 4.
3.15 The steep increase in the levy was another important issue raised in
a number of submissions.22 LIFA argued that increases of the order of 400
per cent should be spread over a number of years.23 The Committee
believes that increases in the levy should be gradual and will comment on
an appropriate strategy for this in Chapter 4.
3.16 Finally, LIFA argued that shortfalls should not be recovered in one
year.24 The Committee notes that the automatic inclusion of prior years'
surpluses or deficits can lead to large movements in the levy from year to
year. This was borne out in evidence to the Committee from representatives
of the ISC who suggested that they could be facing a surplus in the order
of $3 million to $8 million this year.25 Mr Ron Dean of the ISC said this
would seem to suggest that there would be scope for a reduction in the
levy. The amount of that reduction would depend on what surplus we
achieved this year ... [and] ... depend on the estimate of the number of
funds.26

CHAPTER 4 :
THE LEVY EXAMINED
The Levy Examined
4.1 This chapter examines two issues surrounding the supervisory levy.
First, the validity of the user-pays concept and the nature of the consultation
required by the legislation are examined. Second, the ISC's costs are
examined to determine what should be recouped through the supervisory
levy.
User-pays or Subvention?
4.2 The first issue to canvas, however, is the extent to which the ISC's
operations should be funded by the industry. It was noted in Chapter 2 that
the Government's policy is one of full cost recovery and it should be noted
that when the levy was introduced, the user-pays nature of the charge was
not subject to conjecture.27 The Committee in its first report, Safeguarding
Super, endorsed the 'user-pays concept as a means of supplementing
budgetary allocations'.28 It is now appropriate to revisit that opinion in
light of new and detailed evidence received.
4.3 At the time of introduction, the ISC's Circular No. 24 stated that:
In accordance with the user-pays principle, the Government believes that
it is fair that superannuation funds, and indirectly their members, should,
in future, bear the full cost of supervising their access to taxation
concessions, rather than having that cost borne by the general body of
taxpayers.29
4.4 ASFA suggested that there are two models that can be adopted in
considering the funding of any regulator:
♦ an 'independent regulator' approach whereby the paramount concern
is the actual and perceived independence of the regulator. This
27

28 Safeguarding Super, recommendation 4.2, p 41.

29


implies that there should be no say by the industry in the conduct of
the regulator and that the regulator should be funded by the
community at large; and
♦ the 'user-pays' approach. As ASFA stated 'this implies that the major
beneficiaries of the activities of the regulator are the funds and their
members and that they should therefore fund these activities'. ASFA
told the Committee that 'it also implies that those who are paying the
bills should have some say in how the regulator is run'.30
4.5 ASFA asserted that they 'do not believe it is possible to marry these
two approaches' and attempting to do so 'runs the risk of ending up with the
worst of both worlds'.31 This option is apparently favoured by the ALRC
which recommended that:
The regulator should be funded solely from Consolidated Revenue. The
funding should be fully independent of any levy that government may
choose to impose on the superannuation industry.32
4.6 The Committee received other evidence on the issue. The Life
Insurance Federation of Australia (LIFA) suggested that as we approach
universal superannuation coverage, a case could be made for all costs being
met from consolidated revenue.33 Similarly, the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (WA) suggested that as there is a public benefit side to
superannuation, the cost of supervision should be shared between the
industry and the community at large.34 On the subject of subvention due
to some amorphous global benefit, it should be noted that other industries,
including insurance, do not enjoy such a benefit. The Motor Trades
Association of Australia suggested that the ISC should be allowed to recoup
the 'reasonable costs of supervision and regulation of the industry'.35

4.7 The Committee in its first report recommended that 'a panel of
commissioners with proven expertise in superannuation from a wide cross-
section of the community' be constituted to 'give a greater degree of
statutory independence to the ISC'.36 This recommendation was rejected
by the Government.37 On the basis of the government response, and taking
into account the immutable nature of the levy, the Committee believes that
the industry and the ISC would benefit from formalised and constant
consultation within the current framework.
Consultation
4.8 Closely related to the user-pays question is the level and nature of
industry consultation that should accompany the funding of the ISC. The
ISC is required to subject itself to the 'full rigours of the budgetary process
and constraints' while also being required to consult with the industry under
the Levy Act.38 The ISC claimed it:
places a high priority on carrying out its administrative responsibilities in
a cost effective manner, and aims to keep the fees imposed on
superannuation funds as low as possible consistent with full cost
recovery.39
The ISC further claimed that:
The views of industry bodies on the ISC's operations also form part of the
discipline which ensures the most cost effective administration.40
4.9 Section 7(2) of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991
requires that the Commissioner consult with ASFA, LIFA and 'such other
persons as the Commissioner considers appropriate' before regulations
setting the levy are made. However, a failure to comply with this

requirement does not affect the validity of the regulations.41 The
Committee received evidence on this subject from both the ISC and industry
representatives.
4.10 The ISC gave evidence that the Institute of Actuaries have also been
involved in the consultation process.42 In addition, the ISC would in future
also invite the Chairman of the Joint Superannuation Committee of the
Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA) and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA) because the
members of those organisations are 'closely concerned with the management
of small funds'.43 The Committee is concerned that the approach to
consultation adopted by the ISC has been narrow. In addition, the ISC
should have consulted with representatives of small funds before the
arrangements contained in Statutory Rule No. 283 were struck.
Recommendation 4*1:
The Committee appreciates the move by the ISC to include the
Chairman of the Joint Superannuation Committee of the Australian .
Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Australia in its consultations on the
supervisory levy* The Committee recognises that the interests of small:
fund members will be best served by this initiative* The Committee
recommends that section 7(2) of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy
Act 1991 be amended accordingly*_ .
4.11 Mr Nick Stuparich of the ISC advised the Committee that the ISC
had consulted with ASFA, LIFA and the ICAA at various times during the
year:
In fact, the list of consultations shows that we had a preliminary meeting
on 4 December 1991 with those organisations. That was followed up on
41 Section 7(3), Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991.
42 SL Evidence, p 5.
SL Evidence, p 5.
43


24 January 1992 when a much smaller level of expenditure than turned
out to be the case was discussed with them.44
4.12 The ISC agreed to submit copies of correspondence and information
on the consultation process.45 In response to questioning from Senator
John Watson, Mr Stuparich asserted that the ISC had met the requirements
of section 7(2) of the Levy Act.46
4.13 ASFA submitted that:
The reality to date is that there have been extensive consultations on the
shape of the levy but very little consultation on the ISC's cost structure,
business plan, efficiency measures, etc.47
In oral evidence, Mr Scullin of ASFA added that:
I am not alleging a breach [of section 7(2)]. I am just saying that it is not
the way we thought it would operate.48
4.14 LIFA believed that:
These consultations have been conducted in good faith by the ISC.
However, their usefulness has been limited by the lack of information
which is sufficiently detailed and meaningful.49
4.15 Compounding those problems was the inappropriate timing of
meetings with the industry. Mr Colin Grenfell of ASFA stated 'we are
primarily being consulted after decisions have been made with the
Department of Finance'.50 He suggested that:

We could have regular, timed meetings throughout the year rather than
meetings which are timed after the dollars have been decided. If there
were, say, three meetings a year strategically placed, then we would have
more say in the development of the issues like new resources.51
4.16 On the basis of this evidence, there appears to be three problems, the
timing of the consultations, the lack of information provided to participants
and the nature of the 'consultation'. The Committee believes that there
should be some clarification of the requirements of the consultation process.
It seems that the ISC entered the consultation process with a pre-
determined view of the levy as opposed to trying to achieve a genuine
consensus. For such consultations to be of any worth they should be
conducted at appropriate, predetermined junctures, with sufficient
knowledge on both sides with due cognisance being made of industry
opinion.
4.17 The Committee believes that it is more appropriate for the industry
and the Commissioner to arrange their consultations, subject to the Levy
Act, rather than have such arrangements imposed on them. However, the
Committee observes that there has been some breakdown of communication
and is prepared to lay down some broad guidelines to which all parties
should adhere.
Cost of Regulation
4.18 The ISC provided evidence to the Committee that there are six main
elements in the cost of supervising the superannuation industry. These were
outlined in Chapter 3. However, the Committee believes that it does not
necessarily follow that because the ISC performs a particular function its
cost should be recouped through the supervisory levy. Indeed, the ISC
provided evidence that not all of its costs are recouped through the levy. In
particular, the ISC's costs associated with the Superannuation Guarantee
Charge scheme are not recoverable from the industry52 and in the past
costs associated with the establishment of the RBL regime were not
recovered.53

53 ISC Circular No 24, paragraph 16.


Recommendation 4.2;
The Committee is concerned that parties to the consultation process of
the supervsiory levy have differing expectations as to what that process
involves. The Committee recommends the following;
♦ that the ISC consult with industry representatives throughout the
year rather than after the resource needs of the ISC have been
decided with the Department of Finance;
♦ that the ISC consult with the industry on the way it will spend
money rather than just the way it is raised; .
♦ that the ISC provide the industry with budgets which dearly
indicate the expenditure priorities for the year in question; and
♦ that the ISC publish, as part of its annual report, a description of
the consultative process it followed in determining the supervisory
However, the Committee recognises that ultimately the ISC is the
industry regulator and, as such, the opinions of the industry should not
be binding on it.
Reasonable Benefit Limits
4.19 The Committee received evidence that certain other costs of the ISC
should not be recoverable from the superannuation industry.
4.20 The ISC is currently responsible for administering the RBL regime
although this function will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office
on 1 July 1994.54 The purpose of RBLs is to limit the tax concessional
benefit available to a fund member.55 When RBLs were introduced, a fund
breached the OSS Regulations if it paid a benefit in excess of a member's

RBL. At that time, the recording of information for this purpose was carried
out by the funds themselves. This was centralised within the ISC in 1990.
4.21 RBLs can be said to have both a tax and a compliance focus,
although since 1 July 1990 their tax focus predominates. Since that time,
members have been allowed to receive benefits in excess of their RBLs, with
the excess being taxed at marginal rates. In addition, such excess payments
now do not affect the complying status of a superannuation fund.
4.22 This begs the fundamental question of why the ISC monitors RBLs
and why is this cost being borne by fund members through the supervisory
levy. As mentioned earlier, the RBL function is being transferred shortly to
the ATO. The Committee notes that this not only reflects administrative
ease but also the true purpose of RBLs. This opinion is supported by
ASFA56and LIFA.57
Recommendation 4.3:
The Committee recommends that the costs associated with administering
the Reasonable Benefit limit regime not be recouped through the
supervisory levy. This cost should be borne by the Government,. as it will
be when it is transferred to the Australian Taxation Office.
Annual Returns Processing
4.23 The ISC provided evidence that the cost of processing an Annual
Return should be the same for each fund. In future, the cost of processing
an Annual Return should form a flat fee component of the levy. This would
simply be determined by dividing the total cost of Annual Returns
Processing by the estimated number of funds. The Committee notes that this
is essentially how the ISC apportions that cost.

Audit
4.24 The Committee notes that aside from annual returns processing and
the administration of the RBL regime, auditing accounts for almost 50 per
cent of the ISC's ongoing costs. The ISC provided details of its anticipated
audit program. Mr Stuparich stated that the ISC anticipated auditing 2 200
funds in 1993/94 along the following lines:
The breakdown is this: for funds with more than $10 million, we will audit
80 of those funds; between $1 million and $10 million, 175; and less than
$1 million, 1 960 funds. The breakdown is based on a frequency of audits
of the large funds of once every six years; the middle sized ones, once
every 14 years; and the small ones, once every 33 years.58
4.25 With respect to resources, Mr Stuparich added that:
The time we would expect to spend on doing those audits, using teams of
four people, is about 40 person days on the large funds, about half that
number of days on the middle sized funds and about four person days on
the small funds.59
4.26 The levels of staff involved with audits and their cost to the ISC was
not certain. An internal charge-out system was to be a method of
apportioning the costs attributable to small, medium and large funds.
Furthermore, the ISC added that it would be using the services of
commercial audit teams to train their staff and help plan their work.60
4.27 With respect to emphasis, Mr Stuparich said that 'we will be
concerned from a prudential point of view with the very large and the
middle sized funds'61 and that risk assessment methods will be used 'to
target both the large and the middle sized funds in particular'.62 Mr
Stuparich listed some of the indicators that the ISC would be looking for in
planning audit targets. These included commonality between employer and

ibid, p 24.
62


trustee, investments linked to the employer's industry and large
exposures.63
Policy and Legislation Costs
4.28 The Committee believes that there is some question as to the
appropriateness of the levy recouping these costs. ASFA suggested that
'costs of advising the Government on the development of retirement incomes
policy rather than the supervision of superannuation funds should be
excluded'.64
Other Functions
4.29 It was suggested that the following costs could also be excluded from
the supervisory levy calculations:
♦ preservation rules (and perhaps vesting);
♦ contribution limits;
♦ sole purpose test and investment restrictions aimed at protecting the
revenue; and
♦ third party information requirements.65
4.30 The important distinction that ASFA made is that:
If members do not stand to benefit from a regulatory requirement then
it is difficult to see why they should have to pay for the administration of
that requirement.66
Shortfalls
4.31 The Committee notes that shortfalls or surpluses appear to be
recouped or disbursed in the year after they are incurred. In particular, it
notes that the $3 million shortfall from last year has been automatically
included in this year's levy calculations. The ISC advised that it expected this
63
SL evidence, p 24.
64 SL sub no 21, p 4-5.
65 ASF A, SL sub no 21, p 5.
SL sub no 21, p 5.
66


year's surplus to be between $3 million and $8 million, thus possibly allowing
for a fall in the levy for next year. The Committee finds this a remarkable,
and totally avoidable, situation. The ISC should aim to smooth increases in
the levy where possible. The Levy Act does not prescribe what must be
included in the levy budget from year to year and this would appear to be
a matter determined by the ISC and the Department of Finance.
4.32 In addition, the Committee received evidence that a substantial part
of the shortfall related to the administration of the RBL regime. In
accordance with the Committee's above recommendation, those parts of the
shortfall attributable to non-recoupable costs should not be recouped.
4.33 The Committee considers that a better way of determining the levy
would be to use a more medium-term time frame. This might involve the
ISC and the industry reviewing the resource needs of the ISC over a three
to five year period and agreeing on an average for those years. This would
allow for greater certainty and planning on both sides and would permit
increases to be better managed.
The Committee recommends that an averaging approach be adopted
when setting the supervisory levy. This would prevent any large
fluctuations in the levy from year to year and provide certainty in
planning both in the ISC and the industry. _
Arriving at a levy formula
4.34 The levy is currently a mix of a flat fee and a fee based on asset
size.67 In ISC Circular No. 24, the ISC suggested that:
Perhaps, in theory, the most equitable basis for rescouping costs would be
a fee schedule with three components - a flat rate for each fund; a
component varying according to the size of membership of each fund; and
a further component varying according to the size of assets of each
fund.68
67 SL evidence, p 18.
ISC Circular No. 24, Attachment A, paragraph 8.
68


4.35 However, the ISC pointed out that:
As a practical matter, however, this would be too complicated and,
particularly as it would be reasonable to assume a correlation between
asset size and taxation concessions received, a flat fee plus a
supplementary component relating to asset size, with a maximum limit on
the total fee is a reasonable balance.69
4.36 The Committee received evidence that certain products will probably
require less ISC attention than others. In particular, Macquarie Bank
suggested that there are particular advantages associated with their personal
Approved Deposit Funds which will lessen the supervisory role of the
ISC.70 Similarly sentiments were expressed by Austrust & Executor
Trustee.71 In addition, it is likely, based on the audit strategy outlined
above, that public sector funds will require less attention than private sector
funds. It would be prima facie equitable to take these factors into account
in determining the supervisory levy.
4.37 However, an important point was made by Mr Stuparich of the ISC:
It is very difficult to set a levy which takes into account all of the different
interests and the different situations. To be able to set a levy which is
administratively manageable, it has to be an across-the-board type of levy,
and it is not really possible to tailor the levy.72
Levy by Number of Members
4.38 The Committee received some evidence advocating a levy on the basis
of the number of members in the fund.73 However, it is likely that these
witnesses thought the supervisory levy just covered the cost of processing
annual returns and that they misunderstood the full range of activities that
the ISC performs. It would appear from Table 5.7 that the only area where

Office, SL sub no 12.


costs can be directly attributable to fund membership is the administration
of RBLs. As the Committee recommended that these costs should not be
recovered through the supervisory levy, the Committee can see no reason
to set the fee on a per member basis.
Flat Fee Levy
4.39 The Committee received some evidence advocating a return to the
flat fee approach.74 This evidence mainly came from small fund members
who may not have been aware of the full range of activities that are
involved with prudential supervision or their cost.
The Committee believes that it is not in a position to recommend the
precise model which could be used to set future ISC supervisory levies,
however, the Committee does have recommendations on the broad
parameters which should underlie the levy setting process. In summary
the current formula based on a flat fee and a variable fee
dependant on asset size should be retained;
The costs of administering the RBL arrangements should not be
recouped through the supervisory levy;
the costs associated with the processing of annual returns should
be recouped through a flat fee per fund;
an attempt be made to identify the proportion of corporate
overhead costs attributable to other functions which are required
for prudential supervision; and
the costs associated with the development of policy and legislation
should not be recovered through the supervisory levy.

Recommendation 4.6:

and a variable fee dependant on asset size be retained._


CHAPTER 5 :
SMALL AND LARGE FUNDS
Small and Large Funds
5.1 This chapter examines the effect of the levy on small and large funds
and the costs to the ISC of supervising these funds. In addition, the issue of
cross-subsidisation between different funds is examined. To begin, the
demographics of the superannuation industry are examined. The
superannuation industry is unique as it has a large number of funds at one
end of the spectrum with few members and little total wealth while at the
other end, large funds with many members and much total wealth. There is
no evidence to suggest however that members of small funds are below-
average income earners or deserving of any special assistance.
Superannuation Fund Demographics
5.2 The ISC provided most helpful written evidence on the breakdown of
superannuation funds into size categories. In total, the ISC assumed that
there are 73 087 superannuation funds (public and private sector), approved
deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts for the supervisory levy
calculations. The break up is shown at Table 5.1.
TABLE 5.1 NUMBER OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS, ADFs and PSTS FOR 1992/9375
75 SL sub no 10, supplementary submission of 26 February 1993, Attachment A
(in camera).


Public Sector Funds
5.3 The ISC assumed that there are 158 public sector funds who would
be liable to pay the levy. These 158 funds control approximately $50.5 billion
in assets. Of those 158 funds, 33 have less than $1 million in assets each and
together have only $12 million in assets. Meanwhile, 33 funds have assets in
excess of $111.5 million each and together control $49.1 billion in assets. The
ISC did not provide evidence of the number of members in these public
sector schemes. An interesting question is whether public sector funds have
a constitutional duty to pay the levy. As the levy is quite clearly a tax, and
is based on the size of fund assets, it is arguable that it may be a breach of
section 114 of the Australian Constitution to impose it on State
superannuation schemes.76
5.4 Therefore, the Committee sought a submission from the Attorney
General's Department to clarify this point. In a submission which appears in
Appendix G, the Committee was advised that the subject of the tax, the
lodgement of a return, is unrelated to property and, therefore, it is likely
that the High Court would consider the tax as being a tax on actions
submitted to by funds which operate under the Occupational
Superannuation Standards Act 1987177
Private Sector Funds - Not all Assets in Life Insurance
5.5 The ISC assumed that there are 62 117 superannuation funds whose
assets are not all in life insurance and that these funds control $62.5 billion
and have 3.95 million members. Of these funds, 55 241 have less than
$500 000 in assets and these funds control only $6.3 million assets together
and have 659 026 members. In this class, the 81 largest funds control more
than $29 billion in assets and have 1.15 million members.
Private Sector Funds - All Assets in Life Insurance
5.6 The ISC assumed that there are 9 734 funds in this class and that
these funds control almost $57.5 billion in assets with 1.87 million members.
76 See generally, The State of South Australia & Anor v The Commonwealth of
Australia & Anor (1992), 105 CLR 171.
Attorney General's submission at Appendix G.
77


Of these funds, 9 248 have less than $500 000 in assets each, control $431
million in assets and have 21 555 members. There are 55 funds with more
than $100 million in assets each, controlling $54 billion in assets with 1.7
million members.
Approved Deposit Funds
5.7 The ISC assumed that there are 978 ADFs in existence controlling
$10.2 billion in assets and having 246 186 members. Of these funds, 748 have
less than $500 000 each, control only $144 million together and have 1 459
members. At the upper end, there are 16 ADFs with more than $100 million
each, controlling $8.17 billion together with 163 125 members.
5.8 The levy of $200 per $500 000 in assets has particular implications for
small funds. The ISC provided detailed evidence on the asset profiles of
small funds. Of particular interest is the fact that most funds have less than
$100 000 in assets. Table 5.2 shows the percentage of superannuation funds
that have less than $500 000 in assets that lodged returns for the 1990/91
year divided into asset size groups of $100 000.
TABLE 5.2
Funds with Less Than $500 000 in Assets
5.9 Table 5.3 shows the percentage of superannuation funds with between
$0 and $100 000 in assets for 1990/91 divided into asset groups of $20 000.
78
SL sub no 10, supplementary submission of 26 February 1993, Attachment B.


TABLE 53
Funds with Less Than $100 000 in Assets
* Funds that have $0 balances are mostly funds that have wound up during the
year of lodgement.
5.10 Table 5.3 is particularly illuminating in that it shows that, disregarding
funds with $0 balances, almost one quarter of superannuation funds have
assets of $40 000 or less. Table 5.4 shows the percentage of funds with
between $1 and $20 000 in assets for 1990/91 divided into asset groups of
$5 000.
TABLE 5.4
Funds with Less Than $20 000 in Assets
5.11 Table 5.4 shows that funds with assets of less than $20 000 are evenly
distributed among the $5 000 intervals.
5.12 The figures provided by the ISC on the asset profiles of small funds
are also enlightening. In particular, the revelation that approximately 75 per
cent of funds have assets of less than $200 000 and 57 per cent less than
$100 000. Furthermore, 25 per cent of funds have less than $40 000 in
assets.
Fund Rationalisation
5.13 Assessing the rate of fund rationalisation has proven difficult.79 The
ISC provided evidence that showed the decrease in numbers of funds
79
ISC, SL evidence, p 15.


lodging annual returns from 1986/87 to 4 February 1993. Chart 5.1 shows the
number of annual returns received for those years. It should be noted that
funds can still lodge for previous years, although the ISC expects the figures
for the 1986/87, 1987/88 and 1988/89 years to increase only marginally. As
the ISC stated, 'this chart clearly shows the effect of the rationalisation of
the superannuation industry'.80
5.14 Mr Ron Dean of the ISC stated that
There has been a significant downward trend from about 130 000 a few
years back to about half that number now.81
When asked for predictions of future numbers, he added that:
80 SL sub no 10, supplementary submission of 26 February 1993.
SL evidence, p 15.
81


there will be a continuation of the trend, but the actual rate - whether a
straight line or slightly curved - is very hard to predict.82
5.15 In setting the current levy, the ISC assumed a population of 73 000
funds, and allowed for an attrition of 8 000. However, half-way through the
lodgement cycle, the ISC had already received 42 000 annual returns which
'may suggest that the rate of rationalisation has slowed down'.83
5.16 Mr Brian Scullin of ASFA asserted that 'our own internal thinking is
that we believe the number is relatively stable at the moment'.84 However,
Mr Scullin foreshadowed that 'there will be another jolt with the
introduction of the prudential supervision measures'85 and then 'the next
jolt will be in 1995 when the in-house asset rules become fully operative'.86
5.17 Against this decrease in fund numbers, the ISC provided evidence
which indicated that 1 027 new funds were established between 1 July 1992
and 31 March 1993. Table 5.5 shows the state-by-state breakdown of this
new-fund growth.

85 ibid
86

5.18 It is difficult to explain the reason for this growth in funds but one
possible reason, in certain states at least, is the change to industrial
legislation in Victoria and New South Wales which allows greater freedom
of choice in member selection of superannuation fund.
The Cost to Small and Large Funds
5.19 The ISC provided the Committee with its models showing the levy
payable by different size funds. The evidence was given in camera so as not
to disclose the levy payable by certain funds. Table 5.6 however shows the
average cost of the levy on funds in the smallest and largest categories with
respect to the four classes of fund. Also shown are the membership and
assets of funds in those categories.
TABLE 5.6


Average Casts to Members of the Supervisory Levy
ADFs
The Effect of the Levy on Small Funds
5.20 The effect of the levy on small superanuation funds and ADFs is
significant.87 A fund with only $20 000 in assets will devote one per cent
of its wealth to the levy. Assuming a rate of return of 6 per cent per annum,
over 16 per cent of fund income is consumed by the supervisory levy. The
percentage is likely to be higher when one considers that many of these
funds would be new and contributions would be made throughout the year.
5.21 However, the effect of the levy on the rate of fund rationalisation is
not so clear. Prima facie, a 400 per cent rise in the levy would suggest a
large decrease in the number of small funds. But it is equally likely that fund
rationalisation is occuring for reasons other than the increased levy. Mr
Stuparich of the ISC said that:
Certainly the levy is a component of the costs which small funds would
take into account, but there are other expenditures that they have to
incur, particularly to meet the requirements under prudential supervision
and other supervisory costs which are far more significant than that.88
5.22 This opinion was shared by Mr Scullin of ASFA who said:
87
Bartier Perry Purcell, SL sub no 14.
SL evidence, p 17.
88


The levy is just one factor on the rationalisation of funds and not, in my
view, the largest. The compliance costs on funds are much larger than the
levy they pay to the ISC.
The Cost of Regulating Small and Large Funds
5.23 The ISC provided evidence of the proportion of the ISC's recoverable
costs attributable to the supervision of small funds. Table 5.7 sets out an
estimate of the costs attributable to certain identified functions which is
based partly on allocations and partly on judgments. Also shown are the
proportion of those costs which it appears reasonable to allocate to small
funds with the resulting total costs.
TABLE 5.7 Superannuation Supervisory Levy
Estimated Functional Split of Costs
and Assumed Allocation of Costs to Small Funds
89
SL evidence, p 38.


5.24 On the basis of ISC evidence, it would appear that the cost of
supervising 58 000 small funds is approximately $211 per fund ($12 232 800
divided by 58 OOO)90 although this is affected largely by the arbitrary equal
apportionment of $9.2 million of the ISC's costs. This cost compares to the
levy cost of $200 for those funds with assets less than $500 000. If the cost
of the levy to small funds is not contained there will be the potential to
drive small funds into master trust and other large fund arrangements.
Large Funds
5.25 As previously stated, the Levy Act prescribes a maximum fee of
$30 000 be imposed on trustees lodging annual returns. For the 1992/93
year, the levy is capped at $14 000 per fund. As such, funds with more than
$35 million in assets are only required to pay $14 000. The Committee notes
that around 340 superannuation funds and ADFs controlling over $102
billion in assets pay under $5 million for industry supervision i.e. 0.005 per
cent of their wealth. At the other end of the spectrum, over 65 000
superannuation funds and ADFs controlling only $7 billion in assets pay
over $13 million for industry supervision i.e. 0.2 per cent of their wealth.
5.26 Both ASFA and LIFA expressed concern at the maximum rising
above $10 000 per fund.91 The justification for this was provided by ASFA:
On what we understand to be ISC's average per person costs, a levy of
$10 000 implies a supervisory effort of more than one person day per
week - for large, but very straightforward funds, this level is clearly
beyond the ISC's current supervisory effort in relation to those funds.92
5.27 During debate on the Levy Bill in April 1991 Senator Richard Alston,
Deputy Chair of the Committee, said:
The Opposition will support each of these Bills, but we will be anxious to
ensure that the Government keeps its word: that it does not even
contemplate going beyond the indicative level of about $5 000 for large
funds without full and thorough consultation with the relevant industry
bodies.93

93


Subsidisation
5.28 Senator Alston's motion referring the supervisory levy to the
Committee specifically raises the question of cross-subsidies between larger
funds and small funds. There seems, however, to be confusion about
whether large funds are subsidising small funds or vice versa. On the basis
of the ISC's allocation to small funds it would appear that large funds are
subsidising small funds.94 This perception was also confirmed by ASFA,
LIFA, the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Australia Post
Superannuation Scheme and the NSW Cabinet Office.95 However, prior
to the introduction of the supervisory levy it was estimated that small funds
collectively paid in excess of 90 per cent of revenue but incurred
approximately half of the overall costs of supervision. Hence, small funds
were subsidising the larger funds.96
5.29 On the question of cross-subsidisation the views of ASFA provide
some guidance:
We are strongly of the view that there is nothing inherently deserving of
cross-subsidisation in small funds. I would suspect - I have no empirical
evidence - that members of small funds are usually much higher income
earners and have much higher net worths than members of some of the
very large funds. They tend to be driven by entrepreneurial individuals
who want to back their own investment judgment. You could not say they
are going to be below average income earners or some other reason
where they deserve to be cross-subsidised.97
5.30 Notwithstanding the fact that the levy is a tax and not a fee-for-
service, the ISC does 'as far as possible' set the scale of the levy to 'reflect
the actual costs of supervision of the relevant category of funds'.98 As
indicated in Chapter 3, there was particular concern on the part of some
94 see Table 5.7 and following paragraph.
95 SL sub no 21; SL sub no 17; SL Evidence, p 41; Motor Trades Association of
Australia, SL sub no 9; Australia Post Superannuation Scheme, SL sub no 8;

witnesses that they could not see any extra benefit in the 400 per cent
increase in the levy.
5.31 The visibility of service affects both ASFA and LIFA in their opinions
on the levy scale. As ASFA stated:
We believe it is incumbent on the Commission, if it considers that it is
costing more than $10 000 per annum to regulate a typical large fund, to
produce figures which demonstrate how it might cost more. In the
absence of such figures, it is difficult for trustees of large funds to view
the excess levy over say $10 000 as anything more than just another
tax.99
Recommendation 5,1:
The Committee recommends that cross-subsidisation between different
sized funds should be kept to a minimum.
Recommendation 52:
The Committee recommends that cognisance be had of the likely service
categories of funds would receive for the payment of the levy noting,
however, that the levy is a tax and not a fee-for-service.

TORNEY GENERAL’S DEPARTMENT
Office of General Counsel
OGC93456329
20 May 1993
Mr Richard Gilbert
Secretary
Select Committee on Superannuation
Australian Senate
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Mr Gilbert
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IMPOSITION OF SUPERANNUATION SUPERVISORY
LEVY ON STATE PUBLIC SECTOR SUPERANNUATION FUNDS
I refer to your letter dated 3 May 1993 seeking advice whether the superannuation
supervisory levy can be legally levied on State public sector superannuation funds and
approved deposit funds in the light of the High Court’s decision in South Australia v
Commonwealth (1992) 105 ALR 171. The Secretary has asked me to reply to you.
2. In this Department’s view, the levy may be legally imposed on State public sector
superannuation funds and approved deposit funds.
3. Section 5 of the Superannuation Levy Act 1991 imposes levy payable in accordance
with s. 15DA of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. Section 15DA of
the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 provides that trustees who lodge
certain annual returns under the Act (namely, returns as to satisfaction of conditions under
that Act) are liable to pay a levy on that lodgement. Levy is payable at the time of the
lodgement of a return (s. 15DB). The amount of the levy is calculated in accordance with
a formula set out in s. 6 of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act, the main operative
element of which is the ‘basic levy amount’ which is ascertained in accordance with
regulations made under that Act. Under the Superannuations Supervisory Levy
Regulations, the basic levy amount varies in certain circumstances, but is generally
calculated according to the assets of the levy payer, currently $200 for each $500,000, or
part of $500,000, of the assets of the levy payer, or $14,000, which ever is the lesser.
4. South Australia v The Commonwealth, of course, dealt with the application of s. 114
of the Constitution, which prohibits the imposition by the Commonwealth of any tax on
property of any kind belonging to a State. The High Court confirmed that a tax is properly
characterised, for the purposes of s. 114, as a tax on property if, and only if, it is imposed
upon a tax payer by reference to a relationship between the tax payer and the relevant
property and the relationship is such that the tax represents a tax on the ownership or
holding of the property in question (at p. 177). The Court also maintained the distinction
first made in the Steel Rails Case (1908) 5 CLR 818 between a tax on property and a tax
on transactions, but acknowledged that a tax framed as a tax on transactions may

nevertheless in some circumstances amount to a tax on property. This was ‘because the
prohibition contained in s. 114 is a matter of substance rather than of form and because a
tax imposed by reference to the ownership or holding of property may take the form of tax
on transactions’ (at p. 178). The Court in that case upheld the validity of a tax on income
(including interest) produced by property agreed to belong to a State but held as invalid a
tax on capital gains derived in respect of such property.
5. In relation to the superannuation supervisory levy, the question of the application of
s. 114 would, of course, only arise in so far as the trustees could be regarded as emanations
of a State and their assets were therefore property of the State. It is, however, reasonable
to assume that at least in some States this would be the case.
6. On its face, the levy is clearly open to the construction that it is a tax on a transaction
or action (ie. the lodgement of a return) rather than a tax on the assets held by the trustees.
On this construction, the reference to the assets of the levy payer in the legislation
functions merely as an element in the calculation of the amount of the levy. The method of
calculation of the amount of the levy nevertheless raises the possibility of an argument that
the levy is in substance a tax on the assets of the trustees. In this Department’s view,
however, this argument would be rejected by the High Court.
7. So far, the High Court, while acknowledging that s. 114 is concerned with substance
rather than form, has focused principally on the ostensible subject of a tax rather than on its
method of calculation. Thus where the ostensible subject of a tax, while not itself
ownership, is sufficiently related to ownership (eg. possession or use), the tax may be held
to be in substance a tax on ownership (see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v State Bank
of NSW (1992) 105 ALR 161). In the present case, the subject of the tax, the lodgement of
a return, is unrelated to property. In our view, despite its method of calculation, the High
Court would be likely to regard the tax as being essentially a tax on actions (ie. lodgements
of returns) by which funds submit themselves to the regime set out in the Occupational
Superannuation Standards Act 1987, a regime which enables them to qualify for tax
concessions if they satisfy the conditions set out in the Act.

advice.
