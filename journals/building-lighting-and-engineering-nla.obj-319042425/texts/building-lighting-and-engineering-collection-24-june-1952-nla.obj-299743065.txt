Anthony Horderns' huge office
Cuts NOISE with
CANE-ITE ACOUSTI-TILE
mm.
The Property Manager at Anthony
Horderns, Sydney, makes this state-
ment: “This vast office houses a big
staff and many business machines.
Noise has always been our biggest
problem. Now, this disturbing fac-
tor has practically been eliminated.
Cane-ite Acousti-Tile has done a
tremendous job for us
Thousands of noise traps to catch
disturbing noise that’s the scien-
tific secret of Cane-ite Acousti-Tile.
Each 12” square unit contains
484 holes which trap two-thirds of
noise as it hits the ceiling—prevents
it bouncing back.
Cane-ite Acousti-Tile is as quickly
and easily installed over existing
walls or ceilings as it is in new
construction. Ivory surface is re-
paintable when necessary without
loss of sound-absorbing efficiency.
You’ll find Cane-ite Acousti-Tile
in Government offices, banks,
churches, clubs, broadcasting
stations, hotel bars and telephone
booths throughout Australia.

You may say you’ve taken every precaution
against ordinary fire hazards. That you can
depend upon ‘fireproof’ construction.
Aren’t you over-confident? Human negli-
gence in one way or another continues to
be the greatest cause of fire. So-called ‘fire-
proof’ buildings continue to become furnaces
for inflammable contents.
What most people ignore is that, regard-
less of the cause of fire, regardless of the
building construction, it is the proper control
of fire from the first spark that constitutes
full and adequate protection against fire.
Grinnell is on guard 24 hours a day. It
kills fire, automatically, at its source.
You’re paying for Grinnell Protection
even if you haven’t got it. Insurance com*
panics allow a rebate of up to 50% on Fire
and Loss of Profits premiums where buildings
are Grinnell protected.

engineers will help you plan fire protection

THE OLYMPIC GAMES, MELBOURNE, 1956
ARCHITECTURAL COMPETITION ANNOUNCED.
It was announced by Mr. Eric Hughes, President of the Royal Vic-
torian Institute of Architects, in a luncheon address to members of the
N.S.W. Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, that an
Architectural Competition is to be held for the various construction works
necessary for the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne.
A Construction SußCommittee has been appointed to arrange the
competition for the main stadium to accommodate 125,000 on the site of
the present Carlton Oval. Assessors have been appointed and the details
will be announced very shortly so that an architect can be selected for
the work as soon as possible.
Our illustration shows a corner of the huge stadium built in Berlin
for the Games in 1937.

THE BYGONE DAYS OF MANSIONS
DIGNIFIED SYDNEY LUXURY HOME
THE FORMER WOOLCOTT FORBES LUXURY HOME.
This mansion, “Burnham Thorpe”, at Gordon, Sydney, fifteen
years ago was much in the news, for it was the luxury home erected
by that fantastic financier, J. Woolcott Forbes.
After it ceased to be used by its former occupier it was pur-
chased by the Red Cross in 1940 for, what today seems the paltry
sum, of £20,000. At present-day prices it would cost £50,000 to
£60,000 to erect.

SOUTH BRISBANE AUXILIARY HOSPITAL
NEW ACUTE BLOCK TO BE BUILT.
A £2,000,000 Project.
By F. O. NIXON.
“Man's inhumanity to man makes
countless thousands mourn” is a trite
indictment, handed down to us
through very many years, and though
inhumanity is not yet a spent force,
its mollification is tremendous.
Perhaps it would be hard to find
more striking evidence of the growth
of the human touch than in the pro-
vision of, and conduct of, our hos-
pitals for the physically and mentally
sick.
A striking example is the use of
the term “mentally sick” in place of
the opprobrious epithets that used to
be employed in references to our un-
fortunate fellow-men and women,
brain wracked by the stress of war
and war’s alarms, and by the general
strain of living.
While deploring the need for hos-
pitalisation—other than in maternity
hospitals—the attention which has
been given to the care of the sick,
despite the many frustrations to which
new building is now subject, the con-
struction of new hospitals in the
metropolis and in many other cities
and towns in Queensland goes on
almost continuously.
Not only has the largely-increasing
population been responsible for the
need, but the accident ratio, arising
from motor cars and motor cycles—
particularly the latter—has brought
forward a new “Juggernaut” whose
non-fatal victims come in daily, if not
hourly, for repairs.
If one were to blame the deficien-
cies of the Industrial Arbitration Act
for a large share of motor cycle acci-
dents, it would take a deal of reason-
ing, with the unthinking, to prove it.
Nevertheless, when attention is drawn
to the absence of a provision in the
Act empowering the Court to defer
part of the earnings of single male
employees of 17 years and upwards
before reaching a marriageable age
who have a superabundance of wages
to spend until they comply with the
tenor of the basic wage provided for
“the frugal needs of a man, his wife
and three children,” the analogy will
be obvious. Without so much money
to spend—or waste, rather—this mul-
titude of youthful irresponsibles would
be restrained, so that his deferred
earnings would be applied to his
potential family needs as the Act in-
tended. The high cost of living
(which follows the cost of high liv-
ins) would also be materially restrain-
ed, many will asree. But this by the
way, to try and reconcile the triumphs
of architecture, medicine, and surgery
with the still insatiable demand for
hospitalisation, which is not overtaken
despite the continuous building of
new hospitals.
It is probable that these unfor-
tunate facts suggested the name of the
hospital the subject of this article,
which is South Brisbane Auxiliary
Hospital New Acute Block.
The height of this building is 150
feet and cost is estimated at
=£1,750,000 to £2,000,000.
Extraordinarily, the foundations of
this building go down 40 feet, because
the coal measures of Ipswich, 24 miles
distant, were encountered and had to
be overcome. The foundation depths
of other buildings a few hundred
yards away are normal.
As its name implies, this new build-
ing is being erected primarily to pro-
vide accommodation and services for
acutely ill patients who are not ex-
pected to require hospital treatment
for a longer average period than 21
days.
THE NEW BRISBANE HOSPITAL.

The total number of in-patients to
be accommodated is 720, and, in ad-
dition, large Out-patients, Casualty.
Radiology and Physiotherapy Depart-
ments will be attached to this hospital.
The site is in the north-eastern
portion of the South Brisbane
Auxiliary Hospital grounds at Ipswich
Road, South Brisbane, and has a
gentle slope towards the north-east.
The building will be steel framed
and will have ten main floors, which
will be used as follows:
The Basement Floor will house the
main Kitchen, Staff Dining Rooms,
Staff Change Rooms, Stores, Plant
Rooms, etc., and, by taking advan-
tage of the natural slope of the site,
light and ventilation as well as access
at ground level are secured for this
floor.
The main entrance to the building
is at Ground Floor level from the
higher side of the site, and on this
floor are located Radiology and
Physiotherapy Departments in the
main building and Outpatients and
Casualty Departments in single-storey
wings. Business and Medical Adminis-
tration are on the Ist and 2nd floors
above the main entrance. An interest-
ing type of roof is to be provided
over these wings using normal saw-
tooth roof construction, but with the
risers facing north-east and with a
series of baffles at ceiling level which
will block direct sunlight yet allow
reflected ight and ventilation to reach
the rooms beneath.
The First to the Sixth Floors will
all be occupied by Public Wards, with
three nursing units to each floor, and
the Seventh Floor will be for Inter-
mediate Patients. All wards will have
access to cantilever baconies facing to
the north and east, the service rooms
being placed on the less advantageous
side of each floor.
The Eighth Poor is given over en-
tirely to Operating Theatres and their
ancillary units, including six operat-
ing theatres, a post-operative ward,
central sterilising room and Surgeons’
Change Rooms and Lounges, all plan-
ned on modern lines.
The central portion of the building
will extend upwards for a further
three floors in the form of a tower
and will house machinery and plant
rooms.
Externally the building will be
nnished with light-coloured brickwork
and emphasis will be placed on hori-
zontal lines by means of cantilever
balconies and continuous hoods over
the windows at each floor level.
Internally, the building will have a
hard-wearing finish with clean lines,
and equipment and fittings will be the
best and most up-to-date that can be
obtained.
A Pathology Block will be built
continguous with the Acute Block at
the south'eastern end and a Nurses’
Lecture Block on the north-western
end.
It is estimated that more than
3,200,000 bricks will be used, as well
as 18,500 cubic yards of concrete.
5000 tons of cement and 1400 tons of
reinforcing steel are being imported
for the project.

The Coventry Gauge & Tool Company (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
NEW PLANT AT BANKSTOWN, SYDNEY.
PRECISION MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT.
The advent of the Coventry Gauge
6? Tool Company to Australia brings
to the engineering industry of this
country an organisation of world'wide
renown for accuracy and precision in
tool and gauge work.
Company Founded in 1913.
It was almost forty years ago—in
1913 —just before the unknown fury
of total war was to burst upon com'
placent Britain, that the Coventry
Gauge Tool Company Limited was
founded in the world-famous centre
of Coventry by the late Sir Harry
Harley, C.B.E.
During World War I the Company
produced gauges and tools for muni-
tion production, and in the ten years
following World War I it developed
a large range of products to degrees
of accuracy hitherto considered im-
possible by industry.
The first of these was the now
famous Matrix Thread Grinders em-
bodying many new principles and
making possible for the first time the
economical grinding of screw threads,
whether for the toolroom or for the
production shop. Various types of
Matrix Thread Gauges also appeared
on the market, and it was not long
before the name Matrix became
synonymous with accuracy.
Considerable expansion followed,
and with the outbreak of World War
II the Company’s premises occupied
sixteen acres and employed about 1200
toolmakers and technicians.
Between 1938 and the end of World
War 11, the company produced 80 c /c
of all the gauges required for Britain’s
gigantic armament programme, to-
gether with thread grinding machines,
special purpose machine tools, jigs
and fixtures, broaches and hobs. In
addition, during this period the com-
pany controlled some eighteen disper-
sal factories throught the British Isles.
Sir Harry Harley
Visits Australia.
In October, 1947, the founder and
Chairman of Directors of the Com-
pany, the late Sir Harry Harley,
C.8.E., visited Australia to see for
himself the progress and potentialities
of Australian industry. He was ap-
parently satisfied with his examination
for on his next visit to this country
he purchased ten acres of land at
Bankstown with the object of establish-
lishing a factory to provide a similar
service in Australia to that which the
parent company had so efficiently ren-
dered to industry in Britain over the
past forty years.
The new company, “Coventry Gauge
& Tool Company (Aust.) Pty. Limit-
ed,” was duly formed with a nominal
capital of £200,000 (increased later to
£500,000), the capital being sup-
scribed by the parent company in
Coventry and by William Adams it
Company Limited.
New Plant Planned.
Preparations were immediately put
in hand to design and construct a
modern factory—a specialised toolroom
—which would be sufficiently equipped
to produce jigs, fixtures, tools and
gauges which manufacturing industries
must have in order to quickly and
efficiently get into production.
Mr. Jack Piggott was appointed
General Manager and he spent six
months with the parent company at
Coventry, studying the design of the
plant, selecting machine tools and
measuring equipment, and making a
study of the company’s well-proven
methods.
A number of key personnel were
also brought out from the English
factories in order to further ensure
that the high standard insisted upon
by themselves be maintained in Aus-
tralia.
The New Plant.
The site, which is of ten acres,
fronts Canterbury Road on which the

main entrance is located, while the
heavy goods access is from Mavis
Street.
The three main units in the plant
consist of the Main Factory with an
area of 17,000 sq. ft.; the Heat Treat-
ment and Steel Storage Building, 4000
sq. ft., and the Power House, 1000
sq. ft.
In the design of this new unit in
the Antipodes no effort or expense has
been spared to secure the very latest
in buildings, plant and equipment, and
the executive are indeed well satisfied
with the results that have been
achieved, for the period of construc-
tion has been one that has seen the
greatest shortage of materials and
labour—to say nothing of high build-
ing costs —that this country has ever
experienced.
The main factory building is of steel-
frame construction with brick external
walls and has the unusual height of
twenty feet from floor to ceiling. The
whole of the interior at tie-beam level
of the saw-tooth trusses is ceiled with
caneite finished white, which thus
gives perfect natural lighting and at
the same time provides excellent in-
sulation.
The floor throughout both the office
and factory consists of Sin. rock bal-
last upon which is superimposed 6in.
of reinforced concrete, on top of
which is a floor of tallow-wood par-
quetry. Such a floor is unusual for
an industrial plant of this type, but is
of considerable importance for it prac-
tically eliminates dust and also mini-
mises fatigue amongst employees and
likewise reduces the risk of breakage
should work of valuable equipment ne
dropped.
Inspection, Metrology
and Jig Borer Rooms.
Separating the front office (which
includes the Drawing Office) from the
Machine Shop are three temperature-
controlled rooms, the construction of
which is of double glass, together with
wood and caneite insulation.
These rooms, designated respective-
ly Inspection, Metrology and Jig Bor-
ing, are maintained to the prescribed
International Standard Temperature
for precise measurement, namely, 68
degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Centi-
grade).
Further to this, the air inside these
rooms is carefully filtered to exclude
all dust, and the percentage relative
humidity is controlled to 60% maxi-
mum.
The control plant and the installa-
tion of these special rooms has been
expensive, and the Coventry Gauge
& Tool Company (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. is
the first commercial organisation in
Australia to install and use such con-
trol for its products. Only the plant
of the National Standards Laboratory
of Australia exceeds it in size and
degree of control.
In view of the present-day demands
for increased accuracy, however, it is
essential to have such control in order
to safeguard against errors due to un-
equal contraction or expansion. Such
temperature control equipment is cost-
ly, but vital.
The Company is therefore in a
position to maintain, ready for instant
use, calibrated secondary standards at
the prescribed international tempera'
ture of 68 degrees F. (20 degrees C.),
thereby facilitating the precise check-
ing or setting of the. measuring equip-

ment used to inspect their products.
Of particular interest in the Met-
rology Room is a 3ft. square reinforced
concrete column which projects some
Bft. above floor level and whose base,
resting upon solid shale, is approxi-
mately Bft. below the floor. This
column is completely isolated from the
floor, the object being to prevent
vibration from any other part of the
works affecting the sensitive measur-
ing equipment mounted thereon.
Valuable Measuring
Equipment,
When it is realised that comparative
measurements to the order of .000005
(five-millionth’s of an inch) will be
undertaken, the need for such a foun-
dation for these instruments becomes
apparent. A girl leaning against this
column can cause deflection of the
concrete measurable to a few mil'
lionths of an inch by one of the
special bubble comparators used for
the calibration of slip gauges.
A further item of interest is the
Taylor Hobson 200 in. Projector used
to measure profiles. This instrument is
the finest of its type in the world
tO'day.
Other items of equipment in these
rooms include a Matrix Optical Divid'
ing Head, Matrix Eden Millionth
Comparator, Matrix Internal
Diameter Measuring Machine, a Mat'
rix Pitch Measuring Machine and
numerous other items of Matrix
measuring equipment, including slip
gauges, etc.
In the Jig Borer Room is a Matrix
Optical Jig Boring Machine, all move'
ments of the table being measured by
an optical scale. This is the first op'
tical jig borer produced in the English'
speaking world. Other machines of
this type were and are being produced
in Switzerland and Germany.
The Machine Shop.
The natural lighting in the spacious
Machine Shop is extremely good, part'
ly because of the high sawtooth roof
and the white-painted caneite ceiling
and also because of the colour scheme
selected. The colours throughout have
been chosen with the object of easing
the strain on the employees’ eyesight,
and this colour scheme has been applied
not only to the actual building, but to
benches, furniture and fittings through'
out the factory.
In order to provide the best pos'
sible artificial lighting, tubular fluores'
cent fittings have been installed
throughout the factory.
Modern Plant.
The modern Machine Shop plant in'
eludes the following items of special
interest: —
(1) A large Craven Planing
Machine with a work capacity of 4ft.
x 4ft. x 16ft., which rests on a rein'
forced concrete foundation 6ft. under
floor level and which weighs approxi'
mately 70 tons. Specially designed ad'
justable slippers are provided under'
neath this machine so that an unusual'
ly precise levelling can be accomplished
and periodically maintained.
(2) Cylindrical Grinding from the
largest a Precimax with a work
capacity of 15in. diameter by 72in.
l on g to the smallest cylindrical
grinder of Sin. diameter by 12in. long
work capacity. This latter machine has
been constructed specially for the pur'
pose of accurately grinding gauges to
a finish of less than 1 “micro” inch,
or in other words, a roughness average
measure of approximately 1,000,000

of an inch. This is accomplished
straight from the grinding wheel with-
out having recourse to lapping.
In order to keep vibration away
from this small machine, a specially
isolated concrete foundation has been
constructed, the bottom of which rests
on solid shale 7ft. under the floor
level, whilst the sides are clear of and
do not touch the floor. To further
minimise vibration, all electric motors
have been removed from the machine,
these being mounted upon a special
framework adjacent to the machine,
and connected to the machine by
means of belts.
(3) A Wickham Optical Form
Grinding machine capable of grinding
to close accuracy a regular or an
irregular form, whether on a gauge
or a tool.
(4) Matrix Universal Thread Grind-
ing machines embodying the well-
known and patented Matrix Diamond
Wheel dressing device and other
special features.
A five-ton capacity three-motored
travelling crane is installed in one of
the Machine Shop bays and serves
large capacity machines.
At a convenient point is a special
“Protective Dipping Room.” In this
room is a tank containing plastic wax,
and the finished products before being
despatched are carefully dipped, thus
protecting against accidental damage
and also against rust.
Heat Treatment.
A modern and fully-equipped Heat
Treatment Department forms part of
the plant and is designed to cater for
a wide range of work, such as harden-
ing, tempering, carburising, annealing,
spheroidising, normalising, stress-
relieving and stabilising of tools,
gauges and all types of general work.
Feature of this modern plant in-
clude—
Salt bath heat treatment of high
speed steel, including nitriding.
Salt bath heat treatment of all classes
of tool steels.
Martempering of alloy tool steels.
Austempering.
Liquid and pack carburising.
Testing of bar samples for your
protection.
Accurate hardness testing equip-
ment.
Sand blast finish if required.
All furnaces equipped with Auto-
matic, Pyrometrical Control.
Power House.
In view of the present uncertainties
with power supply and to implement
the Company’s desire to maintain full
continuity of employment and to main-
tain deliveries to their clients, it was
decided at an early stage to install an
auxiliary power plant, and included in
the Power House are the following:—
500 K.V.A. Transformer.
Main Switch Board.
Petters Brush Diesel Alternator, 340
K.V.A.
Hot Water Boiler, for heating main
factory and also for maintaining
humidity control in Metrology
Rooms.
Compressed Air Unit.
To further ensure the comfort of
its employees, the most modern ameni'
ties in all respects have been installed.
Opening off from the factory floor
area are locker-rooms with individual
steel lockers, shower and washrooms
with hot and cold water, modern
toilets, plus a rest-room and First Aid
room.
Those professionally associated with
the new plant were as follows; —

A new type of cathode ray tube,
908 C.A.R.A., is announced by The
General Electric Co. Ltd., for use in
high speed oscillography. The tube,
which utilises electrostatic focussing
and deflection, has a 9 cm. diameter
flat'faced screen coated with a highly
actinic powder giving a blue fluor'
escence.
One stage of post'deflection acceh
eration is employed, which enables
the beam to be accelerated after the
main deflection has taken place. Con'
nections to the front plates are
brought out of the envelope via side
arms, whilst the connections to the
back plates and the third anode are
taken through the base.
The operating conditions of the
new tube, 908 C.A.R.A., are as
follows:

CHAOS AT THE QUAY
RAIL LINK PROMISED IN TWO YEARS.
Then: Order, Safety, Swift Transport.
“You won’t recognise Circular Quay
in two years,” a transport official told
“ Building: Lighting: Engineering ”
last week. , €■'{
“It will be orderly, safe, the hub of
swift transport to all parts of Sydney
“That is ... er . . . most parts,”
he added.
At the moment i: is very hard to
imagine such a promise coming true.
The Quay presents to'day the greatest
example of man-made chaos in Aus-
tralia, and perhaps the greatest in-
stance of official disregard for the
rights of pedestrians and citizens whose
money has been lying idle for years in
ineffective, unproductive work.
But that is nothing new for Sydney-
siders, who are used to living dan-
gerously, anyway, and a few more
hazards here or there just add to the
spice of existence.
Open In Two Years.
Work is proceeding apace on the
new Quay railway station, which will
connect Wynyard and St. James un-
derground stations within two years.
However, the overhead carriageway,
which will form the roof of the station
and a new traffic highway between the
Harbour Bridge and the eastern
suburbs, may not be completed by
then.
It will possibly be constructed after
the trains commence running, which
will add to the difficulties of the job.
Official instructions have been issued
to proceed “flat out” on the construe'
tion of the Quay station, despite the
cut'back in State public works, and the
Quay is a scene of great activity—and
chaos, as ferry travellers dodge cranes
and trucks, and all the impedimentia
of a rush building job. Access to the
ferry wharves is now adventurous and
difficult, as travellers are forced to take
a more roundabout path than hitherto.
However, it is believed that the
Quay railway stands a more reasonable
chance of reaching completion in two
years than at any period since the first
concrete foundation was poured in
1937—0 r perhaps since some forgotten
stonemason chiselled 1918 on the pot'
tal of the Macquarie Street tunnel.
We sincerely hope the Government’s
desire to carry out this worthy objec'
tive in two years will meet with sue'
cess. When a section of Warragamba
had to be finished in two years, the
workmen said; “Not if we know any'
thing about it; five or six years will
be nearer the mark.”
Kev to the Quay.
The new station is intended to assist
in the co-ord.nation of all forms of
traffic, and it is considered that rail
facilities at the Quay, plus the project'
ed overhead highway, may well be the
key to many of Sydney’s transport
problems.
“However, the station will be the
key to really open up the Quay,” said
an official, in explaining some of the
current difficulties.
Simplified Design.
For years various fac ions fought
wordy battles over the ultimate design
for the station, and the recent “unani-
mous” decision on the design of a
purely functional station is believed
to be the final one.
Unanimity is excellent, even if it is
only onesided, and it is well-known
that State Cabinet decided the final
design against the advice of experts
in the architectural and engineering
fields. Following that, ex-Premier
McGirr announced that “everybody”
approved and praised the design final'
ly adopted.
Whether it will grace—or disgrace
—the Quay remains to be seen.
Essential Link.
Be that as it may, the new railway
will form an essential link between
Wynyard and St. James, and the
elevated roadway will contribute great'
ly in relieving traffic congestion and
jams at the southern end of the Hat'
hour Bridge.
When present plans mature, traffic
for the eastern suburbs will take the
new overhead highway to Fig Tree
Avenue, near the Domain, and so on
to William and Oxford Streets.
The station will also handle thou'
sands of ferry travellers who are forced
to use the Quay because of newly'
co'ordinated services from the North
Shore.
Further, linking up St. James and
Wynyard will eliminate deadends at
both stations and permit the depart'

ment to operate a more frequent time-
table. even with the train sets at pre-
sent available.
The Wynyard-George Street tunnel
is finished and the steel spans over
George Street are in place.
The tunnel at the Macquarie Street
portal is completed right back to St.
James, and three of the four steel ap-
proach spans are in position.
Many of the columns to carry the
railway tracks are completed, includ-
ing the beams for the central section.
All the foundation pillars, with the ex-
ception of two under the old Maritime
Services Building, which is slated for
demolition, have been sunk to bed-
rock, some to a depth of 90 feet.
All this is the biggest construction
job tackled in Sydney for many years
and, if it will bring relief and cheaper,
swifter transport to Sydney, we can
put up with the chaos at the Quay
for a couple of years.
Meanwhile, a few truckloads of
asphalt would work wonders to the
notorious ankle-deep potholes hapless
pedestrians leap and bound over in
Circular Quay, circa 1952.
Worl-Wide
Construction
Skyscrapers Come To Mexico City.
In the last few years, many changes
have come to one-time lazy, easy-
going Mexico City, where “to-
morrow” was soon enough to do any-
thing.
Rickety business buildings, sitting
squarely on the shifting sands of a
sinking subsoil, are fast giving way
to a modern city of towering sky-
scrapers.
A dozen or more new structures,
averaging 20 storeys in height, in-
clude a 40-storey “Latino-Americano”
building, are pushing skyward in de-
fiance of earthquakes and uncertain
soil conditions.
“Floating Foundation.”
These hazards have been tackled
by a former Massachusetts Institute
of Technology graduate. Dr. Leonardo
Zeevaert, who found his solution in
a “floating foundation” that utilises
a deep excavation, in combination
with concrete and wooden piles.
This cushioned type of foundation,
although in use in such filled-in areas
as Boston’s Bock Bay, New York
City, and Tokio in lapan (Frank
Lloyd Wright’s structure), is new to
Latin America.
To compensate partially for the
tremendous weight of the huge 40-
storey building, the soil expert pre-
scribed an excavation 41ft. beneath
the earth’s surface. Foundation piles
which rise below this from a hard
stratum at a depth of 108 ft. act as
reinforcement. With this base, Dr.
Zeevaert hoped to avoid the fate of
such Mexico City buildings as the
Palace of Fine Arts, which has sunk
about 15ft. since its construction in
the early years of the century.
Many Hazards.
Mexican architects and engineers
know that the capital city stands on
on an old lake bed. Clay soil under-
lying the city is gradually sinking as
more and more water is pumped from
the wells to complete a new water
supply for the city’s 3-million resi-
dents.
Other hazards are the contracting
subsoil of Mexico City and the ever-
present danger of earthquakes.
However, despite ominous warn-
ings that excavations for the 40-storey
structure and its tremendous weight
would upset the pressure of the soil
beneath surrounding buildings, all is
well to date.
New Incentive.
This new building, climbing ever
skyward, has given Mexican builders
a new incentive. A great number of
business buildings and apartment
blocks are being built in Mexico
City in bold, modernistic lines.
One building is the 37-storey in-
surance and security company block,
and high on a central hill, close to
the heart of the metropolis, a score
of new office buildings are going up
On the southern boundary of the
capital a 15-storey building has risen
from a lava bed. It will house the
science department of the University
of Mexico’s new educational centre.
Also under construction are the
13-storey, glassed-in building housing
the Government social security de-
partment, a 20-storey Department of
Irrigation building, and a 14-storey
railway terminal.

Discovery and ten other buildings at
the Festival of Britain site has been
entrusted to George Cohen, Sons and
Co. Ltd.
Preparatory work is to start imme-
diately, and, in spite of the Dome’s
uniqueness, it is regarded as substan-
tially the equivalent of a large gas-
holder. Mobile cranes with specially
long jibs will be used on the job.
Concealed Lighting
for Corner Space
Designed to serve as a planning
area and a working or sewing alcove,
the section in our photo is admirably
lighted for both tasks.
The decorative, scalloped cornice ex*
tending along the walls conceals
simple, single lamp fluorescent light'
ing fixtures which are shielded at the
bottom by lengths of ribbed, frosted
glass. Containing one 40 watt fluor-
escent lamp attached to the ceiling
on each side wall, this perimeter light'
ing furnishes general illumination for
the area, sufficient for all ordinary
tasks.
When used as a planning area, as
illustrated, the sewing machine is clos'
ed andplaced against a side wall. A
high level of illumination is needed
for sewing, and a twodamp fluorescent
ceiling fixture, not seen in the photo,
directs additional light down on the
sewing machine.
With both the alcove lighting and
ceiling fixture turned on, the lighting
provides a high intensity of illumina'
tion distributed uniformly over the en'
tire area.
Niches on the back wall are ilium-
inated by a concealed 30-watt fluor-
escent lamp.
CONCEALED LIGHTING
For Work-Planning Area.
There is a lot of convenience In this attrac-
tive planning work area—with particular em-
phasis on adequate illumination. This little
corner can be used for a home office, or
planning-sewing centre.

WANTED - A BUILDING MASTER PLAN!
BRAINS, ORGANISATION, MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE
AUSTRALIA MUST USE THEM TO FULLEST.
There are groups in every country
seeking to evolve something new.
They are at grips with those who cling
tenaciously to the old. New materials
have come into common use old
materials have been transformed. New
streamlined methods have been evolv'
ed—tried, approved, and used success'
fully.
Search for Knowledge.
The vision and craftsmanship of
architects, builders, engineers and
scientists are enhanced by the con'
stantly increasing sum of building
knowledge, and they in turn are served
by scientific and technical experts—
tne practical men employed by manu'
facturers whose energy and skill are
no less increasing than that of the
men they serve.
The building industry, and the
Australian building industry in par-
ticular, continues to introduce new
materials, new methods, new machinery,
and to modernise old ones. Surely
an industry that has done so much,
achieved so much, tirelessly contributed
to the Nation’s security and prosperity
deserves some consideration to'day.
It must be remembered that the
wealth of a city—its capital value- -
that is handed down to generation
after generation and to posterity and
upon which its expenditure is rated,
is comprised of buildings built by these
experts.
Wanted - - - A Plan!
Brickyards have closed, timber'
yards are jam'packed, mills have shut
down, construction has slowed to a
standstill, despite repeated, emphatic
warnings from leaders of the industry.
What Australia wants, what Aus'
tralia must evolve and implement,
without further ado, dilly' dallying,
procrastinating and delay, is A
BUILDING MASTER PLAN!
Cities Recover, Rebuild.
The end of World War II found
most of Europe in a state of devas'
tation and destruction. Cities were
flattened to the ground, whole popula'
tions were wiped out. Those who re'
mained had nothing, no worldly goods,
no faith and, perhaps, no future.
This pathetic state of affairs repeat'
ed itself in many British cities and
Continental towns. Across the face of
Europe lay a wide swath of destruction,
desolation, death, and doom. . . .
That was 10 years ago . . . what
of to'day?
To'day, whole new cities are rising
from the debris and despair of the
old . . . brand'new cities, skilfully and
sensibly planned, which are being
built with all the energy and en-
thusiasm that a house'hungry, work'
starved populace can muster.
# Holland, having set itself 1957
as the target for wiping out its housing
deficit, now finds that by a mighty
effort it will complete the programme
in 1954.
# West Germany plans to build 5
million homes in the next 10 years.
# France is rushing to completion
enormous housing projects.
© The Benelux countries each have
rebuilding schemes which are startling
(to Australians) in their immensity.
© Italy is a veritable hive of build'
ing activity, and whole huge cities are
being built on the outskirts of the old.
# The U.K. has set a target of
300,000 homes a year, apart from re'
building devastated areas, and blitzed
cities like Coventry and Plymouth.
These countries have set themselves
to the task and are achieving these
things because THEY HAVE A
BUILDING MASTER PLAN!
Other Nations, Too.
Other nations, too, not war'scarred,
perhaps, and thus possessing more ad'
vantages to build, are also registering
remarkable progress in the construe'
tion of homes, factories, and office
blocks.
Even backward Mexico, long happy
to dream about “Manana” (to'
morrow) is floating 40storey sky'
scrapers on the shifting sands of a
PROPOSED NEW NURSES’ BLOCK,
MATER MISERICORDIAE HOSPITAL. CROWS NEST, SYDNEY.
The Nurses' Block at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital has been an urgent need for many
years, and this perspective drawing illustrates the project. It is to be built on a site in
Roadlands Road, below the main hospital, and will provide for a recreation hall in the base-
ment, main entrance hall on the ground floor with reception rooms, offices- and some sleeping
accommodation. The first floor will contain sleeping accommodation in part, lounge rooms,
dining rooms and kitchens, while at one end, a chapel is to be constructed, running through
two floors in height. The remaining floors will be fully occupied with sleeping accommodation.
On each of the typical floors, in addition to the bedrooms, there will be a lounge room, a
small laundry, a kitchen and a drying room. The bedrooms will be of a standard size of 13’0”
x 8’0”, and will contain all built in furniture for the accommodation of one person to each
room. Access to the various floors will be gained by two lifts and three stairs. The building
will be of steel frame and concrete floors with brick facings, cement rendered walls inside with
plaster ceilings and wood floor covering. The building will contain accommodation for 250
nurses and will be approximately 100’0” high. Louis P. Burns is the architect.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


[ sinking subsoil, and thus overcoming
[ formidable construction problems.
Lazy, disease-ridden Puerto Rico,
long the plague-spot of the Caribbean,
is now making terrific advancement in
I the erection of towering apartment
blocks, and streets of fine rancho-type
[ homes.
The construction story repeats itself
right through the Americas, from
booming, bustling Canada with its
[ vast housing projects, across the
I mighty U.S.A. with its enormous de-
\ fence and civilian construction pro-
; grammes, past Mexico (busy replacing
its squat buildings with cloud-piercers),
through Venezuela, down to Brazil,
i where Rio de Janiero is bringing a
wonderful transformation to the old
| city.
Sao Paulo, too, is gracing its wide
streets (and carving out streets
where none existed hitherto) with
magnificent structures that any city
would be proud of.
Materials Plentiful.
Building materials in Australia are
more plentiful now thaa for many
years, and N.S.W. brickworks have
been stacking millions of bricks and
closing their yards because of reduced
demand. (It costs £ 10,000 to stock-
pile each million bricks.)
Timber merchants are in the same
quandary. The supply of timber now
far exceeds the demand. Timber
stocks are larger than since the last
war. and both local and imported hard-
woods are plentiful—but hard to sell.
Other basic materials are readily
available; in fact, building authorities
aver there’s nothing to stop Australia
launching a building boom!
According to some economists, that
may eventuate before the year’s end,
especially as the Treasurer last week
indicated an easing of taxation and
more opportunities for economic de-
velopment in the 1952-53 Budget, as
well as a lessening of credit controls.
When all controls are lifted, that
will be the day. Tens of thousands
of part-time loafers now in Govern-
ment employ will be released to find a
job that means work —-not 2 hours out
of every 8 as at present. This canker
that is eating the heart out of enter-
prise has reached as far as New Guinea,
where workers aver they are not given
more than 2 hours’ work a day.
That’s all the more reason why
Australia should have prepared and
ready a MASTER BUILDING PLAN,
to launch on the wave of optimism
which is bound to sweep across the
Nation.
For a Nation which has never done
things by halves, be it to fight wars
or play cricket, such a plan deserves
the fullest sponsorship of the State
and Federal Governments.
Conceived and administered by prac'
tical master builders and experts of
allied industries, the Plan could handle
construction on an Australia'wide basis;
the construction of homes, hospitals,
factories, office blocks, defence pro'
jects and, in fact, the many ramifica'
tions of every industry, organised and
administered as they were in the days
when real progress was made by the
masters of industry as in other parts
of the world.
Obstacles?
One building industry leader, in en-
dorsing the Plan, pointed out that its
implementation would be handicapped
by the unions’ reluctance to co-operate
in measures designed to raise produc-
tion.
He said it was “downright shame-
ful” that so many opportunities to ex-
pand production are being wilfully
neglected in Australia.
“Building; Lighting: Engineering’’
was reminded that a noted American
who visited Australia last year was
shocked by the trade union restraints
which, he said, were ruinously lower-
ing the Nation's production and effi-
ciency.
One example was the laying, by
each of six bricklayers engaged on a
project in Canberra, of no more than
200 bricks a day. The same men, he
found, would lay 700 or 800 bricks
in eight hours for incentive rates at
the week-end. (Thirty to forty years
ago their capacity was 1000 bricks a
day and they were not overworked.)
Similar practices are known to exist
in other sections of the building trade,
and whatever risk there is that the
industry will become slack, involving
unemployment, arises directly from the
inflation of costs by these gO'slow
tactics.
The only way to induce people to
build homes and thus provide steady
employment in the industry is to work
harder and reduce overall construction
costs. The same problem applies to
the Building Master Plan. There is
an urgent need for it throughout
Australia, as well as urgent need of a
new attitude to work.
SECOND AUSTRALIAN
PLANNING CONGRESS.
The Australian Planning Institute
(Victorian Division) advises that pre-
liminary arrangements have been
finalised for the Second Australian
Planning Congress, which will be held
in Melbourne from October 21st to
25th.
The Congress follows the successful
inauguration of the Australian Plan'
ning Institute at the First Congress
held in Canberra last August, when
Professor W. A. Holford, Professor
of Town Planning at the London
University, was the guest of honour.
It is hoped to be able to invite
another distinguished planner to be the
guest at this year's Congress, and fur'
ther details regarding this, and other
arrangements, will be available at a
later date.
THE NEW STATE HOSPITAL IN KUWAIT
DEVELOPMENT IN SMALL ARAB STATE.
The rapid development of rich oil deposits in Kuwait, the tiny Arab State of 150,000 inhabi-
tants on the north-west coast of the Persian Gulf, is bringing great changes and benefits to
the people. A few years ago Kuwait was a little known territory with no budget. Its people
earned a precarious and meagre livelihood with their flocks, from dhow building, and through
pearl smuggling. 95 % of the population were suffering from trachoma, the dread eye disease
of the desert, and 98% from tuberculosis. Today the scene is rapidly changing, and the
annual State income from oil is nearly £4,000,000, and the ruling Sheikh, H.H. Abdulla al
Salem al Subah. has embarked upon an ambitious programme of welfare schemes designed to
help his people in their struggle against poverty, illiteracy and disease. The first step in the
welfare programme was the building and equipping of the New State Hospital, which is
probably the most modern of its kind in the Middle East, and its fame has spread, far and
wide, and patients flock into Kuwait from all over the Persian Gulf and from many parts of
Arabia The chief medical staff is British, headed by Dr. E. Parry, M.B., F.R.C.S. He is
assisted by an ophthalmologist, an anaesthetist, a dental surgeon, and a Palestinian specialist
in pulmonary tuberculosis. The majority of the nursing sisters are Palestinian Arabs but
plans are well advanced to open a nursing school to train local girls. Plans and models’ have
been completed for a magnificent sanatorium of 200 beds for T.B. patients and the building
is nearing completion and should be in operation by the end of the year.

New Doulton Pottery Works
85ft. SPAN PRECAST FRAMING.
The question of how they might ex'
tend their Whieldon Works at Stoke'
on-Trent was being examined by Douh
ton Co. Ltd. prior to 1939, but
with the outbreak of war any idea of
carrying such a programme through
had, for the time being, to be sus'
pended. Now, however a scheme of
reconstruction is in process of com'
pletion.
The Whieldon Works specialise in
sanitary earthenware and vitreous
china. Previously all the firing there
was carried out in a number of coal'
fired intermittent kilns known, because
of their shape, as “bottle kilns,” but
these are being replaced by two
“Dressier” type continuous gas'fired
tunnel kilns of the most modern de'
sign. These new kilns are each about
320 ft. long and the new building has
been specially designed to house not
only them, but all the processing after
the first, or “biscuit” firing.
Owing to the fact that the site con'
sisted largely of made-up land and the
load bearing capacity was therefore
poor, the whole building was founded
on a system of in situ piles—good
load bearing stratum being found at
from 20ft. to 30ft.—to minimise any
danger of subsequent differential settle'
ment.
In Situ Framing.
Up to and including the first floor
slab, all the construction, with the ex-
ception of a small annexe to the east,
is in situ concrete framed. It is on
this construction that the load of the
kilns is carried. Columns at 15ft.
centres divide the building lengthwise
into 32 equal bays; main beams run
longitudinally and span the 15ft. from
column to column, and secondaries at
7ft. 6in. centres span transversely be'
tween the main beams. The suspended
slab of the first floor is sin. thick and
cast integral with the beams. At the
ground level the pile caps are con'
nected by a series of cill beams, but,
in general, the ground floor slab is not
suspended. Where concentrated loads
have to be carried, it is, and the cill
beams and slab are then cast integral.
Everywhere else paper joints separate
the one from the other.
Precast Framing.
From first floor slab upwards the
construction changes from the in situ
to a proprietary precast system of
framing, of which the span is 85ft.
The framing consists essentially of
transversely spanning portals spaced at
15ft. centres which carry precast pur-
lins 4ft. 6in. apart and special gutter
units along the eaves.
Each main cross spanning portal is
members with a patented system made
up of four separately cast (LAMBDA)
of scarfed jointing at the connections
which maintains the required degree
of structural continuity. The leg mem'
bers are ”L” shaped, they weigh
about 2£ tons each and are designedly
stiff to minimise moments of bending
in the rafters. Rafter elements weigh
about l£ tons apiece and despite their
span are only 18in. by 7in. in sectional
area. Laterally the stiffness and struc'
tural rigidity comes from the purlin
and gutter units —with the method of
jointing used at their connections. To
form these joints, “U” shaped bars
projecting from either end of both
types of unit are looped round fixing
bolts that protrude upwards from the
backs of the rafter principals; the nut
to these bolts is tightened down over
a large washer which grips and holds
the “U” bars in place and the joint
completed by filling with a grout.

World-Wide Housing
Problems
There is no country without a hous'
ing problem, states a United Nations’
report, and the gap between housing
needs and what industry is providing
is getting worse all the time, it adds.
The report, dealing with world
social conditions, says that one of the
major causes is “backwardness of the
building industry as regards tech'
nology and organisation.”
In India, the report continues, nine
out of 10 homes are one'room flats,
and every lavatory serves an average
of 23 people.
In Europe, 5,667,000 dwelling
units were destroyed in the war.
In Africa, the number of people
who, for the common good of the
world, need to be re'housed is just
about equal to the total number of
people.
In the U.S.A., 1,500,000 housing
units must be built every year for the
next 10 years to fill current needs.
(Australia requires 100,000 new
homes per annum to meet existing
demands, and there is no backward'
ness of the building industry in tech-
nology or organisation. Competent
builders are just waiting the oppot'
tunity to forge ahead.)
Need For Harder
Work
Need for harder work was stressed
last week by Melbourne Chamber of
Commerce President, Mr. W. J. Alii'
son.
Addressing the Annual Meeting, Mr.
Allison, who is also President of the
Associated Chambers of Commerce,
said:
“Australians as a people do not work
hard enough or long enough to get the
productivity which alone can reduce
costs of production and distribution to
an economic level. We are paying
dearly for the 40'hour week, which was
introduced at a most inappropriate
time, and ever since has been a major
inflationary influence.
“More work per hour per man, ir-
respective of the job, is the only way
to offset the inflationary effect of wage
increases.”
BRITAIN’S FIFTH T.V.
STATION TO OPEN SHORTLY.
Britain’s fifth high-power television
station is expected to open in mid'
August.
The station at Wenvoe, near Car'
diff in South Wales, will bring T.V.
into the homes of a further 3? mil'
lion people, and increase coverage of
the country to 78 per cent.
PRECAST CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION
IN BRITAIN.
The chronic shortage of timber in Britain
has given great fillip to the introduction and
use of precast concrete members for all types
of building construction. We illustrate a
new building being erected at Stoke-on-Trent
for Doulton & Co Ltd., which with a span
of 85ft. is thought to be the largest in Britain.
The pre-cast portals are spaced 15ft. apart
with pre-cast purlins at 4’6” centres. Upper
view shows the framing being erected, and

Britain’s Largest Pre-Stressed Roof
CLEAR AREA OF 300ft. BY 150ft.
Bournemouth Corporation, Britain,
has recently completed a large build-
ing to garage and service its public
transport vehicles which is of particu-
lar interest to architects, builders and
engineers as it represents the largest
example yet carried out in Great
Britain employing prestressed concrete.
Structural Details.
The following structural details from
“The Builder,” Britain, are of in-
terest: —-
The garage buildinp gives a column-
free covered space of approximately
4?,000 sq. ft.—3ooft. long bv 150 ft.
wide. This span of 150 ft. is the
largest yet constructed in Britain with
prestressed edge beams and a shell
roof. The roof is a reinforced con-
crete thin-shell structure made up of
nine cylindrical-shaped vaults with pre-
stressing in the edge beams. The span,
which is transversal, bridges the 150 ft.
width of the building without inter-
mediate support. All nine vaults have
a radius of curvature of 22ft. 10|in.,
a rise from springing to crown of 6ft.
9fin., and, except at the ends and
springing where there is some slight
increase, a shell thickness of 2fin.
The chord width all through is 33ft.
Intermediate edge beams are alike
lOin. wide and sft. 6in. deep. The
external edge beams are slightly larger
and have an upstand. These were cast
in situ and post-tensioned by the
Magnel-Blaton system. An extractable
rubber core was used to form the cable
ducts and the complete cable threaded
in after the withdrawal of the core.
The wire used was 0.276 in. (7 mm.)
diameter hard drawn steel of 95 to
110 tons ultimate strength. With an
extension of 7|in. on the 150 ft. span
the stress induced in the 125 wires
used in each intermediate edge beam
was 125,000 lb. per sq. in., which in
turn induced a total compressive force
in the concrete of 1,136,250 lb. (507.4
tons). Under the constructional loads
this compressive force was sufficient
to “hog” the beams fin. A 15 per
cent, allowance was made for losses
due to concrete shrinkage and to
creep in the steel and the concrete,
which occur with time. The final pre-
stress, therefore, is not less than 430
tons (507.4 tons minus 15 per cent.).
Minimising Shrinkage.
In order to minimise the effects of
shrinkage the edge beams were, in
practice, each cast in three separate
stages. Concrete used for them had
a specified 28-day strength of 6000 lb.
per sq. in. The mix used was 1 : If :
3, and the necessary compaction was
obtained by vibration. The casting of
the beams and of the end tie frames
preceded the construction of the shell
vaults, but it was not until the con'
Crete of the vaults had been cured to
a specified strength that prestressing
was carried out. For the vaults proper
the pressure'sprayed method of con'
creting was adopted and for this work,
where finely'graded materials only are
used, the mix was 1 :3. Here the re'
inforcement is of mild steel, most of
it in the form of mesh fabric, but
partly in the form of bars. The total
design load on each roof bay is 195
tons, and of this there is a live load
component of 60 tons. Strain'hardened
square twisted steel reinforcement
gives continuity between the edge
beams and vaults, and although they
were separately constructed and form'
ed by different methods, the two act
together and function as a monolithic
whole. There are no expansion/
contraction joints anywhere in the
structure; stresses resulting from tem'
perature change have all been allowed
for in the design.
The architects were Jackson and
Greenen; consultant engineers, R.
Travers Morgan and Partners; con'
tractors, James Drewitt and Son Ltd.,
of Bournemouth; and the prestressed
work was by Vibrated Concrete Con'
struction Co. Ltd.
BOURNEMOUTH TRANSPORT
DEPOT.
This imposing structure has recently been
completed by the Bournemouth Corporation
to house and service all their public tran-
sport vehicles The budding, which will later
be duplicated gives a column-free, covered
space of 45,000 sq ft., 300 ft. long by 150
ft. wide, the 150 ft. span being the largest
so far constructed in England, with pre-stress-
ed edge beams and a shell roof of 2½” in
thickness Our illustration shows interior and
exterior views.

STONE,

METAL
IDEAS
FOR
ALL
STONEWORK: ROUGH AND SMOOTH.
Stone as a medium for fireplace construction appears to be finding increasing favour with archi-
tects and interior decorators of recent years, thus reverting to an age-old pattern for the stone
fireplace in many forms and variations goes back to antiquity On the left a rugged appearance
is engendered by the ise of random rubble, which is in striking contrast to the smooth finish
of waits, floor and ceiling and the delicately designed furniture. A more restrained note is
struck in the sawn stone in thin strips with raked joints that is employed in the example on
the right. These houses are in California (left) and Texas (right).
STONE, MARBLE AND
STEEL.
The great sheet steel flue studded with bolts
that forms the heavy chimney breast in the
upper left example and is supported on piles
of rough stonework dominates this living
room at Tarzana, California. Alongside (top
right) a much less ponderous design in small-
size stonework is set off by a most unusual
decorative clock, the home being at Tucson,
Arizona. Fireplace in the bottom left is in
a conservatory in which the ceiling is of sus-
pended stripped material and the floor of such
a heavy-piled carpet as to look like turf. Sur-
round to the fireplace is of dark veined
marble. House is at Bel Air, California. The
remaining example is a seaside homes at Pacific,
Palisades, California, depends for its appeal
on thin strips of stonework of varying thick-
ness with heavy recessed joints.

AUSTRALIA’S FIRST "ROTOLACTOR”
NATION’S LARGEST DAIRY INSTALLATION
Is Monument To Initiative and Enterprise.
Construe ion has now been com'
pleted on Australia’s first “Rotolactor”
(or revolving dairy), and this unique
installation will shortly come into full
operation to augment the Sydney met'
ropolitan milk supply.
Set in sylvan and rural surround'
ings at Menangle, the Rotolactor is a
monument to the outstanding initiative
and enterprise of Camden Park Estate
Pty. Ltd., owners of one of the biggest
dairy herds in the British Common'
wealth.
Camden Park Estate was originally
granted to Captain John Macarthur in
1810: he was the man who founded
Australia’s wool industry, and in pass'
ing, it is interesting to note that sheep
grazing on the historic estate tO'day
are actual direct descendants from the
original flock.
Milking Problems.
Camden Park, among the pioneers
in Australia in T.B. testing of milk
cattle and the production of certified
milk, has 3000 cows on the Estate—
Guernseys, Jerseys and Ayrshires, and
are called upon to milk some 1200
cows twice a day.
Increasing the size of the milking
sheds—putting in 12 bails instead of
six bails, then 36 instead of 24, and
so on—found the number of races un-
wieldly and proved conclusively that a
static shed on a very large scale would
not solve the milking problems. It
had to be mechanical.
A scheme was evolved whereby the
cow was milked whilst travelling the
length of the shed on a conveyor belt.
This milking shed had many of the
features of the Rotolactor at Plains-
borough, New Jersey, U.S.A. —one of
the only two other rotolactors in the
world.
However, this type of installation
had numerous faults, so the conveyor
type of milker was finally ruled out.
After further consideration of the
many problems involved in “mobile”
milking, the next move was toward the
circular milker, and it was at this stage
all concerned realised that the inspira'
t:on which had produced the Roto'
lactor had also solved the problem of
milking cows quickly at a central spot.
U.S. Investigations.
The Managing Director of Camden
Park, Mr. E. Macarthur Onslow, forth'
with decided to visit the U.S.A. and
call on Mr. H. W. Jeffers, Senr.,
President of the Walker - Gordon
Laboratory Co., and designer of the
first rotolactor, and get on'the'spot in'
formation of the many unusual
features incorporated in such a unique
project.
The result of Mr. Macarthur
Onslow’s journey and study of the
American rotolactor, plus many novel
ideas of his own, are to be seen tO'day
in the first Australian rotolactor at
Menangle.
Work Starts.
On his return to Australia, Mr.
Macarthur Onslow engaged a com'
petent and qualified team, comprising
architect, engineer, electrical and
mechanical consultant, and milking
machine experts, and the necessary
working drawings were prepared.
Such good progress was made that ph
February 4, 1950, a contract was h?t
to E. V. Campbell Pty. Ltd. for,-the
erection of the building.
Novel Features.
Though this is the shird
rotolactor installation, it is the first
time that the whole concept has been
handled as an architectural problem
instead of a purely mechanical one.

The design for the building provides
for outer walls of glass with a mini'
mum of solid piers, so that complete
inspection from outside is provided ail
round (see photo).
A milk bar approached from an ob'
servation terrace is a feature and a
desirable spot from which to view the
whole operation of this mechanical
marvel (see photo).
Great Interest in Project.
On the architect’s design, Bryant
Bros. Pty. Ltd., Sydney Dairy Em
gineers, prepared a working model
which was later exhibited at the Health
Week exhibition and the Royal Easter
Show. The model created great in'
terest in the novel project, and it is
thought that other large dairies may
consider erecting rotolactors.
Differs Little From Original.
Basically, the Camden Park unit dif'
fers little from the original U.S. pro'
totype. The rotolactor building is
shaped like a shallow drum, 72ft. in
internal diameter and 15ft. in height.
The ceiling is lined with polished
aluminium, on which high' power
fluorescent strip lights are mounted.
The rotolactor consists of two cir'
cular platforms, one inside the other.
The outside platform is a concrete
ring. The inside ring revolves in an
anticlockwise direction.
The inside ring is constructed of
metal gratings, on which 50 cow bails
and milking machines are mounted.
This revolving milking ring is
mounted on wheels and is operated in
an ingenious manner. Power is picked
up by busbars and collector shoes
from the rail and goes to the electric
motors. Four 2 h.p. motors are in'
stalled, with two cons antly in use and
two in reserve, to be automatically cut
in in the event of motor failure.
Milking Operation.
When milking begins the cows walk
one by one up a passageway (see
photo) which connects the holding
yards with the rotolactor building.
Before animals reach the revolving
platforms they have their udders
spray washed, both sides, dried with
a sterilised cloth, and inspected by a
trained attendant.
The cows then walk across the con-
Crete platform and s.ep into vacant
bails as the milking ring moves slowly
past.
As the platform revolves, a metal
yoke automatically falls into place over
the cow’s neck to hold it in the bail.

Teat cups are attached, and the cir*
cuit is commenced. By the time the
cow is milked out, 6 to 8 minutes
later, the platform has turned full
circle, the milk has been released into
a weigh bowl, and the cow’s yoke and
feed bin automatically slide upward to
release the animal.
The cow is now free to walk for'
ward out of the bail, down the ramp,
and thence into the yard.
The platform continues its revolu-
tions and another cow steps into the
vacant bail, and so on until the whole
herd is milked.
When milking commences, one cow
is milked by the time the platform has
completed one revolution; at the end
of the second revolution, 50 cows have
been milked ,and a further 50 at each
succeeding revolution.
Milking units are installed in sets of
six; there are seven six'cow units and
one eight'cow units, giving 50 units
in all.
Each bail is fitted with a hinged
framed grating on which the cow
stands and leads to a concealed coiv
crete drain through which manure is
drawn by running water to a pit for
use as liquid manure.

From the weighing bowls and dump
vats the milk is pumped through stain-
less steel pipelines to the adjacent
dairy factory for treatment.
All services are taken to the factory,
75ft away, by means of an overhead
carrier (see photo) which has been
designed to give protection to a -
tendants carrying out maintenance and
at the same time gives access to all
vehicles operating across the estate.
Everything Permanent.
The rotolactor will be in operation
il to 14 hours a day and 365 days
days a year, consequently everything
has been built for permanency. The
work of the building contractor and
all other contractors has been outstand-
ing in this regard.
Six powerful vacuum pumps draw
off the milk from the machines and
send it on its way to the factory. Any
four of the six will serve the plant,
thus allowing for adequate maintenance
of the remaining two pumps.
Constructional Details.
The rotolactor building basically is
a brick structure with concrete beams
and brick piers.
The roof is of steel-framed clere-
story construction, carried of the main
central column. The beams radiate
out to eight smaller columns at the
inner perimeter of the moving plat-
form.
Timber framing is incorporated in
the roof construction, which is sheath-
ed over with boarding, and finished
with Pabco Malthoid roofing.
It is lined on the underside and
clerestory with patterned aluminium
sheeting, which serves to reflect light
into the interior of the building.
Rainwater from the roof is taken
by downpipes concealed in the piers.
One feature is the enormous con-
crete slab which is skilfully balanced
on five little columns on either side
and sitting upon the walls of the
cowrace.
Drainage is another important
point. It is handled independently
from the rotolactor platform itslf, but
every item of drainage within the
compass of the building is gathered,
taken to a central sump 13ft. below
ground level, is automatically pumped
to a higher level and taken by means
of open drains to the main sullage
pit.
The architect for the Rotolactor
project was Mr. T. M. Maloney, A.R.
1.8. A., A.R.A.LA.; Messrs. M. S.
Stanley and H. A. Llewellyn were the

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust. - N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia NSW
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday.
sth June, 1952, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. E. L. Freedman,
and 77 members and visitors attended.
Apologies were received from
Messrs. A. M. Brown (Farmer’s), J P

The President warmly welcomed the
visitors present, and particularly the
representatives and members of the
Retail Traders’ Association of N.S.W.;
also. Miss Bridle, the Principal of the
College °f Retailing, and students of
the College.
Minutes of General Meeting held on
the Ist May, 1952, were taken as read
and confirmed.
It was reported from Council that
the following had been admitted as

information as to the Conditions
governing the Award.
The President also reminded mem-
inl-K of , th <L forthcoming visits on the
10th and 17th July.
On behalf of Council, the President
t , he P r °P°sed Exhibit for
Health Week in October, 1952, had
taken satisfactory shape, and that it
was hoped that sufficient finance will
be forthcoming to enable the Society
to stage this most informative exhibit.
Next Meeting.
The next meeting of the Society
will be held on Thursday, 3rd July,
1952, at 7.30 p.m. The meeting will
be held jointly with the Institute of
Optometrists of N.S.\V. The speaker,
representing the 1.0.0., will be J.
Lederer, B.Sc., A.S.T.C. The subject
of his paper will be “Visual Per-
formance.”
“LIGHTING THE RETAIL
STORE.”
Mr. A. M. Forbes, 8.E., A.M.I.E.
(Aust.), F.I.E.S. (Aust.), in intro-
ducing the panel of speakers, said that
the papers presented will represent a
co-ordinated survey of the basic light-
ing principles relevant to the various
functions in the retail store; each
speaker will speak as a lighting en-
gineer, and not as a merchandising ex-
pert.
The subjects they will discuss are
very pertinent even at a time when
restrictions and forebodings are very
much publicised, because private en-
terprise has a way of solving its own
problems and lighting can provide one
sort of solution; and further, because
any form of business aid is more im-
portant now than ever and becoming
more important every day.
Furthermore, the usefulness of light-
ing as such is admitted often enough,
but is seldom analysed critically in
open forum. Misunderstandings, omis-
sions and disagreements which are
aired to-night clear the way for con-
structive progress. Furthermore, light-
ing ins not merely a selling tool for
the goods themselves like packaging
and chromium. It presents the store,
the goods and the staff in new ways
that can be varied in time and space.
It also serves like building materials,
and combines with them to construct
new presentations at minimum cost at
a time when straight constructional
costs are sky high.
Mr. Forbes concluded his introduc-
tion of the speakers by stating that
this symposium was a sincere con-
tribution by the lighting fraternity for
a common objective.
Eight Papers.
The eight papers were then present-
ed, each dealing with a specific aspect
of Retail Store Lighting.
“The Seeing Problems of the Retail
Store,” L. S. Hyatt; “Light,and Store
Lay-out and Design,” B. H. Harwood;
“Light, and Store Sales,” F. O. Baker;
“Light, and Store Displays,” F. de
Courcey Gribble; “Light, and Store
Advertising,” F. E. Swift; “Light, and
Staff Morale and Efficiency,” T. S.
McCourt; “Light, and Store Main-
tenance,” G. Y. Falk; “Light, and
Store Economics,” L. H. Blunt.
In summing-up, Mr. Forbes said
that because of lack of time the whole
of the problems affecting each of the
phases of retailing discussed here could
not be presented, but that an attempt
has been made to show that light in
the store can be:—
Vocal—in terms of direct advertis-
ing of premises and products;
Constructional —in creating appear-
ance and atmosphere;
Selective —in emphasis and accent
on goods or areas;
Economic—in creating conditions of
easier buying and selling.
DISCUSSION.
During an animated discussion,
many questions were put to the panel
of speakers.
“What level of illumination?”
“Which type of Light Source?”
“Which Lighting System?” “Fluores-
cent vs. Incandescent?” (Mr. Woods);
these questions were not only answered
by the panel but they also provoked
some interesting comment and sugges-
tions from the audience; that, where
two adjacent stores tried to compete
by installing “more and more lumens,”
it might be advisable not to install
“more lumens still,” but to install
“lumens, better designed” (Mr.
Humphries); that, instead of compet-
ing on the basis of illumination values
only, it was desirable to be more
imaginative in the use of colours, of
blending fluorescent and incandescent
lighting to produce an artistic effect
(Mr. Smith).
The problem of flexibility of Store
Lighting was raised (Mr. Benjamin),
particularly with regard to the Depart-
ment Store, and reference was made
to a recent Dutch installation where
the lighting layout was made up from
movable square fixtures which were in-
terchangeable and could be installed in
any way desired, thus permitting a
maximum of lighting flexibility.
The question of “what return can
the Retailer expect for his invest-
ment?” aroused considerable comment.
One solution submitted was to install
new lighting installations successively
in one department after another. This
was to enable the store management
to gauge accurately the success of the
lighting installation in terms of rela-
tive departmental turnovers, and com-
pare these with the costs involved.
Vote of Thanks.
Mr. W. H. Brown, a Past-President
of the Society and the representative
of Anthony Hordern & Sons Ltd., at
the meeting moved the Vote of Thanks
to Mr. Forbes and his panel of eight
Illuminating Engineers. He congratu-
lated the speakers on the presentation
of their papers and Mr. Forbes on the
handling of the meeting. He noted
especially that all speakers had em-
phasised that store lighting was an im-
40

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


portant adjunct to selling, the selling
itself is the important thing. He
pointed out that the ultimate value of
a lighting installation lay in the in'
creased net profit it produced.
Mr. D. J. Halley, a designer of
Store Fittings, and Shop Fronts, and
representing H. 6? E. Sidgreaves Pty.
Ltd., warmly supported Mr. Brown by
saying that the store designer was ever
aware of the relation of light and the
materials he was handling, and he coil'
gratulated the speakers on the clarity
with which they had presented their
case.
The President quoted Mr. Ashley
Buckingham, a Past'President of the
Retail Traders’ Association, who had
defined the modern Retail Store as a
“Machine Designed for Selling.” He
said that the Illuminating Engineer
might well suggest that the oil for
this machine was the light which he
designed and provided.
In conclusion, Mr. Freedman ex'
pressed the hope that this meeting
would mark the beginning of closer
cooperation between the Retail
Traders’ Association and the Illuminat'
ing Engineering Society in the pursuit
of their common interests in “Lighting
the Retail Store.”
LIGHTING THE RETAIL STORE
Paper No. Is THE SEEING PROBLEMS OF THE RETAIL STORE.
By L. S. HYATT,
Lighting Engineer, British General Electric Co. Pty. Ltd.
(First of a series of eight papers read before the Illuminating Engineering Society
of Australia, N.S.W., on June 5, 1952.)
87% of all our impressions are re'
ceived through our eyes. Therefore
merchandise must be lighted to take
full advantage of this important reac'
tion, and retailers have come to re'
alise that the more the customer sees
the more he is likely to buy; „ the
easier the goods are to find and ex-
amine, the greater the opportunity for
profitable sales.
Thus the science of artificial light'
ing is one for providing those facili'
ties for vision, and investigation shows
that vision is dependent on four pri'
mary factors: size, brightness, con'
trast and time.
1. Size. This is the most readily
accepted factor in lighting. A large
object, such as an armchair or a re'
frigerator, subtends a large visual angle
at the eye and so is easily seen, where'
as the stitching on a glove being small'
er subtends a lesser visual angle at
the eye and so is much more difficult
to see.
Visual acuity, which is a measure
of the smallest detail that can be seen
in terms of visual angle, increases
greatly with the level of illumination.
Light is the “magnifier” making vis-
ible those details that might be other'
wise overlooked.
In other words, the smaller the
goods for sale the higher the level of
illumination required.
2. Brightness. The brightness of
any object is proportional to the
amount of illumination falling on it
and the amount of the illumination
that it reflects. Under equal levels
of illumination a white surface will
appear to be much brighter than a
grey surface, which, however, can be
made to appear equally as bright if
the level of illumination incident upon
it is increased sufficiently.
Thus, for equal brightness and visi-
bility a dark coloured article will re'
quire a higher level of illumination
than a light coloured.
3. Contrast. Dark objects displayed
against a light background are no'
ticed far more quickly than those dis'
played against dark backgrounds, and
vice versa. Alternatively, consider
black print on white paper which is
easily visible, whereas black thread on
grey cloth is not. This difference in
visibility is largely a matter of con'
trast, that is, the difference in bright'
ness between the object and its back'
ground, which can be made more ap'
parent by increasing the level of ih
lumination.
Thus the higher the level of ilium'
ination, the greater the resolving
power of the eye, at least until bright'
ness levels are reached beyond which
there is the possibility of glare.
4. Time. Seeing is not an instam
taneous process, the eye requires time
to absorb the visual scene. Let us use
the camera for illustration. To take
a photograph on a dull day requires
a fairly long time exposure, whereas
on a bright sunny day a very short
time exposure is required.
Similarly with the eye of a custom'
er walking through the store. To ah
low the customer to pick up general
details of a display without necessarily
stopping, sufficient illumination must
be provided, otherwise the display
simply will not register on the retina,
or “film” of our customer’s eye.
These four factors are mutually in'
terrelated and interdependent, and
within limits a deficiency in any one
can be balanced by the adjustment of
one or more of the other three. In
most cases the time and size factors
are limited, as in, say, a furniture
store where the smallest detail to be
seen may be a stool or table, or a gift
store where the smallest piece may
be a piece of pottery or a booch. It
is then up to the lighting engineer
to control brightness or contrast, so
that, properly used, they can oveicome
any deficiency as regards small size
and limited time for observation.
1.3.5.10 Formula. As you will now
be aware, the prime standard govern'
ing our four factors is the level of
illumination, the quantity value of
lighting. And to obtain the real
benefits of modern store lighting an
engineered installation must give con'
sideration to the “attention” value of
the various parts of the store, by
providing in these areas levels of ih
lumination based on a 1.3.5.10 ratio.
1. Circulation Areas. The lighting
engineer might provide for 15 to 20
lumens per square foot, or foot'
candles in these areas where no mer-
chandise is on display.
2. Sales Areas. Approximately
three times as much is good practise
for open counter and table display,
LIGHTING AND DISPLAY.
Display experts state that it is difficult to make
more than 25% of the people stop in front
of any show window. But it has been prov-
ed that you can make more than 80% turn
and look at a night-time window display dur-
ing the three seconds that it takes to walk by
the average store.

the general areas where choice is
made.
3. Show and Display Cases. Pro-
viding approximately five times as
much lighting as is in the circulation
areas will have the same effect as
moving the merchandise closer to the
customer, and breaks down the sell-
ing barrier created by glass or distance.
4. Window and Featured Displays.
Then “punch” lighting of some ten
times the circulation lighting will pro-
vide the necessary attraction power for
featured displays, displays that bring
people to the back of the store and
increase impulse buying.
But quantity alone does not guar-
antee comfortable seeing conditions
albeit that the customer can pick out
small details and colour, etc., for see-
ing is not a mechanical process and
thought must be given to those factors
that physically and psychologically
contribute to the satisfaction of using
the lighting. Excessive brightness con-
trasts and glare, whether direct from
the source or reflected from the dis-
play items, must be avoided. This
simply means that there is nothing to
be gained by highlighting, say, a dis-
play of silverware if reflected light par-
tially blinds- the customer, or alterna-
tively, if the position of the lighting
equipment obscures the display by in-
terfering with the customer’s vision so
that he is all the time trying to look
around the source to see what lies
behind it.
The diversity of brightness patterns
in the field of view should not exceed
10—1. Light distribution must be
controlled so that shadows and high'
lights appear only where they assist
in recognition. And lastly, the light'
ing must not detract from the atmos-
phere of the selling area concerned.
In conclusion, it is important to
remember that the seeing problems
encountered in store lighting are no
different from those encountered in
any other lighting installation, it is
only that the emphasis is different,
the emphasis being in this case that
the installation provides light for sell-
ing. The fundamentals of lighting
do not change, but the multipurpose
of lighting, with its relationship to
colour and display, make it a tool in
the hands of the designer, who is
constantly striving for the original and
the novel. The answer to quite a
number of his problems can be sup-
plied by the lighting engineer.
LIGHT AND STORE LAYOUT AND DESIGN.
Paper No. 2:
By B. H. HARWOOD,
Lighting Engineer, Australian General Electric Pty. Ltd.
Store lighting, like Stage lighting,
should never steal the show. Its
function is to provide as unobtrusive-
ly as possible the appropriate atmos-
phere and setting for the merchandise.
The atmosphere of a Store gives
those who enter it both at snapshot
and a time-exposure picture of its de-
sirability as a place to shop. The im-
pression gained from the quick glimpse
is important in attracting people into
the Store, but it is the result of the
time-exposure which largely deter-
mines how long they will stay, and
whether or not they want to return.
If the interest of the shopper is to be
sustained, the atmosphere of the Store
must be in keeping with the type of
goods sold.
Atmosphere is obtained by design-
ing a brightness and colour pattern
of the Store ensemble that is consist-
ent with the type of store and its mer-
chandise, harmonises with the archi-
tecture and decorations, and is co-re-
lated to the brightness and colour pat-
tern of the displays.
When a number of areas or objects
in a Store are of the same brightness,
no one attracts attention over another.
But when one area is made brighter
than others, the attention of the shop-
ner is instinctively directed to the
brighter area. By creating steps in
brightness in the Store, it is possible
to draw attention to a succession of
areas or displays, with each one lead-
ing on to the next. Variations in the
size of the steps and in the distance
between them, can be used to assist
the regulation of the traffic through
the Store.
The intelligent use of colour in
conjunction with the brightness pat-
tern, is essential if the maximum effect
is to be realised.
The wide variety in size and type
of Stores will naturally be reflected
in the methods of lighting used. A
shop which specialises in selling Baby-
wear requires a different atmosphere
to of a Hardware Store, and Con-

sequently different methods of light-
ing will be used. In one case, a
soft general illumination with delicate
and subtle colour effects could be
used, while the other would require
a high level of predominantly direct
lighting to produce the necessary
highlights and accents.
All methods of lighting, ranging
from the simple direct lighting of fac-
tories, through the elaborate archi-
tectural elements of public buildings,
to the dramatic concealed lighting of
the theatre, can be successfully adapt-
ed to meet the requirements of the
modern Store.
Good general lighting is essential in
any well lighted Store. A few types
of Stores successfully use general
lighting as the only lighting. Many
more, however, use it as a foundation
to which is added special lighting for
feature displays, showcases, shelves
and niches. Used alone, general light-
ing is acceptable for some markets
and chain stores which sell articles of
about the same size, price and profit.
Usually the goods are displayed open
on closely spaced tables or counters,
while the wall cases or shelves are
used merely to hold stock. The pur-
pose of such lighting systems is to
create a stimulating effect and produce
an even illumination throughout.
Non-uniform or localised general
lighting is suitable in those Stores
where the important sales areas are
so arranged or grouped that the light-
ing units can be located to give more
light on them, and less light on the
circulation areas between.
Department Stores and those handl-
ing goods covering a wide range in
size, price and profit, require a gen-
eral lighting scheme supplemented by
special lighting on important sales
areas and displays.
A general lighting scheme, using
indirect type units, add spaciousness
to the Store interior and help to
create a soft atmosphere. Supplement-
ary lighting from recessed spots or
downlights, ihcreases the illumination
on important sales areas, and gives
character and interest to the whole
interior. The location of these re-
cessed units must be planned to suit
the Store lay'out, so that the increased
light falls where it is required, and
does not merely produce meaningless
puddle of light on the floor.
By virtue of their dimensions,
fluorescent lamps are ideally suited to
use in recessed coves and troughs for
general lighting. When used in re'
cessed troughs, it is advisable to pro'
vide some additional indirect light, to
avoid excessive brightness contrast
between the troughs and the rest of
the ceiling. A well balanced combin'
ation of indirect and direct lighting
from built-in lighting units, will sat-
isfy both the functional and the aes-
thetic requirements of all types of
Store.
In any successful Store lighting
scheme, the first and most important
step is to decide on the method of
general lighting. The details of the
suplementary lighting will then be
largely determined by selling problems
of the particular Store.
LIGHT, AND STORE SALES.
Paper No. 3:
By F. C. BAKER,
Lighting Engineer, Drysdale Electric Fty. Ltd.
The keynote of modern store light'
ing is LIGHT FOR SELLING. It
has been proved repeatedly that good
lighting is a definite sales aid. How-
ever, it is important to note that an
abundance of light does not necessar'
ily guarantee successful selling light.
Mathew Lukiesh, one of the most
prominent lighting engineers of the
20th century, states: “Good lighting
is general lighting-plus". Speakers
who talk in monotones are boring to
their listeners and likewise, one level
or monotone store lighting is poor
sales lighting.
It has been estimated that 50% of
customers do not speak to a sales as-
sistant until they are ready to proffer
the money, and in some stores of the
market type this percentage is even
higher. It is evident, then, that the
customers’ attention must be drawn
to the special lines which are displayed
for quick sales.
Light makes merchandise not only
seeable, but enhances its main features:
its colour, texture, form and work'
manship Each feature demands spec'
ial attention from the lighting engin-
eer, and in the large retail store,
lighting must often be “tailor made”

for individual departments.
The lighting engineer has an ini'
mense armoury to provide this light
for selling. He can provide light to
suit every article that is manufactured,
be it diamonds, silver plate, ladies’
wear, hardware, meat or drapery. He
can artificially create any atmospheric
condition —the seashore, a ballroom,
a wedding reception. He has the
use of coloured light in thousands of
shades to suit any colour of merch'
andise or of store decoration. He
can use shadows, reflections, refrac'
tions, silhouettes, mirrors, highlights,
spotlights and coloured spots to aid
character to the merchandise. The
lighting engineer can provide condi'
tions which will display the merchan'
dise in its best possible light.
In the retail store each department
has its special needs. Evening gowns
must be displayed in soft lighting.
Flowers require lighting which empha'
sises their natural colours and their
freshness. The pile of carpets must
be highlighted. The “sheen’’ on vel-
vet, satin, silk, brocades, chiffon, taf'
feta and shantung must be emphasis'
ed. Men’s evening dress must be
lighted in such a manner as to high'
light the strong contrast between
black and white. Glassware and silver
plate must have sparkle and life,
lewellery, particularly diamonds, must
have over-emphasised sparkle. Light-
ing for meat must pay particular at-
tention to the inherent red colour of
the particular merchandise. High
brightness in polished furniture and
motor car bodies must be avoided.
There are a thousand and one prob-
lems in the store for the lighting en-
gineer to solve.
Often, items which are displayed in
show cases, wall cases or shelves, are
removed for closer inspection before
purchase. It is important that the
display and its environment should
be illuminated to a suitable colour,
level and quality so that the merchan-
dise will suffer no major change in
appearance when examined apart
from the actual display.
Colour plays an important part in
the purchase of many things from
stockings and curtain material to mo-
tor cars, and lighting which fails to
reveal the goods in their true colours
is often responsible for customer dis-
satisfaction. Goods to be used out of
doors must be displayed under light-
ing simulating daylight; but goods
normally used under artificial light
must be displayed in lighting condi-
tions similar to those in which they
will be used.
Remember, the object of a store
lighting installation is to enable the
customers to see the merchandise, and
the merchandise should be seen in its
best possible light. This is the es-
sence of Light for Store Sales.
LIGHT, AND STORE DISPLAYS.
Paper No. 4:
By F. de COURCY GRIBBLE,
Senior Lighting Consultant, Consolidated Neon Limited
The illumination of window and
showcase displays contributes largely
to the success of retail merchandising.
It is, therefore, most important to
plan it with care, and only after a
survey of the display areas, and with
a complete knowledge of the type of
merchandise to be displayed.
Display windows of the leading re'
tail stores present outstanding ex'
amples of the window dressing art, and
are, almost invariably, illuminated to
accentuate the character or special fea'
tures of the merchandise displayed.
These beautifully staged tableaux
are the result of the combined efforts
of several departments—the display
manager, window dressers and elec'
tricians, all experts at their respective
occupations.
Obviously, considerable thought
has been devoted to the preparation
of the displays, and further thought
to the adequate illumination of them
to assure successful results.
Proof of the successful window dis'
play can be gauged by the number of
people attracted to the window, plus
those who enter the store to make a
purchase of the merchandise so at'
tractively displayed. Display manag'
ers and window dressers are well ac'
quainted with the science of colour
dynamics and can, by co-operation
with the lighting engineer, design a
window resulting in harmony of il-
lumination and display.
Very few people would even pause
to look at the best of window dis'
plays if it were not for the adequate
illumination which provides them with
easy visibility of the window’s con'
tents. But, everyone must have ex'
perienced the difficulty of seeing the
goods displayed in a poorly lighted
shop window, mostly due to “mirror
effect’’, which is the arch enemy of
window dressers.
Mirror effect, which is more pro-
nounced on bright sunny days, can
be overcome in several ways, but in
order to reduce it to a minimum and
to obtain comfortable seeing we must
do at least two things, which are di'
rectly related to the illuminated win'
dow display. First, we must increase
the artificial lighting inside the win'
dow to an efficiency which will enable
it to fight its battle with natural day'
light on more equal terms.
Secondly, when and where possible,
the display should be arranged with
light coloured merchandise.
White materials reflect considerably
more light than black or darker
colours.
The more light reflected from the
surface of any object or material the
easier it is to see.
Just as there is no light without
colour there can be no colour with'
out light.
Light coloured objects are therefore
better equipped to match the reflec'
tion on the window from the outside
daylight.
Comfortable visibility during day'
light hours will attract more attention
to the display.
We do not care to press our noses
against the window glass like a small
boy coveting jam tarts in the pastry'
cook’s window.
Window lighting should be flexible,
permitting of changes in light output
as the outside and inside changing
conditions demand.
When the lighting installation is
planned, it should be planned to give
the best results during daylight hours
of trading. Provision should be made
for switches to control the flexibility
of the light sources. 30 per cent, of
the available artificial lighting can be
dispensed with for night time display,
for then there is a truce between the
daylight and artificial light.
Flexibility of the lighting will per-
mit of changes in display from light
colours to objects and materials of
darker colours.
When reducing window illumina'
tion for night time display it is ad'
visable to make the change from max'
imum light output to a lesser volume
of light without losing the desirable
level lighting. This, of course, is pos'
sible by using multiple switches. High
levels of illumination can be attained
with fluorescent without having to
consider the heat factor, but fluores'
cent lighting for window display is
not at all times satisfactory. Some dis-
plays call for a certain lustre which
the fluorescent tube lacks, owing to
the deviation of the natural spectrum.
Taking this into consideration,
fluorescent lighting can still be given
preference for shop window illumina'
tion. The shop window being re'
garded as distinctive to the larger re-
tail store windows. It should be un-
derstood that fluorescent light con'
tains considerably less of the infra'
red, which is so pronounced in incan-
descent lamps, and accounts for our
being less conscious of a given intern
sity of fluorescent as we are of the
44

same light levels of incandescent
light.
This also explains the lack-lustre
and flat appearance of fluorescent
lighting which although undoubtedly
excellent for office and factory task
areas, does often require supplement-
ing with the incandescent lamp when
applied to some window displays
High wattage incandescent should
be used with discretion if the win-
dow display comprises perishable mer-
chandise which is subject to a dyeing
and bleaching effect.
Modern window lighting can be
initially expensive, and it is because of
the prevailing tendency to reduce lu-
mens in terms of £. s. d. that we see
some deplorable examples of shop
window lighting. A lighting installa-
tion is carefully planned to provide
lighting for a specific purpose. To
bargain with the lighting engineer on
price must place the onus on the
prospective user who has refused to
accept professional advice.
Economising on pounds means
economising on lumens, which is
false economy and should be left well
alone, or it will prove a very poor in-
vestment. The fewer the lumens the
fewer the sales so far as window dis-
play is concerned.
Display, of course, includes show-
case lighting, for which first prefer-
ence must be given to fluorescent
tubes of either system.
Fluorescent tubes are efficient for
most showcase displays, as the tubes
create a minimum of heat and can
be installed in limited spaces in close
proximity to merchandise (even of a
perishable nature). Tubes can be fit-
ted to the showcase in tailor made
fashion, but still, the application of
fluorescent tubes must be approached
with caution.
Again, as with window display, it is
essential to plan the illumination to
suit the contents of the showcase. A
discussion with the display manager
or person responsible for the show-
case display will assist the lighting en-
gineer to plan with the type of tube
most suited to the particular display.
The application of one type of
fluorescent tube could be ideal for cer-
tain merchandise but totally unsuit-
able to the display of other wares.
A prospective customer may be at-
tracted to the showcase by the display
of a certain coloured garment. This
garment will perhaps blend with a
colour scheme mentally visualised by
the prospective customer.
The prospective customer will re-
quest a closer inspection of the gar-
ment, which, when removed from the
showcase, is displayed under different
lighting. A change in colour shade
is immediately perceived, the prospect
customer loses interest and the sales
assistant loses a sale.
~. . .
This has been due either to care'
less planning of the lighting or the
display of the wrong merchandise. If
the showcase is intended for the sole
purpose of display the illumination
calls for a distinctive degree or intern-
sity, but if for both display and sell-
ing of merchandise it is advisable to
maintain even levels of lighting in
keeping with the store’s general light-
ing scheme. Showcase lighting that
sets up the slightest sales resistance at
the point of sale is very expensive in'
deed, but well planned lighting in
the point of sale showcase is econ'
omical at any price .
Window and showcase lighting can-
not be successfully planned without
co-operation between the display man
and the lighting engineer, who must
be acquainted with the tyne of men
chandise it is proposed to display,
Wherever possible keep the lumens up
and insure against uncomfortable see-
ing for both window and showcase
displays. It will show dividends.
LIGHT, AND STORE ADVERTISING.
Paper No. 5:
By F. E. SWIFT,
Field Sales Superintendent, Claude Neon Ltd.
Store advertising covers a very wide
field indeed in the large Departmental
Store. There are so many mediums
that have their part in attracting buy-
ers to the Store, whether it be by cat-
alogue, press, advertising, mannequin
parades, radio, direct mail, letters,
folders, pamphlets, specialist displays
—each have their part in bringing the
Store, its name, goods and services
to the attention of the public on whom
the Store depends for its existence
and patronage.
These are external sides in promo-
tional selling, and such mediums are
those in which the store advertising
executive is usually very well versed
and need no amplification.
We, tonight, are concerned primar-
ily with Light in relation to Store
Advertising—a subject of vital im-
portance.
For example take the smaller stores
and specialist shops in both City and
Suburbs as distinct from the Chain
and Department Stores —the latter
have the aid of all or many of the
Advertising media referred to earlier
to induce customers to the Store,
whereas the majority of the smaller
shops have to rely very largely on
compelling attention of potential cus-
tomers to their shop or store through
the medium of window and shop dis-
play.
Everything possible should be done
to attract attention to store location
and display, and there is no medium
as capable of attracting the eye than
lighting in various forms.
Exterior and Interior Neon Displays
are almost indispensable to the mod-
ern store as a medium to attract at-
tention of potential customers within
visual range of store location. They
can, and do, compel the eye from a
distance, when the store itself and its
goods are invisible. This ensures a
reminder and location value. The
law of averages must inevitable guar-
antee a higher percentage of resultant
business to the shop or store, which
can attract the eye of the majority of
the public, whereas the retailer, with-
out the aid of such a media, is pen-
alised.
There is a prestige value attached
to the Neon Sign, as it is an indica-
tion that the store is keen to attract
business.
Flood lighting, Neon Outlining of
Awning Fascia and Under Awning
signs, all serve to attract attention.
Lastly, there is the notable fact that
a brightly illuminated frontage in-
duces an optimistic note that encour-
ages business.
There are many examples over the
past years where an enterprising con-
cern using bright and attractive Neon
Displays having taken premises in an

area which beforehand was infre'
quently used by the public, has in'
duced a flow of people to the loca-
tion drawn by the attraction value of
the exterior display, resulting ulti'
mately in the shopping block being
transformed to a thriving business
centre —largely through the medium
of the attention compelling value of
the lighting of the store frontages.
Naturally, these but serve to draw
attention to the store itself and its
goods, which need frequently chang'
ed window displays brilliantly ilium'
inated, together with correctly but
brightly lit interiors to compel the
eye to the goods displayed, making
the most of their sales appeal, and in'
ducing the purchasing impulse for
which they were created.
Advertising through Light often re'
quires a different angle of approach
to that of the purely technical engin'
eering theory.
It could almost be said you cannot
have too much light in Store adver'
tising, providing it is skilfully arrang'
ed in relation to the type of goods
displayed. The quantity of illumina'
tion has often to be varried according
to the class of goods and sections of
the Store —uniform standards are not
always desirable.
The large store with its facilities in
space and window display, is giving
more attention to this vital sales pro'
motion medium.
Have you not often heard the ladies
comment: Have you seen Blanks’
Spring Windows? If a husband you
may have winced, fearing that these
self'same windows will be the means
of lowering the bank balance, that
Displays Man and Lighting Engineer
will be responsible, but as good, keen
retailers, you can recompense your-
selves by doing just that same thing.
Good lighting backed by effective
methods of displaying your goods can
compel the casual shopper to stop in
front of your Store, examine the
goods, and be influenced to a buying
mood.
We venture to state that if you
carefully analyse the percentage of
business attributable to various store
advertising aids, you will realise that
the greatest of these is the influence
of window and shop displays to com'
pel sales on the spot.
LIGHT, AND STAFF MORALS AND EFFICIENCY.
Paper No. 6:
By T. M. McCOURT,
Lighting Engineer, Philips Electrical Industries Limited.
I have endeavoured unsuccessfully
to obtain facts and figures dealing with
the effect of light on staff morale and
efficiency which had their origin in
the investigations of overseas author'
ities in England, Europe, and Amer-
ica. Much to my surprise I found
such facts and figures unavailable and
therefore the information I intend to
put before you is based on a personal
survey of retail stores of all kinds in
our City and Metropolitan area. I
have discussed this subject with Store
Executives and people in all walks of
life in an endeavour to obtain the re'
actions of a cross section of the public
to the effect of better lighting on re'
tail store staff. This is what I found;
When the illumination problems in
a store have been satisfactorily solved
the following factors, all tending to
increase staff efficiency are apparent.
(1) The improved lighting pro'
motes cleanliness and tidiness
in display cases, on counters,
etc.
(2) It reduces errors in dockets and
on each registers.
(3) It promotes greater care of
goods displayed.
(4) It promotes greater attention
to personal dress of staff.
The immediate effects of the above
can be classified as follows:
There is an immediate improve'
ment in the appearance of the sales
areas. Stock is not left lying on
counters after the completion of a
sale which results in less spoilage of
goods. Odds and ends of paper and
string, etc-, are not left lying about
to become tangled in the feet of staff
or customers. In hardware stores
particularly there is far less risk of
minor accidents occurring to either
staff or customers, e.g., torn or stain'
ed clothing. The effect of this, of
course, is reflected in fewer claims on
the management for repair or replace'
ments of clothing.
The reduction in errors on sales
dockets, etc., means there is less time
taken up in checking dockets and
much time saved in the preparation
of customers’ accounts, etc. In bulk
areas, delivery section, etc., stock cards
and lists are more accurate, there is
less possibility of mistakes occurring
in the preparation of goods for deliv'
ery, goods are better packed and less
packing material is used.
The staff generally tends to take
greater care of goods displayed with
the result that articles being shown
to prospective purchasers are always
fresh and clean. Dust is not allowed
to collect on small counter displays
or price cards.
There can be no possible doubt that
properly planned lighting creates the
desire on the part of the staff to pay
greater attention to their personal ap'
pearance. For one thing, in a poorly
illuminated store it is not uncommon
to find the staff lounging over count'
ers, chatting in dark corners and, in
general presenting a careless appear'
ance. Where good lighting has been
installed the staff tends to stand up'
right, remain in their own section of
the counter area and always be pre-
pared to serve customers without de'
lay. Dress is always tidy; one does
not find ties half undone, waistcoasts
undone, patches of dust on clothing,
etc. A most important factor is that
the hands of sales personnel are kept
clean. Nothing offends a customer
so much as to have articles offered
for his or her inspection by a sales
assistant with dusty or dirty hands.
It is worth noting at this point that
one suburban storekeeper provided a
few mirrors with local lights behind
the fixtures. He found this encour'
aged the staff to maintain their stand'
ard of dress and personal cleanliness.
Purely from the morale side, the
brighter, more cheerful atmosphere of
the store creates a brighter, more
cheerful outlook on the part of the
staff which is reflected in the alert,
intelligent manner in which customers
are served. A greater volume of sales
is handled and they are handled speed'
ily and satisfactorily from the custom'
irs’ viewpoint, thus laying the foun'
dation for repeat business. A general
feeling of uplift caused by better light'
ing is very marked in the period im'
mediately after planned illumination
has been installed. Each member of
the staff begins to take an added pride
in his own section which tends to im'
prove punctuality. A salesman or wo'
man will often arrive a few minutes
early and spend that time putting
the final touches to the goods in his or
her section in preparation for the
day’s sales. Forward stock bins are
filled, counter displays renewed and
a host of other small matters given
attention which under the previous
poor lighting conditions had been ig'
nored. Interest of this nature breeds
a competitive spirit among the staff
which results, in the final accounting,
in increased turnover and profits. In
a like manner store delivery and ac'
counting staffs tend to follow the same
practice except that in these locations
it is more common to find the effect
shown in the staff’s desire to clean up
whatever they were doing before leav'
ing the premises even though this
may take an extra two or three min'
utes atter their usual finishing time.

■lt will be obvious that it is impos-
sible to clearly differentiate between
the effects of proper lighting on staff
morale and staff efficiency because
each has a direct bearing on the other.
Nevertheless I have attempted to do
so in this brief resume of facts.
To any observer who takes the
trouble to investigate the position the
basis for the statements I have made
on this subject can be seen at every
hand. It must be remembered, how-
ever, that only planned lighting can
achieve these results, the mere fact
of increasing illumination levels
throughout the store is not good
enough because, unless consideration
is given to the problems of brightness
and correct distribution of the light,
then it is only too easy to obtain the
direct reverse of the benefits men-
tioned.
LIGHT, AND STORE MAINTENANCE.
Paper No. 7;
By G. Y. FALK,
Lighting Engineer and Electrical Contractor, Planned Lighting
Company.
When calculations are made by the
lighting engineer to solve the many
different problems that arise in the
lighting design of interiors, he can
use several different methods. What-
ever method or formula he finally de-
cides to use, there is always a factor,
known as the maintenance factor, to
be taken into consideration. This
maintenance factor is the allowance
that must always be made for the de-
preciation of the light output from
lamps and fittings whilst in service.
As a guide the average lighting levels
in service will be in the vicinity of
60%-70% of the initial value.
The object of lighting maintenance
is to maintain the lighting level, that
is, the number of foot candles of il-
lumination that has been chosen by
the engineer as being suitable for the
task in hand; whether it be for the
high-lighting of some specialised show-
cases or windows, or for general illum-
ination over traffic areas, or for any
of the other diverse applications of
lighting which would be found
throughout a modern retail store.
The Lighting Fitting.
Let us start with the selection of
the lighting fitting. In order to do
this it is essential that the fitting be
chosen so that it can be cleaned and
serviced with the minimum of effort,
and of such design that it will con-
tinue to serve and maintain its ap-
pearance even though it requires hand-
ling at intervals.
This particular point of “servicing”
after installation has been completed
should be discussed (before the ulti-
mate choice of fitting has been made)
with the electrical contractor, who will
be in a position to advise in consulta-
tion with the lighting engineer what
would be the best method of fixing
and the convenient heights at which
the fittings should be installed for
ease, of relamping and other mainten-
ance.
First point—To maintain the intended
level of lighting.
The owner or management of the
store has made considerable financial
investment in his lighting installation
to provide a considered level of il-
lumination. The collection of dust,
failing light and blackened out lamps
is wasted money. Only by regular
maintenance will the light be kept at
the correct foot candle level.
Second point—Maintenance of the
appearance of the installation:
For a progressive store the appear-
ance of ill-kept fixtures can result in
making a complete store look untidy.
Fixtures should be cleaned at regular
intervals.
Third point—To keep maintenance
costs down to the minimum:
We are all well aware of the increas-
ing cost of labour today. It is well-
known that this is usually more costly
than the actual parts required to main-
tain the installation. It is therefore
necessary that a maintenance plan
should be instituted for every installa-
tion so that labour costs are kept down
to a minimum.
To illustrate this point we will
take the replacement of lamps. This
can be done by two methods, the
group replacement, or individual lamp
replacement.
Group Replacement.
By group replacement we mean
that all the lamps are replaced at the
one time. When the lamps are ap-
proaching the end of their normal
average life all lamps are removed
and a completely new set is installed.
This has the advantage that labour
cost is greatly lessened, all lamps be-
ing replaced at the one time, and
the appearance of the whole of the
lighting installation is kept bright and
at an even level of appearance. If a
new lamp is inserted next to a lamp
approaching the end of its life, the
difference in light intensity can make
a fitting or installation look uneven.
A further saving of labour costs can
be made if group replacement of
lamps is made to coincide with the reg-
ular cleaning schedule.
Modern lamps (incandescent and
fluorescent) are manufactured to have
a Stable average life and a replace-
ment time can be judged very suc-
cessfully.
Individual Lamp Replacement.
This method is to instal lamps as
they burn out. Even in this system,
quite suitable for small installations, it
is essential that dull lamps which are
obviously approaching the end of life
should be replaced at the same time
as this will reduce labour costs.
Inspections.
Regular inspections by the electri-
cal staff should be also instituted and
foot candle levels should be checked
at fixed points throughout the store
at regular six weekly intervals by
means of a convenient light meter.
Frequency of Cleaning.
How often should we clean fix-
tures? This can be judged by taking
foot candle readings over a particu-
lar area and repeating the same test
after a lapse of three months. The
difference between the first and sec-
ond readings will enable a percent-
age monthly depreciation to be cal-
culated, and the consumer will then
know what period of time may elapse
before cleaning is required.
A point that is often overlooked is
that even though a lighting installa-
tion is never used, it is still costing
money. There is depreciation going
on all the time, but one of the most
significant facts is that with the fix-
tures which are not properly main-
tained the electricity rate and amount
of kilowatt hours consumed is the
same as if the fixtures were cleaned
and working at maximum efficiency.
The account from the electricity sup-
ply authorities wil be the same,
though the difference in illumination
level between the maintained fixtures
and the dirty fixtures can be anything
up to a 50% drop. I have person-
ally seen illumination levels drop to
one-third of efficiency through lack
of maintenance and cleaning.
Therefore it is essential that man-
agements should see that lighting in-
stallations are covered by a planned
maintenance scheme in order to get
the maximum of efficiency from the
electricity light account and the in-
ital investment made; to maintain the
intended level of illumination; to
keep the appearance of the installa-
tion attractive; and to keep mainten-
ance costs themselves down to a min-
imum.

LIGHT, AND STORE ECONOMICS
Paper No. 8:
By L. H. BLUNT, A.S.T.C. (Elect.),
Maintenance Engineer, The Electricity Commission of N.S.W.
Once the layout and design of a
lighting installation has been deter-
mined, the final factor in the selection
of a lighting system is almost always
the cost. How much will it cost to
put the system in the premises and
how much will it cost to run; and
the cheapest installation is not by
any means always the best. Between
two or more systems of similar artis-
tic merit and lighting performance
the comparative costs of each system
becomes all important. A more ex-
pensive installation may be more ex-
pensive or less expensive to run than
a cheaper installation and only by re-
ducing the total costs to some common
denominator can any two systems be
satisfactorily compared.
There have, from time to time, been
put forward many schemes, more or
less elaborate, by which a computa-
tion of the costs of a lighting system
may be determined and to apply any
of the more involved schemes to the
various individual requirements of the
various departments of a retail store
can present a problem only appreciat-
ed by accountants. Any lighting sys-
tem, however, can be analysed quite
simply if the system is reduced to fun-
damental concepts, e.g.,
1. Costs are computed for equal
fot candle levels in actual service.
2. Equal operating conditions are
established.
3. Depreciation rates are standard-
ised.
4. Proper cleaning and maintenance
schedules are worked out for
each system.
5. Installation and maintenance
costs are related to uniform la-
bour costs.
Having established these funda-
mentals it becomes immaterial what
form the actual installation will take,
i.e., whether fluorescent or incandes-
cent or both, or whether the actual
lighting is direct or indirect, diffused
or reflected. The factors that influ-
ence the cost can be obtained from
the specifications for the installation
and are:
1. The rated initial lamp lumens
per luminaire and the number
of lamps.
2. The rated lamp life.
3. The average watts consumption
per lamp and of all auxiliaries
such as ballasts and transformers.
4. The calculated coefficient of
utilisation for the room and
luminaires.
5. The effective maintenance factor.
6. The effective maintained lu-
mens.
The costs of a lighting system are
divided into fixed costs or rather the
purchasing and owning costs, and
the operating and maintenance costs.
The fixed costs take in not only
the purchase price per fixture but
also such items as wiring costs, erec-
tion costs, costs of any structural al-
terations, and the costs of any archi-
tectural fixtures that are necessary.
These costs will be computed as an
annual cost after the estimated useful
life is established. It then becomes a
relatively simple matter for the fixed
costs to be transformed into a cost
per foot candle per square foot of
area to be lighted.
The operating costs take into ac-
count the cost of electrical energy,
the total burning hours per year, the
number of lamps to be replaced per
year and the labour charges for re-
placing the lamps. The maintenance
costs include such items as cleaning
costs and the costs of repairs and
maintenance to the lighting installa-
tion itself. The total annual costs
for operation and maintenance can,
as with the fixed costs, be computed
on a basis of the cost per foot candle
per square foot of areas to be lighted.
The above two costs form the math-
ematical basis on which anv two or
more lighting systems can be accur-
ately compared, but in a business such
as a retail store a third accountancy
problem arises when lighting or any
other improvement scheme is com
templated: this is. What return does
the Company get for the amount it
is intended to be spent?
Profits both tangible and intangible
arise from the installation of an at-
tractive and properly designed light-
ing system. The tangible profits arise
from the undoubted advertising value
of a well lit store and an artistically
designed layout. The attraction of
customers to a store should result in
a larger turnover and hence larger
profits. Goods properly displayed
with adequate lighting are more read-
ily sold and give better customer ser-
vice with less dissatisfaction when
viewed in daylight or under other
types of lighting.
The intangible profits arise from
increased goodwill, a smaller turn-
over in staff, the maintaining of a
proper level of illumination and the
psychological effect of always having
the lamps burning brightly.
A good deal of research has been
done in the United States of Amer-
ica on lighting costs in retail stores
and their effect on gross sales. It has
been determined that stores of high
annual turnover have a slightlv high-
er lighting cost percentage of sales
and that percentages vary according
to the productivity of the various de-
partments. The percentages vary
from 0.4% of gross sales for very
large department stores down to 0.2%
for smaller stores. It is only neces-
sary, however, to look around you
and make direct comparisons in our
own cities to be assured that the store
that is attractively and well lit has
a greater customer appeal and one
must conclude that, with proper plan-
ing and co-operation between all
Store's Departments and the Illum-
inating Engineer, the costs of an en-
gineered lighting installation will be
expressed on the Store’s balance
-heet by larger turnovers and higher
profits.

Builders’ Leader
Honoured
0.B.E. FOR Mr. FRED WILSON.
Her Majesty The Queen, in the
first Honours List of her reign, has
created Mr. Fred Wilson an Officer
of the Most Excellent Order of the
British Empire. Mr. Wilson, 0.8. E.,
F. 1.0.8., has given distinguished ser'
vice to the Building Industry over
more than forty years and has served
as President of the Master Builders’
Federation of Australia, President of
the Master Builders’ Association of
N.S.W. and Councillor of the Em'
plovers’ Federation. He occupies the
Chair of Building Industry Congress
for the eleventh year anl is a Coum
cillor of The Royal Agricultural
Society and the University of Tech'
nology.
Pays Tribute to Associates.
Interviewed on Thursday last, fob
lowing announcement of the Honour,
Mr. Wilson said “Naturally, I feel very
proud to be the recipient of such an
Honour at the beginning of a second
Elizabethan Era. But I feel that this
is not just an Honour conferred upon
me personally but a tribute to those
great organisations with which I have
been privileged to work over so many
years. No man could have better or
more satisfying reward than the esteem
of his fellows and moreover, no man
can compile a record of achievement
unless he has enjoyed the guidance and
help of his colleagues.”
An Open Mind.
Mr. Wilson’s success as President of
Building Industry Congress—which
comprises all sections of the Industry
—is attributed to the fact that he is
able to approach general and sectional
problems with an open mind. Mr.
O. D. A. Oberg, Charter President of
8.1. C., paid eloquent tribute to his
successor in tendering congratulations
to Mr. Wilson at the celebration of the
latter’s Tenth Anniversary in the Chair
of Congress. Mr. Oberg said: “You
have given outstanding leadership to
the Building Industry and have always
made a constructive approach to prob'
lems of a national character. Your
leadership has indeed been an inspira'
tion to all those associated with the
industry.’’
Mr. Wilson’s depth of sympathy and
understanding is probably explained by
the fact that he has travelled up the
hard way, for he served his apprentice'
ship as carpenter and joiner in the
North of England and came to Aus'
tralia as a journeyman forty years ago.
It is Mr. Wilson’s firm conviction that
every man should put something back
into the industry from which he gains
a livelihood. This is much more than
a precept with him, for he was a
principal mover in the formation of
The Australian Institute of Builders,
which was founded last year with
Mr. Wilson as Charter President.
He is an enthusiast about tech'
nical education, and in addition
to his duties as Councillor of the
University of Technology, he is Vice'
Chairman of the Sydney Technical
Education District Council. The Pres'
ident of Congress in Victoria, Mr. D.
B. Doyle said: “Mr. Fred Wilson has
assisted in bringing the construction
side of the Building Industry a high
ethical practice which has contributed
a great deal in welding the interests
of all sections so that it might better
carry out its responsibilities.”
It is indeed a compliment to the
Building Industry that this distinguish'
ed leader has been thus honoured and
all sections of the industry will join in
congratulating him and wishing him
good health to enjoy this welhdeserved
tribute.
PREFAB. HOUSE SANDWICH.
Sandwich panels are undergoing
tests at the U.S. Forest Products
Laboratory for house construction.
Core material, similar to brown kraft
paper, is treated with synthetic resin,
corrugated, and glued together in a
honeycomb. Thin metal, plywood,
veneer or other material covers core.
The completed panels are light and
easy to handle. The material has been
used in a radiant'heated test house.

Timber Preservation
Prevents Fungi
and Decay
By J. HENRY HUGHES
D.For. (U.C.N.W.)
The Australian Wood Pipe Co.
Ltd.).
In undeveloped countries such as
Australia not so many years ago
heavily forested areas were once
considered to be a natural barrier to
the development of desirable agricuh
ture and dairying within economic dis'
tance to areas of consumer markets.
The manner in which some of our
forests were liquidated during the early
days of development is well known.
As long as a country is heavily tim-
bered, or thought to be so, conserva'
tive methods of utilising the timber
will rarely be practised.
Large areas of our forests of natur-
ally durable timbers were felled, and
little or no thought originally given
to the problems or need for replace'
ment of the forest by conserving and
tending the natural regeneration of
desirable species, which were present
in the felling areas.
In due time as exploitation ex-
tended, transportation costs involved
in getting the logs to the mills and
lumber to the consumer markets be-
came prohibitive in some areas, and
the remaining forests became tern'
porarily unrealisable assets.
On the basis of economics, it is not
feasible to grow species of naturally
durable hardwoods as a commercial
crop until such times as they attain
the large dimensions seen in our vir'
gin forests. Instead of a natural ro-
tation resulting in sound trees of larg-
est possible dimensions, with the ex'
ception of trees grown by the State
for special purposes, appropriate fi'
nancial rotations must prevail, with
due regard to the ultimate use of the
timber. Similarly, plantations of ex'
otic \conifers are subject largely to
financial rotations.
Thus the logs produced from sciem
tifically managed forests and planta'
tions must of necessity in the future
be received with smaller overall dimen'
sions and contain a higher proportion
of sapwood to heart'wood. The
majority of species composing the
stands in our softwood scrubs have a
very high proportion of sapwood to
heart'wood, and naturally are highly
subject to decay, and a large proper'
tion of the wood susceptible to borer
attack.

(continued from page 49)
Nevertheless, research has shown
that the mechanical properties of sap'
wood and heart'wood, when seasoned,
do not differ greatly and for many
practical purposes on the basis of
strength, sapwood can be used to the
same extent as heartwood, particularly
in the furniture trade.
Although sapwood contains starch
—the content of which varies with
the species—and other elements which
are food for borers, fungi and white
ants, it can be made absolutely ini'
mune to attack by proper treatment
with a suitable preservative. There'
fore our scrubwood forests, containing
large quantities of strong and decora'
tive timbers, many of which by vir'
tue of their easy workability, strength
properties and permeability are emin'
ently suitable alternative species to
Baltic and Oregon, imported hard'
woods and our more difficult to ob'
tain native durable hardwoods, can
be made available to the Trade and
Industry when given suitable treat'
ment, preferably with an alhpurpose
preservative.
Timber preservation may be defin'
ed as the art of treating timbers in
order that they may be immune from
attack by all natural timber'destroy'
ing agencies. The earliest records of
the artificial preservation of organic
bodies are found in Egyptian history.
The skill shown by the Egyptians in
embalming bodies proves that they
carried the art to a high state of per'
fection. Apparently, the wooden cof'
fins, often of Sycamore, in which the
bodies were placed were given no
special treatment, so that their dura'
bility can be accounted for only by
the exclusion from the wood of suf'
ficient moisture which would norm-
ally allow growth of wood'destroying
organisms.
The comparatively rapid decay of
timber in British warships probably
gave timber preservation its first great
impetus. It is reported that 40 acres
of Oak forest were required to con'
struct a 70'gun ship, and as it prob'
ably took from 150 to 250 years for
some of the Oak to become suitable
for shipbuilding purposes, it is obvh
ous that the need to make the timber
last in service as long as possible was
an important matter.
Timber preservatives are substances
which, when suitably applied to tim'
ber, make it resistant to attack by
fungi, insects, borers and white ants,
although not all preservatives are
capable of giving alhpurpose protec'
tion. Preservatives may be grouped
into three general classes: (a) Pre-
servative oils, or mixtures of oils
that are of low volatility and only
slightly soluble in water; (b) inor'
ganic salts and similar preservative ma-
terials that are used in water solution;
(c) toxic spirit soluble preservatives.
Modern timber preservatives should
be toxic to all natural timber destroy'
ers, should be permanent and fibre'
fixed, highly penetrative, safe to
handle and to use in a treatment plant,
and not cause corrosion of metals.
They should not injure the timber,
and treated timber should be safe to
handle, easy to stain, varnish, paint,
enamel, polish and glue, and be odor'
less, and not increase machining dif'
Acuities, and in many instances should
not enhance the fire risk but rather
act as a fire retardant.
The effectiveness of a preservative
depends largely upon its toxicity, but
toxicity alone will not give desired
protection and must be coupled to
depth of penetration by the preserva'
tive into the timber. Depth of pene'
tration is most important.
There are several methods of treat'
ment applied today, among which the
most widely used are: Brush and spr?
application, dipping, steeping and dif'
fusion, hot'and'cold bath, and vacuum
pressure impregnation with its several
modifications, resulting in either full
or empty cell treatment.
The acknowledged, most satisfact'
ory method of timber impregnation in
commercial practice today is that
which incorporates vacuum and pres-
sure. It is by this method only that
fully controlled, scientific treatment
is possible. This method incorporates
the use of a steel pressure cylinder
into which partially dried timber
stacked on bogies is wheeled, and the
cylinder door closed. Vacuum is ap'
plied in order to extract air from the
cylinder and the cells of the wood.
The cylinder is duly flooded with the
preservative and vacuum broken. lim
pregnation of the timber is continued
by the use of a pressure pump cap'
able of exerting pressures up to 200
lb. per square inch, which forces the
preservative right into the timber.
When desirable penetration has been
achieved, surplus preservation is drawn
from the cylinder and a short vacuum
applied to the timber, the cylinder
door opened and the timber removed.
Timber impregnated with a widely
tested and approved preservative and
applied by the vacuum'pressure meth'
od under the control of highly train'
ed operators, is the best timber pre'
servation service which can be given
to'day.

Camera In Industry
Does Many Jobs
Cheaply
The still camera can be a most use'
ful, vet expensive, tool in industry if
used intelligently.
Here are a few examples of its use
in the U.S.: —
• Plomb Tool Co., Ohio, takes in'
ventory by camera. Steel bars in the
stockroom are no longer counted.
Instead, they are photographed.
From enlarged prints, stock clerks
count the number of bars and post
inventory sheets. Preliminary lining
up of stock in the racks and measur'
ing odd lengths are done in advance.
• A large West Coast timber yard
uses the same photography method
to stock'take its timber stocks. It
claims that many hours of tedious
counting is saved.
• An explosion caused by a leaky
valve demolished the core room at
one of the American Brake Shoe
Company s plants. Photographs were
taken from all possible angles and
prints were forwarded to every foun'
dry in the company. After main'
tenance workers saw the prints, a
gratifying number of leaky valves
were repaired.
• One large foundry in the U.S.
follows a standard practice of record'
ing photographically every step in
building special apparatus. Subse'
quent duplication or replacement is
greatly simplified.

IMPRESSIONS OF THE WEST
“PROGRESS AND ENTERPRISE EVIDENT”, SAYS MR. MILES.
Success of Builders’ Registration.
Recently returned from a business
and holiday tour of Western Australia,
the President of the Council of Sub'
urban Master Builders’ Associations,
Mr. W. A. Miles, is loud in his praise
for the building progress and enter'
prise evident in the West.
“It seems a different world altogether
in Western Australia,” Mr. Miles told
our reporter.
“There are signs of building enter'
prise evident wherever I visited.”
“Building materials manufacturers
are showing an abundant faith in the
future of the State, and are stepping
up production to meet current and
future demands.
“Although brickyards are behind
with orders, they are now catching up
with production,” Mr. Miles said.
“A new factory is making fibro
cement sheets, and Wunderlich is
erecting a new tile factory near Perth.
“Builders have been up against a
shortage of steel and water pipes, as
well as wall tiles and hardboard; all
materials which have to be imported
into the State,” Mr. Miles pointed out.
“However,” he added, “the State
Government is seeking solutions to
these particular supply problems.”
Registration of Builders.
This Journal questioned Mr. Miles
regarding the W.A. Registration of
Builders’ Act, and sought information
concerning its operation.
Mr. Miles said that builders regis'
tered under the W.A. Act “‘are very
happy about it.”
“A few points in the Bill when it
was first presented have been since
ironed out,” Mr. Miles continued.
“Everybody is satisfied now.”
“Taken altogether, the W.A. build'
ers concerned are most happy to work
under the Act.”
(The Act only embraces builders
within a 25'mile radius of Perth.
Builders in other districts are not re'
quired to register.)
Mr. Miles said the Act has operated
for some years to the decided advant'
age of builders.
He pointed out that the Act is ad'
ministered by a Builders’ Registration
Board, of which the State Government
Architect is chairman, supported by
representatives of the M.B.A. and
building trade unions.
To become a registered builder, it
was necessary to pass a “stiff” examina'
tion, Mr. Miles said.
In his opinion, the exam, was too
difficult, and consequently made ad'
mission fairly easy for one class of
builder, who was largely without prac'
tical building experience, but fresh
from his Technical College education.
“The experienced builder, with
years of practical work behind him,
finds himself ‘all at sea’ when it comes
to theory,” Mr. Miles commented.
“But in my opinion, the ordinary
builder who works up through the
ranks to his own business, makes the
best Master Builder,” Mr. Miles said.
“I think that the emphasis on theory
and not on practical work is wrong
as regards registration of builders,”
he added.
Guide for N.S.W.
Mr. Miles was asked for his views
on registration of builders in N.S.W.
“I’m all for it,” he replied.
“But N.S.W. should set up a Reg'
istration Reference Board, which would
consider each application on its merits
by investigating the applicant’s actual
building background, inspecting his
completed constructions, and paying
due attention to both his financial pos'
ition and his position in the com'
munity.
“In short, it should use the same
procedure as obtains when admitting
builders to our own Association mem'
bership.
“I am earnest in saying that the prac'
tical man is the man who is wanted,
and who is the greatest asset to the
industry,” Mr. Miles added.
Constitution of Board.
Mr. Miles suggested that the Refer'
ence Board be comprised of the State
Government Architect as Chairman,
supported by representatives from the
M.8.A., the Council of Suburban
M.B.A.’s and trade unions.
“But they must not put the stress
on theory instead of practical work,”
he said.
“In my opinion, W.A. made that
mistake, and the admission section is
wrong, as it provides for the few (who
can pass in theory) and not for the
majority, whose school days are far
behind them. They are at a distinct
disadvantage in this respect.”
Powers of Board.
Mr. Miles said that a legally com
stituted Board could call upon any
builder to give an explanation of his
conduct, and it would protect both
the industry and the client in every
wav.
When we mentioned the question of
Fidelity Bonds, Mr. Miles commented;
“Fidelity Bonds are not necessary.
“A good builder does not require
bonds to do a good job.
“Register the men who are good
builders and w e will lift the status
of the industry 100 per cent, in the
estimation of the public,” he added.
Mr. Miles considers that the W.A.
registration of builders within a 25
mile radius of Perth is too narrow in
scope.
“Outside that radius anyone can
build anywhere,” Mr. Miles said.
“To function properly, registration
must be state-wide, as we hope it will
soon be in N.S.W.”, he added.
Progress Evident.
Mr. Miles gathered many vivid ini'
pressions during his tour of the West.
He was particularly impressed by the
fact that “all builders were very busy
and very happy.”
“There is still plenty of work avail'
able and the scope appears unlimited,”
he said.
“They are building really nice types
of homes, at prices much under what
they’d cost in N.S.W., but bricks and
other building materials are cheaper in
the West.

POWER BEHIND
PRODUCTION
ROW CO BUSTRIBU
FLEXIBLE and EFFICIENT
The Power Behind Production can be quickly and
inexpensively harnessed with the modern ROWCO
BUSTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
It can be re-arranged, dismantled and re-erected
speedily without the fuss and waste of materials associa-
ted with conduit or duct wiring systems.
It meets the needs of the modern factory. Re-arrange-
ment of machines and equipment to suit variations of
production runs, installation of additional machines, etc.,
s a simple matter.
Extensions, alterations, even the removal of an entire
plant to new or permanent premises can ba made with
a flexibility that cannot be offered by other power dis-
tribution systems.

“I repeat that all builders in the
West are more than happy, and labour
is good, willing, and ample for re'
quirements.
“Builders don’t have to advertise
‘incentives’ to attract labour, either,”
Mr. Miles commented.
Buildings.
Speaking of the new Perth Hos'
pital, Mr. Miles said it was “an ab'
solute credit to the State.”
“The main building is finished and
in use and two new wings are being
added,
“Tenders have recently been let for
a Repatriation Hospital,” he said.
“The Housing Board is doing a
good job but private enterprise is also
doing a good job and doing it well,”
Mr. Miles continued.
“New suburbs are being built all
the time. One suburb consists almost
entirely of War Service Homes, and
nice looking, too.
“Another suburb contains Austrian
precut homes, plus a few large pre'
fabs. among them.
“They look quite well in their set'
tings, and are being erected by Aus'
trian workmen, who are well'housed
and welhcatered for.
“The people of the West show
plenty of enterprise and have the
energy to back it up.
“We in the East could learn a les'
son or two from them, such as reg'
istering builders and advancing the
progress of our State in many ways,”
Mr. Miles concluded.
FIREPROOF “SANDWICH"
DOOR.
The U.S. Plywood Corporation has
produced a l|in. thick fireproof
“sandwich” door. It is made of stan'
dard hardwood faces and cross'bond'
ing laminated to an incombustible
core with waterproof glue. The core
is made of lime, silica and asbestos,
and has a coefficient of heat transfer
of 0.47 B.t.u. per sq. ft. per in. of
thickness per degree at a mean tern'
perature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
MEASURING AIR IN CONCRETE.
In less than 10 minutes, the amount
of entrained air in concrete is deter'
mined by a new meter developed by
the U.S. Portland Cement Association.
A sample of fresh concrete is by hand
air pump subjected to pounds per
sq. in. in a test vessel. Since volume
of air varies inversely as pressure, the
volumetric percentage of entrained air
may be read from water reduction in
a graduated glass tube on the vessel.
Building A New
Britain
£540 Million Planning Scheme.
Thousands of Homes Will Go.
Scores of thousands of houses
throughout Britain are listed to be de'
molished, but most of the people who
live in them are unaware of it.
Many of the houses are old and
situated in slum'dearance areas. But
thousands are comparatively new, and
owned by people who bought them as
life investments.
Regardless of this, these houses
stand under sentence of demolition
through the far'sweeping Town and
Country Act of 1947. This Act aims
at building a new Britain for £540
million within 20 years —a planners’
dream of a Paradise without slums,
with rolling green belts and coni'
modious public buildings.
(This, on a minor scale, will hap*
pen in Sydney when the Cumberland
County Council’s Master Plan gets urn
der way.)
Compensation will be paid to
British home'owners on the basis of
what is called the “'existing use value”
of the property when the Act comes
into force. But, in the words of one
Ratepayers’ Association: “Quite apart
from the hardships inflicted on in'
dividuals, the plan means the freezing
or the immobilisation of millions of
pounds worth of property with all the
consequent complications.
“There will be a clash between the
valuation for death duties and the
actual realisable price of properties
directly affected and adjacent proper'
ties. Absolute chaos will result.”
Properties Listed.
Every town hall has lists showing
sites selected for compulsory purchase,
and these already number many thou'
sands. Under the Act every local plan'
ning Authority in Britain is required
to make its own plan and submit it
to the Ministry for approval.
Some idea of the scope of the Act
may be gained from the fact that 61
Authorities about half the total
number have submitted their plans,
and 31 public inquiries have been
held.
70.000 To Move.
Areas around London, where the
County Council’s development plan
will change the face of the Metropolis,
are probably the most affected.
During the next five years 70,000
people may be displaced. Objections
will be considered at a public inquiry
during the coming months.
The planning of the London of the
future will affect specific communities
which are typical of others throughout
Britain.
In Chelsea, some 4150 residents
will be moved from their homes in
the next 18 years. The local councils
are objecting to the London County
Council against the number of schools
planned on the grounds that it would
mean turning many people out of
sound houses.
Greenwich Authorities estimate that
the population will be reduced from
15.000 to 7000, while in Blackheath
70 houses are affected on one estate
alone.

don County Council, has taken more

CANTILEVERING IN REINFORCED CONCRETE BUILDINGS.
The novel-looking building on the left was erected at a construction industry exhibition at
Hanover, Germany. It is now to have an outer glass wall for the upper floor and be used
permanently as a restaurant. Both upper floor and roof are carried on three beams cantilever-
ing from three columns placed about 6 feet from the centre of the circle of which the
building forms a sector. The outer radius is 78ft. 9in. The roof consists of three thin con-
crete shells. Total floor area is 2920 sq. ft. Prestressed reinforcement was employed in the
construction. The second picture shows cantilever beams to form a canopy over the loading
dock in a new building at . the D oulton pottery works at Stoke-on-[?]rent, England. The
ground floor is used for parking and general purposes with a 15ft. column spacing. The upper
floor is designed to carry two 320 ft. gas-fired tunnel kilns. A clear span of 85 feet is pro-
vided by concrete framing with precast purlins and eaves and gutters. Wind bracing is by
diagonal tie rods.

than three years to prepare, during
which more than 600 different or-
ganisations were consulted.
To further introduce the town plan-
ning scheme, the L.C.C. staged a
special exhibition, “London The
Next 20 Years,” which ran from
February 16 to March 30, during
which period all queries were answer-
ed by experts.
Said an official: “London house-

last hope for saving their homes has
gone if they failed to lodge an ob-

“This is not a wholesale grab of

Corrosion of Steel
in Steel Houses
British Research Report.
“The Corrosion of Steel in Steel
Houses’’* is a recent report by the
British Building Research Station of
a limited survey of steel-framed
houses built between 1920 and 1927.
The survey was undertaken to obtain
information on the efficiency of the
protective coatings applied to the
houses when they were erected.
Some 60 houses of eight different
types of construction were examined
in various parts of the country, and
the steelwork in many of the houses
had received no maintenance (apart
from the painting of exposed sur-
faces) since their erection.
The investigation covered the study
of details of design likely to permit
the penetration of moisture, the effec-
tiveness of protective coverings, the
effect of mechanical damage, the ex-
tent of atmospheric pollution and
other possible causes of corrosion. In
one case a rockery built to a height
of 18in. against the steel cladding of
the house caused serious corrosion.
The report concludes that two coats
of paint will provide adequate pro-
tection in wall cavities unless faults
of design permit rain to penetrate
into the cavities. Little condensation
was found in cavities, but in build-
ings with internal linings of high
thermal resistance special care should
be taken in protecting steelwork.
Faults in design leading to corro-
sion included steel stanchions erected
in contact with.wet clinker concrete
without previous protection of the
metal and the omission of watertight
jointing betwen sheets of cladding.
The report emphasises the impor'
tance of watertight window frames,
regular painting and the avoidance of
water traps at the base of the clad'
ding. In the absence of attention to
these points serious corrosion is like'
lv to take place.

Humanity in Housing
Britain Cares For Aged.
In Stoke Newington, London, there
is a recently-completed building which
at first glance appears to be a luxury
hotel, with bright, cheery rooms and
cheerful furnishings.
But the building is something more
than its outside appearance leads pas-
sers-by to believe; it is, in fact, a new
kind of home erected by the London
County Council for old people.
It is occupied by 92 genuinely
happy old folk who, in the twilight
of their lives, have found peace and
security.
New River Lodge the name of
the L.C.C. project is a far cry from
the old type of soul-searing institution
which people dreaded so much. The
main concern of the matron and her
staff is the welfare and comfort of
the men and women who reside there.
There are several small sitting-
rooms, a library and a needlewor
room, single and double bedrooms,
and bathrooms. Consideration has
been paid to many minor details:
floors are of non-slip cork tiles and
hand rails have been provided in cor-
ridors and on staircases. There is
even a special lounge for guests.
Residents may pay whatever thev
can afford for their home, although
the estimated cost per head is per
week. Even a laundry service is in-
cluded.
In the words of a L.C.C. member;
“It is humanity in housing at its best.”
THE EFFICIENT USE OF
STEEL IN BUILDING.
Lecture by Professor J. W. Roderick,
Professor J. W. Roderick, M.A.
M.Sc., Ph.D., A.M.1.C.E., Professor
of Civil Engineering at the University
of Sydney, will deliver a paper en-
titled “The Efficient Use of Steel in
Building” before the N.S.W. Chapter
of the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects at the Royal Empire So-
ciety Hall, 17 Bligh St., Sydney, on
Tuesday, July 22, 1952, at 8 p.m.
In view of the continual shortage
of steel the lecture on means of using
it to greater advantage should be of
particular interest to all architects,
builders and engineers.
Baxter’s Stone
Breakers
For Modern Quarries
Baxter’s 36" x 24" double toggle
stone breaker is ideal for modern
quarries for it embodies the patented
“knapping” action that is so desir-
able. This unit is a masterpiece of
strength and reliability and has per-
fect balance consistent with mini-
mum horsepower under the heaviest
load. All wearing parts are in man-
ganese steel and the machine is suit-
able for hopper or automatic feed.
The quantity of broken stones to
any size will be due in proportion
to the size required, i.e., a breaker
that the makers guarantee to break
eight tons per hour down to 2\ ,r
will break 6 tons per hour down to
1|" and 4 tons per hour down to
i 1 rr

New Esso Office Building.
The new office building recently completed
at Baton Rouge, U.S.A., for the Esso Standard
Oil Co. of Louisiana presents a striking ap-
pearance with its continuous windows covered
with deep “eyebrows” running along the fa-
cade, the messive “ribbon” walling in be-
tween and the streamlined out-burst on the
roof, which houses the air-conditioning sys-
tem. The whole effect—as indicated particu-
larly in the upper view—is reminiscent of the
flanks of a huge modern liner with squat
funnel dominating the superstructure.

BOOK REVIEW.
“How to Draw Perspectives to
Scale,” by W. H. Fuller. 64
pages. 55 figures. The Studio
Publications. English price,
3/6.
Even in spite of the increases that
have been inevitable since the war,
one never ceases to wonder at the low
price English books and the splendid
value of their technical publications.
This little book, for instance, is a
concise, welhillustrated and printed
treatise on a subject the knowledge
and mastery of which is of great im'
portance to draftsmen of all types,
either mechanical or architectural, and
all for 3/6 sterling.
This is a “how” and not a ‘“why”
book, for its very compactness pro'
hibits the subject being exhaustively
pursued and for this reason only essen'
tial principles are described, says the
author in the introduction, and to em
sure these principles being fully under'
stood, step'bv'Step diagrams have been
used to illustrate them.
All perspective is a means of show'
ing depth; scaled perspective, however,
is a means of showing depth by the
accurate placing of points and lines in
the field. Everything can be measured
with a rule, which is a welcome con'
trast to the usual trial and error
methods.
An excellent series of diagrams show
the method of developing the scaled
perspective drawing in two stages;
firstly, the setting'up of the space'
diagram, and then the finished draw'
ing. The examples cover all sorts of
objects from houses to machinery and
a flight of steps to a salt molecule.
The jacket has been cleverly utilised
as a space diagram and many of the
diagrams have been laid out to the
same scale.

War Service Homes
Set Record
Over 16,000 War Service homes
v.ere constructed at a cost exceeding
£2B million in the current financial
vear, the Minister for Social Services,
Mr. Townley, told Parliament recently.
This constituted an alhtime record,
he added.
Huge Increase.
The Minister quoted figures prov'
ing that up to January. 1950, an
annual average of 1818 War Service
homes had been provided and in the
last two years this figure had exceed'
ed 12,3000 —an increase of over 676
per cent.
This month the Government will
have provided £6O million for the
construction of War Service homes as
against £53 million by previous Gov'
crnments, the Minister said.
He added; “This is emphatic evfi
dence of this Government’s interest in
assistance to ex'servicemen because in
the past two years more money has
been spent on War Service homes
than in the previous 30 years.”

Few Buyers for
Commission Homes
The Minister for Housing, Mr.
Clive Evatt, stated recently that only
547 of 6727 tenants of N.S.W. Hous-
ing Commission homes had accepted
the Government’s offer to sell them
the homes they occupied.
The selling prices were determined
after valuations had been obtained
through the Rural Bank, Mr. Evatt
said.
He added::
“The reluctance of tenants to pur-
chase the homes has been brought
about by the calamitous credit restric-
tion policy of the Federal Govern-
ment.” (Ed.: Imposed a few months
ago, when previously they have taken
years to make up their minds. They
have a good reason now that will be
brandished everywhere. This only
goes to show that governments should
keep out of the landlord business.
When all those tenants fall upon evil
days, the Government—in other words
the taxpayers —will have to carry the
burden.)
Mr. Treatt Replies.
Answering this statement, the
Leader of the State Opposition, Mr.
V. H. Treatt, said that Mr. Evatt was
wrong in attributing the comparatively
small number of sales to Common-
wealth Government credit controls.
“The Government’s policy of sell-
ing its homes to tenants was announced
in January, 1948. According to the
Auditor-General, by June, 1949, the
Housing Commission had sold only
15 houses under the Commonwealth-
State Housing agreement,” Mr. Treatt
said.
“In 1949-50 it sold only 98. In
1950-51 it sold 122. This means that
a lot more homes must have been sold
in 1951-52, according to Mr. Evatt’s
total.
“But the credit restrictions were im-
posed during this period when a larger
number of homes were sold,” Mr.
Treatt added.
(The credit restrictions have been
i i force for less than a year.)

The Quality of Mercy
A shame-faced employee was sum-
moned to the office of the senior part-
ner to hear his doom. He expected
a blistering dismissal. He might be
sent to prison for years for what he
did.
The old man called his name and
asked if he was guilty. The clerk
stammered he had no defence.
“I shall not send you to prison,”
said the old man. “If I take you
back, can I trust you”?
When the surprised and broken
clerk had given assurance, and was
about to leave, the senior partner con-
tinued:
“You are the second man who has
fallen, and been pardoned in this bus-
iness. I was the first. What you have
done, I did. The mercy you have re-
ceived, I received. God have mercy
on us both!”

N.Z. Launches
Kaingaroa Forest
Project
Government and Private Enterprise
Join Forces.
A further stage in the utilisation of
New Zealand’s rapidly-growing tim-
ber is the co-operation of the Govern-
ment and private enterprise in a new
company to develop timber, news-
print and pulp industries based on the
Kaingaroa State Forest, states the
latest issue of the A.N.Z. Bank
“Quarterly Review.”
Estimates are that at least £l4 mil-
lion New Zealand currency will be
invested by the operating company
in the initial phase, of which the
Government has the right to sub-
scribe up to 15 per cent., the “Re-
view” continues^
Plans envisage a completely integ-
rated industry, from sawn timber,
newsprint, printing and writing
papers, and sulphate pulp.
The Government will undertake to
provide the company with 23 million
cubic feet of timber a year from the
Kaingaroa State Forest for 25 years,
and there may be extensions.
Kaingaroa State Forest is an exotic
coniferous forest located on the cen-
tral pumice plateau of the North
Island, south-east of Rotorua. Rain-
fall is 50 to 60 inches annually, and
year-round logging is normal practice.
Of the gross area of the Forest of
347,000 acres, 260,000 acres have
been planted, and the working circle
based on Murupara includes 200,000
acres of planted forest.
Rapid Rate of Growth.
Main species are insignis pine,
ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and Cor-
sican pine. On a sustained yield
basis, the forest is estimated to yield
30 million cubic feet annually, of
which two million is reserved for the
Government Forest Service Mill.
Products available for sale annually
from the processing plant should
reach 70 million board feet of sawn
timber, 50,000 long tons of news-
print, 10,000 long tons of printing
and wrtiing paper, and 25,000 long
tons of sulphate pulp.
The Government also expects to
spend about £l4 million providing
services, including a railway to Tau-
ranga and a harbour nearby at Mt.
Maunganui, on the Bay of Plenty, a
distance of 90 miles, and linking
with the main railway system of the
island, connecting with Auckland via
Hamilton. The distance to Sydney is

and to Melbourne 1,720 miles.
The Government will deliver, by
1954, sufficient electric power to
bring the complete plant into full
production, and, from the beginning
of 1956, to deliver whatever addi-
tional power is required for an en-
larged plant.
Housing for the employees in the
industry will be erected by the
Government.
Largest Single Plant.
The scheme will provide the
largest single industrial plant in the
Dominion, and is expected to take
about three years to construct. In-
vestigations have shown that the in-
tegrated industry should be able to
compete at world parity prices, not
only in New Zealand, but also in
Australia, and provide an attractive
profit on the investment. This would
be a great achievement, for Dominion
consumers would receive adequate
supplies of timber, paper and pulp
at satisfactory prices, and supplies
would be safeguarded in times of
emergency. Local production will also
relieve New Zealand and the Empire
of important dollar expenditure, and
earn substantial export income. Con-
siderable employment will be pro-
vided directly, while there will be
the additional benefits that unsettled
areas will be peopled and served with
essential public services and ancillary
industries.
The World of Science
By JAMES GREGORY.
U.S. Scientists Convert Wastes
Into Useful Products.
In producing vast quantities of
goods to strengthen itself and other
free nations against aggression, the
United States is finding many import-
ant uses for what once were consid-
ered waste materials. Engineers and
chemists are turning these materials
into valuable products.
Already, petroleum engineers are
obtaining more oil from wells once
believed “exhausted”. When wells
stop flowing of their own accord, 50
to 70 per cent, of the original supply
may remain in the ground. By flood-
ing wells with water, another 20 to 25
per cent, can be forced to the surface.
When synthetic soap is added to
water, still more oil can be recovered.
Another chemical compound helps
prevent corrosion of the water pipes
and pumping equipment, and destroys
bacteria that often block pores in the
sand.
In the early days of the oil indus-
try, natural gas was considered a nuis-
ance. Many gas wells were abandon-
ed because there was no way to get
this fuel to consumers. Today, this
gas is sent to consumers through pipe-
lines that cross the country in all di-
rections.
Chemists have found a treasury of
valuable substances in another com-
mon fuel —coal. Formerly, many

coal chemicals went up in smoke or
were discarded at the mine. Today,
coal dust, formerly a nuisance, is con-
verted into briquettes and used as
fuel.
With wood wastes chemists have
scored more triumphs. Wood shav-
ings and sawdust yield industrial al-
cohol. An American university, the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, has
made more than 150 varieties of wall
board from sawdust. In some Amer-
ican homes today the ceilings, walls,
and partitions are made of this kind
of wallboard.
Another home construction material
is made from bagasse, the fibrous sugar
cane waste. Bagasse has become a
valuable economic asset in regions
where sugar cane is grown, fin Aus-
tralia George A. Taylor, late editor
of this journal, invented and sold
“Bagasse” 50 years ago as fibrous
plaster ceilings and for wall boards.
They were as highly ornate as the
then architectural styles demanded
and they have stayed up unblemished
to this day.l
In the southern State of Florida,
orange and grapefruit peels are by-
products of the fruit industry. Form-
erly these peels were wasted. Today
they are converted into high-grade
animal feed, fertilizers, and natural
oils.
Other agricultural wastes have been
turned into valuable products. To-
bacco leaf fragments are manufacture
ed into insecticides. Rice hulls are
used to make wall-board and cement
blocks, and as a gentle grinding ma-
terial to clean carbon from the inside
of internal combustion engines.
At Oak Ridge, in the southern
State of Tennessee, scientists say that
discarded radioactive materials now
have a possible value. They report
that meat after exposure to such rad'
iation can remain fresh for several
weeks at room temperature.
The phosphate mining industry is
now sorting its piles of discarded ma-
terials for valuable uranium ore, im-
portant in the manufacture of atomic
energy.
U.S. chemists have found marble
dust—a waste product of quarrying—
valuable in the manufacture of roof
shingles, cosmetics, glue, linoleum,
and wall paper.
A cement company in Tennessee
each day collects about 75 tons of
dust, which formerly settled over the
surrounding countryside. This dust
contains large amounts of potash, and
is therefore valuable as a fertilizer.
An experimental plant set up by
the Southern Research Institute man-
ufactures paper from old railroad ties
and telegraph poles. It also extracts
oil from old pine trees and stumps.
This oil makes soap, disinfectants, and
deodorants.
The search for increasing uses of
waste products goes on in laboratories
and schools throughout the United
States. Scientists at the University of
Maryland believe they can find use
for lignin, which constitutes 10 to 20
per cent, of wood and is one of the
world’s major waste products. They
hope to convert lignin into simple
chemicals such as acetic acid, sugars,
and alcohols, and into food for ani-
mals.
In America’s war on waste much is
created; nothing is destroyed. Scient'
ists are converting something that
formerly was useless into something
that is useful.

A Civic Survey and Plan for the City
and Royal Burgh of Edinburgh
Prepared for the Town Council by
Patrick Abercrombie, LL.D., and
Derek Plumstead, A.R.1.8.A.
& Boyd, Edinburgh,
1949. Price, 255. stg.)
{Reviewed by Professor Denis
Winston, Professor of Town
and Country Planning at the
University of Sydney.}
A Planner might well think twice
before laying hands on Auld Reekie,
the ancient capital of Scotland, and
“mine old romantic town” of Scots-
men the world over: Edinburgh, the
city of dour Knox and ardent Mary,
of cold east winds and the warm
scent of wallflowers rising from the
gardens; of the Festival and of Scot-
tish licensing laws, of Old Town and
New Town and, not least, of a Patrick
Geddes, the father of modern plan-
ning and of that mysterious European
language which still from time to
time obscures the fertile writings of
his greatest disciple, Lewis Mum ford.
All this might well daunt a timid
spirit, but Sir Patrick won his spurs
on the planning fields of Dublin while
the gunboats in the Liffey were
arguing the English case in the Easter
Rebellion of 1916; and knocking
down a good deal of O’Connell Street
in the process. And it was, incidental-
ly, Patrick Geddes who, as adjudicator
with John Nolen, of Massachusetts,
awarded the Abercrombie and Kelly
scheme the First Premium in the in-
ternational competition for the new
Dublin plan; from Dublin it was a
logical step, via half the cities of the
British Commonwealth, to Edinburgh,
and we need have no fear that any
undue sense of nervousness in the
presence of the Royal Burgh has
prevented the submission of bold
proposals.
To those for whom Edinburgh still
means home, as well as for others all
over the world, not of the elect, but
for whom Edinburgh yet stands as a
unique inheritance—a town of North
Britain yet a continental town, the
town of the French alliance and the
Paris fashion tenements, one of those
world cities whose sum total adds up
to civilisation as we know it —to all
these the proposals in this Report will
be of vital concern. Most will turn
directly to the recommendations re-
garding the two features which make
Edinburgh really Edinburgh, t sat is to
say, the ancient developments along
the ridge which links the Castle with
Holyrood House —Lawnmarket, High
Street and Canongate—known the
world over as the Royal Mile, and
sunny Princes Street, with the gracious
terraces and squares of Craig’s New
Town behind it.
The problem of the Royal Mile is
a matter of the large-scale preserva-
tion of historic buildings which have
outworn their original use. Princes
Street is the problem of the shopping
street, which is also a major traffic
route, and the New Town generally
involves the problem of changing user,
from residence to commerce and from
houses to flats and hotels. The greater
question is: Will the existing elements
survive, still recognisably themselves,
in the Edinburgh of to-morrow, or
must the future obliterate the past?
The Royal Mile.
In the case of the Royal Mile,
alternative plans of action are clearly
outlined in Chapter 8 of the Report
and, broadly speaking, the recom-
mendation is to move industry out of
the area, remodel existing buildings
for office or residential purposes, and
build new offices, flats and two-storey
dwellings where remodelling is im-
practicable. This is, in fact, all that
could reasonably be expected, and one
only hopes that the City Fathers will
combine with St. Andrew’s House to
find the funds to rehabilitate as many
as possible of the old structures,
although this is likely to prove a more
expensive process than pulling them
down and starting again.
The Royal Mile is a treasure for
civilised mankind, and as we destroy
more and more of our inheritance, in
Lubeck and Dresden as well as in
Florence and London, what is left
becomes more precious, and in an age
when fibrous asbestos, plaster board,
and galvanised iron are our chief
building materials, the good hard
stone and tough craftsmanship of
these old houses provide much-needed
nourishment for the starved spirit.
But except for the occasional museum
or institution, they must be lived in
to be worth preserving. Surely the
test of all our planning will be
whether the great 20th Century flight
from the cities can be reversed. Can
we make our cities liveable once
again? If we can, who would not be
glad to pay a stiff rent for a
modernised apartment in the Canon'
gate?
Princes Street.
Princes Street, described as the
finest street in Europe by those who
stand with their backs to it looking
across the Gardens to the Castle, is a
different problem altogether. Here
we have a series of nondescript com'
mercial buildings, nearing the end of
their useful life, which are likely to
be re'built piecemeal under private
enterprise during the next few de-
cades. A few good or very solid
buildings will remain, and no uniform
overall effect is possible . How is the
planner to meet a situation of this
sort? Is he to leave things to chance
and to floor'space index, hope for the
best and very likely get the worst?
No! says the Edinburgh Report, and
produces an architectural “envelope”
for the new Princes Street —apologis'
ing for its packing'case effect and ex'
plaining that this arises from anxiety
not to dictate details to the architects
of individual buildings. Well, that’s
probably what most of us would have
done in practice, but with a guilty
conscience when we remembered that
plan and structure normally have
their part to play in governing ap-
pearance.
The mixed character of the new
Princes Street, with shops and stores,
offices, clubs and hotels, the latter
chiefly on the upper floors, is a wel-
come departure from the rigid dis-
cipline of the English Ministry’s con-
tinuous frontage shopping street. In
Princes Street, with its sunny aspect
and its famous view, it would be
absurd to limit the use to shops alone.
It appears that, by increasing the
average height of the buildings, it is
hoped to provide additional shopping
space on upper floors; yet, except for
the big stores, modern retailers dis-
like taking their customers up more
than one floor, and one would have
expected additional space to be pro-
vided, near to but outside Princes
Street, to meet the increased demand
fer central area shops which is ex-

peered to arise from developments in
the Edinburgh region.
Imaginative Planning.
If the new Princes Street develops
as proposed, it will mean a consider'
ably greater concentration of shopping
traffic along this street. All will then
depend upon the great project of the
three ' level highway with its two
thousand feet long parking promenade
being carried through. Here is an
imaginative and bold suggestion, the
sort of thing one comes across all too
seldom in planning reports: A piece
of positive improvement instead of a
restrictive device: and how grand it
could be! Let us hope that the
authorities have the courage and good
sense to carry it out. This would be
an easier matter if the additional .con'
nections from Waverley Bridge to
Picardy Place, and from the latter over
the new Gardens, under the High
Street, and along the Dalkeith Road,
were shorter and less elaboratebut
one must assume that all simpler alter'
natives have been tried and found
wanting.
It is interesting to compare the .115
pages. 25 maps, and 54 plates of the
Edinburgh Report with the 58 pages,
5 maps, and 37 plates of the Dublin
Report published in 1922, the latter
being smaller in dimensions, too, royal
quarto instead of folio. Yet the ad'
vantages are by no means entirely on
the side of the later and greater work.
Planning reports appear to have reach-
ed a crisis in their evolution: so much
admirable and necessary work is now
included in the preliminary survey, and
there are so many relevant facts to be
mentioned and illustrated by cunning
diagrams, that what used to be a fairly
straightforward description of sugges-
tions for civic improvements has now
become a massive and complicated
social document, in which the evidence
tends to overwhelm the proposals and
from which the ordinary citizen, as
well as the majority of his elected rep-
resentatives, may safely be expected to
shy away with the same vigour as they
would avoid going back to school and
doing their homework over again.
Town Planning Reports.
Yet there is little chance of planning
schemes being really carried out under
a democratic system of government
unless the public in general grasps the
essentials of what is proposed and gives
the proposals active support. Govern-
mental departments, on the other hand,
as well as implementing authorities and
other authorities affected by the pro-
posals, have to be persuaded by re-
ference to detailed and sometimes high-
ly technical surveys and arguments. It
appears, therefore, that two separate
documents are required: one contain-
ing the complete planning survey with
all relevant information tabulated in
the simplest possible way with no
thought of making the tables, maps
and documents anything but useful;
secondly, the planning scheme itself in
which the conclusions drawn from the
various surveys are briefly explained
and the proposals presented in a man'
ner readily understandable by the lay'
man. The invention of forms of
presentation suitable for reproduction
at a greatly reduced size is an impor'
tant and as yet insufficiently explored
aspect of the problem.
Soon, too, it may be possible to omit
from the reports the educational chap'
ters and special pleading designed 10
persuade people that such things as
road accidents and substandard living
conditions are really bad things. When
the time comes that the latter can be
taken for granted, the planner will be
able to give more of his time and
energy to his real job of solving the
many practical problems connected
with urban development, including the
neglected problem of the time schedule
for the various works and the exact
ways and means, administrative, finam
dal and technical, by which they may
be carried out. In the meantime, “A
Civic Survey and Plan for the City and
Royal Burgh of Edinburgh,” priced at
25/' sterling, is probably the best value
among new planning books now avail'
able, and every student which in'
eludes all serious planners will wish
to add it to his collection.
WORLD-WIDE CONSTRUCTION
THE ST. LOUIS FREIGHT TERMINAL.
In these days of moans and groans
because the N.S.W. Railways are
losing millions, it is interesting to read
how other railways face the same
problems—and surmount them.
It is a far cry from our antiquated
way of handling freight to me hods
used overseas, where speedy receipt
and despatch of all types of goods is
the first consideration.
On January 2 last, the Missouri
Pacific opened its new freight station
(see photo), occupying a five'acre site
near St. Louis.
This station is served by four
through tracks and by eight stub
tracks entering at the south end.
Along the east and west sides are
paved roadways for truck delivery of
freight.
Within the station, the side plat'
forms, having both truck and track
frontages at car'floor level, are 51ft.
wide. The two interior island plat'
forms, served by tracks only, are 30ft.
wide. All platforms are 750 ft. long.
An unusual feature of this station is
the placing of the columns of the
rigid frames supporting the roof at
one edge of each platform instead of
at the centre.
Airplane'hangar type doors across
the track openings and doors at each
of the 131 side delivery doors make
it possible to close and heat the build'
ing in winter.
Siding and roofing are of corrugated
asbestos. Skylights running the full
length of the building above the plat'
forms provide most of the light need'
ed for daytime work.

AMERICAN ILLUMINATING
ENGINEERING SOCIETY
Reports Remarkable Lighting
Progress.
Mr. Samuel A. Hibben, President
of The Illumina ing Engineering
Society in America, in his report on
the state of the Nation’s Lighting says
that Good Lighting in America is not
just a coincidence. He said:
“The graphic chart of the growth
of sales of kilowatt hours for lighting
quite closely duplicates the curve of
the growth of the I.E.S. membership.
In the last decade this membership has
approximately doubled; so has the
usage of electric power for lighting—
the growth in the lighting fixture and
lamp business has been even greater.
Last year we used about 25% more
lamps, representing 50% more dollars,
than in 1945! And those bulbs had
longer lives and higher light outputs
than ever before. The business volume
of all lighting equipment (excepting
residential) last year was up 40% over
1950. Surely, 7000 I.E.S. members,
advancing the ’gospel’, have had some'
thing to do with this growth!”
PROTECT YOUR HOME
AGAINST BUSH-FIRES.
Precautions To Be Taken.
A study by the Division of Forest
Products, C.5.1.R.0., of the houses
deslroyed in the disastrous Beaumaris
fire in January, 1944, revealed that the
greatest hazard to guard against is the
entrance of sparks and flying embers
through openings such as eaves, vem
tilators, open windows, and the space
under the house. Brick and stone
houses fared no better than timber
houses.
The following represent the modifi'
cations to normal building practice
which are recommended.
Timber houses—in fact, all houses
supported on stumps —should be close'
boarded below floor level, under-floor
ventilation being provided by woven
wire vents.
All wall ventilators should be of the
woven wire type or else they should
be covered by a fine wire mesh; large
ventilators in gable ends should be
eliminated and replaced by a number
of small vents.
Eaves may be open for maximum
ventilation, but the openings should
be covered with %in. mesh wire net'
ting. Badly'fltting Marseilles pattern
tiles should be avoided. Close'fitting
sheet roofing is preferable, and the
joints should be sealed. The spaces
under corrugations of sheet roofing at
eaves, ridges, hips, and valleys should
be covered with fine mesh wire net'
ting.
Fly'wire protection should be given
to all door and window openings.

Dramatic Emphasis in Lighting
REMARKABLE AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT.
“A good many things go around in
the dark besides Santa Claus," Herbert
Hoover once said, and that is indeed
true in Sydney, where most of the
population stumble through blackouts
seven days a week.
Because of this, it is refreshing to
study the constant progress being
made by U.S. lighting experts, who
know how to dispel gloom with the
click of a switch.
They know full well, too, that less
exacting pursuits call for more atmos-
phere than light, and thus the designer
can underline special effects or subdue
unattractive details.
Many misuses of light hitherto exist-
ing are a result of the confusion stem-
ming from the tremendously accele-
rated development of new lighting
equipment during the last two decades.
Fluorescent lighting, being dramati-
cally “advanced" and economical, has
been seized upon because of these
characteristics.
The aesthetics of lighting, such as
they are, derive from photography,
the requirements and lessons of stage
production, and landscape painting.
Our three illustrations below show
(left) a passerby’s impression of the
reconstructed street floor of Lightolier
Incorporate’s New York showroom.
A curtain of brass ball-chain divides
the show window from the reception
area, and further in a partition of
wooden poles binds off the showroom.
In this deep and shimmering vista
lamps are suspended for inspection.
The tricks played with perspective
make the area appear larger; spaces
between the wooden poles become pro-
gressively smaller, and the boarding on
the left wall is cut narrower towards
the ceiling.
The centre photo is the interior of
a men’s wear shop in Los Angeles.
Although the area was diagonal to the
street frontage, the designer has wrung
the last possible bit of drama from an
irregular plan, with entrance and two
additional show windows cut into the
front like Vs.
Circular fluorescent lighting behind
luminous glass is suspended from a
low-cost fir plank ceiling; fixtures are
Painted grey, and counter tops are of
white linoleum.
The illustration on the right shows
a modern light source visible and
cheap the incandescent lamps are
used for dramatic effect. Arranged en
masse in the marquee of an American
theatre, this lighting (which has gone
the ‘“whole hog" by our standards)
gives us an example of lighting ’used
as an integral part of architecture, de-
signed simultaneously.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BETTER
LIGHTING.
The Task of the Lighting Industry.
Mr. J. Schuchert, Managar, Com-
mercial Sales, Duquesne Light Co., in
a speech to the Pittsburgh Section of
the American Illuminating Engineer-
ing Society said:
“Every organised group, every com-
pany, every individual who may be
considered a part of the lighting in-
dustry is in a broad sense attempting
to perform the same essential service.
What is this service? Telling the
people who use light, your customer
and mine, the quantity and quality of
light they should have, making re-
commendations based on facts gained
from researches and experience, de-
signing lighting so as to make bright-
ness of tasks, objects and surroundings
suitable for providing the greatest
benefits to our people of all ages
whether in the home, school, office,
store or factory.
“That’s our objective, and as soon
as we attempt to realise it we find that
we are working with something that
is different from almost every other
type of service rendered to mankind.
Man does not consciously crave for
more light in the same way he demands
food and sustenance of life. He has
and in most places still is forcing his
eyes, his nerves, his entire physical
system to fight in order to see, in
order to perform his daily tasks. It
never automatically dawned on him
that Better Light and Better Sight go
hand in hand. Only after he ex-
perienced Better Lighting did he ap-
preciate it. Someone (someone mean'
ing thousands of people concerned in
a scientific or material way) provided
the brains, the time, the effort, the
money to make the refreshing ex-
perience possible for the user.”

BRITISH PLANNING IDEAS FOR AUSTRALIA?
By S. L. LUKER, M.I.E. (Aust.), B.Sc. (Civ. Eng.), A.M.I.C.E., M.T.P.I,,
Chief County Planner of the Cumberland County Council.
[Extracts from an Address to the Town and County Planning Institute of Australia.}
My main impression was, as I
naturally expected, that whilst the
British planning machine is still in the
“running-in” stage there had been a
definite advance in the whole concept
of planning, an adoption of a planning
machine essentially logical in its struc-
ture and method of operation (even
though showing some slight “tilt” to-
wards socialist ideals) and a definite
acceptance of planning as an essential
considera ion in both State and Local
Government. As the corollary of this,
I obtained confirmation of mv belief
that planning in Australia calls for
some deep thought and an early and
courageous review if it is to succeed.
We are most certainly in the formative
stage.
Historically, modern planning in
Britain has its roots in the great trans-
formation of the country during the
Industrial Revolution from an essen-
tially rural economy to an industrial
one, a change accompanied by indis-
criminate spread of urban development
at the expense of rural areas, disturb-
ance in the balance of distribution of
employment, a grow h of congested,
unhealthy and soul-destroying towns —
in short, the price that Britain paid
for “prosperity” by get - rich - quick
methods.
From our particular standpoint as
planners, the significant event was a
recognition expressed in the first plan-
ning Act of 1909, that a land-owner
developing his land has responsibilities
beyond those of merely complying
with the requirements of public health
and the building by-laws. The
sequence of legislation culminating in
the 1932 Act fashioned a machine
which extended the planner’s field of
responsibility and powers of control.
But throughout th ; s period of increas-
ing scope, British planning was (to
quote a recent Ministerial phrase),
“bedevilled by the bogey of compen-
sation” a situation which virtually
wrecked the planning machinery which
was then in use.
The growing intensity of the prob-
lem of the distribution of population
and indusry and the difficulties of
controlling land-use and development,
led the Government of the day in
1937 to appoint the Barlow Royal
Commission to study the problems.
That Commission, by its report, fol-
lowed as it was by the reports of the
Uthwatt and Scott Committees, made
an advance towards planning under
positive direction which marked a turn-
ing point in the evolution of planning
in Britain.
Those reports are part of the histori-
cal background of British planning,
but by virtue of their ideas and in-
fluences they are British planning of
to-day—its logical foundation and its
inspiration. If we need anything to
make planning a reality in Australia it
is the counterpart of those reports.
Apart from its historical features,
British planning must be viewed
against the geographical, social, ad-
ministrative and economic conditions
of the country, its national charac-
teristics and its political tendencies, so
that we may note on the one hand
the similarities and, on the other, the
contras s with our Australian condi-
tions, and may judge whether, or to
what exent, British planning ideas and
methods can be applied to our work
here.
A feature one can only sense rather
than measure is the national mental
characteristics of the British some-
thing that determines their general
outlook on life and their capacity to
deal with, or put up with, every-day
problems. This is closely bound up
with a general willingness to accept
the disciplines of authority—not neces-
sarily without grumbling or trying to
change the law or the government re-
sponsible for it but still an acceptance
of the Rule. This I am sure helps to
make planning easier of achievement
because we cannot have planning with-
out someone being willing to be plan-
ned. My impression was that Britishers
are more willing to be planned than
Australians are.
I want to break down the rather
prevalent idea that planning in Britain
is in any basic respect political or a
party matter. One hears it said that
planning, particularly under the 1947
Act., etc., is the result of Socialist
policy. I will admit that National
Planning and the Welfare State are to
some extent expressions of Socialism,
or at least were more important among
the objeefives of the Attlee Govern-
ment than of previous or present Con-
servative Governmen's. But town and
country planning is not synonymous
with National Planning in the econo-
mic sense, or with the Welfare State.
In this regard it was a Liberal
Government that passed the first plan-
ning Act in 1909, a Conservative
Government the next comprehensive
Act in 1925, and a Coalition Govern-
ment the 1932 Act —all being treated
as non-party measures.
The present (1947) planning Act
was based on the Barlow, Scott and
Uthwatt Reports, and the committees
responsible for all of these were ap-
pointed by a Coalition Government —
which also appointed the first Minister
for Planning and introduced the 1944
Act to give effect to part at least of
the recommendations of those com-
mittees.
The 1947 Act was passed by the
Attlee Socialist Government as a
non-party measure - in order to give
complete effect to those recommenda-
tions. It does reflect a certain socialist
outlook in some of its provisions, but
that does not affect its principles.
Moreover, from what I could gather
from pre-election inqui r ie s, the
Churchill Government is not going to
change that Act very much.
One of my strong impressions was
that planning has been recognised by
the British public, particularly by local
authorities, as an integral part of
government and not, as is much the
case in Australia, a side-line or a
luxury which local councils feel they
cannot afford. Planning indeed is a
primary consideration of local govern-
ment aclivity and their proposals for
housing, roads, parks, and even gar-
bage disposal, relate closely to the plan
of the area.
The present planning Act is tending
to weaken local government because
it ties it so closely to Central Govern-
ment. If a local authority, for instance,
desires to preserve a tree, it can issue
an order but must obtain a ministerial
confirmation from Whitehall. This is
in line with the general closeness of
control generally and it has been said
that in Britain to-day there is “too
much harness and too little horse.”
But the public seems to have become
apathetic to controls —it has had them
for twelve years.
The 1947 Act and the 1946 New
Towns Act have led to great activity
in planning. So far mainly in the
phase of control, which is very com-
prehensive. and the preparation of
Development Plans. The whole posi-
tion, and the prospect ahead is, how-
ever, very vitally affected by the
economic restrictions under which the
countrv is suffering. This has very
seriously retarded the irapiemen ation
of plans, and even the restoration of
blitz damage. It has also given rise

I
to a feeling of frustration by planners
and by planning authorities.
• In the minds of the general public
there is some confusion between plan-
ning control and the inescapable finaiv
cial and manpower controls imposed
for national economic reasons.
National planning is largely done
without any specific powers or special
machinery. For instance, there is no
specific power to deal with the qucs'
tion of over'all future water supply
resources which, in the south-east of
England, around the London area, is
a matter of concern because of the
huge increase of population and em-
ployment there. But when the De-
velopment Plans under the 1947 Act
come in from each planning authority
—the Ministry will check this aspect
when examining them. One could
almost say that National planning is
being done by stealth.
However, there is legislative pro-
vision for some forms of National plan-
ning as for controlling the distribution
of industry in correlation with that of
population. The Board of Trade is
doing this very effectively, even
though I came across instances where
its policy did not quite mesh in with
the policy of the Minister of Planning.
This was largely because the Board of
Trade cannot quite forget that its pur-
pose prior to 1947 was to distribute
industry solely to relieve unemploy-
ment and not for planning purposes.
the most noticeable construction
work being done in connection with
planning is housing, and that is seen
everywhere but, of course, progress
lags behind the programme.
Planning, in spite of all its difficul'
ties and frustrations of the moment, is
really proceeding along a rational and
promising path. It is actually bring'
ing about a Second Industrial Revolu'
tion. not one of violent change but a
new conception of the relation of
town and countryside and of man and
bis work—a conception full of promise
and inspiration.
PART 11.
Turning to specific phases of plan-
ning which I observed in Britain I
want to deal with four matters which
I feel are worth study with a view to
possible application to our work in
Australia.
Land Values, Compensation
and Betterment.
The first of these is that thorny
problem of Land Values, Compensa'
tion and Betterment. This is easily
the most important feature of the
1947 Act and is a most controversial
issue.
The evidence obtained by the Bar-
low Commission revealed that “the
difficulties that are encountered by
planning authorities under the existing
(1932) system of compensation and
betterment are so great as seriously to
hamper the progress of planning
throughout the Country.” The Com-
mission stated that its recommendations
in respect of industrial distribution
would be of little effective value if
these difficulties were not removed,
and it recommended the appointment
of an expert committee to analyse the
question.
Such a committee was appointed in
1941 under the Chairmanship of Lord
Justice Uthwatt and its terms of re'
ference were primarily to “analyse the
subject of payment of compensation
and recovery of betterment and advise
possible means of stabilising the value
of land required for development or
re-development.”
The Committee’s basic findings and
recommendations were that ownership
of land does not carry an unqualified
right of user and, for this reason, re'
strictions based upon what is termed
“the duties of neighbourliness” may
be imposed without liability to pay
compensation. But the point may be
reached where such restrictions extend
beyond the obligation of neighbourli'
ness and, at that stage, the restrictions
become equivalent to an expropriation
of a proprietary right and ought there'
fore to carry the right to compensa'
tion.
The Committee went on to reconi'
mend that the existing use value of
land should be the basis of payment
for acquiring land for planning and < f
paying compensation. The whole
liability to pay compensation should
be taken over by the State and the
whole of the “development rights” of
undeveloped land outside towns should
be regarded as vested in the State,
thus enabling an over'all Balance be'
tween compensation and betterment to
be achieved on a national scale. The
development rights or Development
Value as it is now termed amounted
to the difference between the value of
the land assuming there was no bar
to its development in the manner pro'
posed and the value assuming develop'
ment was restricted to its existing use.
The procedure virtually amounted to
an immediate collection of betterment
on an assumed basis related to the
benefit which will accrue to the owner
from the privilege of developing his
land.
The 1947 Act set out to provide the
means for dealing completely with the
question of betterment. It went be'
yond the recommendation of the
Uthwatt Committee and it is mainly
in this respect that the 1947 Act has
raised such widespread controversy and
objection. The major departure was
that the owner of a block of land
wishing to develop had to pay a Dc'
velopment Charge of the full
of the assessed Development Value of
the land and not T)% as recommend'
ed by the Uthwatt Committee.
This is said by the many critics of
the 1947 Act to be inequitable and to
be stifling development and deterring
owners from selling their land, as they
virtually only receive its existing use
value, making no profit from the sale.
The same factor, it is said, discourages
development.
There is definite evidence that this
result is occurring though the Attlee
Government contended with some jus'

tification that it is economic strin'
gency that was mainly responsible for
the slowness of development and the
reluctance to sell.
In Britain the central government
handle? the whole matter of assessing
Development Values and fixing De'
velopment Charges, this transaction
being bound up with the principle
that compensation and betterment
should be treated on a national level.
My conclusion is that the me hod is
worthy of consideration by the N.S.W.
Government.
The N.S.W. Act of 1945, though
passed after the publication of the
Barlow and Uthwatt reports and sub'
sequent also to embodiment of some
of their recommendations in the 1944
British Act, was not materially in'
fluenced by these new ideas. That is
no reflection on those responsible for
drafting that Act, but the fact is that
as regards the question of compen'
sation and betterment New South
Wales legislation is based on the vir'
tually superseded British 1932 Act.
This suggests the need to consider
whether planning under the New
South Wales legislation is not liable
to suffer the same disabilities as were
experienced in Britain under the 1932
Act and whether such disabilities could
be avoided by adopting the new logical
ideas embodied in subsequent British
Legislation.
In coming to this conclusion, I have
in mind that provision for collection
of betterment was omitted from the
Cumberland County Scheme mainly
because it had proved impracticable
in Britain under the procedure of the
1932 Act and was objected to by local
councils. It will most probably be
omitted from other schemes. The in'
escapable fact will then be that such
schemes will lack a very important
means of balancing their expenditure
on compensation —which is the very
condition which wrecked British plan-
ning under the 1932 Act. It is hard'
ly possible to dismiss the fear of a
similar result occurring in New South
Wales.
Distribution of Industry.
Britain’s development as an indus'
trial nation involved the establishment
of industry over wide areas of the
country, with a corresponding increase
of population in the areas concerned,
and these ultimately became large
conurbations.
In the lack of proper provisions to
safeguard health and amenity and to
provide the necessary social services,
the result of this trend was such as to
lead the Barlow Commission to state
that '“the disadvantages in many, if
not in most, of the great industrial
concentrations, alike on the strategical.

stitute serious handicaps and even, in
some respects, dangers to the Nation’s
life and development.”
Coupled with such establ shment of
industry was a large degree of indus'
trial specialisation in particular areas,
resulting in a serious lack of balance
between male and female employment
opportunities as well as in the range
of trades and skills.
During the depression of 1930'
193 3, and with little abatement over
the years prior to the war, unemploy'
ment in certain areas was an acute
problem. The Government declared
such areas “Special Areas” and,
through the agency of the Board of
Trade, set out to encourage the estab'
lishment of new industries therein.
Such areas were chosen as far as pos'
sible for the establishment of muni'
tion factories during the Second World
War, and as they were closed down
after the war, the machinery set up
for dealing with the Special Areas
continued to operate under the Dis'
tribution of Industry Act of 1945,
with a view to continuing to improve
the balance of population and indus-
try.
The areas in question were renamed
“Development Areas” and in 1947
the efforts of the Board of Trade were
linked with those of the Ministry of
Planning under the Town and Coun'
try Planning Act. Many of the muni'
tion factory areas were made Develop-
ment Areas for civil industry as at St.
Marys here.
The policy being implemented at
present is broadly that an industrialist
desiring to build a new factory of over
5,000 square feet in floor area has to
obtain a licence from the Board of
Trade before he can obtain a plan'
ning permit from the local planning
authority. Such licence is granted for
other than a Development Area only
where the applicant can convince the
Board of Trade that there are sound
reasons for the location of his factory
therein. Otherwise the industrialist is
induced to establish his factory in a
Development Area.
The industrialist has little choice
but to enter a Development Area, but
the Board’s actions are not merely
negative. It sets out to give very
material assistance. For instance, it
helps him to find the best location for
his factory—often far more effectively
than he is able to do on his own
resources, as the Board has over'all
knowledge of the industrial situation.
The point of special interest is that
this inducement and assistance largely
takes the form of providing factory
accommodation in an industrial estate.
These estates amount to a major
feature of British industrial develop'
ment. They are managed by govern'
ment' financed non'profit'making or'
panisations run on commercial lines.
I> such estates factories of various
t) pes and sizes are made available on
a leasehold tenure, and facilities such
?s a cafeteria service are provided.
Furthermore, financial assistance is
given for the establishment of the in'
dustry.
In the present condition of economic
stringency, manpower and material
shortage and capital expenditure con'
trol, these provisions are very gene'
rally welcomed by industrialists. The
whole scheme appears to be very sue'
cessful and it has largely contributed
to the rapid increase in production in
the interests of the Export Drive and,
latterly, the Rearmament Programme.
The industrial estates I was able to in'
spect and discuss with the authorities
concerned give evidence of acceptance
by industrialists, and I was most im'
pressed by the organ sation responsible.
Now the pa tern of industrial dis'
tribution in Australia may have no
close resemblance with that in Britain,
but the nroblems that have arisen have
many similarities. The need for sound

this may be due to the fact that the photo

policy in handling these problems is
potentially just as urgent.
For instance, a policy of State and
Commonwealth guidance and assist'
ance in the establishment of industry
has been adopted in Australia, but
there is no complete systematic liaison
with planning on either regional or
town levels. Success in its achieve'
ment is too often dependent on chance,
whilst, on the other hand, it frequent'
ly conflicts with accepted principles in
respect of particular areas.
The principle of State decentralisa-
tion calls for encouragement in the
location of new major industries away
from Sydney, and the provision of
factories would be of material aid to'
wards this end.
Experience by the Cumberland
County Council has revealed the diffi'
culties experienced by industrialists in
obtaining the land they require for
factories, and there is clear evidence
that the industrial estate idea would
provide the means for giving much'
needed assistance in this regard.
There is another aspect in this prob'
lem: even under a planning scheme
such as we have in the County of
Cumberland, difficulty can be expected
in securing the location of industry
on systematic lines according to its
type, having regard to strategic, econo'
mic and other considerations. The
zoning of industrial areas of special
classes in the County Scheme will pro-
vide a measure of control in a broad
way, but this does not apply complete'
ly to “General Industry,” which makes
up the greatest part of the whole. It
is, in fact, difficult to see how the
County Scheme proposals for decern
tralisation of industry can be com'
pletely achieved by the mere zoning of
areas for “Light Industry” or “Heavy
Industry,” as these zonings will be
abortive unless industrialists can ob'
ta.n the land they require therein.
Under present economic conditions in'
deed, occupation of these areas may
lag as industrialists cannot always
secure actual factory accommodation
there. Again, the Scheme will not
achieve its full purpose in respect of
an industrialist who has an old factory
in an inner industrial area, such as
Alexandria, from which it is desired
to disperse industry, if there is nothing
to prevent him rebuilding on the same
land and no means of offering him
any material inducement to go into a
more desirably located zone.
My observations of industrial dis-
tribution in Britain confirm my pre'
vious conclusion that the whole ques'
tion of systematic industrial distribu'
tion on a national plane, coupled with
assistance in the form of Industrial
Estates, etc., warrants consideration as
regards its application to Australia.

be seen that except for the minimum

and £lOO for minimum cost for altera-

would be virtually no houses of that
small area it means that home-builders

Danger of Buildings
Without Windows
A warning against the use of win-
dowless buildings in the atomic age
is given in a report issued by the In-
ternational Labour Office.
The report, entitled “Hygiene in
Shops and Offices,’’ was prepared by
ILO experts for the second session of
the 13-nation Advisory Committee on
Salaried Employees and professional
Workers which met in Geneva, Feb-
ruary 18.
“A serious outbreak of fire would
rapidly fill the building with smoke
and convert the entire structure into
a furnace against which external hos-
ing would be useless,” the report says.
Furthermore, a windowless building
is apt to be completely demolished by
an explosion since there are no win-
dows to act as “safety valves” and
to provide an outlet for explosive
forces.
The report suggests that where it
is essential to construct buildings un-
derground, at least one “external”
wall should be exposed to outside air
and should be of relatively light con-
struction so that there is at least one
element which will “give in” and act
as a safety valve in the event of an
explosion.
“The artificial and total exclusion
of all outside view and of daylight,”
it says, “is against man’s natural in-
clinations, and is liable to induce a
feeling of depression and confinement
which can seriously affect the mental
and physical health of the worker and
lead to a corresponding reduction in
his efficiency and output.”
This. cqnsideration outweighs the
advantages that windowless buildings
might otherwise have, the study de-
clares. —Accident Prevention Bulletin,
N.S.W.
HUGE HOSPITAL DEFICIT.
N.S.W. hospitals will end the finan-
cial year on Tune 30 with the largest
deficit on record. Dr. H. "H. Schlink
reported last week.
He said that hospitals throughout
the State would be about £1,500,000
in debt by the end of the month.
The debt would have to be liqui-
dated by a Government subsidy.
The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,
of which Dr. Schlink is chairman of
directors, will show a deficit of £200,-
000 on the year’s work, the report
added.
Olympic Stadium
Helsinki
While Australia rowed about the
final location of the 1956 Olympic
Games in Melbourne, Finland has
energetically pushed ahead with its
plans for the forthcoming Olympic
Games in Helsinki (400,000 popular
tion).
Helsinki is the smallest city that has
even been host for the Games. It is
a mighty job for a small country, but
since the war the stouthearted Finns
have accomplished three tasks far more
formidable.
The Finns, totalling 4 million, have
rebuilt a land devastated by war; re-
housed and resettled 477,000 refugees
from the areas ceded to Russia at the
Armistice in 1944, and paid off their
war reparations to the U.S.S.R. —in
the form of goods equal in value to
two and a half times the annual har-
vest.
Since this small but virile nation has
done all these things, it safely follows
that they will make a success of the
Olympic Gaihes-.,
The Stadium.
The Olympic Stadium stands on
rising ground in the wooded centre of
Helsinki. In the neighbourhood there
are football grounds, the swimming
stadium, the sports ground of Elain-
tarha and the Municipal Gardens.
The 1940 Olympic Games were to
have been held on the Stadium, but
due to the war this plan was aban-
doned. Originally, the stadium v/as
built for 25,000 specta'.ors, but by
means of temporary stands it was en-
larged to accommodate 62,000 spec'
tators. These stands have now been
replaced with stands constructed of
ferro-concrete; there is now accommo-
dation for 50,000 spectators, and for
the year’s Games addi.ional stands for
about 20,000 people are nearing com'
pletion.
The necessary indoor space is be'
low the covered grandstand. On the
first floor are the dressing-rooms,
rooms for physical research a cinema
and lecture room, a training hall with
earth track for use in winter and a
small cafe. The large dressing-rooms
are used in winter for training in
gymnastics, or wrestling and boxing,
fencing and basket ball.
The second floor of the grandstand
serves as the entrance hall for spec-
tators and refreshment area. On the
third floor are the stadium offices,
Press rooms and post office facilities.
These rooms and offices have a sepa-
rate entrance from the western side.
The tower at the southern side con'
tains an elevator, a central ventilating
duct, radio aerials, broadcasting studios
and lighting controls. A television
station will be operated on the top
of the tower. The architects were
Messrs. Yrjo Lindergren and Toivo
Jantti.

FACTS AND FIGURES.
Over 100 major developmental pro'
jects are awaiting for the word “go”
as soon as financial restrictions are
“ironed out”. £350,000,000 will be
spent on governmental works and ex-
tra to that, possibly twice that much
by private enterprise. There is a
boom time ahead and it should not
be far away.

Siemens
THE TANTALUM FILAMENT LAMP
The Drawn Wire Filament Lamp (having a filament of
Tantalum metal) was invented by Dr. Bolton in 1903 and
the first TANTALUM lamps were marketed by the British
SIEMENS Company in 1904/5.
From then onwards thousands of TANTALUM Lamps were
used for the lighting of Streets, Municipal Buildings, etc.,
etc. In 1908 SIEMENS TANTALUM Lamps were installed
on the Great Northern and City Railway, this being the
first installation of metal filament lamps on electrical
rolling stock In this country. Shortly afterwards all London
Electric trams were similarly equipped.

Real Estate Institute
New Secretary Appointed.
Mr. Victor Collins. F.R.E.1., J.P V
has been appointed Secretary of the
Real Estate Institute of New South
Wales in succession to the late Mi
Walter Greenwood. Mr. Collins join-
ed the Institute in 1946 and served a
probationary period as Acting Secre-
tary for a few months after Mr.
Greenwood’s death.
Mr. Collins came to Australia from
Great Britain in 1929 under the aus-
pices of The Big Brother Movement,
his sponsor being the late Reg Bristol,
a welMoved identity of Melbourne’s
motor trade. Mr. Collins is now a
“Big Brother’’ himself and his pro-
tege, lan Bond, is outback on a sheep
station getting ready to cope with the
floods at Darlington Point.
Coming to Australia with the idea
of settling on the land, Mr. Collins
engaged in all kinds of rural activity
in many parts of the Commonwealth
for a number of years. Speaking of
his years in the bush, he said “they
were happy days, and I learned manv
things besides farming.”
At the outbreak of World War 11..
Victor Collins joined the 2nd A.I.F
and was posted to the Australian
Army Service Corps, and was later
transferred to the Military History
Section and saw active service in New
Guinea. The fact that the Army was
able to use his journalistic talents,
gave Mr. Collins confidence to pursue
the art of letters and he has been con'
sistently active ever since.
Mr. Collins is deservedly popular
with Institute Members and the Board
of Management is confident that his
energy and youthful enthusiasm will
enable him to carry on in the high
tradition of service established by his
predecessor. The new R.E.I. Secre'
tary certainly starts off with a wealth
of good wishes and an assurance of
co-operation from all sections of the
Building industry.
SYDNEY STUDENT WINS

Building Controls
Eased
CABINET LIFTS RESTRICTIONS.
Views of Industry Leaders.
The N.S.W. State Cabinet recently
decided to exempt all building opera-
tions except demolitions from existing
restrictions.
Controls were also lifted on some
building materials.
Cabinet also decided to free bricks
from control but to retain control over
the use of galvanised iron, water and
gas pipes, tiles, and steel for fencing
posts.
Controls over demolitions will also
be continued.
The Premier, Mr. Cahill, announced
that the section of the Building Opera-
tions and Building Materials Act
(1945) prohibiting the use of bricks
for building other than homes would
not be enforced.
This section will not be repealed, he
added.
The Act under which the Govern-
ment exercises the remaining controls
has already been extended by procla-
mation until September.
The Premier said that the Gov-
ernment could not repeal the Act
because it is still needed to exercise
controls over demolitions and the use
of some materials.
Cabinet’s information was that iron,
steel, terracotta tiles and piping were
still in scarce supply, Mr. Cahill said.
Bricks Freed.
Tne Government would not enforce
the provisions of the Act relating to
use of bricks, and in future bricks
could be used for any purpose without
having to get a permit from the De-
partment of Building Materials.
Cabinet has authorised the Minister
for Building Materials, Mr. Dickson,
to declare all building operations, ex-
cept demolitions, exempt from existing
regulations.
No Repeal.
The Premier said the Government
would not repeal the Building Industry
Act because the Act controls demoli-
tions “and we cannot allow demolitions
while the present position continues.
“We decided to maintain control on
those building materials which are
short.
“We will keep the position under
review. If money is made available
for housing and bricks become short
again we will not hesitate to reimpose
control.
“On the other hand, we may de-
cide later on to lift all controls,” the
Premier added.
Industry Leaders’ Views.
Leaders of the building industry
agreed that the Building Industry
Act should be abolished to allow
private enterprise to get on with the
job of building.
“The announcement by the Premier,
Mr. Cahill, that the Building Act will
no longer be enforced is a step in the
right direction,” said the President
of the Master Builders’ Association of
N.S.W., Mr. C. E. Thompson.
“The removal of all fetters is neces-
sary to allow private enterprise to
function effectively, and proceed with
its main job of building.
It should allow the proper types
of structure to be erected,” Mr.
Thompson added.
“Retention of restrictions on demo-
lition is right. In this regard it is a
pity that the acres of houses which
were demolished some years ago in
Surry Hills and Redfern [Demolitions
were by the Housing Commission—a
Government concern—in co-operation
with the City Council in 1948.—Ed.]
have not yet been replaced by modern
homes and blocks of flats.”
Mr. Thompson said the Premier’s
statement that controls may be reim-
posed if necessary “is, to say the least,
unsettling.”
“Mr. Cahill should know that pri-
vate enterprise, if given the right in-
centive, can well cope with the situa-
tion.”
The President of the Council of
Suburban Master Builders’ Associa-
tions, Mr. W. A. Miles, said that the
removal of building controls “is a step
in the right direction.”
“But the Government has not gone
far enough. They should have lifted
everything, as supply will control it'
self,” Mr. Miles declared.
“In the past there have been too
many jobs started without enough
materials available to finish them.
“Materials should have been
trolled at their source, otherwise op'
portunities are created to start black-
markets.

“We know galvanised iron, piping,
and tiles are short, but the supply will
catch up to the demand.
“Tile production is lagging, and
can’t catch up like bricks in the mean'
time, but will eventually,” Mr. Miles
said.
“The t : me is not far distant when
all controls must be lifted,” he added.
Mr. Miles said: “Controls over a
few minor Lems which anyway con-
trol themselves is absurd, and it is only
making a job for a Minister and a
large staff in his department,” he con'
eluded.
The executive director of the 8.1. C.,
Mr. D. Stewart Fraser, expressed the
opinion that it was a great pity that
the Government had not scrapped the
Act.
He said there was no possible ex'
cuse fpr retaining the Act, except to
keep the Department of Building
Materials alive.
“The staff could be better employed
in constructive, instead of restrictive,
activities at a time when Australia’s
economic recovery depends upon maxi'
mum effort,” Mr. Fraser added.

Randwick Council
Community Hotel
Extension of Time Granted.
Recently, the Minister for Build'
ing Materials, Mr. W. E. Dickson,
granted the Randwick Municipal
Council a permit to build a commun-
ity centre and hotel.
Mr. Dickson stated at the time that
there was “now a surplus of bricks
and many brickworks could give iim
mediate delivery.”
(Preliminary plans are for a hotel
and centre at Maroubra Junction to
cost £250,000. It will be the first
hotel in Australia controlled by Local
Government authorities.)
In the Licensing Court the other
day the Randwick Council was grant'
ed an extension of six months in
which to commence building, and the
council expects to be able to lay the
foundations in a few weeks’ time.
The conditional license was granted
in June, 1950, and expires on De
cember 16, 1952.
Grounds upon which the further ap'
plication for an extension of time was
made, were:
(a) That approval has only recent'
ly been granted by the Department
of Building Materials to proceed with
the erection of the building and use of
building materials.
(b) That finance must be arrang'
ed, and it is not expected that any
decision can be given in this respect
until after an allocation has been ap'
proved by the Loan Council.
(c) Working drawings and sped'
fications approved by Council are in
the course of preparation and are not
yet complete.
CONCRETE SHELL ROOF

STEEL FRAMEWORK
Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modern school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and Hilcon lightweight precast reinforced
concrete Roof, Floor and Wall units.
All Presweld Components are permanently rust-

Northumberland
County Council
Adopts Full Scheme
Will Cost £1 Million to Implement.
Northumberland County Council
last week unanimously adopted the full
county scheme, including maps, im-
plementation costs, and a draft ord'
inance naming the Council as the
Authority responsible for administer'
ing the scheme.
It is estimated that the scheme will
cost £1 million to put into effect
The full county scheme will be offi'
dally exhibited from July 1 to Sep'
tember 30.
The £l million does not include the
cost of administering the scheme or
for the construction work or acquisi'
tion of land and property which are
the normal responsibility of Govern'
ment departments.
The figure includes £701,187 for
public parks and recreation; special
city replanning. £88,868; new roads
and road widening, £152,142; com'
pensation involved in general zoning,
etc., £90,113.
From this is deducted £32,310 as
the estimated surplus after disclosing
of closed roads.
Costs to Councils.
The cost to constituent councils i-;
Newcastle ,£560,193
Maitland £173,158
Lake Macquarie £147,032
Cessnock £ 11,253
Lower Hunter .... £ 7,415
Kearsley £ 5,537
Pt. Stephens £ 5,299
The Chief County Planner, Mr.
Stone, in his report, said the estimates
have been based on the latest valua'
tions in the valuation books of the
constituent councils, plus a reasonable
percentage to bring the land affected
to the present market value.
Allowance had been made for com'
pensation for disturbing business
where considered applicable.
The estimates did not include the
cost of acquiring land for public edu'
cation, public buildings, hospitals and
institutions, crematoriums and ceme'
teries, railways, bus' depots and wharf'
age, water, sewerage, and drainage
reserves and installations, or main
roads and State highways.
These costs would require to be met
by Government departments, statu'
tory bodies, councils or trustees
whether the scheme became effective
or not.
Costs have been worked out after
an exhaustive survey of every block
of land affected by the scheme.
In computing implementation costs
Mr. Stdne used the Valuer'General’s
figures plus 25 per cent. In addition
allowance was made for disturbance
of business.
RECOVERING REINFORCEMENT
FROM CONCRETE PILES.
In many foundations using bear'
ing piles the main reinforcement in
precast concrete piles is required only
during the operations of handling and
driving. It has accordingly been sug-
gested that this reinforcement might
be made removable and this operation
has been successfully carried out by
a San Francisco contractor, Ben C.
Gerwick, after satisfactory tests.
The longitudinal reinforcement con'
sists usually of four heavy rods fitting
loosely in sheet metal or paper tube
sheaths and having threaded ends
with nuts and plate washers. These
rods are tensioned after the concrete
has hardened, thus imparting a de'
gree of prestress, which simplifies
their handling from the horizontal to
the vertical position.
Wooden cushion blocks are em-
ployed when driving the piles. After'
wards the upper nuts are removed
with an impact'type wrench and the
rods unscrewed from the bottom nuts
by a spanner working on squared up'
per ends on the rods.

MURALO Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. Port Adelaide Melbourne Sydney
Work Available for
Building Tradesmen
Says B.I.C. Executive Director.
From various quarters claims are be-
ing made that thousands of building
tradesmen are unemployed as the re-
sult of Commonwealth Government
restrictions.
The position is being capitalised for
political purposes, and figures have
been grossly exaggerated to suit the
end of certain politicians.
The statement that thousands of
building workers are out of work is
not true to fact, according to figures
quoted by the 8.1. C. Executive Di
rector, Mr. D. Stewart Fraser.
He said no tradesmen were look-
ing for work long enough to make it
worth their while applying for un-
employment relief.
Carpenters were not easy to place
in employment, although vacancies
outnumbered applicants, Mr. Fraser
added.
Figures to the end of May showed
that 200 carpenters were seeking
work and 500 vacancies were listed.
But the jobs were spread around the
country and those who wanted work
in the metropolitan area might have
to hunt for it.
Bricklayers were in a similar posi-
tion. There were 68 looking for
work, according to the latest available
figures, while 120 jobs were registered.
Plasterers appeared to be in steady
demand, there being no applicants for
67 jobs.
In regard to painters and paper-
hangers, there were onlv 37 jobs avail-
able for 65 applicants.
Figures showed that 194 unskilled
building workers were looking for
work, while only 72 jobs were regis-
tered.
Emphasising that there was no easy
money or overtime in the building in-
dustry under present conditions, Mr.
Fraser stressed the gravity of the pres-
ent position.
He felt that unless speedy relief
is afforded the industry, the unem-
ployment situation will deteriorate still
further in the near future.

Aluminium
Weatherboard House
“Tailor-made” for Australian
Climate.
Anew all-aluminium weatherboard
house has been designed by Austra-
lian and British architects in collabor-
ation, and the structure is claimed to
be eminently suitable for the Austra-
lian climate.
The manufacturers of the house, a
group of firms producing the various
component parts, have named it the
“Commonwealth House” in anticipa-
tion of large orders from Australia,
N.Z.. Rhodesia, and South and East
Africa.
States Interested.
It is understood that several State
Governments and individual firms are
interested in this “tailor-made” home
and are contemplating placing orders.
Features.
A special feature of the house is an
ingenious “anti-termite” system incor-
porated in the structure. The house
itself is built on a foundation of 12
hollow metal cones, each topped with
an aluminium “saucer” filled with
water.

In the event of a termite invasion,
it is claimed, the water will keep off
the invaders. Though how saucers
of water are to be kept from drying
out is not stated. Further termites
must have moisture, but possibly not
enough to drown themselves in.
It would take a regiment of sold-
iers to continuously fill saucers in
Queensland, were their inverted sauc-
ers that cap their foundation piers,
turned the other way up.
Large Output.
The “Commonwealth House” is
being offered to Australia at £1650
stg. each, for orders of 10 houses or
more. The makers claim an output
of 1000 a month initially, and expect
to reach a peak output of 20,000 year-
ly.
The house was designed by a Lon-
don architect, Mr. C. A. V. Smith,
and a panel of Australian architects,
headed by Mr. J. P. Mockridge, of
Melbourne, who based his plans on a
survey of the housing requirements of
Australian country areas.
Adaptable.
The house can be built in any size
or shape. A prototype recently exhib-
ited in London had three bedrooms,
combined dining and living room,
kitchen, and laundry, built into 905
sq. ft.
The kitchen and laundry featured
a labour-saving layout, with alumin-
ium built fittings.
Bedrooms, too, have built-in alu-
minium wardrobes, while the whole
house has plenty of window space.
The prototype was decorated inside
with anew type of wall and ceiling
paint, which had been sprayed on,
giving an attractive, dull finish. The
aluminium walls can take any kind
of covering, wallpaper, distemper, or
plaster, the makers say.
The main work in erecting these
homes is in the foundations, and put-
ting together the aluminium frame.
Then the aluminium roof, and strips
of aluminium, which give the walls
a “weatherboard effect”, are finally
bolted on by a two-man team, com-
pleting the whole house in the matter
of a few days.
DEVELOPMENT AND
CONTROLS.
The Liberal Party's Federal Execu-
tive is demanding a policy of expan-
sion and development but all States
represented at the meeting in Can-
berra to consider the matter, agreed
that there would be “no successful
future either for the Government or
the nation if the present policy of
contraction and controls is continued”,
to which sentiment 99 people out of
100, who are sick of controls, will
wholeheartedly agree.
HOUSING AT THE RIGHT
RENTS.
Recent British Conference.
The Housing Centre Trust, London,
recently organised a Conference at
County Hall, London, to discuss and
consider all aspects of providing
"Housing at the Right Rents.”
The brochure produced said: “The
Housing Centre believes that housing
is a human and technical problem
which should be discussed indepen-
dently of Party advantage by all those
who are working for the improvement
of housing conditions. The Centre
also attaches particular importance to
discussing these matters in a Con-
ference open to all, and will welcome
representatives of housing authorities
and members of all the housing pro-
fessions, the house-building industry,
interested citizens and visitors from
overseas, who are working for the im-
provement of housing conditions.”
It was opened by The Rt. Hon.
Harold Macmillan, Minister of Hous-
ing and Local Government, the chair-
man being Sir Patrick Abercrombie.
Subjects discussed and speakers were
as follows:
“Are Post-war Housing Standards
Too High?” by Mr. lan Murray
Leslie, A.R.1.8.A., Editor of “The
Builder.”
“Should Rents and State Assistance
Be Adjusted To Family Income?”
by Dr. Marian Bowley, 8.5.,
(Econ.), Ph.D. (author of “Hous-
ing and the State”).
“The Role of Private En erprise and
Other Housing Agencies,” by
Mr. Henry Wells, F.R.1.C.5.,
Chairman of the Hemel Hemp-
stead New Town Development
Corporation.
Slides and description of the Hous-
ing Medal Schemes, 1951, given for
the Architecture of Housing Estates,
were introduced by Mr. J. H. Forshaw,
Ch ef Architect of the Ministry of
Housing and Local Government, and
by the local authority architects re-
sponsible for the schemes.
The address of the Housing Centre
Trust, which organised the Con-
ference, is 13 Suffolk St., Haymarket,
London, S.W.I.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


TRENDS IN LIGHTING
Americans, generally, are becoming
increasingly light-conscious, and the
Con tinental nations are following suit,
using methods both sensible and
sound.
There are three ways of bringing
light into darkness. We uplight, wc
downlight, or project illumination, and
all the effects available to designers
to-day are limited to these methods,
singly or in combination.
But if there are only three basic
ways ordinarily available of getting
light on to something, there are many
ways of combining or modifying them.
The lighting industry has developed
innumerable fixtures for concentrating
or diffusing light, for concealing its
source or making it decoratively
visible, for colouring and blending all
shades and intensities.
For instance, U.S. Architect Edward
Stone, aware of the decisive role of
lighting in architecture, calls in the
lighting experts before, not after, he
designs a building.
Our photo (top) shows how light'
ing defines the shape of the stairwell
in this recently-built home, and leaves
no shadow of doubt as to where the
treads are and the height of the risers.
Lighting was as essential as building
materials in achieving the psychological
effects Mr. Stone sought.
Our centre photo shows a second
prize in table lamps (entered in a re-
cent competition) designed by a 29'
year'old Chicago Institute of Design
student.
The lamp can be adjusted to dif-
ferent heights, pinned to a wall, or
hung from a shelf. The swivelling
bonnet'shaped shade is of grey enamel'
led metal and the two short legs, act'
ing as a balancing stabiliser, slide up
and down the stem to change the
height of the lamp.
The bottom photo illustrates the
third prize design, entered by a Detroit
student. Main feature of this lamp is
a hyperbole funnel containing the
light source. Three stainless steel
rods tipped with cork balls at both
ends run through the funnel to pro-
vide legs at the base and a support for
the reflector, which can be adjusted
by moving the rods up or down.
“Homes For All”
Should Be National Cry.
A strong national opinion should
be fostered to press government action
to provide houses for every family in
Australia, the Anglican Synod in Bris-
bane was told recently.
Rev. Canon H. J. Richards of
Christ Church, Bundaberg, was speak'
ing to a special motion drawing
Synod’s attention to evils affecting
family life.
A motion was carried, “that this
Synod draws attention to certain evils
affecting family life, and calls upon
all Christian people to discover the
causes of these evils and to exert
their influence to fight and overcome
them.”
Threat to National Life.
Canon Richards said that when
Australia was threatened from outside
the Government organised to meet
the danger by floating loans to pro'
vide armaments. Similar loans could
be raised to meet the threat to na-
tional life within the country from
the shortage of homes.
“Houses are in short supply to'day
because men and materials are being
directed towards armaments and lux'
ury goods,” Canon Richards said.
“If a strong national opinion were
developed to overcome the housing
shortage, the Government would be
forced to take some action,” he added.
BRITISH VICTORY IN PERSIA.
"‘Men may make frontiers; but
locusts ignore them,” quotes John
Bigg in “Flying”.
When Persia suffered the worst lo-
cust plague she had experienced for
one hundred years she called for help
from the United States, Russia and
Britain. When Britain saw the lo'
custs were gaining ground she flew
entomologists and stocks of insecticide,
enough to treat nearly 500,000 acres
in special aircraft.
Britain’s insecticide, “Gammexane”,
a form of benzene hexachloride, the
most powerful yet known to science,
was devised in 1942 by Imperial
Chemical Industries’ Scientists. It
proved to be one hundred to one
hundred and fifty times more poison'
ous than sodium arsenate and several
times more toxic than D.D.T. Spread
round at from 25 to 50 lb. per acre,
it will kill locusts but is not harmful
to cattle or sheep. Persia forgot to
say “thank you” to the British.
(Top) US. architect Ed. Stone calls in light-
ing experts before he designs a building.
Lighting is as essential as any building ma-
terial in achieving the psychological effects
Mr. Stone seeks. (Centre) Second prize in

Mystery of Vanished
Skyscraper
Riddle Unsolved After 40 Years.
Forty-one years ago next Septemb-
er, a 16-storey building in Dyersville,
Tennessee, completely vanished into
thin air, and the mystery of its disap-
pearance has never been solved!
Imagine your amazement one morn-
ing if you discovered your office or
factory had entirely vanished —disap-
peared without fire or explosion—
leaving nothing behind but a derelict
area of ground with a few empty
bottles and old cans.
You’d probably goggle in amaze-
ment, rub your eyes, and refuse to
believe it. That’s exactly what the
citizens of the Tennessee town of
Dyersville did one September day al-
most 41 years ago.
For Dyersville’s largest skyscraper,
a 16-storey building occupying ground
space of some 900 sq. yds. was no
longer there!
Mystery.
During the night some residents
were awakened by a muffled roar.
Many people believed that an earth-
quake was the cause of the mysterious
disappearance.
But the citizens soon altered their
opinions when newspapers revealed
that in the streets leading to the build-
ing six people had been found, early
that morning, unconscious, and appar-
ently sandbagged.
Recovering in the local hospital,
they were unable to shed any light on
the mystery. Four were people
hurrying home from late parties. Two
were police officers. They told an
exactly uniform story of being
struck down by an unseen force.
Investigations.
The hard-packed clay where the
skyscraper had stood was minutely ex-
amined by the municipal authorities.
Excavations were made to a depth of
20 feet, but there were no traces of
any foundations.
Every possible avenue was investi-
gated, but the mystery only deepened.
Theories.
Could trade union men have been
responsible? When the building was
in the course of construction, trade
union men had been dismissed for
questioning the boss’s policy. One
theory is that the dismissed men de-
liberately conspired to burrow beneath
the foundations of the skyscraper and
drop it into a great subterranean cave
overnight. They covered their traces
with earth which had stood ready, and
sandbagged innocent passers-by.
Hypnotism?
This idea seems fantastic —yet
scarcely more so than the conjecture
that a hurricane ripped through Dy'
ersville, knocking people unconscious,
tearing up the skyscraper—and noth'
ing else.
At one time a reward of iA.3500
was offered for useful information on
the missing skyscraper. The only ex-
planation which can solve the prob'
lem is hypnotism. Were the people
of Dyersvills hypnotised into thinking
there had been a skyscraper? If so,
the townsfolk had been duped in a
big way.
Now that the atomic bomb, that
will disintegrate everything it aims at
into thin air, is being re-discovered,
perhaps the solution is nearer than
ever.
Be that as it may, if the manv
theories that have been put forward,
no one has ever succeeded in solving
the riddle.
POMPEII IS COMING BACK.
Ghost City Rises Again.
The city of Pompeii, buried by the
volcanic eruption of Vesuvius, is rising
again from its ashes, and one can now
walk the very stones that Roman feet
once trod. V.
The most ambitious programme of
excavation ever attempted at Pompeii
has begun, and hundreds of men will
be employed on the work in the next
few years.
The new diggings will probably re-
veal streets complete in their entirety,
for the layers of ashes, cinders and
volcanic stones which buried the city
have acted as a natural preservative.
The secret of Pompeii might never
have been discovered had it not been
for an Italian peasant who came across
traces of an ancient civilisation in his
vineyard. Even then no systematic ex-
ploration was organised.
For one hundred years there were
desultory searches over the site, which,
revealed new clues to a buried city.
Then, in 1861, organised excavations
were started and Pompeii began to
yield up its treasures.
To-day, visitors can stand in the
streets of Pompeii, where time sudden-
ly stood still in August, A.D.79, and
a terrible hail of pumice and volcanic
-ash -completely engulfed the doomed
city within three dreadful days.
[Wh en the Editress of this Journal
toured Pompeii 30 years ago, it was
possible to walk along the long streets
of cobblestones, enter a gate to one of
the homes, turn on the fountain at
the gate, and later from the reclinum
turn off the water, if one wanted to
sleep after dining in the Italian man'
ner.}
SPECIALIZED BUILDINGS.
In days gone by it was possible to gain
some idea of a building’s purpose from look-
ing at it. Today, however, this is no longer
true for, under the influence of functionalism
and utilarianism a library may look like a
factory and vice versa. Never before, per-
haps, has such skill and knowledge gone into
the designing of buildings for specific purposes.
The entire needs for which the building is re-
quired is most carefully analysed by experts
and it is upon the specific facts so developed
that the ultimate structure is produced and
takes its plan and form. Particularly is this
noticeable in the variety in fenestration. We
illustrate three recent American examples of
this fact. (Top) New building for the New
York headquarters of the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
(Middle) New plant for the Electrolux Cor-
poration at Old Greenwich, Connecticut.
(Bottom) The Security Life & Trust Build-
ing, Winston-Salem, recently completed to
house the administrative offices and which is
evidence of the tendency for such large com-
panies to accommodate this section of their
organisation in smaller, personally-owned
buildings entirely devoted to their use.

Constructional
Activity Means
Industrial Prosperity
The fiscal year 1951-52 will be long
remembered for its remarkable trials,
through our Federal Government hav-
ing to adopt such drastic measures to
prevent our country from crashing, as
other countries have crashed. When
the Editor of “Construction” was in
Germany, the mark (normally valued
at about 1/') was valued at 250,000
to the English <£; later in London 1,-
000,000,000 were purchased for Id. by
a member of this staff. Greek drachmas
(worth about lOd.) were blowing
round the streets of Athens in such
numbers that no one would be both'
ered to pick up the valueless things.
In China, not so long ago, a cartload
of sen would just about buy a loaf of
bread.
Our governments could have gone
on printing paper money and each
printing would reduce the value of the
<£ (now worth about 8/'). Instead
they chose the hard way of stopping
the crash. Perhaps no one but Mr.
Menzies could foresee what is now
headline news: <£397,000,000 deficit,
whilst England is in a still more dif-
ficult plight—all through living be-
yond her income. England lavished
all the money she received from Amer-
ica on welfare for the people. Teeth,
glasses, medical supplies that people
have paid for all through the years,
have, since the war, been carried out
at government expense—and “hang
the country’s economy”.
People here complain that only 12
months ago there was no unemploy-
ment, but they do not say that in
government departments people were
being paid for 8 hours' work when
they only did two hours’ work, which
means there was 6 hours unemploy-
ment in every day by each workman,
and that, on an average, 3 men out of
4 were unemployed though they re-
ceived payment, from taxation impos-
ed on others that were conscientiously
working. Practically every boy leaving
school is induced to take a govern-
ment job, where they are taught to idle
the hours away. They haven't a trade
at their finger tips for future living.
We must see that we do not become
a nation of idlers. This wastage should
be stopped immediately all over Aus-
tralia. Construction volume during the
past fiscal year has dried, up badly.
The lack of many things is to blame.
• There was a lack of materials
(now' there are plenty of them);
• Lack of the will to work (a
creeping paralysis, still with us).
• Lack of vision (people are too
selfish to think of the future. They

3T MIXER
3 Cu. Ft. Wet Concrete
The Champion 3T Trailer Mixer is a j bag capacity high speed
machine which mixes 3 cu. ft. per batch while output is 3 cu. yds.
per hour. It is powered by a 2 h.p. totally enclosed ‘Champion’
vertical petrol engine. Work is speeded up by the patented
Simplex reverse blade mixing system and recoil spring loader for
minimum labour. No time or energy is lost as the loader hopper
can be filled while the mixer is operating or unloading a previous
charge. The spring axle permits a high towing speed and the
offset position of the drum enables the mix to be deposited directly
into a barrow without removing or adjusting any parts of the
machine.

• Lack of leadership (in the build-
ing fraternity we have plenty of lead-
ers. They are just twiddling their
thumbs waiting for financial restric-
tions and all controls to be lifted to
enable them to forge ahead).
• Lack of finance (this might ease
up suddenly, for the banks are full
of people’s savings. The Common-
wealth and Trading Banks have assets
totalling £1,627,441,000. They have
liabilities galore but there is a good
margin. The Trading Banks alone
have deposits totalling £837,444,000.
Some of this should be released im-
mediately. Some risks must be taken.
The A.M.P. has written up £100,000,-
000 worth of new Insurance Business
in 12 months and all other Insurance
Companies can report a similar or pro-
portionate activity. There will be a
lot of money about as soon as the
Government will let it flow. These
Insurance Companies would be willing
to finance many buildings.
All these influences and restrictions
add up to present hardships, but it
cannot remain that way for long with
industry slowing to a standstill, con-
struction stagnant, commerce dor-
mant . . .
Why?
The answer is contained in one brief
sentence . . . “Construction Activity
Means Industrial Prosperity”.
In other words, put bluntly:
“Encourage Construction and In-
dustry will Thrive!"
It’s as simple as that!
It is a national tragedy that we are
not even keeping pace with the needs
of our expanding population, but are
lagging far behind.
(N.S.W. started 1952 with a short-
age of 100,000 homes, and not a single
public building on the boards. The
present lag in building will add another
10,000 homes to the total figure of
shortages which ushered in this year.)
The nation has dismally failed to
meet the demand for better housing
which comes with the general ad-
vance in living standards. Our homes
have never been so poverty stricken
as the prefabs now being regarded by
people "as least it is a home’’.
The past fiscal year should have wit-
nessed a considerable increase in con-
tracts for new industrial and commer-
cial buildings and for public works and
utilities. Instead, there is little to sug-
gest an effort to meet the needs for
more efficient, comfortable, and attrac-
tive factories, stores and office build-
ings.
An increasing proportion of con-
struction for the next few years will
relieve the acute housing shortage,
and help to supply the demands of
workers whose advancing earnings en-
able them to afford better quarters
than ever before.
Improvement in the methods of fi-
nancing dwellings is badly needed,
especially for families of the lower
income groups.
Eliminate Waste.
Wanted, also, is a general move'
ment throughout the country for elim'
ination of waste in labour, produc-
tion, and distribution. This wastage
must cost Australia a staggering
amount each year, and adds immeas-
urably to the nation’s present inflation
fever.
Programme Wanted.
What is wanted, and wanted urgent-
ly, is a programme designed funda-
mentally to stimulate action among
industries, trades, and consumers them-
selves.
It is obviously not the function of
government to manage business —in
fact, they invariably bungle it when
they even attempt to. An instance of
this bungling mav be noted right now
in the loss of £5,750,000 on transport.
It should be the function of the gov-
ernment to inspire and assist in co-
operative action, in reduction of waste,
the bringing about of more stable
employment to building trades work-
ers and others, and the boosting of
constructional activity across the na-
tion.

Effect of Rising
Prices on Housing
In New British Towns Development.
The greatest possible care in design
has been taken to explore every pos'
sible avenue of saving, and, while still
erecting sound houses, to decrease the
cost by reducing the specification or
by tighter planning, stated Sir Thomas
Bennett, chairman of Crawley Develop'
ment Corporation, when he recently
presented a report upon the activities
of the Corporation during the past
year.
“In spite of all these efforts,” he
said, “the cost of a specific house,
tendered for each year from 1948'52,
plus the effect of the increased rate of
interest, has made it necessary for the
Corporation to secure a return for the
house, which has risen from £79 a
year in 1948 to £127 a year in 1952.
“The increased subsidy will go some
distance towards modifying the impact
of these increases upon the tenants,
but it still leaves the rent at a substaiv
dally higher figure tha nlhe Corpora'
tion would wish.
“This problem of rent is a national
problem of the first importance. It is
more difficult to solve in the case of
a corporation than in the case of a
local authority; firstly because a cor'
poration is governed by the Rents
Restriction Act ;and secondly because
it has no alternative heads of expends
ture to saddle with a portion of the
costs, and therefore its rents are a
true reflection of the total cost of the
houses.
Factory Development.
During the course of his address,
Sir Thomas said:
“The total cost of contracts in the
industrial area for roads and buildings
let by the Crawley Development Cor'
poration, including standard factory
units, is £550,000.
“The estimated value of factories
built, building, or to be built by in-
dustrialists themselves, will amount to
£1,600,000.”
Provision for the future employment
of the inhabitants of Crawley has con-
tinned with extreme pressure, and the
position as at present established shows
that employees of these firms will oc'
cupy all the houses that the Corpora'
tion can build until the middle of
1953, and possibly longer. Up to the
present, 80 per cent, to 90 per cent,
of the employees of incoming indus'
tries are moving to Crawley with their
employers.

Commonwealth Government env
ployment rose by 1600 in March to
200,600, the highest figure since Sep'
tember, 1951, when the effect of the
12,500 cut was most marked.
HOUSING VARIATIONS.
It is always a matter of interest to compare
the manner in which different nationalities
solve similar problems. Take a house for
example. In the upper illustration American
architect Frank Lloyd Wright gives his inter-
pretation in a house at Ordmore, Pennsyl-
vania, which has the heavy horizontality so
characteristic of this architect. (Middle) A
Swiss house in which the snug low-lying
character and timber construction of this

fectiveness. (Bottom) A housing scheme in

BRITISH SCHOOL AND
INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.
Since the war British architects have made
noteworthy contributions in the field of school
design and construction. Our two upper il-
lustrations show a fine new school recently
completed in which the Orlit system of pre-
cast concrete and pre-stressed concrete has
been used and which it is claimed reduced
the construction period by several months.
The heavy divisional “fin-like” walls between
the windows in addition to imparting shade
to the windows give character to the design
as also do the circular “portholes” used
both in row and echelon. The amenities
block at the huge plant of the Steel Com-
pany of Wales (below) are located immedi-
ately adjacent to the mill buildings.

Tools," in which the commonest tools
are illustrated and their use and care
described, like details of nuts, bolts,
nails, screws, brads, clouts, rivets, etc.
Altogether this is a most useful little
book to have tucked away so that
when there are things to be done it
can be produced and-will supply the
answer. To the conscientious “Handy'
man” the quotation at the beginning
is also very true: “Let a man once
feel the mastery of his craft and his
whole spirit rejoices."
TOWER CRANE FOR LONDON.
Continental Practice Adopted.
The use of tower cranes is beginning
to find favour with British builders,
and the latest to arrive from the Con'
tinent has just been erected on the site
near Guy’s Hospital, London, where
G. E. Wallace and Sons Ltd. are build'
ing an office block for King Edward
Hospital of London Fund authorities.
It was purchased by the contractors
from Brun and Co. Ltd., of Lucerne,
Switzerland.
Details are as follows: Maximum
radius, 52ft., giving a height of 58.6 ft.
under the pulley: minimum radius,
19.6 ft., giving a height of 99ft. under
the pullev. The maximum .load is two
tons. Electrically powered, with a
speed of 65ft. per minute up to 130 ft.
per minute with a light load.
The weight of the machine is 12
tons, plus tons of ballast, and it
has a track gauge of 9ft. 2in.

Work Proceeding on Luxury Flats
Considerable progress has been made
on the construction of the £1 million
block of luxury flats by the Housing
Commission, and the block, although
only partly finished, already domin'
ates the North Shore skyline.
These flats, at Milson’s Point,- will
most certainly cost £l million by the
time they are finished, which is con'
siderably above the original estimate.
Tiny one'bedroom unfurnished flats
measuring 28ft. by 18ft. will bring
rentals of £3/10/0 a week and two'
bedroom flats are £4/10/0 a week.
That does not include refrigeration
or hot water.
In these flats the kitchenette meas'
ures only 4ft. by 10ft.
No one with a family can possibly
live in them, and it seems obvious
that people who can afford these high
rentals should be in a position to erect
their own homes.
Despite heavy cutbacks in public
works and other housing projects, the
Commission is rushing these flats to
completion, as well as another block
of flats, around which the “Geraghty
Incident" raged.
View of the £1 million block
of luxury flats under construc-
tion at Milson’s Point. These
flats are being erected for the
N.S.W. Housing Commission,
and will dominate the skyline
at the north end of the Har-
bour Bridge. Since this photo
was taken, several floors of
steelwork have been added to
the right hand structure.

FOUR QUAINT DESIGNS.
There is a character of “quaintness” about these four homes contributed mainly by the roof lines and the dormer
windows, for each has that comfortable “old world” charm that still spells home to many people. The com-
bination of the stone wing with the plain walls in the top right example forms an attractive contrast, while the
barn-like ends to the roof on the bottom left, set off by the triple dormers, impart a snug affect. The top left
roof treatment with its double pitch seems to be a cross between a mansard and a pitched root. Bottom right
with its steeply-pitched roof is a style that was particularly popular in Sydney suburbs in the palmy pre-war days.

THE DISTINCTIVE CHIMNEY.
In the study of domestic architecture over the years and in many lands, there is perhaps no more distinctive
feature than the chimney. The richly decorated chimneys was the crowning glory of the great Tudor and Eliz-
abethan piles. Huge and ponderous stacks dominated Victorian mansions. The chimney in the top right cottage
is rather ungainly in shape and looks rather like a milk bottle, while in the other three examples—stubby little
nonentities show how this former dominant feature has deteriorated into a mere appendage and in many cases,
where the open fireplace has been eliminated altogether, it has ceased to b &.

Cookers for the Blind
New British Development.
A small and simple mechanism in-
vented by SOyear'old Mr. G. W. D.
Currey, a G.E.C. Service Engineer,
has enabled a standard electric cooker
to be so modified that the blind can
cook successfully even the most elab'
orate meal.
The device consists of two units
each complementary to the other:
one indicates, by means of a trip
mechanism, various temperature set'
tings on the “Simmerswitch” and
thermostat controls, the other is an
electrical relay in series with the
thermostat which, when energised,,
pushes out an indicator button through
the switch panel on the cooker front
and at the same time rings a low
tone bell to indicate that the cooker
is switched “on’ .
When the temperature, as set on
the thermostat is reached, a high tone
bell rings and the button recedes into
the cooker. The blind person has
then merely to set her braille process
timer before placing her cake, or
whatever else she may be cooking, in
the oven.
It is a happy coincidence that this
invention has been made available for
the first time during the week which
commemorates the centenary of Louis
Braille.

How Registration of
Builders Protects
Public
A West Australian Instance.
In the Perth Police Court recently,
Francis Oliver Grainger, of Planet
Street, Carlisle, appeared before Mr.
F. E. A. Bateman. R.M.
Grainger vvaS charged with having,
as an unregistered builder, construct'
ed a building for immediate sale.
“This type of offence constitutes a
fraud on the public who think they
are getting a home built by a quali'
fied tradesman,’ said Mr. G. Ham'
mond, who represented the Builders
Registration Board.
Mr. Hammond told the Court that
Grainger was granted permission to
build a house because he said it was
for his own use. After it had been
erected, however, the house was sold.
(All builders within a 25'mile
radius of Perth are required, by law,
to be registered.)

BRISTOL FREIGHTERS FOR ROYAL
NEW ZEALAND AIR FORCE.
A number of aircraft of this versatile type
are being supplied to the R.N.Z.A.F. Thev
are a modification of the standard Bristol
Freighter and are equipped for casualty evac-
uation, supply dropping, freight transport
troop transport and air-sea rescue work. They
may also be employed in the specialist civil
role of aerial top-dressing in which case they
will be fitted with three two-ton capacity
fertiliser hoppers. The photographs show,
first, the light-weight, canvas-backed scats
fitted for troop transport; second, one of the
aircraft at Fulton, Bristol, preparing to take
off for New Zealand; third, the gravity roller
conveyors installed in the aircraft’s hold for
use in supply dropping.

A STUDY IN CONTRASTS.
It is interesting to compare the two upper designs. That to the right has dignity and the four-square solidity of
the Georgian, but is lacking in the niceties of proportion and detail that characterises that attractive style and
as a result it looks just a massive house. The lefthand example looks quaint and homely with its upper storey
in timber jutting out over the lower in the manner of the old 'English timber-framed house, though half-timber
and brick rigging has wisely been eschewed. Bottom right is also an impressive house somewhat in the French
Provincial style though shorn of its detail and “fussiness”. Bottom left, in contrast to the other three looks very
simple. Its living room surrounded by passages and other services with two large windows should be extremely
cool in summer and warm in winter.
