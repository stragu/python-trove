Since 1889
How to streamline a stable
fyz N»*
The difference between 1889—when
Wormald Brothers Industries was
founded and 1954 —is the dif-
ference between mutton-chop whiskers
and a crew cut; between listening to
the band in the park on Sundays—
and taking a portable radio to a bar-
becue; between clumsy stable doors
and doors that slide open and shut
with a finger’s push. The most efficient
sliding doors slide on Bangor tracks, a
product of Wormald Brothers Indus-
tries. Country men know the time-
*
saving, work-saving value of these
smooth, silent tracks. They have been
fitted to grain storage sheds, wool
sheds, garages, and other buildings on
properties throughout Australia and
New Zealand.
In 1889 we employed nine people.
This industry has grown with the
nation and played its part in the pro-
gress of the nation. Today we employ
just on 2,000 people throughout
Australia and New Zealand.

THE ARCHITECTURAL CONVENTION
The Architectural Convention held in Sydney from May 10 to 14 inclusive
was an event of considerable importance.
Not only did the leading architects from all over Australia converge to discuss
their mutual problems, but in addition a number of important architects from other
countries came to Australia to participate in this Convention.
The most important of these overseas guests of the architectural profession
was Professor Walter Gropius, who is generally conceded to be one of the out'
tanding minds to have influenced modern architectural thought and development.
Since his institution of the famous Bauhaus (School of Building) in Germany in
1918 and—after the Nazi regime—his subsequent work at Harvard University in
America, his logical, clear thinking, as well as his writings, lectures and work,
has had great influence throughout the world.
It is, indeed, an event of importance to have this world figure delivering lectures
in our city, and a stimulating experience to Australian architects.
Another important visitor was Robert Matthew, Professor of Architecture at
Edinburgh University, who was formerly Chief Architect of the London County
Council, and is universally known as the designer of the Royal Festive Hall.
This was the outstanding permanent building erected for the Festival of Britain
and one of the few modern buildings of any importance erected in London since
the war.
An aspect that had significance far beyond the architectural profession was
the presence of prominent architects from New Zealand and the Philippines, for
this symbolises a gathering together of those whose interests are primarily in those
countries bordering on the Pacific.
That they should for the first time congregate in Australia, in the new world,
instead of as before in the older centres of civilisation, is significant of the develop'
ment of Australia’s national status.
The Building Industry was quick to appreciate the importance of this Con'
ference and, as usual, came forward with splendid spirit to make the Architectural
and Building Exhibition at the Town Hall one of the most striking and stimulating
that has been seen, illustrating the scope, capacity and quality of the specialist
organisations and material manufacturers and suppliers that contribute so com'
prehensively to the industry that shapes the future of the country.
Churchill, in one of his succinct sayings remarked when the rebuilding of the
House of Commons was under discussion: “We first shape our buildings and then
they shape us.”
Hence the vital importance that the buildings of the future should be cast
in the correct shape. Whenever architects come together amongst themselves they
naturally debate these points, and the last word will, of course, never be said.
Good architecture, however, demands more than a good architect; it also requires
a good client, and a good client is one who also is progressive in his outlook and
wishes to have nothing but the best that modern design and structural methods
can produce for the buildings of all types to serve the people’s needs in this modern
age.
Gatherings such as these have a dual purpose. They stimulate the designers
and planners of the future by the mental impact of mutual debate and discussion;
they also bring about increased public awareness of these changes in thought that
are gathering momentum all over the world. Members of The Royal Australian
Institute of Architects are to be congratulated upon their initiative in promoting
this Convention which will undoubtedly prove of considerable value to them and
to Australia.

SUCCESSFUL ARCHITECTURAL CONVENTION
OFFICIAL OPENING BY THE GOVERNOR.
600 DELEGATES FROM OVERSEAS AND AUSTRALIA.
The Fourth Australian Architectural
Convention was officially opened on
May 10th by His Excellency
Lieut.'General Sir John Northcott,
Governor of New South Wales, at the
Australia Hotel, which is the official
headquarters of the Convention.
The Conference Chairman, Profes'
sor H. Ingham Ashworth, in his open'
ing remarks, said that the Royal Aus'
tralian Institute of Architects, who had
organised the Convention were very
gratified at the number of distinguish'
ed architects from overseas who had
come to Australia to attend its ses'
sions, and on behalf of the Architects
of Australia he gave them a cordial
welcome.
Overseas Architects Attend.
Architects from other countries who
had come to the Convention ihclud'
ed: Professor Walter Gropius (Amer'
ica); Professor Robert Matthew
(Great Britain); Mr. J. K. Schonle'
ben (Germany Western Federal Re-
public); Mr. Orestes Yakas (Greece);
Mr. J. L. King, Mr. j. H. HalhKenney,
Mr. F. D. Stewart (New Zealand);
Mr. Elias L. Ruiz and Mr. Cresenciano
de Castro (Philippines); Mr. W. A.
Macdonald (South Africa).
Mr. R. S. Demaine, President,
Royal Australian Institute of Archi'
tects, and Mr. E. W. Andrew, Presi'
dent of the N.S.W. Chapter of the
R.A.1.A., supported the Professor in
extending welcome to the delegates of
the Conference, some 600 of whom
are attending the sessions.
Governors and Architects.
His Excellency the Governor said
that State Governors had from time
to time in the past become con'
siderably involved in architectural and
building matters, and he quoted from
old official records certain extracts
from instructions issued by Governor
Lachlan Macquarie to his architect,
Francis Greenway. As is well known
the ambitious nature of some of these
plans, which had been considered
much too grandiose by the Home
Authorities, subsequently led to Mac'
quarie’s recall.
Sir John said that he did know
something of building as he had be'
come expert in the laying of founda'
tion stones and had an unrivalled coh
lection of silver trowels to prove it.
High building costs is perhaps the
greatest single problem confronting
the building industry in the provision
of houses, he said.
Old and New Buildings.
Sir Stephen Holmes, the United
Kingdom High Commissioner, made
a plea for the preservation of some
of Australia’s old buildings, for while,
he said, “I fully applaud and appre'
date the necessity for new buildings
to be in accordance with the architec'
ture of the present day, I believe it is
important for us to have at the same
time good examples of the architecture
of yesterday, for otherwise we have
nothing as a basis for comparison.”
He charged town planners that, where
such buildings tended to interfere
with their plans, they should take
steps “to go round them instead of
through them,” a remark that was
greeted with applause.
Sir Stephen said there is a grave
danger these days of having buildings
which are neither temporary or per'
manent. At Aldershot Barracks in
London, he continued, are temporary
buildings erected during the Crimean
War, and that was a hundred years
ago.”
The Minister for Works and Local
Government, Mr. J. B. Renshaw, who
was unable to attend the opening cere'
mony, was represented by the Minister
for Justice, the Hon. R. R. Downing.
Background to the Convention dais
consisted of huge enlarged photo'
graphs of the United Nations Head'
quarters in New York flanked by the
flags of all the United Nations.
Honorary Degree for
Professor Gropius.
The Vice Chancellor of the Univers'

lecture on “Is There a Science of De-
sign?” at the Great Hall at the Uni-
versity.
Fine Exhibition of Photographs.
On Monday afternoon the Interna-
tional Architectural Exhibition of
Photographs and Models at David
Jones’ Art Gallery was officially open-
ed by Professor A. D. Trendall.
In his address the Professor said
that it was undoubtedly necessary for
a steady “cross-fertilisation of new
ideas” to take place in architecture if
healthy progress was to be maintained.
An Exhibition of this nature which
embraced exhibits from many coun-
tries performed this purpose not only
Continued from oage 1
for architects, but for the general pub-
lic as veil. Australia must look to
the future rather than to the past, but
we must not neglect the past. He
was gratified to see that a fine collec-
tion of photographs of some of the
Early Colonial architecture of New
South Wales had been included.
The outstanding feature of the Ex-
hibition was the very large model of
the centre of a country town embrac-
ing the buildings to serve various
community needs, which had been de-
signed and constructed by students of
the Faculty of Architecture at the Uni-
versity of Sydney. He considered that
this was one of the finest examples of
architectural model-making that had
been seen in Sydney for many years.
A short film made by students of
the University Architectural School
embracing some of the Early Colonial
and Gothic buildings of Sydney was
subsequently screened to the large
gathering which filled the hell.
The Exhibition embraces good col-
lections of large photographs of mod-
ern buildings from England, France,
America, Germany, Greece, Canada,
New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Malta,
Belgium and Indonesia. There is also
a special exhibition of the work of
a firm of Italian architects on dis-
play at the Macquarie Galleries.
Later in the afternoon an Archi-
tectural Miscellany of paintings, prints
and drawings at the National Art Gal-
lery was opened by the Minister for
the Philippines, Judge Roberto Regala,
while in the evening at the Hotel Aus-
tralia Professor Walter Gropius gave
his paper entitled “The Scope of Total
Architecture” (see below).
TOTAL ARCHITECTURE
PROFESSOR WALTER GROPIUS ADDRESSES ARCHITECTS.
Professor Walter Gropius has been
a name known to architects the world
over for many years as one of the
foremost exponents of modern archi-
tectural thought. His stature as a
world leader in this sphere for so long
has been such that he is known to
the general public as well.
That his reputation is in no way
overdrawn was made convincingly ap-
parent at the first address that he de-
livered on May 10th at the
Hotel Australia to the Fourth Aus-
tralian Architectural Convention.
A quiet man in ordinary conversa-
tion, the Professor, in spite of his 71
years, becomes vital and inspiring
when explaining his architectural be-
liefs and for well over an hour he
held the audience which filled the hall
to overflowing and subsequently de-
lighted them with the thoughtful but
straightforward answers that he gave
to a number of questions at the ter-
mination of the address.
Modern Life Out of Balance.
He commenced by tracing the ills
;hat have overcome oj: \*ay of life
since the advent of the machine age
which had thrown the age-old tenor
of simple community life out of gear
so that today modern civilisation is in
many ways floundering in frustration
to achieve that satisfaction of psyche
which is just as important as the min-
istering to our material needs. We
have, he said, “developed a Gallup
Poll mentality and a Quiz Kid out-
look.” The ever-accelerating develop-
ment of the world resulting from the
industrial revolution and the machine
age followed by the intensification of
the application of science to everyday
life has thrown us out of balance.
“The artist,” he continued, “tends
to be the forgotten man” in this cen-
tury of science. Art, in fact, is re-
garded as a commodity created in con-
siderable quantities in the past and
stored in museums to be tapped off
when required. The artist, he said, is
the antidote to mechanisation, and in
his view the solution is to recreate the
balance by a proper relationship being
formed between the artist, the scient-
ist and the business man. By this
means it would be possible to human-
ise the impact of the machine upon
society.
Pedestrian Squares.
His keen observation was apparent
when commenting upon the impact
of the “automobile” on modern life.
He said that it would seem that the
pedestrian in Sydney has a little more
right than in New York, where they
continue to survive solely by flatten-
ing themselves against the buildings
to overcome the onslaughts of the
hordes of speeding cars.
He advocated in all developmental
schemes the provision of “pedestrian
squares,” completely enclosed so as to
be protected from the motor car.
These, he said, are essential for the
development of that social intercourse
that is vital for the wellbeing of any
community.
The great Piazza of St. Marks in
Venice is one of the finest examples
of such a square.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Community Centre First.
Housing is, of course, of great im'
portance, but in every new develop'
ment it is the community centre that
should be built before the housing for
it is herein that the social being of
the community is created and sustain'
ed.
In his view architectural develop'
ment will follow the line of the great'
er prefabrication of the individual
parts of a building rather than the
prefabrication of a complete house.
The architect need not fear that as a
result of this the house of the future
will be regimented. On the contrary
the prefabricated parts will be like a
box of blocks to a small boy and the
ways of arranging and rearranging
would be infinite. The advantages of
architects being associated with indus'
try in the production of these various
components was obvious.
He showed a most interesting slide
of an exercise given to his students
in the Bauhaus in Germany 35 years
ago, which consisted of the five or six
basic parts that go to make up the
common kettle—bowl, handle, spout,
base, etc. —the illustration showing the
innumerable different interpretations
that had resulted from .he co-ordinat'
ing of these parts in different ways.
An International Style.
He tilted at the claim often made
that the modern or contemporary style
of architecture is an international one
and is devoid of national characters'
tics. “On the contrary,” he said, “if
we wish to look at an international
style, here we have it,” and showed
an illustration of the National Gallery
of Art at Washington with its great
Grecian portico. “Buildings of this
type,” he said, “are to be seen in vir'
tually every city of the world. You
have some too!”
The using of these old styles to
clothe modern buildings was not ar-
chitecture, but “applied archaeology.”
The people who developed these styles
to fit the particular needs and cus'
toms of their age would be the first
to have condemned this blind reusage
of these forms in such totally differ'
ent days.
He showed illustrations of the Har-
vard Graduate Centre, which was the
first building, after years of argument,
to be erected at Harvard that had not
followed the original Georgian style.
Although the old style was not used,
considerable study, however, was given
to the general feeling of the previous
architecture and the new buildings
follow the system of open courtyards
that is so characteristic of the layout
of this University. A point often
forgotten he said, is that the size of
the open space between the buildings
is just as important as the proportions
of the buildings themselves.
The Terrace House.
Another example of his keen eye,
having regard to the fact that he has
only been in Australia for a few days,
was when he referred to the rows of
Victorian and Georgian terrace houses
that he had seen in Sydney and Mel'
bourne. These, he said, with their
compactness and basic dignity, had
impressed him as being an excellent
solution of the housing problem that
faced a community of those days.
Study of this form, he felt, could be
made with advantage in the solving
of present day housing in city areas.
$75,000,0*00 Project.
In the final sections of his address
Professor Gropius showed models of
a great community developmental
scheme embracing a great hotel, a
thirty'Storey office block, a motel, sup'
ermarket, conference hall to seat 6000
and many other features, that it is
proposed to develop right in the
centre of the city area of Boston. The
cost of this great scheme is 75,000,000
dollars (<£A.33,000,000), and he said,
amidst delighted chuckles from his ar'
chitect audience, “I am glad to hear
that the necessary finance appears to
be coming along nicely.”
In conclusion he said that the ar'
chitect, to fully perform his functions
in modern life, has to have “human
qualities” for otherwise he will be
completely unable to develop the
“Total Architecture” that is necessary
to bring our modern civilisation back
to conditions that will make life a
satisfying experience for the average
man and woman.
DEVELOPMENTS IN BUILDING
MODERN BRITISH TRENDS.
ADDRESS BY PROFESSOR ROBERT MATTHEW.
Professor Robert Matthew, Professor
of Architecture at the Edinburgh Uni-
versity, in his address to the Fourth
Australian Architectural Convention
on May 11th in his opening re'
marks quoted Sir Winston Churchill
speaking of the restored House of
Commons, when he said first
shape our buildings and they then
shape us.” This, said the Professor,
seems to put in a nutshell the relation
between architecture and society. He
then proceeded to speak of some of
the forces that are at work in deveh
oping this shape.
Tyranny of the Flat Roof.
During the war years the necessity
of spanning great spaces with a min-
imum of vertical supports produced
an extensive reexamination of the
theories of structures, leading directly
to a flexibility in roof design greater
than we have known for a long time.
The whole conception of the space'
frame, in its many forms, crystallised
during this period and since then “the
tyranny of the flat roof,” for so long
the symbol of the new architecture,
has to a great extent been modified,
for this form with constant repetition
can be as monotonous as any other.
Great Opportunity Lost.
He expressed the view that at the
end of the war a great opportunity
to shape the whole future development
of building was lost, for control of
production was complete both in re'
lation to material and manpower, and
the certainty of great building demand
immediately the war was over was evi'
dent to everyone. Here was the gold'
en opportunity to set new “norms” in
building, for the design for machine
production of a range of essential
building components, interchangeable
for all types of building.
As we know this did not happen.
Production became frittered away on
a score or two of prefabricated house
types each designed independently as
complete buildings, with no common
interchangeable elements.
The economic advantage of a large
scale link up with industry on the

tion on "The Scope of Total Architec-
ture at the Hotel Australia.

basis of a centrally planned source of
small components “which would have
imposed no more aesthetic restrictions
on the architect than the production
of the standard brick” was thus thrown
away.
Nevertheless the industrial pro-
ducer had at last got his foot firmly
in the door of the building industry
and this factor may well alter pro-
foundly the whole character of build-
ing in the future.
Building By-laws.
The Professor had something to say
on the vexed question of building by*
laws and regulations, a subject, he
said, with which he was somewhat
conversant, having, as Chief Architect
of the London County Council, had
to administer these regulations for
seven years.
He said that he had at times been
surprised at the apparent indifference
of some architects and builders to
what might happen to their buildings
once they were built. He referred
to the possible effects of fire. The
bland assumption that because a build-
ing is constructed of steel, cement and
glass there could be no substantial fire
risk was recently blown skyhigh by
the disastrous fifty million dollar fire
at the General Motors plant at Lavonia,
which was a modern single storey fac-
tory embracing the latest design and
materials.
New Outlook Overdue.
A new outlook on building regula-
tions is long overdue, and he quoted
from the new model by-laws issued a
few months ago by the Government
in Scotland:
“The main objectives of the new
model by-laws are to allow greater
freedom in the use of new materials
and methods; to secure economy and
the best possible use of materials, but
at the same time, to set safe and cer-
tain standards. To achieve this, it has
been necessary to draft model by-laws
very different in form from the pre-
vious ones.
“Each group of by-laws now relates
to a particular function to be perform-
ed by a building—e.g., its capability
of withstanding specified loads.
“The requirements for a particular
function generally take the form of
performance standards which specify
to what degree the building, or part
of the building must be capable of
performing that function: they do not
make it obligatory to adopt any speci-
fied form of construction.
“There is freedom to use any ma-
terial in any form of construction that
will achieve the required standards:
and designers will, when the occasion
demands, be enabled to design for a
particular purpose, with resulting econ-
omy and efficiency.”
More Buildings by Architects.
Many architects, he said, had de-
plored the fact that today so much of
the architectural work in Britain was
carried out by various public author-
ities. On examining this fact, how-
ever, it was revealed that today the
vast majority of these major building
instrumentalities have architectural
sections adequately staffed by talented
young architects so that in actual fact
today some 85 per cent, to 90 per
cent, of new building is produced by
architects compared with 25 per cent,
or 30 per cent, at the most before the
war.
As a result of the continuous pro-
grammes of construction which it is
now possible to formulate as a result
of the great demand for all types of
buildings, the architect today finds that
he is not only responsible for design
but also for production for these pro-
grammes are part of the national econ-
omy geared to an exacting time-table
so that the architect finds himself in
the curious position not only of artist-
designer but also that of production
manager.
New Building Development.
The Professor, discussing the future
of the building industry, mentioned
a most interesting experiment that is
being carried out by the L.C.C. at the
present time and to explain it clearly
he quoted the following official state-
ment from the London County Coun-
cil:
“We believe that there is some
scope for savings in cost, and for
quicker construction without extra
cost if the planning of the design,
erection and engineering work of a
scheme of development could be urn
dertaken by the architect, the struct'
ural engineer, the quantity surveyor
and the contractor working together
as a team from the outset.
“As an experiment we propose, for
the purpose of ieveloping certain new
techniques, that a consulting engineer
and a nominated contractor should be
appointed to collaborate with the
Council’s architect and quantity survey'
or for the first phase of the develop'
ment of the Picton Street side. Cam'
berwell, from the design stage on'
wards.”
Two very large experiments of this
kind are now in progress, said the Pro'
fessor, and they may well mark, if
these are successful, a milestone in the
history of building. Here, the client,
the designers, the costing surveyor and
the builder are coming together at the
start —one would think a simple neces'
sity in rational building, but how sel-
dom, in the modern world, has it been
achieved!
Australia’s expansion of electrical
domestic appliances from her own fac'
tones in 1953 is indicated by the fob
lowing figures in excess of 1952 —
63.000 more refrigerators, 33,000
more washing machines, 40,000 more
electric irons, 15,000 more toasters,
24.000 more hot water jugs, 60,000
more food mixers. Output of radio
sets and radiograms was 113,000 and
24.000 higher respectively. Federal

Building and
Architectural
Exhibition
Splendid Display at Town Hall.
Visited by 8000 on Opening Day.
The Architectural and Building Ex-
hibition that was assembled in
the lower Town Hall in connection
with the Fourth Australian Architect-
ural Convention was probably the most
comprehensive and interesting that has
been brought together in Sydney for
many a long year, and the Committee
of Architects who have designed and
erected it are to be congratulated
upon a splendid effort.
Probably for the first time the low-
er Town Hall had been provided with
a “floating” mezzanine floor and by
means of a series of wide open stair-
cases people can view exhibits, photo-
graphs, etc., arranged around the walls
and in the centre of the Hall at a
higher level.
The display, colour, lighting, was ex-
cellent and as a result of the architect-
ural discipline that is obvious there
are no jarring notes in the various dis-
plays, so that the Exhibition is seen
on a harmonious whole instead of, as
is so often the case, a series of indi-
vidual displays, which quite often
clash and detract from each other.
Among the many outstanding fea-
tures are 10 mammoth photo murals
depicting a new vision” in decora-
tive works, and some 1500 square feet
of exhibition screens illustrate the
work of leading N.S.W. architects.
The Exhibition was opened by the
Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman P.
D. Hills, on May 11th, in the
presence of a distinguished gathering
of citizens, architects, engineers and
building contractors.
The Chairman of the Architectural
Convention, Professor H. Ingham Ash-
worth, in welcoming the Lord Mayor,
said he desired to convey the thanks
of the Organising Committee to the
Sydney City Council for its help and
co-operation, and to all who had so
ably supported the promotion and
staging of the Exhibition.
He had a special word of praise and
thanks f or the manufacturers and sup-
pliers of building materials for the
way in which they had responded to
the invitation to participate.
Record Established.
Professor Ashworth said that all
work involved in staging the Exhibi-
tion had been done in record time.
Work was started on Thursday, May
6, and was completed by opening time
last Monday. (Applause.)
“It was a great organising effort,
and reflects great credit on the archi-
tectural and building profession as a
whole,” he declared.
Professor Ashworth paid a tribute
to members of the Exhibition Commit'
tee who had devoted many hours of
work and planning to achieve a sue'
cessful Exhibition.
Purpose of Exhibition.
Outlining the purpose of the Exhi-
bition, the Professor said that the ar'
chitects, through its many mediums,
were trying to reach the public, and
to show them the great variety of ma-
terials which are available, and the
manner in which they can become an
integral part of homes and buildings.
He warmly thanked the building
materials manufacturers for their inter-
esting, education displays, and con-
eluded his remarks by commenting
that the Organising Committee owed
all the exhibitors a great debt of grat'
itude. (Applause.)
Most Original Exhibition.
The Lord Mayor said he was much
impressed by the great transformation
which had taken place in the Lower
Town Hall.
The Architectural Exhibition, he
considered, was one of the most orig-
inal and unusual yet organised in Syd-
ney, and the whole concept reflected
the greatest credit on all concerned.
(Applause.)
Regarding housing needs, the Lord
Mayor said that many thousands were
required annually throughout Aus-
tralia, and the architectural profession
was well to the forefront in the design
and development of the modern home,
in an endeavour to fill the demand.
In fact, he commented, the ad'
vances of home architecture had alter-
ed the whole aspect of house design
as it was once known.
The Lord Mayor complimented the
exhibitors on their very extensive
range of building materials. With-
out these essential materials, the
homes of today could not be brought
into existence.
Keep Costs Down.
Referring to building costs, the Lord
Mayor said they had risen considerably
in recent years, and architects must
ensure that these costs are kept to the
lowest level, and not be allowed to
climb further.
Commenting on the many fine mod-
els in the exhibition, the Lord Mayor
pointed out their advantages from the
aspects of modern town-planning,
housing developments, community
centres and parking station projects.
“From models one can get a great'
er appreciation of how to design and
use buildings to the best advantage.
“The Sydney City Council web
comes men who develop new tech'
niques, even if we have to approach
the State Government to amend the
Building Regulations to permit of their
use.” (Applause.)
Civic Reception.
Later, the Lord Mayor gave a re-
ception to overseas guests and Royal
Australian Institute of Architects’
Councillors attending the Convention.
Many Stands.
Manufacturers of building materials
have given the Exhibition very full
support, and it is inspiring for the
public to see, at first hand, the great
variety of quality products made in
Australia for the building industry.
It is quite impossible to do this Ex'
hibition justice in a short visit but
it is gratifying to know that it will
be on display all next week and both
members of the building industry and
the general public should visit it for
they will find much to interest them.

PROFESSOR GROPIUS HONOURED
HONORARY DEGREE CONFERRED.
At a colourful ceremony in the
Great Hall of the University of Syd'
Great Hall of the University of Sydney
on Wednesday, May 12th, the Hon'
conferred upon Professor Walter
Gropius, eminent leader of architec'
tural thought, who was visiting Sydney
as a guest of the Architectural pro'
fession at the Fourth Australian Archi'
tectural Convention. (There is no
Doctor of Architecture at Sydney
University).
The members of the University
Senate and of the Faculty of Architec'
ture in dignified procession entered
the Great Hall, which was filled to
overflowing by more than 900 people,
and took their seats upon the dais.
Professor H. Ingham Ashworth,
Dean of the Faculty of Architecture,
presented Professor Gropius to the
Chancellor, Sir Charles Bickerton
Blackburn.
The Vice'Chancellor. Professor S.
H. Roberts, read details of his dis'
tinguished career and of his place as
one of the outstanding leaders of archi'
tectural thought in the world to'day.
The Chancellor then formally pre'
sented the degree to Dr. Gropius, who
stood quietly_ and with great dignity
while the eulogistic citation was being
read. Clad in the scarlet robes and
flat hat of the degree he thanked the
Chancellor with a few simple, sincere
words, for the great honour that had
been conferred upon him.
Mr. W. R. Laurie, Senior Graduate
of the Faculty of Architecture, Mr.
Cobden Parkes, Government Architect
of N.S.W., and Mr. A .G. Stephenson,
eminent Australian Architect, paid
tribute to the work and influence of
Professor Gropius.
Members of the Senate then with'
drew from the dais, and Professor
Gropius gave his paper, entitled: “Is
There A Science of Design?”
QUEENSLAND STUDENTS
COME TO SYDNEY.
A number of Queensland architect'
ural students clubbed together,
bought an old car and motored down
from Brisbane in order that they
should not miss the opportunity to
hear Professor Gropius lecture.
Needless to say ,they had a
great time at the Conference. It is
nice to see such keenness.
Colour and Design
Professor Gropius at Sydney
University.
Speaking at the Great Hall at the
University of Sydney on May 12 on
the subject of “Is There a Science of
Design,” Professor Walter Gropius
made reference to the strong influence
of colour on the human being.
He said an American “colour
engineer” had from experiment made
.the following findings:-—-
Violet induces melancholy.
Yellow is an energising colour, con'
ducive to conviviality, increased brain
activity, and a sense of well'being. A
classroom painted yellow is good for
retarded children, while nurseries
painted yellow are 'likely to send
babies to sleep.
Blue induces not “the blues,” but
relaxation. Old people often become
“blue thirsty.”
Red stimulates the brain, pulse, and
appetite. If you stand 20 feet away
from a red chair and a blue chair,
the red chair will appear to be a foot
closer.
Green makes people feel cold.
Stenographers working in green
offices are prey to pyshosonatic
chills, which they readily shed, along
with their sweaters, when, without a

change of temperature, orange slip-
covers are placed on their chairs, or
orange curtains are hung in their win-
dows.
Yellow Lightens the Load.
Professor Gropius said that the same
engineer had stated that a 201 b box
painted dark blue would look heavier,
and seem harder to carry than a
similar box painted light yellow.
He had claimed that a telephone
bell ringing in a white booth seemed
louder than one ringing in a purple
booth, and a peach eaten in the dark
appeared to have less flavour than it
did if its colour could be seen.
Amidst laughter he said in finality
on this theme that it had been found
that a charity appeal mailed in a light
blue-green envelope induced a surer
response than one sent in a white
envelope.
The Modern School
Collaboration Between Teachers
and Designers.
Professor Robert Matthew, Profes-
sor of Architecture at the University
of Edinburgh, who visited Australia
for the Fourth Architectural Conven-
tion, lectured on the subject of Schools
on May 14th.
As Chief Architect of the London
County Council for a number of years,
he was particularly well-qualified to
speak on this subject, for this body,
since the war, has been responsible
for the planning, designing and con-
struction of hundreds of schools of all
types. The Professor said that there
were 750 schools in the area covered
by the L.C.C.; some 500 of these had
been damaged during the war and 150
completely destroyed.
Logical Approach.
With this huge programme before
them, the Council approached the sub-
ject in a very logical manner, and
arranged for careful investigation to
take place between the teaching staff
on the one hand and the architects
and planners on the other, and as a
result of this practical approach the
old type of formal design, in which
the external appearance received the
most consideration, gave way to the
informal in which the plan was
evolved by careful analysis of all the
basic functions that the school had
to perform.
Costa Reduced.
The other major problem was the
necessity to reduce costs to a mini-
mum, and in this process the “scale”
of schools was reduced appreciably
and unnecessary height and grandiose
facades eliminated, which, after all,
was a logical proposal, having regard
to the fact that they were designed to
serve the needs of children and
adolescents.
With a “continuing programme”
of school building, cost analysis be-
came an integral part of planning,
and it was found that by early col-
laboration between occupier and de-
signer costs per pupil were reduced to
<£l4o for primary and £240 for secon-
dary schools. In this connection a
module basis for planning was de'
veloped, this being 3ft. 4in, horizon'
tally and 2ft. Oin. vertically,
The Professor expressed the view
that the collaboration between de'
signers, builders and users of the
schools had Droved most valuable and
had become a two'way process. Archi'
tects, he said, could not as in the past
go on in splendid isolation from
clients and builders, for if living archi'
tecture is to be produced it must
adequately meet the needs of those
who are to use it.
WHAT MAKES A CITY GREAT?
PROFESSOR DENIS WINSTON’S VIEWS.
Professor Denis Winston, Professor
of Town and Country Planning at the
University of Sydney, addressing the
Fourth Australian Architectural Con-
vention on Frjday, May 11, attacked
the machine which he said is domin-
ating our way of life more and more,
and ruining our cities.
What a City Should Be
In answer to his own question he
enumerated the qualities that go to-
wards making a city great.
“The meaning and purpose of a
city,” he said, “is that it shall provide
an environment in which the best
spirits may achieve of their best. It
is a meeting place, a laboratory, a
studio, a workshop for various creative
activities. A great city is great be-
cause of its citizens.
“We need to walk at our ease in
safety to see and be seen and exchange
the news. The air we breathe should
be fresh, not heavy with coal dust or
stale with oil fumes, and being animals
it comforts us, even in the city, to be
in touch with our mother nature —to
see a tree or a piece of grass, or the
blue waters of the bay.
Then, at night, to sleep in peace
and quiet—the hardest thing of all in
the cities of today.”
Cities Drab and 1 Mediocre.
Professor Winston said cities of to-
day, particularly in Australia, and Syd-
ney in particular, were being developed
towards size and numbers.
In consequence, they had sameness,
drabness and mediocrity and the
human being became a mere unit in
the overgrown cities.
“With the growth, the edges of the
city push further into the country
until a whole vast area has lost all
contact with the soil, natural bush,
rocks, trees and grass,” he said.
The city of man is becoming the
city of machines. It is understandable
therefore, that with these processes
people are fleeing from the city to the
suburbs as rapidly as they can go.
“One’s social status is, in fact, signi-
fied by the distance one lives from the
Town Hall and the time one is able
to squander in useless journeying.
“Historic homes fall into decay,
quiet squares become traffic centres,
monuments are festooned with over*
head tram wires and city parks become
convenient sites for public lavatories.
“In the last stages of this develop-
ment, the city not only lacks all or-
dinary human comfort, but ceases to
have any real significance at all.”
Stop Overgrown Cities.
Professor Winston said the remedies
were:—
1. Stop the growth of the cities
Introduce the green-belt.

2. Direct the growth to develop-
ment beyond the green-belt into
satellite communities.
3. Cut down traffic at its source so
that instead of having roads radiating
into a city provide ring traffic routes
around a city. Cut down the amount
of travel needed by relating work
places to living places, docks to storage
places, and railway transhipment places
to storage places.
4. Bring wedges of the green-belt
into the city and locate highways in
them.
5. Break up the existing massive
urban built-up area into a series of
neighbourhoods or communities, de-
fined as clearly as possible.
6. While never under-estimating the
importance of such essential projects as
housing, hospitals and schools', re-
member they are only the means to an
end, that community places such as
theatres, concert halls, assembly rooms
and art galleries are the focal points of
civilisation itself.
7. Every architect should relate each
building he designs to the neighbour-
hood and the city in which he builds.
Live in the City.
But if one single thing only could
be done and I had to choose, I would
say, make the inner areas habitable
again.” he said.
“Reverse the fashionable flight
from the cities to the suburbs—the
escapism which has always marked the
decline of civilization,
“When aldermen, members of Par-
liament, captains of industry, and lead-
ing men of the professions, live once
again within three miles of the Town
Hall, the city will quickly become
cleaner and quieter and pleasanter than
it is to-day.
Recent Developments in Building in Great Britain
WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO MATERIAL AND CONSTRUCTION.
By ROBERT H. MATTHEW, C.B.E., A.R.I.B.A.,
Professor of Architecture, University of Edinburgh.
Delivered before the Fourth Australian Architectural Convention, at the Australia Hotel, Sydney, May 11th, 1954.
A few years ago, Sir Winston
Churchill, on a famous occasion, re*
dedicating the restored House of
Commons in London, said—“We first
shape our buildings, and then they
shape us.” This seemed to put in a
nutshell the relation between Archi*
tecture and Society. It is a relation*
ship that exists, whether we like it or
not—indeed, from this point of view,
it is quite immaterial whether we, as
architects, have had a hand in the
business at all. For building goes on,
century after century, as required, and
architects, at any rate in the sense
that we understand the word to-day,
have only very recently come into the
picture.
Travelling in England whether
through the agricultural lands, along
the coasts, or across the industrial Mid-
lands, we are really travelling, in a
large measure, and speaking Archi-
tecturally, through the 19th Century.
By far the majority of buildings you
will see, were built during that cen-
tury, and this represented a period of
building activity unparalleled in his-
tory. But the contribution of the
architect to this vast aggregation of
building, was comparatively small —
even marginal. This is not to say
there were no outstanding architects
of the day—of course there were, and
we know their buildings well. But,
amid the acres, or rather the square
miles of towns and villages, it is easy
to lose sight altogether of those build-
ings that, in their time, were consider-
ed notable. The seal and character
of the period was set, not by archi-
tects, but by the far greater number
of anonymous builders, who, without
philosophy, mostly without scholar*
ship, but usually with common sense,
somehow or other saw that the law of
supply and demand was timeously
fulfilled.
Looking back over the history of
Architecture since, say, the 16th cen*
tury, it is easy to see that the idea of
the Architect, as a gay decorator, pro*
viding the frills and light relief to the
normally heavy * handed day*to*day
drudge of commonplace building, it is
easy to see how this idea died hard.
So hard, in fact, that the Architect
failed, to any significant extent, to
gear into the real needs of 19th cen*
tury England and this is true, I be*
lieve, in most countries subject to the
unrepressed blast of industrial expan*
sion.
This lack of adjustment between the
Architect and Society has long been
recognised—it is perhaps one reason
why so many of the architectural nota-
bilities of a couple .of generations ago
were popularly, and probably correct*
ly, reported to be highly irritable —if
not splenetic—by nature! To*day, we
are only too anxious to dissociate our*
selves from the ‘dark Satanic mills’
and we are pleased to think that, if
only the architectural profession had
been prepared, in time, for its task,
William Morris and others who
thought like him, might not have felt
impelled to cast back to the Middle
Ages for their vision of England,
Home and Beauty!
It was, in fact, the thinking and
writing of men like Morris or
Ebenezer Howard or Patrick Geddes
-—the centenary of whose birth we
celebrate later this year—that touched
the collective architectural conscience
at the beginning of this century; since
then, the Architect has moved slowly,
but, I think, fairly steadily, away from
the outermost rim of social activity,
towards its centre. The last decade,
in England, has seen a perceptible ac-
Ration of this movement; it is
already beginmg to be reflected, most
obviously, in the buildings noticed by
everyone and used by so many—
namely, houses and schools. These,
however, are only symptoms—impor-
tant as they may be—of a movement
\2 that I believe is now deep-rooted,
and “ a 5 man V aspects, some of which
may °e interest outside England.
I should, prehaps, say at this point,
that I am not going to attempt to

tion of thc Architect in relation to

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


divide my comments into two groups:
first, in relation to changes in tech-
nology, and second, in relation to the
changing Building Demand.
Both of these can, of course, be re-
garded as by-products of social change,
and both react on each other in many
ways, but, for the moment, we can
look at them separately.
Changes in Technology.
First, then, in the field of tech-
nology. During the war years, when
normal building activity had almost
come to a standstill, a very great num-
ber of buildings for special wartime
purposes had to be built quickly, un-
der anything but normal conditions,
and to specifications that in many re-
spects were exaggerated forms of nor-
mal peace-time performance standards.
Out of these intense conditions
came much experience that proved to
be of permanent value, and some de-
velopments of considerable interest.
The necessity to span great spaces
with a minimum of vertical supports,
especially in aircraft factories, pro-
duced an intensive re-examination of
the theories of structures, leading
directly to a flexibility in roof design
greater than we have known for a
very long time.
The Space Frame.
The whole conception of the space-
frame, in its many forms—simple as
it now appears—crystallized during
the war, and since then, the tryranny
of the flat roof—for so long the sym-
bol of the Architecture of the 20’s
and 30 s —has been to some extent
modified.
The Exhibition on the South Bank
of the Thames, in 1951—again a sym-
bol of the times—illustrated strikingly
this freedom in roof design. The flat
roof, where it occurred (it was not
used to a very great extent) took its
place as one solution only among
many others—some of which were of
outstanding interest.
The flat roof, like the rolled steel
joist made an invaluable contribution
to the development of architecture, at
a critical point in its evolution, free-
ing the plans, as the beams and stan-
chions of framed construction did at
an earlier period. In this sense, the
flat roof was a negative aid to design,
and the aesthetic of the roof, histori-
cally, almost literally, the crowning
beauty of architecture, disappeared,
but only for a short time.
It is somewhat ironical to trace the
re-emergence of the roof as a positive
element in design to the exigencies of
war, but I think that few would deny
the link between the wartime accelera-
tion in the development of the theory
of structures and its subsequent appli-
cation, with considerable aesthetic
effect, in the buildings of to-day.
A similar analogy may be made in
frame construction as a whole. Here
again, the early production of the
R.S.J., so easy to look up in the
books, so conveniently to hand in
manufacture, for long effectively in'
hibited the free design of structures:
again, from the necessity to build on
a large scale with the minimum of
materials, alternative forms of framing
quickly appeared during the war, and
from this flowed the whole post-war
development of light framing, so dif-
ferent from the steel structure of pre-
war days, that for fifty years or so had
remained a static element in building
technique.
The Tower and Production’ build-
ing on the South Bank was a revela-
tion of new thought in the intelligent
design of structure, and, in many
buildings in England to-day, the
effects of this further freedom from
structural, rather than architectural,
cliche are readily apparent.
The space frame, or the ‘skin-frame’
as Grenfell Baines has called it, the
use of prismatic roof profiles of many
kinds, the development of the theory
of stressed skins; all these, associated
with the use of light alloys and plas-
tics, especially for gluing, can be
traced to intensive wartime research,
not only in the field of building, but
in aircraft and ship design.
Here is a whole new area of tech-
nique at the service of the architect,
but it is one that he can not easily
manipulate by himself hence the
endless discussions now taking place
on the old question of the relation
between the Architect and the Struc-
tural Engineer.
Structural Freedom.
To some, this access of structural
freedom suggests that the thread of
organic building, lost at the end of
the Middle Ages, is about to be pick-
ed up. To others, to .whom the
aesthetics of the cube and the rect-
angle are important, it is something
of an embarrassment.
I have used the strong word
Tyranny’ but the line between
tyranny and discipline is indeed a fine
one, and there is a danger that, for
a time, we may see an anarchy of
form beside which the variety of
Victorian structural shape may appear
tame and unambitious!
Alvar Aaltos’ winning design,
made last year, for a great sports’
centre in Vienna, whose elaborate
tent-like form is almost impossible to
define, by drawings, either in plan
or in section, is a vivid pointer in this
direction!
The possibility of an outburst of
unrepressed 20th century ‘picturesque’
in England, is possible, first because
the austerity lid has been so firmly
screwed down for so long, and second.
because it is becoming apparent that,
with the increasing use of the scien-
tific design of structure, simple, rect-
angular shapes are not necessarily the
most economical —a disconcerting fact
that I suppose D arcy Thomson would
have told us that the world of Nature
had discovered a very long time ago!
Pre-fabrication.
I have given the development of
structural theory as one example of
the effect of the war on building. An
even more striking example is in the
field of pre-fabrication and the indus-
trial production of building com'
ponents. Here the interest lies, not
so much in what was done, but rather
in what was not done. We can see in
building, to-day. the effects of the lack
of positive direction in the critical
period near the end of the war. It
is difficult, even at this short distance,
to recapture the atmosphere of the
time, but this minute from the Prime
Minister to the Secretary of the
Cabinet in September, 1944, probably
gives as good a picture as any.
“To Sir Edward Bridges:
2nd September, 1944.
I am concerned at the position of
our prefabricated houses policy.
Nearly five months have been wast'
ed exhibiting our designs to the fas'
tidious criticism of housing fad'
dists, local authorities. Members of
Parliament, etc., with the result
that there is practically no pro-
gress at all. I take a most serious
view of this, because I have my'
self made public pledges to the
troops. We are being more nice
than wise. What does it matter
whether the house is the best that
can be built or not? The great
thing is to have some kind of a
house for a soldier returning who
wishes to marry. If we are not
careful we shall be so busy over
design that we shall finish up with
Nissen huts.”
It is easy to be gifted with hind'
s * £ ht, and I am not concerned to
criticize. Indeed, looking back to
these years, I am constantly astonished
at the optimism and quality of post'
war planning that took place even
when the war seemed to be running
against us.
But, if ever there was a time when
the Central Government could have
influenced, to an enormous degree,
the whole future development of
building, it was round about 1943 and
1944.
Control of production was com'
plete, both in relation to materials and
in the use of manpower. The tide
of war had turned, and planning for
the post'war years was being seriously
undertaken. The certainly of great
building shortage immediately the war
was over was evident to everyone, and
27

no one was under the illusion that
pre-war methods could be adequate to
meet the programme of reconstruction.
Golden Opportunity Test.
Here was the golden opportunity to
set ''norms’ in building—the dream of
so many of us for so long; for the
design, for machine production, of a
range of essential building com-
ponents, interchangeable for all types
of buildings, throughout the country.
With unique facilities for the mobi-
lisation of research and full-scale ex-
priment; with productive capacity at
its highest, and with an effective de-
mand for building whose total volume
would be controlled and therefore as-
sured —with all this, the stage seemed
set for the establishment of a central
research and development organisa-
tion, powerful enough to control in-
dustrial output for building.
As we know, this did not happen;
production became frittered away on
a score or two prefabricated house
types reminiscent of World War I,
each designed independently as com-
plete dwellings, with no common, in*
terchangeable elements, and these
were built in very great numbers. The
assured market, under these circum-
stances, did not act as a stimulus to
the progressive development of the
pre-fabs, and as the first desperate
housing shortage became less acute,
they tended to be able to compete less
and less favourably with the tradi-
tional building industry, once it got
on its feet.
In fact, the pre-fabs filled a gap,
which otherwise would not have been
filled—but at a cost. The economic
advantage of a large-scale link-up with
industry, on the basis of a centrally
planned series of small components,
which would have imposed no more
aesthetic restrictions on the architect
than the production of a standard
brick—all this was thrown away.
Factory Production of Units.
At the same time, the industrial
producer had at last got his foot firmly
in the door of the building industry.
Since then, virtually a new industry
has been set up—for the factory pro-
duction of complete units, whether for
industrial or other use, both for home
consumption and for export. This
new factor may well alter profoundly
the whole character of building in
future. At present this industrial pro-
duction is largelv outside the control
of architects, with a few exceptions.
More importantly, it is remote from
the potential occupiers at the design
stage. Here is one of the real prob-
lems of the present: as in the 19th
century, the vast bulk of building
took place independently both of the
architect and the people, so it may be
again in the 20th century; industrial
production may fill a need that is not
met in any other way.
My own view is that, in England,
this will probably not happen, as there
is another powerful factor to reckon
with, operating in quite an opposite
direction, but I would like to return
to this in the second half of my paper,
and leave, for a moment, industrial
production, with its vast potential, at
this point.
Building Research.
My last comment in the context of
technology is about Building Research.
Whatever opportunities may have
been missed in other directions, there
is no question that in this matter very
strong foundations were laid during
the war, and the considerable organisa-
tional effort made at that time, because
of wartime necessity— to develop the
many branches of study associated
with building-—-is now showing hand-
some dividends, as, I think, would
now be acknowledged by research
stations all over the world. I think
it is true to say that, for the first time,
the resources of science, became, in a
conscious way, linked to the problems
of building.
During the war, the Building Re-
search Station, one of the organisa-
tions of the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research, became the
meeting ground between a group of
scientists drawn from many branches
of science, and architects. The focus
of many skills, including that of the
architect, on the building project, in-
evitably threw up vast gaps in know-
ledge, some of which clearly required
long-term and fundamental research.
A central council for Building Re-
search was therefore set up in 1947 to
renew, comprehensively, the whole
field of research. This is a permanent
council, representing most aspects of
the building industry, research institu-
tions, universities and professional
bodies. For the first time, a picture
was obtained of all research work in
progress connected with building, and
this is kept up to date, year by year.
From this survey, gaps in research are
known, and an annual programme is
drawn up on the basis of this know-
ledge.
In the space of a very few years,
authoritative studies have been made
of subjects as varied as Heating, Ven-
tilating, Lighting, Sound insulation
and acoustics. Fire grading of build-
ings, Plumbing, Painting and Plastics,
to name only a very few from a long
list. These studies are the work of
groups selected from their knowledge
in the field of study under review.
Weathering and Maintenance.
All this, however, is only at its be-
ginning: Although Building is as old
as civilization, we have still some way
to go, in comparison, for instance.
with pure science itself, or with medi-
cine, in the simple task of the or-
ganisation of existing knowledge. On
the clinical side of building, if I can
use that term, that is, the observation
of building in use, it is only since the
Building Research Station came into
existence that any organised study has
been made, with the publication of
results of the problems of weathering
and of maintenance.
For centuries, the churches, the uni-
versities. Federations of merchants and
manufacturers, the great landowners,
have owned and maintained property,
but their knowledge, which must be
vast, if recorded at all, has not in any
way been made generally available.
For some considerable time we have
had Building Regulation Authorities,
responsible for the public safety in
relation to buildings. The corps of
Building Inspectors used by these
Authorities, must, taken as a whole,
contain a considerable amount of
knowledge about the behaviour of
buildings and building materials, par-
ticularly about their failure. This
fund of knowledge might well be
made available, if not directly to the
public, at least to the Research in-
stitutions.
In this way. Building Regulation
could become a positive aid to good
building practice, rather than being,
as it so often is, a mere negative safe'
guard against disaster.
I am well aware, as I had to ad-
minister the London Building Act for
some years, that the subject of build-
ing by-laws is not very congenial to
most architects, and it is true that in
many respects they tend to become
more and more restrictive as building
technique changes.
Fire Risks.
In one particular respect, however,
I have been many times surprised at
the apparent indifference of some
architects to what may happen to their
buildings once they are built: I refer
to the possible effects of fire. How
often has the bland assumption been
made that, because a building is con-
structed of steel, cement and glass,
there can be no substantial fire risk!
I had the unhappy experience of
being supplied, by the chief officer of
the London Fire Brigade, over the
years, with fully detailed records of
major fires in buildings occurring all
over the world.
There may frequently be little cause
for much expenditure designed to
safeguard a building for its own sake,
never for its contents, but we some-
times forget that often the unfortunate
firemen hae no choice but to enter
burning buildings knowing that at any
moment the structure may collapse on
top of them.
In cities, burning buildings cannot
28

be allowed to burn themselves
out, and if architects could stand for a
few minutes in the place of a fireman
in action, they might not be so im-
patient of stringent fire regulations.
The fire at General Motors, recently,
when I think four firemen were killed
in a modern single-storey factory, is
some indication of the risk these men
are sometimes obliged to run.
Building Regulations.
Apart from this, it has been con-
ceded generally that a new outlook
on Building Regulation has been long
overdue, and, at the risk of being un-
popular, I would like to quote one or
two sentences from the new model,
issued a few months ago by the
Government in Scotland. This is
what it says:—
“The model building by-laws have
become out of date as a result of ad-
vances in building methods and tech-
nical knowledge.
“The main objectives of the new
model are to allow greater freedom in
the use of new materials and methods:
to secure economy and the best pos-
sible use of materials, but at the same
time to set safe and certain standards.
To achieve this, it has been necessary
to draft model by-laws very different
in form from the previous ones.
Each group of by-laws now relates
to a particular function to be per-
formed by a building—e.g., its capa-
bility of withstanding specified loads.
The requirements for a particular
function generally take the form of
performance standards which specify
to what degree the building, or part
of the building must be capable of
performing that function: they do not
make it obligatory to adopt any speci-
fied form of construction.
“There is freedom to use any mate-
rial in any form of construction that
will achieve the required standards;
and designers will, when the occasion
demands, be enabled to design for a
particular purpose, with resulting
economy and efficiency.”
This seems to me to be a sane, an
almost scientific attitude to building
that I hope will be noted everywhere.
If this attitude were universally adopt-
ed, Graham Wallas’ famous phrase
about Government might hold equal-
ly well in the field of building Con-
trol, for then it might, as he says,
“come to be engaged, not merely in
preventing the wrong things from
being done, but in bringing it about,
that the right things shall be done!”
I am only too well aware that my
comments in the field of technology
have been highly selective, and per-
haps they may appear to be incon-
sequential. Much has happened of
great interest in building practice: the
development of mechanical plant (Sir
Ben Lockspeiser has estimated that
even now in Great Britain the build-
ing industry has only half horsepower
behind the operative compared to
two and a half for manufacturing in-
dustry), the development of the tech-
nique of reinforced, and particularly
of pre-stressed concrete; the re - emer-
gence of timber as a building material
capable of scientific design; the the
use of chemical analysis in the design
of materials for specified performance
standards —all these, and many more,
are aspects of a changing world of
building that is more than an accele-
ration of pre-war methods and modes
of thought.
What seems to have happened is
that the first steps (and they are in
reality little more than this) have now
been taken to link the resources of
Government and Science to Building.
Science and Building.
Sir Edward Appleton, who was, a
few years ago, secretary of the De-
partment of Scientific and Industrial
Research, and is now, I am glad to
say. Principal of the University in
Edinburgh, inaugurated, in 1946, a
series of annual lectures at M.I.T.
In that inaugural lecture he said
this:
“I believe that the proper directions
of scientific effort and the proper ap-
plication of the results of such effort
is one of the most important chal-
lenges of our time.”
I believe this is as true in relation
to building as in any other field of
effort—particularly, perhaps, in build-
ing, where for so long we have been
content to look more to the past than
to the possibilities of the present, let
alone those of the future.
Some architects have been afraid of
science, as though in some way it
might destroy their Art; perhaps a
natural reaction, in face of change to
those who find readjustment difficult.
But the “proper application of the re-
sults of scientific effort,” in Appleton’s
words, surely implies that science may
be the servant of Architecture, and in
that case the Architect has, surely,
nothing to fear, but everything to
gain.
BUILDING DEMAND.
In this second section, under the
slightly prosaic title of ‘Building De-
mand, I would like to examine, for
a few moments, the emergence, on a
large scale, since the war, of the
Public Authority, as the contemporary
patron of Architecture in Great
Britain.
You will, of course, hear various
views about this period of develop-
ment. There has been little building
of the pre-war ‘monumental’ class, and
priorities are still operating heavily in
favour of certain classes of buildings.
It is only within the last year or so
that commercial buildings have again
begun to appear, and this only to a
very limited extent. Large areas of
ground, flattened during the war, still
lie empty in most of the more heavily
damaged cities.
To some, therefore, it has been a
period of heart-breaking, frustrating
control and irksome regulations, with
a lack of materials equalled only by
lack of opportunity to build solidly,
and, as it used to be called optimis-
tically, for "posterity’.
To others, it has been quite the
reverse, and it is not difficult to see
why.
With the war still in progress, the
Government and it represented all
parties took decisions that set the
framework for building for at least
the next decade. . That framework is
still is existence.
It was seen, only too clearly, that
with the sell-out of foreign investment,
the concentration of home production
into a very few channels, the physical
destruction of buildings on a large
scale and the run-down of the build-
ing industry—it was seen that post-
war readjustment on the basis of maxi-
mum production for export could only
be met by a planned economy which
would involve minimum social wel-
fare to offset extreme austerity in all
other directions. And so, these were
the days of the Beveridge Report: the
foundations of the National Health
Service, post-war Education and hous-
ing policy; the beginning of the de-
centralization of industry and popula-
tion, and the planned expansion of
the production of electrical power.
A break-down of the total national
resources determined how much could
be allocated to the building industry
as a whole: given so much labour and
so much productive energy for mate-
rials, the total volume of building pos-
sible became more or less fixed, with-
in limits of deviation set by variation
in building productivity. This total
volume was again broken down and
divided among many priority holders
industry and power; housing;
health; education. Absolute priority
varied from time to time, but annual
targets were set for each category,
and virtually no building took place
outside these groups.
It was then left to each Department
of Government concerned to solve an
unholy equation of space standards,
numbers of buildings and available re-
sources, and for the first time, I be-
lieve, in our history, it was largely
upon the architect that responsibility
for co-ordination fell on a national
scale.

industry! lay with public authorities
of one kind or another —the long-
established local authorities the
towns and urban and rural districts
and counties for housing and schools;
new authorities for hospitals, fuel and
power, transport and new towns. All
of these, within a very few years, had
to organise their building programmes,
and most, if they had not already
done so, set up their own Architec-
tural Departments. Before the war,
public architectural offices had not, in
general, attained a very high standard
of work; most brilliant students auto-
matically decided on a career of pri-
vate practice; the schools were or-
ganised on that basis, and the public
offices had to put up with the second
best, or frequently much worse than
that! The exception was the Miners’
Welfare Institution, under J. H.
Forshaw, who was later to be my im-
mediate predecessor at the London
County Council. Before the war, the
Miners’ Welfare office had produced
some notable pioneering buildings, but
in these days they were ploughing a
very lonely furrow and competing
with the overwhelming talent and op-
portunity in private practice.
Now, however, with the start of
post-war building, this situation be-
came entirely changed. The initiative
lay clearly with the public office. The
young men, many out of the Forces,
and finishing at the schools, flocked
into the expanding offices. Very
talented men, mostly young, found
themselves in positions of great re-
sponsibility; very quickly, they found
they could pick some of the best de-
signing talent in the country, and
many first-class teams began to find
their feet.
It was about this time, that is, about
six or seven years ago, that the archi-
tectural profession came nearest to
grips with the real social impulse of
the country, and this is what I mean
when I say that the architect has re-
cently tended to move from his tradi-
tional position on the fringe of society,
almost to its centre. Never before, in
fact, had so much building been un-
der the control of the architect —great
blocks of building—for Industry; for
the production of Power; for coal-
mining; for transport, not to mention
housing, health buildings and the new
towns, were almost universally recog-
nised as the proper sphere of the
Architect, a state of affairs that would
have surprised our architectural fore-
bears of only a generation or two ago.
It has recently been estimated that 85-
90% of all new building is now car-
ried out by architects, and this com-
pares with estimates of 30-40% and
even less before the war.
Private building was virtually non-
existent: the ‘spec’ builder was com-
pletely dormant, or for the time being
had turned to respectable straight-
forward contracting.
Here, then, in certain directions,
was opportunity, and on a grand,
almost a heroic scale. On the whole,
I believe it was well taken.
Continuing Building
Programme.
I have said in certain directions
advisedly, because I wish to speak par-
ticularly about the public office, in
which my own experience has largely
been. It would be absurd to suggest
this this is the only form of archi-
tectural opportunity, or that the public
office is the answer to the whole of
architectural practice. Even in the
very kind of social buildings of which
I am speaking, the private office has
made notable contributions some-
times in association with the public
office itself, for iriany types of col-
laboration have been in operation for
some years. It is unusual, in fact, in
England, for the public office to carry
out the whole of its work. In the
London County Council, of which I
can speak particularly, about half of
the annual building work, amounting
to some millions of pounds, regularly
went to private offices, and this
proved, from more than one point of
view, to be an excellent practice. The
type of building work that I am con-
cerned with in this paper is more
strictly confined to building amenable
to continuous programming, and that,
of course,, represents a substantial part
of all work for which the public
authorities are ultimately responsible.
Many special buildings of a non-
recurring kind, are obviously as well,
if not better, done in the private
office, and, in fact, at home they are
usually carried out in this way.
It has sometimes been said that the
rapid development of the public office
threatened the existence of the private
practitioner. The R.1.8.A. two or
three years ago went to some trouble
to discover whether this fear was jus-
tified, and after careful inquiry came
to the conclusion that it was not.
My own impression is that, with the
recognition that is now almost univer-
sal by the public building owners that
all buildings for which they are re-
sponsible should be designed by archi-
tects, the private practitioner is cer-
tainly losing nothing, but possibly
gaining a good deal!
The public architectural office is
now well founded, and many of these
are producing work of first-class
quality.
Architect Production
Manager.
Like most British institutions, crea-
tions of instinct rather than of reason,
they have grown to function in a
way that was hardly foreseen by many
architects. For the Architect to-day
is not only responsible for design, but
also for production. The programmes
of building for which the public
authorities are sponsors, are, of neces-
sity, for they are part and parcel of
the national economy, geared to an
exacting time-table, and the architect
now finds himself in the curious posi-
tion not only of artist-designer, but
also of production-manager, and his
terms of reference have clearly been
widened to include the attainment of
both quality and quantity, within
given limits of time and cost, and
this is already seen to be a fairly stiff
assignment. On the one hand, there
is the pressing social necessity for an
increasing number of buildings; on
the other, for quicker building
methods and reduced costs —two sets
of demands difficult to bring together.
At the same time, the very existence
of an assured programme, on a very
large scale, under the control of the
architect, has brought an entirely new
situation into being, a situation out of
which immense possibilities are only
now beginning to emerge and to be
appreciated.
For the first time in our history,
the vast number of buildings required,
and recognised by all to be required,
for social purposes can be thought of
in terms of a continuing programme,
or series of programmes, rather than
as a large number of unconnected,
unique buildings.
This in itself may be a disconcert-
ing thought to the architect, schooled,
as he probably is, as an individualist,
and taught to think of the design of
each building as a complete, isolated,
self-contained unity. Faced, however,
with a continuous programme of
works, whether in the field of hous-
ing, educational buildings or whatever
it may be, two or three things become
immediately obvious. First, with a
programme extending over the years,
the architect is in a position to set up
a study group, independent, if neces-
sary, of the job teams, but working
very closely with them.
Study Groups.
Second, the architect, and in par-
ticular the study group, can get to
close grips with the client.
The particular type of democracy
we have been accustomed to in Britain
has evolved a combination of elected
members and permanent officers,
capable, when at its best, of defining
extremely accurately the conditions
that buildings must satisfy. It is a
combination that is also, sometimes to
the extreme embarrassment of the
architect, capable of assessing equally
accurately the extent to which given
architectural solutions mav fall short
of these conditions.
Thi£ close association of the client
with the designer is to my mind, one
30

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


of the most striking features of the
changing architectural scene. It is a
continuing association, and as the
needs of the client are never static,
this changing demand is quickly and
accurately reflected in building. In a
real sense, the architect can become
identified with the client; if it is a
programme of school building, the
architect can be right in the stream
of educational ideas —and as they
change, and they do all the time —so
do his own ideas. Gone are the days
when the Architect received a bare
schedule of accommodation round
which he was expected to construct,
in isolation, the idea of a living or-
ganization. Under these new circum-
stances, the school and the building,
instead of being two separate entities,
can fuse together to the extent to
which the ideas of the Architect and
the Educator have themselves been
allowed to fuse.
Living Architecture.
The resulting architectural concep-
toin is not, therefore, an abstraction,
but, in a real sense, is living archi-
tecture. We hear a great deal, nowa-
days, about the People’s architecture,
but here, I suggest, is the possibility
of a real kind of architecture, with the
not unimportant advantage that if the
client, that is, the people, do not think
he is doing his job, he, or they, have
ample opportunity of saying so!
So far, the picture I have given you
is now fairly well established practice
in many public offices. Study groups,
combining many skills, architectural,
engineering of various kinds—electri-
cal, heating and ventilating and struc-
tural costing suveyors these are
working in the way I have described,
with teachers, housing managers, doc-
tors and many others who have to
live and work in the buildings that
the Architect ultimately designs. The
opportunity for full-scale experiment
—the building of prototypes — also
becomes possible in this kind of or-
ganisation. Furthermore, the architect
is automatically associated with his
building in the years to come and he
sees, at first hand, the effects of time,
weather and use. Indeed, he cannot
avoid doing so, and the opportunity is
continually before him to correlate
this knowledge in future design.
The maintenance department of the
public office, where it is part of the
architect’s responsibility, as it fre-
quently is, is visibly changing its
character, from the ultimate repository
of the architecture failure, as it so
often used to be, to a Building Re-
search Station in miniature.
Here, then, is a situation in which
the architect can research, experiment
and plan, while at the same time he
is building to a strict time-table, a
double activity difficult to achieve, I
think, in any other kind of architec-
tural organisation. This is straight'
forward, and obvious, and largely ac'
cepted, for in no way does this kind
of group'working affect the normal
traditional methods of contracting.
For some time now, however, there
has been a growing realisation, espe'
dally among the larger offices hand'
ling substantial annual building bud'
gets, that, no matter how well and
intelligently they may research, plan
and design, before the contract is let,
and this rationalisation of design
already affected costs, especially in
school buildings, in a remarkable way
—no mater how well his stage in de-
sign is carried through, a limit is very
quickly reached in the vital matter of
economy, beyond which it is apparent'
ly impossible to go.
This, probably, would not have wor-
ried anyone a generation ago, when
building took its course, and the limits
of efficiency of the traditional build'
ing industry (and the designers) were
accepted, with more or less good
grace, by everyone. The standard
remedy in the more spacious days,
when prices were considered too high,
was the stunning blow of a Geddes
Axe, anaesthetising the building in'
dustry for a short period, until it woke
up again in a more chastened frame of
mind!
This technique is no longer em-
ployed, first because no Government
could possibly survive even the
shortest cessation of building in face
of the welhorganised and highly
articulate demand for essential build'
ings of all kinds, and second, because
of the obvious danger that after
another anaesthetic the building in'
dustry might not wake up again at
all!
But the problem still remains, and
it is a growing problem. The build'
ing industry is not far off its pre-war
level of employment, and productivity
is not far off pre-war levels, too. In
terms of accommodation and bulk of
building we have, at the present time,
just about reached the optimum value
for money within the general existing
framework of building practice.
New Building
and Obsolescence.
This, however, is clearly not
enough. It has now been recognised
that during the last few years new
building, taken as a whole, has not
kept pace with obsolescence. Old
property has been falling out of use
at at increasing rate, due to the almost
complete lack of maintenance during
the war, and very inadequate repair
since. It is the opipion of some, and
this is a very difficult matter to esti-
mate, that, in spite of all our new
building, we are fighting a losing
battle, at the moment, against the
forces of decay and destruction —and
this with a still severly restricted field
of building!
The architect in private practice is
in no position to do anything very
much about this situation. He can
only hope that some time the public
authorities will be able to overtake
their programmes of priority work to
such a degree that he will then be
allowed to go about the business of
providing the multitude of special
buildings required by the community.
But, if what I have said is true, and
I believe it is, about the relation be'
tween obsolescence and new building,
the stage when the public authorities
will, in any real sense, have completed
their task or even have got within a
measurable distance of having done
so, seems very remote.
I imagine that most public authori'
ties see their programmes of building
continuing indefinitely, and this cer'
tainly is the basis upon which any
offices of this kind that I know are
working at the present time.
How is this dilemma to be resolved?
Last year, the Government Select
Committee on Estimates, examining
the national school building pro'
gramme, frankly admitted that the
traditional building industry could not

hope to provide more than about half
of the buildings required, year by year,
and it is becoming increasingly evident
that this is applying to almost all
categories of building; moreover, and
this is partly my justification in speak'
ing about this subject at all in a meet'
ing of this kind, it is a problem that
is rapidly becoming almost universal
in an age when destruction, whether
by human or natural agency con'
tinuously offsets, and more than off'
sets, the creation of new wroks.
There seems to be no ready answer
to this problem, but, in England at
the present time, there is the begin'
ning of an idea as to the direction in
which part, at any rate, of the answer
may lie.
I have often spoken, in relation to
the public office, with its continuing
programme of building—of a new
kind of link between designer and
client. It is now becoming clear that
this factor, the continuing and assured
programme, holds possibilities in at
least two other directions—first, in the
direction of the builder, or the build'
ing constructor; and, second, in the
direction of the supplier of building
materials, whether in the form of raw
materials or of manufactured com'
ponents.
It is, of course, true that the checks
and balances of the public authority,
at any rate in England, designed to
ensure fair dealing all round, and a
careful scrutiny in the expenditure of
public money, have deliberately kept
at arm’s length the main parties to
the building contract until the contract
is let—that is, until the vital design'
ing stage is finished. This caution, in
public administration, was certainly
wise, in the early stages of building
up public confidence in the capability
and integrity of great Authorities to
handle continuous series of very large
contracts; that confidence is in
existence, and has been well justified.
It is, indeed, the only possible basis
for the kind of development that is
now in the air.
L.C.C. Building Experiment.
Two experiments, I would like to
mention, seem to me to be straws in
the wind. The first, started last year
by the London County Council, is
being watched with great interest by
Authorities all over the country.
In July, 1953, the Council said this:
“We believe that there is some scope
for savings in cost, and for quicker
construction without extra cost, if the
planning of the design, erection and
engineering work of a scheme of de'
velopment could be undertaken by the
architect, the structural engineer, the
quantity surveyor and the contractor
working together as a team from the
outset. As an experiment we propose,
for the purpose of developing certain
new techniques, that a consulting em
gineer and a nominated contractor
should be appointed to collaborate
with the Council’s architect and quam
tity surveyor for the first phase of the
development of the Picton Street site,
Camberwell, from the design stage
onwards.”
In fact, two very large experiments
of this kind are now in progress, and
they may well mark, if these are sue'
cessful, a milestone in the history of
building. Here, the client, the de'
signers, the costing surveyor and the
builder are coming together at the
start ~ one wou ld think a simple neces'
sity in rational building, but how seh
dom, in the Modern World, has it
been achieved!
Development of Prototype
Buildings.
The second experiment I would
like to mention is one that has been
continuing for some years.
If Mr. Johnston'Marshall, Chief
Architect to the Ministry of Educa'
tion, had been here, in my place, as
he might well have been, he would,
I am sure, have given you a much
more detailed and exact account of
an imaginative conception of the way
in which a Government Architectural
Department can give, by its own Re-
search and Development work, a direct
and inspiring lead to architects all
over the country. This is no theoreti'
cal study, but a very practical illus'
tration of the effect of linking the
resources of both Government and
Science to the real problems of build'
ing.
Coming from one of the most pro-
gressive county Authorities, namely,
Hertfordshire, who had already made
a considerable contribution to the
rational design of schools. lohnston'
Marshall, by a happy combination of
personalities, was able to create a per'
manent group consisting of Adminis'
trator. Educator, Technician and
Architect.
His idea was teanvworking all the
way through. By collaborating with
five Education authorities, his team
included the potential occupiers of the
experimental school buildings that
emerged during the last three or four
years, as a result of intensive and
many'sided research. But the team
did not stop there. Each school de'
signed became the prototype for a
particular kind of construction,
whether in light steel framing, timber,
or precast concrete; and the manu-
facturer ' builder (for in these experi'
ments he was one and the same) be'
came an essential* partner. This held
true for specialist subcontractors
heating engineers, electrical, window
manufacturers, furniture producers.
The development of design was at no
point carried out in isolation, either
from the user'dient, or the manufac'
turer and builder.
As the experimental buildings went
into production, a series of building
bulletins familiar no doubt to many
of you—was issued describing the ex'
periments in detail. This development
work is a continuous process—a true
form of Architectural Research—of a
kind only equalled in Great Britain
by the recent work of the Nuffield
Foundation on hospitals.
As a very practical result of this
research and development work, the
average cost of secondary modern
schools in 1949 was estimated at about
<£32o per place; to'day, in spite of a
continuous rise in building costs, this
average is now below £240, and the
kind of schools now being planned
are acknowledged to be better educa'
tional buildings than those of yester'
day.
This series of experiments, which
will go on, is, I believe, unique. It
has given a vivid pointer to the way
in which the architect can act as the
focus of a group ranging from the
client on the one hand to the ultimate
sources of building materials and con'
struction skills on the other. This
lead is intended to be directed to the
building Authorities throughout the
country, and already similar Research
and Development groups are forming
in the Architectural Departments of
many of these Authorities.
In this respect, we are just at the
start of a new development of build'
ing, for once the latent power of the
Authorities becomes organised and
released (and, taken collectively, it is
tremendous), it can, I am convinced,
exert an irresistible pressure in those
areas of the building industry where,
up till recently, the architect has been
almost powerless.
The great building authorities have
been slow to realise their potential
strength in this matter, but the experi'
mental work I have just referred to
will touch off a chain reaction of con'
siderable power. The essential links
in the chain of the building process
may well become forged in the not too
distant future, and it is at this point
that not only the architect, but the
industrial producer may be rescued
from isolation.
To'day, I have been solely engaged
in the description of a particular aspect
of Architectural practice, valid for
England, at the present time. The
practice itself —the multitude of build'
ings coming from the offices, great
and small, all over the country, must
speak for themselves, but not only to
Architects, but to everyone.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


PROFESSOR WALTER GROPIUS
FIFTY YEARS OF ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT.
Stimulating Presence in Australia
“Modern architecture had no in-
ventor. If none of its ten most famous
pioneers had ever lived, it still would
have developed somehow, inevitably,
from the engineering and social
achievements of the late nineteenth
century.
But certainly the process would have
been greatly prolonged without Walter
Gropius; for he, more than any o.her
flamboyant designers, nursed the
architecture of the twentieth century
from infancy to maturity.”
So commences an article in the
“Current Affairs Bulletin” issued by the
University of Sydney.
In the early years of this century,
when the growth of industry was still
practically synonymous with the
growth of ugliness and the desecration
of all that the world had known by
the word “art,” Gropius saw the
futility of the fight which some artists
were trying to wage against the
machine.
Instead he taught that the ar.ist,
the engineer and the technician must
be brought together to work in mutual
understanding, and for the benefit of
the whole community.
He trained artists to be technicians,
and technical men who were artists.
He saw clearly, half a century ago,
how architecture should develop; and
most of what he invisaged had hap-
pened.
Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883,
to an architectural family. His father
was State Architect in Berlin, his great-
uncle, Martin Gropius, was the archi-
tect of the well-known Gewandhaus
in Leipzig and the Applied Art
Museum in Berlin. He early decided
to follow him.
From 1903 he studied architecture
at universities in Berlin and Munich,
where the beliefs of his teachers—
generally that the art of building was
inextricably bound to historical rules
and style—failed to convince him.
First Major Work,
His first major project was the Fagas
Works, a shoe-last factory at Ahlfeld
a.d. Leine, finished in 1911, which was
an extraordinarily prophetic building.
The main block of the Fagus works
was three storeys, with walls of glass
in steel frames stretched over the open
framework rather like a transparent
membrane. Not one principle behind
the construction and conception of
this building, and very few of even the
most trivial of its details, have been
discounted by subsequent theories or
discorevies over the next ensuing forty
years. Gropius was 27 when he de-
signed it.
In 1914 he was appointed chief
of the industrial section of the Werk-
bund exposition at Cologne, and built
for the occasion the “Fabrik,” a model
factory and office block. This build-
ing rather than the more studied and
significant Fagus factory made his
name as a leader of the younger archi-
tects.
The Bauhaus .
In 1918, he was appointed director
of the School of Applied Arts and also
of the Academy of Fine Art at
Weimar, Germany and he merged the
two schools and thus founded the in-
ternationally famous Bauhaus (School
of Building).
The Bauhaus began with painting
and extended beyond building into
most fields of industrial art. Gropius
brought to the direction of the school
his qualities of kindness, patience and
understanding with students, his tol-
erance of others’ ideas. But what
eventually gave the Bauhaus its inter'
national reputation was the simplicity
and sincerity of the philosophy of art.
He held that everything man makes
should follow nature’s rules and derive
its beauty from the demands of its
function and the character of the
materials used.
Beauty and Utility.
The training and experimental work
at the Bauhaus were based on the
principles that art and techniques must
be fused into one, that artists serve
society best by mastering techniques
so that their products are not only
beautiful but practical, and that this
mastery can best be achieved by actual
workshop familiarity with all manner
of materials.
Modern-minded architects, painters,
sculptors and designers flocked to the
Bauhaus from all parts of the world,
to find an atmosphere of stimulating
adventure into new forms of artistic
expression. They took the teachings
back with them and the influence of
the Bauhaus spread into most schools
of design throughout the world.
The original teaching at the Bauhaus
could very seldom be accused of arti-
ness, even on the most sophisticated
plane. Normally it was anchored to
reality by the feeling of moral obliga-
tion of usefulness to the community
which was instilled by its director.
In 1925, when Gropius was 42, the
Bauhaus moved to Dessau, necessitat-
ing a complex new building group.
This became one of the great build-
ings of the twentieth century, and
assured Gropius’s position amongst
creative artists.
The simplicity, integrity and entirely
unregimented qualities of the Gropius
type of architecture were anathema to
the Nazis, who saw in it something
universal, whereas they sought nation-
alism, and so they disbanded the
Bauhaus school and Gropius left
Germany.
He went to Italy for a short while,
then to England from 1934 to 1937,
where he practised in partnership with
Maxwell Fry. But England did not
provide great apportunities, so when
Harvard University, U.S.A., offered
him a position, for life, in which he
saw he would have strong influence
on the movement of modern architec-
ture,” he accepted. In 1938, he was
appointed chairman of the Department
of Architecture at Harvard and pro-
ceeded to turn this university’s Gradu-
ate School of Design into undoubtedly
the world’s most respected and pro-
ductive architectural school. He con-

tinued to practise and made a strong
point at Harvard that all members of
his teaching staff should have the right

In June, 1953, his 70th year, he

At the conclusion of the address
numerous questions were asked and
answered by Mr. Jeffrey and Mr. A.
E. Iliffe was called upon by the Presi'

An ideal arrangement for a single
court can be seen in Fig. 1 .
Overhead lighting is deprecated due
to disadvantages for maintenance and
its effect on the court during inclement
weather.
It will be appreciated, that a total
consumption of some 6kW for the
incandescent scheme discussed, makes
a flourescent system worthy of con*
sideration if the court is used regU'
larly.
A very good illumination can be
achieved by using five units mounted
each side of the court at a height of
17 ft. 6in. Each fitting should have
two 5 ft. 100 W flourescent tubes and
an asymetric distribution.
Alternatively 4 x 4 ft. 40W lamps
could be employed but in this case
difficulty would be experienced in con'
trolling the distribution notwithstand'
ing lower efficiency due to multi lamp
factor. Fluorescent is a great advan*
tage in overcoming the glare problem.
The total consumption of a floures'
cent scheme would be either 2.2 kW
in the first alternative or 2kW in the
case of 4 40W tubes. It will be
appreciated that a court being used

Artificial Lighting for Outdoor Sports
By MR. S. N. JEFFERY.
The spectacle of many sports is en-
hanced greatly when carried out at
night under artificial lighting. In Aus'
tralia where good climatic conditions
are combined with early nightfall, the
lighting engineer is called upon to
provide illumination for arenas, tracks
and stadia, covering many types of
sports, each of which has its own
peculiar problems of lighting.
In this paper it is proposed to dis'
cuss some of these problems, both from
the viewpoint of the participant and
that of the spectator, which quite often
have opposing requirements, and to
offer the solutions which have been
found satisfactory in practise.
1. TENNIS.
This sport is probably the most
popular in Australia and there are hum
dreds of courts which are equipped
with lighting. A player must be able
to see clearly a small light coloured
ball 2f 'in. in diameter, travelling to'
wards or from him at various heights
and angles. He must not suffer any
disability glare in tracing the flight of
a ball from one end of the court to an'
other. As far as possible the whole
volume of the court, representing the
area times the average maximum
height the ball reaches, must be evenly
illuminated, so avoiding the optical
illusion of different speeds of travel
through the air. A player must also
see clearly the vertical sides of the
net and the white court lines on the
ground. Umpire and spectators are
interested in seeing the ball, net, play'
ers and court lines.
Quite often the problem arises of
lighting more than one court where
insufficffiient room is available between
adjacent courts for the erection of
poles and lighting units. We will,
therefore, divide our solution into two
sections.
Single Courts.
The most efficient distribution is
that given by an elliptical angle re'
fleeter. At a mounting height of 17
ft. illumination can be maintained to
the required height at the centre of the
court. Six fittings mounted down each
side of the court and each housing
one 500 W G.L.S. lamp will provide
lighting for first class tennis at night.
As an alternative to the elliptical angle
type of unit, parabolic angle could be
employed but would be less efficient
due to its symmetrical distribution.

20 hours or more per week can show a
saving over an incandescent scheme
after a period of three years. A
suitable layout can be seen in Fig. 2
while an illuminated couft where
fluorescent was used is shown in
Fig. 3.
Multi Courts, etc.
The case often arises where there
are two or more counts to be lighted
where insufficient room does not permit
poles to be used safely between courts.
In this case the solution can be
achieved by using a cut-off type ad'
justable floodlight mounted at 25 ft.
Great care must be exercised in focus-
sing so that the players are not af-
fected by glare. For a twin court
twelve such floodlights housing one
1000 W lamp in each would provide
adequate illumination. Fig. 4 shows a
typical layout for a twin court. All
fittings should be vitreous enamelled
or rust-proofed steel.
11. FOOTBALL.
The seeing problems of all codes of
football are similar and the engineer
from the planning point of view can
treat them alike.
Both players and spectators require
to see the ball clearly at the opposing
ends of the field and glare must be
kept to a minimum. It is important
that the ball be illuminated from all
sides to avoid distortion caused by its
own shadow. As in tennis even il-
lumination is required to judge height
and speed that the ball is travelling.
The average maximum height reached
by the ball is approximately 40 ft.
Three main systems of lighting have
been and are being used:
(a) Floodlights mounted on towers
in the four corners of the ground.
(b) Multiple groups of floodlights
mounted on stands and/or poles and
(c) Lines of floodlights on each
side of the field.
Any of these methods can be sue-
cessful and the choice will be affected
by the architectural structure of the
ground together with the economics of
the installation.
CORNER LIGHTING
In this method four towers would
be used in the corners of the ground,
the height of each being 60 ft. to 70
ft. from playing level. The towers
could be constructed of timber, steel
or concrete and should have a plat'
fortn so that the floodlights can be
easily maintained.
The floodlight itself should be a
medium angle focussing type, have
universal adjustment and be suitable
for 1500 W lamps. It should be con'
structed in non ferrous metal or rust'
proofed steel and have either a silvered
glass or a polished aluminium reflector.
It is of great assistance to maintenance
staff if the back of the unit is remov-
able so that relamping and cleaning
can be carried out without affecting
the position of the floodlight itself and
thus disturbing its focussed position.
In present installations it has been
found that an average illumination of
8/12 f.c. provides adequate seeing
conditions for players and spectators
and this can be achieved by using 16
floodlights on each tower. Of this
sixteen, four should be fitted with
1500 W Class B 2 projector lamps and
twelve with 1500 W G.L.S. lamps.
When focussed each tower should
light the whole ground. A simple
method of achieving this is shown in
Fig 5. It will be noted that the four
projector lamps are used for the
farthest end of the ground. Each
tower should be treated in the same
way. By this method the ball, which
should be white, is illuminated from
all sides. This method of lighting will
be found suitable for a majority of
grounds and is the easiest method to
obtain even illumination.
Side Lighting.
In other parts of the world this
method is used extensively. Use is
made of 40 to 50 ft. stands on either
side of the ground. The problem of
glare to spectators, however, is greatly
increased and floodlights should have
provision for multi ring spill shields
to reduce glare. A satisfactory illumi-
nation can be achieved by using 40
1000 W floodlights each side of the
ground, mounted on the eaves of the
stands. The lamps should be frosted
and a general cross pattern of focus-
sing adopted.
This method is quite uneconomical
if poles have to be provided and there
are few applications where it could
be used in Australia.
Group Lighting.
In this method, use is- made of
stands, adjacent buildings, etc., and
clusters of floodlights used. The
types of floodlight will vary according
to the mounting height and position,
as will the size and type of lamp.
The disadvantage of this method is
that several types of floodlights may
be needed and it would be difficult to
obtain an even illumination. Illustra-
tions of the results of each type can
be seen in Figs. 6, 7 and 8.
It is important that provision where
possible should be made on any
schemes for future extensions to allow
smaller installations to be brought into
line with any lighting code that may
be brought in at a future date. To
give a higher illumination lamps can

be overrun. The percentage of re-
duced life can be calculated to fit in
with a playing season (Fig. 9.)
111. TROTTING TRACKS.
This sport illustrates very forcibly
how much the public appreciate a
sporting event taking place under ar'
tificial lighting. Until the introduc'
tion of night trotting, both in
America and Australia attendances
were falling rapidly but track lighting
gave this sport a new life and the
large attendances now enjoyed by
trotting clubs can be attributed, iin
no small measure, to the spectacle ere'
ated by artificial lighting and in
N.S.W. alone there are now ten clubs
staging night trotting.
Before planning the lighting of a
trotting track we must consider the
visual needs of the driver, the horse
and the spectator.
The driver has to see clearly the
running rail and the track. Uneven
lighting of the track will affect his
judgment in overtaking. He wants
to know visually how many laps he
has to go. He does not want to
suffer disability or discomfort glare.
Experiments in South America and
the United States have shown sur'
prising results of a horse’s reaction
to lighting. It had been found that
a horse is not affected by its own
shadow, neither is it affected by
glare, provided the glare is constant,
and not within one metre of its hori'
zontal vision. It is affected by big
changes in brightness of its path and
by quick moving glare sources
in its line of vision. These two fac'
tors must be taken into consideration.
The spectators’ seeing problems are
probably the most important. He has
paid money to see the racing and has
usually some other financial interest
to see the position of a particular
horse or horses at any stage of the
race. The identification is by a num-
ber on the horse’s side and by the
driver’s colours. It is therefore im'
portant that the colours are clearly
visible from the far side of the track.
An old cavalry saying was “Horses
first, men second and officers last’’ but
our solution here might be “Spec'
tators first, drivers second, and horses
last’’ as far as their respective lighting
requirements go.
There are three usual methods for
lighting trotting tracks.
(a) High level floodlighting.
j_b) Low level floodlighting.
(c) Overhead track lighting.
The first of these consists of
groups of floodlights mounted on
high towers and will be discussed
under Showgrounds.
The second form has been used
overseas but not as yet in Australia
and consists of floodlights mounted
on the grandstand side of the track,
2/3 ft. from ground level, using 1000
watt floodlights at a spacing of
approximately 40 ft. Several factors
make this system undesirable for use
in Australia and it is proposed in
this paper to deal only with the
overhead system.
The spectacle of night track events
is increased if the track only is ih
luminated. An illumination of 15/20
f.c. is adequate to see all details of
racing on the far side of the track.
The choice of fitting is governed
by distribution to confine the light'
ings as far as possible to the track
which averages 40 ft. in width. The
nost suitable unit is a deep bowl
dispersive reflector having a 30° cut
off from the horizontal. It is obvi'
ously not so important to have the
same level of illumination on the
outer side of the track as the running
rail and it is therefore permissible to
bring in towards the centre, the
whole spacing and network of fit'
tings. In large metropolitan tracks,
where spectators view from all sides
of the track it is desirable to have
three lines of units. These should
be spaced at 20 ft. along the track
and 18 ft. across the track with the
first row 3 ft. from the running rail.
In country tracks nearly all the spec-
tators are accommodated on the one
side of the track and two lines of units
are sufficient. The spacing in this case
could be extended to 25 ft. along the
track and 20 ft. across the track, the
first row being 8/10 ft. from the
inside running rail. In both cases
the mounting height should be 17
ft. 6in.
Typical layouts can be seen in Figs.
10 and 11.
It has been stated earlier that a
horse is affected by a rapidly moving
glare course in its line of vision. It
will be appreciated that a horse
travelling at speed along a line of
constant glare sources could have the
same effect. For this reason an ex-
tended skirt painted matt black is fit'
ted to the lighting unit which also

reduces glare to the driver. It is
important that the units are fixed
rigidly to the catenary suspensions, to
avoid side swing caused by winds.
The problem of identifying colours
on the far side of the track is ac'
centuated by the silhouette effect
caused by the brightness of the track
behind the horse.
It can be overcome by moving the
first row of lights directly over the
running rail or alternatively, to ih
luminate the side of the horse from in'
side the track.
The first alternative is rather urn
economical as half the light from the
first row would then fall on the inner
side of the running rail. A cheaper
method is to employ two 25 ft. poles
with two 1000 W floodlights on each
and focussed onto the side of the
horses and in the same direction as the
running.
A lap indicator should be positioned
near the finishing line, positioned so
that it can be easily seen by the driver.
The last lap is denoted by red warning
lamps across the track at the finishing
line and at the end of the leger
straight. Ten 40W lamps sprayed red
at 4 ft. spacing is quite sufficient for
this purpose. Extra lighting is re'
quired across the finishing line where
photo finish is used to bring the level
up to approximately 100 F.C. There
should, however, be a grading in'
crease and decrease of illumination on
both sides of the finishing line to avoid
brightness contrast on the track. Light'
ing w has also to be provided for the
visual semaphore but this will depend
on its size and position. A track
illuminated by overhead lighting can
be seen in Fig. 12 .
IV. SHOWGROUNDS.
Many diverse events and sports can
•and do take place on a showground
arena. These sports range from horse
jumping to sheaf throwing and from
trotting to canine displays. It is
therefore not desirable that any
localised lighting be attempted.
The most satisfactory method is to
use four or six towers, depending on
the size of the arena. These towers
should be 80 ft. to 100 ft. high and
constructed so that together about 96
floodlights could be employed. The
floodlights should be suitable for
1000'1500W lamps and be of a focus'
sing type, medium angle. It is desir'
able that due to difficulty of mainten'
ance the units be constructed of non
ferrous metal and that the trunion be
of sufficient strength to withstand
windage.
The arena should be divided up in
sections equivalent to the number of
towers and each section illuminated
by the tower in that section. It
would not be necessary to employ
projector lamps, the maximum throw
being obtained by the narrowest beam
angle. The coefficient of beam
utilisation in this case would be rela'
tively high and an efficient scheme
will be provided.
V. BOWLING GREENS.
Although bowling is a very old
pastime it has until recent years
been played only in daylight. With
its increasing popularity, however,

the sports enthusiasts have also
chosen to eat into the hours of dark'
ness and illuminated greens have re'
suited. The hours of play at night
are limited due to the effect of dew
on the turf; but its advantages can be
gauged from the fact that on some
country greens the attendances on the
two week day evenings under arti'
ficial light exceed the week-end
attendances.
The green is divided into a number
of strips which are known as rinks,
so that four or more groups of players
are playing simultaneously. Generally
speaking, the idea is for a player to
aim his bowl (or wood) to locate as
near as possible to a small white ball
known as the “kitty” situated at the
opposite end of the rink. He, there-
fore, requires good illumination on the
area surrounding the “kitty.” To
judge the amount of bias required
down the rink an even illumination
is required over the whole green. The
play is reversable on the rink. The
player is permitted to knock away
opponents’ bowls from the kitty
but it is not necessary to visually
recognise individual bowls as a team
member is permitted to give directions
from the opposite end.
It is important that the lighting of
the green be carried out from the
sides of the green.
Overhead lighting would be difficult
to maintain and in inclement weather
would have injurious effects on the
grass.
The most satisfactory method of
lighting is to use three 1500 W GLS
lamps in an adjustable cut-off type
floodlight, having an anodised alu-
minium reflector, on each side of the
green. These should be mounted at
a height of 25 ft. from the green,
spaced 42 ft. apart and be parallel to
the rinks. The main directive beam
should be aimed to the far side of
the green to reduce the amount of
spill light and thus increase the effici-
ency of the installation. Frequently,
the direction of the rinks is rotated
90° and it is therefore necessary to
repeat this form of lighting on the
remaining two sides. The opposite
sides in each case would be switched
together so that only those two sides
parallel with play are switched on. Fig.
13 shows typical layout. This method
of green lighting will provide an
average illumination of some 5 f.c.
and does not provide any glare source
in the field of vision. Fig. 14.
VI. GREYHOUND TRACKS.
As mentioned previously when dis-
cussing trotting tracks, the spectacle of
track lighting is a great aid to a
promoter in his showmanship.
Good lighting, besides enhancing
the spectacular side of the track, pro'
vides at atmosphere of efficiency
which is exteremely valuable in gain'
ing the confidence of the public.
Without evidence to the contrary,
it has been assumed that a greyhound
is not visually affected by lighting
except to see its objective clearly, and
the problem then is confined to
meeting the requirements of the
spectator.
Greyhound tracks are relatively
narrow averaging between 18 ft. to
25 ft. and it will be appreciated that
when using RLM dispersive reflectors
a fair proportion of the total flux
will fall outside the inner rail unless
an expensive catenary suspension
system is used. The object is to first,
contain the light within the track so
that it will stand out as a ribbon
of light, and secondly, to prevent the
distraction of attention and reduction
of contrast which is inevitable if the
sources of light are visible.
By designing a special fitting, not
only can these requirements be met,
but having the same efficiency as an
RLM dispersive reflector, it will pro'
vide a far more efficient overall sys'
tern as all the useful flux is directed
onto the track. This type of unit is
shown in Fig. 15.
The fitting is rectangular in shape,
the shorter sides being fitted with
mirror glass reflectors to punch the
light as far upward and down the track

as possible. The two long sides are
fitted with opal glass reflectors to give
diffused light immediately below the
fitting. The bottom of the sides are
left matt black to eliminate skirt
glare.
When racing, the greyhounds are
usually grouped fairly close to the
inner running rail and consequently
the main directive beam should be
aimed at this side of the track. This
will be achieved by having a mounting
height of 14 ft. and a projection of
3 ft. from the inner rail. An even
coverage will result from a spacing of
20 ft. between units. In metropolitan
tracks 1500 W lamps should be used
but 1000 Wlamps are usually sufficient
for country tracks.
An arrangement of fittings is shown
in Fig. 16 and a night photo of a
track illustrating brightness contrast is
shown in Fig. 17.
VII. SWIMMING POOLS.
On warm summer evenings many
people visit their local swimming pool
and lighting should fulfil three main
requirements; act as an attraction to
bathers; add to the entertainment of
spectators; add to the safety of
bathers.
A well lighted pool attracts
bathers to the water, an important
consideration to the commercial pro-
prietor. At galas and swimming com-
petitions, spectators should be able to
observe the movements of the
swimmers both on and below the
water surface. Every foot of the bot-
tom of a pool should be adequately
illuminated so that anyone in difficulties
will be noticed by attendants.
It is generally agreed that to light
a pool sufficiently well to meet these
requirements there should be both
overhead and underwater lighting.
Two alternative types of housing
can be used for underwater lighting,
known as dry niche and wet niche.
These are shown in Figs. 1& and 19.
The dry niche method is favoured
as maintenance can be carried out
without draining the pool. Also the
watertight glazed frame is not dis-
turbed after the original installation.
As the water is likely to absorb much
of the light, high intensity beams will
be necessary from the floodlights, but
care must be exercised to avoid un-
sightly shafts of light in front of
every porthole. The ideal distribu-
tion is that obtained from a fine fila-
ment lamp in a reflector giving con-
centration in the vertical plane and
a wide spread in the horizontal plane.
The spacing and wattage will depend
on the size of the pool and the depth,
but in all cases the tops of the niches
should be 12 in. to 18 in. below the
surface of the water .
It is not possible to stereotype over-
head lighting as the surroundings of
pools differ widely. In many cases
the pools have beautiful surroundings
which can be enhanced by suitable
floodlights. Fig. 20.
Floodlighting is also necessary for
diving boards and slides. Ornamental
lighting can be provided for con-
courses and cascades.
Whatever form of overhead light-
ing is employed, the edges of the pool
should be well illuminated and glare
kept to a minimum.
VIII. CONCLUSION.
In this paper the lighting of the
actual sport has been discussed but
in any night event adequate ancillary
lighting has to be provided for such
areas as exits, betting rings, car parks
and stands. If night sports are to
be a success the lighting must be
adequate in every phase.
The flexibility of the methods of
control of artificial electric lighting
is such that it is frequently possible
to provide night illumination which is
more effective for its particular pur-
pose than daylight, and where spec-
tacular effect is required, the superi-
ority of artificial illumination is
abundantly evident.
In solving the variety of problems
that arise from sports lighting one
cannot overlook the importance of
installation and running costs, especi-
ally in the cases of small clubs whose
only income is from members’ sub-
scriptions, but in those activities whose
success is measured by the number
of spectators they attract, more elabor-
ate schemes are necessary if full use
is to be made of the spectacular effects
which can be alone produced by first-
class lighting.
In these cases the additional outlay
in the first instance is amply repaid
by the resultant increased revenue.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Falk: The President opened
question time by asking Mr. Jeffrey
whether any serious consideration had
been given to lighting for night
cricket.
Mr. Jeffrey: In reply, the lecturer
pointed out that in the case of cricket
players they had a very difficult visual
task in following a comparatively small
dark coloured ball in practically any

direction over the playing field. It
would be extremely difficult therefore
to arrange floodlighting so as to avoid
disability glare. It is possible that
some improvements would be obtained
by the use of a light coloured ball
but it is doubtful whether this would
be acceptable.
Mr. Craker : Mr. Craker queried
the speaker’s preference for elliptical
angle reflectors for tennis court light-
ing, suggesting that this type of unit
would not provide illumination in the
upper space above the playing area
for the illumination of a high ball.
Mr. Jeffrey: The speaker in reply
pointed out that in his experience the
elliptical angle reflector provided il-
lumination to a sufficiently high point
above the net and had the added ad-
vantage of more even general cover-
age over the area of the court.
Mr. Dunn: Referring to the un-
derwater floodlighting of swimming
pools, Mr. Dunn drew atention to
tfie fact that the fittings shown in the
lecture were directed downwards at a
slight angle from the horizontal and
queried the reason for this.
Mr. Jeffrey: In reply the lecturer
pointed out that the setting angle was
not critical provided the general direc-
tion of projection was slightly below
the horizontal, the main object being
to confine the greater part of the flux
to the lower part of the pool.
Mr. Hyatt: Referring to the speak-
er’s comments on low level race-track
lighting, Mr. Hyatt requested further
information on the speaker s conten-
tion that this was not, in general, as
satisfactory as high level lighting.
Mr. Jeffrey: The lecturer pointed
out that the principal disadvantages
in low level lighting were high cost
due to increased installed wattage and
the necessity of underground wiring
as compared with overhead reticula-
tion. From the observer’s point of
view low level lighting did not illumi-
nate horses and riders sufficiently for
ease of identification.
Mr. Emmerson: Referring to the
lecturer’s remarks on fluorescent light-
ing for sporting events, Mr. Emmerson
suggested that this form of lighting
would become more prominent in the
future due to better efficiency and low
brightness.
Mr. Jeffrey: Mr. Jeffrey in reply
stated that it was very difficult to
obtain accurate flux control from
fluorescent tubes and was of the
opinion that this form of lighting
would be confined to sports where the
area covered was comparatively small.
Mr. Falk: Referring to the last
speaker’s comments, Mr. Falk asked
the lecturer whether any special pre-
cautions had been found necessary
against the stroboscopic flicker effect
with flourescent lighting, particularly
on tennis courts.
Mr. Jeffrey: Mr. Jeffrey in reply
stated that in his experience this effect
was quite unnoticed by the players
but generally some provision was made
in the form of tulamp type
ballasts to compensate for strobo-
scopic flicker.
REMARKS OF MR. A. E. ILIFFE.
At the end of the evening’s pro-
ceedings the President called upon
Mr. A. E. Iliffe, a visitor to the meet-
ing, to address a few words on the
subject of the lecture. Mr. Iliffe was
introduced as the Director and Sales
Manager of the Benjamin Electric
Ltd. of London and as responsible for
special lighting fixtures illustrated. Mr.
Iliffe thanked the President for his
kind words and congratulated Mr.
Jeffrey on the presentation of his
lecture.
He pointed out that sports light-
ing cannot, under any circumstances,
be carried out cheaply. A great deal
of investigation ,is necessary to ensure
that the lighting conformed with the
special requirements of the particular
sport involved both from the point of
view of the players and spectators. In
many cases the visual acuity required
was of the highest order, as for in-
stance in the case of boxing where
it had been proved that a boxer’s
left hook could travel at 120 m.p.h.
Seconly, Mr. Iliffe drew atention to
the vital necessity of maintenance.
A great deal of money in this con-
nection could be saved by correct
choice of equipment and it was use-
less installing expensive equipment
unless adequate provision were made
for the annual cost of thorough
maintenance.
Finally, Mr. Iliffe stated that in his
belief night sports were growing in
popularity in every country and it
was very wise to adopt the broadest
possible view when designing the
lighting installation to ensure that
adequate provision is made for the
future expansion of the playing area
to cater for a multiplicity of different
sporting events.
At the end of the meeting Mr.
Knight proposed the vote of thanks
to the lecturer for his interesting ad-
dress and the motion was seconded
by Mr. Craker and carried by the
meeting with acclamation.
MELBOURNE NEWSLETTER
Largest building contracts during
April, in Melbourne, have been let by
the State Housing Commission.
They total about £890,000, distri-
buted over a number of contracts:
about £600,000 in the metropolitan
area and £290,000 in country centres.
The suburban contracts include 100
timber houses at Broadmeadows for
£209,897, 15 blocks of brick flats, 60
units for £127,211.
A contract for additional floors and
alterations to State offices at 179
Queen Street has been let to W. C.
Burne & Sons Pty. Ltd., for
£240,690. Portion of the building is
occupied by the Housing Commission.
The Architects’ Department of the
City Council has been instructed to
prepare plans for a complete housing
scheme on a site owned by the Council
in Pigiton St., Carlton. The proposal
is to include 230 housing units on
the area and to provide some accom-
modation for old people.
The trustees of the Public Library
and Museum have proposed a building
programme which might be carried
out within 8 to 10 years. A
Cabinet sub-committee will investigate
the proposals which are estimated to
involve an expenditure of about
£2,000,000. It is suggested that the
National Gallery should be transferred
to the site reserved for it at Wirth’s
Park, just over Princess Bridge, and
the National Museum to the old ob-
servatory site in the Domain. A new
wing on the Latrobe St. frontage
would be one of the first under-
takings.
After many months of indecision
and, at times, heated argument, the
Melbourne City Council has decided
that the first section of the rebuilding
of the Western Market area —Collins
St., William St., Little Flinders St.
and Market St.—should be proceeded
with.
The winners of the competition held
about five years ago for the develop-
ment of the site, Leslie M. Perrott
and partners, have been instructed to
proceed with the preparation of
working drawings for one section.
This portion will occupy the
Collins St. frontage and extend back
along Market St. and William St. for
a depth of 55 ft. The building will
be of eleven stories and present esti-
mate of the cost is stated at
£1,480,000.
The building will be of steel and

concrete with a lavish use of glass.
The architects expect the building to
be ready by the middle of 1957.
Tenders are being invited by
Smith, Tracey, Lyon and Brock for
a very attractive modern type of
building to be used as a night shelter
for men, for the St. Vincent de Paul
Society.
The five storey building, which will
be in Flemington Road, North Meh
bourne, will provide shelter for 200
men. It will be of reinforced con'
Crete construction, with hollow block
floors and anodised aluminium infill
panels.
Work is proceeding steadily with
the brown coal gasification plant at
Morwell and it is reported that
B.H.P. 60 has allocated 270 tons of
steel for the manufacture of pipes for
the Dandenong'Tooronga section of
the pipe line.
The State Government is moving
forward as qmickly as funds will permit
with , th e erection of new schools and
additions to exis.ing buildings. Five
contracts were let early in the month
for timber frame classrooms in various
districts for a total of £148,500.
It has been announced that the
directors of Chevron Limited, owners
of the well known private hotel on
St. Kilda Rd.. will add to the present
hotel building an eleven storey hotel
with accommodation for 600 guests.
The company recently purchased a
site, 99 ft. by 334 ft., on St. Kilda
Road, adjoining the hotel. This will
be used for the new building. It
will be necessary to obtain approval
of the Building Regulations Committee
of the City Council for a limit height
building to be built on the site.
Chevron was recently granted a
liquor licence and some alterations are
now being made to the present building
to comply with the Licensing Act.
A property in Commercial Road,
opposite the hotel, was also bought.
This will be converted into a garage
and staff quarters.
E. A. Watts Pty. Ltd. have a con'
tract for the erection of a new factory
building for Taubmans (Vic.) Pty.

Building Progress
Hurstville.
Nearly 2000 homes have been built
in the Hurstville municipality in the
last three years. These represent a
total building cost of almost
£5,000,000.
In addition, in that period, the
council approved construction of in'
dustrial and commercial premises, ah
terations, etc., valued at almost
£785,000.
GEORGE HUDSON PTY. LTD.
A HUNDRED YEARS OF EXPANSION.
The present company of George
Hudson Pty. Ltd. had its origins in
the firm of Hudson Brothers, which
commenced operations in the 1850’s.
This firm of Hudson Bros, were car'
riage builders in a large way and were
contractors to the N.S.W.Government
in respect of considerable quantities
of rolling stock used in the early rail'
ways of the State. The firm also
operated timber mills and retail yards.
Subsequently, the undertaking was
divided, the elder brothers continued
the carriage'building section which
eventually became the company now
known Clyde Engineering Co. Ltd.
—whilst the younger brother, George
Hudson, took over the timber section
of the business.
Company Formed in 1909.
In 1904 the business was floated
into a company known as George
Hudson & Son Ltd., with an autho'
rised capital of £ 10,000, and at the
beginning of 1909, acquired the in'
terests of the Kauri Timber Co. Ltd.
at Blackwattle Bay, Glebe, to which
site the company’s operations were
subsequently transferred and this ac-
quisition may be regarded as the start'
ing point of the very considerable
expansion which subsequently took
place. Mr. George William Hudson
died in 1929, and his brother, Mr.
Harold Stanley Hudson, became Man'
aging Director, and consolidated the
business during the depression years.
On the death of Mr. Harold S. Hud'
son in 1948, Mr. Charles H. Hando,
who had been with the company since
1909, was appointed Managing Director
The company has always been pio'
neers in the Industry and were the
first to commence Ready'cut cottages.
Parquetry floors and the manufacture
of dowel doors.
Post-war Expansion.
Since the war, the business has con'
tinued to expand, as since 1945 over
6000 homes have been supplied
through its Ready'cut Department.
The accommodation which had
been occupied at 7 Castlereagh Street
became entirely inadequate so in 1950
the company acquired premises at 219
Elizabeth Street, Sydney, and these
after extensive remodelling were
opened last September.
HUDSON'S "READY-CUT" HOME AT THE SHOW.
When workmen are scarce and homes are wanted in a hurry, no doubt many a
builder would undertake the putting together of these ready-cut homes. In former
years a builder would scorn to be associated with "ready mades," as they belonged
to the layman class and did not give the builder scope to show his skill. Now,
with things as they are, the builder who can oblige by putting together a home in
a hurry would be a godsend to clients waiting week after week or year after year.
George Hudson Pty. Ltd. erected this timber "Ready-Cut" home, typical of one of
their ten designs, at the Royal Easter Show. The house was fully furnished by Grace
Brothers and representatives from George Hudson were in attendance to give in-
formation on how to go about building these Ready-Cut Homes. Alongside the
door was a showroom displaying parquetry flooring, doors, bathroom fittings and
many other lines. A feature of this display was a demonstration by a carpenter
from their joinery department actually making doors and windows.

Death of Sir Charles
Rosenthal
Prominent Soldier and Architect.
Major'General Sir Charles Rosen-
thal died on May 11th at the age
of 79.
Sir Charles had a distinguished re-
cord in the first World War, and was
later a Member of the Legislative As-
sembly, an alderman of Sydney City
Council and Administrator of Norfolk
Island.
Born at Berrima, N.S.W., he be-
gan architectural studies at the age of
15, and later practised in Western
Australia, Melbourne and Sydney.
At the outbreak of war he joined
the First A.I.F. and during the war he
was decorated with the C. 8., C.M.G.,
and D. 5.0., received a knighthood,
and was awarded the Belgian Croix
de Guerre and the French Croix de
Guerre with palms. He was wounded
four times and gassed once.
For many years he was selected by
the Returned Servicemen’s League to
lead the Anzac Day march through
Sydney.
Sir Charles represented Bathurst in
the Legislative Assembly from 1922 to
1925. and for three years was an aid'
erman of the Sydney City Council.
Later, he was elected to the Legisla-
tive Council. In 1937 he was ap-
pointed Administrator of Norfolk Is-
land and held that post until 1945.
He was a Fellow of the Royal In-
stitute of British Architects, a Life
Fellow of the Royal Australian Insti'
tute of Architects, a past president of
the Federal council of the R.A.1.A.,
and for four years president of the
N.S.W. Institute of Architects.

Women's Amenities Centre
Hyde Park, Sydney
PROVISION FOR CARE OF CHILDREN.
Amenities for women, particularly
for women with children, and more
particularly with babies, is seriously
lacking in Sydney, for apart from par'
tial facilities by some city business
houses and railway stations, little pro'
vision has been made. The present
Centre, which was opened last month,
is not intended to provide accommo'
dation for the whole of the city, but
rather to be one of a number of such
centres.
The site, at the corner of Elizabeth
and Park Streets, is situated centrally
to the shopping areas and between
three railway stations, St. James,
Museum and Town Hall, and in close
proximity to incoming and outgoing
tramway stopping places in Elizabeth
Street and Park Street, and, in addb
tion, at a taxi-cab rank and bus stop
and also conveniently located for
motor transport vehicles.
Limitation of Use.
One such centre will not accommo'
date all who wish to leave children
at the Centre, consequently some re'
striction must be placed upon the
number of children who may remain
at the Centre at any one time, and
also upon the number of times a par'
ticular child may be left at the Centre.
For this reason and because it is
necessary to feed children left for
longer than three hours, the period
during which a child may remain at
the building must also be limited.
This, however, has the effect of in'
creasing the number of women to
whom the nursery and creche will be
of service, e.g.. if children are allow'
ed to remain for a period of eight
hours, a maximum of forty children
could be accommodated each day, but
if the period during which the chib
dren remain is reduced to three hours,
the total number of children accom'
modated during one day would be
increased to approximately one hum
dred. A period of three hours is con'
sidered to be sufficient to permit
women keeping essential appointments
such as attending the doctor, etc.

Partly with the object of prevent-
ing overcrowding, although the num-
ber to be accommodated in the build-
ing will be limited, and partly to off-
set the high cost of the building and
the cost of operating the Centre, a
charge for the admission of children
to the Centre will be made, as well
as for the use of the lounge and
amenities.
It is understood that the amenities
centre will.be open from 8.30 a.m.
until 11 p.m. each day, including
Saturdays and Sundays, and the nur-
sery and creche between the hours of
9 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day, exclu-
sive of Saturdays and Sundays.
In addition to the care of children
and babies, the Centre will provide a
meeting place, with lounge and re-
freshment room, where women may
rest, await and meet their friends,
where light refreshments may be ob-
tained, parcels left or a taxi called.
In addition to the provision of the
usual conveniences, the building will
contain showers, bathroom, foot-baths
and dressing-room for those who wish
to change before attending theatres
or dances, an ironing-board for those
who wish to press frocks, needles and
thread for the care of stockings; while
a chemist shop will give essential ser-
vice in the building.
The creche is located on the first
floor, with modern nursery accommo-
dation, including cots for babies and
with feeding rooms, kitchen, etc.
Although all children will be examined
before admission to ensure, as far as
possible, that children suffering from
contagious diseases will not be admit-
ted, some diseases may not develop
until after the child has been re-
ceived at the Centre, so an isolation
room is provided.
Open-air Playground.
An additional nursery will be pro-
vided at park level for pre-school age
children from two to six years of age.
with open-air playground and playing
equipment on park land. This build'
ing will contain a playroom, kitchen,
lavatories, toy stores, etc. Although
it is not intended to provide meals, it
will be necessary to supply milk and
possibly sandwiches. Collapsible beds
will be provided to enable children
to sleep at the Centre, while a peram-
bulator store is provided at the en-
trance to the building.
Much importance is placed upon
the personnel to be employed in the
building. The nurse in charge of the
creche, in addition to being experi-
enced in nursery work and also hold'
ing obstetrics, Tresillian and Mother-
craft Certificates, will be able to ad-
vise mothers as well as care for chil-
dren.
Details of accommodation is as fol-
lows :
(1) A general rest-room furnished
with lounges and including a “snack
bar” for drinks and light r cf-eshments,
a chemist’s store, a baby-feeding room
and telephone and writing facilities.
Small show window displays extend
along Park Street.
(2) The entrance vestibule has a
parcel-minding and preliminary child
reception office, also a pram park.

ALUMINIUM FOR INDUSTRIAL ROOFING
A NEW CORRUGATED SHEET.
The choice of a suitable roofing
material for industrial buildings has
always been a subject for some dis-
cussion, but it can hardly be disputed
that durability is the quality that must
be given first consideration. Against
this must be weighed the material’s
cost, for, as in so many other appli-
cations, low cost and really long-lasting
qualities rarely combine in one mate-
rial. The reconciliation of these two
factors is a major problem for the
designer, who must weigh initial ex-
penditure against the probable costs
of maintenance and replacement.
Before the war, labour and service
costs were not inordinately high, and
the use of comparatively cheap roofing
materials (needing considerable main-
tenance and, even so, having a rela-
tively poor chance of survival for
long) was justified. To-day, however,
labour costs have risen to such an
extent —and show no signs of falling
in the near future—that the industrial
concern planning new buildings or the
re-roofing of old must look for a mate-
rial with sufficient durability to allow
maintenance to be reduced to negli-
gible proportions. Durability alone is
not enough, however, for unless a roof-
ing material has sufficient strength to
enable it to be used in economical
self-supporting sheets, the cost of the
extensive roof work required to give
it support makes its use quite un-
economical.
Advantages of Aluminium
Roofing.
A material that is now becoming
recognised as having all the necessary
attributes of a successful cladding
material is aluminium. No longer re'
stricted in its uses by its high pre'war
cost (relative to other materials) or
by post-war scarcity, aluminium can
provide a sound answer to the prob'
lem of industrial roofing. It has
weathering characteristics of a very
high order, and in addition combines
strength and lightness to an extent
that makes it the ideal roofing mate'
rial.
Lack of experience of aluminium’s
characteristics has until recently held
back appreciation and understanding
of its durability. In the last few years,
however, it has been possible to make
extensive tests of its resistance to cor'
rosion in comparison with other
metals; results of these experiments
not only reveal aluminium’s high re'
sistance to attack but also provide the
information to enable it to be used
to the greatest advantage.
Of the whole range of aluminium'
based alloys, the pure metal itself has
the highest resistance to corrosion (ex'
cept in exclusively marine applica'
tions), it is, of course, well known
that this resistance is due to the very
thin, adherent and self-healing film of
oxide that rapidly forms on the metal
when exposed to the air. Pure alu-
minium, however, is comparatively
soft, and before it can be used as a
practical sheeting material it must be
alloyed with another metal to pro-
vide strength. If 1 g-% of manganese
is added, the result is an alloy that still
retains its high resistance to corrosion,
and at the same time possesses media-
nical properties (an Ultimate Tensile
Stress of 12-14 tons/sq. in.) that make
it excellent for use in sheet form for
roofing. This particular alloy, Noral
3S, conforms to 855.1470 NS3, and
its universal use as a roofing and sid-
ing material makes a comparison of
its weathering properties with those
of other materials of great interest.
Corrosion Resistance.
A very comprehensive investigation
of. the corrosion resistance of alu-
minium alloys and other metals has
been carried out in America during
the last twenty years. In this inves-
tigation test pieces were exposed to
typical rural, marine and industrial at-
mospheres, and measuiements taken of
the degree and rate of corrosion; from
the results obtained it has been pos-
sible to predict the behaviour and
length of life of a variety of metals
in various situations. Results show
that Noral 3S sheet 0.036 in. thick, on
which corrosion advances by the for'
mation of surface pits, could be ex-
pected (allowing a factor of safety of
two) to last more than 50 years in
revere marine or industrial environ'
ments, and over 100 vears in tropical
or rural situations. This life’ is the
length of time (approximate, since
conditions vary greatly in different
localities) that will elapse before pit'
ting becomes so deep as to bring
about complete penetration. Com'
parative figure? for galvanised steel
sheet (quoted by the British Standards
Institution) show that sheet 0.036 in.
thick, and with a sine coating of 0.75
oz/sq. ft. on each surface, will last
four and a half years in industrial,
10 years in urban, 16 years in coastal
and 25 years in rural environments.
No allowance is made for a safety
factor in these figures for galvanised
sheet.
Whereas it is not surprising that
aluminium shows greater resistance to
attack than galvanised steel, the re'
suits of comparison with other metals
are rather more unexpected. These
show that 3S aluminium sheet cor'
rodes very much more slowly than
copper and zinc in rural and some
marine situations, and rather more
slowly in industrial surroundings;
figures for two industrial locations
give the following corrosion rates
(depth of pitting in thousandths of
an inch per year):—
New York: copper, 0.047; zinc,
0.190; aluminium, 0.031.
Altoona Pa.: copper, 0.046; zinc,
0.190; aluminium, 0.025.
These figures are taken from re'
ports of the investigations carried out
by the American Society for Testing
Materials.
An important feature of the nature
of the corrosion of aluminium is that
attack is self'Stifling; a rate of attack
that may be quite high when the metal
is new will slow down within a year
or two to a very low figure as the coat'
ing of oxide builds up. Moreover,
since this resistance is an inherent
feature of the metal itself, a scratch
or other breakdown of the original
surface cannot lead to a rapid attack
on the body of the metal.
Coupling these facts with know'
ledge of the behaviour of light alloy
sheets in specific industrial installa'
tions shows that from the point of
view of durability the l£% manga'
nese aluminium alloy is completely
suitable for use as a cladding material,

virtues of being non-combustible, not

nised as being suitable, however, a
great deal of its value is lost unless
it is applied in a form that takes ad'
vantage of its characteristics. For in'
dustrial buildings, it has long been
acknowledged that corrugated sheets
form a comparatively inexpensive yet
effective roofing. If we substitute
aluminium for steel in sheets of the
existing forms, however, we are not
making the most of the light metal’s
qualities; we need an aluminium roof'
ing sheet specifically designed for the
industrial building.
The main requirements of this roof'
ing sheet are that it should be as far
as possible pleasing in appearance,
sufficiently rigid to span at least 7ft.
6in. for use over the widely'Spaced
purlins of industrial buildings, and to
allow for variations in structure de'
sign, and to be of a form that will
allow maintenance men to walk on
it without fear of local damage to the
sheet. To ensure that these conditions
are fulfilled with the maximum econo<
my in material is a problem that can
be decided only by practical testing.
Experimental work, carried out by
Aluminium Laboratories Limited and
by Aluminium Development Associa'
tion, shows that the limiting criterion
is to produce a sheet strong enough
to withstand the concentrated weight*
of a man without local buckling of the
corrugation.
New Profile Developed.
The profile finally shown by de'
velopment work to be the most suit'
able and one that fulfils all require'
ments is an asymmetrical section with
deep straight'sided corrugations at sin.
pitch; troughs are wide for rapid
water'shedding, and the narrow crests
are designed to resist denting by the
boots of maintenance parties. This
new ‘lndustrial’ sheet, which is made
by Northern Aluminium Company
Ltd., has a standard thickness for
roofing purposes of 20 SWG, and can
withstand without damage the concern
trated load of 200 lb. on a Sin. square
specified by BS.CP3 (Chapter V);
since the long span possible with this
sheet (up to 9ft.) reduces the number
of purlins and attachments required,
the cost and weight of a roof may
often be less than it would be if one
of the less structurally efficient roof'
ing materials were used. Thinner
sheet (22 SWG) can be used for sid'
ing in the interests of economy. The
asymmetrical profile has been found
to be quite pleasing to the eye, par'
ticularly for walls, and imparts to the
building clean lines unobtainable with
any of the symmetrical profiles. This
appearance, coupled with the pleasant
grey colour to which the metal
weathers, may well be a potent factor
in establishing this new material,
which is now coming on to the market
in quantity, as first choice for the roof'
ing and siding of many industrial and
other buildings.
Answer to Housing
Shortage
“Leave Building To Builders,”
Chairman’s Plea.
The way to solve the housing prob'
lem is to leave it to competent free
enterprise builders experienced in that
field of operations, said Mr. Frank
Taylor, Chairman of Taylor Woodrow
Ltd., building and civil engineering
contractors, of England, in his review
posted to shareholders on May 4.
Offering freehold, three'bedroomed
houses at prices ranging from £1615
to £1950, inclusive of road and legal
charges, the company, Mr. Taylor
maintained, had played no mean part
in aiding the Government to exceed
its target of 300,000 houses in 1953.
He recommended an American slum
clearance scheme to the Government
for adoption. The City of New York
was instanced as an example. It had
expropriated areas of unsatisfactory
dwellings and sold the land to private
builders, who then built apartments
for letting or for sale under a CO'
operative apartment developments
scheme.
Mr. Taylor also stressed that the
country badly needed a major road
programme.
One Risks, Many Benefits.
Mr. Taylor emphasised the help
which overseas contracts gave both to
the country in which development was
taking place, and also to the home
export trade. Not only were extern
sive calls made for steel, cement, paint
and many other materials, but the
employment of local labour increased
spending power and the completion
of the project increased the local
economic resources, with the result
that demands for consumer goods fob
lowed.
“The commercial risk in carrying
“The benefits conferred are shared by
many. In my frequent journeys about
the world, I am becoming increasing'
ly aware of competition from Con'
tinental contractors and it is evident
that they are making bids, that are
being accepted, for works at prices
that we know to be well below the
true value of the costs.
“This is made possible by help from
their Governments by way of tax re'
lief or other concessions. In assisting
such undertakings, it may well be that
the Governments of the countries
concerned do not overlook the eco'
nomic and export advantages to be
gained by having their contractors
employed overseas.
“I submit this thought in the hope
that the point may not entirely escape
those in authority in this country and
that something will be done to allow
us to compete in world markets under
conditions no less favourable than
those enjoyed by our foreign competi'
tors.”
[Mr. Taylor’s thought could also
be submitted to Australia with advam
tage to Australia.}
The Taylor Woodrow Group, ah
ready working in five continents, had
expanded this recently to Canada and
Iraq.

THE MODERN HOME IS A GAS HOME

COOKING . . . Only gas gives you such even heat at
low cost—quickly controlled at the touch of a tap. Gas
ranges cost much less—are cooler, safer, last longer and
are more dependable. That is why more people in Sydney
cook with gas than any other fuel.
REFRIGERATION . . . Only gas gives you refrigerators
that last a lifetime. They have no motors or moving parts.
This makes them silent, wear free and repair free. Thermo-
static control gives the temperature you wish. Special

HOT WATER . . . Only gas gives you hot water all the

GAS COSTS LESS
Gas is the efficient, willing servant in 400,000 Sydney hemes. In Bathrooms, Lounges, Kitchens,
Laundries—and in every room where gas can be used—it does a better, cheaper job. Gas gives
you hot water all the time for your bath, shower, shave, dish washing, cleaning and clothes
washing. Gas warms your rooms, does all your cooking, and gives you perfect, trouble-free
refrigeration. The price of gas here is amongst the lowest in the world for manufactured gas.
Despite increased costs in all commodities, your gas company's modem planning and production
methods have kept the price down.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
Within the next few months, South
Australia may be producing cement at
almost double last year’s rate. Both
major companies have big expansion
programmes. By the end of the year
a combined output equal to 285,000
tons annually should be attained.
The present position is:—
• Adelaide Cement Co.; Production
is constantly increasing. Last year the
output was about 78,000 tons. This
year it is expected to reach 130,000
to 140,000 tons. The firm aims at a
gradual increase to the plant’s design-
ed capacity of 150,000 tons.
• S.A. Portland Cement Co.: The
second kiln at Angaston is scheduled
to go into production on June 30.
This will lift the firm’s output from
85,000 to 155,000 tons a year.
Meanwhile, the chronic cement
shortage which has hampered South
Australian industry since the war
shows little sign of easing just yet. A
big lag of orders has built up, particu-
larly in the country.
Premature announcements that the
position was improving led many
farmers to postpone collecting cement
orders until after the harvest. Now
they are coming in to collect the mate-
rial, and in many cases it is not avail-
able.
A spokesman for the S.A. Portland
Cement Co. has predicted that the
end of the shortage is in sight, but
most are sceptical. Similar announce-
ments in the past have failed to herald
any improvement in the position. The
spokesman said that when his firm’s
new kiln at Angaston was in opera-
tion the combined capacity of both
companies would supply the market,
though it would take some months to
satisfy outstanding orders. If required,
his firm had ample room for more
expansion at Angaston, he said.
Latest casualty from high building
costs is the <£45,000 Hotel Seaton on
Tapleys Hill Road. Work was origin-
ally intended to start by February, but
on present indications tenders will not
be called until at least July. The
prospect of an outlay well above
original estimates is worrying the com-
pany, Hotel Seaton Ltd. The board
has been allowed four vears to build
and is holding off in the hope that
prices will fall. The architects, Lucas
and Parker, completed plans long ago.
Mr. N. W. Smith, Secretary and Direc-
tor of Hotel Seaton Ltd., emphasises
that the delay is only temporary and
the project will still be completed well
within the allotted time. The com-
pany was registered late last year to
build on a site almost opposite the
Royal Adelaide Golf Club links. The
design provides for public and saloon
bars, bottle department, lounge and
dining'room, beer garden and car park.
The hotel will be two'Storeyed, in'
eluding 12 bedrooms, six with toilet
accommodation and six with hot and
cold basins. It will be one of South
Australia’s most important hotel'
building jobs since the war.
A variety of problems are harass-
ing Adelaide’s big building schemes.
Several major city projects, scheduled
to start early this year, have been de-
layed. Among the most striking ex-
amples are:—
® Brougham House, a proposed 70-
flat building in North Adelaide.
Months ago the directors of Brougham
House Ltd. were saying that a con-
struction announcement would come
“any day now.” Nearly six months
have passed and the directors still
have not fixed a date.
• Elizabeth House, a six "storey
North Terrace block, planned to in'
elude 40 to 50 professional suites.
It was to have got under way late last
year or early in 1954, but again
nothing has been done. The hold-up
here was not confined to costs. The
company lost two or three months of
building time this year because of a
hitch in arrangements for structural
steelwork. This hitch has now been
ironed out and an announcement is
expected shortly.
• Plans for major city “sky'
scrapers” formulated by several in'
surance companies. High costs and
shortage of materials have caused de'
Jay after delay over a period of years,
and still no start has been made.
From these- grandiose schemes all
that has resulted so ar is a bundle of
plans. The future, however, seems

ANSWER
WHEN special problems arise about the type of surface and kind of
environment where "Alpaste” Paint can be used most effectively, the
advice of Aluminium Union Limited is freely available. The answers given
to questions will be based on our long experience as suppliers of "Alpaste”
and will be supported by the results of constant research in the Laboratory
and elsewhere.
To-day, many trades and industries are concerned with problems arising
from the damaging and deleterious effects of such agents as moisture, the
sun’s heat, corrosive fumes, sea water and rust. Sometimes these problems
are sharpened by reason of defects normally shielded from view, or where
the damaged surfaces are placed in inaccessible spots. For these, and similar
difficult conditions, the durability of "Alpaste” Pigmented Paint affords full
protection for long periods.
Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste” Paint
Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium, which, when mixed with
a suitable medium, "leaf” and form an opaque and durable metallic shield.
Moreover, "Alpaste’s” high reflectivity and low heat absorption charac-
teristics help to maintain a temperate interior wherever it is used externally.

brighter. Costs have dropped con'
siderably over the past 12 months and
are expected to fall further. If they
do, Adelaide may at last see its much'
heralded post'war building programme
get under way.
The first section of Adelaide’s new
£4,500,000 Queen Elizabeth Hospital
will be officially opened early in June.
When completed, the hospital will be
the most modern in Australia. Work
was inspected this month by the
Health Minister (Mr. McEwin) and
senior officials of the Health Depart'
ment and the Architect'in'Chief’s De'
partment. The first section —an eight'
storey brick, steel, and concrete build'
ing—will be used initially to house 50
nurses and 55 patients. It will be'
come a nurses’ home—with a capacity
of 150 —when the main structure is
completed. Other sections of the hos'
pital are also going up. A clinic for
the welfare and guidance of expectant
mothers and babies is nearing com'
pletion. The boiler house will not
be ready for at least two years. Ad'
vantages claimed for the hospital in'
elude elimination of noise, telephones
for the patients, and a special nursery
for premature babies.
Other modern services comprise
central heating, hot and cold
sterile water, steam autoclaves, air'
conditioning to theatres, medical
gases piped to theatres and showless
lights, a nurses’ call system, silent
paging system, and mechanical venti'
lation for sterilizing rooms. Ultimate
capacity will be 400 patients. The
site for the project is at Woodville,
close to Woodville Road.
Autumn rains have disclosed fur'
ther earthquake damage in the suburbs.
The total cost to Adelaide is now
estimated at more than £3,000,000.
Insecure clay sub'soils have moved
after the recent heavy showers, dis'
closing new cracks in walls and foun'
dations. Insurance companies, which
already face a record pay'out, have
been rushed with dozens of late claims.
Building contractors are working over'
time to cope with the mass of earth'
quake jobs. The Secretary of the
Builders and Contractors’ Association
(Mr. B. O. Galloway) says preference
is being given to homes where occu'
pants are in danger from unsafe walls
or chimneys.
One body to gain from the earth'
quake has been the Timber Develop'
ment Association. Timber houses suf-
fered far less than brick or any other
construction and the Association’s
State Director of Development (Mr.
R. F. Spencer) has used this to illus'
trate his arguments in favour of tim'
ber dwellings. Ffe is also using the
chronic brick shortage and the scar'
city of skilled bricklayers to drive
home his point. However, many
suburban councils are still adamant in
banning timber homes from wide and
sharply defined areas.
The South Australian Housing
Trust has completed its 20,000 th
house. It was inspected on April 28
by the Premier (Mr. Playford). Also
present were the Trust’s first Chair'
man, architect and builder. The first
Chairman was Sir William Goodman,
the architect Mr. H. H. Cowell, and
the builder Mr. E. F. Marshall. Mr.
Marshall is still building Trust homes
and the 20,000 th —-a six-roomed rental
type dwelling in the new Northfield
Estate—is one of the many he has
built. The Housing Trust began
building in 1937 and completed its
10,000 th house in 1951.
Meanwhile, Housing Trust designs
are again under fire—this time from

meeting this month decided to protest
to the Premier and the Trust Chair-
man about the erection of undersized
“hutches” along Henley Beach Road,
Underdale. These dwellings had bed-
rooms measuring only seven feet by
seven feet four inches, councillors
were told.
The Mayor of West Torrens (Mr.
C. R. J. Veale) said: “I have heard
that some people let their hobbies in-
terfere with their business. Whoever
drew these plans must keep rabbits
and have had rabbit hutches in mind.”
A new type of locally-made port-
able internal walling will come on the
market during May. It has been de-
veloped by Adelaide architect H. W.
Sharp, and should be useful in the
“open plan” type of house. The
material from which the walling is
made is still “top secret,” but Mr.
Sharp says it can be easily sawed,
erected, or dismantled and stored in
a garage or storeroom, taking up little
space. The partitions are composed
of sections, four feet by nine, fitted
together in the normal tongue and
groove manner. The partition can be
painted to match existing walls. When
it is fixed in place, complete insula-
tion and sound proofing is possible.
Mr. Sharp says the new walling mate-
rial will sell at about £5 a section —
roughly, the same as other types of
internal walling. The new material,
he claims, can be used in homes, and
also in the division of offices or flats,
or as an inexpensive way to make
dressing rooms for club houses and
theatres.
Civic leaders have revived the plan
of establishing a pleasure resort on
Torrens Island, at the mouth of the
Port River. The project was mooted
in 1951 by Professor W. G. Holford,
who occupied the Chair of Town
Planning at University College, Lon'
don. He said the island could be de'
veloped to a degree which would make
New York’s Coney Island seem tawdry
by comparison. Civic and town plan'
ning authorities this month agreed
that the idea was a good one. How-
ever, it will have to be delayed several
years. The State is facing a heavy
programme of housing and other es-
sential works. In addition, the quaran-
tine station will have to be moved
from the island to avoid danger of
smallpox and other diseases. The
President of the S.A. Division of the
Australian Planning Institute (Mr. W.
C. D. Veale) said the project would
have to wait, due to high develop-
ment costs. Other long-range plans
to improve Adelaide’s recreation facili-
ties include a 160-acre “peoples’ play-
ground” near Outer Harbour.
The Commonwealth Department of
Works has let another big P.M.G.
contract. It is for a communications
building at Nuriootpa similar to
those under construction at Berri and
Balaklava. Work has started and will
take about eight months. The struc-
ture will be two-storey, of reinforced
concrete brick with concrete floors and
roo. The contract, at £28,373, went
to Norwood builder J. Meiers.
Hansen and Yuncken have the con'
tract to erect their second grandstand
in six months. The new job is at
Richmond Oval and building is
scheduled to cost about £BOOO. The
stand will be concrete brick, with con'
Crete seating. Foundation work has
begun. The architects are Caradoc
Ashton, Fisher. Woodhead and Beau'
mont Smith. Hansen and Yuncken
are also erecting the concrete-framed
stand on Norwood Oval. This wi’l
seat 1300 and should cost about
£20,000. Work is well advanced.
Milne, Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis are
the architects.

later, and will be let almost entirely
as professional and business offices.
Architects for the project are Russell
and Yelland. Work is expected to
start shortly.
The Premier (Mr. Playford) this
month unveiled the foundation-stone
of the King’s College War Memorial
pavilion. The £lO,OOO structure is
being built in pressed cement brick.
It will include a grandstand with seat'
ing capacity for 250, a gymnasium,
and changing-rooms. The architect is
M, K. Golding. Flansen and Yuncken
are the contractors.
The South Austrailan Small Homes
Service now provides a colour consul'
tant for intending home-builders. The
expert is available for about an hour
a day and advises on paints, painting,
choice of colour, and interior decora-
tion. The acting director of the Small
Homes Service (Mr. D. E. Thompson)
says the service will expand a:, de-
mand grows. For the future, he en-
visages a central bureau where advice
may be obtained on all problems like-
ly to arise when building,

Fifty are men.
The Psychology of Doorsteps
A Dignified Approach for Capitol, Library or Parliamentary Building,
But Fatal for Shops.
It has become a sine qua non in
the minds of people with an adult
psychological understanding, gained
by personal observation, rather than
from a study of textbooks on psycho'
logy, that the raised doorstep at the
entrance to city business houses —re'
tail business houses in particular—
can be not only a distinct diverter of
trade, but a source of danger. With
one’s mind so full of problems, as is
the case these days, it is too much to
require potential customers to direct
their attention to their feet, and to
look in front, to face pedestrian traf'
fic at the same time. The danger to
those people who wear bi'focal spec'
tacles adds to the general risk.
The stumbling over a doorstep on
leaving a crowded shop has cost many
of the shopkeepers the loss of cus'
tomers who, remembering their shock
or escape, have registered resolutions
to avoid such places in future. Quite
a number of shopkeepers have been
faced with actions for damages to one’s
person and/or clothing through door'
step accidents.
It is rarely that the kind of foot-
wear, partly responsible at times, is
considered when an accident occurs.
There was a case in which the shop
walker was called, and when he made
reference to the high'heeled shoes
madam was wearing, the reply was:
“Well, I bought them in this shop,
didn’t I?” There are business psycho'
legists who can state, pretty definitely,
the percentage loss of customers sus'
tained by shops according to the
height of the doorstep. In a recently
expensively reconstructed retail shop
in Brisbane, the entrance doorstep was
7in. above the pavement. In this in'
stance, as in many others, a ramp
would have met the needs without the
loss of many potential customers.
Another case could be quoted where
the height of the first floor above a
basement had to be retained because
municipal pipes below the basement
floor could not be disturbed; and
though the slope of the ramp was
considerable, it offers no obstruction
such as a doorstep six inches high
would constitute.
One can notice in the main shop'
ping streets a lessening number of
these offending steps, but there are
still far too many.
From the traders’ point of view, the
toleration of a door entrance one inch
or more above the footpath level is
bad business. From the public stand'
point, in the interest of safety, no
building regulations should permit the
obstruction.
—F. O. NIXON.

AIR WICK SOIL STABILISER DRILL.
To drain and stabilise a river bottom in Marion, Illinois, U.S.A., 24-inch auger holes
were drilled 25ft. deep and 25ft. apart with an auger supplied with air at 100 lb.
per sq. inch. This method has been found most suitable where drilling is necessary
through sticky, mucky soils.

British Building
President Galls for
Increased Output
Should Be Increased by 15%.
A call for an increase of 15 per
cent, in building productivity this vear
was made bv Mr. R. S. Williams,
president of the London Master Build'
ers’ Association in a recent address to
members.
“Last year,” Mr. Williams said, “our
productivity figure went up by 5 per
cent. That simply is not good enough
when you think of all the aids to pro'
duction we are now enjoying in the
shape of greater mechanisation, more
use of prefabricated components,
better supplies of materials, more de-
tailed planning before work on the
site begins and the wider application
of incentives, and bv that I mean not
money incentives alone.
“That is why I think a 5 per cent,
increase is a very disappointing figure.
“Some may think that I am setting
my sights too high, but I maintain
that if we bring our efficiency up to
concert pitch there is no reason why,
with the co'operation of the opera'
tives, we should not increase pro'
ductivity by 15 per cent, this year.
“Of course it will take some doing,
but with tact and understanding, with
determination and courage, with dis'
cipline and self'discipline, I am satis'
fied that it can be done.
“The opportunities before us are a
challenge to every section of the build'
ine industry, for there is work avail'
able for us all, big and small firms
alike. It therefore behoves us all to
take stock of the position, remember'
ing all the time that building methods
are changing and that the arrival of
new materials and new processes de'
mand that we keep our organisations
abreast of the times.
No Longer Craft Industry.
“We are no longer solely a craft
industry: we are becoming increasing'
ly an assembly industry in addition.
That calls for a fresh outlook on much
of our work, for initiative, for enter'
prise, for that spirit of adventure
which all good builders possess in rich
measure.”
TEXTILE IMPORTS.
In the first eight months of the
present financial year textile and ap'
parel imports into Australia were valu'
ed at £48,225,000, an increase of
£32,000,000 over £16,000,000 for the
same period last year.
HOUSING PROGRESS
IN NEW ZEALAND.
Overall Improvement.
The New Zealand Minister for
Housing, Mr. W. Sullivan, recently
told a conference of the National
Housing Council that statistics showed
there had been an improvement in the
overall position. It was estimated that
a record total of 16,600 houses would
be completed in the year ending
March 31.
Mr. Sullivan recalled that last year
the Council had agreed that the de'
:ired building rate of 20,600 houses
a year for ten years could not be
achieved on a year'bv-year basis.
However, some 17,000 houses could
probably be completed in the current
/ear, with a subsequent increase in
the rate until it reached 25,000 houses
at the end of the ten-year period.
An increase was reported in
Government house ' building activity,
and Mr. Sullivan said that there was
every indication that this year would
see 3500 houses built by the State,
an increase of some 820 houses over
last year.

New Method— And
“Old” Material
Most military commanders have one
common nightmare when a campaign
is raging. It is that of the enemy
breaching their front and pouring suf-
ficient numbers through the gap to
fan out and assault the line either side
of the breach from behind. The suc-
cess of this attack-from-the-rear strat-
egy was clearly demonstrated by the
sea when it shattered England’s East
Coast defences last year. Many sea
walls were demolished not because
they were swept away by a frontal at-
tack, but because the sea poured over
their summits to surge back and eat
away their rear supports.
Rebuilding these walls has been
planned with an eye to preventing
such a coup by the sea in future.
Even if it succeeds, through some
combination of strong wind and high
tide, in flowing over the top of the
sea walls, it will find them impervious
to a rear assault. And as part of this
strengthening of the new walls, a ma-
terial has been employed that is among
the very first raw materials used by
man —bitumen.
Bitumen—a derivative of petroleum
—was found in the form of seepage
deposits by the earliest civilisations of
the Middle East thousands of years
before Christ. It had been converted
from its original form of crude oil to
bitumen by centuries of weathering
from sun, wind, and rain. In the
year 1,400 B.C. a wall very similar to
a new sea defence now being complet-
ed in England was built to keep the
flood waters of the Tigris in check—
with bitumen then, as now, forming
one of the main construction materials.
Holland —a country especially con-
cerned with preventing flooding by the
sea —is making extensive use of bitu-
men in constructing her new defence
dykes. The only snag to bitumen—
entirely an aesthetic one —is that its
black surface has a less artistic appear-
ance than some more brightly coloured*
finish. So the Dutch have experiment-
ed with splashing sea-shells on to the
bitumen to give it a “pebble-dash”
semblance, while in Lincolnshire, Eng-
land, the inner face of the wall is be-
ing finished in cement and limestone.
The engineers erecting these ram-
parts are not, of course, scooping up
their bitumen from some handy seep-
age pool . . . they are obtaining it
from oil refineries. It is confidently
thought that this particular product
of the oil men will give sea walls a
strength and durability that will en-
able them to withstand any onslaught
the sea can mount against them. This
would mean that wholesale collapse of
such vital defences would never again
help betray the coastal belts of low-
lying land to the ravages of the waves
—and that those who dwell virtually
in the shadow of the sea-walls will
sleep more easily when storms are run-
ning high.
Australia Behind On
Timber Preservation
Failure to apply preservatives, or
their incorrect or insufficient use, is
keeping up the cost of timber at a
time when its use is becoming in'
creasingly popular, according to Mr.
S. W. Preston, Chief of Applications
Research Department, of Timbrol
Limited.
“More serious, it is causing a heavy
drain on the country’s forestry re'
sources,” he says.
“Australia has a diminishing sup-
ply of timber in her forests, America
almost unlimited supplies, but in com'
parison the average American uses
two'thirds more wood preservatives
than the average Australian.”
The thousands who use commer-
cially cut timbers can render a national
service in the conservation of our re-
sources by adopting careful methods
and the latest preservative practices,
he said.
For example, the householder or
farmer can treble the life of his fences
by a proper application of preserva-
tive at the time they are put up—and
if normal fences are given a simple
brush treatment their life is increased
considerably. All timber used in open
construction work should be preserved.
“Federal and State Forestry autho-
rities are constantly at work on af-
forestation, re-afforestation and the
protection of existing forests against
such dangers as fire and insect attack,”
he said.
“Our present shortage is due to a
natural shortage of timber-growing
land and careless exploitation in the
early days of the country’s develop-
ment.
“Consequently, wood preservatives
—water soluble mixtures, oil soluble
mixtures and the coal tar distillate
creosote —are becoming more and
more important.
“Their correct use will ease the de-
mand for replacement timber and al-
low the growing timber in our forests
more time to mature. This mature
timber will be better in quality, more
pest resistant and longer lasting.”
Softwoods Replacing Hardwoods.
Mr. Preston said such hardwoods
as iron bark and turpentine, used for
railway sleepers, telegraph poles,
bridge girders and harbour installa-
tions, were diminishing rapidly.
Research has revealed that softwoods,
not previously considered efficient in
the circumstances, can now be used
successfully instead of hardwoods in
many cases when treated with creo-
sote under pressure.
“In Australia there are two such

£500,000 MELBOURNE FLATS COMPLETED
78 SELF-OWNED FLATS.
Sheridan Close, a huge block of flat units recently completed in St. Kilda Road.
Melbourne, was launched in 1951 when the self-ownership principle was the only
answer to the problem created by inflated building costs which prevented an econ-
omic return on investment in flats for rent. All the 78 self-owned flats were taken
up immediately the project was announced. The cost of the flats to the original
owners ranged from £4000 to £7500, according to size and position. Sheridan
Close stands on a 200 ft. frontage on the east side of St. Kilda Road, just beyond
Toorak Road, and extends some 300 ft. back to the edge of Fawkner Park and has
thus two frontages In one of the most valuable areas just outside the city. The
three-storeyed building of coloured Glen Iris oatmeal bricks is built in echelon
design on the north and south elevations, thus giving every flat a view of St.
Kilda Rd. Cr. Bernard Evans, who was a pioneer in Melbourne of this class of
building, was the architect for the project. The builders were Prentice Builders

“These plants force the creosote into

used on a commercial scale, but
neither of these is suitable for large'
scale continuous treatment operations.

UNESCO PARIS HEADQUARTERS
World-Wide Tenders Called
Tenders are being called in all
countries for erection of Unesco head'
quarters in Paris.
The building which has a top limit
price of $6,000,000 for construction,
plus another $1,080,000 for equip'
ment and material to have the build'
ing ready to occupy.
The design was selected by a panel
of five under the chairmanship of
Professor Walter Gropius, who was
recently in Australia.
Professor Gropius, in his remarks
on the design of the building, said
that imaginative town planning and
a balanced architectural design had
provided a solution which not only
met the requirements of Unesco but
was also a worthy expression of mod'
ern architecture. It has been pos'
sible to combine in the project all
the conditions calculated to ensure the
smooth running of Unesco.
“Such an achievement, both from
the point of view of architecture and
of town planning, is due also to the
brilliant solution provided by the ar'
rangement of the secretarial and con'
ference buildings. This remarkable
concept in reinforced concrete com'
bines efficiency with beauty.”
The design is by Breuer, Nervi and
Zehrfuss.
HOLLOW PRESTRESSED
CONCRETE PILE.
To solve some of the problems pre'
sented in the handling of large con'
crete units. Stent Precast Concrete
Ltd. have developed a hollow pre'
stressed concrete pile of precast units
sft. long with a 16in. square section
and a 12in. diameter cavity.
Piles made to this design can be
made longer for the same weight.
The section modules is almost double
that of a s6lid pile and less steel is
required. The greatly reduced tension
permits a considerable increase in
working load.
The sectional pile, being lighter, is
flexible and economical, easier to
handle and cheaper to transport.
The cost per ton working load of
hollow pile ex'works is 15% below
the solid pile.

Works Review.”
Assembly Line
Methods Erect
Factory Quickly
Eight men and a crane were all that
were needed to erect a 64,000 sq. ft.
reinforced'concrete factory at the rate
of 10,000 sq. ft. per day in Houston,
Texas. A continuous flow of columns,
girders and roof'deck channels from
a precasting plant five miles awav was
fed to the crane —operating right on
the floor slab where trucks delivered
the structural elements.
The building, with a wire-reinforced
concrete slab on the ground, is made
of lightweight expanded ' shale con'
crete. Aside from the cast'in'place
floor slab, only the tilt'up wall panels
and pilasters for the factory were cast
at the site.
Girders were the only prestressed
members in the building. A method,
under licence of BBR (Zurich, Swit'
zerland) and new in the U.S., anchor'
ed the prestressing wires.
At the precasting plant, structural
elements were cast and stored in the
order in which they would be needed
for the continuous erection of the
factory. Trucks picked up the units —
assorted in sequence of erection —and
delivered them to the building site at
a predetermined rate.

Stamped Steel Baths
To Be Made In Australia
“It is announced that in conjunction
with Mytton’s Limited, General In'
dustries Limited through its subsidi'
aries. Metiers Limited and Metiers
K.F.B. Pty. Limited, will shortly be
producing stamped steel baths. The
product will be marketed in all
States.
The baths will be of heavy gauge
steel, and will be drawn in one piece
by the latest world'approved methods.
The finish will be in acid resisting
enamel in white or colour.
The advent of these baths will place
Australia in a similar position to
U.S.A. In that country stamped
steel baths of a similar high quality
form a substantial portion of the Sanb
tary Ware trade.”
To further extend its chain of fun'
eral homes in Sydney and suburbs, the
Metropolitan Funeral and Cremation
Society proposes to erect Sydney’s
most modern Funeral Home in Banks'
town.
Architects for the building are Louis
P. Burns and T. M. Maloney.
The Colonial'type structure will be
built of brick with tiled roof, and will
contain two separate chapels, one be'
ing on each side of the building, to
enable two services to be conducted
at the same time.
The downstairs portion of the Fun'
cral Home will contain showrooms,
administrative offices, viewing-rooms,
mortuary, and all the amenities neces'
sary for a building of this type.
The manager’s flat will be on the
second floor, and will be fully self'
contained.

The English Scottish and Australian
Bank Ltd. is erecting a number of
new branch buildings in Melbourne
suburbs in the contemporary style of
chitecture.
The new branch at Hampton, which
ias just been completed, is an
xample.
A notable feature of the facade is
he vertical louvre fins protecting the
glass wall of the first floor staff
amenities block from the fierceness of
the western sun. The result is also
a soft restful lighting to the area.
The wide overhang of the first floor
over the entrance gives protection from
the westerly weather and provides an
inviting entrance to the bank itself.
Open planning has provided ample
natural light to the whole of the
working section of the bank.
A new system of floor and roof
construction has been used. It con'
sists of precast reinforced concrete
beams and precast foam concrete
blocks, requiring no ceiling treatment
and providing heat insulation to
inches of cork.
Other banks are also busy building
new premises in the developing outer
suburbs, and the new industrial
districts.
Meldrum and Noad have called
tenders for a new building for the
National Bank of Australasia Ltd. in
Nepean Highway, Moorabbin.
Butler and Hall have advertised for
bids for a new branch building for
the Bank of New South Wales at
Portland.
Several suburban branches of the
Returned Servicemen’s League have
building schemes under discussion. The

The Housing Commission has let a
contract to Hansen and Yuncken for
<£78,849 for the erection of nine blocks
of two'storey flats, containing 36
units, at Heidelberg.
The Melbourne City Council is
considering the erection of an ameni'
ties block for women in the city on
much the same lines as that in Hyde
Park, near Elizabeth and Park streets,
Sydney.
The Presbyterian Church Assembly
has approved the purchase by St.
Leonard’s Girls’ School, Brighton, of
a property with 11 acres of land in
South Rd., Brighton. Mr. K. Murray
Forster is preparing plans for altera'
tions and additions to the existing
buildings. The project will cost more
than £lOO,OOO.
During the month the Lord Mayor,
Cr. R. H. Solly, officially opened the
new premises of the Fibrous Plaster
Manufacturers’ Association of Victoria
at 469'7l King St., near Dudley St.
Cr. Solby said the Association had
grown strong because its members
were united and loyal to each other.
If other branches of the building in'
dustry followed that course the in'
dustry as a whole would benefit.
Mr. E. Lovegrove, president of the
Fibrous Plaster Workers’ Union, com'
mended the association on its achieve'
ment. He added that cooperation
between employee and employer in
the fibrous plaster branch of the indus'
try was the main reason for the
strength and unity of the union.
Others could well follow the example
of the Association.
The State Government has let con'
tracts for light timber frame buildings,
as additions to six mental hospitals
throughout the State, for a total of
£145,263. Two largest contracts were

the south side of the present building.
Alterations are to be made to the
existing building to comply with the
requirements of the Licensing Act,
following the granting of a hotel

Dandenong for James McEwan and
Co. Pty. Ltd.
Mr. Chris A. Cowper, welhknown
architect, who died recently, left a
bequest of £BOOO to the Church of
England, Macedon, for the ultimate
replacement of the present timber
church with one of stone.
The growth of Dandenong with
its many new industries, and Housing
Commission and other housing, has
made it necessary for plans to be pre'
pared for extensive additions to the
local hospital. Tenders will shortly be
called .
The Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works have decided that it
will call tepders for the erection of
a seven'Storey office building at the
rear of its main building in Spencer
Street.
The Melbourne City Council is to
consider the rebuilding of the Meat
Market section of the Victorian
Market.
The Stare Government has am
nounced that it intends reconstituting
the Housing Commission. Trades
Hall circles are also pressing for the
abolition of the Housing Commission
Architectural Panel. It is debated
whether the present 2% fee of the
panel would not be less costly to the
Commission than the establishment of
a staff of architects and draftsmen.
In an endeavour to get down to a
low cost single dwelling for the Com'
mission, so that a lower rent could be
charged, the panel planned an
square house with three bedrooms and
combined living room'kitchen. Seve'
ral of these houses are under construe'
tion in the Pascoe Vale housing area.
They are timber framed, with external
■walls covered with asbestos cement
sheeting above sill height. Building
Unions have “dubbed” these houses
as “substandard” and demanded that
no more be built. The Commission
replied that they compiled with
form building regulations and would
meet the need of a section of the
people.
The effect of material shortages and
delays in deliveries of materials was
discussed recently by Mr. Harold
Bartlett, chairman of the Housing
Commission Architects’ Panel.
Mr. Bartlet estimated that the cost
of home building could be reduced by
30% if builders could be assured of
materials when required. He said
that builders today had to load their
tenders for building work to cover lost
time caused by uncertainty of deliver'
ies. He pointed out that if they were
lucky with a flow of materials a big
profit resulted.

work in Victoria in recent months has
been the shortage of water pipe.
The Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works engineering depart'
ment has a big programme of works
before it. Developing outer areas are
demanding more water —for both
homes and factories—and long over'
due sewerage mains are required. A
20mile pipe line to improve water
supply in the Altona and Sunshine
area has been authorised at a cost of
£250,000 .
The City of Heidelberg has decided
to erect at Fairfield a building con'
taining rate receiving office, library
and club rooms. The Town Hall is
at Ivanhoe ,
The Little Theatre Guild Ltd., which
has been using a small building in
Martin St., South Yarra, as a theatre
for some time, has decided to purchase
the property. A larger theatre will
be built on the site.
The Health Commission has had its
officials look over several of the city
theatres with the result that owners are
being called on to make alterations
to comply with regulations. During
the control period the Commission
did not press for this work to be
done but now old orders are being
revived and enforced. The first

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
By F. O. NIXON
As the City proper, of Brisbane
expands, the need for more land on
which to erect new Governmental
buildings increases. The noise which
afflicts the trials in the Supreme Court
has been given as a reason for its
removal, at some distant date, to a
quieter part of the City. These distrac'
tions will be accentuated when Adelaide
Street is lengthened and the Supreme
Court house will have four sides ex'
posed to traffic, instead of three as at
present, the last one, in contemplation,
being nearer than the others to street
noises.
About two'thirds of a near'city
block facing Parliament House has
been purchased for £65,000 by the
State Government, and with some
flats and residential upon it facing
George and William Streets, the whole
should cost £70,000. There are no
tramlines in this area which is more
or less a dead'end at the Botanical
Gardens.
The last section of the State In'
surance Building, to occupy the
Edward Street'Ann Street corner,
held up for some years as a not in'
dispensable type of building during
the hectic rush to build dwellings, is
again under way, and when completed
will remove a lot of unsightly change
rooms, storerooms, etc., from a con'
spicuous position opposite the Central
Railway Station.
Nearly opposite the State Insurance
Building is the City Building block
which recently sold for £200,000.
The State Insurance Building is one
of many that have been retarded
through the short supply of steel. It
is expected to improve, as time
on with the assistance of transport,
and more settled conditions on the
various wharves. The Federal ship'
ping Minister has stated that 10,700
tons of steel for Queensland had been
accumulated at Port Kembla and of
which 4500 tons is on the way and the
remainder of 6200 is now loading.
With the exception of minor consign'
ments, these are the first appreciable
shipments to Brisbane within about
three months.

ASPHALT ON FLAT ROOFS
Mr. Oliver S. Chesterton, M.C., F.R.1.C.5., in a paper given at a general meeting
of Quantity Surveyors at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in London
on October 21st, 1953, said, under “Roofs”: —
“I have more than once been disappointed with the lasting qualities of
asphalt in large flat roofs ... it is tempting, when trying to keep down
the cost of a job, to employ an asphalting firm of no great reputation,
because they have quoted a highly competitive price . . . therefore, I
plead with Quantity Surveyors to make certain that asphalt roofing is
carried out by a first-class firm.”
Neuchatel Standardised Mastic Asphalt
for Roofing
® is manufactured to British Standard Specification in modern
agitated cookers and all the processes of manufacture are under the supervision
of an experienced industrial chemist;
• is delivered to the job in hexagonal blocks, branded with the name “Neuchatel”
and bearing the distinguishing letter “R” —to indicate that the material has
been manufactured to the British Standard Roofing Specification. These blocks
are re-melted and used on the job without addition or alteration;
• is laid by skilled and experienced craftsmen in accordance with the British
Standard Code of Practice.
Fifty years of experience, full technical information, first-class workmanship and
expert supervision go with Neuchatel Standardised Mastic Asphalt quality for

on the opposite side to the Central
Railway Station and facing Wickham
Terrace on its Western side, is being
considered as a suitable place for a
five-storied car parking centre, from
which cars can be driven to and from
any one of the floors to the sloping
frontage of Edward Street. The area
visualised, could accommodate about
600 motor cars. The suggested aliena-
tion of city park lands for motor park-
ing has, rightly, met with great
opposition.
With the creation of Greater Bris-
bane, several town halls and shire halls
were absorbed, and included in these,
was the very ornate town hall of
South Brisbane. In recent years it
has housed some profesional officers
of the Brisbane City Council, and now
it is proposed to turn it into Brisbane’s
first Conservatorium of Music, soon
after it is vacated by present tenants
on July 31st. The Government has
agreed to purchase the building from
the Brisbane City Council for the sum
of £40,000. The building is close to
train and tram lines in Vulture Street,
and being on high ground, overlooks
the domain reach on the opposite side
of the Brisbane River.
The proposed new bridge to relieve
the Victoria Bridge, built after the
1893 floods, and to be built between
that structure and the Grey Street
Bridge, is estimated to cost £2,000,000,
and may be completed by 1960 if the
plans submitted to the Metropolitan
Works Board are acceptable to that
Board, and subsequently, by the Bris-
bane City Council.
Lennon’s Hotel, George Street, will
soon have completed at a cost of
£30,000, the usable part of a fifth
floor. The nine “luxury type’’ rooms
now ready are part of 46 rooms, of
which the company is to ask the
Licensing Commission, and the Bris-
bane City Council, to give their ap-
proval. These nine rooms with
showers and toilet rooms have acoustic-
covered ceilings. If and when the
fifth floor is completed, Lennon’s
Hotel will be able to add appreciably
to the number of 300 guests if now
accommodates in luxury.
With the Byronic line “Man’s con-
trol stops with the shore”ringing in
one’s ears, the apprehension grows that
our delightful beach lands from
Southport to the Tweed River, may

its restfulness to become just another
restless city reclaimed from the

mineral beach sands, are not altogether
sacrosanct. The latest addition to the
prominent buildings envisaged for
Southport, The United Services
Building, estimated to cost more than
£60,000, is to be a Memorial Centre
of two stories, in which are a hall to
seat 650 people, a stage of modern
size to accommodate a State Symphony
orchestra, and club rooms and recrea-
tion amenities for the R.S.L. The
furnishings, costing £lO,OOO, are in-
cluded. The Governor has laid the
foundation stone, and building is to
begin in three months’ time. Another
project just opened was the £6OOO
swimming pool at St. Hilda’s Girls’
Grammar School.
The garden city of the Darling
Downs—Toowoomba—with its popu-
lation now past 40,000, is turning its
attention to an augmented water
supply, to relieve the demand on the
present dam at Cooby Creek. Not
many years ago, this city depended
upon underground supplies of water
from wells. The suggestion of im-
pounding the water flow of Cooby
Creek, 19 miles from Toowoomba,
was ridiculed for many years, by the
types who criticise any new project
of another’s brain; but despite this,
the dam was built with great success.
Now, with the growth of population,
a larger scheme which would cost a
million pounds is contemplated at
Perseverance Creek, 8 miles further
away. The scheme, if adopted, could
also supply the smaller town of
Crows Nest.
At a recent conference of the
Australian Clay Products Association
at Southport, it was stated, that the
value of bricks contained in a £5OOO
house would be not more than £BOO.
In a timber house of an equal number
of squares, the value of timber is esti-
mated at £550. The cost of labour—
builders, painters, plumbers, etc.,
comes prominently into the picture of
the present high cost of building.
Plywood.
For a timber industry that did not
begin until 1916 in Queensland, the
utilisation of 9,944,000 super feet of
log timber in the quarter ended in
December 31st, 1953, would produce
10 to 50 million square feet of 3/16-in.
basic plywood, is arresting. At the
same time, this quarterly production
constitutes an all-time record. During
the same period, the sawmills of
Queensland cut 120,258,000 super feet
of log timber, though this is not a
record of milling.
The transport Minister (Mr. Dug-
gan) said in a recent broadcast, that
the Main South Coast road from
Brisbane to the Border—l 9 miles past
Southport—had cost more than
£680,000 to build, and £16,000 per
annum to maintain. The 24 miles of
roadway from Brisbane to Ipswich had
cost £500,000 and carried upwards of
3500 vehicles a day; and ten million
pounds had been spent on the Coast
highway from Brisbane to Cooktown,
though the road making being carried
on progressively over the whole of
the long distance left much of it to
be made, before it could be regarded
as a complete highway.
Brisbane has had its third pre-
fabricated post office buildings of
aluminium alloy opened. The build-
ings of this metal, which cause appre-
hension in the minds of those who
know the heat of sub-tropical Queens-
land, are insulated against both heat
and cold, and were made by the
Bristol Manufacturing Coy. of Eng-
land. They are painted externally in
a shade of peach colour, and inter-
nally, of Arctic blue. Cost is said to
be about £16,000 each.
Drilling is now taking place to test
the foundations for th remaining sec-
tion of St. John’s Cathedral in Ann
Street, after which, tenders would be
called for construction of the founda-
tions. The foundation stone has been
laid for a new Convent School at
Indooroopilly to cost £23,000 in-
clusive of furnishing.
The Methodist Garden Settlement
for old people at Chermside. has be-
gun to build an addition of 28 single
rooms, and recreation rooms, esti-
mated to cost £49,000 out of bequests

The Transport Minister (Mr. J. E.
Duggan) has announced that a new
steel and concrete bridge, estimated to
cost £23,827, will be built over Goodna
Creek near Ipswich on the highway
from Brisbane to Toowoomba.
The number of building permits
given by the Brisbane City Council
during April was 688 —somewhat lower
than the preceding months. The
activity in building operations on the
South Coast, about 50 miles distant
from Brisbane, would tend to balance
this, particularly in respect of dwel*
lings. Over and above the types of
dwellings costing less than £3OOO,
there were 43 to cost above £3OOO up
to £8000; 26 of them costing between
£3OOO and £4000; 12 costing from
£4OOO to £5000; 2 at £6OOO, and one
each costing £7OOO, £7500 and
£BOOO.
One hotel at a bayside suburb will
cost £45,000 and additions to another
at the same place will cost £5OOO. A
Convent is costing £70,000; a Bank,
£9100; and an aged persons’ commun*
ity home £30,000 . The cost of altera-
tions and additions to eleven separate
business places, range from £3OOO to
£10,000; four more service stations
will cost £18,500 (the highest of the
individual costs being £7000). Of the
five new stores and factories included
in this survey, to cost £26,500 in all,
the highest of them is costing £lO,OOO.
These special enumerations of new
buildings costing upwards of £3OOO
each, number 68, or 10% of the total.
The remaining 90% will cost less
than £3OOO each.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
PROJECT
The linking up of Great Britain
with North America by telephone
has been inaugurated by the placing of
an initial order for two Transatlantic
telephone cables to be laid between
Oban (Scotland) and Newfoundland.
The order was placed by the British
Post Office with Submarine Cables
Ltd., a British firm owned by Siemens
Brothers & Co. Ltd., and the Tele-
graph Construction 6? Maintenance
Co.
The cable will be laid in 1955 by
the Post Office cable ship “Monarch.’’
The cable will cost approximately
£lOOO per nautical mile, and the
value of the contract will be in the
vicinity of £2 million.
The cable will provide the first of
the main links in a joint Anglo*
American'Canadian project for pro-
viding interferenceffree telephone
channels between the three countries.
Its effective use has been made pos'
sible by the development of sub'
merged repeaters (speech amplifiers),
which are laid with the cable on the
ocean bed. This will permit 36
transatlantic telephone conversations
simultaneously.
The Transatlantic portion will re-
quire approx. 2,000 nautical miles of
cable. From Newfoundland it will

with enough space for three glasses, or maybe six, to rest securely. The triangular
points of the table then turn upwards in graceful sweeps, protruding sufficiently to
ensnare any clumsy person's coat or dress in passing. The leaves of the übiquitous
Monstera Deliciosa lend themselves as an artistic foil or background. The measures
to which one will go in striving after new effects may also be seen on the right,
where five or six steps without risers are cantilevered out from the wall. For safety
they are lit from underneath so that no one will stub their toes. No handrail is
provided, but by using the wall with the flat of the hand (not always clean), as
a fly uses its feet for suction, one can feel quite sate when mounting or descending
the stairs. The heavily upholstered furniture on spindly legs provides "the curve
of comfort tor the sitter, and one can feel as restful and happy in surroundings
such as these as one would in other modern rooms, once the absurdities have been
overcome.

to HYDE PARK WOMEN’S CENTRE
and CRECHE!
When the ladies get together, there's always plenty to talk about . . . but
under the quiet influence of this decorative sound-absorbent ceiing, there
could hardly ever be a discordant note!
Not even the vocal members of the new creche can mar the restful atmos-
phere, for here, too, Insulwool PERFOTILE has been used to effectively
"blanket" any excessive noise.
Could there be a better recommendation tor our product?

THE ILLUMINATING
ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
Summer Meeting at Southport,
England.
Important Papers Presented.
The Illuminating Engineering
Society held its Summer Meeting at
Southport, England, from May Ist to
21st, 1954. Paper presented included:
“Lamps and Their Uses,” by Dr.
J. N. Aldington, Managing Director
of Siemens Electric Lamps and Sup'
plies Ltd.
“Street Lighting in a London
Suburb,” by Mr. A. T. Durbridge,
District Manager of the Harrow Dis'
trict, Eastern Electricity Board.
“Lighting for Plant Growth,” by
Mr. A. E. Canham, of the Rural
Electrification Section of the British
Electrical and Allied Industries Re'
search Association.
Research on the effects of light on
the growth of plants has continued
over the last two centuries but it has
only been with the comparatively re'
cent development of high intensity artfi
ficial light sources that appreciable
progress has been made. The im'
portance of light as a factor in plant
growth is now fully appreciated but
many problems still remain to be
resolved.
“The Decorative Approach to Com'
mercial Lighting,” by Andre Claude.
Fluorescent light sources, by their
characteristics, said Mr. Claude, have
completely upset the classical lighting
technique previously in use and have
set new problems in the decorative
quality of commercial lighting instab
lations. No decorative lighting for
commercial purposes and no luminous
sign can be truly satisfactory unless
the scheme that is to be carried out
by the lighting engineer has in the
first place been conceived by an
artist purusing an aesthetic conception
regardless of the ultimate purpose of
the installation. Mr. Claude recom'
mended that fluorescent light sources
used in such installations should have
a predominantly red spectral emis'
sion. Also that incandescent sources
can be usefully combined with
fluorescent sources.
Where Soil Is More
Precious than Silver
Overseas observers covering the
Royal Tour of Australia tell us that
one of the things that has impressed
them most strongly has been the mag'
nificent pastureland and arable coum
try through which the Royal route has
passed—land typifying our rich pas'
toral economy. But behind the lush
green plains and golden grain prairies
lurks a menacing shadow. It is the
shadow of soil erosion.
This is no new evil, peculiar to this
modern age of mechanised farming
and intensive cultivation. On the con'
trary it helped bring arid desolation
to the one'time fertile fields that ring'
ed ancient Babylon. It was among
the factors responsible for turning the
granary of imperial Rome into the
Libyan Desert. It has, in fact, been
among farmers’ chief enemies ever
since man learned the art of tilling
the earth.
In Australia, soil erosion has been
intensified by several contributory fac'
tors. Indiscriminate burning'off of
scrubland (and stubble) as a quick
means of clearing ground for cultiva'
tion; too drastic felling in the timber

RECORD NUMBER OF ARCHI-
TECTURAL STUDENTS AT
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS
Prof. Turpin C. Bannister reports
that largest body of architectural
students in America and one of the
world’s largest is enrolled currently
at the University of Illinois. A total
of 856 undergraduates is enrolled in
five-year curriculum leading to
Bachelor of Architecture degree.
Australian aircraft - carrier “Mel-
bourne,” now being built in U.K., will
be completed and handed over late
next year.
Australia’s lovely Lyrebirds are
found near Warburton, Victoria. It
has a body no larger than a hen, but
a 30in. silvery-mauve spreading tail.
The bird is a born mimic, can imitate
over 20 different kinds of bird calls —
even some human sounds!
belts; over-stocking of pastures—even
the depredations of rabbits and other
herbivorous animals roaming the “Out-
back”—these are just some of the
causes. But in each case the net re-
suit has been the same: the destruc-
tion of the natural vegetation and
plant life whose roots lock the soil
together and whose foliage shelters
the topsoil from the wind and the
rain. Denied this strength and shelt-
er, the top-soil is swiftly dissipated by
the elements. The exposed sub-soil is
almost as swiftly scorched and crack-
ed into deep gullies—eventually wid-
ening into ravines. Even when farm-
ers have taken pains not to overstock
land or denude timber belts, they have
often inadvertently stimulated soil ero-
sion—by ploughing furrows on wrong
patterns, so that the furrows helped
the rain water to carry away the sur-
face loam. Thus, inexorably, erosion
encroached upon the land.
But today it is a different story.
Australia is fighting back vigorously
in defence of her fertile areas. Scien-
tific understanding of soil erosion, its
causes, and—just as vital—the counter-
measures needed to check it have been
united with the tremendous potential-
ities of oil-power, the mechanical sin-
ews with which to put the counter
measures into action. Squadrons of
giant ditching machines and bulldozers
are hard at work on planned drainage
projects—so that rain water is collect-
ed in reservoir ponds instead of flow-
ing promiscuously to waste across the
surface of the land. Thick, high,
earthen ramparts are being thrown up
by other machines along the perimet-
ers of arable land, so as to shelter the
loose top-soil from the full force of
the wind. On hundreds of holdings,
large and small, agricultural advisory
officers are helping farmers map out
new ploughing patterns—making sure
that the furrows work with, and not
against, the land.

Electronic Industries Limited, which
has announced that it will be in the
field manufacturing T.V. sets in Aus-
tralia, has instructed its architect, Mr.
Peter Spier, to call tenders for a
brick, steel and fibro'cement factory,
of 80,000 sq. ft. area, at East Oakleigh.
The tender of Thompson and
Chalmers Pty. Ltd. for £103,600 has
been accepted by A. C. Leith, Bartlett
and Partners for .the construction of
reinforced concrete extensions to the
hill terrace at Flemington racecourse.
The same architects have called
tenders for the erection of a large
club building at Swan Hill.
Competition among the petrol com'
panics has resulted in a big pro'
gramme of service station building in
recent months. Competition has
caused some very high prices to be
paid at auction for good corner posh

are few likely spots left. Common'
wealth Oil Refineries have just called
tenders for three more at Geelong,
Darebin and East Brighton. Consid'
erable sums have been expended in
the building of some of these stations.
Messrs. Johns and Waygood Limited
have written to say they appreciate
the interest shown by “Building,
Lighting, Engineering” in their build'
ings. They explain, however, that it
is correct to say their Sandringham
works are being extended, but their
property at City Road, South Mel'
bourne, has not been sold and will
continue to be used by them as one
of their Engineering Works, and as
their registered office. Large extensions
to this property are now being con'
structed.
Australia has not flinched from re'
cognising the gravity of the problem.
Rather has she accepted the challenge,
and is determined not only to prevent
soil erosion from further encroach'
ment, but also in time, to reclaim land
already fallen victim to this maladv.
We know that further intensification
of our food production programme is
vitally necessary if the demands of
growing populations, without as well

be met.
USE OF “SKY-HOOKS”
ON AMERICAN AIRCRAFT
HANGARS.
134ft. Steel Cantilevers.
Two aircraft hangars, 134 ft. by
420 ft., each with one side completely
free of supporting columns, was the
requirement put to the New York
Port Authority by Lockheed Aircraft
International. The Authority’s em
gineers solved the problem by the
use of steel trusses cantilevered out
134 ft. on either side of a central two'
storey office and workshop building.
The central section, carried on four
rows of columns, is topped by heavy
36in. horizontal beams with extern
sions cantilevered at an angle 18ft. to
each side, where they are pin-connect'
ed to the inside ends of the 115 ft. sus'
pended trusses. The suspension of
the trusses is by 85ft. ties from
columns projecting 44ft. above the
roof, loads being transmitted to the
ground through a system of ties and
compression members. The inner two
rows of columns to the central build'
ing thus act in tension, the outer rows
in compression. Movement in the
suspension system due to thermal ex'
pansion and wind pressure is provided
for up to a maximum of six inches.
Use of this system rather than of
steel bowstring trusses has provided a
10 per cent, cost saving. There was
a further appreciable saving from the
use of welding, although the original
design was for a riveted structure.

New School of
Architecture Opened
The new School of Architecture at
the New South Wales University of
Technology, Kensington, Sydney, was
officially opened on May 7th
by the Minister for Education, the
Hon. R. J. Heffron. It is located on
the top floor of the main block, fac-
ing Barker Street, and in spaciousness,
equipment and lighting, provides most
modern and commodious accommoda-
tion.
A large gathering of architects,
many of whom were former students
of the School of Architecture at the
Sydney Technical College, from which
the present degree course in Architec-
ture at the new University has evolv-
ed, were present, and were delighted
with the new School, and in humorous
vein contrasted it with the lack of
amenity and poor working conditions
with which they had had to contend
in former years.
Mr. Heffron, who is about to leave
for an extensive overseas tour to study
the latest trends in educations, outlin-
ed with humorous touches many of
the trials and tribulations which he
and the Council of the new Univers-
ity had gone through in order to ac-
quire the site, extend its area and erect
the necessary buildings during the dif'
ficult conditions that have obtained
over the past five years. He naturally
felt full of pleasure at the inaugura-
tion of this first School in the new
University.
[This was closely followed by the
opening yesterday of the Schools of
Chemistry and Metallurgy, although
these are at present housed in prefab-
ricated aluminium units.]
Mr. Heffron paid tribute to the Col-
lege Course which had been started in
Sussex Street in 1883 by the late J.
F. Hennessy, and under his successors,
Byera Hadley, Alex Martin and Henry
Pynor, had gained widespread recog-
nition and numbered amongst its Dip-
lomates many of the leading architects
in N.S.W.
The guests were officially received
by Professor S. W. Lucas, and shown
over the School by members of the
staff, after which a buffet meal was
served. A feature of the interior
treatment are the interesting colour
schemes, whilst the scientifically de-
signed furniture to provide working
comfort and a minimum of fatigue
during lectures and draughting were
of particular interest.
The University President, Mr. W.
C. Wurth, the Director, Professor ].
P. Baxter, and a number of members
of the Council were also present.
KEEPING FIT.
The science of keeping fit. Fifty
years ago the pioneers of psychology
debated eagerly on the question
whether we laugh because we are
happy, or we are happy because we
laugh. Like the “hen and the egg
priority” problem, both with a differ'
ence. This is something we can try
out by test. Psychologists of today
say—lf a grin makes merry, it needs
zeal to make the grin. By zeal our
feelings are schooled, action resulted,
enthusiasm is generated, mastery is
achieved. Health is the interplay of
feeling and doing. Therefore grin
and keep fit.
