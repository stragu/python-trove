STEEL SPEEDS
PROGRESS
TDEHIND most of the developments which make this land of
ours a better place in which to live and work, stand the
furnaces and mills of the steel industry, for steel is man’s most
versatile metal . . . the tool and material of progress.
Without iron and steel, the achievements of modern
industry, agriculture and transport would be virtually impossible.
Helping speed Australia’s development are the 23,500 men and
women of the B.H.P. organisation, supplying the nation with
iron and steel, and building for the future.
The industry’s steel-making capacity is being expanded by
more than one third, and new plant installed . . . more steel

EDITORIAL.
WELCOME TO OUR QUEEN
The thoughts of every Australian centred on Sydney Heads on Tuesday
morning, 3rd February, when Que-en Elizabeth 11. came to her Australian people for
the first time.
What emotions spring to the over-filled heart as one thinks of this beautiful
young girl Queen performing her royal functions with such matchless grace, dignity
and charm. All who behold her are thrilled by her beauty and touched by her
humanity.
We British people of the past few generations have been greatly blessed by
our Royal Family and our Sovereigns, who have long since passed from the despotic
monarch to the Father of his people, as George V. and George VI. became as they
spoke to us each year at Christmas, by the miracle of radio, “from their heart and
their home.”
In times of stress they are with their people and no one will ever forget how
George VI. and his Queen Elizabeth would not leave London as it burnt and crashed
during the blitz, but stuck it out with their fellow Londoners, and what seems
greater still for a mother and a father heart to bear their children stuck it out
with them.
We have all watched the little Princesses with pride and pleasure as they
grew up, guided as they were so ably by their Mother and Grandmother, until
Elizabeth, on the tragic death of the King, assumed the role for which she was
destined and so simply and sincerely dedicated her life to her people.
Last year the age-old ceremonial of the Coronation, with its deep religious
significance, was spiritually shared by millions within the British Commonwealth
and by many other peoples. EHzabeth presented herself to her people and the Crown
of England was laid upon her head.
And now Elizabeth- is amongst us as our Queen. What an inspiration she is!
How fortunate are we of the British race to have such leadership as we look
around the world and see less happy peoples striving to achieve stability; to have
someone to look up to. Above politics, race, class and creed, the Queen is our
greatest inspiration.
We, her Australian people, love her and revere her, admire her gallant
husband, the Duke, and look forward to watching their sweet little children, Charles
and Anne, grow up under their guidance and example as we did with the Queen
herself and her sister, Princess Margaret.
Thank God for our Queen.
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!

GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY'S SYDNEY HOME.
Over A Hundred Years Of History.
While in Sydney, Her Majesty,
Queen Elisabeth 11, and His Royal
Highness, The Duke of Edinburgh,
stayed at . Government House,
which surely possesses one of the
most delightful settings of any
such Vice-Regal residence in the
British Commonwealth.
Its history is of interest.
The first Government House
consisted of a canvas structure
with a pre - cut timber frame
brought from England by Gover-
nor Capt. Phillip at a cost of £125.
(Pre-fabrication is not a modern
invention.)
This was followed by the first
permanent residence built of stone
at the corner of Bridge and Phillip
Streets (now marked by a Royal
Australian Historical Society tab-
let) and was occupied on June
4th, 1789.
Pretentious Stables
Cause Outcry.
About 1810 it was considered
necessary to erect a more preten-
tious and commodious building,
the present site was selected, and
in 1817 a start was made on the
ambitious project by first erecting
the stables to serve the new resi-
dence. Unfortunately, the stables,
which are now the Conservatorium
of Music, were so large and pre-
tentious that the public, clamour-
ing for houses for themselves,
made such an outcry that it re-
sulted in the recall of Governor
Macquarie.
Move To Parramatta.
His successor, Governor Brisbane,
in view of the public resentment,
was afraid to do anything further
and made his official residence at
Parramatta. It is quite possible
that there it may have remained
had it not been for a tragic acci-
dent in which the wife of Governor
FiUroy was killed by bolting car-
riage horses and her grief-stricken
husband refused to remain there
any longer.
Competition For Design.
In 1827, the proposal to erect
an appropriate building for the
Governor’s residence was revived,
and competitive designs were call-
ed for with premiums of £5O, £3O
and £2O, and it is of interest to
note that the wife of Governor
Darling won third place in the
competition. In the meantime, tim-
ber had been cut to ensure that it
would be well-seasoned and stone
had been quarried in the Domain
near the site of the present Art
Gallery.
The competitive designs were,
however, eventually discarded (the
fate of so many architectural com-
petitions) , and the Home Govern-
ment took the matter in hand and
provided plans designed by a Mr.
Blore, “a prominent and skilfull
English architect, ’ for a building
which was to cost £15,000, though
on investigation in the Colony the
estimate was eventually increased
to £25,000, it being claimed that
lead and iron required in the build-
ing were entirely under-estimated
by the British officials; moreover,
labour ranged from 5/- to 10/- per
day ( not hour), the latter being
the wage of the stonemason.
Ideal Site Selected.
The site of the present Govern-
ment House was considered at the
time as ideal from many aspects,
one reason being that the new
structure would have the protec-
tion of the guns of Fort Macquarie.
Nevertheless, it can be said to this
day that no better site in Sydney
could have been obtained and
that no more appropriate building
could have been designed to suit
the admirable setting, with lovely
Farm Cove backed by the gently
rising grounds culminating in the
city silhouette.
The building was definitely com-
menced in 1837 and the work pro-
gressed until June 26, 1843, and
this date being the Anniversary of
Queen Victoria’s Accession, the
double function of loyal celebra-
tion and house-warming was car-
ried out concurrently.
Wages A Hundred
Tears Ago.
In passing, it is interesting to
note that at this early date works
were carried out and their costs
and details recorded with military
precision. Thus Mr. Mortimer
Lewis, as Colonial Architect,
superintended the erection of the
building, his salary being £4OO per
annum; under him was a foreman-
of-works receiving £l6O per an-
num, a clerk-of-works at £l2O per
annum, with a gate-keeper and
messenger receiving 2/6 and 1/9
per day respectively. But rations
seem to have been a most impor-
tant consideration in those early
days, for it is recorded that eight
mechanics and four watchmen re-
ceived only 9d. per day each, their
recompense being made up by
rations and clothing.
£lO,OOO was the amount at first
voted for the carrying on of the
work, from which it appears that
the original plans were only par-
tially to be carried out. Subse-
quent additions, particularly that
of the stately porte cochere, ex-
panded the building to its present
state.

The Decorations
Of Government House.
The strictly architectural
features of the building provide an
abundance of fine ornamentation,
but there have also been intro-
duced many fine additional decora-
tive features, and these are found
in stained glass windows, mantel-
pieces and overmantels. But there
is also a further system of decora-
tion which offers great historical
interest and that charm of wide
variety so essentially Gothic in
character—this is the introduction
of the family heraldry of succes-
sive Governors, all of whom have
been in some way or other interest-
ed in the building.
Governors' C oatS'of'Arms.
Although the home of the aris-
tocracy usually present, in some
form or another, the family coat-
of-arms, there are few buildings
anywhere which have been the
temporary home of so many dis-
tinguished families as the Vice
regal residences of the Britisli
Empire. The idea was a happy
one, for it introduces a sentiment,
a memory and a permanent record
of those past connections with men
who meant so much to the Empire
and to the Colony. Although the
coats-of-arms of all the Governors
do not appear, there are but few
omissions.
Governor Sir Richard Bourke,
who laid the foundation-stone, is
represented in a fine decorative
panel; but the other coats-of-arms
have been introduced wherever the
shape and design might harmonise
with the architecture, in spandrils
and panels, in fireplaces, and
when these failed to provide the
necessary space, the badge has
been worked in as a motif.
Studying these marvellous stone
records, one is struck by the won-
derful variety of subject, skill in
design, and execution in workman-
ship. These are nearly all artistic,
with forms which would seem
almost impossible to execute in
fragile stone; the mottoes which
the coats-of-arms carry are sugges-
tive of knightly courage, honesty,
enterprise, devotion and loyalty—
truly “sermons in stones.”

Continued from page 19.


A PROUD CITY
Sydney on Wednesday, February 3, 1954, was a proud city, as for
the first time her Sovereign set foot upon Australian soil.
The spectacle of the Royal Yacht “Gothic,” as it glided majestically
up the Harbour with the Queen and the Duke upon its upper bridge,
made an indelible impression upon the minds of the hundreds of thousands
of her fervent Australian subjects, and one which in the eyes of our
children will remain a living memory for at least three generations, and
proud history for evermore.
Nature, too, was benign, and a more perfect day could not have
been imagined. Sydney, always a beautiful city for her natural gifts
alone, did herself proud and, like a beautiful young woman, was bedecked
in her finest and gayest array. The decorations were first class and those
responsible deserve congratulation for a task performed with imagination
and efficiency. The rows of colourful street standards, the gay public
buildings and business premises, the various attractive arches and the
floodlighting all combined to create an unforgettable scene and one which
could not fail to have an impression upon the mind and heart of Her
Majesty, who sees our land for the first time.
It stirred the imagination to hear our Queen say in her reply to the
Lord Mayor’s address of welcome:
“Only 166 years ago the first settlement was made not far from
where we stand by Captain Phillip and his small band of Englishmen,
and now there stands a fine city that has become famous throughout the
world.
“In the same short space of time we have seen the rise of Australia
as a great nation, taking her full share in the counsels of the British
Commonwealth and of the world.
“I am proud indeed to be at the head of a nation that has achieved
so much.”
The Australian people are, perhaps, generally not demonstrative, but
on that memorable day there was not a man, woman, or child in this
great city who did not feel a thrill of emotion as that dainty young figure
stepped gracefully and firmly from the Royal Barge on to our soil and into
our hearts.
Past generations have made our Australia and our Sydney great -
it is up to us under the Queen of Australia to make them greater.

THE COMMERCIAL BARK OF AUSTRALIA LTD.
NEW POST OFFICE BRANCH, PITT STREET, SYDNEY.
A Spectacular Remodelling Project.
Architect; H. O. Woodhouse.
S. G. C. Baker (Associate).
Master Builders: A. B. Carr
Pty. Ltd.
The new Post Office Branch of
the Commercial Bank of Australia
Limited has recently been com'
pleted, after an extensive remodel'
ling of the original building, which
was first completely demolished ex'
cept for walls, floors- and roof, in'
eluding the removal of old stairs
and lift, shopfronts, and even ex'
tended to the entire demolition
and rebuilding of the front facade.
Old Bric\vuor\
Defective.
After the builder had com'
menced cutting off the ornate front
piers and cornices, which exposed
the brickwork of the main front
wall, which it was originally in'
tended should remain to take new
tile facing, it was found that the
entire brickwork of this wall almost
without exception was built in
such a defective manner that the
wall was unstable and in danger of
collapse.
The brickwork was built with'
out correct bond and was 14in. in
thickness; several courses of header
bricks had been built leaving a
straight joint between them and
the remaining inner thick'
ness. A large proportion of the
bricks were poor sandstocks built
in compo mortar and some courses
were merely broken bats and many
of the bricks could be removed by
hand.
The exceptionally heavy over'
hanging portions (which were to
be removed) were carried on iron
pins projecting about 12in. beyond
the face of the wall, but only bed'
ded about six inches into the wall.
The stone courses provided to carry
the heavy overhanging cornices
were projecting about Sin. beyond
the face of the wall, but were only
embedded from 2in. to 3in. into
the wall.
In addition, the piers in the main
wall between the windows which
are carrying the load of the wall
do not comply with two
skins of brickwork at the side of
the wide window openings with
straight joints for full height of
windows and without bond of any
kind to the remaining portion of
the pier. This condition meant
that the archbars over the window
openings were supported on the
abovementioned 4jin. brickwork.
Above the archbars a brick arch
was bearing directlv on to this
completely ineffectual portion of
brickwork, which was overstressed
and liable to collapse.
The revelation of these condi'
tions involved the complete demo'
lition of the front wall down to
the main girders at First Floor
level and a new wall was built
14in. in thickness in cement mor'
tar to comply with the City Coum
cil’s requirements.

PAPER FORMS FOR
CONCRETE WORK.
“Formatubes” Are Versatile.
Paper forms are achieving popular'
ity for the pouring of concrete piers
and columns.
These forms, made of laminated and
impregnated fibre'tubing, have been
used in such constructions as “Sheri'
dan Close,” St. Kilda Road (Mel'
bourne), a magnificent residential
block; the Australian Card Clothing
Factory, Oakleigh, Victoria; the new
Domestic Science High School, Pens'
hurst, Sydney (one of Australia's
most impressive school buildings), the
Russian Orthodox Church, Strath'
field; the R.S.L. Building at Cron'
ulla, and the Middle Harbor Yacht
Club (where the tubes were under
tidal water for weeks with no sign of
deterioration).
These tubes are made by Textile
Cones and Tubes Pty. Ltd., of FiU'
roy, Melbourne, and Alexandria,
Sydney, and marketed under the
name of “Formatubes”. Made with
an inside diameter varying from 3in.
to 24in., are light, and easy to handle;
strong, but handy enough to suit the
one'man fob, and for this reason
alone, they show great saving in labour
cost. Moreover, they cut easily—and
they strip cleanly, precisely, easily, and
neatly. The tubes also have an amaz'
ing versatility, which allows them ready
application to many types of concrete
forms to fit special requirements.
They are made of a practical lam'
inated and impregnated fibre tubing
developed in the laboratories of Tex'
tile Cones and Tubing, and formatube
columns have, as is demonstrated by
test and practical application, the same
load capacity as do square columns of
equal bearing surface.

per sq. in, pressure and 720 deg. F. temperature discharging to surface condensers
giving high vacuum conditions. The alternators are direct coupled and generate
at 11,000 volts. The present installed capacity of the station is 22,500 kW which
will shortly be increased to 37,500 kW by the addition of a 15,000 kW Ljungstrom
type turbo-alternator unit, space for which is visible in the background. The tur-

Precast Reinforced Plaster Slab Walls
QUICKER AND CHEAPER.
Gypsum plaster has been used for
many years in Australian building for
the surface finish of masonry walls and
in the form of internal wall linings in
timber-framed construction. Its use in
the structural walls of houses is a com-
paratively new development.
Within the past ten years this
method of using plaster has made
steady if unspectacular progress in
three Australian States. To-day we
find reinforced plaster lintels in gene-
ral use in Western Australia, while in
South Australia and Victoria complete
houses are being made of this material,
using prefabricated walls 2£in. thick
which have proved strong enough to
support the roof of a house. The
walls are precast on tables in much the
same way as fibrous plaster sheets are
made. The reinforcing steel, electrical
conduits and window frames are placed
in position before the plaster is poured.
Many Advantages.
Reinforced plaster walls have a
number of advantages of interest to
the builder and building owner:
Rapid Setting Time and Gain in
Strength.—The precast wall units are
usually hard enough to walk on their
surface within twenty minutes after
casting and can be lifted in twenty-five
minutes. (Unless they are specially
treated, reinforced concrete units re-
quire about the same number of
hours.) This makes possible consider-
able economy in factory and equip-
ment, and also a high rate of produc-
tion. Compressive strengths at two
hours after casting are of the order of
400 lbs. per sq. inch, rising to a dry
strength at on e week of 1200 lb., but
300 lb. per sq. inch has been shown
to be adequate to support all nornlal
loads and is being tentatively specified
as the minimum strength which the
plaster should attain at two hours.
Shrinkage cracks are eliminated be-
cause gypsum plaster expands instead
of shrinking.
Lightness in weight results in re-
duced transport and handling costs.
When wet, the material weighs about
two-thirds as much as the same volume
of concrete; when dry, a little more
than half as much.
Any cracks caused during handling
can be easily and completely repaired.
The precastWall has a surface finish
which needs no additional decorative
treatment where conditions of strict
economy exist.
It is claimed that the overall erected
cost of a 2£in. thick reinforced plaster
wall is less than half that of a single
brick wall plastered both sides, and
about half the cost of a timber-framed
partition with fibrous plaster sheet
coverings.
Certain Limitations.
There are, of course, certain dis-
advantages:—
It cannot be exposed to the weather,
as gypsum is soluble in water,, conse-
quently is most suitable for plaster
walls for internal partitinos.
Wet gypsum will corrode ordinary
reinforcing steel, but this can be pre-
vented by using galvanised reinforce'
ment.
Strength and stiffness are low by
comparison with concrete, but they
are adequate for use in the walls of
single'Storey buildings.
Stronger Plaster.
This new and useful application of
gypsum plaster—the raw material for
which occurs in plentiful deposits in
Australia—promises to make a web
come and worthwhile contribution to
our building resources. Research work
is at present in progress which may
lead to the production of gypsum
plasters of much greater strengths than
can be obtained with ordinary plaster
of paris. Specimens have been pro*
duced with compressive strengths as
high as 2800 lb. per sq. in. at two
hours after casting and 6000 lb. air
dried at three days.

Scheme for Rebuilding City of Liverpool
The photo shows a model of the
central area of Liverpool as it will
appear when redeveloped. A feature
of the scheme is the Civic Centre,
dominated by St. George’s Hall, and
the photo also shows how the area
is enclosed by the Inner Ring Road.
The fine buildings which *dy
exist round St. George’s Gardens
have been taken as a nucleus for the
Civic Centre.
In May, 1941, Liverpool suffered
its worst damage by enemy action.
The devastated areas will form the
sites for the city’s first rebuilding pro-
jects.
23 MILES OF LIGHTING.
Cold Cathode lighting, totalling up to
23 miles is used in the Heaton heavy
engineering works of Parsons & Co. Ltd.
Newcastle-on-Tyne, England. From small
beginnings the installation has taken six
years to reach its present dimensions.
It lights a floor area of 450.000 sq. ft.
of engineering workshops with an inten-
sity of 10 lumens per square foot. The
lamps are 42 feet above floor level.
The Installation was carried out by Gen-
eral Electric Co. Ltd. with Osram
tubes. Represented in Australia by
B.G.E.-all States.
LIVERPOOL REBUILDING SCHEME.
The scheme, judging from the model, appears to be a maze and a jumble, and
even worse than our Federal Capital, Canberra, if possible. In fact, at first glance,
it might be mistaken for that city!

New Offices In The United States
MANY HUGE NEW PROJECTS.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER.
New York’s Wall Street district,
probably the most heavily built'Up
piece of acreage in the world, is about
to get its first major new building in
twenty'five years. The seventy'year'
old New York Produce Exchange
Building will be torn down to make
way for a new thirty'Storey, 25,000,000
million dollar (£A.I 1,000,000), air'
conditioned skyscraper.
This is only one of many new office
buildings of remarkable architectural
design which will be erected in New
York and other American cities dur'
ing the coming year. The “world’s
biggest builders of office buildings” are
two New York architects, Percy and
Harold Uris, who right now have
started an immense new building pro'
ject in Philadelphia, a kind of pendant
to New York’s world'famous Rocke'
feller Centre. In the new, 23'acre
Penn Centre, they will erect two slab'
like, 20'Storey buildings, the first to
cost 15,000,000 dollars £A.6,700,000).
The buildings will flank two sides of
a pedestrian walk with two levels of
shops, one on the street floor and the
other underground.
Uris Brothers’
Office Buildings.
Uris Brothers now control seven of
the largest New York office buildings
valued at 70,000,000 dollars
(£A.31,400,000), in which their in'
terest is estimated at 20,000,000 dob
lars (£A.8,940,000). The strange
thing is that for their big projects,
Uris Brothers have only a small staff
of some thirty employees who work
in a 14'room office. Thus they are
compelled with utmost precision in
directing thirty to forty different sub'
contractors.
Typical for their type of office
buildings is the new 25'Storey,
25,000,000 dollar (£A. 11,000.000)
building which has been completed on
the site of the old RitZ'Carlton Hotel,
which, of course, was outmoded long
ago. Work during the construction
has proceeded with machinedike
smoothness on a strictly detailed
schedule. Few materials were piled
on the sidewalk or in the streets, be'
cause most of the materials are brought
to the site only when needed.
Construction workers’ hours are
staggered so no time will be wasted.
Some of the building workers arrive at
7 a.m. to start mixing mortar for the
bricklayers who come at 8 a.m. As
“Time” puts it, the whole operation
resembles an assembly line in reverse:
instead of having the product carried
along to stations where materials are
stored, the materials are carried to the
product.
“Filling the Envelope.”
In erecting five of the largest office
buildings in the last few years, the
Uris brothers’ policy has been to “fill
the envelope,” i.e., use every cubic
foot of space that zoning laws permit.
They use graduated setbacks because
it gives them more floor space per
building. Among these buildings is a
new 22'Storey building at Park Avenue
and 59th Street, entirely rented to the
Arabian'American Oil Company, and
a 25'Storey building at Madison
Avenue and 57th Street whose tenants
include Doubleday 6? Co., Colorado
Fuel 6? Iron Corporation, and Street
& Smith Publications.
A new 35'Storey office building is
being built on the Avenue of the
Americas immediately north of Radio
City Music Hall. The plot for the
building extends back 320 feet on
Fifty'second Street and contains 57,000
square feet of ground area. The as'
sessed valuation of the property is
3,483,000 dollars (M. 1,560,000).

Architectural plans for the new build'

of rentable area. Leonard J. Beck,
head of the Knickerbocker Develop'
ment Inc., says that the skyscraper
office building will be of the same type
and character as the new Sinclair Oil
Building at Fifth Avenue and 48th
Street.
Air-conditioned Offices.
Air ' conditioning is a must in
modern new office buildings. The air'
conditioning industry succeeded with
its slogan that air'eonditioning in sum'
mer is just as necessary and just as
natural as heating in winter. A 28'
storey blockfront building is just being
erected at 260 Madison Avenue, from
38th to 39th Street, by Moses
Ginsberg £■? Sons. All offices are air'
conditioned. Sylvan Bien is the archi'
tect.
Modem Bank Building
Shows Bank Operations.
An entirely new kind of bank build'
ing, having an exterior plate'glass and
polished aluminium, is being erected
by the Manufacturers Trust Company
on the south-west corner of Fifth
Avenue and Forty-third Street. The
new building replaces the branch office
of the Bank at the southeast corner
of the same intersection.
Open to view and inviting to the
public, the new building will be a
3,000,000 dollar (<£A. 1,345,000) four'
storeyed, air' conditioned structure
situated on a plot 100 x 125 feet.
Horace C. Flanigan, President of
Manufacturers Trust Company, point'
ed out that this building will represent
an interestingly progressive step in
American banking practice. The archi'
tecture should ensure a sense of
stability and security, but, departing
from the classic design of the past, will
use the latest in form, construction
and materials that lend themselves to
the modern concept of banking ser'
vice.
Architects are Skidmore, Ownings
6? Merrill. The office building has
almost entirely sealed glass exterior
that provides the public with a pano'
ramie view of activity within the bank.
The main entrance will be on 43rd
Street, with no doorway on Fifth
Avenue. This unusual treatment will
permit an uninterrupted display win'
dow along the entire 100 ft. Fifth
Avenue frontage. This window is
highlighted by a 30'ton Mosler vault
door which has been designed by
Henry Dreyfuss.

NEW BUILDING OF MANUFACTURERS' TRUST COMPANY
NEW YORK CITY.
This building is most unusual in that its external walls are of plate glass, which pro-
vides the public with a panoramic view of the activity within the Bank. We have
no doubt that this glass would also be bullet-proof, as is may appear very tempt-
ing to those who regard banks as places from which to acquire easy money. Messrs.
Skidmore. Ownings and Merrill are the Architects.

count officers and tellers’ space for
day-to-day banking transactions that
require expeditious servicing. A sepa-
rate entrance will be provided from
43rd Street which serves not only the
elevators to the upper floors, but also
provides direct access to the safety de-
posit vaults. This arrangement will
afford additional privacy for those
using the vaults and will also enable
access to them after banking hours
without the necessity of going through
the bank.
The main banking room for com-
mercial accounts and senior officers is
one floor above the street level. The
third floor accommodates clerical
offices and the Personal Loan Depart-
ment. The fourth floor will provide
room for expansion. A reception
lounge, dining room and kitchen are
housed on the roof.
The design for the building has
called for a unique arrangement where-
by mechanical, electrical and acous-
tical facilities have been thoroughly in-
tegrated into an artistic luminous ceil-
ing. This over-all ceiling treatment
conceals the sources of light and air-
conditioning as well as acoustic mate-
rials. The sealed glass walls of the
building are being washed and main-
tained by use of a scaffolding arrange-
ment which operates from built-in roof
suspensions.

The original approved sketches have
been carefully revised. Plans have
not been changed much in layout, and
the main hall with the gallery will
accommodate either 1592 or 1472
people, according to final seating ar-
rangements. A smaller hall will hold
440 people. Both halls will be self-

The Council undertook the first part
of the foundation work and excavated
for 85 piers and filled the same with
massed concrete to within 3ft. of the
surface.
The superstructure will b'e a steel

The building is estimated to cost
about £133,000. It is hoped to have
the building completed in 1955, the
report adds.
FREE LIMITS AND HOUSE SIZES
RAISED.
From January 1, 1954, the present
limit of ,£2OOO for industrial and agri-
cultural work undertaken without a
licence has been raised to £25,000.
For other buildings the limit has been
raised from £5OO to £lOOO.
From the same date, local authori-

HOBART BUILDS FOR FUTURE
TASMANIA IS LAND OF CONTRASTS.
Hobart, Tasmania, will be the venue
of the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia’s 1954 Convention, The
Federal President, Mr. T. M.
Lipscombe, F.A.1.8., is a resident of
that prosperous city and a Master
Builder of high repute.
Hobart, historic capital of the
smallest State in the Australian Com'
monwealth, lies snug in the lap of
mighty Mt. Wellington. The city is
very much alive—and on the move.
New buildings are changing the
skyline, the northern and eastern
suburbs are expanding rapidly, and
the population is growing steadily. It
is now past the 91,000 mark.
Like Rome, Hobart is built on seven
hills. It spreads about the shores of
the River Derwent estuary, twelve
miles from its entrance into Storm
Bay.
The harbour, 60ft. deep at the
wharves and landlocked, is on e of the
finest in the world.
The eastern confines of Hobart
stretch along the western banks of the
Derwent, while the northern and
western boundaries extend up to the
foothills of Mt. Wellington, 4166 ft.
of rugged and often snow'peaked
grandeur.
Since World War II the Tasmanian
population has risen by 60,000 —from
less than 250,000 —and it continues to
increase at the rate of 4% a year .
When in Hobart, the Queen re'
sided in the fine Vice'Regal residence.
Dominating th e Queen’s Domain
about half a mile from the city, the
stately house was completed in 1857.
It has 70 rooms.
The building is in the Tudor'Gothic
style of architecture. The brown stpne
with freestone dressing used in its con'
struction came from quarries in the
ground, one of which was later con'
verted into a lily pond.
The chimney shafts are unusual.
There arq 50 of them, and no two
alike. The clock in the tower is dated
1821.
The ballroom is sweeping and
gracious —80 ft. by 30ft. and the
stained'glass window at the dais end is
outstanding in design and workman'
ship.
But the French boudoir, with its
hand'painted ceiling and walls, and
delicate old furnishings and tapestry,
is probably the most charming of all
the rooms in Hobart Government
House.
Dreaded Penal
Station.
Some 60 miles from Hobart the
once dreaded Port Arthur penal
station, is now Tasmania’s top tourist
attraction.
Last year, 30,000 tourists passed
through, and 20,450 of them paid
■£2045 to inspect the Model Prison,
the psychological terror inflicted on
convicts after the abolition of flog'
ging. Between 1830 and 1877 about
30,000 convicts passed through the
settlement, but to'day it is a ghost
town of ruin and decay.
The Scenery Preservation Board pro'
poses to leave the ancient buildings as
they are —in ruins—and make the sur'
soundings as to tourists as
possible.
It will no doubt be a centre of in'
terest to mainland builder delegates to
the Federation Convention in October
next.
FREE RAIL TRAVEL.
22,000 railway employees with their
wives and families travelling “on the
nod” in December and January be'
tween Brisbane and Sydney made it
impossible for paying passengers to
secure berths in trains, some were not
even able to get a seat.
Railway employees are now getting
as much in salaries and wages as other
people and it is time that the practice
of travelling “on the nod” at taxpay'
ers’ expense ceased. A comparison
would be to provide meat, milk, bread,
cement, groceries, lime, timber, bricks,
petrol and everything else to various
people because they worked in these
specific industries, which would make
the practice look ludicrous.
WHAT WILL THE ROAD CARRY?
Road deflection measured by the "Ben-
kelman Beam," as the device is known,
will be of great help to engineers in
evaluating existing pavements or limit-
ing traffic loads. It will also assist in
planning maintenance and reconstruction
work. The beam pivoted at three points
and fitted with an indicating fulcrum
shows the deflection made even when
the vehicle is moving at a "creep"
speed.

Twentieth Century Damascus
“THE STREET CALLED STRAIGHT.”
Damascus is little known to most
people except may be through the
Bible and particularly the recalling of
“The Street Called Straight.”
“T h e Encyclopaedia Britannica”
shows three wood'cuts of Damascus-
one of the City, one of the covered
“Street Called Straight,” which runs
from the eastern to the western end of
Damascus, and another Khan Sueliman,
an old, roofless building, named after
the great Sultan of Turkey, which was
formerly an inn but is now a thriving
bazaar.
It is only when a personal friend
visits there and sends news of its
realities and modern developments, as
distinct from its antiquarian associa'
tions, that any of its charms to be
lived with an enjoyed come to light.
From His Excellency, Dr. Mario
Santos, comes the following informa'
tion of his new abode and some of the
conditions now maintaining that
should endear Damascus to visitors to
that country.
He says his house in Damascus is
very pretty and there are no servant
problems. The best months to Visit
Syria are October, November and
March'April.
In his opinion, it is better to visit
that part of the world before visiting
many other places.
Damascus is only 20 hours from
Brazil by air, five hours from Rome,
six from London and Paris.
“The city is very interesting; very
modern in the European quarter and
very primitive in the Arab district.
Their calender marks only the year
1375, but the people are very well'
behaved.
“A bricklayer gets only 10A for a
day of 10 hours, and so on. No one
ever strikes, and thieves are unknown.
You can leave gold and no one would
touch it,’’ Dr. Santos writes.
“The climate is the best I have ever
experienced. There is a plenteous
supply of fruits such as you cannot
imagine, and their prices are ridicu'
lously low. We are now in the grape
season. There are more than ten dif'
ferent qualities and the price is 3d.
per lb. of the best!
“The water is a gift of God. Comes
out of the ground everywhere. We
have a lovely spring out in the mourn
tain that becomes a waterfall in our
garden.”
The Street Called
Straight.
Damascus is one of the holy cities
of the Mohammedans, and it is the
point where devout Moslems assemble
on the pilgrimage to, and separate
on their return from, Mecca.
It is auspiciously situated on a plain
2200 ft. above sea level and about 60
miles southeast of Beirut. Beautiful
gardens, groves, orchards and fields
cover this extensive plain. It is water'
ed by the Biblical “rivers of Damas'
cus,” the Abana and the Pharpar, now
called the Barada and the Awaj, which
enter the city itself and thus forms a
60'mile oasis bounded on the west by
the Anti'Lebanon mountain range and
on the east by the adjoining desert.
The “Street Called Straight,” asso'
ciated in the Bible with the conversion
of St. Paul, is a feature of great in'
terest in Damascus. It is even to-day
the most important thoroughfare in
the city. Then there are the house of
Judas, to which Ananias went, and
Ananias’ own house. (Acts 9).
Other places of interest include the
citadel, built early in the 13th cem
tury; the Jews’ quarter in the southern
part of the city; “the Gate of God’’
(suburb of Meidan), through which
pass the pilgrim caravans en route to
Mecca ;and the English cemetery (out'
side the wall to the southeast).
NEW BUTTON FACTORY,
WILLOUGHBY, SYDNEY.
Interesting Constructional Features.
Because of the constantly growing
demand for Beutron buttons, G.
Herring (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. —who are
even now manufacturing over
2,000,000 buttons per week are
building a new factory at the corner
of Gibbes and Short Streets, Wib
loughby.
The building will have a floor area
of 30,000 square feet, with provision
for an additional 20,000 square feet,
and it has been adapted to a sloping
sight, which allows for a large base'
ment under the northern end with a
separate access from Gibbes Street,
On the first floor will be the ad'
ministrative offices and board room,
and a large canteen with a modern
cafeteria for serving hot meals. The
first storey has a floor constructed of
steel decking with bituminous paving
felt as an underlay for the future floor
coverings.
The roof over this portion is of
similar construction, carried on open
rod trusses of the “clearspan” type,
the decking being insulated and finish'
ed with aluminium foil on bituminous
felt.
The major point in the economical
design was the decision to use “Liquid
Envelope’’ for the finishing of the ex'
ternal walls above the texture brick
base, this allowing the use of plain
asbestos cement sheets, which are sim'
ply butted together with no interrupt'
ing or projecting cover strips.
The value of the plant is estimated
at £76,500.
Architects are Messrs. Davy and
Brindley; builder, Mr. Peter Cussel;
consulting engineer, Mr. J. P. Hallett.
When completed in July, 1954, it
will employ a staff of 100 women and
65 men.
Termites construct buildings 1000
times higher than themselves. By
comparison, could man build skyscrap'
ers 15 times higher than himself? St.
Pauls Cathedral for instance is 365 ft.
There would be no sense in man’s at'
tainments at 5,475 ft. reaching the
zenith of termites’ attainments.

King’s College Tender Accepted
QUEENSLAND BUILDING WILL BE STRIKING.
Brisbane Master Builders, M. R.
Hornibrook Pty. Ltd., are the success'
ful tenderers for the new Kings Col'
lege at the University of St. Lucia,
Brisbane.
Building is about to begin, as the
college authorities have £67,000 in
hand, and the Queensland Govern'
ment will subsidise the new college
pound for pound up to £75,000.
The college will stand in six acres
of ground near River Drive. The
property was donated to the Uni'
versity.
Owing to rising costs, the college
authorities at first decided to postpone
building the Chapel and dining hall,
but it now appears that it will not
be necessary to delay this building.
The Chapel will be a simple rect'
angular building, modern in appear'
ance, with strip vertical windows from
floor to ceiling on both sides.
The main building will be set at
an angle of 30 degrees to the road to
obtain full advantage of prevailing
breezes.
Memorial.
This building will be long and two'
storeyed, dominated in the centre by
a tower (see illustration).
This central tower, to be built of
warm'textured Helidon freestone, to'
gether with vestibule and lecture
rooms, will form a memorial to the
men of Kings College who fell in the
two World Wars.
To the left of the tower will run
the two-storeyed students’ quarters,
and to the right will be the main ves'
tibule, and farther on the dining hall,
kitchen and staff quarters.
Students’ Flats.
The 70 students in this first sec'
tion will be housed in what are virtu'
ally self'contained flats. The ground'
floor flats will house seven students in
individual rooms; eight will be ac'
commodated on the first floor.
Each flat will have a pantry, stor'
age space, telephone, and toilet facili'
ties. Each study will have built'in
furniture, comprising desk, wardrobe,
and chest of drawers. These will
form the wall between each pair of
studies.
To the immediate right of the tower
will be the vestibule of freestone, with
wide granite steps, and behind it will
be the music room, tutors’ common
room, lecture rooms and library.
The foundations of the tower go
down 20 to 25 ft. to solid rock. The
wings rest on piers sunk deep in a
foundation of clay. To absorb minute
earth movements, these wings will be
built in separate units connected by
specially'hinged construction joints.
Although this new Kings College
will be a most imposing building when
the present work is finished, it will
become an architectural masterpiece
when the total project, estimated to
cost .£250,000, is entirely completed.
NEW INCENTIVES FOR
INDUSTRY.
The Archbishop of Canterbury. Dr.
Fisher, recently told 500 Manchester
businessmen that the old output in'
centives —profit for the employer and
more money and continued work for
the worker—were played out.
New incentives he recommended
were desire to serve the community;
personal responsibility for good work;
the family spirit in industry and com'
merce; just and reasonable relation'
ships between employer and employee.
Dr. Fisher said that strikes ought
to be regarded as a “’personal re'
proach” to both sides for not having
been able to find a better way to
solve their problems.
CONCRETE CEILINGS BY AN
ARTIST.
Pure engineering in the hands of an
artist has created some architectural
masterpieces in modern construction.
Rei Luigi Nervi, the Italian designer of
open spans of reinforced concrete with
a gift for geometric expression has
transformed his utilitarian construction
into works of art. His designs produce
great open spans with ingeniously rib-
bed, reticulated or corrugated under-
sides all striking departures from the
usual modern plain rectangular form.
Here is shown a factory ceiling of con-
tinuously poured concrete in which the
ribbed underside is designed for stiffen-
ing and the proper distribution of the
stresses. —"Engineering News-Record."
MEMORIAL TOWER, KINGS COLLEGE, BRISBANE.
As a memorial to the Fallen, this impressive tower is to be incorporated in the new
Kings College to be erected at the University of Queensland. St. Lucia. This
magnificent university occupies a large area at St. Lucia, on a wide sweep of the
Brisbane River a few miles upstream from the city, and when completed, it will be
the finest and most modern residential university in the Southern Hemisphere.

NORWEGIAN FOREST
PRODUCTS.
Wide Range of Articles.
The Norwegian forests are now pro'
ducing a wide range of varied and
unlikely articles, including silk, drink'
able alcohol, B vitamins, ink, explo'
sives, and vanilla flavouring.
The highly'developed wood pro'
cessing industry in Norway has now
left the paper, pulp and wallboard
manufacture to their own resources,
and is concentrating on the produc'
tion and processing of new chemicals,
for which the abundant Norwegian
pine and spruce trees are the main
raw materials.
Over a quarter of Norway is cov'
ered by productive forests, and conse'
quently the forestry industry has long
been one of the most important in
the country’s economy.
Ten centuries ago, during, and even
prior to the Viking period, Norway
was already exporting wood and tim'
ber products to countries overseas,
but the best care was not always taken
to conserve the great natural resources
of the Norwegian forests.
Early agriculturalists burnt down
the trees to cultivate crops in the
ashes. Later, when the discovery of
various ores in the mountains led to
a flourishing ore'mining industry huge
areas of birch and pine forests were
felled for charcoal burning, and tracts
of land were laid bare and denuded
of trees. Much valuable timber has
also been felled in Norway for house'
building and for fuel.
Many Demands.
With so many demands, being made
on them, Norwegian forests can bare'
ly meet the requirements of the high'
ly'developed, modern industry which
has grown up since the first Norweg'
ian cellulose, a chemically'prepared
wood pulp, factory was built near
Sarpsborg in 1847.
There are 42 mechanical wood pulp
factories in Norway, 20 chemical wood
pulp factories, and 49 for manufac'
turing paper, cardboard, carton and
wallboard. At full production they
consume some 100,000 logs of timber
each day, 30,000,000 logs every year
—or, it is estimated enough to stretch
five times round the world at the equa'
tor.
The value of exports from the wood
processing industry amounts to be'
tween one'quarter and one'third of
Norway’s total exports.

Rccently'discovered British coalfields
yield at least 400,000,000 tons of coal.
This seam is 3000 feet below the sur'
face with a thickness varying from five
to eight feet. The output of deep'
mined coal in Britain in one week in
November last, the third highest figure
for the year 1953. was 4.48 million
tons.
SEVEN-TON STEEPLE GOES UP.
To complete construction of the new First Methodist Church in Salem, Virginia, a
seven-ton steeple had to be lifted to 120 feet above the ground. This precision
job was carried out with a Lima 34-T crane. The crucial test came when a caucus
of watching Methodists decided the cross ought to point North-South so that the
sun would shine on its faces. With only a few inches of cable left, the crane
operator lifted the entire cone enough to give it a half turn and lowered it into
place with the sun glinting on the cross. The left-hand photo shows the crane
lifting the 32ft., 5½-ton rectangular and octagonal shaped section in place on its
brick base. Next, the 2800 lb. cone was raised to its spot on top of the lower
section of the steeple (centre). Note the switch in direction of the 5ft. cross,
as seen in the right-hand photo.
TAXI-COPTER IN U.S.A.
An artist forsees the elimination of much earth-surface traffic delay, by the adoption
of modern high-speed jet aircraft. Long runways, frequent taking off or landing,
however, necessitates the siting of air terminals at some distance from the cities,
so much so that it takes longer to reach the business centre than to reach the air-
port after travelling some hundreds of miles. The situation calls for the adoption
of helicopters as a solution to this problem. Pictured here is a pre-view of a few
years ahead. A taxi-copter, capable of lifting and alighting vertically, is seen
landing at a city terminal. Helicopters have been in constant use tor mail delivery
between capital cities, post offices and country districts in U.S.A. They are much
smaller than the taxi-copter shown.

Fire Resistance of Reinforced Columns
BRITISH BUILDING RESEARCH STATION REPORT.
The Building Research Station has
produced the sixth of a series of re-
ports on fire resistance. The report*
describes an investigation of the rela-
tionships between the fire resistance of
reinforced concrete columns and the
applied load, the concrete strength,
the column size and the design of the
reinforcement.
The columns tested were square in
cross-section and varied in thickness
from Sin. to 19in. Portland cement
and gravel aggregates proportioned to
give cube strengths varying from 2250
to 5000 Ib./sq. in. at an age of 28
days. The columns matured for
periods varying from seven months to
two years nine months.
Under test the columns had a
length of 10ft. exposed to a furnace
while a load was applied hydraulically.
The tests were carried out in accord'
ance with the standard fire-resistance
test procedure specified in British
Standard 476, with the exception that
the specimens were tested until cob
lapse and the water test and reloading
test omitted for this purpose.
The investigation has yielded much
information on the effect on the fire
resistance of reinforced concrete
columns of such factors as applied
load, concrete strength, column size
and the method of reinforcing the
concrete.
The spalling of the concrete cover
of the main reinforcing bars at high
temperature was found to increase the
rate of temperature rise of the bars
and the concrete core of the column.
It is possible to considerably increase
the fire resistance of a column by
wrapping a light mesh reinforcement
around the main bars before concrete
ioR- This holds the concrete cover in
place during a fire so that it protects
the bars and the core of the column
even though it has itself ceased to
carry load.
The paper describes test conditions,
toe behaviour of the various columns
under test and the effects of various
factors on the behaviour of the test
pieces. The test data and results are
given in a comprehensive series of
tables and diagrams.

ROYAL VISIT DECORATIVE LIGHTING.
Awards Announced.
The Illuminating Engineering
Society of Australia (N.S.W.) has an'
nounced that the winners of the Royal
Visit Decorative Lighting Award are
as follows: —
Decorative Lighting of Buildings—
1, Mark Foy’s, Liverpool Street; 2,
Philips Electrical Industries, Clarence
Street; 3, Anthony Hordern’s, George
Street.
Illuminated Arches: —l, Chamber of
Manufacturers, Macquarie Street, north
of Martin Place; 2, Bankers’ Arch,
Martin Place and Pitt Street.
Adjudicators’ Comments.
There were a number of very credit'
able floodlighting installations, such as
the Maritime Services Board’s new
building at Circular Quay West, The
Museum and The Court House at
Taylor’s Square, to mention a few,
which all received careful considera'
tion, but the panel’s decided pre'
ference for something more than just
floodlighting is evidenced by the vot-
ing. In the case of Mark Foy’s, the
floodlighting on the Liverpool and
Elizabeth Street frontages amounted to
more than half the total decorative
lighting of 123 kilowatts. Great pains
had evidently been taken to produce
a spectacular and dignified picture and
the result in public appeal is very high
indeed. There is no doubt that this
installation is the outstanding example
of its type.
Philip’s Electrical Industries was not
as imposing a building to start with—
a relatively small one, in fact —and the
decorative lighting was deliberately de-
signed to hide it rather than to reveal
it even in a disguised form. The 58
kilowatts of lighting in the form of a
huge crown and script cyphers, each
30ft. x 45ft., was the direct result of
outlining in lamps. An excellent ex-
ample of its type, very well conceived
and carried out.
Anthony Hordern’s, George Street,
made a brave display with a rather
more subdued effect and a simpler at'
rangement of floodlighting from the
awning only.
The buildings mentioned above by
no means exhaust those deserving of
commendation, and the panel wishes
to commend the following:—
Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and

With regard to the illuminated
Arches, the panel was set, if anything,
a more difficult task because the light'
ing of the more appealing in design
left much to be desired. During the
last week after the judging by the
Sub-Committees had taken place, the
Arch sponsored by the Royal Agricul-
tural Society in Bridge Street changed
from a poor attempt to use ultra-violet
light on suitable phosphorescent paints
to bright incandescent light. Had this
occurred earlier it would undoubtedly
have been placed in the final selection.
Both of the entries received out-
side the City area were inspected by a
member of the panel, i.e., The Cable
Makers Australia at Liverpool and The
Ford Motor Works at Homebush. It
would not be fair to comment upon
them except to note that they com-
pared favourably with many city in-
stallations. The small park in Rand-

(2) Philip’s Electrical Industries Pty.
Limited, Head Office, Clarence &
Margaret Streets, Sydney.
Designed by S. H. Watson.
Installed by Philips Electrical stall.
The basis of the design on this
building is the symbolic representation
of a crown carrying decorative Royal
cyphers, and the whole bulk of the
building has been incorporated into
the final effect. Details of the mate'
rials used are as follows:
The top of the crown is constructed
from hardboard on a wooden frame'
work carrying festoon lamps, the outer
rim being 15W sign blue and the in'
ner rows sign blue with groups of
25W natural red. Each peak is sur'
mounted by a 100 W inside silica'
sprayed lamp as a representation of
the pearled points of the crown. The
jewels in the crown have been pro'
duced with banks of standard 40W
white fluorescent lamps sheathed with
red, white and blue P.V.C. film which
is carried down over the holders for
weatherproofing purposes. The base
of the crown comprises a yellow paint'
ed facia board carrying 15W gold fes'
toon lamps in two lines.
The large decorative script cyphers,
each 30ft. by 45ft., are made from
sheet metal punched for festoon lamps
in white, blue and gold. The edges
of the letters are returned forward ap'
proximately 3in. to avoid spill light
on to the face of the building. When
illuminated the letters therefore stand
out in relief against the comparatively
dark background.

The whole design is then given a
firm foundation by means of a 4ft.
facia board at the top level of the
ground floor, carrying four rows of
festoon lamps in blue and gold. For
added interest this bottom facia board
is interrupted at selected intervals by
the Royal Coat of Arms moulded in
rigid P.V.C. film and illuminated from
the back by means of 4 x 40W white
fluorescent lamps. To relieve the hard
shadow between the top of the bottom
facia board and the wall of the build'
ing a single 100 W lamp is placed be'
hind the board and between each set
of windows. These also serve to flood'
light the red and blue vertical drapes
between each window.
To complete the design, the outer
corners of the building carry a string
of 15W festoon lamps as a border.
Three flags on the top of the build'
ing are each illuminated by means of
a 500 W internal reflector flood lamp,
The small awning over the front of
the building is handled in a very
simple manner with one row of gold
lamps beneath the outer edge. The
facia is draped and set with small
groups of flags.

ROYAL DECORATIONS.
Anthony Hordern’s Fine Display.
In the great crowds that gathered
in Sydney to see the decorations, both
by day and at night, that made our
city so beautiful during the Royal
Visit, one frequently heard the words:
“but have you seen Anthony Hord'
erns’?” And well they might, for as
part of Sydney’s loyal tribute, Anthony
Horderns’ decorations won the admit'
ation of all who saw them. The
store was painted in a shade of pale
blue, and 2,000 pots of red, white and
blue flowers decorated the George St.
awning. A total of 287 flags flew
from awnings and masts in George,
Goulburn and Pitt Streets, and in the
windows were displayed enlarged rep-
licas of the Royal Crown, Sceptres,
and Orb, and ten Dioramas entitled
Australia s Links With the Crown,”
by Clothilde Highton, G.M.C.
Beneath a magnificent 18ft. x 17ft.
Coat of Arms, a panel bearing the
words “Long Live the Queen” domin-
ated the George Street frontage.
A unique feature of the display were
the fluorescent flags which, the pro-
duct of British “Celanese”, London,
were specially imported for the Royal
Visit by Anthony Hordern and Sons
Limited. They are believed to be the
only two of their kind in Australia
and are woven into a 100% acetate
deep blue fluorescent light. Staff
interior of the store and thus contrib-
uted to making Anthony Horderns’ —
members enthusiastically decorated the
fabric with very fine fibre, treated with
fluorescent dyes which only react to
ultra violet or what is commonly
known as Black Light.
Fluorescent Flags.
At night the tower was bathed in
in its entirety—a symbol of welcome
and respect.

THE LION AND THE UNICORN.
Royal Visit Decorations.
Unique among the many displays in Sydney to greet Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth
II., is the display over the toll gates of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The heraldic
figures of the Lion and Unicorn were brought specially to Australia by The Common-
wealth Industrial Gases Limited. During the Coronation, these interestingly con-
trived figures were among the many colourful decorations to be seen in London's
famous Mall, along which the Queen passed to the Coronation ceremony. The
Lion and Unicorn were constructed to the design of Mr. James Woodford. R.A.,
the sculptor who desined the Queen's Beasts for the Annexe to Westminster
Abbey. Each figure is 17ft. tall and weighs 5 cwt. Constructed of tubular steel,
they were bent to design by hand. The joints were then welded, each of the
animals hav img some 250 separate welds. To complete the bodies, a tracery of
mesh-infilling was used, and this is jointed by 600 spot welds on the 400ft. of
infilling needed for each animal design.

Queensland Public Works Projects
MUCH ACHIEVED IN YEAR 1952-53.
Impressive progress in construction
of “Capital” works in Queensland is
recorded in the Annual Report of the
Department of Public Works for the
year ended June 30, 1953.
Expenditure on buildings in that
period was £1,998,599, against
£2,204,492 in the previous financial
year. The average expenditure on
buildings during the five years to
June 30. 1941, was £559,417. Ex'
penditure on buildings during 1952'
53 was 3i times greater than the aver'
age annual pre'war expenditure.
The activities comprised construe'
tion of capital works, maintenance of
Government buildings, and work done
for other Government departments.
The value of work authorised and
under construction at June 30 was
■£2,260,898, and total number of men
employed at that date was 1218.
Maintenance works cost £355,871,
compared with £312,339 in the pre'
vious year.
Expenditure on school accommoda'
tion represented almost one'half of
the total expenditure for the year.
Most new classrooms are in timber
frame construction, the report states,
and totalled 147. Much work has been
done in providing additional accorm
modation and improving existing ac'
commodation at Government hospitals,
maternity hospitals. Old People’s
Homes, court houses, police stations,
and other public buildings.
Steady progress was made during
the year on the erection of a three'
storey, reinforced concrete Govern'
ment office block at Rockhampton
(see illustration). This imposing
building has brick and stone facings.
It will be in partial occupation by
January 1, and will be completed be'
fore June next.
Among other work is the erection
of new Court Houses at Hughenden
and Ingham (see illustration). Satis'
afctory progress has been made with
construction of both buildings.
Completion of the Toowoomba Ma'
ternity Hospital is anticipated by the
end of this year. This building is a
completely new unit of modern design
(see illustration) and will meet all the
requirements of a 60bed maternity
hospital.
The total building expenditure dur'
ing the year on Maternity Hospitals
was 117,287, and included a 21'bed
unit at Stanthorpe, additions at Bun'
daberg, and new wards at Emerald and
Barcaldine.
Day Labour.
The Department, the report says,
carries out its building works by day
labour, by branch organisations in the
eight different divisions of the State.
Apprentices.
Special attention is given to super'
vision of the 222 apprentices in all
branches of building work. More
youths are offering for apprenticeship
to carpentry and joinery, bricklaying,
and the electrical trade than there are
vacancies available. Difficulty has ah
ways been experienced in securing ap'
prentices to the painting trade and
as machinists, the report adds.
Returned'soldier trainees employed
at June 30 totalled eight.
Expenditure on Buildings.
It is interesting to note that expen'
diture on State public buildings dur'
ing the past nine years has increased
more than ten Told, from <£170,437/
12/11 in 1943'44 to £1,831,326/15/7
in 195 2'5 3.
THE ROMAN CALENDAR.
Under the original Roman calendar
there were only 10 months in the
year, from March to December. Urn
der this system September was the
seventh month. When Julius Caesar
in 46 B.C. added January and Feb'
ruary to the calendar, September be'
came the ninth month, although
“Sept” means seven, “Oct” (Octob'
er) means eight, “Nov“, nine, and
“Dec” ten.
COURT HOUSE, INGHAM, UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
Satisfactory progress on this and the Hughenden Court House has been maintained.
60-BED MATERNITY HOSPITAL AT TOOWOOMBA.
It is of brick construction, part two-storey and part three-storey.
GOVERNMENT OFFICES, ROCKHAMPTON. UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
This three-storey, reinforced concrete building has brick and stone facings. It will
be completed by June next.

of special illumination problems. This
course will be given by a number of
specialist lecturers and will extend over
three terms. The entrance require'
ment is a pass in Illumination 1 and 2
or the standard of general physics in
an engineering degree. Fee, £6/6/0.
All three courses will commence in
the last week of February, and in'
tending students must enrol previous
to attendance and are requested to give
notice by letter of intention to enrol
as soon as possible to the School of
Electrical Engineering for Illumination
1 and Illumination 3, and to the
School of Applied Physics for lllu'
mination 2. The notice should include
particulars of educational qualifica'
tions and should be accompanied by
the appropriate remittance. Intending
students will then be forwarded an
admission ticket and notified of the
date and location of the first lecture
of the course in which they are em
rolled.
The three courses are approved by
The Illuminating Engineering Society
as the educational qualification for
membership of the Society.

This new volume covers not only
sound amplifiers, but the whole system
from the source of the signal—wheth'
er microphone, gramo. pick'up or lead

deals with tone control, measurement
methods and radio'relay systems. An

Australia’s Memorial
to America
Unveiled by Queen.
On February 16 the Queen perform'
ed the unveiling ceremony of the
Australian Memorial to America at
Canberra.
The memorial, a striking feature
of Canberra’s skyline, is a tribute of
thanks to the American people for
their contribution to the defence of
Australia during World War 11.
The great column, surmounted by a
huge American eagle is 258 ft. high
of sand'blasted aluminium and its com'
plete simplicity adds to its impres'
sivcness.
The inscription on the tablet reads:
“In grateful remembrance of the
vital help given by the United States
of America during the war in the
Pacific, 1941'45. Unveiled by Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth 11., 16th
February, 1954.”
The design is the result of an at'
chitectural competition which was won
by Mr. Richard Ure; The McConnell
Building Co. Pty. Ltd. were the build'
ers.
EFFECTIVE DELINEATION.
These two sketches from a German ar-
chitectural journal present a short and
effective style of delineation showing
(top) "the house with the lid off," re-
vealing the Internal arrangement in a
manner that is clear to the layman. It
is an early type of "split level" house,
where according to the location of the
stairs several levels have been employ-
ed. The bottom scene shows one half
of the roof as being on a different level
throughout its entire length, which is a
logical solution for a sloping site prob-
lem. Ventilation is aided by clerestory
windows and lighting is aided by the
insertion of roof panels.
THE RHODES CENTENARY EXHIBITION.
A feature of the United Kingdom Pavilion at the Rhodes Centenary Exhibition held
at Bulawayo, South Africa, was the triple tiers of raking cantilered canvas awnings
which provided at the same time welcome protection from the fierce sun and
brought colour to the otherwise rather plain building. The plant pots on the sides
of the lamp standards are attractive.

£1,000,000 FOR NEW TASMANIAN
SCHOOLS
To Meet Population Increase.
The allocation of more than
£1,000,000 for new schools and to
provide better classrooms during the
current financial year has been an'
nounced by the Tasmanian Premier
and Minister for Education, Mr.
Cosgrove.
Mr. Cosgrove said the big expen'
diture was necessitated by the large
increase in Tasmania’s population and
the consequent increase in school em
rolments. New suburbs were coming
into existence on the outskirts of the
cities and larger towns, and new
schools had to be provided. Approval
had been given for calling for tenders
for work at Launceston High, Belle'
rive, Gormanston, Myrtle Park, Pioneer
and Pyengana schools.
Tenders would be invited as quickly
as possible to get the works under way
during the summer months. The Ten'
der Board had received tenders from
seven building contractors to erect the
Devonport Modern School, which was
the highest number of tenders received
for many years for any one building
project on the North West Coast, and
they were keenly competitive.
A MAJOR BUILDING JOB:
Hornibrook Mackenzie Clark’s Work
At Pyrmont “B” Power Station.
Some idea of the magnitude of the
contract carried out by Hornibrook,
Mackenzie, Clark Pty. Ltd. in the con'
struction of the Pyrmont “B” Power
Station is gained when it is known
that 24,000 cubic yards of concrete
were placed in position in the founda'
tions and 1,500,000 bricks were laid.
Intricate Tunnel Work.
One of the most intricate prats of
the work was the construction of the
outfall and intake tunnels for the new
station, which had to be built yet at
the same time keep the existing
Pyrmont “A” Station in operation.
Altogether 2400 lineal feet of tunnel
12ft. x 10ft. in size was constructed.
The parent organisation of M. R.
Hornibrook Proprietary Ltd. was re'
sponsible for the erection of the struc'
tural steelwork in this great under'
taking and altogether 5500 tons were
erected.
ROMAN ASTRONOMY.
The Romans had a theory that at
a certain period each year the
warmth of the sun combined with that
of the Dog Star, Sirius, to produce
extra hot days. These occur in the
middle of summer and cover a period
of from six to eight weeks. Owing
to their supposed origin they are call-
ed Dog Days.
Building Across The Continent
£4,000,000 RAILWAY WORKSHOPS IN QUEENSLAND.
Work has begun on construction of
the new £4,000,000 workshops on a
133'acre site at Redbank, Queensland.
The vast new plant will be in oper'
ation in 1957'58. It will absorb the
iromworking section of the Ipswich
railway workshops, take over all the
heavy iron work, maintain the State’s
locomotives—now numbering 860—
and build new ones.
To do this more than 1000 of 3000
present staff will be transferred from
Ipswich.
The workshops will cover 104 acres
and the bulk store 29 acres.
Planned new buildings will be of
steel, brick, and fibro cement.

ritory, with Mount Hermannsburg in the background, and gum trees fringing the

class hotel to be built on Thursday Island, and the only one north of Cairns.
The plans have been approved by the Licensing Commission, and the hotel will
replace the old Imperial, which was badly damaged by a cyclone last year. Mr.
W. A. Seddon, of Port Kembla (N.S.W.) will spend £40,000 on the new hotel.
Construction is planned to begin after the next "wet" season about April. The
hotel will include a private and public bar and septic systems. Tennis courts and
a swimming pool will be added later.

The new, spacious Banking
Chamber at Ground Floor level is
equipped with beautifully'grained
polished Queensland maple fittings,
rubber paved flooring in green
tones, and a new acoustic plaster
ceiling to overcome the excessive
noise from Pitt Street. The Bank'
ing Chamber is illuminated with
attractively designed fluorescent
lights set in flush with the ceiling,
and walls are painted in pale green
tones.
A completely new plenum sys'
tern of ventilation has been pro'
vided both for the Banking Cham'
ber and Basement, with an exhaust
ventilating system to serve the new
toilets.
The front of the building has
been faced with polished red'russet
granite up to First Floor level,
with new bronze'framed windows
to the Banking Chamber.
The new Pitt Street entrances
to the Banking Chamber and the
public corridor have been provided
with polished bronze double doors
with extruded bronze panels of at'
tractive design leading into lobbies
protected by glazed swing doors.
The upper portions of the front
of the building have been faced
with Wunderlich ceramic tiles in

NEW VICTORIAN HOSPITAL.
Work on the Traralgon and Districts Hospital (Victoria) is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of this year. The new hospital is expected to be known as the
"Princess Margaret Wing." It will comprise the ground floor and three storeys.
Patient capacity will be 210. The hospital will have wards of one, two, four, and
16 beds. The top floor will be for maternity cases only. The boiler-house is almost
ready, and foundation for the nurse’s quarters are completed. Estimated cost is
£1,000,000.
BRISBANE'S FIRST VISUAL EDUCATION LIBRARY.
This £6250 visual education and standard library—the first of its type in Queens-

Rapid House Construction In Britain
FIVE ERECTED IN FOURTEEN DAYS.
Five prototype houses, with internal
walls of prefabricated gypsum plaster
panels, have been constructed in four'
teen days at the new satellite town of
Kernel Hempstead by Sir Robert
Me Alpine 6? Sons Ltd.
This trial scheme was agreed to by
Kernel Hempstead Development Cor'
poration after they had been approach'
ed by McAlpines with the design of
the new house. In spite of the in'
corporation of internal prefabrication,
the design retains the traditional ex'
ternal appearance by having a
brick “skin.”
Of the five houses erected, one pair
of two'bedroom houses was completed
within 12 days and the remainder —
three ' bedroom terrace types were
finished two days later.
Plaster Partitions.
The house has been designed so
that the standard Ift. 6in. and 2ft. Oin.
gypsum plaster panels can be used
almost throughout, although with the
intricate planning of small houses there
are certain cases where smaller units
are required; but the material is easily
cut and fitted.
Erection of the panels is compara-
tively simple. It is usual to start from
one corner of a room, where an Bft.
Oin. x 2ft. Oin. sheet is placed in
position and a further sheet is placed
alongside. Two aluminium channel
clamps are then fitted over the joints
by a connecting link through the
panel, which, incidentally, is with'
drawn later, and liquid plaster is
poured in at the top. This forms a
homogenous joint and when the sepa-
rating strips are withdrawn the plaster
face is rubbed down and made good.
It is usual practice to erect a whole
wall of panels before the joint filling
is commenced.
These plaster partitions have a per'
fectly smooth surface and have good
sound and thermal insulation values.
The use of the plaster units also
means that when the material is de'
livered to the site it has already dried
out and, consequently, the internal
permanent painting can be carried out
immediately.
The plumbing is designed on the
one'pipe system, and consists of a pre'
fabricated steel soil pipe, with all the
branch pipes connected, which is de'
livered and placed in position for con'
necting to the other sanitary ap'
pliances. With this type of soil pipe,
site labour of the plumbers is reduced
to a minimum of approximately twelve
man'hours.
For the electrical wiring, the con'
duit, etc., is cast in the gypsum plas'
ter panels during manufacture and
one small metal connection box is sup'
plied with all the connecting wires
cut to length and coiled ready for in'
sertion. By this method, the whole
of the wiring of the house may be
carried out by one man in four hours.

SUCCESS STORY
A young English lad named Frank
Taylor was only 16 years old when
he only dreamed of his own builder
and contractor’s sign—but erected it
boldly and started building with cool
confidence a pair of houses.
His capital was £3O. He borrowed
an extra £7O off his father, and struck
out, clear-sightedly, into his building
project. He planned two houses on
Blackpool’s outskirts as homes for his
parents and an uncle. With their con'
struction halTcomplete, a stranger ap'
peared, liked their style, and wanted
to buy.
Not overkeen on selling, young
Taylor asked a discouraging price—
£looo a pair. The other agreed to
buy.
So, at 16, on two houses costing
him £250 each when finished (includ'
ing all material, land, labour and legal
charges), he paid back his father and
banked £430. That was 32 years ago.
To'day, Frank Taylor heads the civil
engineering firm of Taylor Woodrow
Ltd., a mammoth of its kind, with
branches in all parts of the world, in'
eluding Australia.
It sets up aerodromes, housing es'
tates (including one at Miranda and
one at Woolooware, Sydney), new
towns, dams, reservoirs, power sta'
tions, armament and aircraft factories,
and takes £15.000,000 British Gov-
ernment contracts in its stride.
Nobby’s Signal
Station
Submarine Attack Recalled.
Mr. J. C. Pickles, Newcastle Mast'
Builder, has commenced work on
the new £6OOO signal station at
Nobbys, at the entrance to New'
castle harbour.
The building will have bronze, cir'
cular windows around the top, and its
upper floor will overlook the old
lighthouse—an antiquity in coastal in'
stallations, and almost 100 years old.
Mr. Pickles was also erecting new
brick cottages at Nobbys in June,
1942, when a Japanese submarine
surfaced and opened fire on a con'
Crete emplacement housing a power'
ful searchlight.
One shell missed this target and hit
a corner of a half'built cottage, but
did not explode, and little damage
was done.
“However, it was close enough to
be exciting,” Mr. Pickles recalls.

Practical Christianity
Builds Homes
Amazing Achievement of
British Parson.
It is impossible not to be moved
and inspired by the story of Charles
Jenkinson, a humble British clergy'
man who changed the face of smoky,
slum'ridden Leeds.
Mr. H. j. Hammerton tells the
life'Story of the big'hearted, hard'
hitting parson in “This Turbulent
Priest, ’ a most inspiring and reveal'
ing document.
One of a family of eight, son of a
London docker, Charles jenkinson be'
gan his working life as a law station'
er’s clerk. But even then he led a
campaign to stamp out the unfair
privilege of pew rents at the poor
people’s church at which he was a
choirboy!
Serving as a private in World War
L, he determined to take Holy Orders,
and characteristically took a degree in
law that his wits might be sharpened
to help him fight the devil in man.’’
He needed it. jenkinson hadn’t
been in Leeds—the chief seat of Eng'
lish wool manufacturing (population
500,000) —many months before he
fought a local election for a seat on
the city council and found two-thirds
of the aldermen dead against speedy
slum clearance.
Appalling Conditions.
Barely 21 years ago nearly one'
quarter of the Leeds population lived
in the foulest slums in Britain.
Sooty washing was strung across
the narrow streets, gutters were choked
with filth, and the tumbledown houses
of the notorious Holbeck district were
packed back'tO'back, eighty to an
acre, each with only one tiny bedroom
and a small living room that served
as combined kitchen, parlour, wash'
house, and larder.
Some of the oldest and worst were
occupied by nine or ten people. No
fewer than 27,000 houses lacked a
toilet. The nearest “convenience” of
the most primitive type was often six
or eight houses down the street.
This was Charles jenkinson’s parish.
Born in a slum himself, he looked at
the ramshackle houses and quietly de'
termined to raze his parish to the
ground.
Sometimes the tenements beat him
to it, and tumbled down of their own
accord. Once the rotten timbers of
a house caved in, and Mr. Jenkinson
called out to his wife to see a re'
markable sight. Down the street
went a long black column of bugs on
the march!
In these infested and terrible slums,
people died twice as fast, infant mor
tality was three times as high and the
tuberculosis death rate five times as
bad as anywhere else.
After crusading against such ghast'
ly misery, sweeping away the slums
and building the modern workers’
flats at Quarry Hill—now considered
among the finest in Europe—the Rev.
Charles jenkinson died three years
ago, worn out at sixty'one. What a
battle he waged; what a noble victory
he won!
Rat-Trap Homes.
To rouse public opinion, the cru'
sading parson drew up housing re'
ports and circulated thousands of leaf'
lets. In 1930, Leeds planned at best
to clear slum houses at the rate of
only 400 a year, with no guarantee
that the programme would be achiev'
ed.
But jenkinson issued a scheme for
the demolition of 30,000 rat-trap
homes in six years and the rehousing
—at the cost of .£22,000,000 —of near'
ly one-quarter of the Leeds population.
Idealistic? Within three years Mr.
jenkinson was returned to full power.
On a soap'box in a small room be'
hind the Leeds Town Hall he sat down
to make his dream come true. To
speed the sums out of existence, he
worked through every alternate night,
dispensing with sleep. People who
grumbled at their housing officer
little realised he had twice worked the
clock round, besides holding church
services.
No curate could be found to help
him. Often on the way to his humble
dwelling, he would call at a parishion'
er s home and collect a pile of wash'
ing. The young wife was ill in bed,
and taking her laundry home to do
was jenkinson’s measure of practical
help.
Within a few months he saw the
first phase of his dream come true,
as the first slum'dwellers moved out to
a garden suburb. jenkinson’s re'
housing estate at Gipton was one of
the first in Britain to be planned as a
neighbourhood unit with shops, old
people s flats, and even “sunshine
houses for consumptives.
Yet, as he watched the people move
to new homes he was appalled at the
sight of the old sticks they had been
using as furniture. It was useless to
destroy slums if they were taking the
slums with them, he declared. So he
arranged for the Leeds Corporation to
supply utility furniture on hire'pur'
chase, a small sum being added to the
rent.
Towards the end of his life, the
Rev. Jenkinson was appointed chair'

It is stated that when Tectonite is

British Migrants
Co operative Housing
First Home Opened at Little Bay.
In a spirit of self-help, a team of
British migrants have grouped them-
selves together in a Co-operative
Housing Society, to erect homes for
their members on Crown land made
available by the N.S.W. Government.
The first of these homes, a three-
bedroom, timber-framed, weatherboard
dwelling, has been erected in Little
Bay Road, Little Bay, and a further
58 will also be built.
The new house is ll£ squares, and
it was officially opened recently by
Mrs. Clive R. Evatt, in the presence
of a large gathering.
Many Present.
Among those attending the func-
tion were the Deputy Mayor of Rand-
wick, Alderman R. A. Popplewell (a
well-known Pagewood Master Build-
er), Aid. E. Dan (Randwick), the Fed-
eral Member for the district, Mr. Dan
Curtin, M.H.R., Sir John McLaren,
President of the Millions Club, and
local churchmen, including Monsieg-
nor McAuliffe, of Kensington, Rev,
Mr. Bennett, of Botany, the Rev, Mr.
Edwards (Kensington), the President
of the British Migrants’ Co-operative
Housing Society, Mr. J. Munn, and
the family who will occupy the first
house, Mr. and Mrs. J. Barnes, and
two children.
Official Opening.
Following an address of welcome by
the Deputy Mayor of Randwick, the
Minister for Housing, Mr. Clive Evatt,
praised the initiative of the British
migrants in tackling the housing prob-
lem in such an able manner, and in
building the homes with their own la-
bour, at a cost of approximately
£2OOO each.
The Crown land has been sold to
the Society, and the Minister handed
over the Title Deeds of the building
sites to the President, amid applause.
Several other speakers praised the
initiative of the families in tackling
such a big task as building 59 homes,
and wished them every success in their
meritorious project.
As Mrs. Clive R. Evatt officially
opened the first house, two pipers
played a Scottish air, “Our Home.”
Mrs. Evatt then handed over the
house to the Barnes family amid
cheers and applause.

South Australian
State Housing
Trust Reports Record Year.
For the year to December 31 the
South Australian Housing Trust com'
pleted 3856 permanent houses —the
largest number built by the Trust in
any year.
It also built 22 emergency dwellings
making a total of 3878 houses under
its various schemes for the year.
In 1952 the Trust completed 3196
permanent houses and 683 emergency
dwellings.
A total of 19,111 houses have been
completed by the Trust since it began
operations in 1937.
This year began with 3040 houses
under construction.
Of the Trust’s programme to im'
port 3800 houses from overseas, the
last consignment of 32 houses arrived
from the U.K. on January 1.
It is expected that all imported
houses will be erected and ready for
occupation by August. Up to De'
cember 31, 637 imported houses were
sold and 1438 let. The programme
of 2284 emergency dwellings has
been completed.
At the Trust’s present rate of con'
struction, houses built in 12 months
required an area of 1000 acres. In an
area of this si?e, about 34 miles of
road are required, most of which are
new roads.
Timber-Proofed
Boards Tested
The Building Materials Division of
the C.S.R. recently announced the de'
velopment of a termite'proofed board.
The company has completed a series
of exhaustive tests on building boards
over 12 months, with conclusive re'
suits.
The claim will interest builders and
home'owners in areas where white
ants are a costly problem.
In September, 1952, 38 test pieces
of various boards were half'buried in
the ground at Wittenoon, Western
Australia, where ants are particularly
active.
Recently the samples were removed
and examined and the C.S.R. claims
that the ants, some of which were up
to half an inch long, had completely
ignored test pieces of C.S.R.’s Tim'
brock and Canedte.
NEW CLAW TOOTH
BAND SAW.
A new type of band saw tooth
which differs from other types in use
has a greater positive rake which
gives it a higher efficiency in opera'
tion. The band is claimed to increase
cutting rate 25 per cent., give better
cut finish and have a longer life than
conventioned tooth designs. It is pos'
sible to use bands in widths up to
inches. This saw is made by the
DoAll Company, Illinois, U.S.A.,
represented in Australia by Westeels
Industries.
NEW IDEAS AND OLD.
"The Architectural Digest" is a splendidly produced journal featuring the best of
the houses built in the sumptuous Los Angeles-Hollywood district of California and
as such it forms a most interesting mirror to reflect the latest ideas that are ap-
pealing to those to whom, generally, cost Is of little consequence. The top pair
present an interesting contrast between a simple wall and window treatment with
cream bricks and louvred shutters of the seagreen variety with a modern all-glass
sun porch equipped with some ridiculous wicker-work and steel pipe chairs that look
like babies’ basinettes with a list to starboard. The middle pair emphasise the
desire tor coolness in a hottish climate in the wide overhang of the eaves (right)
and the completely louvred walls in vertical louvres between bedroom and porch.
In the bottom pair, on the right is a fireplace of massive stonework in a lounge
room that is considerably enlivened by large potted plants to form a rather unusual
decorative design across the front of the fireplace, that appear to represent a
series of seagulls in flight—apparently taken the wrong turn for Sorrento! The gate
on the bottom left assumes a porte cochere in the modern manner if slanting timber
props to support a roof slab could thus be called a porte cochere. Perhaps a
lych gate would be a better guess.

Victorian Forests
Programme
Large Planting Planned.
In a long range plan to make Vic-
toria independent of all imported tim-
bers, the Victorian Forests Commission
will plant over 3,000,000 pines this
year.
Following World War 11., Victoria
sent millions of pounds overseas to
Scandinavia for timber.
Much of the imported timber was
of poor quality, and cost twice as
much as locally-milled timber.
The Victorian Forests Commission
believes the State can become com-
pletely self-sufficient in both soft and
hard timber, and it is greatly extend-
ing its pine plantations for increased
production of softwood.
It is also encouraging the use of
Victoria’s extensive hardwoods for a
variety of purposes, formerly executed
in softwoods.
Australian hardwoods are becoming
increasingly popular both in Australia
and overseas for building and furni-
ture manufacture, and home builders
are finding local hardwoods consider-
ably more durable than softwoods for
floor boarding.
Australian blackwood is much
sought after abroad by furniture man-
ufacturers. It is equally as attractive
as mahogany and much sturdier than
cedar, which dents easily.
Fire Hazards.
At present Victoria has 45,000
acres of pines under cultivation for
the production of softwoods, and the
Commission has built an 8000-mile
load network through the forests to
enable fire-fighters to reach fires in
the quickest possible time.
A great fire hazard in Victorian
forests today is the large amount of
waste timbers lying on the ground in
timber felling areas.
In Scandinavian countries, private
enterprise utilises this waste matter by
processing it into hardboard which is
sturdier by far than the original tim-
ber.
If this were done in Australian for-
ests, it would not only reduce the
bush-fire danger, but would introduce
a new and valuable building materials
industry.
BRITISH TECHNICAL COLLEGE.
The time-honoured saw-tooth roof in this example appears to have been too well
fed and acquired curves where it should be flat. They are in fact shell concrete
roofs only 2½" thick. The building is portion of the new Technical College at
Peterborough, Great Britain. The continuous lighting from above in the roof, as
well as at the ends ensures excellent natural lighting to the interior.

The watchman was on his rounds on the first floor—when fir*
broke out on the third floor. It could have proved disastrous—
but for the installation of Guardian Automatic Fire Alarms
The nerve centre of the Guardian Automatic Fire Alarm Systenj
responds instantly to the rise in temperature which even the
beginning of a fire produces. Automatically, a signal is trans-
mitted to the nearest fire station and, when the fire brigade comes,
the exact position of the fire is illuminated on the control panel
in the burning building. Guardian Automatic Fire Alarm Systems
ensure full operation, day and night, 365 days in the year.
For safety’s sake, employ a “Guardian.”

BRITISH DRIFT FROM
AGRICULTURE.
In the 12 months ended September
30 last, 16,000 workers had drifted
away from agriculture in Britain and
food production has dropped. The
numbers employed in the U.K, metal
and engineering trades fell by 66.000
in the same year, while manpower in*
creased in the less essential occupa*
tions.
Paint Expert Becomes
Sales Director
British Paints Executive in
New Appointment.
Mr. K. N. Shedden has been ap-
pointed Sales Director for British
Paints (Australia) Pty. Ltd., for the
Commonwealth of Australia.
He is particularly well known in
the N.S.W. paint and hardware trades,
as he spent 14 years as the Newcastle
and Coalfields representative of Taylor
Paints.
When that company was merged
with British Paints in 1950 Mr.
Shedden joined the parent organisa'
tion as Sales Manager.
His promotion has been the subject
of many congratulations, and the Aus-
tralian paint industry will greatly
benefit as the result of his detailed
knowledge of Australian markets.

IMPORTANT BUILDING PROJECTS COMMENCE.
By F. O. NIXON.
The falling'off in the number of
Brisbane building permits during
December of 20% compared with
November, and 15% against October,
is rather less than one might expect,
since the last month of the year is the
one when the Building Trade take
their holidays. As usual, dwellings
within the range of £3OOO to £4OOO
are responsible for numerous contracts,
on this occasion 26, this being the
type of dwelling regarded as the mini'
mum for small families, of husband,
wife and one or two children. Even
at £3OOO, the price does not permit
of verandahs, the vanishing charac-
teristic of Queensland’s tropical and
subtropical standard dwelling. Those
who look to reductions in the basic
wage, to cut down the high cost of
living, cannot afford to ignore the
probable catastrophic effects. The
majority of young couples, saddled
with an almost lifetime liability, cost
ing them about £3 per week in in"
terest, £2 in redemption; insurance,
painting and upkeep extra, view any
suggestion of reduced wages with
natural apprehension.
There were four more sumptuous
dwellings listed at <£sooo, £7OOO,
£B9OO and £9500. Three new flat
buildings are to cost £3715, £4210 and
£ll,OOO, and an additional storey to
Lennon’s Hotel will cost £15,000. A
varied lot of stores and factories to
the number of 13 include two at
£30,000 each, the others ranging from
£3OOO to £10,500. Additions to three
churches will cost £4lOO, £7300 and
£15,555 respectively.
The petrol service station renais*
sance continues to brighten the subur*
ban landscape, with three new places
costing over £6OOO each and one at
£3OOO. Beyond wealthy insurance and.
similar institutions with plenty of
money to spend, the building of such
places as mercantile structures, how*
ever necessary, is a hazard in the com'
petitive field, where old established
concerns with their lower capitalised
warehouses and factories have a great

advantage over new building at 300%
higher in costs. This is a problem of
some magnitude, as evidenced by the
comparative paucity of the kind of
commercial buildings that were so
much in evidence in prewar days.
University Colleges.
Very large expenditure of money in
building in Queensland is projected,
but the nature of the works help to
confirm the submissions just made in
this letter. For example, the cost of
buildings planned to begin this year,
estimated to cost about £4,000,000,
include King’s College (Methodist),
stone building of two storeys, cost
£160,000; Cromwell College (Congre-
gational), to cost over £100,000; and
St. John’s College (Anglican), to cost
not less than £120,000. These three
colleges are to be built at St. Lucia
in the grounds of the Queensland
University.
The Mt. Olivet Hospital, a five'
storeyed building in the care of the
Sisters of Charity, is to cost £280,000.
Mutual Life 6? Citizens’ Assurance
Company’s maximum height office'
building, corner of Edward and Albert
Streets, to cost £300,000, is now under
way, with the demolition of some of
the oldest substandard shops in the
heart of the City. The Prudential
Assurance Company’s five' storeyed
building, in Queen Street and corner
of North Quay, is to cost £530,000.
The Queensland Turf Club’s new con'
Crete double'decked grandstand, to seat
3500 more enthusiasts, is estimated to
cost £250,000.
The well-known non-alcoholic Can-
berra Hotel, built to the maximum
allowable height, is to build on the
adjoining land acquired, in Ann Street,
additional accommodation for 200
guests, additional kitchen, dining and
functional rooms, at a cost of
£450,000. The ten storeys will use a
lot of steel, concrete and brick. With
this addition the completed building
will present something outstanding in
Australian hotels. Cyclone Company
of Australia’s new steel-framed and
brick building at Geebung is set down
to cost £125,000, and Dalgety and
Company’s modern five-storeyed rein-
forced concrete and brick wool store
near their existing stores will cost
£500,000. Operations begin in April.
Marrickville Margarine’s factory of
concrete and brick is to cost £250,000.
The Egg Board’s concrete building at
Normanby, for pulping, freezing and
storage of eggs, is to cost no less than
£200,000.
In a recent Rents Court case, an
authoratative statement was made that
hte A.M.P. office building in Queen
Street, constructed about twenty years
ago for £260,000, would cost
£1,000,000 to build tO'day.
The big fillip given to lawn tennis
is Brisbane by Davis Cup matches has
been responsible for that Association’s
decision to spend £3OOO on another
grandstand at Milton to seat 1500,
bringing the total seating accommoda-
tion to 8000. Building is expected to
be finished to cater for the open
titles matches in November.
Boys’ Crammer School. A contract
was signed on February Bth between
Thiess Brothers and the Trustees,
Brisbane Grammar School, to construct
a 25 metres long and Bft. maximum
depth memorial swimming pool at a
cost of £lO,OOO. Work is to begin
in a fortnight as the money has already
been raised as a memorial to the 246
“Old Boys” who died on active ser'
vice in World War 11.
This is a memorial that is not likely
to be lost in the passage of time, as
so many are. Recently, there was dis'
covered in some rubble at the school
the foundation'Stone laid by the then
Duke of Edinburgh, on February 29th,
1868. Our inherent disrespect of
memorials has been responsible for the
destruction of several trees with equal'
ly important associations. It will be
surprising if some of the trees that
are to become part of the Avenue to
Canberra, the beginning of which the
Queen planted at Macquarie Place, will
not, as time goes on, be in the way
of some aldermanic planning in some
borough or town through which the
Avenue will pass.
St. John’s Anglican Cathedral in
Brisbane, the half'completed building
of Gothic beauty, is making a bold bid
to raise the £400,000 necessary to
complete it as a Royal Visit Memorial.
Success seems almost in sight, one
donation from a Queensland grazier
being £50,000, another from a motor'
car sales magnate £lO,OOO, three lead'
ing Queen Street stores of £lOOO each,
and many more.
A particularly outstanding donation
is that given by Mr. M. R. Hornibrook,
who is a member of St. John’s Cathed'
ral Building Authority Committee.
The donation, valued at £lO,OOO, is
made by Mr. M, R. Hornibrook on
behalf of his company, M. R. Horni'
brook (Pty.) Limited, and is to con'
sist of the whole of the porphyry that
will be needed to complete the western
exterior of the uncompleted end of the
building. This porphyry is to come
from a quarry at Kedron, a near-by
suburb of Brisbane. This donation
represents more than its mere cash
value—large as it is. The very hard
quality of porphyry required for so en'
during a building is not too easy to
find, with its varying colours of blue,
green and purple and intermediate
shades, blending with the colours of
the stone with which the first section
of the Cathedral was built. Fully 90%
of the stone quarried would be used
elsewhere.
In Mackay a new convent and
chapel, to cost £15,000, is to begin
construction soon.
In one day the South Coast Town
Council approved plans for 163 new
buildings to cost more than £250,000,
including 90 new dwellings valued at
£166,857, twelve blocks of flats to cost
£56,700, and other builds—boarding
houses, shops, etc. For the first seven
months of the present financial year
plans were approved for 908 buildings
valued at £1,583,353,
The diminishing stands- of market
able timbers in South Eastern Queens-
land has created several problems, to
solve which the Forestry Department,
in collaboration with the Royal Insti-
tute of Architects, Queensland Master
Builders’ Association and Queensland
Timber Stabilisation Board, have
agreed upon a more realistic approach
to the grading of timber. The new
adopted terms will be “Standard” and
“Common,” in each of which certain
defined defects will be permissible, as
they have been in the superseded terms
of “first” and “second” grades. The
defects in marketable timber, which
are in appearance rather than quality,
constitute knots and blemishes that do
not impair strength nor appearance out
of sight. A proviso allows 5% of
total timber in a job to be free of im-
perfections or defect when require I
“foi special purposes.”
State Schools.
There must ,be more activity, or
more workers, on building State
schools than is found in some jobs
that appear to go on indefinitely,
whether spasmodically like the
overhead railway at Circular Quay
or continuously. Builders of new State
schools—four of them high schools
and some other quite pretentious build'
ings—have won in the attempt to have
the schools ready for the increasing
attendances, mostly at primary schools,
where 120,000 children went to school
on 25th January, 1954. At least 100
new classrooms had been built, a„nd at
an estimated cost of £175,000 the new
high schools will provide for 1000
students. The problem of finding suf'
ficient number of teachers to avoid
classes having too many pupils for
each is said to be no mean one. The
extra one week holiday given to pupils
west of the 150th Meridian helped to
stem to rush to complete the extra
accommodation by the time schools
were assembled.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
Building activity for 1954 is now
well under way. Biggest New Year
announcement has been the release of
details of the 11-storey office block
to be erected on the corner of Franklin
Street and Victoria Square. Construe
tion of the building, which will house
the S.A. branch of the Mutual Life
and Citizens Assurance Co. Ltd., will
begin late this year. It should be com'
pleted by the end of 1955 at a cost
of £560,000. The site, at present oc-
cupied by Morialta Chambers and the
Windsor Castle Hotel, was bought by
the company in 1949 for £75,000.
This project, along with several other
major insurance building schemes, was
stalled for years by building restric-
tions and harsh rent controls, TKe
new block will have a frontage of 115
feet to Victoria Square and 52 feet to
Franklin Street and will rise to the
maximum allowed height of 132 feet.
The company will occupy part of the
ground floor as business chambers, and
possibly the first and second floors.
The rest of the office accommodation
will be let to selected applicants. The
structure will embody the latest ideas
of modern architecture and will be
erected in an encased rigid steel frame.
This method of construction —new to
Adelaide —eliminates outside scaffold'
ing and the pouring of wet concrete.
External walls will be largely of glass
with a new opaque sheeting material
to windowsill level, thus eliminating
masonry walls. Weight'saving develop'
ments are incorporated, making the
building the first of its kind in this
city, and probably in Australia. To
achieve this, the architects sought
several modifications under the Build'
ing Act and these have now been ap-

proved as variations to the regulations.
The construction methods will reduce
the weight of material used from 3000
to about 1200 tons. The accent will
be on off-site work where possible.
General design is aimed to provide
brilliant light and natural ventilation,
and the floor space will total almost
60,000 square feet. In summer, an
air-conditioning system will operate.
The architects are Bates, Smart and
McCutcheon, of Melbourne, and asso*
cite architects Lawson, Cheesman and
Doley, of Adelaide.
The State manager of the Mutual
Life and Citizens Assurance Co. Ltd.
(Mr. G. C. Gordon) says the new
building is an example of how to solve
Australia’s post-war bogey of short-
age of material and high construction
costs. His claim is significant, coming
at a time when the South Australian
Institute of Architects is nearing com-
pletion of its investigations into the
level of building costs in South Aus-
tralia. The Institute appointed a com-
mittee of enquiry several months ago
after the President of the Royal Aus-
tralian Institute of Architects (Mr. R.
S. Demaine) had called for an
Australia-wide probe on high building
costs by State architectural bodies.
The South Australian findings will be
completed by the end of March. The
State investigation teams will meet to
“compare notes” and issue a joint
Federal report, but any complete find*
ing on Australian building costs is not
expected to be made public before the
end of May.
Extensive re-building and “face-lift”
work is going on throughout the city,
particularly in Hindley, Waymouth,
Grote, Gouger and Hutt Streets.
Some of this activity is due to Royal
Tour preparations, but a good deal is
evidence of the gradual dispersal of
commercial interests away from
Rundle and King William Streets.
Among city tenders called recently
was one for remodelling and recon-
struction of the old Dunlop building
on the corner of Roper and Flinders
Streets. The work will be done for
Radio Corporation Ltd., now estab-
lished elsewhere in Flinders Street,
The old Dunlop building was gutted
by fire some years ago and has since
been unoccupied. The S.A. manager
of Radio Corporation (Mr. H. W.
Woodcock) says expansion of his firm
has created a need for extra space.
The old structure will be raised another
floor to a height of five floors, and a
former mezzanine eliminated. Exist-
ing foundations will be used as much
as possible. Radio Corporation Pty.
Ltd. hopes to move into the new pre*
mises by next Christmas. Work will
start early this year. Plans have been
prepared by the Corporation’s archi-
tectural staff and the supervising archi*
tects are P. R. Claridge and Gunn.
More big city building is pending.
Caradoc Ashton, architect for the Sav-
ings Bank’s proposed ten-storey office
block at the corner of Hindley and
Bank Streets, says he will be calling
tenders for the construction within the
next few weeks. There has been a
delay in announcing details of Eliza*
beth House, a six*storey office building
on North Terrace, but the architect,
E. A. Keal, expects work on the pro*
ject to begin shortly.
The move toward specialised educa*
tion for builders is gaining momentum.
Two courses of instruction —one for
master builder and the other for build*
ing foreman and clerk of works—will
begin at the School of Mines on Feb*
ruary 8. From that date the Master
Builder’s Certificate will become a
qualification for membership of the
S.A. Chapter of the Australian Insti*
tute of Builders. The State Secretary
of the Institute (Mr. H. Wilckens)
hopes that the certificate will eventual*
ly be a test for anyone intending to
set up as a master builder in this State.
He says leading S.A. contractors set
a high standard, but there is much

Advisory Bureau known as the
Mayfair Colour Centre, this unit
has proved of great assistance to
Builders, Master Painters, Con-
tractors, Architects and others
interested in the problems of
surface treatments on buildings,
new and old.
To-day throughout Australia
thousands of homes, factories,
offices, hospitals, banks and other
institutions have been colour
schemed by Mayfair, with results
that have always reflected credit
on the Contractor concerned.
The services of the Mayfair
Colour Centre are given com-
pletely without charge. Skilled
colour consultants prepare colour
schemes for smaller buildings and
carry out a complete pre-paint-
ing survey for larger projects
where paint and colour are used
not only to beautify and protect,
but also to improve working
conditions, assist in traffic control,
help prevent accidents, increase
production efficiency and fulfil
numerous other functional tasks.

A school building programme, esti'
mated to cost nearly £1,500,000 this
financial year, has been announced by
the Minister of Education (Mr.
Pattinson). It is by far the most in-
tensive programme yet undertaken by
the State Government. In addition,
£300,000 will be spent on providing
180 extra classrooms at established
schools. Schools being erected this
financial year include two infants’
schools, five primary schools, one area
school and two high schools. The
infant schools at St. Leonards and
Renmark will average seven classrooms
each, and cost a total of about
£lOO,OOO. Primary schools, each of
ten classrooms and costing about
£76,000 each, are under construction
at Mt. Gambier, Mitcham, Whyalla
West, Hampstead and Morphettville
Park. An £83,000 area school is being
built at Allendale East, and two high
schools, averaging £65,000 each, at
Naracoorte and Minlaton. Schools be-
gun or expected to be started this
financial year comprise one of eight
classrooms at Mt. Gambier East to
cost £57,000 and a ten-classroom area
school at Yankalilla for £72,000. In-
fants’ schools at Port Lincoln, St.
Leonards and Renmark, and primary
schools at Mitcham, Whyalla West and
Willesden are scheduled for comple-
tion this financial year. Preliminary
drawings have been prepared for a
further six schools and work will begin
immediately plans are finalised.
Special instruments to provide auto-
matic control of what will be the big'
gest sulphuric acid plant in the
southern hemisphere have reached
Port Adelaide from the U.K. The
77'ton shipment included special tern'
perature recording and airflow instru'
ments. All equipment is proofed to
resist acid, A 2000'kilowatt turbo'
alternator will follow shortly. Work
on the Port Adelaide acid plant is
now well under way and production
is expected to begin by the end of
this year. Acid plant sub-contracts for
more than £500,000 have been let in
Australia, more than half of them to
S.A. engineering firms. When com'
pleted, the plant will have an annual
output of 100,000 tons of acid. It
will make Australia’s superphosphate
supply much more secure. Principal
contractors for the job are Simon'
Carves (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
The S.A. Housing Trust has an'
nounced that 1953 was a record year.
In the twelve months to December 31
it completed 3856 permanent homes.
The Trust also built 22 emergency
dwellings. In the previous year only
3196 permanent houses were erected.
The Trust has built a total of 19,111
homes since it started operations in
1937. On January 1, 3040 dwellings
were under construction. The Trust’s
programme to import 3800 houses
from overseas has been completed.
The last consignment of 32 arrived
from the U.K. on January 1. It is
expected that all imported houses will
be erected and ready for occupation
by August. The blocks of 52 flats at
South Plympton and 56 at Morphett'
ville are occupied, and work is under
way at Sinclair Court, Camden (36
flats). Preliminary work has begun
on 92 flats at Fullarton. Total ren's
receivable for the year to December
31, 1954, from all Trust homes will
amount to £800,567. Of the 700
dwellings contracted for in soldier
settlement areas, 677 have been com'
pleted.
Tenders have been called for erec'
tion of the £60,000 Albion Hotel in
Churchill Road, Kilburn. The archi'
tects, Caradoc Ashton, Fisher, Wood'
head and Beaumont Smith, invited
preliminary notice of tenders as much
as two months ago, and early accep'
tance of a contract can be expected.
Work should start in late February or
early March and the hotel will be
open for business by Christmas. The
building will be two-storeyed, includ'
ing saloon and public bars, two cock-
tail bars, and two lounges. Fourteen
bedrooms will be provided, including

A £350,000 building expansion pro-
ject, now well under way, is expected
to increase the capacity of the Colonial
Sugar Refinery Company’s plant at
Glanville by 50% to 1200 tons a
week. £235,000 has been spent already
and work will be completed early next

Tenders for the Tumby Bay Sol-
diers’ Memorial Hall were called be-
fore Christmas, but the district council
has decided to reject all offers. Con-
tracts will now be sought “piece-meal.”
At present tenders are invited for
brick, masonry, and structural steel
work. Carpentry, roofing, plastering
and other jobs will be called for later.
Sectional building will be slower, and
the architect, Mr. Selby A. Chinnery,
estimates construction will take about
15 months from the acceptance date
of the first tender. The Hall will be
of brick and local limestone, stucco
finished externally. Entrance columns
will have a scagliola terrazzo veneer
and the roof will be lined with asbestos
cement, with trusses of fabricated steel
construction. Seating capacity will be
about 1000, including about 300 in the
gallery. The stage will be large with
interconnecting dressing rooms to aid
production of plays and concerts.
The Hall will be acoustically treated
and structurally designed to cater for
3'D films.
Work has been going to schedule
on the S.A. Tractor Company’s Enfield
project. A modern building covering
one acre is under construction on the
Main North Road. Tenders for elec'
trical installations are new being called,
and the structure should be complete
by the end of April. The premises,
of steel construction with a saw-tooth
roof, will be erected on a site
and will be used for service, sale and
assembly of Caterpillar tractors and
earth-moving equipment, John Deere
tractors and agricultural implements.
Provision has also been made for an
up-to-date store equipped with steel
bins, covering an area of 14,000
square feet. The store will carry
£250,000 worth of replacement parts.
There will be a showroom in one
corner of the site, next to the offices
and store, to exhibit tractors and
equipment, and a modern theatre will
be provided to educate the staff with
instructional films. Architects for the
job are Woods, Bagot, Laybourne-
Smith 6? Irwin.
Interstate tenders have just been
celled for construction of the John
Flynn Memorial Church at Alice
Springs. Architect is A. A. Philpot.
Praise for the New Year designs re-

MELBOURNE NEWSLETTER
It has been estimated that the Royal
Visit has been worth at least £lOO,OOO
to the paint industry and master
painters in Melbourne.
Never in its history has the city had
such a clean-up.
Generous use of colour has been
made. Schemes of decoration have
been adopted which, before the war,
would have been laughed out of court.
But the result has been pleasing and
has made Melbourne people more
colour conscious.
There has been co-operation be-
tween neighbouring owners to avoid
any clashing of colour.
The wholesale painting, and the
free hand given to master painters,
has brought out the architectural
features of many of the small build-
ings. Some architectural gems have
thus been discovered which have been
passed unnoticed for years.
Several complete city blocks have
had their buildings either washed down
or freshly painted.
The City Council has named June
30 as the final day for the removal of
the old type of street verandahs and
posts in the city.
Many of these, however, in the
recent general clean up have been re-
moved.
The old “Dammans Corner” build-
ing, opposite the Town Hall, on the
south-west corner of Collins and Swan-
ston Streets, is one which has been
cleaned. Another is the old Salisbury
Building, on the north-west corner of
Elizabeth and Bourke Streets, opposite
the post office.
Dammans building and its neigh-
bour in Collins Street, which are own-
ed by the Bank of New South Wales,
have taken on an entirely new appear-
ance. Both have been painted a bright
deep green with a contrasting colour
for the trim. A real transformation.
After a long period of stagnation in
city building work, several new pro-
jects have been announced.
Buchan, Laird and Buchan have in-
vited bids for erection of an office
block at 518-20 Collins Street for
James W. McGregor 6? Sons (Melb.)
Pty. Ltd.
The State Government has an-
nounced that another six floors will be
added to the four-storey building at
179 Queen Street, now occupied by
the Housing Commission. This build-
ing, formerly a city parking garage,
was acquired some years ago and alter-
ed for offices.
The Public Works Department is
calling tenders and expects the work
to be completed within two years.
The Housing Commission will use
six of the ten floors. Other Govern-
ment departments will be in the
balance.
An old landmark, The Temple
Court Hotel, on land 30ft. lOin. by
95ft. 9in., on the south-west corner
of Queen Street and Little Collins
Street, has been bought by the Ajax
Insurance Co. Ltd. Price paid was
£72,500.
The hotel has been closed and will
be demolished to make way for a limit

The Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd. re'
cently bought a building at 26 to 32
King Street, City, for use as offices
while a new building of eleven storeys
is built on its present site at 410 Cob
lins Street.
Bates, Smart and McCutcheon are
the architects for the new ten-storey
building to be erected on the east side
of Queen Street, just north of Bourke
Street. The site is portion of one of
the oldest blocks of small, two-storey
shops in Melbourne and is nearly op-
posite the Housing Commission build-
ing previously mentioned.
The building is for H. C. Sleigh
Limited. It is estimated to cost about
£300,000, and is expected to be com-
pleted within fifteen months.
Work is proceeding apace on the
building of the pedestrian subway from
the central entrance of the Flinders
Street Railway Station into DeGraves
Street. The Mutual Store Limited
have instructed Mr. Ronald J. Wilson,
architect, to call tenders for new stairs
in their building to provide direct
access to the subway.
It has been announced that the
Trustees of the Freemasons" Hospital
in East Melbourne have decided to
make additions to the building to pro-
vide a further 48 beds. The estimated
cost has been stated at £140,000.
Further work is to be carried out
immediately at St. Vincent’s Hospital.
The architects, Stephenson & Turner,
are inviting tenders for a large nurses’
home, the casualty and outpatients’
department and sisters’ home. sepa-
rate tenders are invited for lift instal-
lations in each of the buildings.
The Lewis Construction Co. Pty.
Ltd. has been awarded a contract by
H. L. and L. J. Coburn, architects,

The Dunlop Rubber Co. has pur-
chased a large area at Bayswater
about 20 miles out of the City for

ceeding with the erection of Army
training depots in the suburbs. Two
announced are at Murrumbeena and

The English, Scottish 6? Australian

Highlight of this Bank’s building
activity was the alteration of one of
its oldest branch buildings at the

tomers can drive up in their cars to
a teller’s window at the back of the
building.
The Australia and New Zealand

GOOD LIGHTING—GOOD
BUSINESS.
Business premises today use lighting—
decorative as well as utilitarian—as a
stimulus to impulse-buying. The public
likes to dine in dignified surroundings
and the restaurant here shown has a
redwood ceiling lighted by numerous
40-watt fluorescent lamps arranged in
a rectangular egg-crate, egg-box pattern
for its all-over design. Lighting Is one
of today's most important ingredients In
creating the looked for congenial at-
mosphere in the rush of modern life.

economy of space (the whole having been encompassed in an area of 28' x 18') there is a full-size

J. C. Taylor and Sons, builders,
have the contract for additions to the
wool store of Dennys, Lascelles Ltd.
at the corner of Gheringhap Street
and Brougham Place.
A Sydney company, Engar Pty.
Ltd., has purchased a site at 29 Malop
Street, Geelong, for a four - storey
office building.
Two insurance companies, the Com-
mercial Union Assurance Co. Ltd. and
the Victoria Insurance Co. Ltd., have
purchased the old Mechanics’ Institute
building in Moorabool Street, Gee-
long. Each will use half the site for
the erection of a new office building.
The Commonwealth Bank is calling
tenders for the erection of a new
branch premises at Ryrie St., Geelong.
The rapid expansion which has
taken place in some of the outer
suburbs has completely outstripped the
accommodation of the local municipal
office. The Shire of Mulgrave, until
a few years ago a completely rural
area, is now developing as a manufac-
turing centre at Clayton, on the main
Gippsland line, between Oakleigh and
Dandenong, and other centres. Much
building of homes has also taken place,
especially by the Housing Commission.
The Council has found it necessary
to replace the old shire office, situated
in an isolated position on one of the
main roads, with new offices at Spring
Vale and Glen Waverley. The office
of Harry A. Norris has this work in
hand.
The Shire of Eltham—another of
the developing outer areas—has sug-
gested to the professor of the School
of Architecture at Melbourne Univer-
sity that a “municipal block develop-
ment scheme” be made a project for
the students.
Under the supervision of Mr. H.
Vivian Taylor, architect, the work of
renovating the stonework and cleaning
the brickwork of the Collins Street
Independent Church has been com-
pleted. The general “clean-up” has
revealed the beauty of this interesting
example of the Venetian-Romanesque
style of architecture.
The church was built in 1866 at a
cost of £15,000, including the organ,
£3OOO. The recent renovation and
cleaning work cost about £15,000.
The Scots Church, on the opposite
corner of Collins and Russell Street,
has also had the whole of the exterior
cleaned and the two buildings now
are a credit to the city and the Church
authorities.
At St. Paul’s Cathedral the work of
installing a sprinkler system through-
out the Cathedral roof and the Chap-
ter House and Church offices has just
been completed. The fire, which start-
ed in the roof of the Wilson Hall at
the Melbourne University and which
resulted in its destruction, prompted
the Cathedral Chapter to provide some
protection to the Cathedral.
It is understood St. Paul’s is one of
the very few cathedrals in the world
which has this protection against fire
installed.
Another large factory project has
just been commenced on the Nepean
Highway at Highett, in the Munici-
pality of Moorabbin. It comprises a
building with an area of 55,000 sq. ft.
of floor space for the J. R. Watkins
Company of Minnesota, U.S.A. The
site has an area of six acres. The
building will be of steel frame con-
struction, with brick panel walls, and
a corrugated asbestos cement roof.
Architects ate Hugh Peck and Asso-
ciates and E. A, Watts Pty. Ltd. is
the builder.
Subject for the planning portion of
the Robert and Ada Haddon Travel-
ling Scholarship of the Royal Vic-
torian Institute of Architects this year
is a road transport freight terminal.
The master plan for Melbourne has set
aside an area of 20 acres on Dymon
Road, West Melbourne, as a site for
such a terminal. The competition calls
for planning this site.
For the examination for admission
to associate membership of the Royal
Victorian Institute of Architects, and
for registration by the Architects’
Registration Board, the subject for the
design section is a swimming pool for
a country town.
Dowd and Associates Pty. Ltd., of
Fitsroy, have purchased a site at East
Burwood for a new fac.ory.
The Housing Commission is to coni'
mence building homes on portion oi
the large area which it has “blanket'
ed” in the Shire of Broadmeadows
A figure of 1300 houses for the year
has been stated. Several large con'
tracts have been let recently for homes
in other areas and through the country.
For a long time the Housing Com-
mission would not consider the erec-
tion of blocks of flats. However, there
appears to be a change of policy, for
several contracts have been let for
groups of two'Storey flats, each with
from four to eight units. Some of
these are being built in the outer
suburbs.
Mr. Picton Hopkins, of Hawthorn,
Chairman of Directors of Picton
Hopkins and Son Pty. Ltd., fibrous
plaster manufacturers, who died last
September is reported to have left an
estate of £69,105 to his widow and

tered as a company—E. A. Watts Pty.

stand at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground and the erection of a new
concrete grandstand and structural ah
terations to other parts of the ground.
Architects are Arthur W. Purnell and
Associates.
Work has been commenced on the
addition of two storeys to the old
brick building known for many years
as Oxford Chambers in Bourke Street,
just west of Queen Street. The build'
ing was purchased some time ago by
one of the insurance companies and
Mr. C. M. Morgan, architect, re'
modelled the ground floor and some
of the upper floors. A new base was
given to the front of the building and
it was expected the whole front would
be remodelled in keeping. Unfor'
tunately, it appears that nothing is to
be done in this direction and the op'
portunity appears to be passing of
giving what could be a new building
to this important section of the city.
Despite the financial brake which
was put on hospital building work in
the suburbs and country late last year,
a few smaller works in country areas
are announced.
A. C. Leith, Bartlett and Partners
have called tenders for a new brick
nurses’ home at Cohuna.
Additions and alterations are to be
made to Nathalia District Hospital by
Robert S. Demaine and Associates.
Stephenson & Turner have called
tenders for a new operating block at
Wangaratta District Hospital and the
Public Works Department for new
nurses’ home and maternity unit at
Benalla.
The growing practice of doctors in
the suburbs to combine in partnerships
is resulting in the erection of medical
clinics and offices in a central position
rather than each doctor having a sur'
gery in a private residence . Bernard
Evans and Associates have such a
clinic under construction at Sandring'
ham and Armstrong and Orton at
Box Hill.
What looked like developing into a
major building upheaval during the
month was settled within a fortnight.
Workers on several jobs were demand'
ing, without the approval of their
union authorities, payments of up to
£2 a week in advance of award rates.
When this was refused they left several
big jobs. Master builders threatened
to reduce the number employed on all
jobs by 10 per cent, unless work was
resumed. This action, fortunately, was
not necessary.
Six-Storey
“No-Fines” Flats
New Birmingham Block.
The first block of the 180 “No'
Fines” six'Storey flats has been built
at Tile Cross, Birmingham, by George
Wimpey 6? Co. Ltd. for the City
Council.
“No-Fines” Construction.
“No'Fines” means that all sand and
fine stones are omitted from the ag'
gregate so that the wall is cellular in
construction.
The still air trapped in the voids of
such a wall gives it good thermal in'
sulation and, in addition, these voids
prevent the wall becoming damp by
the process of capillary attraction.
The fundamental factor that led to
the development of the Wimpey “No'
Fines” technique was the appreciation
of the fact that the omission of the
fines from the concrete avoided the
hydrostatic pressures of normal dense
concrete, and, in addition, the even
grading prevented the disintegration
of the mix when poured from a
height.
The use of large size shutter units
is thus possible. The contractors
often handle shutters 60ft. long as
one piece, and in other cases 25ft.
high, poured from the top.
The lesser pressures these shutters
have to withstand, together with the
absence of slurry in the concrete, have
allowed the adoption of open mesh
facing on light timber framing.
Special plant has been selected and
designed to allow the mechanised
handling of the shuttering and scaf'
fold platforms.
Up to three'Storey structures, the
buildings are poured at one operation,
the walls being load bearing. Four'
storey flats are poured in two opera'
tions, using the intermediate floor as
diaphragm bracing allowing the wall
stills to remain load bearing. Build'
ings with a greater height than four
storeys have a reinforced concrete
frame introduced.
Concrete Mix Used.
The mix being used consists of 1
cwt. cement to 10 cubic feet of aggre'
gate (approximately 1 : 8 by volume).
The type of aggregate varies with
Tower crane handling concrete skip during pouring operation.

the district; that at nresent being used
at Birmingham is washed river ballast
to pass a fin. sieve with not more
than 10 per cent, passing a fin. sieve.
Increased thermal insulation could be
obtained by the use of clinker or
crushed brick, but the difficulty re-
mains of ensuring that such material
is inert. R value is 0.19, thus a I2in.
“No'Fines” wall rendered externally
and plastered internally has a U value
of approximately 0.30, being equiva'
lent to llin. cavity brickwork.
Tower Crane Used.
The tower crane used on the six'
storey flats had a fixed horizontal jib
with traversing saddle. Its big ad'
vantage is that in spite of size it is
self'erecting, and travelling on rails
under its own power can readily move
from block to block as required.
All electric, it can execute all
motions simultaneously if required
viz., hoist, slew, traverse saddle and
travel.
As erected, the height under the
hook is 98ft. 6in. With an addh
tional mast section this can be in'
creased to a maximum of 112 ft. lOin.
By removing one or two sections the
height can be correspondingly re'
duced.

PLANNED HOUSE BUILDING
SAVES MAN-HOURS.
British Building Research set out in
a production run of 32 houses on a
programme that would take full ad-
vantage of the shells being erected
with a mobile tower crane, leaving in-
ternal operations and site works to
keep in step. As a result about 1000
man-hours per house were saved. Not
only was this saving made but the
overall time was cut down and even
in bad winter weather there was little
or no slowing up of the work,
A ring of oil refineries is being
built or planned around the shores
adjacent to the Indian Ocean. The
string begins with the new project
at Kwinana, Western Australia, which
is expected to have an annual intake
of 3 million tons of crude oil. Two
refineries are planned for Bombay, 3f
million tons capacity. In Kuwait (Per'
sian Gulf) 3f million tons; Aden. 5
million tons; Kenya, 3 million tons;
Durban, 3/4 million tons.

EARLY COLLABORATION
OF CONTRACTOR, ARCHITECT
AND QUANTITY SURVEYOR
MEANS HIGHER EFFICIENCY.
R.1.8.A. President’s Views.
“It has been suggested that the
answer to highly efficient design and
building is early collaboration between
architect, builder, engineer and quan-
tity surveyor. I believe this to be
true, particularly for large or compli-
cated buildings. At least one public
authority is trying out a pilot scheme
along these lines, and we will surely
find that others will investigate this
method, which does not necessarily
preclure competition.”
This statement was made recently
by the President of the Royal Institute
of British Architects, Mr. Howard
Robertson, during his address at the
Institute’s inaugural meeting of 1953'
1954 session.
He did not believe, however, that
the American type of “package ser-
vice,” with everything provided, in'
eluding design, would be the ultimate
answer in this country. After a time
the “package” would be found, like
certa Christmas hampers, to include in'
creasingly some things which were not
too good. Since all service must be
paid for somehow, he saw no real
reason for not selecting the best of
each in the open market, which was
the basis of the present system.
“Efficient collaboration in all sec'
tions of our works is, I am sure, the
best answer to efficient design and
supervision,” said Mr. Robertson.
“Specialist consultants have a great
and growing contribution to make,
and if they were of no use, they would
soon cease to exist. No trade firm
can quite replace them, and the fact
that they are kept hard at work from
beginning to end of complicated jobs
shows that for these they are really
required.
“A great deal of work, in terms of
money, may be represented by con'
sultants’ work in a large contract. A
heavy responsibility therefore lies at
their door, in the effort to reduce the
cost of building, by an ever-increasing
efficiency and constant regard for the
clients’ pocket—and there one is as-
suming that the best consultant needs
no reminding of this fact.”
Master Builders’
Organisations.
Mr. Robertson went on to say:
“ ‘Master builders’ to-day are teams
of men embracing many departments.
The architect is at their services, if
they want him. No single man in the
master builder firms knows everything

Continued from previous page
about the job. The strength of such
firms, apart from their finance, is the
quality of the directors and the em-
ployees. These firms are business or-
ganisations that build. It is their life-
time job, and it takes all their time.
They are not fitted to do architects’
work, and they know it. No more
can architects do their work. Design-
ing and planning and supervising are
one thing, and the great organisations
employing labour for erection are
another. Only people unfamiliar with
what actually occurs, and must occur,
in building practice, could confuse the
two issues, apart perhaps from
dreamers who are bemused by the lure
of the very words ‘master builder’ and
the visions they conjure up.
Architects’ Technical
Knowledge.
“To turn to the point of the archi-
tect and his adequate technical know-
ledge, the real facts are that no single
architect could possibly retain, even if
he could absorb, the full range of
present-day techniques. But the archi-
tect, vis-a-vis his client, is a man with
a balanced firm behind him. In that
architect’s house are many architects of
varied qualifications. That is where
the strength lies, exactly as it does with
the builders.
“It is perfectly fair to say that aa
active practising architect to'day knows
as much about technology as any
human brain can hold witho it risk of
stultifying imagination. It is. broadly,
a certainty that excessive factual cram-
ming is a deterrent to creation. And
even some of the most imaginative
engineers are men who have willingly
become a little hazy over detail and
calculations. But they have the great
ability to spot what is fundamental,
and go for first things first. That i»
what a good architect should do and
does, and it is in fact the key to the
success of many of the greater names
in architecture to'day namely, an
ability in certain fundamental direc'
tions, the awareness of their own limi'
tations, and the capacity to engage
qualified collaborators.
Similarity of Contemporary
Buildings.
“I feel that our contemporary build'
ings for all sorts of purposes risk to
become too much alike in their expres-
sion; the same formula for design, em-
ploying the same motives, basic forms,
and treatement of facade in mass and
detail is widely applied to all prob-
lems.
“Of course, variations of treatment
exist in plenty, and size and bulk play
their part. But, broadly speaking, the
buildings for various purposes are get-
ting to resemble each other astonish'
ingly, and so is the work of many
architects whose basic thinking is on
rational parallel lines.
“This applies both to the neo-
Georgians and the extremists. Each
in their category are acquiring the
family face. In many architectural
schools the same thing happens, but
to a more extreme degree; though, of
course, the neo'Georgian trend is in
many of the schools practically non'
existent.
“Through over'stressing of engineer'
ing, false pride in structure, over'
anxiety to follow my latest leader, re'
luctance to draw upon the great and
rich vocabulary of form and surface
of the past, we risk to produce an
architecture which will finally cease to
attract the public, and will be respect'
ed chiefly for its neatness and tidiness
the very qualities which can be
found in a well'designed mechanism.
Fine qualities, but in architecture in'
sufficient.
