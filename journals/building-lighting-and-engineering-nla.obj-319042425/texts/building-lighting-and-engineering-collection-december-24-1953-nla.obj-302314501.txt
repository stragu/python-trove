FOJ? PROTECTION
FOR PR ESER VR TION
FOR HIGH REFLECTIVITY
Almost every surface that is exposed to corrosion by salt atmos-
pheres, or the smoke and acidity of industrial regions, can be
protected and preserved by the superior resistant power of
"Alpaste” Aluminium Paint.
"Alpaste” is an aluminium paint pigment in paste form which,
whilst avoiding the drawbacks of powder pigment, retains such
durable propert.es as "leafing” and high reflectivity. In addition, So„T Wat
Alpaste gives more complete opacity (a layer of only 1/2,000th '
of an inch thick will completely obscure the underlying surface,
however dark and dreary). Moreover, "Alpaste” gives 10% to
20% greater coverage power.
"Alpaste” is recommended as a preservative for wood, brickwonc,
concrete, aluminium, steel, magnesium, plaster, stucco and asphalt.
Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste”
Paint Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium which, when
mixed with a suitable medium, "leaf” and form an opaque and durable metallic shield. Moreover,
Alpaste s high reflectivity and low heat absorption factor help to maintain a temperate interior
wherever it is used externally.

r
HIS 18-ton 60 ft. span overhead travelling
crane plays an important part in the manu-
facture of large steel pipes at a New South Wales
industrial plant. Operating on a 150 ft. runway,
this cabin controlled crane handles bulky loads
quickly and efficiently.
Moore overhead travelling cranes are being applied
to manufacturing processes in almost every im-
portant industry in the Commonwealth.
Standard cranes, arranged for floor, cabin, or
combined floor and cabin control, are available in
a wide range of spans and capacities to suit all
classes of service. Industrialists are finding that
it pays to install Overhead Travelling Cranes by
Moore—Australia’s largest crane manufacturers.
■
ADVANTAGES OF
AN OVERHEAD
TRAVELLING CRANE
• Takes up no floor space
• Permits maximum use of
the working or storage area.
• Storage space can be
measured in cubic feet instead
of square feet.
• Elevates and conveys at the
same time.
• Will pick up an item from
anywhere, lift and carry it over
all intervening material, lower
and place it under perfect
control wherever required.
• Handles loads of practically
any size, bulk or length with
equal ease.

EDITORIAL.
Christmas Eberlasting
Christmas comes but once a year—so goes the old saying. True,
but as long as Christendom continues to celebrate this most sacred and
happy event in its calendar —and pauses to realise its full significance—all
will be well with the world.
How many people to-day really do stop to reflect on the true meaning
of Christmas, and how many teach their children the real significance of
the feasting and rejoicing? Christmas is really a unique experience, a
gigantic upsurge of emotion that affects even the stoniest of hearts, as
Charles Dickens has immortally typified in old Scrooge.
While we in Australia bask in the sunshine and enjoy plenty of
everything, there are still millions throughout the world to whom
Christmas is just another day of existence to be dragged out. Do we
ever stop to count our blessings? No war devastation, bounteous seasons,
work for all who want it —Australia Felix indeed!
This happy handful of 8,000,000 have great blessings and great
responsibilities, for ours is the task of developing and populating this
vast continent —if we don't want others whose skin may be of different
hue and to whom Christmas has no significance, to do it for us.
It can be done if we all wish strongly enough that it should. A
divided people will not achieve it; or an indolent people; but it can
easily be done if we all do a reasonable day's work, no matter whether
it be hewing coal, directing a business, or raising a family. And the
rewards are great for us and our progeny.
When the beer has flowed and the plum pudding has done its
worst, let us think a little of this great season of rejoicing and go forth,
each in our little orbit, better people for having enjoyed yet another
Christmas and determined to be worthy of this great blessing.
★
The Editor and Staff of Building Publishing Co. Pty. Ltd., publishers
of “Building: Lighting: Engineering," “The Australasian Engineer" and
“Construction," appreciate the cordial relations that have existed during
the year with their many readers and advertisers and wish to convey their
best wishes for a Happy Christmas and a Healthful and Prosperous New
Year.

Royal Newcastle Hospital
THE NEW WILFRID NICKSON WING.
Increases Hospital Capacity to 530 Beds.
Architects: Stephenson 8C Turner.
The new building at the Royal
Newcastle Hospital, that has recently
been completed, is to be known as the
“Wilfrid Nickson’’ Wing. It has ac'
commodation for 280 patients, and will
increase the capacity of the hospital
to 530 beds.
Construction of the building was
carried out by the hospital’s own
building organisation which was built'
up as necessary, while numerous sub'
contractors were also employed.
The building consists generally of
a steel frame, reinforced concrete
floors and brick partitions, and ex'
ternal panel walls.
Protection of Steelwork.
The contract for the supply and
erection of the structural steel frame'
work —approximately 900 tons, was
let to Messrs. James Mullan Pty. Ltd.,
of Newcastle, all steel before erection
being sand'blasted and shop coated to
guard against the excessive corrosion
prevalent in Newcastle, and was then
given one extra field coat before be'
ing encased.
In this building large wards have
disappeared, most of the new wards
being arranged in groups of four pa'
tients, for privacy and nursing con'
venience, and each opens on to a bah
cony. Private rooms for medical, sur'
gical and maternity patients have prh
vate sections of these balconies. There
are approximately 50 beds on each
ward floor divided into three nursing
units.
Functions of each floor from the
ground up will be:
The basement accommodates steam,
hot water, radiation, refrigeration
equipment and pumps. On this level
also is a Council electrical substation
incorporated in the building, as well
as an emergency diesel generating set
for the hospital’s use, also the ent'
trance to tunnel which connects ad'
joining buildings.
On the lower ground floor is the
kitchen overlooking Newcastle Beach,
staff cafeteria, visiting medical and lay'
staff sitting rooms all opening on to a
sunken garden. The kitchen is de-
signed to serve the whole hospital and
is controlled by the dietary staff.
Food is by tray service from the ward
pantries on each floor and is served
by maids under Dietitians’ control. On

this floor there is also a large garage
provided for the servicing and care
of hospital vehicles, which is fitted out
with the most modern equipment for
the purpose.
Main entrance and gynaecological
wards are on the ground floor, while
on the first, third and fourth are the
medical and surgical treatment wards.
Operating Theatres.
Six air-conditioned operating
theatres with anesthetising rooms and
change rooms for medical and nurs-
ing staff, also a lecture room for gen-
eral hospital use are located on the
second floor. On this floor is also
situated a Central Sterilising Depart-
ment designed to handle all sterilising
for the whole hospital and is under
the control of specially trained staff.
Fifth, sixth and seventh floors ac-
commodate maternity wards and nurs-
eries, while on the eighth floor are
ventilating, air-conditioning equip-
ment. other machinery, water storage
tanks and lift equipment. From this
level ductwork exhaust and plenum
systems serve all the necessary areas,
including delivery and birth room,
kitchen, service rooms, and other
parts of the new building.
The lifts are the most modern
available, designed for manual or col-
lective automatic control, with stain-
less steel fronts and doors.
280 Patients.
The total accommodation of the
new wing is 280 patients which is
made up of the following; 20 separ-
ate private beds; 112 intermediate
beds; 148 public beds.
The building is equipped through-
out with fluorescent lighting especially
designed for the conditions, and each
ward-bed is provided with a special
spot-light for reading and examination
of patients, which is incorporated in
the main light fitting on the walls over
the beds.
Elaborate Services.
In addition, the building is wired
throughout for 3-channel radio re-
ception and is provided with self-cor-
recting electric clocks, staff paging
system, inter-communication units, il-
luminated directory board and doc-
tors’ and staff registers. Fire alarm
equipment in accordance with Fire
Underwriters’ Regulations is installed
and is connected direct to the nearest
fire station so that if a fire breaks
out the Fire Brigade are warned as
soon, if not sooner, than the occu-
pants of the building.
Throughout the building terrazzo
and ironite floors have been used, laid
direct on the concrete —this serves a
double purpose. They are easy to
clean and need no waxing or polishing,
and therefore greatly reduce the haz-

AUSTRALIA’S LARGEST
TERRAZZO CONTRACT.
Royal Newcastle Hospital.
Melocco Bros. Pty. Ltd.
We are advised by Melocco Bros.
Pty. Ltd., who carried out the con-
tract that the Nickson Wing of the
Royal Newcastle Hospital, is the larg-
est terrazzo iob carried out in Aus-
tralia, with a total area of close on to
10.000 square yards of specially toned
terrazzo. It was used in corridors,
all wards, offices, amenities, bathroom
and lavatory section, main staircase in-
clusive of baluster kerbs and treads
and risers. All the paving has been
laid utilising either brass or aluminium
divider strips with the exception of
the elevator lobbies which on all floors
had the paving divided into large
squares not exceeding 2’6” x 2’6” laid
in chequer pattern with alternative
Mudgee green marble and the filling
squares were in grey-green terrazzo to
harmonise with the marble, thus creat-
ing a soft grey-green almost carpet ef-
fect, very pleasing to the eye and at
the same time giving the most sani-
tary surface available, which is so es-
sential to a hospital.
Jointless Surface.
Terrazzo was chosen for its joint-
less surface, which is recognised as
the ideal floor for hospitals. The
choice of colour toning, as is well
known, is without any limitation and
goes from a pure snow white through
all the pastel shades to a jet black.
In the Newcastle Hospital, the one
tone chosen practically dominates all
paving work—a soft grey-green shade
with a faint touch of golden grey
marble chips to relieve a certain
amount of similarity. Although pleas-
ant in itself, the addition of the gold-
en grey chips used in moderation has
produced an interest of which one
never tires. The same tones apply to
the stair with the added advantage
of a coved riser at the rear of all
treads.
Saving in Maintenance.
In America it has been proved that
the floor maintenance of terrazzo for
such buildings as hospitals is less than
a quarter of the cost of any other pav-
ing. When cost of upkeep is taken
into consideration, the saving at the
end of the year for a large hospital,
such as the Royal Newcastle Hospital,
would run into a very large amount,
and over a period of many years rep-
resents a colossal figure in hospital
maintenance. This applies not only to
hospitals but all large buildings em-
ploying maintenance staff so that ter-
razzo is by far the cheaper floor in
the long run.
All lavatory and bathroom division-
al slabs are in terrazzo of a warm gold-
en tone, while Travertine was success-
fully used on the walls of the main en-
trance.
Paving to balconies is in ironite lin-
ed out in squares, finished in green
colour with a coved border coloured
black, stained and polished.
The selection of terrazzo as an over-
all paving on so important a job
speaks volumes for the foresight of
the Architects and Hospital author-
ities, who must have based their confi-
dence on what had been seen overseas,
especially in America, and accordingly
chose terrazzo as the most successful
medium to treat the pavings where hy-
gienic properties are so essential.
Galvanised Iron
Still Short
Although Annual Production Up.
Although the production of gaivan-
ised iron in Australia is at a record
level, there is still a delay in deliveries
of from five to six months, the Min-
ister for National Development, Sen-
ator O’Sullivan, said recently.
The present production level was
3 300 tons a week, or about 160,000
tons per annum, compared with
150.000 tons in 1952-53, and 89,000
tons in 1951-52.
At present, imports of galvanised
iron are permitted at a level of 50%
of those in the base year 1950-51.
Recently, special licenses have been
granted increasing importers’ quotas.
Although every possible assistance
is being given to manufacturers, it
appears that further increases will be
necessary in these special licenses.

CORPUS CHRISTI CHURCH
MONA VALE ROAD, ST. IVES, SYDNEY.
STRIKING MODERN CHURCH.
Architects;

Builders:
M. 8C R. Velo.
This small new church, which is
refreshing in its simplicity and gener'
ous use of colour, had the initial ad'
vantage of a very pleasant site with a
background of gum trees and adjacent
to the charm of Orchard Grove and
Camellia Grove Nurseries.
An effective architectural shape was
obtained by the use of three pinned
arch structural steel frames consisting
of 12” by 5” R.S.J.’s with a pinned
connection at the base being provid'
ed by a narrow bearing strip set in a
concrete pedestal, the footings being
offset to balance the outward thrust
of the arch. These frames were pre'
fabricated in two sections and when in
position were bolted together at the
ridge. Normal angle bracing is pro'
vided at the ridge and eaves.
The Sanctuary.
The ceiling follows the line of the
structural arch to the Sanctuary which
has a flat ceiling incorporating a curv'
ed canopy over the Tabernacle sur-
rounded bv glass lights which permits
natural light to illuminate and high'
light the Altar during the day while
concealed fluorescent tubes are used
for night lighting.
The Sanctuary is the focal point
with a modern type Altar in polished
Silver Ash with the rear wall strongly
coloured to emphasise a Wombeyan
Marble reredos to which is fixed a
wrought iron crucifix. On either side
of the reredos are paterae with bright'
ly coloured symbols depicting the
Eucharist.
Modern Facade.
The main front to Mona Vale Road
depends on proportions and colour
masses for its striking appeal. A
strong hood provides shelter to the em
trance doorways and is supported by
a curved wall of smokey-blue. Ad'
jacent is a texture brick feature to
house an electric bell, while the three
light plate glass window over the en
trance is sandblasted and coloured—
the motif being Corpus Christi —from
which the Church derives its name.
Bright Colour.
Colour has been used extensively.
Internally the colours are peach and
a soft blue with accent walls in smok-
ey'blue and prairie rose, windows in
antique white and doors in colony
blue. Externally the off'white walls
and orange texture bricks are offset
with skyline blue to eaves, mayfair
blue to gutters and white woodwork
with yellow trims.
The new Church is a fine example
of how buildings in tune with modern
times and employing progressive struct'
ural principles can, in the hands of
competent designers, using the re*
straint born of nature, experience, and
without the aid of current architectural
histronics, produce buildings of real
beauty and lasting utility.
OH OUR COVER
THE DIGNIFIED ARCH.
There is a dignity about the arched
opening that is quite distinctive. The
Romans lived its form and developed
it to its highest peak both from the
utilitarian and decorative aspect, while
it blossomed again in Romanesque and
Renaissance. Today it is again in de-
cline in popular favour against the pres-
sure of the modern trabeated, flat sur-
face form but as long as man builds
the arch with its sweeping grace will
stir his imagination. The upper colon-
nade is the entrance portico to the
Footscray Town Hall, Victoria (J. Plottel,
architect) while below is the facade of
the University Club, Sydney (architects,
Kent & Massie). [The complete facade
of the Club and the columns and enrich-
ment are Wunderlich architectural terra
cotta.]

STRATH FIELD GIRLS’ HIGH SCHOOL
SPACIOUS NEW SYDNEY SCHOOL.
Architect:
Government Architect of N.S.W.
Master Builders:
Hutcherson Bros. Pty. Ltd.
This new High School was recent'
ly completed on a site in the centre
of a residential area and has its main
frontage to Albert Road and its rear
frontage to Oxford Road. These two
streets are secondary only and do not
carry heavy business traffic to make
access to the school dangerous.
The accommodation consists of
twelve general classrooms chemistry
laboratory, science demonstration
room, arts and crafts room and a
home science section consisting of a
large demonstration kitchen, laundry
and two sewing and fitting rooms. A
well equipped library is included, hav-
ing fluorescent lighting and complete
with Librarian’s Office and work room.
The main assembly hall has a sep'
arate main entrance for the public
fronting Albert Road and in addition
to school musical and dramatic func'
tions and gymnasium work it will be
available for public functions control!'
ed by the Parents and Citizens’ Asso'
ciation of the school. The auditorium
is 70’ x 40’, the stage 40’ x 20’, and
the hall is equipped with a film pro'
jection gallery, mechanical ventilation
and black-out window curtains. Dress'
ing rooms and toilet and lavatory fa'
cilities are conveniently located next
to the stage.
Dental and Medical Clinic.
The pupils are well catered for in
the matter of tuck shop, shelter and
toilet facilities, whilst a special clinic
is provided for dental and medical ex'
aminations. The administrative unit
contains offices for the Head Mistress,
Deputy Head Mistress and School
Counsellor and Clerks. Staff common
rooms and toilet facilities are provid'
ed on each floor.
The buildings are two storeys in
height constructed of brick bearing
walls on reinforced concrete footings,
and have roofs of Wunderlich Dura'
bestos corrugated asbestos cement.
The ground floors are generally of tim'
ber construction and upper floors are
of concrete slab with superimposed
timber flooring, sanded and oiled.
Exterior Finish.
The exterior finish is colour washed
common brickwork, white painted
joinery and coloured roofing. Em'
phasis is placed on the entrance by the
use of contrasting coloured cement
rendered features. The effective use
of colour is a keynote of interior treat'
ment, and contrasting colours are used
on blackboard end walls.
The building contractors for the
work were Hutcherson Bros. Pty. Ltd.,
and the final cost of the work was
£181,887.
GRAINING AND PAINTING.
Useful New Book.
Graining and Painting (including
Marbling) by John W. Derrett, is a
useful little book of 46 pages publish'
ed by Evans Brothers Ltd., London,
illustrating in a wealth of detail these
skilled arts, which in view of the fact
that of recent years their popularity
has somewhat waned, could perhaps
easily become a lost art.
It does not, however, confine itself
to these more erudite skills of the
painter but very clearly explains the
rudiments of painting technique for in
spite of the tendency for everybody
who purchases a pot of paint and a
brush and tackling a bit of house
painting, considering that they know
all the answers, it is a very skilled
craft. It’s a good 6A worth for any'
one who wants to learn to improve
his work.

New Cement Handling System
BRITISH METHOD SAVES 21/- PER TON.
A new system of bulk cement handl-
ing for small sites was recently de-
monstrated in England. It was claim-
ed to save up to 21/- per ton of
cement.
Basically, the equipment consists of
a modern 30 m.p.h. 7-ton capacity
cement tanker and a fully portable 10-
ton capacity site silo complete with
batch weighing device (see illustra-
tion).
The tanker incorporates twin pres-
surised aluminium alloy containers de-
signed for pneumatic delivery to silos
on the site. It can also elevate cement
to heights in excess of 40ft. if neces-
sary. No elevating equipment or
source of power is called for on the
site as the tanker carries its own en-
gine-driven compressor.
Site Storage.
The site storage system is based on
an original form of resin bonded lam-
inated wood silo of 10 tons capacity.
Total weight, including semi-automatic
batch-weighing and delivery equip-
ment, is little more than 11 cwt.
Fully portable, it can be moved from
place to place on the site, as it is de-
signed for man-handling.
Under normal conditions, the mak-
ers claim, one cement tanker can usu-
ally keep several silos supplied with
cement on various sites in a given
area.
Developed specifically for the 7/5
and 10/7 sises of concrete mixer, the
equipment makes possible a 21/- per
ton saving. The cement gets com-
plete weather protection until the
semi-automatic dispenser discharges it
into the mixer hopper.
The sales and future development
of the system is being handled by
The Portasilo Co. of Blue Bridge Lane,
Yorkshire.
VORACIOUS FURNACES.
The Newcastle Steel Works open
hearth furnaces are voracious consume
ers of raw materials. In producing
900,000 tons of steel ingots over a
12'month period the following ingred'
ients were devoured: pig iron, 663,000
tons; steel scrap, 311,400 tons; iron-
stone, 91,200 tons; limestone,
65,100 tons; Recarburisers, 5700 tons.

9ft. 6in. wide and 11ft. high over the
rear spotlight. Fitted with two engine
driven fire pumps deliverying 7,200 galls,
of foam a minute. The Foam Solution
Tank has a capacity of 500 galls, and
will last 10 minutes at maximum output
of foam. This huge vehicle is so fully
Instrumentalised that the control panel
with its mass of dials and gauges, looks
almost like the cockpit of a modern jet
airliner. A trailer will be fitted to the
tender to carry an additional 500 gallons
of Foam Solution; a pump will transfer
the solution to the main tender. Maxi-
mum road speed of the unit is 34 miles
per hour and when fully equipped, it
carries suction and delivery hoses, water
directors and foam making nozzles.

THE SCOTTISH HALL-CHURCH.
The dictates of economy and high build-

ment in Scotland of what is now known
as the "Hall Church"—one building
which can be used as a multi-purpose
Hall for six days, and the House of
God, with all dignity and amenity pos-
sible, on the seventh. The limitations of
dual-purpose accommodation and re-
stricted cost spur the imagination and
bring in their train as further factors,
simplicity of design and construction,
economy in choice of material, and the
ruthless elimination of the unnecessary.
The available elements of expression are
form and colour. We illustrate a recent
example at West Pilton, and below, a
view of the Sanctuary. The dual function
is operated by having a stage at one
end of the hall and the Sanctuary and
Vestry at the other, this being cut off
from the hall by folding doors and only
used when the hall is functioning as a

FIRE RESISTANCE
OF PRESTRESSED CONCRETE.
International Congress Report.
At the initial technical session of
the International Federation of Pre-
stressing in London in October, Mr.
A. W. Hill, of Great Britain, present'
ed his report on the influence of ab-
normal temperatures on prestressed
concrete.
He referred to the contribution sub'
mitted by the Director of the Fire
Research Station at Elstree which gave
a detailed summary of the work car-
ried out there on prestressed concrete,
and this was supplemented by pub-
lished reports and details of tests un-
dertaken at Elstree for special flooring
manufacturers in this country. He
also submitted for discussion a review
of the work carried out under the
British Standard test condiitons.
During his report, Mr. Hill said:
“The doubts which have at various
times been cast on the ability of pre-
stressed concrete construction to pro-
vide the degree of fire resistance now
required by the by-laws have no doubt
been partly due to the absence of
published data on actual tests carried
out.
Vital Fire Research.
“This new form of construction,
which has developed at a very rapid
rate since the war, has outstripped re-
search in some respects ,and this is
especially true in the field of research
into its fire-resisting properties. Facili-
ties for such research are extremely
limited, but the work which is rapidly
nearing completion at the Fire Re-
search Station at Elstree is of out-
standing value in the development of
prestressed concrete.
“It is proving that prestressed con-
crete can be suitably designed to with-
stand the normal requirements for fire
resistance in buildings, and we must
look forward to the time when the
permissible forms and sizes of con-
struction for prestressed concrete have
been detailed in the by-laws, side by
side with the other forms of construc-
tion, and will be accepted for com
struction work everywhere.
“At the present time we have avail-
able test results on most of the pre-
stressed concrete flooring units and
systems used in this country, and in
addition the extensive series of tests
on the post-tensioned beams indicate
that positive recommendations for
structural elements requiring up to
two hours fire resistance could now be
made. It is hoped that this will fol-
low the receipt of the confirmation
required by the American tests.
Four-hour Fire Resistance.
“We have ,of course, still to deal
with four-hour fire resistance, and de-
cide whether this can be provideu
effectually and economically without
special protective coverings. We
know that it can be provided with

HOUSE-BUILDING IN AUSTRALIA
“OWNER-BUILDER" A THREAT TO BUILDING INDUSTRY.
The “Australian Financial Review,”
in its issue of December 3, states that
the Building Industry is challenged by
owner-builders.
This is a challenge which the in-
dustry cannot ignore, the journal adds.
It defines owner-builders as those
who do not contract with master build-
ers for the erection of their homes.
In 1952-53 they completed as many
private homes as builders. When
Government sponsored housing is in-
cluded they commenced 39% of all
homes, completed 37% and at June
30 last, were completing 60% of all
homes under construction in Aus-
tralia.
(The “Review” apparently regards
all builders in business on their own
account as master builders. A large
number of these builders are not mem-
bers of a Master Builders’ Associa-
tion, and are thus not Master Build-
ers bound to the Code of ‘ Correct
Business Practice,” as is the case of
Builder-members of Australian Mast-
er Builders’ Associations.
(The Rules of the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W. defines a
“Master Builder” as follows:
“The term ‘Master Builder’ where-
ever used in these Rules shall be taken
to mean, and shall mean, any Builder
who is qualified by training to control
and direct every branch of the build-
ing trade.”
On election, every member of the
M.B.A. signs a copy of the Associa-
tion’s Rules.
Section 5, clause 3 of the M.B.A.
of N.S.W. Code of Correct Business
Practice reads:
“In order that the Code of Correct
Practice of the Master Builders’ As-
sociation of N.S.W. may be of value,
not only to the Association, but to
the individual Members and the Public
generally, an obligation is placed
upon every Member to fearlessly and
faithfully perform the duties and prac-
tices set forth.)
In its analysis of the position the
article states that the owner-builder
was the product of the post-war build-
ing boom, when costs soared and
master builders could not or would
not quote firm prices or indicate a like-
ly completion date.
As a result, a great many homeseek-
ers secured scarce materials and equally
scarce skilled labour and attended to
the 101 technicalities involved in hav-
ing a house built.
A number actually did all or part
of the unskilled and sometimes the
skilled orking of building a house, the
article adds.
Home-Building Figures.
Quoting figures supplied by the Di-
vision of Industrial Development for
October, the “Review” prints the De-
partment’s comment:
Private housebuilding consists of
that carried out by building contract-
ors. and that by owner-builders who
do not use the services of a builder
and usually make minimum demands
on skilled tradesmen.
Together they have been complet-
ing between 55,000 and 60,000 houses
a year for the last three years. But
owner-builders have been gaining on
contractors.
Serious Competitor.
In 1950-51 they built about one
house for each two private houses
completed by builders in Australia.
In 1951-52 the ratio was about 100 to
135, and last year owner-builders com-
pleted as many private houses as
builders.
GLASS CHURCH.
This Wayfarers' Chapel at Palas Verde,
in Southern California, built mostly of
glass, is an arresting landmark on the
west of a high headland. From interior
window-boxes ferns and other foliage
invade the nave, enhancing the open-
air illusion of the building.
THE OPEN BELFREY.
The open type of campanile or belfrey is becoming rather popular in some of the
new churches designed in the contemporary style as illustrated in this example of
All Saints Church, Darlaston, Staffordshire (right) for which the architects were
Lavender, Twentyman & Percy. It has been built over the huge bomb crater that
destroyed the former church on the site. On the left is a view of the interior
which has a capacity of 352.

Owner-building has, therefore, be-
come a serious competitor of the
building industry in house-building.
Prospects for the building industry
hinge largely on its ability to attract
demand from prospective home-build-
ers.
Despite the return to housebuilding,
good supplies of nearly all building
materials and fittings, a more stable
and efficient labour force and quick-
er completion times, contractors are
losing more than one-third of house-
building business to owner-builders.
Fewer Houses.
The article says that the expected
increase in Government - sponsored
housing this year —only a small part
of Government housing is now carried
out by day labour- —but it is doubtful
whether this will offset the encroach-
ment of owner-builders. It is a long
time since the industry had so few
houses under construction on its
hands. (Houses being built at the
end of September totalled 71,922,
compared with 70,891 at the end of
Tune, but no indication is given of
the ratio of owner-builders to contract-
ors.)
Increase Unlikely.
The Department of Industrial De-
velopment, in its survey, points out
that although an adequate aggregate
housebuilding rate was maintained up
to last lune, it was heavily dependent
upon owner-building and the large
volume of work in progress that had
accumulated in the earlier post-war
period. The achievement of nearly
160,000 dwellings erected in two years
—20,000 to 30*000 more than Aus-
tralia’s new housing requirements in
that period— must be discounted by
the knowledge that the housebuilding
industry is in poor shape to meet com-
petition from owner-builders and is
itself ill-equipped to deal with the
problem of costs which, along with
the terms of institutional finance, will
largely determine its future.
A marked increase in home-build-
ing demand, therefore, appears unlike-
ly under present conditions.
In 1952-53, 79,236 houses and flats
were built in Australia—only slightly
less than in 1951-52. There was a
fall in dwellings put under construc-
tion from 81,812 in 1951-52 to 65,512
in 1952-53. The high completion
rate was maintained largely owing to
the volume of work in progress at
the beginning of 1952-53. It is likely
that Government-sponsored housing
will provide the best part of 30,000
dwellings in 1953-54.
Non-Residentxal Work.
Official figures indicate that there
was greatly-increased activity in non-
residential work during 1952-53. New
buildings (other than houses and
flats) completed in that year were
valued at £66.000,000 or 68% more
than in 1951'52.
It may be significant that there was
a sharp increase in local building ap-
provals for commercial and industrial
construction in the December quarter
of 1952-53, which suggests that stable
building costs have induced stronger
demand.
Several Factors.
Summing up, the journal cites sev-
eral factors operating to postpone the
accumulated demand for commercial
buildings.
Whereas finance is almost the only
curb on housebuilding, other new
building is subject to limitation by
high building costs, lack of business
reserves to meet the great cost of new
buildings, doubt about the earning
capacity of costly new buildings and
rent control.
These factors, the article continues,
apply most forcefully, of course, to
buildings for letting—such as blocks
of offices—interest in which is at a low
level.
Even if rent controlling authorities
permitted a rent that would return an
attractive profit in comparison with
other investment opportunities, there
are doubts as to the ability of invest-
ors to find tenants willing to pay the
greatly increased rents.
The loss to new building construc-
tion of some 26,000 men in two
years —one-fifth of the labour force in
September, 1951—give an indication
of the readjustments that have been
forced on the building industry by
the lower demand for its service, the
“Review” adds.
RHODES CENTENARY
EXHIBITION.
The centrepiece of the recent
Rhodes Centenary Exhibition at Bub
awayo. South Africa, was a massive
block of coal, 15ft. high and sft. wide,
mined 70 miles from the Victoria
Falls, giant source of a rival kind of
power—hydro-electricity. Total weight
of the lump was 9\ tons.
MASTER BUILDER'S HOME.
Mr. W. R. (Tom) Patterson's Home at Kingsgrove.
The President of the St. George and Sutherland Branch of the Master Builders'
Association of N.S.W., has selected the qualities of dignity and serenity to interpret
his idea of a home. The colourful selection of materials and good workmanship
indicates the builder to be the master of his arts and crafts. To the entrance
doors wrought iron work provides a decorative treatment as well as affording
protection.
STEEL CEMENT SILOS.
Colossal steel cement silos, 53 feet high
and 29ft. 6in. diameter, have been built
for storing cement during the construc-
tion of the Grande Dixence Dam, high
up, 7500 feet, in the Swiss mountains.
The roof and the bottom of these silos
were wholly prefabricated in the factory
and were transported to the site. The
lower ring of side plates were assembled
on the base and the upper ring, after
assembly was lifted into position by the
crane. The illustration shows the roof
being lifted Into position by the crane.

AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF BUILDERS
N.S.W. CHAPTER.
The Sixth General Meeting was
held in the Theatrette of the Sydney
Technical College on Friday, 27th.
November, 1953. Following a bush
ness session and buffet tea, Mr. H.
Seidler, welhknown Architect, addres'
ed some eighty members, visitors and
students on the subject of “Modern
Trends in Building.” Mr. Seidler’s
talk, supported by slides, though prov'
ocative was well received and was
along the following lines:
The contemporary attitude to build'
ing constitutes a frame of mind very
different to that of the average home
seeker or speculative routine -builder.
Whatever the use of the building, we
must above all solve the problem of
its requirements—how best to accom'
modate for the needs of its occupants.
This should not be done bv rule of
thumb thinking in terms of standard
rectangular boxes with pitched tile
roofs. We must re-examine these
never questioned fixed notions most
of us seem to have of what consth
tutes a house.
Building Methods Outdated.
Some of us have, of course, become
resigned to these existing modes of
construction and argue that the ap-
pearance of our homes is of secondary
importance as long as everyone gets
a roof over his head. But when exist'
ing practices begin to rob us of the
essential needs of a home our leth'
argy becomes serious. Let us face it —
present-day building methods are
thoroughly out-dated and out of place
here in Australia. If we look at our
houses objectively we find that they
resemble the types of dwellings built
at least 50 years ago in rigorous cli'
mates of the northern hemisphere.
Their outsides are bleak with almost
80% or more of the exterior surfaces
solid and only very limited window
area for the admission of light and air.
The interiors reflect this tightly con'
fined atmosphere. By relying on all
walls to carry the weight of the floors
or roof, our arrangement of rooms be'
comes a series of tightly sealed little
cubicles which paralyse the normal
functioning of our daily activities. We
seem to be constantly opening and
closing unnecessary doors. Some of
our rooms become practically unusable
because cf their restricted size and
awkward location in this labyrinth
which we insist on calling “home.”
And topping it all we have a huge
for its existence in this climate. Pitch'
ed roofs restrict the shape which build'
ings can take, are wasteful in labour
and material, not to sneak of the hot'
ror when we have to look at a whole
and expensive pitched roof structure
which has absolutely no justification
sea of them from above.
Logical Approach.
just what would be a logical ap'
proach to the problem of building a
house? Above all let us consider
our climate. There are few countries
on the globe that are blessed with the
mild conditions that prevail in Syd'
ney. One can understand people in
countries that suffer snow storms and
blizzards to build houses with small
windows and a pitched roof for the
snow to slide off but why here? I
think most of us will agree that it is
pleasant to have a large window look'
ing out into a garden. I would go a
step further and say that we should
have entire glass walls, that is from
floor to ceiling and from wall to wall,
which we can easily have here with'
out experiencing any discomfort.
These will flood our interiors with
light and open them up to literally
embrace the garden and bring the out'
doors in. Our small rooms will im'
mediately look twice their size. We
must, of course, plan such extensive
glass areas carefully. Should they face
toward the sun they must be provided
with protective outside overhangs
which will keep out the high rays of
the summer sun and yet will allow the
low winter sun to help heat the in'
terior. Also, of course, such glass
walls must be planned for privacy. It
would be unreasonable to expose such
openings towards the street but would
be very pleasant toward a private
garden or a view.
Logical Attitude of Planning.
A standard small structure uses far
too much building material. It could
be just as ‘well built” if not actually
better built with only one half of the
quantity of material and an obviously
resulting economy. If we employ a
logical attitude of planning we will
find that by throwing together some
of our “cubicles,” by eliminating
wasteful hallways, we will gain far
greater usable space in the same size
structure.
The kev for such free interior ar'
rangement lies in the use of new
structural methods which don’t rely
on walls to carry weight but use steel
or wood posts and beams to carry the
roof. This will reduce the outer walls
to mere screens, solid or glazed as
we wish. Our interiors will be freed
of restricting wall c and we will be
able to build in form of space dividers
according to the families’ special re'
quirements.
New Visual Effects.
The result, apart from its practical
advantages will have aspacious airi'
ness about it which we all crave so
much in this period of high costs
which restrict the size of our homes.
They will not only be a new frame
within the house but the conventional
barrier to the outside will have dis'
appeared. Our interiors will seem to
bring the outdoors in and actually ex'
tend outside for out'door living.
The new visual effects in building,
obviously of a rational origin, are
those which are an outcome of new en-
gineering practice. Structural engin-

CHRISTMAS MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT.
As the Federal President of the Australian Institute of Builders, it is my
privilege to extend the Season’s Greetings to all members of the Australian
Building Industry.
Since its inception the Institute has made remarkable progress on the
educational side of the industry. As everyone knows, the Institute’s function
is to take care of the individual, and does not intrude in any way whatsover
in the field occupied by various State Master Builders’ Associations, and the
Master Builders’ Federation of Australia.
The work of the Institute’s State Chapters merits great commendation,
and future plans will carry their work much further. The Chapters are making
a special effort to see that the young man in the building industry is given
every opportunity to improve his status and knowledge of technological advances
in Australia and overseas, particularly in the application of new methods and
materials
A great step forward has been taken by the Council in deciding to erect
an Institute Headquarters in Sydney. Plans are now being prepared to provide
a suitable building, which will have an extensive technical library, lecture hall,
reading room, and full facilities for members.
My recent visit overseas as the Commonwealth representative to I.L.O.
gave me the opportunity of meeting many leaders of the Building Industry.
As a result the way has been prepared for the utmost co-operation between the
134-year-old British Institute of Builders and our own Australian Institute.
The coming year should be one of considerable progress for one and all in
the Building Industry.
(Signed) M. R. HORNIBROOK, F.A.I.B.,
President.

MODERN INDUSTRIAL PLANT AT LIDCOMBE
INDUSTRIAL SALES & SERVICE (N.S.W.) PTY. LTD.
FRAMEWORK PREFABRICATED IN GREAT BRITAIN.
The fine new premises of Industrial
Sales and Service (N.S.W.) Pty. Ltd.,
Parramatta Road, Lidcombe, were re'
cently completed by H. W. Thompson
Pty. Ltd., Master Builders, to the
specifications and plans of Messrs.
Stafford, Moor and Farrington, Ar'
chitects.
The building, which covers an area
of 125 ft. by 337 ft., comprises a spa'
cious assembly plant, administrative
and sales offices.
It is built of structural steel, pre'
fabricated in England by the Octavius
Atkinson Steel Co.
The premises took 18 months to
complete, and are unique owing to
the fact that it was a stock prefabri'
cated factory, imported from the U.K.
Around this framework the archi'
tects planned and designed the impos'
ing factory (see illustrations) which
today attracts the attention of all pass'
ers'by.
The building has concrete floors
throughout, and is equipped with the
necessary staff rooms and toilet
blocks.
The frontage is of brick, which con'
tinues to sill height at the side. The
steel windows were imported.
The asbestos roof is Fibrolite.
The tower is of sheeted porcelain
enamel pressed'metal tiles. These
were locally'made by Consolidated
Neon Ltd.
THE DOMINANT TOWER.
The tower arrests attention. It is of sheeted porcelain enamelled metal tiles, made
locally, and has become a prominent landmark. The awning on the left and brick-
work on the right enhance the appearance of the building.
THE PARRAMATTA ROAD FACADE.
The factory was planned around an imported prefab, steel framework. There is generous window area to ensure pleasant work-
ing conditions.

THE NEW
HOUSTON, TEXAS
Industrial Heart of the
American Southwest.
Oil is King in Houston, but it is not
he only reason to explain the big
100m which this industrial heart of
he Southwest has experienced for the
ast ten years.
Between 1940 and 1950, Houston
eaped from 21st to 14th place among
Jnited States cities. Since 1950, pop'
datipn has increased from 594,000 to
bout 665,000. Every month at pres'
nt 2,000 to 3,000 newcomers are
:ounted in the city. With more popu'
ation and immensely more wealth
:ame the trend to modern housing,
fhe new public buildings as well as
he new residential sections are stun'
ling and glittering. Houston, in a
nodern way, tries to reach the Gothic
irchitecture of modern New York.
Oil, of course, is King among the
ndustries. It has created most of
Houston's estimated 1,000 millionaires.
3ut there is the Port of Houston, sec'
md only to New York port in amount
of tonnage handled. The port is the
centre for the Gulf Coast petrochemi'
cal industry, and a world port for cot'
ton and oil. Valuable agricultural
land is surrounding the city, where
cattle and lumber play an important
part.
Modem Buildings.
Houston’s only big department store
downtown, the $12,000,000 (£A.5,'
333,000) Foley Bros.’ department
store, has everything from a bargain
basement to its swank Crystal Room.
This unusually modern air'Conditioned
six'Storey structure of concrete and
steel is of striking design and covers
a full city square block. It is window'
less except for the show windows. The
This store is one of the major com'
mercial projects in Houston’s $600,'
000,000 (£A. 266,000,000) construe'
tion programme.
There is a “northern accent” on life
in Houston, but the framework is
still that of a casual, southwestern
city. This can hardly be changed, it
is due to the warm climate.
The $21,000,000 (£A.9,333,000)
Shamrock is Houston’s and the whole
South'west’s foremost hotel. This is
not too big, I,loo'room hotel has
done much to get Houston out of the
country'town into the big'dty cate'
gory. With its 18 floors plus a base'
ment, its overall height is 253 feet.
There was much publicity when the
hotel was opened. 2,500 shamrocks
were flown over from Eire, and every*
body liked the new hotel which oil'
man Glenn McCarthy had built “in
an effort to make Manhattan’s Wal'
dorf'Astoria look like a lodging
house.”
Texas Medical Centre.
The most spectacular nombusiness
development in Houston is the sprawl'
ing Texas Medical Centre, going up
near the Shamrock hotel. It will rep'
resent some $100,000,000 (£A.44,'
000,000) investment in hospitals, re'
search institutions, and teaching facili'
ties. The new Hermann Professional
Building is a vital part of the Medical
Centre, it is built on a 163'acre site.
A lovely modern building of spec'
ial character is the Houston Fire
Alarm Building. It is the nerve centre
for the city’s modern fire alarm sys'
tern, and it relays telephone and box
alarms to the nearest fire station in a
matter of seconds. Intervals for traffic
light changes in Houston’s downtown
area are also controlled from the
building.

Long Service To
Construction
Industry
Luke Muras Ltd. Has Proud Record.
One of Sydney’s largest structural
steelworks, Luke Muras Ltd., has es'
tablished a proud jecord in the Aus'
tralian steel construction industry.
The present chairman of Directors
and Managing Director, Mr. Luke
Muras, joined his father over 50 years
ago.
In the interim, the business has
grown from a 40ft. by 60ft. business
in Balmain to an organisation with a
1000 ft. frontage in O’Riordan Street,
Alexandria, today (see illustration).
In April last, the firm celebrated
the completion of 50 years’ service of
Mr. Luke Muras, when he was the
guest of honour at a function held in
the Board Room.
On this occasion Mr. Muras was
presented with a silver service and in'
scribed salver, in recognition and ap'
preciation of his long service.
Our photos illustrate some aspects
of the manifold activities of this active,
progressive organisation, in which the
third generation of sons are playing a
very important part.
BANK’S £30,000,000 HOUSING

Over the past century Trade Union'

Over the years, as its powers have

achievement of such a position in the
life of the Nation brings
with it Jkreat responsibilities as well
as the piyvileges and influence gained?
If they are a vital factor in the

ts can have the greatest effect upon
le country’s welfare and thus upon
ie wellbeing of all unionists and
other ranks” as well.
This fact in the broader sphere
'as brought strikingly to our attention
i a recent letter from our London
epresentatives, who said:
“There as yet seems no understanding
y the average worker that Germany
nd other nations are making great
iroads into our engineering and sim-
ar operations overseas, and that we
ball only be able to hold our own if
iasonable wages and full work en-
ble us to produce a competitive ar-
cle. Perhaps an encouraging fea-
jre in this country is that the more
isponsible leaders of the Trades
Jnion—and there are a number of
lem—are realising these factors in
onsiderable degree and are giving
rm advices on very solid lines. See-
ig that until recently the whole
reight of Trade Union leadership
rorked in the opposite sense it is now
little late to put over these much
lore refreshing views, and to get them
ccepted by their followers, but none-
le-less this may be a valuable stabil-
iing factor in this country. Similarly
f course, and perhaps even insepar-
bly, there tends to be a loss of con-
:ol between the top levels of Trade
Jnionism and the “workers” as is
tiown by various unofficial strikes
diich have taken place in opposition
3 Union leadership.”
One would like to believe that in
Australia some of the more mature
'rades Union leaders are developing
vision broader than the old hackney-
d catchcry of “more money and
horter hours.” They should realise
bat in the ultimate the standard of
iving of any nation is only that which
: can support as the result of the de-
elopment of its natural resources and
f the work of its people. Even if every
adult person in Australia were a
union member it would be of little
benefit to anyone if the rest of the
world ceased to buy our products be-
cause they were too dear. The con-
tinued increase in costs has already
extinguished many export channels
that looked very promising a few years
ago. These are the real national prob-
lems that should be exercising the
minds of the Trades Union leaders of
Australia.
OZONE-NATURE’S
FRESHENER.
Cooking odours, cigarette smoke,
soap, perfumes and paint smells may
be readily dispersed by Ozone, Nature’s
three-atom oxygen molecule. It literal-
ly burns up the odour-carrying vapours,
itself disintegrating into free oxygen
atoms.
Ozonizers, using an electric dis-
charge between two electrodes, which
may be readily plugged into the elec-
tric installation, rapidly re-arrange the
atmospheric oxygen atoms and re-
move all staleness from the air.
Not only is Ozone used for air re-
conditioning. but it is also a powerful
germicide, for preservation of meats,
eggs and fruits. It is a strong oxidis-
ing agent and in higher concentration
can be used for bleaching. One city
uses Ozone in large quantities to
sterilise and de-odorise its water sup-
ply.
AUSTRALIA’S OIL BASINS.
There are altogether nine suspect'
ed oil basins in Australia: Exmouth

GERMANY TODAY
REMARKABLE RECOVERY SINCE WAR.
During the winter of 1945 a mass'
migration of 14,000,000 refugees
shuffled out of the eastern provinces
of Germany towards the west. About
2.000. froze to death on icy roads;
3.000. were isolated in the Rus'
sian zone of Germany; the rest found
hunger, misery and bomb'blasted
cities waiting for them —there seemed
no hope for them.
Despite all this, the German people
did not give up. One of their strong'
est traits, an almost fanatic reverence
for toil, probably saved them. Millions
of starving Germans of both sexes, and
of all ages knuckled down to the
heartbreaking job of rebuilding their
homes and cities without proper tools.
They had lost everything—except
the property rights to the rubble
which had once comprised their homes
and shops. Today the result is his'
tory.
Germany To-day.
Present'day visitors to Germany see
a nation whose people seem only to
live for the sake of working. Every'
where he goes he will find resurrected
cities which some eight years ago,
were flattened to the earth by pattern
bombing.
In every part of Western Germany
a building programme is running night
and day in top gear to build homes,
factories, and industrial plants.
How It Happened.
How has this apparent miracle hap'
pened? The two factors which facili'
tated the resurgence of the German
economy were the Currency Reform
undertaken in June, 1948, and the
inclusion of Germany in the recon'
struction plan financed by the Marshall
Plan, which was conceived as a means
of putting Europe back on its feet
industrially.
The first step in the rehabilitation of
the German economy was the building
up of the labour potential, and to en'
sure that Germans were well'fed and
adequately housed.
Great Task.
In the post'war years, 1,000,000
dwellings, were rebuilt or newly
erected and this figure was bettered
by 60% in 1950.
The construction of 400,000 dweh
lings in 1951 was a European record.
Taking an average of 4 persons per
housing unit, almost 1,600,000 people,
mostly expellees and refugees and
bombed'out persons—were housed.
Most of the housing units built in
1951 consisted of 2 to 3 rooms and
a kitchen, while some 92,000 houses
were built for miners on the coalfields.
At the same time, huge blocks of
apartments were erected in the cities,
notably Hamburg (see illustration).
German Industry.
The increase in German industrial
production since 1949 has been phem
omenal. In November, 1950, the pro'
duction index for western Germany
was a third higher than for the same
period in 1936.
The volume of production in the
capital goods industries climbed 49%
between September, 1949, and De'
cember, 1950, although coal produc'
tion lagged behind, climbing only
18.6%. Nevertheless, the yearly pro'
duction was stepped up from 87,000,'
000 tons in 1948 to 110,000,000 tons
in 1950. Motor car production in'
creased from 226,108 vehicles in 1950
to 267,360 in 1951.
It is interesting to note that over
36.000 refugees have established firms
which employ skilled workers and
180.000 refugees found work in 5000
new industries.
Railways.
When the war ended, railway sta'
tions were piles of debris and most of
the engines, carriages and waggons
owned by the Federal Railway were
reduced to scrap. River and sea ports
were unusable.
By the end of 1950 it was a differ'
ent story. Of 1603 shattered bridges
on the Autobahn and other highways
1417 were back in service.
The Federal Railroad now has
7850 engines, 243,457 waggons, and
22,970 carriages in service. It now
employs 500,000 people, as before the
war.
Parliament.
The Federal Republic was founded
on May 23., 1949. The president, cab'
inet, the parliament, and the Upper
House or Bundesrat composed of rep'
resentatives of the Lander* govern'
ments are all located in Bonn.

Lament Building (see illustration)

Newcastle Chapter.
The Newcastle Chapter has fully
maintained activities and membership
during the year.
Details of lectures delivered during
the year 1952A3 are set out below:—
November, 1952 —“Ground Radar,”
by Mr. J. Briar.
March, 1953 —“Elements of Him
mination Design,” by Mr. O. G.
Huxley.
April—“ Adding Art to the Science,”
by Mr. B. Harwood.
May-—“ Some Home Lighting Prim
ciples,” by Mr. E. L. Freedman.
June —“Colour in the Home,” by
Mr. R. H. Colligan.
July “The Approach to Colour
Measurement,” by Mr. A. Murray.
August “Hospital Lighting,” by
Mr. I. McDonald.
Liaison with the Chapter has been
maintained by several members of the
N.S.W. Council and others being
present at Chapter Meetings during the
year.
Technical Education.
Advice was received in February
from Mr. J. Knight that the I.E.S.
Award for the 1952 class in Illumina'
tion (I) at the N.S.W. University of
Technology should be made to Mr.
J. J. Kennedy. The President sent
congratulatory letters to the nine sum
cessful students and later the Award
was presented to Mr. Kennedy.
Owing to the increase in the nurm
ber of students required by the
University of Technology, no course
in Illumination could be held during
1953. During the year a request was
received as to the standing of a special
three'part course held during the cut'
rent year at the University of Tech'
nology. After investigating the syh
labus it was decided that the course
was not equivalent to Illumination
(II), and therefore could not be com
sidered a satisfactory substitute for it.
The lecturer was advised of the posh
tion and suggestions were made as to
the necessary alterations to the course
which would bring it into line with
the requirements of the Society, and
thus render it a suitable substitute for
Illumination (II).

The Committee held its first meet'
ing on the 19th August, and after
the second meeting, a fortnight later,
held meetings weekly, in an endeavour
to complete its review by the 30th
November, 1953. Progress with the
review is quite satisfactory, and pre'
sent indications are that our target will
be achieved.
During the year, the matter of the
Design Tables was revived, and it is
anticipated that these will be in a
form ready for submission to Council
early in 1954.
Competition.
The I.E.S. Award for “Meritorious
Lighting Installations” is being com
tinued this year, the classification being
“Commercial Lighting,” for which
fifteen entries were received. This is
an increase of six as compared with
last year. This Competition in various
fields of lighting is now established as
a regular feature of the Society’s
activities.
Council wishes to thank members of
the Jury who undertake a great amount
of work in adjudicating the Award.
Official Journal and “I.E.S.
Lighting Review.”
A full record of the activities of
your Society has appeared each month
in the Official Journal, “Building:
Lighting: Engineering,” and once
again your Council wishes to express
its appreciation to the publishers for
their continued cooperation.
During the year, seven articles based
on material submitted through the
N.S.W. Society have been published
in the “I.E.S. Lighting Review,” which
is maintaining its former high standard.

HOBART MEMORIAL.
150th ANNIVERSARY MONUMENT.
Tasmania architects are criticising the
design of this memorial that is to be
erected in Hobart where Lt.-Governor
Collins landed 150 years ago. It was de-
signed by Mr. W. H. Furness, State or-
ganiser of the Sesqui-centenary celebra-
tions. It will be 13ft. high overall on a
platform of 20ft. diameter, carried out
in Tasmanian stone. The base will be of
grey dolomite, and the superstructure
of East Coast red granite. Bronze plates,
illuminated by tubular lighting, will re-
cord the history of the landing and the
unveiling ceremony. The upper sides
of each column will be decorated by
inset panels in bas-relief, and will repre-
sent the brigs "Lady Nelson" and the
"Ocean," the two vessels which took part
in the landing.

year of considerable activity. It
laintained constant liaison with the
indred organisations, and with the
ditors of the various trade journals
nd the Press. During the year, Mr.
\ H. McCourt addressed the Fibro'
*laster Association on “Practical As'
»ects of Lighting for Buildings,” and
At. P. J. Grundfest gave a lecture at
meeting of the Parents and Citizens’
Association at Bellevue Hill on “Light'
ng for Study.” The Committee
nade special endeavours to obtain pub'
icity from the Society’s July meeting
>n “Light and Road Safety,” and can
eport with considerable gratification
hat Mr. T. H. McCourt was invited
o speak for the Society on this sub'
ect over the A.B.G. N.S.W. Maga'
line on Station 2BL.
The main effort of the Committee
vas again directed towards collecting
naterial for “Sidelights” and prepay
ng these for monthly publication, and
t is noteworthy that the Committee
net at least once every month through'
Dut the year and with almost complete
ittendances.
Society’s Lighting Exhibit.
The Agricultural Bureau of N.S.W.
invited the Society to display the Ex'
libit at their 29th Annual State Con'
Ference at the Hawkesbury Agricuh
:ural College on the 16th July. This
invitation was accepted, and the dis'
play was duly staged. Three sessions
were held, the first at 8.15 a.m. be'
fore about one hundred ladies, the
second before about eighty men, and
the third session was given to about
one hundred and twenty men dele'
gates. Each delegate received a “Bet'
ter Light, Better Sight” I.E.S. parm
phlet. The Society’s lecturers were
Messrs. G. C. T. Brown. E. L.
Freedman and J. Lowe.
All this was carried out at practical'
ly no cost to the Society, all transport
costs being covered by the Agricuh
tural Bureau, and a gracious letter of
appreciation was received.
At the conclusion of the Conference
a new home was found for the Exhibit,
and the Committee thanks Claude
Neon for their generous offer of
making this space available. The Ex'
hibit will be displayed at the Town
Hall during Health Week this year.
Membership and Social.
The Membership and Social Com'
mittee has devoted this year to con'
solidating the position achieved by
last year’s Committee.
The pre-meeting dinner rendezvous
was removed to Cahills on the corner
of Martin Place to the benefit of the
Society and its members in both set'
vice and convenience.
The serving of sherry before meet'
ings was restricted this year to those
meetings at which your Society acted
as host to other Societies or visitors.
The Ladies’ Night in September
was accompanied by the innovation of
presenting to all lady visitors a small
buttonhole, a feature very much ap'
preciated by the recipients.
A considerable portion of the Com'
mittee’s activities was devoted to the
collection of outstanding dues. The
attention of all members to the pay'
ment of their subscriptions would con'
siderably facilitate the working of the
Society, and would remove an un'
necessary burden from the shoulders
of the Council and the Committee.
Secretarial and Finance,
The Balance Sheet as at 30th Sep'
tember, 1953, and the Revenue Ac'
counts for the year ended at that date
are in the usual form, and are attached
hereto. A new item appears as an
asset this year, viz., “Lighting Ex'
hibit.” It will be noted that one'
fifth of the nett cost to the Society
of this asset has been written off this
year, and, if the same amount is writ'
ten off in each of the next four years,
this item will be extinguished in that
time. Accumulated Funds show a
total increase during the year of
£35/18/2, which is made up as fol-
lows: —
Entrance Subscriptions .. 19 19 0
Surplus for Year .. 7 9 0
Newcastle Chapter
Surplus for year 8 10 2
£35 18 2
Whilst the income of the Society
shows very little change from the pre'
vious year, expenses increased by ap'
proximately £l4O. This increase oc'
curred mainly under four heads of
expense, viz.. Loss on Annual Dinner
(including entertaining visiting
National Councillors) £5B, Socials and
Suppers £2O, Prizes and Certificates
£24, and Amount Written off Light'
ing Exhibit £46.

MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
Mr. A. V. SHEMWELL,
MEGGITT LTD.
Twenty-three years selling linseed oil

great popularity among his colleagues
and the trade.
His proudest moments are at the
R.A.S. Show when he meets the leading
breeders who feed the majority of prize-
winning cattle on Meggitts Linseed Oil
Meal and pure Sheep Nuts.
Mr. Shemwell is very fond of golfing

Library.
At the beginning of 1953 all copies
of the following magazines received
during 1952 were forwarded to the
Sydney Municipal Library:—
(1) Illuminating Engineering
(U.S.A.).
(2) Light and Lighting Great
Britain.
(3) I.E.S. Review (Aust.).
(4) International Lighting Review
(Philips Electrical Industries).
In March it was recommended to
the Sydney Municipal Library that the
following books be purchased for in'
elusion in the Lighting Section: —
“Physical Aspects of Colour,” by Dr.
P. J. Boumer; “Gas Discharge Lamps,”
by Funke and Oranje; “Principals of
Lighting,” by Stevens; and it is un-
derstood that the books have since
been included in the lighting literature
available at the Library.
A copy of the American Standard
Practice in Street Lighting was sent
to the Library for inclusion in the
Lighting Section. This has not yet
appeared in the section, but should
do so in the near future.

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
BY Mr. G. C. T. BROWN.
Delivered at the Annual General Meeting of the Illuminating Engineering
Society of Australia—N.S.W., held on November 19, 1953.
Twelve months ago your Society
was very fortunate in having a very
:apable and energetic President, and
at the later Council Meetings in 1952
I strongly advocated that that Presi-
dent’s term of office should be extend-
ed for a second year. Now, twelve
months later, I am wholly on the side
of those who advocate that the Presi-
dent’s term of office should be only
one year.
I offer my sincere apologies to Mr.
Freedman, for I have found that being
the President of a Society such as
ours is not a responsibility to be un-
dertaken lightly.
It is an honour, but it also involves
a lot of hard work, and no small
amount of one’s time—-both business
time and leisure time.
The President of the Victorian
Society, Mr. Bob Nott, whom we had
the pleasure of entertaining at your
last Annual General Meeting, I regard
as something of a super-man. He
had just completed his fourth year of
office.
As your Annual Report has shown
you, New South Wales was again rep-
resented at the National Conference
in Adelaide this year by three Dele-
gates—Messrs. E. L. Freedman, H. G.
Fallon and G. Y. Falk as proxy for
Mr. D. C. B. Maclurcan. Mr.
Freedman has been elected as a Vice-
President of the National Council.
We have, during the year, main-
tained membership of the Society at
the high figure of 274, and it is in-
teresting to note that with the large
proportion of 50 Sustaining Members,
our annual income from members’
fees alone in all grades now reaches
almost a thousand pounds a year.
Over £BOO of this is absorbed by Ad-
ministration Expenditure and the
balance is spent on Special projects
undertaken by the Society in the ad-
vancement of the Art and Science of
Lighting.
Special Projects.
These special projects are: —Tech-
nical Education: The provision of ap-
propriate prizes for successful students
in the Illumination Courses.
The I.E.S. Award for Meritorious
Lighting Installations: The provision
of Certificates to the winning entry
and its designer.
TLe Society’s Lighting Exhibit: The
maintenance and transport of the ex-
hibit and the provision of suitable pam-
phlets and additions and alterations are
items of expenditure which would nor'
mally be met annually.
However, it is more by the personal
effort of its active members that the
Society flourishes «than by the amount
of money expended.
An example of this is the Publicity
and Public Relations Committee, con'
vened by Mr. E. L. Freedman, who,
among many others things, is respon-
sible for the regular presentation of
our monthly newsheet “Sidelights.
The Standards and Codes Commit'
tee, of which I am convenor, has done
a great deal of work in renewing the
Draft Interior Illumination Buildings
Code and, when completed, this Code
should be a valuable asset to all who
use it. The Reviewing Committee

The various other Committees which

hundreds of man-hours.
I have been very fortunate this year
in being supported by a very able and

PROTON SYNCHROTRON AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY.
In the synchrotron ionised particles are progressively accelerated in a circular
orbit, in an annular vacuum chamber. They are maintained in this path by a
magnetic field which is progressively increased in synchronisation with the acceler-
ated motion. The accelerator now nearing completion at Birmingham University is
designed to yield protons energised to 1000 MeV for nuclear bombardment. It
consists of a circular ring magnet weighing 810 tons built up from vertical plates
arranged radially, with wedge-shaped plates at intervals. The magnet diameter is
32ft. Within the horizontal annular slot formed in the magnet are set, first, the
magnet windings, and then the upper and lower pole pieces, in the gap between
which is placed the annular vacuum chamber. The pole pieces are built up in a
similar way to the body of the magnet. The two photographs show the upper pole
piece being assembled. Great accuracy was required in setting and levelling the
magnet and its pole pieces.

mittee is greatly appreciated by us all.
Similar remarks apply to Sim Holman,
who has recently been upgraded and
transferred to Melbourne as National
Council Secretary, Standards Codes
and Exhibition Committee.
I feel it is also •timely to express
my very deep appreciation to one
who. though not resigning, will not
be with us for most of 1954. I refer
to Ernie Freedman, who is going to
Europe next month. He goes abroad
with the highest credentials of the
1.E.5., for as Past-President of the
N.S.W. Society, and Vice-President of
the National Council, I know of no
one better fitted to represent the Aus-
tralian Societies in Europe than Mr.
Freedman. In his travels through
Germany, England and Portugal I
trust he will do much to cement the
friendly relationships between the
Australian and European Societies.
The co-operation that I have re-
ceived from the other members of
Council has made my job very much
easier. Mr. Jack Cooper has been
most helpful and Mr. Max Craker,
who became a Councillor in July, has
been a tower of strength. Mr.
McCourt, as Technical Secretary, and
Mr. Len Hyatt, who has, among many
other things, been the Convenor of
the Social Committee. Remember
those white posies he provided for the
ladies on Ladies’ Night! Mr.
Chadwick has kept an eagle eye on
the Society’s purse'String this year.
Although Mr. Maclurcan has been
granted leave of absence for the
greater part of the year, he has done
sterling work for the Society in fos'
tering International goodwill.
Mr. Phillips and Mr. Deegan have
both been very active workers for the
I.E.S.
Mr. A. Smith, who became a Coun-
cillor half'way through the year, is
now well-established and has a very
busy year ahead.
During this year there is one whom
I have regarded as my right-hand man.
For many years a Councillor, he has
filled most of the important posts and
has been a most dependable organiser,

Governor-General to
Open Geelong
Refinery
The Shell Company of Australia an'
nounced that His Excellency the Gov'
ernor'General of Australia, Field'Mar'
shal Sir William Slim, has graciously
accepted the invitation to open the
Company’s new oil refinery at Gee-
long, Victoria, on March 18th, 1954.
By that time there will have been
between .£9,000,000 and £10,000,000
spent on the project.
Among the major items of the pro'
ject are:
A staff amenities building, incorpor'
ating glass'endosed dining rooms, dr'
cular spray wash'fountains and pastel'
shaded recreation rooms;
An ultra'modern office building, a
feature of which is a system of low'
temperature radiant heating from coils
set in the floor;
A safety underpass beneath the
Melbourne/Geelong railway line to
give access to the refinery from the
Geelong road;
A half-mile tanker jetty being con-
structed by the Geelong Harbour
Trust Commissioners, together with
dredged channels and a turning basin
for the ocean-going tankers which will
bring the crude oil to the refinery;
Australia’s longest oil pipeline—36
miles—connecting the refinery with
the Company’s installation at New-
port. This line will carry petroleum
products to serve the busy metropol-
itan area of Melbourne.
Plastic Skylights
Save Money
Annual savings of several thousands
of dollars are reported by the Crown
Gan Co. plant in Philadelphia, U.S.A.,
through replacement of wired-glass
skylights with sheets of corrugated
plastic as seen in the illustration.
The result has improved day'
lighting and increased worker safety.
Frequent cracking of the wired glass
was caused by wide and rapid changes
in temperature. Since replacement
with acrylic plastic, all danger of glass
falling on workers has been eliminat'
ed.
This exterior view shows the degree of
opening possible with the transoms,

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
ACTIVITY FOR ROYAL VISIT.
While minor renovation jobs around
the city in preparation for the Royal
Visit continue to be undertaken almost
daily, there has been little major work
let in the past month. One of the
largest privately-let jobs was for the
Keith Hospital, which went to A. W.
Baulderstone Ltd, The first section
is expected to be completed in about
eight months at a cost of £18,500, and
equipment worth about £6OOO will be
installed. A second section will be
added within about five years.
Built of brick, Mt. Gambier lime'
stone and asbestos cement, the hos'
pital has one breakaway from conven-
tional design. The architect, Gordon
C. Brown, has provided six-foot eaves,
to shelter the terrace around the hos'
pital from weather without unduly
darkening the interior.
A contract is likely to be called this
month for the big Hotel Seaton job,
estimated to cost about £45,000. Work
is due to begin early in the new year,
and the hotel is to be open for bush
ness within twelve months. The site,
on Tapleys Hill Road, near the Royal
Adelaide Golf Links, is in the centre
of a large and growing area. The
design, by Lucas and Parker, is for a
two-storeyed brick structure, with the
usual public and saloon bars, bottle
department, lounge and dining room,
as well as twelve bedrooms, six with
toilets and six with hot and cold run'
ning water. Features unusual in this
city will be a beer garden and parking
space for cars. To give facilities lack'
ing in the absence of a local hall, the
lounge and dining room can be
joined into one by swing doors. The
company, Hotel Seaton Ltd., formed
this month to back the hotel building,
also plans to build a block of four
shops on the same site.
Work has begun on two big hotel
renovation jobs. Elsdon Brothers have
an .£lB,OOO contract for constructing
new saloon bar and lounge, remodel'
ling existing dining room, kitchen and
public bar and constructing five new
bedrooms at the Northern Hotel.
Work totalling about £12,000 at
(the Hampsted Hotel, involving a new
bedroom wing, public bar and other
ialterations. is being carried out by
subcontractors under the direction of
the owner, Mr. R. Johnson. Evans
ife? Bruer, Philpott and Partners are
the architects in each case.
The same firm is calling tenders for
the new banqueting hall at the Burn'
side Town Hall, for which estimates
given to the council place the cost at
about £30,000. The main hall, of
about 4500 sq. ft., will be of double'
storey height, though a single-storey
building, and will have a mezzanine
gallery. Entrance foyer and ancillary
buildings are of about the same area.
A design by the same firm, for
which tenders have just closed, marks
a new departure in church building
for new areas. It is for a church at
Clearview, a steel and timber-framed
building a little over 1000 sq. ft. in
area which will, however, give both
hall and meeting room facilities for a
nucleus congregation. The usual ap'
proach in new areas has been to make
do with a bare church hall, and wait
until the congregation grew as the
area became established before build'
ing a church. This building, it is
considered, gives the “church charac'
ter,’’ and is still within the finances of
a nucleus congregation.
Tenders are being called by Woods,
Bagot. Laybourne Smith and Irwin for
the main building structure of the
48,000 sq. ft, tractor assembly and
maintenance plant for the S.A. Tractor
Co. at Enfield. The building is steel
framed, faced with flat asbestos sheet-
ing. Work already carried out in-
cludes excavation by J. H. Leverington
Son (8000), and foundation and
flooring, including services, by Marshall
& Brougham (25,000). Perry En-
gineering have the £20,000 contract
for steel fabrication and erection for
the building.
Perry Engineering also have the
steelwork contract for the £20,000
grandstand at Norwood Oval, for
which the main construction work has
been let to Hansen 6? Yuncken. Milne,
Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis are the
architects. The same firm has let
the steelwork contract for the £35,000
Sunbeam Corporation factory at
Islington to Forwood Down 6? Co.
Clarkson Ltd., have the contract for
roofing the 20,000 sq. ft. building
with asbestos cement.
Fricker Brothers have received seve'
ral contracts on work at St. Peter’s
College, mainly on the first section of
the new boarding house. Other work
at the school includes extensive altera'
tions to the layout of dormitories in
School House, and work on a new
changing'room block for St. Peter’s
Collegians’ Association in the school
grounds. Woods, Bagot are the
architects.
The same firm is calling tenders for
a new wing, in brick and stone, total'
ling about 2500 sq. ft., for the
Dominican Convent at Mt. Lofty, and
a new office building for the Adelaide
Steam Ship Co. at Port Lincoln. This
building, adjacent to the wharf, will
be of single'storey brick construction,
about 3500 sq. ft .in area.
Peake Construction Co. have a con'
tract, at about £5500 for additions to
Lincoln College, established a few
years ago in an old home at North
Adelaide. The additions involve an
extension of the dining room and pro'
vision of staff quarters. Hassell and
McConnell are the architects.

Buckingham Palace
Keystone of Empire
Although Buckingham Palace is to-
day regarded as the keystone of the
Empire, it is a curious fact that this
has come about by hazard and by ac-
cident.
It was originally built as a pleasure
home for a Duke of Buckingham; the
ground having come into the Crown’s
possession at the time of the Dissolu-
tion of the Monasteries.
Then George 111. bought it as a
Dower House for Queen Charlotte.
When she died, the Prince Regent em-
ployed Nash, the man who designed
Regent Street, to rebuild Buckingham
House, as he did not like his other
residence, Carlton House.
Nash’s plans did not destroy the old
house, but he added the western fa-
cade and the principal approach was
through the Marble Arch, which had
been designed as a memorial to Tra-
falgar and Waterloo.
Unfortunately, a niggardly Treasury
refused to allow Nash to continue the
alterations and George 111. died be-
fore he could ever live there.
“New Throne.”
Next came William IV., but he
preferred Clarence House, so the new-
ly-completed Palace stood empty until
young Queen Victoria drove there in
state on July 13, 1837, to reside there.
She immediately ordered “a New
Throne” —such it is to be 18. But
after her marriage and the arrival of
numerous children the Palace became
overcrowded. So the Quadrangle was
enclosed by the present eastern fa-
cade, which meant that the Marble
Arch had to be moved, and another
storey, which included a balcony, was
added to the building.
That now-famous crimson-hung bal-
cony has been the scene of many
triumphs, for under it a loving people
have stood for many patient hours to
cheer —cheer in every sense of the
word —their beloved Monarchs.
Symbol of Empire.
So it is only in our own times that
Buckingham Palace has come into its
own as a focal-point, a symbol of Em- .
pire to the many thousands who have j
never penetrated to the State apart- .
ments or seen the glories of the ceil- j
ing in the Blue Drawing Room, or
the wealth of interest in pictures or
treasures, or walked in the glorious
gardens to watch the Monarch walk
slowly down the avenue of guests at
their pleasant, beautifully-organised I
garden parties.

Precasting concrete beams and lintels enables them to be made in a factory where efficient
conditions of manufacture give a cheaper and better quality product. There is no delay to
building construction whilst formwork is prepared for cast in place units and whilst the concrete
hardens. Bricklaying can be continued over precast beams immediately they are in position.
Prestressing enables longer beams to be precast and handled into position than would be possible
if they were normally reinforced. It reduces the depth of beam necessary for a given span
thus increasing the under clearance.

special lightweight protections, and it
may well be more economical to retain
our thinner sections, which satisfy the
structural and stress requirements, and
provide the extra fire resistance with
the protective coverings for such build-
ings as warehouses, dock and storage
buildings.
“It would seem that an additional
two-hour fire resistance could be pro-
vided with a lin. thick protection of
vermiculite plaster or an increase of
2£in. in concrete cover, and the for-
mer method may be more economical
in reducing the permanent deflection
and providing easier repair in the
event of a fire of less than maximum
intensity. Clearly more information
is required in this field and the further
work promised by the Director of the
Fire Research Station will be awaited
with interest.
“When the critical factors which de-
termine the behaviour of prestressed
concrete during and after fires have
been established, it will be possible to
assess the performance of beams with
dimensions exceeding the capacity of
the present testing equipment.”

eering, one of the many very progres-
sive branches of modern technology,
has been the prime cause for our revo-
lution in building. Responsible above
all is the development of materials
which made possible the principle of
skeleton construction with all its im-
plications. Although in our experi-
ence seldom fully exploited, the inher-
ent aesthetic potentialities of skseleton
construction are strongly opposed to
traditional principles of stability. The
familiar horizontal modulation of ele-
ments basically opposes gravity, and
the placement of large masses of build-
ing on visually negligible supports
violates the traditional eye. Canti-
levered slabs hovering in mid-air seem
to negate the fact that mass is some-
thing solid and heavy. Structural en-
gineering today has made possible a
complete dissolution of the conven-
tional architecture of MASS, with its
earth bound wall-bearing structural
systems.
Architecture of Space.
It has paved the way for our pres-
ent-day architecture of SPACE. Skel-
eton construction is an entirely new
vocabulary with which to formulate
this concept.
Naturally the architectural world has
been in a dilemma torn between the
“respectable” historic background of
styles (even today nostagically drilled
in all architectural schools) and the
new structural possibilities crying out
for a honest expression and a new
aesthetic.
It is found to be a slow process by
which the old prejudices will disap-
pear and these newer methods of
building will be generally accepted—
there is certainly no doubt, however,
that the future of Australian build-
ing is in this direction of contemno* - '
ary architecture.
Lack of Zoning Laws.
Houston, of course, has the typical
problems of a booming city. One of
the biggest problems is the lack of
zoning laws. As a result, “Business
Week” explains in a survey, it has
grown in crazy-quilt fashion. It is
hard to know who your neighbour
will be from one day to the next —a
warehouse, a fertiliser plant, or a
barbershop. “Business Week” quotes
one realtor as saying: “Most Houston'
ians would rather make a potful by
selling out their home to a filling sta-
tion than worry about the residential
values of the neighbourhood.”
COCKATOO ISLAND, SYDNEY
HUNGARIAN RAILWAYS.
Hungarian railway engineering has
reached a high level of perfection as
one would gather from a perusal of
the publication of Nilex Hungarian Trad-
ing Company. It is evident that the
comfort and convenience of the travel-
ling public is placed high in the priority
list of "musts" in its products. The il-
lustration here shows a four-unit railcar
train of the Argentine State Railways
made in Budapest.
Cockatoo Island lies about 2½ miles above the Harbour Bridge, close to the point
where the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers meet. The Island is approximately 550
yards in length, 350 yards in breadth, and has an area of about 40 acres. Its
workshops are built close to its edge, and two docks (see illustration) are strateg-
ically placed. Other shipbuilding slips are also in constant use. The Island is
mainly of solid rock. On the highest point a few residences and workshops have
been built, and two tunnels have been driven through the rock to facilitate speedy
movement of men and materials from one side of the Island to the other. Vessels
of up to 27,000 tons can be dry-docked, and considerable wharf accommodation is
available. Although there is always deep water at the Island, the launching of
vessels and docking of large ships are arranged at high water.

Master Builders’ Federation of Australia
CORONATION CONVENTION REPORTS,
(continued from last issue)
(6) THE MASTER BUILDERS’
ASSOCIATION OF N.S.W.
It is my pleasure to report to you
on some of the more important ac-
tivities that have occupied this Asso-
ciation during the year ending Aug-
ust, 1953.
It has been an unsettled period for
the industry although costs have con-
tinued to rise they have not done so
in such an alarming manner as they
did in 1951-52. The effect of the Fed-
eral Government’s financial policy is
being felt and I feel that it has help-
ed to stabilise our industry by the re-
turn of keen healthy competition. We
are now back to firm prices for home
building and within limitations much
industrial work also.
As I foreshadowed in last year’s
report, this year’s activities have been
of such magnitude that the Associa-
tion is becoming one of the foremost
Employers’ Organisations in the Com-
monwealth, and our service to mem-
bers and the community of the utmost
importance.
Building Survey.
During the current year buildings
to the value of £90,084,000 were com-
pleted in New South Wales, and of
this amount £61,133,000 we spent on
housing. 26,134 dwellings were com-
pleted, as compared with 23,212 last
year, 13,983 of this number being in
the metropolitan area. Of this num-
ber 2,097 only were for the New
South Wales Housing Commission.
The number of employees in the in-
dustry has fallen from 45,470 to
36,930, the lowest it has been for a
number of years. Accurate figures as
to the number of builders who have
ceased operations are not available,
but it is significant that the Associa-
tion has had only nine resignations
and the majority of these from elder
members. We may assume that many
newcomers have withdrawn from the
industry with the return of competi-
tion.
The rate of commencements in
housing fell sharply during the June-
September, 1952, quarter, but increas-
ed during the December quarter and
remained steady since. The rate of
completions increased in the same
ratio, mainly due to materials becom-
ing readily available and a stabilising
labour market.
We should not be over optimistic
regarding the supply of materials, for,
although competition has returned to
the industry, any sudden increase in
building activity must be reflected in
availability of materials, particularly
bricks, roofing tiles, lime and cement.
Rising costs are a continuing prob'
lem, and it must be realised that they
will never return to pre-war rates.
The “benefits” of a 40'hour week, 2
weeks’ annual leave, I week’s sick
leave, 10 public holidays, increased
margins, and last, but not least, long
service leave—all “given” by Govern-
ment Statute—cannot be enjoyed with-
out increasing costs.
Affiliation With Suburban
Master Builders’ Associations:
On 30th June, 1953, one of the
most important moves in the Building
Industry occurred when formal agree-
ments were signed with eight Sub-
urban Master Builders’ Associations.
These Branches will, while retaining
their autonomy, become Branches of
this Association, with a direct voice in
the policy of the Master Builders’ As-
sociation. I feel that this unity will
be a force for good in the State of
New South Wales. The interests of
the general public are paramount and
will be better served. Our approach
to other bodies is strengthened by the
knowledge that we are speaking with
one voice representing a major in-
dustry. To Mr. Wal Bryant, former
President of the Council of Suburban
Master Builders’ Associations, and his
fellow Branch Presidents, I extend my
sincere thanks for their efforts towards
bringing about this notable amalgama-
tion.
Membership.
During the year our membership
has increased by 96. This Associa-
tion and its Branches now represents
almost 2,000 Master Builders.
Industrial.
This year has seen a return to
commonsense from an industrial point
of view. The frivolous stoppages
which beset us last year have practi-
cally ceased. Disputes which have
arisen have been of a comparatively
minor nature and speedily settled on
submission to the Arbitration Court.
All apprenticeship awards have
been renewed, following the review
of tradesmen’s rates during 1951-52.
It is felt that the Association’s appeal
against an interim increase awarded
to carpenter apprentices in October
last helped to keep the increased wage
rates awarded to a minimum. The
number of lads entering the bricklay-
ing, plastering and plumbing trades
are comparatively few and we must
encourage interest to ensure a com
tinuance of these trades.
The basic wage continues to rise
and has now reached £l2/3/0 per
week. The upward trend has not been
so great as heretofore, amounting to
8/- for the year, and it is to be hoped
that a peak has been reached.
During the year a new union has
entered the field, namely. The Amah
gamated Society of Carpenters and
Joiners, which is attempting to take
control of carpenters from the B.W.
I.U. This new union has secured a
Federal Award covering its members
in identical terms with our present
State Award for carpenters (with the
exception that there is no long ser-
vice leave provision).
The State Government's intention
to amend the N.S.W. Arbitration Act
to provide compulsory unionism has
been shelved following strong criti-
cism, even from within union circles.
Whilst the idea has been shelved, it
may only be temporary and we must
be prepared to oppose any attempt
to revive it, not only in our own in'
terests but those of the community
who have no wish to live in a Social'
istic State.
Conditions of Contract.
Following problems submitted to
the Association, a sub'committee has
been formed to review all forms of
contracts. This committee will have
many deliberations before it will be
in a position to make positive recom'
mendations. A further sub'committee
is also investigating a form of con'
tract for use with subcontractors.
Common Law Insurance.
Considerable publicity has been
given to enormous verdicts granted by
juries in Common Law claims. Re'
cently an employee was awarded
£5,000 for the loss of three fingers
(under Workers’ Compensation Law
such an injury is limited to £750).
The Association recently entered
into an agreement with the Federa'
tion Insurance Company, whereby
many members could obtain conces'
sions in premiums. Insuring with
this company is entirely voluntary on
the part of members. This company,
however, is happy to discuss and ad'
vise on insurance problems, either di'
rectly or through our Association,
even where the member insures with
another company.
“Construction’ ’.
Our official journal “Construction,”
has been a valuable source of informa'
tion to members throughout the year,
and additions to the paper have been
received with great interest. I extend
my sincere thanks to the Editor, Mrs.

Obituary.
It is with sincere regret that I have
to report the passing of a number of
well'known members since my last
report. They included Mr. Harry
Wall, of Messrs. Robert Wall 6? Sons
Pty. Ltd., on 30th November, 1952,
and Mr. Fred. Wilson, 0.8. E., F.I.
0.8., F.A.1.8., of Howie Moffat 6?
Co. Pty. Ltd., on 14th June, 1953.
Social.
Important social functions included
the Annual Dinner at the Wentworth
Hotel on 17th October last. I had
the pleasure of presenting the first
Florence M. Taylor Award to our es'
teemed member Charles F. Gage, F.A.
LB. Mrs. Florence M. Taylor was
herself a recipient of a replica of the
plaque, at my hands, in recognition of
her great efforts on behalf of our call'
ing.
Other activities included the An'
nual Ball, and throughout the year
the Golf and Bowls Clubs held regular
fixtures, the most notable event being
the Interstate James Wall Cup, played
in Adelaide, and won by the South
Australian team. The Cup will be
played in Sydney next year, when it
will be our privilege to act as hosts to
the Interstate visitors.
Conclusion.
It has been a busy year. Action
has commenced on matters which are
of the utmost importance to the As-
sociation. Among these is the re'
drafting of the Rules which is being
conducted by a special sub'committee.
Also it has been decided to move
the Association’s office to a close cen'
tral suburb to cater for the members
and the Exchange more economically
and efficiently.
Following a period as Acting Sec-
retary, Mr. W. D. Ford was appoint'
ed Secretary on 25th November,
1952.

(7) THE MASTER BUILDERS’
ASSOCIATION OF N.S.W.
NEWCASTLE BRANCH.
I have pleasure in presenting this
Annual Report of the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W. Newcastle
Branch, to the Annual Conference
of the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia to be held in Melbourne,
Victoria, in October, 1953, and in do'
ing so I bring best wishes from the
members of the Newcastle Associa'
tion.
Obituary.
It is with regret we record the pass'
ing of the following: L. Uhrig, M.
Mclnerney, E. Wilson (a Past Trus'
tee of the Association), and T. Kind'
er (a Past Secretary of the Associa'
tion) and we join with all other
Building Associations in Australia in
mourning the passing of a Past Presi'
dent of the Federation, the late F.
Wilson.
Membership.
The number of members on the
Register at present is as follows:
Association Members 96
Sub'Contractors 26
Country Association Members .. 22
Exchange Members 35
Country Exchange Members 1
Honorary Members 3
Life Members 1
184
This represents an increase of 6
members to that shown on our last
report.
When we reported to the Federation
last year we were going through a
building recession and expressed the
view that greater productivity and
more efficient operations would be the
foundation of cheaper prices and high'
er standards of living.
We did find that the deterioration
of business in the industry continued
in 1953, but was milder than when
we reported to the last Convention.
Builders were mainly concerned in
completing projects already commenc'
ed and paid less attention to the com'
mencement of new buildings. A
healthier condition in the trade was
observed and our ideal of greater pro'
ductivity was brought nearer to real'
ization. Both labour and materials
have been more readily available.
Costs of building, if not actually re'
duced, have become more stable and
we find a greater percentage of mem'
bers more inclined to place fixed price
tenders than formerly. The cost of
building still constitutes the founda'
tion for its future and to this end it
is hoped that the Federal Budget about
to be presented will reveal such re'
duction in taxation as will enable our
members to stabilize, if not reduce,
their cost in place of rising cost of
wages and some commodities.
Wages and Conditions.
The Association distributes from
time to time a revised list of wages
and current ready'reckoner prepared
by the parent body and the effective
rates of pay from the first full pay
period in August, 1953, as as follows:
Basic Wage £l2 3 0
Bricklayers
Builders’ Labourers:
Higher grade
Lower grade
Carpenters 6? Joiners
Painters
Plasterers
Plumbers
Quantity System.
With the absorption of the Associ'
ated Architects of Newcastle and
District into the Royal Australian In'
stitute of Architects, the Quantity
Agreement which has been operating
in Newcastle over many years was
brought to an end.
For some months the Newcastle
Builders operated without any Quant'
ity System whatsoever and that hiatus
revealed all the evils of our pre'
Quantity days.
Accordingly, as from the Ist July,
1953, the Newcastle Association re'
solved that their members would abide
by the Quantity limits agreed between
the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia and the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects and, in fact,
would not be interested in tendering
for jobs unless quantities were pro'
vided for structures beyond financial
limits set out.
Industrial—State of Trade.
In accordance with the usual prac'
tice we attach statistics showing the
value of new buildings and alterations
for which permits were sought during
the year. We have continued the in'
novation made last year by including
figures of the Newcastle City Coum
cil, Lake Macquarie Shire Council and
Port Stephens Shire Council. To
these we have added estimates of the
work done for those authorities from
which permissions were not required,
and which we now set out as follows:

Federal Building Construction
Prize Examination.
This examination was again con'
ducted at the Newcastle Technical
College when we provided six (6)
candidates.
We were also gratified to be in'
formed that our 1952 candidate, Mr.
Kevin Woodcock, was the winner of
the Prize in that year and at our
General Meeting in July opportunity
was taken to present the winner with
the Certificate and cheque, and at the
same time received the George A.
Taylor Memorial Medal and accorm
panying financial prize.
Theft Signs.
The Theft Signs provided by the
Association for Members in 1952
proved popular and the demand for
same is still continuing.
Lectures.
Several lectures were delivered to
the Association at its General Meet'
ings and the last lecture, which is
commended to all Associations was by
Mr. R. E. Banks, of the Building In'
dustry Research Service and featured
four (4) films as follows: (a) “Soils
and Foundations”—a Sound Film in
colour describing work done by the
Commonwealth Experimental Build'
ing Station and the Division of Soils,
C.5.1.R.0.; (b) Talk illustrated with
coloured slides on the work of the
Division of Forest Products, C.S.I.
R. 0.; (c) An introduction to “Pre'
stressed Concrete,” illustrated by slides;
(d) Prestressed Concrete Tower at
the Warragamba Dam —a Sound Film
in colour produced by the Sydney
Water Board.
The presentation was well received
by a large attendance of members.
Relationships With Kindred
Associations.
Our relationships with the Associ'
ated Architects of Newcastle and Dis'
trict, Timber Merchants’ Association,
Master Painters’ Association, and
Newcastle City Council continued to
be the most cordial, and matters of
common interest are discussed when
they arise and appropriate action
taken.
I also attended the first Annual
Conference of the New Zealand
Master Builders’ Federation (Inc.) in
April of this year which comprised
89 delegates and 26 visitors and ladies.
The notable achievements reported
were: 1. Registration of Builders
comprised by a Board governed by
representatives of Architects and Build'
ers; 2. A very pleasant function was
also arranged to wind up the Con'
vention similar to our own cocktail
party which ladies attend, but in ad'
dition a “change'over” ceremony is
incorporated in the proceedings
where new Executive Officers take
over in proper form from the old
Executives.
Newcastle Technical College.
The Newcastle Association con'
tinues to support the work of the
Newcastle Technical College and again
donated prizes to the winners of
Stages 1 to 5 of the Carpentry and
Joinery Courses.
Miscellaneous.
The social activities of the New-
castle Association are maintained and
this year included an Annual Picnic
to Woolstonecraft, a successful Ladies’
Crazy Card Night, and in August re'
vival of the Association’s Annual
Dinner was featured.
In conclusion we take this oppor'
tunity of expressing the wish that the
deliberations of delegates to this Con-
vention will be both harmonious and
successful and that important deci'
sions will be made for the good of the
building industry in Australia.

Twenty-First Edition Published.
When a technical book becomes a
“best seller” it must have something.
This is the case in regard to Mit-
chell s Building Construction, which
over the past fifty years has run
through twenty-one editions and has
sold over 300,000 copies. That its
popularity is unabated is emphasised
by the fact that the twentieth edition
of 25,000 copies has sold out over the
past three years and the twenty-first
has just come to hand.
This position has been achieved as
a result of the authors’ extraordinary
clarity and conciseness in presenting
the essentials of the subject in simple
language, each point being made the
more readily understandable by means
of the comprehensive series of 1750
specially drawn line diagrams and 32
illustrations in colour.
For upwards of half a century this
work has been recognised as a stand-
ard text book for Architectural Stud-
ents and young Craftsmen training for
entry into the Building Trades, also as
a handy general reference for Build-
ers, Architects, Quantity Surveyors and
Civil Engineers.
The high standard set by the or-
iginal authors in their treatment of
the subject has been consistently main-
tained by the careful revision of each
successive edition so that it has never
been allowed to go out of date. Not
only have the whole of the illustrations
been redrawn in the modern style of
draughtsmanship and their number
supplemented by the introduction of
fresh examples, but the descriptive
letterpress also was revised and
brought into line with the latest codes
of practice.
In the present 21st edition advant'
age has been taken of the opportune
itv to embody alterations necessitated
by the introduction of the new L.C.C.
(Constructional) Bydaws which came
into force in London on the Ist Janu'
ary, 1953, also of the Model Building
Bydaws ( 1952) of the Ministry of
Housing and Local Government.

work, masonry, plumbing, carpentry
slating, tiling, joinery, etc. Training
and construction in these fundamentals
of the building industry do not change
greatly over the years.
Going through the pages and
seeing the correct way that things
should be done, one realises in this
era of indifferent slap-dash work-
manship, how far building practice has
strayed from the straight and narrow
of skilled craftsmanship and sound
practice.
Both the original author, Mr. G. A.
Mitchell, F.R.1.8.A., and his son, Mr.
A. M. Mitchell, B.Sc., are now dead
but the work of revision and editing
has been ably carried out by Mr. W.
Hanneford'Smith, Hon. A.R.1.8.A.,
and Technical Director of B. T. Bats-
Ford Ltd., who has performed his
task ably with the technical assistance
of Mr. Francis Kerr, A.R.1.8.A., and
Mr, E. W. Talbot, A.R.1.8.A.
The House of Batsford is known
throughout the world for its books on
architecture and building and they
certainly must feel a measure of
pride in their continued production
of this “old faithful” that has sup-
plied the “know-how”—to use a mod-
ern expression—for several genera-
tions of craftsmen and builders.
The price of the book with its 648
pages and 1750 diagrams is still at
the amazingly modest figure of 15/-
(English)—similar to any frothy nov-
el—though even this under the exig-
encies of rising costs has gone up from
the ridiculously low figure of 10/6
which characterised the previous edi-
tion in 1950.
Congratulations to the Mitchells and
Batsfords and may there be many more
editions.—A.A.
Exhibition of
Architecture
and Building
May 3rd - 28th, 1954.
An Exhibition of Architecture and
Building is to be held at the Sydney
Town Hall in connection with the
Australian Architectural Convention,
1954.
A feature of this Exhibition will be
an experimental house, portion of
which, showing interiors, will be con'
structed full size.
This house will incorporate some of
the much'debated points in Building
Regulations (Ordinance 71), such as
ceiling under 90 inches, and combined
kitchen and laundries.
It will demonstrate novel methods
of construction, and the Design Com'
mittee are at present considering such
new techniques as cocooning—plastics
for roofing and partitions.
It will show the latest developments
in furniture and interior design, in-
eluding the latest china and pottery
ware, cutlery and general objects of
industrial design for the home, some
of which items are being specially im'
ported from U.S.A.
The kitchen will receive special at'
tention and will incorporate the most
advanced labour-saving devices. Modu'
lar units of kitchen equipment allow'
mg a continuous bench level, and
eliminating present ' day individual
stoves and refrigerators.
The newest techniques in lighting
will be demonstrated, and the house
will be air' conditioned with mass'
produced mechanical air'eonditioning
units.
Progressive manufacturers and com'
mercial firms have been invited to
show their latest products —in fact,
this promises to be a large and very
interesting section of the Exhibition,
and the commercial exhibits are being
designed in harmony with the Ex'
hibition as a whole.
R.A.I.A. Members’
Work.
Another section of the Exhibition
will show photographs and models of
N.S.W. architects’ work, and this sec-
tion will be designed with new display
technique, in itself illustrating con'
temporary concepts of space arrange-
ment.
Other Exhibitions.
An Exhibition will be held of Con-
temporary Architecture from many
overseas countries. Contributions for
this Exhibition have been organised
through the various Consulates and
Government representatives in Aus-
tralia. Also, there will be an Ex-
hibition of Architectural Students’
work from the University of Sydney
and University of Technology,
APPLICATION OF FLUORESCENT
DIMMING CIRCUIT.
Dr. H. H. Ballin and Mr. W. J.
recently delivered before The Illumi-
nating Engineering Society at the
Wellcome Research Institution, Lon'
don, a paper which was in effect a
progress report on the uses of fluores'
cent dimming circuits since their in'
troduction in 1950, and new and sim'
plified dimming circuits designed for
application where the full range of
adjustment is not necessary were de'
monstrated. These included 5 and
20 step miniature dimmers as well as
colour'changing circuits to give flexible
shop window and display lighting.
Attention was drawn to the cases in
industry where a modification of back'
ground and surround brightness is de'
sirable—such as for many inspection
processes or in airfield control towers
where the interior lighting has to be
reduced with fading daylight. Minia'
ture dimmers with fluorescent tubes
have applications in such cases and are
also likely to find application in hos'
pital wards.

This is an artist's impression of the
Jubilee Orchestral Shell which is to be
erected in the Supreme Court Gardens,
Perth, W.A. The construction plan has
been approved and building will begin
shortly. The Shell, of unusual design
insofar as its shape goes does not con-
form to shell design with its acoustical
tendency to direct the sound towards
the audience, will be erected on land-
scaped lawns.
R.S.L CLUB, CRONULLA.
This modern R.S.L. Club was recently
completed at Cronulla, on a site facing
the southern end of the Esplanade. The
building has foundations to carry three
storeys. The ground floor will then
become a games area, the clubroom
proper being on the second floor. Con-
struction is of concrete pier and beam,
with brick infilling. The ceiling of the
main clubroom has been kept flush with
the underside of the beams, and finished
with acoustic plaster tiles. The walls
have been treated with texture finished
white cement. A feature of the interior
are the circular columns constructed
with Formatube impregnated cardboard
tubes. This is the first occasion on
which the architect, Mr. W. Hardy
Morphett, has used this type of con-
struction. Plans are now under prepar-
ation for the addition of a second floor.
The building was erected by sub-con-
tractors, under a general foreman.

with fluorescent stage lighting for
cyclorama and general lighting as well
as for a variety of effects. Its useful-
ness for spectacular production has
been increased by the introduction of
ultra-violet fluorescent tubes for “black
light” effects.
The potentialities as well as the
limitations of employing fluorescent
dimming for flood-lighting buildings
or for the illumination of gardens and
parks was dealt with, it being pointed
out that the recent Coronation festivi-
ties had given a welcome stimulus to
local authorities to enhance the
amenity value of their public buildings
and parks in this way.
Colour - changing flood - lighting is
considered by the authors as being
particularly suitable for theatres, cine-
mas and hotels, and also likely to find
application on public buildings where
for reasons of size or position ordinary
flood-lighting would be ineffectual. In
the choice of colours care has to be
taken to avoid a predominence of any
strong colour, such as green.
The lecturers emphasised the cost
factor and expressed the opinion that
by its efficiency, low cost and great
flexibility, fluorescent dimming could
make a considerable contribution to
better and more artistic lighting.
BOOK REVIEW.
Handcraft in Metal,” by A. J.
Shirley and A. F. Shirley. 244
pages, index, profusely illus-
trated. B. T. Batsford Ltd.,
London.
The present work contains the re-
sult of the experience of several gene-
rations. The basic understanding of
working metals has been handed down
from father to son, and the Shirleys
have been metal workers for many
years. This is not a teacher’s note-
book in as much that it does not sup-
ply a list of topics for talks, hints for
lessons or detailed methods, but it
comprises a wide range of practical
exercises in the different branches of
metal work which serve to illustrate
processes and which can be adapted
and improved. It is intended for the
keen and industrial craftsman, for the
enthusiastic and thinking teacher, and
for the student who is anxious to learn
more than he is taught.
The authors consider that metal-
work is a vital subject to be taught in
school and that there is immeasurable
room for development.
Although this is an age that mass
production and the mechanical con-
struction of most of the articles which
we use every day, there is nothing so
gratifying as the article that is made
by one’s own hands.
This reviewer can remember the late
Mr. James Nangle, one-time Govern-
ment Astronomer of this State and
head of the Sydney Technical College,
telling him that, when full of worries,
he wished to relax. He would retire to
his little private workshop and made
things on his lathe. The mental re-
laxation, he said, was really remarkable.
Design is fundamental in all craft-
work. To the artist, “Design” is often
another term of “Art,” which is an
integral part of all craftsmanship. De-
sign embraces all the problems of
craftsmanship in all forms of line,
shape, colour and technique which are
encountered in all forms of arts and
craft in painting, in lettering, and in
all work in wood and metal.
Side by side with the single prac-
tical examples to be made by the
student are illustrations of work by the
masters of the past —Ghiber.i’s bronze
baptistry doors; Jean Tijou’s magnifi-
cent wrought-iron gates at Hampton
Court Palace; a huge thirteenth cen-
tury Buddha in Japan; Persian brass
ILLUMINATION IN THE MODERN

(Top) Lighting in the Chapel D'Audin-
court is provided through a continuous
panel of coloured transparencies, de-
picting scenes from the lives of the
Apostles. These panels return around
the semi-circular end of the chapel, giv-
ing a greater intensity of light on the
altar. (Bottom) Lighting of oriental
design is provided in this chapel from
reflectors placed behind columns along
the side walls. Lighting is thus similar
to the daylight which comes from win-
dows situated in the walls, also behind
the columns.

bowls: Greco-Roman silver vases; Eng-
lish silverware, and such a fine example
of modern British craftsmanship as the
Stalingrad Sword, made in 1943.
It is very soon apparent perusing
this book that the Shirleys love their
craft and, further, that they are great
teachers not only in fact but also on
paper. We recommend it to all who
wish to truly master this fascinating
craft and to learn all about the thou-
sands of years of tradition that lie
behind it.

SMALL HOMES
SERVICE
Opened by Lord Mayor.
The Small Homes Service
(N.S.W.) which has been organised
by the N.S.W. Chapter of The Royal
Australian Institute of Architects (in
co-operation with the “Sun-Herald”
and the Australian Home Beautiful)
was officially opened recently by the
Lord Mayor of Sydney, Aid. P. D.
Hills, who said that the Service should
be of incalculable value to young folk
“like himself”. The Service is situat-
ed in David Jones’ George St., store.
President of the N.S.W. Chapter,
Mr. E. W. Andrew, outlined the his-
tory of the project, stating that it
had been tried in 1927 while further
efforts to start the Service had been
made just after the war. A similar
Bureau started in Melbourne had prov-
ed successful. All plans submitted by
Chapter members go before the
Selection Committee and when on
display at the Bureau are anonymous.
The Chapter would keep up the sup-
ply of designs and no plan would be
repeated too often.
The N.S.W. Chapter has undoubt-
edly been activated by the most al-
trustic motives in sponsoring this
movement, the desire being to bring
the benefit of the planning and de-
sign of the trained Architect to those
people who would not normally avail
themselves of such service. It would
be regrettable, however, if by the mul-
tiplification of such schemes spon-
sored by newspapers and other organ-
isations, the public should become
confused or the potential worth cheap-
ened by commercial competition.
The publication of sketch designs
for houses to give ideas to people has
been common for many years and
doubtless is hejpful to prospective
home-builders to crystalise their ideas.
The purchase of actual working plans
“over the counter’’ places much more
responsibility upon those concerned to
see that it is suitable for its specific
site, aspect and conditions, for it has
always been regarded as vital in plan-
ning a house to be conversant with
the site upon which it is to be erected.
It is understood that such advice is
available if desired.
The publication of approximate costs
in the accompanying press publicity is
also an aspect that should be carefully
considered, for every architect and
builder realises how much these figures
can be varied by factors that are not
apparent in a plan showing a flat site
and with type of foundations, levels,
the availability of services, etc., all po-
tential variables.
The general public, lacking this ex-
pert knowledge, tend to take such es-
timates as factual and not as purely
indicative figures as is no doubt in-
tended.
If the new Service facilitates the
building of better planned and design-
ed homes for the people it will be a
real service to the community and
earn its lasting gratitude.
Architects and builders will watch
its progress with interest.

Associated Fibrous Plaster Manufacturers
of Australia
Mr. W. C. HARDWICK ELECTED PRESIDENT.
At the recent Annual Conference
in Victoria Mr. W. C. (Bill) Hard'
wick was appointed President of the
Associated Fibrous Plaster Manufac'
turers of Australia.
Mr. Hardwick lives at Hamilton,
Victoria, and his interest in fibrous
plaster has been of many years’
standing. The fact that he has been
President of the Victorian Country
Fibrous Plaster Manufacturers’ Associa'
tion for the past fifteen years indicates
the esteem in which he is held by the
members of that Association and the
work he has done for them. He has
also attended every meeting of the
Federal Association since it was form'
ed in 1945.
Bill Hardwick will be a worthy sue'
cessor to the previous Presidents of
the Federal Organisation.
Production Continues to
Increase.
To show the growth of the Fibrous
Plaster Industry throughout Australia
Mr. Hardwick said at the Annual
General Conference that in 1938-39
the production (in square yards) of
the industry was 7,605,000, whilst in
1952-53 it was 16,128,000, and it is
still going up.
The Federal Association can take a
lot of credit for the amazing increase
in production since the war, as it was
through the efforts of that organiza-
tion that materials were obtained from
overseas at a time when local supplies
were so inadequate. Many members
throughout Australia would have had
to close their factories but for the as-
sistance they received from the Fed'
eral body.
The Federal Presidency has now
been held by a member of each As'
sociation which comprises that body,
and next year will be the start of a
second cycle when Mr. Keith Hopkins
will be elected President just a 100
years after his grandfather arrived in
Melbourne from Wales in 1854.

RESTORATION OF LANCASTER HOUSE
RETURN TO FORMER
SPLENDOUR.
Sir Winston Churchill Gives
Banquet to Queen.
Lancaster House, which is held on
lease from the Commissioners of
Crown Lands by the Ministry of
Works, was badly damaged during the
war. It has recently been restored
and redecorated by the Ministry of
Works and was ready in time for the
banquet to Her Majesty The Queen
which was given on June 5 by Sir
Winston Churchill in the Long Gab
kry.
The north'west wing of Lancaster
House had been destroyed by a bomb
in the winter of 1940/41, and restora'
tion was long overdue. It was begun
in 1950, and the house has been re'
paired and redecorated to its former
splendour, and the Ministry of Works
took the opportunity to install con'
cealed amplifying facilities, indispen-
sable for modern international con'
ferences, and to replace the existing
heating system with modern concealed
heating.
Cost of rebuilding the north-west
wing, of repairing and redecorating
the house, and of replacing the elec-
trical wiring and heating installations,
was £ 140,000,
Redecoration.
The principal rooms on the ground
and first floors are heavily ornamented
in gilded carton pierre. Damaged
carton pierre has been repaired and
missing portions renewed. All such
repairs have been regilded, and gild'
ing throughout has been cleaned,
touched up or renewed according to
condition.
On the ground floor the ante'
rooms, the Gold Room and the Lib'
rary walls are hung with specially'
woven cotton damask, replacing the
silk damask in these rooms which was
badly worn and faded. The damask
lining in the State Dining Room and
the Green Room has been dry'deaned.
In two rooms on the ground floor
the walls are covered with a specially
made wallpaper. This was produced
from blocks which were made and
first used at the time when Lancaster
House was first built.
The main staircase Hall is faced in
scagliola. This has been repaired
where damaged, and cleaned and
polished throughout. The huge lan'
tern light over the main staircase,
which was badly damaged, has been
restored. It weights 80 tons and
measures 45ft. x 38ft. x 10ft.
Many of the existing lighting fit'
tings have been adapted to obtain im-
proved lighting effects.
There are many fine fireplaces in
the building. Most of them are of
marble with applied ornament and
figures in lacquered brass. All have
been repaired, cleaned, and the brass'
work relacquered.
Special ornamental hinges were
made for hanging the large doors
which separate the principal rooms.
These doors had been removed in
1913 and have now been brought
from store, repaired and re-hung.
War Damage Repairs.
The external walls were rebuilt in
stock brickwork faced with Clipsham
stone to match the existing work.
The balustrate to the basement area,
the garden steps and the damaged
wall to Milkmaid’s Passage have all
been rebuilt in Portland stone.
One of the external lamp standards,
which were designed by Wyatt, was
completely destroyed. Another was
damaged beyond repair. They have
been replaced by exact copies. The
gates to Milkmaid’s Passage were very
badly damaged and have been copied
and replaced in the Ministry of
Works’ ornamental smiths’ workshop.
The huge lantern light over the
main staircase was carried on timber

trusses spanning 60ft. and the lower
boom of one of these trusses was
found to be seriously cracked. Heavy
steel beams have been inserted in a
very confined space above the trusses
and the load upon the trusses is now
picked up by stirrups slung from the
steel. All steelwork is entirely con'
cealed.
The heavily ornamented ceiling to
the lantern light had left its support'
ing timbers and was sagging dan'
gerously. It has been pulled back
into position and properly supported.
A new fire alarm system has also
been installed and extra fire mains and
hose reels provided. All wiring f? r
all services is now concealed in walls,
floors or ducts.

COACHING INNS OF EARLY
DAYS.
Colourful Names and Characters.
The rough roads of our early days
and the consequent slowness of travel
called for the erection of many way'
side inns that have since vanished.
On the western road, drovers’ inns,
set at frequent intervals, accommo'
dated the slow passage of flocks and
those who accompanied them; coach'
ing inns gave promise of good cheer
and soft beds to passengers weary of
bumping over pot holes or of walking
up the long hills in order to ease the
horses.
There is something Pickwickian,
something robust and heartening about
the names of many of those old inns,
something romantic about the lights
of Cobb and Co. seen from a pleasant
distance.
All too few of those picturesquely'
named inns will be found beside our
main roads to'day. From the Penrith
Road we can still descry what remains
of the Fox Under the Hill, but Kelly'
ville can no longer show us the Bird
in Hand, or Richmond and Windsor
The Currency Lass or House of
Blazes.
Windsor Coach.
And Sydney is the poorer since Pitt
Street can no longer remember the
George and Dragon from which the
Windsor coach used to set out as late
as 1832, when the journey occupied
only five hours—a fine testimony to
the improved condition of the roads.
When William Roberts ran the first
coach or covered waggon from Wind'
sor to Sydney in 1805, the trip took
16 hours; but those roads were better
suited to bullock teams than carriage
wheels.
Coach fares, by the way, were 5A
per head for passengers from Sydney
to Parramatta, and 7/6 for the
Sydnev ' Hawkesbury run. Road haul'
age of goods was very dear, and every
bushel of wheat road'borne paid 1/4
from Windsor to Sydney.
The Black Horse.
A notable inn. one that figures in
many stirring tales, is the Black Horse
at Richmond. It still stands on the
left of the road (approaching from
the Blacktown side), looking rather
small and subdued beside the concrete
highway, although no longer an inn.
The oldest licensed house in Rich'
mand, it had its licence in 1819 and
probably was an inn before that date.
Mine Host Randall, the licensee, was
a man of importance, and so was
Monsieur Mason, the chef. The fame
of his dishes spread far and wide, for
he had the touch of genius in his
fingertips. The inn was a favourite
honeymoon resort for The Quality
and many names notable in our early
history have been entered in its
register.
The First Election,
The Black Horse saw some hectic
scenes when William Bowman won
the first election, of 1843, from Robert
Fitzgerald, by one vote. (Only the
previous year election by vote of free-
holders had been granted to take the
place of a nominated legislature with
advisory powers to assist the Cover'
nor, wha was, till then, practically
absolute.)
The winning vote that put Bowman
in was attributed to Billy McAlpin,
who rode night and day from The
Cockfighter, three miles the other side
of Bulga, to give Bowman his vote.
The excitement was intense. A
table was put in the street in front
of the Black Horse Inn and from it
singers entertained the crowd, while
liquor flowed in a continuous stream.
(“Dry” elections were unthought'of
in those days.)
Odd Cases.
They tried some odd cases at Wind'
sor, and there was the time that a
disputed account between a blacksmith
and a farmer caused the blacksmith to
be ordered to bring his books into
court. He fetched in the door on
the back of which he always scored
up his accounts.

Roads Round Sydney.”
DEATH OF W. S. P. GODFREY.
Veteran Victorian Architect.
The death occurred recently of Mr.
William Scott Purves Godfrey, at the
age of 81. Mr. Godfrey was a Past
President of the Royal Victorian In-
stitute of Architects.
Born in Toorak in 1872, he retired
in 1946 after being in practice for
half a century. He was principal of
the firm of Godfrey and Spowers, and
supervised the erection of many of
Victoria’s leading buildings, including,
in more recent times, the head office
of the Bank of New South Wales in
Collins Street, Melbourne, which won
the Street Architectural Medal of the
R.V.I.A. for excellence in architecture.
Mr, Godfrey was admitted to As'
sociateship of the Institute in 1895,
and was advanced to Fellowship in
1913. Life Fellowship was conferred
him in 1946 as a mark of appreciation
of his services to the profession.
Mr. Godfrey was largely responsible
for the introduction of the Architects’
Bill in 1922, and when that measure
became law he became a foundation
member of the Architects’ Registration
Board in 1923, and he was Chairman
of the Board in 193U33.
The Institute’s Bulletin says it is
unique in the history of the profession
in Victoria that Mr. Godfrey and his
son, Mr. Race Godfrey, principals of
the same firm, have both served as
Presidents of the R.V.I.A.

KWINANA IS A NATIONAL
LESSON.
New City Rising in the West.
Kwinana, destined to be the third
city of Western Australia, is the only
pre-planned city venture in Australia
since the great Canberra experiment.
But it shows far greater promise of
early success than Canberra.
Time and opportunity were well
matched in 1952: the Anglo-Iranian
Oil Company announced its intention
to establish a £40,000,000 oil refinery
in Western Australia, just when a
State Government was deeply concern-
ed with the need for planned decen-
tralisation.
On Cockburn Sound.
With Government encouragement,
the oil company selected a site of 950
acres thirty miles from Perth, on the
shore of Cockburn Sound, a broad
anchorage sheltered by Garden Island.
Agreement was reached concerning
the provision of roads, railways,
wharves, deep water facilities and
houses. The State Government un-
dertook to build 1000 homes for oil
workers within two and a-half miles
of the refinery. But something far
more ambitious was being planned—
a completely new town to serve not
only the refinery, but other industries
which the Government believed would
follow.
B.H.P. Move.
Tremendous impetus was given to
the Scheme when B.H.P. announced
that a steel rolling mill would be
located at Cockburn Sound at a cost
of £4,000,000. In December, 1952,
the Government resumed a site of 529
acres for B.H.P. adjoining the refinery
and another 580 acres for the first
section of a city two miles inland.
Miss Margaret Feilman, a town
planner with overseas experience, was
appointed to design the new city, the
plan of which provides for an ulti-
mate population of 20,000 or 25,000
in four neighbourhoods, each of about
5000 people.
Nor is Kwinana just a plan, but
already something of a reality. In
January, 1953, when work began on
the refinery, tenders had already closed
for the first hundred houses in Medina,
power mains were being erected from
Fremantle and 10-inch water mains
were being laid. On the shoreline, a
500-foot rubble jetty was beginning
to push its way into the Sound and a
construction camp for 400 men had
been started.
By May 8, when the first ten houses
were occupied at Medina, a further
209 were under construction. The
Minister for Housing revealed plans
for accommodation of 1500 people in
permanent new homes this year and
5500 within two and a-half years.
Professor Stephenson's
View.
Meanwhile, Professor Gordon
Stephenson, of Liverpool, planning
consultant to the Western Australian
Government, has expressed the view
that Kwinana’s industries will attract
a population of 40,000 instead of
20,000 as originally estimated. This
would mean that Kwinana would sup-
plant Fremantle as the State’s second
city. It may mean that two new
towns will be built instead of one.
Whatever the ultimate size or shape
of Kwinana, it is a tremendous lesson
to the wealthy, populous and fertile
eastern States of Australia which, up
to now, have only paid lip service to
decentralisation.
—Extracts from “Civic Development.’’
Three-quarters of Australia’s freight
in 1951-52 was carried by road. Lat-
est figures reveal that road vehicles
carried 195,000,000 tons (76.5%), the
railways 48,000,000 tons (18.7%),
ships 11,750,000 tons (4.6%), air-
lines 55,000 tons .2%).

open-type plan on the ground floor,
with living and dining rooms and
kitchen grouped together. Upstairs,
there is one generous main bedroom
•and three smaller bedrooms, opening
on to a free space intended as a play
area for children. Built-in wardrobes
and cupboards make up for the lack
of space in the smaller rooms, which
are 7ft. by 7ft. A car port below
the upper storey is a new feature for
Trust homes.
At the same time, it has been an-
nounced that the Trust’s programme
for 4000 prefabricated homes in the
metropolitan area will be completed in
August next year. Most of these
have been bought under contract, 3000
from Britain and 1000 from Germany.
The present rate of completion is
about 100 a month.
The Housing Trust was unfortunate
in that the demand for homes eased
slightly, due to rising building costs,
at about the time its prefabricated
house programme reached its peak.
As a result these houses, at upwards
of £2BOO apiece, have been difficult to
sell, and more than 400 of them have
been rented. It is still possible to
buy a timber home on application,
while there is a wait of about six
months for a brick or stone house.
A new form of house construction
is expected to begin in earnest next
year, with the production of mono-
crete units by Concrete Industries

the interlocking wall units, with win-
dow and door frames precast into
them, the walls of a house can be
erected within a few days, the units
being handled by cranes. An advan-
tage in the “wild” ground that afflicts
most of Adelaide is that the weight
of a monocrete building is less than
half of one of brick construction,
although lighter foundations are pro-
phesied for monocrete jobs.
Along with cement, still “under the
counter, ’ another building material
has failed to live up to the hopes ex-
pressed for it when controls were lift-
ed early this year. This is galvanised
iron, where the position, according to
the Premier (Mr. Playford) has “de-
teriorated very badly indeed.” With
outstanding orders now about 16,000
tons (they were about 1400 when con-
trols were lifted) this might be con-
sidered almost an understatement.
Various factors have been blamed for
the shortage in S.A., including shortage
of shipping, but as the manufacturers
states that the same quotas for the
States as under Commonwealth con-
trol have been maintained, it seems
likely that lack of production is the
reason, with price control at the bot-
tom of everything.
Some of the city’s oldest and most
respected buildings have come under
fire from architects, the latest being
the sandstone front of Police Head-
quarters, once the Supreme Court, com-
plete with its Doric columns. Behind
the facade, however, there lurks a
rabbit-warren of dark, tortuous cor-
ridors, peeling walls and decaying
stonework. It has been suggested
that in any plan for the future of
Adelaide the claims of history and
sentiment should be over-ruled, and
that this and other unsightly strategi-
cally placed Government buildings,
which may have been paragons of
architecture in their day, should give
way to something more in keeping
with the 20th century.
Modernisation of a different kind
has overtaken the old brick and stone
Legislative Council building, next door
to the handsome grey marble Parlia-
ment House. Prompted by questions
in that same Parliament, a work of
extexior renovation has begun, to
render the ancient pile a little more
presentable for the Royal Tour. How-
ever, as this renovation invedves pick-
ing out the old brickwork in various
shades of red, and painting the stone-
work in many colours, the result is
not so far acclaimed as an improve-
ment.
In the 12 months ended November.
1952, steel works at Newcastle and
Port Kembla, and the electric steel
plant at Whyalla used 404,000 tons
of steel scrap.

BUILDERS
AND
MASTER PAINTERS
Ever since the Berger Group of
Companies pioneered the estab-
lishment of a Paint and Colour
Advisory Bureau known as the
Mayfair Colour Centre, this unit
has proved of great assistance to
Builders, Master Painters, Con-
tractors, Architects and others
interested in the problems of
surface treatments on buildings,
new and old.
To-day throughout Australia
thousands of homes, factories,
offices, hospitals, banks and other
institutions have been colour
schemed by Mayfair, with results
that have always reflected credit
on the Contractor concerned.
The services of the Mayfair
Colour Centre are given com-
pletely without charge. Skilled
colour consultants prepare colour
schemes for smaller buildings and
carry out a complete pre-paint-
ing survey for larger projects
where paint and colour are used
not only to beautify and protect,
but also to improve working
conditions, assist in traffic control,
help prevent accidents, increase
production efficiency and fulfil
numerous other functional tasks.
The Mayfair Colour Centre is
always available to help in
YOUR painting problems. May-
fair is a SERVICE unit and
wants to be of service to YOU.

BRIDGE BUILT OVER NOTHING
Novel Techniques Amuse and
Amaze.
In January, 1938, police at Marra'
kesh, in Morocco, were called upon
to solve their biggest theft case.
Someone had stolen a railway bridge!
Twenty feet long, made of iron,
and weighing seven tons, the bridge
had spanned a river on a disused sec'
tion of railway.
The police eventually arrested a
Moor, who confessed he had hired
four men to dismantle and remove the
bridge. Although they took 10 days
to do the job, no one saw the men
at work. The Moor then sold the
scrap to a dealer.
The Swiss have a bridge that they
build every spring and dismantle in
the autumn. It’s big enough to carry
a railway across the Steffenbach, near
Davos, but only requires seven men to
shift it.
Engineers evolved the idea of a pre-
fabricated bridge after winter aval'
anches annually removed every trace
of the tracks, arches, and founda'
tions of the old rigid structure.
Last year engineers at Calverton,
Notts (Eng.), had the local inhabi-
tants guessing when they built a bridge
over nothing. Sited on the Papple-
wick Road, it was first supplied with
abutments at each end. To take
these, deep trenches were dug. Next,
the reinforced concrete deck was laid
flat along the ground.
Not until then did the bulldozers
arrive to make the cutting for Cal'
verton Colliery’s new branch line.
They dug straight under the bridge,
which was revealed complete for the
first time.
The strangest bridges of all are to
be found in China, where they are
often built zig'zag, to stop evil spirits
following people across.
ELECTRICITY IN INDUSTRY.
World Figures.
Data of interest relating to the an'
nual use of electricity in respect of
the per capita generation and the use
per worker has been collected by the
United Nations Economic Commission.
Variations in available data arise
from difficulties in estimating such
things as the population of East Ger-
many, but the figures given below are
relatively comparable.
ALUMINIUM TRUSSES.
Aluminium trusses of hangar at Hatfield
Airport. These 2-pin portal frames at
30ft. centres give a clear height of 45
ft. over a floor area 200 ft. wide by
330 ft. long. The hangars will house

BOOK REVIEW.
“Australasian Building Knowledge'’
—Vol. Ill by C. J. Virgo and
J. G. Walls, 307 pp., illustrated,
45/'; Vol. IV by C. J. Virgo,
384 pp., illustrated, 40A. Both
published by William Brooks &
Co. (Q.) Pty. Ltd.
Vol. Ill, “Builders’ Estimating and
Quantities,’ ’and Vol. IV, “Building
Consrtuction (Stage 3), Building
.Materials and Building Practice,” have
just been received for review. Vol. I,
“Building Construction and Drawing
(Stage 1),” and Vol. II, “Building
Construction and Drawing (Stage 2),
Hygiene and Sanitation,’ ’have been
previously.
Vol. Ill, dealing with the vital as-
pects of a builder’s work—interpret'
ing Bills of Quantities and Estimating
—follows naturally on the previous
two on Building Construction, for
pricing is not possible if methods of
construction are not thoroughly un'
derstood in all the breakdown aspects
of labour and material.
The authors are signally qualified to
handle this volume, Mr. C. J. Virgo
being Lecturer-in-charge of the Depart'
ment of Building at the Central Tech'
mioal College, Brisbane, and Supervis'
ing Architect, State Department of
Works, Queensland, and Mr. J. G.
Walls being Past'President of the
Queensland Institute of Quantity Sur'
veyors and a part-time lecturer at the
University of Queensland.
There is no intention or effort to
make this a textbook for Quantity
Surveyors say the authors, but they
believe this Volume to be the first
attempt to apply Australian conditions
in a publication on the subject of
Quantities and Estimating, nearly all
the recognised works being by English
authors based on English practice.
“Due to the prevailing unstable
conditions in the Building Industry, it
will be realised that, in estimating, it

rials and labour, but the method and
principle employed should, however,
be applicable and can be readily ad'
justed to meet varying conditions.”
Each trade has a chapter of its own,
and the relevant sections of the Bill
dealt with. Plans of a small, spacious
building are included, and a set of
quantities taken of therefrom and
then priced so that the complete job
from start to finish is clearly set out
for study.
Vol. IV.
Vol. IV, which is the final volume,
is divided into three sections Ad'
vanced Building Construction and
Drawing; the Technology of Building
Materials, and Building Practice, and
at the end of each of the seventeen
chapters are a set of exercises whereby
the student can, if he so desires, con-
duct a self-examination of his know-
ledge. The text is well illustrated
with 37 line-drawings and the scope
of the text is very wide.
One would have liked to see a
section dealing with mechanical plant
in the Building Industry, for there
seems little doubt that in this era of
appallingly high building costs it is
only by the greater efficiency possible
by the use of such mechanical aids
that the high labour cost content of
every contract can be limited to some
extent. Although this means initial
capital outlay, the right equipment for
the right type of work skilfully em-
ployed can be made to pay dividends.
It is noticeable that the quality of
the paper in the final volume is better
than that in Vol. 111, and this is an
advantage.
Altogether ,the authors can be com-
mended for a sincere effort to produce
a series of reliable, informative text-
books specifically designed for the
Australian student of building.
This same firm of publishers were
responsible for producing “Australian
Building Practice,” by James Nangle,
in 1900, which was the first serious
attempt to develop a technical book
for students of Architecture and
Building in this country. They de-
serve praise for their performance over
the years in this important sphere.
CORONATION CARPET.
Queen Elizabeth II.’s coronation
carpet cost £6600, or nearly £3 a sq.
yd., which is extraordinarily cheap.
Any super-grade Axminster or Wilton
carpet today 27” x 1 yard long will
cost 84/-, so that a square yard of
such a carpet should cost £5/12/0
Bids for the Royal carpet up to
18,000 have been received from
U.S.A. The 1937 coronation carpet
went for 28/' a sq. yd., mainly to
churches.

The wise and discerning contractor realises that his reputation
for service and dependability is based to a great extent upon the
skill, integrity and co-operation of his sub-contractors.
MAJOR
The painting has long been regarded as. No. 1
“headache” for builders. No other trade presents
so many pitfalls, involving the builder in endless
disputes and untold worry, unless discrimination
is exercised in choice of painting sub-contractors.
Successful builders carefully select an old established
firm, renowned for a complete and thorough under-
standing of all aspects of the painting trade. For
years leading Sydney builders have been saying:
“No headaches for us. We give our sub-
contract painting to AXTELLS. and forget
about it.”

“SKYSCRAPER CITIES”
PLANNED FOR LONDON
To Re-house Thousands of People.
London’s growing traffic congestion
and increasing housing shortage is
causing many to wonder just where it
will all end.
Although new towns are being built
in the outer country ring beyond the
green belt, they have not as yet prov'
ed a satisfactory solution to the prob'
lems confronting London.
Transportation, as in Australian
cities, is a maj-or problem to contend
with, and the time is rapidly coming
when consideration will have to be
given to transportation of feet by ele'
vators, rather than miles by bus, tram
or car that clutter up the roads and
make traffic jams galore, as well as
wasting much time—our priceless as'
set.
LONDON SKYSCRAPERS.
How "High Paddington," as described
in the article, would appear. This revo-
lutionary plan envisages a self-contained
400ft. skyscraper city, with an 8000 pop-
ulation, rising above an existing railway

SUPPORT THIS PURELY AUSTRALIAN COMPANY
A recent proposal in England, and
one with a great deal of merit —was
for the construction of a skyscraper
city in the heart of London —a moun-
tain of tall buildings which could house
an integrated community, with shops,
light industry, warehouses, and flats.
A site was suggested above a tangle
of railway lines, near the Mansion
House, between Barbican and Moor-
gate Streets. One writer proposed that
the city should be called “High Bar'
bican. ”*
Not Unique.
The idea of “High Barbican” is not
unique of its kind. A plan already
exists in detail to build a city of sky'
scrapers over a railway goods yard
in the densely crowded district of Pad'
dington, London, iust north of Hyde
Park.
It would be a town rising to 400 ft.
and big enough to house 8000 people
(see illustration).
That is just about the size of Pad'
dington’s re'housing problem, experts
say.
The project consists of a base 60ft.
high and covering a little more than
the goods yard, an area 18 acres in all
—about 40 times less than the space
needed to house 8000 people today in
the district.
The base would contain a major de'
partment store, warehouses, a cinema,
a swimming pool, besides parking
space for 1000 vehicles.
The top of this base would become
the town centre, with shops, restaur'
ants, promenades, and gardens. Tow-
ering about these would be the flats
themselves, in three gigantic blocks.
A novel design provides each flat
with its own garden, sheltered from
the weather by an outer glazed skin
that can be adjusted to exclude high
winds.
The architect claims this feature
means a warm home in winter, econ-
omical to heat, and in summer a horn*

And no matter how high it stands
in this vertical town, no home, he says,
is farther than five minutes from the
town centre. If needed the whole
population could be brought down to
ground'level bv lifts in 15 minutes.
Hospitals, schools and church build'
ings are forging ahead, as they should
do, looking after the welfare of men
from the cradle to the grave, but the
in'between business men, whose enter'
price has built up the nation, are not
being looked after at all. As a matter
of fact their activities are suppressed
at every turn. Mostly by silly legisla'
tion which is sending them out of the
city they help to build up. into the
outer suburbs. The incur terrific
losses in sacrificing their built'up :on-
nections.

The Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. recently completed
new day and shift laboratories at their Clyde Refinery,
N.S.W. For high efficiency, simple maintenance and
dignified appearance Shell selected A.G.E. Doric
Fluorescent Lighting Units for both laboratories. The
photograph shows the flush ceiling mounting and the
inset line drawing illustrates the “in line” mounting of
the Doric 4 ft. 40 watt units.
A special feature of Doric fittings is the ease of removing
the end covers for cleaning the diffusing medium or
replacing a tube. A plastic cord prevents the end cover
from falling while the perspex bend is withdrawn.
Ask the lighting specialists at any A.G.E. Office or
Agent how Doric fittings can he applied to YOUR
needs.
