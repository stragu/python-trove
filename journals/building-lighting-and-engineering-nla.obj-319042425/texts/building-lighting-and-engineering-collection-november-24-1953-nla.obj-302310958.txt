Withdraw these
panel pins after
fixing adjoining
sheet.
The smooth, even surface of
Masonite Presdwoods is one of
the reasons why they are so
popular for lining walls and par-
titions. To help you get the most
out of this Masonite feature,
here is the correct nailing pro-
cedure.
Order of nailing is clearly explained in
this illustration. By starting in the centre
and working outwards, any wave in the
sheet is ironed out. Nail the centre of
the sheet at 12” to 14" intervals and
space nails at 4” to 6" intervals around
the edges. Nails recommended are
or I" 16-gauge panel pins. Trimming is
essential behind joins, and studs should
never be more than 16" apart.
Never butt sheets hard together. A
good idea is to lightly tack two or three
panel pins into stud against edge of
fixed sheet and nail adjoining sheet
into position against them. These panel
pins can then be withdrawn, leaving a
uniform space between sheets to allow
for possible expansion; when finally
painted this space is barely discernible.

GRINNELL SPRINKLERS PUT OUT THE FIRE
Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler systems guard millions
of pounds worth of Australian property 24 hours a
day, 365 days of the year. Insurance companies
reduce your insurance premiums by as much as 50%
as soon as Grinnell is installed. That’s why, in time,
Grinnell pays for itself.
If you’re insured, you are paying for Grinnell protec-
tion right now. Why not have it?
At 8 o’clock on Saturday night
the foyer of the 2UW Theatre
was thronged with patrons
enjoying a smoke. One smoker
carelessly dropped his cigarette butt on
the settee instead of into the ash tray
beside it. The glowing butt became so
firmly wedged into the cushions that it
was hidden from the Theatre Manager
when he made his usual inspection
before leaving the Theatre.
At midnight a brisk blaze
broke out in the cushions.
Heat rose to the ceiling and
burst the. Grinnell Sprinkler
head. The fire was out in 30 seconds.
At the same time an alarm automatically
rang in the fire station. Two minutes
later the brigade arrived and shut off
the water.
For all information contact Wormald Brothers in your State.

THE NEW DESPOTISM
x , T, he " o kf cert^ ml y been a great swing of the pendulum from the “Todpuddle
Martyrs of 1834 to the Compulsory Unionism of 1953. This swing is so drastic and
so out of balance that it threatens to wreck the delicate mechanism of the social clock.
Most fair-minded people of today feel horror and amazement when they
read in their history books of the cruel fate of those six simple English yokels who
hut wanted to band together for self'help and were transported for seven years for
this “crime”. With the imminent spectre of Compulsory Unionism in New South
Wales they had better revive those feelings for their own plight, for the new des-
potism op the Trade Union Boss is upon them and it could make the unfeeling selfish-
ness of the ruling class of the Todpuddle era look like philanthropism in comparison
While in the light of these extreme developments it is, perhaps, excusable to feel
that had the Todpuddle incident nipped Trade Unionism in the bud once and for all
it would have been a good thing for humanity, on reflection this opinion could not
be sustained, for it was the only way in which the working man could utilise his num-
erical strength to secure his rights. But rights are one thing and the brutal use of
this strength is very different. We have fought two wars in our lifetime to prove
that Might is not Right and the United Nations Organisation is based upon the basic
freedom of the individual.
At first, no doubt, the majority of Unionists thought it seemed a fine idea
that those who willy-nilly enjoyed the benefits for which they had fought, should
be forced to come into the fold, strange as it may seem that, in view of all the ad-
vantages of union membership claimed, they had not been lining up in queues.
Some are now having second thoughts and seeing some aspects of the other
side of the picture and several powerful unions, including the radical Actors’ Equity
have openly declared against the move. Many more may begin to have misgivings
when they learn of the current edict by the Czars of the Meat Industries Employees’
Union that wives of members who are working must give up their jobs by December
I—or1 —or else! And that’s only a sample of what it will be when you hand over your
right to work to someone else who doesn’t necessarily care a damn for you —and
that is just what Compulsory Unionism means!
Premier Cahill was regarded by the Building Industry as the best Minister
for Local Government that N.S.W. had seen in modern times. He was industrious,
logical and fair. Since the Cloak of Premiership has fallen upon him he appears to
have lost all those admirable qualities one by one. Before he had a mind of his
own, but now he seems to have succumbed completely to the now openly displayed
domination of the Trades Hall.
We thought he was a bigger man.

SOUTH AFRICA FORGES AHEAD
FINE BUILDINGS BEING ERECTED
Grand Parade Centre, Cape Town, is just one of the fine buildings to
be erected in this progressive city since the war. Sydney can point to
nothing like this and although recently there have been one or two
projects mooted no activity of any moment has as yet resulted.

THE TOWNSVILLE CENTRAL POWER STATION
IMPORTANT PROJECT COMPLETED.
BUILT BY M. R. HORNIBROOK (PTY.) LIMITED.
The new £4,000,000 Central Elec-
tricity Generating Station at South
Townsville, which was recently official-
ly opened, is an important link with
major Queensland electricity develop-
ments.
The Authorities are confident that
it will not only remove the fear of
any “blackouts,” but will ensure for
any existing and prospective industrial
undertakings a security in progressive
North Queensland.
Three Stations
Administered by the Townsville
Regional Electricity Board, the new
£4,000,000 electricity undertaking will
play a very active part in Queensland's
plan for regional electrification.
Ninety per cent, of the capital in-
vested in the new generating supply
centre was subscribed by people out-
side the Townsville district. The new
centre is one of three major develop-
mental projects which will cost a total
of more than £12,000,000.
Under the Queensland Electricity
Commissioner’s plans, the three stations
were to be finished’.simultaneously.
(In Brisbane, the Bulimba B Power'
house will be in operation before
Christmas, generating 30,000 kilowatts,
to feed an area from Gympie to the
border and west to the Darling Downs.
An £8,000,000 powerhouse, built in
three sections, is the immediate ob-
jective.)
Supply Ensured.
According to the Commissioner for
Electricity Supply, Mr. E. N. Smith,
the new South Townsville generating
centre will ensure uninterrupted elec-
tricity supplies for all local require-
ments and for any new industries
which may be developed in North
Queensland for years to come.
Regional electrification, he said, was
more or less based on a “marriage”
between central and local in.erests,
which entails the pooling of all re-
sources, all brains and, most important
of all. good-will and co-operation.
Construction involved considerable
filling, provision of a seawall, driving
of piles and the construction of a
reinforced concrete raft, and reclama-
tion required the deposit of some
160,000 cubic yards of fill on the
Power Station site proper as well as
a large amount (approx. 150,000
cubic yards) on the other areas need'
ed for auxiliary buildings.
The seawall at the Power Station
site is 1140 ft. long plus 1100 ft. to
connect with the existing wall near the
oil tanks. 1350 30ft. long piles of
red stringy bark or rose'gum (flooded
gum) were also used.
The concrete raft foundation for the
turbo'alternators and boilers required
3600 cubic yards of concrete and 220
tons of reinforcing steel.
Massive Building.
The approximate final dimensions
of the building are 230 ft. wide by
210 ft. long by 110 ft. high (excluding
the chimneys)! Floor area is 48,300
sq. ft. The structure consists of a
steel-frame and reinforced concrete
walls, floors, etc.
The general layout shows parallel
turbine and boiler rooms with a pump
bay in between. Ample provision is
made for stores, loading bay, work'
shops and amenity rooms for staff.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


The turbine room and loading bay are
commanded by a main crane with 40-
ton, 10-ton and 3-ton equipment. The
pump bay crane will handle loads up
to five tons.
Architecturally, the buildings are
very good externally and clean-cut
and attractive internally. Modern
colour schemes have been used for all
finishes and items of plant, and terazzo
flooring has been extensively used, and
staff amenities include provision of
steel lockers and messrooms, etc.
The loading bay is adjacent to the
railway system, and main crane can
load on to or unload from railway
trucks from railway trucks or road
vehicles.
Plant.
Three steam turbo - alternators are
installed, each capable of constant out-
put 7500 kW generating energy at
11.000 volts. Total output, 22,500
kW. Present maximum demand is
13.000 kW. A further 15,000 kW
turbo - alternator and its associated
boilers have been ordered and should
be installed early in 1955, and ten-
ders will be called for a further and
final 15,000 kW unit for installation
by 1957-58. The expected total final
capacity of station is 52,500 kW.
A unit is a turbine and two boilers
and it is intended that each unit
should be operated separately, although
the pining arrangements allow for the
boilers to be operated on the common
rail system if desired or, alternately,
for any turbine to be operated by the
pair of boilers on either side of it.
The first six boilers of well-known
cross tube type have each a capacity
of 50,000 lb. per hour M.C.R. with a
stop valve pressure of 415 lb. per sq.
inch, at a temperature of 765 degrees
F. and have chain grate stokers, but
the other four boilers capacity
100.000 lb. per hour will be equip-
ped with spreader stokers.
Boilers are arranged for balanced
draught, the forced and induced
draught fans being situated above the
boilers and secondary air fans are in
the basement.
Condensing water from Ross Creek
is pumped through a rising main, 2300
feet long, and then discharged into
the sea.
Boilers and turbo-alternators are of
U.K. origin, but the Power Station
switchgear, control equipment, trans-
formers and distribution switchgear are
almost entirely of Australian manufac-
ture. An 100% British Common-
wealth effort.
Turbo-alternators, 15,000 kW. These
are double rotation types supplied with
condensers and feed heating plant.
Switchgear and Isolators. This is
generally of indoor 11,000 volt (push-
button controlled type), but there is
also a small quantity of 66,000 volt
outdoor switchgear, etc., provided.
Protective Equipment. Overload
protective equipment with Buchholz
relays is provided on main and house
transformers and overload and earth
leakage protection provided on all out-
going feeders.
Control Gear. The complete con-
trol gear for the ultimate station has
been installed at once to secure uni-
formity. There are three switchrooms
provided at present and eventually
there will be five switchrooms.
House Turbo-altemator, 415 Volt,
Set 750 kW. This is connected to the
main L.T. switchboard and it is power-
ful enough to start the station initially
and to act similarly if a blackout
should occur.
Coal Bunkers. These have been ar-
ranged to hold sufficient coal to enable
the estimated week-end load to be car-
ried from noon on a Friday until noon
on a Monday without any intake of
coal.
Efficiency Control. Various meters
have been installed to enable energy
consumption, steamflow, coal used,
etc., to be ascertained.
The steam pipework installed is be-
lieved to be the first all-welded instal-
lation in the State.
Ash-handling Plant. After flyash,
grit, etc., has been sprayed with water’
by boiler nozzles and sluicing heads,
it is carried on submerged belt con-
veyors and the wet ashes are taken by
belt conveyors to ash hoppers and
finally to motor lorries.
Most Modern
.n Australia.
The control room, the nerve centre
of the station, is claimed to be one of
the most modern in Australia. When-
ever a breakdown occurs, it is prompt'
ly recorded on the particular panel
dealing with the section. A shutter
drops, a klaxon blows and lights flash
on, enabling the operator to pinpoint
the area of the breakdown.
The control room also contains the
microphone for the public address sys'
tern, and the station telephone ex-
change.
At the opening ceremony, the State
Minister for Mines, Mr. E. J. Riordan,
paid a tribute to the State Electricity
Commission, which initially planned
the development of North Queensland
and designed and played a major part
in collaboration with the Board and
its officers in the construction of the
South Townsville Power Station, in
the procurement of plant and mate-
rials, and in the provision of funds
for the work.
Sub-contractors.
The following sub-contractors were
associated with the work:—

Towns and Buildings Through The Ages
FASCINATING NEW BOOK.
Reviewed by Adrian Ashton, F.R.I.B.A.
Of recent years there has been a
spate of books on Town Planning,
and every aspect of the subject
historical, technical and sociological,
past, present and future has been
thoroughly analysed and discussed by
many experts.
The present work, by Steen Eiler
Rasmussen, is slightly different in that
it can be described as “cultural history”
told in a new way. The reader travels
to China’s ancient capital of Peking;
to Rome; to Paris; to London, and to
many other cities, and at each stage of
the journey he learns to know the
town with its streets, its places, and
buildings, as a monument to a par-
ticular way of life.
He learns to understand the dif-
ference between French and English
culture by comparing Paris and Lon-
don and tracing their development
down the centuries. The buildings
are seen not as individual architec-
tural works, but as component parts
of a whole, and our author tells us
how they were originally conceived
and of the life that was led within
them. When he feels that words
alone are inadequate, he illustrates his
thoughts with small and large draw-
ings, sketches of streets and buildings
and of the people who have lived in
the houses.
Even though perhaps history does
not exactly repeat itself, it becomes
clear that there are present-day prob-
lems which appear easier of solution
when we see them against the back-
rounding him, and thus it was logical
countries have produced.
To make similarities or contrasts
easier to comprehend, most of the
Town Plans are reproduced to the
same scale, 1 : 20,000; thus it is in-
teresting to compare the size of an-
cient Greek and Roman cities with
mediaeval towns and with the street
layout of some well-known modern
city.
Ancient Citv of Peking.
It is perhaps unusual to find the
first city dealt with being Peking, the
caiptal of old China, which is de-
scribed as a most majestic and illumi-
native example of sustained town plan-
ning.
Developing the theme of whether
planning is founded on logic or mys-
tical fancy, he explains that in ancient
Peking every house and every temple
had to be built according to ritual, for
it was much more than a capital: it
was the residence of an Emperor who
as the “Son of Heaven” was a god.
Thus all houses were one-storey only
in height so that no-one could see
over the walls of the Emperor’s Palace
—“The Forbidden City.”
That such ritualistic planning is not
entirely confined to the East is em-
phasised by the fact that since early
times it has been mandatory for all
Christian churches to be built with the
chancel at the east end. This, says
the author, is not founded on com-
monsense; it is ritual.
Further, when the French monarch
became absolute, a system of rules and
regulations was evolved governing his
conduct and the conduct of those sur-
rounding him, and thus it was logical
that he should live in a city which was
just as systematically built up around
the king.
Again, when the Third Reich was
created with Hitler as a leader, who
was a godhead for his people, it was
necessary to form German city plan-
ning according to special rites with
axes and halls and processional roads.
The 'Mediaeval City.
In the mediaeval city the castle was
one dominating factor and the church
the other. The church was wealthy
and was the important cultural link
with the outside world; an international
organism which has never been equal-
led since. And finally, the church
was the consolation and hope of the
downtrodden masses who lived in the
mean, small houses of the towns —the
hope of a life hereafter better than the
life of to-day.
Gradually, as payment-in-kind gave
way to a money economy, the position
of the towns changed. Commerce be-
gan to boom, the commoners became
more and more conscious of their own
strength and felt a growing independ-
ence of both temporal and spiritual
powers. They were no longer willing
to accept the hereafter as the essential
meaning of life. People wanted to live
here and now; they were more interest-
ed in their fellow-men than in angels.
Natural sciences, based on mathe-
matics, flourished. Society took over
not only part of the power of the
church but also some of its obligations.
There arose the desire to create an
ideal city, not as the background of a
church or an adjunct to a castle, but
as an independent and well-rounded
whole for an ordinary civic com-
munity, well-protected against all ag-
gressors, a classical Republic like the
Greek city-states. So it was natural
that the heathen philosophers of an-
cient Greece and Rome were studied
for the knowledge and instruction that
could not be found in the Bible.
The Eternal City.
Like so many artists and architects,
the author finds great pleasure in Rome
—the Eternal City. He describes
how in 1611 Pope Sixtus V had some
of the ancient Roman aqueducts re-
paired so that Rome once again had
pure water, which apart from its
hygienic importance supplied such an
abundance of sparkling spring water
that it could be used for fountains and
rippling cascades all over the sum
parched city.
Every square received its fountain,
■and through the centuries artists
created new variations of the same
theme; rippling, splashing water,
whether jetting forth from sculptured
groups set up amidst the columns of
the many decorative facades or from
single fountains, embellished with
tritons and river gods, standing in the
centres of squares. The sound of
hundreds of playing fountains became
the melody of Rome, faintly audible
behind the loud noise of the city by
day, clearly heard at night when the
great metropolis lay in hushed tram
quillity. To many, the sight and
sound of Rome’s fountains are still
among its greatest characteristics and
charm.
The author’s love of Rome is
summed-up in the final paragraph of
this chapter:—
“Such was the Rome of the Pope,
the nobility, and the people. The city
where both the great and lowly knew
how to live in harmony, where at car-
nival time there was neither rank nor
class, where great artists formed the
city and the inhabitants themselves
were artists enough to know how to
live in it.”
The Roman Villa.
The contribution of the great Roman
villas, like the Villa d’Este. etc., so
many of which still remain, has a
chapter devoted to it, and the author
describes how the loggia became of
first importance. This cool, colon-
naded gallery, which formed a lovely
link between the sun-dappled garden
and the rooms inside, was the very
feature that made the building a villa,
that is to say a dwelling attractively
combining indoors and out. From
the roadside you entered a cool,
grotto-like vestibule which led to the
large, airy, central chamber that again
opened on the loggia toward the gar-
den, where the axial lines of the build-
ing continued in an architectonic land-
scape of terraces with stairways, foun-
tains and cascades. You could sit in-
doors and hear coolness, itself, rip-
pling down among the evergreens.
The villas designed by Andrea
Palladro came to be regarded as
examples of an ideal architecture.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


For him purely utilitarian considera-
tions were of secondary importance,
and the main problem was to create
noble compositions of space and build-
ing masses, lavish in size but austere
in materials and decoration. The
large plane surfaces of wall, faced with
stucco, are broken only by the dark
window openings, and in their extreme
simplicity form an effective background
for the shadow effects produced by
the pillared porticoes and their finely-
executed details.
The Dutch House.
In the chapter entitled “The Dutch
Contribution,” typical houses in Delft
and Amsterdam are described. The
rooms are seldom symmetrically ar-
ranged as this is difficult to accomplish
in a narrow gabled house. Instead,
they open on each other in a quiet,
casual manner that is very affective,
giving the house a pleasing variety of
light and dark, large and small rooms.
There is usually a large room facing
the street, with immense windows,
and behind it there may be a small,
dimly lighted cabinet* with only win-
dow looking out on a deep, primitive
court. Behind this, again, a light and
airy room leads to a snug garden,
idyllically concealed behind the house.
It is like one of Peter de Hooch’s
pictures in which there is always a
little glimpse of a room behind the
one he has painted, an enticing glimpse
that awakens the joy of expectation.
Such expectations are awakened at
many places in Amsterdam. You look
down a long, straight canal street
ending in a cambered bridge which,
at the same time, frames the opening
to a new stretch of canal turning in
another direction and leading further
into this delightful city which is ever
the same and ever new.
Tale of Two Cities.
In the chapter headed “A Tale of
Two Cities the author shows that
he has a keen insight into both the
British and French character. To a
certain degree the special develop-
ment of English towns can be attrib-
uted to the fact that England’s best
defence has always been her island
location. Since 1066 the country
has never been invaded. Therefore it
has not been necessary to surround
the English towns with constricting
rings of fortifications, as was so often
the case on the Continent.
A city like Paris has expanded by
placing one ring beyond the other
moving the line of defence further out.
In the middle ages, in 1810, there
was a wall around the island in the
Seine the Isle de la Cite —and small
parts of the left and right banks.
New rings continued to be built to
cope with the expansion in the 18th
and 19th centuries with the result
the symbol of Paris became the narrow
multi-storeyed tenement described by
Dickens in his novel after which this
chapter is named, in comparison to
London where later the released Dr.
Manette is depicted sitting under a
plane tree in his garden in Soho, a
district of lovely squares, where many
emigrants found refuge. It is the
London of the open spaces, with its air
of humanity and with its green trees
and black houses.
He also compares the well-known
Place des Voses, formerly the Place
Royale, in Paris which was originally
the scene of knightly sports and tour-
naments, with Covent Garden in Lon-
don which had been built by the
fourth Earl of Bedford, and describes
how in Paris the Court took over
the square, whereas in London it be-
came a famous trading centre, which
gives a very good idea of the differ-
ence between the two cities’ peoples.
The Paris created by the famous
Haussmann under Napoleon 111. is
also the subject of a chapter, and it is
fascinating to see with what success
this despotic partnership operated and
how in a comparatively short period
converted mediaeval Paris into the
unique and magnificent city that it is
today. Mussolini tried the same tech-
nique in Rome with much less suc-
cess.
Mr. Rasmussen is a Dane and con-
sequently has a special interest in the
architectural and planning develop-
ment of his own country, thus the
chapter entitled “Danish Intermezzo”
contains a great deal of useful and
interesting information that is not
usually encountered in a work of this
type. He does not, however, allow
his native enthusiasm to distort his
mental perspective.
Land and Speculation.
In the penultimate chapter on “Land
and Speculation” the author comes to
grip with the practical problems of
modern town planning. He explains
that in the Middle Ages it was nat-
ural to take land for granted. It was
there, and there was more than enough
of it. Its value depended on whether
or not it was arable, and when it ceas-
ed to be cultivated it became worthless
again. Therefore, the ground on
which buildings stood had no value
in itself and, consequently, could not
be made an object of speculation.
The buildings, alone, could be bought
and sold.
Since early in the Middle Ages,
however, cities—which owed land as a
matter of course—had received rent
incomes from houses and land. At
first the tenant was given a one-year
lease with the implicit right to renew
it from year to year. Little by little
this developed in the towns, just as
in the country, into tenancy for life
or for a term of years, still at a yearly
rental. Something of the same sort
still exists today in England, where
land is let on long leases both in town
and country. The landlord is assured
a steady income and full dominion
over his property. The owner may be
a city, a university, a guild, a church,
an estate or some other perpetual in-
stitution not dependent on the life
and death of an individual.
In due course however the expansion
of the cities in the ninteenth century
gave all city landholders great advant-
ages and it quickly betame realised
that the value of a piec4 f of property
was proportionate to the number of
dwellings that could be squeezed on to
it.
Thus there was colossal strength in
land speculation. It could crowd
houses together beyond all reason and
force them high into the air, but
carried to extremes it brought the
seeds of its own destruction in the
frightful slums that resulted. In other
words the free play of economic forces
could not provide cheap land for low-
rent dwellings. Nor could building
legislation help the humbler members
of society. Landowners and their
backers formed an unofficial cartel
with a monopoly that had the poor in
search of homes completely in its
power. Their only chance was to be-
come landlords themselves. And
though they did not have much
money, they were in the majority. By
joining forces, by co-operation, they
could become an economic factor of
importance. This was realised in
England where* workers’ building so-
cieties were formed to buy land and
build houses for members. Later
workers in other countries followed
suit.
Functionalism.
In the final chapter on “Function-
alism” the author has a good deal to
say about the work and influence of
the French planner, author and archi-
tect Le Corbusier, while at the same
time he devotes considerable attention
to Ebenezer Howard and the develop-
ment of the English garden city and
satellite town, the whole idea of which
he says “is deeply rooted in English
mentality, in the English way of life
and in English political life.”
The second world war was to give
further impulse to the garden city idea
in Anglo-Saxon countries where it
became almost a gospel. The appall-
ing destruction of English cities con-
fronted their town planners with many
inordinate problems and here he says,
after reviewing British Town Planning
legislation up to the Town and Coun-
try Planning Act of 1947 with its
radical land utilization provisions, the
whole problem ends for the present.

NEW WOOLOOWARE HOUSING ESTATE
"FRUITS OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE" SAY SPEAKERS
HOUSING MINISTER ENDORSES EFFORTS.
The first unit of a new 53-home housing project at Woolooware was officially opened
recently by the Minister for Housing, Mr. Clive Evatt.
This project, in Woolooware Road North, is the second of its kind in the Sutherland
Shire. It is a monument to private enterprise, and it and its companion project
provides substantial evidence of the faith which the builders, Taylor Woodrow
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd., have in the future of Australia.
This Australian subsidiary of a fa'
mous U.K. construction firm with
world'wide ramifications is making a
meritorious effort to provide reason'
ably-priced, welhplanned homes for
the people, and the expressions of
praise voiced by speakers at the open'
ing ceremony is well earned.
Among the official guests were:
The N.S.W. Minister for Housing,
Mr. Clive Evatt, Messrs. I. O.
Cramer, M.H.R., E. G. Whitlam,
M.H.R., T. W. Dalton, M.L.A., the
President. M.B.A. of N.S.W., Mr. P.
Bottomley; President, Building In'
dustry Congress, Mr. S. D. C. Ken'
nedy, and the 8.1. C. Executive Di'
rector, Mr. D. Stewart Fraser.
Enterprise Praised.
Mr. T. W. Dalton, M.L.A., Mem'
ber for Sutherland, said he would
have a talk with the Minister re Hous'
ing Commission homes, and see if
they could be handed over to oc'
cupants complete with every detail,
down to lawns and gardens.
Mr. Dalton praised the enterprise
shown by Taylor Woodrow Pty. Ltd.,
and said their two home'building pro'
jects in Sutherland Shire were deserv'
ing of the highest praise.
Housing No. 1 Priority.
Supporting Mr. Dalton, Mr. E. G.
Whitlam, M.H.R., said the completed
housing projects in Sutherland Shire
resulted in 33 homes being built and
sold privately in Miranda.
The 53 homes under construction
at Woolooware would further swell the
population of the district, and would
bring the right type of people to the
area.
Mr. Whitlam said that Australian
housing must keep in step with pop'
ulation increases, and home construe'
tion must be a number one priority
for years to come.
The Taylor Woodrow organisation
was making a very praiseworthy con-
tribution to the housing problem, and
Australians warmly welcomed the ef'
forts the company was making along
these lines. (Applause.)
Minister Welcomed.
The Managing Director of Taylor
Woodrow (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., Mr.
John Hanson, in welcoming the
guests, said he was very pleased to see
Mr. Evatt present, as his anxiety to
provide homes for the people was
well known.
The Minister showed sufficient in'
terest in what was being done by Tay-
lor Woodrow that he had foregone
another very important engagement
to be present, Mr. Hanson continued.
In briefly reviewing the history of
the company since it came to Aus'
tralia, Mr. Hanson said that 12
months ago last lune the Chairman
of Taylor Woodrow Ltd. visited Aus'
tralia to see how things were going.
The company had just completed a
£75,000 Housing Commission contract
at Maroubra, nothing else seemed to
be offering, and it was on the cards
that everyone would pack up and re'
turn to Britain.
£375,000 Worth of Homes.
However, the Chairman was pre'
vailed upon to let the company “have
a go” at Australia, and in October,
1952, the first Tavlor Woodrow home
was opened at Miranda.
“ There are 33 there now, 31 oc'
cupied, and all sold,” Mr. Hanson
said.
“Today sees the beginning of our
biggest effort in Australia, an estate
of 53 homes.
“When completed Taylor Wood'
row will have built £375,000 worth
of houses in Australia (which includes
the Housing Commission Homes at
Maroubra), a fair effort for new'
comer to the Commonwealth,” Mr.
Hanson declared.
The company has also recently com'
pleted the longest underground oil
pipeline in Australia, betweeen New'
port and Geelong (Victoria) at a
cost of £600,000.
“We are making a very useful com
tribution to your virile Australia,
Mr. Hanson added.
Company’s Growth.
Continuing, he said the future was
a very difficult subject to talk about.
He had been 22 years with Taylor
Woodrow Ltd., which started with a
£2OOO paid'up capital, and today is
one of the “top flight” civil and em
gineering companies in the U.K. with
a capital of over £1,000,000 sterling,
and world'wide coverage.
Before the war the company was
building 1750 houses a year in Brit'
ain; it is still building 20 homes per
week, and carrying out many other
projects.
“Given the necessarv encourage'
ment and support we will make the
same attempt to achieve the same re'
cord as our parent organisation has es'
tablished in the U.K.”, Mr. Hanson
declared.
Confidence in Australia.
“It is a sign of our confidence in
Australia that we are prepared to em
ter on a project of this magnitude;
it is a fair criterion of our confidence
in Australia,” he added.
Mr. Hanson praised cooperation of
bankers, building societies, merchants,
and a “grand staff.”
“I hope that to'day’s function will
be a milestone, and will further cement

in solving the nation’s housing prob-
lem,” Mr. Hanson concluded.
Progress Lauded.
The State Housing Minister, Mr.
Clive Evatt, declared that he spoke
with complete sincerity when he said
it was indeed a lucky day for Aus-
tralia when Taylor Woodrow decided
to come here. (Applause.)
They had done a splendid job in
England. Since 1930 the firm had
built no less than 60,000 homes in
England.
Apart from carrying out great en-
gineering projects the company had
also gone to South Africa to build
homes, and did a “spectacular job”
there, Mr. Evatt said.
They were now established in
N.S.W. and Victoria, and are actively
engaged in filling a great social need,
the provision of homes.
National Crusade.
Continuing, Mr. Evatt said they
were showing great enterprise in
creating the two fine housing estates,
one of 3 3 homes, the other of 53
model dwellings.
“I regard housing as a great national
crusade that transcends all questions of
politics or indeed anything that might
divide us,” Mr. Evatt declared.
“It is a crusade which, when com-
pleted and its attendant problems solv-
ed will solve every other sociological
problem, such as child delinquency,
juvenile crime, and the manifold
problems of divided families.
“Wf can overcome these problems
if we all worK together and see that
every Australian family gets its birth-
right—a decent home in which to
live. (Applause.)
Private Enterprise Needed.
Continuing, Mr. Evatt said he did
not think there should be all Gov-
ernment housing. No such thought
had ever entered his head.
“We must give private enterprise
full play, and we must remember the
great co-operative movements’ con-
tribution to housing,” Mr. Evatt de-
clared.
“We may see the ultimate solution
of this tremendous social problem if
we work along these lines.
“I hope the community can work
together. Every class and creed and
church must unite to solve the prob-
lems involved in this campaign,” he
added.
Mr. Evatt said he desired to ex-
press a sense of gratitude to Taylor
Woodrow Pty. Ltd., and hoped it
would extend itself to other parts of
the State and Australia. It was doing
a good and splendid work, he added.
Record Housing.
In 1952 in N.S.W. private con-
tractors, building societies. War Ser-
vice Homes, the Housing Commission
and the Rural Bank completed 26,000
homes, an all-time record,” Mr. Evatt
said.
“This meant that every week last
year 500 homes were completed.
“That is still not enough, and we
must go on. We will go on.
“We have all got that ideal, but
have different solutions. We should
get together and find the best method
of making a real contribution to the
welfare, progress, and above all, the
happiness of our people,” Mr. Evatt
continued.
Must Fulfill Promises.
“Things which divide the commun-
ity from time to time will recede into
the background and become unimport-
ant when every Australian citizen can
say he has got a good home and his
family well housed.
“If people can live in decency and
pride they will feel that Australia has
fulfilled the promises made so often,
particularly in two world wars.
“It is a duty, a sacred obligation,
to see the pledges are fulfilled,” Mr.
Evatt declared.
“I stand before you with a com-
pletely non-political programme.
“If people can show me a better
way to build houses I wont be
trammelled by political thought of any
kind.
“In this we all work together,”
Mr. Evatt added.
Minister Thanked.
In moving a vote of thanks, the
8.1. C. Executive Director, Mr. D.
Stewart Fraser, said it had done his
heart good to hear the Minister cham-
pion free enterprise.
If there was one thing on which
the Minister and the speaker saw eye
to eye it was the need for all re-
sources of the State to be marshalled
to provide homes for the people.
It was not a political issue or an
economics issue but a grave social
problem.
The 8.1. C. had no political plat'
form and as the Executive Director
he had no political party.
Mr. Fraser praised Mr. Evatt for
honouring the function with his
presence and assuring the project of
his wholehearted support.
Minister’s Support Needed.
“We need the Minister’s earnest
support for solution of our building
problems. He could see that the pro'
ject was not mere fantasy, and that
Mr. Hanson did not indulge in wish'
ful thinking, but got things done,”
Mr. Fraser said.
“Taylor Woodrow is sufficiently fi'
nancial to put some of its own money
into the housing estates, and conse'
qucntly have to make a go of it.
“Building societies were proud to
have financed the homes in Miranda,
and Mr. Fraser asked Mr. Evatt to
ensure that such building projects were
approved from the outset so that in'
dividual purchasers could be certain
of finance through Co-operative So-
cieties.
Minister’s Crusade.
He congratulated Mr. Evatt on his
housing crusade, and his expressions of
belief in private enterprise. (Ap-
plause.)
After Mr. Evatt officilly opened
the model house, Mr. Hanson pre-
sented him with an inscribed silver
salver as a memento of the occasion.
Following the ceremony, refresh-
ments were served in an adjacent
marquee.

Students Make
Models
University School of Architecture.
That Professor H. Ingham Ashworth
realises the importance of models in
the study and development of archi'
tectural problems is emphasised by the
number that were featured in the re-
cent Exhibition of students’ work at
David Jones’ Market Street Store,
which was held from November 6th
to 13th. These models were the work
of teams of four or more students and
amplified drawings prepared for a num-
ber of projects, most of which had a
definite topical slant, which no doubt
appealed to the students more than
purely hypothetical essays in design.
One of particular interest was for the
design of a new Great Hall for the
University of Sydney, the assumption
being that, like Wilson Hall at Mel'
bourne University, it had been de-
stroyed by fire. It will be remember-
ed that considerable controversy raged
in Melbourne as to whether the re-
built Hall should follow the former
Gothic style or be in the Contem-
porary manner.
The final decision was for the new
hall to be designed and constructed in
accordance with modern practice and
outlook. The students in their prob-
lem took a similar view and schemes
ranged from parabolic, thin-shell
concrete arches, to extremely steeply-
pitched roofs stretching from the
ground upward.
The work generally was well pre-
sented and colourful.
CO-OPERATION-SECRET OF
PLANNING SUCCESS.
Sound Advice from Visiting
American Authority.
The recent visit to Melbourne of
the Los Angeles Town Planner, Mr.
Charles B. Bennett, has stimulated in'
terest in planning in Melbourne.
In a series of vigorous and stimu'
lating addresses he described the pro'
posed Melbourne Plan as a good one
and strongly advised that it be put
into action instead of being allowed
to “creep into a pigeon-hole.” It was,
he said, based on most careful research
into the habits of the people of Mel'
bourne.
The next step should be to create
a strong committee of all leading
citizens to discuss the plan and see
what could be done —a committee not
just of the big names, but of truly
representative people from all walks
of life.
Representative Committee
Vital.
Stressing how vital was such a com-
mittee, Mr. Bennett declared that for
decisions on planning to be left to
elected persons was a denial of de'
mocracy. “Democracy happens only
when every citizen has his say,” he
declared.
Stating that fear of pressure groups
and of stone'wall opposition from vest'
ed interests was worrying the planners,
Mr. Bennett revealed the secret of the
outstanding success of planning in his
country. “We’re long past that stage
in the States,’’ he said, “We have
found that partnership between elect'
ed and non'elected persons is the way
to get things done. Everyone sup'
ports the ideas of planning, because
people know from experience that it
not only makes life more comfortable
but puts money into everyone’s
pockets. The secret of it all is the
kind of committee cooperation I’ve
been talking about. Make all the
people partners. Don’t ever tell them
that this is the plan and that they’ve
got to like it or lump it. You’ll be
much better off after round'table con'
ferences.”
The Melbourne Plan is being pre'
pared by Melbourne’s Town Planner,
Mr. Borrie, and is to be presented
soon.
NEW MELBOURNE HOTEL
TO COST £350,000.
After standing at the corner of
Elizabeth Street and Flinders Street
for a hundred years, Hosie’s Hotel is
being demolished and will be replaced
by a modern building to cost approxi-
mately £350,000.
This is the second post-war major
city hotel rebuilding project of Carlton
and United Breweries Ltd., which pur'
chased the hotel in 1945. The other
is the Town Hall Hotel, in Swanston
Street, part of which was wrecked
some time ago by a mysterious ex'
plosion.
The new Hosie’s Hotel will be of
eleven storeys, with the bedroom ac-
commodation set back from the streets
to avoid noises, and overlooking a
guest’s roof garden on the fourth floor.
The architects are Mussen, Mackay
and Porter, of Melbourne, who expect
the project to be completed early in
1955.
STUDIES IN MOSAIC.
An interesting feature of the Exhibition
were several studies of design in mosaic
in which hundreds of tiny pieces of col-
oured cork of varied hues take the
place of the actual mosaic. The de-
signs were most effective as one of them
prepared to publicise the Exhibition il-
lustrates.

17,000 House Project in California
THE CONSTRUCTION OF LAKEWOOD PARK.
POPULATION OF 70,000.
The property being used for the
vast ‘Lakewood Park’ community de'
velopment, Los Angeles County, Cali'
fornia, U.S.A., comprises some 3500
acres, or roughly 10 square miles of
what was one of the last remaining
ranch holdings of the Montana Land
Company. The land was purchased
recently in a cash transaction amount'
ing to nearly 9,000,000 dollars by the
Corporation of Lakewood Park, a joint
venture firm composed of two long'
established building contractors, Aetna
Construction Inc. and Biltmore Homes
Inc.
Lakewood Park is one of the largest
planned housing developments in his'
tory. It will be a community of
17,150 homes with a population of
somewhere between 60,000 and 70,000
people. It will be virtually a ‘city in
itself with new parks, playgrounds,
schools, churches and a major shop'
ping centre. This shopping centre
will occupy an area of more than 153
acres with everything from super mar'
kets to department stores. Plans are
included for tunnels for underground
deliveries to stores in order that heavy
traffic may be kept off the shopping
streets. There will be sq. ft. of
off'Street free parking space for every
square foot of selling space.
Located in the unincorporated area
of Los Angeles County, the land is
divided into 40 building tracts. Usual
size of a tract is 157 acres, but small
tracts near the Lakewood golf course,
owned by the builders and partially
enclosed by the sprawling boundaries
of Lakewood Park, have as few as 20
acres. Each tract will have between
230 and 640 homes. The variation
is due to the fact that certa'in areas of
some tracts will be devoted to coni'
mercial districts, a church, playground,
etc.
Most of the carpentry, common
labour and clerical supply staff is pro'
vided by Lakewood Park builders. All
other operations are leased out to a
wide variety of sub-contractors.
Long before construction started,
while Southwest Drafting Service was
planning the design and location of
every unit, Lakewood construction
men were arranging tight time charts
of the order of construction and sup'
ply of material.
Melbourne’s Western Markets to be Started
COST INCREASES FROM £1,900,000 TO £6,000.000.
When in 1948 conditions for a com'
petition for designs for a building to
cover the whole of the Western Mar'
ket site in Melbourne were issued, it
was stipulated that the cost should not
exceed £1,900,000. It is now re-
vealed that owing to the great in-
crease in costs during the intervening
five years a building in accord with
the winning design would now cost
about £6,000,000.
The winners of the competition
were the Melbourne architects, Messrs.
L. M. Perrott, Noel B. O’Connor and
Clive Osborne.
The City Council has decided to
proceed with the first of the five units
in the design submitted by the win'
ners of the competition. It will con-
tain twelve floors and two basements,
and there will be about 150,000 square
feet of office space and parking pro'
vision for about 300 cars.
The winning design contemplated
the Collins Street frontage being set
back a distance of 15 feet from the
corners of William Street and Market
Street, but the project as recommend'
ed to the City Council by its special
town planning committee provided
that the structure cover the whole
frontage at an additional expenditure
of about £lOO,OOO.
When the job does start it will in-
volve one of the biggest excavation
undertakings in Melbourne construe'
tion history, for in this quarter of the
city, which is adjacent to the Yarra,
builders must go very deep for suit'
able foundations.

City of Sydney Planning Scheme
Report by the n.s.w. chapter of the royal Australian
INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS.
The Council of the N.S.W. Chap-
ter of the Royal Australian Institute
of Architects has considered the City
of Sydney Town Planning Scheme (as
illustrated by the coloured city map
and described in explanatory brochure
issued by the City Council and dated
July 7th, 1953).
Whilst the Institute considers the
general outline of the plan is to be
commended, it feels that consideration
of such a plan as part of a Regional
Scheme is essential to obtain a proper
appreciation of its real worth.
It is considered that the time is
overdue for the preparation of such a
Regional Plan covering the whole
State of New South Wales and that
matters such as decentralisation, com-
munications and land usage should be
considered on a State basis. It should
be noted that the County of Cumber-
land and similar schemes elsewhere
deal with only a small portion of the
area of the State.
The following comments on the
scheme are submitted for considera-
tion by the Council of the City of
Sydney.
1. Generally.
The City Plan can only be regarded
as the first phase, for the city must
develop over the years to come and
require replanning to meet changing
conditions. The first phase plan,
therefore, must be flexible to meet the
future development.
2. Land Use.
The present business and commer'
cial areas of the city are unduly re'
stricted and in the opinion of the
Institut efull provision should be made
for expansion to the east of King’s
Cross and Taylor’s Square and to the
west to Darling Harbour. The area
included by both sides of William
Street, Darlinghurst Road and Oxford
Street, City, should be zoned as busi-
ness and commercial areas.
In other small areas the existing
land uses and present building develop'
ment lead the Institute to the con'
elusion that the zoning proposed in
the Scheme is quite unreal and will
not achieve anything worthwhile. In
fact, it will very likely prove to be
detrimental to proper city develop'
ment.
The Institute is also strongly of the
opinion that it is not desirable for the
old wharves on the east shore of
Darling Harbour to be rebuilt on this
section of the foreshore. It is prefer-
able that new wharves be constructed
round Blackwattle Bay, at Balmain,
and westward of the Central City area.
This would be a first step in the de-
centralising of wharf facilities, to re-
duce traffic congestion in the western
part of the city, and give better facili-
ties for the movement of wharf traffic.
Those portions of Pyrmont and Mil'
ler’s Point zoned on the plan as resi'
dential area should be re-zoned as
business and commercial areas,
3. Port Facilities.
It must be obvious that the present
congested conditions so often seen in
Port Jackson cannot continue as the
city expands in population. The posh
tion is so serious that the Institute
feels investigations should be made
into the possibility of developing
Botany Bay as the future freight'
handling port for a large part of New
South Wales.
It would seem essential to divert
from the immediate city area and Port
Jackson generally heavy freight that
could be handled more expeditiously
by facilities constructed in the flat
areas surrounding Botany Bay.
4. Density.
The Institute agrees with the gene'
ral principle of restriction of density
and recommends that such restriction
should be extended to all areas zoned
for business and commercial use.
Also, the Institute is of the opinion
that an investigation is warranted and
should be made with a view to im'
proving the regulations governing resi'
dential flat buildings by applying the
principle of floor space index suitably
adapted for the purpose.
5. Floor Space Index.
The Institute recognises that some
control of building bulk is necessary
in the area covered by the City Plan.
While the floor space index proposed
is an accepted means of achieving this
objective, the Institute considers that
compensation must be payable, such
compensation to be related to the un-
improved capital value of the land
over a reasonable period of time dur'
ing which values could be stabilised.
Some of the floor space indices
might be reconsidered, as on some
blocks in the city area the index ap'
pears to be far too low.
The index should be related to such
matters as street width, whether street
has buildings on one or two sides, and
the use for which the building is de'
signed.
Wide streets, such as Elizabeth and
Macquarie Streets and Martin Place,
provide greater traffic room than some
of the narrow streets, such as King,
Market and Pitt, and floor space in'
dex should be adjusted to suit street
capacities. Macquarie Street and
Elizabeth Street in part have park'
lands on one side. High buildings
could well be allowed facing the park'
land, as local traffic is reduced by
•about half due to this fact. The out'
look such a building would have over
the outer domain or Hyde Park, as
well as the ample daylight available
due to its position, should be taken
into consideration in assessing a higher
index in these locations.
NEW BRITISH TECHNICAL COLLEGE.
With a new University of Technology building in Sydney it is interesting to see this
extension to the Willesden Technical College, London, that has recently been com-
pleted. There is an unaffected modernity about the design that is particularly
satisfying.
—"The Architectural Review," London.

November 24, 1953.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Use is another matter which should
be recognised in the indices for floor
space. As an example, large depart-
mental stores or theatres create a
greater concentration of traffic, espe-
cially foot traffic in the immediate
vicinity compared with an office build-
ing.
Car-parking space and/or garages in
buildings should not be included in
calculations under floor space index.
Lift machinery houses, caretaker’s
quarters, etc., at roof level; mechani-
cal equipment and other service rooms
in the basement should also be ex-
cluded.
If the proposal to extend the busi-
ness and commercial areas eastwards
and westwards is adopted, the pro-
posed densities for individual blocks
in the city area likely to be lowered
by natural spread of the city.
6. Road Pattern.
The Institute considers that the
roda system proposed and particularly
the inner City ring road will be of
great value and convenience, and the
Institute urges that immediate active
steps be taken to implement this part
of the new road pattern.
The Institute is of the opinion that
the southern portion of the inner city
ring road in the Goulburn Street
locality should be constructed as a
high or low level expressway.
A study of the existing road pat-
tern in certain areas of the outer city
shows an uneconomic proportion being
devoted to road purposes. The pro-
portion in certain cases is so great as
to warrant consideration of a more
economic arrangement, especially
where the existing development is
very old and rebuilding can be ex-
pected in the not-too-distant future.
7. Civic Centre.
The proposal for a Civic Centre is
supported, but it is felt that the sug-
gested arrangement is too scattered
and would not provide a Civic Centre
in the true sense. Without a civic
square the proposal would be little
more than a sound scheme of re-
grouping important buildings round
parklands. This in itself is commend-
able, but the Institute is of the opinion
that a large open paved area in the
Form of a piazza should be developed.
Labour Shortage
Slows Queensland
Works
Bricks, Cement, Hard to Get.
An acute shortage of skilled build-
ing tradesmen is reported to be de-
laying imoprtant Queensland Govern-
ment projects.
The shortage, particularly of plumb-
ers and plasterers, has caused the Pub-
lic Works Minister, Mr. Hilton, great
concern.
Shortage of licensed plumbers is
delaving installation of septic systems
at schools and other public buildings,
while shortage of plasterers had disor-
ganised work of other sections of the
building trade. It has prevented
works, including some in the north,
from being done economically.
Shortages of bricks and cement was
ako causing concern and the Public
Works Department had experienced
difficulty and delay in obtaining sup-
plies.
Although there were prospects of
adequate supplies of cement being
available soon, there was no evidence
of any improvement in brick supplies
Mr. Hilton added.
MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
Mr. S. HOST,
FRANK G. O BRIEN PTY. LTD.
Well-known representative of Frank
G. O'Brien in the IIIawarra District, Mr.
Syd. Host is regarded as an authority
on glass and its manifold uses in the
construction and allied fields.
He is particularly popular among
builders, for his extensive knowledge
of the glass industry has helped solve
many problems.
He specialises in glass, joinery, box
frames and sashes, all products of his
progressive organisation.

A CORRUGATED PLYWOOD HOUSE
By ROBERT F. MACDONALD.*
When a commodity becomes too
costly for the people responsible for
the demand, then, sooner or later, the
reasons for the high cost will be cor'
rected by some revolutionary method
of production, for supply and demand
are constantly striving to maintain a
balance and will ultimately succeed.
The upward trend in the cost of
living has spiralled wages, the main
cost of building, to high levels, and
the resulting increases are being passed
on to the home'builder.
Therefore, to build at lower cost,
there are two alternatives: either to
await the slow and by no means sure
removal of the causes of high costs,
or to find other methods of building
u’hich will sidestep some of the causes.
In searching for a way round the
cost of timber houses, it would seem
desirable to consider the component
part house, with standardised units,
answering all structural and weather'
resisting purposes and capable of being
bolted or screwed together by unskilled
persons.
This would dispense with “on site”
labour costs for a large proportion of
the work and ensure speedy comple'
tion of the shell of the structure.
Corrugated Plywood Sheets.
An interesting material, which might
fill this purpose, is corrugated plywood
sheet, the layers of which are bonded

These sheets are manufactured in

as yet, in Australia.

Used as a load'bearing wall panel,

This is a much greater load than is

The Component Part House.
The cost of such a house, built bv
contract, would be much the same as
one of traditional construction, but
the significant advantage of the com'
nonent part house lies in the saving ot
the capital outlay in “on site” labour
and the shortening of the time of
erection.
In order to obtain a sufficiently wide
market for houses constructed of ply'
wood, the majority of the municipal
councils would have to be persuaded
to approve the method. Banks, hous'
ing societies and other financial bodies
are also prone to consider the matter
If desired, such walls could be lined
internally with any sheet material, and
external walls would not require
weatherboards or other cover when
from the investment angle, which pre'
eludes risking any advances on build'
ing with which there has been no
previous experience.
And, finally, there is the barrier
erected by those who would have most
to gain—the public, who are notorious'
ly resistant to anything strange or dif'
ferent from what the neighbours have.
Is it expecting too much that there
are sufficient people in Victoria who,
by cooperation, could overcome the
manufacturing problem, that there are
a few municipal engineers to approve
a new method and provide an example
for other councils to follow, or that
Ordinary flat sheet plywood has
long been in use as a lining material
and has a much greater strength than
straight - grained timber of similar
dimensions. It cannot be used struc'
turally without the assistance of fraim

enormously increased strength, both as
a supporting slab and a load'bearing
wall panel.
A fin. thick plywood sheet, cor'
rugated to a 6in. pitch, 2in. deep, will
support normal domestic floor loads
over a 6ft. span, thus saving the use
of conventional joist framing. Since

tween the corrugated sheets and lining
for heating and cooling, or for packing

there are one or two men ot vision to
authorise the advance of capital to
those requiring it for this new type
of construction?
In these notes you have been offer-
ed some reasons for high costs, the un-
likelihood of immediate relief, and a
new method of construction with the
obstacles outlined.
The obstacles are merely a challenge
to people of determination and can be
overcome.
If, as a result of these suggestions,
a way is cleared for the initiation of
some co-operative move to help pros-
pective home-builders, then a useful
purpose will have been served they
will be freed from frustration and per-
haps those who may be interested will
have created a means of helping to
ease one of the most urgent of the
country’s difficulties • - the housing
shortage.
Who Are The
Capitalists?
With Compulsory Unionism for
everybody in the offing, inspired by
the Left of the Socialist movement,
a lot of arrant nonsense is being talk-
ed about capitalists. Most thrifty
unionists do not realise that they, too,
are capitalists.
Now, capital is best defined as that
part of wealth which is saved in order
to assist future production. A man —
any man—creates capital as soon as
he produces more than he consumes.
And a man with capital is a capitalist.
Suppose a man is earning £l5 a
week, and he spends on his home and
selves £l2 a week. He has left £3 a
week to put in a bank, or a savings
bank. At the end of the year he has
£156 saved. Now that is capital: he
is, in fact, a capitalist. Because he
has produced more than he has con-
sumed; and the Bank is lending his
money, at interest, to assist firms in
future production.
If he multiplies himself by several
million other “savers” and their £156
or so a year, he will realise how cap-
ital finds the money for firms to buy
machinery or the material to manu-
facture goods—before they receive
the payment for the goods. Unionists
are getting itchy fingers again. Thev
think banks should be nationalised. If
Labour get in and had power to do
that, it would not take them a minute
to decide to confiscate the lot. It
was done in Russia under communist
control when owners lost everything
they c\er had including property and
cattle. “Will you give everything
you possess to the state?” they were
asked individually. “Yes,” was the
reply. “Sign here,” they were told,
and that was that.
Where they said “No” —“Take
him away,” was the instruction —and
he was “liquidated”—or never heard
of again. It is all so easy and fright-
ening when dealing with the unscrup-
ulous.
For about two years 15,000,000
Russian people paid the price of be-
ing liquidated by their own govern-
ment, or they died of starvation.
U.M.I Sales
Convention
Products Presented to Builders
and Trade.
The Sales Convention of United
Metal Industries Ltd., Brisbane, was
held last Thursday evening in the St.
George Club, Hurstville.
Present were a number of local
Master Builders, retailers, and hard-
ware merchants, and electrical engin-
eers.
The object of the Convention was
to present the U.M.I. products: elec-
tric ranges, hot-water systems, bath
heaters, wash boilers, stainless steel
sinks, etc., and point out their ad-
vantages and refinements in compari-
son to those of competitive products.
Following a welcome by Mr. John
Deck, of John Deck and Co., Erskine
Street, Mr. Neil Simpson, U.M.I.
sales manager, traced the history of
the organisation from its inception.
He said the company was formed
30 years ago as the result of a merger
of three separate factories: Hockleys,
of Maryborough, Enterprise Sheet
Metal Works, and |. R. Ruthven,
stove manufacturers.
In the last year employees increased
by 108%, the area of the buildings
by 138%, and the value of sales by
548%. on the basis of the then exist-
ing market as far south as the Graf-
ton River.
Mr. Simpson added that each Aus-
tralian home annually purchases some-
think like £35 of electrical equip-
ment; an average of £8 per person
per year.
Mr. A. Wilshire, Technical Officer
of U.M.1., then explained the merits
of the products point by point.
The evening concluded with re-
freshments being served.
In Seattle, Washington, a new
lightplane—the Cessna —powered by
a Boeing turbo-jet engine has reached
an altitude of 37,063 feet, the highest
yet for a lightplane. The engine will
operate with diesel or high octane
fuel.
£35,000 " Cottage"
The latest Queensland home to
make headline news is that of Mel-
bourne millionaire Arthur Flinkier,
who is building a £35,000 “cottage”
near Surfers’ Paradise.
To ensure an unobstructed view of
the blue Pacific he has paid about
£BOOO for eight building allotments.
The “cottage” will have 10 rooms
in the upper storey and there will be
a five-roomed flat for a c taff in per-
manent residence.
Forty-five-year-old motor magnate
Flinkier and his wife and family will
spend the winters there.
MODERN CHURCH DESIGN.
In a recent issue of "The Anglican"
Norman McPherson, well-known eccles-
iastical architect, wrote on Modern
Church Design and illustrated his views
with the accompanying sketches. The
upper shows a modern church design
with the interior below. In essence the
design suggests the perpendicular style
chapels with solid walls instead of great
areas of lace-like stained glass and stone
tracery.

“The Frank Green
Library”
The City of Sydney Public Library,
Paddington Branch.
Efficient Planning and Pleasing
Colour.
On December 19th last, The Rt.
Hon. The Lord Mayor, Alderman P.
D. Hills, in the presence of Messrs.
E. J. Ward, M.P.. M. O’Sullivan,
M.L.A., The Deputy Lord . Mayor,
Alderman Frank Green, and a gather'
ing of citizens representative of all
sections of the community, officially
opened the Paddington Branch of the
City of Sydney Public Library.
By resolution of Council, dated July
7th, 1952, approval was given to the
naming of the Paddington Branch as
“The Frank Green Library” in honour
of Alderman Frank Green and in re*
cognition of his outstanding municipal
service in the Paddington district and
the City of Sydney.
The establishment of this library
represents the completion of a section
of an overall plan of public improve'
ment and extension adopted by the
Council of the City of Sydney early
in 1949*
On March 19th, 1951, Council ac'
cepted the tender of Messrs. J. G.
Taylor Pty. Ltd. for the conversion
of portion of the Lower Hall of the
former Paddington Town Hall for use
as a Branch Library, and by mid'April
building operations were under way;
at the beginning of September, 1952,
the Library entered into occupation of
the new building.
The total cost of establishing the
Library, not including staff wages and
salaries, worked out at approximately
£25,000, made up of £5900 for the
initial stock of books and periodicals,
£lBOO for steel shelving and other
furniture and equipment (supplied for
the most part by Steelbilt Ltd.), and
£17,300 for the building.
The plans and specifications for the
building were drawn up by the ArchP
tectural Branch of the City Building
Surveyor’s Department, and construe'
tion was supervised by officers of this
department.
The basic problem was to build a
library within a space of 40ft. x 94ft.
x 16ft., and every facility required
by a branch library is incorporated in
this building; the architect has made a
most economic use of the large amount
of space available. He has refrained
from encroaching on the area devoted
to public use by installing staff quarters
and workrooms in a mezzanine floor
above the entrance to the Library. He
has also used colour to great advam
tage in the interior decoration of the
building.
There were several problems con'

“PASSIM SPARGERE LUCEM”
(TO SPREAD LIGHT EVERYWHERE)
By W. R. STEVENS, B.Cc., F.I.E.S.
(Summary of Presidential Address delivered at The Illuminating Engineering
Society at the Royal Institution, London, on October 13, 1953.)
At the opening meeting of the new
session of The Illuminating Engineer'
ing Society held at the Royal InstitU'
tion on October 13th. Mr. W. R.
Stevens was inducted as President.
For the title of his presidential address
Mr. Stevens used the newly-adopted
motto of the Society, ‘Passim Spargere
Lucem,’ meaning ‘To spread light
everywhere.’
There are three main springs, he
said, from which new ideas on light'
ing may arise: (i) the study of light
sources and the production of new
ones; (ii) the study of seeing and the
properties of the eye; and (hi) the
study of lighting installation design.
The Study of Light
Sources.
In the past interest in artificial light'
ing has usually followed the introduc'
tion by physicists and chemists of new
light sources, and in recent years at
least application engineers have never
fully worked out one source before
mother has appeared. Now we have
the tubular fluorescent lamp, the full
possibilities of which have not yet been
»xploited, perhaps not even realised.
We may ask what further revolutions
in lamp design are likely. The answer
is less hopeful than it was twenty
pears ago; we now think we can see
ihead more clearly and the views are
ess spectacular. Electroluminescence
nay be the answer, but it is doubtful.
New sources will no doubt be evolved,
though less frequently than in the
past, and in the meantime we shall
benefit from detailed improvements on
existing sources.
Research On Seeing.
In many ways the most fascinating
research in lighting is that which aims
at understanding the behaviour of the
visual mechanism. The work follows
two parallel channels: one concerns
the pathology of the eye, the other is
directed to measuring visual per'
formance. The lighting engineer is
more interested in the second, since
the results may help him to design
better lighting installations. We
should not hope for too much from
such work, as it seems unlikely that
there are as yet undiscovered any
unusually ingenious ways of exploiting
the sense of sight for ordinary jobs;
for the lighting of shops, factories and
offices the chief value of the work of
Weston or Harrison and Meaker is to
remove the ‘hit'Or'iniss’ approach to
design rather than to discover new
methods of lighting.
Great care must be taken in inter'
preting the results of experiments
which attempt to assess the reactions
of human beings. The results are
only valid for the particular conditions
of the experiment from which they
were obtained. Almost invariably in
research on seeing these conditions
are so restricted that one is tempted
to extend the range of validity of the
results. For example, Lythgoe’s work
on visual acuity has unfortunately been
treated in this way to support the
twin fetishes of uniform illumination
and uniform brightness. Another
temptation to be avoided is that of
interpreting experimental results to
satisfy preconceived notions.
Research on seeing is therefore un-
likely to shatter our present notions
about lighting or lead to radically new
methods; it can, however, put our
ideas straight, make practice definite
instead of vague, and so enable the
average lighting engineer to do better
work. Its value, therefore, is great.
The Study of Installation
Design.
Lighting practice at the present time
is sti u i arge l y a matter of ‘cut-and-
try’ We kave a f e w useful rules
w hich guide us in designing and in-
stallation and a few rules which seem
to kave no foundation in experiment
or CO mmonsense. For the most part
we m ust design by experience; some-
times, however, experience degene-
rates into routine, and this must be
avo ided.
.... ,
Greater use of imagination is need-
ed in everyday jobs; some of the more
unorthodox suggestions which have
been made from time to time might
tried out for example artificial
lighting, which varies m colour and
intensity with the changing seasons or
weather, windows intended to provide
a view rather than to light the in-
tenor. Do we pay sufficient attention
to reducing the cost of maintaining in-
stallations? Are we giving sufficient
attention to the decorative element in
lighting?
Many tend to regard fashionable
changes with some contempt. Fashion,
however, provides variety. Innate in
all of us is the need for change and
contrast in our daily lives. Inevit-

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
By F. O. NIXON.
The average number of building
permits issued by the Brisbane City
Council each month for some time in
the post-war period—7oo to 800 —is
being maintained; those for Septem-
ber numbering 777.
With the approach of the mid-
summer holidays, when the building
trades take extended holidays—more
particularly in these affluent days—
building permits will probably fall off
a lot.
Of the 777 permits, the major num-
ber, as usual, are for small dwellings
costing from £2OOO to £3OOO, an ex-
penditure that would have ranked as
luxurious a very few years ago.
The permits in September related
to 27 dwellings costing from £3OOO to
£4000; 11 listed at £4OOO to £6OOO,
■and one at £6875. There were four
others (with shops combined) costing
from £3OOO to £4OOO, and a similar
number at £4OOO to £7OOO. Six fac-
tory buildings range from £3OOO to
£12,000, four buildings of flats £3OOO
to £5OOO each, four new stores and
extensive additions to another cost
£5OOO to £ll,OOO. A new clubhouse
will cost £5OOO, and five new petrol
service stations cost between £3500
and £5685, and an oil storage tank
will cost £57,350. Two new church
buildings will cost, respectively,
£15,000 and £34,000. New office
buildings, to cost £B5OO and £26,888,
include in the last mentioned an office
for the Waterside Workers’ Union,
and though in these times of inflated
building costs it can hardly be expect-
ed that the latter will be palatial, it
can at least be expected to be a strik-
ing office.
An appeal is out for donations to
reach six figures to enable St. John’s
magnificent Cathedral to complete its
missing wing. Of the £500,000 re-
quired, the sum of £lOO,OOO is in hand.
Employers in the building industry
have been asked to increase the wages
of tradesmen by £2/10/0 per week
and those of builders’ labourers by
38/- per week. A quick calculation
shows that the demand, if granted,
would add well over £2,000,000 to the
already overburdened cost of building.
There are great expectations of city
building extensions in the new year,
involving realignments at North Quay.
Nearby the proposed new structure
for the life insurance company—the
Prudential Assurance Company —at
the corner of Queen Street and North
Quay, it is intended to build a theatre
such as the well-established and grow-
ing Bris ba n e Repertory Theatre,
Twelfth Night Theatre and several
other “Little” Theatre movements that
have earned a high place for Brisbane
in the culture of drama need. Though
the seating accommodation will con-
form to the limited 800 favoured by
the “intimate” theatre, it is proposed
to equip the building with a modern
and attractive frontage, dressing rooms,
stage, etc., that do not belong to the
age when any kind of a warren was
regarded as adequate fot actors and
actresses in which to change.
Spread over a period of three and
a-half years, it is intended, according
to the Acting Health Minister, Mr.
Townley, to spend £3,000,000 to pro-
vide adequate hospitalisation for tuber-
culosis sufferers in the State. Some
of the construction work is now under
way.
The site of the Elizabeth Kenny
Clinic is to be used by Gordon c/
Gotch (Aust.) Ltd. for the erection
of a six-storeyed new building, esti-
mated to take eighteen months to

faces the State Government’s execu-
tive building in a less hectic traffic and
business centre.
The success which has come to the
Chermside Garden Settlement for aged
people is such that plans are complete
for another £33,000 building which
will help to provide for some of the
300 on the waiting list. The garden
settlement provides cottages for aged
couples who are able to look after
themselves, while the “Cooper" Build-
ing provides complete “flats’’ for the
frail couples upon whom a watchful
eye can be kept when it is necessary.
The expenditure upon the new build-
ing of the same nature, though it will
tiave 28 single rooms, is being pro-
vided for by donations, one of which,
:o the extent of £14,500, has already
seen received from the late Mr. G.
L. Uhl’s estate.
Although this settlement for frail,
genteel folk was initiated by the
Methodist Church, it is quite non-
sectarian. The scheme seems to pro-
vide for a solution or at least an
imelioration of the difficult position of
dderly people without the care of
jrown-up sons and daughters who live
dsewhere, or else ?
It is indicative of the extent of the
growth of population mostly of
lative born, in this instance that
he governmental expenditure upon all
state educational establishments
vhich includes State schools, high
chools and technical colleges—during
he year ended 30th June, 1953, was
E 936,614 (or £205,492 less than in
he previous year). The expenditure
jpon primary schools in the same
seriod was £631,083 (as compared
/ith £841,540 in the previous year).
The reduction in the Federal Loan
Council’s allocation of loan moneys is
nfortunate, but particularly so when
o important a need as education suf-
ers. Had it not been that the school
ntrance age had been raised by one
ear the probability is that the need
sr more school space would have
een more embarrassing as it is re-
orted to be.

lumping Company Pty. Ltd., which
jases an eighty years’ old wharf in
ie heart of the city at Petries Bight,

uilding a wharf that has seen its best
ays and is becoming unsafe. The
Brisbane City Council is considering
lis offer, subject to the granting of
new lease for 25 years and the can-
dling of the existing lease.
Queensland’s very eminent engineer,
ir John Kemp, whose extended term
f office is intended to definitely ex-
ire at the end of 1953, has recoin-
lended in his last annual report the
spending of £54,000,000 on Govern-
ment and semi - Government works
which had reached the plan stage of
:he Co-Ordinator General’s Depart-
ment. Many of the activities are at
various progressive stages throughout
the State, in which water conservation
figures largely.
It was said in Parliament recently
that the title conferred upon Sir John
Kemp was not in keeping with his
great contribution to the progress of
the State when the reasons for the
recommendation of titles in some other
cases were considered.
If there were ever a time in the
economic life of this State when a
vital part of it has above it the tradi-
tional Sword of Damocles suspended
by the proverbial hair of one strand,
the allegory can be applied to the coal-
mining industry, with the sword stand-
ing for atomic power.
If and when the blow does come,
the great loss in the abandonment of
coalfields and coal mines will be borne
to a great extent by the people of the
State, rather than by individuals.
The world has seen so many of
these revolutions affecting industry
during the past half-century the
Diesel engine, radio, pneumatic tyres,
motor transport, airplanes, to mention
some main ones —that the problem is
not any more insoluble, if provision
to produce more food can be made
out of the displaced labour of the coal
industry.
With promises of atomic power
within a very few years, it will be in-
teresting to note the most recent de-
velopments in coal-mining in Queens-
land. As is well known, a great area
of the State is teeming with coal be-
neath the ground and near the sur-
face, allowing for great open-cut opera-
tions. Coal seams being worked at
Ipswich, twenty-five miles west ot
Brisbane, continue to the edge of
Moreton Bay, and in places necessitate
deeper foundations in South Brisbane
buildings.
In order to cater for Victoria’s
needs, much money has been spent on
opening up the Callide coalfield (open-
cut), seventy-five miles west of the
fine, natural port of Gladstone, 320
miles north of Brisbane. It has re-
quired the expenditure of £900,000 to
bring this road to a suitable condition
to enable the fleet of heavy motors
to use it. Previous to that road con-
dition being reached, the Government
decided to build about nine miles of
railway to connect Callide with the
existing Central Queensland Railway,
which makes the railway haulage to
Gladstone, 176 miles, for a rate of
<£l/19/8 per ton, as against a road
haulage rate of £l/17/0, after allow-
ing for a road tax increased to 7/-
per ton. The hauliers have indicated
that they can compete by cutting their
rates.
The introduction of atomic power
can at some future time throw into
the discard a road that cost £900,000
and less than nine miles of railway
that cost £434,000 in the immediate
past.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
Big changes are due in the city’s
skyline within the next few years, with
big office buildings planned to take
the place of some of the smaller build-
ings where plans for new structures
were delayed by the war and build-
ing restrictions.
Two insurance companies have iust
announced plans for 11-storey office
blocks to be undertaken soon. The
Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assurance
Co. will build one block at the corner
of Victoria Square and Franklin St.,
at an estimated cost of £1,500,000.
The company plans to begin demoli-
tion of the old Morialta Chambers
and the adjacent Windsor Castle Ho-
tel on the site about the middle of
next year, and to have the building
completed by the end of 1955.
The 11-storey building planned by
the City Mutual Life Assurance Co.,
at the corner of King William and
Pirie Streets, will cost about £400,000.
The society bought the present two-
storey building and site in lanuary,
1952, for £lOO,OOO.
Tenders are expected to be called
early next year for the 10-storey build-
ing for the Savings Bank of S.A. on
the corner of Bank and Hindley Sts.
Demolition of the old Flint Hardware
building on the site by W. G. Hinton
is expected to be finished before the
end of the year. The top storey of
three has already been removed.
New hotel licenses granted last
month by the Midland Licensing
Court will bring two big construction
jobs soon. A new Western Districts
Community Hotel costing about
£BO,OOO is to be built on the Esplan-
ade at Semaphore, on the latest
American and Continental lines. The
Hotel Seaton, planned on a site on
Tapleys Hill road near the Seaton
Park railway station and the Royal
Adelaide Golf Club, will cost about
£45,000. It will be a two-storey
brick structure, with 12 bedrooms,
and work is expected to begin within
a few months.
A contract for about £20,000 for
the new six-bedroom Roseworthy Ho-
tel has been let to I. lenkins 6? Son.
A shower for each room, saloon, pub-
lic bars and dining room are provided
in the single-storey building, for which
Walkely and Welbourne are the archi-
tects.
Something new in Australian
church architecture will be seen in
the John Flynn Memorial Church, to
be built at Alice Springs. Designed
by A. A. Philpot, the church will be
without stained glass or tower. In-
stead plate-glass will be used in the
centre section and side walls, and en-
trance will be through a glass-enclos-
ed porch. This will span a pool in
which will grow water lilies gathered
from Australian Inland Mission sta-
tions. The church interior will be
dominated by two great red sandstone
shields, each weighing about 50 tons.
One will bear a cross and the other
an architectural sculpture symbolising
the work of “Flynn of the Inland.”
The sandstone will come from hills
about five miles south of Alice
Springs, and marble for facing the
precast blocks for the outer walls from
the Pinnacles, 70 miles north of the
town. Tenders for materials will be
called this month, and for the build-
ing work separately before the end
of the year.
A large State Government contract
let during the month went to Martin
Building Contractors Ltd., for a new
block for the Northfield Mental Hos-
pital, to accommodate 40 female T.B.
patients. The work will cost about
£75,000, and will take about a year to
complete. R. J. Nurse secured the

BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


An unusual feature of design is in-
cluded in a bank building, to be built
for the Savings Bank of S.A. on a
corner site at Beulah Park. On each
side wall of the strict, clean structure,
running back from the angled door-
way, splayed mullions between the five
windows will be faced with different
materials on each side, alternating
:ream brick and ceramic tile. A
E 5700 contract for the work has been
let to McEntee and Williams by
STcMichael and Harris.
Other bank building contracts are
>eing called. Evans and Bruer are
:he architects for banking chambers
or the Savings Bank of S.A. at
Failem Bend. The building, single-
itorey, with 15ft. banking chamber,
md terracotta and architectural faience
ront, will cost about £6OOO. Milne,
Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis are calling
enders for alterations to shop pre-
nises for the A.N.Z. Bank at Edwards-
town. Many architects have other
ranking jobs on their boards.
A second contract for expansion at
Ling’s College has been let to Hansen
s 5 Yuncken, for £4OOO. It involves
he construction of two large class-
ooms. Tenders are under considera-
ion for work on a gymnasium and
•avilion, which is expected to cost
bout £lO,OOO. The first part of the
irork, general alterations and a new
anitary block, has been completed by
Jssery & Son at a cost of £3400.

»r an assembly plant for cars at
>evon Park. The building, which
ill consist mainly of prefabricated
aits raised 3ft. on a base wall, will
iclude an amenities block.
Tenders are being called by the
A. Housing Trust for 105 small
Dmes for the elderly, to be built in
ve groups in various suburbs. Each
Duse will consist of a bedroom, living
room, kitchenette and bathroom, a
small front verandah and a back veran-
dah. Rents will depend on the cost
of construction, but the Trust expects
them to be about £1 a week. Each
house will have a gas fire in the living
room, and an electric washing machine
and wringer in the kitchen.
Caradoc Ashton, Fisher, Woodhead
and Beaumont Smith are also calling
tenders for a group of homes for the
elderly. This, the first of seven to be
built by the Australian Pensioners’
League, will be a group of three at
Payneham, and will cost about £5OOO.
Each group will have a common laun-
dry, and each flat will have living-
room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and
porch.
Large luxury homes are being built
in much greater numbers as building
controls recede further into the past.
In the country especially, wool cheques
are being invested in extra amenities
for more luxurious living, in some
cases on a grand scale.
A contract was let recently for a
home of 4000 sq. ft. at Naracoorte,
costing between £15,000 and £16,000.
The house includes three large bed-
rooms, three bathrooms, including a
maid’s bathroom, living-room, study,
two maid’s bedrooms and a maid’s sit'
ting room. One contract for altera-
tions alone to a house in the northern
pastoral area ran to £14,000, and con-
tracts over five figures for houses of
30 squares and over in the metro-
politan area are let every month. A
refinement which is often introduced
is air-conditioning.
The end of building houses for sale
by the Housing Trust is forecast with-
in a little over a year, as a result of
buyer resistance because of higher
costs and difficulties of finance. The
general manager of the Trust (Mr. A.
M. Ramsay) announced last month
that the Trust was considering whether
it would continue its programme of
houses for sale at Mt. Gambier, where
250 houses for rental or sale have been
completed, and where a housing trust
house can be bought in a month.
Building of houses for rent, where
there is a waiting time of years in the
metropolitan area, is likely to continue
for some time.
Two new industries which will have
a big effect on the supply of building
materials are to be established in
Adelaide, one making concrete
masonry units and the other a wide
range of concrete products.
Equipment to the value of £27.000
has already arrived for a plant to be
established by the Besser Manufac-
turing Co., of Alpena, Michigan,
which will be turning out enough
concrete masonry units for four or
five houses a day by next year. The
plant will centre on a Besser Vibrapac
concrete block machine which is fully
automatic, and capable of producing
more than 50,000 s‘andard-size con-
crete bricks in an eight-hour day. It
will also produce all sizes and types
of concrete masonry units.

THE TOWN PLANNER’S
DILEMMA.
Architect Minus Client.
Dobbs: How can a new town make
such a silly mistake as to produce the
sort of dwellings people dislike? Don’t
they have architects?
Mobbs; Very good architects.
Dobbs; Well, then.
Mobbs: Good building is only pos'
sible when an intelligent client a
future user cooperates closely with
a good designer. A new town is a
town that does not yet exist, to be
occupied by people who are unknown
and unknowing. Until they come,
there is no real client. The client is
represented for the time being by a
corporation and officials who may or
may not have had experience in this
job of town development. The archF
tect has more definite ideas than they
have —a dangerous situation, since all
his life the architect has been wanting
to try out things and ordinary clients
won’t let him.
Dobbs: I see. Hence the Stevenage
flats?
Mobbs: Dunno. I’m not making
case studies. I’m stating basic prim
ciples of behaviour. The client is the
man to be satisfied. He must insist
on his real wants, and be tactful
enough to let the architect have his
head on things he cares less about.
Dobbs: Isn’t the answer for the
•architect to be directed by the sociolo'
gist or demographic expert?
Mobbs: Angels and ministers of
grace defend us!
Dobbs: Then what? This new town
business is hopeless.
Mobbs: No. The managements
learn, and as soon as the first few
hundreds of settlers come along the
situation changes. The client has ar*
rived: the architectural saturnalia is
over. Crawley, for instance, started
with the intention (based on patient
research) to build 25 per cent, of
flats. They told me last week that,
now thousands of people have come
in and expressed their wants, the 25
per cent, has gone down to 2 per cent.
Dobbs: Dear, oh dear. What a
frightful waste of agricultural land.
Mobbs: You read the wrong papers.
Stop worrying and have a drink.
Dobbs; What’s this about New
Towns to Die or Thirst in? . . .

MERITORIOUS LIGHTING AWARD, 1953.
The 1953 Award of The Illuminat'
ng Engineering Society of Australia
(N.S.W.) was won by McDowell’s
Ltd. for the lighting installation of
heir Shoe Salon, located at 378'382
George Street, Sydney.
The Award was for the most meri'
orious commercial lighting installation
)f the past five years.
The eleven-man jury representing
:he 1.E.5., The N.S.W. Chapter of
:he Royal Australian Institute of
Architects, The Electrical Contractors’
Association of N.S.W., The Depart'
nent of Labour 6? Industry, The Re'
:ail Traders’ Association of N.S.W.
md The Standards Association of
Australia, had a difficult task to per'
Form and in doing so reported:
“To judge the degree of merit in
in installation, points should be award'
>d for the difficulties successfully over'
come, and account should also be
taken of the degree of success with
which the lighting and its environ'
ment combine to give a desired and
effective result. Other points which
were considered, besides the general
level of illumination, were emphasis
lighting, arrangement of fittings, ease
of servicing and cleaning, quality and
brightness balance, suitability for the
purpose, degree of expenditure jus'
tilled, and unusual points requiring
skill in application.”
The result of the final voting is in'
teresting, for it is apparent that the
members of the panel were forced to
decide between two installations show'
ing a high degree of merit and skill
in producing a pleasing and effective
result in spite of difficulties presented
by an old building and existing wiring,
or to choose an installation which was
obviously planned to harmonise build'
ing surfaces and lighting into a unified
whole without the limitations imposed
by unsuitable or unalterable buildings.’

Many Entries.
The variety of entries was most
pronounced and the jury felt that
after naming the winning entry, some
remarks should be made regarding
other entries which possessed out-
standing or commendable features, as
follows:
Mark Foy’s Ltd. Main Ground
Floor, Liverpool Street, Sydney:
“A close second, where a very large
and unwieldly area has been treated
quite effectively on the whole and
with ingenious use of spotlighting.”
In this building, which has solid
concrete floors and ceilings, the light'
ing had to be designed to suit the
existing structure and also provide
good seeing conditions and create a
warm and inviting atmosphere.
This effect has been achieved by
surrounding each column with four
40watt 4ft. hot cathode fluorescent
tubes in polished aluminium reflectors,
giving updight to ceiling and pillar
caps, also providing sufficient light for
signs which have lettering overlaid on
sandblasted pinhead morocco glass.
Downlighting is provided by twin
R40'150 watt 120'volt spot lamps,
mounted in aluminium spinnings with
knuckle-joints which limit adjustment
to 35 degrees from vertical, thus mini'
mising glare.
Floral decorations, which are a fixed
feature of the store, are highlighted
with spot lamps of 200 watts in mir'
rored glass reflectors.
Showcases are lighted with lin. dia'
meter 3ft. long 30'watt hot cathode
fluorescent tubes in polished aluminium
reflectors, and furniture has been
bleached to aid the lighting scheme.

ALUMINIUM IN BUILDING
IMPORTANT LONDON SYMPOSIUM.
A Symposium on Aluminium in
Building, organised by the Aluminium
Development Association, was recent'
ly held in London. Three papers
were presented: “An Architect’s Ap-
praisal of Aluminium in Building,”
by Mr. Robert H. Matthew, C.B.E.,
F. Professor of Architecture,
University of Edinburgh; “Aluminium
and Craftsmen in Building,” by Mr.
G. H. Friese'Greene, managing direc'
tor, J. Starkie Gardner Ltd.; and
“Aluminium for Roofing and Clad'
ding,” by Mr. E. G. West, B.Sc.,
technical director. Aluminium De'
velopment Association. The follow'
ing are extracts from the papers.
AN ARCHITECTS APPRAISAL.
ROBERT H. MATTHEW,
C.B.E., F.R.I.B.A.
Looking back on the technical de'
velopment of aluminium in building
since the war, it is possible to see a
significant parallel development in de'
sign, and some remarkable structures
have resulted. The advantage has
been more and more fully exploited
of low weight roof trusses, especially
for wide spans, and characteristic sec'
tions are slowly emerging. The kind
of structures now possible are well
illustrated in a small factory at Mans'
field, where two men could lift the
trusses to roof height; two men could
also lift the 42ft. space frame designed
by Ove Arup for an aero research
factory at Duxford, and the portal
frames spanning 217ft. between pinned
bases in the Comet hangar at London
Airport are clearly the expression of
a new material. With roof cladding
of the same material, as carried out
in a recent factory at Falkirk, the
character is unmistakable, both inter'
nally and externally. The potentialities
for design are well realised in the
handling of the 72ft. long sheet of
corrugated aluminium laid to a low
parabolic curve of 280ft. span on the
hangar at Kloten Airport, Zurich.
Prefabrication.
It so happens that the extrusion
process is well suited to the produc'
tion of economical thin-walled sections
for puttyless glazing, and the light
framework excludes a minimum of
sunlight. The commercial greenhouse
has an undeniable beauty of its own,
although some of the sections appear
to be unnecessarily heavy.
On the human domestic scale, how
ever, prefabrication has not had such
happy results, due, not to lack of op'
portunity—far from it—but rather to
the general method of approach adopt'
ed towards prefabrication by the cem
tral government departments respon'
sible at the end of the war. At that
time, manufacturers with labour, equip-
ment and material available in com-
paratively large quantities were anxious
to enter the building industry as a new
venture with a more or less guaran-
teed market. This is not the occasion
on which to attempt a detailed ac-
count of the great prefabricated effort
of the immediate post-war years. In
the fundamental approach to the prob-
lem the production of the aluminium
house differed in no significant way
from that of many others.
It may be sufficient to point out
that if there ever was a more obvious
chance for manufacturing industry to
enter the building industry in a way
that could have assisted it to make a
great step forward both in production
capacity and the design, that chance
was available at the end of the war.
The fact is that the “prefabs,” whether
of aluminium or not. are chiefly re-
membered for their high cost, their
relatively poor performance under the
test of occupation, and, above all, for
their depressing appearance when
sighted in large groups.
The Part of the Architect.
I may be quite mistaken, but my
analysis of the situation at that time
leads me to the conclusion that if an
architect had taken, or been allowed
to take, an effective part in the de-
velopment team along with the manu-
facturing designer, prefabrication tech-
nique would not have been treated at
the highest level as a mere stop-gap
operation until normal building
methods could be resumed—in other
words, as a technique to be thrown
overboard as soon as possible—which
is, in fact, what has very largely hap-
pened. Of course, everything has not
been lost, the experience has been in-
valuable, and is now being carried on
in other directions, but I feel that the
industry itself can be only too well
aware that a great opportunity has
been largely thrown away. I am
fairly certain that if the architect had
had been a key member of the design
team, his advice, if taken, would have
fundamentally changed the whole con-j
ception of prefabrication.
It is, perhaps, inevitable that de-
signers accustomed to the design of j
highly specialised aircraft should have!
assumed that the only possible ap-
proach to the building problem should
be on similar lines, that is, to the pro-i
duction of a complete unit. This
fundamental mistake killed the de-
velopment of prefabrication in hous-
ing generally, and it is only recently—
and due mainly to the very strenuous
efforts of the design team in the Minis-
A BENDIGO BOWL?
Bendigo may gel a permanent "Holly-
wood Bowl" through the Royal visit, as
the council may build a "Queen
Elizabeth" concert bowl in Rosalind Park
in commemoration of the Queen's visit.
The city engineer is also reporting to
the council on the estimated cost of re-
storing a full water service to enable the
Alexandra fountain (illustrated) in the
Pall Mall to play as spectacularly as
it did more than 40 years ago.

try of Education —that a re-orientation
is becoming possible as applied to
school buildings, and I have no doubt
that this will vitally affect, in time,
the whole building industry. The in-
flexible whole - house units adopted
after the war proved inevitably to be
a dead end. It was at the same time
a salutary, if costly, lesson in the ap-
proach to industrial design applied to
building.
The history of the aluminium
school, on the other hand, is quite
another story, and seems to be the
right initial step towards a new tech-
nique in building. This achievement
has not been easy, and it is clear that
the first attempts were highly coloured
both by aircraft production technique
and prefab, housing experience. It
does seem, however, that emerging
from this intensive phase of develop-
ment is a saner approach of prefab-
rication to building, and the first essen-
tials for anything more than emer-
gency or temporary buildings are now
apparently accepted.
Essentials of New
Approach.
These essentials are, in my opinion,
an abandonment of the conception of
the whole building unit and in its
place a concentration on the manufac-
ture of relatively small, flexible com-
ponents; the combination of modular
sizing with good planning, and the
technical solution of the completely
flat roof.
It is in these schools, above all, that
the characteristics of aluminium in
building have been furthest exploited.
I do not know even now that it is
widely accepted that the tolerances,
thicknesses and shapes that are pos-
sible in aluminium production can
enable wall coverings and their sub-
sidiary framing to contribute appre-
ciably to structural stability, and it is
hoped that this will in future be fully
understood and allowed for by regu-
lating authorities in their building
codes.
Current Problems
and Future.
If I have been critical of the de-
velopment of aluminium it is because
of the immense possibilities and poten-
tialities of this metal in its application
to building; I do not underrate the
development that has already taken
place. In the last few years a great
deal of knowledge has become avail-
able, and, even more importantly from
the point of view of the architect, a
good deal of experience in building
has taken place. There are many
things that the architect would still
like to know; for instance, the full
possibilities of the use of aluminium
for flashings—in some ways the duc-
tility of the metal is ideal for this
purpose, yet in others its very be-
haviour in association with other mate-
rials makes its use for flashings diffi-
cult; the right technique for fitting
together the ends of rollings, pressings,
and extrusions with complicated pro-
files; the effect of condensation on thin
framed walling; the chemical surface
treatment for external use in heavily
polluted atmospheres; the effect of fire
and high temperatures on structural
members. On all these points research
and development work is now taking
place.
ALUMINIUM AND CRAFTSMEN.
By G. H. FRIESE-GREENE.
The key to-day, as in the past, in
the guidance of a new material into
building is the craftsman, particularly
the craftsman versatile in a number
of materials—the modern craftsman —
conscientious and understanding —
found here and there in engineering
shops all over the country.
Aluminium handled by the crafts-
man is not only assured of its place
in tradition, but will revitalise tradition
—not by copying traditional forms,
but by evolving sound novelty out of
them. In recent years, aluminium has
received by the hand of the craftsman
new techniques in surface texturing
and deep tooling.
Processes for Joining.
Recent advances in the processes
for joining aluminium have placed
new techniques at the disposal of the
craftsman. Although aluminium has
been welded for 50 years, the limita-
tions of the early processes prevented
their exploitation, but the commercial
availability of plastic bonding mate-
rials and of the inert-gas arc-welding
equipment and methods allow virtual-
ly any type of joint to be made with
confidence in the workshop and often
on site. Greater scope in design, in-
centive to prefabrication and increased
reliability result from these techno-
logical advances when applied by the
designer and craftsman in aluminium.
To-day, the craftsman is the un-
questioned master of the machine,
whether it be a small power tool or a
colossal lathe. To-morrow, his in-
herited tradition will be a safeguard.
Metals are not competitive in the
craftsman’s eyes: they can, and do,
assist each other. Even plastics come
within the orbit to help, and their
wise use does not compete with, or
detract from, that of metals. The
aluminium industry has everything to
gain in co-opting the art of the crafts-
man and in furthering the practice of
craftsmanship.
Perhaps the time is not far distant
when aluminium in the cast and
wrought forms will be used extensive-
ly to surmount, and span beyond, pre-
designed ground - floor structures of
two-storey domestic dwellings. Tradi-
tional building materials, such as brick,
stone or concrete with timber or other
facings, would form the foundation
and, as it were, grow out of the soil
to suit individual tastes and local con'
ditions.
Such a full'scale blending of tradi'
tional materials with the new would
only be a natural extension in prin'
ciple (but more solid and permanent
in character) of the aluminium prefab'
ricated single-storey dwelling. Foun-
dation and ground'floor accommoda'
tion would be already pre'built on site
in, say, brick, to designs calculated to
carry the load of a superimposed light
metal structure. The top storey, pre'
fabricated, external wall units could
then be cast in some technically and
economically appropriate form of light
alloy to a variety of styles and finishes,
and built up on a simple wrought
aluminium skeleton backed with suit'
able fire'resisting material, leaving an
air space between on already estab'
lished lines.
ROOFING AND CLADDING.
By E. G. WEST, B.Sc.
Aluminium is included in the Minis'
try of Housing and Local Govern-
ment’s new Model Building Bye-laws
as an approved roofing material for
permanent buildings in common with
traditional roofing materials such as
slates, tiles, lead and copper.
British Standards and Codes of
Practice to cover aluminium roofing
and wall cladding will, it is expected,
be produced in the near future. It
may be noted that there exist already
British Standards for cast and wrought
rainwater goods in suitable aluminium
alloys, and that fixing accessories are
also the subject of appropriate British
Standards.
Fully Supported Roofs.
The aluminium fully supported roof
has been the subject of considerable
investigation, and it has been found
possible to adopt many of the standard
practices applied to other metals in
use for this purpose. Detailed recom-
mendations form the subject of a new
publication by the Aluminium De-
velopment Association, and it is honed
that this will form a satisfactory basis
for a Code of Practice in due course.
For plain, fully supported roof
covering, the technique of laying
which has been generally adopted in
this country follows the traditional
systems of jointing known as (a) the
standing seam and (b) the wood rolls
of square or conical sections. Simple
or double lock crosswelts are used for
the transverse joints. Where the pitch
of the roof is greater than 60 degrees
a simple lock cross-welted seam is used,
and where the pitch is less than 60
degrees a double lock cross - welted
seam is recommended.

ably, therefore, over the years we have
changes in dress, habits, preferences in
the various art forms — changes inj
public favour which are encouraged
by the artists, composers and play*
wrights themselves who are constantly
seeking new methods of expression.
In those forms of self-expression, such!
as architecture and lighting, which are
closely allied to engineering, there is
an additional impetus to change be-1
cause of the advances in technology;
the never-ending stream of new de-
vices and techniques accentuates our
desire for change. Change in fashion
is an essential element of living and
should be encouraged; we should be
making fashion more often rather than |
copying in a humdrum effort-saving
way what we have always done. The
effort is worth making; we have the
ideas but our weakness is in failing to
try them on a large scale. The appli-
cation engineer must continue to find
better ways of doing his job. If he
is to receive less stimulus than in the !
past from new light sources then he |
must seek to provide the stimulus in
other ways; he must improve his own
standards.
Education and the Society.
Many people have inefficient, un-
attractive and often archaic lighting,
and it is up to the I.E.S. to show j
them how much better it could be i
done. This is likely to be difficult
because the bare provision of light is
so simple that nearly everyone regards
himself as a lighting expert and can-
not understand how anyone need de-
vote a lifetime to the subject in order
to be proficient in it. It is essential
that the user as well as the designer
appreciates what is good lighting. It
is doubtful if literature and lectures j
alone are sufficient means of educating
the user. It is said that one cannot
teach a child—one can only expose
him to information. The best course
with lighting is probably to expose
the user to good lighting rather than
to good verbiage.
BRITISH HOUSING IMPROVES
50% IN TWO YEARS.
Permanent houses completed in
Britain during May totalled 26,013,;
compared with 19,488 in May, 1952.
In the first five months of 1953,1
118,706 permanent houses were com-j
pleted compared with 90,498 in the j
same period of 1952.
In less than two years, house build-
ing has increased by 50%, and by
mid-19 5 3 the rate of construction
reached 300,000 a year. This achieve-
ment is no mean feat and the building j
trade is to be complimented on
achieving the maximum housing out-
put with the materials available.
Aluminium is used in flat sheet or
coiled strip to compositions (BS.1470)
SlA (99.8 per cent, pure); SIB (99.5
per cent, pure); SlG (99 per cent,
pure); NS3 (aluminium-manganese al-
loy); and NS4 (aluminium-magnesium
alloy); all in the soft condition. The
gauges generally recommended are:
22, 20 and 18 S.W.G. Coiled strip
is generally used to its maximum
width of 2ft. and sheet up to a maxi-
mum width of 2ft. Where the slope
or pitch of the roof is designed to a
fall of less than 10 degrees it is usual
to provide transverse drips spaced be-
tween 10ft. to 15ft. centres to accele-
rate the run-off of water.
Corrugated Sheets.
Perhaps the most widely used form
of aluminium at present is the corru-
gated sheet, especially for roofing in-
dustrial and agricultural buildings,
where the lightness, high strength,
durability, high reflectivity and low
emissivity of the material — ensuring
relatively even temperatures for inter-
nal working conditions — may be more
readily appreciated by the user.
Evidence of the high durability of
the metal under severe corrosive in-
dustrial conditions was seen in a boiler
house in Warrington, Lancashire,
which was covered with ordinary, un-
protected corrugated aluminium sheet
in 1932, Although subjected to con-
tinual exposure to sulphurous fumes
and steam, no maintenance has been
necessary, and after a period of nearly
twenty years, the roof is still in per-
fect condition and completely water-
tight.
Tiles.
Where aesthetic, rather than econo-
mic, interests control, or at least pre-
dominate, in the choice of covering,
roofs, domes and the like may be
aluminium tiling, in which tiles of
either cast alloy or pressed from sheet
are seamed by the conventional man-
ner of nailing to battens. An alterna-
tive and more recent method of cover-
ing is by the assembly of interlocking
panels without the use of nails.
Wall Facings and Window
Spandrels.
Aluminium wall facings and span-
drels can be finished by mechanical,
chemical and electro-chemical methods
to accent the main features in a man-
ner suited to a wide range of architec-
tural styles.
An important advantage of alumi-
nium for window spandrels over many
other materials is their non-staining
characteristics, thus avoiding the un-
sightly appearance of masonry or
brickwork associated with the coloured
corrosion products of other metals.
Further, the ease of casting, extruding
and pressing—methods of fabrication
to which the metal readily lends it-
self—provides the architect with con'
siderable freedom in design.
An average spandrel size, and the
size considered economical to handle
in the foundry, is up to sft. square.
The usual minimum thickness for a
part of this size is about 3/16in. In
the Paddington district, however, there
is an installation of cast aluminium
spandrels— now twenty years old—in'
eluding some 16 castings about Bft.
long by 4ft. 6in. wide; here, the metal
is £in. thick. Material thickness de'
pends to some extent upon the in'
tricacy of the design or ornamentation
required.
When spandrels are assembled from
pressed sheet, extruded sections, or a
combination of these, they can be
much larger. They are usually fixed
by brackets welded to the back or by
bolting; another method of fixing is
by clips held by wooden blocks or
studs inserted for supports.
A clearance of about O.Olin. (plus
or minus) per foot run is usually
allowed for expansion and contraction
between the spandrels and adjoining
masonry, brickwork, etc., and joints
are caulked with bituminous or other
suitable elastic caulking compounds.
The usual practice of painting, or of
fitting suitable insulating washers, is,
or course, applied in joining metals of
dissimilar composition and in fixing
aluminium into the adjoining masonry,
brickwork, concrete, etc.
Claddings.
During the past few years aluminium
as a side wall cladding has gained in'
creasing recognition, due, no doubt, to
the wide use made of this material in
<• h e construction of non ' traditional
buildings.
Roof Lights and Glazing
Bars.
An important application of alu-
minium in roofing is inevitably finked
with both corrugated and flat sheet
coverings namely, roof fights and
glazing bars. A successful recent de'
velopment is the new corrugated alu'
minium sheet roof fight. This par'
ticular unit is fabricated to correspond
in width to the 10/3in. corrugated
sheet with which it is interchangeable.
The length in which it is normally
supplied is sft., but variation of length,
within certain limits, can be supplied
to order. The nominal weight of the
unit unglazed is Blb. Other types are
under development.
One of the most striking advances
made by aluminium in the building in'
dustry is the extent to which extruded
glazing bars have been developed.
The lightness of aluminium alloys,
combined with adequate strength and
resistance to attack by corrosive atmos'
pheres provide significant advantage
over the traditional types of protected
steel bars.

Our designer in this foursome has given a variety of plan and elevational treatment. Each house
actually has the same sleeping accommodation—two bedrooms—though the bottom right with

CORONATION CONVENTION REPORTS.
(1) THE MASTER BUILDERS’
ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA.
It is my pleasure and privilege to
;übmit a brief review of the more im-
sortant matters that have engaged the
ittention of my Association and its
iffiliates at Ballarat, Bendigo and Gee-
ong during the past twelve months.
Membership.
As at 30th June, 1953, our mem-
)ership figures were as follows:
trade Conditions.
The position of the building indus-
ry is still very difficult, and this is
jrought about by the many obstacles
vhich are thrown in the way of build-
:rs, particularly by various controls,
these controls have a definite tend-
:ncy to inflate costs and keep prices
ligh, and do not permit the industry
o give the value for money to the
sublic which could be achieved were
hese controls obliterated. One shin-
ng example peculiar to Victoria has
seen the cement position: the State
jovernment bans the use of the
:heaper or local cement for industrial
vorks, although it in my opinion mis-
ises its powers in applying the cheap-
:r local article for its own purposes
md compelling a section of the in-
lustry to use the expensive imported
irticle. The position is aggravated by
he Federal Government refusing to
ssue permits to importers, who would
se prepared to carry stocks of import-
id cement so that buildings could be
:arried on at a faster and more econ-
jmical pace. This position is peculiar
o Victoria alone of all Australian
states, and the Federal authorities
:onsistently refuse to recognise it.
The building industry in my opin-
on is being badly affected by unfore-
leen intrusions. I refer particularly to
he owner-home building. This situ-
ition is being largely and loudly en-
:ouraged by certain local newspapers,
vithout thought or regard to its far-
caching consequences. Labour, sub-
:ontractors and merchants are certain-
y retaining inflated prices. These in-
lationary prices are having a much
nore detrimental effect on the whole
)f the building industry than is gen-
ially realised, and are keeping the
:osts of labour and material at a
ligher level than is warranted. The
popular opinion that in order to re-
duce building costs builders must re-
duce their profits is entirely wrong.
High costs are not due to builders’
profits, but to unsavoury conditions
which at present apply in the build'
ing industry. If politicians were in
earnest on giving housing the prior-
ity it should have, we see no reason
why all taxation on housing should
not be entirely removed. This is be-
ing done very successfully in certain
other countries, with remarkable ef'
fects; so much so that where housing
comprised an odd building or two,
it is now the major building work in
those countries, and the price level is
being kept at a most reasonable and
sensible figure. This result could be
attained in this country if the scheme
was properly thought out and put
into practice.
A major blow was struck at the
building industry through the shortage
of Government funds, and the cancel'
lation of so much constructive works
will leave the industry in a difficult
position.
It is pleasing to see and note the
great efforts which are being made at
the present time by members of the
Master Builders’ Association in their
concentrated endeavours to eliminate
all wastage in connection with the
building industry in order to reduce
costs. It is very noticeable that at the
present time this effort is largely be-
ing carried out by builders only, but
we believe that builders will be strong
enough to force the entire industry to
readjust itself on such an economical
basis that it will again put the building
industry where it belongs. It is cer-
tainly the desire of the Master Build'
ers’ Association that all waste and
unnecessary costs should be eliminat'
ed so that the general public can se-
cure the buildings it needs at reason-
able cost. These matters are at pres-
ent being handled in a very definite
manner by the M.8.A., and we hope
for the co-operation of the rest of the
industry,
A great interest is being displayed
by members of the M.B.A. engaged in
home building, and an endeavour is
being made to place the general pub-
lic in such a position that it will not
have any further need to deal with
the undesirable element which has
crept into the industry, and has been
unfairly used by the press particular-
ly. Builders generally have had to
shoulder the blame for both dishon-
est and indifferent work. None of
these builders, fortunately, are mem-
bers of our Association, nor will they
ever be members, and the Associa-
tion is endeavouring to make the pub'
lie realise that home builders who are
members of the M.B.A. are the men
who will do an honest and genuine
job. Further efforts to educate the
public on this point are in the pro'
cess of being arranged at the present
juncture.
I believe the future position is con'
solidating itself in such a way that
it will not be very long before works
can be carried out in the efficient man'
ner and with the speed equivalent to
days gone by. However, it is in my
opinion a deplorable fact that there
is such a dearth of piajor city build'
ings, and, until such buildings are
proceeded with, there will be a back-
ward trend in our fine City of Mel'
bourne. Unless the business commun'
ity is prepared to pay the equivalent
price for what it receives, Melbourne
will continue to be stagnant, and the
commercial world must realise that it
cannot have it both ways.
Association Premises.
The many activities of the Associa'
tion have been greatly facilitated by
its possession of spacious and well-ap-
pointed meeting rooms and office ac'
commodation out of the inner city
area, and it is confidently anticipated
that the expenditure incurred in com
nection with the premises will prove
a very sound investment, both from
the financial viewpoint and in regard
to the benefits derived by members.
It is to be regretted that, at the
close of the Association’s financial
year, the use of a portion of the prem-
ises was still not yet available to the
Association, and it is hoped that in
the near future this drawback will be
overcome. During the past twelve
months a welcome addition to revenue
has been obtained by allowing ap'
proved organisations to hold meetings
at the Association’s premises, and it
is expected that the income from this
source will increase when the addi-
tional board room is at our disposal.
Industrial Matters.
Throughout the year, members
were kept informed, through the cost'
ing schedule published in “The Aus'
tralian Builder” and Industrial Service
Bulletins, of changes in wage rates and
other industrial matters affecting the
building industry.
In addition to the activities of the
Industrial Sub'Committee, a consider'
able amount of time and thought has
been devoted to the protection of the
interests of employers by Association
nominees on Wages Boards, Trade
Committees of the Apprenticeship
Commission, and other bodies.
Transport Regulations.

Board of regulations having as their

Something went wrong
Every year hundreds of commercial and industrial con-
cerns are “burnt into bankruptcy.” Most of these disasters
would have been avoided if Guardian Automatic Fire
Alarms had been installed. The moment a fire starts the
specially designed thermostat of the Guardian Automatic
Fire Alarm reacts to the rise in temperature. Automatically
it transmits a signal through the control panel in the
burning building to the nearest Fire Station, in most cases
before the fire gets really under way. A Guardian
Automatic Fire Alarm never sleeps, never takes time off.
It ensures full protection day and night, 365 days in
the year.

aim the improvement of railway finan-
ces at the expense of road transport
users was regarded as a serious matter
by the Association. On behalf of
members, representations were made
to the authorities, stressing the increas-
ed costs and inconvenience that would
be inflicted on the building industry
by such regulations, and every effort
was made to ensure that the industry
would receive fair treatment in this
connection.
Commercial Arbitration.
Many requests were received by the
Association for the appointment of ar-
bitrators for the settlement of dis-
putes relating to contracts. The co-
operation of members who have been
asked to act in this capacity has been
greatly appreciated by the President,
and has proved of material assistance
to those concerned.
“The Australian Builder.”
Publication of “The Australian
Builder” has proved of continued
value to the industry and has reached
a high standard. Its wide circulation
and the increased volume of advertis-
ing indicate that it has won general
acceptance on its merits, and the sup-
port given to it by Exchange Members
and others is very gratifying to all
concerned in its preparation.
Affiliated Associations.
During the year visits were paid by
our representatives to the Associations
of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong,
with whom our relations, as in past
years, have been on a very cordial
basis of mutual assistance.
Finance.
During the year a Finance Commit-
tee was appointed in accordance with
the Articles of Association, comprising
the Hon. Treasurer (Mr. G. Prentice)
as Convener, and Messrs. L. Cockram,
J. E. Simmie, and L. Thompson. As
a result of the Committee’s recom-
mendations, measures were taken to
place the Association’s finances on a
more satisfactory basis.
As a temporary expedient, advances
were made by members of the Execu-
tive Committee. Arrangements were
also put in train for the issue of de-
bentures, bearing interest at the rate
of 5 per cent, per annum, to the total
value of £lO,OOO, to Association and
Exchange members. The consent of
the Capital Issues Board was obtained
for such issue, for which the whole-
hearted support of members is antici-
pated.
Rise and Fall Agreement.
As a result of negotiations carried
out between the Association and the
Royal Victorian Institute of Archi-
tects, an agreement was made in rela-
tion to Costs Adiustments on Fixed
Sum Contracts. This agremeent, which
provided for the use of an agreed
formula for the ascertainment of in-
creases or decreases in costs during the
currency of the contract, came into
operation on 15th April, 1953.
Association Insurance Scheme.
Many members have taken advant-
age of the arrangements made with
Federation Insurance Limited, by which
Association members receive substan-
tial direct benefits and an over-riding
commission on transactions effected is
paid to the Association funds.
Social Activities.
As in the past, the social activities
of the Association and Builders’ Ex-
change have provided many oppor-
tunities for members to meet each
other, and attendances at the various
functions held have been good. The
bowls and golf matches arranged dur-
ing the year were most successful, in-
dicating that such facilities for recrea-
tion are meeting a very real need for
those engaged in the industry.
Staff.
Mr. J. W. Neilson, Assistant Secre-
tary and former Secretary of the As-
sociation, was farewelled on his re-
tirement in May, 1953, after a long
period of loyal service.
The administration of the Associa-
tion’s affairs was seriously affected by
the absence for the greater part of the
year of the Secretary (Mr. E. S. Eh
liott), following his accident in Oc-
tober, 1952. Mr. J. O’Keeffe, of the
Building Industry Congress, acted as
Secretary for several months, during
which he rendered timely assistance to
the Association.
Mr. D. J. Golding, 8.A., 8.C0m.,
was appointed Assistant Secretary as
from 29th June, 1953, and Acting
Secretary during Mr. Elliott’s absence
on an extended period of sick leave.
Conclusion.
In spite of the many difficulties en-
countered during the year, I feel that
the Association has become a stronger
and more united body, and it is grati-
fying to have had such good support
from members in their endeavours to
solve the many problems that have
arisen.
I am indebted especially to Mr.
Gordon Longmuir, who as Senior
Vice-President, took charge of the As-
sociation’s affairs during my absence
abroad, when many matters in con-
nection with the building industry re-
quired attention. Many others also
rendered valued assistance at this
time, and to them my thanks are due.

In presenting this review of our ac'
tivities during the year ended 30th
June, 1953, we would firstly like to
extend our sincere greetings to the
Executive, Honorary Vice'Presidents,
and all Delegates here assembled. We
trust the Convention will be such as
will, in later years, be one of your
most satisfying and pleasurable mem-
ories.

Obituary.
It is with deep regret that I have
to record the loss during the year of
the following members: W. Fair'
weather, Senr. (a Past'President and
Life Member), S. Totterdell, and R.
Falkingham.
Building Controls.
With the change of Government dur'
ing the early part of this year the
position has not altered to any mark'
ed degree, and certain restrictions,
mainly as to the specifying of import'
ed materials for those in short supply
locally, are still in operation. At the
request of the new Minister for Hous'
ing, Mr. H. E. Graham, M.L.A., a
Deputation waited upon him and pre'
sented the viewpoint of the Associa'
tion. The Minister stated that the
change of political control did not in'
dicate a drastic or radical alteration
in the operations of the State Hous'
ing Commission, nor interference with
the industry itself. He stressed that
his immediate objective was to reduce
costs and improve efficiency and to
this end he asked the Association to
submit its written ideas as to how these
objectives could best be achieved.
This was done, the main suggestions
being: Preparation of Uniform By'
Laws and Building Regulations which
would apply to all districts; Quicker
provision of Services, such as Roads,
Power, Water Supply, etc., and sys'
tematic approach to solution of ma-
terials problems in seeking relief to
existing shortages; Improvement in
quality and adhering to standards.
Industrial Conditions.
The State Basic Wage as at date of
compilation of this report stands at
£l2/1/10, compared with £ll/3/10
this time last year.
Tradesmen’s Wages in Metropolitan
area are:
Building Trades Award.
After a protracted hearing the
Court finally issued its new Award on
28th January, 1953, and certain pro'
visions are giving us cause for con'
cern. Trade margins were increased
by 6A per week and Leading Hand
Labourers margin by 3/'.
Tool Allowances have been awarded
as follows:
Special Rates and Provisions.
These conditions have been con'
siderably varied so as to provide an
approximate increase in all allowances
of 50%.
Inclement Weather.
A provision has been made for the
payment of an allowance, at ordinary
rates, for time lost through inclement
weather, up to a maximum of eight
(8) hours in any one (1) week, sub'
ject to certain specified conditions.
Excess Fares and
Travelling Allowances.
The employer has now to pay all
fares in excess of 1/6 per day incurred
by each worker. A special travelling
allowance has been granted, which
provides that all workers who travel
in excess of twelve miles per day shall
be entitled to a travelling allowance of
4d. per mile in excess of 12 miles
travelled each day up to a maximum
of 4/' per day. Where transport is
provided by employer half the above
rate shall apply. No disputes have
disrupted the trade so that the good
relationship existing with all Unions
has continued unimpaired.
The general conditions in the in'
dustry have shown a slow tendency to
improve and though wages still con'
tinue to increase, there has been a
steady and persistent return to normal
competition in the trade. Builders
are now tendering on a firm basis
which indicates a healthy swing back
to pre'war conditions.
Credit restriction has, in the main,
proved of benefit in that it has elim-
inated certain non'essential work and
directed both materials and labour to
where they are mpst required.
Continued on page 57.
TIMBER BORERS.
Building Research Liaison Service has
made extensive investigations into
"borer" pests which attack Australian
timbers. There are three main classes
of borers, the most common of which
is the Lyctus, most usually met with by
house builders. This attacks only the
outer layer of sapwood in cut timber
when the surface is beginning to dry
out (top figure). The Lyctus does not
attack either softwoods, or the living
tree. It only enters certain types of
hardwoods. Scrubwood timbers of the
coastal rain forests, white birch, yellow
carabeen, white cheesewood, etc., which
are found in New South Wales and
Queensland, may have a sapwood band
many inches thick that is susceptible to
attack. The Pinhole borer attacks only
living trees, the newly-felled tree or
green sawn timber. When dry the tim-
ber is immune from this pest. Informa-
tion concerning borers and their pre-
ventive treatment may be obtained from
C.S.I.R.O. (Publication 26) from the Re-
search Service, 96 Harrington Street,
Sydney, 69 Yarrabank Road, South Mel-
bourne, or local offices in other States.

HOUSES SELL QUICKLY
WHEN YOU INSTALL
SLIDING DOORS
ON BANGOR TRACK
These two houses are pretty much alike. But one sold
before the paint was on the walls and the other was
"For Sale” months after it was finished.
These days when money is
tighter a house has to offer
something extra to sell fast.
The quick-selling house has
sliding doors one in the
kitchen and another lead-
ing onto a sun deck. It was
those two doors that caught
the buyer’s eye.
SPACE SAVING
Install sliding doors in every
house you build—all run-
ning on Bangor Sliding
Door Track.
It’s amazing the space they
add to an ordinary 10 to 12
square house. Buyers are
impressed when you tell
them every sliding door
gives them 9 square feet
more living space. They
like the look of sliding
doors, too.
MODERN APPEARANCE
Bangor Track will carry
any type of door from
standard-size flush doors to
big custom-made jobs. It’s
as suitable in the laundry as
the living room. Conceal
the working parts under a
modern pelmet.
INSTALLING BANGOR
COSTS VERY LITTLE
And it's so simple. One man can
put up a sliding door in an hour
or two. There's not much difference
between that and hinges. Convert-
ing existing swinging doors to sliding
ones is simple, too.
SLIDE THE
GARAGE
DOOR ON
BANGOR. TOO
No one wants to buy a house
where they’d be battling with
old-fashioned garage doors
fighting to swing doors against
the wind. Bangor “Round the
Corner” track runs the doors
neatly along the side wall of the
garage. Rolls open with just a
slight push.

Continued from page 55.
Building Materials.
The supply and quality of all build-
ing materials has shown definite signs
of improvement and in some cases
manufacturers are now being forced
to pay increased attention to quality
rather than quantity. The opening re-
cently of a new modern terra-cotta
tile factory should go a long way to
easing the tile position and speeding
up the most essential roofing jobs.
Dried timber, especially flooring, is
still in short supply and presents, per-
haps, the most difficult problem of all.
Quantity Limits.
Following discussions between the
Federal Executives of the R.A.I.A.
and Master Builders’ Federation, agree-
ment has been reached on this ques-
tion, and it is anticipated that we in
this State will soon have the necessary
new Conditions of Tender Forms re-
printed and copies will be immediate-
ly issued to members for their guid-
ance.
Approaches have been made to
Eastern State Associations asking that
any of their members tendering for
work in this State abide by our local
Conditions.
Rise and Fall Clause.
During the year agreement was
reached with the W.A. Chapter R.A.
LA. that generally in Short Term
Contracts this Clause would be dis-
continued. With reference to Long
Term or Industrial Work, the matter
was to remain the province of the
Owner, Architect, and Builder, re-
spectively, as to whether the clause
should be operative.
Joint Committee.
It is pleasing to be able to record
that several meetings have been held
during the year, and in all cases the
views of the Architects and ourselves
have been practically identical.
Sub-Contractors.
With the proposed elimination of
the Rise &? Fall Clause your Associa-
tion has made efforts to ensure that
sub-contractors and suppliers elimin-
ate the Clause from their quotes. De-
termined opposition to sub-contractors
issuing schedules of Fixed Prices was
continued, and our contention that
all such work must be on a competi-
tive or tender basis forced home.
Commonwealth Building Research.
During June of this year we were
able to arrange a Film Night and
Lecture by Mr. R. E. Banks of this
Department, and the capacity audi-
ence was very appreciative of the
evening. We are exceedingly grate-
ul to the Shell Co. of Aust. Ltd.,
vho made available their Theatrette
and staff for the evening, and also
provided the refreshments with which
the night was concluded. It was in'
deed a much-appreciated gesture.
Monthly Meetings.
It is pleasing to record an increased
attendance of younger members dur'
ing the last few months, but there is
still room for a much greater display
of interest in the activities of the As'
sedation by the Metropolitan mem'
hers. During the year a Film Night
followed one of the monthly meetings
and films on “Prestressing” and
“Ductubes” were shown by Mr. H.
A. Doust, and one of the 1952 Con'
vention by Mr. L. F. Sandwell.

Preliminary.
In presenting to you the Annual
Report of the South Australian Build'
ers and Contractors’ Association In'
corporated to the 47th Annual Con'
vention of the Master Builders’ Fed'
eration of Australia held in this fair
city of Melbourne. I desire firstly to
introduce to you the South Australian
delegation. With myself as Delega-
tion Leader, I am supported by Mr.
G. F, Brimblecombe, Mr. G. H. Frick'
er and Mr. H. F. Sarah. Our Presi'
dent, Mr. Reg Nurse, and our Treas-
urer, Mr. William Essery, are accom'
panying us in their respective Federal
capacities as the Honorary Assistant
Treasurer and Past President respect'
ively. Our Council Member, Mr. M.
C. Wood, is also attending on this OC'
casion in our support.
The various activities and progress
of the South Australian Association
in its relation to the Federation are
mainly within the intimate knowledge
of the Federation through the active
operation of the Executive Commit'
tee of the Federation during the year,
and with some small exceptions the
reports of the Executive will voice
South Australia’s viewpoint and actions
upon those matters which have been
of Federal import.
Obituary.
We express the sympathy of the
South Australian Builders and Con-
tractors’ Association to Mrs. Wilson,
the members of the Master Builders’
Federation of New South Wales, and
to the Federal Executive on the pass'
ing of Mr. Fred. Wilson. He was a
man who gave freely of his time and
talents to the building industry, and
we feel that his passing will be felt,
not only in the State of New South
Wales, but through the building in'
dustry generally in the whole of the
Commonwealth.
Membership.
As at the 30th June, 1953, the total
membership of the Association con-
sists of:
These members employed an esti-
mated average number of 3,806 build-
ing tradesmen, which compares with
the total number of 9,092 building op-
eratives in South Australia employed

cally the principles laid down by the
Federation in its previous deliberations.
The local arrangements existing in
South Australia were given in full de-
tail in our 1952 report to the Federa-
tion, and in the main it provides for
the obligatory adoption of quantities
where:
(a) in the case of house works
the estimated cost does not
exceed £15,000,
(b) in all other works the esti-
mated cost does not exceed
£20,000.
We are, as you see, perhaps the
least advanced State in this respect of
quantities agreement, and we have
not reached the stage where quantity
surveying is accepted generally as an
integral part of contracting. We do,
however, believe we are progressing,
and we look forward to the day when
arrangements will not be necessary to
ensure the practice of quantity sur-
veying in all appropriate building
works.
Rise and Fall.
The necessity for the Rise and Fall
Clause and its application in contracts
is being treated in a practical manner
with due regard to the type and dura-
tion of any proposed work. We can,
in fact, report that this practice is
fast becoming one when the inclusion
of the Rise and Fall Clause is the ex-
ception rather than the rule in South
Australia. We do welcome this trend,
but at the same time we insist upon its
provision where it is genuinely war-
ranted.
Federal Building Construction
Prize Examination.
We are pleased to report that we
shall have a candidate in the forthcom-
ing Federal Building Construction
Prize Examination for 1953. Our ex-
perience from the conduct of the
marking of the 1952 papers has as-
sisted South Australia greatly in our
endeavours to advance the standard of
apprenticeship and trade practice edu-
cation in our State.
We are so advancing in our inves-
tigations and deliberations that we
hope to have a complete Building
Construction Diploma Course in op-
eration next year, and thus we will
be able to bring to the kernel of the
building construction industry the
same academic qualifications as exist
in other sections of the industry,
as engineering and architecture. This
Building Diploma Course, which we
hope to have instituted next year, is
following generally the same curricu-
lum as that existing in the Building
Diploma Course conducted by the
Sydney Technical College.
Industrial.
Probably the most obscure but
nevertheless outstanding achievement
of the year has been the preservation
of industrial peace in the ranks of our
operatives. We have enjoyed the most
cordial relations with the principal
trades unions.
The basic wage fluctuations have in'
creased the take home pay by 18/4d.
a week with a further rise of 3/4
commencing as from August. Plast-
erers were also granted an allowance
of 1/6 a week for excess wear and
tear of clothing. Some protracted dis-
cussions and industrial Court proceed-
ings have taken place with regard to
annual leave entitlement —they have
concluded without penalty upon the
industry.

The practice of the past few years
of employers paying in excess of the
awarded rates is fast disappearing.
There is, however, a vast amount of
week-end work in housing being per-
formed by those employed throughout
the week under industrial conditions
in the industry.
Apprentices.
We are able to report a very grati-
fying number of apprentices in the
principal building trades. They are:
The graduating rates of pay of ap-
prentices range from £3/9/6 (first six
months Painters) to £l2/10/0 (fifth
and final year Carpenters at Whyalla).
The full scale of rates for Carpenter
and Joiner apprentices generally are;
We are pleased to report that our
Association members have given much
of their time at the various appren'
ticeship Trade Classes with very heart'
ening results, and an amount of £7B
has been donated by the Association
during the past year for prizes in the
various trade sections of the industry.
Building Controls.
In February of this year the South
Australian Government rescinded the
operation of the Building Controls

OFFICE BUILDING ON STILTS.
This new oblong shaped office building
in Pretoria, South Africa, has a pattern-
ed and glazed facade. Situated in a
residential district, the height of the
building is limited to four levels if we
include the ground floor which will be
used for parking, thus determining its
long low character. Front and back
walls are mostly glazed, with extension
fins and adjustable louvres. Both these
are precast and faced with white mosaic.
Set behind are precast spandrels faced
with contrasting bright blue mosaic.

noticeable increase in building activity,
but it has removed a great incon-
venience to legitimate building con-
tractors and has enabled greater ' effi-
ciency in their organisations.
In conclusion, Mr. President, I de-
sire to thank you on behalf of the
South Australian Delegation for the
hospitality you have afforded us dur-
ing our sojourn in your beautiful
citv »nd we trust that the delibera-
tions of this Convention will not only
be of material benefit to all our mem-
bers, but to the building industry gen-
erally throughout the Common-
wealth.
HENRY WILCKENS,
Delegation Leader.
(4) MASTER BUILDERS’
ASSOCIATION OF TASMANIA.
It gives me pleasure to report to
you on our activities for the year
ended 30th June, 1953.
Membership of the Association at
the end of this year totalled 50, which
includes 10 Associate Members; mem-
bership of our affiliated Associations
in the North and North-West is 94.
Executive members are as follows:
President; Mr. D. R. Aait.
Vice-President: Mr. C. E. Daw.
Immediate Past President: Mr. T.
M. Lipscombe.
Hon. Treasurer: Mr. C. K. Gillham.
Building Controls.
Effective from Ist July, 1953, all
building controls in Tasmania have
been abolished. This has been a long-
felt need in this State and the indus-
try should be better for the removal
of this restriction.
Industrial.
The current basic wage in Hobart
is £l2/2/0 per week, and the ruling
rates of pay are as follows:
No disputes have occurred during
State, members are obliged to pay em-
ployees according to the State Deter-
mination which provides for higher
rates. This is having a serious effect
on building activity, and particularly
is this evident in the North of the
State. In the North-West the posi-
tion is so serious as to prompt the
State Government to make further
work available to absorb unemployed
building workers.
In Tasmania the Government still
continues to carry out work on a day
labour basis, despite strong protests
from this Association.
Building Statistics.
During the quarter ended 31st
March, 1953, 704 new houses were
completed in Tasmania. Of these,
340 were built by private builders, 56
by Government day labour and 308
by owner-builders. These figures show
a decrease of 28.4% compared with
the December quarter, 1952, and is
the lowest number of completions re-
corded since the last quarter of 1949.
The number of houses commenced
during the March quarter 1953 was
695. This is 41.2% more than in the
December quarter, 1952.
Since September, 1945, a total of
18,741 houses have been commenc-
ed in Tasmania.
During the March quarter, 1953,
the value of new buildings (other than
houses) commenced was £315,000, or
£ll,OOO less than the December quart-
er, 1952, and £153,000 less than dur-
ing the corresponding period in 1952 n
Clear evidence of the falling off over
the last year in the building trade in
Tasmania is shown in the following
summary of value of work commenc-
ed:
1947 £2,718,000
1948 £3,607,000
1949 £5,371,000
1950 £8,379,000
1951 £10,336,000
1952 £11,104,000
1952/53:
September quarter £1,604,000
December quarter £1,441,000
March quarter .... £1,933,000
June quarter not available
General.
The past year in Tasmania has seen
a severe tightening in the building in-
dustry, although recent weeks have
shown slight improvement. Building
statistics clearly show the extent of
the decrease in activity, if the final
quarter of the year’s statistics reveals
figures similar to the earlier part of
the year.
It is clear that building employees
are realising the time has come for a
better class of work and more rapid
production. I feel therefore that as
the present decline in building has
been responsible for this awakening,
some good has been done. I believe
that the resultant good will remain
during the brighter period of activity
which I am sure will be evident during
the coming year.
Our close liaison with the two affili-
ated Associations in the North of the
State has been maintained, and the
continuance of this co-operation dur-
ing the next year will be most bene-
ficial to all concerned.
The following statistics are record-
ed for information:

Obituary.
We express our deepest regret at
the passing of Fred. Wilson, who was
an esteemed officer of the Federation.
His advice and wisdom will be sad'
ly missed both by the Building In'
dustry and the community in general,
and we extend our condolences to
the Federation and the New South
Wales Association.
State of Trade.
The total elimination of Building
Controls has given a marked impetus
to building activity in this State, par-
ticularly commercial construction.
There has also been a building
revival in all seaside resorts, both in
domestic and commerdial constuction.
The demand for housing although
easing slightly is still consistent, and
sufficient to occupy members engaged
in that section of the Industry.
The State Housing Commission has
practically ceased calling tenders for
Group House construction, on which
work many members were employed.
Their prefabricated programme has
come to a halt with some of the over'
seas contractors, and in one case the
Commission has taken over the con'
tract for completion.

In our previous report the opinion
was expressed that there should be a
review of future options, and in view
of recent developments it is reason'
able to assume that this type of con'
struction will be curtailed rather than
expanded.
In the six months from September,
1952, to February, 1953, excluding
imported prefabricated housing 5613
dwellings were approved.
At the end of the September
quarter, 1952, the number of houses
completed totalled 2868.
Of these 73 were built by Gov'
ernment Day Labour, 597 under Gov'
ernment sponsored schemes including
293 imported prefabricated dwellings,
1425 by private contractors and 773
by owner builders.
Houses under Government spom
sored schemes with the exception of
imported prefabricated projects, are
constructed by private contractors.
The latter therefore completed 60%
of the total housing for the period
under review.
In recent months there has been a
decline in the number of houses con'
structed by owner builders which
formerly averaged the high figure of
29% of total construction.
The total volume of building ap-
provals in the March quarter of 1953
exceeded twice the corresponding pre'
war amount, 75% of such approvals
being related to dwellings.
There has also been a marked im'
provement in commercial construction
during 1953, the value of approvals
being 64% above the 1952 monthly
average.
In country areas the industry has
been kept reasonably busy, and there
is every indication that there will be
an increased amount of work available
during the current year.
The confidence expressed in the
last report has been justified, and pro'
viding costs can be kept to a reason'
able level, the future prospects of the
industry are reassuring.
Supplies.
Supplies generally, are more readily
obtainable, with the exception of

the plant to be used to produce gas
from brown coal will come from Eng-
land and Germany. Some will be made
in Australia. At the close of 1952, after
one year of operation, 2500 tons of
steel reinforced concrete foundations
were completed. Since then consider-
able further work has been put in hand.

Industrial.
The industry, with the exception
of a temporary stoppage on one job
has continued to be free from indus'

Apprenticeship,
Since the last report the claim for
an increase in apprenticeship wage
rates has been granted, and a further
application for an increase in the tool
allowance to apprentices in the first
three years has also been approved.
Over the past twelve months there
has been an increase in the number
of applications for apprenticeship to
the Carpentry trade, and this is illus'
trated in the following comparison:

ent are causing the gradual elimination
of this clause, but it is considered that
such a clause is necessary on iobs
which are likely to exceed siv months.
The Commonwealth Department of
Works and Housing recently inform'
ed the Association that no Rise and
Fall would be allowed on jobs up to
twelve months duration.
The matter was discussed with the
Department and the Association press'
ed for a time limit of six months.
It is understood that the Federation
has also taken this up with the auth'
orities in Canberra, and we ask that
it be pressed with vigor.
Quantity Agreement and Sealed
Bills of Quantity.
The Association appreciated the ef'
fort of the Federal Executive in ac'
complishing an agreement with the
Architects on these items.
Although the Quantity agreement
is slightly wider than the one we had
with our Local Chapter of Architects
both Associations have since conferred
and adopted the new conditions.
The Agreement on Sealed Bills of
Quantities has now rectified a matter
which was causing concern to our
members.

NEWSLETTER
Owing to the present acute short'
age of galvanised iron and cement in
this State, a bill to be introduced in
the State Parliament soon will extend
the control over these materials till
the end of 1954 at least. This will be
by amendment to the Building Mater-
ials Controls Act, and is considered ne-
cessary to ensure equitable distribu-
tion of supplies.
However, in somewhat the oppo-
site direction the following goods were
decontrolled: Fibres, asbestos, clothes
and wringers, domestic washing ma-
chines, rubber gloves, roofing and
sheathing paper, electrical insulating
paper and boards, sarking paper, in-
cluding Sisalkraft, cases, including
crooks, shocks, and tinplate.
Fire Damage.
Fires caused damage to three city
and suburban buildings during the
past three weeks. These were; the
Church of Christ at Northcote, which
was destroyed by fire, and caused

building at Melbourne Technical Cob
lege.
The fire at the College commenced
in a chemistry laboratory on the first
floor, which room it completely de'
stroyed, and spread to adjacent labora'
tory and lecture rooms, also through
the floor above and the slate roof. Es'
timated water damage to the rooms
below was included in the estimate
of £60,000 damages. This building
has great historical value, being the
first of the College buildings built at
a cost of £ll,OOO. It has external and
main internal walls of stone which re-
tarded the fire. The building is one
of the only two Gothic buildings re'
maining in the city since the destruc'
tion of Wilson Hall at the University.
Cleaning up operations began prompt'
ly, and the workmen are using an alu'
minium lined inclined chute of tim'
ber construction to load rubbish and
debris through windows (which of
necessity had their stone tracery
knocked out) to waiting trucks at the
much lower level of the road. It has
been decided to reconstruct the dam'
aged portion of the building in the
same Gothic style as when built in
188 2'87.
Demolition work on the site of
Hosies’ Hotel at the corner, of Eliz'
abeth and Flinders Streets, Mel'
bourne, is complete and tenders have
been called for the construction of a
new multi'Storey building to replace it.
Following demolition works on the
fire'damaged Wilson Hall at the Mel'
bourne University all that remains is
the base works and footings, of stone.
Plans for the new hall were approved
by the University Council some
months ago.
The Melbourne University Council
has approved the purchase of pro'
perty in Royal Parade, Parkville, for
approximately £23,000 as the site for
the proposed International House to
accommodate Asian students. The
Council has appointed Leighton Irwin
and Co. as architects, and Mr. Ray'
mond Berg as consultant.
Church Building.
Several new school buildings and a
new classroom wing have been form'
ally opened during the past month.
A new Church of England school for
over 300 girls at Ringwood East,
completed in 17 months for £85,000,
has a bright colour scheme, many
louvred windows, floor heating, and
sound absorbent materials. This school
is really a dispersal from the more
densely populated area of Hawthorn
to the more inconvenient transport
but healthier conditions at Ringwood
East. The new classroom wing was
at Shelford Girls’ Grammar School,
Caulfield. A Roman Catholic school
—St. Columbus Girls’ School was also
opened recently.
A new memorial chapel at St.
Patrick’s College, Ballarat, was also
opened lately. The chapel cost
£85,000, and it has not been excelled
in the Commonwealth for design, con'
struction and manual.
State Government Works.
The Public Works Department has
recently accepted tenders for the con'
struction of eleven new High Schools
and seven new Technical Schools, de'
signed to alleviate the severe school
accommodation problems of the State.
In several cases this movement follow'
ed much agitation by local persons in
the last few years. The construction
of the buildings is to be of concrete
veneered timber frame. Separate con'
tracts were also let for the electrical
installation, and the warm air heat'
ingwentilating system in each. Con'
tracts let to date for the High Schools
total £382,814, and £412,557 for the
Technical Schools.
The Commonwealth Department of
Works’ contract for supply and instal'
lation of air'conditioning plant at the
Virus Laboratory Building, Broad'
meadows, went to H. W. Creek and
Sons, of Box Hill, for £4084; and
the electrical installation in the auto'
matic telephone exchange at North
Melbourne was contracted by John
Glaty, Hawthorn, for £l,OOO.
A three'acre block of land at Ker'
ang has been selected as the site for
a proposed swimming pool of Olympic
standard and size. The finance is to
be helped by an application to be
made to the Public Works Department
for a grant of £4,500.
An enclosed Olympic- Pool for the
1956 Olympic Games has been re'
commended to the State Government
and, subject to approval, specifications
will be drawn up immediately and
tenders will be called for the works,
which are estimated to be about
£300,000.
Building Finance.
The Department of Health has ap'
proved the grant of a £2,250 loan on
a £2 for £l basis, for the erection of
an infant welfare centre at Thomson,
a suburb of Geelong. Camberwell
City Council has provided for the
sum of £3,300 in its proposed loan
schedule for the purchase of land in

Two of this series (top left and bottom right) are wide plans that would require a site somewhat
larger than the usual and embrace three bedrooms each, as well as spacious living area. The
remaining pair (top right and bottom left) are more modest in size and contain two bedrooms and
Jiving room together with the usual services of kitchen, bathroom and laundry. All the roofs are
pitched and rely upon simple gable treatment for their appeal.

Housing Commission Extends
Ita Controls.
A recent bill introduced in the Leg'
islative Assembly will give the Hous'
ing Commission wide powers to ac'
quire land and erect shops, churches,
and other buildings. Though it may
make slum land acquisition more ex'
peditious, it is questionable whether
the powers of erecting buildings other
than homes should be extended.
About sixty per cent, of the flats
being constructed in the North Meh
bourne slum clearance estate of the
Housing Commission are completed
and have persons dwelling in them.
This scheme was designed to remove
the substandard dwellings and re-
house practically all the occupants in
threestorey brick flats, which are of
unusually good quality of design.
Current works under the supervision
of • the Chief Architect of the Meh
bourne City Council now nearing
completion are generally of a small
nature. Extensions are being made
to the city creche.
The City Engineer’s Department
has let a tender to Melbourne Tractor
Company for the construction of a
cycle track at Royal Park, involving
earthworks totalling about 40,000 cub.
yds. In providing new tram safety
zone constructions throughout the city,
a special problem was encountered in
front of the Town Hall. The large
deflector block, light and railings in
this case are being made removable
to allow for marches and processions
which take place.

GERMAN SCHOOL DESIGN.
The new designs of German schools make
the best use possible of existing mater-
ials, as can be seen in the entrance to
the modern Berblinger school. The
design is notable for many new features,
including the extraordinary timber sup-
ports on slender I section of metal at
the verandah floor level. The photo
shows the school entrance with a charac-
teristic sun protection awning. Culti-
vated garden plots instead of dusty
school yards are Innovations.

A private members' bill introduced
in the Legislative Council late last
month by Mr. I. Swinburne, a former
Minister for Housing, seeks represent-
ation for architects and master build-
ers on the Building Regulations Com-
mittee. The amendment was designed
to simplify building construction and
reduce costs without lowering stand'
ards. The amendment also provided
for the period in which public bodies
and municipalities could consider pro-
posed amendments to be reduced from
three months to two months. The
subsequent action on 30th September
of the proposed appointment of a Par'
liamentary Select Committee to in'
vestigate the Uniform Building RegU'
lations and the composition of the
Building Regulations Committee was
readily approved by architects and
builders, and conditionally approved
by the Municipal Association.
LIGHTS FOR PILGRIMS.
Mr. L. E. A. Phillips, chief lighting
designer of a British electrical com'
pany, has created a masterpiece he
will never see. He has iust designed
wonderful floodlighting, including
fluorescent lighting, soft colours and
vivid silhouettes, for the Grand
Mosque in Mecca.
Because only Moslems are allowed
in the city, Mr. Phillips can never go
there. To plan his masterpiece—-in'
eluding the lighting of seven minarets
—he flew to the Red Sea port of
Jeddah and sent out Moslem agents
with tape measures and cameras. They
returned with enough data to give
him a basis for his colossal task.
About 200 kilowatts—enough for
a village of more than 100 houses —
will be used in the lighting scheme
which was switched on for this year’s
Mecca pilgrimage.
THE SPANISH STYLE.
Generous arches to cool cloisters are a
delightful feature of the Spanish style
of architecture that still finds great fa-
vour in hot, glary climates. This large
home has a swimming pool in the fore-
ground and is set in a beautiful garden.

Book Review:
DECORATIVE ART, 1953-54:
The Studio Year Book of
Furnishing and Decoration.
About fifty years ago M. Henri
Van der Velde, one of the Continental
pioneers of “Art Nouveau,” said: “In
assuring you that we can make our
homes the direct reflection of our
wishes, our own tastes, if we will but
choose, I know the answer you are
going to give me is that it is impos-
sible. It is only impossible so long
as we go on resigning ourselves to
the repression of our own personal-
ities and accept the human environ-
ment imposed on us with the same
mute submissiveness as dogs do their
kennels and horses their stables. And
this is simplv because of the unreason-
ing belief that very few people are
born with the gift of self-expression—
which is not true and could only be
true if civilisation had deprived us of
a capacity even our primeval ances-
tors possessed.
Van der Velde’s statement, says J.
C. Pritchard, in his introduction to an
article on raising the standard of fur-
niture, can stand as an indictment of
ourselves today. But how are we to
provide the conditions that will give
ordinary people that confident ability
to choose? And how can the furni-
ture manufacturer get a proper under-
standing of the various needs and
wishes of the people?
After a lengthy analysis of the
problem and the various factors involv-
ed he concludes with the opinion
that “A tradition of design, based on
our present conditions and require-
ments, will arise when people think
that design matters and are ready to
study the subiect so that they know
how to get what they want. The
sooner this is done the sooner will
Britain once again lead the world in
providing a fine, civilised domestic
scene. But this time it will be for all
the people, not only for the few.”
The book as is usual is splendidly
produced and contains 130 pages of
excellent reproductions on art paper.
Those in colour are of much greater
value in a sphere such as decoration;
also, some of the black and white in-
teriors would have been improved had
they been a little larger. The sections
devoted to pottery and glass (Swedish,
Dutch, Finnish) are very attractive and
emphasise the present-day concentra-
tion on the asymmetrical in shape and
the accidental in affect. The scope
varies from a studio in Japan, a house
in Norfolk, a New York apartment, a
Pretorian farmhouse to a caravan.

STATE ELECTRICITY
COMMISSION OF W.A.
Annual Report of Operations.
The business of the State Electricity
Commission of Western Australia is
now an immense one, having an an'
nual revenue of approximately
£5,000,000, states the Annual Report.
The Commission’s undertaking is
rapidly expanding. South Fremantle
Power Station is making good pro'
gress, a contract has been let for the
first section of a new power station
at Bunbury, and the South-West
Power Scheme is progressing very
satisfactorily. The Commission is
making full provision in its planning
for greatly accelerated industrial de-
velopment and increase of population
in the State.
One of the most pleasing features
of the year’s work has been the help
and advice given by the Commission
to country electricity authority. As a
service, the Commission provides tech-
nical and financial advice to country
electricity undertakings and author-
ities. The area covered is from Derby
in the north to Esperance in the
south.
Frequency Change.
The frequency change-over to 50
cycles has proceeded smoothly, and,
by the end of the year, 38,447 in the
metropolitan area had been changed.
The main job was changing over the
whole area supplied by the Fremantle
Municipal Tramways Board.
During the year a total of units
(kWh) purchased were 306,261,550,
an increase of 24,976,820 over 1952.
Units sold (kWh) totalled 266,637,'
579, an increase of 24,899,861 over
1952. At June 30, 1953, there were
99,481 metres in use, including
11,253 subsidiary meters. The total
number of street and park lamps in
operation was 16,775.
In September, 1939, the basic wage
(male) was <£4/1/0. Men then work'
ed 44 hours for it and were perfectly
happy. Now it is £l2/3/0, exactly
three times as much in 14 years. They
work 40 hours for it and are far from
happy.

of the 19th century must be abolished
in the 20th century and the commun-
ity must take over risks, responsibilities
and technical planning.
Tracing the development of archi-
tecture in this century he says the
struggle between pomp and circum-
stance on the one hand, and the un-
pretentious and efficient on the other,
is the cause of never-ending controv-
ersy. If a new architecture was to
come into being it must be one that
could solve modern problems better
than traditional architecture had suc-
ceeded in doing, and between the two
world wars a start was made in this
direction.
He finishes on the following para-
graph—
“ During the war the scarcity of all
kinds of material forced many coun-
tries into more conservative building
methods, employing brick and timber
where, before the war, concrete and
steel had been used. In many places,
too, architects have lacked the imagin-
ation to take advantage of the free-
dom Functionalism provided and,
fearing simplicity, have returned to a
more traditional building method and
all the expedients of the past. But in
the long run modern civilisation will
create so many building problems
which cannot be solved by the heavy,
representative architecture of the past,
that architects will be forced to learn
to use the freedom Functionalism has
proclaimed.’’
This is altogether a most interesting
book which can be read with advant-
age by the student of town planning,
the architect or the general reader,
for it gives many an insight into the
life and character of the peoples of
the world as expressed in their homes
and cities. Originally written in Dan-
ish. the first English edition was pub-
lished in 1951.

N.Z. BUILDING CONTRACTS.
* The difficulties that a former N.Z.
law could cause builders have been
eased. This law compelled an owner
:o hold back 25% of the contract
price for 31 days after the completion
of the contract, to meet any possible
claims for liens by workmen or sub'
contractors.
The percentage to be retained has
been reduced to ten per cent, on con'
tracts up to £lOO,OOO and five on
anything over that sum.
The alteration of the law eases the
worries of the owner and lessens the
load for the builder.

Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modern school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and Hilcon lightweight precast reinforced
concrete Roof, Floor and Wall units.
All Presweld Components are permanently rust-
proofed by the hot dip galvanizing process.

The Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. recently completed
new day and shift laboratories at their Clyde Refinery,
N.S.W. For high efficiency, simple maintenance and
dignified appearance Shell selected A.G.E. Doric
Fluorescent Lighting Units for both laboratories. The
photograph shows the flush ceiling mounting and the
inset line drawing illustrates the “in line” mounting of
the Doric 4 ft. 40 watt units.
A special feature of Doric fittings is the ease of removing
the end covers for cleaning the diffusing medium or
replacing a tube. A plastic cord prevents the end cover
from falling while the perspex bend is withdrawn.
Ask the lighting specialists at any A.G.E. Office or
Agent how Doric fittings can he applied to YOUR
needs.
