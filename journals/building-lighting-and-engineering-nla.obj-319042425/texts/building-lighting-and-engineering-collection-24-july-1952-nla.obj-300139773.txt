"United" Paint was first manufac-

Ever since that date the "United" brand has stood for
every good quality that is required in paint. Its popularity with
both trade and consumer is directly due to the "United" policy
which simply is, "The best materials and the best manufacturing
methods." "United" is truly the "Pre-tested" Paint. That is why
this paint has, over four decades, won a reputation surely
befitting its position as a foundation member of Australia's Paint

THE HELSLINKI RAILWAY STATION.
AN IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE.
The Railway Station at Helsingfors, as it was then known, was one
of the important buildings erected in 1914 just before World War
I. that directed world architectural attention upon this small country
whose architects have had such an influence upon architectural
development in the last twenty years. With the opening of the
1952 Olympic Games world attention is focussed upon the capital of
Finland. The architect was Eliel Saarinen, who subsequently, as
Professor at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, exercised such an im-
portant influence upon American architecture. He died in 1950
shortly after being awarded the R.I.B.A. Royal Gold Medal for
1950

BURDEKIN HOUSE
GEORGIAN CHARM THAT ONCE GRACED
MACQUARIE STREET, SYDNEY.
Built in 1841 Burdekin House with its Georgian simplicity and dig-
nity was one of the finest homes in Sydney for many a long year
and remained to delight the eyes of those who admired this style of
architecture until it was demolished in 1933 and St. Stephen’s
Church was erected on its site. Many lovers of old Sydney still
regret the passing of this fine old house that in spite of the depreda-
tions of white ants and other dilapidations, could have been preserv-
ed for all time as a reminder of the Sydney of the early days. The
main Drawing Room was 48ft. by 24ft., while there was also a
delightful private enclosed garden—in the London Georgian manner
—at the rear. The graceful columns were of timber, built up of
wood staves dovetailed length-ways and designed with correct
entasis. Thomas Burdekin, who built the house, was a very early
Trader, and in 1828 was chartering ships for trade, and was one of
the founders of the old firm of Holdsworth MacPherson & Co.

Expansion of Important Industry
CARPET MANUFACTURERS LIMITED, FIVE DOCK, SYDNEY.
In 1945 the firm, then known as
S. H. Buchanan 6? Cowper and later
as S. H. Buchanan & Felton, with H.
Ruskin Rowe, as Architects in Associa-
tion, were commissioned to prepare
plans for extension and additions to
plant of Carpet Manufacturers Ltd. at
Five Dock, Sydney. The permit to
carry out the work was granted by the
Department of War Organisation of
Industry, and Robert Wall 6? Sons
Pty. Ltd., Master Builders, commenced
work on the new boilerhouse and dye-
house in January, 1946.
Owing to the limitations imposed
by the Building Permit no bricks were
to be used, so the boilerhouse was de-
signed entirely as a reinforced con-
crete structure, including the walls
other than the temporary wall to the
west side, where provision for exten-
sion is provided. The dyehouse was
also designed as a reinforced concrete
structure with rigid structural steel
roof framing, the infill of the walls
being of terracotta lumber in cavity
construction cement rendered both in-
side and out.
Modern Boiler House.
The boilerhouse is 54ft. by 33ft.
6in. in plan and approximately 64ft.
high. It has been said that the boiler-
house is one of the best equipped in
Sydney. Just above flood tide level
of the adjacent bay is the ash floor,
equipped with ash discharge trolley on
rails, with a turntable, and the ash is
taken from the ash floor west over the
swamp area and dispersed as filling.
9ft. 6in. above the ash floor is the
firing floor. It has been arranged that
the boiler can be oil-fired or coal-fired.
Oil is contained in an underground
tank and fed through the blower to
the furnace or alternatively coal is dis-
charged into a receiving hopper at
road level, where it is then picked up
by a conveyor and taken to an elevated
hopper wholly constructed of rein-
forced concrete and which has a capa-
city of 80 tons. The coal is then
gravity fed by automatic shoot and
feeder to the boiler.
A feature of this building is the
roof truss construction (designed ny
E. C. Evringham Co., Engineers),
which is of reinforcing steel welded at
all joints and presenting a very light
truss both in weight and in appear-
ance.
The Dyehouse,
The dyehouse is approximately 206
feet long by 80 feet wide, which also
embraces a wash-room which is a wool
scour. The dyehouse proper, the dry-
ing room and the chemical dyestuff
stores, amenities, colour - matching
laboratory, etc., are all in the front of
the building. The foundation piers of
this building were taken to hard shale
or solid rock.
Corrosion-resistant
Construction.
The floor of the dyehouse is paved
with special 6in. x 6in. non-slip vit-
reous paving tiles with an acid-resisting
joint. During the process of dying,
boiling dye-stuff is discharged on these
tiles and much thought and research
was given to the type of floor finish
to stand up to the corrosive properties
of hot dye-stuff. The development of
this section of the building also re-
quired special attention in natural ven-
tilation and all exposed metal surfaces
had to be treated against the corrosion
of acids. The matching room had to
be located to obtain south light and
to be without interference of natural
daylight.
This building presented a problem
in disposing of the waste from the
wool scour and particularly from the
dyehouse, and to receive the discharge
a special cooling pit had to be located
in fairly close proximity to the dye'
house and still give access to the main
sewer. This pit, which is of reinforced
concrete two-thirds within the ground,
is located in the extreme north-east
corner of the site and is some 18ft.
square, 15ft. deep, with necessary
screens, pump house, etc., attached to
same.
Additions to Mill
Building.
In 1946 the Building Permit was
extended to include an additional bay
to the mill building. This bay, which
is 3 31ft. 6in. by approximately 85ft.J
and 18ft. high to truss level, was de-*
veloped with a lower floor in addition
to the main mill floor; here again
foundations were taken to the solid
shale and varied in depth from 2ft. to
over 20ft. A feature of this construc-
tion is that for the piers below the
main manufacturing floor Monier pipes
were used to obviate the necessity of
formwork for the columns, and the
pipes, which were allowed to remain,
formed an excellent finish for painting.
The main mill floor is of mushroom
slab construction and is approximately
llin. thick over spans to 30ft. by
20ft., for the floor loading required
was 1501 b. per square foot. Owing to *
the length of the building this floor j
was developed with three main expan- j
sion joints. The structure above the J

span across the width, and the main
roof being divided into eleven saw'
:tooth roofs. To the north'west corner
of this new mill structure was erected
a receiving and delivery dock de'
veloped to serve two floors. A work'
shop building some 60ft. square was
developed to the west of the mill build'
ing for both carpenter’s shop and en'
gineer’s shop.
New Cafeteria.
A new cafeteria was constructed on
the Harris Road front at the extreme
southeast end of the site. This build'
mg is constructed of brick walls from
reinforced concrete foundations with
steel roof trusses over, while above the
kitchen a caretaker’s flat has been
erected. The cafe has been developed
to seat approximately 150 and has a
fully'equipped kitchen, store rooms,
and male and female retiring rooms.
The floor -is laid as a dance floor and
this building is in constant use by the
staff for social activities, weddings,
etc. Access to the cafeteria both from
the mill building and the main build'
ing has been provided, as well as from
the street front.
Further Extensions.
After the completion of the above
buildings, H. Ruskin Rowe and G. M.
Felton, Architects in Association, were
commissioned to carry out a further
addition, No. 3 Bay, to the mill (150
feet by 78 feet 6 inches), as well es
a new amenity building to take care
of additional staff. This additional
work, which was started last Novem'

Carpet Manufacture
in Australia
A Fascinating Story.
It will be news to many that the
wool used in the manufacture of
Australian carpets comes from New
Zealand, Scotland, India and other
countries, for Australian wool has
been found to be lacking in certain
essential qualities necessary to the
making of high'dass Axminister car'
peting.
Scouring and Blending.
The wool is first scoured at the
Sydney Woollen Mills and then blend'
ing is carried out to mingle the dif'
ferent characteristics of the various
wools, which operation has the im'
portant effect of distributing the long
and short fibres equally throughout.
Teasing and carding —the latter being
an elaboration of the first process—are
then carried out which pulls the fleece
wool gradually out further and further
until it can be twisted into the final
yarn.
Spinning subsequently draws the
wool out into an even finer condition
and finally spins it into a single yarn.
The operation of twisting follows
whereby two or more yarns are twisted

A GREAT AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY COMES OF AGE
GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDENS LTD. SILVER ANNIVERSARY.
The year 1951 marked the Silver
Anniversary of General Motors in
Australia. Twenty-five years previous-
ly, in 1926, General Motors com-
menced operations in Australia when
General Motors (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. was
formed and assembly plants established
in the five mainland capital cities. In
1931. Holden’s Motor Body Builders
Ltd., of Woodville, South Australia,
was merged with General Motors
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd. and the present
Company, General Motors - Holden's
Limited, formed.
Over the years General Motors-
Holden’s Limited has made an impor-
tant contribution to the economic life
of Australia. In periods of peace it
has provided its share of the country’s
essential transport needs, while during
World War II substantial quantities of
munitions and equipment for the
Armed Services were produced.
During these twenty-five years
General Motors - Holden’s has pro-
duced nearly 500,000 motor vehicles,
and wholesale sales of all General
Motors’ products have amounted to
£275,673,000. As a culmination of
its contribution to Australian industrial
and technical development it has en-
gineered and brought to volume pro-
duction the Holden car and utility.
The Annual Report for the year
ending December 31, 1951 (copy of
which has just been received) reveals
that new car, truck and utility regis-
trations for the whole of Australia in
1951 totalled 197,069 units or 9018
vehicles less than the record registra-
tion figure achieved in the previous
year: General Motors-Holden’s Limit-
ed sold 45,505 vehicles at wholesale to
distributors and dealers, an increase of
1537 units over 1950.
10,164 Employed.
Average employment in 1951 was
10,164, and although the volume of
products produced by the Company
exceeded that of the previous year, it
was achieved with a relatively small
increase in employment because of the
substantial investment in new plant
and equipment, and higher produc-
tivity resulting from technological ad-
vancement. Toward the close of the
year, employee turnover was reduced
by a noticeable extent and this, accom-
panied by a marked reduction in ab-
senteeism, indicated greater employ-
ment stability.
Payrolls increased to a new high
level and amounted to £8,045,456.
The average annual earnings of hourly-
rate employees in 1951 reached a new

high of £737 compared with £586 in
1950, and with £241 in 1939. The
average weekly earnings of hourly-rate
employees was £14.2 compared with
£11.2 in the previous year. Average
annual earnings of all employees was
£791 and the weekly average £15.2.
“The Company,” says the Report,
“recognises that it is largely dependent
on an advancing technology for its
well-being and future growth; it is
therefore interested in inducing its em-
ployees to participate in its training
plans, which result in benefits both to
employees and* to the Company. In
addition to local training programmes,
the Company has continued its policy
of sending qualified personnel to the
General Motors Institute of Tech-
nology at Flint, Michigan, U.S.A., for
a two-year course of specialised train-
ing. At the present time eight students
are taking this course in the United
States.”
Future Prospects,
The Report continues: —
“The continued development of the
motor industry is essential to the
economic growth of Australia with
its increasing population, its vast dis-
tances, the need to encourage people
to settle on the land, the establishment
of new industries and the development
of great new national projects. Not
only must new cars and trucks be pro-
vided to make this growth possible,
but provision must also be made for
replenishing the existing stock of
motor vehicles which are rapidly be-
coming obsolete. The percentage of
motor vehicles over ten years old
registered in the Commonwealth has
increased from 34.8% in 1941 to
66.1% in 1951. Thus in 1951 there
were in use 1,016,714 vehicles over
ten years old, many of which would
have over twenty years of service.
These figures emphasise the need in
the interest of road safety and efficient
transportation for replacing a large
number of vehicles that are in use at
the present time.”
PLANNING AND CIVILISATION.
Passage from the report of the
Mississippi Valley Commission: “The
time has passed when isolated or un-
related plans are adequate to American
needs. When one strand in the inter-
woven web of our national fabric is
touched, every other strand vibrates.
Land, water and people go together.
The people cannot reach the highest
standards of well-being unless there is
the wisest use of the land and water.”

Thin Shell Concrete Roofs
THE BRYNMAWR RUBBER COMPANY.
Interesting Developments in Recent British Rubber Factory.
The Brynmawr Rubber Factory in
South Wales has probably attracted
more attention and aroused more com'
ment than any other industrial build'
ing completed in Great Britain since
the war.
The whole main building covers a
rectangular area of 325 ft. by 450 ft.
and the main production area of
77,000 square feet is covered by nine
domes, each of which covers a reel'
angular area of about 82ft. by 63ft.
and rises roughly Bft. from springing
to crown. These thin two-way curving
slabs, which for the most part are only
3in. thick, are generated by a vertical
circle 82ft. 9in. in diameter moving
on a circle 108 ft. in diameter.
Thin Shell Domes.
All nine domes are identical. They
are designed to carry a superimposed
loading of 151 b. per sq. ft., and ex-
cept for some tension across the cor-
ners, the stresses are entirely compres'
sive. Two layers of hard'drawn steel
wire of 6in. mesh and about 3lb.
weight per sq. yd., were used for the
main reinforcement, with supplement
tary %in. mild steel bars placed across
the corners.
Each dome is supported along all
its four edges by a reinforced concrete
bowstring type truss with the top
boom following the thin shell dome
curvature and the bottom boom the
horizontal. Both booms are nominally
9in. thick and are connected to each
other at regular intervals by 4in. by
2in. reinforced concrete hanger mem-
bers, precast and built in.
The open spandrel formed by these
girders is glazed and provides the main
source of natural light to the interior.
This clerestory lighting .supplemented
by 6ft. circular glass domes in the shell
roofing, gives a minimum daylight
factor at working level of 5 per cent.
Where the longer and shorter span
girders meet at the corners the main
reinforcement from each extends into
the other to form a continuous tie all
round. Except for an area at the in'
tersections where four domes meet, the
flat walk'way slabs in the valleys be-
tween the domes are cast integral with
the lower boom of the bowstring truss.
Here the construction is considered to
be sufficiently flexible in itself to ac-
commodate thermal and other move'
ment; the amount involved, which in
any case is but slight, being taken up
by relative movement between the top
and bottom booms of the girders.
However, at the intersections where
the top and bottom booms join and
trusses of opposite spans meet, struc'
tural stiffness increases, and to avoid
restriction of movement at that point,
independent cruciform'shaped areas of
walk'way are introduced. These free
areas of roofing extend about 10ft.
along the dome sides in all four direc'
tions. They are separated from the
lower boom by expansion jointing and
from the rest of the walk'way by re'
bated bearing at the end edges and
also by the horned extensions project'
ing from the bowstring girders, the
bearing here being a sliding one.
At each dome corner the roof struc'
ture receives support from a column
of rectangular cross'section set to an
inclination of about 15 degrees from
the vertical placed immediately below
the 82ft. major span girder and con'
structed to the same width. Pairs of
inclined columns supporting adjoining
domes converge towards floor level,
and below are carried on a T'sectioned
support of 7ft. flange'width and 9in.
thickness with a 12in. by 18in. rib.
The inclination of the columns is
adopted primarily to reduce obstruc-
tion of the working floor and the
direction of the slope chosen to suit
the directional flow in production.
Steel and Aluminium
Formwork.
The formwork for these large
curved concrete surfaces was made up
of aluminium alloy and steel scaffold
tubes and steel decking plates. All
nine domes were constructed with
only three sets of scaffolding and two
sets of plates.
The steel tubes, curved to radius
and supported on diagonally braced
verticals, were used to form main
trusses at approximately 6ft. centres
parallel to the short span. On these
were laid the aluminium tubes in
pairs, 4in. apart, at 2ft. from centre
to centre of pairs. The decking plates,
which were mainly 2ft. square, were
placed on these tubes and clamped to
them with ordinary scaffold clips to
prevent uplift by wind during con'
struction. The structure so formed
was supported throughout on steel jack
shores to allow for final adjustment of
curvature and to simplify the striking.
Barrel Vaulting.
Roofs to the drug and mill room
sections of the main building are of
long'spanning thin shell concrete bar'
rel vaulting, three-centred in both
cases.
In the drug room, a series of 26
vaults, each with a chord width of
12ft. 9in., makes up the total length
and spans the 44ft. 7£in. width trans'
versely. In the mill room ten vaults.
THE BRYNMAWR RUBBER FACTORY.
The Brynmawr Rubber Factory in South Wales
is said to have attracted more attention than
any building completed in Britain since the
war. In it reinforced concrete has been en-
tirely utilised in all its many forms and we
show several applications. (Top) Detail of the
pairs of raking columns which support ad-
joining thin-shell concrete domes in the main
production area. (Middle) The escape stair-
case in reinforced concrete. (Bottom) The
rampway to the entrance.
CONCRETE BARREL VAULTING.
A series of 26 barrel vaults each with a
chord width of 12ft. 9in. comprises the roof
to the drug room and spans 44ft. 7½ in.
width transversely.

each of 3€ft. chord width, make up
the length and in this case span the
63ft. 9in. width. Arch ribs projecting
downwards from the curved under-
surfaces and springing from the sup-
porting columns give the necessary
gable stiffness. In the drug room
section the thin curved shell cantilevers
2ft. 6in. beyond these ribs at each end,
and in the mill room section 4ft. 6in.
beyond, but at only one end.
Single Vault.
The thin shell roof of the south
block is of unusual design. It is a
single vault spanning 57ft. between
the supporting solid wall end frames
and cantilevering between sft. and 6ft.
beyond them at each end. Instead of
the more usual edge beam, a flat ex-
tension of the slab tilted slightly up-
wards from the springing resolves the
conditions obtaining at the vault edge.
The chord width is 37ft. 7in.; the
radius of curvature 28ft. and
the total rise 7ft. 2in. Calculations
showed that with a roof of this form
deflection, downwards and ou.wards,
would occur at both the long edges,
while at the crown the vault would
remain level from end to end of its
length. On the extreme vault edge
the expected maximum deflections
were 1.32 in. vertically and o.sin. hori-
zontally with a gradual diminishing
both ways, towards zero at the crown
zero at the supports. In construct-
ing the roof this deflection was taken
.into account and the formwork, which
was supported on adjustable steel jack
shores, was carefully cambered in an-
ticipation of the ultimate deformation.
The observed deflections were in fact
in almost exact agreement with those
calculated.
A semi-elliptical vault 4in. thick and
with a minor axis of 29ft. as base and
half the major axis of 25ft. as height,
encloses the upper story of the boiler
house, 4. Two end and four inter-
mediate ribs, each 6in. wide and pro-
jecting 10in. outwards from the curv-
ing surface, give added stiffness. The
intrados remains unbroken. Vault,
floor and hopper sides are homo-
geneous and all structurally functional,
so that beams as such become super>
fluous.
Concrete Mix.
Most of the concrete used in the
construction was a 1:2:4 mix by
volume of crushed whinstone, sand
from Newport Sand Gravel Co.
(dredged channel sand) and ordinary
Portland cement. For the thin slab
vaults and roof domes the concrete
was different, with mix proportion
about 1 : 2.2 : 3.33, in this case made
with uncrushed fin. gravel from Here'
fordshire, a coarser sand from Kidder-
minster, and rapid-hardening Portland
cement. Minimum specified strengths
for the concrete were 20001 b. at seven
days or 30001 b. at 28 days using or-
dinary Portland cement, and 30001 b.
at seven days using rapid'hardening
Portland cement.

The Late Sir Reginald Stradiing
FOUNDER OF BRITISH BUILDING RESEARCH.
The death of Sir Reginald Stradling
several months ago removed an out'
standing figure from the field of build'
ing research in Great Britain.
When in 1924 as Dr. Stradling he
was appointed Director of Building
Research, the Building Research
Station was small and hardly known
to architects and the building industry.
Realising that research was of neces'
sity a process of slow growth, he was
content to build it up over many years
until it possessed a backing of research
findings and could command respect
by the certainty of its knowledge.
Civil Defence.
Early in 1939 he turned to the then
totally unexplored field of civil de-
fence research on being appointed
Chief Adviser to the Home Office and
created the Research and Experiments
Department of the Ministry of Home
Security.
At that time practically nothing cer-
tain was known about the potential
effects of bombing on buildings, bull . -
up areas and industrial production.
Dr. Stradling collected a group of
scientists, architects, engineers and
mathematicians who became the pre-
dominant authority among the allied
nations on the effects of bombing.
Sir Reginald visited Australia several
years ago.

AIR KEY TO GUIANA’S FOREST WEALTH
ACTIVITIES OF BRITISH GUIANA AIRWAYS.
Air transport is playing an increas-
ingly important part in the develop-
ment of the economic possibilities of
the British Guiana’s 78,000 square
miles of hinterland.
Originally founded by Mr. (now
Major) Arthur James Williams, an
American aviator who owns the con-
trolling interest in the 500,000-dollar
company, British Guiana Airways
Limited have been responsible for the
unprecedented large-scale mining and
other interior developments over the
Colony’s sprawling hinterland.
Prior to the inauguration of this
service, the absence of any suitable
form of transport had greatly hinder-
ed the development of the Colony’s
land-locked natural resources. The
hinterland then was to a large extent
unknown. The only means of com-
munication were by way of four prin-
cipal rivers, including the Essequebo,
which provided cheap transportation,
but inasmuch as they are encumbered
with numerous rapids they took a
heavy toll of lives.
Development Difficulties.
In consequence of this reliance upon
river transport to the interior, several
attempts at organised mining develop-
ments have been frustrated, mining
machinery and lives have been lost in
the falls, machinery had to be aben-
doned along the river banks or along
partially-constructed roadways in the
jungle. Technical staffs and labourers
have been stranded without food in
remote forest areas.
The upshot of these drawbacks was
that mining concerns were reluctant to
undertake exploration and develop-
ment in the colony, or had become
disheartened.
But for the fortuitous coming of
coming of the British Guiana-Brazil
Boundary Commission shortly after the
arrival of Mr. Williams and his Wasp
Ireland hydroplane in the latter part
of 1934, British Guiana might have
still been depending on water com-
munication for its inland transport.
Aviation Opens Country.
An agreement guaranteed British
Guiana Airways Limited, which came
into being on October Ist, 1939, with
a modest fleet of two 450-h.p. Wasp
hydroplanes, a virtual internal air
transport monopoly and a specified
maximum annual sum for the opera-
tion of the service under the direction
of the Government.
Major Williams, who by this time
had won fame by discovering the head-
waters of the Orinocco River in 1946
and 1947, brought in two Dakotas
(C47’s), Unprecedented developments
subsequently have followed. Jeeps,
five-ton trucks, tractors and trailers and
sawmilling equipment have been flown
into the interior. Forty h.p. tractors
have been flown into the Rupununi
and driven off into the ’plane under
their own power. Between July, 1947,
and the end of 1949 about 300 miles
of motor trail and seven airstrips have
been constructed in the Rupununi
Savannahs. In April of 1947 it
would have taken two weeks to cover
the 300 miles of trail; in December
of the same year it took under twelve
hours by motorised transport.

This is an age of scientific terms

nuclear fission and cortisone.
It is therefore very important that
we should not only be able to keep
pace with this ever-expanding scientific
era, but also that we should have by
us a ready reference when we are
stumped or wish to refresh our
memories. And in this excellent new
work we have a reference library in
epitomised form, for over 10,000 scien-

An Approach to the Art of Lighting
ENGINEERS AND AESTHETICS.
By W. ALLEN SMITH.*
During the last few years we have
learned a great deal about visual re'
quirements.
H. C. Weston and Dr. Hopkinson
in Great Britain. Logan in the U.S.A.
and many others have given us the
technical knowledge which enables an
interior lighting system to be designed
fulfilling all the requirements of visual
comfort and efficiency whether light'
ing fittings have been designed which
provide the correct distribution with
the correct cut'off angles and surface
brightness. Nevertheless, in both
Britain and America the published
literature on lighting has indicated a
general uneasiness that despite the
knowledge we have of the technique
of lighting, the general application of
lighting practice leaves much to be
desired, and even those workers who
have been in the forefront of research
have begun to question the direction
in which the (lighting profession is
travelling.
The lighting industry is at the
moment confronted by two problems.
It has at its disposal world'wide re'
search into visual requirements and
because of its specialist character is
alone in a position to interpret these
requirements and to translate them in-
to practical lighting systems, but at the
same time there is the general feeling
that the specialists in the industry have
not been wholly accepted by the com'
munity they seek to serve, nor by the
professions with whom they should be
allied. Too often they are considered
to be superior salesmen of lighting fit'
tings rather than experts in a particular
field. The user of light seems indiT
ferent to his own visual need and ap'
pears unaware that lighting is part of
his environment and should be in
harmony with the activity associated
with it.
The lighting profession itself must
bear part at least of the responsibility
for this lack of recognition. There
has been too great a preoccupation
with the engineering as opposed to the
aesthetic aspect of lighting, a toleration
of the general low level of design of
lighting fittings, and a general in'
feriority complex engendered by the
economic necessity for the majority of
lighting specialists being tied to a
competitive fittings industry in which
cost has counted for more than design
merit. It must by its own efforts win
the respect of the allied professions of
architecture and interior decoration,
and by adopting a responsible attitude
towards its function educate the user
to a correct appreciation of good light'
ing practice.
The Design of Fittings.
Taking the question of fittings dc'
sign first, a note of warning was sound'
ed by Dr. Hopkinson in his article or
Lighting Research at the Building
Research Station in England (“Light
and Lighting,” January, 1951), when
he stated that “Work on the design of
lighting fittings arose out of the need
expressed by many contemporary archi'
tects that some type of unit for fiuores'
cent lighting was needed, more simple
in design than those generally avail'
able,” a gentle way of saying that bits
of scroll work, engraved motifs on
glass and fancy shapes which cannot
be kept clean are not the acme of
good design.
In Great Britain designers never
reached the excesses which charac'
terised the earlier fittings which were
produced in the United States, but in
Australia design has yet to reach that
stage of elegance and simplicity which
makes them acceptable as an har'
monious entity with an interior. A
lighting fitting has become mainly a
casing for a lamp, whereas it should
have design in its own right as well as
being optically and functionally cor'
rect. When it comes to industrial
lighting the designer’s attitude seems
to be that as long as a fitting does not
have to pretend to be decorative then
a piece of U-shaped metal with a
couple of end plates is a good enough
housing for a lamp.
This criticism does not apply to the
industry as a whole; there are some
manufacturers who employ qualified
industrial designers and their products,
even the frankly industrial have some
merit, but the general low standard
does nothing to create respect for a
lighting engineer who is forced to
design a lighting system round some
of the more absurd lighting fittings.
The answer might be to have in
Australia a Council of Industrial Do'
sign which would certify lighting fit'
tings; an even better be for
those lighting engineers who have to
work with consistently bad design to
mutiny and to insist on standards in
accordance with the best principles of
industrial design and contemporary re'
search.
Lighting Is Art
As Well As Science.
The poorness of the design of the
majority of lighting fittings may be
one of the reasons why the Architect
fights shy of seeking the collaboration
of the lighting engineer, the other
reason is possibly the insistence of the
term “engineering.” We talk of
“Lighting Engineering” and “Bright'
ness Engineering,” the emphasis is on
measurement and calculation, the im-
position of a set of rules upon an en'
vironment. No method of design can
be called scientific unless it is capable
of measurement, “engineering” im-
plies the prediction of results and the
translation of theoretical calculations
into practical fact. But in lighting it
is this attempt to reduce subjective
sensations to precise mathematical for'
mulae and the insistence upon the

engineering aspect of lighting which
has engendered this feeling that the
lighting profession is fast forgetting
that lighting is an art as well as a
science.
Value of Collaboration.
The lighting engineer is at his best
when he is collaborating directly with
-the architect in the design for a new
building or the reconstruction of an
old one, but the amount of collabora-
tion is small. In many cases the
architect creates his own scheme, often
his ideas are impracticable or the
equipment he wants may have to re-
sult in weeks of special design work
carried out by a number of firms from
whom he will call tenders; it is not
feasible that he will have had the time
to read all the papers which have been
published on researches into lighting
so that it is quite possible that his
ultimate installations cuts right across
what is good contemporary practice.
On the other hand the lighting en-
gineer may be called upon to design
a lighting system on his own; he de-
signs in accordance with the rules as
regards brightness and illumination
levels and produces what well might
be a perfect textbook scheme. How-
ever. as an engineer the result will be
at best a well-engineered job lacking
in artistic merit, so neither result jS
entirely satisfactory.
This adds up to the fact that the
training of the lighting engineer
should be more broadly based. At the
present time a man having completed
a lighting engineering course is cer-
tainly a specialist in the mechanics of
light, and during the course of his
studies he will have acquired practical
experience in a design office, but un-
less he is fortunate he will have had
little opportunity to acquire a know-
ledge of decoration and aesthetics.
After his course he will be able to
produce a competent lighting installa-
tion, but his training will have been
too circumscribed for him to be able
to analyse the function of an interior
and to relate the lighting system to
the decorative and furnishing scheme
as well as to the task, visualising the
end result before he puts pencil to
paper.
We can go a long way toward
remedying this state of affairs either
by a modification of the existing Tech-
nical College course, or by enlarging
its scope. It does seem desirable
somewhere to include a course in in-
terior decorating or basic architecture,
one or two years could be devoted to
this, after the completion of the light-
ing engineering course. It is only
with this background that the en-
gineering rules can be applied intel-
ligently to a human environment and
the thoughtful use of lighting equip-
ment, colour and brightness applied
successfully to an interior so that it
becomes an harmonious entity rather
than a machine for living in. With
this wider knowledge the lighting en-
gineer will neither compete with nor
usurp the function of the architect or
the interior decorator, but he will
have a better understanding of the
work of both and in the long run will
provide a much more valuable con-
tribution to the work of both.
For all the scientific research that is
carried out, lighting will always remain
more of an art than a science, it has
such an enormous effect on the human
environment. It is reasonable to con-
sider that the engineering aspect of
lighting will be paramount in those
interiors in which the occupants rely
for their physical well-being and
efficiency on comfortable seeing: there
is less danger in designing to a fixed
set of rules when it is applied to
factories, offices and schools than to
more intimate surroundings. Comfort-
able seeing is also required in the
home, restaurant and so forth; never-
theless, in such places scientific rules
are of less importance than artistry and
harmony. If this is remembered the
lighting specialist will become less ob-
sessed with the tools of engineering.
Lighting engineering is no more
than good lighting practice under the
guidance of rules as well as experience,
but correct environmental lighting re
quires something else - an artistic
sense of fitness.
Commemorating Famous Architects’ Work
AMERICAN STAMP PROPOSAL.
Mr. Elliott L. Chisling, a New York
architect, recently wrote to the Ameri-
can version of the P.M.G. suggesting
that the work of famous American
architects be commemorated in special
stamps.
The reply, a typical bureaucratic
effort, left little doubt as to the result
of the request: —
“Dear Mr. Chisling:
The Department wishes to thank
you for your letter of January 14th,
in which you suggest that a set of
five commemorative stamps be is-
sued in honour of the five most
famous architects, and which are
now deceased.
The Department has on file
several hundred applications for
stamps to commemorate important
national events and to honour
famous persons. Of necessity, the
stamp programme has been limited
to approximately twelve stamps
yearly, which has made it impos-
sible to seriously consider all the
applications on file.
This Office sincerely appreciates
the magnificent work performed by
the architects of this country, but
in view of the above facts it is
necessary to retain your application
in the files of the Department for
future possible use.
Sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) OSBORNE A. PEARSON,
Assistant Posmaster-General.”
—“Journal of the American Institute
of Architects.”
AN ATTRACTIVE FITTING.
The elongated shape of the conventional fluor-
escent fitting is not always suitable. This
unit which uses eight, two foot, twenty watt
lamps and is 34” square, the sides and bottom
panel being of flashed opal glass.
THE RIBBON OF LIGHT.
The long narrow ribbon of light admirably
suits the long narrow room. The fittings
used are typical of the English design of
enclosed diffusing units.

All-Time Records.
Number: 17,095. Cost: £46,118,991.
The returns prepared by the
N.S.W. Metropolitan Water, Sewer'
age and Drainage Board for the
twelve months ending 30th June, 1952,
reveal that in this period the record
number of 17,095 jobs were complet'
ed at a cost of <£46,118,991.
The number of new buildings com'
pleted was 15,205, the cost thereof
being <£41,762,928, whilst alterations
and additions were carried out to
1,890 existing structures at a cost of
£4,356,063. In all 17,095 jobs were
completed at a cost of £46,118,991.
Both these totals represent a new re'
cord in their respective fields, the pre'
vious highest figures being establish'
ed for the twelve months ended 31st
December, 1951, when 15,540 build'
ings were completed for £37,390,399.
The number of buildings complet'
ed represents an increase of 22% over
the previous corresponding twelve
months when 14,055 jobs were com'
pleted, whilst the cost shows an in'
crease of 35% over the previous fig'
ure of £34,166.648. The average cost
per job was £2,698, which compares
with £2,431, £1,999 and £1,732 for
the years 1951. 1950, and 1949. Thus,
over the past three years the average
cost has increased by 56%.
15,806 Homes Completed.
The erection of homes still continues
to dominate activities, 15,806 having
been erected or altered during the
year, representing 92% of the total
buildings completed. For the three
previous years the figures under this
category were 12,954, 12,789, and
13,669, the respective percentage of
the yearly total being 92, 94, and 93.
The dwellings erected by the Hous'
ing Commission of N.S.W. make a
substantial contribution to the total
homes provided. 2,485 cottages and
40 blocks of flats comprising 387
units erected by this Authority hav'
ing been rated by the Board.
Although the number of buildings
completed for the year is an alhtime
high, this may be due in some meas'
ure to more men and materials being
available and thus allowing for speed'
ier completion of buildings rather
than as an indication that the number
of buildings proposed to be erected
is continuing on an upward scale.
The presentation to the Board of plans
of buildings and the payment of a
building fee to secure a water service
to the site is an indication, in normal
times, that early commencement of
building operations is contemplated.
Downward Movement.
1 he downward movement noted in
these fees from September, 1951,
when the effect of credit restrictions
became apparent, is still continuing.
However, there is a great number of
outstanding building fees indicating
that the buildings for which they were
paid are still not completed or per'
haps not even commenced and a de'
c ]i ne in the number of buildings erect'
ed may therefore not be evident urn

Piassava Keeps Our Cities Clean
A LINK BETWEEN AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA.
The everyday connection between
the big cities of the western world
and the low, swampy southern coast'
line of Sierra Leone can best be shown
through the story of Momo Metzger.
Momo is the headman of Bumbe vih
lage and he has been responsible for
the production of quite -a lot of pias'
sava in his time. But like most
Africans, he has very little idea what
uses are made of it and, as long as
prices remain satisfactory, he doesn t
really care. He is more concerned
with building a road to his village so
that lorries can come to get his pro'
duce instead of his people having to
carry it some 15 miles by head loads,
for Bumbe is a village where no
vehicle has yet penetrated—and no'
one in the village even has a bicycle.
Primitive Methods.
The village itself is a particularly
fine one, for once it was the capital
town of the Perie Chiefdom until the
Chief moved out to a more accessible
place. With any luck and a good
road, Momo reckons the Chief might
be persuaded to come back again,
which would be a good thing for
everybody. The houses of the village
are an assortment of round and square
types, each carefully thatched and with
a smooth finish, which is a credit to
the home'made tools with which the
job was done. Even the matchets
used to cut the piassava from the
raphia palms in the swamps are home'
made, fashioned from any bit of old
iron by the village blacksmiths, who,
by tradition, work a profitable sideline
in medicines.
When Momo wants the streets ot
his village swept, which is whenever
he is expecting visitors, he does not
use piassava brooms —‘ bass brooms,
as the trade calls them. The Bumbe
folk use other fibres and the piassava
is sent overseas, some £250,000’s worth
of its every year from Sierra Leone.
Important Industry.
The first export of piassava was in
1892, since when it has grown to be
an important industry for the territory.
For nearly 25 years the Government
has run a system of inspection and
instruction in the preparation of pias'
sava which, during 1949, found its
way in quantity to the United King'
dom, the U.S.A., Germany, South
Africa. France, Belgium, Denmark,
Australia, Southern Rhodesia, the
Netherlands and Canada.
To the brush'making trade piassava
is “African Bass,” and it is used for
making every sort of strong broom
and brush. The mechanical brooms
used in the streets of London, the
scrubbing brush in an Oslo scullery,
the best of them are made from pias'
sava from the remote villages of the
swampy south of Sierra Leone. Smaller
quantities even find their way into
mills, where they are used in the re'
moval of air bubbles from steel cast'
ings.
Though Momo cannot really say
how old he is, from what he remem'
bers he is just about as old as the
piassava industry. It is unlikely that
he will ever see a steel foundry and
he may never even see a yard'broom
of the type we favour. But the sale of
piassava is doing well and his village is
prosperous—what more could he wish
for?
What Is Architecture?
MANY DEFINITIONS.
The late Charles H. Whitaker,
former Editor of the Journal of the
American Institute of Architects, re'
cords in an article published before his
death his search for a precise and
satisfying definition of architecture.
Here are a few.
1. Ruskin: “Architecture is the art
which so disposes and adorns the
edifices raised by man . . . that
the sight of them contributes to
mental health, power and
pleasure.”
2. Young Modern Architect:
“Architecture is the integration
of the component parts of a
structure into a functional whole
which fulfills the needs of the
humans for whose use it is in'
tended.”
3. “Architecture is the expression
of a civilisation through the
medium of building.”
4. “Architecture is the wise use of
land.”

has done much to help these re-
mote villages improve production

House Prefabrication Does Not Reduce Costs
BUILDING RESEARCH CHIEF'S OPINION.
Mr. lan Langlands, M.Mech.E.,
8.E.E., M.l.E.Aust., Chief of the Divi-
sion of Building Research, C.5.1.R.0..
Melbourne, in a recent address as re-
tiring Chairman to the Melbourne
Division of the Institution of En-
gineers, Australia, expressed dis-
appointment at the results achieved by
house prefabrication.
“Prefabrication of components or of
complete buildings,” he said, “appears
at first sight to be the answer to the
problem of applying modern industrial
technique to building, thus greatly re-
ducing costs. However, so far as costs
are concerned, results have been diV
. appointing and in practice it has been
found that complete fabrication at be<t
results in little or no saving of costs
an d may even be considerably more
expensive than traditional construe'
tion.
“There are a number of reasons,
but the principal one is the very great
increase in overhead costs which at
least cancels out the savings in site
labour. It may be said that this is
because of inadequate production or
of inefficient design or
but perhaps the best answer to this is
to quote examples.
The Lustron house in America was
an attractive, prefabricated steel house
that was assembled on the building
site from parts completely fabricated
in the factory. It was designed by
capable engineers specially for mass
production, and some of the best pro-
duction men in America were engaged
to design and manage the factory.
Project Abandoned.
“The project, which aimed at pro-
ducing 40,000 houses a year, appeared
so promising that the U.S. Govern-
ment backed it to the extent of
37,500,000 dollars. In spite of all
this it became evident before the
factory was in full production that the
project would not succeed and the
company went into liquidation in 1950. ]
“In England, the factory-assembled
Airoh aluminium house was construct-
ed after the war by the British aircraft
factories on a truly mass production
basis. However, it was excessively
costly and had to be abandoned when
Government subsidies were with-
drawn.”
From Australian experience, though |
admittedly on a much smaller scale, it ;
was evident that complete prefabrica-
tion does not reduce costs.
Prefabs, 4% of Total.
It is now generally agreed that com-
plete prefabrication is unlikely to play
any great part in the production of i
houses in the foreseeable future, but
that it will retain a small place, espe-
cially when conditions are unusual, for
example, when there is a scarcity of i
site labour and when it is necessary
to make use of alternative materials.
In U.S.A. the proportion of prefab- _■
ricated houses has remained steady for |
some years at about 4 per cent, of I
the total houses built, and this figure
is not likely to alter very much.
On the credit side it can be said ;
that a good deal has been learnt by
builders on the subject of planning I
and organisation of work and the ap-
plication of basic principles of mass I
production to site work which should j
have a beneficial affect on building I
costs.
It is considered that the factory pro- |
duction of components may continue j
to increase.
BANK LIGHTING.
DUTCH. AMERICAN AND BRAZILLIAN EXAMPLES.
The lighting of a bank differs from that of an ordinary office in that besides providing room
for administrative purposes, it must also be a reception hall for clients. Illustrated are several
representative examples. (Top left) Bank in Aarhus, Denmark, using indirect lighting by means
of fluorescent tubular lamps in narrow cornices under the ceiling, and direct lighting by means
of a continuous cove just above the counters. (Bottom left) Main hall in the Rotterdam Bank
using all-metal commercial fittings with three 40W tubular lamps. (Top right) Bank of
America, San Francisco, which is an old style building in which the lighting has been modern-
ised. Each panel of the ceiling contains nine incandescent 200W lamps in suspended reflect-
ors. (Middle right) Hall of the National Bank of Cleveland which employs general diffused
lighting by means of continuous rows of warm-white fluorescent lamps mounted above a
louvred aluminium ceiling with additional downlights over the counters. (Bottom right)
Banco Paulista do Comencio in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which has ceiling panels fitted with eight
tubular 40W lamps in color “white and daylight”.

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust.- N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday,
the 3rd July, 1952, at 7.30 p.m., this meeting being held jointly with The
Institute of Optometrists of N.S.W.
The President, Mr. E. L. Freedman,
and 69 members and visitors were
present, apologies being received from
Messrs. Whiddon, Kearney, Watson
and Hyatt.
The President extended a warm
welcome to Mr. L. H. Harvey, the
President of The Institute of Optomet'
rists of N.S.W., and to the 23 mem'
bers of his Institute present.
Minutes of General Meeting held on
sth June. 1952, were taken as read
and confirmed.
Membership.
It was reported from Council that
the following had been admitted as
Associate Members: —W. L. Keage,
Joynton Ave., Waterloo; Miss W.
Wilmanska, 499 Elizabeth St., Sydney;
K. S. Mitchell, C/o W. E. Bassett &
Associates, 16 Barrack St., Sydney.
Health Week Exhibit.
The President informed the meeting
that, owing to the generosity of some
of the Sustaining Members in assisting
with the necessary finance, the Society
has accepted an invitation to stage an
exhibit at the Health Week Exhibition
to be held in October, 1952.
Resignation of Senior
Vice-President.
It was with great regret that the
President informed the meeting that
Mr. T. S. Crouch had tendered his
resignation as Senior Vice' President
and a member of Council owing to ill'
health. He also reported that Mr. A.
E. Deegan had been co-opted to
Council and that Mr. G. C. T. Brown
had been appointed Convenor of the
Papers and Meetings Committee.
Subject ©f the Evening.
A Paper entitled “Visual Per-
formance” was read by Mr. J. Lederer,
B.Sc., A.S.T.C., an affiliate member of
the 1.E.5., but representing the 1.0.0.
on this occasion. Mr. Lederer careful'
ly analysed the terms of Visual Per-
formance, Visual Fatigue, and Ease of
Seeing. He particularly stressed the
necessity of taking the “Total Light'
ing Situation” into account when
evaluating visual performance and
visual fatigue. He submitled and de-
monstrated a test arrangement which
could lead to satisfactory and valid
test results, and recommended this
test for future research in the labora-
tory as well as in field work.
Discussion.
Following the talk given by Mr.
Lederer, a keen discussion took place,
being entered into by both Optomet'
rists and Lighting Engineers in the
audience. The spinning discs used
by Mr. Lederer were the centre of
many questions. “Could these be used
as a medium of obtaining desired levels
of illumination required by any per'
son?” “Would colour have any effect
on the tests taken from this instru'
ment?” “When used with fluorescent
tubes, would stroboscopic trouble be
encountered?”
These questions, along with many
others, were quickly and clearly dealt
with by the lecturer, who explained
that the spinning disc had not been
used in any lighting tests to his know'
ledge, but there was no reason why it
could not be used in the lighting
field, but that it had been used widely
by optometrists for various eye tests.
Asked wether different illumination
would be required for various people,
Mr. Lederer stated that all people of
all age groups who had 100% visual
performance should be able to see the
five rings of the spinning discs. He
also stated that the tests should be ap-
plicable under all kinds of light
sources. He did not think the disc
would be affected by the stroboscopic
effect from fluorescent sources.
It was stated if might be desirable
that lighting installations be checked
at regular intervals with the help of
the spinning disc to ascertain any de'
terioration in the lighting situation,
similarly as eyes are checked by the
optometrist to prevent and recognise
undue deterioration of eyesight.
Vote of Thanks.
Mr. R. O. Phillips in moving and
Mr. A. E. Deegan in seconding a vote
of thanks expressed the opinion that
Mr. Lederer had materially contributed
towards the solution of the problems
of visual performance and visual
fatigue. Mr. Lederer had given Light'
ing Engineers and Optometrists a new
working basis, and it was hoped that
further research on the lines suggest'
ed by Mr. Lederer would lead to
tangible results, valuable for both pro'
fessions.
Mr. L. H. Harvey expressed the
thanks of the members of his Institute
for a most congenial evening. He
particularly mentioned the cordial and
friendly relations which existed be'
tween the two professions. He in-
vited members of the I.E.S. to the
forthcoming meeting of his Institute
on July 23rd, when Mr. H. F. Pollard,
of the Physics Department of the
Sydney University of Technology,
would present a Paper entitled “Photo-
metric Instruments.”
The President, Mr. E. L. Freedman,
in conclusion, stated that most light'
ing problems appeared to him to be
in fact lighting solutions of seeing
problems, and that these solutions can
be best obtained by cooperation by
the two professions. He hoped that
many more joint meetings of the two
Institutes might follow this present
one.
Next Meeting.
The next meeting of the Society
will be held on Thursday, 7th August,
1952, the subject of the evening being
“Lighting Developments Overseas.”
Speakers: Messrs. P. J. Grundfest, S.
Jeffery and W. A. Smith.
A DISQUIETING INTERIOR.
The interior of the new Church at Lans-
bury, London, reveals austerity and restless-
ness tow hich the combination of pendant
light fittings and the rows of bulls-eye ceil-
ing panels largely contribute. The unadorned
plainness seems to have gone a little further
even than the Congregational character of the
Church demanded and if it were not for thin
extenuated cross at one end, it could easily
be mistaken for the school hall.

VISVAL PERFORMANCE
By J. LEDERER,
B.Sc., A.S.T.C., F. 1.0. ’
Resume of Paper delivered before The Illuminating Engineering Society of
Australia, N.S.W., July 3rd, 1952.
The term and concept “Visual per-
formance” are frequently used by
Illuminating Engineers and Industrial
Psychologists in connection with the
effects of various external conditions,
e.g., brightness levels, on the efficiency
of visual perception. Since changes
in illumination affect the individual
primarily by their effects on the visual
sense, the contention of “better light,
better sight,” requires that the im-
provement in “sight” resulting from
“better light” be subjected to experi-
mental verification and measurement.
As it is recognised that visual acuity
forms only a part of the total process
of visual perception, visual perform-
ance is considered to const:tu e a more
suitable criterion.
On the other hand, the term visual
performance is not found in Optomet-
rical literature, because to the Op-
tometrist it has neither clinical sig-
nificance nor any definite theoretical
or practical meaning.
What then is visual performance
and how can it be defined and
measured?
With reference to this question I
was very interested to read the report
by J. S. Johnson on the proposed re-
vision of the S.A.A. Lighting Code
in “Building and Engineering,”
October, 1951. It appears that some
of the recommendations are based on
the work of H. C, Weston in Eng-
land. and for the present purpose the
following passages are relevant:—
“The recommended illumination for
each task should be based on a
visual performance of 90%.”
“Visual performance is taken as the
reciprocal of the nett average dis-
crimination time per ring divided
by the number of rings marked
accurately over the total rings.”
Landolt’s broken rings of “task size
I” are used as targets and a figure is
presented which plots illumination
against per cent, maximum visual per-
formance. Another figure shows the
decline of visual performances with in-
creasing age and “Here again the
Landolt's broken rings were the test
objects, size 1.5', contrast black on
\yhite.” The code is to be based on
the 30-40 age group and the task
classification is related to prints of
different size at a distance of 12ins.
from the eyes. The choice of 12ins.
for standard distance is questionable,
since the average reading distance is
16ins. and most close work is per-
formed at even larger distances. I also
noticed that Optometry is not repre-
sented on the Committee on Interior
Illumination of Buildings, although I
feel certain that Optometrists could
make valuable contributions.
Brozek and Simonson in a recent
study on “Visual Performance and
Fatigue” have chosen as “visual work”
the recognition of small moving de-
tails briefly exposed to view as repre'
senting a schematic miniature of the
industrial inspection of objects trans-
ported on a conveyor. Letters of 10ft.
visual angle were presented for two-
hour periods and the results statistical'
ly analysed on the basis of six minutes'
work samples of 200 letters. Six sub-
jects were used who were seated in
individual booths and had to copy the
letters without looking down and with
their head fixed in position. The
authors stress the advantages of labora-
tory over field situations and employed
six levels of illumination (2, 5, 15,
50, 100, 300 ft/candles) as well as
three illuminants of different quality.
Analysis of the results indicated an
optimum work rate and least perform-
ance decrement at 100 ft. candles and
significant difference between the illu-
minants used were also obtained.
These and similar definitions of
visual performance are open to a large
number of criticisms:—
(a) If a standard is to be based on
90% visual performance, just
what constitutes 100% visual
performance? Is it to be de-
fined as “all correct in a mini-
mum time” or as the maximum
performance of which the in-
dividual observer is capable? If
the latter, how is this to be
determined?
(b) The number of subjects used in
these experiments is of neces-
sity too small and brightness
levels only are considered in-
stead of the total lighting situa-
tion.
(c) Factors other than visual per-
ception are involved, e.g., hand-
eye co-ordination, so that per-
formance of the total organism
rather than of the visual sense
is being determined. This ob-
viously will vary with the time
of day and many other physio-
logical factors.
(d) Psychological factors, such as
motivation and interest, practice
effects, and knowledge of re*
suits and conditions have been
shown to greatly affect this
type of performance.
(e) The question arises how the
various experimental conditions
are indeed related to different
types of actual seeing tasks, and
finally
(f) Short-term effects only are being
determined which may bear no
direct relationship to seeing
over prolonged periods.
The concept of “visual fatigue” is
closely related to that of visual per'
formance and the latter is often de-
nned in terms of performance decre-
ment or fatigue. Fatigue generally in-
yolves three separate aspects: the sub-
jective feeling of fatigue,” physiology
cal changes in the individual, and a
decrement in the capacity for doing
work as a result of having worked.
In discussing visual fatigue it is im-
portant to isolate it from general
fatigue, and early studies indicated
that pure visual fatigue could not be
demonstrated even after prolonged ap'
plication to visual work.
Thus Carmichael and Dearborn
found no performance decrement re-
vealed by eye movement photography
after six hours of reading. The coiv
cept of retinal fatigue,” too, is now
held to be erroneous.
On the other hand, there is ample
clinical evidence for the existence of
visual fatigue. Brozek and Simonson
in the study cited above administered
various visual tests before and after the
two'hour test periods; these included
the recognition time for threshold size
dots, flicker fusion frequency, average
blink rate, rate of voluntary eye move'
ments, various binocular co-ordination
tests, ophthalmograph analysis, and
brightness discrimination. Small but
significant changes were found in
flicker fusion frequency and the recog'
nition time for threshold size dots, and
similar results have been obtained by
other authors. The Howe-Berens
ophthalmic Ergograph determines ac-
commodative and convergence fatigue j
for clinical diagnostic purposes, but is
not suitable for studying visual fatigue
in its wider sense.
Lastly, the term “ease of seeing” 1
has been extensively used by Lukiesh
and Moss and the criteria employed |
for its evaluation included “fatigue of
eye muscles ’ (decrease in convergence j
reserve), nervous muscular tension,
blink rate, and decrease in heart rate.
Once again the criteria seem in- 1
appropriate and the results uncon- j
vincing.
From this brief discussion it can be
concluded that the terms visual per-

formance, visual fatigue and ease of
[seeing are at present vague and de-
[void of scientific definition and mean-
[ing.
I now wish to formulate the prob-
[lem, especially as it affects the Illu-
; minating Engineer, in a somewhat dif-
ferent form as follows: Given an exist-
ling total lighdng situation, how can
iwe determine whether the given con-
ditions allow the visual organs to
function with maximal efficiency?
Whilst the human eye can adapt to
and function over a very wide range
of illuminations, maximal functioning
is restricted to a rather narrow range
of optimal external conditions. The
essential question seems, then, to me
to be: Does any given total lighting
situation fall within this range of
optimal conditions and how can this
fact be ascertained? We thus need a
measure or test which takes into ac-
count the total lighting situation, which
is based on the known fads of visual
physiology, and one which allows for
individual differences in visual func-
tion. Furthermore, a suitable test must
be highly sensitive to changes in the
external situation, and easily applied
and interpreted in practice. The
Lukiesh-Moss Visibility Meter consti-
tutes an attempt in this direction, but
has not found general favour with
Illuminating Engineers for many
reasons which are outside the scope of
this paper.
For our present purposes, we may
represent visual perception and its
most important functional attributes as
follows:
A. Light Perception:—
B. Form Perception:—
C. Colour Perception:—
D. Binocular Perception;—
otherwise and yet be almost completely
colour blind. Colour perception varies
greatly between individuals and :ts
efficiency in a given individual will
greatly depend on the qual ty of the
illuminant as well as the brightness
level.
For the purpose of estimating the
adequacy of external conditions for
maximal visual func ioning wc could
thus measure the light threshold, con-
trast sensitivity, visual acuity, or
stereoscopic acuity. Of these, stereo-
scopic acuity is an unreliable measure,
determination of the light threshold
requires cumbersome apparatus and
laboratory conditions, and visual acuity
too is often difficult to measure with
the desired degree of sensitivity. Con-
trast sensitivity, on the other hand,
provides a test of visual functioning
which is highly affected by brightness
level, glare and other changes in the
lighting situation, and which can
rapidly and easily be applied in the
laboratory or field. As an indicator
of the efficiency of visual perception
it forms a reliable and satisfactory
criterion.
Two simple and accurate tests of
contrast sensitivity are demonstrated,
their construction explained, and their
sensitivity discussed. The first em-
ploys rotating discs of black and white
sectors, the physiological fusion of
which produces circular bands of dit*
ferent size and different contrast
(1 1 1 1 1 )
(100 80 60 40 20).
Light Threshold.
Differential light threshold.
Visual Acuity in its various forms.
Various thresholds of colour dis-
crimination.
Stereoscopic Acuity.
Binocular co-ordination.
Light perception and form percep-
tion are closely inter-related. At any
level of ocular adaptation the light
threshold and differential threshold
(contrast sensitivity) are equal when
expressed as a fraction of the prevail-
ing light intensity, and visual acuity
in turn is a direct function of contrast
sensitivity.
Stereoscopic acuity, when fully de-
veloped, is directly dependent on
visual acuity, whilst binocular co-
ordination is little if at all affected by
changes in light intensity, except un-
der extreme conditions. Colour per-
ception can be considered separately,
since a person may be visually efficient
The second, the “George Young
Threshold Test,’’ consists of a series
of charts bearing circular spots of vary-
ing contrast. In addition, contrast
sensitivity charts for red, green, blue
and yellow are included which provide
a quick and easy estimation of colour
discrimination under different condi-
tions of illumination.

Mr. Robert Hurd, the well-known
Edinburgh architect, has been com-
missioned by Edinburgh Corporation
to prepare reconstruction plans for
Chessel’s Court, Bible Land and Shoe-
makers' Land, three ancient buildings
in the Canongate, part of Edinburgh’s
'■Royal Mile." This is part of a five-
year “face-lift" plan for the historic
but sadly - deteriorated Royal Mile,
which stretches between Edinburgh
Castle and the Palace or Holyrood-
house. Shoemakers’ Land (1726) and
Bible Land (1677) originally belonged
to the Incorporation of Cordiners, and
the frontages are considered interesting
examples of the architecture of the
period.

1936-37. The walls are of wired glass set in
glazing bars 18 inches clear of the steel stan-
chions. The roof is of reinforced concrete
with an overhang all round to carry the
cradle used in window washing. Water is
supplied for this operation from pipes which
also form the roof balustrading. A second
station was designed in 1944 and is now

Ambitious Building
Plans In West
Major Projects for Oil Refinery
Area.
The construction of the huge oil
refinery at Kwinana, Western Austra'
lia, will, it is believed, bring a new era
of prosperity to Western Australia.
Many new building projects are ah
ready in the planning stages, and some
have already been made the subject
of public announcements.
Among them is the expenditure of
£245,000 on big extensions to the
Rockingham and Naval Base hotels
and for the erection of a cinema and
shopping base at Kwinana.
The plans for these three major
works in the new industrial area of
Kwinana have been drawn by the
Perth architectural organisation of
W. G. Bennett and Associates.
In each case, Mr. Bennett said, the
owners are awaiting permits to pro'
ceed with the work.
The extension to the two hotels
are to be done in gradual stages over
a period of years.
The Hotel Rockingham, when com-
pleted, will have 100 bedrooms and
will cost about £lOO,OOO.
Considerable extensions will be
made to the ground floor, including
a semi'enclosed beer garden. The
first floor design includes the provfi
sion of seven suites, 12 double and
15 single bedrooms, and 12 staff bed'
rooms.
Later, three additional stories will
be constructed each providing six
suites, double and single bedrooms.
A new private entrance will be
provided into what is now the main
dining room, and a new dining room
will be provided.
£55,000 Extensions.
Extensions to the Naval Base Hotel
are estimated at about £55,000, and
a ground and first floor alterations,
for which a permit is sought, will cost
about £27,000.
The main entrance will be to the
roadway and a beer garden will be
given space at the rear.
The foundations will be strength'
ened to carry a total of about four
storeys.
On the first floor four suites, seven
double and eight single bedrooms,
along with six staff bedrooms, are
planned.
Each of the three subsequent floors
will provide four suites, three double
and three single bedrooms, with ac'
cess to the roof garden.
Shops adjoining the hotel are also
planned.
Cinema.
It is estimated that erection of the
cinema and shopping centre at
Kwinana will cost £90,000. Work will
commence as soon as approval is
granted.

GIANT EUCLID DUMP WAGGON
The Euclid Road Machinery Co, of Cleveland, U.S.A., (represented in Australia by Black-
wood Hodge, of Sydney and Melbourne) has produced some very big dump trucks of both the
rear-dumping and bottom-dumping types These are widely used on civil engineering works,
in quarries, and in coal haulage from open-cut mines. The model ILLD Euclid illustrated is
rated at 100.000 lb. payload with a struck capacity of 32 cubic yards. The body is 22ft.
6in. long, 11ft. 6in. wide and 46in. deep. The loading height is 10ft. 10in. and the dumping
angle 64 deg. Double steel plates are fitted to body walls and bottom and hot exhaust gas
can be passed between these skin plates to prevent freezing of the load in cold weather. Dump-
ing is effected by two 2½in. 3-stage, double acting hydraulic rams having a stroke of 6ft.
The ten tyres have a size 1800 x 33, 24-ply. The truck is powered by two Cummins diesel
engines each rated at 300 h.p. at 2,100 r.p.m. The maximum speed is 32.1 m.[?].h, loaded
and 38.2 m.p.h. empty. The 38-yard dump truck illustrated in the April issue of “The
Australasian Engineer’’ is powered with two Cummins diesel eng[?]nes also.

THE CITY OF LONDON
2000 YEARS OF FASCINATING HISTORY.
Still the World's Greatest City.
By ADRIAN ASHTON.
The great Doctor Johnson is credit-
ed with the dictum that a man “who
is tired of London is tired of life,”
and reading a most interesting brochure
entitled “The City of London An
Outline of Its History” [a copy of
which was made available by the U.K.
Information Office] one fully appre-
ciates that the truth of this statement
is still as sound as when it was uttered.
The book deals with its subject,
which extends over a period of two
thousand years, under the following
headings:—Historical; The Civic Gov-
ernment of London; The Guilds and
Livery Companies; The City’s Bridges;
The City's Spires: The City's Ex-
changes; The City's Markets; The City
in Arms; The Growth of City Bank-
ing; Insurance Its Development in
the City; The Thames and World
Trade; The City of London and the
Modern World; The Latest Years.
What Is London?
The name “London” to different
minds conjures up quite different
images. To some, London is vaguely
the capital city of Britain, the centre
of the British Empire and Common-
wealth of Nations. To others, it sig-
nifies the great administrative County
of London, with the “twin cities” of
London and Westminster at its heart,
surrounded by 27 Municipal Boroughs
—Greater London, with its area of
693 square miles and population of
8,000,000. To others, again, the term
“London” connotes the inner business
and shopping metropolis which sweeps
from the Marble Arch in the west to
Aldgate Pump in the east, and
descends from Euston Road in the
north to “The Elephant and Castle”
in the south. To others, a minority,
“London” signifies the 677 acres of
the ancient City of London itself, that
part which for centuries walled itself
against footpad and despotic King
alike.
London, from its misty beginings :
coincident with the dawn of Chris- I
tianity, has been a city of contradic-
tions or, more correctly, of balancing
forces. Intensely loyal, but fiercely re-
sistant to the smallest encroachment
upon its rights and privileges; auto- *
cratic in many ways, but always at
heart stubbornly democratic: extending
its trade to the most distant corners of
the globe, but with the nerve centre
firmly held in the “square mile”;
pursuing material gain and amassing
vast fortunes, but punctiliously sending
out that wealth again to develop new
lands and foster new industries: second
to none in its love of feasting and
merry-making, but ever-mindful of I
those less fortunate; throwing up men
of the highest character and most |
noble deeds, side by side with extrava- I
gant rogues and impudent rascals; I
erecting fine buildings and churches, I
but clearing only the bare sites of 1
wretched hovels; the City of London
has a story that is of the most moving I
human interest to the Londoner, and
scarcely less so to the outside world.
London’s First
Civic Government.
The derivation of various names that
are accepted to-day in our civic affairs
is interesting. It is recorded that in
866 King Alfred re-fortified the City
of London against the Danes and gave
it its first form of civic government
under his daughter’s husband, Ethelred,
the chief ealderman (hence alderman)
of Mercia. Again, in Saxon times |
London was governed by a Portreeve I
(afterwards a Shire-reeve or Sheriff) \
and a Bishop.
The Plague and the Fire.
Everyone knows of the ravages of I
the Great Plague upon London and I
the Great Fire that followed. It is I
stated that the probable number of I
deaths caused by the Plague was about I
75,000, in spite of ngass evacuations. I
The Plague ran its course in London; |
it is not correct to say that the Great I
Fire was responsible for ending it in I
the metropolis.
Infinitely more far-reaching in its
permanent effects upon the City was
the Great Fire. On September 2nd, ?
1666, it started in a baker's shop in
Pudding Lane. In five days virtually

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


the whole of the City was utterly de-
stroyed. St. Paul’s Cathedral, 87
churches, some 50 of the Livery Com-
panics’ Halls, four of the City gates,
four prisons and some 13,000 private
houses were consumed. The monetary
loss was estimated at £11,000,000, a
staggering sum for those days. Viewed
down the corridor of the centuries, the
Great Fire of London, was, on balance,
beneficial, because it enabled the City
to be rebuilt almost in its entirety in-
stead of piecemeal. Sir Christopher
Wren’s far-seeing plan of wide, straight
streets did not materialise. Even so,
the new City which so rapidly arose
was a tremendous improvement on the
old. It is worthy of record that in
spite of the devastation of the fire the
City merchants contrived to meet their
obligations to their foreign customers
and suppliers.
Steady, Peaceful
Development.
•It was between 1760 and 1766 that
London lost its character as a walled
city by the removal of the last por-
tions of the City wall and of the re-
maining City gates. From the early
eighteenth century onwards, the story
of the City of London is one of steady
and peaceful development. Such dis-
turbances as occurred were local and
shortlived, and the City set an example
to the world in proving that ancient
privileges were not opposed to sound,
democratic, civic government and that
astute trading was able to co-exist with
scrupulous fairness and a bounteous
measure of good deeds. In less than
three centuries its character has
changed completely from a self-
contained, walled city, where merchants
and bankers lived as well as traded, to
a purely business locality, with a day
population of over 500,000 falling to
a mere 11,000 at night.
The Civic Government
of London.
The civic government of the City
of London is to-day carried on by the
Lord Mayor, 25 Aldermen and just
over 200 Common Councillors. The
Lord Mayor holds office for one year
only, and is elected by the Court of
Aldermen from two of their own num-
ber nominated in the Court of Com-
mon Hall by the Livery—“an elec-
torate drawn from the members of the
ancient trade guilds and livery com-
panies.” Thus the Lord Mayor is only
indirectly elected by the citizens of
London, but such is the machinery of
his selection that an individual un-
acceptable to the City as a whole has
not the smallest chance of achieving
the highest office. The Lord Mayor
of the City of London has vice-regal
powers and dignity, and the citizens
have not the remotest intention of
allowing any but the most worthy of
its sons to exercise and enjoy them.
Custom dictates that the Lord Mayor
shall have served a term of office as
Sheriff.
The Lord Mayor’s
Privileges.
The first Mayor of London was
Henry FitZ'Aylwin (1189' 1213), and
the first Lord Mayor, Sir Martin Bowes
(1558). The term “Lord” Mayor is
no empty one ,as the Lord Mayor has
the rank and dignity of an Earl, and
when attending the King or receiving
other Sovereigns wears the robes of
that noble rank. He ranks next the
Sovereign within the City, taking pre'
cedence even over the heir to thev
Throne. In 1805, the then Prince of
Wales attempted to go before the Lord
Mayor, Sir James Shaw, of the Won
shipful Company of Scriviners, who
appealed to His Majesty King George
111.
Formerly, the Lord Mayor met the
heavy expenses of his office by levying
charges on the City’s many fairs, and
by other means, but to'day these fees
are commuted for the sum of £12,500.
To this the Lord Mayor has to add
very generously from his private purse.
The Court of Common Council
comprises the Lord Mayor, the Alder'
men and 206 Councilmen, and is the
oldest municipal body in Britain
older than Parliament, for in 1285 it
was specifically charged with the con'
duct of the affairs of the City.
The Guilds and Livery
Companies.
There are to-day altogether 78
Livery Companies of the City of
London, the most recent to be incor'
porated by Royal Charter being that
of the Master Mariners, in 1930.
The twelve great Livery Companies
of the City, in order of their prece-
dence, are: Mercers, Grocers, Drapers,
Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, Skinners,
Merchant Tailors, Haberdashers,
Salters, Ironmongers, Vintners, and
Clothworkers. Others whose names
excite a lively interest are Gold and
Silver Wiredrawers, Framework Knit'
ters, Playing Card Makers, and Wax-
chandlers.
Old London Bridge.
Old London Bridge is described as
fantastically beautiful, and its gay shops
and the magnificence of its chapel and
other buildings made the phrase “‘as
fine as London Bridge” pass into a
proverb. Many of the great City mer-
chants had their mansions on the
bridge. In 1460 there were 129 houses
of one kind or another on the bridge.
The bridge had twenty piers, which
projected on either side, and on these
and struts the houses were perched,
seemingly precariously but evidently
quite strongly. The bridge pfop'er was
20 feet wide and the roadway 15 feet.
St. Paul’s.
In 1673, King Charles II issued a
commission for the re-erection of St.
Pauls, and the work fell to Sir Christ'
opher Wren. He submitted several
plans, and the one chosen is to'day, by
the grace of God, still visible in stone
and glass. The work was put in hand
in 1675 and completed by 1710. The
new Cathedral is 513 ft in length, 179 ft
wide, and 365 ft high. The dome
measures 145 ft. in diameter externally.
From the early eighteenth century St.
Paul’s Cathedral has been treated with
loving reverence and respect by the
citizens of London, and Kings and
Queens of England regularly worship
there. The Cathedral had suffered no
wilful damage until, in the Second
World War, part of the structure was
damaged and the High Altar destroyed
by enemy action. Fire has raged
within a few yards of the building,
whole blocks of warehouses have been
gutted, but St. Paul’s has survived un-
touched by the flames.
The Coffee Houses.
With the introduction of coffee
from Araby, and the opening of coffee
houses in various parts of the City,
the need was most conveniently met,
and many great London institutions
had their origins in these warm, snug
coffee houses—Lloyd’s, the Stock Ex-
change, and the Baltic Exchange
among them.
To'day. London has its Coal, Iron,
Steel, Wool, Hop and Metal Ex'
changes, in addition to the Baltic and
the Royal Exchange.
Reputedly the oldest market in Lon'
don is Billingsgate Fish Market, which
dates from the ninth century. Origin'
ally a wharf, with a fortified river'gate
to keep out unwelcome visitors, the
market was known as “Billingesgate”
as early as A.D. 979.
The City holds the proud distinc'
tion of “owning” the oldest military
formation in Britain, possibly in
Europe. It is the Honourable ArtiL
lery Company, and it is so old that its
genesis is “lost in the mists of an'
tiquity.” It is reputed to go back to
the reign of William Rufus, in the
eleventh century, when citizens who
had seen service overseas banded them'
selves together as the “Gentlemen of
the Artillery Garden of London” -
the “artillery” in question being bows
and arrows.
The Bank of England.
The interesting history of the Bank
of England is ou.lined. From its in'
architects in Britain are now engaged
ception the Bank of England was a
private venture, but it was nationalised
on February 14, 1946. It is the only
bank in England and Wales empower'
ed to issue notes, and for a great many
years the lowest value of note issued
was £5. The 10s. and £l notes issued

39

in the country during the First World
War were Treasury Notes, but in 1928
the Note Issue was taken over entirely
by the Bank of England, which was
empowered by Parliament to issue 10s.
and £l Bank Notes. It speaks well
for the stability of the Bank of Eng-
land that the new notes were accepted
without a ripple on the surface of the
national life. The change-over attract-
ed far less public attention than the
issue of a new postage stamp. The
Bank prints all its own notes, and the
largest one issued was for one million
pounds. This note has been preserved
as a curiosity. Normally, all notes of
£5 and over are not reissued, but are
retained by the Bank when cashed,
and after five years (at one time ten
years) are destroyed. Many attempts
have been made to forge Bank of
England notes, but the Bank's best
safeguard is its own special paper.
Since it left the Grocers' Hall, the
Bank has been faithful to the City
thoroughfare with which it is tradition-
ally associated as “The Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street.” “The Old Lady
of Threadneedle Street” was represent-
ed by a statue in the pediment of
Soane's building. This has now been
replaced by an effigy in the modern
style.
The Bank now occupies an island
site covering more than three acres.
It is still protected every night by a
military guard, a custom which
originated with the Gordon Riots in
Londort in 1780.
To-day, the principal place in the
British joint stock banking scene is
occupied by five banks the “Big
Five all with head offices in the
City. The “Big Five” are the Mid-
land, Westminster, Barclays, Lloyd's,
and the National Provincial.
Lloyd’s Shipping Gazette.
In 1734 Lloyd's List and Shipping
Gazette was launched, to continue un-
til to-day as the oldest surviving news-
paper in Britain, with the single excep-
tion of the London Gazette, a Crown
publication.
The corporate body is managed by
a Committee of twelve, which elects
new members. The entrance fee is
£5OO, the annual subscription £3O.
The would-be underwriter usually has
to disclose assets of not less than
£lOO,OOO, and is required to furnish
a deposit of at least £5OOO.
Lloyd’s is the greatest clearing house
of maritime informatin in the world.
It employs some 1800 agents in all the
five continents, whose work is of a
very responsible nature. Quite natural-
ly, losses of vessels at sea are of prime
importance to members of Lloyd's, and
the routine of ringing the “Lutine”
Ship’s Bell is well known. No so well
known is the fact that all losses are
recorded “in gargantuan handwriting”
in the “Loss Book” a huge volume
bound in green leather. Less dramatic
are four “Arrivals” books. Telegrams
are posted on a special board, yellow
paper being used for shipping infor-
mation, orange for non-marine, and
(a recent innovation) blue for aviation.
Lloyd’s Register, which has to do
with the registration of all British ship-
ping, and which has given the world
the expression “Al at Lloyd’s” to
signify quality in the highest category,
is a concern quite independent of
Lloyd’s, the corporation of under-
writers.
The earliest known marine policy
still existing relates to a voyage from
Macassar to London in 1657 of “The
Three Brothers,” a London vessel of
250 tons with a cargo valued at £4OO.
Fire insurance in London started
after the Great Fire in 1666 —a classic
instance of locking the stable-door
after the horse had gone.
The People and the Blitz.
The concentrated bombing which
began in September, 1940, and con-
tinned till May, 1941, at first night by
night, but later with gradually length-
ening intervals between the raids, de-
stroyed or damaged a great many of
the oldest and most valuable buildings
in the City, while wide areas of office
and warehouse buildings have been
devastated. The raids were intended
to render life and work in the City
intolerable. They succeeded in making
things in high degree difficult, dan-
gerous and uncomfortable, but, intend-
ing to wipe out the City, the Germans
succeeded in destroying one of their
own favourite propaganda myths—the
legend that the City of London was
the home of plutocratic parasites, des-
titute of patriotism and courage, or
indeed of any sort of sentiment save
self-seeking, who would flee their post
at the first signal of danger. On the
contrary, the City, in the hour of trial,
carried itself with fortitude.
Thus the City stuck to its job.
London was the first town to be
heavily and continuously attacked in
England, and it was the object of a
more continuous attack than any other
town suffered. The workers of the
City, by their example of heroism and
patience, by their refusal to forsake
their duty, provided an example which
heartened other British towns in the
ordeal they were presently to face.
Apart from the physical means of
distribution, as represented by great
docks, wharves and warehouses, the
City of London is destined to play an
ever-increasing part in financing the
re-birth of international trade. The
credit of London is as firm and un-
shaken to-day as ever it has been in
the past. Perhaps it is, indeed,
sounder, inasmuch as it has emerged
from a test of strength undreamed of
in its rigours. Those of us who have
had the proud privilege of living in
London through its sternest ordeal face
the future with a confidence all the
greater for our experience.
This fascinating story of the great
city that was the mantle of a Nation,
an Empire and a Commonwealth may
be appropriately ended on this quota-
tion from its pages:
“The concourse of States and people
known as the British Empire and
Commonwealth of Nations has come
into existence in the past 400 years,
and it owes that existence far more to
the binding interplay of trade than to
the cutting edge of the sword.”
OFFICIAL ARCHITECTS
INCREASE IN BRITAIN.
R.1.8.A. President Mr. Graham
Henderson said at the Institute’s recent
dinner that over fifty per cent, of

EARLY ELECTRIC RAILWAY IN LONDON.
The City of South London Railway was opened in 1890 and was the first standard gauge elec-
tric railway in the world. The engineer was J. H. Greathead who had developed the im-
proved shield and cast iron segmental lining for subaqueous tunnels for the Tower Subway,
opened in 1870. Another electric railway under the Thames connected Waterloo Station with
the Bank in 1898. The Central London Railway followed in 1900 and ran from the Bank
to Shepherd’s Bush. The photograph shows one of the earlier trams for the Central London
Railway. Like its predecessors it required an electric locomotive. Complaints from property
owners overhead of vibration led to the more modern system of motor-coach trains in 1903.

Town Planning
Bodies Amalgamate
Australian Planning Institute
Formed.
Three town planning bodies have
amalgamated to form the Australian
Planning Institute.
They are the Town and Country
Planning Institute (N.S.W.) . the Plan'
ning Institute of Australia (Vic.), and
the South Australian Town Planning
Institute.
The first president of the institute
is Professor Denis Winston, professor
of town and country planning at Syd'
ney University.
Mr. R. D. L. Fraser, Cumberland
County Council’s deputy chief planner,
was appointed secretary.
The merger follows a decision made
at the Jubilee international town plan'
ning congress at Canberra last year,
when delegates were unanimous re'
garding the need for an Australia'wide
organisation.
Among the main objects of the in'
stitute is to promote decentralisation,
especially while the Federal Govern'
ment’s migration programme continues
in operation.
The institute Will hold its next con-
gress at Melbourne in October and at
Adelaide in 1953. Distinguished over-
seas town'planners will be invited to
attend.
AUTHORITY OF OLD SYDNEY
PASSES.
Death of Mr. C. H. Bertie.
The death occurred recently of
Mr. C. H. Bertie at the age of 77.
Mr. Bertie, who, before his retire-
ment. was for many years Librarian to
the Municipal Library in the Queen
Victoria Building, was a recognised
authority on “Old Sydney," and there
was little of note that had happened
since the founding of the Colony that
had escaped his patient research. The
happenings and colourful personalities
of these bygone days when Sydney
was emerging from hamlet to town
and later from town to city fascinated
Bertie and he passed on the interest
in his many lectures, articles and par-
ticularly in his delightful little book,
“The Story of Sydney.’’
C. H. Bertie loved his Sydney,
which in turn owes him a <rreat debt
for his kindly unfolding of its colour-
ful history.
Eleven-Storey
Flats For London
£1,446,500 Scheme.
The London County Council is
about to commence an extensive new
housing development at Wandsworth.
It will contain 655 dwelling units ac-
commodated in the following manner.
The scheme will comprise nine 11-
storey blocks each with a laundry, 11
four-storey blocks of superimposed
maisonettes, 76 houses in 10 terraces,
and a three-storey block of one-room
flats with balcony access. In addition
to the housing accommodation, there
will be six shops with a clubroom
above, 30 garages, two tenants’ work-
shops, an estate workshop, two play-
grounds and 256 tenants’ stores.
Ample Open Areas.
While achieving a density of 28.7
dwellings to the acre by the adoption
of this well-balanced layout, only three
of the 25 acres will actually be built
upon.
The first to eleventh floors of the
new blocks each have three three-room
flats and one two-room flat, while on
the ground floor there are a laundry
and tenants’ stores, and either a four-
room caretaker’s flat and a one-room
flat, or three one-room flats.
The central “core” contains two
staircases lighted and ventilated to the
open air, twin refuse chutes and two
lifts with a central lift lobby. Each
lift stops at alternate floors.
These latest blocks are more econ'
omical than the original design by
virtue of the fact that the lifts and
stairs will serve 42 flats in each block
instead of 32; there is less external
walling for each flat because of the
square plan: and the compact intern'
al planning and square design will re'
suit in economy in heating, services
and construction.
The space in the centre of the block
which cannot easily be lit or ventilated
by natural means will be used for the
bathrooms and lavatories, which will
be provided with a duplicate system
of mechanical ventilation. There are
windows in both external walls of the
living-rooms, thus giving two differ'
ent prospects and in the three-room
flats a large balcony forms a valuable
addition which could be used as a
play-space for children. A central
heating and hot-water service will be
installed.
Estimated cost of the development,
including architectural and incidental
expenses, is £ 1,446,500, and work on
the site is expected to commence in
the latter half of 1952.

TO CROSS THE LOUNGE OR NOT.
In the planning of the present-day house everything possible has to be done to reduce waste spree to an absolute
minimum not only from the point of view of cost but also to make the house as labour-saving as possible from
the viewpoint of the housewife. In effecting this reduction of area the problem of access from one part of the
house to the other comes up and with it the question of whether the lounge should be used as a corridor. The
two top examples show on the right an example where the lounge is so used, while on the left the designer has
gone to the extreme measure of introducing a special corridor to overcome this feature. This seems an unnecessary
and undesirable feature for if it is desired to keep the lounge separate this can usually be achieved by skilful
and ingenious planning On the other hand, if Its purpose helps to isolate the study, it is an ideal arrangement.
The kitchen in the lower left is located immediately adjacent to the main entrance door.

TWO-STOREY OR ONE.
There is strong opinion amongst the womenfolk who have to run a house as to which has the most advantages—
a single or a double storey. The high costs of recent years have probably swung the pendulum in the single
storey's favour, though in the pre-war decade it was the large two-storey houses that were built in such large
numbers These four examples have two of each, although the two upper ones are hardly two-storeyed in the full
sense of the word, providing the upper storey in the roof space, light being obtained by gable and dormer.
The designer in the bottom left appears to have tried to see how many different types and sizes .of windows that
he could incorporate.

Record Expected
Senator Optimistic.
In Canberra last weekend, the Min'

ator Spooner, said he expected that
final figures will show a house'build'
ing record for 1951-52.
He said the probable total of houses
built during the year was about
77,000, or about 3500 more than in
1950-51.
According to the latest official ac-
count, the total for the first half of
last year was 40,060, Senator Spoon-
er added.
Competitive Conditions Returning.
I am glad to say there are unmis-
takable signs that the building indus-
try is returning to more competitive
conditions,” he commented.
“Some State Housing Authorities,
for instance, have reported a drop in
contract prices submitted to them in
recent months, and prices quoted for
private building are also beginning to
stabilise.”

Out o/ the Seu . . .
Steel industry engineers pushed back the sea to establish a new
industrial centre at the iron ore port of Whyalla on the western
shore of Spencer Gulf, South Australia. The tidal swamp of
thirteen years ago has been transformed by B.H.P. enterprise
into Australia’s largest shipyard, which has launched 126,000
tons of merchant shipping since 1942, a modern blast furnace
plant, and a deep-water harbour.
With industry came people, and a modern town was planned
and built. In ten years, Whyalla’s population rose from 1,200
to 8,000. With its fine modern homes and civic amenities,
Whyalla is a living, growing symbol of Australian enterprise
. . . another and outstanding instance of the nation-wide
contribution the steel industry is making to the development

THE AIR BEEF STORY
AIR TRANSPORT REVOLUTIONISES KIMBERLEY BEEF INDUSTRY.
Of all man’s inventions of the last
few decades, none have had such an
impact on outback Australian life as
radio and the aeroplane. Between
them, they are rapidly overcoming the
isolation and loneliness of life in the
inland and North, bringing instant
communication and reducing weeks of
tedious travel to a matter of hours.
Radio has solved the communication
problem—the aeroplane is well on the
way towards solving the transport
problem for the great cattle industry
of the Kimberley district in the north'
west of Western Australia.
Half as large again as the State of
Victoria, the Kimberleys cover 130,000
square miles of some of the finest cattle
country in Australia. An area rich in
potential, its development has not pro'
gressed much beyond the stage reached
by the first settlers seventy years ago.
With a population of 4000, it boasts
three small towns. Away on the
western coast in Yampi Sound lie some
of Australia’s major iron ore deposits.
The Kimberleys’ problems are those
of the great mass of undeveloped
Australia, and they can be summed up
in the one word—transport. Without
easier and more economical access, the
development of the outback can go
no further. The Kimberleys, the Nor'
them Territory, northern and central
Queensland, are all great food'
producing areas, capable of vastly
greater output than at present. In
fact, output is static or declining tO'day
—and this at a time when no limit
can be seen to the demands for food,
either at home or abroad.
To live, the cattleman of the Kim'
berleys has to get his cattle to market,
either for sale or slaughter, and in
this he is no different from his fellow
pastoralists elsewhere. Only rough
tracks and stock routes link him with
the meatworks at Wyndham or the
port at Derby, and he is 2000 miles
from Perth. Until the advent of the
Air Beef scheme, there was only one
way to get cattle out, and that was
by droving them overland.
Huge Losses.
The case of Glenroy Station in the
Kimberleys is typical. From there, 200
air miles south'west of Wyndham and
160 miles east of Derby, a mob would
be making good time to reach the
meat works at Wyndham in a month
from Glenroy, and for every four or
five weeks on the road in the Kim'
berleys, each beast loses 50'100 lbs.—
not to mention the animals that fall by
the wayside, or break away. Of those
that survive to reach the meatworks,
an average of only 25 per cent, would
be passed as first'dass export quality.
Great as are the losses in transit in
individual cases, when extended over
the whole industry they become pro'
digious. About one million head of
cattle are droved along stock routes or
transported by road or rail to some
slaughtering centre on the coast every
year. It is estimated that in the pro'
cess 80,000,000 lbs. of good beef is
lost every year between station and
market.
Even before the cattle set out, their
numbers are whittled down, for only
the fittest can survive the journey, and
they are drawn from those of from
five to seven years. In that period,
they have reached killing condition
two or three times. If they do not
survive to that age, then the beef and
hide are lost. It has been computed
that 4,500,000 lbs. of good potential
leather goes to waste in the hides of
dead cattle every year in the Northern
areas.
As a general rule, only seven per
cent, of the total herd grazed is ever
marketed. They are the fittest and
best. It is from the unmarketable re'
mainder that we breed our future
herds. That seven per cent, constitutes
the “turnoff,” the vital factor in the
economics of the beef industry, and,
under established conditions, it cannot
be increased. But before even that
percentage can be marketed, another
seven per cent, is lost through sickness
or injury.
Yet in three years one cattle pro'
perty in the Kimberleys, Glenroy, has:
Increased the turnoff of cattle by
171 per cent, annually.
Increased the average weight of beef
per carcase by 8 per cent.
Increased beef production by 188
per cent, per annum.
Increased first and second quality
export grade beef by 413 per
cent, annually.
These increases in percentages were
achieved in a comparison over similar
periods, namely, three years prior to
Air Beef, 1946'47'48, and three years
through Air Beef’s operations, 1949'
5051.
The figures indicate what can be
done when transport is available and
cattle are killed inland. With the
aeroplane supplying transport, it be-
came possible to set up a small abat'
toir at Glenroy Station, and the Air
Beef Scheme came into being.
Great Potential Industry.
To even the most conservative and
sceptical, it must be apparent that Air
Beef’s record for the last three years
contains the seeds of a revolution in
the Northern cattle industry. It has
proved that air transport can solve the

PRESENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONS.
Map showing present and future operations of Air Beef Pty. Ltd. By setting up abattoirs such
as the one at Glenroy, in the heart of the cattle country and using a rcraft to fly the beef to
Wyndham, the lack of surface transport which has barred further development has been over-
come. Air Beef sponsors claim that the scheme can do the same job of development for the
north as roads and railways at a fraction of the cost.

great problem of any further intensive
development in the North lack of
adequate, economical transport.
Just what the potentialities of the
Kimberley area alone are can be
gauged from these estimates of in'
creased production at Glenroy under
the Air Beef Scheme. By 1961, it is
estimated that Glenroy will reach an
annual turnoff of 4000 head, producing
2,600,000 lbs. of beef and 180,000 lbs.
of hides. Compare this with the pre'
Air Beef days of an annual turnoff of
700, yielding 370,000 lbs. of beef and
31,500 lbs. of hides.
So far, the Air Beef Scheme has
presented the only practical solution
to the problem of increasing turnoff.
Now the properties served by it will
be able to finance needed improve'
ments, making for easier management,
controlled breeding and earlier killing,
resulting again in increased production.
Glenroy has been an ideal testing
ground for an idea which first ger'
minated in the mind of Mr. lan
Grabowsky, planning and development
manager for Australian National Air'
ways Pty. Ltd., before World War 11.
A leading exponent of the economics
of the aeroplane as a transport vehicle,
he saw what it had achieved in New
Guinea, hauling complete gold dredges
over inaccessible mountains to Wau
and Bulolo.
After years of study and investiga'
tion, Mr. Grabowsky was ready to
start in 1949. In the Blythe brothers,
owners of the Mount House and
Glenroy Stations in the Kimberleys, he
found three fellow'enthusiasts. Mr.
Gordon Blythe, who runs Glenroy, had
had experience of airfreighting beef
to troops in New Guinea during the
war, and in 1947 had actually air'
freighted beef 1500 air miles to Perth,
proving that it could be shifted by air
without deterioration.
Air Beef Pty. Ltd. Formed.
Air Beef Pty. Ltd. was formed at
the end of 1948, with a capital of
£ 15,000, subscribed equally by a
group of Kimberley graziers, the
Macßobertson ' Miller Aviation Co.,
and Australian National Airways Pty.
Ltd. To assist the project, the West
Australian Government lent £lO,OOO
to the company, interest-free for three
years. The Commonwealth Govern'
ment has recently granted a subsidy of
£lO,OOO per year to Air Beef.
Operations began in May, 1949, and
aroused wide interest, not only through'
out Australia, but all over the world.
It was a new approach to the market'
ing of beef, for only in South America
had it ever before been attempted.
Glenroy was selected for several
reasons. It is in the heart of the Kim'
berleys, virtually inaccessible by ground
transport, with a 300'mile trek over'
land to the nearest meatworks at
Wyndham. Further, the situation pre'
eluded any improvement in the num-
ber and quality of the herds without a
more effective turnoff.
The first step was the construction
of the abattoirs at Glenroy. Every
scrap of material was flown in from
the seaport at Derby.
Now employing some twenty men at
Glenroy, Air Beef buys the cattle from
neighbouring stations, paying accord'
ing to grading after slaughter, and
then meets all costs of treatment, trans'
port and handling at Wyndham.
There the State Government meat'
works makes available a refrigeration
truck for transporting the carcases
from airport to freezing chambers.
The beef is then sold direct by the
company to overseas markets at ruling
export prices.
After slaughtering at Glenroy, the
meat is chilled for eighteen hours to
38 degrees bone temperature, then
quartered ready for loading into the
aircraft. Three hours after the
freighter takes off from the strip at
Glenroy, the beef is in the freezing
chambers at Wyndham meatworks.
1949 saw 647,952 lbs. of carcases
sent by air to Wyndham, of which
83 per cent, were export quality beef.
Compare this with the pre'Air Beef
figures for 1948 of 302,692 lbs., and
59 per cent, export quality, and the
season was one of the best for many
years.
In 1950, Air Beef flew 1,207,632.
lbs. of carcases to Wyndham, of
which 75 per cent, were graded ex'
port quality. Average weight was
565 lbs.
But it is not only the beef that in'
land killing and air transport gets to
market which would have been lost
otherwise that is giving such a -boost
to the prospects of these Kimberley
stations. Cattle produce a lot of im'
portant products besides beef. Meat
meal, blood bone, tallow, fertilisers and
hides are all used in one form or
another on every .cattle property, and
every property originates them. Yet
meat meal, one of the finest cattle
foods, produced at Wyndham and sent
to Perth, has to be shipped and over'
landed a couple of thonusand miles
back to where the cattle were pro'
duced in the first place before it can
be used.
Since 98 per cent, of the inedible
offal is processed by machinery, the
necessary plant can operate just as
efficiently and far more usefully
where it is needed, rather than hun'
dreds of miles away. This is just what
Air Beef plans to do at Glenroy.
It has already been proved that the
Kimberleys can produce top'quality
pigs for export. Forty pigs flown from ■
Perth were fattened on boiled inedible
offal, local hay and open grazing, j
They put on weight at the rate of
one pound a day from the time of i
their arrival at Glenroy, and when
killed were 100 per cent, export
baconers.
By-products Development.
Encouraged by these results, one '
station is planning to run a pig farm
of 200 sows, feeding them on meat
meal produced at Glenroy. Thus has
been established a local market for one
of an abattoir’s most important by' ■
products.
Previously, the stations depended on
natural pastures for stock feed. Now,
with the air as their highway, farm
machinery can be flown in, crops plant'
ed and harvested. Five hundred acres
of sorghum are to be planted to pro'
vide pigs and horse feed. The pos' ;
sibilities of using the tallow byproduct
of the abattoirs as a fuel in place of
oil to generate steam for the produc'
tion of meat meal is also being inves'
tigated. As one development leads to :
another, the limitations of a one'
product economy are being overcome.
In 1950, 104 sheep were flown in
one lift from Noonkanbah, 115 air
miles away, to the abattoirs. When
killed, they averaged 47 lbs. dressed
weight, ideal for market. Quality was
export grade. There seems no reason'
why “Air Lamb” should not revolu' ■
tionise the outlying sheep industry in
the same way as inland killing and air
freight have revolutionised prospects :
round Glenroy.
Spectacular as the results of the Air
Beef Scheme have been to date, they
are only a foretaste of future pos'
sibilities, possibilities all the more ex-
citing because they are within practical
bounds right now.
The stumbling block to any further
development has been transport and
greater turnoff. Air transport and in'
land killing have lifted turnoff to near'
ly 11 per cent, inside three years, with
the same number of cattle on the
the property. The bigger turnoff
means more money for improvement,
making for heavier carrying capacity *
and better quality herds,
A progressive development pro'
gramme at Mount House over the
next ten years plans to lift this figure
to 20 per cent., or 4000 cattle a year,
which is a figure within only the limits
of some of the well'developed areas
near the capital cities.
What has been accomplished on this ;
one property can be repeated on hun'
dreds of others in the North and in-
land. Air transport has made possible
the lines of supply and inland abat'
toirs, and has proved its ability to cope : |
with all the transport needs of the j

stations. As a result, it must bring
greater population, closer settlement,
and greater development.

With the aim of lifting turnoff to
20 per cent, and utilising to the full
potential carrying capacity, a six'Stage
plan, involving air, road and rail trans'
port has been formulated.
There are some 90 areas through'
out the Kimberleys, the Northern
Territory, Queensland, New South
Wales, South Australia, and mid'
Western Australia which can all be
developed along these lines. To pro'
vide them all with the roads and rail'
ways as a prerequisite to achieving
these figures would cost close to £SOO
million as an initial outlay, it is esti'
mated, plus almost as large an amount
in transport subsidies, since it would
be many years before production
would be high enough to bear the
cost of transport.
By utilising the basic economies of
air transport, in the early stages of
this plan. Air Beef sponsors claim that
the same goal could be achieved for
£4O million, plus an annual air sub'
sidy of £4,500,000.
Under present circumstances, the air
vehicle has a limit to the amount of
traffic it can haul economically—ll,ooo
short tons, or 22,000 head of cattle
per year —beyond which road trans'
port becomes more economic. That,
too, has its limit, round the 75,000'
ton mark, equivalent to 150,000 head
of cattle. Beyond this figure, rail
reigns supreme.
Thus, to make road and rail trans'
port an economic proposition, turnoff
must first be increased by 700 per
cent., and then by another 4300 per
cent, above pre'Air Beef days. The
annual turnoff of the Kimberleys was
3000 head from 50,000 cattle in those
days. To meet rail requirements, the
area would have to carry 750,000 head.
These figures seem fantastic, but
they are based on what has already
been achieved at Glenroy. When ex'
tended to the whole cattle industry,
they unfold vast possibilities. As a
proposition, the scheme has the merit
of practicability, and as the payloads
of aircraft increase, the role of air
transport would enlarge, rather than
decrease.
Spread over a minimum of 35 years,
the plan envisages, through inland kill'
ing and air transport to the coast or
nearest railhead, a gradual increase in
turnoff, resulting in more improve'
ments and greater carrying capacity,
until production made road transport
feasible, ..This in turn would stimulate
output to the point where railways
would be the only economic method
of handling the traffic. Such a scheme
would largely finance each successive
stage through increased production.
The scheme could be started imme-
diately, provided aircraft and materials
were available. At the end of six years
165 small abattoirs on the lines of that
at Glenroy could be built and in opera'
tion at strategic points throughout
Australia’s cattle country, all of them
within 200300 miles of a port or rail'
way. Between them some eighty air
freighters would be flying, hauling out
beef and returning with stores and
equipment to boost production even
further. Within ten years Air Beef
would incrase beef production in the
northern parts of Australia alone by
more than 100 per cent.
In his foreword to Mr. I. H.
Grabowsky’s book, “The Story of the
Air Beef Project,” Mr. Essington
Lewis, Chairman of Directors of The
Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.,
made the following observations: —
“Truly I feel that with Air Beef we
are witnessing a most important de'
velopment, and with its expansion we
may have the key to the development
of the whole of the northern areas,
which development is so essential if
we are to preserve the ideals from
which the Australian way of life is
based.”
Footnote.—Without any increase in
the present cattle population, an in'
crease in turnoff to 20 per cent, would
provide enough meat for the United
Kingdom to abolish rationing.
—“The B.H.P. Review.”
“JERRY-BUILT.”
There are several fanciful, so'called
origins for the words “jerry'built,” and
most of us know the meaning of the
term. It is not clear how the term
originated, however, although some be'
lieve it is a reference to Jeremiah the
Prophet, in the sense of jeremiad,
foredoomed to decay and ruin speedily,
as foretold by Jeremiah. But the prob'
able truth is that the word “jerry” is
a corruption of the French “jour,” a
day, meaning temporary, unsubstam
tial.
COMPENSATION AND THE
COUNTY OF CUMBERLAND
PLAN.
Valuable Book for Architects and
Planners.
On the 27th June, 1951, assent was
given to the Local Government
(Amendment) Act 1951, whereupon
the County of Cumberland Town and
Country Planning Scheme assumed
the force of law. This important
event passed almost unnoticed, ah
though earlier the draft planning pro'
visions had been the matter of much
debate. On the 30th November,
1951, it was announced in the “Ga'
zette” that claims for loss due to the
coming into operation of any provi'
sion or restriction in the scheme had
started five months previously on the
27th June, 1951, and should be made
by the 27th December, 1951.
In view of the shortage of time,
this was extended for a further six
months, and it has just been announc'
ed that a further extension has been
made to December 26th, 1952.
As it is reasonable to assume that
this will be the last and final extern
sion, all those property owners who
have not studied the implication of
the plan upon their properties and
projects would be wise to do so at
once. As the procedure is new to
this country and somewhat complex, a
book recently published entitled “Com'
pensation and the County of Cum'
berland Plan” will be of value to ar'
chitects, engineers and planners respom
sible for formulating these claims. Its
author, Mr. Ronald Collier, is. well'
qualified to prepare such a volume for

ain in respect of the Town and Coum

Protective Claims.
In England, says the author in his
Preface, nearly one million claims
were lodged and on analysis it was
found that about half had been claims
of a protective nature, made because
the legislation was too complicated to
digest in a hurry, it being considered
better to lodge a claim and be “safe
rather than sorry.”

Economy in the Use of Steel
for Structural Purposes
S.A.A. CODE TO BE REVISED.
Increases from 18,000 to 20,000 lb. per sq. in.
In recent years, the world shortage
of steel has caused grave concern to
the governments of major manufac-
turing nations and steps have been
taken to ensure the maximum econ-
omy in the use of this material, which
is vital both from a national economy,
as well as a defence point of view.
Australia is favourably placed with
respect to raw materials, but has, un-
fortunately, a limited capacity in so
far as mill production is concerned.
For the current year the demand for
steel in Australia reached about 12,-
125,000 tons, but only about 1,900,-
000 tons was actually available. Of
this 1,900,000 tons, 1,200,000 tons
was provided from local sources.
These figures indicate that roughly
only one-sixth of Australian require-
ments could be met and the implica-
tions of this position mean an enorm-
ous reduction in the volume of essen-
tial services such as road and rail-
way bridges, rolling stock and perm-
anent way for railways, steel pipes,
buildings for commercial and indus-
trial purposes, etc.
Letter From Prime Minister.
A letter dated 26th October, 1951,
addressed to the Standards Associa-
tion of Australia on behalf of the
Prime Minister of Australia, gave point
to the urgency ©f this question and
called for immediate action by the As-
sociation. The terms of this letter
were;
“In view of the acute shortage
of steel which exists now and which
apparently will continue for sever-
al years, it has been suggested to
me that substantial economy would
result from an increase in the basic
working stresses allowed under the
SAA Code for Structural Steel in
Building.
“I would be pleased to hear that
your Association would consider the
revision of the above code with a
view to economising steel at this
time and that pending the issue of
the revised Code, an interim revi-
sion of the working stresses in the
existing Code be agreed and is'
sued.”
The Code referred to covers a field
which is the largest single usage of
steel in Australia and represents about
22 per cent, of the total steel used
in Australia. Under this Code, the
basic working stress for steel having
an ultimate tensile strength of 28'3 3
tons per sq. in. was limited to 18,000
lb. per sq. in. The British Code, B.S.
449, parallel in its scope to the Aus'
tralian Code, allows a basic working
stress in tension of 9 tons per sq. in.
(20,160 lb. per sq. in.) for steel hav'
ing an ultimate tensile stress of 28'3 3
tons per sq. in. and a guaranteed yield
stress of between 14.75 and 15.25 tons
per sq. in. depending on the size of
the section. Thus it would appear
that for steel equivalent to Australian
steel a working stress approximately
11 per cent, greater is permitted by
the British Code. It is estimated that
by adopting a similar increase in work'
ing stresses in the Australian Code a
saving in steel amounting to <£A 1,500,-
000, would be made annually.
Conference Held.
In order that all the implications of
this question could be fully consider-
ed, the SAA called a conference in
December, 1951, primarily consisting
of members of the technical commit-
tees concerned with structural codes,
and included engineers concerned
with the design and erection of
bridges, permanent ways and buildings
provided by public authorities, con-
sulting engineers in general practice
and representatives of the major steel
manufacturers in Australia.
Dr. W. D. Chapman, Director of
Civil Engineering for the Common-
wealth Department of Shipping and
Transport, was chairman, and fortu-
itously, the representative of the Syd-
ney University, Professor J. W. Rod-
erick, had been closely associated with
the research work and actual drafting
of the British Code B.S. 449, and was
able therefore to give considerable as-
sistance to the Conference.
British and Australian
Steel Compared.
The whole question of increasing
working stresses turned on the com-
parison between British steel to B.S.
15 and Australian steel. Both steels
apparently had the same ultimate
strength of between 28'3 3 tons per
sq. in. However, in the case of Brit'
ish steel, a guaranteed yield point
was given. Representatives of the steel
manufacturers stated that Australian
steel would fully meet the require'
ments of B.S. 15, and the Conference,
having this assurance, were unanimous
in the decision that the basic working
stresses in the Australian Code should
be increased to those provided in the
British Code.
Other Economies.
It was apparent however, from the
discussions of the Conference, that
other economies could be achieved
which could save as much, if not more.

steel than that saved by the increase
of working stresses. These considera-
tions raised the question of a general
revision of the Australian Code. By
the terms of this Code, design meth-
ods are limited to simple design or
semi-rigid design, whereas under the
British Code, fully rigid design meth-
ods may be employed using a load
factor of 2 on the calculated or other-
wise ascertained failure load of the
structure or any of its parts. Such a
method opens up to competent de-
signers a wide scope for the introduc-
tion of new forms of construction
showing marked economies over older
methods.
Wind Loading and Welding.
A detailed consideration of the
British Code B.S. 449, which had al-
ready been recommended by the In-
stitution of Engineers, Australia, for
adoption as an interim measure, re-
vealed that in the main this Code
could be adopted for Australian pur-
poses, Two portions, however, would
require amendment. The first dealt
with loading on structures, including
wind loading. An Australian Code
upon which a technical committee has
been working for some two years was
virtually complete and this section of
the British Code could be replaced in
its entirety by the Australian Code.
The second section was the section
dealing with welding and again the
Australian Welding Institute has had
a technical committee working on a re-
vised Code for the use of Welding
in Building Construction to replace
the existing Australian Welding Code
for several years, and it was consider-
ed that this revision would meet Aus-
iahan conditions more appropriate!'
than the provisions of B.S. 449.
The Conference appointed a small
technical committee of experts, under
the chairmanship of Professor J. V/.
Roderick, to prepare a revision of
B.S. 449 as an Australian Interim
Code and further decided to adopt the
Australian Code for the Minimum de-
sign Loads on Buildings and the Code
for the use of Welding in Building
Construction as joint Codes with the
Structural Steel Code, subject to the
final consideration of these two Codes
by SAA technical committees. _
Subsequently to the Conference, a
meeting of the Sectional Committee
on Loading on Structures considered
the final draft of the Code for Mini-
mum Design Loads on Structures and
gave approval for its issue as an In-
terim Code. This Code is now be-
ing prepared for publication.
The technical committee appointed
by the Conference has worked rapid-
ly on the revision of B.S. 449 along
the lines recommended by the Confer-
ence and work is also nearing comple-
tion on the Welding Code, so it is ex-
pected that all three Codes in interim
form will be published about the same
time.

Australian Housing
Over Quarter of a Million Houses
Since The War.
The February, 1952, issue of Aus-
lian Housing (received 29/5/52)
would make interesting reading if it
were not so out of date.
It records that from the end of
World War 11. to March, 1951,
253,427 houses and flats were com-
pleted, which it is estimated provided
a home for over a million people.
State details were as follows:
N.S.W 87,568
Victoria 69,243
Queensland 47,020
South Australia 20,381
Western Australia 16,319
Tasmania 11,192
A.C.T 1,704
During 1950, 63,429 houses and
flats were completed which was 17%
higher than in 1949.
Huge Increase in Owner-Builder.
A new factor was the great increase
in “owner-builders” and at the end of
March, 1951, nearly half of the total
of 80,000 dwellings under construc-
tion were being built without the ser-
vices of a building contractor.
It is further stated that the cost of
building “specimen” brick and tim-
ber houses in the six capital cities in-
creased by 75% from March, 1947,
to June, 1951, the increase in the last
year being 25%. It is stated in this
issue (Bulletin No. 23) that owing
to staff reductions in the Ministry of
National Development, this will be the
final issue of “Australian Housing”.
THE LATE H. A. RORKE.
Death of Well-known Engineer.
The death occurred suddenly on
July 4th of Mr. Harold A. Rorke,
well-known Sydney mechanical and
electrical engineer.
The son of Dr. Charles Rorke, of
North Sydney, he was born in 1890
and educated at St. Ignatius College,
Sydney, and Sydney University,
graduating in 1912 as B.E. in electrical
and mechanical engineering.
He commenced in practice in Syd-
ney as a Consulting Electrical and
Mechanical Engineer and built up a
large practice, recently being joined
by Mr. Geoffrey Warren, the practice
becoming H. A. Rorke & Warren.
Over the years he carried out the
design and supervision of the installa-
tion of electrical and mechanical ser-
vices, lifts, escalators, air conditioning
plants and steam-heating and hot-water
services in many of the large public
building and industrial plants in Syd-
ney and throughout New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia, Western
Australia, Queensland, Tasmania,
South Africa, England, Fiji and New
Zealand.
Mr. Rorke was a Foundation Asso-
ciate Member of the Institution of
Engineers, Australia, and a Chartered
Engineer, Australia. He served on
the Consulting Engineers’ Panel of the
Institution of Engineers, Australia,
and on many Standards’ Association
of Australia Committees. He render-
ed great service during both World
War I -and II as State Publicity Censor.
STADIUM AND SPORTS CENTRE,
TAMPERE, FINLAND.
This new stadium and sports centre at Tam-
pere, Finland, is beautifully situated on a
peninsula in the centre of the town. A high-
way has been planned over the peninsula to
serve traffic going towards the West. In the
sports area there is the chief athletic field
with a stand for 20,000 spectators. It is
intended to build in addition to the grand-
stand a sport house including indoor swim-
ming baths, a hall for ball-games and bowl-
ing, a restaurant, gymnasiums, offices, and a
public hall; the tower will contain sleeping
accommodation and offices. Entrances for the
public and the car park and competitors’ en-
trance is behind the grandstand. The large
training and assembly field, tennis courts,
etc., will be placed on the point of the pen-
insula. Traffic will pass through two tunnels
under the road.

“Home of To-morrow”
A “CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC”.
Termed by its designers as a “Con-
temporary classic” in both architectural
design and furnishings, the “Home of
To-morrow” erected in Los Angeles
by master builder Fritz Burns is the
latest version of his 1946 post-war
house.
In that year, Mr. Burns’ house in-
corporated the latest and most ad-
vanced thinking in design, materials
and equipment. Since then many of
the features of this now-famous house
have become commonplace in the
U.S.A.
To make this house fully represen-
tative of latest developments and
forward-thinking in design and equip-
ment the Burns’ organisation have
completed extensive modernisation and
remodelling of the prototype house.
The result is that the house now
incorporates the most advanced ideas
of construction and materials used in
planning, building and furnishing.
“The Home of To-morrow” was
originally designed to reflect a modern
functionalism typifying the mid-
twentieth century way of life. While
elaborate in concept and designed pri-
marily for the Californian climate, the
house contains several unique plan-
ning and furnishing ideas which would
be readily adaptable to Australian
conditions.
Concrete-Slab Founcation.
The home, which has no basement,
is built on a concrete-slab foundation.
Containing some 2400 sq. ft. of floor
area, the house is U-shaped in plan
and utilises redwood batten, flagstone
and sliding glass walls for the informal
appearance of its exterior. A detached,
over-sized carport serves as a work-
room and storage area.
Built Around Patio.
The house is designed around the
idea that inside rooms and outside
patios are all part of the same living
unit. Thus, just off the bedrooms is
a private garden area, and a full wall
of sliding glass doors and screens in
each room gives access to this garden
and patio. Framed in three sides by
the wings of the house is the central
patio, shaded by trees and used for
relaxation,
“New Freedom Kitchen.”
The unique plan of the “New Free-
dom Gas Kitchen” is designed and
equipped to meet all desires and de-
mands of the modern housewife.
The kitchen is planned around a
central island containing sink, dish-
washer and counter top, which can
also be used as a breakfast bar.
Just off the kitchen and separated
from the patio by a wall of glass is
the family room, designed as a com-
mon meeting-place for all members.
The living room is finished in rich
dark colours, has a huge native stone
fireplace, an intimate dining area and
walnut panelled walls. One wall is of
glass and overlooks the patio.
The master bedroom and guest bed-
room features concealed lighting. Be-
tween these two rooms is an elaborate
master bath, and a second bath is
situated in the kitchen-family-room
area.
LEONARDO LIKED PROMPT
PAYMENT.
Discovered while reading:—
“It was a rule of Leonardo da Vinci’s
Not to put his trust in princes.
Pleading was of no avail;
They had to pay up on the nail.”
We wonder how the great artist
would have fared as a builder or
builders’ merchant at the present time.

Festive Opening
of New Office
Premises
Thatcher and Oberg Pty. Ltd.
Celebrates Expansion.
To suitably mark the opening of the
Company’s new office premises in
Durdans Avenue, Rosebery, Thatcher
and Oberg Pty. Ltd. entertained many
guests at a Cocktail Party on July 8.
The occasion marked another step
in the expansion of this progressive
Sydney organisation, and the Directors
received many sincere and hearty com
gratulations from the representatives
of many industries present.
Among these were the President of
the Building Industry Congress, Mr.
Fred. Wilson, 0.8. E., who was ac-
companied by the Executive Director,
Mr. D. Stewart Fraser, Mr. S. D. C.
Kennedy (Kennedy and Bird Pty.
Ltd.), Mr. J. G. Jeffrey (Thomas
Robinson and Sons Pty. Ltd.), Mr.
H. M. Driscoll (Timber Merchant,
Rozelle), Mr. C. Lembke and Mr. C.
A. Lembke (Timber Trades Journal),
Mr. C. Morton (Collector of Cus-
toms), Mr. F. F. Kraegen (Country
Sawmillers of N.S.W.), Mr. A. Os-
borne (General Manager, Commercial
Banking Coy. of Sydney), Mr. A. V.
Martin (Mascot Branch, C.B. of Syd-
ney), Mr. Ken. Mclntyre, Mr. H. R.
McMillan, Mr. F. Sullivan, Mr. B.
Dodson, Mr. L. Rigby, Mr. H. Yard-
ley, Mr. Claude L. Daly, Mr. T.
Shade, Mr. Carl Mitchell, Mr. Arthur
Garland, Mr. R. Wilson, and Mr. Vic.
Paul.
In a happy speech, heard amid
much laughter at his witticisms, Mr.
O. D. A. Oberg welcomed “members
of this distinguished gathering who,
each and all, are my good friends
and associates.”
“On this memorable occasion, we
have with us representatives of every
section of the business life of the city,
gathered here to usher in a new era
for our firm.
“It is fitting that we launch this new
enterprise in your presence, for we
owe much to them, and I and my
fellow directors, pay tribute to your
loyalty, help and support through the
years.”
Mr. Oberg paid individual tribute
to each of the gentlemen present,
“giving each a share in our past,
present, and future success.”
Imposing Offices.
The new offices are imposing in ap-
pearance and are splendidly designed.
The architects responsible were Hen-
nessy, Hennessy and Co., and the
builders were Kelsey Bros., Maroubra
Junction.
GLASS WALLS
Be it factory or house the world today seems
to want glass walls, though some are be-
ginning to realise that one can have too much
sun and that protection by louvre or other
means is desirable. The upper example is
a house in California showing rooms with
large glass areas but which are protected by
extensive cantilever awnings. Below is an
interior of the cafeteria at a Los Angeles pro-
duction plant, in which a similar theme is
employed.

Timber Prices
Reduced
Impetus Given to Home Building.
As from July 9 last timber used for
home building will cost about three
per cent. less.
Timber used for any other purpose
will be increased in price to offset the
reduction,
A wood'frame home will cost about
£5 a square less with the reduced
prices.
The price variation was made at the
request of sawmillers and timber mer-
chants. They told Prices Minister
Finnan that if the application was ap-
proved they would make no applica-
tion to recover increased costs accom-
panying variations in the basic wage
up to next June.
(Home-building timbers constitute
about 60 per cent, of the total timber
cut. The Prices Branch granted an
increase in the price of timber in
September, 1951. The sawmillers have
not sought an increase since then.)
Announcing the cuts in timber
prices, the manager of the Country
Sawmillers of N.S.W., Mr. F. F.
Kraegen, said the reduction would re-
sult in a saving of from to 5 per
cent, on the cost of timber for a
home.
Sawmillers had made the reduction
by making slight offsetting increases
in timber needed for heavy construc-
tion work, Mr. Kraegen said.
Price lists had been revised as an
incentive to intending home-builders
to place prompt orders, he added.
Sawmillers also wished to demon-
strate to the Federal Government a
desire to end the price spiral, in the
hope that the Government would re-
lease credit for home-building.
Mr. Kraegen said: “From today
the price of timber for home-building
can’t go down again.
“It is no good anyone saying: ’The
price has gone down today. I will
wait until next month for it to go
down more.’
“Our decision to absorb basic wage
increases from last November until
next June is unconditional.”
Government Charges.
“But having given the lead, we are
asking the Government to undertake
to stabilise rail freights and taxes on
road haulage of timber at least at the
present levels.
“We feel our humble contribution,
if followed generally by the Govern-
ment and other sections of industry,
would be the means by which our
whole economy would become stabil-
ised.
“Under these conditions prices
could not very well rise except by an
influence outside Australia.
Heavy Costs.
“Freights have increased by 450 per
cent, since 1947.
“In 1947 freight a 100 super feet
was 5/11. Now it is 32/11.
“In the same five years mill costs
have risen from 12/' to 41/' a 100
super feet.
“Total State and Commonwealth
charges amount to 45/' a 100 super
feet, or 38 per cent, of the price de'
livered in Sydney—ll7/6.
“Of this 117/6, the average saw'
miller gets only 5/3 in net profit—
only per cent, of the price.”
“Grave Risk”.
Mr. Kraegen said he realised saw'
millers were taking a grave risk in
undertaking to absorb basic wage rises
from November, 1951, until June,
1953.
He added: “We are gambling on
an improvement in output a man-hour
in the industry.
“There has been an improvement in
man'hour output, but it is not yet
sufficient for us to measure.
“We are not asking our workers to
increase production for our benefit.
“We are asking them to increase
output so we can hand the benefit to
the timber user in the form of lower'
ed prices.”
N.Z.’s House
of the Year
Architects’ Design Award.
Considerable interest has been shown
in a home at Wadestown, Wellington,
N.Z., voted the best designed house
of the year by the N.Z. Institute of
Architects.
To overcome the problems of a
typical Wellington building site —
small and steeply sloping, the house
is built on three levels, with the re'
suit that its lines are more appealing
than those usually associated with a
flat'roofed house.
On the bottom level, in one unit,
are situated the playroom, workshop,
and garage. The middle level con'
tains the living space, and on the top
are bedrooms.
The section is only 16 perches in-
stead of the usual average of 20
perches, and the house occupies about
1600 sq. ft.
The front door opens into a small
hall, well lighted by windows almost
to floor level. To the left is a large
L'shaped living room, to the right six
wide steps ascend to the three bed'
rooms, bathroom and shower room.
Another door, fitted so neatly into
the wall that it is almost imperceptible,
opens into the spacious kitchen.
In the dining end of the living'room
an electric heater is set into the east
wall beneath windows which command
a magnificent vista of the harbour,
and at the other end of the room
three fulMength windows are to the
left of a large fireplace.
The kitchen is divided by cupboard
partitions into three compartments. A
dining alcove is fitted with red leather
seats. In the centre are the long
stainless steel sink,, electric stove and
cupboards galore—including one that
revolves and another in which tea
towels are dried above an element.
In the third section is the ideal
washhouse, with an electric washing
machine and one large tub. Alto'
gether the kitchen contains over 40
cupboards, some fulMength.
BULLDOZING!
Ist Bloque: ‘“Bill and five of his
pals have a job bulldozing on the rail-
way cutting.”
2nd Bloque: “It only takes one man
to operate the bulldozer. What are
the other five doing?”
Ist Bloque: “Just dozing, the cows.”
AN INTERESTING EXTENSION.
These two illustrations show how in the
hands of skilled architects a three-storey
building can be increased to six stories and
still at both stages of development look in
proportion and attractive. The building is
the Farmers’ Insurance Exchange building,
which was erected in Los Angeles in 1937
with three stories and later in 1948 was en-
larged by the addition of three more stories.
Architectural concrete was utilised on both
occasions.

World-Wide Construction
SYDNEY, NEW ALBANY, AND NEW YORK.
Sydney.
This delightful home—the residence
of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Hinder, of
Nelson Gardens —is the site of the
one-time Hinder stables. It is now a
spacious “studio home’’, complete to
the last wish for gracious living.
The old paved stable yard is now
a courtyard with guava trees shading
one end, the last reminders of the
orchard of the old homestead.
The studio itself is divided into two
self-contained sections, used independ-
ently by the owners, for both Mr. and
Mrs. Hinder are artists of international
calibre.
The house proper consists of four
and one-half rooms lit by floor to ceil-
ing windows (see illustration), and a
patio as big as the house.
New Albany, U.S.A.
Presenting the new look in prefab-
rication, the T-shaped dwelling de-
picted in our centre illustration is
Gunnison Homes Inc. (New Albany,
Indiana, U.S.A.), latest contribution
to prefabrication.
Up to now, Gunnisons claim, pre-
fabrication has meant the concentra-
tion upon economy units turned out
with little consideration for the aes-
thetic. Bot now design is becoming
more important, and the new model
departs from the usual rectangular
shape so common with prefabs.
This one features a wide, low-slung
roofline, picture windows, overhang-
ing eaves, and oversized chimney.
The 1952 models also include a
full-sized porch, breezeway, and low-
cost garage.
New York, U.S.A.
The Amalgamated Clothing Work-
ers of America are feeling very proud
of themselves, for the final units of
their vast co-operative housing devel-
opment are now occupied.
This marks the culmination of 25
years of planning and construction,
and the development (see photo, bot'
tom) now houses nearly 10,000 per-
sons in about 2500 units, erected at
a cost of iA8,920,00.
The Amalgamated Houses, as they
are called, were started in New York’s
Bronx in 1926, and the units have
been built without recourse to gov-
eminent or other aids beyond the or-
ganisation’s own initiative and enter-
prise.
The first project was completed in
1927-28, containing 318 units and
1187 rooms. New projects were add-
ed steadily in the Bronx in 1929,
1931, and in 1941. Since the war,
new projects have been added almost
annually.
Glimpses of Other
Lands
Spanish Influence in California.
In the beautiful grounds of the Ho-
tel Del Monte, Del Monte, California,
stands this home of beauty (top). It
is one of the numerous guests’ cot'
tages which tourists may rent for a
period, while they enjoy the awe-in-
spiring grandeur of rolling hills and
distant mountains.
This type of home, Spanish in com
ception, blends admirably with the
rugged setting.
In our centre photo, a Patio House
in California, the architects have tak'
en a difficult plot and turned its dis'
advantages into assets.
This home is a modern adaptation
of the Spanish, rendered in a free
way. In harmony with its precedent
the home enjoys the softening influ'
ence of texture walls and subdued
tiles. By placing an outside stairs,
access is given to the spacious, shelter'
ed patio without having to go indoors.
Our glimpse of the ornate Mont'
erey Peninsular Country Club, Cali'
fornia (bottom) reflects once again
the wide influence of Spanish archi'
tecture in Californian buildings of all
kinds.
Built of stone, stucco, sun-baked
bricks and hand'dressed native timber,
it is expressive, in its architecture, of
that hardy, romantic pioneer spirit
which even today marks the American
West.
The wide verandahs, opening upon
a large patio, commands a magnifi'
cent view of the distant Pacific Ocean.

Gypsum-The Rock
of Industry
Gypsum rock, one of the most an-
cient building materials used by man-
kind, can be met with in some form
every day in the modern world.
It is found in a number of forms,
including the beautiful, delicately tint-
ed and translucent Alabaster. The
word Gypsum, however, is mainly ap-
plied to the massive rock-like variety
widely distributed throughout the
world. Gypsum in the natural state
is so soft that it can be scratched with
the thumb nail.
It was probably first discovered
when men began to construct dwel-
lings from rock and discovered the
necessity of filling up the gaps be-
tween the rough stones. Such a soft
substance of gypsum would naturally
suggest the idea of crushing it to
powder and making a paste which
could be used as a kind of grouting
in the crevices of buildings.
Gypsum has become indispcnsible
in many fields. It is used in enorm-
ous quantities as plaster-of-paris,
which is simply burnt gypsum ground
to a fine powder. It is the only nat-
ural subject known which will con-
geal into its original rock after being
mixed with water only.
One very important quality of gyp-
sum is its excellent resistance to fire,
thus greatly enhancing its use for ceil-
ings and wall-boards in the home and
other constructions.
Rock or massive gypsum is gener-
ally found in the form of thick veins.
Extensive deposits occur in all States
of the Commonwealth and production
started in 1909. In 1951 more than
12,500,000 sq. yds. of fibrous plaster
were produced in Australia.
Method of Processing.
The gypsum is hewed out in the
regular way and sent to huge grind-
ing machines which reduce it to powd-
er. The pulverised rock is sent to
huge “kettles”, where it is boiled; this
is possible because of the high water
content of gypsum crystals, and the
kettle process forces most of the water
out by evaporation, and the hot powd-
er is carried by pipes to the tube mill.
This mill is a series of big revolv-
ing steel cylinders filled with steel
balls, which reduce the gypsum to a
fine white powder form.
New Development.
A new £500,000 factory has recent-
ly been built at Vassiliko, on the south
coast of Cyprus, and is now making
gypsum plaster at the rate of 6000
tons a month and plasterboard at the
rate of 250,000 sq. yds. a month.

Strangely enough, Australia is re'
ported to be interested in buying
plasterboard made in Cyprus.
Construction of the huge factory
started three years ago, and it is the
outcome of the discovery, in 1938, of
a pyrites mine.
Vassiliko was chosen as the most
logical spot for processing and ex'
porting the mineral, and installations
were put up to handle the new indus'
try.
As Vassiliko is not a port, a huge
concrete pylon was erected out at sea,
where ships can now anchor and re'
ceive loads of mineral carried to their
holds by aerial ropeway.
Hawaiian Timber
Industry
Redwoods Now Being Milled.
Twenty'five years ago, 1000 red'
wood yearlings were transplanted from
California to Hawaii.
A few weeks ago, the first coast
redwood tree. 88ft. tall and 14 inches
in diameter —was felled and milled.
The redwood trees have made re'
markable progress since their trans'
planting, and the timber is especiallv
useful in tropical countries, because
it resists termites and decay and has
less shrinkage than other commonly
used wood.
Its handsome reddish colour is de'
rived from complex chemicals, which
penetrate every cell and make it dur'
able and resistant to insects.
Since the glacial age the coast red'
woods have been native only to the
coast of California and Southern Cali'
fornia.
They and the big trees (Sequoia
Gigantea), of the Sierra Mountains
and the dawn redwoods of China, arc
the three known survivors of a family
that once spread across the whole
northern hemisphere.
In Many Countries.
Under Modern forestry practices,
redwoods are once again thriving in
many parts of the globe, besides
Hawaii.
Seeds from the famous General
Sherman Sequoia, one of the oldest
and largest in California, were sent in
1945 to the 50 United Nations at'
tending the San Francisco Conference.
Giant Sequoia seeds have been
planted in the Himalaya foothills to
increase India’s forests.
In Alaska, Dawn Sequoia seedlings
are growing again for the first time
in about 35 million years.
South Africa has planted numerous
redwoods as shade trees, and many
are flourishing in eastern U.S.A., as
far north as Pennsylvania.
DEATH OF HARRY BATSFORD.
Well-Known Publisher.
The death occurred recently of
Mr. Harry Batsford. Chairman and
Managing Director of B. T. Batsford
Ltd., welhknown British publisher of
architectural and travel books.
The firm of Batsford was founded
in 1843, when Harry Batsford’s grand'
father first opened a small bookshop
at 30 High Holborn, and in 1862 the
firm launched on the publishing of
engineering and architectural books,
perhaps the most famous of which is
“The History of Architecture” a
book that is in practically every archh
tectural student’s hands.
It was largely due to Harry Batsford
that the firm embarked on its highly
successful policy of popularising books
on architecture and the countryside,
and together with C. D. Fry he was
the author of three of them —“Homes
and Gardens of England,” “The Face
of Scotland” and “The Cathedrals of
England.”
Mr. Batsford was made an Honorary
Associate of The Royal Institute of
British Architects in 1926.

Cement Making Progress In Queensland
By F. O. NIXON.
Not long ago, the daily Press
facetiously reported the purchase by
the Queensland Cement and Lime Co.
Ltd. of a vessel “with legs” which
would ultimately “walk” on the bot-
tom of the ocean bed where it was
shallow enough to dredge coral.
Actually, this 4000-ton mass of steel
does move on two legs—-alternately, it
should be stated —and they are quite
consequential sticks, too, of good
Queensland hardwood built up to 4ft.
by 4ft. (Hardwood timbers 14ins. by
14ins. were in common use in build-
ings before the steel age began.) Of
their 65ft. length, about 12ft. will be
driven into the sea bed at Mud Island,
about five miles to the mouth of the
Brisbane River at the south-eastern end
of Moreton Bay.
The Queensland Cement and Lime
Coy. Ltd. for the past 30 years or
more have been operating until re-
cently by using limestone transported
over 200 miles by railway from the
Western township of Gore. About 10
years ago, the Professor of Geology
at the Queensland University the
late Dr. H. C. Richards suggested
that coral would be a very suitable
alternative to limestone, and the Com-
pany investigated the possibilities by
dredging coral from Moreton Bay at
the mouth of the Brisbane River.
Dredging Coral.
This method of getting coral raised
difficulties and required a dredger and,
later, a carrier, which was added to
augment the supply. The present
method is for the “Kione” (the
dredger) to dredge coral and deliver
(while dredging) over the side of the
dredge into the carrier. The latter,
when filled with 2000 tons of coral,
makes the trip to the cement works,
drops the load into the river bed, and
returns to the dredger for other loads.
Meantime, grabs are used to recover
the coral from the bed of the river at
Darra, where it is loaded into trucks
for the mile journey to the works.
Increasing demand for cement means
more coral is required, and so a ship
has been bought and is being convert-
ed into a dredger. This ship was an
L.S.T. (landing ship tank) with a
length of 330 ft., beam 54ft. and, if
used for cargo, would carry about 6000
tons.
The conversion consists of cutting
away the large landing doors at the
bow of the ship, and the large ramp
(which was used for embarking and
disembarking tanks at a beach landing
during the war), and forming a well.
In the well, a large hinged ladder
having cutter heads on the end will be
fitted to “chew” up the coral reef.
Behind the cutters, large pipes about
I6ins. in diameter will run from the
cutters in through the ship to large
pumps, which will suck water and
coral into the pipes. From here, the
coral and water will be diverted up-
ward, through the deck, and over the
side of the ship into the carrier along-
side. It is expected to fill the carrier
(in normal weather) in about three
hours.
While dredging, land wires operated
by a winch at the bow will be made
fast ashore on Mud Island. At the
stern two large “spuds” 4ft. square,
65ft. long, and each weighing about
nine tons will be fitted, and it will be
made possible to lift or lower them
down into the bottom of the ship and
“bite” them into the coral bottom of
the seashore.
Method of Dredging.
It is intended that the method of
dredging will be by using one spud,
swinging the bow of the ship on this
pivot through an arc of about 60 de-
grees. Having completed one swing,
the second “spud” will be dropped
and the first “spud” lifted, allowing a
new arc to be dredged. The advan-
tage of this type of dredging is that
very soon the dredger is working in a
dredged-out basin, with the advantage
of calmer conditions for both the
dredger and the carrier alongside.
Furthermore, the coral bed is being
swept clear, free of ridges.
As this dredge will not be able to
propel herself, since the boilers, pro-
pellers, etc., have all been removed,
it is anticipated that once she has
dredged a bed for herself no difficulty
is likely to occur to the operations
over the whole season of good and
bad weather in Moreton Bay.
A conservative estimate of the coral
potentialities is 80 years of cement
making, even allowing for the addi-
tional boiler power and kilns now
about to be installed at the works.
A walk through this floating mass
of metal with Mr. H. N. White,
Scottish shipbuilder in charge of the
alterations, is a revelation of heights
to which engineering and shipbuilding
skill and initiative to meet new prob-
lems arose in the Empire’s crucial days
of World War 11. As a transport for
large numbers of men, tanks, and
other heavy vehicles entering through
the opening doors in the bow, a great
deal of “B” deck space was available
for cabins and other amenities for
human living.
For obvious reasons there were no
portholes through which even one
small glimmer of artificial light could
have been fatal, so air-conditioning
privided the ventilation. In recon-
structing the living portion of the
ship, in which some 15 to 20 men will
be accommodated away from their
homes, substantial oblong openings
have been cut to provide the more
natural ventilation and day-lighting.
The vessel’s original provision of twin
screws are things of the past, while
the twin rudders are also superfluous.
Though the L.S.T’s power of propul-
sion will have gone for ever, its power-
ful Diesel engines will operate the
various mechanical contrivances and
be the means of producing light,
shifting ship, etc..
And so this ship built for destruc-
tion will now play its part in helping
to build up real wealth from dormant
coral beds.

three or four ply yarns, which are

Dyeing.
Once again the yarn is scoured to
render it as completely free from iim
purities as possible. Tests are carried
out in the laboratory, an expert selects
the exact colour of woollen yarn—a
sample of which has been dyed to
an exact formula—which he considers
interprets the artist’s colour design for
the completed carpet, and then the
hanks go to the dyehouse to be dyed
to the formula of the colour required.
A careful check is kept on temperature
control and chemical consistency.
After being dyed the yarn proceeds
to a hydro'extractor where most of the
moisture is removed, and it is then,
in a semi'dry state, placed on stainless
steel racks for even drying to eliminate
any ■ patchiness, while the final stages
of drying are being carried out in the
continuous hot'drying machine. The
finished coloured yarns are then sent
to store ready for weaving.
In due course the yarn is wound on
to wooden bobbins ready for the
looms. The cotton and jute, mainly
from India, which are to form the
warp of the finished carpet in an
operation known as “beaming,” are
wound on to large spools called “warp
beams.”

the Gripper Spool Method. In the
latter method the artist’s squared'
paper design, each square of which
represents one tuft of the final carpet,
is used as a guide, and dyed yarns,
'corresponding in colour with each row
of squares across the design, are wound
on to the spools, which when used in
the looms govern the width of the
carpet to be made, be it 27in., 36in.,
in which case the spools are set up
singly or with three in line for the
9ft. wide carpet.
The spools in the weaving operation
become part of an endless chain which
gives a continuous repetition of the
pattern being woven.
The spools are placed in the loom
in their correct order and, as the
weaving is carried out, each thread is
caught by the jaws of the gripper as
they work in unison. Sharp blades
then sever these tufts at the required
length and these are then inserted
into the fabric and the ends are turned
up to form a V'shape before, in the
final operation, it is packed tightly
into the carpet weave.
The Jacquard System.
With the Jacquard system (named
ifter the Frenchman who invented it)
:ards are punched with holes, rather
'ike a pianola record, and the holes
md blanks so formed correspond to
:he design of the carpet to be woven.
When fed into a Jacquard loom these
:ards have the effect of automatically
selecting only the yarn threads that
have been called for by the master
design and colour.
With the weaving completed, the
work of finishing off is ready to com'
mence. The first operation, known as
“brushing,” is carried out by a machine
in which circular brushes bring up the
pile. It then passes over a steaming
chamber which fills out each tuft and
gives the carpet a full, even texture.
The final operation is passing through
the shearing machine where whirring
blades ensure that it emerges with a
perfectly level surface.
Prior to undergoing these various
mechanical finishing operations, every
inch of the carpet as it leaves the
looms is minutely checked over by ex-
pert needlewomen who pick up and
correct any imperfections and ensure
as thoroughly as is humanly possible
that the carpet that leaves the modern
plant of Carpet Manufacturers Ltd. is
a first'dass product in every way.
OIL SEARCH ODDS.
The odds are 8 to 1 against bring'
ing in a producing well in an area
where oil has never been found be'
fore. Of the 6189 new field ex'
ploratory wells drilled in the United
States of America last year 5505 were
dry holes.
The odds are even greater against
finding a big producing area. For in'
stance, the chances of bringing in an
oilfield yielding over 1,000,000 barrels
are 48 to 1, and the odds against
finding a field that will yield over
50,000,000 barrels are a staggering
966 to 1. A one million barrel field
would be sufficient to fill America’s
needs for only one'sixth of a day.

Disinfection and Sterilisation of the Air
ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS AND ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATION.
The problem of de-germing the air,
of disinfection and sterilisation of in-
side air is still in the earlier stages of
general application, though its im-
portance for personal health, as well
as for safety of products, is being
more recognised from year to year.
A Hiost comprehensive study on air
disinfection was published in London
by R. B. Bourdillon and his co-
investigators in which ten different
kinds of air disinfection were reviewed.
(1) .Daylight and sunlight lower the
mean content of air-borne and dust-
borne bacteria and other germs.
(2) Natural ventilation, when prac-
ticable, is an excellent means of air
disinfection.
(3) Mechanical ventilation is re-
liable when it is properly installed and
operated and giving not less than four
air changes per hour.
(4) Recirculation of ai r through
cleaning plants has a definite value
when the cleaning system is efficient
and gives at least four air changes per
hour.
(5) Ultra-violet radiation has poten-
tial value provided it is correctly in-
stalled. It deals chiefly with fine par-
ticles. With screened lamps placed 7
to Bft. above the floor, attention must
also be paid to the vertical circulation
of air in the room. Since ultra-violet
radiation “is relatively ineffective
against dust-borne organisms,” it is de-
sirable to combine its use with some
method of dust control.
(6) Chemical disinfection of air is
less effective on the larger dust-borne
particles than on fine particles. Most
chemical methods need some daily or
weekly attention, and they may become
unsatisfactory if neglected. The main-
tenance of effective concentrations of
chemical disinfectants is complicated
by the degree of anti-bacterial action
desired (killing or attenuation), the
instability of some chemical agents in
presence of air and dust, and the toxic
or irritant properties of the agents.
(7) Sterilisation by heat is the most
effective method for complete sterilisa-
tion of air provided the volume of air
brief period—one second—to 300 to
is not excessive. Air heated for a
350 degrees Centigrade during passage
through a furnace is sterile.
(8) Electrostatic application, ap-
plied in conjunction with a mechanical
ventilation or recirculation system, is
efficient with all sizes of particles.
(9) Dust control is an important
factor in air hygiene. Coating of
floors with a dust-laying compound,
oiling of textile materials during laun-
dering and avoidance of sweeping with
a dry brush are procedures which arc
efficient in dust control.
(10) The use of masks for the pre-
vention of air pollution and for the
protection of individuals, while not
strictly a means of air disinfection, de-
serves more attention than it ordinarily
receives.
Ultra-violet Air
Sterilisation.
Of the ten points mentioned in
Bourdillon’s report, sterilisation of air
by ultra-violet rays has been in the
focus of attention for quite a while,
and observations in hospitals and sick-
rooms, in theatres, churches, etc., have
convinced quite a few experts that air
sanitation with ultra-violet light is pos-
sible and effectful.
Number of Lamps
Required.
Here is an example how to calcu-
late the number of lamps required for
ultra-violet protection.
It is based on the use of “Steri-
lamps,” constructed by Westinghouse
Electric Corporation, in a typical
schoolroom 24ft. wide by 30ft. long,
with a ceiling height of 12ft. Since
the fixtures are to be mounted 7ft.
above the floor, the distance from the
fixture to the ceiling is sft. The
recommended ultra-violet intensity in
the air volume above the fixture is 20
milliwatts per cubic foot.
In a room with these dimensions,
with a fixture mounted in the centre
of the 30ft. length, one watt of lamp
ultra-violet output provides an average
intensity of 1.2 milliwatts per cubic
foot of irradiated air, with either
louvred or non-louvred fixtures.
The 30-watt Hot Cathoder Sterilamp
used has an ultra-violet output of 8.4
watts. Since the bulb of this lamp is
of No. 9741 glass, a maintenance
factor of 0.70 may be used if the
cleaning schedule and atmospheric con-
ditions are average.
The number of germicidal lamps re-
quired for the irradiation of a room is
being calculated on the basis of the
following formula:
No. of Recommended Intensity
Lamps Intensity per Lamp Watt of UV x Lamp Watts of UV x MF
or, by using the figures mentioned—
No. of 20
Lamps 1.2 x 8.4 x .70
= 2.8
AIR STERILIZATION.
On the left over the blackboard and over the double doors at the end of the schoolroom germi-
cidal “Sterlilamps” are installed. They are a product of the Westinghouse Electric Corpora-
tion. On the right is a five-pocket deep-bed air filter manufactured by the American Air Filter
Co., of Louilville. Both these items of equipment play their part in freeing the air from
bacteria. Insert below the air filtor is a germicidal sterilamp for use in hospital operating
rooms, pharmaceutical houses and for food preparation. A product of Westinghouse Electric
Corporation.

Face and Eye Protection.
Wherever direct exposure to germi-
cidal energy is higher than 0.0035
uv-watt-hours/ft. 2 , or .25 uv-watt-
minutes/ft. 2 , i.e., an exposure of 7
hours to an intensity of 0.0005 uv-
watts/ft. 2 , measures should be taken to
provide good face and eye protection.
As General Electric states, exposure
for one minute 18 inches from a bare
30-watt germicidal tube, or for one
hour or more 12 feet from the same
tube would be considered excessive,
Reliable protection is that provided by
fibre-transparent plastic face-shields.
To avoid painful burns, the hands
and face may be protected from short
exposure by the liberal use of yellow
petroleum jelly or from long exposure
by the use of gloves and face masks.
For ultra-violet - irritated eyes the
usual first-aid treatment is to drop
sweet oil into the eyes and to apply
ice-packs.
The general, constant use of disin-
fectant vapours in schools, barracks
and specialised industrial environments
is not justified at the present time,
according to the American Medical
Journal. Neither is there justification
for indiscriminate use of such vapours
in homes, offices or places where per-
sons congregate freely.
Electro-static Precipitation
of Germs.
Bacteriologists believe that bacteria
utilise dust particles as their means of
locomotion. Consequently, an air fil-
ter which removes dust should also re-
move germs. Tests made on electro-
static precipitators have shown removal
of germs in 98 and 99 per cent, in
many instances. Precipitators of this
type give a high efficiency even on
extremely small dust particles, in the
sub-micron size. One of these types
is the Electro-Matic precipitator a
self-cleaning type of electronic filter
which for many occasions is used as
air filter for germs of any kind.
In an electro-static precipitator, all
particles are electrically charged as they
pass through the high voltages ionis-
ing screens. These particles are then
attracted and adhere to the collecting
plates as a piece of metal is attracted
by a magnet.
Manufacturers of electronic air
cleaners like to explain that the average
human being inhales more than 2000
gallons of air every twenty-four hours,
and its weight is about seven times
greater than the food and water con-
sumed in the same period. Each cubic
foot of air in the average American
city contains from 500,000 to 2,000,000
particles of dust, dirt and pollen.
Control in Industry.
Control of air contamination to-day
plays a big part in industry, though
de-germing the air is not as important
in industry as the removal of un-
pleasant or noxious dusts, fumes, mists,
gases and vapours. In hospital rooms,
in sick rooms, on the other hand, as
well as in rooms where people gather,
the problem of removing sickness-
producing germs of the air is urgent,
and transmission of many diseases
could be avoided if the air which
people inhale could be free from in-
fection-carrying bacteria.

Dry Rot Costs U.K.
Millions
War Conditions Cause of Increase.
Dry rot had cost the U.K. £1 million
a year in the years immediately before
the war against £2O millions today,
according to Mr. K. J. Lindy, well'
known London architect.
Speaking at Cambridge on the ne-
cessity for timber preservation in
every-day building, Mr. Lindy said
that, even accepting the rise in costs
of repair and the value of irreparable
buildings over that period, “the in-
creased incidence of the disease is
very alarming.”
Mr. Lindy was addressing the sec-
ond annual conference of the British
Wood Preserving Association, which
was attended by experts from the Com-
monwealth, U.S.A., and European
countries.
He said there seemed little doubt
that conditions brought about by the
war were responsible for the increase
of infestation.
Huge Losses.
“The estimated loss to Britain of
£2O million a year was supported by
the fact that one property-owning com-
pany in London alone had spent
£30,000 a year on dry-rot elimination
for the past five years and had not
reached the end of the story yet,” Mr.
Lindy told the convention.
He said that in the world of tim-
ber diseases the appropriate preven-
tive medicines were known.
“What is now required is an un-
derstanding by the Building Trade and
public of the present-day risks of not
using them,” he added.

The Styrene Story
New Paint Development.
In the opinion of scientists and
trade observers recently returned from
England, the introduction of Styrene
will open a new era in painting in
Australia. Since it was first marketed
several years ago in Britain it has rev-
olutionised the entire conception of
pigmentation.
Briefly Styrene is a development of
the chemistry of plastics and it im-
parts sensational qualities of water re-
sistance, gloss retention and durabil-
ity. Styrenated paints are now bein
manufactured in Australia and will
soon be launched on the local market.
The possibilities of styrene were
first recognised by scientists during
wartime research for substitutes for
short-stocked linseed oil and its de-
velopment has been a triumph for
English research laboratories.
For years Styrene—a substance de-
rived from coal tar, later from petrol-
eum cracking—was merely a bottle on
the laboratory shelf. It became im-
portant only when scientists found it
invaluable in the manufacture of syn-
thetic rubber. Captured documents
revealed that Germany was using Sty-
rene in her synthetic development.
Styrene is a clear substance, produc-
ed as a solution when derived from
petroleum. Recent patents have made
it possible to incorporate styrene in
oils. It is particularly water-resistant.
Paints have always contained resins to
make them water-resistant. First, nat-
ural resins were used (kauri gum and
other vegetable resins). Then chem-
ists made synthetic resins.
Polymerisation.
Styrenated paint does not involve
only the addition of styrene to oils
and pigments. It is an entirely new
process for the styrene is polymerised
by reacting it with the oil in huge
kettles of about 1,000 gallons capac-
ity made of stainless steel. Polymeris-
ation is the chemical term of the pro-
cess by which a substance can build
on itself time and time again. The
Styrene under polymerisation will
transform itself from a watery consist-
ency to a liquid of high viscosity and
finally to plastic solid.
As the Styrene is much more vola-
tile than the oil, it is necessary to
have condensers over the kettles to
return the Styrene to the oil as it re-
acts. When the Styrene is polymer-
ised (thickened) with the oil the
eventual styrenated oil is blended with
the pigments.
Harder and More Water-resistant.
Styrenated exterior house paint
gives a harder, more water-resistant
surface than ordinary paints attain and
it will dry over-night to a degree
which a pure oil paint won't reach in
days, for the expert will tell you that
paint is not “dry” when dry to the
touch—it is a long process.
The story of the development of
Styrene is a romantic one.
The idea that the substance might
be of value was born out of the bitter
necessities of the days of the wartime
shortages when Britain’s sea lifelines
daily grew more attenuated and scient-
ists sharpened their wits to battle
against ever - mounting production
crises. Stocks of linseed oil were be-
coming dangerously low in 1942 and
all British paint companies were search-
ing for satisfactory alternatives.
Research chemists of Lewis Berger
6? Sons (Great Britain) Ltd., going
back to their previous experience in
the plastics industry, urged that the
possibilities of using Styrene or a
modification of the substance should
be investigated and as a result pro-
duced a styrenated oil which showed
great promise as a paint medium. This
process was immediately transferred
to a small commercial plant where
the potentialities of the substance
were soon proven.

Until the end of the war styrene
was imported from the United States
but postwar dollar shortages threat'
ened to call a halt. Fresh supplies
.available from the new petroleum oil
cracking plants in England would not
suffice even the demands of the fast
developing plastics industry and the
whole project seemed doomed. Then
a subsidiary organisation of an oil
cracking plant revealed that one of its
waste products contained styrene
which could not be economically sep'
arated from the solvent Xylei and the
company offered Berger this product
for what it was worth. Bergers re'
ceived the offer with enthusiasm be'
cause Xylol was the solvent used in
the styrenated oil process and only
required the addition of oil for pro'
cessing.
The potentialities of the process
were considered to be of such national
importance that the Berger Company
released its patent claims to make them
available to a joint company. Styrene
Co'Polymer Ltd. to sponsor styrenat'
ed oils to the paint industry as a
whole.
The sum total of the experience of
the English research has been now
made available to Australian scientists
and new styrenated paints adapted to
Australian climate and conditions have
been formulated in local laboratories.
The Common Gold
In Industry
Colds Leading Cause of Absenteeism.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEMER,
New York.
The common cold is responsible for
more lost time in industry than is any
other cause of disability.
And that is true despite the fact
that wage'earners often endure colds
without staying away from work.
Statements by the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company indicate that from
40 to 50 per cent, of all days lost
from work in industry are caused by
coulds and their complications.
Most Colds on Mondays.
It is a strange fact that more indus'
trial workers catch colds on Monday
than on any other day of the week.
Why is that so?
The reason is not quite clear, but it
seems that weekend life is not always
healthy enough to prevent such urn
pleasant interruption of normal life.
Here are some more statistical facts
about the common colds. Cases of
common cold outnumber any other
disease 25 to 1. If you are an average
industrial worker, you will lose three
to four days a year due to simple colds
without complications. Only 6 per
cent, of people in the United States
and Canada have no cold during the
year, while 60 per cent, have two or
three colds.
More than 60,000,000 days are lost
to industry a year because of colds,
according to the Metropolitan Life.
All in all, the cost of the common cold
to the American people is well over
a billion dollars a year.
The largest number of colds occur
in the 20 to 29 year age group, the
lowest in the age group above 50
years. The latter though are more
serious.
If you are working in an office you
have more chance to get a cold than
when working in a factory or machine
shop. The smallest percentage of time'
losing colds was found among those
who walk about at their jobs, and the
highest percentage among those who
mostly sit at their jobs.
Sudden drops in temperature are
followed by rises in the incidence and
severity of colds. In a dusty factory"
room the worker catches cold easier
than in a room free of dust. Dust
irritates the mucous membranes of

nose, throat and bronchi, diminishing
thereby the resistance against colds.
Irritating fumes, produced by melting
products and chemicals materials, may
produce a sore throat or cough which
makes sensitive to more serious illness.
What Causes Colds?
Low temperature is not as dangerous
as the contact with cold-infected per-
sons. Fridtjof Nansen never had a
cold while he was in arctic regions.
In Spitzbergen miners live in steam-
ing, overheated houses which they
leave to walk to their work through
bitter cold and terrific winds. Still,
there was no sign of illness. But
when a steamer arrived and a sniffling
crew came ashore, 84 of the 500
people in Spitzbergen got a cold.
Most doctors agree that common
colds are caused by a virus, a poisonous
substance produced by a germ, or
something like that. However, some
doctors believe that colds come from
cold. Dr. W. J. Kerr, of the Univer-
sity of California, tried hard to infect
people with another person’s cold.
Healthy people would play cards for
hours next to a sneezing, sniffling
victim. Others drank from glasses
smeared with a cold sufferer’s sputum.
But those healthy human guinea-pigs
failed to catch colds.
The fact that a cold is not trans-
mitted from person to person by a
virus, Dr. Kerr points out, is shown
by the fact that a person living on the
top of a mountain, a hundred miles
away from any other human being,
will still catch cold if he gets chilled.
Such theories are of practical im'
portance. They show that for pre'
venting colds it is necessary to beware
of chilling. Avoiding draughts in
home and plant and office, proper
temperature and the right degree of
humidity, little dust, and proper cloth'
ing both indoors and outdoors arc
more important, according to such
opinion, than destroying bacteria in
the air by ultraviolet light and similar
procedures.
The climate, strange as it sounds,
has less to do with colds than the
weather. There are just as many colds
in Southern California as there are in
New England or windy Chicago. Get'
ting accustomed to the weather may
beat the inclination to repeated colds:
the weather-proof locomotive engineer
in his draughty cab is not as likely
to catch colds as the passengers in the
stuffy cars behind.
Different Workers
Are Different.
A machine operator is working in a
well-tempered room in which the door
is opened occasionally for a short
while. Every time he starts sneezing
he feels pain in his right ear. The
man who is working next to him can*
not understand why that is so. He
enjoys nothing better than a rush of
fresh air from the open door or win'
dow, even on chilly days.
And both are right! People are
different. They act and react dif'
ferently against colds.
The Roman Emperor Augustus was
so susceptible to draughts and colds
that he could not walk in his back'
yard without having his head covered.
The same man when leaving his
home in the morning can stand very
well the draught in the train or sub'
way. By night, when he returns home
—tired, worn'out, hungry—the same
kind of draught gives him a cold.
Bitter cold or a strong wind at the
corner of a building may be dan'
gerous, but let’s be more suspicious of
the slight draught near the window
or along a stone floor where machines
are mounted.
Russian physicians have made extern
sive studies on colds and influenza
(grippe) in industry on more than
9,000,000 workers. Two points seem
all important to them: overcrowding
and lack of ventilation of factories in

winter. Industries where workers are
most crowded show the highest in'
cidence of colds and influenza.
They have stated a comparatively
low frequency of influenza in the metal
industry, this seems to be due to ab-
sence of overcrowding, more so than
to protective effects of radiation by
arc welding, etc.
Most Colds Have
A Happy Ending.
Most colds have a quick and happy
ending. Still, a nasal infection may
spread downward into the throat and
bronchi, or upward into the sinuses,
or through the ear trumpets to the
middle ear. Fortunately, most troubles
disappear with proper behaviour and
treatment.
For those workers who are sensitive
to colds, the word CAUTION is not
meaningless. It means first of all the
right kind of clothing. Do not fail
to use another sweater or a scarf if
you feel cold in winter. A healthy
way of living, with plenty of sleep
and no overindulgence in food will
reduce the inclination to colds.
Modern prevention methods try to
sterilize the air by antiseptic sprays and
irradiation with ultra-violet light.
Churches, schools, movie houses, bar-
ber shoos, etc., make use of the
method of ultra-violet irradiation to
prevent transmission of infectious
colds .
Authoritative medical opinion sup-
ports the view that no substance or
combination of substances available at
present can be relied on to prevent or
cure the common cold. This is de-
cidedly true also for certain drugs
which have been advertised in exag-
gerated manner.
Industrial physicians do not like to
have people around in plants and
factories and offices who are sniffling
and coughing all the time. They
would prefer to send them home so
as not to spread the infection to other
workers and employees.
It is frequently possible to check a
beginning cold at its onset. Heat is
the best # remedy, by external as well
as internal methods; hot water bottles,
electric pad, hot bath or shower, rest
in bed—and internally promoted by
hot tea or lemonade. Aspirin, the old
household remedy, gives excellent pro-
tection against a developing cold.
There is some truth in the old say-
ing: If you keep your head cool and
your feet warm, you will avoid colds,
though it is not true in every case.
The old-fashioned method of a hot
foot bath, possibly with mustard, may
be connected with this belief.
A diet preferring fruit and fruit
juices, especially the citrus fruits
will be helpful. But diet in well-
nourished people is of little im-
HOSPITAL DESIGN IN DENMARK.
There is no more instructive design analysis in modern building than that of the large modern
hospital and experts in this field in all countries are continually visiting each other’s countries
to study the most recent examples so as to be right up-to-lhe-minute. These two drawings
were submitted in a recent competition held in Denmark for the design of a large hospital
and the manner in which the main block is planned and oriented and the subsidiary units
located in relation to the main building and the site is of particular interest. The new
hospital is to be erected in Glostrup, Denmark, and the successful competitors were two
Finnish architects.

portance in the treatment of colds.
Dr. H. A. Reimann, of Jeffer-
son Medical College, Philadelphia, is
surely right by saying: “We only add-
to the patient’s misery by eliminating
the foods he likes or insisting upon
foods he hates.”
Alcoholic drinks are recommended
by some physicians to people who can
stand them. However, the prescrip-
tion how to treat a cold, advocated by
a 18th-century British doctor, is more
amusing than scientific: “To hang
one’s hat on the bedpost, drink from
a bottle of good whisky until two
hats appear, and then get into bed and
stay there.”
For the decrease in the swelling of
the mucosas of the nose there are many
oils and drugs which are dropped or
sprayed into the nostrils. They will
help to reduce the swelling of the
mucous membranes at least temporarily
and thus bring relief and increase the
working ability.
One of the safest preventive methods
after contact with cold-infected people
is washing the hands with soap and
water and gargling with salt water or
any disinfecting, alcohol - containing
mouth wash.
—Dr. W. Schweishemer, New York.
Modern Homes
“Outdated”
A prominent U.S. architect said re-
cently that the modern home was “al-
ready obsolete”.
He is Mr. George Nelson, a na-
tionally known architectural teacher,
editor and designer, who claims that
the house of the future will not be a
house at all in the familiar sense.
Mr. Nelson said that future homes
will be a space container, a precisely
engineered and manufactured shell,
providing space conditioned to serve
requirements of the occupants.
“Partitions in the shell will be mov-
able”, he added.
The house, as -visualised by Mr.
Nelson, would be set in a year-round
garden, with brightly-coloured sleep-
ing pavilions placed nearby around it.

Underground Garage
At Hyde Park
Need Again Urged.
Mr. George Cooper, who was form'
erly the City Council’s parks super-
intendent, last week again urged the
building of an underground garage
at Hyde Park.
He said the plan for such a project
had not been implemented only be-
cause laymen are in authority in the
City Council and tell experts what to
do.
Mr. Cooper said that if the garage
was built it would take a large volume
of private cars off the streets of
Sydney.
He said he first suggested to the
Council in 1924 that the garage
should be built, and proposed that the
whole underground area of Hyde
Park should be used and that traffic
enter and leave by College Street.
This, he added, would lessen the
congestion in Elizabeth Street and ad-
jacent thoroughfares.

Britain Builds Better Homes
at Lower Costs
MAXIMUM HOUSES FROM MINIMUM MATERIALS. LABOUR
AND CAPITAL.
New Designs Bring Speed and Economy.
In few, if any, countries in the world is housing keeping pace with
population. But housing is without doubt the most urgent and vital of all
social services—for the home is the basis of the family just as families are
the basis of nations.
Britain, and many other countries,
needed more houses, and quickly, and
while Australia lag? far behind and
pathetically behind, Britain, under her
(new virile leadership, is doing some'
thing about it.
Recently, the British Ministry of
Housing and Local Government is'
sued a handbook to assist local autho'
rities to “built the maximum number
of houses from a limited supply of
materials, labour, and capital.”
In fuller details, recently to hand,
Mr. R. Sampson describes in the
“Imperial Review" these houses as
being essentially for requirements in
Britain, where the average winter
temperature is 43 degrees F. But, it
is thought that with, or without,
slight modifications the houses will be
equally suitable for erection in many
highly industrialised locations within
the British Commonwealth and Em-
pire, or elsewhere.
To achieve economy, Mr. Sampson
continues, the design of the houses is
of prime importance. But of course,
further economies can be effected in
housing layouts, construction of roads
and services, and the use of terraced
construction in place of semi'detached
houses.
Economy in Design.
Any weak link in the chain of
planning to completion leads to de'
lays and waste of time and money.
The architect, for instance, must de'
sign economically and before work
begins supply the builder with all de'
tails necessary for completion. It is
then the job of the builder to or'
ganise the site work for quick build'
ing.
The plans cover two'bedroom and
three' bedroom houses divided into
four groups as follows: —Group I
plans the houses, on orthodox lines
with reduced circulation space.
Group II also on orthodox lines,
gives variations in the method of ac'
cess from the front to the back of the
house. Group 111 is the “dining
hall” house with stairs rising from the
dining space, and Group IV is the
large living room house with stairs
rising from the living room and
wholc house heating.
Varying Factors.
The plans are based on the varying
factors (a) whether separate access
from the entrance hall to the kitchen
is provided, (b) how access is to be
given from the front to the back of
the house, (c) whether storage is
outside or within the house, and (d)
the use of a particular type of heating
installation.
The houses in Group I are semi'
detached houses for four or five per'
sons. In the terraced houses access
to the rear of the house is by cover'
ed passage common to two houses.
In the semi'detached house access to
the rooms on the ground floor is from
the hall. The nett house area of these
buildings ranges from 679'855 sq. ft.
[ln Australia we “clamped down” on
1250 feet as a maximum, but this was
afterwards extended. During the
period when these restrictions main'
tamed, few if any dreamt of utilising
less space than they were permitted
to use.l
In Group II the store is in the
front of the house and includes fuel
storage. The dustbin is in a special
compartment accessible from the front
of the house. Access to the back of
the house from the store is through
the kitchen. With the exception of
one plan where access to the kitchen
is either from the living room or from
the store, all plans have separate ac-
cess from the hall to the rooms on the
ground floor.
Groups 111 and IV—the “dining
hall” and “large living room” houses
are of the most interest for world
requirements as they are already
popular in Canada and the United
States. An advantage of the large
living room type is the spaciousness
of the room and the heating of the
bedrooms. Conversely, the dining
hall house provides for people who
desire a separate living room.
Better Heating.
In the houses in Group 111 and IV
the tenant's total weekly outlay on
rent and fuel is greater than in Group
I and 11. But they enjoy better
heating, and all four groups are less
costly in terms of weekly outlay than
is the typical British council house
built since the war.
Heating for houses in Groups 111
is by means of radiators heating the
dining space and kitchen, after which

the heat rises to the bedrooms, thus
giving a high standard of heating at
minimum cost. The fuel required to
heat these houses in Britain by means
of open fires or stoves is in the region
of H tons to 4 tons per annum de'
pending on the situation and whether
the house is for four persons or five.
The heating installation also provides
all normal household requirements of
hot water for baths, laundry, and
washing up (aproximately 200250
gallons per week).
Larger Living Rooms.
The living rooms in Group IV are
larger than in all the other groups.
In place of the usual staircase halt
there is a small entrance lobby. The
kitchen is entered from the living
room and store, while the staircase,
rising from the living room, allows
heat to circulate to the bedrooms.
Heating is by an independent boiler,
and two radiators in the bedrooms
are recommended. Smokeless fuel
must be used in the boiler. Natural'
ly, the availability of suitable fuels in
any particular area is a factor to take
into account in considering the adop'
tion of these desjgns.
With an outside temperature of 30
degrees F. (2 degrees below freezing
point) it is estimated that the inside
temperatures will be 65 degrees F.
on the ground floor and 55 degrees
F. on the first floor. The estimated
fuel consumption of up to 32 tons
also provides for hot water.
Experiments have revealed that a
staircase rising from the living room
is an effective means of conveying
heat upstairs, and that a good teni'
perature distribution will be obtained
in similar but smaller houses by pro'
viding a single solid fuel appliance
of sufficient capacity to heat the
whole house, with radiators on the
ground floor only. This appliance
will also supply hot water, though in
the summer gas or electric water
heaters may be more economical.
To show the saving possible by
adopting these designs, it has been
estimated that a house in Groups 1 or
II would cost at least, in Britain,
£l5O less than the average house
being built there at the present time.
The capital saving should be more
for the three'bedroom house and
rather less for the two'bedroom house,
though this price difference will
naturally vary in different countries
and regions.
Houses incorporating these prim
ciples have been tried out by the
British Ministry of Fuel and Power
in collaboration with local authorities
in seven districts. The experiment
offers to private builders first'dass
proved types with which to carry out
their own housing enterprises, Mr.
Sampson concludes.
Development In
Papua and New
Guinea
Government Looks To Private
Enterprise.
Following the visit to Papua and
New Guinea by a joint Parliamentary
Delegation to represent the Senate
and the House of Representatives at
the inauguration of the Legislative
Council at Port Moresby on Noveim
ber 26th, 1951, Mr. Paul Hasluck,
Minister for Territories, has issued a
statement on Government Policy and
Development.
There has been criticism, the re'
Port states, that the policy of the
Government in regard to the Term
torv. and particularly the role of pm
vate enterprise, did not appear to be
widely enough known: this report is
designed to ensure full understanding
of Government policy.
Land and Labour.
The two salient points seem to be
that, firstly, as land is the key to
development, it will be made available
for settlement in areas where native
land needs are not affected. Secondly,
that the employment of native labour
is likely to be a customary feature of
industry in the Territory for some
time,” but greater attention will be
given to more extensive mechanisa'
tion.
Private Enterprise Vital.
In a statement to the House of
Representatives on Ist June, 1950.
Mr. Spender, as Minister for External
Territories, pointed out that the
Government must look to private em
terprise to a major extent for the de'
velopment of the Territory. On
various occasions jsince then, the
Government has emphasised that it
looks to private enterprise to supply
the skill and capital required for the
establishment of industry in the Terri'
tory.
Production of Basic
Foodstuffs.
One criticism has been that such
basic foodstuffs as rice, sugar and meat,
which could be produced in the Terri'
torv, are actually imported from Aus'
t’-alia. There is, the report continues,
some justification for the criticism in
regard to rice and meat, but it would
not be practicable at this stage to
manufacture sugar in Papua and New
Guinea.
In regard to rice, it is proposed to
develop the industry at least up to the
present level of imports, which is
about 16,000 tons a year.
Whilst sugar cane grows wild in
many parts of New Guinea, at present
all sugar is imported from Australia.
The problem is the establishment of
a as tbe export °f uncrushed
cane would be uneconomic), and it
ltS doubtful if one to supply the small
Territory needs of 2000-3000 tons per
annum could be established on an
economic basis.
There are areas in the Territory
that are eminently suitable for sheep
and cattle raising, and there is a defi-
nite need for locally-grown beef and
mutton to supply local needs in place
°f the present importation of 2.8
million lbs. of fresh meat and 6.4
million lbs. of preserved meat. A
factor retarding development, it is
stated, is the high cost of importing
foundation or breeding stock.
Tea, Coffee and Cocoa. .

It is also said that both Australia's

tons) and cocoa (13,000 tons) could
in the long run be supplied from
this source. Targets for 1957-58 are
400 tons and 3000 tons, respectively

New Guinea is recognised, and the
Government has endeavoured to .ru-
prove the shipping services in the
Territory, and there has been an ex-
pansion of shipping services since pre-
war. In 1951 there were 231 ves-
sels of 5 tons gross and over, repre-
senting a gross tonnage of 11,512

nage of 5431. Docking facilities,

Subsoil Investigation and the Architect
THE ESTIMATION OF LOAD-BEARING CAPACITIES.
By VICTOR J. MAUTNER
In an article intended for architects
and engineers whose practices brings
them only occasionally into touch with
foundation problems. Dr. Mautner
says his object is to make them broad'
ly acquainted with the relation be'
tween building load and the perform'
ance of the underlying subsoil.
When faced with the selection of a
suitable site for a proposed building,
or planning a structure on a given
site, such general knowledge may be
helpful in deciding on the extent to
which soil exploration should be car'
ried out.
Design and construction methods
applied to building foundations have
until recent times been based to a
large extent on assuming “permissible
bearing pressures” for various sub'
soils, states the author. These have
been classified in most of the build'
ing codes mainly by names vaguely
indicative of soil behaviour.
Heavy brick buildings with freely
supported timber floors predominated
in the past and the design of founda'
tions from tabulated values of load'
bearing capacity rarely resulted in dis'
astrous failure. However, the safety
and stability of foundations under in-
tricate monolithic reinforced concrete
structures, steel framework, etc., de'
pend to a much higher degree on the
performance of the subsoil.
The Cost Factor.
Unequal settlements, lateral move'
ments, swelling and other phenomena
due to the actual state of subsoils may
add materially to the computed stress'
es in the framework and cause ser'
ious structural damage. On the other
hand uncertainty in assessing soil be'
haviour under given conditions of
loading induces the designer to adopt
low bearing values, thus increasing
building costs unnecessarily.
The performance of the principal
materials of construction such as steel,
concrete, brick and timber under vai
ious conditions can be safely predict'
ed from tests based on extensive phy'
sical and mechanical research. How'
ever, systematic research on soil pro'
perties as well as on technical geoh
ogy began only in the first' decade of
this century, when the new science of
soil mechanics originated.
The interpretation of site investiga'
tion and laboratory tests based on soil
mechanics research may aid the de'
signer in arriving at a reasonable as'
sessment of subsoil behaviour values
of bearing capacity, ultimate settle'
ment, etc., deduced from these sources
agree more closely with soil behaviour
than those determined empirically.
Systematic soil exploration, therefore,
will lead to a choice of a reasonable
factor of safety as a basis for founda-
tion design.
Soil Classification.
Many systems of soil classification
have been proposed. In the follow-
ing notes three main groups of sub-
soil are described according to their
physical characteristics.

In all three groups density influ'
ences to a high degree the behaviour
of subsoils; it depends on the “voids'
ratio” namely the volume of voids
between grains filled with air and water
per unit volume of solid particles in
soil.
(i) Gravel and sand (coarse and
fine). —Gravels are cohesionless ma-
terials consisting of particles more than
2.0 millimetres in size. Particles be'
tween 2.0 and 0.05 millimetres in size
are described as sand. Such soils
when composed of nearly spherical
particles of almost equal size exhibit
a higher degree of density than ma-
terials containing predominantly flat
grains, e.g., mica.
The internal forces acting in a co'
hesionless material are caused by fric'
tion and compression. Water content
can be neglected, except in regard
to performance under submerged con'
ditions (uplift, liquid flow, etc..
Such soils generally form very sat'
isfactory bearing materials depending
on their compactness only for their
stability.
(ii) Silt or rock-flour (loess and
loam). —These are partially cemented
soils of medium cohesion, made up of
fine grained materials of 0.1'0.002
millimetres dia. Their density is usu'
ally very low.
Internal forces are produced by ad'
hesion (cementation) and friction
(capillary forces). The water holding
capacity is enhanced by the existence
of root channels. The effect of cap'
illanty is usually detrimental (lateral
flow).
All types of silt are dangerous sub-
soils of doubtful stability.
(iii) Clay (clay and colloids). —
These consist of highly cohesive ma-
terials composed of very fine inorganic
particles a large proportion of which
are flat or scaly shaped (mica, etc.).
The size of grains ranges from 0.002'
0.0003 millimetres dia., the latter fig'
ure referring to colloids. The density
is, therefore, low. Internal forces ar
due to adhesion (molecular attrac'
tion) and friction (capillary forces).
With increasing water content clay
changes from the very hard state to a
liquid condition.
Clays of soft to hard condition pro'
vide suitable subsoils of medium to
high load'bearing capacity.
This classification gives only a
rough idea of the performance of a
given soil when subjected to building
loads. Each individual case, particu-
larly among cohesive soils, requires
careful consideration based on site
exploration and laboratory tests by
soil experts.
Pressure Distribution.
The intensity of pressure created in
a soil by a foundation load determines
the extent to which soil investigation
should be carried out. For example.
Figure 1 indicates the range within
which perceptible stresses are induced
in the subsoil, in this case sand, under
a loaded rigid column footing.
The lines of equal maximum verti'
cal stresses (isobars) circumscribe areas
of a bulklike shape (pressure bulbs).
The contours of “pressure bulbs” de'
pend upon the adopted unit load im-
posed on the foundation, and the area
and shape of the foundation.
As can be seen from Figures 1

and la, the “pressure bulbs” under a
series of strip foundations or individ-
ual footings combine to form an en-
veloping total pressure bulb.
In Figure 2, the isobars of pres-
sure bulbs give a guide to the depth
to which soil exploration is necessary.
Various suggestions have been made
for the determination of this depth.
The rule in force in the United
States, i.e., “to one and half times
the least width of the building,” may
be generally adopted. Particular con-
ditions such as clay and silt strata un-
derlying a firm soil at a greater depth,
ground water, etc., require appropri-
ate consideration.
Soil Investigation.
The principal tests which are sup-
posed to yield useful information on
foundation problems and therefore
have received general recognition will
now be discussed briefly without go-
ing into details of procedure.
(i) Site exploration. —The excava-
tion of test pits makes it possible to
establish the nature and depth of soil
strata as well as the occurrence of
ground water below a proposed build-
ing. From such pits, too, undisturbed
soil samples are secured for the ne-
cessary laboratory tests.
The depth of test pits is usually
restricted to about 12 to 15 ft. owing
to the high cost of excavation. Un-
disturbed samples from greater depth
may be obtained by driving the sharp
cutting edge of a casing to the re-
quired stratum and using a sampler.
From pumping tests the permeabil-
ity of water-bearing soils, which is of
greater importance in the execution
of foundation works, can be comput-
ed. Loading tests on small areas have
generally proved to be unreliable as
they do not cover the whole range
of the pressure bulb under the actual
foundation load. (Figure 1 and Fig-
ure 2.) However, such loading tests
may be used in the case of a cohe-
sionless soil of considerable depth as
a supplement to laboratory investiga-
tions.
(ii) Laboratory tests. The undis-
turbed samples, carefully secured and
coated with paraffin at the site, are
used for tests in the 'laboratory.
Broadly, in case of cohesionless soils,
the determination of the natural den-
sity, compressibility, direct shearing
strength, the angle of internal friction
and the grain-size distribution provide
valuable hints for foundation design.
So far as cohesive materials are con-
cerned, determinations of natural
water-content, cohesion, consistency,
liquid and plastic limits and consolid-
ation are essential.
Behaviour of subsoils under foun-
dation loads. The subsoil under any
foundation load will be subjected to
the following marked changes in its
original conditions, which control its
permissible bearing value:
(i) Elastic compression by the de-
formation of its single grains.
(ii) Consolidation of the soil,
which is caused by squeezing-
out of the air-water content
and the realignment of soil
grains, resulting in the reduc
tion of the volume of voids.
Fine-grained soils such as clav
exhibit a high degree of consol

(iii) Lateral movement of the load-
ed soil towards the surround-
ing unloaded ground.
Bearing Values.
The selection of a permissible bear-
ing value depends on two factors.
First, the actual bearing capacity, de-
fined as the maximum unit load which
may be applied to a soil without caus-
ing ultimate failure. Second, the per-
missible settlement defined by func-
tional requirements.
The adopted bearing value must
satisfy both requirements. Therefore,
an adequate factor of safety should
be taken into account against ultimate
rupture in the ground and against
settlement. Generally, an overall fac-
tor of safety between 1.5-2 may be
sufficient. For structures very sensi-
tive to settlement, such as high chim-
neys, or buildings exposed to vibra-
tion and impact caused by heavy ma-
chinery, the factor of safety might
have to be increased according to cir-
cumstances up to 3. On the other
hand, a thorough knowledge of the
properties of the soil may permit of
a reduction in the safety factor,
(i) Ultimate bearing capacity.—
Computation of the ultimate bearing
capacity based on the shearing strength
of the soil should give accurate re-
sults. Figure 3 illustrates how failure
takes place in the ground under a load-
ed foundation. The surface of a rup-
ture forms a cylinder terminating in a
plane making an angle with the hor-
izontal surface.
Prior to ultimate rupture the act-
ing and resisting forces should main-
tain equilibrium.
The ultimate bearing capacity,
therefore, is found in case of assym-
metrical as well as symmetrical rup-
ture by equating the foundation load
“P,” and the weight of the soil be-
tween ABCDEFA (BA Ci
Di E n F B) with the resisting forces
provided by the friction and cohe-
sion (if any) along the surface A E
(B Ei) plus the passive earth pressure
“E” acting in a horizontal direction
at a point one-third lower on the plane
D E (Di EA- The specific gravity,
friction and cohesion of the given
soil may be obtained from laboratory
tests.
(ii) Settlement. -Cohesive and co-
resionless soils do not show identical
characteristics of settlement.
Cohesionless soils—Cohesionless soils
such as sands and gravels commonly
do not present difficult problems with
regard to settlement. The value of
their safe bearing capacity is gener-
ally controlled only by the ultimate

rupture of the ground. Till this oc-
curs settlements are not to be expect'
ed to exceed permissible limits. The
amount of settlement, of course, in'
creases with rising soil pressure.
Settlement also depends on the area
and shape of the base. Under the
same foundation unit load the settle-
ment increases with increasing width
of the base at a decreasing rate until
for large areas it becomes independ-
ent of the size of the loaded area.
The author adds that the density of
the subsoil has an influence on the
amount of settlement. Under the same
foundation load fine sands, mainly
loose in natural deposits, are exposed
to greater settlement than coarse sands
and gravels which generally form com-
pact layers.

THOUGHTS ON ARCHITECTURE
By WALTER GROPIUS.
Walter Gropius, former originator
of the Bauhaus in Germany and now
for many years Chairman of the
Harvard School of Architecture, was
recently received the first annual award
of 500 dollars created as a memorial
to the late Howard Myers, editor and
publisher for 22 years of the “Archi
tectural Forum,” for an article deemed
“the best written, most progressive,
clearly though, expanding the under'
standing of architecture, explanatory
in the sense of making architecture
more comprehensible to the public,
and above all, encouraging the public
interest in first'rate architecture.”
His article was entitled “Not Gothic,
but Modern for our Colleges.”
Here are a few random passages:—
“Architecture is said to be a true
mirror of the life and social behaviour
of a period. If that is true, we should
he able to read from its present features
the driving forces of our own time.”
“Aesthetic connoisseurship has gene'
rally displaced a creative conception of
art.”
“So long as we flounder about in a
limitless welter of borrowed artistic
expression we shall not succeed in
giving form and substance to our own
culture, for this implies selective choice
of these artistic means which best ex'
press the ideas and spiritual directions
of our time.”
“There is no finality in architecture
—-only continuous change.”

FOUR USEFUL PLANS.
This quartette roughly divide themselves into two parts, the upper of which a single-storey one with Lounge
and Dining Rooms, and the other with Living Room only, each having two bedrooms. The lower two have three
bedrooms accommodated in the steeply-pitched roofs which give them the attractive appearance of a storey and
a half or attic type house that appeals to many as against the straight out two-storey house. Both these examples
provide Lounge and Dining Room in the lower storey.
