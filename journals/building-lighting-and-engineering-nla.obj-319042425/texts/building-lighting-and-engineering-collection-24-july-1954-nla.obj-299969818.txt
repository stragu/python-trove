essential facilities, you’ll find Otis lift installations —
and in the modern hospital much more than just a
lift is required. Only years of experience in design,
manufacture and installation will assure successful
results, and in such a capacity, Otis has served for
100 years. Townsville Hospital has three Otis Bed-
Passenger Lifts and one Otis Service Lift.

PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE IN
NEW HARVEY TRINDER BUILDING
This letter from Mr. L. F. McEachern, Director of
Harvey Trinder (N.S.W.) Pty. Ltd., explains why
IBM Time Control equipment was chosen for the
new Harvey Trinder Building.
“As you are aware when this Company was erecting the
building at 267 George Street, Sydney, it was our wish to
have a modern and up-to-date building.
“For this reason we went into the question of clocks through
the building—the most efficient and modern system of time
co-ordination and control available to us appeared to be
the IBM.
“Their equipment was flexible, not only from a technical
and design standpoint but met all our requirements and
harmonised with the interior designs and colouring of the
building.
“The Hourly Supervision* principle of the IBM Master
Clock Control System guaranteeing the accuracy of the
various time units installed made the choice an ideal one
in every respect, as far as we were concerned."
Throughout Australia, throughout the world, leading archi-
tects are specifying the IBM Master Clock System because it
is the one system of guaranteed efficiency . . . because with
that system comes the vast technical resources and “know-
how” of the world’s largest manufacturers of automatic timing
equipment.
The IBM Master Clock Controlled Time System is the most
accurate, most economical and trouble-free of all systems
(impulse, synchronous, spring-driven). One Master Clock
supervises the accuracy of any number of wall clocks, attendance
time recorders, job time recorders, STOP-START signals.
Operates on A.C. or D.C. Full details and expert IBM
advisory service available at no cost or obligation.
*an exclusive feature. Every hour the IBM Master Clock
automatically checks the accuracy of every time unit on its circuit
—correcting even the slightest variation from Observatory time.

FOR PROTECTION
FOR PRESERVATION
FOR HIGH REFLECTIVITY
Almost every surface that is exposed to corrosion by salt atmos-
pheres, or the smoke and acidity of industrial regions, can be
protected and preserved by the superior resistant power of
"Alpaste” Aluminium Paint.
"Alpaste” is an aluminium paint pigment in paste form which,
whilst avoiding the drawbacks of powder pigment, retains such
desirable properties as "leafing” and high reflectivity. In addition,
"Alpaste” gives more complete opacity (a layer of only 1/2,000th
of an inch thick will completely obscure the underlying surface,
however dark and dreary). Moreover, "Alpaste” gives 10% to
20% greater coverage power.
"Alpaste” is recommended as a preservative for wood, brickworK,
concrete, aluminium, steel, magnesium, plaster, stucco and asphalt.
Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste”
Paint Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium which, when

A RAPID

TECHNIQUE
for CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS
THE TINSLEY POLAROGRAPH
V
A complete technical advisory service
is available at all ROWCO Branches.
There is no obligation and your en-
quiries will be welcomed.
An instrument for rapid and accurate chemical analysis. It produces current-
voltage curves called polarograms, which are obtained by the electrolysis of any
solution containing electro-reducible or electra-oxidisable substances. The con-
centration and species of the elements in solution can be directly and accurately
determined from the characteristics of the curves.
The development in recording Polarographs of D.C. amplification to the current
passing through the solution in the polarographic cell, permits the use of a pen
recorder, which gives a direct and instantaneous record of the change in current
during analysis. The recorder is undamped and the exact value of the maximum
current at the instant of fall of the mercury drop is shown. The Tinsley High-
Speed Ink Recording Polarograph is the only Polarograph on the market which
can do this. In addition, a damping device is incorporated, which enables the non
mal type damped poloragram to be taken without altering the sensitivity of the
recorder.
NEW DERIVATIVE POLAROGRAPH
This latest development enables elements to be distinguished when close together
on the elecrochemical scale, and when the first element is present in much
greater concentration than the second.

ELECTRICITY JUBILEE
July 8 was the Fiftieth Anniversary of the institution of Municipal Electricity
Services in Sydney. As such it marked an important milestone in the development
of Sydney and New South Wales and was recognised accordingly in various ways
by the electricity authorities.
The first electricity supply for the City of Sydney was generated at Pyrmont
in a plant erected for the Sydney City Council and it was switched on by the
Lady Maroyess, Mrs. S. E. Lees, on July 8’ 1904, by means of an opahstudded key.
In her comments at the ceremony, she said: “I trust it will be a boon to the citizens.”
That this has proved to be the case no one has the slightest doubt, even if a
few years ago in the temper-fraying blackout era, many citizens, struggling to cook
their evening meal on spirit-stoves to the light of candle, may have had second
thoughts on the subject. Those unfortunate days, however, the basic reason for
which can probably directly or indirectly be blamed upon the war and its resultant
dislocation, now seem to have passed, and the Electricity Commission appear to be
meeting all demands with its expanding generating capacity.
The Sydney County Council, in its display windows in the Queen Victoria
Building at the present time, have a series of drawings depicting conditions at the
beginning of the century before electricity had begun to change the face of industry,
the city and the home.
One telling drawing shows a woman in long skirts and with the dominant hair
style of the era, struggling over a fuel copper with a copperstick to extract the
steaming clothes. The caption, “Fifty years ago women did the work; to-day*
electricity does the work,” has a large measure of truth in it, for undoubtedly the
advent of electricity and the introduction of electrically operated, labour-saving
devices in the home has brought about a revolution in this sphere.
At that time the fortunate woman probably had domestic help. This, to-day,
virtually exists no longer, and it is the innumerable electrical devices that efficiently
carry out those tasks that are taking its place and making the lot of the average
housewife much less arduous.
In industry, the change has been just as striking, and in fact it is difficult to
look back to the era when it was not possible to build a factory or commence an
industry practically anywhere and obtain the necessary power at the turn of a
switch rather than having to construct a special plant to produce it. The radio,
the telephone, electric lighting, and proposed television are other by-products of
the electrical age that have brought such staggering changes in our modern way
of life.
It is fitting, therefore, that at this Fiftieth Anniversary of Sydney’s electrical
debut, we should pause for a moment to realise these facts, for without doubt
electricity has been one of the greatest boons that have been placed at the service
of man —and women.

buildings in Grosvenor Street.
During excavations on the site
the remains of an original convict
building were found, these having
been incorporated into a larger
building subsequently erected at a
later date. (This, incidentally, was
the first building of the Cadbury
chocolate organisation in Austra-
lia). The old structure, on to
which two extra floors had been
added in 1921, had a Classic
facade of sandstone of some
dignity and charm. Although
this building was very nearly
completely demolished to make
way for the new Harvey Trinder
building, some of the original
stone walls have been incorporat-
ed, and also remain completely in
the basement.
'H.ine Floors.
The new structure, which com-
prises nine floors, has a structural
steel frame and reinforced con-
crete floors and stairs. The facade,
on modern simple lines, has a
large window area embracing
practically the whole of the
frontage, the spandrils between
being of red texture bricks, the
facade to the ground floor being
of imported red granite. The
windows throughout are of either
casement or hopper type, all sec-
tions being extruded bronze to
prevent corrosion.
Stri\ing Sign.
A feature of the lower portion
of the building is a large sign
which has been designed as an
intrinsic part of the facade, in-
corporating the words “Harvey
Trinder.” The letters are in
bronze two feet high, illuminated
from behind with strip lighting,
and the effect obtained from the
spill light reflecting from the
granite is particularly effective, at
night giving the impression that
the letters are floating in a sea
of light. The floors of the build-
ing are generally in large areas,
for the frontage is not great, and
are treated throughout with
parquetry flooring and washable
wall surfaces. Large areas of the
roof have been designed as gar-
dens for the staff.
Modern Lift.
The lift, which is of the latest
high-speed type, travelling at 300
feet per minute, is dual-controlled,
with double opening self-operat-
ing doors. The construction of
the building is, of course, com-
pletely fireproof and is sectional-
ised by self-operating fire-doors.
The ground floor vestibule of
the main business chambers, as
well as the counter, are finished
with Travertine marble, which is
also employed upon the floors.
French-polished Queensland maple
finished in natural colours has
been employed for all the wall
panelling, fitments, cupboards, etc.,
on this floor. Partitions to the
upper floors are also of Queens-
land maple similarly finished.
A mezzanine floor is provided
and is devoted to telephone switch-
board, staff amenities, rest-rooms,

cloakrooms, etc. Executive offices
are provided on the seventh floor,
the floors to this area being in
jarrah and Tasmanian oak par-
quetry set in a basket-weave pat-
tern which produces a most at-
tractive effect. Furniture, wher-
ever possible, has been built in to
match with the general wall
finishes.
Staff Dining Room.
The spacious staff dining room
is served by a completely modern
kitchen unit incorporating gener-
ous refrigeration space, the colour
scheme being ivory and powder
blue.
The lighting throughout is of
fluorescent ” sun-ray” finished with
attractive modern fixtures which.
by the combination of varying
colours in the light tubes, give a
realistic daylight effect. The
building is air'Conditioned so that
in the winter months warm fresh
air can be provided, while in the
summer the humidity is eliminated
from the air which, after cooling
to a moderate temperature, is dis'
tributed throughout the building,

Fine Timber Enhances Modern Building
The Work of H. P. Corboz Pty. Ltd. In the New Harvey Trinder Building.
The majestic Chateau, rising in
splendour from its flowered lawns, or
some stately Manor House, standing
in solitary grandeur among its ancient
oaks, evokes longings for the “spacious
days of old. Indeed, the beauty of
the scene blinds us to the fact that
these noble structures are often sadly
lacking in the amenities we consider
essential for modern living. Never
theless, every visitor is enthralled by
the refined luxury and aristocratic
quality of the interior panelling and
fittings.
This “design for living” has fieen
enthusiastically adopted in many ways
by modern “Big Business,” for the
advantage derived from good office
fittings is selfievident. They attract,
they create a receptive atmosphere,
and they increase sales.
A recent example of the modern
concept of office design and equip'
ment is to be seen in the Harvey
Trinder Building, 267 George
Street, Sydney, where on the fifth

THE ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY MEMORIAL CHAPEL
FLINDERS NAVAL DEPOT, VICTORIA.
Architect: Louis R. Williams.
Builder: A. L. Ackland.
For many years it had been de-
sired that a Memorial Chapel should
be erected at the Flinders Naval
Depot to commemorate the deeds and
the sacrifices that men of the Royal
Australian Navy have performed in
two world wars and, at the same time,
to provide an appropriate place of
worship for the cadets at this import'
ant Australian Naval establishment.
The drill hall, with its well'
appointed sanctuary, had served a use-
ful purpose; but it was evident that,
with the growth of the establishment,
worship should take place in a build'
ing hallowed for that purpose.
In 1942 an announcement was
made that an amount of £lO,OOO had
been bequeathed under the will of
Mrs. Alice Treacy, for the purpose of
erecting a Chapel in memory of her
husband, the late Paymaster'Captain
Alfred Treacy, R.A.N. This splendid
gift enabled work to commence on
the building. A Memorial Plaque to
Captain Treacy is erected in the Side
Chapel.
It was realised that the amount of
the legacy was insufficient to provide
a Chanel of the size desired, so the
concurrence of the Executors was
secured to make public appeal for
extra money. Mr. Louis R. Williams,
Diocesan Archi.ect, was commis'
sioned to draw up plans for a build-
ing that would accommodate 500.
A Committee was formed to handle
all affairs connected with the Chapel,
and from the outset this Committee
decided that, as a general rule, no
brass plates should be allowed to find
place in the main building. There
will be some brass plates, i.e., the one
to Captain Treacy, and others, re-
moved from the drijj hall sanctuary.
Any gifts, or memorials, will have
the name of the giver, together with
a description of the gift, and the pur-
pose of the memorial, entered in a
Gifts Memorial Book.
Work on the Chapel was completed
in February, 1954, the whole work,
including furnishings, having cost
about £75,000. Of this amount, some
£68,000 has already been raised, and
the outstanding balance is held on
loan.
This ambition was brought to
fruition on May 15th last, when the
Royal Australian Navy Memorial
Chapel was opened and dedicated.
Opening Ceremony.
The opening ceremony was per-
formed bv the Governor of Victoria,
Sir Dallas Brooks, and the dedication
by the Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr.
J. J. Booth, in association with the
Heads of the Presbyterian and
Methodist Churchc*
It was an impressive ceremony in
this beautiful Chapel that was de'
signed by the welhknown ecclesiasti-
cal architect, Mr. Louis Williams, the
large gathering being obviously moved
by the emotions that, the occasion
brought forth.
Stained Glass Windows.
A striking feature of the Chapel
are the many stained glass memorial
windows that have been donated by
organisations and individuals. These
include the main west window that
was given by the City of Sydney and
the present crew of H.M.A.S. Sydney
as a memorial to H.M.A.S. Sydney:
also the east rose window, presented
by the City of Perth and the sur'
vivors of the H.M.A.S. Perth as a
memorial to this vessel.
The City of Parramatta has also
donated a window in memory of the
ship which bore that name. The rose
window in the Chapel is a memorial
to the H.M.A.S. Canberra, while
other windows commemorate the

late Rear'Admiral H. J. Feakes,
C.B.E. Lady Hyde has also given a
memorial window to her late hus'
band, Vice-Admiral Sir George Hyde.
Two “angel” windows have also
been donated by the architect, Mr.
Louis R. Williams, and one by the
stained glass artist, Mr. D. Taylor-
Kellock, of Ballarat.
Other gifts include the altar, altar
cross, cloth and book, candlesticks,
wrought iron gates, font, litany desk,
lantern and pews. Each pew com-
memorates the war service of the ship
named after the particular city or
town and bears its crest.
A tile from the KnigLts Templar
Church, London, is also incorporated,
this being one of three sent from
England in appreciation of wartime
food parcels. The others are in St.
Cathedral, Sydney, and St.
Paul’s Cathedral, Melbourne. The
stone used for the bowl of the piscina
came from the House of Commons,
London.
Random Rubble Freestone.
Construction of the walls is a com-
bination of stone, concrete and brick-
work. The stonework is quarry faced
coursed random rubble freestone, 4in.
to lOin. thick, backed with fine con-
crete, tied to an inner walling of llin.
brickwork. The roof is of open
timber construction, with heavy trusses
of Oregon, the rafters being lined
with Swedish softboard. Above the
cream brick dado, the interior walls
are sand finish plaster. The windows
at the East end are placed high up,
and a feeling of great height has been
created. These windows are all
traceried in pressed cement, as is also
the big West window. All the furni'
ture, designed by the Architect, is of
Queensland black bean, natural finish.
Wunderlich Ltd. supplied the roof
tiles; Alan Sumner, the leadlights;
T. McCarthy, the furniture; The
Derite Co., the pressed cement tracery;
while the stone came from J. Me-
Auley’s quarry at Templestowe.
A fine idea of the graceful and
dignified lines of the Chapel is gained
from the large cover illustration.
ORNAMENTAL IRONWORK
RETURNS.
Influence of Welding.
The characteristics of the Queen
Anne type of house, with the prolific
ornamentation of cast iron grill work
and brackets, are to some extent re-
appearing in the modern dwellings.
The passing of the old blacksmith,
who with his forge and anvil ham'
mered and tortured steel bars into
every conceivable shape, popularised
“wrought-iron” fixtures. But with the
oncoming of cast iron by the hundred,
as was used on balcony railing, put
it into the discard.
However, the introduction of weld'
ing is reviving the use of fancy iron'
work gates, fences, garden fixtures
and grill work in and around modern
house designs. The new process has
removed the need for hours of work
bv the blacksmith in fitting and shap'
ing. This is now quickly adjusted
by the “cut” and “re-weld” method.
Welded furniture, chairs and tables
for use in the outdoor living rooms —
or patios as they are called in Europe
—are more durable than wood or
cane work and can be left out in all
weathers.
Far from being lost, the iron'
worker’s art has been revived and im'
proved upon, although it is possible
that those old craftsmen who brought
the blacksmith’s and the metal beat'
er’s art to such a high pitch would
turn in their graves to think that their
craft is so degraded by the modern
methods .

Physical Education Centre for Melbourne
University
£165,000 GIFT BY SIR FRANK BEAUREPAIRE.
On April 18th, 1954, the Vice'
Chancellor of the University of Mel'
bourne, Professor G. W. Paton, made
an announcement of great significance
to Melbourne and Australia.
It was that Sir Frank Beaurepaire
had made a gift to the University of
£165,000 for the erection of a Physi'
cal Education Centre in the Univer'
sity grounds. The significance of the
gift is that it comes from one of Aus'
tralia’s leading sportsmen and one
who, starting right from the bottom,
has become one of the leading indus'
trialists of this country.
Purpcise of Buildings.
The Vice'Chancellor, in announcing
the gift, said that the buildings were
to serve the following; purposes:—
(a) To care for the needs of the
University Department of Phy-
sical Education, especially for
research into methods of physh
cal education and medical and
technical aspects of physical
activities;
(b) To provide for swimming,
gymnastics, squash racquets,
boxinv wrestling and other
such activities as conducted by
the University Sports Union;
and
( c ) A Trophy Hall and Library,
with a view to the encourage'
ment of members of the staff
and the students of the Univer-
sity and the public generally
to a greater interest in physh
cal exercises.
Remarkable Career.
Sir Frank Beaurepaire. who is 63,
was one of the outstanding swimmers
that this country has produced, re'
presenting Australia on six overseas
trips and creating 14 world records.
In his swimming career he won more
than 200 championships, which in'
eluded 34 Australian, 83 Victorian,
and 11 English titles.
He competed for Australia in
three Olympic Games—London, 1908,
when only 17; Antwerp, in 1920; and
Paris, in 1924. More recently, he
was one of the men responsible for
the 1956 Olympic Games coming to
Melbourne, being th e first Chairman
of the Victorian Olympic Council
and the Olympic Games Organising
Committee.
It is interesting to record that in
1921 he rescued a man from a shark
at Coogee Beach, in Sydney, the vie'
tim having had his hands bitten off at
the wrists. As a result of a public
subscription raised in appreciation of
his bravery, he received £l,OOO, which
enabled him to commence his bush
ness career, which has culminated
to'day in his being Chairman of the
£6,250,000 Olympic Tyre Group of
Companies which he founded.
Appreciation of University.
The Vice'Chancellor, in expressing
the great appreciation of the Univer'
sity to Sir Frank Beaurepaire for this
generous gift, said that it would en'
able the University to fulfil an edu'
cational obligation of which the Uni'
versity Council, staff and students had
been conscious i/lr a long time.
Recreational as well as competitive
physical activities and sports contained
many elements calculated to advance
the development of students in a way
which the University desired.
The Trophy Hall and Library, he
continued, would be of special value

WATER BOARD FIGURES REVEAL NEW RECORDS.
18,824 Jobs Cost £65,245,675.
Figures for the twelve months
ended 30th June* 1954, of building
operations within the area served by
the Metropolitan Water Sewerage
and Drainage Board and which have
been connected to the Board’s water'
mains reveal that the number of all
new buildings completed was 16,119,
at a cost of £56,309,155, whilst ah
terations and/or additions were made
to another 2,705 existing structures
at a cost of £8,936,520. In all. 18,824
jobs were completed for £65,245,675.
Both the number of jobs completed,
and the cost represent new records for
a financial year, surpassing the pre'
vious highest figure sof 17,095 jobs
in 1951/52 and total cost of
£51,923,332 in 1952/53.
Increase in Average Cost.
The number of jobs completed re'
presents an increase of 10.7% over
the previous corresponding twelve
months. The average cost per job
was £3,466, which compares with
£2,431 (1950/51), £2,698 (1951/52)
and £3,053 (1952/53) for the preced'
ing three financial years and shows an
increase in cost over this period of
52.58%.
Homes Represent 90%.
The erection of homes continues to
provide the greatest field of activity,
17,025 having been erected or altered
or added to, representing 90% of the
total jobs completed. For the three
previous financial years the figures
under this category were 1950/51
12,954, 92%; 1951/52, 15,806, 92%-
1952/53, 15,527, 91%. The Housing
Commission of N.S.\V\ has again con'
tributed substantially in this direc'
tion, 2,136 cottages and 30 blocks of
flats comprising 883 units erected by
this Authority, having been rated by
the Board during the twelve months.
Bankstown Leads.
The districts in which the greatest
activity occurred were:
Cottage Building.
For the first time (as from Ist
January, 1954) a separate record has
been made of new cottages completed
and their estimated cost, as deter-
mined by the Board from the in-
formation furnished to it. For the
six months ended 30th June. 1954,
7,878 cottages were completed, at an
average estimated cost of £2,832.
It will be noted that similarly to
the general record the greatest activity
occurred in Bankstown, Sutherland,
Warringah, and Wbllongong, in that
order.

ber of jobs completed and the cost
thereof for the past 30 years;—
ATOMIC PLANT FOR FUTURE
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY.
Quietly, over the past four years,
British technicians have converted the
world’s most explosive industry into
one of the safest.
Dealing with titanic forces and fac-
ing injury from contamination by
harmful radiations, they have de-
vised methods of control that have
given the atomic factory a lower ac-
cident frequency than in most other
comparable industries.
Two atomic piles built at Wind'
scale are enclosed in several feet of
concrete. Giant fans remove the air
and discharge it more than 400 feet
above the ground. Water into which
the exhausted uranium cartridges fall
is carried two miles out to sea by
pipeline.
So far, in the staff of 3,000 em'
ployees, there has not been one case
suffering from radiation sickness.

NEW PLANT
T he plant expansions at General
Motors Holdens, Woodville plant are

building industry at a luncheon in the
Hotel Australia, Melbourne, to wel-
come home members of the Australian
Building Productivity Team from their
recent overseas tour of investigation.
Mr. D. B. Doyle, 0.8. E., Congress
President, was in the Chair. In his
welcome he pointed out that mem-
bers of the team all went abroad at
their own expense.
They had spent their own money
in doing something which might well
form a pattern for other industries,
he said.
The productivity team was the first
of its kind to go from Australia, and
its report should have an important
bearing on the future of the Common-
wealth.
Mr. Doyle suggested that Congress
might have to ask the Federal Govern-
ment to pay part of the cost of dis-
seminating the information brought
back.
In his address, Mr. lohn O’Keeffe
said the Team was unfortunate that its
leader, Mr. Gordon Longmuir, was
compelled to withdraw in London
owing to ill-health.
“Having experienced the exacting
effects of the American programme.
Mr. Longmuir was well advised, I
would say, and wise in making his
decision to cancel all engagements and
return direct to Australia.”
Continuing, Mr. O’Keeffe said, “the
report on the tour would be presented
as soon as possible. The brief period
spent in London did not permit Team
members time to inspect all that they
wished to. They realised that there
was a lot to be learned from the wav
the U.K. was overcoming her manv
post-war problems. One important
fact emerged, however; the urgent, if
not imperative need for businessmen
to have more frequent exchange of
visits.”
U.S. Building.
Mr. O’Keeffe said his observations
and enquiries had been directed to-
wards matters concerning economy of
building, economy of the State, and
therefore the nation.
They included controls, traffic and
transportation, decentralisation, spe-
cialisation, competitive activity as well
as the co-operative activity of manage-
ment and labour. His remarks prin-
cipally concerned the U.S. sphere,
where the Team spent most of its time.
Controls.
Mr. O’Keeffe continued:
“If I were asked to sum-up in one
word the greatest contributing factor
to the high productivity of the
American people, I would answer
’Freedom’ - Freedom, and all its im-
plies. They have had controls and
they have long since removed them.
They are free to produce what they
want —at any price at which they can
sell to any person who wishes to buy.
They are free to work when they
want to . . . To trade when they
want to. . . . To give you service
as you want it. There are no such
restraints as we are subject to here.
They laughed when we informed them
that petrol required for a week-end
out in Australia had to be purchased
before mid-day on Saturday; that a
service station proprietor was liable to
prosecution if he sold petrol after the
regulation closing-time.
“Price control is looked on as a
necessary measure during wartime. It
is looked on in peacetime as an inter'
ference with that system which pro'
duces the goods "Free .Enterprise’
Price control suffocates competition.
Competition keeps prices down and
competition can only be encouraged
by the removal of controls. And com'
petition in business is one of the
reasons why the American worker can
purchase for the same number of
hours of work four times the quantity
of goods that his counterpart in
Europe can purchase.
“The reason why price fixation is
illegal in America is because it is con'
sidered to be disadvantageous to the
consumer. We in Australia have
prices fixed by Government regula'
tion. lam convinced that competition
is thereby stifled. Due to competi'
tion in America they are building
four'bedroom, two'bathroom dwellings
and selling them at prices less than
they were selling two'bedroom one'
bathroom homes immediately after the
war; and that over a period when
wages and materials have increased in
price. Competition in some areas has
resulted in the apparent replacement
of timber. There was not a piece of
timber to be seen in one building
inspected. Yet competition in other
places has resulted in laminated tim-
ber being used in place of steel. Con'
Crete light-weight blocks have in some
areas replaced bricks, vet they are
producing them to look like bricks.
The competition from aluminium is
causing steel interests to watch their
preserves. So it goes on. All as a
result of competition. Competitive

principal Contractor who receives bids
or tenders from the various Sub'
Contractors and there are a great
number of them. The principal Con'
tractor negotiates with the owner.
“Part of the explanation for
America’s high productivity is the ex'
tent to which a main job is broken
down into various classifications of
work on which firms or individuals
specialise.
“One Contractor, or Broker, who
operates on a large scale comparative'
ly with our own builders, showed me
a list of sixty'eight classified opera'
tions for a job of which he ticked five,
for sure, possibly seven, which he
would carry out himself. The re'
maining sixty'odd were the jobs for
specialist subcontractors. And there
was keen competition among the
specialists for contracts.
“The control exercised by the prin'
cipal Contractor provided for daily,
weekly and monthly reports. Com'
petition was so keen that the Super'
visor had to know within a matter of
hours if a job tended ‘to go bad’
Previous day’s costs were known the
following morning, abour was just as
keen to know whether schedules were
being maintained. They were kept
informed. Every detail of construe'
tional work was preplanned and
thoroughly organised. It had to be
so in America to permit a job to be
successfully and profitably undertaken:
Efficiency demanded it. Competition
encouraged it. Administrative control,
if it was to be effective, required it.
“The industrial potential in America
undoubtedly depends on mechanisa'
tion. There is an obvious willingness
to use machinery and a firm desire to
do every job better than the previous
one, Mr. O’Keeffe declared.
Transportation.
It must be noted that one of the
fundamental principles listed by the
Americans to which adherence is
necessary to maintain the strength of
their domestic economy is ‘The main-
tenance of free market for services.’
Among those services must be includ'
ed the services of transport of goods.
In the transport of building materials
the service of road transport is in
many cases very essential.
All members of the Team were
impressed by the facilities available
both in America and on the Continent
for the transportation of goods by
road. In both areas road transport is
encouraged. Here in Australia it
appears to be discouraged by being
heavily taxed. It is another instance
of competition by taxation.
On the autobahns of the con'
tinent heavy'duty trucks were travelling
almost bumper to bumper transport'
ing goods. The railways were under'
stood to have gone out after business
and succeeded in the way of trans-
porting empty trailers and trucks back
to the terminal city. It was a saving
to the motor carriers. It resulted in
savings to the community.
“In some cases motor trucks and
trailers were returned to terminal
points in ‘piggyback’ fashion.
“It must not be overlooked that
transport can contribute much to the
raising of productivity in the building
industry.”
T raffic.
“I see from Press reports there are
to be further conferences here to deal
with traffic problems. Why not im'
plement the plans which contain the
solution already submitted by our
Town Planning Authority. It was
noticeable in all the large cities visited
that traffic problems were dealt with
in a courageous and vigorous way.

There was no piecemeal bites at the
‘cherry’. If any nation can be said
to be suffering from traffic jams it is
America. They are affecting city
business and creating serious economic
problems. But they are being effec-
tively and efficiently rectified by the
Americans. Let me give you an
example:
“Chicago has a traffic problem like
other cities. It has also slum prob-
lems as well as obsolescent buildings.
Travelling to the city was an irritating
experience as well as a costly one as
far as parking was concerned. A
group of private building enterpreneurs
created a new shopping centre 20
miles out. New housing estates were
developed. All services provided.
Shopping facilities were attractive, en-
ticing and just what was desired by
the housewife. Adequate and con-
venient parking areas. No restrictions.
No fees. No risks of being skittled
by passing traffic. Patronage was at-
traced thereto from as far afield as
twenty miles. Modern merchandis-
ing methods were installed. Parcels
and packages were delivered to a pick-
up spot in the parking area. No
bundles to carry around whilst shop-
ping elsewhere. This venture was
publicised and rightly so as ‘A New
Design for Living.’
“But what of the reaction in
Chicago? Business was being affect-
ed. Rate values were dropping.
Municipal income was lower. It was
found more profitable to demolish ob-
solescent buildings and leave the
vacant space for parking. Municipal
Authorities decided to build multiple-
storeyed parking stations. Nine are
planned for construction in the City
of Chicago. Public gardens were
being uprooted and parking facilities
were being provided underneath; the
gardens were then replaced. Depress-
ed areas were being swept away and
handed over to private enterprise to
develop. Multiple-storeyed flats were
being erected. Adjoining areas to the
flats, although not owned by the flat
proprietors, were being beautified
without expense to the adjoining
owners. The view for flat dwellers
was important. But the traffic prob-
lem was being tackled —and solved.
It was solved in the only way possible
—a vigorous, co-operative effort by
private enterprise encouraged by a
system in which all are free to com-
pete for the job of doing it.
“Mention of co-operative effort
leads me to refer to the great need for
co-operation back home.
“We were privileged to sit down in
discussion with leaders of industry as
well as leaders of labour in the city
of San Francisco. It was heartening
to hear the representative of the
Unions say that labour in America
co-operated fully with Management in
promoting any scheme or plan which
had as its objective the beautification
of their city, the improvement of bet-
ter service, the raising of living stan-
dards; any plan which resulted in the
creation of employment opportunities.
Having jointly worked on the prepara-
tion of the plan they enthusiastically
worked for its completion,” Mr.
O’Keeffe declared.
“In America there is much evidence
of civic pride. Any movement de-

This imposing group of buildings was designed and erected by Sir Christopher
Wren and other architects of the Eighteenth Century, though the beautiful "Queen's
House" seen in the background between the two main blocks was the work of
Inigo Jones in 1653. The site had been used as a royal residence since the
Fifteenth Century, and Henry VIII and his daughters Elizabeth and Mary were
born there. In 1705, under William and Mary, it became a hospital for old
sailors, but since 1865 it has been the Royal Naval College, and 1,100 sons of
British seamen are accommodated in the Royal Naval School. Below is the famous
Painted Hall, on the walls and ceiling of which are paintings by Sir James Thornhill.
The Naval Museum is fascinating and contains models of ships of all ages, and
specimens of naval machinery and apparatus of all types, though the greatest
show of all is the fine collection of Nelson relics, including the coat that he wore
at Trafalgar, with the fatal bullet hole in it.

signed to make a city more beautiful,
more attractive, receives full support.
Plans were talked about at every op*
portunity. The enthusiasm engender*
ed became contagious. The plans,
when completed, would permit them
to use some superlative in describing
the results. It was competition in
another form competition as to
which city was the most attractive, the
most beautiful or which handled its
traffic more efficiently than any other
city in the world.
“If the use of superlatives is an
encouragement to greater efforts by
Australians, by all means let us use
them to describe what we are going
to do—but, above all, let us carry the
effort through to completion.”
Mr. O’Keeffe, in a plea for the co*
operation of management and labour,
said: “We need active participation by
all sections of industry in our attempts
to get things done.”
Building Centres.
“From the observations made in
London and Rotterdam particularly, I
am of the opinion that the establish*
ment of a Building Centre in Mel*
bourne is a necessity for the Industry
of Australia.
Both centres mentioned, as well as
those in America, are now self*
supporting. The set*up of the Amen*
can Centres is developed as a business
proposition rather than an educational
one.
“Manufacturers in Australia should
give attention immediately to ways
and means of providing such a centre
which would serve as a permanent
tracted thereto from as far afield as
locally and abroad,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.
With a view to publicising new
materials, I must mention what is
being done by the Producers Council
of the United States to bring infor*
mation to young Architects, Engineers
and Builders about the various pro*
ducts of their members.
“Colour transparencies of various
products are prepared giving informa*
tion as to how the product or mate*
rial is made, what it is used for, how
it is applied, what are its advantages.
Each set of transparencies, of which
there are several copies made, is as*
sured of distribution to some 20,000
students throughout the States. They
are also displayed for the benefit of
members of the industry in outlying
centres. Later, an exhibition caravan
tours the countryside with specimens
and samples of materials and so mem*
bers of the industry are kept informed
of new developments and materials.”
T axation.
Mr. O Keeffe concluded by refer*
ring to taxation, with its important
bearing on greater productivity.
We are, I believe, among the
highest taxed people in the world.
So taxed to enable us to meet the
heavy cost of social services. Such
contributions can only come from In'
dustry. If Industry is to produce more,
it must be encouraged. One wav of
encouraging Industry is to ease this
burden considerably.
“For taxation purposes, depreciation
on all classes of buildings, I gather, is
an allowance deduction in America.
This money is used in the business
and helps to provide funds to moder*
nise buildings. The modernisation of
buildings is a big contributing factor
to high productivity- I think the
Team will recommend that the Gov*
ernment should examine its policy in
this connection and so encourage sav*
ings for later capital investment,” he
added.

Lecture.
The subject for the evening was an
address by Mr. J. Lederer, A.S.T.C.,
M.I.E.S. (Aust.), on “3D Cinema
Projection and Some of Its Problems.”
DISCUSSION.
At the conclusion of Mr. Lederer’s
address, several questions were asked
and answered.
Question 1. — Mr. Knight, referring
to the fact that an image of an object
seen by the human eye is inverted on
the retina, asked why people did not
see things upside'down. In reply, Mr.
Lederer said that this question had
puzzled the early research workers for
many years, but about 400 years ago
they reached the conclusion that the
actual seeing was done by the brain
and not by the eye. In consequence,
the image as seen by the eye is again
inverted so that the brain receives the
image in its correct position.
Mr. Knight also referred to the' re'
marks by Mr. Lederer that, in his
opinion, the driver of a car relies
more on the use of the motion parab
lax phenomena than true stereopsis
when judging the distance and the
speed of objects to either side of his
line of vision.
Question 2.—-He asked Mr. Lederer
to elaborate on this statement. Mr.
Lederer replied that the judgment of
distance by the driver of a vehicle
would naturally depend on a large
number of factors, but he considered
that the speed at which the objects
would pass through the visual field
would be such that the motion parab
lax would be the most pronounced
factor in the judgment.
Question 3.—Mr. Stewart Lay re'
ferred to the fact that during the war
both the R.A.F. and the R.A.A.F.
used as a basis for many of their tests
on the aircraft pilots the parafoveal
stream of vision. Mr. Lay enquired
as to whether this particular pheno'
menon was at all related to the pre'
viously referred to motion parallax.
To this question Mr. Lederer replied
that for some time it was considered
necessary for all pilots to have good
stereopsis, until it was later found that
pilots with poor stereopsis were pass'
ing the necessary examination just as
effectively. In direct answer to Mr.
Lay’s question, he stated that there
was little or no difference between the
parafoveal stream of vision and mo-
tion parallax—that they were virtually
one and the same thing.
Question 4. —Mr. Lay also asked
the lecturer to elaborate on the term
“motion parallax.” To this, Mr.
Lederer replied that to judge distance
when one is moving, two factors are
taekn into consideration: (A) the
direction in which one is travelling,
and (Bj the speed of action relative
to the fixation point.
Question s.—Mr. S, Beecher then
enquired of Mr. Lederer as to whether
a stereoscopic or 3D screen could be
made from a steam or vapour'filled
container on to which the image
would be projected. Replying to this,
Mr. Lederer pointed out that such a
scheme would not be at all satisfac'
tory, because if the image projected
on to this type of “screen” was flat
there would be no stereoscopic effect
produced, as the resultant image itself
would be flat.
Vote of Thanks.
A vote of thanks to Mr. Lederer,
having been Proposed and seconded,
was carried by acclamation.
BEHAVIOUR OF BUILDING
MATERIALS IN TROPICAL
REGIONS.
In this latest “Notes on the
Science of Building,” the Division of
Building Research, C.5.1.R.0., has
set out the causes of deterioration of
building materials under tropical con'
ditions, and has suggested means of
minimising untimely damage. The
performance of metals, cement and
concrete, masonry products, timber,
paint, and bituminous materials is
discussed in relation to the weathering
factors in tropical parts, and from
this knowledge it is possible to esti-
mate the probable behaviour of a
building material under conditions
varying from temperate to tropical.

Latest Trends in Design and Use of Interior Building Boards
By M. H. JONES. *
Oue of the Papers delivered in the Symposium on Methods and Materials arranged
by the Australian Institute of Builders at their Annual Conference held in Brisbane
on June 23rd, 1954.
I would like to say that I am not
unmindful of the fact that my
thoughts are being expressed to lead-
ers of the Building Industry and also
to those who have formed this Insti-
tute with the object of promoting
and advancing the study and practice
of building and all kindred matters
here in Australia.
However, when my working career
commenced my parents told me that
I would be the fifth generation of
the family to enter the Building In-
dustry and probably the third genera-
tion in Australia, so with this thought
in mind, I have come along with
some enthusiasm, for it is less than
two years ago my Company sent me
to visit America and England to
study the latest trends in the use of
these materials.
Until recent years, Australia has
been basically an agricultural coun-
try, and as such we have not had
the industrial means at our disposal
to manufacture on a large scale any
kind of materials for ourselves.
Because of this, during the early
years of this country the Building In-
dustry has had to depend largely on
a very limited assortment and supply
of natural materials for our needs or
a small quantity of imported goods
which very frequently proved too
costly for average use.
These circumstances, naturally
enough, caused internal house linings
in those days to become monotonous
and eventually uninteresting, but our
recent developments in manufacture
of more interesting building mate-
rials is not now only rapid and ex-
pansive but most valuable to this
country, which appears to possess
the greatest potential for develop-
ment in the world to-day.
In the past, transport difficulties
within Australia frequently deter-
mined what kind of material people
could use, and so some material
proved common to certain localities
and more or less unknown in others.
Progress in Lining Materials.
Our progress in lining materials
used in Australian building practice
to date appears to have been as
follows:
Bush cut slabs.
Tongued and grooved boards.
Galvanised iron with both large
and small corrugations.
Timber lath and plaster.
Ornamental metal panels.
Plywood.
Fibrous plaster fixed with battens.
Fibrous plaster fixed with flush
joints.
Asbestos-cement sheets.
Fibre boards such as Cane-ite.
Hard-boards such as Masonite, Tim-
brock and Burnie Board.
Plaster board such as Gyprock or
Gypsum wall-board (Victor).
Of the more modern boards, we
find that at least Gypsum-board, fibre-
board and hard-board are quite new
to Australia, but we must remember
that they have been tried and proved
both on the Continent and particu-
larly in America for very many years.
Last year, more than 1,250,000
houses were erected in America, and
it would be safe to say that the great-
est number of these would have been
lined with Gyprock, sheathed with
fibre or Gypsum-board and provided
with cupboards and other fittings
fabricated with hard-board. In addi-
tion to the particular properties for
which these materials are made such
as insulation, acoustics, fire-resistance,
etc., they also give added strength
and rigidity to the wooden frame.
Fibrous Plaster and Gypsum
Wall-board.
To first discuss plaster boards, we
have in Australia two principal types,
namely, Fibrous plaster, which has
been in use since about 1911, and
Gypsum wall-board which was first
manufactured here about eight years
ago.
Fibrous plaster sheeting is peculiar
only to Australia and New Zealand.
It was first introduced about 1911,
when it was fixed with battens in
panel formation, and it was not until
the early 1920’s that the flush joint
finish was developed. The more
modern development in this field in
Australia is Gpyrock, manufactured
in Sydney, or Gypsum wall-board,
which is made in Melbourne.
The principal difference between
these two materials is that fibrous
plaster sheeting consists of plaster of
Paris reinforced with sisal fibre,
while Gypsum wall-board is composed
of plaster of paris placed between
two sheets of plaster lining board.
A further difference is the fact
that the manufacture of fibrous plaster
is largely a manual process; equip-
ment is simple and inexpensive, which
means that the industry lends itself to
decentralisation. On the other hand.
Gypsum wall-board is produced by
mechanical means involving extensive

equipment and high capital cost.
There are advantages to be claimed
for Gypsum wall-board, such as speed
of manufacture, ease of handling,
ease of transport, readily adaptable to
bending and decoration. The art of
application can also be readily ac-
quired by most building tradesmen,
which should, of course, in these
davs of labour shortage be an extra
advantage.
In America, where Gypsum wall-
board lining is now universally used,
it is described as “Dry Wall Con-
struction ” because the board has not
to be wetted before the flush joints
are formed, and this is also an ad-
vantage as the timber framework is
not subjected to the usual wet condi-
tions and consequent swelling and
drying-out periods during erection
as is usual with other materials.
When one is inclined to question
the quality or usefulness of such
material, it is reassuring to know
that in 1952 3,060,000,000 square
feet were manufactured and used in
the United States, and we understand
that factory production figures have
since increased.
This board, of course, is fire-
resisting and is finished as a plain
flush wall. The cement and rein-
forcement used for jointing are such
that the internal angles between ceil-
ing and walls can be finished without
a cornice, if desired.
Asbestos Cement Sheeting.
Asbestos cement sheeting is also a
common material in Australia, but
one cannot help but be impressed
with the quantities used in America.
It is also interesting to note that in
this country we have always used
asbestos cement in large sheets
as an external covering to timber
frame houses, while in America
small shingles about two feet long
and one foot wide are generally used.
These shingles are now being very
satisfactorily coloured and produce
some most attractive effects. Gener-
ally speaking, overseas asbestos cement
sheets are much thicker in section,
which is probably possible because of
various economic conditions.
The most recent production in
asbestos sheeting overseas is known as
Flexboard, and this can be bent and
fixed after setting without anv pre-
paration or difficulty to a radius of four
to six feet or flatter. When such mate-
rial can be produced in Australia, we
will have contributed quite a lot to
the usefulness of asbestos sheeting.
Fibre Boards.
Fibre boards, both hard and
soft, are also making their presence
felt in Australia and no doubt fill a
need of considerable importance. In
addition to their usefulness as insu-
lating or acoustical boards, they are
produced from materials that would
otherwise be wasted and so frequently
render yeoman service and also save
other valuable natural resources for
work which of necessity requires
their special properties. This aspect
is most important in a country where
natural timber resources are very
limited.
In the case of soft fibre board such
as Cane-ite we are able to use as raw
material a residue from the sugar in-
dustry known as Maggase or Bag-
gase, together with other ingredients,
while the hard-board, such as Mason-
ite, Timbrock or Burnie Board is
largely produced from the fibres of
small scrub timbers which probably
would otherwise be of no value.
Cane-ite, of course, is available in
standard or low density qualities and
has given to Australia its own board
of insulating and acoustic qualities.
This material when well fixed is
also decorative and can readily be used
with every assurance of obtaining a
pleasant ceiling or wall lining and
from experience insulates a dwelling
very satisfactorily.
I believe if wooden dwellings in
Australia were sheathed on the out-
side of the studding with Cane-ite be-
fore the asbestos sheeting is applied
the extra costs would soon be saved
in heating costs and add very con-
siderably to the comfort of the home.
Cane-ite is also a splendid insulator
for cool rooms, refrigerators and the
like.
A further useful and decorative pur-
pose is to use this material in the
form of Acousti tiles for both ceil-
ing and walls and, while not yet used
as extensively as we would like, is a
very popular material overseas.
Hard-Board.
Hard-board, too, has become most
popular in Australia, both during and
since the period of World War 11,
and has found innumerable uses.
This board can be pbtained in vary-
ing widths up to 4ft. 6in. and 14ft.
long or more. An important feature
also is the fact that it can be termite-
proofed and tempered. This material
can be easily bent or cut and because
of its strength and general robust
nature can be used with confidence
where all kinds of hard wear and tear
are likely to occur.
Popular use for hard-board is lin-
ing to internal walls, manufacture of
furniture and joinery, together with
the lesser uses of floor surfaces, lin-
ing of transport vehicles, caravans,
trailers, trains ships, aircraft, tele-
phone booths and crating purposes.
Plywood.
Plywood, of course, is well known
to us all and appreciated for its great
usefulness.. The manufacture of this
material probably commenced in Aus-
tralia about 1915, and to-day there is
at least one plywood factory in every
State, with more than one in some.
Probably the most recent advances
with this material is the production of
water-proofed ply and also the plaster
surfaced sheets being specially pre-
pared for concrete formwork.
This material was proving most
popular in the United States, where
the builders were finding it possible
to considerably reduce the usual
quantity of combing and so on, usually
necessary when this special plywood
formed the decking.
American Production Figures.
By way of interest, some produc-
tion figures from America for 1952
are available and quoted as follows:
3/16in, Hard-board, 1,002,000,000
sq. ft., or 6.6 sq. ft. per head of
population.
This compares with a production of
150,000,000 sq. ft. produced in Aus-
tralia, or approx. 19 sq. ft. per head
of population.
iin. Fibre-board, 2,242,000,000 sq.
ft., or 15ft. per head of population.
This compares with 30',000,000 sq.
ft., or sq. ft. per head of popula-
tion.
Gypsum Wall-board, 3,060,000,000
sq. ft., or 20.4 sq. ft. per head of
population.
Plywood, 3,178,000,000 sq. ft., or
21.2 sq. ft. per head of population.
Before 1914, architects and build-
ers and property owners were limited
to the use of T. 6? G. boarding, ex-
pensive fabricated wooden panels or
wooden laths and plaster, but to-day
w e can choosen between hard-boards
for rough wear and tear, fibre-boards
for insulation and acoustical uses, and
plaster-boards for fire-resistance and
good flush, finishes, all of which can
be obtained in sheet form and conse-
quently cover large areas in one ap-
plication, easily applied, give added
strength and stability to the frame-
work, very flexible in use, be bent or
applied to all kinds of plan shapes,
used and reused on work of a tem-
porary nature, used for display pur-
poses, as well as on structures of a
permanent nature, worked with ordin-
ary tools, decorate beautifully and,
from the manufacturer’s point of view,
make the builder’s work a pleasure
and generally relieve him of all those
worrying problems which in the past
had usually interfered with his game
of golf.

NEW PARKE DAVIS PLANT
£1,250,000 CHEMICAL FACTORY NEARING COMPLETION
AT CARINGBAH, SYDNEY
Situated on a 27-acre site at Caring-
bah on the Southern shores of Botany
Bay the new £1,250,000 chemical fac-
tory and research unit being erected
for Parke Davis & Co. Ltd. is rapidly
nearing completion, and production is
scheduled to begin in June and to be
in full swing in September.
It is claimed that the factory will
be the most modern and elaborately
equipped pharmaceutical plant in the
Southern Hemisphere.
The plant is devided into three
units administration, production
with which is linked amenities and
social welfare) and power.
The production centre which is
the dominating feature of the con-
struction, is a building with an over-
all length of 550 feet and a width
of 330 feet, providing a total floor
space of 165,000 square feet.
The production centre has a lower
ground floor of 71.000 square feet
and measures about 550 feet by 130
feet.
The layout of the production build-
ing makes possible an in-flow of raw
materials from the southern end of
the building and the processing of
the materials in a forward flow until
they finally leave the despatch section
at the northern end of the plant.
The lower ground floor is used for
garages, engineering services, bottle
storing and cleaning plant and carpen-
ters’ workshop.
A hydraulic lift operates between the
two floors for bringing heavy materials
or equipment on to the production
floor.
Provision of almost continuous win-
dows on the production floor and in
the perpendicular faces of the saw
tooth roof provides excellent natural
lighting. The sawtooth roof is hid'
den from the outside by raising the
side brick walls.
Amenities.
Entry to the production floor is by
way of the staff amenities block, a
two'storey building of some 18,000
square feet of floor space.
This block houses change and toilet
rooms, a cafeteria, rest rooms, recrea'
tion rooms space for dancing and a
theatrette.
The building has a 65-foot tower
to house the water tank for servicing
the fire sprinkler system throughout the
remainder of the plant.
The tower, and the design and situ'
ation of the amenities block in rela'
tion to the production centre, provides
the focal point of the complete project.
The administration building lies at
the northern end of the project and
consists of two storeys and a partial
basement, each floor having an area
of 14,000 square feet and the partial
basement an area of 4,600 square feet.
The building has a ventilation sys'
tern which provides a change of fib
tered air every ten minutes. A Lam-
son tube system connects the floors
of the administration building to each
other as well as to the finished stock
section in the production centre.
A separate building at the southern
end and behind the production centre
houses the boiler equipment for steam
used in production, and two diesel
generators for use in case of a power
failure.
Architects are Spencer, Hanson and
Blackman and Master Builders F. C.
W. Powell and Son.

Transport Department had purchased
the Company’s present building at

THE MASTER BUILDER AND INSURANCE
Address given to Members of the Main Northern Branch of the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W. by Mr. C. A. Fox, Manager of Employers’ Mutual
Indemnity Association Ltd.
Gentlemen,
I have been asked to address you
regarding insurance in relation to your
responsibilities as Master Builders.
In the course of business you em-
ploy people under your direct control;
you engage sub-contractors to perform
some of the work and they in turn
may have their own employees on your
job; you also may have members of
the public on the job. To each of
these classes of people you may under
certain circumstances have a very real
liability if they meet with injury.
You are, of course, all aware that
the Workers’ Compensation Act of this
State demands that you shall have a
policy of insurance to indemnify you
in respect of your liability under that
Act. All workers in your direct em-
ploy must be insured unless their earn-
ings exceed £2,000 per annum. A
recent amendment of the Act also pro-
vides that you shall insure against your
liabilitv to your employees at Common
Law for an amount of £3,000.
Certain of your responsibilities as
employers are defined by Statute, i.e.,
by Acts of Parliament, and you mav.
of course, obtain these Acts and ascer-
tain the extent of your responsibility.
However, your liability at Common
Law is one which is not defined in any
Act, but is one which has arisen by
the decisions of our Courts of Justice
over many centuries, relating to a per-
son’s rights where he has been injured
by another person. Thus the extent of
your liability has no limit as the guilty
or negligent must pay for the
damage he has caused, as awarded by
the Judge or Jury.
Workers’ Compensation.
I will deal now with your liability
to your own employees. You are
bound to insure against your liability
under the Workers’ Compensation Act
and in the event of injury the insurer
assumes your liability, in accordance
with the Policy it has issued, and your
responsibility under that Act should
not reallly worry you further. How-
ever the Policy issued by the Insurer
is based on the intormation supplied
by you on the Insurer’s proposal.
The proposal form not only asks
vou to define your trade or business
but may ask certain questions regard-
ing use of machinery; the employ-
ment of members of your family;
whether you desire to cover your sub-
contractor’s employees, etc. It is
therefore of paramount importance that
the proposal be correctly completed.
The Policy issued by every insurer,
as far as your liability under the
Workers’ Compensation Act is con-
cerned, is uniform because its form is
set out in the Workers’ Compensation
Act. The Policy clearly defines your
trade or business and the insurer’s lia-
bility is limited to workers directly
employed by vou in that industry or
work incidental or not incompatable
with the stated industry. Thus if a
Policy states that it covers the workers
engaged in “Building Construction’’
and the employer also has workers en-
gaged in poultry farming or some other
trade or business outside the scope of
building construction, the insurer would
not have liability for an injured worker
in the latter occcupation.
If a Building Contractor has em-
ployees engaged in demolition, dam
construction, bridge building, etc., or
even a joinery shop it is essential that
you acquaint your Insurer of this fact.
Common Law.
In the event of a worker receiving
an injury because of the negligence of
his employer, or of one of his fellow
workers, or through some defect in
the employer’s premises or plant, he
may recover damages at Common Law

independently of the Workers’ Com'
pensation Act. In fact he may recover
compensation under the Workers’ Com'
pensation Act and also sue his employer
at Common Law. However, he is not
entitled to retain both compensation
and damages, and if he succeeds at
Common Law he has to refund the
compensation.
Negligence may be defined as the
commission of an act which a reason'
able man would not do or the omis'
sion of an act which a reasonable
man would do in the circumstances.
It is essential that employers should
exercise the utmost care and super'
vision of their plant and machinery for
not only is it a condition of your
Policy of Insurance, but it is very
necessary in order to minimise claims
at Common Law. As the Law stands
today, it is almost a certainty that you
willl be liable if a worker gets caught
in a machine, for no matter how well
your machine is guarded, you will ah
most assuredly be found guilty of neg'
ligence, because if the machine were
properly puarded he would not get
caught.
You may extend your Insurance
Policy to cover your liability at Com'
mon Law to whatever amount of pro-
tection you desire.
Sub-Contractors and Workers’
Compensation.
Probably most of you, in the course
of carrying out a contract, employ
what are known as “subcontractors” to
perform part of the work which you
as principal have contracted to do.
It is not to be assumed that because
you sub'contract your work that you
are not responsible to some extent for
the sub'contractor. You cannot neces'
sarily avoid responsibility by delegating
part of the work you, as principal, have
contracted to perform.
The Workers’ Compensation Act
provides that the employee of a sub'
contractor may recover compensation
from the principal for injuries he re'
ceives on the iob. You in turn as
principal have the right to recover this
amount from the subcontractor, but if
the subcontractor is not insured and is
without means, you will, of course, be
left lamenting. It is essential, there'
fore that you make certain that vour
subcontractors have current a Workers’
Compensation Policy of Insurance, or
that you specifically arrange a cover
for them.
The fact that you may “get a price”
from a person to carry out part of your
contract does not necessarily mean that
he is not a worker whom you are
directly liable to compensate under the
Worker*’ Compensation Act. A broad
test as to whether such a person is a
worker and thus entitled to be in'
sured is whether the person is subject
to a direction and control in the car'
rying out of the work he has allegedly
contracted to perform. Even if the
principal does not actually exercise
direction and control the person is
still a I ’worker” if the principal actu'
ally had that authority. If this person
doing this work agreees only to pro'
duce a given result but is not subject
to control in the actual execution of
the work, he is an independent con'
tractor.
Sub-Contractors and Common Law.
The question of liability of a prim
cipal for the negligence of a contractor
apart from the Workers’ Compensation
Act, or, in other words, at Common
Law, is not a simple one. The prim
cipal is under a duty, not only to take
care, but to see that care is taken. He
cannot escape liability by delegating
this duty to another, whether that
other be servant or independent con'
tractor.
Subject to this, however, a prim
cipal is never liable for what is called
collateral negligence of an independent
contractor as it has been said that acci'
dents arising from what is called
casual or collateral negligence cannot
be guarded against beforehand. This
is illustrated by such a case as one in
which «.ne of the contractor’s work'
men placed a tool on a window sill,
not in the courses of the work which
the contractor was employed to do,
and the casement being blown by the
wind, the tool fell and injured a person.
It was held that this was collateral neg'
ligence and the principal was not
liable. But it has been pointed out
that it is not always easy to decide
whether a negligent act is collateral or
not. Probably the best explanation
means that collateral negligence is noth'
ing more than that in order to make
a principal liable the negligence must
be negligence in the doing of the
thine contracted to be done and not
negligence in the doing of things in'
cidental to that project. For instance,
if a principal engages a contractor to
make an excavation in a street he will
be responsible for the negligence of the
contractor in failing to light or guard
the excavation, but he will not be re'
sponsible for his negligence in, say,
carting material to or from the scene
of the operations, because the doing
of such things is outside the principle
of the rule that certain things are
dangerous and can only be done at the
principal’s risk.
Under the present law, as promuL
gated by such Acts as the Law Re'
form (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, if
a principal be sued for damages for the
negligence of a contractor, he is em
titled to insist on the contractor being
joined as a defendant in the action
and it is possible to have the damages
awarded the injured party assessed and
apportioned between the principal and
contractor according to what the jury
or other tribunal might consider the
respective degrees of culpability. In
practice, however, the injured party
generally sues both the principal and
the contractor and the same result is
achieved.
Liability to the Public.
Thert is also the question of the
liability of the principal for damage
to the person or property of members
of the public. This liability is, of
course, one of Common Law.
You must not forget that even if
your building project is well away, and
perhaps adequately fenced off from the
members of the public, that certain

Recent Developments In Building Materials Research
By lAN LANGLANDS.*
One of the Papers delivered in the Symposium on Methods and Materials arranged
by the Australian Institute of Builders at their Annual Conference held in Brisbane
on 23rd June, 1954.
The broad aim of building materials
research, whether private or Govern-
mental, is to facilitate the construc-
tion o fmore, better and cheaper
buildings. The building research
worker has not only to apply in his
particular field the continuous ad'
vances that are taking place in science
and technology, but he also has to
consider changing social conditions—
such as availability, cost, skill and de-
sires of labour and the requirements
of the occupants—as well as the natu'
ral resources of the particular country
in which he is working.
It is commonly thought by the
man'in'the'street that the work of
scientists engaged in building materials
research consists largely, if not em
tirely, of inventing and developing
entirely new products. This, of course,
is not so. The greater part of the
effort of all building materials re'
search laboratories is devoted to im'
proving, cheapening and increasing
production of existing materials and
finding out how to use them more
efficiently and in new ways. Experh
ence shows that this method of ap'
proach leads to improvements and de'
develments of very great value, all
the more so because progress is evolu'
tionary rather than revolutionary. In
an industry of the vast size and age'
old traditions of building, revolution'
ary developments affecting the whole
industry are most unlikely, if for no
other reason than the enormous quam
tides of materials required.
12,000,000 Tons a Year.
It may not be generally realised
that building in Australia uses
12,000,000 tons of materials annually,
the value of which is of the order of
<£150,000,000. It is possible to reduce
considerably the quantity, if not the
cost, by methods discussed later, but
even if in the future buildings were
constructed entirely of the newer
lightweight materials the quantity re'
quired would still be some hundreds
of thousands of tons, whereas the total
world production of aluminium and
plastics (two of the most promising
of the newer materials) is only a few
million tons.
Although there is no sign of any
entirely new materials that have the
technical properties, availability and
low cost necessary to revolutionise
building, very significant changes are
occurring that are likely to have a
marked influence on the building of
the future, and it is my purpose tO'day
to draw your attention to some of
what I consider to be the more im'
portant of these. I am well aware
that much of wdiat I shall have to say
will not be new to you, but it may be
of interest to have it collated in an
organised way.
Trend to Lightweight
Construction.
The modern trends in building are
to lightweight construction, reduction
in the site labour, and the greater use
of standardised or semi'standardised
factory'built components of increasing
size, and it will be apparent from
what follows that, as is natural and
proper, building materials research is
being directed along these lines.
With present materials and building
techniques the load'bearing structure
of a building, particularly a large one,
has to be designed mainly to carry
its own weight. Thus the weight of
a multistorey building is about five
times greater than the live load which
it is designed to carry. It is there'
fore apparent that any marked sav'
ings in weight will have a worthwhile
effect on cost and at the same time
will conserve materials—a most im'
portant factor when one realises the
enormous and increasing demands our
rapidly increasing population is mak'
ing on our very limited supply of
building materials. The ideal, of
course, is a strong but weightless and
inexpensive material; but even, with
all its amazing achievements, science
has not yet been able to devise such
material, and I don’t think I am be'
ing unduly pessimistic when I say
I don’t think it ever will! However,
it is quite possible even with our pre'
sent materials to reduce the weight of
a conventional building by 50% or
more.
The most obvious way of lighten'
ing a building is to use light but
strong materials such as aluminium
instead of brick, steel or reinforced
concrete. It must always be borne
in mind, however, that buildings are
different from structures such as air'
craft and other transport vehicles in
that, except in special circumstances,
there is no virtue in light weight for
its own sake and, in fact, it is a dis'
advantage from certain angles such as
sound transmission and comfort in
hot, dry weather. The weight of an
aluminium structure is half to a third
that of a steel structure of the same
strength, but the cost is about four
times greater. This difference in cost
may decrease to some extent as time
goes on, but unless radically new
methods are devised the method of
production of aluminium is such that
it will always be much more expen'
sive than steel and its use in building
will be confined to structures such as
large'span roofs where the dead
weight greatly exceeds the live load
and to places where its corrosion re'
sistance, ease of working, attractive
appearance, excellent thermal proper'
ties and the ability to obtain compli'
cated sections are important. There
is no doubt that aluminium will play

an increasingly important part for
these purposes. In U.S.A. the con'
sumption of aluminium in building in'
creased from 9,000 tons in 1940 to
350,000 tons in 1953.
However, it is not necessary to
have recourse to comparatively expen'
sive aluminium to reduce weight.
Marked reductions can be achieved by
using steel more efficiently by fire-
proofing it by lightweight plaster and
by the use of lightweight aggregates
in concrete.
Savings in Steel.
From the weight aspect, rolled
steel sections are relatively inefficient
for carrying ordinary roof and floor
loads, and the welded lattice member
has been highly developed of recent
years not onlv for such purposes as
arch roofs but also for the secondary
beams of a steel frame. It has been
found by experience that savings of
40% in the amount of steel required
for roof structures can be made by
using this type of construction, thus
enabling our very limited supply of
steel to be greatly extended. Another
development of a somewhat similar
nature is the production of pressed
light steel sheet suitable for use either
in lightly loaded framed structures or
as wall, floor or roof sheathing, alone
or in combination with insulating or
fire'resisting materials.
Lightweight Aggregates.
It is well known that, when heated,
steel (and still more aluminium) loses
its strength at comparatively low
temperatures and, in fire'resistant con'
struction, it is necessary to protect the
metal by a protective casing. The
usual way of doing this is to encase
the steel frame with concrete, thus
increasing the dead weight some four
times and reducing the load carrying
capacity of beams and girders by
nearly 10%, This is the main cause
of the great weight of fire'resistant
construction. However, recent re-
search, mainly in U.S.A., has shown
that lightweight plaster rendering can
be used in place of concrete for pro'
tecting the steelwork, so saving nearly
90% in the weight of the protective
coating and 67% in the total weight
of the member. Lightweight plaster
is made by mixing an ultra'light (7
to 10 Ib./cu.ft.) aggregate, such as
exfoliated vermiculite or expanded
perlite, with gypsum plaster to form
a rendering having a density of only
30 to 40 Ib./cu.ft. Vermiculite is no
longer available commercially in Aus'
tralia and is imported from South
Africa, but extensive work at the
Division of Building Research has
shown that very high'quality perlite
can be produced from the extensive
deposits of volcanic glass (obsidian)
located in the vicinity of the Queens-
land/New South Wales border. The
Division has given a good deal of at-
tendon to the manufacture and
properties of perlite from Australian
ore and has designed an experimental
furnace of novel design that has
been used as a basis for the produc-
tion furnaces now operating in Mel-
bourne and Wellington, New Zealand.
In view of the criticism that is so
often levelled at building regulations
authorities, it is pleasing to record
that the idea of fireproofing by the
use of lightweight plaster has been
accepted in at least two Australian
cities —Melbourne and Adelaide.
Lighter Concrete Construction.
Like steel, reinforced concrete con'
struction can also be lightened very
greatly. Although by no means a
new material, it is only since the war
that synthetic lightweight aggregate,
such as bloated clay or shale, has be'
come popular in U.S.A. for building
purposes. Certain clays and shales,
when burnt at | high temperatures,
have the ability to bloat or expand.
In the method of manufacture most

used in U.S.A. the raw material is
bloated in a rotary kiln or sinter grate
■and then crushed after cooling, but
a superior if slightly more expensive
aggregate is produced is clay is pel-
litised or shale crushed before burn-
ing—this giving a smooth, relatively
non-absorbent surface skin leading to
a much more workable mix. The
Division of Building Research is in-
vestigating the suitability of Austra-
lian clays and shales for this purpose,
and it has been shown that there are
large deposits of suitable material in
N.S.W. and Victoria. Queensland
clays have not yet been thoroughly
investigated, but it is known that clay
near the Archerfield airport bloats
very well.
To give an indication of the
quality of concrete that can be obtained
using this type of aggregate, it may
be mentioned that aggregate, having
a density of 50 Ib./cu.ft., made from
a Sydney shale, when used in a 1:6
mix, produced concrete weighing 85
Ib./cu.ft. (compared with 145 lb./
cu.ft. for ordinary concrete) with a
compressive strength of 7,200 lb./
sq.in. at 28 days. Although the cost
per cu. yd. of synthetic lightweight
aggregates of this type may be 25 to
50% greater than that of natural
aggregates (the actual difference de-
pending largely on fuel and transport
costs), the savings in weight point to
considerable overall economies in
multi-storey buildings, bridges, etc.,
and there) is no doubt that when
they are produced commercially in
this country they will find a ready
market. Unfortunately, there has
been little interest in Australia the
commercial production of lightweight
aggregate, but it is likely that, as a
result of work carried out by the
N.S.W. Universitv of Technology,
supplemented by further investigation
at the Division of Building Research,
a plant having a capacity of 200 cu.
yds. per day will be in production in
the vicinity of Sydney within a few
months.
Foamed Concrete.
Another way of reducing the
weight of concrete without losing too
much strength is by using air or gas
•as an aggregate, i.e., by foaming or
aerating cement paste or thin mortar.
This process has been developed to
its [highest pitch in Sweden and is
now widely used in Europe in the
manufacture of precast units ranging
from blocks for masonry wall con-
struction to large floor or wall slabs
and lintels. Foamed concrete suffers
from a tendency to excessive shrink-
age and dimensional changes due to
moisture variations unless manufac-
tured under close control and cured
in autoclaves, and if a high-grade
produce is to be produced the capital
expenditure on plant needs to be
high, and this has reacted against the
success of the material in this country.
The Division of Building Research
has recen ly been working on a very
similar autoclaved product made from
lime and ground silica. Some very
high strengths have been obtained
with this material; for example, a
compressive strength of 9000 lb./
sq.in. has been obtained at a density
of only 65 Ib./cu.ft. Atlthough more
expensive than foamed concrete, its
exceedingly high strength/weight ratio
could be taken advantage of for cer-
tain purposes such as precast rein-
forced roof slabs where its high ther-
mal insulation and good mechanical
properties could be used to advantage.
Savings of 30% or so in weight of
concrete structures can be made by
pre-stressing, but I shall not discuss
this important development, as it has
been dealt with by Mr. Cavanagh in
his paper.
Before leaving concrete, I would
like to draw your attention to a
method of concrete floor or roof con-
struction, used in U.S.A. in conjunc-
tion with the open well or lattice steel
joist floors referred to earlier. A
special combined form and reinforce-
ment is made by attaching a galva-
nised steel reinforcing mesh to a
tough cord-reinforced water-resistant
paper backing in such a way that the
reinforcement is completely embedded
in the concrete. This avoids the
usual expensive formwork and greatly
facilitates construction.
Wall Sheeting Panels.
The non-load-bearing exterior walls
of multi-storey frame buildings are
conventionally constructed of brick or
concrete. Such walls are weather-
proof. durable, fire-resistant and amply
strong. On the other hand, they are
heavy and bulky and require a great
deal of site labour. In U.S.A., much
attention is being given to the devel-
opment of thin lightweight wall
panels that can be secured to the
structural frame without scaffolding.
These so-called “curtain wall’’ panels
vary considerably in construction and
size, ranging from the 8-ft. x 8-ft. x
5-in. thick precast concrete panels
(consisting of two If in. thick faces
of reinforced concrete with a in.
core of insulating material such as
foamed glass) used in the Electro-
Metallurgical building in Ohio to the
coloured porcelain - enamelled sheet
steel faced panels with cores of paper
honeycomb filled with granular insu-
lation and having an overall thickness
of two inches, used in the General
Motors Building near Detroit, and
the two-storey height (21 -ft. 3-in.),

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


4-ft. 8-in. wide, 0.102 in. thick alu-
minium panels which enabled 20,000
sq. yds. of exposed wall of the 26-
storey 99 Park Avenue, New York,
to be sheathed in 6 \ days (I notice
that this has been bettered this week,
when a 22-storey building at 460 Park
Avenue was sheathed in one day).
In the U.N. Secretariat Building,
£in thick heat-absorbing glass is used
as the walling material, and this
example has been followed on other
American structures, notably Lower
House. (These glass walls are backed
with a 4in. thick wall of brick or con-
crete to dado height to prevent spread
of . fire and personal hazard to the
•occupants.)
Throughout the world innumer-
able designs have been proposed for
non-loading partition walls of large
buildings and for the lightly loaded
walls of dwellings and similar small
buildings. Some of the most promis-
ing of these are made from gypsum
plaster—a material of particular in-
terest to Australia because of the
enormous deposits of gypsum that
occur particularly in South Australia.
One system that has gained favour
in England and several other coun-
tries is known as “Bellrock.” Panels,
usually 4ft. x 3ft. x 4in., are made
with a hessian-reinforced honeycomb
core with plaster faces. The wall is
built up by placing the panels on top
of and alongside each other, and
plaster or concrete is poured down
channels left between the panels to
give structural stability. Like all
systems using plaster, “Bellrock”
walls cannot be exposed to the
weaker. and a waterproof skin such
as brick veneer or weatherboard or
asbestos-cement sheathing has to be
erected.
Reinforced Plaster Walls.
However, what appears to me to be
a better system of i,<j ing plaster was
patented by Mr. T. C. Moritz, of
Glossop, S.A. Large load-bearing
reinforced wall slabs, 2g:in. thick, are
cast on horizontal tables in a factory
and are assembled on the site. Plaster
has a big advantage over concrete for
such a type of construction in that it
sets in about half an hour, enabling
the slabs to be lifted within an hour,
compared with at least 24 hours for
concrete. Thus the capital invest-
ment is low. The erected cost of
plaster walls of this type is from half
to two-thirds of brick and timber
walls. One serious difficulty in the
further development of this idea is
the lack of technical knowledge of
the properties and behaviour of rein-
forced plaster and the Division of
Building Research is making an ex-
tensive investigation into the charac-
teristics of reinforced plaster gener-
ally.
So far I have made no mention of
the material that has been greatly
talked about —plastics. Because of
their cost, plastics are not likely to be
used as structural members, but do
have a very useful function in build'
ing for specialty purposes. An inter'
esting example is “Holoplast,” a
resin'impregnated kraft paper formed
into hollow panels up to Bft. x 4ft.
in area and lin. or l#in. thick, the
thinner panels weighing about 2
lb./sq.ft. The material is fire-resistant
and durable, it has a high resistance
to chemicals and can be painted. It
is used mainly for light partitions,
but in England “Holoplast” panels
have been used in schools for both
external walls and partitions, the
frames being of steel and aluminium.
Use of Plastics.
The more common applications of
plastics in building—floor and wall
coverings, glazing, equipment and
fittings, electrical and thermal insu-
lation, plumbing—are too well known
to be discussed here, but I would like
to mention a new use of plastics' of
great interest to builders —that is,
spraying the structure with polyvinyl
solution to form a continuous
weather-proof skin. With the trend
towards dry construction using large
prefabricated units, the problem of
waterproofing, particularly the joints,
has arisen. The usual way of doing
this is by caulking the joints with
mastic, and the Division of Building
Research has given a good deal of
attention to caulking compounds of
this kind. However no caulking
material has an indefinite life, and
the idea of covering the whole struc-
ture with a coloured continuous and
flexible skin is attractive. It arose
from the use of such a skin for
“moth-balling” aircraft and ships,
and under the trade name of “Liquid
Envelope” the material is now avail-
able commercially in Australia. For
external use, on horizontal surfaces
such as roofs, the skin should be 30
to 40 thousandths of an inch thick,
but on vertical surfaces the skin can
be thinner, say 20 thousandths thick.
The life is claimed to be about 12 to
15 years for indoor use and 8 to 10
years for outdoor use; after this an-
other coat can be applied without
the need of removing the original
skin.
Structural Plywood.
Before concluding I would like to
make a very brief reference to some
recent uses of glued laminated timber
and of structural plywood. Using
resin glues, it is possible to build up
large sections of complicated shape
from small pieces of wood, thus en-
abling the timber to be properly
dried and selected. Some spectacular
examples of this type of construction
were seen in Sydney during the
Royal Tour, used in the various
decorative arches. Large sheets of
plywood up to 25ft. x 7ft. with
resin-impregnated surfaces and cap-
able of being used 50 times are
available for use as concrete forms
for large structures where the appear'
ance of the concrete is important.
If building is to discharge its great
responsibility of providing the rapidly
growing population of Australia with
shelter —not only to eat and sleep
in, but to worship in, to study in, to
work in and to play in—it must take
full advantage of modern technologi'
cal developments, and I am confident
that you, as members of the Austra'
lian Institute of Builders, are anxious
to give ideas such as the ones I have
discussed tO'dav, a “fair go” and to
co'operate in finding out how best
they can fit into the pattern of Aus'
tralian building practice.
SELECTIVE METHOD OF
TENDERING.
Recommended by British Committee.
“Only by selective comeptition as
against indiscriminate tendering, can
the building owner expect a good job
at a fair price and good standard.”
This statement appears in a recent
report by the Joint Committee on
Tendering Procedure in the U. K.
Building Industry. The Committee,
which recommended universal use of
selective tendering, was appointed at
the suggestion of the Minister for
Works early last year.
The report pointed out that most
local governing bodies still invited
tenders from all and sundry—a prac-
tice believed to be attributed to a
desire to avoid any suggestion that
the authority might not be acting
impartially in selecting the firm for
the work, and also to the erroneous
view that this led to the most econo-
mical building.
The Joint Committee on Tender'
ing Procedure submitted that all local
authorities, who were responsible for
3 5 per cent, of all building contracts,
should adopt selective tendering. It
pointed out that, though substantial,
the cost of tendering was but a small
part of the overhead costs. Neverthe-
less, this cost had to be allowed for
in the price of building and was a
justification for limiting the number
of tenders invited . It emphasised the
choice of the right type of contract
for particular projects and recom'
mended several types, but for normal
use a lump sum contract, based on
bills of quantities, was advocated. The
committee favoured abolition of the
fluctuating clause in contracts.
The need for the maximum degree
of advance planning was stressed by
the committee.
On general questions the committee
said: “Professional bodies and con'
tractors’ associations have an equal re'
sponsrhility in rooting out inefficiency,
discouraging malpractices, and placing
before the public the example of good
practice and fair dealing.”

SHELL COMPANY OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED
NEW GEELONG REFINERY.
Impressive Administrative and Amenities Buildings.
The administrative area of Austra-
lia’s new oil refinery of The Shell
Company of Australia Limited at Gee-
long comprises most up-to-date amen-
ities buildings. It is indeed a rare occa-
sion in industrial architecture to have
a grouping of such buildings, each
building having its own distinctive per-
sonality. The architecture is contem-
porary and pleasing but utilitarian and
each building is designed for its own
poupose and for local conditions.
The administrative area which
covers five and a half acres provides
three specific sections (a) office, (b)
laboratories, (c) amenities.
A Garden Setting
This administrative section is in the
forefront of the area where the re-
finerv has been built. It is planned in
a garden setting designed to bring the
whole of the buildings together into
one cohesive unit. The garden setting
bears a definite relationship to the am-
enities building so that the staff during
their lunch hour and other free time
can use the gardens for recreation.
The buildings have been planned to
provide for possible extensions with
accent on obtaining the maximum of
lighting. The buildings can be extend-
ed horizontally and vertically as re-
quired, and the programme is flexible
for these extensions when required.
The amenities section will not only
provide for the staff of the administra-
tive area, but for all the refinery em-
ployees.
The laboratory block is completely
self- contained and has been divided
into numerous sections providing for
round-the-clock working.
In the amenities section, there are
showers; change rooms; kitchen and
dining rooms; recreation rooms and a
first-aid section. There will also be
kiosks for the purchase of goods.
The architects for the whole of the
area were Buchan, Laird 6? Buchan,
and the contractors, I. C. Taylor
Sons Pty. Ltd. of Geelong.
The office block in the administra-
tive area has been designed on a modu-
lar system to allow for complete
flexibility of internal partitions.
The layout provides individual offi-
ces for one or two employees, con-
ference rooms, general offices with sep-
arate insulated sections to provide
noiseless working for typewriters, tele-
printers and also for the P.A.B.X.
equipment. The building is already to
be extended to double its present size.
The design of the office block has
for perfect working conditions. The
building has been sited with its main
sides to the south and north and, on
the north, there are louvred sun hoods
to exclude sunshine.
A relatively new means to Australia
in heating buildings has been provid-
ed in the buildings. The floors are
heated by means of coils buried in the
floor, through which hot water at a
temperature of approximately 110 deg.
passes. This system enables the struc-
ture not the air, to be warmed.
The roofs of the buildings are flat
to conform with the normal practice
of the Shell Company in their refin'
eries throughout the world and are,
of course, all insulated. Internal col-
ours have been planned to be restful
to occupants and in many cases are
unusual.
Car parking is excluded from the
area except in exceptional cases where
some space is provided adjoining the
office. The reason for excluding car
parking is to retain the garden effect
of the whole area.
In the office building, built-in cig-
arette lighters are provided, because,
due to fire risk, employees have to
leave their safety matches at the gate
before entering.
The Amenities Block
Colour has been used in the amen-
ities block of the administrative area
to provide a relaxing effect. It is a
most modern building and, probably,
the most modern in Australia, so far
as providing amenities are concerned.
It is expected that at least 500 mem-
bers of the staff will use this section.
There are four dining rooms and a
kitchen will work on a cafeteria sys-
tem. Staff members may also eat in
another large, glass-walled dining room
situated on the first floor. Off the room
is a spacious open sundeck, overlook-
ing the landscape gardens. Provision
has been made for two smaller dining
rooms for use by company executives.
The kitchen has the latest equip-
ment, including deep-freeze refrigera-
tion and a large multiple pressure
cooker; a modern dishwashing machine
has also been installed. After meals,
the staff can relax on another sundeck
at the rear of the building, overlooking
Corio Bay.
The walls of the dining rooms are
intended to induce harmony and relax-
ation by means of colour variation.
The colours used are pink, green,
cream and blue. As in the administra-
tive block, electric cigarette lighters
are provided because matches are not
allowed in the area.
A section of the block provides
washing and changing rooms, and
members of the staff will have indi-

vidual lockers. The shower and toilet
rooms are tiled jn light green, eight
feet up the walls. A series of circular-
spraying fountains, controlled by the
foot, have been provided for washing'.
There will be two large tanks of
boiling water brought from the main
refinery furnaces, and the building will
be heated with steam from the same
source by coils buried in the floor. A
special room has been set aside for
clothes drying lined with heated cop-
per pipes.
The Laboratories Block
The three separate wings of the
laboratories, joined by the administra-
tive section in the administrative area,
include the various offices, library,
locker rooms etc.
There is an experimental wing rof
testing engines and, at the end of the
laboratory, is a small building to be
utilised as a sample store for various
products. It is from this store that
these products are brought to the lab-
oratory for testing purposes. The other
wings are known as shift laboratory for
night workers, and day laboratory.
The main laboratory section is filled
with benches equipped with all manner
of services, such as gas, electricity,
compressed air and vacuum, and there
are rooms where the flash point of
various fuels can be tested. Balance
rooms have been specially designed
with balance tables completely isolated
from the surrounding building to pre-
vent vibration.
All laboratory wings are built above
the floor, so as to provide easy access
for repairs when required, to the nu-
merous services which occur within the
laboratories.
At the main entry to the laboratory
section, there is another room which
can be used for lectures and for the
showing of films. All these buildings
also are heated by the method of heat-
ing coils buried in the floors.
There are also various forms of arti-
ficial ventilation throughout the build-
ing, such as exhaust ventilation in
cupboards to prevent gases accumulat-
ing. Acid-resisting drains have been
constructed as a fire-proofing protec-
tion and there can be quick egress
from buildings should a fire occur.

NEW, IMPROVED GOODS LIFT.
A Queensland Patent.
By F. O. NIXON.
The need for an automatic, electri'
cally operated goods lift, requiring re'
latively small floor space and a carry'
incr capacity of approximately five
hundredweights, to serve either ground
floor and basement, or any number
of floors, has been a long'felt want.
This need can now be satisfied with
the installation of the Crane and For'
rest lift, made in South Brisbane.
The lift was patented three years
ago and has been brought to a state
of efficiency and reliability to satisfy
its manufacturers and users, as well
as covering the requirements of the
Machinery and Scaffolding Dept, in
its Lift Code.
An installation in which the plat'
form is 3ft. lOin. by 3ft., with a load
capacity of approximately five hum
dredweight, serving ground floor and
basement, can be installed for from
.£5OO to £6OO, depending on type of
necessary protection surrounds. A
four'floor installation could, under the
same conditions, be installed for ap'
proximately £l,OOO. When these prices
are compared with the very high cost
of installing the passenger lifts set'
vicing all floors of a high building, it
will be realised how much more use
can be made of rooms below or above
the ground floor, to which access is
given by stairways, when these small
cageless lifts are installed. The absence
of a cage on the lift proper allows
the goods to be taken out front or
back on bottom and intermediate
floors, and on any of four sides on
the top floor of an installation.
There are radical differences in the
Crane and Forrest Lift which, instead
of having wire ropes and balance
weights, exerts a main principle of
worm and wheel drive to pinions,
which engage racks in the two sides
of the lift.
But, like other lifts, it is automatic
in its electrical and mechanical opera'
tion. If, for any reason, the enclosure
such as passenger lifts are provided
with, are required, these can be pro'
vided, though with some reduction in
the maximum conveniences that the
lifts without them provide.
The picture, taken from photograph,
gives some idea of the simplicity of
the invention.
The engineering fim fo.GF. nrCa

and would be pleased to give a de'
monstration on any of the seven in'
stallations at present in Brisbane.

Melbourne’s Degraves Street Subway
Nears Completion
UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE TO FLINDERS STREET STATION.
Various proposals have been put
forward over the years to cope with
the exceptionally heavy flow of
pedestrians to and from Flinders
Street Station, one of the busiest of
the world’s rail terminals. With the
outbreak of the last war, all plans
for subways and other methods of
meeting the problem had to be
shelved, and in the immediate post'
war years city development projects
were held up because of a shortage
of manpower, materials and money.
In July last year, however, a start
was made on the Degraves Street sub-
way and, when completed, it will ex-
tend from the centre entrance to the
Flinders Street Station to Degraves
Place, off Degraves Street, on the op-
posite side of Flinders Street. Under
Flinders Street the subway will be
flanked by two rows of shops. The
existing railway subway at the centre
entrance to the station is 15 feet
wide. The scheme provides for this
subway to be widened back to Nos. 2
and 3 platforms, and the new width
of 25 feet will be in one span. The
subwav will then open out to 32 feet
6 inches at the new check barriers,
where it will join the Melbourne City
Council’s construction under Flinders
Street roadway. Data for determining
the desirable width of the subway and
the number of barriers to be provided
was obtained by making a tally of
passengers using the station’s centre
entrance.
Access to Princes Bridge.
Provision is made in the plan also
for a new stairway leading to No. 1
platform from the east wall of the
subway This will give a ready means
of access to Princes Bridge Station
from all platforms. A further new
stairway will run from the west side
of the subway, under No. 1 platform,
to street level. It will open on to
the south footpath of Flinders Street.
A new suburban booking office will
be built in the subway under the south
footpath of Flinders Street and, just
outside the new barriers, facilities for
booking at street level will still be
provided in the existing building.
Work on the railway section of the
subway is proceeding to schedule.
Under No. 1 platform, Flinders
Street, an excavation extending the
full width of the Degraves Street bar'
rier entrance and 15 feet below plat'
form level is rapidly taking on the
shape of the new subway. The re'
taining wall for the west side of the
subway is under construction, whilst
two ramps for stairways from platform
level to subway floor have already
been excavated from No. 1 platform.
On completion of the retaining wall,
the existing stairway from Nos. 2 and
3 platforms will be rebuilt to con-
nect with the new project.
Immediately the subway section and
stairs connecting Nos. 1, 2 and 3 plat'
forms are completed, that portion of
the work will be opened for public
use. A parallel length of existing
subway will then be closed to enable
essential alterations to take place.
These include the construction of a
new underground switch room.
Only a thin wall of earth now sepa'
rates the work being carried out by
the City Council and that under the
control of the Victorian Railways. A
section of the underpinning immedi-
ately under the Degraves Street en-
trance to No. 1 platform rests on the
border of the two projects, and men
on both sides of the wall are looking
forward to the break-through and
the Degraves Street subway becomes
an actuality.
MODERNISING BUILDING
REGULATIONS.
Britain’s Model By-Laws.
New Book Available.
For many years Architects and
Builders have been expressing the
view that the Regulations governing
building in Sydney—and, in fact,
Australia generally need revising;
modernising and standardising. Those
with experience in building will
agree on this issue, for it is prac-
tically impossible to undertake any
building pjoject without running up
against some by-law, ordinance or
regulation that imposes some out'
moded and outdated restriction upon
their operations.
At the recent Architectural Conven-
tion, both Professor Gropius and
Professor Robert Matthew spoke on
the subject, the latter referring to the
new Building Regulations just issued
in England in which a completely
new approach has been made by in'
troducing Performance Standards
which specify to what degree the
building, or its parts, must be cap'
able of performing, but not making it
obligatory to adopt any specified form
of construction.
The Ministry of Housing and
Local Government in Great Britain
in 1952 issued “Model Building By'
Laws,” and this has been followed in
July last year by a Revised Code.
Charles Knight 6? Co. Ltd., Local
Government Publishers, of London,
have just produced an annotated
model By-Laws, Vol. I, Buildings,
covering the decree and giving de'
tails of Relevant British Standards
and Standard Codes in Practice.
This most instructive volume goes
right through the Code and clause by
clause explains and illustrates by dia'
grams the various points. . As such,
it makes an admirable reference for
the study of the latest thought in
these matters. All interested in this
subject and the need for bringing
our own Acts up to date should
secure a copy of Knight’s.

EYE TROUBLES OF OFFICE WORKERS
ACCURATE SEEING INCREASES PRODUCTION AND IMPROVES
MORALE.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER, New York.
A young stenotypist for many
months suffered from severe head-
aches in the late afternoon which
bothered her and reduced her work-
ing capacity. She blamed a previous
sinus trouble, too little sleep, fatigue
and exhaustion. Eventually an eye
doc:or found out that she was near-
sighted, and prescribed the correct
glasses, and the headaches ceased im-
mediately and forever.
Near-sightedness may produce head-
aches as well as dizziness, nausea, feel-
ing of pressure in the head.
Troubles from Poor Vision.
Troubles from uncorrected vision
are more frequent in office work than
in those occupations where the strain
on the eyes is not as great. You won-
der why your fellow-worker on the
next desk does his reading and writ-
ing with the upper part of his body
bent forward, closer to his work. He
did not do that a year ago. He may
also look through the rims of his
glasses in order to see more clearly,
instead of through the centre of the
glasses as he is supposed to do. His
eyes have changed during the last
year, he needs other glasses.
Testing Eyes.
How does your doctor find out the
kind of glasses you need?
The degree of near-sightedness and
of other troubles of vision is deter-
mined by the optic strength of the
lenses which are needed to correct it.
The degree of concavity or convexity
to which the lenses are ground is ex-
pressed in Diopters. A lens is con-
vex if it bulges outwards from its
centre, and concave if it is excavated
towards its centre. The lenses scatter
or gather the rays of light which fall
unon the eyes so that the correct'spot
on the retina (the nervous tissue in
the background of the eye) is
reached by them and a sharp image
of the object is projected upon it.
You See Better
You Work Better.
Inaccurate seeing is a frequently
overlooked factor which can affect
production to a significant degree.
The advantages of good illumination
are, according to the Illuminating
Engineering Society: Greater accuracy
of workmanship, resulting in im-
proved Quality of the product, with
less spoilage and re-work; increased
production and decreased costs; bet-
ter utilisation of floor space; greater
ease of seeing, especially among older
employees, thus making them more
efficient; less eye'Strain among em-
ployees; improved morale among em-
ployees. resulting in decreased labour
turnover; more easily maintained
cleanliness and neatness in office and
plant; and greater safety.
Your work will be better and more
efficient when you feel well and at
eas<> in your office, and you will feel
well only where good illumination
helps you to avoid eye-strain.
Trend to Bright Illumination.
The trend to progressive- use of
bright illumination and bright paint
colours for increased safety and im-
proved production has been going on
for years. Without investment in aid-
ing the office workers’s seeing ability,
employers will miss the full advantage
of an employee’s potential skill for
production and efficiency. The clearer
the office worker sees his object, the
more valuable he is to production.
Many industrial lighting manufac-
turers now are producing semi-direct
fluorescent industrial fixtures which
provide an upward component of
light. Some of the units allow only
5 to 10% of the light to travel to the
ceiling, but large manufacturers have
re-designed their units to allow almost
half the light to go up through a
large centre opening. This results in
good brightness, with a minimum of
glare. Supplementary lighting sources
—at the point of working—should be
carefully designed so that the light is
confined to the immediate working
area.
How to Measure Light.
Light is measured by the foot'
candle'meter or illuminator, an inex'
pensive instrument, easy to handle.
But determining the exact amount of
light required in your office should
not be estimated by a non-expert with
unaided eyes. Trained technicians
need scientific instruments. Everybody
knows, of course, that good illumina'
tion is needed for reading and writ'
ing. But this is not all.

ing Society:

LINE LIGHT REFLECTION
Simplicity of line plus light plus reflection make this characteristically modern home
in California a thing of beauty. Blended with the surrounding scenery the reflections
in the water ponds which flank its walls, progressive variations of colour, light and
shadow, present an everchanging kaleidoscopic picture every hour of the day.

nation of general illumination and
supplementary lighting at the point
of work is needed. One hundred
footcandles is approximately 1% of
maximum daylight.
Design and installation of com-
bined illumination must not only pro-
vide a sufficient amount of light but
also the proper direction of light dif-
fusion for eye protection. It should
eliminate direct and reflected glare, as
well as objectionable shadows.
You feel uncomfortable when sun-
light or artificial light glares into your
eyes, or when it is reflected from
such bright surfaces as glossy paper
and tabletops and walls. Such things
are actually harmful to your eyes, and
you should not read when the page
is brightly illuminated while the rest
of the room is comparatively too
dark; this combination may produce
eye-strain and fatigue.
It is a strange observation that
three times as much light is required
for reading a newspaper as easily as a
well-printed book printed with the
same type. Light acts as a magnifier
of small details. An object must be
about twice as large to be visible
under one footcandle of light as it
would have to be under 100 foot-
candles.
Ageing Eyeis.
To-day more people of advanced
age are busy in offices than in former
years, for people .live longer to-day
and stay longer young and efficient.
Industry and business have more re-
spect for the kill and experience of
older workers gained in many years
of hard work.
Those older office workers will be
more productive if good illumination
is granted them. Usually between 40
and 45 years “old sight’’ (presbyopia)
begins to appear. This change is a
normal development due to the loss
of elasticity of the lens of the eye.
Properly corrected by glasses, it will
not harm the office worker’s efficiency.
A man of 42 or 45 years, who always
had an excellent eyesight, may note
one day that he must push his work
(or his head) further and further
away to gain exact vision.
Eyes which grow older need more
light for accurate seeing. Strong
illumination is needed for somewhat
aged eyes . It produces a helpful con-
traction of the pupils, and this in-
creases the vision temporarily.
Much can be done to give relief
to those ageing eyes of office workrs.
Different glasses may be needed for
working at close range and reading—
and for seeing in distance. Many
office workers use two pairs of glasses,
and some of them use three pairs, the
third pair being used for typewriting
which is too far for reading-glasses
and too close for distance glasses.
Others use bifocal glasses, the upper
part of which is ground for distance
seeing, while the lower part is ground
for objects at close range such as
reading and writing. If the condition
of old age sight be uncorrected, you
may suffer from pain in your eyes,
fatigue, shedding tears, dimness of
vision, and headache.
Regular Lamp Maintenance.
Advantages from improved lamp
performance are nullified if the lamps
are permitted to collect dust and dirt
without regular periodic cleaning.
Shop housekeeping, office house-
keeping are important factors in good
lighting. Even where conditions are
favourable, 25% more light than the
necessary minimum has been recom-
mended by experts. However, in
places where dirt and dust will col-
lect rapidly, and where adequate
maintenance is not provided the
quantity of light should be at least
50% above the minimum require-
ments.
Many lighting installations are
cleaned only as the lamps fail. This
may not be so serious with an incan-
descent lamp which _collects only
1.000 hours’ (one to three months)
dust. But such negligence is more
important when a fluorescent lamp
collects 2,000 hours’ dust, or when a
cold cathode tube collects 8,000 or
10.000 hours’ dust (six to eight
months).
The difference between good
(65%) and poor (45%) maintenance
of incandescent light equipment can
be compared to the difference between
300-watt lamps and 500-watt lamps
for the same average lighting.
Influence of Colour
on Illumination.
It has been proved in extensive
studies that bright, contrasting finishes
result in increased safety and effi-
ciency, as well as improved employee
morale. Modern finishing practice to-
day calls for overall application of
light instead of dark grey or green
finishes.
In many offices and shops, a well-
designed lighting system is robbed of
its efficiency by dingy interior sur-
faces. This was shown in scientific
findings conducted jointly by Du
Pont Company colour technicians and
Philadelphia Electric Company illumi-
nating engineers. In these tests var-
ious sections of a workroom were re-
painted in high light-reflective colours
in order to increase the illumination.
The coefficient of light utilisation
in the room was no more than 27%.
The ceiling was refinished with light
cream paint; by this simple procedure
alone, the coefficient of light utilisa-
tion was raised to 35%. In successive
steps the side walls were refinished
with a neutral green—dark tables and
chairs were replaced with blonde furni-
ture —and the dark maroon floor was
recoated with white floor paint
stippled with spruce brown.
By this planned use of all reflecting
surfaces, the coefficient of light
utilisation was brought up to 55% —
an improvement of more than 100%
over the original arrangement. And
this was achieved without installing
any additional lighting equipment!

B.I.C.C. 132 kV. ALUMINIUM-
SHEATHED OIL-FILLED
CABLES.
In 1951, British Insulated Cab
lender’s Cables Limited supplied and
installed the world’s first 33kV.
aluminium'sheathed Impregnated Pres'
sure cables, and they have now re'
ceived an order from the British Elec'
tricity Authority for the first 132kV.
aluminium'sheathed oil'filled cables to
be installed in England. The cables,
which are of single core construction,
are part of a contract awarded to
8.1.C.C. for the supply and installa-
tion of both lead-sheathed and
aluminium'sheathed 132kV. oil'filled
cables in the 275kV. substation at
Elstree, Hertfordshire.
The contract is of particular inter-
est, not only for the first use of
132kV, aluminium'sheathed oil'filled
cables in England, but because it
provides a unique opportunity for
comparing, under identical working
conditions, the characteristics of this
cable with the conventional lead-
sheathed oil-filled cable of the same
voltage.
The aluminium-sheathed installation
will include three straight joints which,
although of standard electrical design,
will involve the application of plumb-
ing techniques developed from experi-
ence of jointing lower voltage
aluminium-sheathed cables.
The cable consists of an Bmm. oil
duct round which is formed the con-
ductor, consisting of 57/.102 in. plain
copper wires, giving a sectional area
of the conductor of 0.45 sq. in. Over
the paper insulation is a metallic
'screen and a copper woven fabric
tape. The aluminium sheath is 0.11
in. thick and, when swaged down,
gives the cable a diameter of 2.35 in.
The protection consists of layers of
P.V.C., rubber and hessian tapes. The
overall diameter of the cable is 2.81
in. and the weight is 16.81 b. per yard,
This compares with the lead-sheathed
cable which has an identical conduc-
tor size, but has an overall diameter
of 2.59 in. and weighs 23.71 b. per
yard. The bending radius is similar
for both cables.
The aluminium-sheathed cable is
designed to operate at a maximum
stress at the conductor of 85kV./cm.
The installation will be carried out
this year by British Insulated Cal-
lender’s Construction Company Limit-
ed, and will involve laying the cables
direct in the ground and terminating
them in outdoor type sealing ends.
10 Storey Flats In 30 Days
The main structure of a 10'Storey
block of flats at Mannheim, Germany,
was recently cast within 30 days.
No more than 40 men did the job
by a revolutionary mechanical method.
Concrete aggregate was discharged
from a truck into a sunken silo, from
which it fell through two holes onto
a conveyor belt (1).
The belt, consisting of two sections,
delivered into a batcher, being con'
trolled by the operator of the concrete
mixer (3) who, with simple hand con'
trols dumped the material into the
hoist of the mixer (4), at the same
time as the requisite amount of cement,
drawn from the cement silo (2), was
added.
After the automatic addition of
water from the water wagon, right,
and a mixing period of 90 seconds, the
mix was automatically discharged into
the bucket of the hoist, which moved
at a speed of 2 ft. per second to the
storey under construction.
On arrival, the bucket was automati'
cally emptied into a container from
which the mix was released by pulling
a lever (5) onto a chain of conveyor
belts (6 and 7) and finally into a hop'
per (8), through which the moulds
were filled in layers.
Quick Casting.
By this highly mechanised method,
one'half of each storey (see sketch)
was cast in three hours by eight men.
The preparations of moulds for walls
and ceilings was done by 200 more men
and another 12 were employed on all
necessary work on the site. At no
stage during construction were more
than 40 men working on the project.
RESEARCH AT BIRMINGHAM.
Birmingham University has a gas
turbine made in its own workshop.
With it graduates will study air flow
through the machine. Later a wind
tunnel is to be built as part of a half
million pound (sterling) extension to
the mechanical engineering block at
Edgbaston.

A PLACE TO LIVE.
The last word on house design and planning will never be said. The successful home is that which
within its compass, be it large or small, provides facilities and amenities for the living and enjoyment
of a full life by all members of the family. This may be a tall order, for it may not be possible
for the teenager to enjoy the full vitality of the radio "hit-parade" in one room and father to read
his paper in comfortable quiet in another, yet such, in effect, should be the aim. We illustrate
four more variations of this housing theme, all of which, except the top right, which is somewhat
larger, have similar accommodation assembled together in different form.

persons, who in law are termed in'
vitees, are entitled to visit the project
even though they may not be there
at your express invitation. These, for
example, may be architects, inspectors,
carriers, tradesmen seeking employ'
ment. etc. You may be liable to com-
pensate these people, if through your
negligence they receive personal injury
or damage to their property. It
should also be remembered that the
law insists upon a greater degree of
care in the case of children, even
though they be trespassers, and build-
ers and contractors have frequently
been held liable for injurj.es to child-
ren by such things as concrete mixers,
even if they be left well away from
the roadway, and even in some cases
on fenced lands if children could have
easy access to them. The principle
being that such objects are more likely
to attract children than adults, and that
children are not so aware of danger.
Insurance Protection.
From the foregoing it will be obvi-
ous that persons entering into con-
tracts, the performance of which, of
their nature, indicates that Injury may
befall some person, be he a member
of the public or an employee of the
contractor, should protect their liability
by adequate insurance, both under the
provisions of the Workers’ Compensa-
tion Act and by what is known as
public risk indemnity.
It is of great importance, however,
that the person seeking such indem-
nity should always have in mind the
necessity for giving his insurer full
details of the nature of any such con-
tracts and that care should be taken
to strictly comply with the conditions
of the policy containing the indem-
nity.
Thermolux The New Glazing Material
By PETER POULSEN.
Windows for industrial and com-
mercial buildings should be designed
to have the following functions:—
1. To let the daylight in;
2. To distribute it as evenly as
possible throughout the room.
3. To shut direct sunlight out.
4. To keep radiated heat (sunrays)
out.
5. To keep conducted heat (on a
sultry day) out.
6. To keep sound out.
A newcomer on the Australian
building scene is Thermolux Glass,
which does just these things.
Thermolux is a compound glass,
consisting of two sheets of window
glass with a layer of glass fibre in be-
tween, sealed into one unit. (See
Figure 1.) It is translucent to light.
In narrow city streets, when day-
light comes in under very steep angles,
Thermolux diffuses it throughout the
room, no matter what the angle of
incidence may be. On the other
hand, dangerous glare from even an
overcast sky (in top floor rooms) will
be reduced by Thermolux and un-
bearable brightness contrasts will be-
come less severe.
Direct sunlight, dangerous to the
retina, will not penetrate Thermolux,
and thus one of the worst office and
factory hazards can be eliminated.
Thermolux is translucent to light.
It is white in appearance and its gentle
lustre must be seen to be appreciated.
Because it is white, it reflects radiated
heat and does not absorb it. There-
fore, it keeps cool and does not re-
quire additional sun protection by
means of louvres or awnings. But
Thermolux also keeps out conducted
heat because the multitude of air
bubbles enclosed in the glass fibre are
one of the worst conductors of heat.
Soundproofing of buildings has
made amazing progress during the
last few years, but only half the job
is done when most of the street noise
comes in through the windows. Ther-
molux, therefore, is the logical com-
plement to soundproofed walls and
ceilings.
If in an office building some trans-
parent window space is required (be-
cause you cannot look through Ther-
molux) a compromise (part Thermo-
lux and part clear sealed double glaz-
ing) is the answer as indicated :n
Figure 2. (T for Thermolux.)
Thermolux as a true multiple pur-
pose material is just as ideal for roofs
(sawtooth and others) and office par-
titions as it is for windows. In
colours, it makes sound-absorbing
church windows and modern shop
fronts.

MORE A.G.E. LOCOS FOR
AUSTRALIAN RAILWAYS.
Australian General Electric Pty. Ltd.
has secured an order, valued at approxi-
mately £600,000, for six main-line
diesel electric locomotives from the
Department of Railways, N.S.W. These
locomotives will each weigh 110 tons,
will be fitted with 1,750 h.p. engines,
and will be capable of a speed of 70
m.p.h. They will be used for fast
passenger services and express freights.
The power units and control gear,
traction motors (of which there are
six per locomotive), come from the
A.G.E., and the mechanical parts and
the complete assembly of the locomo-
tives will be undertaken by A. Goninan
6? Co. Ltd., of Newcastle.
Australian General Electric Pty. Ltd.

the Team. He said that Australia
would be enriched by the observa-
tions of the Team.
Mr. Holt said he could see nothing
to stop the present prosperity of the
country being maintained. The pre-
sent buoyancy had created a man-
power shortage in the country. In
1951 there were too many men for
the jobs, now there were more jobs
than men.
It was very necessary that the
highest productivity should be obtain'
ed from all sections of industry,
To achieve this end it was necessary
that there should be cooperation be'
tween management and labour. There
must be restraints on the part of
management as well as on the part
of those enjoying full employment.
Indications pointed to greater co-
operation, and all must realise that
the welfare of one was bound up with
the welfare of the other.
“We accept as one of the obliga-
tions of government the provision of
conditions making for full employ-
ment,” Mr. Holt added.
Among the guests were Sir John
Latham, President of the Australia-
America Association, which Mr. Doyle
said did much to help the arrange-
ments of the team in America; Mr.
A. Monk, President, and Mr. G.
Broadby, Secretary, of the Australian
Council of Trade Unions; and repre-
sentatives of the U.S. Consulate and
the British Trade Commissioner.
Congratulations were extended by
his many friends at the 8.1. C. luncheon
to Mr. D. B. Doyle, President, on his
award of the 0.8. E. in the Queen’s
birthday honours list.
Mr. G. J. Connor, economist of the
Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of
Works, has been awarded the Smith-
Mundt Fulbright Scholarship to study
town planning and local government.
While in America he will study the
financing, administration and imple-
menting of town planning. In re-
cent weeks Mr. Connor has been

which the Board has prepared. He is
visiting all the municipalities. The
information which Mr. Connor gains
while abroad will be of great value
to the State Government and to the
Body appointed to implement Mel-
bourne’s master plan.
PIPE TO RESIST CHEMICAL
ACTION.
Low-cost concrete pipe carries off
corrosive oil refinery wastes in an
economical system made possible by
a new industrial coating based on
highly inert Vinylite resins and pro-
produced by Inertol Co., Inc.,
Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A. This
coating permitted the substitution of
concrete pipe for expensive glazed
pipe. Hydrocarbon residues flow freely
through pipe lined with this coating
because Vinylite resins, on which both
primer and finishing coats are based,
resist chemical action and deteriora-
tion. Before delivery interiors of the
pipe sections are sprayed with this
coating, crating a smooth, durable
surface which helps expedite disposal
of the destructive residue. Thousands
of feet of this coated concrete pipe
have been installed at the Esso Stand-
ard Oil Company refinery, Linden,
New Jersey, U.S.A., with savings in
labour a swell as material costs. Con-
crete pipe is available in longer sec-
tions than conventional clay sewage
disposal pipe. Less labour is required
for handling and there are fewer
joints to seal.
PACKAGED ALUMINIUM IGLOO.
A novel semispherical building of prepared aluminium sections has been constructed
at Longview, Texas, U.S.A., by R. G. Le Tourneau Inc. Assembled about a 94 ft.
mast, the sections are fitted starting from the top. All work is done at ground
level and lifted by a winch, the lower sections being attached as the assembly rises.
It is claimed that the building is dust-proof and weather tight and the sections cost
less than four dollars a square toot. TOP: The completed dome of this Igloo is
85 ft. high and 300 ft. in diameter. As an auditorium it could seat 12,000 people.
Ventilation is through the conical section fitting at the top. LOWER: The interior
of the dome, fitted with acoustical baffles. The central mast may be removed when
completed to leave a clear circular ground space of 70,686 sq. feet.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
Surveyors will start work this month
on the Housing Trust satellite town
area north of Salisbury. The project
will include several thousand homes.
Some contracts have already been let
and sub-contracts arranged. Work
will begin in the area known as
Fatchen’s paddocks, just off Gawler
Road. House foundation crews will
start operations in August and brick-
layers in September. It will probably
be October or November before car-
penters move in, and plumbers are
expected to be on the job early in
Tanuary. February has been set as
the deadline for many of the dwellings
in the new town to be occupied.
, The Premier (Mr. Playford) an-
nounced in 1950 that the satellite
town had been proposed to provide
for an urban population of up to
25,000. In the same year the Trust
bought 4140 acres in the area. Since
then the land has been occupied un-
der either grazing or agriculture
licence. Lessees have been advised
that they have only seven days from
luly 1 to clear away sheds and
machinery.
Salisbury North is being transform-
ed by intensive Housing Trust de-
velopment. In one project alone, due
for completion within the next few
months 500 homes have already been
occupied. In addition, the District
Council has approved plans for a
£44,000 shopping to include
11 shops in Bagsters Road and Trinity
Crescent.
Another big Trust job at Salisbury
is the new £30,000 community centre.
Work is expected to start about mid-
luly and the first building, a kinder-
garten hall, should be completed
within twelve months. The centre,
which will be financed by the Salis-
bury North Progress Association, will
include the kindergarten hall, also
suitable as a small theatre seating 450,
a main community hall, 60ft. by 24ft.,
a residents’ club, a swimming pool
and dressing sheds, a library, and a
storeroom.
An 86-year-old building in Grenfell
Street has been demolished to make
way for a six-storey block of offices.
The contract for the new building, to
be known as Murray House has been
let to A. W. Baulderstone Ltd., and
construction will begin immediately.
The structure will be built for Murray
River Wholesale Co-operative Ltd.,
and is sited near Gawler Place. About
twenty office suites will be available
for letting. Except for a small sur-
round of terracotta tiles the whole
front of Murray House will be of glass.
This is to give maximum light. Mur-
ray House will be Adelaide’s first
steel-framed office building since the
war. It will be ready for occupation
in about fifteen months. Architect
for the project is E. A. Keal.
A big construction programme
which will radically change Adelaide's
skyline is getting under way. Demo-
lition of Morialta Chambers and the
adjoining century-old Windsor Castle
Hotel at the corner of Victoria Square
and t Franklin Street, will begin in
August. In December, the Mutual
Life and Citizens’ Assurance Co. Ltd.
will start erecting an eleven-storey
building on the site. Tenants have
vacated Morialta Chambers and ten-
ders for the work will be called short-
ly. The architects are Bates, Smart
and McCutcheon, of Melbourne. The
associate architects, Lawson, Cheesman
and Doley, of Adelaide, expect con-
struction to take about twelve months.
The new building will have a frontage
of 115 ft. to Victoria Square and 52ft.
to Franklin Street and rise to the
maximum height of 132 ft. It will be
erected in an encased, rigid steel
frame. External walls will be largely
of glass, with a new opaque sheeting
material to window level, eliminating
masonry walls.
Special pink bricks and glazed terra'
cotta panels will provide the face of
Adelaide’s biggest building—a twelve'
storey structure to be completed with'
in two years on the north-eastern
corner of Gawler Place and Grenfell
Street. It will be erected for St.
Peter’s College at an estimated cost of
from £BOO,OOO to £900,000.
Demolitions will allow construction
of a 20ft. wide street along the new
building’s full depth. This could
become a new through road between
Rundle and Grenfell Streets. The
main entrance to the new building will
be from the 100 ft. Grenfell Street
frontage. It will lead into a spacious
vestibule, joining the arcade at right-
angles. The completely air-conditioned
structure will be equipped with four
high-speed lifts. Tenders for the job
are expected to be called in Novem-
ber or December. The architects are

Work on the Loxton Club Hotel’s
new bar building is almost completed.
It will include the biggest island bar
—200 ft. long in South Australia,
and one of the biggest single bars in
Australia. Work has been in pro'
gress since July last year and costs are
estimated at £BO,OOO. Philip R.
Claridge 6? Gunn, of Adelaide, are
the architects, and the contractor is
Nuriootpa builder C. O. funcken.
The bar is the first stage in construe'
tion of new hotel facilities in the
town. Later, a saloon bar and three'
storey residential hotel will be built
on the site. The front of the new
building is completely enclosed with
heat-resistant glass. Rows of windows
which open at the push of a button
ensure an ample flow of ventilation.
The walls and bar facing have been
lined with tiles, and seats, each with
an arm rest, have been set into the
walls. Spaced round the bar at regu-
lar intervals, are hot water radiators
for the comfort of bar drinkers. A
specially-designed acoustic ceiling sus-
pended from the roof and provided
with an exhaust vent to clear the room
of smoke has also been installed.
Another big hotel project the
twelve-bedroom, two-storey Flinders
Hotel in Grand function Road, Rose-
water is also well past the blueprint
stage. Tenders for the job are being
. considered and work is expected to
start in August. The hotel will have
eleven bedrooms, six with shower
rooms. It will be only the second
second hotel to be erected in the
suburbs since 1900. A feature of the
design is the placing of the private
entrance, set back 90ft. from the foot'
path. Entry is through a lawn and
beer garden. The public and saloon
bars and the bottle department con'
nect directly with a central keg store
and storage space at ground level. •
The dining room, public lounge and
bars all face on to the beer garden.
The building, with a 120 ft. frontage
screens the beer garden from the hot
afternoon sun in summer and allows
the sun access in winter. Architects
are Evans 6? Bruer. Philpot 6? Part'
ners. Construction is expected to take
twelve months.
A big contract is expected to come
up shortly for modernisation of the
Tivoli Theatre, Grote Street. City.
The Tivoli has been sold, but the
purchaser remains “under cover.”
However, Mr. Claude Whitford,
managing director of Allans Ltd., who
represents the buyer, says the Tivoli
will continue to be used for theatrical
purposes. Extensive structural altera'
tions are planned, though the starting
date has not yet been fixed. Moder-
nisation is an obvious necessity at the
Tivoli, but the old-fashioned design
will present knotty construction prob-
lems.
Sand distributors this month con-
firmed a report by the Mines Minister
(Mr. Mcfwin) that sand suitable for
building and concrete work was rapid-
ly being depleted. They said a search
for new deposits should begin im-
mediately. One distributor said a
principal source of sand at Noarlunga
would last for twenty years, but it
was a coarse type, unsuitable for some
building purposes. The Christies
Beach deposit would last only a few
years at the present rate of consump-
tion. Large deposits north of the
city have been built over, and a big
area of red sand was covered by West
Beach Aerodrome.
Hansen 6? Yuncken Pty. Ltd. have
the contract for building a new wing
on to Pulteney Grammar School.
Main feature of the new work is a
Memorial Chapel at first floor level
which will seat 575. The wing will
also include six classrooms, a senior
master’s study, a masters’ common
room, a general purpose room and a
new lavatory block. Lucas 6? Parker
are the architects.

CLAYTON EQUIPMENT IS WORLD TESTED
New U. 5. design saves time—money
Superseded are all old-fashioned ideas of hot water storage. Now the Clayton Water Heater
can supply 500 gallons of water per hour at any desired temperature— instantaneously.
INSTANTANEOUS!
500 gallons per hour or more (depending on temperature
rise) are delivered instantly the tap is turned on.
Imagine time savings possible! And what’s
more, supply is continuous.
ECONOMICAL!
Clayton’s proved system of forced re-circulation
guarantees thermal efficiency of 75%, means savings
of fuel consumed. Costs only 1/2 for 100 gals.
Direct connection to underground storage oil
tank, if desired, eliminates coke bunkers, etc.
Thermostat control ensures no wasted
running time.
EFFICIENT!
COMPLETE!
Maintenance costs are slashed, no labour is
required to fire and dispose of ashes from unit,
and “on-off” system ensures that fuel is
only burnt when hot water is being used.
Longer life is possible, less servicing
required. U.S. designed and tested,
Clayton Water Heater has been proved
to be the cheapest, most efficient
method of heating water in the world.
Unit is complete, no extras are required. Installation
is so easy that it’s only a matter of minutes before unit is ready to start
pouring forth gallons and gallons of cheap, steaming hot water.
The Clayton Water Heater has proved applications in Laundries,
Restaurants, Hotels, Hospitals, Offices, Factories, Canteens and
many others. Why not get all the facts about this mighty unit?

unit of the Mount Gambier Old Folks’
Home has been accepted. The sue*
cessful contractors were Mount Gam'
bier builders Friedrichs 6? Suiting with
a price of <£14,82-4 —the lowest of four
tenders. Money for the project will
be raised by public subscription. The
board of management has about <£4ooo
in hand, plus the freehold of a ten-
acre site at the corner of Pick Avenue
and Lake Terrace.
Two of the most artistic post-war
fobs done by Adelaide architects were
in the news recently. Nearly 3000
people saw the Prime Minister (Mr.
Menzies) lay the foundation stone of
the John Flynn Memorial Church at
Alice Springs on June 26. The build'
ing, designed by Mr. A. A. Philpot,
of Evans 6? Bruer, Philpot & Part'
ners, is in sharp contrast to more
conventional churches of the past.
The usual tower has been eliminated
to save unnecessary cost. Ornament
has been kept to a minimum and the
structure relies for its beauty on colour
and texture of juxtaposed marble, red
sandstone, concrete, water and trees,
and general sculptural effect. Northern
Territory builder Jim Richards has the
contract.
The other job is Assissi Hall in
Newton Road, Paradise Adelaide’s
first Capuchin Mission. The Arch'
bishop of Adelaide (Most Rev. Dr.
M. Beovich) unveiled a striking mural
there on Tune 26, watched by 200
people. The Mission cost about
£12,000 to build and will be officially
opened on October 4. feast day of St.
Francis of Assissi. The architect, Mr.
E. A. Keal, says it exemplifies the
more modern conception of a mission
hall.
Unusual features include:—
• A life-size statue in front of the
hall, showing Christ leaning
down from the Cross and placing
an arm round St. Francis.
• A 40ft. belltower containing a
bell brought from Italy.
• A cross on the front of the
building which will be Neon-lit
and visible for miles.
A large amount of glass was used
in the construction, the side walls
being mainly of that material.
The new £1,000,000 sulphuric acid
plant at Port Adelaide received a
serious setback when 55 employees
went on strike during June. Mr. J.
C. Cody, resident engineer for the
principal contractors, Simon - Carves
Australia Pty. Ltd., said they had been
working to a “tight” schedule to com-
plete the construction by the present
target date of May, 1955. The stop-
page had seriously retarded progress
and any further hold-ups could mean
that the plant would not be ready in
time to receive pyrites from the pro-
ject at Nairne.
South Australian cement has been
cut in price by 5/- a ton. The new
price to consumers will be £lO a ton.
The Government announced the price
reduction after negotiation and agree*
ment with the two manufacturing com*
panics. Adelaide Cement Co. Ltd. and
S.A. Portland Cement Co. Ltd. The
cut will save S.A. consumers about
£60,000 a year.
S.A. members of the Australian
Building Industry Productivity team
have returned to Adelaide full of new
ideas. Mr. Henry Wilckens, manag-
ing director of Wilckens 6? Burnside
Ltd., is particularly sold on the pos-
sibilities of verniculite, a lightweight
concrete aggregate recently developed
in the U.S. The material is based on
mica, which is plentiful in S.A. Mr.
Wilckens says it could make big cuts
in building costs and urges an im-
mediate investigation into the pos-
sibility of using the new aggregate
here. Mr. H. T. Griggs, an architect
member of the team, says coloured
concrete for exterior walls is an over*
seas building trend which could be
followed in Australia.

roomed house, have been announced
by the Housing Trust. Six new
types of dwelling are already being
built for the Trust, including two de'
signs for two-storey homes. The
latest types will be of brick or stone,
with tiled roofs. The designs are
aimed at eliminating waste space.
Though the area enclosed by the outei
walls has been kept to an economical
scale, the room spaces are as large as
those found in many houses of a big'
ger over'all size.
Work on a £20,000 Army training
depot will start soon at Port Lincoln,
Tenders are being considered by the
Commonwealth Department of Works.
In its initial stage, the depot will have
a brick drill hall, ablutions block and
store. Later, office accommodation
will be added.
Among minor contracts let this
month was one for erection of the
new Branson Methodist Church at
Greenock. Cost will be about £2809.
Most of the labour on foundations
and the carting of about 80 tons of
gravel will be voluntary. Burley 6?
Moder, of Nuriootpa, are the con'
tractors.
BOOK REVIEW.
“Concrete Farm Structures,” by A.
M. Pennington. (London; Con'
crete Publications Ltd. 151
pages. Price, 11/'.)
This volume is one of “The Con'
crete Series,” which are books on rein'
forced concrete design and construe'
ion, precast concrete, cement manu'
facture and testing, etc.
“Concrete Farm Structures” gives
plans, sections, working drawings, and
all the information required for the
erection in concrete of cowhouses,
dairies, stables, piggeries, liquid'manure
tanks, barns, implement sheds, grass
and grain silos, grain'drying plant,
roads, yards, culverts, gates, cattle'
grids, water'troughs, etc.
The last chapter deals with the
planning of farms, and the author
gives full information on the manu'
facture of precast concrete units used
in the construction.
For many years he has specialised in
this class of work, and most of the
structures described in the book have
been designed by him and erected urn
der his skilled supervision.
The designs are in accordance with
the latest U.K. and U.S. practice, and
have been approved by the British
Ministry of Agriculture.
This handy volume could provide
a valuable textbook for Australian
builders who reside in rural areas and
country centres, and who are largely
engaged in all types of farm construe'
tions.
QUEENSLAND LETTER
HOMES DOMINATE NEW BUILDING.
The number of building permits
issued b the Brisbane City Council
m June, 1954, viz., 757, is well
above the average, despite the trade
doldrums that often come about in
the fading months of the financial
year.
While the building of dwellings
dominates all structural activities,
other necessary buildings have not
been neglected. Seven new blocks of
flats will cost from £3,000 to £lO,OOO
each; and included in a list of 36 new
structures, the outstanding ones are
£55,000 for remodelling an insurance
office, and £250,000 for completely
building another insurance block,
estimated to cost considerably more
when finished.
Nine new shops range in cost from
£3,000 to £22,500. Six factories will
cost from £3,000 to £25,000; three
warehouses, respectively, £5,000,
£6,000, and £7,000. A new Church
School will account for £30,000, and
new office buildings, in addition to ah
terations to others, cost £3,000 to
£lO,OOO, A Spastic building costing
£1,500 will be the administrative sec'
tion. Two new surgeries will cost
£3,000 and £4,000, respectively; a
boiler house, £7,000; a bakehouse is
to be remodelled at a cost of £10,000;
and two substations will cost, respec'
lively, £3,000 and £5,800.
Town Plan Ratification.
Now that Brisbane is “growing up”
with rapidity, the Government, in its
wisdom, appointed the Director of
Local Government (Mr. I. A. Sewell)
to confer with appointees of the Bris'
bane City Council on the town plan
submitted to the State Government
for its ratification. The historical in'
struction of Governor Gipps, when
Brisbane was in New South Wales,
to cut down the proposed widths of
some Brisbane'town streets by half,
did not visualise to'day’s need for
wider streets points to the need to
look ahead, and act, to allow for
eventualities. Drastic changes in the
existing Municipal set'up are expected
to appear in the report of the investb
gators, about the middle of August.
The key note would appear to be
that the vast increase in the number
of motor cars and trucks calls for
much more decentralisation in the
suburbs than has grown up of its own
accord. The city of Brisbane proper
is so centralised that such development
as should take place must be up'
wards, instead of outwards. The high
land'valuation is no greater on an
building than it is on a
two'storied place of the same ground
area, of which there are a great nunv
ber. Nevertheless, one can see at
any time expensive remodelling of
two'storied city shops in the very
heart of the city without addition to
the height being made. The Hiber'
nian Buildings propose to add another
two storeys to the present four, at a
cost of £50,000 to £60,000 provided
the foundations are found to be suit'
able. New banks and insurance offices
do not appear to be compelled to fob
low this practice; but in competitive
business the great disparity in the
rents of old buildings, compared with
those of the new, based upon present'
day building costs, creates a problem.
Population in most suburbs is now be'
coming so dense as to justify shop'
ping facilities no less attractive than
those of the inner city.
Increase in Hardwood Costs.
While we are being told, authorita'
lively, that building costs would come
down appreciably, if the uncertainty
of obtaining building material supplies
were to abate, there is the announce'
ment of an increase from early July
of 5/' per 100 super feet in the price
of hardwood, bringing the retail
price of sawn hardwood to £5/3/6 per
100 super feet. This increase would
add at least £25 to the cost of an
average sized timber home.
Financial Institutions
Predominate.
When the owner of a large retail
store in Edward Street complained re'
cently in the Press, of the demolition
of the right hand, of shops to allow
for the construction of a large insur'
ance building, and, on the left, of the
occupation by the Commonwealth
Bank of an established shopping area,
it was because, with the exception of
a cafe, there would be no other shops
from street to street. This public
statement was sufficient to cause the
“Courier'Mail” to have a survey
made, with the result it was found
that banks and insurance companies
take up 28% of the building space
of the main street —Queen Street—
on both sides. At the corner of
Queen and Creek Streets, the four
corners are dominated by four banks.
The Brisbane City Council is to
rigidly overhaul the building regula'
tions related to tenements and flats.
Of the two social “evils,” the latter
is regarded as the lesser, though the
present regulations encourage the
former. Municipal priorities are in
the order of: Individual homes, then
maisonettes, flats, and tenements,
under stricter regulations than hereto'
fore.

chaotic that various plans have been
envisaged to ameliorate the position,
if possible. These proposals embody
the building of parking stations at
prices ranging up to £lOO,OOO on one
to contain 300 cars. Another is seek-
ing approval for a two-storied
escalator-type building, to accommo'
date 200 cars. Meantime, the police
are more vigilant than ever, and cor'
respondents write to the papers, ask'
ing why their home'garaged cars
should pay the same registration fees
as those charged on cars being used
day and night.
The City Council is committed to
spend some millions on its works pro'
gramme this year. After waiting
nearly six years since an order was
placed for five electric pumps, essen'
tial to the sewerage system, delivery
has been taken from a Victorian
establishment. Each pump can dis'
pose of 15 million gallons per day.
The under-river syphon contract at
Hamilton, being carried out by M. R.
Hornibrook Pty. Ltd. is nearing com'
pletion, and big strides are being
made in order to remove the stigma
of incompleteness in sewerage dis'
posal in Brisbane, which began so
belatedly.
New Swimming Pools.
More than one swimming pool of
Olympic pattern are planned, so that
North and South Brisbane will each
have one. These are to cost not less
than £15,000 each.
In addition to the expenditure of
£6,000 on a swimming pool at St.
Hilda’s School for girls, at South-
port, it is intended to build a pool
costing £lO,OOO at the Southport C.
of E. School for boys. Projected im-
provements to the school buildings are
estimated to cost another £40,000.
At Hamilton, new wharfage that
cost £5OO 000 is nearing completion.
Further wharfage construction con-
tinues at this deep-water port, where
the largest steamers of the overseas
lins can berth safely.
The Royal National Association
will, on the opening of this year’s
big “Show” for nine days and nights,
on August sth be able to make use
of improvements that cost £50,000
since the last exhibition. Sixty work-
men are employed in preparations;
but during the show 500 will be on
the pay roll.
The town of Pittsworth, on the
Darling Downs, has a building pro-
gramme of £150,000 to make it one
of the most attractive towns on the
Downs. Included in this sum is
£30,000 snent on a modern picture
theatre. The civic centre, just begun
by the Shire Council, will take
£35,000; and £6,000 is to be spent on
a War Memorial Hall. A first-class
hotel is to rise where a fire devastated
a former hotel. At a later date, a
modern brick Ambulance centre is to
be built at a cost of £lO,OOO to
£12,000.
Almost throughout Queensland,
there is activity in building pro'
grammes . At Mt. Isa lead and cop'
per field in the “wilds’ ’of N.W.
Queensland, the population numbers
8,000, of whom 3,000 are employed
by the mining company that dispenses
largesse in the way of fine building
amenitities, in addition to a high
wage and bonus.
South Coast Building Continues.
In the “Town of South Coast,”
which embraces Southport, Surfers’
Paradise, and several coastal towns to
the N.S.W. border, the building
boom is unabated, except for the de'
laving effect of a very wet and stormy
winter. Much of the land about here
is Government perpetual leasehold,
on which 3% is paid annually on the
land values. Recent reassessments
have increased the valuations ten
times. The original idea of these
leaseholds was to provide for the
working man to have a seaside home
to which he could retire. The stipu'
lation that £25 had to be spent in
improvements is now £4OO, but still
farcical. More than one home in this
area b*s cost £30,000, and many more
down the scale to £5,000.
In Brisbane’s nearby city of
Ipswich (population 40,000), there is
considerable expansion in building,
and at one of the numerous coal'
mines there—Wcstfallen Colliery, at
nearby Dinmore —£20,000 is being
spent on a 1500 tons storage bin,
built in a former sandstone quarry,
where, in the “bad old days,’’ convicts
quarried sandstone for delivery in
punts down the river to Brisbane’s
early building opera'ions. Now the
coal output comes to Brisbane’s power
houses by barges or railway trucks.
F. O. NIXON.
HOW ORIGINAL CAN WE BECOME?
DESIGN FOR A CHAPEL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA
TOP.—A light framework in alumininum, completely glazed with pink glass, rests
on triangular concrete pillars. The compete building is composed of two parts: the
chapel itself with 300 seats, joined to an administrative building, containing meeting
halls, offices and a library. A bell tower contains the carillon.
BOTTOM.—The texture introduced into the roof of this buiding would seem to
emulate the honeycomb of bees or the lozenge, though in fact they are squares,
each square having its own slightly raised apex. One can do these things in

News Items from “The Middle East”
By ARTHUR R. COLE,
Double-decker Bridge.
A £500,000 double-decker bridge is
to be built over the river at Klang.
Malaya. It will replace the Bailey
bridge put up by army engineers in
1952. The previous bridge had been
blown up in the retreat to Singapore
during the lapanese invasion. The
new, two-level steel structure will be
600 ft. long. The upper portion will
carry buses, trucks and cars; the lower
section will be for bicycles, rickshaws
and pedestrians. This arrangement
will speed up the journey for the hun-
dreds of vehicles which cross the river
daily to and from Port Swettenham
docks.
Builders’ Library.
Singapore Public Works Depart-
ment is setting up a library to help
builders. It will contain records of
borings, test piles and other founda-
tion details as well as the geology of
the strata underlying the city area.
Fishery Research Project.
Plans for a £20,000 fisheries re-
search laboratory at Changi Point,
Singapore, have been approved. The
laboratory, in conjunction with a
£60,000 research vessel being built in
England, will become a research centre
for the whole of South-east Asia.
New Wharf for Borneo.
Ewart & Co. (Civil Engineers) Ltd.
Singapore, are building a £lOO,OOO
concrete-and-wood wharf at Sandakan.
North Borneo. It will be 600 ft. long
and will have a concrete top. Wharves
in Borneo are usually built of wood.
Bridge of New Type.
Excavation work is taking place on
a concrete bridge of a type new to
Singapore. This new Kib Seng bridge,
to cost £35,000. will be of “prestress-
ed” concrete. It will be 85ft. long
and 66ft. wide, capable of providing
a dual carriageway for traffic. The
canal running under the existing
bridge will be diverted to run under
the new one.
New Airport Runway in Sea.
The project report on Hong Kong’s
forthcoming £5,000,000 new airport
at Kai Tak says that the proposed
7200 ft. runway reaching out into the
sea could, if required, be extended
beyond Channel Rock, but only at
the expense of restrictions on ship-
ping in Lyemun Gap. No parallel
runway could be built to increase the
capacity of the airport. The runway
will be 200 ft. wide, built on a pro-
montory 700 ft. wide. Later on. the
promontory can be extended, if re-
quired, to provide a runway 9000 ft.
long.
Rescue Rockets for Police,
Rocket - firing apparatus for sea
rescue work is now available for im-
mediate use at four Singapore marine
police posts. The equipment consists
mainly of a Shermuly pistol, from
which the rocket is fired at hip level,
throwing a life-line out to a person
in distress. Equipped with buoyant
rockets and floating lines, the device
can also make rapid line contact from
ship to ship or from ship to shore.
To Build Thousands
of Houses.
Singapore Building and Realty Ltd.,
a new £500,000 Chinese company, is
planning to build immediately in the
colony thousands of houses and sell
them at prices suitable to the middle
income group. It may also deal in
factories, light railways, tramways and
warehouses, as well as acting as miners
and general merchants.
Largest Ship Built There.
The cargo vessel “Trang,” the
largest to be built at the Straits Steam-
ship Company’s Sungei Nvok dock-
yard at Butterworth. Penang, is now
in service. She cost about £lOO 000.
is of 360 tons and her 500 h.p. diesel
engine carries her along at a fully-
loaded speed of 10 knots.
£1.500,000 Water Supply
Scheme.
Half-a-million tons of earth will be
removed from a hilltop for the con-
struction of a new water treatment
plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. The
largest machine at work carries 20
tons of earth at a time. About
70,000 tons are being taken out each
month from a hill to a swamp. The
new filtration plant and reservoirs to
be built are part of the £1,500,000
Klang Gates water supply scheme to
serve Kuala Lumpur. A dam 100 ft.
high is to be built at Klang Gates,
seven miles from town, on the river.
Water will be fed from the dam to
the treatment plant through seven
miles of 45in. mains. Water supply
will be increased from 11,000,000 to
20,000,000 gallons a day for Kuala
Lumpur. Provision has been made
for future extensions to increase the
capacity to 32,000,000 gallons a day.
The “Glass Island.”
Japanese glass factories are anxious
to buy large quantities of silica sand
from Pulau Tekong Kechil, the “glass
island” of about 220 acres off Changi
Point. Singapore. But high freight
charges have held orders up. Tekong
sand contains nearly 100 per cent,
silica, from which lenses, cut glass
and other fine glassware is made. This
sand is not found anywhere else in
South-east Asia.
Big Housing Programme.
A <£2,000 000 building programme
is to be completed by Johore Public
Works Department this year. A
greater part of the money will be
spent to provide quarters for govern-
ment employees.
Huge Transformers Supplied.
Erected and commissioned within a
week of their arrival, two new English
Electric 12,500 kVA distribution
transformers are now in service at the
Hok Un generation station of the
China Light and Power Co. Ltd., step-
ping up the generated voltage from

MODERN PRINTING PLANT.
The Marskfield News-Herald (Wis., U.S.A.) new building in which are a number
of modern Linotype machines. The building is simple with panelled walls of fixed
glass to the facade filled with three windows for ventilation on each side of the
entrance door. For a number of years the paper occupied rented buildings.
Removal to its own premises was a major ambition of the proprietor now
accomplished. This major ambition is a thing to which most of us in the printing
field aspire to, but few of us attain.

6600 to 33,000 volts for distribution
in Hong Kong’s Kowloon and New
Territories. Each transformer unit
has an installed weight of nearly 50
tons. Eventually, even larger units
are planned for. the generating station;
these will range from 25,000 kVA up'
wards.
Siamese Electrical Drive.
A contract of more than £1,000,000
has been awarded to the Brush group
of engineering companies for the sup'
ply of a wide range of diesel general'
ing sets for the electrification of
Siam’s rural areas. A total of 239
diesebelectric generating sets is in'
volved. The sets will be installed in
existing power stations and in new
ones to be built by the Siamese
Government.
Ferry To Be Improved.
A £1,000,000 scheme for the re'
modelling of the Penang, Malaya,
ferry services is now being con'
sidered. A fleet of end'loading ferries
is proposed, together with three new
terminals with end'loading berths.. It
is thought that the new services would
be flexible enough to allow additional
vessels if there is a demand for them
later. Double'ended ferry boats fitted
with a propeller at each end are
recommended by the consultants. The
new terminal and vessels would be de'
signed to carry vehicles with a load'
ing of 10 tons on two axles and 12
tons on three.
More Factories for Singapore.
Eighteen lots for new factories are
to be made available on the Colonial
Development Corporation’s industrial
estate. Bukit Timah Road, Singapore.
This is the second stage of the Cor'
poration’s development plan for em
couraging the setting up of small fac-
tories in the colony to make light in'
dustrial products.
£2,000,000 City Hall.
Hong Kong’s new city hall is ex'
pected to cost £2,000,000 instead of
the £1,500,000 originally estimated.
The latest plans provide for a twelve'
storey building similar to the United
Nations building in New York.
Airport Target Date.
Mr. I. T. Bryan, superintending em
gineer of the new Singapore airport
being built at Paya Lebar, said that
it is scheduled to begin operation on
Tune 1 next, although it might even
be possible to advance this date if all
goes well. The difficult earth work
on this £4,000,000 project is ahead of
schedule; 2,750.000 cubic yards of
earth have already been moved, leav'
ing another 1,000,000 cubic yards to
be shifted.
New Telephone Exchange.
A new automatic telephone ex'
change has been opened in Ipoh,
Malaya. The building and equipment
is costing £150.000. Main feature
of the structure is the extensive use
of glass bricks and louvres to give
maximum glaredree light and to keep
out dust and noise. The building,
the most elaborate and attractive
government offices to be built in
Perak State, was designed by Mr. B.
M. Iversen, winner of a £5OO contest
for designing a house in Kuala
Lumpur.
Tractors Versus Oxen.
On the lines of a scheme in Borneo,
Malaya is trying out tractors for rice
cultivation to see whether they will
produce better results than oxen. The
Colonial Development and Welfare
Fund will probably approve £3OOO for
initial expenditure on the programme.
Search For Oil.
The British Malayan Petroleum
Company has started drilling at Serai,
Borneo, to go down 10,000 feet, a
greater depth than ever before in the
oilfield. The area of operation is along
the coast. Work will also start later
this year on drilling into the bed of
the South China Sea, at two points a
mile off the coast. The drilling rigs
will be erected on two steel “islands”
recently built on the sea bed. The
“islands” are to be connected to the
shore by aerial ropeway for the trans'
port of men and material. A small
show of oil was found in a well drilled
last year from a similar artificial island.
Offices and Soundproof Studios.
seven ' storey, £300.000 office
block for government departments has
been opened in Kuala Lumpur, capital
of the Federation of Malaya. Some
departments have moved in, and others
will follow at short intervals; the
building is expected to be almost fully
occupied by September. Soundproof
studios, on the block’s top floor, have
still to be fitted up for the broadcast'
ing department. The block is the
first permanent office project carried
out by the government in Kuala Lurm
pur for more than twenty years.
£4OOO Toddy “Pub.”
It was T'Day in Ipoh, Malaya, re'
cently, when a government' built
£4OOO luxury tavern was opened for
toddy drinkers. The sale of the day’s
supply of 200 gallons began with a
senior customs officer taking a sip,
before a cheering crowd. To ensure
good luck, incense was burnt and
offerings of betel leaf coconut and
candy were made. But there were no
drinks on the house.
FOOTNOTE: Toddy is a fermented, in'
toxicating drink from coconut tiees.
HOTEL DE SERRES CHEVALIER
This large modern hotel above the snow-line at Chantemerle provides modern
accommodation for tourists to the snow sports. It has stone construction with cement
facings on the lower floors, timber construction on the upper, with wide roof
overhang to protect against falling snow from the roof. Accommodation guest rooms
are given precedence on the Southern (sunny) side shown in the picture.

THE PEOPLE PROGRESS:
THE GOVERNMENT STAGNATES.
By FLORENCE M. TAYLOR.
“Too much mankind, too little
earth,” said Walt Whitman.
This applies to all countries except'
ing Australia, and we have too much
earth for the people it is to provide
for.
The surplus forms a nucleus for
trade, which is good to have, seeing
that we want so many things from
other countries, and this surplus em
ables us to reciprocate.
Mankind is increasing at the rate
of 9,000,000 a year at the present
time (as many people as we have in
Australia after 166 years of occupa-
tion. ownership and development),
but the earth never expands one inch
to cater for this everdncreasing growth
of humans.
Populace Increasing.
Peonle have been on the earth since
1,000,000 years 8.C., and remained
more or less stagnant, excepting foi
a small increase averaging about 900
a year. Then, from the year 1800,
when medical science and engineering
skill developed so rapidly, acceleration
started with vigour and by the middle
of the 20th century it had reached
2,400,000,000, and is still increasing,
mostly among people of nomEuropean
origin, whilst no comparable provision
is being made amongst them for their
number in terms of food and living
space, the two demands that all new*
comers make upon the earth.
According to Dr. W. G. Sinclair
Snow, the latest figures show an excess
of 63,000 births over deaths daily,
which works out at 22,995,000 increase
a year.

"Can concreting be carried out by inexperienced and
untrained personnel?"
“Yes! Every day concrete is mixed and placed by people who know only that sand and stone must
be mixed with cement and water to a workable consistency and placed in forms to harden.”
“But is this ALL that is necessary to make good concrete?”
“We did not say that these people always make GOOD concrete. More often than not they waste
cement and don’t get the best obtainable results. There is a lot more to this concreting business
than at first meets the eye.”
★
On large construction jobs the concrete mix must be designed with a view to
obtaining the best possible concrete at minimum cost after taking into account the
qualities required in the concrete, and the aggregates, mixing and placing equipment
available.
When the proportions of this mix have been determined (preferably by an
experienced engineer) it is the job of the construction team to use these figures to
produce the designed concrete in the structure.
“There’s many a slip ’twixt the designer’s figures and good quality hardened
concrete.”
We must now say that experienced and welhtrained personnel MUST be used
to do a good concreting job. Money spent on the training of these men will be
recouped many times over by savings in time and cement and better quality in the
finished structure.
Occasionally, we find that even the supervising engineer needs to be instructed
in, or reminded of, the necessary procedure for mixing and placing good quality concrete.
The Cement 6? Concrete Association of Australia wishes to assist in the training
of these people and offers the facilities of its library and the service of its engineers
for this purpose.

have been able to do, increasing pro'
ductivity, but not enough to provide
for an increase of 9,000,000 every
year, but we haven’t that self'imposed
duty all to ourselves —America in re'
cent years has become a mighty nation,
helping everybody.
World’s Population.
World food supply must be con'
tinuously replaced and increased to
meet essential demands, and all fac'
tories, works and service buildings for
people’s needs must also receive im'
mediate attention.
Half the world’s population is con'
centrated in Asia, with about —
460.000. in China,
400.000. in India,
580.000. in Europe,
210.000. in North America,
105.000. in South America
194.000. in Africa,
12.000. in Oceania, and
9.000. in Australia.
India’s populations increased by
50,000,000 between 1930 and 1940.
Delhi, on 574 square miles, has a
population of 4038 to the square mile.
Java and Madura, on 51,000 square
miles have 52,000,000 people, or 1000
to the square mile. Central lava’s
concentration of population comes to
1900 to the square mile; Australia,
her southern neighbour, has only 3
people to the square mile on an area
of 3,262,696 square miles.
Higher Living Costs.
We spend £250,000,000 a year on
gambling, £177,000,000 a year on en-
tertainments, £169,000,000 a year on
drink (outside the hotels before 6 p.m.
if they cannot get into them), and
£42,000,000 a year on smokes.
We have spent much on homes for
newcomers and o 1 d inhabitants
(£190,055,000 on houses; £6,636,000
on flats; £2,349,000 on shops with
dwellings, and £1,213,000 on hotels,
guest houses and boarding houses),
but because the housing industry has
been wrenched from private enterprise
(by Government decree viz., “the
Fair Rents Court) which, before the
war, provided plenty of cheap homes
for everyone and some to spare, there
has been a shortage, and thousands of
people are without homes nor have
they a prospect of getting a home.
Plenty of Money.
The banks are bursting their
vaults with the people’s savings.
£1,000,000,000 are in the savings
banks and almost that amount in the
trading banks, whilst insurance com-
panies combined could multiply that
ten times. One insurance company
alone, with 2,600,000 policies in force,
has £965,000,000 assured and bonus
amounts on its books, and yet with all
this wealth available the people can'
not build homes, though they bank
every penny, mostly for that express
purpose. They are all too pricey.
A New Australian lives in a garage,
30ft. x 12ft., and it has two rooms.
He and his wife are happy there, but
along comes a Suburban Council rep'
resentative and says “Outski” to them.
He says “You can’t live in a garage;
you’ve got to live in a home.” This
is the kind of “heel” that one might
expect to find in Russia. The Govern'
ment staff here has our people under
the heel so thoroughly that this story
doesn’t sound true, but it is. It reads
more like the brutality recorded in
the papers of tO'day of the Germans
in the concentration camps. It is
just as cruel. The only difference is
that the Germans are receiving the
death sentence after many years have
elapsed for their cruelty. Our cruelty
is instituted, fostered and condoned
by Government decree and is not re'
garded as a crime.
Communism Is Inhuman.
It might recall what Sir Winston
Churchill says:
“Communism is the most inhuman
slavery in the world.”
These young new Australians were
hurting nobody by living in a garage
any more than those living in tents or

caravans are doing, which living is
sanctioned by Government or Local
Government Authorities for a small
fee, of course. These young people
are buying the land for a home in the
future, but, they explain, beside paying
for the land, they have to save .£5OO
before the Bank will lend them enough
money with which to build. The
Government, iust to be perverse, per'
mits people to live in caravans, manu'
facturers of which are allowed to make
8% profit on their outlay, but any
landlord willing to put up a properly
built home is not allowed to earn more
than or 5 %' from his tenant.
What meddlesomeness with progress
our laws entail!
Landlords should be subsidised, not
fair-rented.
How can we hope to get on if we
allow these power'drunk young men
of the white collar type to go round
virtually kicking everyone not suitably
housed out of the only shelter they
can get unless it conforms to standards
that cannot be met? There are 50,000
people waiting for homes in Australia.
There are 50,000 people waiting for
a telephone. They are all pretty
tolerant.
The Government will subsidise
butter production, if the fixed or com'
petitive prices render it unprofitable
to the dairy farmer, and they will see
to it that all the children receive a
bottle of free milk daily, for which we
must say, God Bless them for that, but
why persecute the home'owning in'
dustry so that the professional land'
lord, who did a notable job in pro'
viding homes in the past, now finds it
unprofitable to own homes, with ren'
tals fixed by the fair rents court. They
need a subsidy, not fair rents restrk'
tions. One man with a big terrace of
homes had his prices so fixed that he
could not make repairs with the amount
afforded. He tried to give the whole
terrace to the tenants, but with two
or three exceptions, they turned it
down. The landlord could make re*
pairs at tO'day’s prices but not make
a higher rental charge for his outlay.
We were delighted to read that
9000 people will shortly be released
from Government service owing to
the ending of food controls. This
will make 9000 people available for
work in other directions, in legitimate
work to benefit the country’s progress.
Instead of living upon the backs of
private enterprise, they will be con'
tributing to it. Were it not for private
enterprise doing practically everything
(from which the Government purloins
all its wealth), the country could not
exist. We want less controls and more
freedom to forge ahead in the way
we want to forge ahead.
Pigeonholes.
Our Government sends people over'
seas to study developments that are
taking place, when we have educated
men, specialists who could tell them
all they want to know, but of course
they have got to use up public money,
and so these argosies, after travelling,
make their reports to place before the
Government, and the Government
pigeonholes them —which is a typical
Government action throughout this
country at all times. They come back
and tell us that over the big bridges in
New York, say, the George Washing'
ton, one must go faster than 45 .miles
per hour or one is fined for loitering.
In one of the central streets of Los
Angeles one can travel at 50 m.p.h.
We are called upon to slow down
in all things.
We could build plenty of roads and
plenty of bridges which we so badly
need. We have plenty of qualified
engineers.
Provision For Traffic Is Never
Considered.
No streets have been widened in
the City of Sydney or new ones
created for 50 years, if we except the
William Street widening, the Lower
Goulburn Street widening and the
creation of Wentworth Avenue and
the Burma Road, whose few chains
took us longer to build than the
original Burma Road, of which it was
said it was built with the flesh and
blood of humans —our men who were
buried in it as it was being built.
Sydney for 50 years has been
saddled with Aldermen without drive,
without knowledge of town planning,
or engineering, and without any re'
spending chord to the heartbeats of
Sydney, as it calls aloud for street
widening, or undergrounding, or over'
heading facilities. It iust groans and
groans, but no alderman or politician
considers it worth while listening to.

or complying with, this grave neces-
sity. One mayor did suggest a new
“through street” to the racecourse to
satisfy sport, and this new road would
by chance also have been capable of
being extended to the airport, another
vital necessity. But nothing was done,
even for sport.
Consideration or Newcomers.
When a bus service was in operation
and making a success of its service to
the public the Government took it
away and makes huge losses for the
taxpayers to “foot the bill.”
On the human side, fortunately,
numerous organistaions have sprung
into being for the express purpose of
making visitors feel welcome in this
country.
The International Society, which
was founded by Lady Snowden and
Florence M. Taylor, with Aubrey
Halloran as its President and W.
Lansdown as Hon. Secretary, wel-
comes numerous new arrivals and in-
troduces them to friendly people.
They entertain them, but they cannot
find homes for them; nobody can.
The International Ball (The Aus-
tralian Association for the United
Nations, established to better interna-
tional relations and so that newcomers'
interests may be looked after) is to
be held at the Trocadero on 4th
August. There will be about 40
nations represented at the “top table,”
and representative folks from all coun-
tries elsewhere in national dress.
Then we have the New Australian
Cultural Association with its founder.
Miss Arline Lower. They have done
a tremendous lot towards making
artistic souls from abroad feel wel-
come when they come here. They
have their monthly concerts in Palings
Concert Hall, where they can hear
delightful music. At its last function
on July 3rd, Mr. J. van Hees, living
in Victoria, was presented (by proxy)
with the Florence M. Taylor prize for
the best essay amongst the New Aus-
tralians, which has been sponsored by
the N.A.C.A. and is organised by the
Department of Education, which is re-
sponsible for choosing the winning
essay, all about Australia. Their papers
are most expressive, amusing and
learned.
And all of these nice thoughts
and deeds are being undertaken by
Australian people, whilst the indif-
ferent State Government will turn a
couple, living in a garage, out into
the street, where they have no place
to rest their head. What a country!
Fortunately we have a Federal
Government wherein everything is
going swimmingly. In just a few
years the Menzies Government switch-
ed this country, which was heading
for inflation and bankruptcy under a
Labour Government, into one of
sound national economy with revenue
increasing and expenses, including
taxation, cut and more cuts and
greater prosperity are in sight.
BOOK REVIEW.
“Pencil Drawing for the Architect,”
by Charles I. Hobbis. (72 pages,
64 illustrations. Published by Alec
Tiranti Ltd., London. English
price, 7/6d.)
This booklet, says the author, has
been written in order to instruct the
architectural student in the art of
freehand pencil drawing, in the belief
that a sound knowledge of this sub'
ject will help him better to prepare
accurate and pleasing architectural
drawings of building projects for his
future clients. He has chosen pencil
because he considers it the freest and
easiest method for a beginner to
handle.
No better advice can be given to
the student than to “draw and keep
on drawing,” for only by practice is
it possible for him to obtain that
mastery of his medium which will
serve him well all through his life.
The absence of true knowledge acts
as a brake and prevents the develop'
ment of that freedom which, cannot

be gained except by a solid basis of
hard work.
Unceasing Practice.
Although unceasing practice is
called for. the subject is of relatively
little importance and the author re-
cords that one of the most prominent
of the modern artists, in the person of
Vincent Van Gogh, made superb pic-
tures out of bedroom chairs and
bunches of grass.
An artist like Picasso, he adds, is
not usually associated with careful and
accurate draughtsmanship, yet his
early work shows that he had a back-
ground of sound knowledge from
which he eventually developed his
very personal style.
Vital Points.
The main points that the student
must always consider in his work are:
1) The shape of objects and the
shape of the spaces around
them.
2) The correct angle of lines in
relation to each other; that is,
correct perspective.
3) Analysis of the nature and
texture of the subject, which can
only be achieved by a very
careful study of form.
He draws a distinction between the
free sketch, which calls for an ap-
proach where all but the essentials
have been eliminated, and more de-
tailed and elaborate studies. Some of
the best of Constable’s works, he re-
minds his readers, were not his care-
fully worked out studio compositions,
but his quicker opemair sketches.
That the author practises what he
preaches is borne out by the fact that
his own drawings dominate the con'
tents, and he shows himself to be a
most competent draughtsman of all
types of architectural work. His style
is what may be described as reason'
ably “tight,” although he has the
capacity of altering his technique to
suit different subjects. The illustra'
tions also include work by such well'
known draughtsmen as Muirhead
Bone, Augustus Welby Pugin, and
W .R. Lethaby, while there are also
drawings by J. S. Cotman, David Cox,
J. W. M. Turner, and a number of
others . It is unfortunate that gener'
ally speaking pencil drawings do not
reproduce well and, with one or two
exceptions, there is a certain “woolli'
ness” about the reproductions. Per'
haps they may have come out slightly
better had they been printed on art
paper.
Nevertheless, there would seem to
be lessons inherent in this criticism,
in that if the young architect is, as
the author suggests, to apply himself
to unrelenting study of draughtsman'
ship so as to portray his projects, he
should give earnest consideration to
the question of reproduction, which
plays such an important part in this
era of reproduction in periodicals and
newspapers. If the pencil is to stand
up against pen'and'ink work, more
striking contrast in light and shade
and clear definition should be the
objective.
Generous Use of Paint Shows Industrial
Accident Hazards
BRIGHT PAINTS GENERATE BOTH PRIDE AND SAFETY
IN THE PLANT.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER.
The National Safety Council in
U.S.A. in its recently published report
on Colour in Industry shows the gene-
rally accepted instruction on how to
use colour on plant interiors.
Historically first was developed a
pipe code. The contents of pipes to-
day are classified in this manner: Fire
protection, red; dangerous content,
orange or yellow; safe content, green;
protection materials, bright blue;
valuable materials, pyrple.
Safety Colour Code.
Here is the classification contained
in the American Standards Association
Safety Colour Code;—-
(1) Red is used to identify fire pro-
tection equipment or its loca-
tion, flammable liquid con-
tainers, emergency stop but'
tons for electrical switches, etc.
(2) Yellow or yellow and black
stripes are recommended for
marking hazards that may re'
suit in accidents from slipping,
falling, and bumping into ob'
jects.
(3) Green with white designates
the location of first-aid and
safety equipment such as sheh
ters, gas masks, bulletin boards,
etc.
(4) Black and white is used tor
housekeeping and traffic mark-
ings.
Three other colours have been pro-
posed as an addition to the Safety
Colour Code. They will probably be
included in later editions of the Code.
(5) Orange to attract attention to
special hazards or guards out
of place.
(6) Purple for radiation hazards.
(7) Blue for caution, to be used at
power sources, etc.
There is a third colour for accident
prevention signs. It uses red for
special dangers; yellow for possible
dangers or unsafe practices; green for
safety instruction; black for directions
to stairways and exits. All three codes
have a sufficient conformity.
Colour Improves the Plant
Morale.
The right colours and colour com'
binations in homes, offices, plants and
travel accommodations are important
both for health and efficiency. Re'
pairing a plant interior in proper
colours increases production, as we
have learned by now from experience.
Bright, light colours have a stimulat'
ing and cheering influence on most
people, producing very much the same
effects as would friendly words of em
couragement.
There is no doubt, V. R. Croswell
stated recently, that colour on equip'
ment and plant interior improves plant
morale. It generates pride in the
plant and in the job. It is a big help
in solving housekeeping problems.
And anything that increases employee
interest in the job and improves house'
keeping will automatically increase
safety.
Bright Paints —But Not
Too Bright.
Light'coloured surfaces may reflect
too much light and produce glare,
resulting in eye strain and fatigue.
The percentage of light reflected is:
%
White 82'89
Cream 73 ' 78
Ivory 62 'BO
Buff •• 61 '75
Aluminium 65
Light Green .. .. 49'66
Dark Green .. .. 11'25
Yellow 48'75
Light Wood (Tan) 42'49
Grey 36'61
Light Blue 34'61
Pink 30'46
Dark Tan 17'63
Brown Wood .. .. 17 '29
Dark Red 13 ' 30
White usually is used on the ceiling
and colours of medium reflectance
values for working surfaces, walls and
floors. As a general rule, ceilings
should reflect 75% of the light that
strikes them in order to provide ade'
quate lighting on the working place.
Colours having reflectance values of
50% to 60% are recommended for
walls directly in line with the workers’
eyes. This means restful conditions
for the eyes. Floors should have a
reflectance factor of 25%.

stresses the magintude of the improve'
merit in plant morale that followed a
good paint job with improved visi'
bility and safety. Responsible plant
executives say that colour in the plant
has reduced eye strain and physical
fatigue, has been responsible for a
definite improvement in production,
and has reduced absenteeism 20%, A
plant improved with bright colours is
said to attract a higher type of
workers.
R. J. Cooke reported an experience
in a large plant where new workers
were given the task of unloading
boxes of rivets from freight cars. The
boxes were painted black and the men
took frequent rests, slowing up the
unloading time. At the advice of a
colour expert, the boxes were painted
light green. Immediately, the men
began taking fewer rest periods, and
the empty freight cars moved out of
the yard faster. Painting the boxes a
light colour had created an optical
illusion which made the workmen less
conscious of fatigue.
Drop in Industrial Accidents
Due to Repainting.
“Textile World” recently published
the experience of Rome Hosiery Mills
in Rome, Georgia, which in its in'
dividual way, by using new paints,
produced a sharp drop in minor acci'
dents as well as near injuries.
Machinery had been painted before
to indicate danger spots. These were
the spots where serious accidents could
occur. But what about so'called minor
spots?
Every corner, stairs, railing and ex-
posed machine parts were painted, as
advised by Mr. R. Primm, the plant’s
manager. Throughout the mill, wide
focal orange strips were painted on
posts and corners. Electric switch
boxes got coats of orange paint. Wide
orange strips on columns indicated
motor switches, while narrow orange
strips indicated light switches. Back'
ground areas, such as where fire ex'
tinguishers hang, were painted a vivid
rad.
Hand rails on stairs were painted
black the ends received coats of focal
yellow. Step edges, guards for
machinery and equipment, the elevator
edges and guards, and other spots
likely to be “caution” areas received
coats of bright yellow paint. As extra
safety precaution, the mill fabricated
in its own shop metal guards to place
around the end of drive shafts. They
were painted bright yellow. Caution'
consciousness is evident throughout
the mill, Mr. Primm says, a lot of
skinned shins and bumps have been
prevented through the generous use
of paint, and employee efficiency has
been raised.

colours in its own right and to its own
taste. It is preferable to follow the

SYDNEY NEWSLETTER
Late in June it was announced that
H. W. Thompson Pty. Ltd., Sydney,
Master Builders, were the successful
tenderers for the Australian Institute
of Builders’ new North Sydney H.Q.
There were 10 tenders received,
that of H. W. Thompson Pty. Ltd.
for £55,805 being accepted.
Architect for the new building, who
expects it to be completed by June,
1955, is Mr. Eric W. Andrew.
The development and growth of
Sydney suburban Master Builders’ or-
ganisation is reflected in the decision
of the Manly' Warringah Branch,
M.B.A. of N.S.W., to study ways and
means of erecting a Builders’ Ex-
change.
Full details have been supplied by
the Main Southern Builders’ Exchange
Ltd. (Miranda) as to the manner in
which their recently' completed Ex'
change was financed.
A new Sydney button factory will
have a floor area of 30,000 sq. ft.
with provision for an additional 20,000
sq. ft. It will be erected at Wib
loughby for A. G. Herring (Aust.)
Pty. Ltd.
The first application of Sydney City
Council’s new code on structural steel
will be embodied in Westminster Hall,
to be erected in Phillip Street, at a
cost of about <£500,000. This will be
the first major building to be construct'
ed to the new specifications, which will
effect a saving of an estimated £ 15,000.
Four new Local Government Or-
dinances were made and 78 amend'
ments to existing Ordinances were ef'
fected by the N.S.W. Government in
1952-53.
Matters dealt with included economy
in use of steel, Dyhomit'Bastant build'
ing slabs, glass walling in external
elevations of buildings, floor area
limitations, and training of building
inspectors.
During July, the eight Suburban
Branches affiliated with the M.B.A.
held their annual meetings. All re'
ported satisfactory progress during the
year and a continued upward trend
in building construction.
A new <£1,250,000 Parke Davis
Chemical factory is nearing comple'
tion at Caringbah, Sydney. Produc'
tion will begin shortly and will be in
full swing by September.
The factory and research unit will
be the most modern and elaborately
equipped pharmaceutical plant in the
Southern Hemisphere.
For the year ended June 30 last,
17,025 homes were erected or added
to in the Sydney metropolitan area,
representing 90 per cent, of the total
jobs completed.
Of this total, the N.S.W. Housing
Commission erected 2136 cottages and
10 blocks of flats comprising 883 units.
The average cost per job was £3466,
and showed an increase in cost since
1950'5l of 42.58 per cent., according
to official Water Board figures.
Since July 1, 1954, the N.S.W.
Housing Commission has built 30,525
dwellings. It completed 5177 dwell'
ings in the 12 months ended June 30
—almost 600 more than the previous
record for one year.
At June 30 there were 4684 dwell'
ings under construction, or about to
start, against 3655 a year ago.
The value of completed dwellings,
including flats, was officially estimated
at about £13,000,000.
(Some 30,000 people are waiting
for Commission homes, latest figures
state.)
North Sydney expansion continues.
The latest company to plan an office
block on the North Shore is the
M.L.C. Basically, the structure will
resemble the U.N. Building in Man'
hattan. New York.
Plans show a building about 55ft.
wide and 3 3 3ft. long.
It will contain a spacious modern
shopping centre, and will provide of'
fice accommodation for some 2000
people.
Perlite, a new lightweight aggregate,
is being produced at Botany, N.S.W.
It is used for mixing with Portland
cement, reduces the weight of one
cubic foot of ordinary concrete from
140 lb. to about 30 lb. for light build'
ing and 80 lb. for multi'Storeyed
building. This means big savings can
be effected in the use of steel.
Sydney City Council is to consider
a proposal to build a £750,000 Opera
House at the corner of College and
Liverpool Streets. The slope of the
land would allow two floors for car-
parking.
July drew to a close with much
building activity evident on all sides.
Most c;tv streets have broken out in
a rash of scaffolding and hoardings, as
rebuilding and renovations get under
way.
Builders are optimistic regarding the

Besides spending almost £2,000,000
on new buildings in the Archdiocese,
many thousands of pounds are being
expended on furnishings and equip'
ment.
MASTER BUILDER'S BEQUESTS.
The late Mr. Alfred Leslie Rigby,
Master Builder, who died on March
9, aged 65, left an estate of £146,383.
He also made bequests ranging
from £25 to £5O to employees of Kell
and Rigby Pty. Ltd.
The balance of his estate was left
for the benefit of his widow and
family.
In his lifetime Mr. Rigby took an
active interest in many Sydney chari'
ties, and a number of these will bene'
fit by generous bequests. Among
them are the Boys’ Brigade, Western
Suburbs Hospital, Rotary Club of
Sydney, N.S.W. Society for Crippled
Children, and Infants’ Home, Ashfield.

BRITAIN’S POST-WAR
ELECTRICAL RECOVERY.
I. Post-War Increase in
Plant Capacity.
The story of the post-war recovery
of Britain’s electricity services reads
like a romance. Since VE-day, de-
spite the tremendous damage from
bombing and the heavy toll from the
war years from overloading and lack
of maintenance, the leeway of five
million horse-power has been made
up and an additional six million
horsepower has been installed.
To-day Britain has 32 more power
stations than in pre-war years. The
size of generating units has increased
from the then usual 30 M.W. stand-
ard to huge re-heat units of 180 to
200 M.W., with efficiency 30 per
cent, higher.
The days of recurring blackouts
and breakdowns have passed, and
Britain can now say, “There will be
no more power cuts.”
11. Industrial and Export
Expansion.
In addition to the building up of
her electrical power system to a
figure no less than 50 per cent, above
pre-war years, Britain has also re-
covered her export trade. Electrical
equipment exported to U.S.A. in the
first three months of 1952 was valued
at £875,000. In the equivalent period
of 1953 it was £1,050,000.
India. South Africa, and Australia
are the largest importers. In 1953,
India alone purchased £B| million
worth.
Rural electrification in Britain has
been the most outstanding of her in-
ternal developments. In each year
during the past decade, 10,000 farms
have been electrified, and the energy
supnhed to the agricultural industry
has doubled. The farms connected to
the electricity system now total
134,429.
111. Stabilised Economy
and Cheap Power.
According to a survey of the Eco-
nomic Commission, electricity is
cheaper to-day in Britain than in any
country in Europe (except Scandi-
navia) and in America. While the
prices of all commodities have in-
creased, including coal by double its
pre-war figure and gas by 89 per
cent., the cost of electricity has risen
by only 51 per cent.
Electricity for industrial uses is
about one penny per k.W.h., and to
the domestic user under (ln
1951, electricity to all consumers in
America averaged 1.8 pence per
k.W.h.)
The cost of electricity is bound up
in sound engineering economics,
guided by a balanced policy. Careful
scientific planning of equipment has
improved generating efficiencies. Care-
ful financial policy has resulted in
Britain’s recovery and stability being
reinstated.
IV. Balanced Engineering
and National Outlook.
The struggle between traditional
architectural trends in power station
design and modern functional prin-
ciples has died hard. To-day’s clean-
cut but still impressive outlines give
the appearance of “power” without
the massive cathedral-like buildings.
The Extra High Tension Transmis-
sion pylons carrying 275,000-voltage
electricity throughout the country to
industries has gone far to reduce the
smoke nuisance and improve health.
The use of lower-grade coals in power

The building up of the electricity
supply has been the keystone in a
policy of taking amenities to the man

more congenial; maintaining indus-
trial output with manpower shortages
and in upholding Britain’s traditional
capacity, in the words of Kipling’s
song, to say “We’ve always won.”—

Camda continues to be close to, if
not actually at, the top in hydro-
electric development. The average
hydro-electric power per 1,000 popu-
lation is 1,010 horse-power, second in
that respect only to Norway.
The province of Quebec tops the
list with the highest figure, 1,808 h.p.
Yukon and N.W .Territories show an

Construction trouble of an unusual
nature was experienced in New Zea-
land, due to cracks in the rock founda-
tions at Whakamaru Power Station
site. This has thrown the completion
date back by several months. On
opening up the foundation site, the
cracks appeared and have had to be
made tight with concrete. A three-
inch-wide crack in the dam site has
been cleaned out to 60 feet depth.
In addition, 12 tunnels are being
driven back from the dam into rock

When it became necessary to erect
one high'power (275 k.V.) line
across an existing 66 k.V. line and a
railway track without interrupting the
services, British Insulated Callender
Construction Co. built a protective
scaffolding completely round them,
thus affording full protection. The
scaffoldings were 240 ft. long, 50ft.
high, and formed an arch spanning
the rail cutting. No less than 13
wires had to be erected on the 275
k.V. line, and the work occupied four
days once the scaffold had been
prepared.—“ Electrical Times” (Eng.).

N.S.W. BUILDINGS FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES.
These sketches illustrate some aspects of building progress in Sydney. The new Westminster Hall marks the first
application of the new City Council code on structural steel, which cut building costs by an estimated £15,000.
This is the first major building built to the new specifications. Expansion of business and centralisation of activities
necessitated the removal of G. E. Todd & Co. Pty. Ltd. to an accommodating new building, to house both their
cffices, formerly at Bent Street, Sydney, and their engineering products factory to Revesby The occasion of this
removal celebrated the advent of their 21st anniversary in business. Now they have branches at Melbourne and
Brisbane with Engelbach & Co. Pty. Ltd. as a subsidiary of the G. E. Todd Company. The need for better
residential service has given impetus to the erection of new hotels throughout N.S.W., of which this one at
Waitara is a striking example. Erection has begun on the new £30,000 Church of England Boys’ Home, while
the spacious, well- planned Ryde Bus Depot is indicative of the growth of this form of transport in Sydney.

Application of Colour
In industry
New Science Grows Apace.
A science which has grown rapidly
in recent years is that of the correct
application of colour in factories, in'
dustrial plants, and stores. It helps
to reduce fatigue and thus stimulate
output, states the “Intelligence Digest
Supplement” (Eng.).
The science is based on the reaction
of the human eye to colours and
colour combinations, and is studied
and applied as a complementary to
time and motion study.
Eye Fatigue.
If the human eye concentrates on
a red object for some time and is
then shifted to a white surface, the
momentary colour which is seen is
green, the eye needing time to adjust
itself to the white area.
When similar changes occur hum
dreds of times a day, considerable
strain is placed on the seven eye
muscles.
When the eye is moved from side
to side or up and down, muscular
action takes place, and when the iris
contracts or expands this requires
effort by the muscles, which tends to
tire the eyes.
This fatigue has adverse effects on
other parts of the body, and the
worker tires, to the detriment of pro'
ductive work.
Having realised this important
fact, industry has concentrated on
the elimination of grey, drab ma-
chines, replacing them with colours
both restful and complementary.
Three Applications.
The science of colour application
can be divided into three main
groups;
• Machines.
• Building walls and and ceilings.
• Floors and aisles.
The main rules which are used to
access the application of colour to
a factory interior relate to the combi'
nation which will allow the human
eye to take up its natural colour
forms while, at the same time, pro'
viding enough contrast to separate
the critical working parts of a ma'
chine from the non'critical static parts.
For example, a grey-painted ma-
chine against a stone-coloured wall
causes the eye to make a quick ad-
justment each time it shifts from grey
to stone shades. Such a colour com-
bination can cause great eye-strain.
Conditions Corrected.
To correct such conditions the
use of mid-green on the wall, with
the main body of the machine in a
darker, restful creates condi-
tions allowing the introduction of
small quantities of red on vital
equipment, such as electrical switch-
gear, so that the eye can quickly
respond in emergencies.
A RADICAL DEPARTURE IN ECCLESIASTICAL DESIGN.
The design of this Presbyterian Church in Stamford, Conn., U.S.A., is breath-taking,
being such a departure from the flat-faced, formulated style of church building.
The purpose of the architect is to create an expression of ecclesiastical force, far
too often missing in the uninspiring structures adopted by stereotyped religion.
The technique adopted gives the effect of surrounding the congregation by an
enormous, many-faceted stained-glass-window vault, floating above a wall of jewels.
From the outside, when lighted it appears as an enormous sparkling diamond; from
the inside, it looks a maze of heaven knows what. A ball tower will rise beside the
church hall. ("Architectural Forum." )

Sorry Record of
industrial Disputes
Strikes Cost N.S.W. a Fortune.
A sorry record of industrial dis-
putes during the first quarter of this
year cost N.S.W. workers the
enormous amount of .£276,103.
According to the latest Common-
wealth statistics, 282 disputes cost in-
dustry 82,175 working days in the
three months ended March 31.
Nearly 82 per cent, of the disputes
occurred in the coal mining industry.
Figures released last week-end re-
vealed the loss in wages to miners
totalled £165,932 —an average loss
per miner of about £5/6/-.
Industrial Turmoil.
But N.S.W.’s shameful. Communist-
inspired chronicle of stoppages, roll-
ing strikes, and preposterous, sense-
less disputes, such as last week’s
Eastern Suburbs bus hold-up con-
tinues unabated.
State Cabinet, dancing to the tune
of the Trades Hall potentates, can-
not lift a finger to restore industrial
peace among the workers, and it is
obvious, judging by the sorry record,
that it has not desire to interfere in
any way with its orders “from above.”
Meanwhile, the sadly-deluded pub-
lie, fully aware that it has put the
saddle on the wrong horse, im'
patiently waits for its day of reckon-
ing—the next State elections.
FORD'S INDUSTRIAL CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA.
Large investment of overseas capital is making a valuable contribution to Australia's
National Development. Here is an aerial view of Ford Motor Coy's, works at
Geelong, Victoria, which was started In 1925 and to-day covers 639,480 sq. ft. If
other Ford establishments in Australia are included the total is well over a million
square feet. A progressive expansion programme now announced involves £6 million
in Ford manufacturing and production in all States. Our hat is lifted to Ford Co.
for their "faith in Australia."

NATURAL RUBBER IN
BUILDING.
Many Uses Explained in Brochures.
The British Rubber Development
Board is issuing a series of brochures
dealing with the uses of rubber in
building, and to bring before archi-
tects, surveyors, builders and owners
the advantages of natural rubber pro-
ducts and rubber latex-cement com-
positions.
Natural rubber latex-cement com-
positions were first produced in Eng-
land in the early 1920’5, and since
then constant research and experience
have been responsible for the develop-
ment of this valuable material. To-
day there is almost universal use of
rubber-latex flooring, underlays, ad-
hesives, mortars, and renderings.
Natural rubber - products figure
largely in the treatment of acoustics,
sound insulation, anti-vibration, and
thermal insulation.
Latex-Cement Compositions.
Natural rubber latex-cement com-
positions are used as floors in hos-
pitals, schools, commercial and light
industrial buildings, housing schemes
of all types, assembly halls, and wher-
ever a hard-wearing surface is re-
quired, but not where considerable
amounts of grease and oil may be
present, as in commercial kitchens,
garages, etc.
The composition can be prepared
for use as underlays or primers, to
provide a level, even surface to re-
ceive sheet and tile materials such as
rubber, rubber mosaic, linoleum, cork
and thermo-plastic tiles.
Latex-cement mixtures not only
form floors, but are used as mortars
for clay brickwork. As such, they
have special properties and find ap-
plication in industry where dilute
acid, along with alkalis and other
chemical liquors, are present.
Structures built in good non-porous
engineering bricks with cement
formed from natural rubber latex and
sand, can be used as neutralising pits,
tan pits, etc. Although latex-cement
possesses powerful adhesion to bricks,
these compositions do not constitute
structural materials where heavy
superimposed or point loading is
involved.
Other uses of latex-cement com-
pounds include fixing glass, glass
bricks, thermo-plastic tiles, and the
surfacing of tennis courts, play-
grounds, steel decks, etc.
Natural Rubber Products.
The use of rubber in acoustics in-
cludes latex foam wall and ceiling
linings, whereby the sound is weak-
ened by frictional losses, and sound
energy becomes heat energy.
Latex foam has been in use for
over 20 years, and has been exten-
sively employed in concert halls,
studios, cinemas, theatres, and wher-
ever seating is required, thus con-
tributing towards acoustical absorp-
tion.
Sound insulation, anti-vibration,
and thermal insulation are dealt with
fully in the brochures, and the uses
of rubber in these categories are fully
explained.
Further information on all aspects
contained in this article may be ob-
tained from The British Rubber
Development Board, Charter House,
4 Bank Place, Melbourne.
PREFAB. HOUSE IN W.A. BUSH.
When an Englishman, Lieut.'Col.
B. Carey arrived in Western Austra-
lia to open up a 5,000-acre farm
from the bush 200 miles north of
Perth, he came complete with prefab,
house.
This was a British-made structure
with an “Arcon” tropical roof.
Three bays provided an area of 30ft.
x 30ft., but the total weight of the
shipment, including packing, was
only 37 cwt.
Advantages of this type of structure
are durability, ease of erection, and
ease with which additions can be
made.
Of the tropical roof alone, one of
the eight types of “Arcon” structure
now being marketed in 78 countries,
28.000 bays providing coverage for
8.500.000 sq. ft. of housing, indus-
trial and amenity buildings had been
exported up to December 31 last.
“Arcon” structures are a product

ports) Ltd., London.]

LOW-LYING AND OTHERWISE.
The two right-hand designs provide snug, low-lying silhouettes, the upper being more in the modern tradition with its very
flatly-pitched roof, while that below, with its somewhat steeper pitch, amidst spacious trees, gives a country atmosphere. The
bottom right example shows how special treatment can be de vised in the design and planning to utilise a hillside site. Top
left is a small, two-storey house which, In spite of a foursquare balcony section, does not escape the rather boxlike look that
so often results from a two-storey house of reasonably small floor area when 9ft. ceiling heights have to be utilised as is
necessary in Sydney building regulations.
