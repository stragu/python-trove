OTIS
The building and its function must deter-
mine the type and design of vertical
transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Otis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators —because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in
vertical transportation.

ANSWER
WHEN special problems arise about the type of surface and kind of
environment where "Alpaste” Paint can be used most effectively, the
advice of Aluminium Union Limited is freely available. The answers given
to questions will be based on our long experience as suppliers of "Alpaste”
and will be supported by the results of constant research in the Laboratory
and elsewhere.
To-day, many trades and industries are concerned with problems arising
from the damaging and deleterious effects of such agents as moisture, the
sun’s heat, corrosive fumes, sea water and rust. Sometimes these problems
are sharpened by reason of defects normally shielded from view, or whe e
the damaged surfaces are placed in inaccessible spots. For these, and simi ar
difficult conditions, the durability of "Alpaste” Pigmented Paint affords full
protection for long periods.
Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste” Paint
Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium, which, when mixed with
a suitable medium, "leaf” and form an opaque and durable metallic shield.
Moreover, "Alpaste’s” high reflectivity and low heat absorption charac-
teristics help to maintain a temperate interior wherever it is used externa ly

A RAPID

TECHNIQUE
for CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS
THE TINSLEY POLAROGRAPH
V
A complete technical advisory service
is available at all ROWCO Branches.
There is no obligation and your en-
quiries will be welcomed.
An instrument for rapid and accurate chemical analysis. It produces current-
voltage curves called polarograms, which are obtained by the electrolysis of any
solution containing electro-reducible or electra-oxidisable substances. The con-
centration and species of the elements in solution can be directly and accurately
determined from the characteristics of the curves.
The development in recording Polarographs of D.C. amplification to the current
passing through the solution in the polarographic cell, permits the use of a pen
recorder, which gives a direct and instantaneous record of the change in current
during analysis. The recorder is undamped and the exact value of the maximum
current at the instant of fall of the mercury drop is shown. The Tinsley High-
Speed Ink Recording Polarograph is the only Polarograph on the market which
can do this. In addition, a damping device is incorporated, which enables the nor-
mal type damped poloragram to be taken without altering the sensitivity of the
recorder.
NEW DERIVATIVE POLAROGRAPH
This latest development enables elements to be distinguished when close together
on the elecrochemical scale, and when the first element is present in much
greater concentration than the second.

COMPETITION AND PRODUCTIVITY
The recent tour abroad of the Australian Building Productivity Team, embracing
leading personalities from all aspects of the building industry—Architects, Builders,
Subcontractors and Material Suppliers—was an event of importance to the Australian
economy.
It recognised that we in this country believed that we could learn from the
methods and practices adopted in other lands and, further, that the initiative was
present in the Building Industry to do something about it, and it must be to the
eternal credit of the industry members of this Team that they met their own
expenses, it being no joyride at the expense of the Government or some other body,
but an intense and sincere effort to. further the Australian building industry.
The manager of the Team, Mr. John O’Keeffe, Executive Director of the
Building Industry Congress of Victoria, in his remarks at the recent welcome home
Luncheon in Melbourne, made some most pertinent comments which not only have
implications to the building industry, but to this country as a whole.
”If,” he said, “I were asked to sunmup in one word the greatest contributing
factor to the high productivity of the American people, I would answer 'Freedom’—
Freedom, and all its implies. They have had controls and they have long since
removed them. They are free to produce what they want —at any price at which
they can sell to any person who wishes to buy. They are free to work when they
want to. . . .To trade when they want to. . . . To givte you service as you want it.
There are no such restraints as we are subject to here.”
Competition, he continued, is the lifeblood of the building industry in the
United States. It is competition that makes pricing keen and consequently holds
costs down. It is the hard school of competition that decides the future of a new
building material or a new method of construction. If it can do things better,
quicker or cheaper, it will be adopted; if not, it is cast aside. This spirit naturally
keeps manufacturers on their toes to see that their own product is meeting the
challenge from others that may be coming forward.
In some areas, Mr. O’Keeffe said, competition had almost eliminated timber
from building, while the same factor in another sphere had resulted in laminated
timber being used in place of steel; concrete blocks had, in some areas, replaced
bricks; competition from aluminium is causing steel interests to watch their preserves.
So it goes on.
"All is the result of competition. Competitive enterprise. Freedom of enter'
prise.”
All this is most stimulating, and one’s reaction is, “Let us have some of this
competition.” Unfortunately, the position in Australia seems to be than one hundred
per cent, demand and more for building materials and labour spells complacency and
tends to remove the stimulus of competition to improve products, produce more,
and lower costs.
Ultimately, this policy cannot work out, and it is sincerely to be hoped that the
members of that Team, who were drawn from right throughout the industry, can
inject some of the stimulating lessons that they have learnt into the building industry
of Australia. If they can achieve this, it will be to our lasting benefit and to their
greatest satisfaction.

THE MEMORIAL HALL
AT SYDNEY CHURCH OF ENGLAND GRAMMAR SCHOOL, NORTH SYDNEY.
Tribute To Fallen Students.
Sydney Church of England
Grammar School is another of the
leading schools of Australia to
erect a Hall as a Memorial to
her sons who served in World
War 11.
On April 6, 1954, the first
Assembly was held in the new
Hall, this being followed on May 4
by the inauguration of the build'
ing by the Governor'General of
Australia, Field'Marshal Sir Wib
liam Slim, and its dedication by
the Archbishop of Sydney, Dr.
Mowll.
We are indebted to “The
Torch'Bearer,” the school’s maga'
zine, for the following history of
the developments leading to the
erection of the building.
The Hall as it stands now is the
culmination of many years of
hopes and aspirations, for as early
in 1935 there were thoughts of a
School Hall to hold the whole
School under one roof. Mr. John
K. Shirley, who, in association
with Mr. Rupert Minnett, was re'
sponsible for the construction of
many of the School buildings of
the ’thirties, prepared sketch plans
for a hall on the piece of ground
between the three'Storey block
and the Alma Street frontage as
part of the planned development
of the School site. He designed a
hall with a basement, in the Cob
legiate Gothic style, as one side
of a future quadrangle, and the
carrying out of his plan was in'
tended after the provision of more
urgent facilities in classrooms and
laboratories.
Then came the war, with cessa'
tion of public building.
Memorial Fund Launched.
In 1945 the School Council de'
cided to launch a fund for a
Public Memorial to Old Boys who
fell in the war, and to incorporate
the Memorial in the School Hall.
The Memorial Fund soon reached
£30,000, and after some years of
shortages of materials it was
found possible in 1951 to obtain
a rough price for Mr. Shirley’s de'
sign, but the figure of £78,000
seemed far beyond the School’s
means, and reluctantly the project
was again postponed. In December,
19.51, Mr. Shirley died, with his
design still only on paper.
Panel of Architects
Appointed.
Early in 1952 a new approach
was made, largely owing to the
determination and energy of the
Chairman of the Executive Com'
Hipsley, the Secretary, Mr. R. E.
Ludowici, and the Headmaster,
Mr. L. C. Robson, all of whom
have since then worked unceas'
ingly and devotedly towards the
attainment of the object of a
School Memorial Hall.
A panel of architects, consisting
of Mr. John Brogan, Mr. Cobden
Parkes, and Professor Leslie
Wilkinson, was asked to report on
the development of the eastern
side of the School property, and
particularly the possiiblity of
simplifying and shaping the exist'
ing ideas in such a way as to
make a beginning possible. They
reported that Mr. Shirley’s ideas
for the development were sound
in principle, and submitted ideas
for a Hall of a less ambitious de'
sign. Finally, Professor Leslie
Wilkinson was commissioned to
develop one of the ideas submit'
ted, with Mr. R. V. Minnett as
associate architect as before.
A Restricted Site.
The problem was to build on a
very restricted site a Hall to hold
about 1000 people with an ade'
quate stage. At the same time the
architect was asked to provide, if
possible, some rooms in conjunc'
tion, which could help to house
some activities of the School then
without adequate provision. Pro'
fessor Wilkinson discarded the
basement of the previous design,
whirh involved costly excavation,
and instead put the Hall on the
first floor, with amenities and
some extra rooms at ground level.

Features of his design were a low'
pitched roof in order to keep the
new building in proportion to
the existing three'Storey block, and
a hexagonal tower to balance the
eastern end and add interest to
the roof. Another unusual feature
is a large pillared space under the
centre of the building, which the
architect has called The Under-
croft.
Tenders were called and from a
large number that of Robert Wall
and Sons was accepted, the con-
tract price being £47,500. The
contract was signed on March 23,
1953, and work began early in
April, 1953.
Hall to Seat 1000.
The new building abuts the
existing three-storey block and
runs towards Alma Street. The
Hall is 100 ft. long and 45ft. wide,
with a stage 24ft .deep and 45ft.
wide. The stage has an annexe,
which is part of the tower, de'
signed to house the lighting con'
trol equipment for auditorium and
stage. There are five large
windows on each side of the audi-
torium, with a balcony on the
south side running from entrance
porch to tower. On the ground
floor are two large rooms and a
smaller one, used as an office, as
well as the amenities necessary
for a hall to which many visitors
will come. A graceful porch pro'
jecting from the building gives
access ,on the south'west, and at
the southeast in the tower is a
spiral staircase leading to the stage
level.
Sound and Lighting
Equipment.
The Hall has built-in speakers
both for voice and musical pre-
sentation, and a control panel and
twin turntables with amplifiers
are housed in the light control
room in the tower. The stage light
set consists of a 24-way dimmer
switchboard of great flexibility,
three compartment battens and
nine spotlights, which provides a
very flexible and satisfactory aid
to dramatic work, and its work'
ing will provide an outlet (under
direction) for the energies of
some boys interested in the elec-
trical and mechanical.
The Memorial.
The Memorial aspect of the
Hall is in two recesses at the top
of the main stairway, one on each
side of the entrance doors to the
Hall itself, and they contain
bronze cases with lettered inscrip'
tions on parchment. One case con'
tains the names of the Fallen with
the School crest and motto, and
the other a Commemorative In-
scription. The execution of these
has been beautifully done by Mr.
Eric Roberts, of Sydney, whose
work is well known.
Miss Margaret Lord was called
in as consultant for interior deco'
ration, and her use of colour has
accented many features of the
design.
Special Seating.
The chairs on the floor of the
Hall are steel-framed with sprung
seat and covered with Vynex
fabric specially designed for the
purpose. There are 144 single
chairs and 102 groups of six, the
single chairs being of such a size
that six side by side are of the
same width as a gang of six, and
all chairs can be removed when
the Hall is used for dancing. In
the gallery, laminated plywood
seats have been used, fastened to
the floor. They are in maple
finish to match the panelling of
the Hall dado and the windows
and doors.
THE SEATING AND GALLERY.
The Hall seats 756, with 145 in the gallery. The long windows and the heavily
panelled ceiling are features of the interior.

A lew Classrooms.
When the Hall was partly
built it was found possible to em-
bark on the building of two class'
rooms adjoining the north-east of
the Hall, which begin the eastern
side of the proposed quadrangle.
They also form part of the work-
ing of the Hall, in that the upper
one on the same level as the stage
can be used in the working of the
stage, while the lower one will be
used as a dressing room.
Entrance Gates.
The completion of the Memorial
Hall has led to a beginning of the
re-making of the main entrance to
the School, and a fine pair of
wrought iron gates, presented some
time ago by the S.C.E.G.S. As-
sociation, has been placed in posi-
tion, and some changes have been
made in the walls and fences to
open up vistas of the harbour and
city and to bring them into har-
mony with the new building.
The whole project stands on the
heights of North Sydney and,
without unduly dominating its sur-
roundings, makes an impressive
Public Memorial which will by its
use contribute to the life of the
School.
Memorial Inscription.
The Memorial Inscription draws
attention to the commemoration
of those who give their lives in
the making of opportunities for
those who follow; it reads:
“In the War of 1939-45, more
than 2000 Old Boys served. Of
these, 231 gave their lives. It is
right that all should be remem'
bered and those who fell be held
in special honour.
“Therefore we who remain have
erected this building as a memorial
to commemorate those who fought
for a cause and gave their lives
for it, to inspire those who follow
to cherish the traditions of their
service, to give the School Com'
munity a place where it may meet
and therein find always present a
reminder of others who were of
this Community in the past and
who went out from it to carry its
traditions into a wider service.
“In the niche on the other side
of this doorway are the names of
the Fallen. The names of all who
served are in a Book of Remem'
France in the School Chapel.”
Architects were Professor Leslie
Wilkinson and Rupert Minnett
(in association).

MAMMOTH CONDENSER.
Said to be the world’s largest
turbine - supporting condenser, the
50Oton fabrication, made by Westing'
house Electric Corp., was transported
to the Raritan River plant site at
Savreville, N.J., in four sections.
This condenser will mount a 137,500
k.W. turbogenerator. It is 26ft. high,
80ft. long, and wide, and will
require 75,400 gallons of water per
minute to condense 567,000 lb. of
steam per hour.

By raising the Hall to the first floor and opening up the centre portion of the
lower section, access from one side of the School grounds to the other is freely
gained. This open under area is known as the Undercroft.

STONE CHURCH AT WOOMERA
BUILT TO CONFORM WITH CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.
In the centre of Woomera, on a
gently-sloping si e, a stone church
seating 135 is being erected for the
United Protestant denominations.
It is being built of a white quartzite
stone, tinged with reddish ironstone
staining. This stone, originally
gathered by the natives, had for many
years been used as walls of sheep
pens on a neighbouring station.
One of the big problems confront'
ing the architect, Mr. K. Murray
Forster, was the high temperatures at
certain times of the year. The build'
ing has been designed so that there
is only one narrow window on the
eastern and front wall. Windows on
the north side are under the shelter
of a covered way.
This covered way will provide
shade for after'church gatherings and
links the church with the free stand'
ing bell tower, thus completing the
composition. The bell tower will con'
tain an electric carillion and will sup'
port a 20ft. high stainless steel cross.
The wide, overhanging eaves will
protect from the direct sun the upper
part of the walls of the nave and
attached vestries. All windows are of
precast concrete, very deep and fan-
like, giving as much protection to the
glass as possible.
Window frames will be painted
white and the underside of the eaves
and covered way a pale dusty green
and white.
The main entrance door consists of
twin sets of doors, forming a trap to
prevent the entrance of dust and
sand.
The main lighting to the nave is
from the south-east and one window,
from ceiling to floor, floods the
apsidal end with light.
The sanded cool coloured walls
support a ceiling panelled in fire-
proof insulating material held with
cranked steel joists in lieu of trusses.
The ceiling will be painted in cool
dusty colours and white.
Corrugated asbestos cement sheet'
ing, painted, will be used to cover
the roof.
NEW BOEING HANGAR.
Boeing Airplane Company’s largest
testing programme, a new 5.8 million
dollar hangar (about <£2.6 million,
Aust.), has been launched at Seattle,
U.S.A.
The hangar has a lengh of 785 ft.,
width 200 ft., and height 90ft. The
height is equal to a seven'Storey build'
ing. It can comfortably house five
Stratofortress bombers with wing
spans up to 300 ft.
The floor area is equal to approxi'
mately three and a quarter football
fields, and the unobstructed doorway
is 780 ft. wide by 65ft. high, with 13
vertical lifts, each weighing 90,000 lb.

Turning Investors
From The City
The Great Fire of London, 1666,
burnt to the ground 13,000 homes in
the very heart of the City, which
ended the era of mediaeval London.
It was expected that a splendid new
City would spring up on the site of
the old one, on lines radiating from
the Royal Exchange. Wren was
available and his prodigious plans
came forth, but they were not carried
out, whereupon the City bent its step
westward and built as beautiful a City
as they could afford, leaving the old
one to continue on its cramped'up
site as hitherto.
The Sydney County Council can
take a lesson from this. If people are
not permitted to progress according to
their desires, the inevitable happens
—“Go west, young man, go west.’*
In this instance, it is “going
north.” It may not be in the City’s
interest to let this happen, unless the
City Council cares not a rap whether
we develop a twimcity or not, in
which case it would lose much of its
prestige and power of development
(and the taxes that go with it).
Why do people who know nothing
of development by others who have,
all through the years, advanced this
vast and beautiful city, make laws
that curtail every inch of develop'
ment? The only thing this city is
lacking in its transport, and the only
people responsible for this condition
are those who hold high office but
have no knowledge of civic develop'
ment, and it is this type that is cur'
tailing the progress of all others.
We wish the enterprising firms
who have shown courage to build on
the other side of the Harbour every
success.
Coal is being dredged from the
Susquehanna River at a lake formed
behind the Safe Harbour Dam, to
feed the Holtwood Plant of the
Pennsylvania Water and Power Com'
pany. The coal is anthracite and will
be dredged at the rate of half a mil'
lion tons in the nine months of
favourable weather to serve the
year’s requirements. The dredgings
will be unloaded at Safe Harbour
and pumped about 275 ft. above the
river level to the coal recovery and
washing plant. The coal is then de'
watered and sent to the pulverisers.
The new boiler at Holtwood is
rated at 700,000 lb. of steam per
hour, 945 lb. per sQ. inch pressure,
905°F., and is reported to be the
world’s largest anthracite coal'fired
boiler. It will burn more than 46
tons of river coal per hour. —“Electri'

CHURCH OF OUR LADY OF THE ASSUMPTION
TREVALLYN, LAUNCESTON, TASMANIA.
Architects, Roy Smith and Willing.
The architects in the design of this
small church were confronted with a
small, steep site and the usual frugal
budget that seems to be associated
with so much ecclesiastical work.
The steep nature of the site makes
it difficult to obtain a good general
view, but the simple lines can be well
appreciated from the upper view; it is
unfortunate that an attractive square
tower designed to dominate the main
entrance—that now is finished with
the gable on the right—had to be
eliminated on the ground of cost.
The interior captures the simplicity
of material and expression of some
of the smaller peasant Continental
churches, and is very successful with
its bagged walls, open timber roof
trusses and roof effects, pews and floor
all in honey-coloured Tasmanian oak.
The recessed Sanctuary, side-lit,
flanked with the arches, provides
scale and dignity to the interior.
A DUNLOP FACTORY
APPOINTMENT.
Mr. H. Tonks, closely associated
for the past seventeen or eighteen
years with most major developments
which have taken place at the Dunlop
Australia Limited factory at Drum-
moyne, has been appointed Assistant
Factory Manager.
Mr. Tonks received his early em
gmeering training with a Sheffield
firm of Consulting Engineers. Com'
ing to Australia in 1924, he soon
joined the Perdriau Rubber Company
as a draughtsman. In 1935 and 1936,
he spent some time at the Dunlop
factory in Montague, Melbourne, and
the Drummoyne plant, helped in
then, becoming chief draughtsman to
establishing various new departments;
and did preliminary design work for
Battery Box manufacture. During the
war years, Mr, Tonks also worked on
the designs for the Thermal Reclaim
Plant at Drummoyne and other Dun'
lop developments, including the foot'
wear plants at St. Marvs and Banks'
town N.S.W., and ‘ the Dunlop
Weatherproofs Factory at Wagga. He
was appointed Chief Engineer at
Drummoyne in 1941.
Mr. Tonks went overseas in April,
1949, and from his observations in
Britain, America and Canada was
able to incorporate new ideas in the
Drummoyne Factory.

Next Meeting.
The next General Meeting of the
Society will be held on Thursday, 2nd
September, when it is proposed that
an address will be given by Dr.
Dressier on the subject of “The
Light Meter and Its Uses.”
Subject for the evening was an ad-
dress by Mr. E. L. Freedman on his
recent trip abroad, and this is pub-
lished on page ??.
A vote of thanks, proposed by Mr.
Dawson and seconded by Mr. Johnson,
was carried by acclamation.
U.S. ENTERPRISE.
The rate of growth of electricity
supply in the United States is such
that the energy sales will double in
the next 25 years. This means that
sales, both from public supply under-
takings and industrial plants, will
reach the figure of 2,457,000,000
mega-watt hours (M.W.h.) by 1968.
In 1953, 24 per cent, was hydro-
generation and 76 per cent, fuel
plants, but by 1978 the hydro per-
centage will probably have fallen to
ten.
ELECTRIFYING BRITAIN’S
RAILWAYS.
In 1931 a Committee on Railway
Electrification recommended that at
least half the lines in England should
be electrified. Economic conditions at
that time prevented action, then came
the Second World War.
Fifty years ago, 80 miles of track
pioneered electric traction in Britain;
now there are some 2400 miles, of
which 2000 miles radiate from Lorn
don. Even allowing for progressive
change-over from s‘eam to electricity,
at 22 per cent, of the mileage a year,
it would take 15 to 20 years to com-
plete the more densely loaded lines.
A conservative estimate of the
power that would be required to
operate the electrified line would be
a demand of 750,000 k.W., which,
spread over 15 years, would require
60.000 k.W. addi ional plant capacity
per annum.
Costs have risen fourfold since
1931, but, even so, the use of low-
grade coal for electric generation as
against high-grade coal for loco-
motives might have saved £4,000,000
(sterling) last winter).
The Beaver report on atmospheric
pollution show* that nearly 20 per
cent, of the smoke and grit nuisance
is due to steam locomotives. Recent
estimates give the annual economic
loss to the country from air pollution
to be between £lOO million and £l5O
mdion.
While the railways are not respon-
sible for all this, they may be respon-
sible for £2O million, equivalent to
some 27 shillings for every ton of
coal they burn.

NOVEL VERANDAH AT AIR TERMINAL.
Extending over the passengers' entrance of the air terminal building at Zurich,
Switzerland. Curved inverted troughs of corrugated aluminidfjksjdfksdfjum have been made to
form a shelter over the pavement. The novel arrangement of these troughs gives
them maximum rigidity, so that only two vertical columns are required for their
support. The side troughs are cantilevered out for the entire length, which must
be 40 or 50 feet. Continuous electric light fittings under alternating trough gutters
produce a novel and arresting effect that has charm and shows how far man's
ingenuity is developing In using these new materials.

OVERSEAS IMPRESSIONS
By ERNEST L. FREEDMAN, M.I.E.S. (Aust.)*
Address Delivered to the Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia
(N.S.W. Section) on August 5, 1954.
EUROPEAN IMPRESSIONS.
To visit Europe, after seventeen
years in Australia, makes for joyful
reunions and sad partings; for much
happiness of memories, but also for
much sorrow for the present and
doubt for the future. As this visit
had a very personal and family back-
ground, lighting and .lighting affairs
took second place during the months
abroad.
London seemed mightier than ever;
of a serene beauty which radiates
from within. There they were again:
the first upsurge of the eyes on enter-
ing the Abbey; the roof-over-one’s-
head feeling which St. Paul’s inspired;
the profound enjoyment of the Eng-
lish theatre, opera and concert; the
matter-of-factness of the English at
home; the first meetings with fluo-
rescent street lighting; the Festival
Hall and Television.
After London to Lisbon and Estoril,
rendezvous of the crowned and de-
crowned heads of Europe and haven
from heavy taxation for many of the
well-to-do of the U.K. and the
Continent.
Lisbon is a city of contrasts: the
new and the old, the rich and the
poor, the articulate and the illiterate;
the rugged ruins of an old monastery,
the smoothness of an ultra-modern
church; neon signs as background to
the plaintive melodies of the mendi-
cant cutler; barefooted fisher-women
carrying large flat baskets on their
heads, with a pair of shoes resting
snugly on top of the fish; the wide
spans of the modern Autostrada
against the arches of a Moorish
aqueduct; the beggar’s philosophy;
that poorness is a malady which God
inflicts and only God can heal; the
splendour of the latest luxury homes;
and "patientia,” the byword of all.
Jacaranda and palm r , gum trees
and wattle; a brilliant white sun shin-
ing on small and large houses, all
painted gaily in stark colours, and
adorned with motifs of, mostly, blue
glazed tiles (azuleios), forming a
scroll here, or the picture of the
Madonna or of a sea-going frigate
there, or merely spelling the name
of the house. Clear light and deep
shadows, blue skies and the green
waters of the Atlantic; and the Tajo
carrying picturesque fishing craft
with rust'brown sails, and Portuguese
men-o’-war. Were it not for the
Portuguese themselves, and for the
monumental reminders of 2000 years
of glorious history, one could imagine
oneself standing at the sea-front at
Manly, or overlooking the Harbour
from the Botanical Gardens, or walk-
ing the steep streets of the ’Loo, or
admiring the homes and gardens of
Vaucluse and Bellevue Hill.
Against this traditional background,
there is great industrial and commer-
cial activity; new factories, new rail-
ways. new administrative buildings,
new airports, new arenas, new
churches; and all around Lisbon new
residential suburbs of row after row
of four to six-storey apartment houses,
with ten square foot balconies the
only access to the sun. How well we
are off in our suburban gardens!
Germany.
It was no homecoming to Ger-
many; and, thinking of the past, one
often could sadly say with Richard
Llewellyn: "How green was my val-
ley, then, and the valley of them
that have gone.” The Germans
mourn: Germany has lost her soul;
but did a country ever possess a soul
which invented the gas chambers and
taught the world to wage total war?
So many German cities are destroyed:
60%, 75%, 90% —even 100%, as in
the case of Dresden. No dry per'
centage figures can ever describe the
sight of these dead cities and, in spite
of memories of the scene outside St.
Paul’s, one cannot rejoice, but bows
humbly before Tragedy, in the classi'
cal Greek sense, which contained guilt
as the primer of the catastrophe; but
one will find only few in Germany
who assume moral jesponsibility, who
admit: Yes, we wiped the City of
Rotterdam from the face of the earth;
yes, we boasted that we would
"Coventry” all England .
There is hectic building and re'
construction in West Germany; Ham'
burg and Hanover, Cologne, Frank'
furt and Munich, but their particular
stvles and atmosphere seem lost; they
are the war profiteers of the post-war
Germanv benefiting so much from

the ruins and the losses of the East,
and particularly of Berlin. Yet Ber-
lin, resembling a grotesque Holly'
wood version of a modern Pompeii
and the Potemkin Villages, is still the
heart of Germany’s culture; and the
Berliners—to be alive you had to
risk your life—have not lost their
supreme sense of humour; they can
and do still laugh, with Schopenhauer,
about the tragic jokes which fate has
played against themselves. However,
politically and economically, Berlin,
an enclave of the Red East, has little
illusions for the future; the Russians
have seen to that.
The German industry' miracle is
exemplified by the Hanover Indus'
try Fair, which is to-day bigger than
the Leipzig Fairs of pre-war fame.
But this miracle is wrought with
American capital from a German in-
dustrial war machine which was to a
large percentage left intact at the end
of the war: and many German fac-
tories, with brand-new modern equip-
ment are now competing against
foreign industries using the old Ger-
man pre-war machines which the
Allies dismantled and re-installed in
their own factories after the war;
what irony of fate!
However, the German industrial
boom profits but a privileged few; no
starker contrast is imaginable than
that between the tired and worried
workers marching in the May Day
Procession, and the industrialists and
exhibitors of the Hanover Fair,
standing at the kerbside.
Fortunate Australia.
Back to Australia—home. One for
one, and in all stata of human life,
we here seem to be better off than
our brothers and sisters in Europe.
Certainly, the cultural achievements
of past centuries, the grandeur of the
classical facades and the perfection of
the English stage, luxury spending
■and the niceties of life, the greens of
an English meadow, and the charms
of a holiday at a Bavarian lake; cer-
tainly, these are not for us. But,
neither are for us the pretensions and
frustrations of the Old World, the
anxieties and fears of the political
volcano, the crowdedness of the Euro-
pean cities, and the unemployment and
the ruthlessness of the European
labour scene. The “Australian Way
of Life” is not an idle boast; and, on
leaving Europe, one cheerfully says
farewell with the Shakespearean
words: “If we meet again, why, we
shall smile; if not, why, then this
parling was well made.”
LIGHTING IMPRESSIONS.
Lighting impressions were many
and varied; one overall picture seemed,
however, to emanate: that the Aus-
tralian lighting standards are high, at
least as high as those in England and
on the European Continent. One has

exterior is all carried out in small tiles. This type of decoration is extensively used
on the facades of Portuguese buildings, blue being the predominant colour.

to concede: the European peak pro-
ductions are unattained here, both in
the installation as in the fixtures fields.
But we seem to maintain a higher
average of performance; and the gap
seems smaller in Australia between
theory and practice, between the
figures and methods as laid down in
our codes, and as practised in the
commercial field .
One is inclined to give considerable
credit to the work of the Illuminating
Engineering Societies of Australia.
With the inclusion in the member'
ship of the Societies of the interested,
the commercial men, as opposed to
the specialised Illuminating Engineer,
there did result a greater awareness
of the technical problems amongst
the men in the field, and a greater
responsibility is being assumed by the
salesmen for the technical results of
their campaigning.
In Store Lighting, this Australian
attitude is quite marked. Compare
the many hanging eggcratedouvred
and open-top fluorescent fixtures in
England with the ceiling-mounted
longitudinal-glass-louvred fixtures which
characterise Australian store lighting;
the many unnatural lighting installa-
tions on the Continent with the
cleanliness of the long lines of light
of our Chain Stores. In smart shops,
a revival of the incandescent lamp is
most noticeable, together with a sur-
prising amount of totally indirect
fluorescent lighting.
In Window Lighting, the egg'
crate louvre'all ceiling is the cul'
standing technique, with great con-
centrations of fluorescence above the
louvres and large numbers of surpris'
ingly static reflector lamps protruding
through the egg'crates. In many
shops, the windows are brought deeply
into the shop interior and separated
from the main merchandising area by
a hand-rail,

FLUORESCENT ROAD LIGHTING.
Fluorescent lighting is used extensively
in Germany for road lighting, and these
illustrations show two popular types of
fitting; the upper units, known as whip-
type, extend out over the roadway,
whereas the lower cluster type gives
more concentrated illumination at
appropriate points.
UNUSUAL LIGHT FITTING.
This unusual light fitting in the grounds
of the "Rocheira" mansion at Estoril, in
Portugal, has a rather Chinese feeling
about it.

Place Vendome in Paris; cleanly
styled fluorescent lanterns in Lisbon;
mile after mile of Sodium and M.V.
lighting on the approach roads to the
European cities; and fluorescent street
lighting in many forms and techniques
throughout Europe, and especially in
Germany.
Noteworthy sidelights: light'blue
street lighting poles in London; minia'
ture traffic lights at motorist’s eye
level in Paris: the discrimination be'
tween first' and second'dass rail
travellers in Germany, through higher
illumination values in the first'dass
compartments.
In Office Lighting, one could notice
some retracting from fluorescence, and
the Time and Life building in Lon'
don and the Contintental Tyre build'
ing in Hanover are typical examples
of this trend.
Finally, the Lighting Fixtures. At
a meeting of the London 1.E.5., a
panel of four pleaded with the Light'
ing Industry: Stop this useless and
wasteful multiplicity of detail, and
concentrate on the basic designs.
Travelling from country to country,
one likes to join this plea: one finds
but little difference of principle any'
where; it is “thema con variazioni”
everywhere, ind the chandelier still
reigns supreme.
However, especially in the chan-
delier design, one can clearly see ex'
pressions of the national characters;
in England: traditional motifs and
solid materials; in Portugal: ornately
baroque decorations and costly and
showy materials! in Germany: func'
tional designs and modern materials.
To visit the Lighting Hall at the
Hanover Fair was an exhilarating ex'
perience. But, even there, little was

to be seen of the typical Australian
lighting glassware which fits so neatly
into the modern interior and produces
efficient and comfortable seeing
conditions.
The most remarkable phenomenon,
however, is the immense gulf which
exists in Europe between the cheap
and medium-priced fixtures, as sold in
the large City showrooms or the
small suburban shops, and the high-
class fixtures of contemporary design
of a few highly specialised firms.
These firms produce, at prices which
are quite beyond the Australian mar-
ket, truly fine contemporary fixtures;
of superb design and taste, perfectly
styled, from expensive materials, of
clean colours and textures, and of
magnificent workmanship in every de-
tail; and little holes in every other
fitting! However, whilst one must
again admit the Australian shortcom-
ings at the luxury level, the Austra-
lian average standard of fixture design
and production seems to compare
favourably with that seen overseas.
So, the lighting man returns home;
with much new knowledge and ex-
perience, greatly stimulated by the
discussions with the colleagues over-
seas, and fully conscious that there is
still much to be learnt from abroad,
much to be done here, and also much
to be desired; but also convinced that
in this country we are aware of the
problems in store for us, and are pre-
pared to approach these courageously,
without the ballasts of prejudice and
traditions, but with a clear mind and
in a technical manner.
EIGHT-STOREY FLATS
FOR CANBERRA.
Some surprise has been expressed
at the intention of the Federal Gov-
ernment to erect eight-storey buildings
in Canberra to provide flats for pub-
lic servants when so much unoccupied
land is available.
Three eight-storey blocks are con-
templated—of course, they will be
the highest structures in New South
Wales outside of Sydney. According
to Canberra reports, tenders for the
work will be invited towards the end
of the year.
There will be one and two bed-
room quarters, and the idea is that
they shall accommodate the 2000-odd
public servants whom it is intended
as soon as possible to transfer to the
national capital chiefly from Mel-
bourne.
Canberra s tallest existing building
is the <£3,700,000 administrative block,
still to be completed, and which con-
tains four floors above ground level,
with basement accommodation also.

IMPORTANT PROJECT COMPLETED
RADIO TRANSMITTING STATION, DOONSIDE, N.S.W.
Architects, Hennessy, Hennessy 8C Co. Master Builders, A. F. Little Pty. Ltd.
Recently completed, approximately
six miles west of Prospect and half a
miles from the Main Western High'
way at Eastern Creek, is the new radio
transmitting station.
This station building is located on
a rising knoll in an area of approxi'
mately 700 acres, the greater proper'
tion of which is being laid out with
transmitting aerials. The new build'
ing, when completed and occupied,
w*ill replace the existing transmitting
station which has operated for many
years from Pennant Hills.
The main building is built of face
bricks, with reinforced concrete sus'
pended floors, and is generally a two'
storey building.
The main entrance vestibule gives
access to the large transmitting hall,
approximately 140 ft. Jong by 40ft.
wide, in which will be located the
modern radio transmitting equipment.
Below the hall is located the plant
room, and the front section of the
building is planned for administrative
offices and lavatory accommodation.
A feature of the front has been
made the large water storage pool
which while serving a utilitarian pur-
nose, has also been made an aesthetic
feature in the general treatment of
the front.
The large diesel stand'by plant is
provided in the design, as well as
outdoor staff quarters, workshop,
lunch room, and garages, etc .
About three'quarters of a mile
from the station building on Doom
side Road are being built fourteen
residences for the staff. Each cottage
has been individually treated for
colour, and will be serviced with
water, sewer and electrical services.
The layout of the scheme provides
for future development of recrea'
tional and social facilities for the staff.
RESISTANCE STRAIN GAUGES.
“Characteristics and Applications of
Resistance Strain Gauges,” being the
published proceedings of the synv
posium held in 1951, has been pub'
lished by the National Bureau of
Standards, Washington, D.C., and is
obtainable from the United States
Printing Office —price, one and a half
dollars (plus mail costs and ex'
change).
Although strain gauges are a com'
paratively new tool in the study of
materials and structures, they are con'
sistently being applied to wider uses,
and the eleven papers contained in
this volume will be found very help'
ful and valuable to those dealing with
strains and stresses in structures, from
aeroplane wings to bridges.

Increasing Housing Accommodation
and Other Buildings
For Migrants, newly-born Australians, growing-up Australians, getting-
rich Australians, and married couples, housing and all the subsidiary
buildings for their use, have to keep in step with the demands this increasing
population entails.
By FLORENCE M. TAYLOR.
Take any paper you like and read
about the freedom given to all kinds
of enterprise to trade, to the best of
their ability, and make a success of
their undertakings.
It seems perfectly logical for a man
who has money to turn it to good
account, by investing it to the best
advantage. We can invest in shares
or put our money on racehorses, pre'
pared to risk as much as we like for
a prospective win. This is allowable
under the law. But one of the things
we cannot do is to invest money in
property to advantage, though that is
the crying need to make the country
progress.
At one time people invested money
in properties, homes for the people
and to house their enterprises. The
Fair Rents Court took away the free'
dom of the home landlord by reduc'
ing his prospect of enterprise and
winning. They permitted him to stay
in business as such as long as he was
content to remain on a losing wicket,
as something under 5% might be
called, for such an entail. Building
restrictions embodied in by' laws
squashed the freedom of all others
whose business necessitated an in'
crease in their establishments. They
may apply their money to other
things, but they must meticulously
leave building alone, as an investment.
Financial News Reports.
Picking up a paper casually, we
read that
Davies Co'op. paid 16£%,
Elder Smith 12%,
Johns and Waygood 16%,
•Automobile & Generale Finance
Co. 15%,
Hire Finance Ltd. 13|%.
National Radiators 13 1/3%.
The latest profit announced from
Sports is £48,000. This is permissible.
As long as people are permitted to
make profits the country can forge
ahead, and the Government takes a
quarter or a half of it in taxation and
this ensures its livelihood and the ex'
pansion of our country. Without tax'
ing the profits people make, the Gov'
ernment could not exist for five min'
utes, so the more companies know
how to make, the more workable and
wealthier the country becomes all
round, including the workers them'
selves
Looking at the “Daily Telegraph”
(14.8.54), jt read:
Newcastle Wallsend Coal Co. paid
a 10% dividend.
Beaver Trading Co. Ltd. paid
12£% dividend.
Austral Amalgamated Tin Ltd. will
not pay a dividend for 1954.
Molloy Holdings declared 10%.
Melbourne Steamship Co. Ltd. 9%.
Hooper Bailie Industries Ltd. 15%.
Bricksworks 12£%.
This means that six companies out
of seven are trading for the profits to
which their labours entitle them.
The seventh must have had a few
problems to contend with, for every
company, every individual, is in bush
ness for profit. Even the labourer is
worthy of his hire, though at present
he is under the impression that he
can “lean on his shovel” and get rich
at it. He is making a mistake. He
can only idle himself out of a job
that way. and it will come sooner or
later. Real success and lasting benefits
can only come to those who work in-
defatigably, and no employer be'
grudges the something extra to keep
his best hands working happily to'
gether through bad times as well as
good, if at all possible.
Working Hard For Success.
At present those who work hard
are carrying the burden of slothful
co'workers, whose slackness is des-
tined to keep the employer at a low
ebb of production, from which level
h e cannot recognise the merits of his
best workers. The only thing to do is
to get the slothful out, in order that
the better class of worker may earn
the fruits of his welhearned labours—
if not in immediate monetary gain,
then in terms of permanency, with
opportunity and increases to match as
the years go by.

Bricks And Mortar
An Investment.
As an investment there should be
nothing better than bricks and mor-
tar, for though companies may fail
in a depression, never to return,
bricks and mortar “will come again.”
Frustrating natural development as
the Government has done in the
Fair Rents Act and enforcing building
restrictions, won’t contribute much to
natural progress. As a matter of fact,
it can only bring about stagnation,
as it has done in the building of
homes by investors.
It must not be forgotten, too, that
all the beautiful buildings in our city
upon which the City Council depends
for its rates, which enable it to carry
on, were all built by private enter-
prise that had made profits in the
past. No matter how much they
make in profits now, they cannot
build.
Our Scarcest Commodity.
The scarest commodity in our coun-
try at the present time is a sufficiency
of homes. The idea of introducing
the Fair Rents Act in the first place
was to keep rents down to a level so
that the poor would not be exploited
by the rapacious landlords, but no
landlord has ever charged in rentals
what the Government is now charg-
ing for the houses it has built. There
are now no poor—unless it be the
erstwhilt landlords themselves, whose
living standards from rent have to
conform to 1939 levels, about one-
third proportionately of what the
poorest of workers receive. Nowadays
the people who use the Fair Rents
Court mostly are the landlords in an
endeavour to get their rentals raised.
Where Will Homes Come From?
Government, right now, talks of
bringing 100,000 migrants into the
country, but where are they going to
find homes for them? Obviously
people are not going to leave a roof
over their heads and a pillow under
them to come to Australia, where
they can get neither. And, if they do
come, a number of them will work
hard to get enough money to return
to their home country, unless we treat
them better now than we are doing
with regard to providing homes.
When migrants were permitted to
enter U.S.A. (before they over-
crowded it), no less than 23,116,501
arrived between 1820 and 1905, in-
cluding 9,351,857 from Britain and
arrived between 1820 and 1905 —a
steadfast average of almost 300,000
a year for 85 years including
9,351,857 from Britain and Ireland.
No less than 8,136,016 people
went there from Europe between 1901
and 1910, or 900,00 on an average
for nine years. America’s doors are
now closed, but ours could be opened
to them if we only had houses for
them.
That is rapid movement, yet a
housing shortage such as we are show-
ing for ourselves was never heard of.
Fifty years ago our population was
4,000,000. Then immigration did not
increase for five years. There was a
rest.
One had to be a capitalist and
land with no less than £lOO.
Now, all one needs to do is to be
a willing worker and one can land
without further ado.
Our Crime —Shortage of Homes.
There are now 9,000,000 of us,
and we cannot build 100,000 houses
for newscomers a year. We built
70,000 throughout Australia last
year. Nor can we build for our own
newly-weds, who require 72,153
homes a year (from Tune, ’52-’53).
Our newly-born increases by 200,000
a year (June, ’52-’53), nor can we
catch up the backlog of homes
brought about by the war, when one
could not spend more than £25 on
any home, as materials and men were
all requisitioned for war.
The Future of Our Children.
Growing children require extra
rooms, in addition to schools, churches,
kindergartens, sports fields, picture-
houses, business premises, shops, and
all the buildings that have, perforce,
to keep in step with man’s develop-
ment, which includes transport, in
which we are so sadly lacking. For
trams now run at any old time, get-
ting people to work at odd hours,
and not at the regular hours they
have been used to.
Only Insurance Companies and
Banks have been building of late.
People insure for their future and
their offspring’s future, and use the
banks as security for their hoard,
that should long since have gone into
property, but will never go unless
these restraining influences are re-
pealed in our laws —the worst of
which is that one can never get a
tenant, no matter how undesirable,
out of one’s property. These laws
are as a canker eating into people’s
hearts and crippling their future, as
well as the future of Australia.
The quicker corrective legislation
can be framed to undo the utter folly,
the sooner will we get back to a
“full steam ahead’’ condition of hous-
ing our people naturally.

DEATH OF COLONEL SPAIN
OUTSTANDING PERSONALITY PASSES.
The death of Colonel Alfred Spain,
on August 9th at the splendid age of
86, removes an outstanding personality
from the Australian scene. He was
one of those indomitable characters
who appear to succeed at everything
they undertake, and during his long
life he had achieved distinction as an
architect, soldier and administrator,
while he had always been active in
busness, being a director of a num'
ber of important organisations.
Col. Spain was born at “Warra'
ringa,” Neutral Bay, in 1868, and he
had lived in this Harbour'side district
ever since. After receiving his pre'
liminary education at the Queen’s
School, in 1891 he commenced his
career as an architect and in due time
became a partner in the firm of Rowe,
Campbell and Spain (hitherto Thomas
Rowe and Green), which later became
Thomas Rowe and Spain, and still
later in 1904 Spain and Cosh.
All the partnerships were out'
standing. Mr. Campbell, of Thos,
Rowe, Campbell and Spain, was a
classic architect and had been a great
lecturer in his dav. Amongst the fine
work then erected was Gardener’s
Building, which went through from
York Street to Clarence Street, and
is now the B.G.E. on the Clarence
Street side and Charles Parsons on the
York Street side.
Mr. Campbell died before the days
within most of our living memories,
but the firm continued as Rowe and
Spain with the city’s leading struc'
tures the Sydney Hospital, the
Synagogue, all the arcades, countless
churches and warehouses, Hoffnung’s
Building in Pitt Street where the Post
Office now stands, Elliott Bros, in
O’Connell Street, and all the fire sta'
tions. The good work was continued
after Mr. Rowe’s decease by Spain
and Cosh. They had a lasting con'
nection with their clientele because of
the fine standard of work.
In addition to his architectural
activities, Colonel Spain had a long
military record, and from 1890 to
1920 served with the Australian
Engineers and as Officer Commanding
with field companies in Sydney. Dur'
ing World War I, he organised and
commanded Engineers A.I.F. Rein'
forcements Camp, Paddington, later
seeing service abroad with the A.I.F.
Taronga Park.
One of his best loved activities
was his Presidency of the Taronga
Park Trust, and these beautiful Zoo'
logical Gardens, famed throughout
the world, are, in many respects, liv-
ine memorials to his foresight, archi'
tectural skill and unbounded enthu-
siasm. It was on his suggestion that
the Taronga Park site was selected,
but, even so, it was acquired only
after the usual “battle of the site”
that seems to accompany such
changes, had been fought. Colonel
Spain won the victory.
He relinquished this post in 1941
after manv years’ service. He also
rendered great service as a citizen and
was a Past President to the Royal
Empire Society, Deputy President of
the United Serivces Institution and
was a President of the Town Planning
Association of New South Wales for
a number of years.
In the business world he was Chair'
man of Sydney Ferries until 1951, of
Katoomba and Leura Gas Co. Ltd.,
and a director of Helton Bellbird
Collieries Ltd., Howard Smith Ltd.
and Grenfell Gas Co. Ltd.
He had a lifelong love of the sea,
and his main recreations were yacht'
ing and fishing. He was awarded the
Royal Shipwreck Relief Society’s Sib
ver Medal for gallantry for saving
life in Sydney Harbour.
A Personal Contact.
The Editor of this journal knew
Colonel Spain personally as far back
as 1900, from the time she served her
articles with Edward Skelton Garton
in Vickery’s Chambers in Pitt Street,
now Queensland Insurance Building,
where the then Rowe and Spain had
their practice in the front of the
building, on the fourth floor, all to
themselves. It had a mansard roof
with dormers along the front, and
ample accommodation for the 40
draftsmen who comprised their staff.
The building had originally been
built over a stable, and at the back
there was space enough for horses to
prance. Coincidentally, it was in the
caretaker’s quarters that had been
turned into a printery, that Building
Publishing Company printed its
monthly publications, from October,
1907, until 1912 —in the heart of
all the architectural, building and
engineering activity.
A lifedong friendship developed
with Colonel Spain between both
George and Florence Taylor.
The quality that most people will
remember him by is his brilliant
mastery of his subjects. He seemed
to know everything in a very intimate
way about everybody who did things
worth while. Conversation was always
lively. Extra to this, she remembers
him for his largeness of soul, his love
of animals and birds, and above ell
the arts, including poetry (in which
she, too, had always delved). He
could supply and quote poetry for
every occasion.
In July. 1924, it was her privilege
to be the representative of the Insti-
tute of Architects of N.S.W., together
with Sir John Sulman and Colonel
Alfred Spain, when the R.1.8.A.
held an Architects’ Convention at
Oxford University. The influence and
the lovely memory that these two
gentlemen left upon her she regards
as one of the most cherished pos'
sessions of life.
Sir John Sulman died in August,
1934, and Colonel Spain on August
9, 1954.
If one endeavoured to plan a life
of service and achievement it would
be difficult to find a more complete
pattern than that of Colonel Spain.
Danner, nrecise, optimistic and full
of the will to do things, his presence
in Sydney will indeed be greatly
missed.
THE LATE COLONEL ALFRED SPAIN.
LARGEST STEAM PLANT
IN THE WORLD.
The Tennessee Valley Authority's Kings-
ton Plant on Watts Bar Lake is the
largest steam project in the world. The
first unit of the 213 million dollar
(£A.94,700,000) was placed in commer-
cial operation in February, 1954, with
a capacity of 150 M.W. Eventually the
power station will have a rated capacity
of 1440 M.W., and will burn 4,000,000
tons of coal a year.

ON PROFESSIONAL PRESTIGE
By FLORENCE M. TAYLOR.
Recently, a visitor, speaHng of his
business organisation, said:
“I pay five guineas a year into my
organisation and get nothing from it.”
I don’t know what he expected to
get out of it —maybe diamonds and
gold.
I told him some of the organisations
I belonged to, into which I pay and
have been paying large sums of
money for 30 and 40 years. I never
get anything out of them other than
the prestige they lend to the status of
anyone who has the good fortune to
be qualified to become a member of
those learned or business organisations.
For instance, the Institute of Archi'
tects, the Institution of Engineers,
and the Master Builders’ Associa ion,
in which I have my interests, have
been constantly safeguarding the in'
terests of Architects, Builders, and
Engineers, since they were formed for
that express purpose. No one can call
himself an Architect, an Engineer, or
a Master Builder unless he is one.
Everyone in our day paying fees
into these organisations should regard
them, not so much from the money
point of view for the current year,
but should take into consideration the
40 to 80 years of strenuous endeavour
on the part of past councils of these
organisa.ions who built up the status
and have exercised their discretion
so that we may enjoy the privileges
they have made available for us.
Even then, we are not contributing
for ourselves alone. (Many people
look at it selfishly in that way). We
are all helping the foundation to carry
through its good work so that those
who may come after us will enjoy the
fruits of the labours of our forebears.
We are insisting on certain standards
of technical education, of merits, of
honour and genial relationships, so
that no one will lessen the status of
the organisations to which it is their
privilege to belong.
The greatest prestige that can be
bestowed upon a person is to be able
to say “I am a member of the Insti'
tute of Architects, the Institution of
Engineers, the Master Builders’ As'
sociation . . .” as the case may be.
For instance I am a woman writer,
and belong to the Woman Writers’
Association, and though it is a rela'
tively poor organisation it does some'
thing for i.s old and retired members
who could do with a little of life’s
comforts-—a noble work, more of a
fraternity than a charity.
Yet I would not be permitted to
enter even that comparatively lowly
organisation had I not been a woman
writer. I would not be permitted to
be a member of the Institute of Jour'
nalists were I not an editor. The same
with the Architects, the Structural
Engineers, the Society of Engineers
(of which I am a Civil Member).
These are all from a professional
point of view.
From a business point of view, I
belong to the Master Printers’ As'
sociation, the Chamber of Commerce,
the Employers’ Federation, and other
organisations. To all outward show'
inw I get no benefit from all these
organisations though I pay what
might be regarded as fabulous
amounts.
At the same time, one can , rest
one’s head on one’s pillow with the
realisation that one’s interests are be-
ing collectively looked after, and the
officials at the helm are competent
men able to steer the ship to which
they have set their hands over the
troublous seas into safe channels.
They battle for their members in a
court of law or take whatever collec'
tive action may be necessary in every
direction.
One would feel a craven soul indeed
if one did not link up with the orga'
nisations established for one’s benefit
and “pull one’s weight’’ in terms of
a few guineas subscription a year to
those who are fighting our battle for
us and placing us upon higher planes
of recognition.
One must be qualified to join any
of these associations. My latest orga'
nisation was in the nature of an horn
our, when I was admitted to the Royal
Society of Arts. This organisation
puts an imprimatur upon one’s charac'
ter rather than gives a recognition to
a professional status, as would profes-
sional organisations. It just indicates
that one has done something to pro'
gress one’s country or its develop'
ments. Self'interests have nothing to
do with an organisation like this. For
this privilege I pay “a tidy cheque”
each year.
The annual fees of the Institute of
Architects, which has been in exist'
ence since 1871, are .£lO/10/' for a

HOTEL NORMANDIE, LE HAVRE.
This famous hotel, which commands a magnificent view of Le Havre waterfront,
was completed in 1951. It is very popular with passengers in transit to the U.S.A.,
and provides every modern convenience for its guests. This steel-frame, reinforced
concrete, I I-storied hotel occupies a complete block adjacent to overseas shipping
terminals. Though its architecture conforms to the austere post-war style developed
in France when building materials and labour were at a premium, the composition
in the placement of voids and solids introduces a certain amount of charm, which is
further enhanced by the reflecting water. The balcony is disturbing. However, its
interior is spacious and comfortable, with all amenities required by fastidious
travellers.

New Building for Kodak (A’sia) Pty. Ltd.
TO BE ERECTED IN GEORGE STREET.
Demolition has commenced of the
Kodak Building at 379-381 George
Street, Sydney, in preparation for the
construction of a new five-storey build'
ing for Kodak (A/sia) Pty. Ltd.
The old building, which is 60
years old, together with that next
door, which is of the same age, will
be demolished to provide space for
the larger new building. The architect
is Louis S. Robertson, and the build-
ers Hutcherson Bros. Pty. Ltd.
_
lotal floor space of the new build-
mg available for the display and sale
of photographic equipment will be
16,350 sq. ft. In the basement a
photographic gallery and theatrette
will be incorporated,
Kodak s association with this site
commenced nearly 60 years ago, when
t “ e Photographic partnership began in
1891 at Pastoral Chambers at 375
George Street. In 1906 the partner-
shiP became sole distributors in Aus-
tralia for Kodak, and two years later
amalgamated with Kodak. In 1907 the
new company bought the adjoining
property at 379 George Street.
Sulman Award To
National University
Tribute to University House,
Canberra.
The Sir John Sulman Award for
1953 has been awarded to University
House, one of the first units of the
National University at Canberra, for
which the Architect was Professes
Brian Lewis, of Melbourne.
It is only of recent years that me
Australian Capital Territory has been
included with New South Wales as
far as the award of the Sulman Medal
is concerned.
University House, which is the so-
cial centre of the National University,
was formally opened by the Duke of
Edinburgh on February 16 last. It
provides residential and communal
quarters for 130 resident graduate
students and staff, the principal resi-
dential sections being three storeys
high built around a three-sided court-
yard, with a curved single-storey sec-
tion connecting the east and west
wings.
The spacious public rooms are com-
parable with those of a modern hotel;
the Refectory is perhaps the most
striking, being 80ft. long, 33ft. wide
and three floors in height, the ceiling
following the rake of the roof.
The building was supervised by the
Department of Works, the builders
being Howie, Moffatt 6? Co., of
Sydney.
NEW THEATRE LIGHTING.
A series of sunken spotlights from both ceiling and walls, with a special concen-
tration where these meet, is a feature of the lighting of this recent German picture
theatre. The interior is drastically plain, being devoid of any type of decoration
whatsoever.
BUILT-IN SHRUBBERY.

Building Research in Australia
ADDRESS TO BUILDERS.
On Wednesday, August 4, a talk
on “Building Research in Australia”
was g/ven at the Australian Gas Light
Co.’s Auditorium. Burwood, to an in'
terested audience of builders.
The speaker, Mr. Eric H. J.
Ziebell, A.R.A.1.A., Senior Architect
of the Building Research Liaison Ser'
vice, Commonwealth Department of
Works, illustrated his talk with
coloured slides and films. The follow'
ing organisations had contributed to
the work:
Commonwealth Experimental Build'
ing Station, Department of Works,
North Ryde, N.S.W.
Division of Building Research,
C.5.1.R.0., Highett, Victoria.
Division of Forest Products,
C.5.1.R.0., South Melbourne.
Division of Soils, C.5.1.R.0.,
Adelaide.
Industrial Services Division, Depart'
ment of Labour and National Service,
Melbourne.
Defence Standards Laboratory,
Department of Supply, Maribyrnong
(Victoria) and Villawood (N.S.W.).
On the Advisory Committee of
were active members, including Mr.
S. D. C. Kennedy, Master Builder, of
Sydney.
Although research is accepted as an
essential activity in industry, it is not
so regarded within the building in'
dustry. This is all the more surpris-
ing, considering the major importance
of our industry to the National
Economy.
The research scientist has special
training and experience in scientific
investigation, and has a great deal of
highly accurate apparatus at his dis'
posal. However, in examining any
problem, he needs the practical know'
ledge and field experience of the
builder, and cooperation between the
two is often essential for a satisfac'
tory solution.
Mr. Ziebell then took the meeting
on a conducted tour of three of the
major research establishments by
means of a series of coloured trans'
parencies depicting research work in
progress. Among the subjects of par'
ticular interest referred to in the slides
and in the films shown were the
following:
Pre-stressed Concrete.
The principle of pre'stressing is so
to the concrete that when it
is under load there will be no tension
in the concrete ©r the tension will be
too small to produce cracks. Pre'
stressing can be used for many forms
of structure and component. In each
case the designer calculates how much
pre'stress is required to balance the
tension which will be induced when
the member is in use.
Steel, generally in the form of
cold drawn wires or bars of very high
tensile strength, is commonly used for
nre'stressing, which may be done in
one of two forms known as pre-
tensioning when the wires are
stretched before the concrete is set
around them and the tension then
released or post'tensioning—in which
the wires are tensioned, compressing
the alreadv'hardened concrete.
To illustrate the saving in concrete
and steel, the speaker compared two
concrete beams, one pre'stressed and
the other reinforced with ordinarv
mild steel—both designed for the
same work. The former, 14in. x 9in.,
weighs 1281 b. per foot run and has
high tensile steel weighing 2.78 lb.
per foot run: the latter, 18in. x llin.,
weighs 205 lb. per foot run, and has
10 lb. of mild s'eel per foot run.
The Commonwealth Experimental
Building Station was the first authority
in Australia to study the technique of
pre'stressing, and has since given
valuable assistance in the practical de'
velopment of this method by private
industry and by State public utilities.
The audience was shown an excellent
colour film taken by the Sydney
Water Board, describing the erection
of a pre'stressed concrete refrigeration
tower at the Warragamba Dam,
N.S.W.
Spread of Flame and Fire
Rating.
The Experimental Building Station
includes a, fire'testing laboratory in
which is installed equipment for
measuring the fire resistance and rates
of spread of flame of building mate'
rials and various types of construe'
tion.
Investigations in the fire'testing
laboratory are being directed towards
establishing standard fire ratings for
materials and types of construction
used in Australia. These ratings will
then be a reliable guide for the fraim
ing of building regulations, and it is
believed can result in substantial
economies in building costs.
Bloated Clay Aggregate.
Some clays and shales when heated
to a sufficiently high temperature ex'
pand or bloat, forming a lightweight
material which, when used as an
aggregate, produces concrete with
only 60 per cent, to 80 per cent, the
weight of dense concrete.
The use of this lightweight con'
crete in a building makes possible an
appreciable reduction in the dead
load. The shrinkage and compressive
strength are in the range usually con'
sidered satisfactory for ordinary
purposes.
Suitable material for expanding is
found in the Eastern States of
Australia.
The 'aggregate can be made in a
range of sizes from less than fin. for
fine aggregate up to fin. for coarse
aggregate.
Research on this material is being
done by C.5.1.R.0. at Highett.
Timber Trusses.
The Commonwealth Experimental
Building Station has designed and
tested a range of lightweight hard'
wood timber roof trusses suitable for
use on domestic buildings. Since they
Were first introduced early in 1949,
hundreds of trusses have been made
and successfully used in the Southern
States of Australia.
The C.E.B.S. designs include
trusses for clear spans of 16. 20, 24,
and 28 feet, and a truss spacing of
3ft. is adequate for a tiled roof and
of up to 4ft. 6in. spacing for a sheet'
ed roof. Roofs constructed in this
way show savings of up to 40 per
cent, in the roof timbers, and also
require less skilled labour for making
and erection than is needed for set'
ting out, cutting and erecting the
usual type of roof framing. The
trusses are most suitable for use with
the gable'ended roofs over rectangu'
lar buildings.
GLASS IN ARCHITECTURE.
During the last 25 years the use of glass
as an architectural material has been
developed with the production of new
techniques and tougher compositions.
Here is shown the northern facade of
United Nations Headquarters in New
York, where more than 6500 square feet
of translucent photo-sensitive glass
panels, in colour and texture of Ver-
mouth Marble, are used.

BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


The use of trusses also simplifies
site organisation, as the roof can be
completed as soon as the external
walls are built, and the complete floor
can be laid immediately afterwards,
providing an area in which the re-
maining work can be carried out
under cover in wet weather without
loss of time.
As the internal partitions are not
needed to support the roof, they can
be non-load-bearing construction built
on the floor.
Designs for both nailed and riveted
trusses are included in Technical
Study No. 29.
Perlite and Vermiculite.
Perlite obtained by subjecting a
volcanic glass, obsidian, mined in
Southern Queensland and Northern
N.S.W., to very high temperatures
after crushing it. Under these condi-
tions it expands very many times its
original volume, and Vermiculite, a
mica-like mineral rained in Western
Australia and similarly treated, both
provide very lightweight materials for
sound and thermal insulation, and
Perlite mixed with gypsum results in
an excellent lightweight plaster with
excellent fire-resisting properties.
The speaker drew the attention of
the meeting to the wide range of pub-
lications which were available from
the Liaison Service on various aspects
of building research, and invited
builders also to make use of the in-
formation service.
ancient buildings and churches are
unanimous in the view that ivy should
not be allowed to grow on walls. In
buildings not under constant super-
vision and where the condition of the
walls is such that penetration of roots
can occur, the ivy should unquestion-
ably be removed. Where the joints
are thoroughly sound and there are
no cracks or fissures, there is less
reason for its removal but every reason
for watchfulness. If it is impossible
to make regular inspections the safer
plan is to destroy the ivy. A length
of the main stem should be cut out,
preferably near ground level. When
the stems have dried and shrunk, and
not until then, the ivy should be
pulled from the wall. To prevent
further growth the roots should be
dug up.
Virginian Creeper.
The small-leaved Veitch’s Virginian
creeper (Vitis inconstans) attaches it-
self to walls by means of suckers.
When the creeper is removed these
are often left adhering to the wall
without any sign of their having
caused damage. While there may be
some need for caution when the brick,
stone or mortar is soft and friable,
Virginian creeper can be considered
harmless to the surface of walls that
are in a reasonably good state of re*
pair. Plants such as climbing roses,
jasmine, honeysuckle, etc., that have
to be supported on wires or trellis or
held by nails do not themselves
damage brick, stone or concrete walls
if kept under control. The fixings
may, however, cause damage; nails
should be galvanised at least, but nails
of zinc, copper or yellow metal can
be used with advantage; fixing plugs
should be of timber pressure impreg-
nated with a preservative or of one of
the proprietary cement-asbestos com-
pounds.
All the climbing plants discussed
can do serious damage by dislodging
tiles or slates or by blocking gutters
and downpipes. They should always
be kept trimmed to well below eaves
or gutter level and clear of window
and door frames.
The drying action of the roots of
vigorous shrubs and creepers on
shrinkable clay soils is a factor to be
considered.
CLIMBING PLANTS ON WALLS.
Precautions to be Taken.
The British Building Research Sta-
tion in recent notes says that it is
sometimes asked Whether it is wise to
allow climbing and other plants to
grow on walls. There is no simple
answer to this question. Much de-
pends on the type of plant, on the
condition of the walls and on how
much supervision can be exercised to
keen the growth under control.
Each case must be decided on its
merits, balancing the effect on the ap-
pearance of 'he building against the
need for supervision and the risk of
causing damage.
Ivy Serious Menace.
Ivy is potentially a very serious
menace. It forms aerial roots which,
if they secure a foothold in cracks or
in open joints, will inevitably cause
damage and can, in time, disrupt the
wall. As it is difficult and may be
impossible to determine when this
penetration is starting and because
continued uncontrolled growth can
cause such serious damage, those con-
cerned with the preservation of

bond of friendship. It shows the continued effort to produce understanding in a
shaky world.

Country members pay £B/8/' and no

The Metal Trades Association
charges an entrance fee of £10; its
turnover subscription is based on the
number of employees under various
awards, and these are paid quarterly
at 3/6d. per employee. The minimum
amount for a staff of 10 or under is
£l/15/' a quarter, or when this goes
up to £5OO per quarter a reduction
to 3d. per employee per quarter is
accepted.
Passing of a Leading
Queensland Engineer
Mr. Edward S. Cornwall.
The electrical world in Queensland
suffered a great loss in the death of
Mr. Edward Satchwell Cornwall, one
of its most outstanding engineer-
administrators, early in July, at the
age of 66 years. He left to the care
of his successors the Southern Elec-
tricity Authority, whose authorised
capital now exceeds £2O million.
Although not a native of Queens-
land, Edward Cornwall was such a
young child when, with his father, he
came from Ireland to Mt. Morgan,
that he was virtually a Queenslander,
in his upbringing, his schooling, and
in his training as both a mechanical
and an electrical engineer. Moreover,
he had the training a marine engineer
receives, and without which, other
marine engineers will tell you. an
engineer is—well, just not a complete
engineer.
His father occupied a responsible
position in the great “Mountain of
Gold” —the Mt. Morgan Gold Mining
Co. Ltd.—before the end of last cen-
tury, and Edward got his schooling
in that town, whose population grew
to 15,000 people. From Mt. Morgan,
young Cornwall went out to expand
his experience in mechanical and elec-
trical engineering, and to gain new
experience in marine engineering in
Australian coastal steamers.
Installed First Generating
Plant.
At the age of 26 he came to Bris-
bane, where, as representative of the
firm of Willans and Robinson, he in-
stalled the first alternating current
generating plant for the City Electric
Light Company, known since 1952 as
the Southern Electric Authority of
Queensland. At that time, only 40
years ago, Brisbane was far from ade-
quately served with electric lighting
and power; and in other parts of the
State to an even lesser degree. In
1914 the Company appointed the
young man, Cornwall, its power-
house superintendent.
At later periods he became engineer
for construction, Chief Assistant En-
gineer, Assistant Manager, and Acting-
Manager in 1937, until in 1948 he
was appointed a Director, becoming in
the following year Managing Director
and Chief Engineer, with all the care
and responsibility on his mental and
physical capacity that such a post ob-
viously entailed. That the trust was
not misplaced can be judged from the
great progress the City Electric Light
Co. Ltd. and its successor, S.E.A.,
made, with its magnificent power
houses at Gibson Island, Bulimba, and
Ipswich. The ambition of Mr. Corn-
wall :o bring electric power and light-
ing to the country, was realised in his
lifetime to an extent which represents
a magnificent contribution to the
essential decentralisation of popula-
tion, and the development of real
wealth by electric power.
The franchise of the City Electric
Light Co. (now S.E.A.), originally
confined to the City of Brisbane,
now extends from the border of
N.S.W. and Queensland to Gympie.
There is a limited exclusion in the
areas of Brisbane served by the City
Councils’ electrical undertaking within
the City and suburbs. It was Mr.
Cornwall’s envisaging of the eventual
absolute electrification of South-
Eastern Queensland before the Royal
Commission, that led to the creation
of the State Electricity Commission
in 1937,
If “Electricity is life,” then it may
truly be said that “Like begets like,”
and the spark that Cornwall gave
multiplies throughout South - East
Queensland.
Despite his busy life. Mr. Cornwall
was able to fulfil the office of Presi-
dent of the Electricity Supply Associa-
tion of Australia, with which he was
honoured on two occasions; and he
was a past Chairman of the Institution
of Engineers, Brisbane Division;
while in the non-professional sphere,
he wfas at one time President of the
Johnsonian Club, and also an art
connoisseur. He is survived by his
widow and a daughter of his first
marriage.—F. O. NIXON.
U.S. GAS PROJECT.
The first large publicly-owned natu-
ral gas project in the United States
will be known as South-Eastern Ala-
bama Natural Gas District. It will
include about 20 towns and will be
financed by an issue of tax-free
bonds.
What Is Efficiency?
What is efficiency? It is doing
things, not wishing you could do
them, dreaming about them, or won'
dering if you can do them. It is the
power to learn how to do things by
doing them, as learning to walk by
walking, or learning to sell goods by
selling them.
It is knowing how to apply theory
to practice. It is the trick of turning
defeat into exnerience and using it to
achieve success. It is the ability to
mass one’s personality at any given
time or place; it is skill in quick
mobilisation of one’s resources.
It is making everything that is past
minister to the future. It is the elimi'
nation of the three microbes of weak'
ness —regret, worry, and fear. It is
self-reliance clothed with modesty. It
is persistence plus politeness. It is the
hand of steel in the velvet glove.
Efficiency is alertness, presence of
mind, readiness to adjust one’s self to
the unexpected. It is sacrificing per-
sonal feelings to the will to win. It
is impinging the ego against the
combination of events luck, fate,
custom, and prejudice—until they
give wav. It is massing the me
against the universe.
It is the sum of three quantities—
purpose, practice, and patience. It is
the measure of a man, the real size
of his soul. It is the ability to use
one’s passions, likes, dislikes, habits,
experience, education, mind, body,
and heart —and not be used by these
things.
Efficiency is self-master, concentra-
tion, vision, and common sense. It
is the sum total of all that’s in a
man.

Digest.”

South Australian Activities
The South Australian Government,
faced with the biggest building pro-
gramme in its history, is using every
means to speed current and projected
works. The hospitals programme has
been given top priority. New build-
ing, modernisation, and extension of
existing hospitals to be pushed ahead
this year will finally cost more than
£6,000,000. A major stage in the
hospitals projects will be reached short-
ly when the Queen Elizabeth Hospi-
tal, Woodville, receives its first
patients. The unprecedented scope of
the Government’s building commit-
ments has made so many demands on
the Architect-in-Chief’s Department
that it is negotiating to engage private
architects to help with the work.
The delay in completing important
projects particularly hospitals is
largely due to S.A’s general prosperity,
according to the Works Minister (Mr.
Mclntosh). He says contractors are
flooded with jobs and have trouble
getting enough men and materials.
The Architect-in-Chief’s Department
could have done £700,000 worth of
additional work if contractors had kept
to schedule.
Meanwhile, the delay in hospital
works is angering Adelaide doctors.
In an article in one of Adelaide’s met-
ropolitan newspapers recently, a medi-
cal man said private enterprise should
have been called in long ago to com-
plete outstanding works. The Vice-
President of the S.A. Institute of
Architects (Mr. L. Gregory Brucr) has
offered the State Government the ser-
vices of at least 20 private architects
to help speed the building of urgent-
ly needed hospitals.”
The chronic brick shortage has
caused a first-class building row. S.A.
now produces only half as many bricks
as it did in 1929. The greatest in-
dustrial boom in the State’s history is
being stifled by this brick famine.
The Secretary of the S.A. Bricklayers’
(Jnion (Mr. H. W. Elliott) has called
for a Government investigation of the
position. An Adelaide brick manu-
facturer this month said S.A’s annual
brick production of 60,000,000 a
year was 30,000,000 less than the
maximum output in 1914. He blamed
shortage of labour, poor and insuffi-
cient coal, and poor workmanship.
In Port Pirie, for instance, about
half of the new homes are being built
of Mt. Gambier stone because of the
shortage of bricks. Mt. Gambier stone
costs about £6O to £7O extra. Pw
Pirie builder L. O’Loughlin said this
month that he had gone into brick
production because of the famine, and
his own firm had made about 2,000,000
bricks at Port Pirie in the past three
years. Even this had not been enough.
South Australia —like other States —
is also having its worst steel shortage
since the war, and this also has had a
serious impact on industry. The scar-
city is slowing down the rate of public
and private building. Australian-
produced building materials such as
galvanised iron and water pipes are
almost unobtainable in S.A. The sup-
ply of structural steel sections con-
tinues to fall far short of demand, and
users are showing a greater inclination
to import their requirements from
Britain, as delivery can be thus ob-
tained within three months of placing
an order.
A gradual change in the S.A. Hous-
ing Trust’s traditional building pro-
gramme is likely over the next few
years. Fewer semi-detached rental
homes, and more single-unit homes
will probably be built. The balance
will swing decidedly in favour of home
ownership. This may be particularly
pronounced when the new satellite
town is built at Salisbury. Occupie.,
will probably be encouraged to buy
the new homes. To do this, the Trust
will build a higher percentage of single
units, because of the prejudices in
S.A. against owning attached homes.
The Housing Trust scheme at Salis-
bury North is nearing completion.
The last batch of foundations has been
laid. There will be 1079 homes, 19
shops, medical and dental surgeries,
post office, trading bank, administra-
tion office, and a primary school. The
main trunk lines for water, sewerage,
electric light and telephones are com-
pleted, and tradesmen and technicians
are rapidly installing these services.
Tenders have been called for demo-
litoin of Harvard Chambers in North
Terrace, city, to make way for a new
seven-storey building. This will be
one of the first new structures in North
Terrace for many years. The work
is to be done for Bagot’s Executor
an d Trustee Co. Bagot,
Laybourne-Smith and Irwin are the
architects. The new building will be
steel-framed and fireproof and at least
four floors will be available as office
space. The job will take about 18
months. The front of the new build-
ing will be freestone, with polished
granite for the ground floor.
Cabinet has accepted a tender for
erection of giant treatment tanks at
the Port Pirie uranium plant. Success-
ful contractor is the Perry Engineering
Co. Ltd. The tanks will be prefab-
ricated in Adelaide and erected at
Port Pirie at a cost of more than
.£70,000. This is the last major job in
construction of the plant and will be
completed by December. Cabinet has
also approved the building of an
£11,500 office block at the works.
This project is being undertaken by
the Architect-in-Chief’s Department.
Taywoth Tiles Ltd., a Rosewater
firm which produces 10.000 roofing
tiles a day, will enter the brick-making
field in November. Foundations have
been laid for the company’s new
Besser Vibrapac concrete blockmaking
machine. Within six months, the
factory is expected to be producing
the equivalent of 50,000 Adelaide
type bricks a day. The firm is already
marketing dry aggregate in bag lots.

More than £500,000 is involved in
plans to build and modernise city
hotels. Work has begun on the
second storey of the new Albion
Hotel, Churchill Road, Kilburn, and
plans for the new Flinders Hotel,
function Road, Rosewater, have reach-
ed the tendering stage. Cost of the
two will be about £130,000. Cost of
modernising 27 present hotels—work
is well under way with most of them—
is about £370,000. Among the most
spectacular jobs is the Largs Pier
Hotel, which will be converted into
one of the most modern hotels in the
Commonwealth. This job alone will
probably cost upwards of £40,000.
Norwood contractor f. Meiers has
started work on foundations for the
new P.M.G. building in Machay Street,
Port Augusta. The structure will be
two-storeyed, and costs are estimated
at £37,000. The building is one of
four modern P.M.G. repeater stations
to be built in country areas. The
others will be at Nuriootpa, Berri and
Balaklava.
McEntee and Williams have the
contract for building a £30,000 dor-
mitory wing on to Wesley College,
Wayville. It will be of brick with
concrete floor and asbestos roof. Pro-
vision has been made for 24 students
in shared bedrooms, with a study
room for each student. There will
also be eight single bed-study rooms.
The building will be orientated to
provide maximum protection from the
sun for bedroom windows. All beds,
wardrobes, dressing tables, desks and
bookshelves will be built in, and there
will be lounges on each floor. The
architect is Gordon C. Brown.
A new warehouse and showroom
for Oliver J. Nilsen 6? Co. Ltd. is near-
ing completion. The building— cost
£6s,ooo—has a two'Storey frontage to
West Terrace in the city, and work
should be finished within two months,
The architects are Messrs. Woods,
Bagot, Laybourne-Smith and Irwin.
War Memorial cloisters, to cost
more than £20,000, will be built in
the big quadrangle at St. Peter’s Col-

The Governor (Sir Robert George)
this month officially opened the
£10,000,000 Port Augusta Power
Station. Mines Department surveyors
are already testing the site for a big-
ger station, to cost £20,000,000, which
will be completed in 1962. The
operation of the first unit is the cul-
mination of seven years of planning
by the Electricity Trust. By touching
a button, the Governor gave the sig-
nal for 10,000 kW of power to surge
down 200 miles of transmission line
to Adelaide homes and factories.
With the exception of the Snowy
River scheme, the station is the fur-
thest fro» its load centre of any in
Australia.
Of the £240,239 Government grant
to seafront councils for storm damage
repairs, £12,033 remained unspent at
June 30 —the deadline fixed by the
Government for the completion of re-
pairs. A statement issued by the
Premier (Mr. Playford) indicated that
councils went on a spending spree in
the last week of the financial year to
get as much work done as possible.
Councils had been told that unspent
funds would revert to the Govern-
ment.
The third congress of the Australian
Planning Institute was opened in Ade-
laide on August 10 by the Premier
(Mr. Playford). A feature of the
congress was the exhibition of a large-
scale model, prepared in connection
with the master plan for the Mel-
bourne metropolitan area. The model,
which showed the growth of Mel-
bourne and the need for planning
there, covered an area 150 feet by
80 feet. Against this background,
Adelaide architects are applauding the
recent move announced by the Premier
to appoint an expe-t town planning
committee for Adelaide.
The new West Beach airport is ex-
pected to be opened for commercial

still to be erected include the main
passenger terminal, transmitter and re-
ceiver buildings for radio - communica-

pany personnel and facilities. Tht
main passenger terminal will cost from
£ 150,000 to £200,000. eTnders have
closed for concrete piling on the pro-
posed site. The terminal, a two-
storey building, will probably take
more tha na year to complete. Archi-

Sydney’s Shopping Zone.
While this remarkable develonment

three zones. The shopping zone,
from the rear of Martin Place to Goul-
burn Street, will comprise buildings

any possibility of sane, sensible off-

ject, and ‘hose of other equally pro-
grescive overseas cities.
shopping burdens of women
to-day are heavy enough without
adding to them by crowded streets
and traffic congestion, as Sydney zon-
ing must inevitably bring.
Altho.ugh the authorities don’t ap-
pear to realise it, the patience of the
womenfolk is being strained to
breaking point, and they will begin
thinking in terms of scalping our
stubborn, short-sighted politicos.
What is being done to Sydney to-
day is being done without the slight-
est regard or consideraTon of the

PROPOSED BOSTON (U.S.) COMMERCIAL CENTRE.
The proposed Commercial Centre, designed by leading U.S. architects for Boston
(Massachusetts), estimated to cost 75.000.000 dollars (£A.33,450.000), is a civic
concept of great magnitude and boldness. It will be far ahead of any compar-
able scheme in the world. The Centre will comprise a Municipal Auditorium
(right of model), a motel (for car travellers), a huge hotel, shopping centre, office
blocks, underground railway station (for Boston's subway system), car-parking for
6,000 cars, and special garage facilities for motel guests. The planners estimate
that the Commercial Centre will offer cultural, business, and tourist amenities for
some 70,000 people. The fenestration is decidedly modern, making nice contrasts.
The buildings are all on stilts—a requirement for accessibility in future buildings.
The following architects collaborated in designing the Centre: Prof. Walter Gropius,
Jean Bodman Fletcher, Norman C. Fletcher, John C. Harkness, Sarah Harkness,
Robert C. McMillan, Louis A. McMillan, and Benjamin Thompson.

AMIANDOS ASBESTOS.
A Flourishing Cyprus Industry.
Although “Salamander Skin,” as
the ancients called asbestos, has been
used for centuries by Chinese,
Siberians, Italians and others, the
flourishing industry built up at
Amiandos, in the British Colony of
Cyprus, is barely fifty years old.
Despite its relative youth, however,
the Cyprus Asbestos Mines Ltd., as
the company is named, supplies quan-
tities of this valuable commodity to
fifteen countries, as far apart as
Britain and Japan, Argentina and
Siam.
At Amiandos. the latest equipment
is used for the open-cast quarrying of
asbestos-bearing rock. The work goes
on day and night; but only during dry
weather. (Asbestos does not mill
properly if it is damp.) By auction,
primary mills extract the asbestos fibre
from the stone and pass it on to the
finishing mill, where it is dusted and
graded into various lengths. Auto-
matic machines then weigh and bag
the fibre for despatch overseas.
Mr. Frank Kukula, resident direc-
tor, and Mr. Stanley Holloway, chief
engineer, of the organisation, are re-
sponsible for what is to-day not only
a thriving industry, but also a healthy
and happy community. In spite of
the dusty conditions in which the
work has to be done, there has not
been one case of silicosis—the lung
infection caused by silica dust.
A well-equipped hospital and a fine
health service run by a first-class doc-
tor minister to the needs of the com-
munity. Part of the cost of this ser-
vice is defrayed from the small weekly
contributions of the employees, whose
families also enjoy its benefits. Apart
from medical attention, for instance,
expectant mothers receive a gift of
£5 from the Company when the
happy event takes place.
During the winter, when wet
weather prevents open-cast mining
operations, the permanent staff of he
Company are employed in servicing
the machinery in readiness for the
strenuous days ahead when it will be
called upon to operate round the
clock.

Housing Backlog
“Being Overtaken”
Home-building Is Levelling Out.
The backlog of Australia’s housing
needs was being overtaken at the rate
of 15,iD00 dwellings a year, the Fede-
ral National Development Minister,
Senator Spooner, said last week.
He added that Commonwealth
home'building was tending to level
out at 75,000 dwellings a year.
The number needed to meet the
natural population increase, plus im'
migration, was about 60,000.
[Ed.; 100,000 a year was the esti'
mated requirement at the end of the
War, and we never caught up on that.
Now, migrants are to come in at
107,500 a year and 74,000 marriages
taking place in a year. These figures do
not coincide with Senator Spooner’s.
They just do not add up.}
Warning.
Senator Spooner warned that, de'
spite increased production of building
materials, the demand for skilled
tradesmen was so keen now that in'
creased pressure on the supply of both
was becoming apparent.
Available evidence suggested that
housebuilding had been fairly stable
since the end of 1951.
Owner-builders.
Improved labour and output had
enabled contractors to tender on slight'
ly more favourable terms.
The Minister said there were signs
that the competitive force of the
owner' builder movement might be
easing, especially in N.S.W. and Vic'
toria.
For example, of all dwellings erected
in N.S.W. in 1952 ' 53, 52.9 per cent,
were owner-built, but in the nine
months ended March 31 last the per'
centage was only 43.5.
The average of owner-built homes
over all States was about 40 per cent.
Commonwealth Financing.
The biggest single force of funds
for financing home construction is the
Commonwealth Government, which
has been providing about £70,000,000
a year. The Commonwealth Bank has
also been providing funds at the rate
of £20,000,000 a year.
Funds provided by the Common'
wealth under the Commonwealth-
State Housing Agreement were re'
sponsible for 22 per cent, of all houses
built in Australia last year. Senator
Spooner said.
He added that employment on n*»w
building construction increased by
5400 in the year ended March last,
bringing the total to 104 500. bm ; t
was still under the record total of
126,000 in September. 1951.
BRISBANE BUILDINGS CHANGE HANDS
“CITY BUILDINGS” BRINGS £200,000.
In one day, recently, three Brisbane
city properties were sold for the respec'
tive sums of £200,000, £50,000, and
£45,000.
The first mentioned sale, for
£200,000, was of the corner block
of Adelaide and Edward Streets
known as “The City Buildings,” built
about 60 years ago.
It can be regarded as equal, or
almost equal, in value, to the best
corner business site in the City. The
building of four stories and base-
ment, has a frontage to the S. eWstern
side of Adelaide Street of 91 feet, and
to the North Eastern side of Edward
Street of feet. The ground floor
is occupied by shops, and a large
office; and the three upper floors by
offices, showrooms, and the Omnium
Gatherum of the average city letting
premises. The building is much too
good to demolish, especially as a new
structure to justify the site would prob'
ably cost at least a million pounds.
The new owners are Edments Hold'
ings, Ltd., retailers, but the occupancy
by the new owners will not disturb
any tenants other than some of the
tenants of shops on the ground floor.
This will be to provide shopping
premises for Prouds, the well-known
Sydney jewellers, their first shopping
centre in Brisbane. Elaborate shop
premises in Queen Street are already
in occupation by Edments Ltd.
Speaking generally, the outlay upon
the acquisition of such a building as
the one here pictured, if for letting
purposes, opens up a problem that is
not now unusual by any means. Build'
to the maximum permissable height,
say 10 or 11 stories, entails no more
land tax or municipal rating, than if
the land were used for a building of
fewer stories. If the foundations of
such a building, as this four'Storied one
—which is unlikely, though not im'
possible—and the walls are as strong as
they appear to be, a a great deal of
money could be saved if demolition
of the City buildings was found to be
avoidable. The moral is, that the ex'
penditure of money upon foundations
to carry a new maximum-height struc'
ture, even though temporarily carrying
fewer stories, is good business sense.
It is quite probable, that when this
60'years'old structure was built, the
cost would have not been more than
one'eighth of the cost of a similar
building at the present juncture, so
that if its demolition became impera'
tive, the problem to be faced is most
important, as many others of a similar
nature in the upward trend of city
building become.
The barricading to the left of the
picture is around the smaller site upon
which the Producers & Citizens In'
surance Co, Ltd. has begun its
in inflamable liquid containers and on
£300,000 new office building.—F.O.N.
MEDICAL RESEARCH BUILDING.
At Washington, D.C., a large Army
medical research building has been
built without windows or external
openings, to provide protection
against blast and radiation from
atomic bombs. Covering 206 ft. by
102 ft., it has five storeys above ground

ficial lighting, airdock and blast-proof

vices—laboratories, hospitals., studios,

Diverting Niagara Falls to Develop New Hydro-Electric Power
By PERCY A. ROWE.
Ontario, the most prosperous and
most industrialised of Canada’s prov*
inces, owes much to Niagara Falls, the
majestic 325 ft. cataract between Lakes
Erie and Ontario. It attracts tourists
from all over the world and, at the
same time, it is the province’s most
important source of hydro-electric
power. In the past 30 years, three
large generating stations have been
built on the Canadian side of the
Falls capable of producing 845,000
horsepower. They include the mas-
sive 525,000 h.p. Sir Adam Beck —-
Niagara No. 1 station, which was the
greatest single power development in
the world at the time of its construe-
tion. Yet this will be dwarfed by a
neighbouring generating station cap-
able of producing 1,200,000 h.p. when
a major engineering project, now un-
der way, is completed.
In normal rainfall, about 200,000
cubic feet of water slides over Niagara
Falls every second. Even with the
development of power stations men-
tioned above, (and others on the
American side of the falls), there is
still a lot of energy running to waste.
Yet there has been a growing demand
for electricity in Ontario since the
war; in December, 1951, the Ontario
Hydro Commission's peak demand
reached 4,111,294 h.p., which was 65
per cent, higher than in December,
1945; its customers jumped from
864,805 to 1,249,366 in the six-year
period. Finally, when a rationing sys-
tern had to be introduced a few wint-
ers ago because demand was outstrip'
ping supply, the hydro commission
began planning further utilization of
Niagara Falls’ water resources, the
province’s last source of cheap energy.
But before construction could be-
gin the American Congress had to
ratify a U.S.A.-Canada treaty permit-
ting diversion of additional water
equally by both countries for power
generation. After engineering studies
had been made, it was found that
cutting the flow from 200,000 to
100,000 cubic feet per second over
the Falls would have negligible effect
on the beauty of the drop. And so
the treaty provides that during day-
time hours in the tourist season, the
flow will be 100,000 c.f.s., and that
at night, and during the spring, late
autumn, and winter, the flow shall be
50,000 c.f.s. This treaty was signed
in October, 1950. Early in 1951, the
Canadian project, which will cost
$300,000,000 (£A. 133,000,000) be-
fore completed in 1957, and which is
already employing 5,000 men, was
started.
The plan evolved is to divert
water from the Falls at two intakes
immediately above the cataract, con-
vey it beneath the city of Niagara
Falls by twin tunnels 5-? miles long,
emptying into a 25-mile-long canal,
which will take the water to the fore-
on the side of a 300 ft. cliff, and fust
upstream from the Sir Adam Beck-Ni-
agara No. 1 station. The new gener'
ating station will finally consist of 12
units. The first four, developing
bay of the generating station. Thfi>
will be built six miles below the Falls
400,000 h.p. wiF be in service by late
1954; another 300,000 h.p. will come
into service in 1955, and the remain-
ing five units (500,000 h.p.) during
1956 and 1957.
The Ontario Hydro Commission
decided to carry out this plan alone,
except for the tunnelling. Owing
to a lack of experience in tunnel driv-
ing of the magnitude required—the
two tunnels under construction will be
among the world’s largest—it was
agreed contracts should be let for bor-
ing. But all the planning was car-
ried out by the Commission’s staff.
A huge model of the geophysical
factors of the area played no unim-
portant part in attaining a design for
the projected development. This was
used to determine the best locations
for intakes, among other problems,
and it has been claimed that this
model alone saved the Commission
$1,500,000 (iA.666,000) in con-
struction costs. Showing a four-mile
section of the Niagara River, it had a
horizontal scale of 250 feet to one
foot, and a vertical scale of 50 ft. to
one foot. It was 95 ft. long, 37 ft.
wide, and four ft. high when com-
Gouged out ditches for penstocks that will lead to the new generating station at the toot are seen clearly
alongside the Sir Adam Beck No. I station.

pleted. Shore lines and river bed
contours had to be carefully moulded
in detail, but no correct chart had
ever been obtained of channels either
above the Falls or in the river forge
immediately below it, because no boat
had ever been able to enter the surg'
ing torrent. So a supersonic device
had to be introduced to plot the area
for the first time by use of reflected
sound waves, while below the Falls
plotting was obtained by lowering a
sounding weight from a helicopter.
With the ratification of the U.S.'
Canada treaty, and the finalisation of
plans, Ontario Hydro was able to
construct three camps to house the
workers employed on the project.
Each of these has its own fire protec'
tion, 32'bed hospital, and dining and
recreation halls.
Tenders were then called for the
building of the two tunnels and com
tracts awarded to RayneuAtlas Co.
Ltd., of Toronto, and Perini-Walsh
and Canadian ' American Contractors
Ltd., a joint concern. These con'
tractors have to bore two tunnels
H miles long ahrough rock, each tun'
nel having an unfinished diameter of
51 feet, which will be reduced to 45
ft. when a concrete lining has been
applied. The tunnels will carry
21,600,000,000 gallons of water a day
to the generating station. By com'
parison, the four diversion tunnels at
the U.S.A.’s Boulder Dam has a
slightly larger diameter but are only
16.000 ft. long.
The 7,500,000 gallons of water a
minute entering each of the Niagara
tunnels will enter through two 500
ft. intake tubes and drop 290 ft.,
after which the water will be under
pressure to regain its own level when
the tunnels emerge at the canal sec'
tion south of the city of Niagara
Falls.
Today, with construction work hav'
ing progressed steadily for nearly two
years, the line of the tunnels can be
clearly seen by headframes of five
entrance shafts rising to 125 ft. and
each weighing 250 tons. The greatest
depth of the tunnels below ground
surface is 330 ft. and they rise gradm
ally to 207 ft. below ground level be'
fore beginning a comparatively sharp
30 degree slope to emerge in the open
canal. Location at this depth has been
made to take advantage of a stratum
of iron deposit limestone, averaging
10 ft. in thickness, to provide an ade'
quate roofing.
In the construction of tunnels and
vertical shafts carried out to date the
methods of the two contractors have
differed. In digging the entrance
shafts, the Perini crews first excavated
a cone'shaped hole to a depth of 20
ft. in the overburden. They then
drove a ring of steel sheet piling
down to rock. Inside this they plac'
ed a cylinder of concrete. When the
rock was blasted and mucked out down
to the tunnel level, concrete rings
were placed at intervals of 6 ft. In
their shaft construction RayneuAtlas
Company used the concrete caisson
Continued overleaf.

dam has been built while draft
tubes are laid below the level of
the Niagara River for the new

method, the caisson being built down
to rock by adding more and more
concrete. After blasting out rock,
the shaft was heavily timbered to
tunnel level. It should be noted that
as the tunnels run parallel to each
other in close proximity, the shafts
have been offset to provide large
working chambers from which excava-
tion of both tunnels began at the
same time.
Perini Walsh and their associates
are employing the “heading and
bench” method of tunnelling, com-
pleting excavation of the top half of
the tunnels from flat working plat-
forms, 51 ft. in width, before exca-
vation of the bottom half of the
circle begins. The Rayner-Atlas Com-
pany is taking out about nine-tenths
of the circle in a continuing opera-
tion. Protection to crews is provided
by 8 in. steel “I” beam arches with
channel lagging. These are placed
4 feet apart.
Before the tunnel boring is com-
pleted late this year 9,923,000 tons
of rock will have been excavated and
43,000 tons of steel used for the “I”
beams. Then begins the task of ap-
plying a 3 ft. thick concrete lining,
calling for 954,800 cubic yards of
concrete, which will be provided from
two huge mixing plants operated ’by
the Hydro Commission near the tun-
nels. It will be sent down to the
tunnels through 8 in. holes drilled
from the surface along the centre
lines of the tunnels.
Much of the drilling is being carried
out with drifter drills, a dozen of
which can operate from platforms of
Jumbo mountings, huge frames which
can be moved on either skids or
wheels. Electrically-operated shovels,
equipped with 3i cubic yard buckets,
some of which units weigh 65 tons,
are being used for mucking-out. This
machinery had to be lowered down
the shafts in sections and reassembled
in the cross-cuts. A constant stream
of diesel trucks carry the excavated
material to hoppers located in vertical
extensions of the shafts sunk to a
depth of 65 ft. below the crosscut
floor, which acts as a storage area.
It is eventually fed into 15-ton cap-
acity skips which take it to the sur-
face, and thence to four large dis-
persal areas.
While work continues on the tun-
nels, the Ontario Hydro’s own forces
are excavating the canal
leading to the generating station,
which is being cut 200 ft. wide and
70 ft. deep. Most of the material be-
ing excavated is limestone, shale, and
dolomite. Wagon drills are employed
for all close drilling and electrically-
operated rotary-type rigs for deeper
holes required for blasting. In ad-
dition, newly-designed percussion-type
drilling rigs, known as Quarrymasters,
are being used where a good vertical
line at the sides of the cut is neces-
sary —the canal will be unlined. The
blast holes are loaded with 60 per
cent, and 40 per cent, gelatin cart-
ridges and fired with milli-second de-
lay caps and Primacord. To move
the excavated materials both in the
canal and tunnels, nearly 300 trucks
are in use together with dozens of
scrapers, bulldozers and shovels rang-
ing from half-yard to 6 cubic yard
machines.
Finally, at the generating station
site itself on the cliff face overlooking
the Niagara River, work is also well
under way. Here, more than 1,250,000
tons of earth and rock has been blast-
ed and removed to make the deep
gouges necessary for the 592 ft.-long
penstocks and to provide space for
the powerhouse at the foot of the
300 ft. escarpment.

INTERESTING NEW BUILDINGS.
We illustrate in this panel a series of interesting buildings that have recently been completed throughout Australia. Details
of the various examples are as follows:—Top left: Striking War Memorial Chapel, George Street. Sydney, for which the
architects were D. T. Morrow & Gordon. Immediately alongside on the right is a view of the Walter and Eliza Hall Insti u e
at the Royal Melbourne Hospital which embraces laboratory and research departments; architects were Stephenson & urner.
Below on the left is the facade of the Hartford Insurance Co. that was recently extensively remodelled, in Margaret street.
Sydney, by architect Douglas B. Snelling. The whole of the lower facade is faced with terracotta in a green tint by un er-
lich Ltd. Bottom right is a new shopping centre at Ringwood, a suburb of Melbourne, for which the architects were Musson
Mackay and Potter. Immediately above are the Sugar Research Laboratories at Mackay, Queensland, for whic e arc iec
was Karl Langer. Architecturally, they all strike a different style from pre-war types.

THE MODERN HOME IS A GAS HOME

COOKING . . . Only gas gives you such even heat at
low cost —quickly controlled at the touch of a tap. Gas
ranges cost much less —are cooler, safer, last longer and
are more dependable. That is why more people in Sydney
cook with gas than any other fuel.
REFRIGERATION . . . Only gas gives you refrigerators
that last a lifetime. They have no motors or moving parts.
This makes them silent, wear free and repair free. Thermo-
static control gives the temperature you wish. Special
reduced rate for gas used.

WINTER WARMTH . . . Only gas gives you controlled
warmth—a cheerful glow that fills the whole room
instantly. A gas fire gives you exact heat . . . turn it up or
down to suit yourself. No work, no worry, and it's so easy
to change to a gas fire.
HOT WATER . . . Only gas gives you hot water all the
time for all the family. You can turn on all the hot taps
in the house at the same time with a gas hot water system
and there will still be hot water to spare. Gas never lets
you down.
EFFICIENCY
is the reason why
GAS COSTS LESS
Gas is the efficient, willing servant in 400,000 Sydney homes. In Bathrooms, Lounges, Kitchens,
Laundries—and in every room where gas can be used—it does a better, cheaper job. Gas gives
you hot water all the time for your bath, shower, shave, dish washing, cleaning and clothes
washing. Gas warms your rooms, does all your cooking, and gives you perfect, trouble-free
refrigeration. The price of gas here is amongst the lowest in the world for manufactured gas.
Despite increased costs in all commodities, your gas company s modem planning and production
methods have kept the price down.

With aluminium, you can forget maintenance expense. Aluminium will never rot,
rust or warp. Under normal conditions of exposure it will never need painting,
but is easily painted if desired. Fire-resistant and vermin-proof, aluminium will
qive you years and years of trouble-free service. Consult your arc iec or
building contractor about aluminium—about aluminium doors, aluminium win-
dows and other aluminium building components—find out what they mean t
your business in terms of long range economy and customer appeal.

QUEENSLAND LETTER
For some obscure reason, the num-
her of building permits issued by the
Brisbane City Council in July—viz.,
683 —is somewhat below the average.
The number of dwellings is, however,
well sustained, both in number and
size, since there were 30 costing over
£3OOO and up to £4QOO; and sixteen
costing over £4OOO and up to £9OOO.
Of these latter, twelve dwellings cost
from £4OOO and up to £6OOO. One
each cost £7OOO. £BOOO, £B5OO, and
£9OOO. Four new sets of flats cost,
respectively, £3500, £5OOO, £7500, and
£9OOO. Two new petrol-service sta-
tions cost £5500 and £9OOO. A newly-
created, up-to-date suburb that was a
farm land twelve miles from the city
a few years ago, is spending no less
than £50,000 on a picture iheatre. In
keeping with the appearance of this
new area, its harsh name of “Service-
ton has been changed to the softer-
sounding aboriginal one of “Inala,”
meaning “peaceful place.”
A new presbytery will cost £4000;
a convent, £5000; for office buildings,
£5190 and £6000; re-building a very
old hotel will take £4000; a fertiliser
works, £10,000; and improvements to
the Brisbane Cricket Ground will cost
£3OOO. One of the chain stores com-
panies—G. J. Coles & Co. Ltd.—is
spending £25,000 on another store in
“The Valley,” demolishing a number
of ancient shops in the operation; the
E.S & A. Bank’s new branch will cost
£11,370; additions to an oil refinery
cost £19,000 (part of a total expends
ture of £500,000); The Cistern
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. is adding a
new building at a cost of £50,000 to
its factory and showrooms at South
Brisbane. Of fifteen other permits for
additions or complete factories and
shops, two will each cost £17,000, and
the other thirteen in sums from £3OOO
to £9856. Of new buildings men-
tioned in previous letters, Hoey Fry
and Coy.’s new brick engineering
works at Spring Hill is growing upon
the site of a number of very old sub'
standard cottages. Brisbane’s City
marginal Spring Hill of many undesir-
able hovels abutting on lower Wick-
ham Terrace, is not incomparable
with the juxtaposition of palatial
Potts Point and less—much less—
palatial Woolloomooloo that old'
timers remember.
Successful Royal Show.
At the Royal National Exhibition
in Brisbane, from August 5 to 14,
exhibits included prefabricated homes
and other buildings of steel and alu-
minium; but the provision of a livable
building, attractive enough in price to
swav the preference from timber or
brick, is yet to come.
An agitation by a few of those
people who cannot leave well alone,
to move this oval and agglomeration
of grandstands and other buildings,
etc,, on which a million pounds must
have been spent in the last 60 years,
further out of the city to some coun-
try site, is dying out. The great
success of the R.N. Association ex-
hibitions is due to its accessibility of a
few minutes from the city by tram or
train. There are many substandard
buildings in the vicipity of show
grounds the resumption of which
would give any additional ground
space required for expansion beyond
its present 50 acres.
In addition to the expenditure of
£50,000 by the Royal National As*
sociation in improvements during the
past twelve months, other permanent
building additions have been made
by some regular exhibitors. One of
these buildings is the twostoried one
erected bv the Tasmanian Potato
Board, claimed to be the most modern
in the world, at a cost of £25,000,
replete with all the latest aids to pre-
paring and dispensing potato chips to
the multitude.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Lennons to Extend.
An eight-storied building to cost
£275,000 is to be built by Lennons
Hotel on, their land fronting Adelaide
Street, which backs then up to their
main building facing George Street.
As another hotel is built on the
corner of Adelaide and George
Streets, the new building, when com-
pleted, will be connected with the
present building at the rear of each
of them.
The new building of bedrooms
with suites and baths will provide
for 450 guests —twice the number ac-
commodated in the parent building.
Simplicity in the design of the ex-
terior is in the contemporary mode
of air - conditioned building, with
windows to admit light, but not air.
With the building industry “rearin'
to get goin’ ” on more and more
housing, for thousands of potential
British migrants, who will come only
when housing awaits them, we are
made aware of the true position in
regard to the scarcity of such build-
ing essentials as bricks, cement, gal-
vanised iron.
To lessen the tragedy of the posi-
tion the controlling governmental
authority, with a flourish of publicity
—intentional—and with a Gilbertian
touch, has declared a reduction of £l
per ton in the selling price of galva-
nised iron. As a seven foot by two
sheet of 26 gauge roofing iron weighs
14 lb., it will be seen that the reduc-
tion in price will be equal to one
penny and a half on each 14 square
feet of roofing iron—if it were ob-
tainable. Meantime, a recent rise in
timber prices adds £5O to the cost of
a 12 square dwelling, and a more re-
cent rise in wages another £5O. The
bill of an uncontrolled jobbing
plumber, for a vague “To work done
and materials supplied £45,” showed,
on analysis, a 50% addition to retail
prices of the materials used, and the
charge for labour an even worse
abrogation of award rates. So much
for the success of “controls,” however
well-intentioned they may be.
“Tragic” Scarcity of Materials.
An important reason given for the
shortage of available materials is
mainly the great needs of several
large hospitals in course of erection
to give relief to the overcrowding in
others. Even timber supplies of our
own production have suffered through
the abnormal rainfalls this year re-
tarding the falling and hauling of log
timber from the forests. With a build-
ing programme in hand which will
call for the spending of more than
£2 million on just seven new major
citv buildings, not including the
hospitals mentioneds, one can guess
the insuperable difficulties that con-
front the general public, and the
almost insuperable difficulties of build-
ers on priorities for supplies which
hardly exist. For example, in galva-
nised iron* John Lysaghts Pty. Ltd.
are reported to be unable to overtake
demand before the end of 1955 or
early in 1956. Some accepted orders
should be filled in twelve months.
When the common man tries to place
an order for roof tiles, he is told to
“forget it.” This also applies to
cement. The trade must provide for
at least a three'months “wait.”
In bricks, the case is just as hope'
less for anyone but builders; even
they must allow for a delay of six
months, despite the fact that one of
the brickmaking companies - the
largest north of Sydney—had been
able to increase its output by an addi-
tional one'third.
The continued activity on the
South Coast Southport to Tweed
Heads —which spent about £3 million
in buildings in the year ended June
30, 1954, is assisted by the fact that
there are local brickworks and timber'
yards whose markets are no doubt cir-
cumscribed within, because of trans-
port charges lo and from this centre.
Shortages of galvanised iron - the
inapt term of galvanised steel —because
of its early rusting depreciation on
roofs and guttering, at the seaside, is
not felt, because it is rarely used
since the advent of cement and tile
roofing. With water reticulation to all
places, the need for rainwater catch-
ment household tanks went out, and
many house-owners dispense with
guttering and allow rainwater to fall
on the absorbent sand that prevails.
The Housing Minister, Mr. HiLon,
has just stated publicly that since the
war ended, and up to April 30 last,
his department has built 11,285
houses. Up to the end of July, an-
other 3305 houses had been complet-
ed, including those nearing comple-
tion. This financial year, the sum of
£3,700,000 will be spent on building
and maintaining dwellings. If there
are added to these the houses built
by War Service Homes Dept, and by
private enterprise, it must be admitted
that the building of homes, in spite
of the multi.ude of disabilities exist'
ing, has not been discreditable.
Oil Exploration Plant.
A ’ modern version of the covered
waggon days has been enacted in the
loading and transportation by 28
units of £500,000 worth of oil'
exploration plant from Brisbane to a
point 720 miles north-west, to “Reids
Dome,” a geologically blessed spot in
the Springsure'Rolleston area, 40
miles south'west of this latter place,
where the elusive oil is to be bored
for. The journey successfully accom'
plished was remarkable, insofar as
some bridges had to be strengthened
and tracks turned into roads at a cost
of £50,000 in order to carry the
heavy drilling equipment of 378 tons
in this caravan. Towards the end of
the trek, it will have passed through
many miles of once-famous sheep sta'
tions which have been abandoned, as
such, because of the multiplicity of
dingoes, and the paucity of station
workers.
At long last, a master road plan
for inclusion in the town plan of
Brisbane has been consummated.
Provision is made for a city of
750,000 people, which is approxi'
mately 50% increase on the popula'
tion of 484,000 in December, 195 3,
The plan provides for the acquisition,
for roads, of certain lands privately
owned, and upon which the City
Council will prevent buildings from
being erected.
Fresh tenders have been called by
the Government for a new railway
bridge over the Brisbane River at
Indooroopilly to accommodate the
suburban electric railway track now
being laid down. This bridge is to
be built between, and in close
proximity to the existing railway
bridge and the privately'owned toll
traffic bridge, the suspension cables of
which were used to hold the arms of
the Sydney Harbour Bridge, until
the connection in the centre did away
with their necessity.
The construction of the twelve'
storied building for the Mutual Life
and Citizens Assurance Co. Ltd. by
K. D. Morris 6? Sons Pty. Ltd. in one
of the busiest parts of the city is the
daily cynosure of the passing multi'
tudes. Excavating at the rate of one
ton a minute 34 feet below the pave'
ment height, has unearthed century'
old stone formations, and since the
cement pouring began, the unusual
rain of early August made it neces'
sarv to pump ou: 30,000 gallons of
water an hour from the foundations.
It is not anticipated that the job will
be delayed over the contracted period.
Continued on page 61.
MODERN ALPINE CHALET DESIGN
This Alpine chalet on Lake du Tignes at
a height of 6270 feet in the French Alps
is designed for maximum comfort and
protection against heavy snow fall. The
balcony is protected from snow cascad-
ing from the root by a large overhang-
ing ledge, also the side walls. The treat-
ment of the design is neat and
characteristic.

The ‘“Westlander” in Service.
The Queensland Railways have put
into service another complete diesel'
powered train called the “West'
lander” to run on the western line
to Cunnamulla. A number of im'
provements have been installed as the
outcome of experience gained since
the previous trains were put on the
rails. These include American'type
bogeys of a shock'absorber design
that reduce the jolting and swaying.
The heavier cork'covered floors have
a stouter linoleum covering; more in'
sulating in the ceilings has reduced
the internal noise to vanishing point.
The striking activity in building in
Brisbane can be truly said to apply
to many cities and country towns
throughout Queensland. There is the
large cement works at Stuart, near
Townsville, with an anticipated out'
put of 60,000 tons of cement a year.
These works to begin operations in
September cost £l million, will give
much relief to the parent company at
Darra, where another million has
been spent within less than a year, so
as to bring its production up to
250,000 tons p.a. The importance of
this relief is emphasised by the fact
that dependent cement'using indus'
tries adjacent to the Darra works are
at the mercy of any development
which may affect its output. The addi'
tional plant will allow for overhaul'
ing that will remove the risk.
About 30 miles north of Bowen, a
new salt works is being established
to increase .the total production at that
port by 10,000 tons of coarse salt
p.a. The new production should begin
by the end of 1955, from which time
onward Queensland should not be de'
pedent on outside sources for any of
its 20,000 tons per annum consump'
tion.
At Mt. Isa, with a population of
8000 people, the finding of rich
uranium deoosits bids to attract many
more people to share the riches. Alto'
gether, there is every reason for the
people to feel buoyant, if anxieties
about the behaviour of other court'
tries would diminish, if not dis'
appear.

OUTDOOR LIVING IN ITALY.
The sun-loving Italians have adapted their post-war architecture to bring their
gardens indoors, as seen in our photo of a modern home. This patio-pergola
features louvres of concrete to produce diverse effects of lights and shadows, while
the rafters overhead are covered with actinic glass. The garden has granite
paths, and tropical shrubs and trees grow in a hot-house atmosphere. The floor
of the living area is finished in highly-polished parquetry, and the modernistic
furniture, including the "clothes-basket" chair on left, matches a unique room.

FOUR INTERESTING DESIGNS.
There is variety in these four designs and plans. Top left has the main front two-storey, the lounge being free-standing
and single-storey with a flat roof, which strangely is not used as a sun deck. The other three are all of one storey only, that
in the top right being rather overpowered by the huge mass of the chimney between the large window areas. The two
bottom houses are not dissimilar in elevational treatment, though the plans vary considerably, that on the right having a
very spacious living room extending from front to rear, while the left plan has a garage attached to the house on one side.

SYDNEY NEWSLETTER
At the end of luly, the N.S.W.
Government announced details of a
“drive” designed to provide more
homes in city and country areas.
Since April, 95 Crown land blocks
have been made available for ballot
in five Sydney suburban areas. A
further 296 blocks, mainly in North
Manly and La Perouse'Malabar areas,
will be also be released for ballot.
The State Treasury has advanced
the N.S.W. Rural Bank £1,000,000
to help people winning ballots to
build homes.
Construction has been commenced
on the first of 100 houses to be built
by the Housing Commission on its
own land for sale through the Rural
Bank.
In country areas, 278 blocks have
been made available far ballot.
As July closed, the eight Suburban
Branches of the M.B.A. held their an'
nual meetings, reported progress dur'
ing 1953'54, and elected new Presi'
dents and Committees for 1954'55.
All reports sounded a note of
optimism for the future, with in'
creased memberships, and a much
keener interest in Master Builders’
affairs evident in all Branches.
The late Mr. Alfred Leslie Rigby,
of the firm of Kell & Rigby Pty. Ltd.,
Master Builders, who died on March
9, aged 65, left an estate of £146,383.
A number of Sydney charities in
which Mr. Rigby took an active in'
terest benefited by generous bequests.
The overall picture of the N.S.W.
building industry at July 31 was one
of increasing activity, With many
tenders being called for all types of
office and commercial buildings, and
dwellings. Commercial buildings under
erection at Wollongong exceed
£1,000,000 in value, while buildings
just completed in Newcastle total
over £1,000,000.

The lifting of controls some time
ago encouraged many firms to plan
new premises, and the good supply of
materials is making the work possible
now.
Sydney metropolitan building is
gathering momentum after a quiet
period, as shown by the totals of ap-
provals issued for new constructions
of all types .
During the past twelve months.
Catholic buildings erected or started
in the Sydney Archdiocese totalled
almost £2,000,000. Both the number
of new buildings including 14
churches and 25 schools —set a new
record in Catholic construction activi-
ties. More than 30 new buildings or
extensions to old buildings are being
devoted to child education. The sav-
ing to the State in this single item
alone is not less than £1,000,000.
The State Government, in early
August, announced that 500 Crown
land building blocks would be made
available for lease. Two hundred and
ninety-six will be in the Sydney metro-
politan area. This, it is expected, will
impart an impetus to the erection of
moderately-priced homes.
More and more large constructions
are being started in the State, mostly
by private enterprise. Schweppes Ltd.
announced a £200,000 building at
Alexandria; the Leagues Club will
spend £50,000 on two additional
floors to its Sydney premises; new
nurses’ quarters at Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital will cost £1,400,000, and a
£750,000 T.B. block will be built at
the same hospital. Many hotels are
being altered and renovated at costs
ranging from £5OOO to £25,000.
The death occurred, on August 9,
of Colonel Alfred Spain, one of Aus-
tralia’s best-known architects, a soldier
and an administrator ,aged 86.

Mr. Bottomley said that after 53
years of active life in the building in-
dustry he felt that “time was getting
on,” and that he had earned a respite
from the responsibilities of public life
and business affairs.
Mr. Walter J. Bryant, of Earlwood,
was elected Senior Vice-President, and
Mr. S. O. Edwards, of A. W. Edwards

Two well-known building industry
personalities died during August. Mr.
Percy W. Saddington, 77. a promi-
nent Newcastle businessman and New-
castle Master Builders’ Exchange mem-
ber, passed away early in the month.
Major John A. Berriman, A.R.A.,
36, a Past President of Western Sub-
urbs Branch, M.B.A. of N.S.W., died
at Concord Repatriation Hospital on
August 15, after a long illness. At
the time of* his death, Major Berri-
man was attached to the 17th Con-
struction Squadron.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy, F.A.1.8.,
was re-elected Building Industry Con-
gress President for 1954-55. He faces
a year “big with opportunity” and a
future which holds “a big job for big
men,” to quote his own words.
In his annual report, Mr. Kennedy
declared that the year 1953-54 had
been an important one in the history
of Australia, “a year of consolidation
by wise and firm government.”
He stressed the need for a watch-
ful eye on the cost structure, noting
that “the effort to cope short-handed
with an expanding economy is a
costly business.”
As this journal goes to press,
Opportunities for Business remain
abundant, proof positive that the up-
ward trend of all types of construc-
tion is being maintained.
City architects report a busy time,
with much burning of midnight oil,
preparing plans and specifications for
numerous projects large, medium,
and small.
August, 1954, will go on record as
the month in which the healthy re-
covery of the N.S.W. building indus-
try became most evident.
TYNESIDE’S NEW DRY DOCK.
A new 709-ft. dry dock, one of the
largest in the United Kingdom, has
been opened on Tyneside.
The dock is the biggest on the
North-East Coast. It is the first large
dry dock constructed in Britain for
20 years.
It will take ships up to 38,000 tons
dead-weight, and some new tankers of
more than 38,000 d.-w. Some 95 per
cent, of the new tanker tonnage
actually in service or under construc-
tion could be accommodated. A
unique feature was the use of Larsscn
steel piling in the construction of the
walls instead of the traditional mass
concrete.

Approval has been given by the
Building Regulations Committee to
the inclusion in the Uniform Building
Regulations of the use of pre-cast re'
inforced gypsum plaster walls in
single'Storey buildings. The regula'
tion requires the plaster to have a
minimum compressive strength of not
less than 300 lb. per sq. ft. in two
hours after casting. Reinforcement
must be 6 x 6in. 11'gauge galvanised
steel mesh. The walls must be solid
and not less than in thickness.
External walls must be protected by
masonary or reinforced concrete
veneer.
The Housing Commission has let
contracts to Hansen and Yuncken
Pty. Ltd. for £55,800 for six blocks
of two'Storey flats —24 units • at
Heidelberg, and to Gyngell Bros, for
£45,000 for two brick veneer houses
at Dandenong.
Architects .continue to move from
out of the centre of the city. The
office of John F. D. Scarborough is
moving to 125 Powlett Street, East
Melbourne. Robert Marsh, Bennie
and Barry have new premises at 39
Wellington Road. East Melbourne.
The State Public Works Denart'
ment has accented the tender of J. R.
and E, Seccull Ptv. Ltd., High Street,
St. Kilda, for £124.300 for the erec-
tion of the Melbourne School of
Printing and Graphic Arts, North
Melbourne.
The death occurred recently of Mr.
Thomas Alfred Pemberton, 72, a
Past President of the Master Builders’
Association and the Building Industry
Congress.
Scaffolding regulations have been
altered by the State Government, re'
quiring catwalks to be provided for
workmen having to walk over roofs.
They must be of 9 x lin. Oregon
planks with 2 x lin. cleats.
Warren and Barr, builders, Wanga'
ratta, have been awarded a contract
for £34,083 for the erection of the
first section of a timber frame high
school in that town.
The Commonwealth Department of
Works has accepted the tender of
Prentice Builders Pty. Ltd., Rivers'
dale Road, Hawthorn, for £26,340
for the erection of wool textile re'
search laboratories at C.5.1.R.0.,
Royal Parade, Parkville.
A contract for £29,000 has been
let to R. Meagher, Whitehorse Road,
Nunadawing, for the erection of an
Army Training Centre in Ringwood.
For a similar type of building at
Echuca, John W. Henderson, Me'
Crae Street, Bendigo, has been
awarded a contract for £32,460.
The contract for the erection of
general offices, drawing office and
guardhouse for the Technical Ser'
vices Establishment at Maribyrnong
has been given to W. A. O’Donnell
Pty. Ltd., Ascot Vale. The figure is
about £48,000.
For the year ended June 30, 1954,
the Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works connected 14,557
houses to the water supply in the
Metropolitan area. Over the previous
five years the average number of con'
nections has been 13,000 yearly.
During the month of June, building
permits were issued by suburban
municipalities for 1121 houses, valued
at £3,255,282. The figures are much
the same as those for May, when 1126
house permits were valued at
£3,275,397.
A comparison of these figures with
those of the same period in 1953 is
not possible, because the statist has
increased the suburban area for
statistical purposes—to include new
developing areas.
In the “old” suburban area in
June, 1953, 724 house permits were
issued, compared with 878 in June,
1954.

Council Delegation to
Study Overseas Cities
Will Investigate Planning and Parking
Problems.
Sydney City Council is to send a
de.Tg .tion of aldermen and officials
overseas to study town planning and
parking systems, as the result of a
unanimous decision at Monday’s
meeting.
(he delegation is to go “at a suit-
able time,” and the Finance Commit-
tee has been instructed to w'Ork out
det uls of the tour.
The committee will discuss whether
the delegation should go only to the
U.S or also to Europe.
(Aid. T. Wright, Communist, sug-
gested that it should include Moscow.)
The proposal for the tour was
made by Aid. E. C. O’Dea (Lab.),
**ho declared that town planning was
!'o important to Sydney’s future that
aldermen should be fully equipped
to make proper decisions on it.
He said they could not obtain this
knowledge unless they saw for them-
selves what other countries with more
experience of town planning problems
were doing.
He did not agree with some of the
present features of our town planning.
“I think there is a lot to learn,” he
added.
Sorry History.
How very right Aid. O’Dea is. But,
while Lord Mayor, he made a jaunt to
Holland as the guest of the Mayor of
Amsterdam.
Was he very observant of town
planning progress in Europe? ’ Has he
been blind to the magnificent towh
planning projects visualised through
the years by our own great minds?
All the professional architects and
engineers study town planning now-
adays in their course of training. It
is a built-up knowledge acquired by
years of earnest endeavour, not one
acquired by a trip abroad by a lay-
man. Aldermen might see what others
have done, but their minds (through
lack of specialised training) would
never be able to devise anything that
would solve our problems.
Francis Greenway, for instance,
could not have built as he did were
he not an architect, nor could Dr.
Bradfield have built the Bridge and
all its approaches were he not an en-
gineer with a town planning penchant.
Lavmen, for the most part, do not
know what they are looking at when
they see it, from a technical point of
view. If they saw a tunnel darting

Forming has already started for the
draft tubes, which will actually be be-
low the waters of the Niagara River.
The concrete emplacements holding
these draft tubes are used to recover
as much as possible of the energy re-
maining in the water after it has pass-
ed the turbine runner. A solid bank
of rock on the river bank has been
built to serve as a cofferdam to hold
back the water while the timber forms
are placed below river level. Partly
because of this technique and the sit-
uations of the generating station six
miles downstream from Niagara Falls.
295 ft. of the 315 ft. difference be-
tween the intake structures and the
powerhouse will be utilised.
Although work is well up to sched-
ule on this project which is one of
the largest ever carried out in hydro-
electric engineering, the Ontario
Hydro Commission isn't resting on its
laurels, but already planning an even
bigger development in connection
with the construction of the St. Law-
rence Seaway, building of which mav
start this year. Seemingly, the de-
mand for electrical energy in 20th
century Canada is insatiable.
under a road here or there or a bridge
spanning Niagara or the Hudson or
any other place, they would not know
anything about the stresses on the
foundations, the moving and static
load the bridge would be called upon
to carry or the wand pressure it
would have to resist. In other words,
they would not know what would be
appropriate for the places they had
to cater for, each of which calls for a
different solution for its problem, and
perhaps this might vary from any-
thing done before. Our problems call
for their own solution.
It would be a waste of ratepayers’
money to send a delegation of laymen.
But it wouldn’t matter at this juncture
who went abroad; the sum total of all
their knowledge would be pigeon-
holed. The easiest thing to do is to
forget it until they know how to re-
spect the knowledge of our own pro-
fessionals and leave them to it.
The history of Sydney’s town plan-
ning has been an unfortunate and
sorry one, which will be fully dealt
with in our next issue.
The present Lord Mayor, Aid. P.
J. Hills, has investigated car-pafrking
methods in America on two trips
abroad in the last 18 months. Why
did he not find time to investigate
some aspects, at least, of overseas
town planning?
He visited San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Washington, and
New York in May, 1953, en route to
the Coronation.
He left Sydney by air on May 15,
1954, on a three weeks’ visit to
America, where he again studied
parking problems.
On his return, on both occasions
he addressed aldermen and showed
motion pictures of American parking
projects.
None of the suggestions he made
since then has developed into any-
thing. But he is endeavouring and he
has “drive.” So, here’s hoping.
Thus history repeats itself.
“I seem to see a vision of a terrible
collision,
With all the world at peace again.
Amid the armoured vans
With scientific schemers
And philosophic dreamers
Assailing one another with their
rolled-up plans.”
Sydney already has a very costly
Master Plan, regarding which next to
nothing has been done to date.
An electric “curtain” hung round
Britain’s new 3 300-ton cable ship
“Recorder” entirely prevents corro-
sion, tests show. The “curtain”
method will save the shipping indus-
try millions of pounds spent in dock-
ing.

Mr. T. M. Lipscombe, F.A.1.8. (Tas'
mania), will preside, and members of
the Tasmanian M.B.A. will act as
hosts to visiting delegates during their
stay.
During his term of office, Mr.
Lipscombe has made a number of visits
to the capital cities, and he also rep'
resented the Australian building iiv

ASPHALT ON FLAT ROOFS
Mr. Oliver S. Chesterton, M.C., F.R.1.C.5., in a paper given at a general meeting
of Quantity Surveyors at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in London
on October 21st, 1953, said, under “Roofs”: —
“I have more than once been disappointed with the lasting qualities of
asphalt in large flat roofs ... it is tempting, when trying to keep down
the cost of a job, to employ an asphalting firm of no great reputation,
because they have quoted a highly competitive price . . . therefore, I
plead with Quantity Surveyors to make certain that asphalt roofing is
carried out by a first-class firm.”

• is manufactured to British Standard Specification in modern mechanically"
agitated cookers and all the processes of manufacture are under the supervision
of an experienced industrial chemist;

IS THE HALLMARK OF QUALITY & DEPENDABILITY !
Virulent epidemics of typhus, diph'
theira and smallpox (which, incident
tally, is considered lucky, and is called
the “flower disease”) are common,
due to primitive living conditions,
and when a visitation is made, there
is no half measure about it. For in'
stance, bubonic plague killed off
40,000,000 people 50 years ago.
Japan uprooted 100,000,000 people
during the war of 1937-1945.
Still, the high birth rate more than
repairs the loss from accident and
disease and China’s population con'
tinues to increase.
China can boast of having the
longest stretch of canals in the world.
They run into 36,000 miles.
The Yangtse'Kiang is navigable for
2000 miles: oceangoing vessels can
penetrate 600 miles up'dver, to
Hangkow. and rivers steamers 400
miles further.
When the St. Lawrence sea'way in
America is completed, it will outclass
this, for it will be navigable for
oceangoing ships for 2250 miles into
the heart of North America through
the Great Lakes and the Welland
Canal, which latter lifts ships 327 feet.
This will embrace a continuous chan'
nel of 1200 miles, with a depth of
27 feet.
Two hundred Australian'built trac'
tors —a gift from Australia —will soon
be at work in Pakistan. In addition to
the tractors, Australia's gift includes
farm machinery, entirely built in the
Commonwealth. Pakistan has a popu'
lation of 76.000,000 and covers an
area of 350,000 square miles.
Colour light signalling was intro-
duced in America in 1918, when con'
gestion on Fifth Avenue, New York,
became too acute for point duty
policemen.
First traffic lights in England were
put up in Leeds in 1923.

AMERICA FORGES AHEAD.
Every recent issue of American architectural journals shows more and more fine modern buildings rapidly going skywards [?]
the major cities of the United States. By comparison and unfortunately, of recent years, stagnation has been the order [?]
the day in Australian cities, although in the last twelve months, at long last, there appears to have been a quickening and a
number of important city buildings are under construction or mooted in most of the major cities of the Commonwealth.
Our Illustration shows three recent American examples of modern construction. The office building on the left, in New York,
is clad with aluminium. The centre building is another office building, also In New York. Those on the right are flat build-
ings. In Sydney we would only require a dozen or so of these at Darlinghurst or Redfern, within walking distance from the
City, and people would not be called upon to travel standee fashion in overcrowded buses or trains to the remote suburbs,
and our transport difficulties would be at an end. We haven't the rolling stock or the men to man our transport, and
those we have are always wanting to strike. Again, what is the difference between lift machinery taking one into the pure
air of the heavens and the smelly machinery of the bus ta king one along the dusty roads, spending an hour or more daily,
so uselessly? It means one could work 45 hours a week, Instead of 40 as at present, and be paid for the five hours now
spent in travelling. We've got such queer ideas about developing the great sprawl of suburbia.

ATTIC ROOMS ARE NOT SO POPULAR.
Twenty year ago it was a common sight to sè bouses with steeply pitched roofs which rooms were açcommodated, these
being lit from the gable ends and by means of dormer windows. Such types of house are, of course, very popular in
England and Europe, and in fact contribute materiaĺy to the characterstic charm of the English coţage and villa, the
Dutch house as well as the French mansard variation. Recently, hower, this sort of design has not been as popular in
Australia as previous'y , some contending that rrooms in tend to be hot in summer, although of course this could
[?] some with proper insulation. The upper left example is one of these aţic type houses; the other three make no
[?] of the roof space, the pitches being fairly flat. These three example all have two bedrooms. living, kitchen and
[?] bathroom, though the disposition of the various rooms produces entirely different plans and elevational treament.
