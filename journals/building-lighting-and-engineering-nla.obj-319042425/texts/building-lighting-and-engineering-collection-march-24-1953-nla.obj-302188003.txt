THIS ONE'S GOING UP FAST!
Notice how piaster-smooth Gyprock
walls and ceilings save time on every type of job
C.S.R. makes many cost-cutting building
materials. One of the best time and
money-savers is Gyprock. This beautiful
plaster-smooth wallboard saves days on
the finishing of a room. It can be
painted or papered. It can be placed
over existing walls. It is installed without
any mess. Gyprock is unaffected by tem-
perature changes. Its mineral core is
resistant to borers and white ants and
does not attract vermin. Fireproof.
Available in six sheet sizes (6, 7,8, 9, 10
and 12 ft. lengths by 3 and 4 ft. widths).
Just lift the ? phone for estimates —your
regular timber merchant or hardware
dealer will give them to you.
TWO TYPES OF GYPROCK PLASTER WALLBOARD
Recessed Edge. No join, no line, no nails can be
seen with Recessed Edge Gyprock joint treatment.
It gives you a beautifully smooth, seamless wall and
ceiling surface that can be painted in any finish or
papered.
Square Edge. The standard square-edge board is
also obtainable in all sizes.

EXTRACT FROM OFFICIAL REPORT:
"Tests carried out by the Council tor Scientific and Industrial
Research, Division of Economic Entomology, towards the end of
1947, proved that Masonite Presdwood. containing a minimum of
0.5%' w/w. of Pentachlorophenol. was termite-resistant. These tests
employed Eutermes exitiousus and Coptotermes lacteus, typical
representatives of two of the most destructive groups of termites
In Australia.
"Treated Masonite was found to be superior to cypress pine
(Callitris glauca) in its resistance to +ermite attack. (Cypress pine
is commonly regarded as being termite-proof.) Samples of mountain
ash (Eucalyptus regnans) tested under similar conditions were
completely destroyed by the termites."

Fibrock-Asbestos
Cement Sidings
They cost less than weatherboards but they are more
attractive. These are the same type of asbestos cement
sidings that you see advertised in “Progressive
Architecture and other U.S. architectural magazines.
The soft grey color needs no painting.
Also, hibrock sidings blend beautifully with timber
or brick construction. Each siding measures 2 feet by
one. Nail holes are already there just waiting for the
nails. Require practically no upkeep over a lifetime
of wear.

Fibrock Roofing
Why worry about the tile shortage? This is a roofing
that is really beautiful in its own right. The soft grey
natural color of the corrugated sheets is much easier on
the eyes than the hard-looking “red” of ordinary tiles.
If you wish, these sheets can be painted also. Fibrock
Corrugated Roofing is completely fireproof, and will
outlast any tile or metal roof.
Fibrock Fiat Sheets
Do you know that asbestos cement flat
sheets are included amongst the big
range of C.S.R. Building Materials?
This is a stronger sheet than any
other type of flat asbestos cement
sheet because it is made from blue
asbestos fibre (much stronger than
white) from C.S.R.’s own asbestos
mine.

OTIS
The building and its function must deter-
mine the type and design of vertical
transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Otis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators—because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in

“Crompton” fluorescent and incandescent lamps and fittings make
possible a complete lighting plan for general lighting in factories,

fittings will improve seeing conditions, and the greater brilliance,
the reduced glare and the absence of harsh shadows will be appreciated
by personnel. For decorative lighting the “Crompton” range includes
tubular, candle and architectural lamps. “Crompton” mercury and
sodium discharge lamps, infra-red drying lamps and rough service

PAKISTAN EMBASSY TO BE ERECTED
AT CANBERRA
EMIL SODERSTEEN, Architect.
We illustrate preliminary sketch drawings for
the Chancellery and Residence to be erected in
Canberra for the High Commissioner for Pakis-
tan. There is a simplified Eastern character about
the Chancellery with its dome, though the resi-
dence may be described as a frank and logical
solution with pleasing low-lying lines appropriate
to Canberra drawing importance neither from tra-",
ditional nor from current functionalistic cliches.
Plans are at present with the Pakistan Govern- -i
ment at Karachi and it is expected that it will 1J
not be very long before the Architect receives s
instructions to proceed with the Chancellery which rl
will be the first unit to be erected.

cross-roads. It has priced itself out of
the market and it behoves itself to
take positive action to produce
stability,” said Mr. C. E. Thompson,
President of the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W., speaking at the
Annual Industry Dinner of the Fibrous
Plaster Association of N.S.W. at
“Amory,” Ashfield, on Thursday,
March 12th, 1953. He then pro-
ceeded to forcefully express his
opinion as to how this should be
achieved. “Cut out Cost-Plus and
Rise and Fall and take the job on at
a Firm Price. I can see no serious
price rises for at least twelve months,
and now is the time to give it a go.
It is a challenge to us all —Builders,
Suppliers and Merchants. When this
is achieved. Building Owners will be
much more ready to proceed with the
immense amount of work that is re-
quired. If we don’t do this and keep
prices down, the present reduced level
of activity will continue for some
time.”
It was this serious note that charac-
terised the various speeches by leaders
of the industry.
D. Stewart Fraser, M.L.A., who
was congratulated from all quarters
upon his election to the Legislative
Assembly as the Liberal Member for
Gordon, used as the theme for his re-
marks “Strength Through Adversity.”
“The Fibrous Plaster Industry, in com-
mon with others ancillary to building,
has had a pretty tough time during
the last twelve or eighteen months.
You have managed to keep your chins
up, haven’t carried your economic
hearts on your sleeves, but in con-
fidential moments any one of you
would have been prepared to admit
that things were pretty tough. There
is no need to review all the symptoms
of the building recession as revealed
in the body industrial sufficient at
this stage to admit frankly that the
Industry was a serious case of mal-
nutrition. Now we can pull ourselves
together in the knowledge that the
worst is over.
“We are on the mend and, as is so
often the case with other invalids, we
shall be healthier as a direct result of
our ailments. I am satisfied that the
whole Building Industry is healthier
and happier than it has been for ten
years, and although we are still in a
stage of convalescence it would be un-
wise to grumble if ours is a gradual
recoverv because there would be grave
danger of a relapse in a recurrence of
boom conditions. And so, let us press
on toward full health and prosperity
in the certain knowledge that it lies
ahead of us. Be assured that nothing
can destroy our industrial future ex-
cept our own foolishness. The gigantic
tasks which lie ahead of the building
fraternitv are a challenge to our zeal
and efficiency and hold the sure

Economic Costs.
Mr. F. S. Scorer, President of the
Newcastle and Maitland Zone of the
Fibrous Plaster Association, in re'
spending to the toast of the Industry,
proposed by Stewart Fraser, emphasised
that there must be a real effort for
greater productivity made by all sec'
tions of the community; all manufac'
turers should carefully examine their
organisation and methods for there is
an urgent need for a reduction of
costs in the industry.
Parliament and Democracy.
The President of the Association,
Mr. D. J. O’Dell, in proposing the
toast of Parliament, in a forceful
speech attacked the apathy and com'
placency of the average Australian to- 1
wards the privileges of democracy
and the institution of Parliament.
“We only give it a thought once
every three years at election time,” he
said, “and take these great privileges
as a matter of course.” We only have
to look around the world to see the
other side of the picture. All sorts
of “isms” were permitted to be in our
midst through our belief in tolerance
and personal freedom, but the only
“ism” that we should be concerned
with is patriotism.
Lt.'Colonel M. F. Bruxner, D. 5.0.,
M.L.A., Leader of the Country Party,
in responding to the toast of Parlia'
ment, said that it was the institution
of Parliament and not the people in it
that was important. It was not suffi'
cient that our forebears from Runny'
mede onwards had fought for the
privileges inherent in the democratic
system of parliamentary government;
it must be constantly guarded. As
Father of the N.S.W. Parliament over
the past thirty-three years he had seen
it change from a deliberative assembly
to a machine for registering decisions
made elsewhere.
Other countries under dictatorship
rule would give anything to enjoy the
privilege of voting, yet Australia was
the only country in the democratic
world to have the great blot of com'
nulsory voting upon it.
The Hon. Vernon H. Treatt,
M.M., Q.C., M.L.A.,. Leader of the
Onnosition, responding to the toast of
The Building Industry proposed by
Mr. C. E. Thompson, said that a pros'
nerous. energetic and fully'occupied
Building Industry was of the greatest
importance to a country. Its health
and progress is essential to the health
and progress of the State and Nation.
That improvements in local produc-
tivitv was vital was emphasised by the
fact that from 1939 to 1952 the rate
of building in N.S.W. had increased
44% as against 134% for the rest of
Australia.
The toasts of “Our Guests” was
proposed by Mr. A. C. Mitchinson,
President, Fibrous Plaster Association,
Metropolitan, the response being by
Mr. Cobden Parkes, F.R.1.8.A., Gov'
ernment Architect, and Mr. Eric W.
Andrew, A.R.1.8.A., President,
R.A.1.A., N.S.W. Chapter.
As usual at this enjoyable function,
the cuisine was excellent, and harmony
and entertainment were provided by
George Brown (piano), Noel Melvin
(baritone), Douglas Bailey (conjurer)
and Frank Ryan with his stories and
his inimitable interpretations of in'
ebriated gentlemen.
Organisation as usual by Association
Secretary, Tod Jarman, was smooth
and faultless.

The Annual General Meeting of
the Fibrous Plaster Association of

both metropolitan and country mem'
bers being present.
The election of officers resulted in
Mr. D. I. O’dell, of Kempsey, being

Discussions took place on a number
of items connected with the industry,
the main subjects being East African
sisal, plaster, the use of rope, and
advertising.
Use of Rope.
The meeting was informed that at
the Federal Meeting held in October,
1952, a resolution was passed to the
effect that rope be deleted from the
S'andard Specifications. This resolu'
tion had been passed on to the Stan*
dards Association and it was consider'
ed that in the very near future the
clause relating to rope would be de'
leted.
The meeting further resolved that
when the deletion took place all
Governmental Departments and in-
strumentalities would be informed that
rope no longer should be used in the
manufacture of fibrous plaster sheets.

NEW HEADQUARTERS FOR CONSTRUCTION FIRM
MILESTONE IN GROWTH OF M. R. HORNIBROOK PTY. LTD.
Hornibrook McKenzie Clark Pty.
Ltd., Civil Engineers and Building
Contractors, have joined the list, or
perhaps we should more accurately
say, “headed” the list of distinguished
Australian companies whose progress
is marked by the milestone of an im'
posing, well'planned, welhlit, welhset
Sydney headquarters at 44 Liverpool
Road, Summer Hill.
This company is the N.S.W. sub'
sidiary of M. R. Hornibrook (Pty.)
Ltd., Newstead, Brisbane, builders of
the Gray Street bridge and the Hor'
nibrook Highway, which name hon'
ors the principal of the firm, and
many other major works.
The growth of the typically Aus'
tralian enterprise of M. R. Horni'
book Pty. Ltd. from humble begin'
nings to its present enormous rami'
fications speaks volumes for the drive
and ability of its founder, Mr. Manuel
Hornibrook, and the loyal support he
has received from his associates.
The Official Opening.
To suitably mark the opening of
their new administration offices at
Summer Hill, Hornibrook McKenzie
Clark Pty. Ltd. were hosts on March
18th to a large gathering of prominent
architects, engineers, master builders
and representatives of Government
and Local Government instrumental!'
ties.
Among those present were seven
directors, including the Managing Di'
rector, Mr. M. R. Hornibrook, of
Hornibrook Clark Pty.
Ltd.; several directors from the par'
ent company, M. R. Hornibrook Pty.
Ltd. Brisbane, and staff members of
the two organisations.
On arrival, guests were greeted by
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook and presented
with an “identity disc” and cordially
invited to make themselves perfectly
at home.
The hospitality was abundant, and
the organisation of the whole function
a credit to all concerned.
During the evening the Mayor of
Ashfield, Alderman H. M. Baily con'
gratulated Hornibrook McKenzie
Clark Pty. Ltd. “on their enterprise
in erecting such a splendid building
which is a credit to the profession as
a whole.”
Aid. Baily said this progressive or'
ganisation has made history 1 and is
leaving its mark in Sydney.
“Its expansion from Queensland to
N.S.W. and other States is evidence
that private enterprise is thriving.
“We are very pleased to have such
a grand firm in Ashfield, and their
new home is a building which does
credit both to the firm and to the
Municipality of Ashfield,” Aid. Baily
added, amid applause.
Replying in a typically human
speech, Mr. M. R. Hornibrook said
he was pleased and proud to be able
to personally thank all his good friends
who were present at the function.
“It is a privilege to shake each one
of you by the hand.” he declared,

ing at Summer Hill was the culmina'
tion of a great ambition, and he was
indeed grateful to Ashfield Council
for their invitation to his organisation
to establish headquarters in the dis'
trict.
It has been by no means easy to
find a suitable site and he had inves'
tigated many before locating the
“ideal one.”
Mr. Hornibrook thanked the Mayor
and Council “for the privilege of
building in Summer Hill.”
“It is a very central position for
our operations, and is handy to both
our Enfield and Drummoyne depots.
He paid a tribute to the outstand'
ing work of the architect, Mr. lack
Hennessy—who was present with his
son and senior members of his staff
—which has resulted in a “really
splendid building.”
Mr. Hornibrook concluded by
again thanking the of
Ashfield for being allowed to erect
offices as business premises.
“This has resulted in one of the
finest buildings in the district, and one
of which we are justfiably proud,”
he added.
The building itself and the activi'
ties of this firm will be featured in

LIBRARY
OLD WORLD ATMOSPHERE.
In March, 1952, an old house in spacious grounds at 629 Military Road, near Spit Junction.
Mosman, wes acquired and converted and renovated to suit its new function. On the 8th
November the new premises were officially opened by The Hon. R. J. Heffron, Deputy
Premier and Minister tor Education in the presence of 1000 people. “The building,” says the
Annual Report of the Council, “is an acquisition to the district, and one of which the
residents should feel justly proud. The gardens and land surrounding the Library ensure
that an area of open space near Spit Junction will be preserved for all time, and will provide
an area for recreational facilities. The membership shows that residents of the Municipality
are appreciative of the facilities available to them and it is a gratifying fact that just over
twenty-five per cent, of the population arc subscribers to the Library. Figures available to
the 30th November show a total circulation of 113,111 books, an increase of nearly 20,000
on the corresponding period of 1951. The book stock stands at 18,822, and income from
charges amounted to £666.”
THE LIBRARY AT NIGHT.
In converting the old Victorian building the Council wisely decided not to attempt to
modernise. The old cast iron balustrade, columns and trim have been painted white and
the long shutters a pale blue while fluorescent lighting and floodlighting has been installed
so that at night amongst the trees it presents an attractive spectacle.

NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CO. PTY. LTD.
TO BE ERECTED AT THE CORNER OF HARRIS AND MARY ANN STREETS, ULTIMO, SYDNEY.
Architect: H. O. Woodhouse.
Master Builders: H. W. Thompson 8C Co. Pty. Ltd.
The new building to be erected at
the corner of Harris and Mary Ann
Sts., Ultimo, for the National Cash
Register Co. Pty. Ltd., consists of
three floors designed to extend in the
future to eight floors, and with provh
sion for two future passenger lifts.
The present building provides for
a goods lift, the machine room for
which is located two storeys above flat
roof to provide for the addition of
two future floors without alteration.
The building has been designed
primarily for servicing the firm’s Cash
Registers and for their manufacture
and storage including a few offices on
first floor for their service department.
Provision is made for a dining room
canteen and welhequipped kitchen for
stag, and complete amenities toilets
and locker rooms for both sexes on
each floor.
R.C. Construction,
Construction of the building is of
reinforced concrete; foundation piers
extending down to solid rock about 15
feet below ground floor, with flat slab
construction designed to take loads up
to 500 lb. per sq. ft. on ground floor,
and 300 lb. per sq. ft. on upper floors.
The reinforced concrete columns
are spaced at approx. 20ft. x 20ft.
bays with mushroom heads and with
concealed construction to Mary Ann
St. frontage where columns are set
back 7ft. into building, thus providing
continuous unbroken windows for a
length of 115 ft. to provide good nat'
ural light to the repair department.
Aluminium Fins for
Sun Protection.
A feature of the Mary Ann Street
frontage which faces north'west is the
series of aluminium fins, extending
to full height from first and second
floors, 24” in depth to protect the in'
teriors from the direct rays of the
westerly sun and designed in alumim
ium for lightness of construction.
Portion of the ground floor area is
below footpath level, and in order to
obtain maximum natural light to this
area as well as to exclude all dust and
noise from the street, the windows fac'
ing Harris Street and Mary Ann Street
on this level will consist of glass lens
set in concrete frames, which is con-
sidered the most suitable means of
penestration under these conditions.
The building is to be provided with
complete plenum and exhaust systems
of mechanical ventilation and provh
sion is made for electrical power and
light points for both plant and gen'
eral lighting requirements.
Acceptance of Piece of Sculpture
BY BUILDING RESEARCH DIVISION, MELBOURNE.
A piece of sculpture presented to
the Building Research Division of the
C.5.1.R.0. by the staff of the Building
Research Station at Watford, England,
in gratitude for food parcels was un'
veiled in Melbourne last week at the
Building Research Centre at Highett.
It represents two figures planning
and building a structure, said to be
symbolic of the nature of the work
upon which the two research centres
are engaged and is entitled “The End
is to Build Well.” It has been exe'
cuted in the entirely new manner.
[Ed.: The work of modern artists
invariably falls short of beauty and
can rarely be said to reach high artis'
tic attainment. It is a subject that has
provoked much controversy of late
in connection with the French pic'
tures recently exhibited. Australia
had a plethora of pieces of “New
Art” sculpture donated to the nation
after World War I. How to get rid
the unworthy things was a problem.
Some Councils, such as Manly, re'
fused acceptance. Sutherland, I
think, accepted one and erected it in
the centre of a roadway. Someone
dismantled it, leaned it up against a
fence, face inwards as though to hide
its shame. The Council found it and
re'erected it. Then it was reported
that the thing had been given a coat
of black tar or something. Once it
was reported to have been dismantled
and buried and ultimately lost. No
reference was made to it after that.
It was a Kilkenny Cats battle Royal.
Whether resentful citizens or the
Council won the battle was not re'
corded.l

NEW MELBOURNE MATERNITY HOSPITAL
WILL DOUBLE NUMBER OF BEDS
The inception of a seven-year plan
to eliminate Melbourne’s shortage of
maternity accommodation was an-
nounced recently.
The hospital is to be rebuilt to
provide for double its present num-
ber of beds. It will be one of the
largest of its type in the world (see
illustration).
Work will commence this year if
finance is available, and the pro-
gramme is expected to be completed
in 1960.
The Government is expected to de-
fray most of the cost, but 25 per cent,
will require to be raised by public
subscription.
Close Relationship.
The new buildings have been de-
signed to preserve a close relationship
between doctor, nurse and patient.
The patient coming to the surgical
or ante-natal outpatients’ clinics will
have the same team of doctors and
nurses to attend her when she becomes
an impatient in one of the five sur-
gical or five maternity sections.
Innovations.
The new hospital will have 400
maternity and 200 surgical beds (pres-
ent total 308), 350 babies’ cots
(180) and 100 premature and sick
babies’ cots (40).
Each maternity floor will have its
own ante-natal, delivery and post-natal
beds.
The hospital, which is the teaching
hospital in obstetrics for all Mel-
bourne University medical students,
will also have a clinical research unit.
The architects, Messrs. Leighton,
Irwin and Co., have re-designed the
re-building so as to interfere as little
as possible with the functioning of
the present buildings.
The first steps will be to add three
floors to the Gertrude Kumm wing
(see illustration, top right . Next year
work will begin on a new home for
600 nurses—double the present num-
ber (see illustration, top left).
It is hoped to complete the home
by 1956 for possible occupation by
women athletes in the Olympic
Games.
U.K. COAL LOSSES.
The British Coal Board lost 2A
on every ton of coal mined in the
last quarter of 1952.
Each ton cost 58/Bd. to produce—
but the average selling price was only
56/Bd. according to official figures.
Total production was 49,000,000
tons. Loss on it was just over
<£5,000.000. But revenue from other
sources cut the quarter’s deficit to
<£3,087,000.
This included back'dated agree'
ments under which £2, 200,000 was
paid.

Gods, Graves and Scholars - The Story of Archaeology
NEW BOOK OF GREAT INTEREST.
Reviewed by ADRIAN ASHTON, F.R.I.B.A
Many people, even i interest were
kindled by the unusual title of this
book, would be deterred from open'
ing it by the subtitle, for to them
archaeology is as dry as dust.
C. W. Ceram German author of
this new work, which was first pub'
lished in its English translation in
1952 (with second, third and fourth
impressions following at monthly in'
tervals), has, however, made this story
of ancient man live, just as Sir James
Jeans, H G. Wells and Hendrik Van
Loon have done in other spheres of
scientific and learned endeavour. “My
aim,” says the author, “was to portray
the dramatic qualities of archaeology,
its human side.” The remarkable
popularity of the book with the
general public is proof of his success.
Why Archaeology?
In answering his self-oostulated
Question ' "Why sea ch the Pas*’”
Cerfm says '■All of us live wfthin
our heritage of five thousand years of
history. Were this not so, we should
be no different from the Australian
‘bushman’ The white building worker
in an Australian city may never have
heard of Archimedes. This is of no
importance. Important is the fact that
he makes use of the law formulated
by Archimedes. .. . For this reason
archaeology is the concern of us all
and is not in the least an esoteric
branch of science. When we busy
ourselves with archaeology, life as a
whole has become our subject. And
life is not a spasmodic, piecemeal
affair, but a constant balancing on the
point of intersection where past and
future meet.
Pompeii and Herculaneum.
Interest in archaeology may be said
to have started in 1738, when the
King of Naples to please his Queen
started excavating on the flanks of
Vesuvius and by sheer luck came upon
t h e Roman city of Herculaneum
buried under fifty feet of lava. This
was followed by Pompeii, which had
similarly been engulfed in A.D. 79
and laid dormant under the volcanic
ash for seventeen hundred years.
“It is hard to visualise a more ex'
pedient way of preserving a whole
city for the benefit of posterity than
by catching it fairly in the midst of
its everyday activity and by sealing
it beneath a great blanket of ash.
Pompeii is quite different from the
ruins of a city which had died a
natural death by a process of wither'
ing away. The living community was
touched by a magic wand and the
laws of time, of becoming and of
fading, lost their validity.”
The Birth of a Science.
Excavation at Pompeii and Hercu'
laneum in the early stages were
naturally haphazard and planless, and
it remained for J. J. Winckelmann, in
spite of great frustration owing to the
secrecy that surrounded this early
work, to found the Science of Archae'
°l°gy> fdr that is what in his great
™ ork ’ History of the Art of
Antiquity, he virtually did. Although
the book was written in his own
words without a model, it became
a model itself and to this day on his
birthday students of antiquity in the
great archaeological institutes of Rome
and Athens celebrate his memory,
xcava ion roves y
and Le S end -
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect
of the whole story is how archaeo'
logical work has proved the truth of
story and legend that by most were
THE GREAT PYRAMID.
The Great Pyramid of Cheops is still one of the greatest wonders of the world. Built B.C. 3733 it was originally
482 ft. high, each side being 760 ft. and it covers an area of thirteen acres. Some of the ston esare 20 ft. by
6 ft. and the means of quarrying and transporting them is still a matter of theory and speculation.

regarded as myth and imagination
with little tangible foundation.
The two outstanding examples are,
perhaps, Troy and the Biblical cities
of Nineveh and Babylon.
Heinrich Schliemann as a boy was
thrilled by the tales of battles fought
by Homer’s heroes; about Paris and
Helen, Achilles and Hector, and about
mighty Troy that was burned and
levelled. Looking at pictures of the
massive walls and the great Scaear-
Gate he asked his father if it was all
gone, and when told that it was and
nobody knew where it stood, he re-
fused to believe it and boy-like said;
“When I am big, I shall go to Greece
and find Troy and the king’s treasure.”
His father laughed as parents do.
Heinrich had great drive and busi-
ness acumen: he learnt to speak all
European languages, including Rus-
sian, and went to St. Petersburgh as
an agent for his firm; he also visited
America in 1850 and started a bank
on the Californian goldfields and by
46u a millionaire, he set off for the
Kingdom of the Achaeans, not even
bothering to visit modern Greece en
route, to achieve his boyhood dream.
It is of symbolic interest that the
first native Greek whom he met was
an Ithican blacksmith whose wife’s
name was Penelope and whose two
sons were named Odysseus and Tele-
machus.
Schliemann took his Homer abso-
lutely literally and he quickly rejected
Bunarbashi, which was the generally
accepted site of ancient Troy. He fol-
lowed the topography as described in
the Iliad, paced the distance between
the two hills securing Troy, watch in
hand, and finally, after careful survey,
reasoning and analysis, selected his
spot, commenced to dig and found
“Priam’s Pergamos,” the great city of
Troy! He also found great treasure,
the massive walls and the ruins of a
gigantic gate, charred by fire the
gate through which the treacherous
wooden horse had passed. His faith
in Homer had indeed been justified!
Excavations at Knossos, on the
Island of Crete, by Sir Arthur Evans
also revealed the great palace of King
Minos which covered five and a half
acres, had such an elaborate and in-
tricate plan that the word “labrynth”
naturally came to mind and this,
coupled with urns decorated with
huge bulls tossing young men, seems
to give some substance to the famous
story of Theseus, Ariadne and the
Minotaur.
The Discovery of Nineveh.
The land between the Euphrates and
Tigris River, Mesopotamia, was flat,
but here and there mysterious mounds
rose out of the plains. This region
afforded one of archaeology’s greatest
triumphs, if only for the reason that it
showed no visible traces of past great'
ness. Except for the mounds scattered
over the dusty plain, the investigators
had little to go on but some poetical
descriptions from the Bible.
It was in this region that were
located the famous cities on which the
God of the Bible visited His mighty
wrath. Here, in Nineveh and Babylon
reigned terrible kings who had other
gods besides Him and therefore had
to be expunged from the face of the
earth.
The first discovery goes to a young
Frenchman, Paul Botta, who, near
Khorsabad, after turning but a few
spadesful of earth, brought to light
walls covered with pictures, bas'reliefs
and statues of bearded men and winged
animals, unlike any ever before seen
by European eyes. It soon became
apparent that he had discovered one
of the great Assyrian palaces - later
identified as that of King Sargon and
mentioned in the prophecies of Isaiah
—-in the city of Nineveh which caused
a world'wide sensation, for it amount'
ed to a demonstration that a culture

It had risen in might and splendour,
only to sink, under fire and sword,
into oblivion.
Austen Henry Layard followed with
the excavation of Nimrud. which con'
tained immense quantities of sculpture,
magnificent hunting scenes, bas' re'
liefs in colourful glazed brickwork
and innumerable huge stone winged
bulls of great size. One of these,

eight centuries, was hauled up a

gesticulating Arabs, put on a barge,
travelled 600 miles down the Tigris
and then some 12,000 miles by ship

British Museum, where to this day it
inspires dignified awe in all who be'
hold it. It was also due to the efforts
of Layard that two enormous rooms
at the 1854 Exhibition at the Crystal
Palace were devoted to examples of
the amazing and hitherto entirely un-
known culture of Old Syria.
The Tower of Babel.
Robert Koldewey made the third
great Assyrian discovery by finding
the fabulous city of Babylon: the
Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar. Whereas
his predecessors in the building of
their citadels used sun-baked bricks,
Nebuchadnezzar employed fired bricks
with his stamp visible on them, and
to-dav the modern city of Hilleh and
neighbouring villages are built of these
bricks, for just as the Colosseum and
Roman temples were used during the
Middle Ages as stone quarries for
contemporary building, so the ancient
buildings of Babylon served Arab
building needs.
Every large Babylonian city had a
Ziggurat, or stepped pyramid, rising
in a series of enormous terraces, sur'
mounted by a temple, but none com'
pared with that of Babylon. The base
of the tower was 288 ft. on a side
and the total height of tower and
temple was also 288 ft.: the first stage
was 105 ft. 6in. in height, the second
57ft. 6in., the third, fourth, fifth and
sixth 19ft. 4in. each, and the temple
TUT-ANKH-AMEN.
This illustration is of one of the four min-
iature coffins found in the Tomb of Tutank-
hamen and which are copies of the casket in
which the Royal Mummy was found. The

art of the ancient goldsmith and jeweller.

The World’s Oldest Culture
and The Flood.
Sir Leonard Woolley, another of
England’s great archaeologists, in the
twenties of this century began to dig
in the Biblical Ur of the Chaldees,
home of Abraham, and finally came to
the conclusion that the Sumerian cul-
ture which preceded the Assyrian and
Babylonian seemed to almost coincide
in its beginnings with the times de-
scribed in Genises and may well be
the same people who populated the
earth after the deluge that wiped out
all humankind but Noah and his kin.
He further came to the conclusion
that the Flood was an historic fact,
for not only is it referred to in the
legend of the Sumerians, but also in
his excavations at Ur he found, ap-
proximately forty feet from the sur-
face, a layer of alluvial clay eight feet
thick and entirely free of an evidence
of human imnlements, urns, rubbish,
etc., as is always found in places of
human habitation. He dated this as
the fortieth century B.C.
The Land of the Pharoahs.
The great story of the unfolding
of ancient Egypt may be said to have
started with Napoleon’s ill-fated ex-
pedition in 1798, for he took with
him 175 scholars together with their
books to study the new French colony
to be. One of these was a gifted
draftsman named Denon and his draw-
ings made Europe aware of the great
Egyptian monuments.
And so the special section of
Archaeology known as Egyptology
started, and great names like Giovanni
Belzoni, Auguste Mariette, Sir Flinders
Petrie, Lord Carnarvon and Howard
Carter amazed the world with their
discoveries, culminating in 1922 with
the finding of the tomb and mag-
nificent relics of Tut-Ankh-Amen.
The description of the opening of
the tomb, as one after the other of
the antechambers are traversed until
the final burial chamber is found —to
the thrill of the searchers undisturbed
by robbers —is tense and dramatic.
There was pathos, too, when the lid
was lifted from the great stone sarco-
phagus and the golden effigy of the
boy ruler on the lid of the inner
coffin was revealed, there was a tiny
wreath of flowers around the symbols
on the forehead, the last farewell
offering of the widowed girl queen to
her husband. “Among all that regal
splendour, that royal magnificence
everywhere the glint of gold there
was nothing so beautiful as those few
withered flowers, still, after 3 300 years,
retaining their tinge of colour.”
“That little touch of Nature,” wrote
Howard Carter, “made that ancient
and our modern civilisation kin.”
Hieroglyphs and Cuneiform.
For the lover of cryptograms the
great struggle to decipher the Egyp-
tian hieroglyphics proves exciting
reading, this final triumph going to
Jean-Francois Champollion, a French
Egyptologist, whose greatest mental
accomplishment perhaps was to break
away from the tradition of Horapollo,
whose detailed description of the Egyp-
tian script in the fourth century A.D.
was usually taken as the basis for fur-
ther research. Champollion in his solu-
tion of the infinitely complicated sys-
tem proved him to be entirely erron-
neous. The Hieroglyphic alphabet,
with help from the Rosetta Stone, was
finally found to consist of 24 con-
sonants, but it was never used by it-
self, but was always supplemented
by signs signifying two or three con-
sonants and by determinatives. In the
solving of this mightiest of puzzles
of the past over ten thousand papyri
were brought to Europe to be studied
by hundreds of scholars. Some idea

of the immense complexity is gained
when it is known that some inscrip'
tions read from right to left, others
from left to right, and some from top
to bottom. Again, as the Egyptian
centuries rolled on the writing changed
—just as modern English is so diT
ferent from that of Chaucer—and the
already highly developed hieroglyphics
evolved into a Hieratic and finally into
a Demotic script.
The decipherment of the Assyrian
Cuneiform script was also the true
work of genius and was one of the
human mind’s most masterly accom'
plishments and ranks with the greatest
scientific inventions. Someone de'
scribed the cuneiform writing on the
clay tablets as looking like the marks
left by a bird walking on wet sand,
and, in fact, many early archaeologists
thought it to be merely a form of
decoration. It was a German school'
teacher, Georg Friedrich Grotefend,
who made the original hypothesis that
finally laid the foundation for the solu'
tion which was ultimately greatly facili'
tated by the discovery of a “library” of
clay tablets dating back to the seventh
century B.C. that might have been
deliberately designed as aids to
scholars of posterity, for they con'
tained long listings in which the dif'
ferent phonetic values and meanings
of the ideogramatic script were co'
related with those of :the alphabetical
script. Finally, a prototype of the
encyclopaedic dictionary was found
containing pictures of various objects
used in religious and legal rites label'
led with their Sumerian and Semetic
names.
It is interesting to record that in
1857 the Royal Asiatic Society in
London sent a sealed envelope con'
taining a newly discovered, lengthy
Assyrian inscription to the four
greatest cuneiform experts of the day
-unknown to each of the others—
with a note urgently requesting its
decipherment.
The experts were Rawlmson,
Talbot, Hincks and Oppert, and
when their results were compared all
text f agreed on essential points,
and so the claims that the cuneiform
writing could now be freely read that
" a<a been so scoffed at by the public
were brilliantly vindicated.
Aztec and Mayan.
The final chapters are devoted to a
part of archaeological research that is
often neglected, being overshadowed
bv Egypt and Assyria—the Aztec and
Mayan cultures, lost for centuries in
the impenetrable jungles of Yucatan.
When the Spaniard Cortes and his
Conquistadores invaded Mexico they
found in the Aztec Kingdom, headed
by King Montezuma, a progressive
civilisation with a priesthood whose
knowledge of astronomy was amazing,
Unfortunately the Aztec religion had
one feature that repelled everyone
that encountered it the widespread
practice of human sacrifice which so
angered the devout Catholic Spaniards
that they proceeded by means of
treachery as well as great military
achievement to virtually wipe out this
remarkable people,
The vd j was then drawn over the
anc ient inhabitants of the American
continent until 1839, when John
Lloyd Stephens made the first dis'
coveries in Copan, in modern Hon'
duras. . When in 1842 his book
appeared, illustrated by superb draw'
j ngs by his companion, Frederick
Catherwood, which revealed this amaz'
j ng new cu l ture j n a h its grotesque
power, it caused a great sensation,
and t he p re( J om i na ting question in all
minds was where did these Indians
come from? Was it possible that a
unique society could have arisen in
the American continent in complete
isolation from the great cultural flow
of the Old World? Some claimed
that this was out of the question;
others that the Mayas were one of the
lost tribes of Israel: that they had
migrated via the Arctic Circle or by
a former “land bridge” from the Far
East, for did not some of their sculp'
tures bear a striking resemblance to
TRANSPORTING CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE.
The great granite obelisk that now stands on the Thames Embankment, London, and is known all over the
world as “Cleopatra’s Needle,’’ was encased in an iron cylinder on the foreshores at Alexandria rolled into
the sea and towed to England. It is seen here before it was jacked up and rolled into the water. It is 68’ 6"
high, 8’ 0” square at the base and weighs 180 tons. It was originally erected at Heliopolis in B.C. 1500.

statues of Hindu gods? Some even
claimed that the Mayas were survivors
from the legendary submerged island
of Atlantis.
Architecture Founded
On Calender.
As studv of the Mayan cities pro-
gressed it was found that every piece
of construction was part of a calender
in stone; there was not a single orna-
ment or relief, animal freize or sculp-
tured figure that was not directly re*
lated to some specific date: in other
words, the Mayan aesthetic had a
mathematical basis. It was also found
that the Mayan calender was the best
in the world and, although differently
constructed to ours, it was at the same
time more accurate; thus a year,
according to the Julian calender,
is 365.250000 days; the Gregorian
is 365.242500 days; the Mayan
365,242129 days, while modern
siderial reckoning is 365.242198 days.
But having produced the world’s
best calender they became its slaves,
for they did not raise their great
stepped structures for reasons of
utility or art, but in part because their
calender itself dictated the construe-
tion. Every five, ten or twenty years
they erected a new edifice which was
supplied with an appropriate birth
date. Often they built another pyra-
mid around one already standing to
mark a fresh interval of time, and
they did this for hundreds of years
with impeccable regularity, as shown
by the dates chiselled into the stone.
Mayan, Aztec and the Toltec people
who preceded them, all lived under
the Damoclean sword of their great
calender cycles, as for example when
they believed that the world came to
an end every fifty-two years, and the
oower of the priesthood depended on
the universal acceptance of such ideas,
they alone being able to avert such
disasters by shocking human sacrifices.
The Sacred Well
of Chichen-Itza.
Which brings us to the final thrill-
ing tale of the “hazy archaeologists’’ in
the person of American Edward
Thompson, who discovered the sacred
well at Chichen-Itza, in Yucatan,
where legend had it that the priests,
to appease the angry gods, after a
solemn ceremony, cast “beautiful
maidens” into the dark and forbidding
“Well of Sacrifice.” He dragged
cranes and grabs through the steam-
ing jungle and after moving many
tons of mud and debris from the bot-
tom of the lake went down in a
divine suit and found plenty of
obsidian knives, resin incense and
other ornaments as well as many
female skeletons to prove the macabre
truth of yet another legend from
centuries long past.
One male skeleton was found, and
he speculates that at least one of the
screaming women was able to drag
her priestly tormentor to share her
doom.
New Searches in Old Empires.
Is there anything of significance
still left to find? The author thinks
there is, and in his final chapter,
“New Searches in Old Empires,” he
outlines new dreams of present-day
archaeologists who, inspired by the
challenge of the enigmas of these
ancient civilisations and the adventure
of the explorotion, like hoary old
prospectors, always dream of the next
great find. That this is not idle specu'
lation is emphasised by the fact that
in 1949 three expeditions were or-
ganised to investigate a Turkish
peasant’s report that he had seen the
remains of Noah’s ark on Mount
Ararat and by the romantic adventure
of the young Norwegian explorer Thor
Heyerdahl, who in 1947, to prove a
connection between Inca culture and
the island culture of the South Seas,
sailed in 101 days from the Peruvian
port of Callao across the Pacific to
one of the Tuamotu islands, his ves-
sel being a raft built in Inca style
and named Kon-Tiki, after the Sun
god.
Mr. Ceram has indeed made the
past live.

NEW CLARK KILN BRICKMAKING PLANT
NOW ESTABLISHED IN AUSTRALIA
Circle System Will Speed Brick Production
Though a common structural material, brick is the most remark-
able one in use in the building industry. It is remarkable historically,
technically, and artistically. It’s history goes back to the earliest times
in the civilization of man, and it bears on its surface written records
of early ages that are most valuable.
Though many new and successful building materials have been
tried during the past few years, the ordinary brick—a little block of
baked clay—still remains the most widely used and most durable unit
for building construction.
Today the Clark kiln method, de'
veloped in the United States, has re'
suited in a compact plant, a simplified
and economical operation and flexible
production. Its recent introduction
to Australia is of great importance
and interest to the national building
industry.
Development of Process.
A brief history of the new Clark
kiln at Moorebank and its background
will be of great interest to “Con'
struction” readers.
Prior to the middle 1930’s bricks
made in the “Deep South” of the
U.S.A. by cheap Negro labour were
imported to Northern States to sell
in competition with the highecpriced
locally'made brick.
However, industrial laws granting
equal pay to both black and white
labour put “finis” to this state of af'
fairs.
A brilliant American engineer, Mr.
John Clark, who was Sales Manager
of the Washington (D.C.) Brick Co.,
developed the Circle system of brick'
making.
This revolutionary plant reduced
the need of manual labour to a mini-
mum, and speeded up production to
give a much greater output than
similar-sized plants.
Drying Method.
At the Muirkirk plant of the
Washington Brick Company, where
the development work began in 1937,
the brick is dried on the Clark kiln
floor by simply drawing heated air
from under the cooling hood from
■underground flues and exhausting it
through the floor openings. Moisture
is thrown off directly into the atmos'
phere and fan corrosion and other
typical maintenance of enclosed driers
are avoided.
The Clark kiln which has been
erected at Moorebank, N.S.W., will
be in full production by April.
With the circular system of operation,
the brick which is being manufactured
is not handled by workers until the
time it becomes a finished product for
delivery.
Only 40 men, including; non-pro-
ducing and administrative staff, are
needed to produce 65,000 bricks
per day, each brick being 9” x 4|”
x 3”.
New Plant Is Unique.

the storage wharf to boot of bucket elevator (rated at 20 tons per hour). The coke is used
as fuel of a 10ft. Wellman Jalusha Gas Producer. It is interesting to note that the 18in.
4-ply belts were selected for purposes of uniformity of conveyors, idlers, etc., throughout the
whole brickmaking plant.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING
March 24, 1953.


Australia is the new plant erected by
Clark Kilns (N.S.W.) Pty. Ltd. at
Moorebank.
The raw materials (clay and shale)
are present on the 108'acre property
in such quantities that, it is estimated,
there is sufficient for at least 100 years
continuous manufacturing.
The clay for brickmaking will be
won and prepared by conventional
methods. A tractor and scoop will be
employed to develop the pit, and ma'
terial delivered to a spacious storage
area (and protected from the elements
by a roof) will supply the wet'weather
needs of the plant when the pit is
not workable.
The clay and shale is mixed in an
even feeder, then passed through a
bar disintegrator and smooth rolls to
an inclined belt conveyor (see illus'
tration) which delivers the material
to the brickmaking machines.
The foregoing process is a con'
ventiona) method of preparing clay
and shale to suit local conditions, and
is entirely independent of the
“Circle” where the bricks are made,
dried and burnt.
Kiln Building.
The Clark kiln, of 160 feet diam'
eter, is housed in a timberTramed
building 188 feet square, covered with
corrugated iron. This building is re'
markable in that, although the frame
is of timber, only one centre support
is used in the 188 feet square struc'
ture (see illustration).
Construction Details.
The outside steel columns are 15
feet high, V 6” square at 46 ft.
centres. Timber trusses 8 ft. deep
span between these columns. Across
the centre, two trusses, 12 ft. x 8 ft.
x 92 ft. long and weighing over 12
tons each, support bowed arches 90
ft. long on either side. The top chord
of these arches is a Isin. x 6in. lam'
inated timber member, Sin. x 2in. pur'
lins, 14ft. long at 4ft. centres, support
the roof covering.
Circle System.
The Circle System incorporates a
central turntable, 50ft. in diameter,
on which is mounted the brick'mak'
ing machinery supplied with the raw
material by the Dunlop rubber belt
conveyor, (operating at 200 feet per
min. with a capacity of 100 tons per
hour) which is located overhead (see
illustration).
Of great interest is the J. C. Steele
70E de-airing machine. This is a
combined pug mixer and extruder with
a capacity of upwards of 20,000
bricks per hour —possibly the largest
in the world —but certainly by far the
largest in Australia. 350 horsepower
is required to drive the machine. In
conjunction with it, a wire'cutter has
been installed. This machine is cap'
able of handling the output, whatever
the rate of operation, and it cuts the
clay column at the rate of 13 bricks
per cut. It is automatically operated.
without any manual assistance on the
part of an attendant.
An off'bearing conveyor carries the
“green” bricks from the machines to
the “segments” or stationary kiln'
floors where the bricks are set. Sep'
arate movable hoods are provided for
preheating, burning and cooling the
brick.
THe centre hood is fitted with gas
burners and the products of combus'
tion are drawn off by “down'draft”
and passed through the circulating
ducts by high'temperature fans
(I6OO°F. working temperature), to
the preheating hood where they pass
through the stacked bricks to the at'
mosphere in the “up-draft” direction.
The cooling hood controls the drop
in temperature of the bricks which
have been burnt and air is drawn
“down'draft” through the setting of
bricks, by other high'temperature
fans, then pass up through settings
of bricks in yet another segment to
utilize the hot air for drying.
At predetermined intervals kiln
hoods and fans are moved around the
circle through one segment leaving the
finished product ready to be loaded
directly upon delivery trucks.
Man-Power Saved.
A particular feature is the reduc-
tion in manual labour achieved by
mechanisation and this is advanced
further by the electrical design of
the plant.
Instruments record the temperature
and other conditions of operation con'
tinuously, and the whole plant is con'
trolled from a centrally situated con'
sole, from which an extensive view
of the whole plant is obtained.
Plant Capacity.
The crushing and conveying equip'
ment is capable of preparing 100 tons
of raw material per hour.
At top capacity the brickmaking
equipment could manufacture 20,000
bricks per hour, but the kiln hoods
are rated at 65,000 each, so moving
them every 24 hours, the rated capac'
ity of the plant would be 455,000
bricks per week.
Electrical Controls.
All controls are push'button,
“Start” and “Stop.” The crushers,
etc., in the Clay'Preparation building
are wired up so that a number of but'
tons are used in their correct order
to get the plant under way. Similar'
ly on the turntable all machines are
controlled from a push'button console
station. In both cases a “Stop'All”
button is used for emergency.
All electrical power is controlled
from a substation where contactor'
gear and the main switchboard is
under the control of an electrical em

gineer. At present 1/500 and 1/250
kVA transformers are installed, and
provision has been made for altera-
tions and additions dependent upon
power demand. The power is sup'
plied at 11,000 volts.
The total rating of the plant will
be approximately 850 h.p.
Producer Gas.
Unlike other kilns fired with coal,
etc., with large piles of fuel scattered
over the yard, the Clark kiln em-
ploys producer gas, supplied from a
10ft. agitator-type Wellman Galusha
Producer of the latest design.
This gas producer can make 300,000
cubic ft. of producer gas (130 BTU/
cub. ft.) per hour but the demand
will not require this amount.
The fuel is stored on a concrete
wharf which feeds directly on to a
rubber belt conveyor discharging into
a bucket elevator. The producer, of
the mechanical type, is automatically
controlled throughout, with instru-
ments continuously recording the op-
erating conditions.
The gas supply is piped through a
30in. diameter steel main to a 25in.
circular main within the kiln circle.
Costly and unsatisfactory valves were
eliminated from the gas-line and con-
trol and cut-off of the gas supply is
effected through water seals.

300 Ft. Diameter Arena Covered Without Internal Columns
DRAMATIC CONCRETE STRUCTURE.
Oblique Concrete Arches Carry Steel Catenary Roof.
Not a single column will obstruct
the view from the stands of the 300
ft. diameter livestock judging pavilion
now being built at the North Carolina
State Fair Grounds, Raleigh. The
roof will be suspended on steel strands
strung from the outer walls.
A pair of reinforced concrete arches
on top of the walls will take the cat'
enary pull of the wires. The arches
in turn, rest on slender concrete col-
umns, which take the vertical.
The designers believe this unique
structural framing to be highly effi'
cient for it utilizes construction ma-
terials to their best advantage—con-
crete in compression and high-strength
steel in tension.
Cost figures appear to bear out this
contention for the building is being
erected for $1 300,000, which aver-
ages between 35 and 40 c per cu. ft.
of space enclosed, or about $l3O per
seat.
The structure will contain concrete
stands with permanent seating for
5.500 and temporary seats for 4,500.
The cable-supported roof over this
large unobstructed area will consist
of insulated, cellular steel decking and
built-up roofing. Following the nat-
ural sag of the cables, which form a
rectangular grid, the roof will assume
the shape of a saddle.
The pair of arches that support the
roof are oblique in shape. They lie
in planes in opposite directions at
an angle of about 25 degrees with
the horizontal. The arches are 14
feet deep in the sloping plane and
30 in. wide, but are coffered on the
under side to keep their weight down.
Rising to a height of 85 ft. at their
apexes, they intersect 25 ft. above
grade, then continue down to termin'
ate in concrete abutments.
It was designed by W. H. Deitrick,
architect Raleigh, from an original de'
sign by the late Matthew Nowicki.
Severud-Elstad-Krueger, of New York
City, are the consulting engineers.

eral contractor.

DRAMATIC CONSTRUCTION.
The New York and San Francisco Fairs held in the years immediately preceding World War II. featured all
types of unusual and dramatic methods of construction which would never have been contemplated for “everyday”
use. Today we see these striking conceptions coming into their own as in the opposing arches that sweep in
graceful curves on top of the wall columns of this livestock arena at Raleigh, North Carolina. Steel cables
strung between them will support a saddle-shaped roof deck.

RUSSIA STEPS UP BUILDING
ONE HUNDRED NEW TOWNS TO BE BUILT IN FIVE YEARS.
By ACADEMICIAN SHCHUSEV,
Of the Soviet Governmen t Architectural Commission.
The illustrations to this article were
taken from an exhibition at Dorland
Hall. Lower Regent Street, London.
From the architectural point of view
there was particular interest in the dif
ferent types of building to be seen in
different parts of the vast Union.
Soviet architects have applied the
principle “national in form socialist
in content” to the buildings which
they have designed; that is to say,
they have endeavoured to combine
Western technique with their own tra'
ditional decoration, and to apply ad'
vances in technical knowledge to the
type of building found by experience
to suit particular climatic conditions.
For many years they have stressed
the value of using local materials, be'
cause in these can best be expressed
the national tradition of different parts
of the Union, and, of course, the need
to economise materials and transport
in repairing war damage has given an
additional stimulus to this movement.
The exhibition as a whole provided
a background for the understanding
of these different styles, since it show'
ed in detail the contrasting condition
of life in a subcontinent, from the
arctic north to the torrid south.
Commenting on the exhibition, the
well-known British Trade Journal
“Building” stated: “The exhibition
answered no questions about what is
being done in Russia now, and for
the majority of us Russia is still as
much a land of mysterv as ever. The
Russian architectural magazines con'
tain plans of different types of houses,
even as do our own magazines, but
these seem to consist chiefly of pro'
jects without any photographs of ac'
tual erections being available.”
This overall planning will not
bring sou Mess standardisation. The
standardised building which makes a
city boring and characterless and
causes one city to look like all others
will be avoided. The people must
love their city for its characteristic ar'
chitectupe ... a variety of national
forms is characteristic of our multi'
national state. Our architects must
reflect our rich heritage, the style
of sunlit Uzbekistan, the wealth of or'
nament in Georgia the monuments in
Armenia, the stern majesty of ancient
Russia, and the classicism of Lenin'
grad. The centre of Stalingrad will
represent the power and majesty of
that heroic city. Reconstructed Nov'
gorod will preserve its historic fea'
tures. Sebastopol will be turned into
a naval port worthy of its past. Mos'
cow will show more than ever the
beauty of its squares and streets.
Measures have recently been taken
to speed up supplies of building ma-'
terial in order to carry out the archi'
plans. To enable architect Ala'
byan’s plans for a new Stalingrad to
be executed, the responsibility for ot'
ganising supplies is henceforth to be
borne by the State Planning Com'
mission. The Commissariat of Build'
ing established five housing combines
for producing prefabricated one'Storey
houses. Collective farms are being
encouraged to help by making bricks.
The trade union movement has organ'
ised carpenters masons, stove build'
ers and roofing workers in every fac'
tory in districts where more than ten
houses are being built.

flux of new workers during the war,
has set an example of how to over'
come obstacles. Building brigades
there were accustomed to team work
on big construction jobs and at first
they found it difficult to switch over
to building individual houses. So the
factory engineering department decid'
ed to make residential building as sim'
ilar as possible to industrial building.
Concrete was used not only in the
form of breeze blocks, but in single
blocks forming an entire wall.
These highly responsible men are
united in their desire to build and
rebuild in a manner that suits local
styles, tradition, and climate. The
U.S.S.R.’s new cities are unlikely to
have that cosmopolitan appearance
that was so characteristic of building
between the wars. Kolli, for example,
is taking immense pains to rebuild
Kalinin (ancient Tver) in a style de-
rived from its 18th century and Rus'
sian Empire original which was so
cruelly smashed in 1941.

PAINT IN TUBES.
“Mix It Yourself” Scheme.
New British Development.
A scheme for manufacturing tubes
containing all the colours necessary
to produce the 999 shades included
on the firm’s colour chart, so that
users may do their own colour mixing,
is to be put into operation by Jenson
and Nicholson Ltd., makers of Rob'
bialac paints.
Idea behind the scheme is to cut
the amount of capital held in stocks
of paint by retail stockists. From
March 2 this year those in the Great'
er London and Home Counties area
will only need to hold the company’s
white or grey paints and the tubes
of colour; these tubes will be grad'
ed in size, so that a certain of tube
mixed with a given quantity of the
white or grey paint will produce a
guaranteed shade and intensity.
For the time being, owing to pro'
duction and other difficulties, the tubes
will only be supplied to stockists in
the London and Home Counties area,

BUILDING CONTROL.

AUSTRALIAN BUILDING
AND INDUSTRY.
Huge Expenditure of New Capital.
Huge sums continued to be spent
on new buildings and capital equip'
ment by Australian industry in the
second half of 1952.
Both manufacturing and non-man-
ufacturing industries showed a decline,
however, in capital expenditure in that
period compared with the first half
of the year.
Between the second half of 1951
and the first half of 1952, new capital
expenditure by manufacturing indus-
tries rose from £60,200,000 to
£68,600,000. In the last half of 1952
new capital expenditure receded slight-
ly to £65,500,000.
In the last half of 1951 capital ex-
penditure by nommanufacturing in'
dustries amounted to £36,100,000.
It rose to .£42,700,000 in the first
half of 1952 and then slipped back
to £38,600,000 in the second half
of that year.
Gas and electricity industries and
engineering were the only sections of
the economy to record increases in
the second half of 1952. Capital ex-
penditure on engineering rose by
£4,100,000 and in gas and electricity
by £1,400,000.
There have been steady increases
in new capital expenditure since
1948, implying that industry is main'
taining its efficiency and keeping
pace with expansion in population and
consumer demands.
In 1948, expendituse on new
equipment and plant was £93,000,000.
In 1951, it was £184,000,000, and
last year reached £215,100,000.

New Nurses’ Home at Brisbane Women’s
Hospital
OFFICIALLY OPENED ON MARCH 1st, 1953.
The contemplation of the vast new
hospitals and their appurtenant build'
ings in every city, while giving the
assurance of due consideration for the
sick and the nursing staffs, must,
nevertheless, provide food for thought
as to why the health of humans
should be so much worse than that of
che lower animals in these allegedly
progressive times.
In the aggregate, the hospital blocks
in Brisbane are stupendous for a city
of less than half a million people, even
while excepting the large blocks of
maternity hospitals that are in quite
another category. Gone are the days
when any kind of crowded living quar'
ters sufficed for nurses’ accommodation,
and the authorities know that in order
to attract suitable young women into
the nursing profession the living
amenities must be more than decent
in every respect.
Such conditions are found in the
new Nurses’ Quarters in the General
Hospital’s area, Bowen Bridge Road,
the official opening of the main wing
of which took place on Sunday, Ist
March. This building, to accom'
modate 225 nurses, will have cost
£350,000 when completed. As such
buildings are financed from the profits
derived from the “Golden Caskets”
drawn every few days, the jibe that
the population lives from “Casket to
Casket” is not altogether inappro'
priate.
Of course, the whole number of
rooms, of which each nurse occupies
one exclusively, cannot be made avail'
able immediately; but following the
number of 108 nurses who will, the
remainder should be accommodated
within one month as beds and fur-
nishings are installed.
This fine modern Nurses’ Home
has been erected on the lawn at the
Northern boundary of the hospital
property, and located so as to preserve
as much of the present lawn as pos'
sible, both for the use of the nurses
living in the home and for the general
appearance of the lawn and the out'
look on to it from the hospital.
Every effort will be made to prc
serve the atmosphere of a home. Each
nurse will have her own room, which
will be tastefully decorated and fur'
nished with modern design furniture
comprising bed with bed'head reading
light, built-in wardrobe specially de'
signed to accommodate the clothing
necessary for a nurse whether at work
or play, built'in dressing table, and an
easy chair; in almost every instance
bedrooms will open out on to wide
cantilever balconies.
Floors of bedrooms will be of
polished hardwood with rugs suitably
placed, and each room will be pro'
vided with a basin having hot and
cold water, also an electric power out'
let to which may be attached a radio
or other electrical appliance.
On each floor will be large lounges
and writing rooms, also kitchenettes
for preparing light refreshments; and
laundryettes for light washing; laum
dryette in incompleted wing will have
steam'heated drying'room adjacent to
same.
A large modernly decorated Recrea'
tion Room is located on the Ground
Floor, and will be suitable for dancing
and functions to which male friends
of nurses may be invited.
Two passenger lifts, complete with
all the latest attachments for efficient
operation will be installed, also a ser'
vice lift for linen, etc.
All the nurses in the home will be
under the direction of a Home Sister,
who will live in the home in a special
suite on the Ground Floor.
Structurally, the building has rein'
forced concrete frame of fireproof con'
struction finished externally with face
brickwork to match the Women’s
Hospital nearby.

New Liverpool Project.
Tysons (Contractors) Ltd., Liver'

first stage of Liverpool’s <£1,000,000
Corn Exchange building.
The first instalment, valued at just
under £200,000. provides for a com'
plete unit of four floors, containing
offices, four shops and other facilities.
It is due to be completed by July,
1954. Prior to this date, tenders will
be invited for the central market and
exchange block, for which the designs
incorporate a two'Storey car park.
Prestressed concrete is to be used
throughout the entire scheme, thus
minimising the need for brick and
steelwork.

”IN TWENTY-ONE YEARS”
By Mr. O. W. HUMPHREYS, B.Sc., F.Inst.P., M.I.E.E.
Director, General Electric Company, Research Laboratories, England.
Twenty-one years may appear a
very long or a very short period of
time. It all depends on one’s point
of view. To the child growing up
it seems a millennium; to the research
worker probing ever deeper into the
mysteries of our world, a brief span
which may yield one—or if he is
very lucky—perhaps two really im-
portant discoveries.
Let us cast our minds back. What
was happening twenty-one years ago?
Depression was about to strike Britain
and then, more severely, the United
otales. The Empire State Building
in New York was latest wonder
of construction; the “Queen Mary
was laid down but was to remain part-
2 , k 7~j S V ° U see * r ° m L here—a
blank shadow over Clydebank, for
some years until times recovered; the
bydney Harbour Bridge was nearing
completion. was still a great
adventure. “Talkies’’ were just ceas-
ing to be novelties and silent films
were still shown. Colour films had
not arrived, and television was a
scientist s dream. It sounds like the
dark ages. ...
Lighting engineers had to exercise
all their ingenuity on the application
ot the tungsten filament lamp; the
°ZI practicable electric lamp at that
time. i he coiled coil filament was
known but was not yet made. Neon
tubes were used for signs, but their
use for lighting was still to come;
there were no high pressure mercury
vapour lamps, no sodium lamps, no
fluorescent lamps no arguments
either as to which was best suited to
some special purpose; in fact no
really useful linear light sources ex-
cept the inefficient architectural strip
tungsten lamp.
But with such lamps as he had the
lighting engineer worked hard. It
was a great period for floodlighting;
during that year, one of the most
spectacular displays ever arranged took
place in London and other British
cities to mark the visit of the C.I.E.
to England.
In interior lighting, architectural
lighting was the latest thing, and we
saw wonderful luminous ceilings and
illuminated features in public build-
ings particularly in America.
In street lighting, discussion in
Britain centred on the 8.5.1. Speci-
fication. The new version had just
been published. The true significance
°* minimu m and test-point Alumina-
tion was much debated. Flame arcs
were still used, and in Britain gas was
still in serious competition with elec-
tricity.
Photoelectric photometers were in
an early and unreliable stage of de-
velopment and visual methods were
still almost exclusively employed
The lighting of the period par-
ticularly the interior lighting was of-
ten very well done. The absence of
the present multiplicity of light
sources imposed restrictions yet many
installations of that period might well
have been designed today. "'Maybe
that is only another way of saying
that we do not now know much more
about lighting interiors than we did
21 years ago; maybe it means that
we know the whole story and have
little more to learn except how to
achieve results more cheaply I don’t
think so. I think we have made pro-
gress—l also think that we still have
a long way to go The difficulty is
that lighting is part science part art*
we need a breed of lighting engineers
knowledgable in both fields
New Lamps.
Lighting obviously implies light
sources. The good illuminating en-
gineer can achieve results in many
ways, using such sources as are to
hand. But add new sources and his
versatility has added scope. Certain-
ly the past 21 years have given him
all the opportunity he could desire,

March 24 1953.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


In November. 1931. J. Swinburne,
F.R.S., addressing the I.E.S. on the
early history of the electric lamp,
concluded: “What the next step will
be Ido not know. Most likely it will
be in the direction of utilizing some
form of electron discharge.” He was
a good prophet. In the following
year, 1932, the first public street light-
ing installation using high pressure
mercury vapour lamps was installed in
the Watford Road at Wembley and
Harrow. Here we saw the first lan-
tern ever designed to accommodate
the 400 W H.P.M.V. lamp. Almost
simultaneously the first sodium instal-
lation appeared on the Continent.
The illuminating engineers now found
themselves with cheaper light. They
no longer had to eke out a little flux
over a large area; they could really
concern themselves with lighting in
the broad sense —as indeed they did.
The mercury and sodium lamps shar-
ed the advantage of high efficiency;
and it was almost their only virtue;
from the points of view of colour,
cost, simplicity and ease of applica-
tion the tungsten lamp was superior.
But economy in operation is of great
importance and mercury and sodium
lamps enabled standards of lighting to
be achieved economically which were
quite out of the reach of the tungsten
lamp and still more so of the gas
lamps. Their introduction revolution-
ised lighting and their ultimate effect
cannot yet be estimated.
The new lamps certainly got “no
marks” for colour rendering. They
were suitable for use only in situa-
tions in which colour and colour
rendering were of secondary import-
ance; for interiors they were used
only in heavy-engineering shops,
where their influence on lighting
practice was not marked. Efforts
were made to improve the colour, the
first being the introduction of other
metals to the H.P.M.V. lamp, then
attempts were made to use fluorescent
materials on the outer jacket. But
these were only palliatives, and at that
time little progress was made.
In other directions fluorescent ma-
terials were used with more success.
Cold-cathode high-voltage tubes, pre-
viously used exclusively for advertis-
ing and some forms of decorative
lighting, became efficient light sources.
Just before the war, good interior
lighting was possible using a combin-
ation of mercury and neon tubes each
coated with fluorescent material on the
inner wall of the discharge tube itself.
Very shortly afterwards the develop-
ment of the zinc beryllium silicate
fluorescent powder enabled a good
white light to be obtained at high ef-
ficiency from a single tube.
It was a relatively short step to the
introduction of the hot-cathode, and
the mains voltage, fluorescent lamp,
the lamp now so familiar to all of us.
was upon us.
Here was a lamp which offered to
interior lighting the benefits which
the H.P.M.V. and sodium lamps had
already conferred on exterior light'
ing. Their effect has been profound.
In Britain the war restricted devel-
opment to the SOW lamp, and its use
to factories where it proved invalu'
able. In the U.S.A. it was develop'
ed in many sizes and used for many
purposes. With the end of the war
the fluorescent lamp—having already
produced a revolution in interior
lighting comparable with that which
the earlier discharge lamps caused in
exterior lighting—broke bounds and
entered the field of exterior lighting
also.
Today there is a great variety of
low-pressure fluorescent lamps both
hot and cold cathode, of lengths from
six inches to nine feet, varying in
brightness and in colour. Colour in'
deed presents a problem: how to
choose from the vast range technically
possible: when to strike the balance
between the conflicting claims of effi'
ciency and good colour rendering.
At present several different shades of
near white are offered commercially,
the selection varying in different
countries; and coloured lamps are
also available for decoration. Efficien'
cies up to four times that of the tung'
sten lamp, and lives more than five
times as long, have already been
achieved. Many different circuits and
starting arrangements are possible.
The development of high'pressure
lamps has been continued in parallel
with that of the low-pressure fluores-
cent lamp. Compact-source types
have been produced giving very small
sources of exceedingly high bright'
ness, some colour-corrected so effec'
tively that they can be used success-
fully for making colour films. High
powered lamps have been introduced
for high-bay lighting in factories and
special lamps for photographic work
such as azo-dye printing and photo-
graphic enlarging. Very recent de-
velopments in fluorescent powders
have made it possible for the light
output from the smaller H.P.M.V.
lamps to be so enriched at the red
end of the spectrum that these lamps
now give an excellent white light
which may eventually challenge the
low-pressure lamp in many applica-
tions.
We also have the “gas-arc.” giv-
ing a good white light at high power;
flash lamps in which the duration of
the discharge has been reduced to a
few microseconds; and zirconium arcs
giving a light source of a few thous-
andths of an inch in diameter. And
I must mention that during the war
we produced at Wembley the largest
artificial source of light made by man
—a carbon arc lamp of 600 kW.
Some of the lamps I have mentioned
are experimental, some for special
purposes only. Many others could be
added to the list were the lamp mak-
er assured of sufficient demand to
make their development and produc-
tion worth while.
Certainly the lighting engineer can
complain of no shortage of sources.
Let us now see what use he has made
of them.
Photometry.
New lamps would be of but limited
use if we could not measure their
light outputs, their colour appearance
and their colour rendering properties.
Without this ability it would indeed
be impossible properly to control the
production of the lamp. The evolu-
tion of techniques for making these
measurements has fully extended the
photometrician.
Twenty-one years ago nearly all
photometry was visual. Photoelectric
apparatus had been used for a few
years in the laboratory and some com'
mercial instruments had been devel-
oped, using both vacuum and gas-fill-
ed photoemissive cells; but their re'
liability was only just being establish'
ed. Electronic circuits were so far
little developed. There were few
cathode ray oscillographs. Photomul-
tipliers were not known; neither were
photovoltaic cells nor the many con'
venient illumination meters and ex'
possure meters which are common'
place today. The standard of light still
resided largely in carbon filament
lamps; the team at the Bureau of
Standards had just completed the first
realisation of the Waidner'Burgess pro'
posed standard of a black body at the
freezing point of platinum. There
were some problems in heterochro'
matic photometry, but they arose only
from the colour differences of tung'
sten filaments operating at various
colour temperatures. In laboratory
work, lamps were nearly always run
on direct current for convenience and
stability.
The early 1930’s was a period of
much development in standards ap'
paratus, and methods. The C.I.E.
“visibility curve” (i.e._ the curve of
relative spectral luminous efficiency)
was officially adopted as the basis of
heterochromatic photometry in 1931.
The new Primary Standard of candle'
power was agreed by the C.I.E. in
1939 with the necessary changes in
photometric magnitudes but the
change was postponed owing to the
war, and was not made until 1948.
Considerable effort has been devot'
ed to the development of photoelectric
cells of various kinds. The photomet'
rician—using these cells—has evolved
standard photoelectric photometers of
the highest accuracy and stability. The

modern photoelectric control table
i shows the unity of thought which ex-
perience enables us to bring to the
design. This particular apparatus,
with its 1 metre integrating sphere
is used for precision routine measure-
ments of tungsten lamps and the small-
er sizes of discharge lamps. When
it is required to measure the light
[output of large lamps, we must use
a larger sphere. In the laboratories
we use a 12ft. sphere and a very
sensitive Universal photometer. Vir-
tually photometric laboratories in
themselves, these photometers measure
so little light as 1CH 10 lumen, that is
about the amount of starlight falling
upon 1/10,000 of a square inch. With
the aid of photomultiplier cells even
greater sensitivity is obtainable, but
at some cost in stability. Equipment
like this has opened up new possibil-
ities in the sphere of photometry.
Things can now be done which were
previously quite impossible. For ex-
ample we can made spectrophoto-
metric measurements of the light from
a small lamp in a photometric inte-
grator. using a small slit. Or, using
suitable optical screening we can ac-
curately measure the light from a
I,OOOW. bare lamp at a range of
1,500 ft. in full daylight.
It was at the beginning of the per-
iod under review that the C.I.E. sys-
tem of colorimetry was adopted. The
visual colorimeters of that time were
specialised and empirical instru-
ments; the C.I.E. system gave them
a common basis. Colorimetry and
photometry were, furthermore, separ-
ate arts. The C.I.E. system showed
that there was common ground be-
tween the two; but for a long time
there remained a gap, bridged only
by calculation. It was not until 1946
that Winch produced an apparatus
which combined the functions of pho-
tometer and colorimeter, and thereby
demonstrated the principle, inherent
in the C.I.E. system that photometry
was in fact a part of colorimetry. In
his instrument the light is dispersed
into a spectrum and passed through
a very accurate mask whereby the
various wavelengths are appropriate-
ly weighted. The masks take rather
curious forms permitting accurate
measurements to be made of strongly
coloured lights including light having
a line spectrum, and direct measure-
ments to be made in terms of the
C.I.E. trichromatic coefficients with-
out mathematical transformations. It
can also be used to assess colour-
rendering properties, and, if neces-
sary, for spectrophometry. The ap-
paratus, although complex, is com-
pact.
Another spectacular instrument, the
Hardy recording spectrophotometer
was perfected in the U.S.A. in 1935.
This automatically plots a spectropho-
tometric curve of a sample of colour-
ed material or of a light, in a few
seconds, and to a high accuracy: from
this curve the C.I.E, coefficients can
be calculated.
With such equipment we can now
safely undertake the photometry of
light sources having the very diverse
spectra of modern sources. The ser-
ious error inevitable with visual meth-
ods is a thing of the past. For com-
mercial accuracies filters are available
which correct the response of photo-
cells and enable a close approximation
of the C.I.E. spectral luminous effi-
ciency curve to be obtained.
These instruments —as elegant in
conception as they are accurate in
performance—are for the standardis-
ing laboratory. The illuminating en-
gineer requires simpler tools. He
now has portable instruments using
the photovoltaic cells, which will give
him an indication on a pointer in-
strument —which is what he wants —of

Olympic House, Ashford, Adelaide
This attractive building was purchased by the Olympic organisation and altered to suit its pur-
pose. It houses the administrative staff of the three companies, i.e., Olympic Tyre & Rubber
Company Ltd., Olympic General Products Pty. Ltd., and Olympic Cables Limited. Behind
the premises a steel and concrete warehouse with a storage capacity of 12,000 feet was
erected. The adapting of the two-storey building and the building of the new warehouse
was carried out by C. H. Martin Ltd., of Adelaide, the work being done under the super-
vision of Mr. M. H. King Architect, of Melbourne, with Mr. Colin Hassell, of Adelaide,
as Consulting Architect. The somewhat unusual decorative sign was the design and manu-
facture, on the companies suggestions, by the Cyclone Company of Australia, and the sign
writing was carried out by the Elder Sign Company of Adelaide.

the illumination reaching the cell.
Early cells were inaccurate and in'
sensitive; but they have been much
improved. Cells are now available
with an output of 500 microamps per
lumen, which exhibit small fatigue
and whose temperature and cosine er'
rors are small. Only the spectral sen'
sitivity remains uncorrected, and this
can often be closely corrected by fib
ters.
In the latest instruments both the
cosine error and the spectral sensb
tivity have been brought within ac'
ceptable limits. With instruments of
this type the light distribution of
lighting equipment can be rapidly
photometised, and illumination sur'
veys can readily be made. They are
indeed the principal tool of the ib
luminating engineer.
Nevertheless, visual photometers
still have many uses. There are some
circumstances in which even the most
sensitive photoelectric equipment is
not as good as the dark adapted eye.
The war produced some interesting
problems in photometry. One of my
colleagues disported himself at a
height of 30,000 feet in an aeroplane
to determine the polar curve of light
scattered by a volume of air less than
a cubic inch at that altitude. The
apparatus used, called a nephelometer
was mounted on a balloon car. A
narrow beam of light is projected from
the lamp house and its brightness
• measured at various angles with a
visual photometer. The nephelometer
was used up to 1000 ft. in the bah
loon and up to 30,000 ft. in a Web
lington aircraft. On other occasions
measurements were made of the
brightness of a 40ft. square target
on the ground from a height of 20,000
ft., and of the brightness of the
ground as seen from the air at night
in the blackout. In the latter cir'
cumstances the brightness was some'
times only one or two millionths of a
foot lambert. All these measure'
ments were made visually on quite
simple apparatus; admittedly not to a
very great precision.
Street Lighting.
Now let us turn from the light
sources themselves to their applica'
tion, and let us first consider street
lighting—-
Good street lighting was possible
21 years ago. That it was sometimes
achieved is proved by the installation
on the Thames Embankment. But
generally speaking it was only for im'
portant thoroughfares, such as the
Embankment, that the relatively high
cost of good lighting could be afford'
ed.
Perhaps the most important effect
of the mercury and sodium lamps was
that they made proper street lighting
much more widely possible and its
investigation, therefore, worth while.
In Britain these researches were given
an added impetus by the setting up
of the Departmental Committee of
the Ministry of Transport on Street
Lighting, a committee which itself also
fostered much experimental work. One
result was a concentration of research
effort on the lighting of streets with
the result that this was the first branch
of lighting to break away from the
tradition of illumination as the basis
of all lighting, and to take due notice
of what became recognised as the
real basis, namely, brightness—or, as
I am told I must now say. luminance.
It is interesting that it was in Britain,
where the minimum illumination of
the street surface had for years been
given such prominence, that the
brightness engineering of street light'
ing was first worked out —it has been
developed there more completely than
in any other country and for street
lighting more thoroughly than for any
other application. We elucidated the
mechanism of silhouette vision, meas'
ure*d the complex four'dimensional re'
flection properties of road surfaces,
studied the light distributions neces'
sary to co'operate with them, and
evolved simple rules for spacing and
planning whereby installation could
be simply designed without involving
the engineers in overwhelming com'
plexity. This is most important. Per'
haps the outstanding feature of the
modern work on street lighting has
been the success which has rewarded
the scientific treatment of problems
which in so many respects are highly
subjective—the introduction to an art
of practical specification and control.
Studies of the mechanism of vision
and the effects of coloured lights and
work on discomfort glare and on re'
vealing power was initiated by the
street lighting investigations. Inter'
esting and important work has been
done in Holland, France and America,
as well as the work in Great Britain.
In Britain, street lighting has made
great progress. Although our island
is small, we have now well over 3.000
miles of main streets lighted by dis'
charge lamps; and I think it can fair'
ly be said that our general standard
of street lighting is unequalled any'
where in the world. To get the best
out of the new lamps, new lanterns
have had to be developed. The con'
trol of the light output is a complex
subject involving a well developed
mathematical approach. The very
varied series of lanterns now avail'
able to the street lighting engineer is
evidence of the thoroughness with
which the problem has been tackled.
The coming of long lamps, used both
horizontally and vertically, has result'
ed in great variety of fittings, as de'
signers feel their way in the use of
these unfamiliar sources. This is in'
teresting, because in other countries,
in spite of extensive street lighting
development, the tendency is to con'
centrate on a few types of equipment.
This is particularly so in the U.S.A.
Of special interest for the lighting
of one'way and double'carriageway
roads is the Unidirectional System. By
taking account of the properties of
road surfaces this system achieves
great economy while at the same
time greatly improving the revealing
power, diminishing glare and distrac'
tion, and guiding the driver to the
proper carriageway. With such in'
stallations. from the driver’s viewpoint,
the near carriageway is well lighted
while the far one appears dark aT
though, in fact, well lighted for traf'
fic travelling along it. The revealing
power of this type of installation is
particularly good. It avoids the galaxy
of lights common on duabcarriageway
roads; you can see an example in
the distant stretch of this road.
The low'pressure fluorescent lamp
was not intended for street lighting.
It is not ideal; it is too long, of too
low a brightness, and too low a power.
No one would deliberately have chos'
en it. Yet the courage of those who
first investigated the use of this urn
promising lamp has been well re'
warded. The results are indeed re'
markable. The first successful British
installations were copied in other
countries, especially in Belgium
where this method of lighting is used
more extensively than in any other
country, and in France. Fluorescent
lamps—inevitably in large lanterns —
have certainly come to say, unless
ousted by colour corrected high pres'
sure fluorescent lamps. Whether or
not this will happen is largely de'
pendent on our success in finding
fluorescent powders giving a large
measure of red radiation, and at the
same time able to stand the relatively
high temperatures encountered in the
more heavily loaded H.P.M.V. lamps.
Airport Lighting.
The lighting of airports presents
problems entirely different from those
encountered in the lighting of streets.
In the street our concern is so to use
light that objects in the road are read'
ily visible; on the airport it is the
lights themselves that need to be vis'
ible from as great a distance as pos'
sible.
In 1931 the largest aircraft —such
as the Handley Page Scylla—could
land on a flat field. By night pilots
were aided by their own headlights or,
on well equipped fields, by large flood'
lights projecting flat sheets of light and
consuming up to 10 kW. Some pib
ots, particularly those trained in the
194M918 war, preferred paraffin
flares set out on the ground.

BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Nowadays, only small airfields are
[grass covered, for we must handle
[heavy aircraft. The modern craft are
so heavy and their landing speeds so
high that many need a paved runway
some 2 miles long. It would clearly
be very difficult to floodlight a run-
way of these dimensions —and quite
impossible to do so in such a way as
to make it visible in fog. We have
therefore had to revert to the earlier
[“flare” technique—modernised in its
application—but still comprising a pat-
tern of lights which will guide the
pilot safely to the airport and then
to the ground.
Radio aids are now so well devel-
oped that it is possible to bring a
plan to the ground with the pilot fly-
ing blind; but no pilot is happy if
asked to place unquestioning faith in
instruments. One can scarcely blame
them. I recently went to London
Airport to see a friend of mine off to
America. He was flying to the air-
port from his home in his own air-
craft. The weather was dirty and his
pilot needed help in landing. Imagine
his consternation when the officer who
was talking him down told him that
he had better start again, since his
gyro was obviously out of order as
he wasn’t flying on an even keel!
The ordinary civil practice is to use
radio to navigate to within a few hun-
dred yards of the airport, leaving the
final landing to the pilot. If a visual
landing is impossible the aircraft is
diverted to another aerodrome.
In reasonably clear weather the first
visual indication that the pilot has of
the location of the aerodrome is a
flashing light beacon. He sees this
long before he prepares to land. In
thick weather, his first visual aid will
be the approach lighting. The exact
position of lights in the approach
path has been studied very carefully
and the design now widely accepted
was evolved at the Royal Aircraft Es-
tablishment at Farnborough. This de-
sign comprises essentially a row of
powerful projectors spaced 100 ft.
apart on an extension of the centre
line of the runway with cross bars,
employing sodium lamps, every 600
ft. The main line gives direction;
the cross bars give an artificial hori-
zon which enables the pilot to fly on
an even keel and correctly to appreci-
ate any errors of position or heading.
This system of lights enables the pilot
to bring his plane over the runway
threshold at the correct position, ver-
tically and laterallv and on the desir-
ed glide path. He now has to touch
down.
To help him in this vital operation
rows of lights are set along the two
sides of the runway, the rows being
about 150 ft. apart. The positioning
of these lights has caused a good
deal of controversy. Some people
particularly in Great Britain, have con-
tended that the pilot should always
see the same pattern of lights, no
matter where he is landing. To
achieve this the parallel rows of lights
must be the same distance apart what-
ever the runway width. That is diffi-
cult to achieve. If always set out-
side the paved runway, they must
be spaced far enough apart for the
widest runway. This would result in
dangerous unpaved areas being left
between lights on a narrow runway.
Alternatively the lights may be set so
that the rows come just outside the
narrowest practicable runway: to
maintain the same separation on wid-
er runways the lights would then have
to be set into the runway itself. This
is necessary also at runway intersec-
tions. The objection to the second
alternative is that the design and man-
ufacture of “flush” mounted runway
lights is difficult —they have to be
so strongly made that they are not
damaged if the wheel of a heavy air-
craft passes over them —and high in-
tensities cannot be obtained with
these.
In the U.S.A. the preference has
been for “elevated” lights mounted
just off the runway edge whatever
its width, and this practice is slowly
gaining favour in other countries. It
is beginning to look as though the
value of similarity of pattern from
airport to airport was over-estimated.
If this finallv proves to be true, the
elevated light has almost everything
in its favour. Mechanical design is
much easier, it can provide a much
higher intensity (up to 100,000
candles as against 7,000 for the flush
type); it is in any case essential in
snowbound areas. The argument is
by no means over: it is a wonderful
playground for the mathematician, in-
volving, as it does, computations of
visibility in fog as well as the statis-
tics of the probable accuracy of radio
navigational aids. Eventually the spec-
ialists will doubtless reach agreement.
In the meantime, commonsense meth-
ods are gradually improving the vis-
ual landing aids and reducing the
number of diversions due to bad visi-
bility.
Those of you who have seen air-
ports from the air at night—and in
this country of vast distances most of
you will undoubtedly have done so —
will realise that there are vast numbers
of lights besides those directly used
for navigation. Perimeter lights, taxi-
track lights, tarmac lights, obstruc-
tion lights, wind-direction indicators
and so on. On a large airport there
may well be as many as 5,000 separ-
ate lighting fittings quite apart of
course from those in the airport build-
ings.
Film Studio Lighting.
Another important application of
lighting, differing as much from the
one we have fust been considering
as that in turn differed from street
lighting, is the lighting of film

studios. And here again we find, as
we found in the case of airports that
changing circumstances and techniques
in the operation for which the light'
ing is required are reflected in varia'
tions in the demands which the light'
ing engineer has to fulfil.
Before panchromatic film was avail'
able, film sets were lighted with low
pressure mercury lamps and carbon
arc lamps. In early 1927 tungsten
lamps were tried on the newly intro'
duced panchromatic stocks. They
proved so successful that by 1931 W.
A. Villiers was able to report to the
C.I.E. meeting at Cambridge that the
average British studio used some 70%
tungsten to 30% arc lamps and that
mercury vapour lamps were obsolete.
With the introduction of sound films
in 1929 the silence of incandescent
lamps gave them a great advantage
over the carbon arcs which, at that
time, were distinctly noisy. Tungsten
lamps were used in ratings of 500 W
to lOkW. They were generally
mounted in parabolic reflectors of any'
thing up to 30” in diameter.
About 1937 the studios started
filming in colour. The process env
ployed, Technicolour required “day'
light” sources of high power. This
brought the high intensity arc back
into its own once more. Designers
concentrated on quiet operation and
achieved considerable success, produc'
ing lamps of up to 150 amps which
were both steady and silent: pris-
made lenses replaced the old mirrors.
The incandescent light—-its brief spell
of predominance ended —was relegat'
ed to use with black and white films.
The circle continued to turn and for
a short period from about 1946 to
1951 it looked as though mercury dis'
charge lamps might also regain their
early importance. This possibility
had been recognised before the war.
It arose from the considerable ad'
vances in the development of com-
pact source lamps, one of which —the
2\ kW cadmium mercury discharge
lamp—was shown to work admirably
with Technicolor film. This fortU'
nate, if somewhat unexpected, result
was to some extent offset by the fact
that the light from the discharge lamp
still appeared definitely greenish to the
eye. This made it difficult for the
lighting cameraman to mix arc lamps
and vapour discharge lamps on the
set.
Nevertheless, good progress was be'
ing made when Technicolor introduc'
ed anew process. This required much
less light and was particularly adapt'
ed to incandescent lamp colour tern'
peratures. And so, the circle turned
again, we now find five and ten kilo'
watt tungsten filament lamps once
more in the ascendant. It looks
just now as though arc lamps will
slowly fall from favour except for
special effects work. As an interest'
ing example of special purpose arc
lamps, I would mention that in our
own laboratories we are studying the
design of a 350 amp H.I. arc with a
very large lens, 30 in. in diameter.
Other discharge lamp sources, such
as the Xenon and other “gas'arc”
lamps, have been proposed. The re'
quired colour can also be obtained
with special forms of carbon arc which
are at present rather inefficient.
Whether these sources will again dis'
place tungsten lamps in film studios,
and, if so, how and when is a matter
for conjecture. There is certainly no
reason to assume that the cycle of
change has been completed.
Interior Lighting.
In the lighting of streets, airports
and film studios the objectives are
reasonably clear and steady research
and investigation over a considerable
number of years have shown the var'
ious ways in which they can be at'
tained. In interior lighting we are, I
think, far less advanced. It is true
that we plan efficient lighting for such
places as factories where the objective
is reasonably well defined: these in'
stallations naturally make use of our
most up'to'date sources of light in'
eluding H.P.M.V. lamps and tubular
fluorescent lamps.
But in the interiors where personal
taste and aesthetic judgment enter —
and that is in all but the most utilitar'
ian—from many points of view we
have as yet no clear definition of what
it is that we are trying to achieve. In
such circumstances a clearly defined
line of progress is not to be expected:
practice oscillates between the stereo'
typed and the experimental. Serious
attempts are now being made to
achieve in the sphere of interior light'
ing that basic recognition and under'
standing of underlying factors that
has been so successfully realised in the
case of street lighting. The problem
is more difficult because the assess'
ment of achievement is so much
more subjective, but it is my belief
that the next few years will show
considerable progress.
Please do not think lam decrying
the excellent work that has been done
on specific installations. The installa'
tion at Buckingham Palace show the
high standard often reached twenty'
one years ago. At that time, the be'
ginning of the period we are consid'
ering tonight, the trend in the
interior lighting of public build'
ings was towards what was called
“architectural lighting.” An ambi'
guous name, difficult to define, but in'
dicative of the subservience of the
lighting fitting to the luminous effect.
It embraced such things as luminous
ceilings, architraves; solid features,
coves and cornices provided specially
for the purpose, and so on the effect
largely dependent on the extensive
use of indirect lighting.
In the U.S.A., in particular, indirect
lighting was exploited to produce
really high levels of illumination —as
high as 50 to 100 lumens per sq. foot
—especially in offices. For these levels
indirect lighting was virtually essential,
for it was almost impossible to obtain
them with direct lighting installations
without producing such serious glare
that the increase in illumination fail'
ed to improve seeing conditions. But
though better in this respect the in'
direct systems were by no means per'
feet. The very bright ceiling itself
produced glare of another kind;
furthermore, the system was inefficient,
and the loads so great that the heat'
ing problem became serious. High
levels of illumination were clearly
not easily to be achieved with the
only light source then available.
It was at this point that the fluor'
escent lamp came into the picture.
With its great efficiency and low lurm
inence, it immediately opened up new
possibilities. For lighting from coves
and cornices it was excellent. It was
especially useful for lighting from lu'
minous ceilings, a system which had
been found inefficient and not too
successful with tungsten lamps. Here
the objective is clear. It is to provide
high illuminations on the working
plane—now possible at reasonable
power—without too high a luminance
of either the fittings or the ceilings.
The fluorescent lamps brings these
aims within the realm of practical pos'
sibility.
The “louverall” ceiling is an inter'
esting attempt at a solution: it
achieves the dual objectives of low
ceiling brightness and high illumina'
tion on the working plane, but has
certain inherent disadvantages which
make its survival conjectural. Curious'
ly enough, a form of egg'erate ceil'
ing was described in 1931, just 21
years ago. Even in the simple form
of transverse louvres, the system can
be very effective.
In another form of lighting based
on the fluorescent lamp the ceiling
is covered with continuous lines of
lighting fitting, known in America as
“troffers,” adjacent lines being only
a few feet apart. In some installations
the lighting equipment is suspended
from the ceiling and acoustical plaster
is suspended between lines of fittings,
thus presenting a complete false ceil'
ing. Very high levels of illumination
have been produced in this way in
stores and offices; the interior is
drenched with light yet neither ceil'
ing nor fitting need be too bright.
The newer techniques have opened
up possibilities which have inspired

theoretical work in many countries.
In interior lighting—as, fifteen years
ago, in street lighting—attention is
being directed to brightness patterns
rather than illumination and a tech'
nique of “brightness engineering” is
emerging. Instead of illumination on
a hypothetical working plane interest
has swung to the brightness distribu'
tion in the field of view, which has
brought with it interesting problems
of interreflection, and has led engin-
eers to think in terms of perspective
rather than of plan—again, as in
street lighting. More important, it
has brought together the twin arts of
lighting and interior decoration, and
has drawn attention to what can be
done with paint and papers as well as
with light.
Workers in different countries have
attacked differing phases of the
problem. In America, where the
greatest progress has been made, the
problems of interreflection have
been tackled and work has been done
on discomfort and on decoration, the
latter mainlv as it affects brightness
contrasts and discomfort. In Holland
they have worked rather on problems
of emphasis and attention of users of
the interior. In Britain, we have
made some notable contributions to
discomfort glare, to daylight, to dec'
oration (particularly to attractive and
beautiful colour schemes) and work
is in hand on modelling and shad'
ows—two questions which have been
studied in Germany before the war.
In Australia, Dr. Dresler has studied
various phases of the problem. Quite
anew approach to interior lighting
is being made and there are some
very interesting and closely interrelat'
ed problems to be solved. We have
yet a very long way to go—the im-
portant thing is that the existence of
a problem has been properly recognis'
ed: the problem has first to be pro'
perly defined—then solved.
The final design of a lighting in'
stallation is a matter for an artist,
not an engineer. The architect can'
not possibly be an expert in all the
techniques he employs. He has in-
creasingly to depend on specialists.
This is particularly true of lighting.
Few architects realise all the potential'
ities of artificial lighting. Sometimes
they spoil their own best work by in-
sisting on designing the lighting equip-
ment, treating it as a decorative fea-
ture —considering its own appearance
but not appreciating what it may do
to the appearance of the rest of his
design. Architects and lighting en-
gineers working together have pro-
duced some fine examples of lighting.
For example, the recently erected Roy-
al Festival Hall on the South Bank
of the River Thames: and the De-
bating Chamber of the House of
Commons, just across the river, re'
built after its wartime devastation.
Nevertheless there is undoubtedly
a need for lighting artists —artists
trained in the u&e of light—who will
do for interiors what the stage light'
ing experts and lighting cameramen
do for the theatre and the cinema.
The lighting artist has the much more
difficult problem, for he is designing
for people who have to live and work
in the interior, not for actors who
must be prepared to accept consider'
aable discomfort if needs be in order
that a desired effect may be achieved.
“Light and seeing are integral and
essential parts of all graphic and plas'
tic art; in fact, those arts reside in
the significant interplay of the forms
created by the sculptor or artist and
the light applied by the lighting art'
ist.”
The decorative value of light is
highly important; the psychological
value of attractive surroundings may
be very great —possibly even justify'
ing some small sacrifice of visual effi'
ciency if the two should come into
conflict. We must be careful, indeed,
in our assessments of visual efficiency.
Sometimes common sense or instinct,
may challenge the indications of the
latest piece of experimental work;
for the behaviour of the eye and the
mind in combination is not easy to
assess. When this conflict arises we
must not be too ready to jettison the
guidance of instinct.
For example, some people are tend'
ing to interpret recent work on bright'
ness distribution as evidence of a re'
quirement for a nearly uniformly
bright interior. Carried to its limit
we should, perhaps, live in white'
washed igloos! Even if we could see
better in these surroundings than in
any others, I am sure that most of us
would feel that the sacrifice of pleas'
ant variety in our houses and work'
ing places was too high a price to
pay. Let us not develop one'track
minds.
(The address was illustrated by a
number of slides.)
DISCUSSION.
In paying tribute to the excellence
of the address itself and the accom'
panying illustrations, Mr. E. Williams
said that it was only on rare occasions
that the Society was privileged to lis'
ten to such a distinguished visitor.
The title of the address “In
Twentv'one Years,” Mr. Williams
said, had recalled to mind some of
his own experiences at the G.E. lab'
oratory in America, forty'one years
ago, when the first gas'filled incande'
scent lamps were being developed.
Continuing, Mr. Williams said that
there were two questions which he
wished to ask Mr. Humphreys. The
first was in connection with lighting
for night sports of which there were
some outstanding examples in both
Great Britain and the United States
(continued overleaf)
AMERICA BUILDS.
Amricans are certainly great builders, if some
new building is required, the policy is not
to talk about it for years but to carefully
analyse its commercial aspects and then “get
stuck into it.” We illustrate a few recent
major projects: (1) Oshawa High School,
Ontario, Canada. (2) Model of radial nurs-
ing unit planned for the new University Med-
ical centre at Jerusalem. (3) The new
Virgin Isle Hotel in the Caribbean. (4) New
factory unit at Skokie, Illinois. (5) El Panama
Hotel, Panama. (6) Armstrong Tyre and
Rubber Co. plant, Natchez, Missouri. (7)
The University of Miami.

of America. He asked if Mr.
Humphreys could enlighten the meet-
ing on the use of recreational light-
ing in England and whether there
was any possibility of Test Cricket
ever being played entirely by artificial
light?
In his second question, he queried
the accuracy of the pocket light meters
as normally used by lighting engineers
to evaluate the efficiency of lighting
installations.
In replying to Mr. Williams’ ques-
tions, Mr. Humphreys said that the
main disadvantage connected with the
use of artificial lighting for recreation
in Great Britain was that it sometimes
rained. He mentioned that both foot-
ball and cricket had been played on
occasions under artificial light. How-
ever the problems of cold and rain
were such that any sport played at
night must be of a very exciting na-
ture to retain the interest of the spec-
tator. As a result, Mr. Humphreys
said recreational lighting was only
used regularlv for the really “vital”
sports such as Dog Racing.
With reference to the pocket light
meters, Mr. Humphreys went on to
say, considerable care must be exer-
cised in their use. Discrepancies often
occur due to the lack of stability of
the photo-voltaic cell over long or
even moderate periods of time. For
this reason it was desirable to have
such a meter calibrated shortly before
it was to be used. In cases where the
laboratorv facilities for calibration did
not exist it was preferable to have a
type of light meter that incorporated
its own method of calibration.
In seconding the vote of thanks.
Mr. E. L. Freedman said that he had
been impressed by the vast amount of
progress and achievement which had
taken place within the comparatively
short space of twenty-one years. The
address had revealed a long series of
successes, something worth boasting
about, but which has been modestly
referred to as “some progress and a
few changes having been made.”
The vote of thanks was carried with
acclamation.
In responding to the vote of thanks
Mr. Humphreys said that any modes-
ty on his part had been unintentional,
however, one thing of which he was
intensely proud was the fact that not
only the discovery of the fluorescent
lamp, but also every major develop-
ment of it had come from Great
Britain.
Dr. Dressier said that he had been
engaged in the lighting field for
twenty-five years and had been re-
minded by the speaker of his own
early days. He recalled the develop-
ment of the coiled-coil filament and
the Xenon filled lamp. He further
said that the development of light
sources had been so rapid during the
years covered by the speaker, that it
was almost impossible to expect such
development in the future. Both the
incandescent and fluorescent lamps
were within sight of the limit of their
efficiencies, although improvements
both in the life and colour rendering
properties of the fluorescent lamp
could be expected.
In referring to the life of the fluor-
escent lamp, Mr. Humphreys said that
there was no theoretical limit to its
extension. The British manufacturers
had agreed that this property of the
fluorescent lamp was not to be denied
to the public, and already the life had
been considerably increased. It was
his hope, said Mr. Humphreys, that
some additional quality could be
found which could be introduced to
the fluorescent lamp in exchange for
some of its life.
At the present time there is con'
siderable research being directed to'
wards the discovery of new light
sources. Electroluminescence is one
of the new sources that is being ex-
plored but sufficient knowledge had
not yet been gained to predict the
limit of its efficiency.
Mr. McCourt said that some of the
newer types of lamps mentioned by
Mr. Humphreys, namely, the white
fluorescent coated H.P.M.V. lamp and
the diaso printing lamp, were already
in use in Australia. He asked whether
the mercury and tungsten lamps in
the one reflector had been used to any
extent in England pre-war. and
whether the blended light lamp, as
we know it here, had achieved popu'
larity in England?
Mr. Humphreys said that the blend-
ed light lamps had been made and
used in England, but were not popu'
lar with the manufacturers. It was
both a difficult and an expensive lamp
to make and he expressed the opinion
that if its development had been ap-
proached from this angle, it would
never have been made at all.
Mr. Blunt drew attention to the
difficulties in photometric work when
discharge lamps had to be compared
with tungsten filament standards. He
asked Mr. Humphreys if any progress
had been made towards the develop'
ment of a discharge standard lamp?
Mr. Humphreys said he did not
know of any move to produce a dis-
charge standard lamp but that, with
the latest improvements in colourimet-
ry, incandescent standards could be
transmitted to discharge lamps with-
out great difficulty.
Mr. Hudson-Shaw said that, to
him, one of the most interesting parts
of the address was the emphasis on
the association of art with the Science
of Illuminating Engineering. He hop*
ed that this association would become
stronger with time.
Mr. Phillips asked Mr. Humphreys
if he considered that the architect had
anything to contribute to the light
field. Mr. Humphreys replied that the
ideal combination was that of the ar-
chitect and lighting engineer working
in conjunctiop.
Mr. Jeffery asked Mr. Humphreys
whether he could quote any figures on
the efficiency of the electro-lumines-
cent panel at the present stage in its
development.
Mr. Humphreys replied that no re'
liable figures were available. Electro'
luminescence is still something of a
Scientific novelty and current research
was directed to determine its charac'
teristics and capabilities rather than
its efficiency.
Mr. Austin referring to the use of
templates in Winch’s photometer ask'
ed if any further developments had
been made.
Mr. Humphreys said he had no
knowledge of any further develop'
ments.
NEW SHAPES IN FURNITURE.
Time-honoured shapes for furniture are un-
der heavy pressure today against new forms,
The upper example seems to be inspired by yd
a boomerang, while the next two rectangular
and oval or eliptical adhere to recognised
geometrical shapes but are both low like a
coffee table. The bottom unit, which is
presumably a couch or day-bed, looks more
like a low-down operating table or a mortu-
ary slab, though the mattress may compensate
for the uncompromising, hard lines.

WORLD-WIDE CONSTRUCTION.
Britain Gets First “Motel”
Britain’s first motel (wayside motor
camp) has been built in the Shake'
speare country, 12 miles from Strat'
ford'on'Avon.
It is contained within the luxury
surroundings of Rouncil Towers
former mansion of a wealthy business
man.
The motel has been designed to
simulate the atmosphere and luxury
of a mediaeval castle. Like the an'
cient roadhouse that catered for man
and beast, the motel services the car
while the motorist sleeps.
The heart of this ultramodern es'
tablishment is Rouncil Towers, now
the property of a millionaire showman
who considers his motel better than
anything he has seen in the U.S.
100 Apartments.
The main building provides apart'
ments finished in dark oak or mahog'
any. It has parquet floors, step'down
baths in the bathrooms, heated towel
rods, central .heating, air'eonditioning,
and showers.
Each apartment has a telephone
and two built'in beds.
There are 100 apartments in the
motel section, each with its own car'
port enclosed in glass block. The
occupants of these apartments can
have their meals delivered on call in a
small wagon that works out of the
main building.
Luxury U.S. Motel.
In Hamilton, Ohio, the motorists’
idea of “luxury” living is being ap'
plied to one motel with 52 air'eon'
ditioned rooms, and six bridal suites
offering all the comforts of home.
The main building, recently open'
ed, is a re-decorated mansion, set in
landscaped grounds, and every pos'
sible convenience has been added to
give a proper home touch to over'
night touring.
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
TO SHIPPING INDUSTRY.
The Federal Government is provid'
ing financial assistance to the shipping
industry, by which shipowners buy
vessels in Australia at 25% less than
their cost of construction.
Announcing this, the Minister for
Shipping Senator McLeay, said that
very substantial orders have been
placed with the yards.
It was the Government’s policy to
foster the shipbuilding industry in Aus
tralia as a defence measure and the
development of heavy industry.
Merchant ships are being built at
a record rate, and there is sufficient
shipbuilding to keep Australian ship'
yards fully operating for 15 years.
Senator McLeay declared.
If the backdog of shipping required
was to be overcome some ships would
have to be built in oversea yards, he
added.
(Seven ships are scheduled for
launching this year, aggregating 32,850
tons deadweight.)
AMERICAN HOUSING.
The upper view is of a new apartment house
at Lima, Ohio, which contains four living
suites, each with kitchen, dinette and living
room and two bedrooms and bathroom on the
upper floor. See plans A and B. The
house below on traditional lines has three
bedrooms as shown in plan C.
SPLIT LEVEL HOUSES.
NEW AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT.
Split level houses are a compromise solution
of the single or double storeyed controversy
that is the subject of so much debate. In
these houses the difference between living room
and bedrooms is only about six steps while
from kitchen to laundry and garage is similar.
The upper two examples are in a new estate
in New Jersey while that at the bottom is
in sketch form only. Plan of the bottom
house is given below.

Earth-Wall
Construction
New Bulletin From The
Commonwealth Experimental
Building Station.
Isn’t that what is known as wattle
and daub? Building with earth and
tree branches—something that was
used in ancient time? That is correct,
wattle and daub was an early method
of earth-wall construction in which
matlike screens called “wattles” made
of thin straight saplings interlaced with
twigs were attached to posts to form
both interior and exterior shuttering
to a wall. The space between was
filled with mud and straw and the
outside surfaces of the wattles were
plastered or “daubed” with mud and
finished with whitewash.
The system was used to build the
first houses in Australia and it per-
sisted until clay bricks were manufac-
tured here. But bricks are usually in
great demand and transport costs
make their use as a building material
in places a long distance from the
kiln very expensive. Many people
are therefore turning to a form of con-
struction in which the basic material
—earth —is close at hand.
Two methods of earth-wall con-
struction have been evolved since the
early wattle and daub. Both are econ-
omical in manufacture as the work
can be carried out by unskilled labour.
The methods are:
(1) Pise or Rammed Earth in which
damp earth is rammed in-situ
between temporary, movable
formwork to build a solid wall.
(2) Adobe or Puddled Earth in
which puddled earth and straw
are moulded into blocks which,
when dried, are built into walls
as with other masonry units.
Many considerations will govern
which method is to be adopted but,
generally the most important is what
type of soil is available. Others in-
clude the owner’s preference, the la-
bour available, the facilities for pre-
paring proper equipment, general
site conditions and the local by-laws.
Earth-wall construction has been the
subject of much research overseas, and
from the results of this work, from
investigation of old and new buildings
and from their own experimental
work, the Commonwealth Experiment-
al Building Station has produced a
new and up-to-date publication on the :
subject — Bulletin No. 5— Earth-'
Wall Construction,” by G. H. Middle-'
ton, obtainable for 5/- (post free)

vice, Box 2807AA, G.P.O., Mel-'

DEVELOPMENT AT PENRITH AND THE MOUNTAINS.
Many people like to live away from the hustle and bustle of the city and it is only natural

A Builder of
To-Day and
Yesterday
To be a builder nowadays one must
have a legal mind or be a lawy-
|er to interpret and keep within
! the laws and by-laws that are im-
posed from day to day; one
has to be an accountant to deal with
exacting figures, pay-roll taxes, and
other taxation requirements. Then
j one has to be a detective to note the
wiles of “Go-Slow” men, and a schol-
ar to fathom the ramifications of the
arbitration system with awards that
I vary for every trade. All this is
quite apart from building knowledge.
Our good old-fashioned forebears
.were men full of building knowledge,
experienced in how to handle men,
problems of materials and their tran-
sport to various locations and their
manipulation when on location.
Are we degenerating, or progress-
ling?
A specialist ’ is a man who knows
more and more of less and less. The
question arises: Do builders special-
ise in building?

U.S. MEMORIAL AT CANBERRA
GOVERNOR-GENERAL UNVEILS TABLET.
The Governor-General, Sir William
McKell, recently unveiled a tablet to
mark the commencement of construc-
tion of the American Memorial at
Canberra.
In addition to the Governor-Gen-
eral, other speakers were the Prime
Minister, Mr. R. G. Menzies, the Fed-
eral president of the Australian-Amer-
ican Association, Sir John Latham,
and the United States Ambassador, Mr
Pete Jarman, who responded on behalf
of the American Government.
Cabinet Ministers, members of Par-
liament, heads of Commonwealth de-
partments, members of the Austra-
lian-American Association from all
States, and Australian and American
service and ex-service representatives
were also present at the impressive
ceremony.
“Sincere Gratitude.”
The wording on the tablet which
the Governor'General unveiled, reads;
“This tablet commemorates the
commencement of the construc-
tion of Australia’s national mem-
orial to the United States of
America, initiated by the Aus-
tralian-American Association, and
made possible by the sincere
gratitude of the Australian
people.”
The late King George VI. accept'
ed an invitation to lay the foundation
stone of the memorial during his
proposed Australian tour. Later this
ceremony was to have been perform'
ed on April 16 last by Princess Eliz'
abeth.
It is hoped that Her Majesty the
Queen will accept an invitation to
unveil the memorial during her visit
to Canberra next year.
Excellent Site.
The site of the memorial is an ex'
cellent one. It is at the end of King’s
Avenue axis, at the foot of Mount
Russell, about a mile and a half from
Parliament House.
Chief feature of the design is a
250 feet high octagonal aluminium
column, surmounted by an aluminium
eagle mounted on a sphere. The
eagle has its wings upstretched in a
victory sign (see illustration).
It is anticipated that the column
and eagle should be completed by No'
vember next.
Other features of the design will in-
elude monumental approach stairways
trom a lower forecourt, to an extensive
upper forecourt surrounding the shaft.
HUGE RISE IN SHIP COSTS.
500% Increase Since 1939.
Ships which cost £lOO a day to op-
crate in 1939 now cost between £450
and <£soo a day, the Minister for Ship*
Ping and Transport, Senator McLeay,
said last week.
He was making a statement giving
reasons for increased shipping freights,
and gave these points:
• In 1939 the basic rate for ships’
crews was £3/13/0. against £ll/11/0
now.
• In 1939 hours worked were 56
a week; today crews work a 40-hour
week.
• Although stevedoring cost ship-
owners at least 500% more now,
treight rates have risen by only 390%.
THE U.S. MEMORIAL.
The dominating feature of the design for the
Memorial, won in competition by R. M. Ure,
is an octagonal aluminium shaft 250 ft. high,
surmounted by the American Eagle. It is
flanked by stone pylons with descriptive murals
and a Memorial Court.

Takes Shape
£10,000,000 Project Ready
Next Year.
The mammoth £10,000,000 Shell
Oil refinery, on the western shores of
Corio Bay, near Geelong, Victoria,
will begin operating early next year.
The plant, which is being built by
the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd., will
be capable of treating crude oil from
any part of the world.
Its annual output will be 202,000,'
000 gallons of petrol 69,000,000 gal'
lons of fuel oil and 35.000,000 gallons
of diesel oil.
The refinery, when in full operation
will save Australia several millions of
pounds a year.
The huge project is being directed
by a team of international refinery ex'
perts, headed by Mr. H. van Lente,
who has directed similar construction
jobs in the U.S., South America, and
Europe.
Eight hundred men and seven com'
panics—two of them Dutch specialist
firms —are employed on the work.
Stupendous Task.
The construction of the refinery is
a stupendous task, and materials and
equipment have come from all parts
of Australia and from the U.K., In'
donesia, Singapore, Holland, and Bah
ikpapan.
The biggest jib crane in the South'
ern Hemisphere is also on the job.
It weighs 46 tons, and can lift loads of
up to 150 tons. It is busy handling
giant columns for the distillation
plant.
When completed they will weigh
over 100 tons each, stand between 85
feet and 100 feet high, and from 110
feet to 12 feet in diameter.
Sections of the columns weigh 20
to 30 tons each.
New Wharf.
Close by the refinery the Geelong
Harbour Trust is dredging Corio Bay
so that it can build a wharf capable of
handling two 18,000'ton tankers at
the same time.
Tankers will bring more than
300,000.000 gallons of crude oil a
year from non-dollar resources, main'
ly Borneo.
A power station of 6000'kilowatt
capacity will service the refinery, and
a workers’ housing estate and a
£ 220,000 hostel will also be built.

Care of Seasoned Timber on Building Sites
SOME TIMBER “DONT’S.”
Careless handling of seasoned dm'
her after its arrival at a building site
can undo much of the good work ex-
pended upon its preparation.
The timber industry of Australia,
aided by research organisations, has
endeavoured to reach a high standard
in timber seasoning practices and dm'
ber may be procured in properly seas'
oned condition from the majority of
suppliers. In such timber the mois'
ture content has been reduced to about
midway in the range between summer
and winter equilibrium conditions for
the district in which it will be used,
and thus movement after installation
should be negligible. Even so, it must
be remembered that timber is capable
of changing its moisture content when
exposed to damp or to excessively dry
conditions: that some mechanical
loads or impacts, easily carried by the
woodwork when fixed in the position
for which it is designed, can cause
damage to parts before they are erect'
ed and that dirt may adhere to the
surfaces of woodwork as firmly as do
decorative coatings.
The precautions necessary at the
building site in caring for seasoned,
machined or fabricated woodwork are
therefore protection against moisture,
heat, mechanical damage and dirt.
Conditions prevailing in and around
an uncompleted building commonly
differ from those to which the timber
will be subjected finally. Damp
ground, wet masonry, fresh plaster'
ing, etc., all tend to make the condi'
tions more humid than in a complet'
ed, well aired, and perhaps heated
building, with the result that the mois-
ture content of any timber exposed
to these conditions will be increased.
Much can be done by careful plan'
ning to protect timber on a building
site if the following precautions are
taken:
• Arrange for the delivery of seas'
oned timber and joinery to coincide
as closely as possible with the times
when it can be fixed in position.
• Don’t unload in the rain, if
avoidable. Provide a cover for the
seasoned timber while rain is falling.
• Don’t stack or lean seasoned tim'
ber against new brickwork. The tim'
ber is likely to take up moisture from
the brickwork.
• Don’t pile directly on the
ground. Allow a space of 18 inches
from the ground and ensure good air
circulation underneath; alternatively,
place building paper, sheet iron or
other impervious protective material
between the wood and the ground.
These precautions will ensure that the
moisture content of the timber is not
affected by ground moisture.
• Don’t store seasoned timber in
leaking enclosures. Provide some dry,
well-aired shelter in which seasoned
timber can be held off the ground and
protected on top and sides from the
weather or other hazards.
• Don't risk breakage by exposing
the tongues or grooves of flooring or
the important edges of other milled
products in situations where damage
is possible. They should be placed
where construction is not progressing
and out of traffic ways.
• Don't allow ends of machined
boards to project far out of stacks.
They may become permanently warp-
ed and are a danger to workmen pass-
ing by.
• Don’t deliberately shut seasoned
woodwork in rooms where brickwork
or plastering is proceeding or has been
recently completed. Provide the max-
imum ventilation consistent with pro-
tection from the weather.
• Don't cramp flooring tightlv if
pick-up moisture is confirmed by test-
ing.
• Don’t allow the surfaces of floor-
ing or fittings to become dirty or wet.
While other trades are working, spread
some loose material, such as dry saw-
dust, over the surface or else apply
a sealing coat of a type that may be
removed during the final sanding op-
eration.
• Don’t hold weatherboards in a
block stack for long periods. If sup-
plies of timber reach the site long
before use, the timber should be strip-
stacked.
• Apply coats of priming paint to
the weatherboards, joinery and intern-
al fittings as soon as possible after
these items arrive on the building
site. Such coatings will delay moisture
changes during completion of con-
struction and allow the best possible
finish to be obtained. It is preferable,
where this can be arranged, to have
joinery items prime-coated at the join-
er s shop before delivery to the site.
• See that frames that are to be
built into the work are temporarily
braced against deformation before de-
livery.
• Take precautions against mortar
staining of joinery and the absorption
of moisture from adjacent brickwork.
• Protect joinery fixed in position
from being damaged by other trades.
Although the foregoing principles
may seem, at first sight, to constitute
a formidable list, they represent in
fact no more than commonsense pre-
cautions.

Flats Mark
Marjorie Jackson’s
Feats
“To mark Marjorie Jackson's
achievements at the Helsinki Olympic
Games, Mrs. C. E. Evatt, wife of the
Minister for Housing, last week gave
the name Jackson Place to two blocks
of flats in Lithgow.”—News Item.
Last year there was a storm over
the naming of a block of flats in
North Sydney Geraghtv Court, in
honour of the then M.L.A., Mr. J
Geraghtv, who was responsible for the
Liquor Commission inquiry being
held.
There could be no end to this nam-
ing of flats after prominent citizens,
except that, in our humble opinion,
the Minister for Housing will run out
of blocks of flats long before he runs
out of names.
However, let’s make a rhyme about
it!
For most of us, when life is done —
A name upon a tombstone;
A few kind words, a tear or tw© —
Then eternal rest, a-lone . . .
For some of us, of diff’rent ilk—
There are stones of other sorts;
To bear our names and all our
“feats”.
In Commission or in sports . . .
* * * * *
Yes, such is fame, if you can run,
Or hound the pubs; it rouses
A longing great to place your name
On Evatt’s costly houses!
The greatest honour we can “earn”
In this State of theocrats*—
Is having nam-ed after us
A big block of Evatt’s flats.
Now let us strive with might and
main.
Our “Marge” to emulate,
Let’s run the race flat out to win
And thus we’ll keep a date . . .
With prom’nent folk of many walks
And some who pursue sports.
And justify our name upon
Clive Evatt’s blocks of Courts!
But still we feel, although sincere
In ambitious housing aims.
The Min’ster will be out of flats
Long before he’s out of names!

SELF-ASSESSMENT OF PROVISIONAL TAX EXPLAINED
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR BUILDING INDUSTRY
The Taxation Department has sup-
plied the Master Builders’ Association
of N.S.W. with information intended
to explain the system of self-assess-
ment of provisional tax as introduced
by the Income Tax and Social Ser-
vices Contribution Assessment Act of
1952.
As this information is of the ut-
most importance to the building and
allied industries, “Construction” re-
prints it in full, as a future guide to
our readers.
The memorandum, issued by the
Treasury, Canberra, on February 20,
explains that the principle of self-as-
sessment is not new. It has been in'
troduced for example, in Canada
where it has given considerable satis*
faction to ratepayers.
The introduction of this principle
at the present time is considered to
be particularly welcome, as, in some
cases, incomes have shown a marked
decline from earlier levels so that pro-
visional tax calculated on the basis of
the previous year is, in many cases,
higher than that which will be finally
assessed on the 1952-53 income.
The Previous Method
of Assessment.
In the first place, it should be ex-
plained that a notice of assessment calls
for payment of a sum made up of
two components—
(a) a provisional amount of tax
in respect of the income of the
current year;
(b) the adjustment of the provi-
sional amount paid last year,
against the tax now assessed for
that year.
For example, a taxpayer’s return of
income of the year ended 30th June,
1952, is assessed in March, 1953. He
would receive an assessment like this:
Taxable Income—£5,000. £
Final Tax on Income deriv-
ed during year ended
30th June, 1952 2,297
Less provisional tax paid in
respect of year ended
30th Tune, 1952 1,500
Adjustment—debit 797
Provisional tax for 1952-53
based on 1951-52 return
i.e.. assuming income to
be unaltered at £5,000
and taking into account
the reduction in the
rates 2.088
Amount payable during year
1952-53 2.885
Of these two components, the pro'
visional tax is by far the greater
amount. Jt is. therefore, important
that it should be as near correct as
is possible.
The provisional tax has never, in
the past, been related to the income
of the year for which it is paid. It
has been calculated by reference to
the income of the previous year.
This usually resulted in too much
or too little being paid. It frequently
caused hardship to the taxpayer.
The New Method of
Self-Assessment.
The new system of self-assessment
makes it possible for the provisional
tax to be calculated by reference to
the income of the current year. It
can be calculated by the taxpayer him-
self on his estimate of the year’s in-
come.
If the taxpayer makes a genuine at'
tempt to relate his provisional tax to
the current year's income, the disad-
vantages of the old system will be
overcome.
The new system will place the tax-
payer on a true pay-as-you-earn basis.
The principles of pay-as-you-earn re-
quire that tax should be paid during
the year on the income of the year.
If the income rises, the amount of
tax paid should rise and the tax should
fall as the income falls.
Under the system of self-assessment,
the Taxation Department will con-
tinue to calculate an amount of provi'
sional tax by reference to the income
of the previous year. This amount
will be included as an item in the no-
tice of assessment as has been done
in the past.
The taxpayer will then have the
right to reject the amount of provis'
ional tax calculated by the Department
and to substitute for it an amount cal'
culated by himself by reference to his
estimated or expected income.
The system of self-assessment obvi-
ously has many advantages from the
viewpoint of the taxpayer. Where his
income increases, he can calculate and
pay the amount of provisional tax on
the increased income, thus ensuring
that his tax liabilities are met when
they arise.
Conversely, where his income falls,
he is not required to pay an amount
of provisional tax which is excessive
having regard to his reduced income.
The following examples show the ad'
vantages of the system to taxpayers
whose incomes fall in the current year:
The notice of asessment will be de'
signed to enable the taxpayer to sub'
stitute the amount calculated by him'
self and to adjust the amount payable
by him as a result.
Each notice of assessment will be
accompanied by a work sheet on which
the taxpayer can make his calculation
of the amount payable. This sheet
will contain tax tables and an example
of a tax calculation set out in much
the same manner as the examples pro'
vided on income tax return forms.
The taxpayer will not be required
to submit an itemized list of estimat'
ed income and deductions. All that
will be required is the amount of tax'
able income dissected between salary
or wages, business income and pro'
perty income.
It is not compulsory for a taxpayer
to substitute his calculation of provi'
sional tax for the amount calculated
by the Department unless his income
has increased by more than 20 per
cent. An increase of 20 per cent, is
regarded as sufficient to make increased
provisional tax necessary.

(continued from previous page)
The Act stafes that a taxpayer must
comply with the self-assessment pro-
visions by 31st March or by the due
date for payment of his tax, which-
ever is the later.
In practice, the due dates for pay-
ment, in provisional tax cases, 'will be
arranged so that none will occur be-
fore 31st March. The due dates will
be spread throughout the months of
April, May and June. In many cases
the dates will not occur until after
30th Tune.
Opponents of the self-assessment
provisions claim that a taxpayer will
not be able t6 form a reliable esti-
mate of his income by the date on
which he is required to do so. It
will usually be found that a person in
business has some idea, even before
the year commences, of the income
he expects to make during the year.
When nine or more months of the
year have passed, he is able to say
whether his income will come up to
expectations. If he then thinks that
his income will be different from his
original expectations he is aware of
the reason and is able to estimate the
extent of the fluctuations. If the bus-
iness is a very large establishment it is
probably conducted by a company.
As a company is not required to pay
provisional tax, the question of esti-
mated income does not arise.
Exceptions will be found in prim-
ary producers who have not received
the proceeds of the harvest by the
date on which an estimate must be
formed and there are. no doubt, other
exceptions but, in most cases, the
value of the harvest will be known
fairly accurately. It is important,
however, to remember that these tax-
payers are the exceptions and that the
rule has been formulated to fit the
circumstances of the majority.
Provisions have been inserted in the
Act to enable the circumstances of
these exceptional cases to be met.
Firstly, where the income has been
under-estimated by the taxpayer be-
cause of circumstances of which he
could not have been aware, the Com-
missioner is empowered to remit the
penalty. Secondly, the estimate is not
required until the due date for pay-
ment of the tax. Where the due date
for payment is extended, the due date
for submission of the estimate is also
extended. It is commonly found that
where the bulk of the income is not
received until the last nuarter of the
year, an extension of time for pay-
ment of tax is sought and is granted.
The Penalty Provision of the
Self-Assessment System.
There is a "ood deal of misunder-
58
March 24. 1953
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


standing of the penalty provisions for
under-estimation of income. It will
be conceded that, without the provi-
sion of a penalty the principle of self-
assessment would be so open to abuse
by the fraudulent taxpayer, as to be
virtually unworkable. The position
is that there can be no penalty at all
bn an under-estimation unless the er-
ror extends beyond the permitted
■margin. When the error extends be-
yond the permitted margin, the pen-
alty is only 10 per cent, of the amount
of tax short-paid outside the permitted
margin.
The permitted margin is 20 per
cent, of the actual income and may
be 25 per cent, of the estimated in-
come. To illustrate this, it is explain-
ed that if the actual income is £100,
the margin of error allowed is £20.
The estimate may therefore, be £80,
the margin being 25 per cent, of that
amount.
The penalty is. in fact, extremely
reasonable. The weight of the penalty
is illustrated by the following ex-
ample:
Actual taxable income—£6,000.
Tax payable thereon 2,755
Income estimated by tax-
payer—£4,000 .
Tax payable thereon 1,468
Short-payment 1,287
Penalty for short-payment is £49/8/-,
calculated as follows;
80 per cent, of actual in-
come, £4,800.
Tax payable thereon 1,962
Tax payable on estimated
income of £4,000 1,468
Amount short-paid out-
side margin is 494
Penalty is 10 per cent, of
=£494 £49/8/-
Thus the penalty for short-pay-
ment of £1,287 is £49/8/-=3.8%.
As the short-payment would not be
called up until the next assessment is-
sued the penalty by the above ex-
ample could be fairly stated as being
equal to interest at the rate of 3 8
per cent per annum. This compares
favourably with the rate of interest on
bank overdraft which is, at present
4.75 per cent.
Purther examples showing the
weight of the penalty are—
Actual
Taxable Taxpay er’s
Income Estimate Penalty %
(a) £1,500 1,006 5 6 0 3 6
(b) £4,000 3,000 10 0 0 1 9
(c) 10,000 90 0 0 3 0
(d) 20,000 300 0 0 4 0
It will be seen that the nearer the
estimate is to the actual income the
ower , T 1 the interest rate repre-
sented by the penalty. This is evi-
denced by Example (b) where the in'
come was under'estimated by 25 per
cent, (i.e., 5 per cent, outside the
margin) and the penalty equals an in'
terest rate of 1.9 per cent.
If the income is, under'estimated bv
50 per cent, or more, the interest rate
represented by the penalty could ex'
ceed bank overdraft interest rates. It
is most likely, however, that such a
degree of under'estimation would oc'
cur only in circumstances where the
penalty would be remitted.
It will be seen that the provisions
of self -assessment grant great bene-
fits and are unlikely to cause hard'
ship to taxpayers. No penalty ap-
preaching reasonable interest on tax
short-paid is likely to be incurred ex-
cept in the case of fraud, deliberate
tax evasion or gross carelessness.
Since the above memorandum was
prepared further matters requiring
elucidation have been brought to no-
time, the Treasury adds.
These include;
(a) The complaint that at 31st.
March many people are un-
able, even in ordinary circum-
stances to estimate the level
of income for the year.
(b) For primary producers the task
is especially difficult because of
uncertainty regarding possible
receipts from wheat pools bar-
ley pools, 1.0. wool profits,
and the like.
(c) The belief that the penalty
clause will operate even in a
case in which under-payment
of provisional tax occurs be-
cause of something which oc-
curs after the due date for pay-
ment of tax and of which the
taxpayer did not have know-
ledge.
(d) In any circumstances, the pen-
alty is onerous.
All these difficulties will be resolv-
ed if taxpayers clearly understand
that—•
(1) No action to self-assess is re-
quired in any case before the
due date for payment of the
amount assessed. The earliest
due date is 31st March. The
majority will be much later
and may well be in May and
Tune.
(2) You are required to self-assess
only if the facts evident at the
due date for payment make
you reasonably sure that your
income will exceed last year’s
income by more than 20 per
cent.
(3) If—
(a) you accept the department'
al calculation of provision'
al tax (based on last
year’s jftcome); or
(b) you recalculate your pro'
visional tax,
and the income upon which
you pay provisional tax proves
to be less than 80 per cent, of
your actual taxable income,
you will incur a penalty in re'
spect of the short payment.
(4) You will not be penalized,
however, if the underpayment
occurred by reason of some
event occurring after the due
date for payment and of which
at that date, you had not any
knowledge—e.g., the receipt of
a distribution from a wheat
pool, approval for payment of
which had not been announced
at your due date. All that
need be done if this occurs, is
to advise the Deputy Commis'
sioner of Taxation when lodg'
ing your return of the facts un-
known to you at due date which
caused your underpayment.
(5) If you do incur a penalty
through failing to recalculate
when you should have done
so, you will find that, except
in most extraordinary cir-
cumstances, the penalty will
work out at less than bank in-
terest rate for the period of
short'payment. This is be'
cause the first 20 per cent, of
error is never penalized.

Plan For New
Calendar
Some Nations Pledge Support.
Is your birthday on March 31, )May
31, August 31, or December 31?
If so, the World Calendar Associa-
tion of New York, wants to take it
away. This body believes that its
new calendar will come into opera'
tion on New Year’s Day, 1956, by
order of the United Nations. And if
it does, those four birthdays will dis-
appear.
For many years industries and gov-
ernments have been troubled about
our calendar, with its months of vary-
ing lengths, our important annivers-
aries falling on different days of the
week each year. It has meant that in
some years workers have 51 pay days,
in others 53.
Order Out of Chaos.
The new calendar would bring
order out of chaos. Every year
would start on a Sunday and end on
a Saturday, as would each quarter.
In each quarter the first month would
be of 31 days, and the other two 30.
This system shortens the year, and
to make up the lost days the Asso-
ciations offers this solution.
When the last day of 1955, De-
cember 30, arrives the first day of
1946, January 1, will still be 24 hours
away. Between it will be a nameless
day, with no date and no description.
The plan is to make it a World
Holiday on which all the member na-
tions of U.N. would dedicate them-
selves to peace.
Opposition.
This nameless day would occur an-
nally. In a leap year another holiday
would become between Saturday,
June 30, and Sunday, July 1.
Apart from those who would lose
their birthdays, religious groups op-
pose the proposed calendar. The
scheme, they say will affect the days
of many religious observances, while
the two extra holidays, according to
their views, tamper with the divine
order of six days of labour followed
by one of rest and worship.
Calendar and diary manufacturers
are also concerned about the results
on their trade. No one will ever need
to consult a canlendar to see on what
day a date falls. It will be the same
every year!
However, several nations are sup-
porting the plan, and it is sure to
cause much discussion before the U.N.
General Assembly this year.
[Ed.: The United Nations assemble
for a specific job which it had better

Criticism of North Head Housing Plan
STRONG OPPOSITION TO PROJECT.
Proposals to convert the Quaran-
tine Station at North Head into a
residential area would not benefit the
general public, the Parks and Play'
grounds Movement said recently.
It decided to protest to the Federal
Minister for Health, Sir Earle Page,
the Premier, Mr. Cahill, and Manly
Council concerning the proposals.
The Movement maintains that if the
Quarantine Station were ever moved,
the 658-acre area should become a
reserve.
In recent years there has been an
agitation at Manly to open the area
for settlement. One businessman has
even offered a £lOOO prize for the
best housing settlement plan for the
area.
In the opinion of the Movement
(and countless others) too much of
the harbour foreshores has already
been alienated, and it was costing a
fortune to buy back these areas.
In deciding the future use of the
quarantine station area the public
should be given first consideration,
the Movement claims.
It considers that this gateway to the
City of Sydney should be retained as
public property. It does not object
to the station being located at North
Head, as it considers it is the most
convenient position available.

1000 VANDYKE HOMES ORDERED.
The Housing Commission has
placed an order with Vandyke Broth'
ers Pty. Ltd.. Villawood, for the erec'
tion of 1000 prefabricated homes
worth more than £1,000,000, or an
average of only £lOOO per home.
Work has already commenced on
the homes, which will be of eight to
ten squares, and of either two or three
bedrooms.
It is understood that half will be
erected in the city and half in the
country.
No. 1 Priority.
It is reported that there is consider'
able behind'the'scenes activity in Mac-
quarie Street as the result of the
Premier’s recent announcement that
housing would be No. 1 Priority.
The setting up of a Home Builders’
Bureau almost immediately following
the first Cabinet meeting is interpreted
as an indication that the Premier
means business.
The Housing Commission is believ'
ed to be speeding up its policy of
building brick and timberTramed
homes in the metropolitan and coun'
try areas on land which it has resumed
or purchased.
Experimental Village.
The Commission has also agreed to
a scheme put forward by the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects to
build an experimental village of 100
homes, each designed by different ar
chitects. The purpose of this scheme
is to show the unreasonableness of
many Government and municipal ord'
inances.
In designing the village, the archh
tects will not be bound by “a book
of 1919 rules” but will use their own
initiative to give as many variations
as possible to the theme.
The Minister for Housing Mr.
Clive Evatt, has endorsed the project,
and as a result. Sydney will get a re'
markable experimental village.
• Some of the houses will be built
with Bft. ceilings instead of the 9ft.
laid down by Ordinance 71 of the
Local Government Act.
• Some homes may be built with
concrete floors flush to the ground in'
stead of being raised by piers as re*
quired by the majority of councus.
• Other houses may be built with
flat roofs, metal roofs, and brick walls
painted or colourwashed.
• In some houses, experiments will
be made to dispense with the convex
tional laundry separated from the bath'
room and kitchen ,
All the above are now prohibited
by many municipalities.

STANDARDISED BUILDINGS
COMPLETED IN SIX WEEKS.
“Factory' made structural parts,
which can be assembled easily, ship'
ped to construction sites, lower the
cost of permanent industrial buildings
and make them stronger,” says “Com'
mercial America.”
Six weeks is a long time for many
construction projects, but for erecting
a large, permanent industrial building
it is an incredibly short time. Yet
that is the period within which the
Luria Engineering Corporation, with
headquarters in New York City, con-
structed not one but two storage build'
ings at the New York International
Airport (formerly called Idlewild Air'
port) early in 1952. Six weeks after
the firm received the order, the build'
ings were ready for use.
No magic was needed to complete
this job, unless modern mass produc'
tion and standardisation are called
“magic.” The Luria firm has adapted
those two techniques to the construe'
tion of steel industrial buildings, so
that both time and cost are kept to h
minimum. All of the welding on the
rolled steel frame is done before the
parts leave the firm’s plant at Bethle'
hem, Pennsylvania. Also, the parts
are sawed to the correct sizes, punch'
ed with holes for bolts, and painted
before they are shipped. At the site,
the construction crew needs only a
crane, bolts, wreches and a set of
erection instructions to complete one
of the standardised buildings.
But even within the limits of these
standard forms, the planners can vary
the facilities and appearance of the
buildings to suit the requirements of
most industrial firms. Doors and win-
dows can be placed in almost any
portion of the structure. Various
materials can be used to cover the
sides and roof of the steel frame. A
special front may change the appear'
ance of the building. The standard
units can be placed side by side for
a wide building or end to end for a
long one. In Argentina, the Luria
firm has supplied aluminium frames
and aluminium covering for 125 bar*
racks, each 23ft. x 45ft., totalling
125,000 square feet of floor space.
In Allentown, Pennsylvania, the or'
ganisation put up a single factory
building covering 130,000 square feet.
To standardise these building opera'
tions, the firm does as much of the
work as possible at its plant in Beth'
lehem. There the blueprints for each
project are prepared. When the de'
sign of the building follows one of
the three standard patterns, these plans
can be printed quickly because only
the indications of doors, windows and
any special features must be added.
Constantly, at the firm’s factory,
structural parts for these standardised
units are being fabricated and stored.
At this stage, mass production methods
save more time and more money.
Heavy cranes continually move the
steel to be marked, cut, punched,
welded ,and painted. Except for the
chalk'marking by hand to identify
units as they move through the plant,
machines take care of every produc'
tion step. Gusset plates for angles in
the structure are cut and welded in
place, if needed, reducing the amount
of work required at the construction
site.
These parts are then stored at the
plant. When an order for one of
these buildings is received, the parts,
complete with all accessories, includ'
ing bolts, nuts and screws, can be
shipped quickly. This large invem
tory of structural parts enabled the
firm to deliver enough material so
that construction on the buildings at
the New York International Airport
began only a week after the order
had been received. In another pro'
ject, the speed was just as impressive.
A plant in the neighbouring State of
New Jersey was destroyed by an ex-
plosion, and a complete steel building
was ordered. The materials for the
new structure arrived at the plant site
before workmen had had time to clear
away the debris of the old one.
Concrete foundations or just foot'
ings for the walls are often the only
structural preparations needed before
the construction of these permanent
steel buildings begins. Anchor bolts
embedded in the footings allow the
building columns to be aligned pro'
perly. Then the crane or other hoist'
ing device swings units of the frame
into place and workmen bolt them
together through the holes that have
already been punched in the steel.

A FEW WORKMEN FIXING A STANDARDISED ROOF.
A workman bolts roof beams to the trusses for one of two permanent steel structures erected
in 1952 at the New York International Airport by the Luna Engineering Corporation of
New York City, which has adapted modern mass production and standardisation techniques
to the construction of steel buildings for industrial purposes. These two storage buildings
were completed in six weeks from the time the airport officials placed the order. Structural
parts for standard patterns, fabricated, and stored at the firm’s plant, complete with all ac-
cessories—bolts, nuts, screws, etc. —are shipped quickly when orders arc received. Although
standardised, the firm’s patterns permit considerable flexibility so that the planners can vary
the facilities and appearance to suit the requirements of most industrial firms.

amount of unobstructed floor space

slorage areas.
The order from the New York
International Airport called for two of
these “A” frame structures measuring
40ft. x 500 ft. each and enclosing
20,000 square feet. A few days be'
fore the order was placed, another
port near New York City had been
closed and many regular flights had
been transferred to the New York
International Airport. This meant
that more space had to be provided
quickly for air cargo, and the airport
officials placed the order by telephone
on February 15. Since standard foun-
dation plans for the buildings were
readily available, a local contractor be'
gan pouring the concrete footings
without waiting for detailed engineer'
ing drawings. Within the next week,
the necessary structural parts had
been shipped from the firm’s stock'
pile. On February 22 seven days
after the order was placed construe-
tion began on the two buildings and
by the end of March they were com-
pleted and ready for use.
Luria buildings for airports are not
limited to the United States. In
Argentina, Great Britain, Turkey,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombo and
Saudi Arabia, either the national
governments or airline companies have
found that these standardised build-
ings met their needs for hangars,
workshops, or storage units. And
more than airports use them because,
in those countries and sixteen others,
they have been adopted as commercial
and industrial structures. In the
Philippine Republic, for instance,
there are six Luria warehouses, and
in Peru a paper mill has been built
from these standardised designs.
Other buildings have been built in
Pakistan, in Honduras, in Colombo,
and three textile manufacturing plants
in El Salvador.
Thus in many different parts of the
world streamlined construction methods
have supplied buildings quickly and
economically where they were needed.
For these standardised and mass*
produced structural parts are designed
to make strong and permanent build'
ings adapted to meet the particular
needs of each industrial user.
Adapting mass production and stan-
dardisation techniques to the construe'
tion of industrial buildings, the Luria
Engineering Corporation of New York
City makes easily put'together struc'
tural parts in standard sizes and shapes,
ships them to sites as ordered. These
streamlined methods have supplied
strong and permanent buildings in
many parts of the world quickly and
economically.

Flat, Eaveless Roof for Alaska.
Flat roofs, without eaves and para'
pets and with inside downpipes, seem
to be the best type for Alaskan build'
ings—hence, for other parts of the
world with similar climate. Alaska has
probably as great a range of climate
as any place on the globe. Thus, at
Whittier the mean annual snowfall
is 182 inches, and 105 inches have
been recorded in one month. The
annual rainfall of Whittier is 181
inches; while Anchorage, only 50
miles distant, has only 16 inches year'
ly.
Fairbanks, north of the Alaska
range, has recorded as high as 99°F.
above sero, and as low as —66°F. In
the Aleutian Islands the almost con'
stant wind reaches a velocity of 100
miles per hour, with occasion gusts of
120 miles per hour. The Panhandle,
or Southeastern Alaska has a mild
climate, with heavy rainfall due to
the Japanese Current. Moreover,
Alaska is subject to earthquakes;
hence, structures must have carefully
designed crumble joints.
The earlier permanent housing in
Alaska, such as barracks, had steel
skeletons with concrete walls, floor
slabs, and fireproofing of the struct'
ural steel. Roofs were of the pitched
type with standing'seam aluminium
roofing. The attic space housed the
ventilating equipment.

A copper mining camp in the
Andes, between Chile and Argentina,
is unique in that it is “upside down.”
The ore occurs high up in the moun'
tain and is dropped some 2000 ft.
through chimneys of solid rock. Min'
ers and supplies are hoisted, rather
than lowered, to their working places.
ROOF TYPES AND
SNOWLAND.
It has been found that the
pitched type of roof (top)
on the 500-man barracks
building in Alaska proved
vulnerable to overloading
caused by ice masses and
refroze at the caves. Also,
condensation developed in
attic space despite well-in-
sulated ceilings. The new
type of flat roof (below) is
receiving wide acceptance in
Alaska, where snow is usu-
ally dry and blows off. Bar-
racks shown are 200-man

RURAL BANK REVIEWS YEAR.
Progress Recorded Despite Conditions.
The 19th Annual Report of the
Rural Bank of N.S.W. for the year
ended June 30, 1952, disclosed that
the National Income for 1951/52
(disregarding movements in prices)
was estimated to be only 4% above
1950/51. This relatively slight up*
ward movement was in marked con'
trast to the jump of 36% which took
place in that previous year when in'
come from exports reached the un'
precedented peak of £982,000,000.
Rural Loans.
Under this heading the Bank
records loans to persons engaged in
any form of primary production for
purposes such as acquisition of land,
stock, plant and equipment, or for
working funds. Although advances
are available either by way of over'
draft or on extended terms, the figures
clearly indicate the preference for ac'
commodation on overdraft limit, ac'
cording to the Report.
During the year under review the
emphasis was on meeting the require'
ments of existing borrowers to further
develop and carry on their holdings,
rather than on catering for new bush
ness in view of the determined policy
of restraint in lending.
# Advances: In comparison with
the £3,850,285 advances in the pre'
vious financial year, loans for the
twelve months ended June 30, 1952,
totalled 599 for £2,199,570/18/1.
• Loans Outstanding: 10,085 loans
for a total amount of £14,902,865
13s. 9d. were current at the end of
the year comprising 9432 Overdrafts
totalling £14,547,399, and 653 Long
Term Loans totalling £355,466/13/9.
Home Loans.
During the financial year under re'
view, the Report stated, the Bank, as
did other financing institutions, dis'
couraged advances on buildings already
erected, and practically all new loans
made were for the purpose of build'
ing new homes, thereby increasing

It was felt that this policy had some
bearing on the steadying of the market
in the sale of completed dwellings,
particularly those of the older type.
This restricted policy has been re-
flected in the number of loans made,
but factors which caused many home-
seekers to discard plans for building
were high costs and difficulty of ob-
taining required materials and labour.
Loans granted during the year in-
cluded a large number of advances for

but also in new areas which are quick-

property, 1 property was sold, 13 loans
were repaid and 2 borrowers were per-
mitted to resume possession. The Bank
remained in possession of 71 proper-
ties.
Group Building Scheme.
The contractor for the Fairfield
Estate desired to be released from his
undertaking when he had completed
the 16th building, but has since pro-
ceeded toward completion of his con-
tract.
On this particular estate, 28 dwell-
ings were contracted for, 16 were
completed and disposed of (as at June
30, 1952) and 12 were partly con-
structed (at the same date).
On the Birrong Estate of 45 lots,
the Church of England acquired 3
lots during the year.
No building operations were under-
taken by the Bank on this or the re-
maining areas of Narwee Estate (7
lots), or Yagoona Estate (13 lots, as
resubdivided). The final planning of
Yagoona Estate was dealt with as fol-
lows: Sold to P.M.G. Department for
erection of Post Office (1), sold to
Yagoona Community Advancement
Co-Op. Ltd. for Community Hall (1),
sold to Presbyterian Church (N.S.W.)
Property Trust (1), retained for erec-
tion of Branch Bank premises (I),
held for future building or sale (7).
Lending Activities.
During the year under review ad'
vances were made as follows:
3096 Overdrafts: £4,764,067.
1654 Long Term Loans; £2,554,746

General Bank Loans.
In the year ended June 30, 1952,
accommodation by way of overdraft
limit was spread over a wide range of
industries. It included all purposes
not covered under the Rural, Home
and Personal sub-divisions.
Borrowers included proprietary and
public companies, firms, organisations,
co-operative societies and individuals.
The Bank felt that the assistance
granted to Co-operative societies pro-
vides a beneficial service to a com-
paratively large proportion of the
people of N.S.W., and a policy of
very sympathetic consideration was
consistently maintained.
In the period, overdraft limits
granted totalled £1,822,037, being 605
new and 255 additional. Balances out-
standing at the end of the year were
2610 for £11,495,100.

The lifting of building controls in
South Australia from the beginning of
February, although it means that many
big building project will come to life
in the future, has so far created hardly
a ripple in the building field. The
Act had already been so much relaxed
as far as home-building was concerned,
permitting houses up to 1,800 sq. ft.
without a permit, that its official
demise passed almost unnoticed.
One effect will undoubtedly be a
return to the pre-war practice of call-
ing on architects and builders to de-
sign and build the type of house the
prospective home-owner wants, rather
than the type which limitations on area
and cost per square have forced him
to accept. This will mean a better
type of house and greater variety in
both design and construction methods.
“Spec.” building construction of
houses for sale will undoubtedly
follow the removal of restrictions,
which have barred it completely. An
indication of the course which it may
be compelled to follow in the face of
high building costs is given by the
experience of an Adelaide contractor
who has been building under a group
scheme for the past four years. This
was on the same lines as “spec.”
building, but with orders already
nlaced for each house before construc-
tion began, and nermits for each house
granted separately.
This contractor undertakes to build
a brick house, with the dhoice of six
different designs, in four different
treatments of each, including cost of
land and fences, with stone front
fence for £l5O less than a Housing
Trust home. These, at from £2,800
for a three-bedroom house, are them-
selves reckoned the best “buy” in the
wav of homes.
The private group housing scheme,
it is claimed, gives a better choice of
house, choice of interior treatments,
including tiled bathroom, and choice
of a variety in minor details such as
power points, arrangements of win-
dows and colour schemes. This con-
trasts with the Housing Trust’s choice
of several completed houses in which
design and colour schemes may or
may not suit the individual. The con-
tractor is building 50 houses a year,
and has orders booked for the next six
months.
A temporary eddy caused by the
removal of building controls was a
sudden famine in cement, already a
scarce building material. Here the in-
crease in manufacturing capacity, one
of the official reasons for the removal
of controls, has not yet made itself
felt, and selling agents last month were

declinine orders until the backlog was
caught up.
This, according to manufacturers,
should be early in April. Already the
S.A. Portland Cement Company’s new
works at Angaston and the Adelaide
Cement Company’s expanded plant at
Birkenhead have between them in'
creased the State’s cement production
far above last year’s output of about
110,000 tons a year.
The Angaston plant began produc'
tion late last year, and although teeth'
ing troubles delayed full production,
it is now producing to its full capacity
of 80,000 tons a year. The new 440'
feet rotarv kiln at Birkenhead was lit
up at the middle of last month and
is producing to 75 per cent, of its full
capacity of about 150,000 tons a year.
The full production rate is expected
within a few weeks.
Local and interstate contractors have
played a big part in the construction
of both plants. The 275 ft., 9ft.
diameter kiln at Angaston was built at
Newcastle, N.S.W., by A. Goninan &
Co. Ltd. under the supervision of the
Danish designers, F. L. Schmidt 6?
Co. Other interstate suppliers were
Cockatoo Docks 6? Engineering Co.
Ltd., N.S.W. (raw mill), Malcolm
Moore Pty. Ltd., Victoria (belt con'
veyors), and Jaques Bros., Victoria
(hammer mill). Local firms supplied
most of the materials and carried out
construction and installation. Hansen
Yuncken Pty. Ltd. carried out all
building construction, Forwood Down

STRIKING PRE-STRESSED CONCRETE
BUILDING.
This striking building was erected for a
German Building Exhibition held in Hanover.
It was designed by Dr. Finstorwalder, of
Munich, and Professor Dr. Pistor, of Heidel-
berg, for the German Cement Association in
pre-stressed concrete to the design of Architect
Gutshow, of Hamburg. High grade cement
and alloyed spring steel, with a high “creep-
ing” factor were used. The steel was en-
closed in metal sheathing and after the setting
of the post-tensioned concrete, the space be-
tween the steel and the metal sheath was fitted
with poured concrete. The stand is retained
as a permanent restaurant.

THE VITAL GARAGE.
A garage was once a novelty in a house: today it is a necessity as the motor car has become more and more
indispensable in modern life. There are numerous ways of dealing with it in the design of a house; it can be
attached to it and become an intrinsic part of the design, if there is a slope in the land it can be incorporated
in the foundations, or it may be entirely detached or linked to the house by a wall or gateway. A recent devel-
opment is the car port, which is an open structure providing protection from the elements if not from the car
thieves. Three methods are illustrated in these four designs. Top left: a carport; Top right: under the house,
bottom left: alongside the house at a lower level, and bottom right: attached as an integral part of the design.

VERANDAH OR TERRACE.
The time-honoured open verandah on the front of a house—regardless of aspect —was considered the correct and
refined thing in Victorian days and after. Recently, however, sun terraces, porticos and sun rooms have taken the
place of the verandah and located in the correct orientation form useful and attractive adjuncts to the modern
house. None of these four examples have sun rooms, two are provided with terraces, one has a front verandah,
and all provide porches or other shelter at the door openings either front or back. They lend charm to the
appearance as is seen from the various elevational treatments.

Slagwool manufactured in Adelaide
by Bradford Insulation (SA) Ltd. was
used for insulation in both Angaston
and Birkenhead plants. Electrical in*
stallations at both plants were by F.
R. Mayfield Ltd., Adelaide.
The new Birkenhead kiln, the
largest in the Commonwealth, was im*
ported in sections from Germany, and
constructed and erected by Gibb &
Miller Ltd., of Adelaide, who were
also responsible for most of the
machinery installation and building
work.
Adelaide contractors played a major
part in foundation and site prepara-
tion work at Birkenhead. Pile-driving
and concrete construction was by
Wilckens and Burnside Ltd., of Nor-
wood. J. H. Leverington 5? Sons
carried out the tricky work of de*
watering the site to a depth
of 25ft., with a water table about 4ft.
below the surface.
Local firms expect to receive more
than half of the subcontracts for steel
fabrication and general construction
work for the £2,000,000 sulphuric acid
plant at Port Adelaide, for which
Simon'Carves (Australia) Pty. Ltd.
are the main contractors. One of the
biggest subcontracts has just been let
to Wilckens & Burnside. This is for
the concrete foundation work, which
is expected to cost over £lOO,OOO, and
is due to begin immediately.
Piling for foundations, with a base
of sand and seaweed over limestone
sub-soil, has presented special prob'
lems, and these have been met by the
use of the Franki method, newly in'
troduced into Australia from Britain.
The concrete piles, to depths from 38
to 50 feet, are not precast and driven,
but cast in place through a steel tube
driven into the ground, with concrete
forced through it to form a bulb at
the foot. Because of the high sulphate
content of ground water in the area,
an imported high-alumina cement is
being used.
Nearly 500 piles will support the
main plant and ancillary buildings.
Work began last month on piling for
ancillary buildings, and this is well
advanced, but piling will not be
finished for about six months.
The plant, which will be the world's
largest, will produce 100,000 tons of
acid a year—enough to make 300,000
tons of superphosphate—from newly*
developed pyrites deposits at Nairne.

the site within a year, and the plant
is expected to be finished by the end
of next year. It will be started up by
the main contractors and then handed
over to Sulphuric Acid Ltd., which
will operate it on behalf of Cresco
Fertilizers Ltd., the Adelaide Chemical
6? Fertilizer Co. Ltd. and Wallaroo-
Mount Lyell Fertilizers Ltd.
State Government contracts, which
fell off heavily last year with the cur-
tailment of loan funds, are beginning
to move again, especially for school
and hospital construction work. A
£38,000 contract for an infant school
at St. Leonards was let in January to
Marshall 6? Brougham, and work
began late last month. Tenders are
also being called for an infant school
at Renmark (closing March 25), a
primary school at Reidy Park, Mt.
Gambier (closed March 18), a high
school at Nar_acoorte (closed March
11) and hospital additions at Port
Lincoln (closing March 25).
The State Government has chosen
its time well to put these works in
hand. Many of the larger contractors
in Adelaide are low in work, prices
are becoming keenly competitive, and
Government works are likely to cost
less as a result. Where a year ago
tenderers would have to be hunted up,
now from ten to a dozen are offering
for most jobs. Builders are cutting
their overhead to tender at very low
figures in order to keep their organisa-
tions in work.
Federal Government contracts for
works totalling more than £300,000
have been let in S.A. in the past few
weeks. Some of the biggest are at
the Woomera Rocket Range, and de-
tails are of course “top secret.” One
Woomera contract let early this month
was for the trimming of an excavation
and the construction of a partly under-
ground reinforced concrete building.
Martin Construction Engineering Ltd.,
of Unley, were the successful tenderers
at £52,267.
Work has begun on the largest
single contract so far let for War
Service Homes in the Golflands area,
near Glenelg. This is for 64 houses,
at a cost of £164,000, let to Orlit
(SA) Ltd. Under other “group con-
tracts” of up to 30 houses, 79 homes
are already under construction.
Orlit’s parent company has pioneer-
ed the construction of concrete slab
house construction, but except for the
two experimental units the company
has not built in this medium here.
Most of its work has been in concrete
bricks and blocks for the Housing
Trust. The Golflands houses are in
burnt brick.
Major Works Department building
contracts include an office building at
Finsbury for Chrysler Australia Ltd.,
in connection with the firm’s work on
the Canberra bomber. Fricker
Brothers secured the contract early
this month, at a tender of £25,946 for
the two'Storey building, covering an
area of 88 by 44 feet, with outbuild'
ings. It- will be built of cream con'
crete bricks, with concrete floors.
A contract for the new Alberton
Post Office, a single'storey brick build'
ing with terracotta trim, and altera'
tions to the present quarters, was let
last month to Gaskin Bros. (SA) Pty.
Ltd. for £19,696.
Contracts let for work at Salisbury
airfield include the supply and de'
livery and stacking of 40,000 tons of
fine crushed rock, let to Quarry In'
dustries Ltd. for £41,000, and a
£41,450 contract to Hansen 6?
Yuncken Pty. Ltd., Torrensville, for
the erection of a steel hangar and pro'
vision of concrete foundations and
floors.

In the site filling, 115,000 yards of
soil will be carted from a point four
miles outside the town, with 45 trucks
on the job to complete the filling in
nine weeks. Heavy earth ' moving
equipment worth £50,000 is being
used to spread the soil. After filling,
the ground will be consolidated with
20,000 tons of water pumped from the
Port Pirie river. State Cabinet has
accepted a tender for the construction
of the works, but details have not yet
been released.
South Australia annexed the James
Wall Bowling Cup for the second
year in succession in a series of
matches played in Adelaide from Feb'
ruary 23 to 27 under the auspices of
the S.A. Builders’ and Contractors’
Association. Members of the building
and allied industries—l 6 from N.S.W.
and 21 from Victoria—competed
against local rinks.
Results were:—
purchase has brought some changes in
S.A. Housing Trust activities. About
half of the 5,000 prefabricated timber
homes imported from overseas by the
Trust for sale will probably become
available for letting, where the demand
is still strong. “Prefabs.,” at about
£2,700 each, have not taken on since
the housing position became easier,
and preference for the brick and stone
houses traditional to Adelaide has
reasserted itself.
There is a change also in the build-
ing of brick and stone houses for sale.
One contractor, with a contract fot
800 of these in northern suburbs,
after completing about 120 is trans-
ferring his work on the rest of the
contract to the south'western districts,
in the Marion area, where most of
the Trust’s building of homes for sale
is to be concentrated.
Work is well advanced on the filling
of the site for the Department
of Mines’ uranium treatment plant at
Port Pirie. The successful tenderer
for the £40,000 job, against stiff com'
petition, was the Port Pirie firm of
Arthur Hall ( Contractors) Ltd. The
site of the new plant, which is ex-
pected to cost about £1,000,000, ad-
joins the western boundary of the
B.H.A.S. Smelters works. It will be
the only one of its type in the

BRITISH BUILDING BRIEFS.
Twin Problems of New Towns.
Britain’s new towns are facing twin
problems— too high rents and too few
industries, the development corpora'
tions reported in their annual state'
ment in December.
Rents are being forced up by higher
building costs and increased interest
rates, the reports say.
One of the main problems is that
a British development corporation
cannot raise rents on its old proper'
ties; it is governed by the Rent Re'
striction Acts, and, unlike local auth'
orities, cannot increase rents after
houses have been first let.
Harlow, Essex, will have over 6000
dwellings by 1954. But, says its re'
port, unless the Government gets a
move on there will not be enough
factories to employ the people living
in the houses.

AUTOMATIC GARAGES FOR AUSTRALIA ?
SWISS INVENTION AROUSES WIDE INTEREST
Ingenious System Saves Time, Space, Money
Various Government instrumentalities and civic authorities are stated
to be very interested in the latest overseas innovation—Auto Silos,
or Automatic Garages to assist solve the mounting parking problem
in Australian cities.
The European version of automatic
garages originated with a Swiss firm,
Messrs. Ardag who are patentees of
the idea. Scott and English (Austra-
lasia) Pty. Ltd., of Sydney, hold the
sole Australasian rights of the system.
Recently Ardag appointed their as'
sociates in Germany to handle the
vhole operation of the patent, under
he name of Auto Silo, Heidelberg.
Plans are now proceeding for the
jrection of three Automatic Garages in
Germany— two in Stuttgart and one
n Frankfurt.
In view of the revival of civic in'
erest in off'the'Street parking prob'
ems, it is interesting to note that, ah
hough the principle of the automatic
garage remains the same, the actual
ize of the structure can be varied to
uit local requirements, such as the
ize of the site available and whether
n approach is possible from both
ides or only one.
The three garages planned for Ger-
iany vary considerably in detail.
jeneral Working Principle.
Plan No. 1 represents the view,
coking end on to the garage, show'
ing the boxes where the cars are
eventually stored to the left and right
of a central shaft. This central area
is reserved solely for the lifts by
which the cars are moved to the
floors.
In plan No. 2 can be seen the two
lifts (A and B). These lifts, whilst
raising a car vertically, can at the same
time move horizontally between
points C and D.
This action is illustrated in No. 3.
A car entering it, say, “A” could be
moved directly to space “B” because
while a lift was moving up vertically
it would, at the same time, be travers'
ing to the left and could be halted
u to ma tically opposite storage space
B, or, in fact, any other space.
The present design is such that
once a car has been halted opposite
the lift on the ground floor—in any
of the 6 openings—the longest time
taken to store it in one of the storage
spaces would be 60 seconds. This
period would be considerably short'
ened if the car were being stored in
a box nearer its entry point.
Several Variations of Design.
Several major variations have been
made from the original design.
One idea was that the car on its ar'
rival would be driven straight on to a
pallet and this pallet run into a lift
hoisted up, and car and pallet pushed
into an available storage space. This
idea has since been abandoned partly
because of the difficulty of storing
a large number of pallets (equivalent
to parking boxes available) on the
ground floor.
With the perfected system the
method operates as follows:
• Car is left, locked if desired, but
with hand brake released.
• An ingenious scissor-operating
mechanism emerges from the lift, grips
the front wheels, and raises them an
inch or so off the ground.
• The cqr is then drawn into the
lift by this mechanism.
• On arrival at the storage space,
the car is pushed out of lift in the
same manner.
It was originally envisaged that the
cars would be hoisted into their boxes
automaticallv by dialling a number on
Figure 1.
Looking end on to the
garage, showing the boxes
for storage of cars, to left
and right of central lift
shaft. Central area is re-
served solely for lifts by
which cars are moved up
and down, or transversely
across building (see No.
3).

an ordinary telephone system. This
is still perfectly possible but has not
been incorporated in the three gar-
ages which are planned in Germany.
An attendant is now in charge of
each lift which he operates either by
pushbutton or lever control.
Stuttgart Project.
Plan No. 3 is one of the garages
to be erected in Stuttgart. In this
project, cars will be driven into one of
the 6 bays, where the drivers will leave
them, collect their tickets and go
away.
It is proposed to only use every
alternate bay, the reason for this be'
ing that if someone drives his car
into a space next door to one already
occupied, difficulty might be found in
opening car doors.
However, these spaces can be used
as normal garage space for motor'
cycles, etc., but such is the operation
of the lift that any car parked in the
ground space can be picked up by
the mobile lifts.
Unless more than six cars arrive
simultaneously, there will be no ques*
tion of queueing and even those six
cars can be hoisted into storage in 60
seconds, the patentees claim.
Capacity of Garages.
It is considered that the most ecom
omical garage to construct would be
one of about 250-car capacity.
Scott and English Pty. Ltd. base
calculations on having 12 cars side by
side and 12 floors giving 144 car
boxes on each side of the lift shaft or
288 cars in all.
Space needed for such a building
would be, as Plan No. 2 shows, an
area 102 ft. long by 60 ft. deep, by
approximately 81 ft. high. At present
not more than 12, or at the most, 14
floors are recommended, but, accord'
ing to the length of space available,
so the car space can be extended
lengthwise almost without limit.
For instance, by doubling the length
to park 24 cars side by side, it would
be possible to operate with three lifts
for 576 cars, instead of two lifts for
the 288.
Hours and Staff.
The German garages will give
round'the'clock service. In each they
will provide an oil and petrol service.
For the operation of the garage itself
only one man will be on duty through'
out the night, and, in the daytime,
one man for each lift and possibly one
superintendent, who will handle book'
ings, cash, and so on.
Lifts.
The ingenious operating mechanism
is so designed that either lift A or B
can serve approximately 80% of the
total car boxes. Thus, if lift B broke
down lift A could serve all the spaces
except those marked 1. 2,3, 4 (Figure
In the event of an electric motor
failure in either lift, an emergency
hand lift can be used to empty the
remaining spaces.
Again, space can be provided for
parking out'of'action lifts at the rear
of each lift well, thereby enabling one
lift to serve the whole garage while
repairs are effected on the other mech'
anism.
Construction Costs.
The German organisation hopes to
erect the Stuttgart and Frankfurt gar'
ages for considerably below j£400 per
car space. It is intended to operate
these garages by a flat charge for the
night, but an hourly charge during
the day.
Calculating that the garage will be
60% in use throughout the year, the
whole capital cost, after allowing for
maintenance costs, will be recovered
in three to four years.
It is believed the estimate of 60%
total usage is conservative because
statistics show that existing garages in
Stuttgart are 80% fully employed day
and night throughout the year.
Parking, Old and New.
A comparison was made in Ger'
many of the time taken to extract a
car from the normal type of ramp
garage—built with a spiral driveway
up the middle. The average time is
such that it takes 12 minutes to reach
ones car and 15 minutes to get it out
of the garage.
In England 15 to 20 minutes for a
similar operation is by no means un'
usual.
In an Automatic Garage, the whole
operation of parking or delivering a
car is done in 60 seconds.

March 24. 1953.


On the Continent, the cost of
building an Automatic Garage com'
pared to a ramp garage of similar
capacity is such that the Automatic
Garage would cost some 80% of the
old'fashioned type, but it takes only
40% of the ground area.
This last figure of 80% includes
all mechanisms, etc.
Other Points.
The Auto Silo or Automatic Garage
shows these advantages by utilising an
entirely new method:
• Building costs are reduced by
using prefabrication methods and gen'
eral standardisation of components.
The space to garage one car is great'
ly reduced.
• The system is extremely adapt'
able to local prevailing conditions.
• The car is not touched by hand
during the parking process, thus can'
not be damaged.
• Danger of theft from cars, or
danger from exhaust fumes is elimin'
ated.
• Customer is relieved of difficult
manoeuvring.
• An extremely swift process of
parking and delivery of the car —an
average of one minute for each oper'
ation.
• Maintenance is simple, the gar'
age will accommodate every size and
type of car and shows distinct ad'
vantage on the score of price, effi'
ciency and space requirements.
Two Principle Parts.
An Automatic Garage consists of
two parts—(a) the building; (b) the
stowing mechanism.
The building comprises a structural
framework of either reinforced con'
Crete or steel and contains the boxes
which are situated on both sides of a
central gangway running the whole
length of the building. The boxes
are placed side by side on different
floors which are separated by ceilings
of very light construction, as they
carry only one car per box.
The central gangway is clear to
the top of the building and for the
whole length of the building and com
tains the stowing mechanism, which
has already been described in detail.
It is apparent that, because of the
special design, the type of construction
is such that building costs are greatly
reduced, as well as using less area.
This saving of space and cost can
make the building of such garages in
Australian cities an economic proposi'
tion, as well as being the only type
of garage which can be erected on the
limited areas now available.
COAL SHIPMENTS.
A total of 84 350 tons of coal left
Newcastle for interstate ports, Sydney,
and japan last week.
Coastal colliers took 31.000 tons
to Sydney, Victoria received 22,750
tons, South Australia 22,100 tons,
Japan 7500 tons, and Queensland 1000
tons.
“Building Costs
Must Come Down”
Says British Minister of Housing.
London Master Builders were told
recently by Mr. Harold Macmillan,
Minister of Housing, that somehow
or other, building costs had to come
down. He was speaking at the lum
cheon preceding the annual general
meeting of the London Master Build'
ers’ Association.
[Ed.: Everyone, even in England
as in Australia, seems frightened to
use the unpopular words “hard work”
and “longer hours” from which unions
have taught their men to shrink like
poison, even invoking laws framed
for the occasion, to compel them to
work shorter hours and exert less ef'
fort in the few hours they are on the
iob.
A good hard day’s work by every'
one on the job would soon bring
costs down. It would be safe to say
that every building today and every
other kind of production is carrying
the cost of idle hours.
The low standard of intelligence on
workers’ part is such that they cannot
see that they alone will be the losers
by pricing themselves collectively out
of individual employment, for no
building will be built until they work
harder.]
Supply Problems.
Re shortages of materials, he said:
“We shall be told that we are moving
through difficulties which we have
created by our own folly because of
the extent of our programme. You
are just as likely and, indeed, far
more likely, to move into shortages if
the target is too low than you are if
the target is too high.”
Appealing to builders and local
authorities to try to save bricks and
cement in 1953 by wise design and
careful use. the Minister said: “But
I am asking you not to hoard, but to
spend. I am asking you to use more
of them, to increase total productivity,
not to sit upon them and gloat like
misers over unused reserves.
High building costs were also re'
ferred to by Mr. D. E. Woodbine
Parish, retiring president, in present'
ing the 81st annual report, was more
to the point when he said: “The time
for paying lip service to the need for
increased productivity and cost reduc'
tion is past and unless the industry
collectively adopts a more vigorous
attitude of mind which will reflect a
far greater personal sense of urgency
to solving the problem than exists at
present, these two related and pertim
ent objectives will continue to prove
elusive.

British Architects
Honour Le
Corbusier
The Royal Institute of British Ar'
chitects have awarded the famous
French architect, Le Corbusier, the
Royal Gold Medal for 1953.
This amazing Frenchman, who has
a great hatred for little houses, little
gardens, and “abominable” great
cities like London has won unstinting
praise from the British.
He has always been a believer in
the “vertical city,” large, airy, sun'
absorbing blocks of flats in landscaped
parklands. He heartily opposes sprawl'
ing, unplanned cities with millions
living in cramped little houses.
Cities, Le Corbusier declares,
should have grass, space, and light.
As he sees it, the lives of men are
ruined by “the devouring mile,” his
term for the wasted hours spent in
travelling between house and office.
Le Corbusier sees neither rhyme
nor reason in this. According to his
plan, the entire population of large
cities like Sydney or Melbourne could
be comfortably housed within a circle
some 2f miles diameter.
Office workers would save travelling
time, yet they would be on the peri'
meter of the open countryside.
New Style of Living.
The towering structure of “Radiant
City which LeCorbusier has built in
Marseilles was described many times
in this journal, during construction.
Since its opening last October, it
has become the subject of debate the
wide world over. Le Corbusier advo'
cates describe it as “one of the great'
est buildings of the century, a para'
disc, a style of living the world will
adopt within 50 years.”
To others it appears as an eyesore,
a hovel a fantastic machine which
will drive people insane with too much
light, heat and noise.
The architect describes the huge
structure as a “gigantic bottle'rack de'
signed to hold prefabricated dwelling
units instead of bottles.” It comprises
17 storeys of glass and concrete, and
the whole building is raised on 20'
foot concrete pylons, giving the im'
pression that the mammoth building
is floating on air.
Self-Contained City.
Radiant City houses 1700 people
and is set in eight acres of grounds.
One entire floor is a shopping centre,
and can supply every possible require'
ment, including postal and banking
facilities.
On the roof there is a 330 yd. run'
ning track, gymnasium, solarium,
swimming pool and community cen-
tre, complete with creche.
Each of the flat units are 70ft. by
13ft., divided horizontally in part into
two floors which give bedrooms Bft.
4in. in height.
The remaining half with its enorm-
ous wall of glass at the end is a well'
lit living room.
Chutes take the garbage direct from
kitchenette to incinerator, and cup'
boards have been designed to open
directly on to public passages for the
delivery of foodstuffs.
There is a spacious restaurant in
the building and meals can be order'
ed for delivery, piping hot, to any
flat.
The rent for five rooms is £l2 per
month, with an abundance of hot
water and air'eonditioning included.
Although Le Corbusier gives ten'
ants many things that the average
small householder doesn’t get, he
claims he can build radiant cities at
a cheaper price than the equivalent
number of small homes.
Sub-Station Under
Domain
Cabinet has approved the construe'
tion of a Sydney County Council elec'
tricity substation under the Sydney
Domain.
According to the Premier, Mr.
Cahill, “the substation is essential to
meet the increasing demand for elec'
tricity in the central city area.”
The substation will be built below
ground near the Naval oil tank in
Lincoln Crescent, opposite Cowper
Wharf Road.
Mr. Cahill said the site proposed is
largely a steeply sloping bank, and
the council will restore the surface so
that the area of the Domain at the
public’s disposal will be increased.

BRITAIN’S WONDER FIRM
FACTS ABOUT THE I.C.I.
The 1.C.1. (Imperial Chemical In'
dustries Ltd.) is a British organisation
with so many ramifications that it
takes a 40'page book to contain its
annual report. This wonder firm man'
ufactures an extraordinary range of
items, from paints to sporting ammu-
nition, by way of fibres, plastics, en-
gineering, and chemicals.
This multi-million industry also pro-
duces zipp-fasteners and fog-signals,
and the housewife’s saucepans and hot
water tank very likely began life in
one of the 100 1.C.1. plants- situated
in the U.K. or elsewhere.
Yet of the 12,000 products manu-
factured from the raw material to the
finished packaging the only two chem-
icals to reach shop shelves with an
1.C.1. tag are table salt and washing
soda.
The quickest way to realise the
overall size of this vast firm is to
learn that its workers’ canteens take
1,000,000 a year for meals sold over
the counter.
Probably no other firm could let
1.100 employfees join the Services
for periods between 15 days and 18
months, as did 1.C.1. in Britain in
1951, when releasing its Territorials
and National Service trainees. And,
in surprising contrast, what little or
large concern loses only seven hours
out of every 100,000 in disputes.
Young Firm.
So vast is this giant industry of in-
dustries that no one man could have
created it. Yet under its present title
it is one of Britain’s youngest firms
— just 25 years old, with a turnover
touching £262,800.000 a year.
Before taxation is paid the stagger-
ing profit of this business is £1,000,000
per week, including sums for depreci-
ation and pensions.
The shares are divided out in vary-
ing quantities among some 250,000
shareholders in large and small parcels.
Small Beginnings.
The 1.C.1. grew from the gradual
amalgamation of small enterprises.
The first nucleus to form was in 1890,
vhen several heavy chemical firms be-
:ame the United Alkali Company Ltd.,
aut the present company has grown
from the grouping of four great firms
:hat today give Britain superiority in
:he world of organic chemistry.
Basically, the grouping of the
arms: British Dyestuffs Corporation
Ltd., Brunner, Mond and Co. Ltd.,
and Nobel Industries Ltd., with the
arst nucleus, aimed to deliver the
joods all the goods—in economic
:ompetition with foreign firms. Pre-
-1914 Britain had to depend for dyes
on German firms. Later, the nation
had to go to Chile for invaluable ni-
trates for chemical or agricultural in-
dustries.
Inter-Weaving Divisions.
In the period after World War I.
the British chemical industry had to
fight hard for a foothold on world
markets. Amalgamation seemed the
answer, and today it is possible to see
how the original plan, created by
Lord McGowan and Lord Melchett 25
years ago, is working in practice.
1.C.1. is one company of 11 inter'
weaving Divisions. Take, for instance,
a load of ammonium salts —the raw
material which the Billingham Division
will process. Some of their finished
work will go to the Nobel Division
as its raw material to be processed into
explosives.
Some part of those, in turn, is raw
material for the Lime Division in its
blasting in limestone quarries. The
lime gained there will go to the Aik'
ali Division for manufacture into soda,
which in turn will go to the General
Chemical Division to be made into
bleaching powder.
These interchanges of “Chemical
Magic” are endless with coal, salt,
lime, even water and air sucked out
of the atmosphere.
But the 1.C.1. is not content to re'
peat continuously “the formula as be-
fore.” Research and discovery had
brought new methods and materials as
substitutes for leather, steam-resistant
paints, a new fuse for deep mining.
There have been fresh investigations
into such complex subjects as “chem'
otheraphy”—the treatment of infec'
tion by chemicals; continued work on
fluoronitra-benzenes” that check fun-
gus growth; and the novel use of
plastic as clean, light and cheap parts
of surgical splints.
Chemical Empire.
There is constant expansion of this
vast chemical empire. On fixed assets
since the war they have spent
<£90,000,000, and plan to spend an'
other £78,000,000.
Not least in importance is the group
of departments in Britain that control
the overseas manufacturing and sell'
ing organisations that circle the globe,
in countries from A for Argentine to
Z for New Zealand.
The growth of 1.C.1. in a short 25
years is the answer to pessimists that
Britain is done,” for in a quarter'
century the progress and productivity
of this wonder'firm has put Britain
ahead of her rivals again and again.
I.C.LA.N.Z. ANNUAL MEETING.
The general demand for all goods
had fallen off during the year, the
Chairman of Imperial Chemical Indus'
tries of Australia and New Zealand
Ltd. Dr. F. T. Meehan, said at the
annual meeting held in Melbourne
last week.
Although supplies of raw material
had become more readily available, it
had been necessary to reduce the
volume of production at some of the
company’s factories, the chairman said.
If current import restrictions were
lifted, many industries would be ex'
posed to the crippling competition of
overseas manufacturers whose wages
were lower than in Australia.
Local wage and price levels had
steadied recently, but compared un-
favourably with those of other coun'
tries.
Research Building.
Dr. Meehan said that the company
would build a laboratory for biological
research in agricultural and veterinary
fields.
The tests carried out at the labora'
tory (the first of its kind to be built
in Australia) would help to improve
the productivity of agricultural and
nastoral industries of Australia and
New Zealand.
The site for the laboratory has not
been chosen, but most likely it will
be built in Victoria.
The director will be Mr. F. J.
Thomas, a leading entomologist of
England and Europe.
LATTICED “EYEBROWS.”
The skylight to this recent British school
is protected by latticed “eyebrows” which
eliminate the direct rays of the sun when
undesirable in summer but permit them to
gain entry in the winter.

Dams and

The Federal Reclamation Act was Si
50 years old in 1952; it was signed b
June 17 1902, by President Theodore 3
Roosevelt and established the Bureau u
of Reclamation, to supervise construe'
tion and operation of works for the a
reclamation of arid lands in 17 west" *3
ern states. It was later extended to o
embrace Alaska and the first work :d
was begun there in 1952. By means ar
of dams and reservoirs the Bureau, in n
cooperation with the Corps of En' *r
gineers of the Department of the 3j
Army, and other Government agen' **r
cies, has built 96 dams with storage s;
capacity of 82,780.000 acreTeet of Ic
water; erected 39 power plants with d:
capacity for generating 4,133,700 0(
kilowatts of power; strung 7,000 miles as
of transmission lines, built 16,000 0(
miles of canals; furnished water for ic
6,025,000 acres which now grows av
crops worth $650,000,000 (=£A.2B9.'
000,000) a year.
The cost in 1951 was $290,000 000 0(
(j£A. 128,900,000 and the total Gov' 'v
ernment investment is about $2
billion (£A.889,000,000); the amount 3n
returned in taxes since 1916 is $2
billion, and the amount of revenue re' '3
ceived from the sale of electric power is
reaches $35,000,000 (£A.15,600,000) (C
a year. The return to the states and br
individuals by increase in land values, ,a;
employment, transportation and mark' \jT
eting is regarded as incalculable.

THE BRIDGE COMES OF AGE
21st BIRTHDAY ON MARCH 19, 1953.
The Bridge has become such an in'
dissoluble part of the life of Sydney
that, like so many great things in our
heritage we tend to take it for
granted.
We should never forget, however,
that by all standards it is one of the
great engineering achievements of our
century and we therefore looked up
the special issue we published in
March, 1932, when the official open'
ing and the engineering aspects of the
Bridge were described in detail and
culled a few vital facts from the mass
of data available. Here it is:
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a
two'hinged arch bridge with a clear
span of 1,650 feet between abutments,
its overall length over the steel ap'
proach spans is 3,770 feet.
The main span consists of two sili-
con steel arches 98 feet 6 inches apart
with a rise of 350 feet at the centre
of the lower chord at the crown.
Truss depth at the crown is 60 feet
and at the end posts 187 feet 9 in.
Each truss is divided into 28 panels
and the lower chord varies in depth
from in. at crown to 102£ in. at
the hinges, the width being lift,
throughout. Cross sectional area at
crown is 1,060 square in. and at main
bearings 2,450 sq. in. (or over 17 sq.
feet of solid steel). Top chord varies
from to with lift,
width throughout.
Heaviest angle is 12in. x 12in. x
Ijin. and the thickest plate 2jin.
Largest rivet is IT3/32in. in diamet'
er and 14|-in. long Total alhup weight
of arch span, 43.000 tons of which
37,000 tons is steel. The amount of
steel in arch and approach spans,
52,780 tons.
As a pound of steel has a volume
of about cubic feet there is about
a quarter of a million cubic feet of
solid steel.
Arch rests on two pins at each end
on steel pedestals with a bearing area
of 504 square feet and transmitting
the maximum thrust of 43,500,000 lb.
to the abutments at 600 lb. per square
inch.
Top of arch above mean sea level
is 437 ft. and the top of pylons 285 ft.
Of the steelwork in the bridge
62i% is required to carry the dead
weight, 25% for its live load, and
5% for wind pressure. 5% for affect
of temperature and 2% for the brak'
ing of trains.
The bridge provides for four tracks
of railway (or tramway), roadway
57ft. wide (6 lanes of traffic), and
two footways. Capacity, 160 trains
per hour and 6,000 vehicles in both
directions.
It is designed to withstand congest'
ed loading of all traffic avenues —rail,
road and footway—affect of a hurri'
cane of 120 miles per hour and tern'
perature of 120°.
Built by Dorman Long 6? Co. Ltd..
of England, tender price of
*4.217,721/11/10.
Total cost including all charges
(interest, etc., during construction),
*6,230,000.
Work started January 5. 1925.
Bridge opened March 19. 1932.
Chief Engineer to N.S.W. Govern'
ment: Dr. ]. ]. C. Bradfield.
Two salient facts emerge: How for'
tunate we were to have built it when
we did (what would today’s costs be?)
and what a pity the toll causes the
congestion and irritation that it does.
A Modern Approach To Dishwashing
To the trend of fitting the modern
home with every possible aid to the
housewife comes a completely new
home'aid now about to be introduced
to this country.
The unit, advertised for the first
time in this issue, is the “Sentinel
“Sink Unit” with dishwashing attach'
ment —a built'in aid that is a real
boon.
The Sentinel takes the place of
the hot and cold taps normally fitted
to the sink and to it can be fitted a
detergent tank and a washing brush,
to lessen the time of washing up.
This detergent wash and clear rinse
means that rack drying really comes
into its own. and the builder who fits
a Sentinel could take the advantages
of built'in draining racks to go with
it.
The production models are compact
and their quality and appearance such
that it will grace any home.
We understand from the distnbu'
tors that the Sentinel will be available
in April and that it is suitable for use
with any storage hot water system.
The only word of warning they give
is, that while the unit operates over a
very wide range of pressures and is
factory tested down to a few pounds,
there is a minimum of pressure be'
low which the unit will not operate.
Mains pressure units and displacement
type roof model storage systems are
quite satisfactory so too are falling
level type heaters, at least in factory
tests. The only doubt would be with
extra squat falling level type heaters
when almost emptied. While such
heaters will operate a Sentinel satis'
factorily in tests, they do run close to
the mark and the distributors reconv
mend a displacement type if roof
model heaters are used. Floor model
heaters are also satisfactory providing
they have a pressure head of about
eight feet above the Sentinel.

FACTS AND FIGURES.
Lime and cement traders in Sydney
complain that the road tax imposed
(so that trucks could not compete
with the over'burdened'in'running'
costs railways) have put trucks off the
road. The railways cannot deliver
cement fast enough. One firm com'
plains that they are not only losing
customers but they had to put off 60
men. Merchants do not want a thing
like that to overtake them in their
sincere and strenuous endeavours to
carry on.
Three months’ operation of the
new diesel electric express service
from Port Pirie Junction to Kalgoorlie
(W.A.) was completed this week.
During this time 42 round trips were
made between the two terminals and
approximately 11,000 passengers
carried.
Both the air'conditioned German
trains of nine cars each have been
in continuous service and the time
saved under the new schedules has
been eighteen hours per trip. Com'
pared with the former steam train
service, the time of the journey has
been nearly halved to twenty Tour
hours.
Holland exports £ 15,600,000 worth
of bulbs per year.
CORONATION DECORATIONS.
Coronation preparations in Britain are forging ahead as plans move from blueprints to models,
and construction work begins. Majesty and gaiety along the Mall is the effect intended when on
June 2 Queen Elizabeth will drive uuderneath four arches built from this model, which has
been approved by the British Ministry of Works.

Engineers Called “Salt Of The Earth"
Only 12 highly qualified engineers
have been members of Parliament in
the last 50 years.
And in that period 5,000 to 6,000
men have sat in our Parliaments.
The Minister for External Affairs.
Mr. R. G. Casey, quoted these figures
last week to delegates of the Austra-
lian Institute of Engineers’ Confer-
ence at Melbourne.
Mr. Casey said: “Engineers are the
salt of the earth, and I hope they are
not content to avoid policy making.
“We need men of their calibre in
Parliament ” he added.
(“Who’s Who in Australia” says
“Casey, Rt. Hon. Richard Gardiner —
C.H., 1944, D. 5.0., M.C., 8.A., Gov-
ernor of Bengal, 1944-46; U.K. Min-
ister of State in Middle East., Aust.
Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary to U.S.A., 1940-42;
M.H.R. for Corio, 1931-1940. Edu-
cated Melbourne Church of England
Grammar School, Melb. and Cam-
bridge Univ. as an Engineer with
honours degree in Mechanical Science.
Enlisted 1914; Major D. 5.0.. 1918;
connected with mining and engineer-
ing companies 1919-1924; Fed. Treas-
urer, 1935-1939.”
This is but a tithe of this man’s
achievements, hence he should know
the value of Engineering Science
which can be applied to every walk
of life.

IT TAKES ALL SORTS.
There is a well-known saying that it takes all sorts to make a world and the same remark could equaĺy be
applied to house, for, like people, mo matter what shape or size, they aĺ come under the category of a house.
Take this quartet for instance in the bottom right we have stepp-pitched romantic; top right, sedate and solid;
top left, broken, doping roof and rough stone walls, and bottom left, square, flat roof with small windows .
plans vary just as much as the elevations.
