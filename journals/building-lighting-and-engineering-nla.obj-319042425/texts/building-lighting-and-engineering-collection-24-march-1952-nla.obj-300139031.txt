“SPIROTO
Voltage Regulators
for
Complete Control
For capacities in excess of 100 kVA
Brentford "Spiroto" regulators developed for the control
on-load of large transformers, provide stepless voltage regu-
lation by rotating centre core and coil assembly, simultaneously
raising or lowering the brushes by a lead screw, thus keeping
them always on the helical copper winding.
"Spiroto" is operated and controlled covering the whole
range in 1|- minutes. Unaffected by frequency variation and
having a high efficiency it does not affect the power factor
of the circuit being controlled.

THE PAINT PIGMENT
with A DIFFERENCE
The main difference between Alpaste and
other paint pigments is that it is not
granular in form. Alpaste consists of com-
mercially pure "atomised" aluminium,
which, when milled and polished, produces
tiny, flat and very thin leaf-shaped particles.
These particles arrange themselves in over-
laooing parallel layers when mixed with suit-
ible vehicles. The result is an improved and

It seems odd to bracket some-
thing “as big as a house” with
such a little thing as a nail or a
wood screw. But without these
and other types of S.C. “Little
Importants” many a man would
not be able to “call a home his
own” today. Sidney Cooke are
looking to the day when they
will be able to fit in with all your
building plans by supplying such
requirements as Clouts, Roofing
Nails, Brads, Wood Screws, etc.,
in bigger quantities.
In the meantime labour
shortage is a major prob
lem, but as the labour
position improves so,
too, will the flow of
the S.C. “Little
Importants.”

HOFFNUNG'S CELEBRATE
CENTENARY
FINE SYDNEY PREMISES.
A PROUD RECORD OF
ACHIEVEMENT
On January 7, 1952, the firm of S.
Hoffnung celebrated the hundredth annu
versary of its foundation.
In 1852 Mr. S. Hoffnung,
from England, commenced trading in
Sydney at No. 8 Wynyard Lane. Today
their branches and interests cover all parts
of Australia and many countries abroad.
In 1939 Hoffnung’s moved from their old
premises in Pitt Street (where the extern
sions to the G.P.O. are now) into their
fine new building at 153'159 Clarence Street,
with a floor area of 150,000 sq. ft., which
we illustrate.
Architects were Samuel Lipson 6? Robert'
son, Marks 6? McCredie (in association) and
the Builders: Kell 6? Rigby.
THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
WHAT WILL AUSTRALIA DO?
The Olympic Games have been much in the public eye in
Australia of recent months while the unfortunate squabbling
regarding the site in Melbourne for the 1956 Games has
been going on. At the same time our athletes for the
current Games at Helsinki have been selected and all wish
them every success. It is sincerely to be hoped that now that
the controversy regarding the site appears to be resolved that
something attractive and distinctive in the way of appropriate
buildings to serve the Games will be produced for visitors
from all parts of the world to see. We illustrate the im-
posing entrance to the Sports Field that was erected for the
Games in Germany in 1937.

Architecture Today and Tomorrow
ARCHITECTS STAGE INTERESTING EXHIBITION.
Farmer’s Blaxland Galleries, March 17—April 4.
By ADRIAN ASHTON.
“Because it has been difficult to
build over the past few years owing to
scarcity of materials and the high
cost of labour, we must not allow our-
selves to drift into accepting the tem-
porary and the makeshift,” said H.E.
the Governor of N.S.W., General Sir
John Northcott, in opening the Ex-
hibition, “Architecture Today and
Tomorrow” presented by the N.S.W.
Chapter of the Royal Australian In-
stitute of Architects at Farmer’s Blax-
land Galleries on Monday, 17th
March.
“We must persevere in our efforts
to erect buildings for all purposes—
churches, hospitals, factories, offices,
and, of course, homes—until all our
needs are satisfied,” continued Sir
lohn. “I have laid an enormous
number of foundation stones in the
nast few years and although a nu r -
ber of the projects have been brought
to fine fruition, many still remain as
they were laid with no further pro-
gress. Some,” he said, amidst laught-
er, “have, in fact, had to be re-
moved to prevent them from being
souvenired.”
Interest For All.
In selecting and arranging an ex-
hibition of this type, which is prim-
arily to instruct, inspire and stimulate
the public in the appreciation of archi-
tecture and just what the architect
does and can do in the solution of
their building problems, great care is
necessary to select good examples rep-
resentative of all shades of architectur-
al thought as applicable to buildings
for all purposes.
In this respect it can be said that
the organisers have done their work
well for they have presented some 300
exhibits representing the work of
eighty odd architects and have group-
ed it into sections: Houses. Flats,
Industry, Commercial Buildings,
Schools, Recreation, Hospitals, and
Churches, the work actually on dis-
play only being a small proportion of
that submitted by practicing members
of the Chapter.
While not mentioned in the official
title there is a certain element of
“Yesterday” too, for a proportion of
the drawings and photographs repre-

sent some important works that have
already been erected in previous
years. This, however, is comparative
only for Today is Yesterday, To'
morrow.
The Contemporary Style.
The dominating, though perhaps
not the dominant, note of the exhibh
tion is the emphasis on houses erect'
ed in what for want of a better word,
is called the Contemporary Style. The
architects who favour this type of
house are mostly crusaders and see
themselves as prophets bringing light
and inspiration to the darkness of
those who do not see in their crea-
tions the last word in architectural ex-
pression. They are naturally forceful
in portraying their message and the
main central curved panel is covered
with a series of very large and very
fine photographs of a number of fairly
recent houses in this style, some oi
which have, however, oeen so we’l
publicised previously that they will
not be new to many.
So much has been written of the
relative merits of modernism v. tradh
tional that to add to it would be to be
wasting time and precious paper, but
one cannot help being struck by the
marked similarity of the approach—
flat roof, glass walls, bare surfaces,
trick staircases and fireplaces—that
some of the criticism of blind repe'
tition levelled against the house con'
ceived in the spirit of traditionalism
could almost be boomeranged against
the protagonists of the new order.
Be that as it may, change and striv'
ing were even better than complac'
ency and apathy and if architecture is
to remain a living and a dynamic
force in the community, as it should
be, this constant seeking for new and
better forms is a symbol of the virility
of this ancient Muse.

BUILDING, LIGHTING AND ENGINEERING


Before leaving this aspect of the Ex-
hibition it is interesting to the archi-
tect observer to note trends of mod-
ernity as portrayed by the various ex-
ponents and it almost seems that ma-
turity of years brings with it a modifi-
cation of more youthful extravagances.
Thus the “infant terrible” of yester-
year in due course finds himself de-
posed by yet another who, he believes,
has in his satchel all the answers.
One would sometimes wish that the
exponent of the new —be it art,
music, literature or architecture —
would not be quite so all-embracing
in the denunciation of all that is in
the past, for history does not alto-
gether prove the reliability of this
assertion and indicates that progress is
rather a series of fits, starts and diver-
sions, but all tending towards a com-
mon end. But perhaps the prophet who
saw any health in the subject of his
denunciation or searched his own soul
too much may waver and so cease to
be a prophet. Frank Lloyd Wright,
for instance, is never wrong, nor is
Le Corbusier, though one can im-
agine Walter Gropius doing a tack in
his course if he believed truth and
sincerity demanded it.
Industrial Design: High Standard.
The standard of design of the pres-
ent day factory in Australia is very
high, a fact that is borne out not
only by the many well-known ex-
amples that we see about us but also
in the attractive perspectives of many
important projects that are hung in
the exhibition. Some, perhaps, will
remain pious hopes but many, as prob-
lems of material procurement and high
costs tend to adjust themselves will
be erected to provide ideal conditions
for those who work in them.
Ambitious Projects.
If all the fine city buildings that
we see were erected it would once
again be possible to obtain office space
without key money and the other
devious means that at present prevail.
The Minister for Building Materials
has said that as production reaches
demand, restrictions and controls will
be progressively eased: it cannot be
too soon for the long-suffering busi-
ness community, while many an ar-
chitect with one on his board would
give a whoop of joy.
There are also masses of commun-
ity centres, swimming pools, clubs,
hospitals, churches and innumerable
other projects needed for a commun-
ity to live a balanced life, though if
everything is to continue to be sacri-
ficed on the altar of housing very few
will ever see the light of day.

The Work of an Architect.
Many, too I many, members of the
public have the haziest of ideas just
what an architect does. Some think
he draws a “pretty picture”—and gets
jolly well paid for doing it, others
think he jots down a few ideas and
then tells the builder to go to it. In
order that the many-sided work of an
architect can be thoroughly appreciat-
ed an excellent exhibit has been ar-
ranged showing the development of a
project from instructions, through
sketch plans to working drawings,
specifications and quantities to details
and supervision, while copies of an ex-
cellent little brochure entitled “The
Work of an Architect” are available
free to amplify this pictorial explana-
tion.
Altogether it is an excellent Exhi-
bition and achieves what in the well-
produced catalogue it says it aims to
do.
“This display has only to be ex-
amined to see with what success the
essential problems of the building
public have been solved, how the ar-
chitect of today identifies himself with
his client’s programme and interests,
with what skill he adjusts his theories
to the common cause of producing
practical buildings and yet at the
same time manages to perform his
traditional duty in producing fine
buildings which are a pleasure to the
eve and a delight to the mind.

George A. Taylor
Prize 1951
For Outstanding Apprentice.
The George A. Taylor Prize, annu-
ally awarded by the Master Builders’
Federation of Australia to the most
outstanding Apprentice in the Build'
ing Industry, has been won by Mr.
William John McLure, an employee
of Messrs. A. W. Edwards Pty. Ltd.,
Glebe, Sydney.
Aged 20, Mr. McLure was educat-
ed at Granville Primary School, and
later took a Building Trades Course
at Granville Technical School, where
he proved a brilliant student.
At present, Mr. McLure is doing a
Clerk of Works Course in the Archi'
tectural Section of the Sydney Tech'
nical College.
This course entails attendance at
the College for three nights a week
over a period of three years.
The George A. Taylor Prize is a
highly'coveted award, and annually
attracts many entrants. This year
about 50 apprentices sat for the ex-
animation in Sydney.
Mr. Austin Edwards told “Building,
Lighting and Engineering” that he
was personally very proud of Mr.
McLure’s achievement in winning the
Prize.
He had always shown considerable
Electricians Warned
By Prices Commissioner.
The Prices Minister, Mr. Finnan,
has warned electricians as a result of
excessive charges being made for elec'
trical repairs and installations.
He stated that unless charges were
decreased he would consider reimpos'
ing control of prices. Since granting
de'control in 1950, Mr. Finnan said,
prices have soared unreasonably.
[So have wages, a rise of £2/11/0
in one year is enough to make all
materials rise at a pro rata rate. Ser'
vices have doubled'up on themselves.
Controls, which we have never ad'
vocated and which is anathema to
our establishment, ought to be ap'
plied to government and semi'gov'
ernment organisations.
One house at Vaucluse is charged
£1 a week for electricity. There is a
bath heater (switched on from 10
p.m. till 8 a.m. each day), two re'
frigerators (all day), and lighting
used only from 9.30' 11 p.m. each day.
How they can load a private home
for three persons to total £1 per
week is surely a matter for investiga'
tion and controls —but who can con'

promise, Mr. Edwards said. For
many years Mr. McLure, senior, was
a foreman in the employ of Mr. Ed'
wards’ organisation, and he had ah
ways predicted a brilliant future for
his son, who invariably topped his
class in every grade.
Mr. Edwards added that apprem
tices in his employ had won the
George A. Taylor Prize three times
out of the last four examinations.
Mr. McLure told “Building, Light'
ing and Engineering” that he natur'
ally felt very pleased with his achieve'
ment, and he looked forward to a
prosperous future in the building in'
dustry.
He said he felt that such an
Award, won in open competition,
generated the right spirit among both
employers and apprentices, and wr
well worth emulating in other trades.
For his part, he owed much to the
encouragement received from Mr.
Edwards, and the advice and counsel
of men who had spent a lifetime in
the building industry.
Surry Hills
Residential
Scheme
Exclusive Living Area Planned.
The Sydney City Council Planning
and Improvements Committee last
week decided to implement a scheme
to declare Surry Hills a residential
area.
The scheme is part of a detailed
development proposed by the council
to establish an exclusive living area
stretching from Elizabeth Bay
through Kings Cross, Darlinghurst.
Surry Hills, Redfern, Waterloo, and
Gladesville.
This detailed scheme comes within
the broader Cumberland County
Council master plan for Sydney.
If finally adopted by council and
proceeded with, the decision will mean
that no new industry or business will
be permitted inside the proclaimed
living area.
The first step will be to exhibit
plans and models of the proposed
scheme at the Town Hall. These will
be on view for a period of six months,
during which objections can be
lodged.
In 1947, the council decided to
seek the Governor’s approval of the
plan under the terms of the City Cor'
poration Act.
When objections were lodged, Mr.
J. T. Monaghan was appointed Com'
missioner to conduct a public inquiry
into the proposal. Mr. Monaghan
heard evidence from August 21 to 31
last year.
The Under'Secretary for the De'
partment advised last week’s council
meeting that the Minister was of the
opinion that the proposal was not
one which should be recommended
for approval to the Minister.
Instead, the Minister considered
that control of development in the lo'
cality designated would be more sat'
isfactorily achieved through the local
planning scheme.

Queensland’s Progressive State Schools Permits for

By F. O. NIXON.
If the architecture of the Old World
had reached a pinnacle of beauty and
suitability for the needs of the time
and place, beyond which further pro-
gress was impossible, many, many cen-
turies ago, it cannot by any stretch of
imagination be said that in the main,
architecture of Australia was not and
is not lacking in almost everything
within the modern category of sound
architecture.
The relative importance of remedy'
ing shortcomings must be greater in
the case of schools than in any other
class of buildings. Surely, if slowly,
improvements are being associated
with the state of schools of Queens'
land, which recognise the aesthetic
gains, of superceding the drab, so long
associated with State schools.
In the Brisbane Metropolitan School
featured on these pages will be seen
a new type where hills and dales are
used to the fullest advantage.
The Kelvin Grove group of school
buildings occupies a site to the north'
west of the city, with uninterrupted
views towards Mt. Coot-tha (Bris-
bane’s natural 900 ft. bird’s-eye view
of the city) and the Taylor Range.
The school illustrated is the Infants’
School, and forms one of this group
of schools in the immediate vicinity,
consisting of the Infants’ and Primary
Schools and, a little way removed, the
North Brisbane High and Intermediate
School and the Teachers’ Training
College.
In this group, two schools have
been rehoused in new buildings which
exhibit marked advances in school de-
sign, including larger classrooms, gene-
rous provision of natural light and
improved school furniture.
Construction generally is of brick,
comprising basement, sheltered play
area, and ground and first floors used
for classrooms.
The construction provides for fire-
proof circulation, including concrete
floors to corridors and stairwell.
The bricks selected are pleasing,
light buff, which, with the tile roof
and white-painted woodwork and light'
coloured cement trim, have provided
a refreshing building of businesslike
appearance in which emphasis has
been placed primarily upon suitability
and from which has flowed a most
satisfactory architecture.
The difficulties of the site have been
converted to advantages. Necessity of
truncation and off-the-square planning
being combined to give entrance em-
phasis without traditional monument
talism.
Slopes that would have otherwise
been excessive have been formed,
terraced and turfed, emphasising the
dominating position which the school
occupies.
The arrangement of the plan pro-
vides a sheltered play area between
the wings of the building. Orientation
assures beneficial breezes and excludes
unfavourable westerly winds which
otherwise sweep the site —too cold in
Winter, too hot in Summer.
Interesting experiments in the use
of cokmr are a source of interest.
Commencing from the basement,
colour has removed the characteristic
dinginess and inhospitability so often
associated with school shelter.
In the classrooms endeavour has been
made to minimise reflected glare, a
problem of some significance, and re-
move institutionalism by its varied em-
ployment so that the colour of doors
changes happily from room to room.
The building was erected by day
labour by the Construction Branch of
the Public Works Department.
The design and plans development
were executed by the architectural staff
under the direction of Mr. A. B.
Leven, F.R.A.1.A., Chief Architect,
since retired from office.
Remembering all the pains of
present-day building operations this is
a fine job.
For Urgent Repairs and Services.
Persons requiring galvanised iron
water pipe to connect new homes to
water mains, or for repairs to existing
services, may now obtain supplies
through permits issued by the Met'
ropolitan W. 6? S. Board.
Announcing this, the Minister for
Secondary Industries and Building
states that his department has given
approval to the reintroduction of the
“Merchants’ Copy” system, which
was discontinued some time ago.
Under this procedure the Water
Board will issue plumbers’ permits
with a duplicate “Merchants’ Copy”
on the basis of the following priorities
(to be nominated on this duplicate:-
(1) Burst services (up to three
lengths of pipe) or otherwise as de-
termined by the Board; (2) New
homes, schools, and hospitals, and
for additions to homes where extra liv-
ing accommodation is being provided
(but not otherwise); (3) Essential
repairs on the previously established
basis that essentiality would be gov-
erned by the Board’s inspectors estab'
lishing that sanitary services were urn
satisfactory according to the Board’s
standard; also by arranging special
inspections where requirements of
pipe exceeded a certain standard limit.
These “Merchants’ Copy” dupli-
cates will subsequently be lodged by
Master Plumbers when placing with
merchants their covering orders, and
merchants have given assurances that
they will give preferential delivery to
all orders covered by these “Merch'
ants’ Copies.”

THE ROYAL HAYMAN HOTEL
£250,000 TROPICAL PLEASURE RESORT.
Many Building Difficulties.
The establishment and construction
of the Royal Hayman Hotel is a re-
markable story of determination and
perseverance on the part of Mr. R.
M. Ansett, Managing Director of
Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., to
realise a long-cherished dream to build
a tropical pleasure resort and hotel
that would match any of the world’s
famous island playgrounds.
The first definite step was taken in
1947, when Mr. Ansett made a tour
of the islands in the Whitsunday
Group and, after an exhaustive three
weeks’ survey, he bought for £12,000
the perpetual lease of Hayman Island
from Captain Hallam, who had
operated it for several years as a
tourist centre. He also bought Day-
dream Island from Captain Moody,
and also made application to the
Queensland Government for a per-
petual lease of Henning and Gold-
smith Islands in the Group.
Hayman Island Selected.
Following these negotiations, a
party of architects and engineers made
surveys of the four islands and finally
selected Hayman, which is three miles
long and a mile wide and is the most
northerly and the nearest to the Outer
Barrier Reef.
Eighteen miles of water separates
the island from the closest mainland
base at Cannonvale, and the town of
Proserpine on the railroad is 14 miles
farther inland. The island itself con-
sists of a horseshoe-shaped mountain
which rises to a height of 800 feet
and contains at the base of its curve a
natural tree-clad flat, fronted by a
sweeping sand beach facing south to
the Whitsunday Passage, and this flat
was the natural building site for the
hotel.
Beyond the beach lies a half-mile
wide coral reef which fronts the
southern half of the island. Exposed
at low tide and covered by 10 feet of
water at high tide it was obvious that
this reef would allow no alternative to
the use of barges for transporting sup-
plies to the island as they would be
the only craft capable of bringing com-
paratively large cargoes right up to
the beach.
After plans for Hayman had been
drawn up and submitted to the
Queensland Government, a permit for
the work to be carried out was issued
for an hotel to cost approximately
£lOO,OOO, which was the cost then en-
visaged.
Building Problems.
The first of many building problems
arose when innuiries to Brisbane and
Northern Queensland builders reveal-
ed that no contractor was willing to
carry out the work, for they believed
it would be too difficult to construct
such a huge undertaking so far from
the mainland.
Mr. Ansett, therefore, with charac-
teristic energy and initiative, set up his
own works division under the direction
of Barrier Reef Pty. Ltd., the com-
pany that had been set up to imple-
ment the project.
Plant and Material Purchased,
A supply base at Mackay was set
up and a builder chosen to take charge
of operations on the island. Plant—
bulldozers, generator sets, concrete
mixers and woodworking machinery
—at a cost of £20,000 was purchased.
Materials for the hotel were gather'
ed from all over Australia and many
parts of the world, from the United
Kingdom to China. More than half
the cement used had to be imported
direct, likewise all tiles and many of
the fittings. The only materials avail'
able for use on the island were stone,
sand and coral. Everything else had
to be imported.
To ensure reliable communications
at all time between the Island and the
mainland a radiotelephone set was in'
stalled at Hayman and Daydream
Islands and at Mackay.
It was originally intended to con'
struct the whole of the buildings of
concrete made of Hayman sand and
crushed coral, but it was discovered
that because of the general shortage
of cement throughout Australia this
scheme would have to be modified,
and preference was then given to tim-
ber, which was in plentiful supply in
Northern Queensland.

plies was complicated, as their arrivals
and departures, both at Hayman
Island and at Cannonvale, were die'
tated entirely by tide levels. Loading
and unloading therefore had to be
carried out regardless of time of day
or night.
Extensive Labour Turnover.
Although building of the project
dates from March, 1948, when the
builder'in'charge and a small party of
workmen arrived on the island, it was
not until the end of that year that the
first signs of the new hotel began to
be visible among the grove of native
trees on the flat.
Few people choose to live and work
in isolated places, devoid of urban
amenities; fewer still care to remain
for any length of time. It is not sur'
prising, then, that although 600 men
worked to build the Royal Hayman
Hotel, the average number employed
at any one time was less than 50.
The steady flow of workmen to and
from the island resulted in a turnover
of labour every two months.
If they so desired, men could leave
the job for one week in four. A six'
day working week provided incentive
and food was of a high standard.
About this time, the Disposals Com'
mission offered for sale a Common'
wealth Chemical Warfare Research
station at Gunyarra, near Proserpine,
and the company purchased sections
of this camp, which comprised a large
number of timber and fibro'cement
buildings which were used on Hay'
man in the construction of huts and
a mess'hall for the workmen.
“Royal” Title Obtained.
With the Royal Tour of Australia
fixed for the near future, strenuous
efforts were made to have the major
portion of the work completed in time
for the visit of the King and Queen
to the Barrier Reef. It had been ar'
ranged with the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment that the Royal Party would
spend at least one night at Hayman
and permission was accordingly grant'
ed for the hotel to be named the
Royal Hayman Hotel.
Work was speeded up, but when the
Royal visit was cancelled it was de'
cided to proceed at a more leisurely
pace because of the great expense in-
volved in completing the job in such
a short period.
American Design Studied.
In August, 1948, Mr. Ansett visited
America to inspect tourist facilities,
and soon after his arrival he requested
that an architect be sent over to the
States to study modern development,
particularly in California, where the
climate approximates to that of Nor-
them Queensland.
An architect joined Mr. Ansett and
spent thsee months in America study'
ing the latest trends in hotel architec'
ture and decoration.
On his return, it was decided that
the architect should devote his full
time to the development and comple'
tion of the Hayman project, and from
December, 1948, until the hotel was
opened in July, 1950, he lived on the
island.
We are accustomed to think of
water, sewerage and electricity as limit'
less necessities which are always at
hand when needed, but as none was
available for the new hotel their pro'
vision involved many problems and
much expense.
Provision of Services.
The structure of the island is so
porous that careful investigation re'
vealed only one locality capable of
development as a natural dam, and as
unfortunately it was within fifty feet
of the highest point it was useless for
practical purposes. Ten large storage

tanks of corrugated non and with con-
crete bottoms 49 feet in diameter
and 11 feet high were built, giving
a storage capacity of 110 cubic gal-
lons, being filled by a pipeline from
a small weir in one of the mountain
valleys eighty feet above. The tanks,
constructed at Lysaght’s Newcastle
Works, cost £25,000.
Finally, as a safeguard against
drought, it was resolved to install a
£20,000 plant for the conversion of
salt sea water to fresh.
Water requirements would have
been considerably less had it been
possible to provide a salt water sewer-
age system, but, as disposal would have
been feasible only at the north end of
the island away from habitation, in-
coming currents and reefs, engineering
costs were considered prohibitive.
Therefore, the usual type of septic
tank was designed, together with a
filtration and treatment plant to per-
mit the re-use of all waste water for
lawns and flower gardens.
The electrical power house and re-
ticulation cost £17,000.
Simple Design for Building.
Construction of buildings, generally,
was basically simple and consisted of
concrete foundations and floor slabs,
timber framed and sheeted walls and
corrugated asbestos cement roofing,
but particular attention was paid to
insulation against heat and the ven-
tilation of spaces between ceilings and
roofs as a means of reducing the room
temperatures.
It was this principle of free air cir-
culation which, in fact, determined the
use of skillion-type roofs. These per-
mitted the construction of continuous
louvres along the high fronts facing
the prevailing breeze and, in the main
building, induced exhaustion of air
from interiors through gaps formed by
ceilings being framed at several dif-
ferent levels.
Because of the severe shortage of
steel, the foundations of all the lodges
and other small units were designed
monolithically and avoided the use of
reinforcement. Sand was obtained on
the actual site, but all loose coral for
aggregate had to be brought by barge
from the north end of the island.
Such stone aggregate as was required
for standard reinforced concrete was
obtained by crushing loose stone on
the island.
Because of the big tidal fall and the
necessity to eliminate inconveniece to
arriving and departing guests it was
found that a 1,500-feet jetty woul l
have to be built from the shore extend-
ing over the coral reef to deep water.
In view of the development of the
island as a tourist resort the Proser-
pine Council agreed to provide the
jetty and the construction company
agreed to build it, which took six
months and cost £lB,OOO.
Furnishing of the hotel cost £35,000.
Thirty Lodges.
The Hayman project all told com-
prises thirty lodges, the main hotel
building and swimming pool, staff
quarters and recreation buildings,
power house and other utility build-
water storage and underground
tanks, septic and sewage treatment
tanks, salt water conversion plant,
radio-telephone link station and mast,
pier, railroad and train, tennis and
games court, paths, terraces and gar-
dens.
Each of the lodges consists of two
self-contained suites, each with its own
private bathroom and loggia facing the
sea. The suites are spacious and airy,
with twin divan beds, and there are
built-in dressing-tables and wardrobes.
The floors of the lodges are of pale
grey polished stone. The furnishing
fabrics are individual to each suite
and depict tropical under-sea motifs
in varying colours.
The lodges are set on either side
of the main building in park-like gar-
dens, and are symmetrically placed
along paths linking them with the
main block.
The central building, which contains
the lounge, dining-room, casino, bar
and cocktail bar, is fronted by glass
ceiling-to-floor doors, affording mag-
nificent views of adjacent islands and
the Whitsunday Passage. Between it
and the beach is a paved terrace flank-
ed with lawns and fringed with flowers
and trees.
The merging of the inside with the
outside has been emphasised by the
introduction of plantations of tropical
plants within the hotel.
A Monument to Private
Enterprise.
That Mr. Ansett succeeded in realis-
ing his dream was fittingly confirmed
by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt.
Hon. A. W. Fadden, M.P., in open-
ing the hotel early in July, 1950, when
he said:
“It is a monument to private enter-
prise that will give the Australian
tourist trade a much-needed boost.
Not only will it become a dollar-earner,
but it will also foster international
friendship and understanding.
“The undertaking is a national ven-
ture which has been carried out by
private enterprise in a true national
spirit.”
FAMOUS BRITISH BUILDING
FIRM.
Book Records Century of Progress.
The world-famous firm of British
Builders, John Laing 6? Son Ltd., has
just produced a book for private cir-
culation amongst its many friends, en-
titled “Team Work,” which tells the
story of over a hundred years of
achievement of this family business.
The Laing story is indeed one of
the steady and yet enormous growth
of a small family business that has
all along been governed by undeviat'
ingly high principles; those who know
something of the thoughtful and con'
siderate way in which the Laing es'
tales of the great era of speculative

herence to standards of good work-

“Team Work” is a beautiful book,
from the colour reproduction of Mr.

the Governing Director, to the com-
pletion up to date of the narrative on
page 108, which records the coinci-
dence that has brought one of the
company’s most recent contracts —for
the Wind-scale plutonoium works—
almost within sight of the house at
Sebergham once occupied by James
Laing and where the firm began in
1848. Between the portrait and the
record of this contract is a wealth of
copiously illustrated letterpress telling
of work interesting alike to the build-
er, the industrialist, the architect and
the student of men and affairs.

MODERN CHURCH INTERIOR.
This is not a set from a super modern film
but actually the interior of a new Catholic
Church in the contemporary style in Zurich,
Switzerland. The altar is rectangular and
heavily carved, the crucifix being suspended
overhead. The pulpit looks like a lecturer’s
rostrum and the seats very hard, angular and
uncomfortable.

Rose Bay Flats
Are Different
UNUSUAL CONSTRUCTION
ATTRACTS WIDE ATTENTION.
A block of six flats at present un-
der construction in New South Head
Road, Rose Bay, are the first of their
type to be erected in Australia.
The architects for the building are
D. Forsyth Evans and Associates;
structural work was designed by Mr.
P. O. Miller. Consulting Engineer,
and the builder is Mr. A. Punch.
The building when completed will
be of three floors, with two spacious
flats to each floor. Access to the
first floor will be by outside stairs,
and internal stairs will rise to the re'
maining two floors.
The flats will each contain two
bedrooms, and the front flats will be
squares.
They are being built on the co'
operative purchase principle.
The main floor is supported on a
aeries of five heavily reinforced piers,
expanding in section as they rise,
along its centre, upon which rest the
“raking” cantilever beams, all true to
form and function and terribly strong.
In a chat with the Consulting En'
gineer, Mr. P. O. Miller, “Con'
struction” learned that the building
will incorporate many novel features
new to Australia.
For instance, the square opening
visible in the top photos, the end of a
box'type girder in which all pipes,
sewerage stacks, electric conduits, etc.,
will be placed, to emerge at the far
end.
Thus no outside piping will be
visible to disfigure the walls.
Following installation, the opening
will be sealed.
Mr. Miller said the open area un'
der the first floor will be used for
garaging cars and will not be enclos'
ed when the building is completed.
DELAYED ACTION LIGHT
SWITCH.
Have you ever stubbed your big
toe getting into bed after the light
has been turned off? A new US.
invention claims to solve the problem.
It’s a delayed action switch which
makes it possible to turn off the light
and jump into bed one minute before
the light goes out.

Over One Million
Buy Homes
More than 1,000,000 Australians
own, or are in the process of buying
their own homes.
Of the other 1,000,000 tenanted
houses, most are owned by Govern'
ment housing authorities or people
with modest incomes, according to
the Institute of Public Affairs.
flf this means that 2,000,000
people are in their own or tenanted
homes, out of a population of 8,480,-
446 in Australia, this must be regard-
ed as a very creditable performance
and would not indicate much of a
housing shortage.]
The points were made in a survey
conducted to rebut Communist sug-
gestions that property ownership in
Australia is largely concentrated in
the hands of a few rich capitalists.
The survey also disclosed that
ninety per cent, of all property is
vested in people with a total income
of less than <£sooo a year.
Of 2,831,000 taxpayers in 1948-49,
only 8300 had incomes, before taxa-
tion, of more than £5OOO.
More than 40 per cent, of private
wealth is in farms, shops, small fac-
tories and businesses, owned by more
than 600,000 people working on their
own account.
fAccording to a table released last
month by the Commissioner of Taxa-
tion, after taxation the distribution
of the various income groups were:
Credit For War
Service Homes
In setting out the facts regards"
the assistance his Government has
given and is giving to ex-servicemen
under the War Service Homes Act,
the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, has
proved that this Government has not
been parsimonious in any degree.
In fact, figures prove that no pre-
vious Government ever did as much
to help ex-servicemen to buy homes
as the present Federal Government
has done since it took office. In less
than three years it has financed the
purchase of 35,000 war homes. This
is more than a third of the entire
total of 85,000 homes provided since
the Commonwealth Government auth-
orised this aid to ex-servicemen 32
vears ago.
The Federal Budget for the current
financial year allocated £27 million for
war service homes—£2 million more
than in the previous year and nearly
£ll million more than in 1949-50.
Because applications for loans have al-
ready exhausted this record allocation
the Government has had to announce
that no more money will be available
this financial year to help ex-service-
men to buy houses already built. The
building of war service homes is still
going on.
Actually, the Government is only
asking new applicants for home-buy-
ing assistance to wait until their ap-
plications can be met from next year’s
allocation for funds for War Service
Homes.
That is a reasonable request for
the Government to make, especially
when it has done more to satisfy the
housing needs of ex-servicemen than
any previous Government, and earn-
estly wants to go on doing more.

Estimated to cost between £500,000
and £750,000, the work comprises the
erection of a building varying in sec-
tions from one to two storeys, having
a welded structural steel frame with
reinforced concrete foundations. Ar-
chitect for the scheme, upon which
work has commenced, is Sir Percy E.
Thomas, F.R.1.8.A.. Cardiff.
Large Factory for New Town.
Preliminary work has just com-
menced on a factory at Hemel Hemp-
stead new town, for Rotax Ltd. The
contractors are I. Tarvis and Sons Ltd.,
and the tender figure in the region
of £725,000.
The whole of the superstructure
of the building will be constructed in
welded tubular steel. The main works
services will be housed in a detached
building running the length of the
main shop, and the heating by high
pressure hot water installations. The
main production shoo will be mechan-

Restrictions Lifted from Fibrosis Plaster
ANNOUNCEMENT BY MINISTER AT INDUSTRY DINNER.
Speaking at the Annual Dinner of
the Fibrous Plaster Industry held at
Amory, Ashfield, on February 28,
the Minister for Secondary In'
dustries and Building Materials,
The Hon. W. E. Dickson, M.L.C.,
said, amidst applause from the
gathering, that as the result of a sur'
vey just completed he had decided to
completely lift restrictions as far as
Fibrous Plaster are concerned. [This
will mean that in future fibrous plaster
can be used for any class of building.
—Ed.] He had received an assurance
from the President of the Association
that this decision would not in any
way interfere with home building.
This decision, said Mr. Dickson,
was implementing his belief that re'
strictions should only be applied when
materials were in short supply. All
basic materials were continually under
review by his Department and as pro'
duction reached demand de'control
was possible.
His Department was concerned
with the affect of the credit restric'
tions on home building and he hoped
that in respect of this vital aspect of
the building industry they would be
lifted at the first opportunity.
This annual gathering of the mem'
bers of the Fibrous Plaster Associa'
tion of N.S.W. is one of the most
enjoyable in the building industry
year and the excellent relationship be'
tween its members and its efficient or'
ganisation is apparent.
It is always well attended not only
by the leaders of kindred organisations
in the industry but also by Minister
and Members of Parliament.
Übiquitous Stewart Fraser, Execu'
tive Director of the Building Industry
Congress of N.S.W., was Master of
Ceremonies, while the toast of Parlia'
ment was also in his capable hands.
In his remarks he said that usually in
this toast the virtues of our Parlia'
mentary system were extolled, but on
this occasion he wished to stress the
importance of the personalities that
played their vital part within its frame'
work, for he was convinced that per'
sonalities are the most important fact'
ors in every phase of community life.
“This Fibrous Plaster Association is
a virile proof of contention,” he said,
“the personalities of leaders have rah
lied the men of this vital industry to
the cause of better community ser'
vice through faithful workmanship
and honourable trading.”
The response to the Toast was made
by The Hon. W. E. Dickson, M.L.C.
(representing the Premier), and The
Hon. Vernon H. Treatt, M.M., Q.C.,
M.L.A., who was in most humorous
vein and delighted the gathering with
his witty references to a certain Royal
Commission at present in session.
The Toast of the Building Industry
was proposed by Mr. Cobden Parkes,
Government Architect of N.S.W., who
paid tribute to the remarkable expan'
sion and present importance of the
fibrous plaster industry in the build'
ing field, the response being in the
hands of Mr. C. E. Thompson, Pres'
ident of the Master Builders’" Associa'
tion of N.S.W.
The Fibrous Plaster Industry was
toasted by Mr. Davis Hughes, M.L.A.,
representing the Hon. Leader of the
Country Party, who said that Austra'
lia led the world in this industry
which was important from the view'
point of the economy of the country
in that it was one of the few that was
State wide and not concentrated in
the cities.
The Past President of the Associa'
tion, Mr. A. C. Mitchinson, univers'
ally known as “Mitch,” said in reply
that he was very proud of “this fam'
ily of ours”i Like other families there
had been problems of development
and adolescence but like all families
there was always solidarity and sin'
cerity in the face of adversity and dif'
ficulties.
The newly'dected President of the
Association, Mr. D. J. Odell, in pro'
posing the toast of Our Guests, paid
tribute to the co'operation that his
Association had always received from
the building industry.
Mr. E. W. Andrew, Vice'President,
R. N.S.W. Chapter, respond'
ed.
It was appropriate that the ban'
queting hall at Amory has just been
remodelled and incorporates a lavish
domed ceiling—all in fibrous plaster—
which magnificently demonstrates the
great scope and artistic propensities of
the versatile material.
NEW OFFICE-BEARERS.
The Annual General Meeting of
the Fibrous Plaster Association of
New South Wales was held on the
28th February, 1952, and was at'
tended by forty'eight members, most'
ly from country districts.
Mr. A. C. Mitchinson, who had
been President since the formation of
the Association in 1946, did not seek
re'election as President and the mem'
bers extended to him their sincere
thanks and appreciation for the work
he had done, the time spent by him
in its interests and the present flour'
ishing state of the Association.
The following officers were elected
for the ensuing year;
President: Mr. D. J. Odell (Kemp'
sey).
Vice'President: Mr. G. B. New
(Sydney).
Committee: Messrs. D. W. Arthur
(Ballma), M. Devine (Canberra), A.
C. Mitchinson (Sydney), I. M. Molloy
(Sydney), G. W. Pratt (Sydney), F.
S. Scorer (Newcastle), C. G. Terry
(Wagga), C. S. West (Sydney).
Many important items were on the
agenda, the most urgent being the
Credit restrictions by the Common'
wealth Government, which were hav'
ing a very severe restrictive effect on
building. Members expressed grave
concern and resolved that every pos'
sible action should be taken to se'
cure relief.
Other items discussed were plaster,
clouts, sisal, and the proposal to pre'
pare a film of the industry.

scribed at the base of the plaque are the
words: “A. C. Mitchinson, Foundation
President, 1945-47, Fibrous Plaster Manufac-
turers of Australia.” At the recent annual
meeting of the Association he—who had been
President since its formation in 1946—did
not seek re-election. Members extended to
him their sincere thanks and appreciation for
the work he had done in the interests of the
Association which was largely responsible
for its present flourishing state.

ILLAWARRA M.B.A. HOLDS
FIFTH ANNUAL DINNER
MASTER BUILDERS ATTEND FROM FAR AND NEAR
FUNCTION IS OUTSTANDING SUCCESS.
The fifth annual dinner of the IF
lawarra Master Builders’ Association
was held in the Soldiers’ Memorial
Hall, Wollongong, on March 7.
Representatives of many Master
Builders’ Associations travelled con'
siderable distances to be present, and
the dinner, to which over 200 sat
down, was an outstanding success.
Credit is due to the Executive of
the Illawarra M.B.A. for the excellent
arrangements made to cater for such
a large attendance. No detail was
overlooked in the preparations for
the function and the hour or so of
happy after'dinner entertainment.
All present voted it a memorable
night, and the Illawarra members as
being “good fellows.”
The Executive of the Illawarra
M.B.A. are: President, M. 1. Sain'
bury; Vice-Presidents, G. W. Phillips
and R. Baxter; Secretary, F. J. Corn-
ally; Treasurer, R. J. Rosten; Com-
mittee: W. J. Longhurst, W. Caldwell,
W. Jackson. J. Keith, G. Beswick, K.
Strachan, L. Duff, R. L. Morris, D.
Dugan, and R. Johns.
During the evening Mr. G. W.
Phillips proved himself a capable
Master of Ceremonies, and he used
his small circular saw as a gong with-
out fear or favour.
Mr. Phillips imposed a 3-minute
limit on speech-making. When that
time had expired he applied the
“gag” per medium of the gong, to the
great amusement of all present.
Following Grace, recited by Mr. H.
H. Parsons, and the Royal Toast to
Her Majesty the Queen, a 2-minute
silence was observed in reverent mem-
ory of the late King George VI.
The Master of Ceremonies then ex-
tended a hearty welcome to all visit'
ors on behalf of the Illawarra M.B.A.
He hoped they would enjoy them-
selves —as they were expected to —
and that they would make many new
friends before the night was out (ap-
plause).
Toasts and Speeches.
In proposing the toast of “The IF
lawarra M.B.A.’ Mr. Rex Connor,
M.L.A., spoke of the very great
honour which had been conferred
upon him in that regard.
Mr. Connor said he had the pleas'
ure of dealing with the Executive of
the Association on many occasions
during the last 12 months, and he
admired them greatly for the way in
which they had carried on the tradi-
tions of master builders.
He asked for the indulgence of
those present to refer to a matter
which was paramount in the minds
of all in the building industry. He
referred to the curtailment by the
Federal Government of moneys for
housing construction.
The State of N.S.W. will spend
every available pound in housing as
the first priority, and “will go to the
limit in that respect,” Mr. Davies said.
“A man who builds a house makes
an outstanding contribution to so'
ciety,” he added.
Referring to the registration of
builders, Mr. Connor said this was
not an easy matter, but he promised
to the best of his ability to push hard
such registration,”
“There is a real need for it,” he
commented.
Mr. Connor said it seemed unfor'
tunate that the Federal Government
was importing prefabricated houses at
a time when the building industry
was easing off, with men normally
engaging in building work looking
for jobs.
The Federal Government should
consider handing out money to the
N.S.W. Housing Commission for
home building purposes, Mr. Connor
continued (applause).
“I feel deeply on the matter. There
is much to be done, and must be
done,” he added.
Replying to the toast, the Ilia'
warra M.B.A. President, Mr. M. J.
Sainsbury, remarked that he had hop'
ed to respond on behalf of the Reg'
istered Builders “but the powers that
be move slowly. We must get satis'
faction in this contentious matter, and
we must keep hammering at it,” he
said.
Mr. Sainsbury etxended a sincere
welcome to the visitors from “far and
near,” and he said it was nleasing to
see so many ‘old stalwarts from long
distances’.”
He concluded by thanking Mr.
Connor for his kind remarks.
Proposing the toast “M.B.A. of
N.S.W. and Building Industry Con'
gress,” Mr. W. J. Longhurst said the
8.1. C. was trying to do a big job for
builders and the building industry.
He warmly welcomed the M.B.A.
President, Mr. Charles Thompson,
and the M.B.A. Secretary, Mr. L. G,
Smith, and he was sorry that the
8.1. C. Executive Director, Stewart
Fraser, was not present “to deliver
one of his excellent speeches.”
Mr. Longhurst referred to the great
work being done by Mr. Fraser in
the interests of the building industry
in seeing that materials are used in
the best possible manner.
The M.B.A. was also rendering
great service to Master Builders and
allied industries, Mr. Longhurst
added.
Replying on behalf of the M.B.A.
of N.S.W. the President, Mr. C. E.
Thompson, said it was “indeed pleas-
ing to see the confidence shown in
this hall and this dinner by one of the
youngest and biggest of the Branch
Associations.”
It was not many years since the
Association was started, Mr. Thomp-
son continued, and it had grown
greatly in recent years.
“It is interesting at this stage to
give a little bit of history,” he said.
The M.B.A. of N.S.W. was form'
ed in 1873, and the first meeting
was called by a number of builders
at the Temperance Hall.
“It is still fitting that temperance
is one of our keynotes,” Mr. Thomp'
son commented, amid laughter.
The first meeting of the master
builders was for the purpose of pro'
tecting their interests; that is still our
purpose after all these years, Mr.
Thompson continued.
He said the old'time builders pass'
ed through a lot of strife and fighting,
and he recounted the great day-la-
hour fight against the Government of
the day, in 1897; a fight which was
destined to continue until the early
1900’s, when private enterprise won
a “fair go.”
The M.B.A. has fought battles
since the Arbitration Court came into
being in 1901, Mr. Thompson said.
“Industrial matters are our main
function, and today the parent As-
sociations, with nine suburban asso*
ciations and 11 country associations,,
is a very strong body.

BUILDING, LIGHTING AND ENGINEERING


“The M.B.A. of N.S.W. is all the
time attending to the wants of all
members of all Associations regard'
ing industrial matters,” Mr. Thomp'
son concluded.
The Secretary of the M.8.A., Mr.
L. G. Smith, in his capacity of Treas'
urer of the Building Industry Con'
gress, in speaking to the toast, said
that he had been present at every
annual dinner of the Illawarra M.B.A.
since its inception.
; He hoped to be present at many
inore such functions in Wollongong,
and he felt happy “to be among so
many fine fellows.”
The task of responding to the
toast was a pleasing one, Mr. Smith
said.
Altogether, he continued, there is a
total membership of 1060 in the affik
iated associations.
“It was through the M.B.A. that
:he 8.1. C. was formed, and its func'
ions have now expanded much more
largely than was envisaged at its in'
:ered by its Executive Director, Mr.
reption. Its work is now adminis'
D. Stewart Fraser, and its influence
las become widespread and powerful.
“It has a membership of 3 3 affik
ated associations,” Mr. Smith said.
The Council meets regularly and
fleets representatives in a democratic
nanner and Congress is mainly inter'
jsted in basic building materials, and
t also suggests many measures which
rave a very beneficial influence on
ndustry.
“While Congress continues to ini'
ilement a policy for builders it will
eceive the support of the M.8.A.”
Mr. Smith concluded by saying that
Vlr. R. Connor, M.L.A., had prom'
sed to introduce a deputation to the
Minister urging registration of build'
:rs (applause).
| In the toast of “Parlia'
nent”, Mr. R. J. Rosten spoke of
he pleasure he felt in being selected
o propose the health of Parliament.
He welcomed Mr. R. Connor,
vI.L.A., arid Mr. W. Davies, M.H.R.,
)oth of whom, he said, are rendering
listinguished service to the district.
Mr. Rosten asked Mr. Davies to
;ee what he could do to obtain some
illeviation of credit controls. It was
dtal that the building industry got
lome relief.
He was sure that Mr. Davies had
he matter well under consideration,
md he appealed to him to do all he
lossibly could to have the credit re'
itrictions alleviated.
In paying a tribute to Mr. Davies,
Mr. Rosten said he has done a great
ob and had always proved willing
md helpful to the building industry.
Mr. Davies, M.H.R., replying, con-
gratulated the Illawarra M.B.A. on
the success of the function.
He emphasised that the social side
of the Association’s activities was a
very important one, and in this the
Illawarra M.B.A. was doing a very
good job.
Mr. Davies reminded those present
that he was engaged in the building
industry when he first came to Aus'
tralia.
“I started on the concrete board,”
he said.
“Later I was promoted to brick'
layers’ labourer,” he added, amid
laughter.
“If Parliament has been a bit rough
on you with credit restrictions, there
still remains the question of Mek
bourne firms getting preference over
N.S.W. builders,” Mr. Davies re'
marked.
“N.S.W. builders have been left
out, and Ministers have admitted it,”
he continued.
“Prefab, homes have been put up
in Berkeley which were meant for
railway people in Victoria.
“Houses have been put up like
Meccano sets, and we don’t want
them here,” Mr. Davies said.
“They are a disgrace and a blot
on the landscape of the South Coast.
“One of the unfortunate things is
that Local Governments have not the
power to stop such places going up.
“That’s wrong. Local Govern'
ment bodies should have the final
say, and the Federal'and State Gov'
ernments should not have that power
to override them.”
Referring to credit restrictions, Mr.
Davies said:
“It may not have got you yet, but
it will get you. There is not a scrap
of doubt about that.
“The last thing they should try to
save money on is housing. Good
houses made contented people. You
can only stop Communism by hav'
ing contented people in decent
homes,” he added.
Mr. Davies said he trusted that the
builders’ organisations would develop
and grow stronger, and stick together
while credit is restricted.
He regarded registration of build'
ers as absolutely essential. He point'
ed out that plumbers and electricians
are registered, therefore skilled build'
ers should be.
Mr. Davies concluded with the
hope that the Illawarra M.B.A. “will
grofo and develop until it becomes
one of the strongest organisations on
the South Coast.”
The toast of “City of Greater Wok
longong” was proposed by Mr. R.
Baxter, who paid a tribute to the wise
administration of the City Council
and the happy relationship existing
between Councillors, Council officers,
and South Coast Master Builders.
“With Alderman Ward as a friend
we have little to worry about,” Mr.
Baxter said.
He referred to the rapid growth
of the city, and said that builders
were very proud to maintain the
growth of the district, despite difficuk
ties with gas and water services.
Mr. Baxter concluded on a note of
optimism for the future.
Replying, Alderman T. Ward said
that the City Council liked receiving
praise, instead of complaints over ser'
vices.
Enormous expansion had taken
place in the district, with the popula'
tion increasing from 65,000 to 80,000
in a few years.
“In 20 to 30 years it will be at
least 250,000,” Aid. Ward said.
“The Illawarra M.B.A. was play'
ing a most important part in housin';
the people.
“A satisfied home owner is the best
advertisement to build community and
national life.
Enormous work has already been
done in building homes in the dis'
trict; first by building societies, and
latterly by the Housing Commission,
he added.
Aid. Ward said the Council deep'
ly appreciated the help of local build'
ers in developing the district, and he
thanked the Association on behalf of
the Mayor and other Councillors.
ASBESTOS CEMENT IN RHODESIA.
Extensive Manufacture and Use.
Asbestos cement is being extensively used for
many purposes in Rhodesia and one of the
most progressive manufacturers is Porters
Cement Industries, which has a large pro-

Presentation of Shield.
At a suitable interval during the
dinner, a shield was presented to the
Illawarra M.B.A. by the associated in-
dustries of the district, for competition
with the St. George-Sutherland M.B.
A., and any other Association who
may challenge for it, in games of
cricket, tennis, and golf.
In accepting the generous gift, Mr.
G. W. Phillips said “it will go on the
wall of our new Builders’ Exchange
when it is built.
“We have been granted the permit
to build,” he added, amid rounds of
applause.
Songs, Music, Comedy.
During the dinner and following
its conclusion, those present were en-
tertained with a varied programme
of songs, musical items, ventriloquism,
and comedy numbers.
Presentation of Certificate.
At a happy ceremony during the
fifth annual dinner of Illawarra Mast'
er Builders’ Association, the President,
Mr. M. J. Sainsbury, presented Certi-
ficates to Mr. W. L. Vidler and Mr.
W. I. Longhurst, in acknowledgment
of their services as Past Presidents.
Mr. Vidler was Association Fresh
dent in 1948-49, and Mr. Longhurst
was President in 1949-50.
Mr. Sainsburv said the Illuminated
Addresses which he took profound
pleasure in presenting to the two Past
Presidents, symbolised the splendid
work performed and services render-
ed by Mr. Vidler and Mr. Longhurst.
In accepting his Address, Mr. Vid
ler assured the Association of his cor
tinued interest and support. Nothin
he could do, he said, would be counl
ed too much trouble or effort.
Mr. Longhurst also expressed hi
gratitude and appreciation of the gei
ture made by the Association in pr(
senting him with the Address, and h
added that he would always be ver
proud of the tangible token of esteei
he had just received.

PLANS FOR NEW MAIL
BRANCH BUILDING.
“No Change,” Says Menzies.
Sydney City Council has been ir
formed by Prime Minister Menzic
that the Government will procee
with plans to erect a new mail branc
at Redfern, although it involves den
olition of 99 tenements.
Mr. Menzies said that building of
erations could not commence for thre
years or more, and that .demolitio
would not start until occupants c
tenements had had reasonable time t
find other accommodation.
(Demolition of the 99 tenement
will dispossess 250 families involvin
between 500 and 600 people.)
The site —on land bounded by Pit
Cleveland and Castlereagh Sts., nea
Central Railway—was the only on
which would meet postal departmer
requirements, Mr. Menzies said in
letter to Lord Mayor O’Dea.
The N.S.W. Housing Commissioj
propose to erect houses and flats O!

Wunderlich’s Latest Product
VERSATILE CERAMIC WALL TILE.
The latest Wunderlich product—
the 10” x 10” glased ceramic wall
tile—is a most useful facing unit of
a sise in harmony with modern de-
sign trends. It is easy to apply to
both exterior and interior wall sur-
faces and partitions of brick, con-
crete or stone, as well as to walls and
floors of swimming pols. It is sur-
prisingly economical in initial cost
and requires virtually no maintenance.
Ceramic Wall Tile is particularly
adaptable for use where flat unbroken
surfaces predominate and is conse-
quently most suitable for commercial,
industrial and public buildings—shops,
hotels, theatres, factories, store rooms,
food processing plants, workrooms,
canteens, shower and toilet rooms,
schools, power stations, hospitals, etc.
Standard tiles are 10” x 10” x 1”
thick glased on one face and single
bullnose and internal and external
mitre tiles are available, though tiles
can be cut on the job for special
purposes by a portable Black &
Decker power saw with a carborun
dum grit cutting wheel.
The tiles are affixed to the wall in
the ordinary way with cement mortar
of 3:1 to 4:1, the tiles being first
soaked in water; i” thick joints are
recommended. It is already being
used for swimming pools at Wagga,
N.S.W., and Mt. Isa. Queensland.

OUR COVER
THE SWANSEA GUILDHALL.
In the fruitful years between the Depression and the last war great progress was made in
Britain in the erection of a fine series of municipal buildings, which were well planned) and
had a civic dignity. The Guildhall at Swansea in Wales is an excellent example. That it
possesses a fine setting is apparent from the photograph.

WUNDERLICH CERAMIC WALL TILE.
The new Wunderlich ceramic 10” x 10” x 1” wall tile has been used on these new premises of
Penneys at Ryde, Sydney. This new unit is particularly suitable for the facing of buildings
of this type and its size has a scale that is lacking in smaller units. The builder is Mr. W.
Graf.
(Top) St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Melbourne.
Standing on Eastern Hill, this noble pile was
designed in 1858 by William Wilkinson
Wardell. Total area of the Cathedral is
35,000 square feet. More than 15,000 stones
—some weighing as much as a ton and a
quarter, were used in the spire; 2700 went
into the construction of the main spire and
2760 to the twin spires. (Bottom) Banking
premises, reflecting the best in contemporary
design, erected for the Union Bank (now the
Australian and N.Z. Bank) in Collins Street,

GOOD AND BAD PLANNING.
A good plan, in which each and every part of a house is in its right place in relation to each other will be the
cause of great and lasting satisfaction to its occupiers just as one which is faulty will be a constant source of
annoyance and irritation. The top right example is a good plan for a small house, a small vestibule provides
that desirable approach while three bedrooms are incorporated with a minimum of waste communication space.
A separate toilet out of the bathroom would be an advantage. The kitchen in the bottom left design is rather
squeezed in and the small corner window seems hardly adequate for this room where ventilation and light are
so important.
March 24, 1952.


COMPACT PLANNING.
An examination of these four plans will show compact layout and good arrangement, giving a maximum of space
and convenience with a minimum of area devoted to inter-communication between the various rooms. The plans
to the upper two schemes are practically identical in reverse and the manner in which the three bedrooms, for
parents and child of each sex, is excellent. Bottom right is a slightly smaller layout, embracing only the bed-
rooms and having kitchen at the side of the Living Room rather than at the rear and thus presupposing a wider
block of land. Bottom left looks like a two-storey plan though this is brought about by the garage and laundry
being incorporated in the basement of a sloping site.

Town and Country Planning
HOW IT AFFECTS US ALL.
By ADRIAN ASHTON, F.R.I.B.A.
We all, consciously or unconscious-
ly, every day and in every way, suffer
from the results of bad planning. Be
it the long and tiring journey to and
from work; the time-wasting and
nerve-wracking traffic congestion; the
infuriating parking problems; con-
gested working and living conditions;
noise, grime, slums and all those fact-
ors that today are engulfing people,
stultifying their lives, impairing their
health and generally taking the sweet-
ness and joyousness out of living and
leaving that state of frustrated neurosis
that appears to be the characteristic of
the dweller in the modern city.
It is not unnatural, therefore, Man
being an enquiring animal—and also
a hopeful one—that those who have
the time, the will and the ability,
should try to find out just where we
took the wrong turning that has led
us into this impasse; whether it was
the expulsion from the Garden of
Eden, the greed and stupidity of the
Industrial Revolution, the invention
of the aeroplane and radio, or the in-
fluence of Marie Stopes or Josef
Stalin.
Town Planning, as such, is no new
flowering of human intelligence or com-
monsense, for there have been men
from earliest times who have seen the
need and applied their skill to the
problems of the day in Greece and
Rome and before and again in Ren-
aissance and more recent times, while
the history of Planning is studded
with great names like Haussmann, of
Paris; L’Enfant, of Washington;
Wren, of London, and our own Col.
Light, of Adelaide.
These men, however, were more
concerned with the outward and vis-
ible signs of planning: the grande
place, the magnificent avenue, the
beautiful vista: regal or rich man’s
planning, if you like, and it remain-
ed for simple, humane folk like Eb-
enezer Howard and Dame Henrietta
Barnett, and their more recent suc-
cessors, who saw the importance
of planning in the lives of the com-
mon people, to infuse the human
and sociological aspects that today are
the real raison d'etre of Town and
Country Planning in a democratic
community.
Planning Is Needed.
Yes, I think that any person who
cares to stop and think for a mo-
merit and even just use his eyes and
look around will admit that there is a
good case for planning in our mud'
died Society and its chaotic environ'
ment.
While, perhaps, fundamentally
simple. Planning is intrinsically ex'
tremely complex; in fact, as multifar'
ious as life itself and consequently if
the best results are to be obtained
by a community for the short term
sacrifices that it will be called upon
to pay for the long-range benefits,
it is essential that the planners have
skill, experience, vision and humanity
and also that the general public have
some reasonable idea of just what is
the goal.
The many facets of modern town
planning have brought forth a spate
of books by many authorities on its
architectural, engineering, socialogical
and—one might almost say phil-
osophical— aspects, many so know-
ledgable that their authors—Lewis
Mumford, Sir Patrick Abercrombie,
Sir Raymond Unwin, Le Corbusier,
and even Frank Lloyd Wright will
forever be associated with its devel-
opment.
Modern town planning may be said
to have been born in England in 1906
with the foundation of Hampstead
Garden Suburb which introduced
many revolutionary ideas and was in
turn followed by Letchworth and Web
wyn in 1920, both of which were sue-
cessful and proved that the theory of
endeavouring to introduce better ways
of living and working was really
practicable.
Further progress came after the
war with the Town and Country
Planning Act of 1947 which virtu-
ally controlled the land use of the
whole of England and in the found-
ing and development of the seven
new satellite towns around the peri-
phery of London, designed to stop its
continuous and engulfing sprawl, and
which today, as Sir Thomas Bennett,
who is chairman of two of them, Stev-
enage and Crawley, told us are so suc-
cessful that industrialists are vieing
with each other to secure sites so that
they can plan and build better factor-
ies and houses under conditions that
tend to eliminate the problems of the
city and retain the advantages of the
country.
In the between wars period little
progress was made in Australia and
Western Australia was the only State
with worthwhile planning legislation.
But more recently progress has un-
doubtedly been made and more has
been achieved in the last five post-
war years than in the quarter century
that had passed since Sir John Sul-
man, that great Australian pioneer of
planning, published his book in
1920.
The visit in 1948 of Sir Patrick
Abercrombie, whose name throughout
the world is almost synonymous with
town planning, was a great stimulus
and his dynamic personality did much
in both official and public spheres to
stimulate the real progress that has de-
veloped into the Cumberland, North-
umberland and Illawarra plans, cul-
minating in June last year when the
Cumberland County Plan became law
and as such will gradually impinge,
adjust and mould our life and envir-
onment.
Inauguration of the Department of
Town and Country Planning at the
University of Sydney under Professor
Denis Winston was another positive
step forward.
To many. Planning is most com-
mendable until an aspect of it hap-
pens to affect their particular plans
or asperations and then it is “an un-
warranted interference with his dem-
ocratic rights.” Here again success
lies in the middle course. In innum-
erable ways those of us who live in
Christian British democratic commun-
ities accept personal restraint for the
common good, provided we are con-
vinced that we are getting, in Austra-
lian parlance, “a fair go.”
Planning Must Be Flexible.
It is unfortunate in a way that
Town Planning legislation, which of
necessity must be the antithesis of
“Rafferty Rules,” should come on the
top of five years of bureaucratic war-
A SWEDISH HOUSE.
This house could easily be one of the many
fine larger residences built in the wooded
upper suburbs on the North Shore line of
Sydney. Actually it is in Oslo. Style is
very similar and the birch trees look rather
like a type of gum tree.

BUILDING, LIGHTING AND ENGINEERING


time controls and regulations that
everyone had “had” for it is, in some
quarters, naturally regarded with sus-
picion as just more controls for con-
trol sake. That this is a very real
danger has been apparent in Britain
where some of the elaborate Town
Planning legislation in the 1947 Act
proved to be much too restrictive
with the result that it tended to stul-
tify and impede legitimate private and
national progress and development
rather than, as intended, to guide and
channel it into a desired pattern.
But Professor F. A. Holford, of Lon-
don University, told us at the recent
Conference at Canberra that this was
now being realised and much more
flexibility and discretion was being
applied by those charged with its ad-
ministration.
The same spirit must apply here
for it has been clearly shown that
even a decade can materially alter
certain factors and if a cast iron plan
is adopted and rigidly enforced the
remedy of our ills can easily become
“worse than the disease. Broad out-
lines must be determined and adhered
to but detail must be flexible.
Sir Thomas Bennett, speaking at
the Architectural Convention in Mel-
bourne last November on the sub-
ject of New Towns, also emphasised
this very point. People won’t do
things if they are convinced they are
unreasonable or futile and passive re-
sistance can be a very powerful force.
“We are,” he said, “technical people
and are dealing with ordinary human
beings and we must not become pure-
ly technicians.”
At the other end of the scale, how-
ever, those responsible for planning
administration must strenuously resist
pressure groups and selfish interests
whi) are only imbued with their own
specific desires and are not remotely
concerned with the final public bene-
fit. It is vital also that Government
should set a high example and not,
as in some other allied fields, make
regulations for others that they freely
break themselves.
Yes, basically we all must be for
planning, for we all want to live and
enjoy our lives in a happy, healthy
and convenient environment; we
want our children to arrive safely at
school without risking their lives
crossing motor speedways or falling
from over-crowded transport; we
want our wives to be able to shop
conveniently where they are safe from
traffic and congestion. We want to
go about to and from our work with-
out undue stress upon our blood-pres-
sure and ulcers; we want to have a
home in a reasonable environment,
and we want to preserve our national
heritage from spoliation, ignorance
and vandalism, so that at the end of a
week of labour we can refresh our
own flagging spirits by breathing
God’s pure air and gazing upon the
beauty of our “Australia Fair.” Plan-
ning alone can’t hope to achieve all
this, for that can only spring from
Man’s own life, outlook and example,
but it can show the way and its bene-
fits are cumulative.
BOOK REVIEW.
Town and Country Planning.
By A. J. Brown and H. M. Sher-
rard. 408 pp. 110 figures. 124
illustrations. Melbourne Univers-
ity Press. £3/3/-.
“Any country of the size and im-
portance of Australia should have its
treatise on modern practice of Town
and Country Planning”, says Sir Pat-
rick Abercrombie in the Foreword of
this new publication.
“It is quite true that this subject
in its technical as well as in its social
aspects, has an international charac-
ter .. . but it is equally true that
place and folk, the variation of topo-
graphy and climate and the idiosyn-
crasies of human groups must offset
every scientific calculation, every
way, practical and artistic, of doing
things.”
It is surely a sign of maturity for
Australia to be preparing its own
authoritative works on technical and
scientific subjects, instead of, as hith-
erto, having to rely upon those from
Britain and America which do not al-
ways entirely fit into local practice. It
is also good for local perspective to see
Canberra and Welwyn compared;
Collins Street, Melbourne rubbing
shoulders with Parisian boulevardes;
Manly’s bold surf pavilion with Stock-
holm’s simple music shells; Union
Square, San Francisco with Wynyard
Square, Sydney; Pacific Highway,
North Sydney, with the Parkway in
Westchester County, New York. Many
comparisons show that we still have
much to learn, others on the other
hand, indicate that in our own way
we are solving some problems or mak-
ing our contribution.
The balanced judgment arising
from the colaboration in the author-
ship of the different training, values
and outlook of architect and engineer,
who are the two dominant professional
men involved in planning, has been
obviously advantageous.
Since 1945 planning legislation in
Australia has been considerably
strengthened and town and country
planning schemes are being put in
hand. This book attempts to meet
the need for a work to serve as a gen-
eral introduction to this many-sided
subject and is written mainly for three
classes of reader —the interested mem-
bers of the general public, administra-
tive officials whose work is concern-
ed with planning, and students in uni-
versities and technical colleges who
are being introduced to the subject.
The book is concerned almost exclu-
sively with the physical aspect of
planning, and the plans referred to are
mainly graphic plans, prepared for
the guidance of planning authorities
responsible for the control of future
development.
The authors give the following defi-
nition of their subject: Town and
Country Planning is the development
and use of land to serve the econ-
omic and social welfare of a com-
munity in respect of convenience,
health and amenity.
The illustration section is particu-
larly comprehensive and up-to-date
while the layout is simple and logi-
cal. Prelude to Planning; Compon-
ents to Planning; The Plans Emerge;
National and Regional Levels; Im-
plementation. With the Cumberland
County Plan now law in Sydney and
other schemes coming forward in
other parts of Australia, the book
comes forward at an appropriate time.
THE “LION AND THE UNICORN”
PAVILION
At the Festival of Britain.
The “Lion and Unicorn” Pavilion at the
Festival symbolizing British character and tra-
dition was much admired. Judges’ robes, law
books, mottoes, filigree decorations, and plas-
ter doves flying below the lamella construc-
tion timber ceiling, were all in perfect scale.
The sinuous lacy ceiling decoration in bright
steel imparted an interesting affect.

Roadways replace Rail
Tracks on Bridges
MODERNISING THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
New York’s first great bridge, the
Brooklyn Suspension Bridge, built by
the Roeblings nearly seventy years
ago, accommodated only two clear
lines of road traffic together with two
paved tramway lines and two electric
railway lines, the latter connecting
with the elevated street railway sys'
tern of those days. There is also a
central elevated footway.
There are four main cables, two
on the outside and two near the cem
tre, the latter passing over the central
shaft of the three'shaft masonry tow'
ers. The rail tracks were placed just
outside the inner cables with deep
stiffening trusses on ea»h side of the
railways. Outside these again are
the paved tramway tracks and then
the roadways with shallower stiffening
trusses close to the outer cables.
Modernising the bridge floor to
provide dual carriageways, each of
three-lane width, involved removal of
the outer deep stiffening trusses, to-
gether with all four rail tracks. Much
of the original floor girder system
was retained as it was still in good
condition.
The work of reconstruction was en-
trusted to Dr. D. B. Steinman, de'
signer of many suspension bridges,
and biographer of the Roeblings and
himself a lifedong admirer of the
Brooklyn Bridge.
To retain the original appearance
of the bridge the outer stiffening
trusses Bft. 6in. in height were brought
up to the 17ft. height of the inner
trusses. New latticed verticals were
added and then the top chord of the
demantled trusses placed over them.
A cross'bracing of eyebars between
verticals matched that of the old
trusses. Horizontal transverse bracing
members were also fitted over each
carriageway width between the re-ar'
ranged trusses.
The Philadelphia'Camden suspem
sion bridge over the Delaware River
is similar in deck layout to the Syd'
nev Harbour Bridge and was con'
structed about the same time. Two
electric tracks, however, for which
provision was made in the design,
were never completed, and their
place has recently been taken by two
additional traffic lanes, making eight
in all.
Associated with this change will be
a new approach plaza on the Camden
side, to cost two million dollars. On
this there will be 22 new toll booths
in place of the existing 12. These
will be planned on an arc. Twelve
of the 22 will be reversible so as to
collect tolls on either side.
As the bridge traffic is considered
to be nearing its maximum capacity,
surveys are being undertaken for an'
other bridge crossing.
More than twenty million dollars of
electrical generating equipment is be'
ing built by the General Electric Com'
pany, U.S.A., for use in the alumim
ium industry’s expansion programme.
The equipment, to include turbines
and generators able to produce
395,000 kilowatts of electric power,
has been ordered by the Reynolds
Metals Company and by the Kaiser
Aluminium & Chemical Corporation,
in line with defence plans to increase
the industry’s overall production by 2-j
billion pounds annually these two new
plants are designed for a combined
output of 550 million pounds of alu'
minium a year.
Both the Reynolds and Kaiser
plants are expected to be in operation
by the end of this year.

Sydney Hospital
May Stay
The McKell Labour Government’s
decision some years ago regarding the
removal of Sydney Hospital may be
rescinded by the State Government.
The decision provided for replan'
ning Macquarie Street and the com'
plete removal of Sydney Hospital to
the site of the old Kensington race
course.
The race course has now been ah
most completely reserved for the Uni'
versity of Technology and educational
purposes.
The Minister for Health, Mr.
O’Sullivan, will ask in Cabinet for a

tal is now practicable.
According to Sydney Hospital

BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND ITS FOUNDATIONS.
This famous bridge over the East River, in New York, was built before the days of reinforced
concrete construction. The foundation caissons, illustrated in the upper right hand corner were
constructed of heavy baulks of timber and were sunk through considerable depths of river
silt to the rock This timber foundation work is still in place as being completely
submerged and always water-charged, it cannot rot. Compressed air methods were used during
sinl?g. In the case of one foundation this air under pressure fad an accidental fire in the
timber which had to be put out by flooding. The floor of Brooklyn Bridge is now undergoing
reconstruction to take motor traffic only in place of road and rail traffic.

the minute suggested demolition ot
the hospital, which wanted additional
quarters. The Hospitals Commission
had stated that necessary changes
could not be provided until the min'
ute had been rescinded.
Because of building materials and
labour scarcity no satisfaction can be

PREFAB. COMPANY IN
LIQUIDATION.
Shareholders of Baltic Timber
Homes Pty. Ltd. last week placed the
company in liquidation.
They passed a resolution that the
company, because of its liabilities,
could not continue, and that it be
wound up.
A financial statement presented to
the meeting disclosed that the com'
pany’s assets were £26,553 and its
liabilities £46,990.
The financial statement also showed
an unsecured liability to the bank of
£12,436, unsecured liabilities to the
building trade of £21,563, and a part'
ly secured liability of £7,025 to Mr.
T. A. Sundell, who until recently was
a director of Baltic Timber Homes
Pty. Ltd.
He is also agent in Australia for
the Swedish company from which pre'
fabricated homes are imported.
Mr. G. C. Remington, solicitor,
representing Mr. Sundell, said that
Mr. Sundell intended to offer to the
liquidators, Mr. A. E. Campbell, Of'
ficial Receiver, that he take over the
liabilities under the contracts of home
buvers and complete the homes.
The chairman of directors of Baltic
Timber Homes, Mr. P. T. Goodman,
in a statement to creditors said that
building costs were higher than ex'
pected because the Swedish homes
were not entirely suitable for Austra'
lian conditions.
LARGE EARTH-BORING AUGER.
This power auger will bore holes for foundation piers 5 feet in diameter and up to 25 feet

stabilising outriggers for the truck, elevates the boom from the lowered travelling position,
revolves the auger within a 180 degree arc and moves radially 24in. for positioning purposes.
The machine is here seen in service boring about 500 holes, 5ft. dia. and 6ft. deep, at a
Ford motor plant at Kansas City. On the right the auger has been withdrawn and is dis-
charging its load by spinning in the reverse direction throwing the eanth clear of the hole.

INTERNAL WINDOW-BOXES.
Our illustrations show clearly a feature that
is very popular on the Continent of Europe
—internal window-boxes and even sometimes
little gardens. The glass concentrates the
sun into the little verdant corner and also
protects the plants from frost and the rigours
of winter. It is undoubtedly an attractive
feature for a home.
NEW FRENCH FOOD FACTORY.
This new margarine factory at Nantcrre, near
Paris, is regarded as a good example of the
close collaboration between technologist and
architect, which is required for the design
of efficient factory buildings. The production
method calls for a vertical arrangement of the
different machines concerned so that the cor-
responding part of the building consists of
basement, ground floor and two upper floors.
In contrast, the operations connected with the
wrapping, packing and storing of the margar-
ine, as well as the reception of the raw ma-
terials and the despatch of the finished pro-
duct, requires a horizontal layout. The
premises required for all these purposes are
therefore accommodated in the long single-
floor section seen in the foreground.
STRUCTURES OF CONCRETE AND
ALUMINIUM.
The new Maua Pier at the foot of Rio de
Janeiro’s main street will add 2869 feet to
the port’s wharfage space. The pier is sup-
ported on reinforced concrete piles 62ft.
long, driven to bedrock. Bulkheads of re-
inforced concrete sheet piling are filled with
sand and crushed rock before the concrete
deck is poured. The two arms of the pier,
which are 49ft. wide, will be returned at

ACCRA WATER SUPPLY
INTERESTING AFRICAN INSTALLATION.
Increase From 2,300,000 Gallons to 6,000,000 A Day.
The provision of adequate water
supply to growing urban areas is one
major problem that is being tackled
by the Gold Coast Government. Ah
ready a very considerable amount of
construction has been undertaken by
the Public Works Department to en'
sure that Accra shall have a regular
and adequate water supply.
Recently the Minister of Commun'
ications and Works, the Honourable
Dr. Ansah Koi, carried out an inspec'
tion of the works being constructed
at Weija and watched the laying of
a section of the new 16'inch pipe line
from the waterworks to Accra. He
also went over the new filter house
and clear water well and heard an
explanation of the various processes,
including chemical treatment, through
which the water goes before it
reaches the consumer.
At the present time Accra gets
2,300,000 gallons of water a day from
the waterworks at Weija, but when
the extensions have been completed,
Accra will be able to get 6,000,000
gallons a day.
Prominent new features of the
landscape at Weija are the new filter
house and sedimentation tanks which
are provided with the latest and most
modern equipment. The filter house
and tanks, which are now nearing
completion, have been built of rein'
forced concrete with stone taken from
the actual site of the works and sand
from the River Densu.
When this new plant is working,
which is expected to be within three
or four months, water will be pump'
ed at night to a large tank situated
365 feet above seadevel and will then
flow through the treatment plant into
a 1,000,000 gallon reservoir—now un'
der construction —and thence flow, via
a cast iron pipe 16 inches in diam'
eter and nearly 12 miles long, to
Accra.
Of the 12 miles of this trunk
water'main almost 11 miles have been
completed and some six miles are
already in service. These pipes alto'
gether, weighed nearly 3,500 tons, all
of which had to be transported to the
site and lowered into a specially dug
trench. When the pipes were in posh
tion they were filled with water which
was then raised to a pressure greater
than any they would normally have
to withstand. This was done, so as
to detect weak or damaged pipes
which might burst when the main
was put into service.
A scheme has been prepared for
remodelling the distribution system
and work on this will follow the com'
pletion of the trunk main and new
waterworks extensions. Water will be
delivered in Accra in bulk to the
Dodowah Road reservoirs and redis-
tributed from there to the various
parts of Accra in such a way that one
district will not rob another district
of its water supply.
The size of the water mains will
be such that there will be ample pres'
sure of water at all stand'pipes
wherever they are. Details of this
scheme were worked out two years
ago but in developing a water supply
the programme of construction must
proceed methodically and work must
be well advanced on the water works
proper before attention can be given
to the distribution.
There are almost 60,000 people in
New South Wales waiting for tele'
phones, 48,000 being in the Metros
politan area.

Has the Incandescent Lamp Reached the
End of its Development ?
By Dr. A. DRESLER.
[Precis of Lecture delivered before The Illuminating Engineering
Society of Australia (N.S.W.) on March 6th, 1952.}
The recent rapid development of
discharge lamps with and without
fluorescence has almost obscured the
incandescent lamp, and physicists and
engineers alike will tend to forget all
about the good old tungsten lamp.
It was the nurpose of Dr. Dresler’s
lecture to show that the incandescent
lamp is still a very interesting and
even promising object of research.
There are various ways of consider-
ing the usefulness of a light source;
for instance, with regard to reliable
service, to price or to efficiency. The
efficiency of an incandescent lamp is
notoriously low, although it has been
considerably improved since the early
days of Edison and Swan. In 1880 a
carbon filament gave about 2.5 lumens
per watt; in 1935 a gas-filled tungsten
coiled coil lamp of 40 W. rendered 12
lumens per watt. When leading
Continental lamp manufacturers intro-
duced the Krypton lamp in 1938 an
efficiency of 13 lumens per watt was
reached. Thus, within less than 60
years the efficiency of the everyday
domestic type of incandescent lamp
has increased more than fourfold, and
it can rightly be asked whether or not
this development is to continue.
The radiation properties of tungsten
indicate that, if it were possible to in-
crease the temperature of the filament
beyond its present value without seri-
ously affecting the life of the lamp, a
considerable increase in luminous
efficiency (lumens/watt) and in lumi-
nane (candela/sq. in.) could become
feasible. If we could raise the tem-
perature of the coil of the 40 W.
lamp from about 2,700 degrees K.
to 3,500 degrees K. (still 160 degrees
K. below the melting point of tung-
sten!) we would get 50 lumens/watt,
instead of 12 lumens/watt. Unfor-
tunately, however, life of the lamp
decreases so rapidly with any increase
in filament temperature that possible
increases in efficiency are always offset
by the shortened average life. The
only way to overcome this difficulty is
to try and find means of reducing the
rate of tungsten evaporation at a given
filament temperature. These means
are well known; they are:
1. The use of a heavy filling gas,
i.e., a gas of high molecular or
atomic weight;
2. The increase of the pressure of
the filling gas within the lamp:
and
3. A combination of 1 and 2.
Whereas the use of a heavy filling
gas will mainly improve the efficiency
of lamps with thin, long coils (i.e., of
small wattage and high nominal volt-
age), the use of a high filling pressure
will mainly increase the efficiency of
lamps with short, thick coils such as
used in lamps of high wattage and/or
low voltage.
It is absolutely futile to try and
arrive at efficiency figures of lamps
differing in type and pressure of gas-
filling by theoretical calculation. The
only wav which will yield satisfactory
results is to make a sufficient number
of lamps and to test them. Such tests
show that, if the normal filling pres-
sure of about 600 mm. Hg. of argon
gas (to which about 10 per cent, of
nitrogen has been added) is doubled,
the luminous efficiency of a coiled
coil lamp can be increased by 4 to 8
per cent, for the same average life,
the higher figure being reached with
thick coils. If argon is replaced by
Krypton at the normal filling pressure
the improvement in luminous efficiency
ranges from 16 to 9 per cent., thin
coils giving the better performance.
If Krypton is used at double the nor-
mal filling pressure, all domestic lamps
in the range of 25 to 100 watt for
110-250 volts will show an increase in
luminous efficiency of about 18 per
cent, above the present-day ordinary
coiled-coil lamp with an argon filling
of 600 mm. Hg.
It would, however, be quite un-
realistic to think that this improvement
can be as easily achieved in practice as
it is reported here, for Krypton is still
a “rare” gas in the true meaning of
the word and its price is about 100
times that of argon. We should also
bear in mind that all automatic filling
and exhausting machines would have
to be adjusted to the sealing-off of
lamps the pressure of which exceeds
that of the surrounding air. This is
by no means an impossible task, but
nevertheless an expensive one.
The more important field of apply'
ing high gas pressures to incandescent
lamps is restricted to special lamps,
such as projector lamps. By using a
filling of 10 atmospheres of Krypton
it becomes practically feasible to build
projector lamps the luminance of which
is twice as high as in the correspond'
ing type of ordinary projector lamps
and which have an average life of
nearly double the normal one. Several
hundreds of such high pressure
Krypton'filled tungsten projector lamps
for domestic 8 or 9.5 mm. film pro'
jectors were built in Germany at the
beginning of World War 11. Later,
this development had to be abandoned
and the lamps never reached the
general public, but their performance
was really outstanding. It remains to
be hoped that lamp manufacturers in
Europe and U.S.A. will find the time
and interest to continue exploration
of this interesting and promising field
of experimental research.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Blunt asked how the efficiency
figures given in the lecture were affect'
ed by using lower voltages, such as
110 or 115 volts, or even 32 volts.
Dr. Dresler: The graphs shown were
based on nominal lamp current, not
on voltage. They apply to all supply
voltages within the range of 110 to
240 volts. The use of lower voltages,
such as 32 volts, depends on economy
—can. the extra copper required for
transformers and wiring be obtained
at a reasonable cost?
Dr. Giovanneli mentioned the con-
siderable difficulties the National Stan'
dards Laboratory was having in get'
ting tungsten lamps suitable for use
as photometric standards and sub'
standards. Normal tungsten lamps
tend to change their intensity with
time of use and also show changes
within small angles of alteration of
direction. He said he would like to
ask Dr, Dresler to comment on these
problems.
Dr. Dresler: Normal tungsten lamps
for domestic use should never be used
as standards for photometric work.
Lamps especially designed for such
purposes are available from lamp
manufacturers overseas and have
proved to be very reliable.
Dr. Giovanelli then mentioned that
the International Commission on Illu-
mination (C.1.E.) discussed this prob-
lem in Stockholm last year and decid-
ed to contact lamp manufacturers re-
52
March 24, 1952.
BUILDING, LIGHTING AND ENGINEERING


garding the construction of standard
lamps of different types.
Mr. Fallon stated that in his opinion,
for street lighting, long life is more
important than efficiency. He referred
to an overseas guaranteed figure of
3,000 hours life, but when he attempt'
ed to find similar lamps in Australia
he succeeded in finding only 1,350'
hour lamps from E.L.M.A.
Dr. Dresler replied that, as stated in
his lecture, life and efficiency of a
lamp were interdependent. From an
engineer’s point of view the answer
to Mr. Fallon’s question was quite
simple and straightforward. Those
lamps would be the best (i.e., the
most economical for his purpose)
which would produce a maximum of
lumen-hours for a minimum of cost.
Since Mr. Fallon would know his
costs, i.e., the price of a new lamp,
the actual maintenance and replace'
ment costs and the electricity charge,
he could compute the average lamp
life for which lumen'hours/pence could
become a maximum. The result of
such a calculation would necessarily be
that low costs of maintenance and
high electricity charges would make a
lamp of relatively short life but high
efficiency the most economical pro'
position, whereas when maintenance
costs were high and electricity cheap
one could afford to use lamps of longer
average life and lower efficiency. In
Norway, for instance, where hydro'
electricity is extremely cheap, street
lighting lamps have an average life of
2,500 hours. For general conditions,
however, it can be easily shown that
an average life of 1,000 hours is the
most economical life.
Mr. Wallace, referring to the tests
on evaporation rates at different volt'
ages, asked whether these tests were
limited to a small range of voltage
variation such as 10 per cent.?
Dr. Dresler: No. Tests are very
often carried out with more than 10
per cent, overvoltage, resulting in a
very considerable shortening of lamp
life. Lamp manufacturers have charts
which quote the voltages to be applied
to certain lamp types to shorten their
life by a given factor, which may be
as high as 100; this gives a life test in
10 or 15 hours.
Mr. Phillips: Have any metals other
than tungsten been found suitable for
use as filaments in incandescent lamps?
Dr. Dresler: -Other substances, for
instance, tantalum carbide and hafnium
carbide, have higher melting tempera'
tures than tungsten but cannot be
treated to give the required degree of
robustness. In other words, no other
substances are likely to be used as
substitutes for tungsten.
Mr. Smith asked whether Dr.
Dresler could report on any recent
progress in two fields which were
being investigated in the United King'
dom about 1937'1938? One was the
use of a single crystal tungsten wire.
The other was a triple coiled filament
at normal or at double normal pres'
sure. These lamps had no worth'
while life but had a very high effi'
ciency. They were also noted for the
rather dramatic explosions which in-
dicated the end of the useful life.
(Laughter.)
Dr. Dresler said that he had no ex'
perience with the triple coiled filament.
Development in a single crystal tung'
sten wire was no longer as important
as it was in the ’thirties, due to other
improvements in' treatment having
been developed.
Mr. Falk foresaw problems with high
brightnesses produced by the develop'
ments referred to by Dr. Dresler.
Dr. Dresler pointed out that no
problem of this kind existed for
domestic lamps, because at double the
normal filling pressure no significant
increase in brightness was noted. De'
velopments to increase the brightness
of lamps were purely in the fields of
projection lamps and the like.
Mr. Watsford questioned whether
the increasing efficiency brought about
bv recent developments was practical?
He understood that the voltage sen'
sitivity of lamps became much in'
creased as the efficiency was increased.
Dr. Dresler: In the domestic range
of lamps the increase in operating tern-
perature would not be great, since the
conditions of operation were substam
daily the same as at present. In the
projection lamp filled to a pressure of
ten atmospheres, the operating tern'
perature is deliberately chosen lower
than the optimum, to prevent a burn
out with voltage surges.

STAGGERED PLANNING.
To meet the demands of visiting vacationists in Palm Springs a row of single living-bedroom
units and a group of bungalows arranged around a small patio and pool have been designed.
The individual unit was set at an angle in order to get a maximum view of the mountains of
the west and southwest. A large louvered overhang minimizes the effects of the afternoon sun.
SIMPLICITY OF EXPRESSION.
There is a simple directness about some of the
best modern American designs that is very

and those that are necessary are clean-cut and
direct. We illustrate (top) the entrance

(continued from page 53)
Mr. Fothes said that Dr. Dresler’s
lecture had brought back to him nos-
talgic memories of the days before
fluorescent lighting, when all lighting
calculations could be carried out with
a slide rule and the Inverse Square
Law. Now, the advent of fluorescent
lamps had replaced his slide rule with
a foot rule for lighting calculation and
the old Inverse Square Law had been
replaced by tables and calculations
which had him in a perpetual state of
confusion. The progress in the incan-
descent lamp indicated by Dr. Dresler
made him feel that the “‘good old
days” were not completely passed.
(Laughter and applause.)
Vote of Thanks.
In proposing the vote of thanks,
Mr. Austin said that Dr. Dresler’s ex-
perience and his keen scientific brain
were most evident during his address.
Yet, unlike many who have spent
years of research, he showed a clear
appreciation of practical engineering
difficulties. Mr. Austin mentioned
that although he himself was too far
away to read any of the information
on the slides shown by Dr. Dresler,
yet the explanation of the graphs was
so clearly presented that he was able
to appreciate fully the meaning of
these graphs. On behalf of all mem'
bers present he extended sincere
thanks to Dr. Dresler for giving the
lecture, especially as he flew over from
Melbourne to do so.
Mr. Watson, in seconding the
motion, said he was particularly im'
pressed by the answers given by Dr.
Dresler to the many and varied ques'
tions put to him. In his experience,
mechanical defects were responsible
for more l am p failures than thermal
burn-outs, and this in itself was suf-
ficient testimony on the effectiveness
of lamp research.
The vote of thanks was carried with
hearty acclamation.
The “Black Light” Wonder Lamp Has
Enormous Possibilities
By JOHN RIGG.
The detective story-writer, hard put
to introduce originality into his novels,
has not yet begun to exploit what he
would probably be pleased to describe
as the “black light wonder lamp.”
Yet this is a fair description of the
black light, or ultra-violet, lamp. It
can differentiate immediately between
different grades of olive oil; identify
potato disease, and detect turnip pulp
in jam; discover in wine any addition
of inferior wine down to 10 per cent.;
detect faults, invisible to the naked
eye, in textiles, and forgeries in stamps;
it can determine whether human bones
come from a corpse which has been
burned or buried, and can detect in a
few seconds secret communications in,
for example, prisoners’ correspondence.
It has been used on many occasions to
secure evidence leading to convictions
in a police court.
Lamps, both stationary and portable,
are manufactured in Britain (one port-
able lamp being sold at £3O), and the
technique of fluorescence analysis is
widely Used. A number of museums
have installed fluorescence cabinets,
one of the most striking being that in
the Natural History Museum, London.
The results of fluorescence analysis are
not always final; but the test is valuable
since it is instantaneous, visual, and of
wide application. In many cases it is,
too, an extremely sensitive test -—-
aesculin (a complex sugar compound)
can be detected in water in a solution
of one part in a million million. In
other cases the differentiation of
various grades of olive oil, for ex-
ample fluorescence analysis will
succeed where chemical tests fail. Nor
is the specimen tested ever injured in
the process.
How the Huorescence
Lamp Works.
The value of the fluorescence lamp
depends on the fact that its invisible
ultra-violet rays can make many sub-
stances, solid and liquid, glow in dark-
ness or diffused light with strange, dis-
tinct colours. Practically every variety
of mineral or vegetable oil (among a
wide range of other substances) has
this characteristic; and on this fact
alone there has, incidentally, developed
a whole technique of identification and
analysis. Cracks or flaws in castings,
for example, may be detected by bath-
ing the metal in an oil solution, wash-
ing the solution away, and then ex-
amining the metal under the lamp,
when any solution which has seeped
into a crack will glow with its charac-
teristic colour.
So varied are the applications of the
fluorescence lamp that (although the
same principle is involved throughout)
it would be as well to consider them
industry by industry, profession by
profession.

First, in police work: many large
banks and police laboratories are now
fitted with a lamp for the immediate
testing of cheques, banknotes and
securities. Forged notes can usually
be detected instantly when the fluores'
cences of their paper, watermark and
ink are compared with those of a
genuine note. A special paper with
an extremely strong fluorescence is,
indeed, manufactured, and any altera'
tions or erasures on cheques made
from this paper are instantly detected
under the lamp.
Forgeries Can Be
Easily Detected.
Prisoners’ correspondence can be
examined in a matter of seconds with
the help of the fluorescence lamp, and
any secret messages written in milk or
saliva detected. Nor does this method
of examination leave any trace which
might warn the prisoner’s correspon'
dent. The lamp is indeed essential in
discovering fraud and forgery general'
ly, for in the end these offences are
often enough matters of paper, ink
and pencil marks alone.
Different qualities of paper, com'
posed as they are of different kinds,
and proportions, of wood or vegetable
fibre, show widely different colours
under the lamp, so that fraud by the
substitution or joining of paper may
be readily discovered. Even after the
ink characters have been rased they
can be photographed in fluorescence;
and different kinds of adhesives and
sealing waxes, again, show different
colours.
In police work generally the fluores'
cent characteristics of any material
may, at some time or other, provide
valuable evidence. Spots of oil, wisps
of hair, splinters of wood or fragments
of glass found on the clothing of a
suspect may connect him with the
same substances at the scene of a
crime. Bloodstains have even been de'
tected on the leaves of bushes after
long exposure to th weather; and the
examination of bones to determine
whether a body had been buried or
burned is a simple matter since those
from a burned corpse do not fluoresce.
How the Lamp Establishes
True Values.
The lamp is equally valuable to
those doing research work in museums
and art galleries. A number of cases
of the substitution on a painting of
one artist’s name for another have
been brought to light by the lamp,
while writing in the margin of a
Chaucer manuscript was deciphered by
this method after other means had
failed. Fluorescence analysis can tell
the difference between old and newly'
cut jade; detect the artificial “ageing”
of ivory; show up retouching in old
paintings; and provide the philatelist,
in all branches of his work, with urn
exampled assistance.
Many Substances Have
a Characteristic Colour Glow.
The fluorescence lamp is used regU'
larly in a number of industries for in'
spection purposes. In certain branches
of the textile industry, for instance,
where it is essential, after dying, to
remove any traces of free naphthol,
the lamp is used to see how successful
attempts at eradication have been.
Upholsterers use the lamp to dis'
tinguish between old cotton flock or
kapok, and new cotton. Two simple
tests have been devised by which vis'
cose, bemberg and acetate rayons may,
after staining, be differentiated; vis'
cose yarn glowing with a dull blue
under the lamp, bemberg a brilliant
blue or bluish white, and acetate a
luminous deep blue. Manila fibres in
ropes can be picked out at once and
imitation cotton can be distinguished
from genuine cotton by stronger
fluorescence.
In addition, faults in the weaving or
dyeing of fabric, undetected by the
naked eye, are picked out under the
lamp; while some laundries use a
colourless but highly fluorescent mark'
ing ink for identifying their cus'
tomers’ clothes, which are sorted urn
der ultra'violet rays. Finally, it is
possible to detect at once, by the aid
of the lamp, whether cotton has under'
gone any process, as this invariably
affects the fluorescence.
All Trades and Industries
Can Benefit.
For the papermaker the lamp can
identify various kinds of wood pulp
and help the chemist to estimate what,
and how much, loading (such as size
or china clay) should be added. The
water'resisting qualities of paper have
also been assessed with the lamp’s help.
It is possible to distinguish, under
ultraviolet light, six different kinds of
amber gum, and to detect as low as
one per cent, of mineral wax in bees'
wax. Rubber manufacturers find the
lamp an essential piece of laboratory
equipment; one manufacturer has even
reported that zinc oxides of different
origins used in manufacture show such
divergencies that various makers’
samples can be identified by their dif'
fering fluorescences.
Identification Is Greatly
Simplified.
In the detection of metallic and in'
organic compounds the fluorescence
lamp provides specific and very sen'
sitive tests; the action of ultra'violet
rays on 3,000 minerals, including many
precious stones ,has been investigated
by research workers—with results so
characteristic that identification, even
determination of origin, is possible.
Portable fluorescence lamps are widely
used in testing rocks for uranium;
and, in fact, in all mineral work,
petrology, and even palaeontology the
lamp provides valuable information.
Its contribution in the fields of medi'
cine, bacteriology and pharmacy is
equally valuable to research worker or
industrialist.
Photography of objects under the
fluorescence lamp is simple; and the
resulting pictures are not only valuable
as records but sometimes show details
missed by the naked eye.
For a further study of fluorescence
analysis with more details of its indus'
trial uses the reader may be referred
to “Fluorescence Analysis in Ultra'
violet Light,” by Radley and Grant
(Chapman 6? Hall).

and parchment cylinder can be set on a table
or suspended in the wall. It was designed
by Jascha Heifetz, of New York. Diffused
lighting is the theory behind the floor lamp
illustrated below. It consists of an 11-inch
high ceramic urn which throws light upwards
against a 24-inch fibreglass disc umbrella.
It is a design of Mitchell Bobrick.

“Prestressed” Concrete Here Soon
AUSTRALIAN FIRM PLANS FACTORY.
At the recent official opening of
the Monier Brick Pty. Ltd., the Man-
aging Director of Concrete Industries
(Aust.) Ltd., Mr. C. H. Shaddock,
signified the intention of the company
to shortly embark upon the manu-
facture of “prestressed” concrete.
Because of the importance of this
announcement to the building indus-
try, it is timely to tell something of
the technique involved in the pro-
duction of prestressed concrete.
Briefly, there is a minor revolution
taking place in the overseas con-
struction industry.
Using a technique known as “pre-
stressing,” which has been highly de-
veloped in Europe, engineers now are
designing girders of concrete that are
used instead of high-strength steel as
supporting members. This is some-
thing almost unheard of in the his-
tory of concrete for, while this ma-
terial can take tremendous loads in
compression, its tensile strength al-
ways has been rated as low. Now
prestressing has given builders a ma-
terial as strong in tension as it is in
compression.
Prestressing uses high-grade steel
wire and concrete in a manner that
makes the best of both materials. One
of the older applications and perhaps
the most familiar is the principle of
its use in concrete pipes and water
tanks.
According to engineers, the only
safe course in designing for concrete
is to assume that it has no tensile
strength at all. Thus, if plain con-
crete pipes were filled with water un-
der pressure they would soon burst.
To prevent this the pipes are first
tightly wound with steel wire, which
is pulled, or stressed, to put large
compressive forces on the pipe—just
the type of forces that concrete can
take.
Principle of Prestressing.
When water pressure is applied to
the inside of the pipe it only balances
the compression of the wire with the
result that the concrete itself takes
practically no stress or at most a re-
duced compression. In short, the
pipe is “prestressed” to take the water
pressure load.
That is the principle of prestressing.
Steel is made to lend its tensile
strength and resiliency to the concrete
with the result that less steel is need-
ed to do a given job.
In making girders for buildings or
bridges, the same principle is applied
but the prestressing wires are strung
lengthwise through the concrete and
anchored at the ends or firmly bond-
ed in place.
Actually, prestressing is an old
idea, as old as metal hoops driven
down over the curved staves of a
wooden barrel. It is simply the build-
ing into any structural member of
stresses opposed to those the member
will carry.
The steel-wire used in prestressing
is “cold-drawn,” manufactured by a
technique by which the wire from the
mill is allowed to cool down and then
is drawn through holes in a die that
reduces its diameter and increases its
strength considerably.
The drawing out increases the
wire’s strength by changing its cross
sectional structure into a coarse, fib-
rous one, quite different from the
more granular structure it had when
it came from the mill.
In reinforced concrete the reinforc-
ing steel doesn’t come into play until
an external load is applied. Mem-
bers made of this material have to be
built heavy and relatively short, for
beyond a certain limited size they
will not even support their own dead-
weight.
The load is carried by the steel
from the start in a prestressed mem-
ber, and there is no dead-weight prob-
lems. This enables the members to
be lightly built and to bridge what
were once considered to be unthink-
able spans (see illustration, top).
Extensive Use.
Around the world prestressed con'
Crete is coupling giant strength with
simplicity of design and economy of
materials.
At Liverton, Devon, a factory has
been erected using prestressed con'
crete members. The roof beams are
“I” shaped and span some 50 feet
between walls, yet the strength has
done away with any need for inter-
mediate columns and given more floor
space. Also the roof deflection has
been kept to a minimum. When one
53-fot girder was tested under full
working load the measured deflection
was only 0.94 inches and there was
100 per cent, recovery when the load
was removed.
In Rio de Janeiro the Galeao
Bridge covers 1215 feet in 15 spans
of simply supported prestressed gird-
ers of various lengths. The longest
span is 142.5 feet. All precasting and
pre-stressing was done in a central
yard and the girders taken to the site
and assembled from barges by floating
derricks. This reduced handling at
the site and any falsework to a min-
imum. When the bridge was only
half completed, engineers were able
to open three traffic lanes for use.
At Ghent, the De Smet Bridge over
a well-travelled canal was restricted in
Concrete possessing the
strength of steel holds
water in Orleans Reservoir,
France.
Prestressed girders span
138 feet in Bourg d’
Oisans Bridge, France.

allowable headroom and approaches.
The bridge is in the centre of the
town and the designers were limited
in what they could do in the way
of approaches and grades to build up
the required headroom to pass the
canal traffic.
It was decided that the structure
could not exceed 44 inches in depth,
and a prestressed design was chosen
because it was 14 per cent, lower in
cost than a rigid frame concrete struc-
ture, and deflected only 0.75 inches
under full load.
Many other instances could be giv-
en of the applications of prestressed
concrete, and an illustration shows
two well-known continental examples.
They are, experts say, but the first
steps in the use of a versatile new

STONE EXPOSURE TESTS.
Results of American Research.
Stones from 47 States and 16 foreign
countries form a wall built at the U.S.
National Bureau of Standards as part
of a long'range investigation of the
weathering of stone masonry. The
project was undertaken in cooperation
with the Committee on Natural Build'
ing Stones of the American Society
for Testing Materials. This report,
issued by the National Bureau of
Standards, discusses construction
features of the wall and sets forth
problems on weathering and discolora'
tion for study.
Among the thirty distinct types of
stones in the wall are many varieties
of the usual type, such as marble, lime'
stone, sandstone, and granite. Their
variations in composition or physical
properties, including strength, porosity
and density, make it possible to in'
vestigate the relation between such
properties and weather resistance.
Tables in the report contain complete
identification of the stones and infer'
mation concerning their properties.

Acknowledged
M.B.A. MAKES PRESENTATION TO SECRETARY.
At a recent meeting of the Master
Builders’ Association of N.S.W. the
Executive made suitable acknowledg'
ment of the fact that their Secretary,
Mr. L. G. Smith, has completed 25
years of exceedingly useful and un-
broken service to this progressive body
of Master Builders.
At an appropriate time during the
meeting, the M.B.A. President, Mr.
C. E. Thompson, told members pres'
ent that he had a pleasing duty to per'
form, which was to make, on behalf
of the members of the Master Build'
ers’ Association, a presentation of a
Silver Tray to the Secretary, Mr. L.
G. Smith, who had completed 25
years’ unbroken service with the As'
sociation, the Tray being engraved in
the following terms: —
“Presented to L. G. Smith, Esq.,
J.P., by the Members of The
Master Builders’ Association of
New South Wales, in apprecia'
tion and esteem of twenty'five
years’ loyal, unbroken service.
10th October, 1951.”
Mr. Thompson then warmly con'
gratulated Mr. Smith, and handed the
tray to him.
Upon rising to accept the present'
ation, Mr. Smith stated that he wish'
ed to sincerely thank the President
and other Members of the Associa'
tion for the beautiful gift, and he was
particularly gratified to receive, in a
tangible form, this recognition of his
services. He had endeavoured to
serve all Members without distinction,
and expressed the opinion that the
dearest things in life could not be
bought. He considered the greatest
of all to be the good wishes and re'
spect of his fellow men.
Mr. Smith said he had always plac'
ed the Association first and foremost,
often to his personal discomfort, and
could look upon his many years of
service as being, in the main, pleas'
urable though at times exacting, and
requiring constant vigilance.
Continuing, Mr. Smith told mem'
bers that it was a privilege to work
for the Association and he would con'
tinue to apply himself to his duties
without fear or favour, in the inter'
ests of all.
At the conclusion of his remarks,
Mr. Smith received a hearty round
of applause from the members as'
sembled.

NEUTRAL-SCREENED CABLES.
The Standards Association of Aus'
tralia has issued a draft specification
covering a type of cable which was
originally intended for overhead ser'
vice line work, but which has also
found some application for internal
wiring of buildings. Two classes of
neutrahscreened cable are described,
one a “covered” neutrahscreened cable
and the other an “insulated” neutrah
screened cable. The difference is that
the former has the neutrahscreen
covered by material which is not recog'
nised as affording insulation but which
provides mechanical protection; and
the latter has the screen covered by
material recognised as affording double
insulation. Covered types are suitable
only for aerial conductors, while the
insulated type may be used for circuit
wiring as well as for aerial work.

Secretary of the M.B.A. of N.S.W.
ing" joins the M.B.A. in the congrat-
ulations which Mr. Cmith so justly
merits.
Through long years of close asso-
ciation with him, this paper and its
representatives have received nothing
but courteous consideration, and a
kindly understanding of the many
problems which beset a trade journal
of the type and standing of “Build-
ing, Lighting and Engineering,”
We echo the heartfelt wish of all
who have been brought into happy
association with Mr. Smith:
“Health, happiness and many fruit-
ful years of unselfish service.”

Mobile Laboratory For Testing Soils
RESEARCH IN VICTORIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The cause of most failures in build'
ings on clay soil is the swelling and
shrinkage of the soil resulting from
seasonal changes in water content.
The Division of Soils of the Com'
monwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation is operating a
mobile laboratory which is being used
for examining the properties of the
clay soils of Melbourne and Adelaide
to determine what makes them ob'
jectionable for domestic building foum
dations, and prospective building sites
are being tested with a view to map-
and defining areas likely to prove
trou blesome.
The “Triaxial” Test.
The main piece of apparatus in the
mobile laboratory is the triaxial com'
pression testing machine, for the value
of the “compressive strength” is an
important property of the soil and
can vary between very wide limits for
the same soil, depending upon the
water content.
In the “triaxial test” the sample
consists of a cylinder of soil in
diameter and 4in. long, which is con'
fined by a lateral pressure and com'
pressed in the direction of its axis by
a piston, and the maximum stress that
the sample will support is then
measured.
In mapping the soils, the basis on
which a soil is defined and recognised
is the soil profile, and in general this
consists of a vertical section of the
soil to a depth of about 6ft. The soil
is sampled by boring to the required
depth with a 4in. hand'operated post
hole auger, though a power auger is
being developed for more rapid work.
A steel tube is then forced into the
ground which cuts a soil core or
sample of the required size.
This is the first time that a mobile
laboratory has been used for testing

work of this nature in Australia. With
the help of standard surveying
methods, engineering properties of the
soil, as measured in the laboratory,
are assigned to the different types of
soil and a picture is built up of the
soils occurring in an area.
The results of these tests are being
used by the Housing Authorities in
both Victoria and South Australia as
a basis for the design of footings to
suit the pronerties of the soil in “dif'
ficult” areas. The use of the mobile
laboratory assists and speeds up the
testing of the soil for this purpose.

GREATEST INTERNATIONAL
MINESWEEPING OPERATION
ENDS.
Sweeping 600,000 Mines.
Without any of the usual fanfare of
trumpets which accompanies the wind'
ing'up of a a reat enterprise, there has
just come to an end the biggest inter'
national mine'clearance operation ever
known. Since the work of sweeping
the remaining wartime mines began in
the summer of 1945, ships of no fewer
than sixteen nations have been em
gaged in making the seas of Europe
safe again for all shipping.
Thus ended an operation of great
complexity, and one which was made
possible only by the whole'hearted CO'
operation of ships of the following
maritime countries: Britain (which has
directed the operation throughout),
the United States, France, Russia, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Nor'
way, Sweden, Finland, Greece, Turkey,
Italy, Yugoslavia, Germany and
Rumania. Sweden and Turkey joined
in, although they were neutral
throughout the war.
Russian ships confined themselves to
what the planners called the B Zone
—the Barents, Baltic and Black Sea.
Between 1939 and 1945 the beh
ligerents are believed to have laid in
European waters about 600,000 mines
of various types, so immense tracks of
sea had to be swept and re'swept by
formations of ships averaging a speed
of about nine knots. In the North Sea
alone their “territory” was 100,000
square miles!
At the peak period, in the summer
of 1946, no fewer than 2,000 mine'
sweepers of the sixteen nations were
busy in the North Sea,
Sea, and elsewhere.
And until more is known about the
“longevity” of magnetic mines, ships
will be advised still to use buoyed
channels in those areas where mine'
layers were formerly exceptionally
busy.

ROYAL ADELAIDE
EXHIBITION.
The Royal Adelaide Exhibition,
which opened at Wayville, S.A., on
March 7, is part of a pattern which
has spread through the British Com'
monwealth. It is a distinctive and
worthy representation of South Aus'
tralia’s achievements and skills. As a
spectacle, it excels outstanding dis'
plays of the past.
As a varied sample of the work of
Australian brains and hands, and the
talents of New Australians, it serves
to show the great progress made in
many fields.
While not exclusively South Aus'
tralian, the Exhibition provides an im'
pressive array of evidence to support
claims that, in the output of Austra'
lia’s secondary industries, the State is
surpassed only by N.S.W. and Vic'
toria. With farsighted Government
aid and advice, manufacturing has
been expanded, and production great'
ly stimulated.
20 Acres of Exhibits.
Occupying an area of 20 acres in
the Centennial Hall and Wayville
Showground, the working exhibits are
impressive examples of industrial and
defence developments and existing
works in the State.
One of the models shows the
£220,000 walking dragline excavator
removing overburden at Leigh Creek,
while an electric shovel scoops the
coal into a conveyor for haulage to
crushers.
A transparent perspex house, show'
ing the latest electric light fittings,
a factory producing electric stoves,
and a model dairy are attracting con'
siderable attention.
Smoke comes from the chimney
stack of a rotating kiln in a model
of one of two new cement works.
A large model of the proposed My'
ponga reservoir is so carefully built
that engineers are using it in design'
ing the spillway and associated works.
The U.S. Atomic Energy Commis'
sion sent a model of the Oakridge
atomic reactor, and a model of Brit'
ain’s first reactor at Harwell shows
how air, heated by the reactor, warms
the Harwell establishment.
Adelaide’s suburban electric rail'
ways are running smoothly—in min'
iature —at the exhibition.
A pilotless jet target plane for the
Woomera Rocket Range is displayed
in the Department of Defence sec'
tion, which also features rockets and
miniature rockets in flight.
Many of the large working models
cost more than £5OOO each, and the
£2,500,000 Exhibition, which is draw-
ing immense crowds, will remain open
for two months.

EVERY - DAY AFFAIRS
BEING AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BY
Mrs. FLORENCE M. TAYLOR,
BEFORE ROCKDALE ROTARY, ON MARCH 18., 1952.
A Built-Up Knowledge.
As a journalist for forty'four
years I have attended thousands
of lectures and addresses. One
would only have to go to two a
week to bring the number up to
one hundred a year, but one at'
tends many more than two a
week.
In that time one hears a prodh
gous amount of profound and
original thought, particularly
when associated with technical
newspapers, such as those I have
the honour of editing.
And looking back over the
millions of words I have heard, I
have come to the conclusion that,
though the Speaker’s general
knowledge is a built'Up acquish
tion, there is very little that the
listener retains unless the oral in-
formation is accompanied by the
visual, such as one reads in the
papers the next day.
Sometimes I feel like little
Gwendoline who annoyed her
teacher. Teacher said ""Gwen'
doline, here have I been talking
for half an hour about the Obeh
isk, and you are not paying the
least attention. Everything I say
to you seems to go in one ear and
out of the other. Now, tell me,
what is an Obelisk?” Gwendoline
replied, ""A thing that goes in one
ear and out of the other.”
Because many people are like
Gwendoline and myself, I now
provide a copy of my address SO
that listeners may take it home for
visual attention the next day, and
from its contents deduct the fact
that here is one, at least, that
loves her country well enough to
£;zz S
courage to do.
Before coming to “every'day
affairs” we have to go back
through the ages a bit and pay
tribute to the past for the built'
up knowledge and achievements
that go to make up these every'
day affairs.
The Democratic Age.
We have had no end of ages—
The Stone Age, The Flint Age,
The Bronze Age, The Iron Age,
which might be described as the
hard ages of the dim distant past,
until we reach the Easy Age of
tO'day, where everyone is mak'
ing a fetish of the idea of exert'
ing the least possible amount of
energy for the most amount of
money. Mother, however, is the
exception, for she has to work
harder than ever because she can'
not get help, meanwhile we are
paying dearly for idleness in the
fact that all things are getting
dearer and dearer and scarcer and
scarcer, and more rubbishy every
day. And strangely enough, it is
all done under the laws of this
country. If there is a strike it
has to be “an authorised strike’’
otherwise it is not legal. Who'
ever heard of such tommy rot?
The idea of allowing bandits to
upset the economy of a country
like this and calling it "legal.”
Unionists are making a crusade
*dle mom^n ts. It is going
through their ranks of labour like
re-
*s. f ust years since
Democritus, the Greek Philoso'
first expounded the theory
Government by the people and
SOC^ equality, or Democracy,
w^ic b gives the unthinking
masses power over all intelligent
P e °pl e by reason of the fact that
are more of them, and they
can outv °tc the intelligent,
diey want idle moments they
can vote or them and bring the
w b°l e country to a standstill,
w bich they are rapidly doing,
It was Democritus who first ex'
pounded the atomic theory. It
has taken all these years between
to bring atomic energy into use.

This all-service light dumper has been developed for the
moving of loads short distances.
It finds particular use in the BUILDING TRADE, FOUN-
DRIES, FACTORIES, ON THE WHARVES, FARMS,
and WAREHOUSES.
The G.F. Light Dumper has been designed to carry any load
up to 10 cwt. economically with continued, efficient opera-
tion while controls have been reduced to an absolute mini-
mum. Difficult terrain or confined working areas are easily
negotiated. The Hopper may be tipped and returned with-
out the driver leaving his seat. A dozer blade is available
for attachment and is used successfully for light spreading.

Where it will take us is a prob'
lem that causes grave concern in
many quarters.
The Age of Problems.
I am glad I lived in the days
when the art of graceful living
counted for something. We still
have many beautiful traditions
left. But, after living my full three
score years and ten, if I were ask'
ed to give a name to the present
era, I would say it was an age of
problems that are most unsettling
not because of what we are do'
ing, but because of what we are
leaving undone. For, to this age
belongs the forty'hour week,
strikes, gO'slow, the Darg, the
abundant holidays and the sick
leave which everyone has to take
—any excuse will do for idling
away the hours or exerting the
least effort when at work.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox once
wrote:
“There are two kinds of people
on earth, I wean,
The people who lift, and the
people who lean.”
In Australia, we have plenty of
people who lean. You can lean
on your shovels this way (handle
of shovel in the waistline of the
back) or you can lean on your
shovels that way (with the hand
and chin resting on the handle
of the shovel). You can see men
any day on any Government job,
more than half naked, disgusting'
looking objects, demonstrating the
art of leaning on shovels. I’m
glad to be a woman and be able
to speak my mind about these re'
volting sights that are lowering
mankind. You can see electricians
sitting on tables, yarning and
yawning by the hour, taking
months and months to do a job
that should be done in a week.
One ganger on road work said
he thought it rather clever if men
worked two hours and got eight
hours pay for it. My friend to
whom this was said replied “But
that is not honest. If you went
into a butchers’ shop for eight
pounds of meat and paid for eight
pounds, and you got two, you

would say the butcher had “rook'
ed you.” He replied “Oh, but
that is different.”
Tradesmen and Craftsmen.
A bricklayer must not lay more
than 300 bricks in a day. In the
past, he laid 1,000 bricks without
overmuch exertion and we got
houses cheaply then, and plenty
of houses to select from. All
other tradesmen are similarly re'
stricted in their output as the
bricklayer. You can rarely get a
thing mended. You are told “it
is worn out” and so you decide to
buy a new one only to find they
are “off the market.”
The accumulated waste of
energy that should be profitably
employed in every sphere in prod'
igous.
And all this is taking place
with a war on the horizon.
A few years ago, a man named
Amor made a medal that bears
my name and profile. He was
old and sick but he said he want'
ed to do that himself because
craftsmen had practically died
out. He wanted that medal, at
least, to be worthy of the subject
—a nice compliment to me, I
grant, but think of the ominous
words “No more craftsmen.” One
has to look to people 60 or 70
years of age to carry out anything
requiring great skill. Unless
people work harder they will
never become masters of their
craft.
Our Universities are full of
people seeking higher knowledge,
more power to them.
Our Conservatorium (a miser'
able, ramshackle place, with urn
dulating floors, ricketty stairs, and
winding passages leading any'
where by chance Was converted
from the Government House
Stables) is full of music students
—more power to them too.
But what concerns me is not
the cultural side of life alone.
Where are we going to get trades'
men and craftsmen from to do
an honest'to'goodness day’s work
and weave beauty into everyday
things, and build homes or city
buildings to make this era artistic
and loveable instead of slip'
shoddy and nondescript, with
their “anything is good enough
for Australia” outlook?
The Slow Turn-round.
We are regimented, curtailed
and controlled by Governments
and slowed down by Unions’ de*
cree at a time when we should
concern ourselves with one thing
—the preservation of our country
and the British Empire. What a
stigma to this country that our
ships take four times longer to
turn round (if we exempt the
regular liners) than they would
take in any other port in the
world. What controls Unions
have when it takes more miners
to hew coal, after the mines have
been mechanised than it did be'
fore they were mechanised.
Sometimes one machine is ealeu'
lated to produce as much as forty
men, but miners won’t let it. Aus'
tralia is now producing 17,600,'
000 tons of black coal which is
just 3,000,000 tons below require'
ments, or more if we are to
provide electricity, run transport,
heat our homes and make the
quantity of steel the country
needs and which it is equipped
to produce. With the supply of
coal at present provided it can

WHAT THE WORLD IS DOING.
(Top) NEW SOUTHAMPTON OCEAN
TERMINAL, which replaces the inadequate
station at Ocean Dock, built in 1911 and
damaged by bombing during the war. The
actual building is British Railway’s first great
achievement. Begun in 1947, the Terminal
was opened on July 31, 1950. It incorpor-
ates the most modern dockside equipment and
passenger facilities. (2nd top) OSLO TOWN
HALL, NORWAY. Built at a time when
functionalism was intended to be expressed in
architecture, this building must ever remain
a manifestation of robust strength, as though
it had to be more impressive than other city
buildings. It lets plenty of light and air
through its myriads of rectangular windows.
The towers house the clock and carillon.
Sculptures and other decorations were by the
best Norwegian artists. (3rd top) RIDGE-
WAY, MILL HILL, ENGLAND. New In-
stitute of the Medical Research Council, which
posed the architects on several problems, the
most important one being that of erecting a
building in a somewhat restricted area, whilst
providing a substantial amount of accommo-
dation, well lit and ventilated. The solu-
tion was found by constructing a central
seven storey block, with two wings at each
end, set obliquely and having three storeys
from ground level at the front (as in illus-
tration). The building was begun in 1938
and only the outside shell of the main block
was completed when building operations
ceased in 1942. It has since been completed
and working space of about 90,000 sq. ft. is
now fully occupied. (Bottom) TRINITY
CHURCH AND HALL, POPLAR. LON
DON. This is a part of the Lansbury
Neighbourhood scheme, a reconstruction of
war-damaged areas. The church replaces a
pre-war building demolished by enemy ac-
tion, and includes a main hall with full stage,
a small hall, clubrooms, etc. It will seat
400 people.

THE CLOSED SHOP
The only difference between a shop door and a house door used
to be a few small panes of glass in the upper part of the former; both
doors were shut, and although the shop door was not locked against
the would'be customer, there was no invitation to enter. To'day
that invitation is supplied by large doors of sparkling transparent,
shock'resisting “ARMOURPLATE” glass, that give an uninterrupted
view of the inside of the shop from the street, and swing back at a
touch to admit customers. Make the shop brighter and better by

only produce two'thirds of its
capacity. We could produce
enough steel for all Australia’s re'
quirements and then have a mar'
gin for export. Our steel is the
cheapest in the world. This
condition should bring industry
and capital to Australia and we
would not then have the night'
mare we are now facing of cur'
tailing our imports by 50%. Our
mechanics are skilled enough to
produce machines and tools for
our needs and for export and this
“export” would enable us to bring
still more plant into the country
and pay for our “imports.” We
have all the raw materials, yet
we have nothing to sell because
our men will not work long
enough and hard enough.
A Nation of Sluggards.
We must guard against becom'
ing a nation of sluggards, with
no ambition to put by for old age
or sickness, because we know a
benign Government will tax all
the diligent, ingenious or enter'
prising people to provide amen'
ities for those not so diligent. It
never occurs to us that the time
may come when the enterprising
people will say “What’s the use.”
Then there will be no one to
tax. Already one in every fourth
person is a public servant and
soon, very soon, one in every four
will be receiving welfare, which
means that every two persons will
have to work to keep four going,
plus all their dependents.
It is public service and welfare
run mad.
Food Shortages.
We are rapidly reaching “a
pretty pass” with our food short'
ages. A few years ago a wheat
board told farmers to plant less
wheat, now they are telling them
to plant more wheat. But the
farmer will not go on planting at
a loss, then, where will our bread
come from? We have too many
controls from people who have
never been on the land. Egg con'
trol, wool control, wheat control,
meat control, butter control. Hun'
dreds of boards have been set up
to control us —off the face of the
earth it seems. People are leav'
ing the land because under con'
trols, it will not yield sufficient
profit for them. In 1947'48 farm'
ers cultivated 22,800,000 acres of
wheat. The price the Govern'
ment got for it was 21/'. The
price the farmer was allowed, urn
der controls, was 10/'. This sit'
nation has since been revised and
the farmers are permitted to re'
ceive a fraction more. But they
are still under controls. In 1950'
51 the farmers grew 11,300,000
acres. This year only 10,000,000
acres will be sown.
Gas Company’s One Per Cent.
Interest.
And speaking of controls, what
do you think of a Government
that whilst bringing up costs of
wages and materials will say to
shareholders in the Gas Company
“One per cent, interest on your
investment is good enough,”
How long do you suppose that
will last?
We forget that all the things
we are now enjoying are the pro'
ducts of diligent people in the
past. We, of this era, are not de'
vising things to benefit others in
the next one hundred years as
others in the past hundred years
devised for us. Are we becoming
decadent?
Idling The Hours Away.
Out of 365 days a year, 104
have to be taken off for Satur'
days and Sundays, eleven statu'
tory holidays, two weeks 1 holiday
equalling ten days (sometimes
three weeks), a week’s sick leave
(5 days) which everybody takes.
Our year of 365 days is thus
dwindled down by 130 days to
235 days which leaves less than
two'thirds of the year for work'
ing. Then, under the forty'hour
week, we have eight hours each
day for 5 days mapped out as
working hours, which leaves 16
hours out of 24 —or twO'thirds
to be spent on eating, sleeping
and recovering from the eight
hours work. This means, as there
are 8,760 hours in a year of 365
days, there are only 5,640 hours
in a working year of 235 days,
and as 8 hours only are put aside
for working, the result is 1,880
hours a year for working out of
8,760 hours. But because we are
only halThearted about working
and have to deduct time for
smokos, afternoon teas, lunches,
etc., and go slow for the rest of
the time (I am referring to aver'
age workers such as the men we
see on the roads, and bricklayers
and others so controlled) it would
be safe to say that less than four
hours a day are worked, or 940
hours in a 235'day year. That
being so the average hours work'
ed per day of 365 days would not
amount to much more than 2\
hours, which boils down to the
fact that the rest of the time —
our most priceless asset —is
thrown away with both hands.
What Others Have Done For Us.
Just think of it, 100 years ago.

A CITY SCHOOL BUILDING IN FRANCE.
This group of school buildings, built by Niermans Bros, in 1934-37, at Puteaux, is of reinforced
concrete faced with wire-cut bricks. Rows of windows gird the building, the light glare being
softened by screening on the lower halves of the windows. In the design, a feature has been
made of annular courses of bricks along the top of the building. The central feature of solid
walling provides a proper location for and emphasis to the School’s Crest.

water was not brought by pipe'

was no garbage removal system,
no sewerage system. Doultons
in England provided the first

Trains were just coming into
use. Buses and trams had not been
established at all. If a man had
a job anywhere, he moved his
home and family to be within
walking distance of the job. Urn
der private enterprise there were
plenty of houses to live in, rents
were competitive and not only
that, landlords vied with each
other to produce homes that ap'
pealed. They put in a gas stove
as an attraction. They came into
use about 100 years ago.
We had no Fair Rents Court
then which puts the landlord in
the category of a criminal to be
taken to court by some one for
whom he has provided a roof and
thereby befriended by letting him
come into his building. This in'
terference with natural develop'
ment brought the building of
houses for renting to a standstill
and we have had a house short'
age ever since.
This Fair Rents Court at the
present time is also preventing
landlords from making their
buildings look spic and span.

Rockets were used 100 years
ago.
There was no photography
until Sir Robert Swan devised
the idea of the dry plate.
Edison 6? Swan were respom
sible for much, but not all, deveb
opments of electric lamps.
Edison had 5,000 failures and
when he was tackled about the
waste of time he said “that wasn’t
a waste of time, I know 5,000
ways of how not to do things.”
They took out 1,180 separate pat'
ents in U.S.A., including those
for radio and the cinematograph.
These were all marvellous inven'
tions, but Neville Cardus thinks
the greatest invention was the
little knob that turns the radio
off.
To be without movie pictures
could scarcely be imagined by
young people of today. Yet, fifty
or sixty years ago they did not
exist. Now, we are spending
£1,000,000,000 on entertainment
a year. Are we poor when we
can do that?
No, it was not possible to go
to the pictures fifty years ago,
but by way of diversion you
could see things in the flesh that
you now see in pictures. For in'
stance, you could see a Public
Flanging if you wanted to. I
have seen them years ago in the
garden in front of the Darling'
hurst Court House. In London
it is recorded that when the last
thief hanged on Tighes Hill was
cut down he had the Hangman’s
watch in his pocket. He stole it
in the presence of the onlookers,
but nobody saw it. They call
that “sleight of hand.”
In 1876 Bessemers Steel dis'
covery enabled us to build
bridges and structural steel build'
ings at low cost. His first dis'
covery was a failure. Many exper'
imenters had failures. One man,
who had met with failure went
to clear away the debris from a
melting pot. Instead of finding
it rusty and tarnished as usual
he found one mound of metal
was as “bright as a shilling” and
thus we got stainless steel, which
has been such a boon to house'
wives.
Fancy stopping a train within
its own length with a gust of
wind. That was George West'
inghouse’s airbrake invention.
Now they are cutting steel into
the finest shreds a millionth of an
inch thick with a gust of wind.
An X'ray invention has been
of great benefit to humanity in
the hands of the medical profes'
sion. It was discovered in 1896 —
just 64 years ago.
The electric dynamo hadn’t
been invented until 1831 and
thirteen years later Morse invent'
ed his code for communicating

Dr. Graham Bell, a teacher of

his telephone system until 1876 —
a marvellous system for releasing

Charles Goodyear, a hardware
dealer, discovered the method of
vulcanising rubber in 1839 to
keep it from becoming sticky in
the heat or brittle when exposed
to air. Later vulcanised rubber
was applied to tyres. There were
no motor cars when Goodyear
made his discovery.
The first motor cycle ever made
was by Daimler in 1884, only
years ago, although a
pennyfarthing bicycle had pre'
viously been used.
Daimler produced his first mo'
tor in 1887. Soon cars were rac'
ing along at the terrific speed of
fifteen miles an hour.
Christmas cards were coming
into use, one hundred years ago.
That lovely custom for sending
goodwill messages—now univers'

Queen Victoria.
Prior to the invention of the
sewing machine by Elias Howe,
clothes were handed down as
heirlooms and girls getting mar'
ried had to spin their own sheets
and household linens. These
Spinners were called Spinsters—
which term is still applied to
single girls.
Since the advent of the sewing
machine it is possible to buy
ready'to'wear clothing and change
our dress fashions as often as we
like, if our husband’s earnings
can keep pace with our yearnings.

J
ventions of modern vintage is
Radar, an English invention.
You will recall how, during
World War II all the German
planes, intended for the destruc'
tion of England, were brought
down over the English Channel
—lBO in one night never reach'
ed their destination. That was
through Radar. England had
just a few planes and a few skill'
ed aviators, but they rose to the
occasion. The flyers were tired
out. As fast as they brought
their machines home, the ground
Engineers would hop on to them
like a flock of bees, whilst the
aviators would sleep through all
the noise of hammering, rivet'
ting, refuelling. When it was re'
ported that German planes had
left their base (it took only eight
minutes to cross the Channel)
the aviators would be awakened
-—sometimes with hob nailed
boots. They were so tired, they
had to be “kicked into wakeful'
ness,” so it was said. They
would scramble aboard, and take
their planes out again over the
Channel.
England was never invaded.
Think of what life would be
like without a daily bath with hot
and cold water laid on, or with'
out a vacuum cleaner or a refrig'
erator. Yet they had none of
these things 100 years ago.
It was Mr, Sutcliffe Mort, of
Goldsborough Mort, who design'
ed the first freezing chamber in
Sydney in 1861 and took frozen
meat to England in 1880. When
he died he left provision for a
statue to be erected to him in his
will. It is in Macquarie Place.
If I had done as much for human'
ity as this man I would leave
enough for statues everywhere.
There was no Salvation Army
a hundred years ago. This has
ever been a marvellous organisa'
tion that took religion down to
the depraved souls and spoke
their language. I used to walk
from Glenmore Road, Padding'
ton every night through Gouh
burn Street and Pier Street, which
was then full of Chinamen, to go
to the Sydney Technical College
fifty odd years ago —a most urn
edifying route. We didn’t attend
college in the bosses’ time in
those days, and we went every
night if we were ambitious and
wanted to get on, not one or two
nights a week as now. I frequent'
ly heard The Salvationists sing
“Jesus is a Bosker, there ain’t no
flies on him. There’s flies on you
and there’s flies on me, but there
ain’t no flies on Jesus.” It shock'
ed me at the time. It sounded
like sacrilege, but it was under'
stood by those who had to listen
to it, and they got them to re'
nounce their sins and join the
Salvation Army. The means jus'
tified the end.
Analine dyes were made from
coal tar in 1856.
In those days women and child'
ren crawled on hands and knees
to pull trucks in the coal mines,
and children were sent up chim'
neys to clean them out, for no one
had thought of lengthening the
handle of a broom to rid the flue
of soot.
Our Next 100 Years.
Now, all this is instanced mere'
ly to show how far we have come
towards material comfort and en'
joyment in just over 100 years.
Sometimes I wonder what the
next one hundred years will
bring forth, with no one striving
to reach perfection. One has to
do the most to reach perfection,
not the least. We can never
achieve unless we work long and
hard. And this is precisely what
we are not doing.
(continued on page 79)
WHAT IS IT?
Time was once when it was usually possible
to gain at least some idea of the purpose of
a building from its external appearance. A
church looked like a church, a factory like a
factory, and an office building like an office
building. Today, in spite of all the cliches
of the modernists about the building experi-
encing its function without any sham or ap-
plied decoration it has become increasingly
difficult to discern just what a modern build-
ing is intended to be so that it is almost pos-
sible to say that a church can look like a
factory—as in the case of this example which
is a new Methodist Church at East London,
and which could readily be mistaken for an
electricity sub-station, a library, or a post
office. The only clue to its sacred purpose
is the cruciform sinking to the brickwork in
the campanile—which might be mistaken for
a water tower or light house.

Fortunately for development.
Chemical Engineers are not tak-
ing up that attitude. They are
achieving successes that have put
most developments of the past in
the shade, not only the Atom
bomb but the Oil Refineries, of
which Australia is to have some
soon —one for the Anglo-Iranian
Company of <£38,000,000- in
Western Australia, development
of Altona Refinery in Victoria
for £13,000,000, and one of £25,-
000,000 at Kurnell, N.S.W., for
the Caltex Oil Co., although
Parks and Playgrounds Commit-
tees and Cumberland County
Council are objecting to this
latter site, as it will interfere
with parks (that would render
a much more useful service
if placed elsewhere) and also
the flying-boat base. Fancy put-
ting the latter where a bombora,
or wind and water disturbance
takes place. It would be like put-
ting a wharf for ships in the Bay
of Biscay, which is notorious for
its storms.
But one cannot stop the pro-
gress of science with trivialities.
It would be like trying to sweep
back the tides of the ocean with
a broom. Capital can be with-
drawn from development, to our
great impoverishment and this
announcement carries a warning
not to interfere too much with
development.
In this district there are 1400
people living in “shanty town”
under conditions that should
make us blush for shame.
Homes For The Masses.
Sydney’s population is like
London’s or New York’s. It
grows with each development.
The City of Sydney proper has a
population of 211,400. The Met-
ropolitan area 1,584,830, the
County of Cumberland 1,858,-
480. These have increased by
21% in the last ten years and it
seems we are impotent to do any-
thing about coping with a house
shortage of 300,000 all over Aus-
tralia which in 1940 had 6,930,-
000 people and now has 8,430,-
446 —about a 22% increase.
We are prone to tell ourselves
we are a most progressive people
but the standard of homes we
are developing would indicate
that we are a backward race.
Some of them, but not all, are
nothing short of monotonous
look-alike dog’s boxes.
When I was in Sao Paula in
Brazil, I was impressed with the
beautiful wrought iron work on
every home. They were distinc-
tive homes, such as one could see
a few years ago going up in Wah-
roonga, Mosman or Rose Bay.
Every home was adorned with
beautiful craftsmanship the
stonemasons and the bricklayers’
work had become an art, and
then there was the ornamental
steel workers’ art, of which we
haven’t a present-day example in
Australia. These houses looked
as though somebody loved design-
ing them and building them ar-
tistically, and they looked as
though somebody loved living in
them. I don’t think our pre-fabs
will awaken any feeling of pride
on the part of the occupier in the
future.
Sao Paula isn’t the only town
in Brazil that is coping with in-
creasing population and housing
its people properly. In ten years:
Sao Paula increased by 73%
to 2,200,000.
Rio de Janeiro increased by
thirty-five per cent to 2,400,000,
Recipe by fifty-five per cent,
to 500,000,
Salvador by thirty-two per
cent, to 384,000,
Porto Alegra by forty-three
per cent, to 381,000,
Natal one hundred per cent, to
104,300,
Florianopolis ninety-five per
cent, to 48,800.
This capital city is on an island.
Here they have built a bridge
2,788 ft. long to serve this smalb
ish population whereas in Sydney
with a population four times as
great, we cannot get a second
bridge over our Harbour of much
shorter span.
England has issued 1,000,000
licences for television sets. We
haven’t issued one yet, the latest
edict is that the whole idea of in-
stallations is to be abandoned.
That doesn’t seem very progres-
sive.
Abolish Obstacles Standing
in the Light of Progress.
If I had my way, I would say
—Abolish the Fair Rents Court
and let people build beautiful
homes for selling or letting in a
competitive market, as distinct
from a curtailed market enabling
owner-occupiers alone to build
homes. Let anybody build homes
who would run the risk. It is their
own money they would be using
and not Government advances as.
at present. The Government can-
not continue to cope with such a
drain on its finances. Abolish all
the Boards that are restricting, cur-
tailing and harrassing the man op
(continued overleaf)
TRANSPARENT TABLE.
It would be an exaggeration to state that this
transparent glass table with the hole in the
middle and supported on a light iron frame
was a thing of beauty, particularly when
the various objects resting on it seem to
clash with the heavy check floor pattern.

It is time we allowed people to
plant as much as they are prepar-
ed to grow, build as many houses
as they want to build and work
as long as they want to work at
what calling they desire and for
what they are capable of earning.
To make everyone slothful by an
Act of Parliament will not pro-
gress the country very much. An
instance of retarding progress
came to my notice last week when
some hot water piping was being
lagged with asbestos. The firm’s
men were equipped with know-
ledge and materials to finish the
job for they had always done this
class of work, but the Unions
said the binding with wire was a
metal workers’ job. The firm has
been advertising for men to do
this without success. That was a
month ago. The work is still un-
done. The firm’s men are idle
and are likely to remain so. How
far will this kind of thing carry
the country along the road to
success?
We have never contributed one
whit of thought or expression of
gratitude to others who have de-
vised all the products of the last
100 years—with hot or cold water
laid on, refrigeration, telephones,
motor cars, wireless, movie pic-
tures, and countless other things.
Instead we have taken them as
a right for our personal comfort.
We all forget to say “Thank God
that men in the past were inven-
tive and diligent; that they
counted not the hours spent in
earnest endeavour in order to
achieve such things as we now
enjoy.'”
And then we should ask God
to give us health, strength, cour-
age and the desire to leave some
small thing, that we of this era
may devise for the benefit of gen-
erations yet to come.

Judge Censures Housing Camps
“LEADS TO INEVITABLE DEGRADATION.”
In a scathing indictment of emer-
gency housing settlements, Judge
Stretton, in the Melbourne General
Sessions recently, declined to sen-
tence a man living at Watsonia (Mel-
bourne) housing camp on a charge of
theft because he considered the State
had done nothing to help him become
a good citizen.
In his comments, the judge said:
“I cannot find it in myself to play
this one-sided game of punishing
people who break the rules of the
State when the State does very little
for them.
“I am not a believer in the pater-
nalism of the regulated State which
some people admire, but I feel some-
thing should be done to improve their
lot and remove them from the inevit-
able degradation which appears to
come to so many when they go to
these camps.
“If the State will not do anything
to help them, I will do nothing to
punish them.”
In evidence a detective told His
Honour that he considered the camp
“a disgrace to the community.
“The camp is the worst place I have
seen or known,” he continued. “I
have known quite decent people go to
the camp, but after some time the en-
vironment seems to affect them and
they go down hill.”
The detective said large huts in the
camp were converted to three-family
units, but were poorly looked after.
Brown paper and hessian bags parti-
tioned units. There were community
wash-houses, showers, and few drains.
“I have not seen bathrooms,” he
added.
Ban Proposed.
A move to ban erection of any more
temporary housing camps in Victoria
is to be made by the Amalgamated
Society of Carpenters and Joiners.
The Trades Hall Council executive
is to be asked to call a meeting of all
building unions with the object of im-
posing a ban on the creation of
“another Watsonia.”
Judge’s Remarks Endorsed.
The Leader of the Victorian Op-
position, Mr. Norman, in endorsing
the judge’s remarks, said he found it
very hard to disagree with him on
moral grounds.
“Watsonia camp is undoubtedly a
breeding-place for crime,” he said.
“Unless the whole question of emer-
gency housing and slum abolition is
attacked immediately from their source,
we will never overcome difficulties
brought about by environment.”
Footnote.—The remarks of the
learned judge and Mr. Norman are
equally applicable to some of N.S.W.’s
“Belsen” emergency housing settle-
ments, which are constantly in the
limelight because of criminal offences
committed by “residents.”
It is a shocking indictment on any
government that human beings should
be compelled to exist under such de-
grading conditions and that they should
be compelled to rear families amid
such hotbeds of crime.
The circumlocation of our glib poli-
ticians is wholly blameworthy for the
present housing impasse.

School Construction
Curtailed
Loan Cuts Blamed.
Commonwealth restrictions on fi'
nance for N.S.W. public works has
caused the Education Department to
cancel or defer contracts for school
buildings worth £1,750,000 now un'
der construction, Education Minister
Heffron told the Legislative Assembly
last week.
He said the Department’s approved
loan programme this year totalled £l3
million, but the Commonwealth had
allocated it only £2,500,000.
He indicated that the money avail'
able this year and the amount anti'
cipated next year would not be enough
to pay for works in hand now or ne'
cessary in the immediate future.
The Department would have to
consider retrenching some of its main'
tenance staff, Mr. Heffron said.
The Commonwealth’s “‘outrageous
and unjustified” restrictions on educa'
tion finances had compelled the Edu'
cation Department to immediately
abandon many buildings and works
already approved and marked urgent.
To cancel and repudiate many exist'
ing signed contracts for school struc'
tures.
To abandon the building of many
schools already under construction.
“Dump” tenders ready for accept'
ance.
Contracts Affected.
Mr. Heffron listed existing con'
tracts affected as including a new sec'
ondary school at Camden, extensive
additions at Bankstown North,
Coogee South, and Grafton High
School.
Also the new £280,000 boys’ high
school at Manly, where a start has
been made.
Other works under construction li'
able to deferment or cancellation in'
eluded: Brookvale, £46,843; Farrer
High, £156,901; Kingsgrove, £59,953;
Kyogle, £110,297; Liverpool, £33,844;

High, £127,775; Villawood, £69,694;
Wollongong High and Junior Tech'
nical, £233,444.
The Department would be unable
ta proceed with tenders actually ac-
cepted for school buildings at Broken
Hill High, Manly Boys’ High (elec'
trical services), Parramatta, Pennant
Hills West, Riverstone, Sydney Tech'
nical High, and Wahroonga.
Mr. Heffron sajd he would have
to hold up the calling of tenders for
plans and specifications for school
works at: Birrong, £279,880; Boor'
agul, £197,100; Cessnock High,
£127,158; Kurri Kurri, £211,200, and

ings at Hurstville for the new Sydney

Brickworks Urge
Controls Be Lifted
Over-production Danger Seen.
More than half the 28 brickworks
in Sydney are now able to give ini'
mediate delivery of common bricks or
are stockpiling them.
Faced bricks are also available for
prompt delivery to most building jobs.
It is estimated that it costs about
£lO,OOO to stack a million bricks in
the yard, so stockpiling will greatly
add to present building costs.
A representative of the industry said
that if controls were ended, clay bricks,
tiles, and other basic materials could
be used for the construction of hotels,
office blocks, factories and many other
jobs on which their use is now for'
bidden except by State Government
permit.
Brickworks Ltd. is urging the re'
moval of Government controls over
the sale of bricks because it considers
they are no longer necessary, directors
state in their report.
With the slackening in the rate of
home'building, more bricks will be'
come available for industrial and com'
mercial construction.
At the end of last year about 85
per cent, of bricks produced were ear'
marked for housing needs.
Production, turnover and profit for
the half'year to December 31 in'
creased on the corresponding period
the previous year, and all bricks manu'
factured were sold,
The report states that the interim
dividend to 5 per cent. Last year the
dividend was per cent., including

Amazes Construction Experts
SAVES TIME, LABOUR AND MONEY.
A revolutionary building technique,
known as the YoutZ'Slick lift'slab sys'
tern, is really something new in con'
struction methods, and experts have
confessed amazement at its possibilities.
Phillip Youtz, New York architect,
and Tom Slick, Texas businessman,
conceived the lift'slab system in 1948.
Since then it has been employed on
many notable U.S. buildings. Recent'
ly, the method was employed in Win'
nipeg, Canada, to construct a 24'flat,
three'Storey apartment block, 30ft.
high, 45ft. by 90ft. in floor area.
Floors Poured on Ground.
The buildings are actually construct'
ed from the ground up floor by
floor each of which is poured on
the ground and jacked into position.
In brief, the jacks—key ingredients
in the process —are licensed on a
royalty basis by the Institute of Invem
tive Research, San Antonio, Texas.
Essentially the process is this: the
concrete slabs for floors are poured on
the ground—thus eliminating necessity
for expensive formwork—then are
jacked up the columns into place. If
the Canadian cost pattern follows that
of U.S., 10 per cent, to 30 per cent,
may be saved in comparison with con'
ventional construction.
Winnipeg Building.
The “Financial Post,” Canada, in
describing the Winnipeg construction,
said:
“After the ground had been levelled
for the building, concrete foundations
for the columns were put in place,
then the columns erected. There were
eight columns, each consisting of
eight'inch steel angles welded to form
a square. Next step was to construct
the slab edge forms, providing for
stairway openings, and place the steel
lifting collars around each column.
“Two bushings, to connect the slab
to the lifting equipment, are inserted
in the collars. Then the steel rein'
forcing rods are laid and tied, the
necessary conduits and sleeves for
mechanical and electrical work placed,
and the concrete poured.
Lifting Technique.
“After 18 hours, it is possible to
apply the separating medium—in this
case, water wax—to the top of the
first slab, repeat the same operation as
before—place the collars, reinforcing
steel, etc. —and pour the second slab
on top of the first. This process is
repeated until all slabs, including the
one for the roof, are poured. Then
they are given 10 days in which to
cure.
“Next step is to set up the lifting
equipment, which consists of jacks
mounted on top of the columns by a
three'man crew. Each jack has two
rods. After these are fastened to the
collar bushings, the mechanism is
started and the slab is raised to the
desired height. At this point the cob
lar is welded to the column. Half an
hour is allowed for the welds to cool,
then the slab is released from the lift'
ing equipment and the next slab is
raised.
“The jack works in repeated strokes
of two inches. A 10'h.p. electric
motor maintains hydraulic pressure
through rubber hoses to the jack pis-
ton and to small hydraulic torque
motors which tighten nuts on the ten'
sion screws to hold the height gained
in each stroke,
“Each jack is capable of raising as
much as 100,000 lbs. and the lift can
be controlled by the operator at the
instrument panel to one-sixteenth of
an inch. Each slab weighed 240,000
lbs., and was raised at the rate of about
four feet per hour.
“The boiler roof of this amazing
Winnipeg building is on the roof. The
boiler was simply placed on top of
the slab and rode up with it.
“Some 30 feet of chimney are thus
dispensed with . Other economies are
the light curtain wall required—only
eight inches of brick—and the speed
and safety with which the various
trades can get on with their work.”
There appears to be many oppor'
tunities for introducing this revolu'
tionary “prefab.” method into Aus'
tralia, and if it could reduce local con'
struction costs 10 per cent, to even 20
per cent. (10 per cent, to 30 per cent.
is the Canadian figure), it would be
well worthwhile.
It is tragic, that few, if any, of the
construction techniques evolved over'
seas since the war have been brought
to Australia.
This one, in particular, has more
than proved itself in the U.S.A., and
must inevitably be adopted by other
nations.
PREFABS. IN LUGGAGE.
All over the world migrating
Dutchmen are taking £BOO prefab,
houses with them as luggage. Ah
though there is a limit to the amount
of money a Dutch emigrant may take
with him, there is no limit to the pro'
perty he takes.

Master Builders’ Association
Contract Form
QUESTION ASKED (AND “ANSWERED”) IN PARLIAMENT.
The McGirr Government, ever
anxious to strangle private enterprise,
loses no opportunity to decry the ef'
forts of individuals and Associations
who endeavour to maintain the high'
est possible ethics in business.
Latest of a long list of bullets fired
against Master Builders generally was
the recent outburst by Mr. W. Pooh
ey, of the Cooperative Building So'
ciety organisation (so handsomely em
dowed by a beneficient State Govern'
ment). One of these cooperative SO'
cieties is housed in an elaborate city
structure recently purchased. We
wonder where the funds for such a
purchase came from? Surely not
from the endowments received from
governments that were intended to
benefit the home purchasers, who have
placed their trust and money in build-
ing companies? If so, the Attorney-
General might be induced to make
a comment against co-operative home
building societies and with greater
justification than he made against
Master Builders.
Following Mr. Pooley’s diatribe re-
garding the Contract Forms issued by
the N.S.W. Master Builders’ Associa-
tion, the President of the M.8.A.,
Mr. C. E. Thompson, and the Presi-
dent of the Council of Suburban
M.B.A.’s, Mr. W, A. Miles, both took
him to task in no uncertain terms.
At a number of Suburban M.B.A.
general meetings, members have voic-
ed their opinion of Mr. Pooley’s state-
ments in no uncertain terms, and one
Association has taken action to de-
mand retraction of Mr. Pooley’s re-
marks.
Question in Parliament.
In State Parliament recently, Mr.
W. M. Gollan said:
“I ask the Attorney-General wheth-
er, recently, comment appeared in the
press concerning the form of con-
tract used by the Master Builders’ As-
sociation? Is it a fact that respon-
sible persons have given advice to
home-building societies and individu-
als not to use that form as it imposes
harsh terms upon those who build
houses. If these are facts, will the
Attorney-General say whether that
form of contract has been brought to
his notice and whether he will take
action to protect the public from im-
position by master builders?”
Mr. Martin: *T am familiar with
the form of contract to which the
hon. member refers, and I noticed
the comments of, I think, Mr. Pooley,
of the co-operative home building so-
ciety movement. The contract is a
harsh and most unfair one, and the
Master Builders’ Association should
be ashamed for importing into its con-
tracts terms which inflict hardship on
those who seek to build houses in
this day of acute housing shortage.
Unfortunately, there is nothing in the
law which enables me to deal with
this harsh and unconscionable type of
contract, but I wish to express, in as
strong terms as I can, my condemna-
tion of it.”
Footnote: However, it is safe to
say that the last has not been heard
of the matter by a long way.

Works Tenders
Halted
Mr. Cahill Takes Action.
The Minister for Local Government
(Mr. Cahill) has halted the call'
mg of tenders for all new public
works, because of the Federal Govern'
ment’s threat to curtail loan money
in an attempt to stop the orgy of
spending and the downhill gallop for
which the country is heading in living
beyond its income.
Mr. Cahill said he had prepared
schedules of public works with a total
expenditure of £4,700,000 for 1952'
53.
Among these were works costing
£2,700,000 to be let by contract, and
daydabour works costing £2 million.
Because the allotment for the next
financial year may be reduced to
£3,500,000 for public works, the Min'
ister said that there was no alterna'
tive but to start tapering off many
works now and stopping many works
before June 30.
This action would involve the pay'
ing off of probably 800 men, Mr.
Cahill said
Many of these men have been
working for the Department for many
years and are valuable workmen
Mr Cahill said that the works af'
fected by the proposed loan cuts
included public buildings, hospitals,
water supply and sewerage works,
harbour works, and wheat silo sub'
terminals.
Works Affected.
He informed the then Premier, Mr.
McGirr, that the loan cuts would in'
Volve the shutting'down entirely of
many works, including the following:
• Circular Quay improvements
(not the station), £160,000.

ARMY APPRENTICES STUDY BUILDING AIDS.
Among the many training innovations introduced by the Australian Army are group discussions on new techniques and scientific developments
building construction projects. Our photo shows a group of apprentices at the Army Apprentices’ School at Balcombc, Victoria,
lecture given by an officer of the Liaison Service on the use of mechanical aids on building sites. Later this group visited the
Forest Products Division and the Building Research Division of the C.S.I.R.O. The course at the Army School is the same as for civilian
technical schools, the students being thus enabled to take up their previous trades on leaving the Army.

Work will also be curtailed on the

[Perhaps the grain silos will not be
missed overmuch this year, as some
of the farmers dissatisfied with their
profitless working under government
controls will not be planting half of
what they planted 2 years ago. One
farmer who planted 10,000 acres last
year said he would only plant 1,000
acres this year. If this policy is
carried out to its logical conclusion
the question will arise as to whether
we will get controls any longer, or
bread?]

NEW ARCHITECTURE AND
ENGINEERING.
The new architecture is finding expression in
rather dramatic fashion by close collabora-
tion with the structural engineer as these
two illustrations show. On the left arc the
massive reinforced concrete foundations of
one of the great blocks of apartments erected
at Marseilles to the designs of Le Corbusier,
in which the outstanding feature is the rais-
ing of the block upon massive stilts. A
similar principle only on a much lighter
scale is seen on the right in one of the build-
ings at the Festival of Britain. That these
ideas have emulators throughout the world
is indicated by reference to the new block of
flats being erected in Sydney (see page 31)
which instead of two legs has only one row
of central supports.

Housing Commission
Flats Termed
“Fantastic”
Rentals Criticised by Expert.
The president of the N;S.W. Real
Estate Institute, when commenting
recently on construction of a £1
million block of luxury flats by the
Housing Commission, said that such
work seemed fantastic for a Govern'
ment complaining of lack of finance.
He said the flats in question, at
Milson’s Point, were only partly com'
pleted, and experts state they will
most certainly cost £1 million by the
time they are finished.
Tiny one'bedroom unfurnished flats
measuring 28 ft. by 18 ft., will cost
£3/10/0 a week and two'bedroom
flats are £4/10/0 a week. That does
not include refrigeration or hot water
services.
In these flats the kitchenette meas'
ures only 4ft. by 10ft.
“No one with a family could pos'
sibly live in them,” the Institute
president said.
“Surely people prepared to pay
these luxurious rentals would be in a
position to build for themselves,” he
added.
“At a time when the Government
is talking about having to abandon
school building works, it is spending
£1 million on these luxury flats.
“For a Government pledged to
house the average working man and
his family the expenditure of such a
colossal sum of money for a privileged
few is beyond comprehension, partic'
ularly when more urgent works of a
national character are being stopped
on account of the alleged shortage
of money.
He added, “There are flats across
the road from the Milsons Point block,
built and owned by private citizens,
which are being rented at half the
cost of the Commission flats.
Footnote: As we pointed out last
week, 40*000 people are on the wait'
ing list for Commission homes, while
3671 families are housed in temper'
ary accommodation provided by the
Commission.
Reduction of Commonwealth as'
sistance from £l4 million to £8 mil'
lion, restriction of credit for home
builders, and irksome building com
trols, make the future a very black
one for home'seekers.
From present indications, it will be
many years before the Housing Com'
mission will be able to accommodate
the evergrowing list of applicants.
[There is only one solution to a
problem like this. It is to abolish
the Fair Rents Court and let people
who would run the risk of spending
their own money on bricks and mor-
tar spend it in the way they would
like to spend it. It is not the gov-
ernment’s function to house every'
body. It can only afford to house
3671 families out of 40,000 and even
then the public money has been mis'
spent, for that was not why it was
taxed from the remainder of the
people. Under competition landlords
could do much better than £•* Hous-
ing Commission and charge less for
their rentals. They certainly won’t
build while they are faced with the
prospect of being hauled before a
court like a criminal.]

BRICK OR TIMBER.
Two of these designs are intended for execution in timber and the others in brick, though the horizontal lines
in the upper left could also suggest some type of pre-fabricated concrete wall unit. In the lower two examples,
wide plain boarding is used horizontally and vertically, thus providing a striking contrast, the horizontal treat-
ment being terminated by a low pitched tile roof, as against the other in which the vertical boards extend up-
wards to form a parapet concealing a flat roof behind. The two lower plans provide standard two-bedroom ac-
commodation, while one of the upper has three bedrooms on the one floor and the other a similar number on
the first floor.
