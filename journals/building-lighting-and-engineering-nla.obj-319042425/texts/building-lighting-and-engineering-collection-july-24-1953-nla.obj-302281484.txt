Increased steel supplies and improved plant are now
producing the greatest tonnages of Lysaght Galvanized

Did you wet that
MASONITE?
Before you nail up that
Masonite Presdwood, moisten
the back of the sheets you’re going
to use and stack them flat —back to
back for at least 24 hours.
The reason is that in the process of
converting hardwood fibres into denser-
than-wood Masonite Presdwood, moisture
is eliminated in fact, the finished
product is in its driest possible state.
Before fixing, therefore, the moisture
content of the board should be stabilised
by wetting the reverse side of the sheet.
This ensures that if the Masonite Presd-
wood is fixed to an adequate frame, it
will remain rigid . . . smooth . .
unaffected by the absorption of atmos-
pheric moisture.

GAS RANGE
Whether you buy according to the tasty meals you can cook
. . . or according to price ... or whether you're concerned with saving time and work in
cooking—a new AUTOMATIC GAS RANGE is your best proposition.
YOU'LL SAVE
.. . because a gas range costs
less than others . . . and it's
no secret that gas cooking is
cheaper.
SPEED
When you turn on a burner
you get instant heat for boil-
ing, frying, grilling, toasting,
baking, roasting.
FLEXIBILITY
At your fingertips you have
every heat from "fast boiling"
to controlled slow simmer.
EXACT CONTROL
Set the thermostat for perfect
oven cooking without any
attention.
CLEANLINESS
Smooth, rounded comers,
streamlined burner plates,
gleaming stainproof enamel
—just a wipe to keep spotless.
YOU'LL BE PROUD
TO OWN ONE
Modern automatic gas ranges
are really "show pieces" in
the kitchen. You can choose
from double oven, upright,
elevated models (complete
with cabinet if you wish).

THE H.C.S. THERMOSTAT GIVES
* Temperature Control
* Pre-Heat Control
★ Griller Control
Satchwell H.C.S. design makes installation
easy; its smart appearance helps build sales
for retailers, and its automatic control of
pre-heat, oven temperature and griller control
(all by one knob) delights the housewife.
"H.C.S." are hydraulically controlled and
particularly suitable for ovens where the
element arrangement demands flexibility
between the thermally sensitive element and
the external control knob.
Relative positions of the Satchwell "H.C.S."
phial and knob are limited only by the length
of the capillary tube.
Pilot lamps indicate when elements are carry-
ing current and when oven has reached desired
temperature, after initial heating. Oven
thermometer is unnecessary.
Temperature range of the four "H.C.S."
thermostats is 200/600 c F. The control knobs
are marked 200/550°F. Additional control
switch is unnecessary, as in the "off" position,
the contacts will not close no matter how low
the ambient temperature.
FOUR TYPES OF “HC.S.” THERMOSTATS
1. A single-stage instrument suitable for side and
bottom heat cookers.
2. A two-stage instrument for high loaded side and
bottom heat cookers, having high loadings for quick
pre-heating.
3. A three-stage instrument for top and bottom heat
cookers wherein the top elements are used for grilling
(broiling) and also quick pre-heating.
4. Three-stage instrument similar to 3 above but with
provision for additional control by time switch.

serves Trade
and Industry
A hundred years ago, ALUMINIUM was little more than a scientific curiosity.
Even half a century ago, Aluminium was still so difficult to come by that its
price placed it amongst the precious metals. To-day, the uses of aluminium
have so expanded that it is used in large tonnages by nearly all the major
industries. Now, you may ride in an aluminium railway coach, letters may be
carried in aluminium aircraft at speeds approaching the speed of sound, and
power, light, heat and air conditioning may be brought to you by means of
aluminium conductors.
To-day Aluminium is first in the non-ferrous metal groups in world production by
volume, and neither the increase in volume nor the expansion in the metal’s industrial
use show any signs of diminishing.
Y ou are invited to consider afresh how trade and industry can make use of this metal. The
solution of many complex problems has been made possible by the application of
aluminium and its alloys to an extent that almost every activity on land, sea and in
the air has in some way been speeded, lightened or beautified by this versatile metal.
The products of Aluminium Union Limited include:—
Ingots; Alloys; “Kingstrand” Aluminium Houses; Corrugated Roofing and Siding Sheet;
“Alpaste” Paint Pigment; Chemical Section; Bauxites; Alumina (Hydrate and Calcined);
Aluminium Sulphate: Aluminium Fluoride: Artifical Cryolite: Fluorspar; Magnesia.

DAVID JONES' BUILDING
MARKET AND CASTLEREAGH STREETS, SYDNEY.
TWO ADDITIONAL STOREYS.
The original section {up to and including the fifth floor)
of this building was erected in 1938; two storeys were add-
ed in 1941, and an additional two floors have just been
erected thereby completing the building and giving an ad-
ditional floor area of 46,000 square feet.
The lifts have been extended to serve these new floors—
provision fo rthis having been made by the erection of
motor room at its final height during the 1941 extension,
and these floors will be used by the company as utilities,
relieving the third and fourth floors lower down for selling
areas.
The facade has been carried out in freestone to match
the original design, the upper storey having the windows
more closely grouped than below.
The building generally also received a "refresher" for the
Company's recent I 15th Birthday and awning and shop-
fronts were reconditioned so that the whole building has
taken on a "new look."
The Company Is utilising the additional space provided
to the best advantage and they have already installed a
new butcher's shop and fruit and vegetables sections on
the lower ground floor; also a fish shop where fish meals
can also be obtained. Other new departments will be
opened progressively.
When the two additional storeys were erected in 1941
an illustration of the building was published in "Building,
Lighting, Engineering" for December, 1941.

THE STORY OF DAVID JONES
115 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT.
One hundred and sixty years ago
a young Welsh boy left his native
home and came to Australia. This
was David Jones, who later, in 1838,
when he started out for himself,
founded Sydney’s largest departmental
stores and the great business that still
proudly bears his name and celebrated
its 115th birthday on May 28th, 1953.
It all started in Wales, about 1809,
when young David Jones had dif'
ferences with his family about his urn
willingness to go to chapel every Sun'
day.
Job at 16.
So at 16 he got himself a job, in
the little general store at Llandilo.
That meant living there, too, and
it was not long before the boarder
life that opened before him led to his
going still farther afield —this time to
the country town of Carmarthen, fif'
teen miles from the farm, and there,
at the age of 18, David Jones began
to learn English.
Keen Business Instinct.
Serving behind a counter aroused a
keen business instinct in him. His
wage was small and every time he
wrapped up a yard of red flannel or a
length of dress material for one of his
master’s customers he mentally work'
ed out how much profit he would have
made if he had been proprietor.
He began to send a few things back
to his sister Mary on the farm for
her to retail to people who did not
want to be bothered with the pony'
trap ride into town.
He was fast learning the art of
giving the customer what she wanted.
It was a principle that he never depart'
ed from, and that helped to build the
great business he founded.
He finally went to London as an
assistant to a firm of wholesale drapers
at a time when £35 a year and all
found was regarded as good pay.
Came to Australia at 41.
He was 41 when a Mr. Charles
Appleton arrived in London from
Australia.
Mr, Appleton, a successful draper
in Hobart, was on the lookout for an
experienced man in the trade to join
him as partner.
David Jones was recommended to
him. He liked the quick Welshman,
put the proposition to him. It was a
big decision to make, for he had five
children and Mr. Appleton’s offer
would mean journeying to the other
side of the world. But he would be
a partner, working for himself—and
Mr. Appleton did not mind that he
had very little to put into the busi'
ness beyond keenness and hard work.
So it was settled, and a year later—
in 1835 —David Jones and his family
arrived at Semi'Circular Quay in Syd'
ney, where Appleton and Co. had a
thriving business in Pitt Street.
Business became so good that profit
was soon touching between £7OOO and
£BOOO a year.
Starts On His Own.
In April, 1938. Mr. Appleton re'
turned from another visit to England
and took exception to a letterhead
bearing the name Appleton & Jones;
he also had another bright young man
named Todd whom he had brought
out to manage the business. And so
in anger the partnership terminated
and a few days later David Jones went
into business on his own account and
opened a shop in premises known as
Jerusalem Warehouse, on the corner
of George Street and Barrack Lane.
He did well right from the start,
for people remembered his pleasant
manner, his anxiety to give the cus'
tomer what they wanted.
He bought a house, a carriage,
horses, and the two assistants helping
him at the beginning were more than
doubled, and success continued.
But in 1842 a financial panic hit
the Colony and many small shop'
keepers failed. David Jones, with most
of his money going back into his
business, was badly hit. He sold his
carriage, gave up his house, but kept
the shop open, and the crisis past,
leaving him sound and with fewer
rivals than before.
Retires and Returns.
By 1860, David Jones was ready to
retire. He had made a personal for'
tune of <£150,000 and had taken two
partners. But eight months after he
removed his drive and personality
from the George Street business it
failed, and David Jones, now 68. lost
heavily, but his eldest son, David,
came to the rescue with money earned
in pastoral interests in Queensland,
and the old Welshman came back and
took his place in the shop again. The
tremendous job of putting it back on
its feet took him eight years, but he
did it.
He died in 1873, aged 80 —but the
shop went on.
The Move to Elizabeth
Street.
The business went through another
danger period just after the Elizabeth
Street store, which cost more than
£1,000,000, opened in 1927, for people
were slow to change their shopping
habits and at first it did not pay, but
ten years after the move the total
turnover of the company was
£3,250,000 150% greater than be'
fore the ambitious move.
A Huge Organisation.
To-day, it is a huge organisation by
any standards and its turnover in one
year has reached £16,500,000, whose

NEW WARD BLOCK
HEATHERTON SANATORIUM. VICTORIA.
Percy Everett, F.R.A.I.A., Government Architect.
J. C. TAYLOR & SONS PTY. LTD., Master Builders.
MODERN SANATORIUM
Orientation played an important part in the planning of this sleek new ward building at the
Heatherton Sanatorium. In the metropolitan region of Victoria, most of the prevailing rain-bearing
winds come from a westerly source—those from the south-west being usually accompanied by moist
conditions. The balconies for bed patients were therefore planned to the leeward, while the service
corridors are on the windward or western side. The chevron shape of the ward blocks offer still
further wind and rain protection to patients than the longitudinal due eastern aspect afforded.
The nurses' station and inquiries are centrally located, with extensive view range of patients' beds on
either wing. Servery kitchens and elevators are also central. The bathrooms, lavatories and solaria
are placed at the extreme ends of the balconies. The reinforced concrete ward blocks are entirely
enclosed with fly and mosquito screens. The stanchions—being painted a very dark green—are
hardly visible.

The Rhodes
Centenary
Life and Work of Remarkable Man.
The Rhodes Centenary Exhibition
that was opened on Saturday last
(July 4) at Bulawayo by the Queen
Mother draws attention to the life and
achievements of a truly remarkable
man.
Cecil john Rhodes was born on
July 5, 1853, and after a life spent bat-
tling against indifferent health he died
at the age of 49, yet in that short space
of time he transformed the face of
Africa and has, through the Rhodes
Scholarships left his name forever
linked with the development of the
British Empire and Commonwealth.
Cecil Rhodes was the last and one
of the greatest of Empire-builders; a
man of remarkable vision and con-
suming energy—for he knew his time
was short —a financial genius and an
astute politician. The son of an Eng-
lish clergyman, sick, penniless and
without influence he went to Africa
and through the Kimberley diamond
discovery he laid the foundations of
a vast fortune before he was twenty.
He entered the Cape Parliament at 27,
formed the great De Beers Consoli-
dated (Diamond Mining) Company
at 35, and became Premier of the
Cape at 37.
In the intervals of making money
and helping to make laws, he had tak-
en his degree at Oriel College, Ox-
ford, secured the annexation of Bas-
tutoland, and gained Bechuanaland for
Britain.
His life was a turbulent one as he
made his mistakes but he also achiev-
ed great things and the good that he
did lives after him in the great coun-
try of Rhodesia and in the Rhodes
Scholarships which has bestowed a
great and perpetual educational heri-
tage upon the English-speaking world.
Surely this bestowal of his generosity
upon “English-speaking” people was
yet another example of his vision for
he did not know that Britisher and
American were to fight side by side in
two world wars.
He died on March 26, 1902, and
was buried in the place of his choos-
ing—a high, rock-strewn point in the
Matoppos, near Bulawayo.
The present exhibition opened by
the Mother of our Queen is a fitting
tribute to a great Englishman who
saw far beyond the confines of his
native island.
FLATS BUILT ON “STILTS”
“THE CHILTERNS" IS CERTAINLY UNUSUAL!
“The Chilterns,” a three-storey
block of six home-units at Rose Bay,
comprises a building set on a canti-
levered concrete slab which is poised
on massive oval-shaped piers or, as
passers-by have called them “stilts.”
The architect. Mr. D. Forsyth
Evans, says the design is an adapta-
tion of a principle introduced by the
famous French architect, Le Corbusier,
and judging by the architectural books
from abroad it seems to be having a
vogue at present in Europe and South
America.
Through the massive piers run the
connecting steel framework that ties
the building to the underground foun-
dations and also the service pipes
and wires in a specially provided rect-
angular conduit.
The area below the cantilevered
floor serves as an easily accessible
parking space for cars, and an ideal
wet-weather playground for children
of the flat-owners.
The whole of the exterior wall i«
of glass, that on the sunny side being
of various coloured panes which can
be given different treatment within
each home unit.
UNUSUAL DESIGN OF ROSE BAY FLATS
This building is the only one of its kind in Australia, it not in the world. At first
glance resembling a house built up-side-down, the structure stands on five oval-
shaped piers. Ugly posts carrying overhead wires detract from the scene all
along this interesting New South Head Road, in which the greatest number of
architectural styles, fads, and fancies abound. There is scarcely a home along its
length of which one cannot remark with justification about some detail or other:
"Isn't it queer?" But the comment regarding the latest building to be added to
the already infinite variety: 'Isn't it queer when a house is built with the chim-
neys stuck into the ground!" But no matter how facetious the comment, the
building remains "structurally sound" from every engineering standard.

Queensland Government Tourist Bureau
ATTRACTIVE NEW SYDNEY CENTRE.
Sunshine and Brighntess.
Queensland is known throughout the
world for its sunshine, tropical fruits,
Barrier Reef and friendliness.
It is these salient characteristics of
sunshine and brightness that have
been the guiding theme of Frank R.
Fox in designing the new Tourist
Bureau in King Street, Sydney, for
the Queensland Government.
The illusion of the sun’s brightness
overhead has been achieved by the
use of intensive fluorescent lighting.
the majority of which are installed in
the continuation of the awning that
extends as a central canopy through
th? entire length of the interior, thus
creating a second ceiling effect some
five feet below the main ceiling; it
also serves the utilitarian function of
housing the ventilation ductwork and
the fluorescent light fittings, all of
which are screened with prismatic
plastic.
The inclusion of this ceiling treat'
ment gives an immense feeling of
space, so any additional lighting above
was purposely eliminated so as to
throw the main acoustic ceiling above
into a semi'shadowed effect.
The panelling to the walls is all of
specially selected Queensland maple
and silver ash. The glassdouvred
panels in the partitions, used to ac'
centuate the tropical atmosphere, were
sandblasted before painting white, as
this prevents the paint being chipped
off and also gives a good finish.
The flower boxes at the entrance,
planted with selected tropical shrubs,
also add to the tropical atmosphere.
Staggered Counter.
The main counter, “staggered” in
plan, gives a sectionalised effect rather
than one long, straight counter. The
public’s counter top is separate from
the staff’s top, which is at a lower
level and is proving very satisfactory.
Glass'panelled divisions have sandblast'
ed coats of arms in each of the four
panels.
An interesting note is that the
finger pulls in the sliding door panels
are approximately of two inch
diameter, backed with Formica, which
thus does not show scratch marks and
adds an interesting colour note as well.
The visual front to the Bureau is a
complete departure as far as Govern'
ment buildings are concerned and adds
greatly to the illusion of space.
Attractive Colour Scheme.
The coat'of'arms of Queensland, set
in terrazzo just inside the main em
trance, is quite an attraction and
beautifully executed. The floor is
diagonally designed and accentuated
by naturally green strips against the
buff'coloured tiles, while the yellow
plastic'covered Dunlopillo seat reflects
the main yellow treatment of the cem
tral awning colour. This central
feature runs right through from the
kerb line, starting from an upward
curve which supports a delightful
metal coat'of'arms of the State of
Queensland. The enamelised yellow
door, push'bars and the lower portion
of the back fittings behind the main
counter break up the natural honey
co 1r )i i r of the maple. The red waif —
called the new coronation red, which
was specially mixed for the job— acts
as a complete background for the
whole colour scheme.
THE DECORATIVE MURALS.
The whole of the upper portion of the wall behind the counter is taken up by a
series of modern murals by Melville Hayson and Patricia McFarlane, featuring
Queensland flora and fauna as appealing to the tourist.

“Made to Measure”
Furniture.
All furniture, in Queensland maple,
was especially designed for each mem'
her of the staff to suit his or her re-
quirements and is supported on a
diameter tubular copper frames.
The internal display window gives
the Bureau an opportunity to continue
to hold the interest of the public in'
side the office after they have entered
from viewing the main display window
areas.
The interviewing tables behind the
main counter have proved most sue'
cessful, as often clients call into the
Bureau requesting information regard'
ing an extensive tour and the Staff
can now invite them to sit down at
the comfortable tables to discuss de'
tails instead of standing at the counter.
Colourful Murals.
The murals are designed to convey
to the public the spirit of Queensland
and the holiday potential of that State.
The colour and design were all work'
ed out in conjunction with the de'
signer and artists Melville Haysom
and Patricia McFarlane —as a team,
and all authentic detail was first com-
piled before the final application to
the panel so as to ensure that any in'
terpretation of tropical shrub, fern,
coral, fish, etc., are authentic, although
applied in a modern manner.
These murals, which give atmos'
phere, have created considerable in'
terest.
The large floodlighted sign above
the Surrey Hotel, adjacent to the
Bureau at the corner of Castlereagh
and King Streets, that occupies both
walls, covering nine floors, is the
largest in the Southern Hemisphere
and was designed to comply with the -
general dramatic colours of the Bureau
and its promoters feel that it also gives
a very strong message as to the tourist
attraction of the Sunshine State.
The following subcontractors were
connected with the work:—Shop
frontage, awning and metal letters:

fittings: Sparkes & Colquhoun; marble

DEATH OF COL. J. H. HURST.
Former Architects’ Secretary.
The death occurred on July 7 of
Col. J. H. Hurst at the age of 83.
Colonel Hurst, who served with dis-

a military family and was brotherum
law to General Sir Talbot Hobbs,
—welhknown architect—miltary figure
in Western Australia, with whom he
was in practice in Perth about the be'
ginning of the century. He came to
Sydney in 1905 and after the first war
became Secretary of the Institute of
Architects of N.S.W., a position which
he held for many years.
Col. Hurst had a pleasant bluff and
cheery personality and was liked by all
who knew him. Of recent years he
has not been active in the profession.
NEW WOOL STORE FOR BRISBANE

A fine new building has recently
been completed for the Queensland
Primary Producers’ Co-operative As-
sociation at the corner of Skyring Ter-
race and Helent Street, Bulimba, Bris-
bane.
Taking advantage of the improved
supplies of timber, the two upper
floors of this building are of kiln-
dried hardwood, and for the purpose
of displaying bales of wool awaiting
classing it is claimed that no better
floor can be found in Australia. The
ground floor of this three-storeyed
brick building is of concrete, which
carries the structural timbers of a
building which is 114 ft. x 165 ft., the
latter being the frontage to the rail-
way, which serves the many wool
stores at Bulimba West. The whole
of this length of 165 ft. to the railway
rolling stock is served by eleven roll-
ing shutters. In these riverside build-
ing allotments much care has to be
exercised in the foundations, and in
this construction it was found that
a wide spread of the foundations met
the requirements fully.

Proof of the ability of Australian
equipment for any purpose is seen in

At its Newmarket Brickyard Clark
Clipper Fork Trucks handle the total
output of the yard.
The Clippers, each with a capacity
of 200 lb., and with 6ft. lift height,
can quickly move their loads around
the big plant.
With their short masts and low
overall width, the Clippers can enter
the kilns as soon as they are opened,
and can move easily in the restricted
space.
The bricks are built up in standard
stacks at that spot and are not touch-
ed by hand until they arrive at a
building site.
LURE OF OUTDOOR LIVING.
Trend in Australia.
More and more, Australians are
succumbing to the lure of outdoor
living, long an integral part of the
American way of life.
New homes are being built across
Australia, in which the trend to use
terraces as part of the living environ-
ment can be clearly seen.
Other architectural features suggest
change and movement, too, as the
ideal Australian home comes into be-
ing.
Our illustration depicts a facet of
the American love of outdoors. Spot-
lights on the pine overhang of this
home can be turned in to light the

The transformation of a single'storey
brick school into a modern structure
with all amenities, has created consid'
erable interest in the architectural pro'
fession and building industry.
The alterations and additions to
St. Michael’s R.C. Convent School in
Longueville Road, Lane Cove, were
designed by Messrs. Gibbons, Higgin
and Gibbons, Architects. The engin'
eers for the project were Messrs. Ton'
nison and McCurdie. and the work
was carried out by Mr. W. G. Hut'
chinson. Master Builder, of Pymble.
The original building was a one'
storey brick school, and the new struc'
ture was actually built over and
around it, with another storey added.
To carry out the job, the builders
removed the roof, knocked out the
existing windows, and enlarged the
openings to take new frames.
The building is basically construct'
ed of steel and concrete, the floor of
the additional storey being of reinforc'
ed concrete, and the colonnade com'
prises 7in. steel pipes (see illustra'
tion).
New Features.
The ground floor area, 60ft. by 30
ft., became the Kindergarten, and
also under the one roof is the toilet
amenities block.
The classrooms are on the top floor,
which also includes the domestic
science block, laundry block, and
other amenities.
The new school is equipped with
the latest'type sound system, and total
indirect light has been installed
throughout, which eliminates any
semblance of shadow in any part of
the classrooms.
The special satin'finish light fittings
were designed by the architects, to
ensure the maximum lighting for both
teachers and pupils.
The architects endeavoured to keep
the design and plan of the school as
simple as possible and treated the pro'
ject as a series of basic units, particu'
larly in regard to the specially-design'
ed schoolroom furniture which is
standard throughout the school.
The rooms are insulated to a great
extent by the use of acoustic tile be'
tween different classrooms and the
extensive use of Canite tiles.
Each of the classrooms are finished
in a different colour so that the child'
ren may experience a physcological
sensation of progress from one year
to the next. [Which is the highest
colour?—Ed.}
The new school comprises four sec'
tions; kindergarten, primary, second'
ary, and domestic science, and this
section has the most modern domestic
equipment obtainable.
The school also has an up'to'date
pottery kiln, in which decorative pot'
tery is finished by the pupils.
Basically, the architects have made
the structure very simple, and have
repeated the windows and doors
throughout as a similar pattern, which
feature also assisted to considerably
reduce costs.
The building is fitted with hopper'
type casement windows. The outside
walls are of cement'rendered brick'
work to bring them into conformity
with the rest of the building.
The walls are finished light grey
with white trimmings.
The doors, painted a fairly deep
blue, contrast pleasingly with the rest
of the surroundings.
This firm of young architects has
been engaged to design another
school on the North Shore which,
they say, will incorporate many new
ideas.

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust. - N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on 2nd July,
1953, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr, G. C. T. Brown,
and 53 members and visitors were
present. Minutes of the General Meet'
ing held on 4th June, 1953, were taken
as read and confirmed.
Report from Council.
The President reported that
National Council had approved of Mr.
D. V. Isaacs becoming an Affiliate and
Mr. M. Craker becoming a Full Mem'
ber of the Society.
The President reminded members
that the closing date for entries for
the 1953 Award for Commercial
Lighting was the 31st instant.
Mr. Brown further reported that
arrangements had been made to show
the I.E.S. Lighting Exhibit at the
Hawkesbury Agricultural College from
the 14th to the 17th of this month.
He informed the meeting that the
services of several demonstrators were
needed to operate the exhibit at the
various sessions and invited any mem'
bers able to assist in this way to leave
their names either with him or the
Hon. Technical Secretary, Mr.
McCourt.
Next Meeting.
The subject for the August Meet'
ing of the Society will be entitled
“The Development of the Fluorescent
Lamp,” Speaker: Dr. A. Dresler.
Subject for the Evening.
The President announced the sub'
ject for the evening, “Light and Road
Safety,” and introduced the speakers,
namely:
Inspector Sherwood, representing
The N.S.W. Police Department; Mr.
Peach, representing The Department
of Motor Transport, N.S.W.; Colonel
Youden, representing The Road Safety
Council, N.S.W.; Mr. Napthali, repre'
senting the N.R.M.A.; Mr. H. G.
Fallon and Mr. Court, of the I.E.S.
Vote of Thanks.
At the conclusion of the symposium
the President called on Mr. J. Knight
to propose the vote of thanks. Mr.
Knight said that it was very interesting
to hear the views on Light and Road
Safety from the representatives of
those people most concerned, namely,
the users of the roads.
In commening on various aspects
of the problems, Mr. Knight mention'
ed that there were two factors con'
cerned, namely, the light from the
fixed street lights and the light from
motor vehicle headlights. An addb
tional factor in many cases was the
background against which objects or
obstructions were seen by the drivers
of vehicles.
Mr. Knight mentioned his own ex'
perience of the tests carried out on
motor vehicle headlights when it was
found that the upper beam could be
adjusted to comply with the regula'
tions, but in most cases such adjust'
ment rendered the lower beam useless.
The only solution was the production
of better headlight bulbs, which would
allow the regulation to be met.
He also mentioned the proposal to
enforce the requirements of the Street'
lighting Code with financial assistance
from the State Government, and con'
sidered such measures would be of
great assistance to street lighting in
this State.
In commenting on the samples of
new materials for road signs exhibited
by Mr. Peach, Mr. Knight asked if
there was any similarity between
these and the new advertising signs
which had appeared on trams recently.
In proposing the vote of thanks to
the speakers, Mr. Knight paid special
tribute to the work of Colonel
Youden on the Road Safety Council,
with which body Mr. Knight had been
associated for a number of years.
The vote of thanks was carried with
acclamation.
LIGHT AND ROAD SAFETY
Series of Six Addresses Given Before The Illuminating Engineering Society
of Australia—N.S.W.—on July 2nd, 1953.
Introduction by T. H. McCOURT, H.I.E.S. (Aust.).
The subject of light and road safety
is one which is of the utmost impor-
tance to every road user. Considera'
tion has to be given to the safety and
convenience not only of the driver of
a vehicle but also the drivers of on'
coming traffic and pedestrians. The
prominence given to road safety cam'
paigns in recent years is indicative of
the importance of this subject to the
general public, and for this reason we
have with us tomight representatives
of the Police Department, the Road
Safety Council of New South Wales,
the Department of Motor Transport,
and the N.R.M.A.
We have three light sources to con'
sider, as follows:
(1) Street lights;
(2) The headlights of the car;
(3) The headlights of oncoming
traffic.
Our aim is to discuss the difficulties
associated with achieving road safety
by means of these three sources, and
to this end our four guest speakers
will outline some of the problems met
with. Mr. Fallon and myself, at the
conclusion of their addresses, will em
deavour to present to you means
of overcoming existing difficulties.
Without further preamble it is my
pleasure to introduce to you Inspector
Sherwood, of the N.S.W. Police De'
partment, who will now address you
on this subject.
(1) INSPECTOR M. R.
SHERWOOD,
N.S.W. Police.
Modern civilisation demands that
many functions be carried on at night
as well as day, particularly our various
forms of transport, and to enable this
to be done we must, of course, resort
to the use of artificial lighting in its
many forms. We as a Department
have a very great interest in all forms
of street and vehicular lighting and
its effect upon safety generally. We
are charged by statute with the re'
sponsibility of controlling all forms of
street traffic within this State, and, as
the safety factor is so interwoven with
effective illumination, I appreciate the
opportunity that you have afforded me
this evening to place before you some
of the problems which give us com
cern.
Two Phases of Lighting.
Two phases of lighting are of par'
ticular interest to us. Firstly, the light'
ing displayed upon and projected from
motor vehicles, and secondly, street
illumination and its effect upon safety.
In this category, pedestrian safety
takes pride of place. It will be ap'
preciated that the pedestrian is par'
ticularly vulnerable. He is obliged to
cross busy thoroughfares and, having
no physical protection, he is exposed
30

to all hazards which are inseparable
from fast-moving traffic. The fact has
been established that he is exposed to
greatest danger during hours of dark-
ness. An interesting fact emerges
from the study of accident statistics
during the year just closed, i.e.,
31/12/’52. Persons killed or injured
on the roads of this State, inclusive of
pedestrians, totalled 13,256. and 52%
of such fatalities and injuries occurred
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., a period
in which, by comparison with the day-
light movement, traffic is particularly
light. This increase applied equally
to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
The following comparative figures
will be of interest in that they clearly
show the adverse effect that short days
and long nights have upon pedestrian
safety. In the half-year ending March,
50 pedestrians were killed between 6
a.m. and 6 p.m., whilst 37 were killed
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
During the half-year ended Septem-
ber 30th, the figures were 59 killed
between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. and 81
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Thus it
will be seen that during the period
31st October to the end of March the
total of pedestrians killed was 87. But
what a different story during the other
half of the year, Ist April to the end
of August; in that period no less than
140 pedestrians were killed upon the
public streets of this State,
There is no reason to assume that
the average motorist does not exercise
the same degree of care at night which
he observed in the daytime, nor could
that be said of the pedestrian; con-
sequently, the natural assumption is
that the motorist was, for varying
reasons, unable to see and anticipate
danger during such periods. This has
a most adverse effect upon pedestrian
safety. The figures I have quoted
speak for themselves.
Where Responsibility Rests.
It will be appreciated that the re-
sponsibility for pedestrian safety rests
in the final analysis with the motorist.
He has the control of a machine which
can become, if improperly used, a
lethal weapon. The motorist is a
qualified person and it is to him that
we must look for pedestrian safety,
because our roads are open for use
by all kinds and classes of pedestrians,
the extremely old or young, the halt,
the lame, the blind, those who are not
bright mentally or who for varying
reasons might be sub-normal and who
are unable to appreciate danger.
Having placed that heavy obligation
upon a motorist, it naturally follows
that we should do everything in our
power to render his task less difficult.
This brings us to the all-important
question of street lighting and to what
degree it is effective. In this direction
our aim should be to produce a degree
of illumination as near as possible to
that of daylight. How this is to’be
done is a matter that must of neces-
sity rest with you gentlemen as illu-
minating engineers.
There are large cities in the world,
notably London and New York, where
this has been achieved to a degree
where the use of motor vehicle head-
lights is considered unnecessary and
where vehicles are driven on parking
and rear lights only. The advantages
of such conditions are so obvious as
to render extensive comment super-
fluous. Suffice to say that the adverse
effects upon the vision of every road
user, resulting from headlight glare in
its many forms, is eliminated. This
is particularly important from the
pedestrian angle—he can see and be
seen; so, too, can the crossing in which
he moves.
In Sydney, however, we have not
reached that happy state, consequently
the retention of motor vehicle head-
lights with all their present short-
comings is still necessary. Apart from
some of our centre city streets, illu-
mination is excellent, much of it aris-
ing from shop windows; our street
lighting, particularly in suburban areas,
is totally inadequate to provide a de-
gree of illumination that would permit
the London or New York methods to
be adopted here.
I can readily appreciate the diffi-
culties that have to be overcome, par-
ticularly the financial stability of the
suburban councils, who are obliged to
pay for the lighting. However, it may
be possible to define a zone where this
would be practicable, in broad outline
—say, from Broadway to Darlinghurst,
King's Cross, inner City and the Syd-
ney Harbour Bridge.
This factor also vitally affects the
Constable on point duty. Overhead
street lighting does not provide suffi-
cient illumination to render him
visible to drivers confronted with the
glare of approaching headlights; this
applies particularly to positions on
crests of hills.
Type of Headlights.
Under existing conditions it is
necessary that motor vehicles should
be equipped with headlights which,
when on the low beam, will illuminate
and render easily distinguishable a
pedestrian at a distance of 150 feet.
At the same time the upper beam of
the headlights must not be higher
than the centre of the lamp at a dis-
tance of 75 feet. Herein lies our dif-
ficulty : we feel that the minimum of
150 feet illumination distance is neces-
sary to ensure a reasonable degree of
safety.
Over recent years I supervised the
testing of the lights on several thou-
sand motor vehicles and those tests
disclosed the fact that a very small
percentage of car lights complied with
the requirements of the Regulations,
particularly in respect of the lower and
upper beam. The governing factor,
of course, is the distance between the
filaments in the lamp globe. Various
reasons have been submitted to me to
account for the manufacturer’s failure
to produce a dual filament that will
permit the projection of an upper and
lower beam that will comply with the
requirements of the Regulations. How'
ever, whether these difficulties are in-
surmountable or not is a matter that
would be known best to you gentle-
men.
The problem from our point of
view is very real. We consider that
the light projected by the upper beam
should conform to the Regulations,
whilst we feel that compliance with
the requirements on the lower beam
is necessary to ensure a reasonable de-
gree of pedestrian safety. To support
this contention, I submit the follow-
ing observations.
Many drivers in outer suburban
areas drive at speeds of 40 m.p.h. and
upwards. The driver perception reac-
tion period in urban areas has been
fixed by the American Association of
State Highway officials at periods of
| to 1 second. This is the period that
must of necessity elapse between the
time at which a driver perceives a
hazard requiring brake application
and such driver being able to bring
his brakes into effective operation. It
is a proven fact that while the per-
ception period varies little with age,
the muscular reaction period increases
with advancing years, so that many

licence holders might take a period in
excess of one second. However, take
what might be the best possible figure
of two'thirds of a second and we find
that at 40 m.p.h. a vehicle will cover
approximately 40 feet during such
periods. Add to this the stopping
distance, and here we must consider
the older vehicle whose braking effi'
ciency still complies with the law but
which at that speed cannot be stop'
ped in less than 100 feet. Take the
older driver and the older vehicle,
both of which have a legitimate right
on the road, and it must be conceded
that there is no margin of safety in an
illumination distance of 150 feet. This
is a field, gentlemen, in which you
may be able to produce a solution for
our problem.
(2) Mr. H. A. PEACH,
Department of Motor Transport.
It is now well-recognised throughout
the world that a three-pronged attack
on the problem of road safety is called
for, and it has been describe das the
three “E’s” i.e., “Enforcement,”
“Education” and “Engineering”
and no doubt the other speakers to-
night will have something to say on
these subjects.
My own particular interest is that
of engineering, but without the close
co-operation of those concerned with
the other aspects of road safety, the
desired results cannot, of course, be
achieved.
As long ago as 1938, street lighting
was called upon to bear its part in
defining the limits of “Built-up” areas
where a SO-miles-an-hour speed was to
be applied, and the better those areas
are street lighted the more easily can
motorists determine what is expected
of them in the way of regulating the
speed of their vehicles.
In the sign-posting of built-up areas,
I have travelled many thousands of
miles in the country districts of New
South Wales and one of my chief
recollections is the varying standards
of street lighting ranging from 40
watt lamps strung out at considerable
distances along roads of indifferent
construction to the high standard of
mercury vapour lighting seen on such
important roads as Parramatta Road.
Nevertheless, under the speed limit
legislation, both standards are accep-
table.
It is generally recognised that the
risk of accident is greater at night,
and I think the conclusion that can
fairly be drawn is that, in many cases,
inadequate standard of street lighting
is a major contributory factor. It,
therefore, follows that the more nearly
the lighting on the roads approaches
that of daylight, the less accidents are
likely to happen.
Type of Street Lighting.
Whether it is technically possible
to provide street lighting of uniform
intensity, that is without glare and
which closely simulates daylight con-
ditions, is an aspect that might be
covered by other speakers; but even
if it is possible, the question of cost
comes into the picture, and whether
any street-lighting authority could af-
ford to provide such a high standard
of lighting on its roads is prob-
lematical.
Personally, I feel that for economic
reasons alone streets will continue to
be lighted for some time to come by
units which give a patterned effect on
the roadway and do not enable drivers
to see nearly as well as they imagine
they can.
My Department is not infrequently
called upon to investigate locations
where accidents are happening at
night, and when it is felt that the
street lighting is a factor we enlist
the help of the Lighting Authorities.
I should like to take this opportunity
of acknowledging the many times
they have so willingly given of their
time and their experience to assist in
whatever way possible.
At many locations it has been found
that owing to the absence of a suit-
able background, against which a
pedestrian is silhouetted, drivers have
extreme difficulty in detecting any
pedestrian movement; a fact which is
not always appreciated by either the
pedestrian or driver. For the same
reason a bend in an apparently well-
lighted road cannot readily be seen
because it occurs on the crest of a
hill with the dark night sky as the
only background. There is also the
difficulty of making the traffic con-
stable doing point duty at busy inter-
sections easily seen after dark. On
occasions such as this I feel that the
problem is one for the Illuminating
Engineer.
I have, of course, only touched on
a few of the aspects of road safety on
street-lighted areas, and there are
thousands of miles of road in this
State where drivers have to rely en-
tirely on the headlights of their own
vehicles to see the hazard ahead.
Speed of Traffic.
It is generally accepted that where
the road construction permits, the
speed of traffic on unlighted roads at
night is usually high, and efforts have
been directed by the Road Authorities
to enable drivers to detect potential
hazards in sufficient time to avoid
accidents. Centre lines, guide posts,
warning signs have been provided,
but when signs were first installed they
could only be seen at relatively short
distances with the help of the car
headlights. In the interests of safety
it became necessary to make them
more readily seen, and the now fami-
liar glass reflectors came into use.
Side by side with advances in the
technique of signposting came the
need to standardise so that drivers
would be told the same story in the
same way at locations which present
the same hazard. Nowadays, round
signs convey Police messages, yellow
diamonds are warning signs, and white
rectangular shapes are for information
signs.
The use of “cats-eye” reflectors
present certain difficulties, and during
the last few years methods have been
developed for reflectorising the whole
surface of the signplate.
Those of you who travel by road
between Roseville and the northern
beaches over the Roseville Bridge will
no doubt have seen samples of this
type of material on road warning
signs which are being subjected to
weathering tests. Some of these pro-
ducts have come from America, others
are local products.
The reflective material consists of a
film of minute glass spheres of uni'
form size applied to the sign so that
a specific optical system is developed.
Overseas, where this material is in
considerable demand, it has been pos-
sible to produce reflectorised material
with special characteristics to suit dif-
ferent uses. One of these will reflect
the light from the car headlamps
directly back to the driver and give
a high intensity of reflection within
a comparatively narrow beam of re-
flected light. Another will give such
a wide beam of reflection that whilst
the unit brightness is fairly low, the
sign can be seen when it is turned at
almost side on to the incident light.
With a view to establishing stan-
dards for the optical performance of
such reflective sheeting, specifications
are now being drafted by the Stan-
dards Association of Australia and
special equipment has been developed
at the National Standards Laboratory
to determine the optical properties of
the various types of reflectors.
Lighting Hazards.
It is not generally recognised that
different forms of lighting under cer-
tain conditions can also create hazards.
One instance is when mercury vapour
lighting under certain atmospheric
conditions takes on a greenish appear-
ance which can and has actually been
mistaken for a railway signal. Another
is when advertising signs employing
the colours red, green and amber are
displayed in close proximity to traffic
signal installations are taken for signal
indications. It is also possible for il-
luminated advertising signs, when in-
stalled at certain locations, to distract
a driver’s attention and create a hazard.
Cases of this kind can now be dealt

with under the Traffic Safety (Lights
and Hoardings) Act, 1951, which
permits statutory authorities to order
the removal of the offending sign.
In the short time which has been
allotted to me, I have only been able
to touch briefly on some of the broader
aspects of lighting on the roads, but
I think you will agree that there is
no easy path to road safety and that
a co-operative effort on the part of
all concerned is necessary if any worth-
while impact is to be made on the
problem.
(3) COLONEL YOUDEN,
General Secretary, Road Safety
Council of N.S.W.
No one will deny the fact that in'
adequate street lighting is a contribut'
ing factor of many road accidents, and
records in this State indicate that dur'
ing 1952 there was a total of 447
night road accidents, some of which
could be attributable to inadequate
street illumination. Some lights had
failed, but it would be difficult to
pinpoint any actual fault with such
lighting.
On looking into the question of
street lighting and road accidents, it
is interesting to find that in Canada
some 100 towns of varying sizes were
requested to submit their views on the
subject.
All expressed the opinion that
modern lighting had, or would elimi'
nate many accidents in their areas. It
was estimated that in some munici'
palities the reduction in accidents due
to improved lighting could be placed
as high as 75%. The most conserva'
tive estimate, however, was 20%,
while the average reduction in them
all was 45%.
Because public lighting is adminis'
tered throughout this State by dif'
ferent local authorities, the lighting
on onr main traffic arteries is often
uneven. It is well-known and agreed
that an appro uiate standard of light-
ing should be installed throughout a
particular highway, but this presents
some difficulty in view of the fact that
the road may pass through areas un-
der the jurisdiction of various bodies.
Again, local authorities may have
different ideas in such matters as
mounting height, and general layout
causing road users unnecessary con-
fusion. It is important that there
should be the closest co-operation be-
tween the authorities in order that
lighting throughout may be adequate
and also reasonably uniform.
The technology of street lighting
has made great strides in recent years
—oils, gas, electricity—and the neces-
sary density of fast-moving traffic has
stimulated intensive study on the sub'
ject, and our Lighting Engineers have
designed still more effective equip'
ment.
Street Lighting Factors.
In examining the merits of any
form of street lighting, the following
factors should be borne in mind:
(a) Reflector characteristics of road
surfaces;
(b) Number of lighting points per
unit length of road;
(c) Lantern performance.
These three factors combine to
build up a pattern of road brightness
observable to the road user and vary'
ing with his position. It is on this
quality of brightness pattern and on
the flux from the lantern falling direct'
ly on the observer’s eye that the
visibility depends. An important con'
sideration in street lighting is the de'
gree of the reflection of light by road
surface. As the characteristics of
roads differ so widely, it is difficult to
make a close estimate of the luminous
output required to light them. It
doesn’t follow that the lantern with
the biggest light out'put will provide
the best illumination.
A well'designed street lighting in'
stallation should provide:
1. For the convenience and safety
of road users;
2. For police purposes;

While the discussion about the Elizabeth Street extension in Sydney is going on,
it is opportune to show what a neighbouring State has done to cope with one of
its problems. Six months ago the Commonwealth Works Department had to quit
its city buildings in Melbourne and decided to go into the suburbs. The above

uled by 30th June. As a post-war construction, it is one of the largest yet. The

3. For the convenience of residents
and
4. In special purposes, such as in'
creasing the attractiveness of a
shopping centre or emphasising
the importance of a civic centre.
The standard of lighting on main
routes should provide an ample mar'
gin of safety for all road users, with'
out the use of headlights on motor
vehicles.
In built'up areas this may be inter'
preted to mean that when driving at
30 m.p.h. without headlights the driver
can see the track ahead clearly defined
and the lighting must reveal any ob'
ject on or about to enter or leave the
track in sufficient time for the driver
to take appropriate action.
Dealing with the condition of see'
in, objects in a street are seen in sil'
houette. The darker they appear
against a bright background the more
readily they can be seen. Good light'
ing ensures that objects on the road
appear as black as possible against a
bright background. Danger is created
when a stationary or moving object
appears to merge into the background
and to remain so merged for an ap'
preciable period. Objects may be sib
houetted against footpaths, adjacent
buildings, fences and the like, which
clearly shows that there is an obvious
advantage in rendering backgrounds
light in colour.
The efficiency of the various types
of lights at present in use I must leave
to the experts to decide, but it is
abundantly clear that with suitably
lighted streets and highways our accb
dent figures should show a marked
decrease. In London, I understand,
fluorescent lighting is used extensively
and has proved highly successful, and
perhaps at some not tooffar'distant date
similar lighting may be adopted here
if considered advisable.

M.I.E. (A.D.),
Chief Engineer, N.R.M.A., N.S.W.
It is doubtful whether any factor
in the achievement of safety on the
roads, and pleasurable motoring, ex'
ceeds in importance that of efficient
lighting and good vision. Yet in this
age, with 50 years of motoring ex'
perience, we are still experimenting,
probing for the ideal vehicle lighting,
without common agreement upon cer-
tain basic points.
The 1952 series of headlight tests
carried out by the Police Traffic
Branch, in conjunction with the
N.R.M.A., revealed, as in former tests,
a disturbing state of affairs, only a
small percentage of the vehicles being
found to comply with the Regulations
for headlight adjustment, which are
designed to prevent dazzle and its
consequences—danger and inconvenb
ence to others—and to provide ade'
quate vision for the driver. Wrong
beam height, incorrect spread, faulty
direction, and lack of uniformity be'
tween the two lamps were frequently
observed.
Headlight Test Results.
Analysing the position, it was found
that several causes existed —lack of
regular supervision and readjustment,
careless adjustment, faulty lamp and
globe design and manufacture, and the
impossibility, in some cases, of ob'
taining a satisfactory setting within
the existing Regulations. Wide varia'
tion between high and low beam has
frequently caused drivers to hold on
to high beam at risk of trouble, be'
cause the illumination ahead with dip'
ped, or low, beam was insufficient for
comfortable driving. The projected
revision will control th e low beam,
which may be adjusted for safe and
comfortable driving. Tests have shown
that driver reaction to properly'aimed
headlights is nonexistent, and beams
aimed above the regulation setting
evoke prompt response from oncom-
ing traffic—up and down flashing of
their lights.
The modern tendency is to set
headlamps closer (downwards) to
wheel height, and this is not helping
the situation greatly. Lights are nor-
mally adjusted against a graduated
scale from, say, 25 yards and without
loading. When, later, four or five
people are seated in the vehicle, it
is invariably found that the beams are
far too high . Some allowance could,
therefore, be made to advantage when
setting beam height to meet and
counteract this tendency. Experience
has also shown that wide, or at least
considerable, variation exists between
identical globes in respect of the focus
of filaments—this is most serious in
the case of preffocused globes where
relied upon for beam spread and
direction'. Lamps equipped with pro'
vision (adjustment screws) for (a)
elevating and depressing the beam,
and (b) closing, or spreading the
beams, offer a wide range of adjust'
ment.
The essential features of good
vehicle lighting may be summed'up
simply as follows:
Normal voltage supply.
Good globes, correctly located in
relation to the reflector, within
a maximum tolerance of
in each direction.
Well'silvered and clean reflectors.
Clean lenses of clear glass
design.
Correct setting of beams.
Good driver behaviour.
A clean windscreen.
Failure under one, or more, of these
headings cannot be countenanced. In
N.S.W. in 1952 there are shown to
have been 254 accidents due to head'
light dazzle. Six people lost their
lives, and 186 were injured, a low
percentage on the basis of passenger
mileage and the volume of motor car
traffic, but nevertheless these lives
should not have been lost and bodies
injured as the result of driver com
fusion due to headlight dazzle. If
vehicle owners and operators will cor'
rect the headlamp settings, dip when
meeting others (and thus encourage
them to do likewise), good progress
is the result.
It is generally conceded that the
ideal type of beam should have a flat,
or oval, horizontal contour, of high
central intensity, the idea being to ib
luminate the full width and edges of
the road yet not be too high for
safety.
Headlamp Regulations.
Current Regulations require that the
headlamps of any motor vehicle must
be sufficiently powerful to render
easily discernible at a distance of 150
feet any person or object ahead, and
in practice this is found to allow a
good working margin and does not
call for any particular degree of brib
liance. The motorist obviously sees
best when dazzled least, and it is
equally true that he is dazzled less due
to this clearer vision. Old cars with
deteriorated lights, possibly odd fit'
tings and globes, seem to offend to
the greatest extent. Sealed beam
equipment affords a practical modern
method of overcoming the trouble,
and manufacturers are now providing
sealed beams designated “drive left”
suitable for Australian left'of'the'road
conditions. Flush type or “form fit'
ting” present day production head'
lamps are a real improvement, being
better protected from damage and less
likely to be jolted out of adjustment
than the earlier stem, or bracket,
mounted lamps.
The blue glare of mercury vapour
street lamps can be a worry, or even
a danger, to motorists.
Those districts where the powerful
orange'tinted sodium type street light'
ing is installed are, to my way of
thinking, more restful and, therefore,
safer for the handling of motor
vehicles, and more serviceable in the
evening half light. Expert opinion re
the relative first cost, and mainten'
ance costs and life of this type of
lighting, would be interesting. Also
whether research and experimentation
have established that the cadmium
sulphide type globe popular in France
provides superior general illumination.
In conclusion, it is my opinion that
that the human element is a most im'
portant factor in the solution of the
lighting and dazzle problem. With

good vehicles, good roads, and clear

have unnecessary hazards and dan-
gerous conditions unless drivers to a

lighting equipment for uniform
coverage and correct height, and to

Lighting Engineers, London, and
Street Lighting Engineer, Sydney
County Council.]
The problem of Street Lighting and
Road Safety is one of exceptional
complexity. So many people with
entirely different points of view and
training are concerned that it is usual-
ly very difficult to achieve the ade-
quate, comprehensive and well co-
ordinated scheme which, everyone
will agree, is so desirable for a large
city such as Sydney.
First there are the Municipal Coun-
cils composed of business and profes-
sional men from all walks ot life.
They are usually non-technical and
very interested in costs. They are
open to the demands and pleas of all
the residents in their respective wards
who have strong views on the preser-
vation of trees and the importance of
the particular street in which they
live. These are the bodies who
authorise expenditure on street light-
ing together with that required for
road construction, parks and play-
grounds, Baby Health Centres, gar-
bage removal, tree lopping, repay-
ment of loans, contributions to the
Fire Board, Cumberland County Coun-
cil and Department of Main Roads
and administration. A well-developed
and progressive municipality such as
Woollahra spent £19,300, or 6j% of
its income, on street lighting last year.
The City Council, before the enlarge-
ment of its area into Greater Sydney,
spent £38,000 in 1948, or 3|-% of Ls
total expenditure on street lighting.
These amounts represent the annual
charges made by the Supply Under-
taking to cover the annual cost of in-
stallation, electricity and maintenance.
There are 35 of these Municipal Coun-
cils and five major supply under-
takings in the County of Cumberland
alone.
A Complex Problem.
Then there are the Supply Autho-
rities, all of whom have either built
up their electricity networks over a
long period or have inherited existing
ones of long standing. Questions
such as whether series or multiple
street lighting should be adopted or
even the type of bracket or lamp
holder which should be used are
usually answered by the fact that it
is most expensive to change from
existing construction when many thou-
sands of fittings are involved. It
therefore follows that changes to suit
every development cannot be expect-
ed from any Supply Authority unless
there is a very good reason to justify
it. This does not mean that no im-
provements or advancement will be
made, but it does mean that the
Authorities cannot be expected to
purchase a number of different de-
signs of street lighting standards and
units in excess of those needed for
the work. The function of the Sup-
ply Authority is taken to be the pro-
vision of a safe, economical and effec-
tive service for the annual charges,
which are in most cases fixed except
for variations in basic costs. I have
reason to believe that in another
Australian Capital City fluorescent
street lighting lanterns containing 3-
80 watt tubes spaced 80 to 90 feet
apart are being considered for the
lighting of the principle city streets.
The cost of the lantern alone is about
£BO. Is it any wonder that the
Authority hesitates to adopt fluorescent
street lighting and seeks other means
which may be cheaper and as effec-
tive.
Next we have the several Govern-
ment Departments who are concerned
with the lighting and construction of
public thoroughfares. The Police
Department, Traffic Branch, whose
staff of Traffic Constables we might
truthfully say are vitally concerned
when on point duty at dangerous in-
tersections. One of the reasons for
the poor visibility of these men, al-
though probably not the most impor-
tant, is their traditional dark blue uni-
form alleviated slightly by their
white gauntlet gloves and cap cover.
The Department of Motor Tran-
sport deals with Road Signs, Pedes-
trian Crossings, Traffic Signals, Police
requirements (special lighting some-
times erected when the Municipal
Council does not accept the proposal)
and accident statistics. The Depart-
ment of Government Transport, on
the other hand, is concerned only with
the lighting of Omnibuses and Trams,
Tramway Safety Zones and Waiting
Shelters. These two Departments
emerged recently from the now de-
funct Department of Road Transport
and Tramways. The Department of
Main Roads, curiously enough, is not
concerned with the lighting of the
roads. The Department of Public
Works looks after the lighting of cer-
tain bridges and special areas, such as
airports, while the Maritime Services
Board is responsible for some streets
near the waterfront which are not
vested in the Municipal Council.
Then we come to the Road Safety
Council with all its satellite commit'
tees and Commonwealth'wide activi'
ties. As Colonel Youden has said,
it recognises that lighting is important
to road safety but, of necessity, this
forms a very small part in its con'
siderations. It includes in its mem'
bershin representatives of those impor'
tant species of our race —the pedes'
trian and the motorist. The pedes'
trian who thinks he can be seen and
crosses the road with unjustified con'
fidence, and the motorist, who com'
plains about the brightness of the
street lighting while carrying the most
glaring example and utterly confusing
pair of headlamps in the picture.
We must admit that here in Aus-
tralia we do not go in for research as
they do in the older countries, par-
ticularly in the U.S.A. We are con-
tent to read the conclusions of inves-
tigations overseas, at least as far as
our Public Bodies are concerned. Let
us by all means learn of these re-
searches and note that after lighting
such and such a highway the percen-
tage of accidents at night dropped 40,
50 or 60%, but let us not assume that
we shall obtain similar results here for
the same improvement because they
did. There is something peculiar
about the Australian motorist and
pedestrian—they even have slightly
different characteristics in each State,
and they are certainly different from
the American or English drivers.
Two other influences should also be
mentioned. The Civil Engineer, re-
sponsible for road and footway sur-
faces, and the Town Planner, who

appears to be intent on upsetting
whole areas —very laudable in the case
of slums, of course —creating green
belts, new traffic routes and com'
munity centres. Neither of them ap-
pears to have much appreciations of
the difficulties they introduce in the
lighting of the public places which
they design and construct. I refer to
such details as tarred macadam with
road camber, which is, fortunately,
going out in favour of concrete; the
indiscriminate planting of trees; the
uneven junctions and contours of the
streets so common to housing sub'
divisions.
What has been said gives, I trust, a
fair description of the complicated
position in which we find ourselves
with regard to the subject. It re-
mains now to suggest a few general
lines of action which may be taken
to achieve the objective of adequacy
and co-ordination throughout the met-
ropolitan or so-called “built-up” area.
Standard of Adequacy.
It should be stated at once that a
standard of adequacy has already been
agreed to and published by the Stan-
dards Association of Australia in their
Street Lighting Code, 1939, In this
Code will be found a clear statement
of the principles which should be fol-
lowed, the recommended minimum
lamp lumens per foot of street for the
different classes of thoroughfares, the
night traffic density basis upon which
traffic routes are classified, the mount-
height and spacing which should be
adhered to, the placement of lamps
with regard to bends, junction and in-
tersections, and even notes regarding
the spacing required between trees and
lamp positions, the advisability of
painting background surfaces, such as
fences and the like. It distinguishes
between “cut off” and non-cut off”
lighting because the former require a
smaller spacing and greater mounting
height to obtain the same degree of
even illumination on the roadway,
but it is quite impartial as to the type
of light source which is to be adopted.
This means that the Code can be
applied to Incandescent, Mercury,
Sodium, Fluorescent or Gas lighting
with equal confidence. It has been
published long enough for those in
every Electricity Undertaking and
Municipal Council or other organisa-
tion who deal with street lighting to
be familiar with its contents. If it has
not been used for the purpose for
which it was produced—a guide to
good practice—then the only way left
is to make it compulsory instead of
advisory.
While there are many miles of im-
portant streets in Sydney and its
suburbs which still have sub-standard
lighting, and one sometimes despairs
of ever seeing the adequacy which we
know is required, it is rather surpris'
ing to look back twenty years of so
at the appalling state of affairs, when
there was no standard code in any
country. I was recently looking at
some “before and after’’ photographs
of Pacific Highway, then Lane Cove
Road, before the Harbour Bridge was
built, Parramatta Road and Cook
River Road (now Prince’s Highway),
with their widely'spaced 60 or 100
watt beacon lamps; Ansae Parade at
Moore Park, with its great clumps of
palm trees in the central rockeries and
the 500 watt lamps, almost hidden
by them, about 300 feet apart. We
have come a long way in lighting
since then, and we must have changed
considerably in our habits also for
there were less accidents on the road
per 1000 vehicles, night or day, in
1925 than there are tO'day.
Select Committee Appointed.
The N.S.W. Government in 1948
appointed a select committee to re'
port upon “Road Accident Casualties,’’
and I had the honour to present evi-
dence to this committee on behalf of
the General Manager of the Sydney
County Council on “Street Lighting
in Relation to Road Accidents.” From
reports received from a number of
Municipal Councils this year it is urn
derstood that the Government pro'
poses to amend the Local Government
Act a as result of this enquiry to make
the provisions of the Street Lighting
Code mandatory and in some way—
which is not clarified as yet —to pro-
vide financial assistance in order that
this standard may be achieved. (Also
reported briefly in the “Sydney Morn'
ing Herald,” 28th May, 1952.) This
is all to the good because, in my
opinion, the Municipal Councils should
not have to bear the whole cost of
lighting highways any more than
they should be required to bear the
total cost of their construction. With
regard to the means taken to imple'
ment these attempts at coordination
there seems to be no difficulty, except
that of funds, which cannot be solved.
Undoubtedly there would need to be
a suitable Authority to see that the
standard was being carried out and,
without altering the functions of the
present Department of Motor Tran'
sport to any great extent, it appears
that such a responsibility could be
taken quite easily.
In conclusion, I would like to add
a few remarks which have been in-
spired by previous speakers. Mr.
Peach raised the question whether it
was technically possible to provide
street lighting of uniform intensity
without glare closely simulating day-
light conditions. I would say first of
all that daylight conditions vary con-
siderably and that quite a dull, over'
cast day would give an illumination
much more than sufficient from the
accident prevention point of view
The street lighting installation in Ox-
ford Street through Bondi Junction is
a practical example of what can be
done. Here we have two 250 watt
mercury suspended lamps spaced 180
feet apart and giving 100 lumens per
linear foot of street. This is equiva'
lent to Class B or C traffic route ac'
cording to the Code and high enough
to be compared with daylight condi'
tions. The cost of this standard of
street lighting to Municipal Councils
would be, under present conditions,
.£I6OO per mile per annum. Even at
30 lumens per linear foot, which is
the minimum provided in the Code
for a traffic route, the degree of visi'
bility would be satisfactory for the
conditions of medium vehicular traffic
(400'800 vehicles per hour) and neg'
ligible pedestrian traffic. By way of
comparison, the existing street light'
ing in George Street, City, is 80
lumens per foot; in Pitt and Castle'
reagh Streets, 70 lumens per foot; and
in Martin Place just over 100 lumens
per foot after allowing for the wider
carriageway and diffusing glassware.
This brings up the question raised
by Inspector Sherwood regarding the
use of motor car headlights, which is
prohibited in some other cities, such
as Paris, where street lighting is con'
sidered adequate. There is no doubt
in my mind that the prohibition of
headlights in all the main city streets
of Sydney would be a very good thing
because the street lighting in those
streets is adequate. The side streets
of Paris and London are no different
from Melbourne or Sydney, and no
doubt the prohibition regarding head'
lamps does not and should not apply
to side streets. Headlights are the
traffic policeman’s greatest menace.
There is only one comment I wish
to make with regard to Colonel
Youden’s contribution: that while it is
true that the object of good street
lighting is to provide contrast between
a darker object on a lighter back'
ground by silhouette in most cases,
there are a few important exceptions.
These occur in situations where it is
impossible to obtain a lighter back'
ground—a traffic constable or pedes'
trian against a black sky for instance.
Here we must resort to direct illumi'
nation, and the importance of light
clothing then becomes apparent.
The technical aspects of street light'
ing have been discussed on a number
of occasions at this Society’s meetings.
The requirements are well known.
The major consideration tO'day is not
technical, but financial and administra'
tive, and for this assistance there is
urgent need if the roads are to be
made reasonably safe at night.

(6) T. H. McCOURT,
M.I.E.S. (Aust.).
Dealing with motor car headlamps,
we have first of all the problem or
illuminating the roadway for the driver
of the vehicle. It is generally con'
sidered that where there is no on'
coming traffic and the dipped beam is
not used, modern types of motor car
headlighting systems provide adequate
illumination for the driver. However,
it is with the direction and intensity
of the dipped beam that the greatest
problem lies. There are two principal
systems of producing a dipped beam,
i.e., the American system and the
European or Continental system. The
American point of view was set out
in the annex to Report 238 of the
1.C.1. in 1939. From visibility tests
H. H. Magdsick and his collaborators
came to the conclusion that the beam
pattern from sealed beam headlamps
was superior to that of Continental
type headlamps. In all tests taken, a
raan'sized pedestrian dummy was used
as the visibility subject, and visibility
was considered satisfactory even if only
part of the subject could be seen in
silhouette.
Safe Driving Necessities.
For safe driving, however, it is not
sufficient to see that there is some'
thing present in front of the car. The
driver—for his own safety—must be
able to estimate quickly and fairly
accurately the location of the object
on the road. This is impossible if
only part of the object is seen in sib
houette. When the driver can see
the point, at which the obiect reaches
the road surface, then its position can
be estimated with reasonable accuracy.
Therefore, the lower part of any ob'
ject is the most important with regard
to visibility on the road.
When two cars pass each other,
each driver wants to have as much
light as possible on the road surface
ahead. At the same time it is essem
tial that the intensity of the head'
lights of the oncoming vehicle in his
direction be so low that he is not ad'
versely affected by glare. When the
driver’s eyes are subjected to glare,
the time taken for them to be re'
accommodated to the brightness of
the road surface ahead becomes a
danger period during which, for all
practical purposes, he is totally unable
to see. Converting the reaccommoda'
tion time factor into terms of distance
travelled, from tests taken by myself
it is my opinion that at a speed of
30 miles per hour a driver is incapable
of sight for a distance of at least 40
feet. Where the street lighting is
poor, I have found it more satisfac'
tory to stop the car altogether rather
than risk the possibility of collision
due to some object, e.g., a cyclist,
pedestrian or animal, on the road. It
has been my finding that these con'
ditions apply with the dipped beams
of late model cars—not only sealed
beam types, but a large number of
other systems as well.
The Continental System.
The Continental system —or what is
usually regarded as the Continental
system —is based on a headlamp bulb
designed to give a flat top beam for
passing oncoming traffic. This is
achieved by fitting a small metal cup
below the second filament. This cup
reflects all the rays below the horizon'
tal up into the top half of the head'
light reflefletor, which in turn throws
the rays downwards on the road sur'
face. As a result of tests taken in
Europe in which the Continental sys'
tem was compared with American
sealed beam headlights the following
results were obtained;
(1) The dipped beam of tHe sealed
beam lamp has greater intensity
above the horizontal.
(2) The dipped beam of the seal'
ed beam lamp gives more light
towards the kerb.
(3) The driving beam of the Con'
tinental lamp has higher in.en'
sities in the centre of the beam.
(4) Both beams of the sealed beam
lamp are more widely spread.
(1) above is a distinct disadvam
tage and is a potential cause of acci'
dents. (2) is an advantage for the
driver of the vehicle. (3) is an ad-
vantage for the driver of the vehicle.
(4) is also, an advantage.
To summarise, then, the Continental
system has two distinct advantages
over the American system: First, that
high intensities are kept below the
horizontal when the dipped beam is
used. This is perhaps the most im'
portant advantage. Second, the higher
intensities in the beam centre means
that the driver can see further ahead.
On the other hand, the American sys'
tem has the advantages of throwing
more widely-spread beams and also
when the dipped beam is used there
is more light thrown towards the
kerb. The Continental system lamp is
considered satisfactory when the dip-
ped beam is used in so far as the
illumination of the road surface is
concerned, and in any case it appears
to be generally considered that any'
thing which will remove the glare
factor from the dipped beam of head'
Continued overleaf.

lights is desirable at the cost of a
slight reduction in visibility efficiency
on the road surface.
From the point of view of practical
effect on the road, iherefore, it would
appear that the use of the Continental
system is preferable to the use of the
American system because of the fact
that where lamps wLh the built-in
metal cup are used there is far less
chance ot accident due to temporary
blindness caused by glare in poorly-lit
streets.
The Glare Problem.
Another aspect of the glare problem
is the colour quality of the light emit-
ted. Attempts have been made for
many years to remove the dazzle from
headlights by means of filtering the
rays from the bulb. This aim had a
secondary purpose and that was to
overcome halation sometimes colo-
quially referred to as “Backlash”
which is experienced when driving in
fog, heavy ground mist, heavy rain
and snow. Light reflected back from
the drops of moisture in the atmos-
phere, or from the flakes of snow,
presents a very real and serious prob-
lem to the driver. The constant en-
deavour of his eyes to accommodate
themselves to the very high brightness
of this halation, and at the same time
to accommodate themselves to the
brightness patterns beyond it, renders
his visibility poor. In fact, it is ex-
ceedingly difficult to achieve any sort
of satisfactory visibility at a distance
of more than a few feet in front’ of
the headlamps. It must be appre-
ciated, of course, that this distance
varies with the density of moisture in
the atmosphere. The marked success
of sodium lighting in penetrating such
atmospheres gave rise to the investiga-
tion of the possibility of achieving a
monochromatic (one colour) light for
vehicle headlights. To achieve maxi-
mum efficiency the yellow/green wave-
length was chosen and a reasonably
satisfactory result was achieved by the
use of cadmium yellow-tinted lamp
bulbs. The tests taken with this type
of lamp proved so successful in re-
ducing dazzle for normal driving con-
ditions in comparison with lamps
giving white light that, in 1936. the
use of cadmium yellow lamps was
made compulsory in France, and this
action was followed by several other
countries. Lack of satisfactory figures
from such countries owing to the in-
tervention of the war has prevented
me from quoting statistics, but in the
first period of commission in France
after the introduction of this law I
recall seeing some rather startling
figures, indicative not only that the
night accident rate was reduced but
also that driver fatigue had been
lessened considerably. In some States
in Australia the use of cadmium yel-
low lamps is permitted, but in New
South Wales the law states very dis-
tinctly that the vehicle should have
white light at the front and red light
at the rear. This prevents motorists
taking advantage of the benefits of
cadmium yellow bulbs. According to
all reports, these bulbs have not one
objectionable feature,’ and one point I
would like to leave with this meeting
is that consideration should be given
to revising the regulations to permit
the use of cadmium yellow lamps in
New South Wales. Despite the pre-
cedents set by overseas countries, I am
not recommending that the regula-
tions should be altered to specify the
use of cadmium yellow lamps, but
there is ample evidence to prove that
if this were done only advantages
could result from it.
From the point of view of motor
car headlights, to summarise the facts
which I have brought forward two
means of improving safety on Aus-
tralian roads are:
(1) The use of the Continental sys-
tem metal cup headlamp.
(2) The use of cadmium yellow
headlight bulbs.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Grundfest mentioned his own
experience of the difficulties of seeing
at dusk in the half-light between day-
light and night. He considered this
time particularly dangerous, and asked
Inspector Sherwood if any figures had
been compiled regarding accidents at
dusk.
Inspector Sherwood replied that no
statistics had been taken out on ac-
cidents at dusk. Although the times
of occurrence of accidents were re-
corded, the variation of dusk through-
out the year would involve a tremen-
dous amount of work to compile such
statistics. He pointed out, however,
that the number of night accidents
exceeded the daytime accidents even
during the winter months, when dusk
would fall during the daytime hours
(6 a.m. to 6 p.m.). He further stated
that his department frequently issued
warnings about such dangers, but with-
out great effect, and he considered the
only solution was to improve the street
lighting.
Mr. MacLaren mentioned the use
of swivelling headlights, which turn
with the front wheels of motor
vehicles, and suggested that such head-
lights might be of assistance to drivers.
He also suggested that the narrow
width of many roads might be a con-
tributory factor in accidents.
Mr. G. C. T. Brown said that in his
experience of night driving on un-
lighted roads the value of the warn-
ing given by the headlights of ap-
proaching vehicles inspired greater
confidence than did daylight driving
conditions.
Mr. Peach, in replying to the ques'
tion of daylight conditions raised by
Mr. Fallon, said that he intended to
convey the impression of an evenly-
lighted roadway. In answering the
ques,ion asked by Mr. Knight about
the signs on trams, he said that such
signs used a type of fluorescent paint.
The fluorescent material had a com-
paratively short life, however, and its
rapid deterioration made it unsuitable
for road sign purposes. He added
that the sample materials shown all
depended upon the reflec.ion of light
for their effectiveness.
Mr. Blunt referred to the seasonal
difference in night accidents between
summer and winter and asked whether
the corresponding variation in ambient
temperatures with its effect on the
light output of gas-discharge lamps
would be a contributory factor.
Mr. Fallon replied that no tests had
been made to ascertain the variation
in light out-put on discharge lamps.
He said that the majority of mercury
vapour lamps were used in enclosed
type lanterns, which would tend to
minimise the effects of variations in
ambient temperature. He mentioned
that one early installation using ex-
posed lamps had experienced an ab-
normal rate of lamp failure due to
fracture of the glass envelope of the
lamp.
Mr. Falk asked if any tests were
made on the headlights of new
vehicles before they were released to
the public.
Mr. Fraser (Department of Motor
Transport) said that a sample of every
new vehicle is submitted for inspec-
tion. He said that the recent trend
towards fitting headlamps into the
mudguards of vehicles was bad from
the adjustment aspect as the mud-
guards were most susceptible to
damage. Swivelling type headlights
would be permissible providing some
light was still thrown ahead of the
vehicle. He considered that the
American sealed beam type headlight
with its broad spread of light was a
better solution. Mr. Fraser also com-
mented on the tunnel effect created by
concentrating all the available light on
the road surface, and suggested that it
was essential to provide some light on
the surrounding areas. With reference
to the use of yellow bulbs in head-
lights, he said that this had been con-
sidered, but the advantages of using
them have not yet been proven.

Foundation Work in Compressed Air
By G. O. BOULTON, M.E., M.I.E. (Aust.), F.A.I.B.
Paper presented before a meeting of the N.S.W. Chapter, Australian Institutc
of Builders, Sydney.
Choice of Method.
In all construction the choice of ma-
terial must be influenced principally
by the anticipated cost, considered in
perspective with matters such as speed
of completion, risk of failure of the
method and quality of the work pro-
duced.
The compressed air method is ap-
plicable to construction which has to
be carried out under water or in very
wet ground. If there is a practicable
alternative by which it may be done
under atmospheric conditions, it
should be given full consideration be-
fore a decision is made.
The cost of work in compressed air
may be many times the cost of sim-
ilar work in the open. Its speed de-
pends upon the plant installation em-
ployed and the organisation of labour.
There are unusual risks to be met,
requiring experience and close super-
vision, but the successful completion
of an undertaking is seldom in doubt
and work of high quality can be as-
sured.
General Principles.
For foundations the usual procedure
is to sink a cylinder or caisson as far
as possible by open excavation or
dredging before compressed air is ap-
plied. The cylinder must have some
kind of provision for attaching an air-
lock at the top, or so near the top
that it is always above the natural
level of the water. When the air-lock
is attached, isolating the cylinder from
the atmosphere, compressed air is in-
troduced below it and the water level
is forced down to the cutting edge at
the bottom.
The water expelled may be dispers-.
ed into porous ground surrounding
the cylinder, but, if the cutting edge
happens to be bedded in clay, it may
be necessary to eject the water through
a pipe.
The air pressure required is 4 lb.
per sq. in. for every 9 feet depth of
water displaced.
Air-Locks.
An air-lock is a steel pressure
chamber fitted with two doors which
usually open downwards, as shown in
the illustration of a man-lock in Fig-
ure 1. By the operation of valves
the pressure in the air-lock may he
equalised with that in the cylinder
and the lower door can be opened.
When the lower door is shut and the
lock is brought to atmospheric pres-
sure, the upper door can be opened.
This provides means of admitting men
to the cylinder and returning them
to the open air while the pressure in
the cylinder is maintained.
There are air-locks of various de-
signs intended for the passage of men,
materials and both.
Figure 2 shows a material-lock with
a side door for dumping or filling
buckets; the rope to external crane
or hoist passes through a gland in the
top.
Figure 3 shows a material-lock with
a top door pneumatically operated in
two halves which are drawn apart to
open. The rope gland is formed part-
ly in each half. The bucket being used
can be taken right out of the lock.
Figure 4 illustrates a combination'
lock in use. It is the same as the ma-
teriaMock of Figure 2 with a man'
lock chamber attached on the side,
with a communicating door between.
The air-locks described above are
all efficient types. There are various
other designs in use as manufactured
by different supliers.
Access to the working chamber of
the cylinder or caisson is usually pro-
vided through a vertical shaft 3 feet
in diameter. For the man-lock shaft
a ladder is fitted. This size is to be
regarded as standard. A shaft of diam-
eter less than three feet should be
used only when space is restricted ab'
normally.
Cylinder Types.
Small cylinders have room for only
one access shaft which has to be used
for both men and materials. In this
case a combination-lock is required. A
small type of cylinder suitable for
building work is shown in Figure 5, as
used for Borthwick’s Freezer Block
foundations at Murrarie and for Paul’s
Ice Cream Factory at South Brisbane
recently. A small bridge foundation

construction in 1936 is shown in Fig-
ure 6. This cylinder also has only
one access shaft.
In larger cylinders separate shafts
and locks for men and materials are
installed to advantage. A cylinder
of this type is seen in Figure 7 and a
caisson with six locks, four for men
and two for materials appears in Fig-
ure 8. These also were employed in
the Storey Bridge construction.
In very deep cylinders one man-
lock is insufficient and two are need-
ed to keep continuous shifts of men
at work, because the time which has
to be spent in the lock for decompres-
sion may equal or exceed the working
period. This was the case in the
Storey Bridge caissons shown in Fig-
ure 8 where the depth was 128 feet
below water level and the pressure
was 57 lb. per sq. in.
A number of steel cylinders are
now being driven at Gibson Island,
close to the Brisbane River, for the
foundations of the City Electric Light
Company’s new power house. The
shells are 3ft. 6in. and 4ft. 6in. diam-
eter, of half inch and five-eighth plate,
with cutting edges 3ft. long of inch
and a quarter plate. The cylinders
strike sandstone at 124 feet depth,
into which they are driven about two
feet. The sandstone normally provides
a seal so that the cylinders can be ex-
cavated in the dry and bell shaped
spread footings up to 10ft. diameter
dug out in the sandstone below. The
foundations are reinforced with steel
bars and concreted solid to the sur-
face. Of 70 foundations 7 proved
ineffective for dry working through
faults in the rock or damage to cut'
ting edges. These cylinders were air-
locked at a pressure of 541 b. per sq.
in., and for continuous working two
man-locks were essential. In the place
of a standard combination-lock which
could have been used on cylinders of
this size at a lower pressure, the three-
lock arrangement shown in Figure 9
was built and employed.
Cylinder Details.
The working chamber of a cylinder
should be about nine feet in height.
If the cylinder sinks unexpectedly
there is less chance of harm to the
men at work if the working chamber
is high. The cutting edge should
be splayed or stepped at a blunt angle
internally where space permits to pre-
vent the cylinder from sinking far
into the material below.
The main supply of air is admitted
immediately below the manlock door.
This ensures a continuous supply of
fresh air to all points. The man-
lock is fed from this point and the
remaining air travels downwards to
the working chamber through the ac-
cess shaft, eliminating stagnant areas.
Ihe material locks are fed through
their individual shafts with air which
J through the working
chamber. The surplus air is discharg-
ed from the working chamber under
the cutting edge and dispersed into
the ground or surrounding water. It
may rise immediately to the surface
causing a water or mud boil around
the cylinder which helps to lubricate
the skin and aids the process of sink-
ing Sometimes the air rises to the
surface at a considerable distance and
at many points and will continue to
rise for a day or more after a cylinder
has been completed and the supply
of compressed air has been stopped.

Air-Lock Operation.
The passage of men through the
air-lock must be controlled with great
care to protect them from the harm-
ful effects of pressure change and the
after-effects of exposure.
Ear injury may result if the pres-
sure is raised or lowered too rapidly.
A complaint known as “compressed-
air illness,” “caisson disease” or
“bends” may follow inadequate de-
compression.
These afflictions are the common
concern of all workers in compressed
air, including divers who operate in
the ordinary flexible diving dress.
Since the health of the workmen
is involved, most countries have regu-
lations or codes governing the conduct
of operations. In Australia compliance
with the S.A.A. Compressed Air Code
is mandatory.
Pressure Limits.
Working pressures, except in the
case of divers, have never exceeded
60 lb. per sq. in. above the atmos-
phere. The various regulations in
force overseas make no provision for
pressures greater than 50 lb. per sq.
in., which in some cases are prohib-
ited, The Australian Code gives 60
lb. per sq. in. as a maximum.
Working Hours.
Before the adoption of the Austra-
lian Code, two shifts per day were
usually worked, in conformity with
American practice, but, rightly or
wrongly, one working period only is
now provided for.
The Code states maximum working
periods recommended, but these are
subject to possible reduction under the
State Industrial Awards. For work-
ing pressures not exceeding 15 lb.
per sq. in. 8 hours may be worked,
and the period is gradually reduced to
H hours for pressures in the maximum
range of from 55 to 60 lb. per sq. in.
Rate of Compression.
Compression should be carried out
as rapidly as possible in order to
shorten the period of exposure to
pressure, besides saving valuable time.
The rate must be controlled, however,
to prevent injury to the workmen’s
ears.
A diver, controlling his own de-
scent, can often descend very rapidly.
In air-locks, where a group of men
are compressed, the requirements of
all must be satisfied. A rate of 5
lb. per min., as specified in the Code,
can usually be maintained.
In the fast stage of decompression
the same maximum rate is applicable.
Compressed-Air Illness.
In the course of human exposure
to compressed air the system becomes
charged with nitrogen, which enters
through the lungs and is held in solu-
tion in the blood and body-tissues.

This is known to be harmless, so long
as it remains in solution.
Compressed'air illness is an after-ef'
feet of exposure, caused by the liber'
ation of nitrogen bubbles when the
pressure is lowered. The symptoms
vary widely with the location and ex'
tent of the bubbles set free. The most
common forms are localised pain, diz'
ziness, vomiting attacks, collapse apd
paralysis. They rarely appear before
the workmen have left the locks, and
generally soon after exit.
Compressed'air illness may result
from faulty decompression, accidental
variations, or the presence of highly
susceptible men. It is difficult to
eliminate but the number of cases can
be kept very low if reasonable precau'
tions are taken.
Decompression Practice,
The stage method of decompression
has been generally adopted, in which
the pressure is lowered rapidly to half
its absolute value, and then at a slow
uniform rate to its completion. The
time required is a function of the
working pressure and the period of ex'
posure to it.
Tables covering a large range of
conditions are incorporated in the
Code.
Control of Decompression.
In the pressure gauges attached to
the locks, accurate calibration is ne'
cessary. All gauges should be tested
throughout the working range.
The airdocks are usually operated
by attendance stationed outside. A
useful aid to accuracy in operation is
provided by a decompression dial as
illustrated in Figure 9. The dial is
mounted near a clock beside the pres'
sure'gauges. At the commencement
of decompression the starting point
of the card attached to the dial is
rotated to match the minute hand of
the adjacent clock. Thereafter the
position of the minute hand indicates
what the airdock pressure at any mo'
ment should be.
Recompression.
With the standard of protection
provided in the tables of the Code,
about one half per cent, of the de'
compressions result in cases of com'
pressed'air illness.
It has long been known that sym'
ptoms usually disappear on return to
work. This led to the use of recom'
pression for treatment, and it is still
the only effective remedy known.
All works of any consequence are
now equipped with a medical lock. A
lock with two compartments is shown
in Figure 10.
In an emergency, recompression may
be carried out with confidence by any'
one acquainted with its principles.
Medical supervision of the patients
and their treatment is nevertheless de-
sirable.
The pressure should be increased
rapidly to its original working level,
despite the disappearance of symptoms
before it is reached. Some authorities
recommend a pressure above the orig'
inal, but this may not be possible
when the lock is supplied with air
from the same source as the works.
Recompression usually gives coni'
plete relief at once, through a reduction
of the nitrogen bubbles in size. For
permanent results they need to be re'
dissolved. To this end the pressure
should be maintained for twenty to
thirty minutes. A reduced rate of
decompression is then applied,' with
particular caution as atmospheric pres'

materials.

sure is approached.
For the recompression of divers
the Admiralty Diving Manual sets out
recommended procedure differing
slightly from the above.
Most patients can be cured com'
pletely, but symptoms sometimes re'
cur and treatment has to be repeated.
In such cases the rate of decompres'
sion should be further reduced.
Late treatment is the principal
cause of failure. The workmen should
be warned, therefore, to report sus'
pected symptoms at the earliest op'
portunity.
General Precautions.
Wherever possible the health of the
workmen should be placed under med'
ical supervision. The Code provides
for a medical test before employ'
ment, with periodical reexamination.
It is found, apart from medical dis'
closures, that some men are more sus'
ceptible than others to the effects of
compressed air and have to be dis'
carded from employment. For this
reason the trouble experienced in the
early stages of a project is often dis'
turbing.
The airdocks should be protected
from extremes of temperature and
reasonable amenities provided in and
about the works to reduce discomfort
and fatigue. Proper dressing sheds
with hot shower baths are necessary.
In Queensland hot coffee is supplied
to each shift after decompression.
The Code provides for the furnish'
ing of identification badges to be worn
by workmen and the notification of
all local hospitals, ambulances and
police when work is in progress. The
badges indicate the nature of employ'
ment in which the men are engaged
and the location of the medical lock
to which they should be sent in the
event of illness.
The men should be instructed to
avoid getting cold and to exercise
themselves in the airdock during de'
compression. They should also be ad'
vised that the use of alcohol is harm'
ful.
Fire Hazard.
There is a danger of fire in com'
pressed air if timber is present. In
the Grey Street Bridge construction
in 1929 a fire was started by explo'
sives in the working chamber of a
caisson. Hardwood logs 12 inches in
diameter in a saturated condition
burned freely and it was necessary to
flood the working chamber to extin'
guish the fire.
Supply of Compressed Air.
The Code provides that the quant'
ity of compressed air supplied to the
work shall be not less than 25 cu. ft.
per min. for each man in the working
chamber and 10 cu. ft. per min. for
each man. in the airdock. In terms
of “free air” the pressure must be
known in order to calculate the quant'
ity.
A standby in compressor capacity
is also required to cover breakdowns
of the main plant.
High pressure air at the working
pressure plus 80 to 100 lb. per sq.
in. is also required when pneumatic
tools are to be operated.
The quality of the air is import'
ant and the intake of the compressors
should be arranged to secure a clean
supply. Contamination in the com'
pressors should be reduced by the use
of good machines and selected lubri'
cants. Facilities for removing oil
from the compressed air should be
provided. For this purpose an “after'
cooler” of tubular design is effective.
When the air is chilled by circulating
water, most of the oil it contains is
carried off by the moisture condensed.
The efficiency of the workmen is
affected by temperature, humidity and
movement of the air, which are the
factors constituting “air'condition.”
The temperature can be controlled to
some extent, the humidity cannot be
reduced much below saturation by any
practicable means, but appreciable
movement can be induced by the
system of ventilation already describ'
ed. It can be seen that the quantity

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
The building permits issued by the
Brisbane City Council during May
numbered 784, exclusive of works en-
tered into by the Public Works De-
partment, but inclusive of those of
the State Housing Commission and of
the War Service Homes Commission.
The majority of the permits were
for new dwellings, but of the larger
constructions there is a Church of
England at Hendra costing £6200;
alterations and additions at New Farm
to cost £10,000; another one for the
Sanders Chemical Pty. Ltd. in the
Valley costing £17,000; a new
church at Thompson Estate (£20,000);
a brick dwelling at Sherwood costing
£7000; a stone building at Albion
(£7000), and a new factory and ware-
house for Queensland Country Traders
Ltd., North Quay (£20,000). New
shopfronts for McWhirters Ltd., Val-
ley, will cost £10,000; bulk storage
and tank for Ampol Petroleum
(£5000). A tenement building at Hill
End, South Brisbane, will cost £14,500;
and additions to another south side
building are to cost £7OOO.
The shortage of loan money has
had the effect of slowing down of
Go vernmental expenditure on building
and other work such as the electrifica-
tion of suburban railways. In the lat-
ter section, the “scrapping” or defer-
ment of a local tender for the Indoo-
roopilly Bridge at about half the
amount of English tenders is particu-
larly unfortunate.
Since the importation of twelve
American Diesel locomotives, which
have more than justified their acquisi-
tion in their haulage capacity and
speed, the first two of ten English
Diesel locomotives ordered at a cost of
£70,000 each have been put into com-
mission, and in addition to being even
more streamlined are more powerful
than their American prototypes.
New University College.
Still another University College
that of the Congregational Churches
is to be added to Queensland’s
great seat of learning at St. Lucia.
Builders, J. Hutchinson 6? Sons, have
begun to build “Cromwell College,”
at a cost of £101,740, to be completed
in twelve months, in two .sections so
as to provide the earliest possible oc-
cupation, the first to accommodate 72
students.
And yet another large hospital is to
be added to Brisbane’s numerous list.
Estimated to cost £270,000, of which
£103,000 will be Government subsidy,
based upon 103 beds at £lOOO each, a
hospital, unfortunately referred to as
being for “the aged and incurably
sick,” is to be built on land at Kan-
garoo Point donated by Miss M. J.
Bedford in memory of her lifelong
friend, the late Dr. Lillian Cooper of
Brisbane. It is to be a six-storeyed
building named the “Mount Olivet
Hospital,” to be conducted by the
Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity and
open to women and men of all creeds.
When the demand for beds for the
extreme cases of illness to which this
hospital intends to minister exceeds
103, two more floors to accommodate
67 more patients will be provided for.
New Wharves.
A new concrete-decked wharf, 1200
feet in length with fast, mobile electric
cranes, is to be built on the Brisbane
River between Hamilton and Pin-
kenba: and plans are now being pre-
pared by Governmental officers. With
every modern appurtenance, this could
be a million pound job a sum so
glibly referred to in these modern
days.
With other wharf extensions going
on from the B.H.P. wharves, the
Hamilton area on the Brisbane River
will have a chain of 6000 feet of
wharfage capable of being continued
for several miles to Pinkenba by the
resumption of the Royal Queensland
Golf Club’s links. Storage space be-
hind the wharves is almost unlimited,
as the spoil from the river bed is
being deposited to reclaim the fore-
shores.
Tenders are to be called for a
30,000 square foot shed for the almost
completed Nixon-Smith wharf adjoin-
ing the B.H.P. wharf, which is equip-
ped for four large cranes moving on
rails. There should be no shortage of
wharf accommodation for the P. 6?
O. Strath liners, whose terminal port
is soon to be extended from Sydney
to Brisbane.
The well-known Architect - Builder,
Mr. Walter Taylor, now in his 83rd
year, and supervising the painting of
his Indooroopilly Bridge, might be in
danger of being termed a “visionary”
were it not for the fact that the vision
he had of using the discarded cables
that held the suspended arms of the
Sydney Harbour Bridge until they
were joined, to build a suspension
bridge over the Brisbane River at Ini
dooroopilly, has produced substantial
dividends for the company’s share-
holders.
There are many other buildings, in-
cluding a church, which do infinite
credit to Mr. Taylor’s capacity for
both designing and building; but his
present constructive activity is more in
the nature of an experiment, one that
visualises the utilisation of the ocean
waves to generate electricity, in which
pursuit he has spent £3OO so far to
give him the data to justify an esti-
mated outlay of £5OOO on a power
station built of concrete with two tur-
bines. As Mr. Taylor’s guiding star
in this project is the service he can
render his fellow-men and women, by
getting the ocean waves to spend their
force into a large wooden shute in-
stead of upon the -ocks and beach, he
has no intention of seeking patent
rights should success attend his meri-
torious experiment.
The Beach Sand Industry.
The beaches round about the South
Coast where Mr. Taylor is working
are now giving up several million
pounds a year in the recoveries of
rutile, zircon and other valuable ele-
ments from the mineral sands that
have lain dormant, waiting for other
“visionaries” to act. How these State
“potentialities,” which used to be the
cynic’s stock joke, do keep cropping
up!

scribed in our issue of July, 1952, to

hop from the days of “swords to

Brisbane’s capacity to build things
extends to the construction of organs
by an organisation whose long ex-
perience has earned for the firm a
fame for organ building that extends
as far as Great Britain. There is now
on the way to Perth, 3700 miles over-
land by motor van, a 5-ton, three-
manual console and complete with
1400 pipes. Of the 21 organs built
by Whitehouse 6? Co., this is the
largest built in Brisbane—at a cost of
£5500. The Kauri pine of North
Queensland, regarded as the best wood
for the purpose, was used for the
sounding-boards and console.
Activity in Cairns.
New buildings costing £500,000 are
in course of erection at Cairns (North
Queensland) and include the State’s
most modern railway station of con-
crete and brick, costing £300,000, to
be completed at the end of July. It
is 400 ft. long with platform 30ft.
wide the length of 638 ft.
A somewhat unusual feature in
Cairns buildings on foundations which
strike water at as near the surface as
3ft. is the necessity to build on piles
driven deeply into the earth and lay
the concrete slabs on the foundations
through underlying water. Pumping
equipment costing £13,000 was
brought from England to cope with
the water of Cairns, where the mon-
soonal rainfall early each year is
measured in yards, feet and inches.
The new air base for seaplanes at
Redland Bay, 25 miles from Brisbane,
between Stradbroke Island and the
mainland ,is functioning with great
satisfaction as the most picturesque
sea base in Australia, and perhaps the
safest. So much so that it will shel-
ter during times of abnormal weather
planes that would prefer Redland Bay
to Rose Bay for a safe descent.
The gauntlet is down. Toowoomba,

gaged in primary production but in
having one of the largest metal - work-
ing establishments in the Common-
wealth, and many other secondary in-
dustries. of this Darling Downs city
2000 feet above sea level and 90 miles
from Brisbane.
The challenge goes out to Ballarat,
of 46,000 people, and the time limit
is ten years in which to gain the
laurels of “biggest inland city.”
Priority is to be given to bitumen road
extensions, because in the outlying
suburbs to which bitumen roads and
footpaths have not reached the red
soil, which prevails here, becomes fine
dust that disfigures buildings even in
improved areas to which it blows very
often. The estimated expenditure
budgeted for is £77,000.
This is a city made more beautiful
by its tree-lined streets, in many of
which trees on either side meet in the
centre of the roads, a forest park in
the centre of the city, and many
beautiful private gardens and houses
of the retired once-wealthy.

and £9,000 worth of Australian paint.
More than £850,000 worth of Aus-
tralian materials had been purchased
for the refinery since January, 1951.
This included: About 75 miles of lo-
cally-made seamless pipe; 850 tons
of Australian steel; 36,000 firebricks,
made by Australian manufacturers in
100 different shapes, at a cost of
£15,000; Australian wall tiles worth
£17,700 for the refinery pump houses
and instrument rooms; £9,000 worth
—BO tons —of Australian rockwool,
made from blast furnace slag and rock,
for use as pipe insulating material;
£40,000 worth of special piping to
carry 3,000,000 gallons of Corio Bay
sea water, hourly, through the refinery
for cooling purposes; £31,000 worth
of Australian-made concrete channels.
Geelong refinery contracts let to
Australian builders now totalled
£1,939,000.
These included a £220,000 workers’
temporary hostel and £300,000 worth
of earth-moving on the site. A
£162,000 dining, recreation and
change block was also being erected.
When completed this amenities block
would be one of the finest available
to workers in Australia.
MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
F. G. O'BRIEN LTD.
W. A. (Bill) Brackenrldge of Frank G. O'Brien Ltd., is manager of the Country
Sales Division—a busy and all-embracing section of this enterprising firm’s activi-
ties in the field of Glass, Shopfitting, Joinery and allied products.
Bill first pioneered the country districts In New South Wales for his firm in
the late I920's, and was "on the road" for many years before taking over the
Country Sales section at the Waterloo factory and this personal contact is still
very much in evidence in the company's country business.
Bill received his schooling in Adelaide and today lives at Manly—he has a
family of three young girls. His old Surf Club and beach sprinting days "are over",
says Bill, but the surf and beach are still his choice and living at Manly gives him
easy access to this relaxation whenever the opportunity happens along.

MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
MERVYN JONES,
C.S.R. BUILDING MATERIALS
DIVISION EXPERT.
Following In the footsteps of four pre-
vious generations it was decided on
leaving school that Mervyn Jones could
not do better than to carry on the tra-
dition of the others who had helped in
the growth of the building industry in
Australia. With the help of his father,
who was Supervisor of Building at the
Sydney Technical College (William
Ernest Jones), he found the life most
interesting and at all times, particularly
in watching the growth of a building
from its foundations to its roof.
In the course of this journey he natur-
ally derived lots of help from master
builders for whom he worked and archi-
tects in the city of Sydney. He has now
thrown in his lot with the Building Ma-
terials Division of The Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. Ltd. in order to assist in
introducing their new and wonderful
materials to the building industry of
Australia.
With this object in view the Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. arranged for him to
visit America and England to see how
these materials are used and applied in
those places. This journey was most
exciting and informative.
Speaking of his tour, he said "the
noticeable difference in the house con-
struction of America is that most houses
are timber faced and the brick cavity
wall construction as we know it in Aus-
tralia is practically unknown.
It was interesting to see these timber
framed buildings covered on the outside
with asbestos sheets or asbestos shingles
and lined on the inside with gypsum wall-
board such as we are introducing in
Australia today. It was Interesting also
to visit one building project of 16,000
houses being erected by the one build-
ing firm as a speculation. In addition
to these almost anywhere in America
other projects of 400 and 500 houses
can be seen daily.
Sometimes we imagine that timber
such as Oregon in America should be
very much cheaper than in Australia,
but we note that the distance from San
Francisco to New York is approximately
the same as that from San Francisco to
Sydney, and therefore the people in
New York have very little advantage
over the people on the east coast of
Australia regarding timber costs except-
ing of course, for any duty charged on
timber entering Australia.
There appears to be a housing short-
age in America just the same as In Aus-
tralia and England. It was noticed in
England that the dwellings were gener-
ally constructed of brick and very little
timber frame construction is seen but
gypsum wallboard is certainly a very
popular material for the lining of ceil-
ings, partition walls and the like.
Today, however, it is customary for
some local authority like London County
Council to arrange for the construction
of housing developments and it is stated
that only about one dwelling in ten is
erected by a private owner for his own
use.
On returning to Australia after five
months of travel it appears to me that
there is considerable scope for build-
ings of all kinds and I think the materials
now being produced by the Building
Materials Division of this Company will
help in many ways to provide the hous-
ing that is badly needed and particular-
ly in those areas further away from the
central city."

Fifteen years ago Margaret Merivale
wrote “Furnishing The Small Home.”
Much has taken place in the intervene
ing years in the evolution of home
furnishing and accessories so she thinks
it quite time to restate her case in
Volume 11.
Restriction of space, shortage of
home help, the high cost of materials
and labour have all played their part
in bringing about many changes,
which provide new opportunities for
the home-maker and take into account
the new conditions of our times. The
basic principles of furnishing must
ever remain the same, centred around
the needs, purse and preferences of
the individual, but today the choice
is much wider, with more opportun-
ities both for success and failure, and
careful thought in advance is more
than ever necessary.
Miss Merivale must speak from ex-
perience when, she says “Furnishing
a home —large or small —can be tre-
mendous fun or a complete nightmare
to those undertaking it for the first
time. Everything depends on the
right approach. Knowing what you
want is the key and it is to help in
the crystallisation of ideas that this
book is directed. To some, she says,
the illustrations may be too “modern”
and to others not modern enough, but
in the selection the yardstick has been
suitability for the small home. The
scope of the illustrations, although
perhaps somewhat limited in compar-
ison with more ambitious proposals,
cover living in one room, a bedroom
by night, and a lounge by day; ideas
for lounge, bedroom, kitchen; heat-
ing by electricity or gas; light fit-
tings; the infinite variety of printed
fabrics; Scandinavian and American
ideas; tableware, glass and cutlery.
22/6 well-spent to any young couple
about to furnish their home.
The British Government has begun
the building the world’s first full-scale
atom power station at Sellafield, Cum-
berland.
The site is alongside the existing
£ 10,000,000 plutonium production
plant.
When the new atom-power station
goes into operation, it is expected to
supply electricity to a wide area.

Fifty Years of Liverpool Cathedral
SIR GILES GILBERT SCOTT REMINISCES.
Fifty years ago last May—in 1903 —
the design by Mr. Giles Gilbert Scott
was placed first in a competition for
the new Anglican Cathedral in Liver-
pool. Work was begun in the same
year and since then —even during
World Wars I. and 11., the great
structure has grown year by year, un-
til today it is very nearly completed.
When Sir Giles won the competi-
tion he was 22 years of age and the
assessors, in view of his extreme youth,
associated one of their number, Mr.
G. F. Bodley, R.A., with Mr. Scott,
an arrangement that continued until
1907 when he died and Sir Giles was
appointed sole architect. Since then
he has had the one continuous job in
his office —together with countless
others—and has had the unique priv-
ilege of seeing the building grow un-
der his guidance over the past half
century.
Sir Giles is now 75 and there re-
mains three bays of the west end to
be completed so if there are no major
interruptions he may have the unique
privilege of being the only man to
see a great cathedral built in his life-
time. Sir Christopher Wren was as-
sociated with St. Pauls for over forty
years and was deprived of his survey-
orship before the building was finish-
ed though he lived another eight
years.
The great central tower of Liver-
pool Cathedral, which is 308 feet
high has a “batter” or slight slope in-
wards of 1 in 80 in all its verticals. “I
would never build a tower without a
batter on it,” said Sir Giles, “because
it enormously improves the appear-
ance of the tower.”
Some of the masons have worked
on the job for more than forty years
and are “grand craftsmen.” All the
stone which has a reddish tinge comes
from the Woolton quarry which is
owned by the cathedral authorities,
and it has weathered extremely well.
The building is built entirely on rock
and there has been scarcely any sign
of settlement in its huge bulk beyond
a few tiny hair-cracks in the tower.
The great stone vaults to the nave
have a span of 72 feet, being almost
as big a Gothic span as exists any-
where and it was constructed without
any modern assistance in the way of
concrete or steel reinforcement.
When the King visited the work
during the war after it had been dam-
aged by bombing, he was greatly im-
pressed by the fact that in spite of all
the destruction going on that they
were still building. He said: “Keep
on with the work. There is great
moral value in that; refuse to be beat-
en”!
YANKEES ARE ENGLISH.
Americans are called Yankees for
this reason. It is a corruption of
Yengeeze, which was the nearest that
the Indians’ tongues could get to
English, in the old colonising days.
They called the English in America
the “Yengeeze.”
Lord Nelson rests in the crypt of
St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. The
Sarcophagus which contains his coffin,
strange to say, was made at the ex-
pense of Cardinal Wolsey for the
burial of Henry VIII.
Jump in building prices in Britain
may add <£25,000,000 to the cost of
the 14 new towns planned by the
Government.

N.S.W. BUILDING FIGURES
DECLINE OF £26,957,000 IN 1952.
Total Building Returns for 1952 just to hand from the N.S.W. Bureau of Statistics and Economics show a decline
of <£26,957,000, in the amount spent on building work in 1952 as against the previous peak year of 1951. Figures were:
1951, £75,875,000, and 1952, £48,918,000. In spite of this fact 2508 more houses and flats were actually completed
in the year 1952 than in 1951, relevant figures being: 1951, 12,438, and 1952, 14,946.
That building is picking up is evidenced by a study of the figures for the first quarter of 1953 which are
£14,492,000, which is greater than the first quarter of 1952 when the figure was £12.371,000. Houses and flats com-
pleted in the first quarter of 1953 at 3707 are also in excess of the comparable 1952 figure of 3687.

New Tasmanian Industry
LOCAL HARDBOARD REPLACES IMPORTED.
In the first three months of 1952,
Australia imported some 40,000,000
square feet of hardboard. By the be'
ginning of this year, imports of hard'
board had dropped to an almost neg'
ligible quantity, although the demand
for the material increased.
The enterprise shown by Masonite
and C. S. R. has supplied N. S. W.
and Queensland for many years. Tas'
mania is now producing hardboard, a
material that has grown increasingly in
demand throughout the whole world
since first introduced less than 30
years ago.
Owned and operated by Paper
Makers Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of As'
sociated Pulp and Paper Mills, the
Burnie hardboard mill (see illustra'
tion, top}, is a clean lined, modern
factory that has been in operation
only since Tune, 1951.
It is a component part of a huge
industrial enterprise on which the life
and prosperity of Burnie have come
to depend increasingly; an enterprise
which represents the effective and
scientific use of that important section
of Australia s timber resources that
lies in north'west Tasmania.
The organisation is planned on the
basis of careful and steady regenera'
tion and extension of the forests from
which come the raw material used—
wood.
Unique Features.
The mill is based upon modern
Swedish design, and incorporates
many architectural features unique in
Australian factories. For the past two
years it has been producing nearly
half a million square feet of hard'
board a week, using a process first
evolved in Sweden.
The Burnie mill is also experiment'
ing with production of an oil temper'
ed hardboard for use outdoors where
extra waterproofing is necessary.
Working 24 hours a day, from
midnight Sunday to midday Saturday,
this mill turns out hardboard sheets
measuring 18ft. by 4ft. at the rate of
one a minute.
The operation is almost entirely
mechanical.
Burnie hardboard is already a fea'
ture in the building and hardware
trades, and wide distribution is being
made in Victoria, Tasmania, South
Australia and Western Australia.
It is interesting to note that a
pulp and paper mill requires about
40 gallons of water for every pound
of paper made. Associated Pulp and
Paper Mills have their own supply
and use over seven million gallons of
purified water per day.
The various mill buildings cover
nine and a half acres. Fourteen sep'
arate routine tests are carried out on
the papers produced, and 43 tests in
the Pulp mill. Plant and equipment
includes 800 electric motors and 380
pumps.
The company’s forests provide the
mills with 100,000 tons of Eucalypt
pulpwood per year. Foresty conserva'
tion methods ensure replacement of
trees and perpetual supply.
Laminated Timber
Construction
Importance Increasing.
Laminated timber construction was
playing an increasingly important part
in modern building practices, accord'
ing to Mr. Colin Davis. Director of
the Australian Timber Development
Association, who said that with the
advent of modern waterproof glues
and the strength that is developed
with them this type of construction
promises to be one of the most revo'
lutionary moves in the history of tinv
ber.
The name laminated truly suggests
that it is the bonding together of a
series of thin strips of timber to form
any required shape.
The advantages of laminated con-
struction are;
Because seasoned timber shows an
alhround increase of 50% approxi'
mately in its strength properties com-
pared with its green state, it is, there'
fore, justifiable to make a smaller sec'
tion to withstand the same load as a
green section under equal conditions
of loading. Any desired shape or size
can be made. Small dimension stock,
otherwise unsuitable for structural
purposes can be utilised. The sections
can be built up to give high strength
where required. Because many of the
sections can be built in one single
piece thereby eliminating intricate
framing, the structure can be prebuilt
and then merely lifted into position.
As the timber is selected in small sec'
tions it is possible to eliminate all
sources of weakness such as knots,
cross grain, pipes, decay, seasoning de'
fects, etc., which often occur and can'
not be avoided in large natural sec'
tions. In conunction with split ring
connectors curved members can be
used in the top chord of trusses, etc.

Highest Building Cost Ever
COMPLETIONS ALSO NEAR RECORD.
Water Board Building Figures.
The number of new buildings com'
pleted within the Board’s area for the
twelve months ending June 30, 1953,
was 14,768, the cost thereof being
£45,985,598, whilst alterations and/or
additions were carried out to 2,235
existing buildings at a cost of
£5,937,734, the total jobs completed
thus being 17,003 at a cost of
£51,923,332. The number of build'
ings completed takes second place to
that for the preceding twelve months
when the record number of 17,095
jobs were completed. The cost, how-
ever, is the highest ever recorded and
sFiows an increase of 13% over the
previous figure of £46,118,991. The
average cost per job was £3,053. which
compares with £2,698, £2,431, and
£1,999 for the years 1952, 1951, and
1950, showing an increase in average
cost of 53% over this triennial per'
iod.
Homes 91%.
The erection of homes still con'
tinues to dominate the building activ-
ities, 15,527 having been erected or
altered, representing 91% of the total
buildings completed. For the three
previous years the figures unde, this
category were 15,806, 12,954 and
12,789, the respective percentage of
the yearly total being 92, 92 and 94.
The Housing Commission of
N.S.W. has once again contributed
substantially towards the number of
homes erected, 2,097 cottages and 34
blocks of flats, comprising 453 units
erected by this Authority having been
rated by the Board.
The number of buildings erected
or altered in the City of Sydney was
204 at a cost of £2,328,895, whilst
16,799 were completed in the other
areas for £49,594,437. During the
first half of the year 8,090 jobs were
completed at a cost of £24,746,554
whilst in the second half 8,913 were
completed for £27,176,778.
The payment of a building fee is
usually the first intimation to the
Board that building operations are
about to commence. Although the
number of fees paid has fallen from
19,906 for the twelve months ended
30th June, 1950, and 21,609 for
1951 to 15,513 for the current year,
the number of buildings completed is
only 92 below the highest figure at'
tained. This is probably the result
of a more economic distribution of
manpower and materials permitting a
speedier completion of work than for'
merly. There is still a great number
of outstanding fees for which the
buildings have not been completed
and it would normally be expected
that as this backlog is overtaken, the
number of jobs completed should fob
low the downward trend evidenced by
the payment of building fees as indb
cated above. The last five months of
the year, however, have shown a
steady increase in the number of fees
paid which may serve somewhat to ar'
rest this tendency.
The following indicates the num-
ber of buildings completed and the
cost thereof each year since 1914:

Dream City Rises
In Punjab
Ambitious Indian Government
Project.
In the heart of the Punjab, India,
near the foothills of the Himalayas,
30,000 labourers are building Chand-
igarh, which will be the world’s most
modern city.
Here, in the burning sunshine, wo-
men in bright saris are pouring con-
crete into wooden formes, while end-
less lines of men shovel out founda-
tions, and dig trenches in the rocky
soil of the desolate plain.
The Indian Government selected
Chandigarh in 1950 as the site for a
new Punjab capital, and allocated
167.000,000 rupees (about £A 15,700,-
000) for the huge project.
Famous Architect.
To plan and lay it out, the Gov-
ernment engaged one of the world’s
most famous city planners: Charles
Edward Jeanneret, better known as Le
Corbusier, France’s ageing (65)
stormy petrel of architecture.
For the man who has spent his
career condemning the world’s cities,
the invitation presented Le Corbusier
with the chance of a lifetime.
He envisages Chandigarh (popula-
tion 150,000) as a magnificent ville
verte (green city)—of 14 square miles
of gardens and buildings, with r cen-
tre complex of government buildings
surrounded by 25 self-contained resi-
dential sectors.
Each sector will have its own bazaar,
clinic, nursery, school, bank, cinema,
police station, swimming pool, and will
include 128 houses built according to
13 different designs.
Dream Houses.
Even the cheapest of the houses
are something beyond the wildest
dreams of the average Indian family.
Made of clay, hand-made bricks,
and concrete slabs, they are to cost
only £A2BO each. They will com-
prise two rooms, separate bathroom
and lavatory, porch, courtyard garden,
and a separate kitchen with running
water.
To keep cool in summer and warm
in winter, each house will have what
Le Corbusier calls “sunbreakers”—
deeply recessed windows that will keep
out the sun’s hot rays when it is di-
rectly overhead, but will allow them
to enter when the sun moves south-
ward later in the year.
Separate Roads.
Long lines of labourers have already
spread smoking tar on the seven dif-
ferent types of road, criss-rossing the
new city like a w-affle-grid.
There will be separate roads for
children, for bicycles, pedestrians, and
cars.
All fast, cross-city arteries are sunk
14 feet below the ground level to hide
the traffic and reduce the noise, and
will have bridges for pedestrians to
cross safely.
According to Le Corbusier, “the
system will restore to the pedestrian
the dignity and peace of mind of
which the modern city has deprived
him.”
Scheme Progresses.
Le Corbusier recently completed
his fifth inspection trip to India, and
was reported to be extremely pleased
with the progress of the scheme to
date.
In three years of work 1000 houses
have been built on the dusty plain,
and another 2000 are to be finished
next winter.
The main road scheme has been
bulldozed out, the parks have been
laid out, and trees are being planted.
By 1956, Le Corbusier claims, Chan-
digarh should be a “dream city” com-
plete down to the tiniest detail.
Building Operations in Queensland
CURRENT BUILDING MEETING DEMAND.
The number of dwellings commenc-
ed in Queensland in the March quart-
er of 1953 was 2,165, an increase of
79 on the total for the preceding
quarter, but 788 less than in the Sep-
tember quarter of 1952. The num-
bers of houses commenced in the two
most recent quarters are approximate-
ly equal to the number required to
meet the State’s current needs on ac-
count of population growth. The
higher figures for earlier quarters were
occasioned by the need to make up
the deficiency in housing caused by
the almost complete cessation of build-
ing during the recent war, as well as
providing for the State’s current pop-
ulation growth.
Completion of new dwellings in the
March quarter were still showing the
effects of the high rate of commence-
ments in earlier quarters, and, total-
ling 2,483, they exceeded the current
quarter’s commencements by 318.
They were, nevertheless, 201 less than
in the December quarter of 1952, and
nearly 400 less than in each of the
two preceding quarters.
In the latest quarter, all districts in
the State showed figures very similar
to those for the December quarter of
1952 for dwellings commenced. For
completions the decrease was confin-
ed to the provincial and rural areas,
the number of completions of dwel-
lings in Brisbane showing a slight in-
crease.
By the end of March. 1953, 1,372
imported prefabricated dwellings had
been erected, and 835 were still in
the process of erection. The erection
of 121 of these dwellings had been
started within the three months ended
March, 1953, and 351 were complet-
ed during the same period.
The value of all building work
completed was £7,3 32,000, compared
with £8,533,000 in the December
quarter of 1952. Dwellings complet-
ed were worth £4,807,000, almost the
same figure as in the previous quarter,
but other new buildings to the value
of £1,193,000 were valued at £BOO,OOO
less than the very high figure recorded
in the last quarter of 1952. This
was, however, only the third occasion
on which the quarterly value of com-
pleted new buildings other than dwel-
lings had exceeded £1,000,000. Alter-
ations, and maintenance, etc., were es-
timated to be worth £1,332,000, com-
pared with £1,641,000 in the previous
quarter.
The total number of workers en-
gaged in the building industry at 31st
March, 1953, was 19,888, of whom it
was estimated that 9,801 were employ-
ed on new dwellings, 3,122 on other
new buildings, and 6,965 on altera-
tions, maintenance, etc. Nearly one-
half were described as carpenters,
2,787 as builders" labourers, and about
2,000 each as painters and plumbers.
The following table summarises the
progress of the building of dwellings
in Queensland since the beginning of
1946:

Movable Houses
in U.S.A.
New Building Development Tested.
Keeping a jump ahead of compete
tion in the housing field, U.S. design'
ers have now come up with the “Re-
locatable House,” which can be mov-
ed quickly and cheaply from one place
to another.
A trial run programme in U.S.A.
recently tested eight housing systems,
and the results showed that relocatable
housing can be “competitive in quah
ity, livability, and price to fixed-to-site
housing.”
A report submitted recently to the
U.S. Government Housing Agency
said:
• Relocatable housing can be econ-
omically moved to other areas if the
housing needs diminish at the first
location.
• Industry can now produce this
type of housing in significant quant'
ities with available facilities.
• Relocatable housing is feasible at
reasonable rentals, and the cost of re'
locating the houses in project quant-
ities averages $766 (iA.350/11/8),
requiring only 180 man-hours per
house.
Need of Relocation.
The need for relocatable houses
stemmed from expansion in the U.S.
of military and other defence installa-
tions, the report stated.
Certain areas have developed a criti-
cal need for good family housing, but
the banks do not agree that the need
will exist there for the 20 or 30 years
sufficient to repay loans.
Temporary housing has been found
to be a poor solution; maintenance
costs have been high and development
standards have been low. The best
solution offered U.S. housing author-
ities to date appears to be relocatable
houses which can be built inexpen-
sively and moved to other areas if
necessary (see illustration).
Average size of the relocatable
houses in the trial run was 852 sq.
ft. of floor area. Sises ranged from
768 sq. ft. to 1045 sq. ft. The aver-
age estimated cost in project quant-
ities of 100 units was $7747 (£A3551/
4/2) including 100 miles of tran-
sportation but not including the cost
of land.
ANGLE LANDING DECKS.
Australian aircraft carriers are to be
altered to provide angled landing
decks, on lines devised by Britain and
now being developed in U.K. and
U.S.A. Aircraft land and take off
from runways set at 8 degrees to fore'
and-aft line, which is equivalent to
increasing length 40%.
BUILDING AND MOVING HOUSES,

Typical of the Relocatable houses tested
in the U.S. is this model produced by
Pressed Steel Car Co. It comprises two
bedrooms, living room, dining room,
kitchen, bathroom, and occupies an
area 38 ft. by 30 ft. Reassembled the

PRESTRESSED CONCRETE SYMPOSIUM
OFFICIAL OPENING BY Dr. L. F. LODER.
Large Gathering of Engineers.
There was standing room only in
the Stawell Memorial Hall at the
Royal Australian College of Physicians,
145 Macquarie Street, Sydney, when
the Prestressed Concrete Symposium
was officially opened by Dr. L. F.
Loder, C.8.E., Director General of
Public Works, on June 30 at 10 a.m.
Dr. Loder, while saying that pre-
stressed roncrete undoubtedly had
great possibilities for structural en-
gineers, also gave a note of warning
in. the form of a story of the young
enthssiastic son of an old farmer who
was urging new and better methods
on his father, who enigmatically re-
plied: “Yes, son, but I don’t farm
half as well as I know how now!”
He expressed the opinion that the
practice of mixing and placing con-
crete in this country, generally speak-
ing, was deplorable: engineers must
insist that all concrete work must be
properly done.
Prestressing was not the answer to
all concrete problems, no more than
was any other structural systems; an
engineer should obtain complete data
on the requirements and performance
of each particular job and then utilise
the best means —concrete, steel, tim-
ber, etc. —of fulfilling these require-
ments.
He exhorted engineers to all look
to the field work and not remain im-
mersed in calculations and quoted the
following extract from the paper to
be be delivered by Mr. K. R. Banks:
“AH the knowledge, care and trouble
exercised by the design in calculating
the stresses and in choosing the mix
proportions and methods of manufac-
ture can be comnletely wasted by a
lapse in supervision and craftsmanship
lasting not more than a few minutes.”
Use in Britain.
Mr. D. Yates, President of the
Cement 6? Concrete Association of
Australia, which has organised the
Symposium, in his remarks said that
the development of prestressed con-
crete marks a new era in the use of
concrete just as did the introduction
of steel reinforcement,
Mr. T. J. Cavanagh, Director of
the Association, said that to-day in
Great Britain 15% of concrete work
carried out is prestressed and some
12,000 tons of special prestressing steel
is used. The new hangars at London
Airport are perhaps the most striking
example to date. American interest
was quickening and a six-storey car
parking building at San Francisco is
being erected by this method.
Lecture Programme.
The Symposium continued the rest
of that day and all the next, the fol-
lowing papers being delivered:

TEN SHORT YEARS.
Do We Remember?
To-day, Britain is gay with flaps
and bunting. But a bare ten years
ago the streets of her towns and cities
were shuttered, sandbagged and shrap-
nel - scarred, with static water-tanks or
air-raid shelters standing at every turn.
Though the shattering defeat of the
Afrika Korps by the men of the Eighth
Army had given the first real glimpse
of ultimate victory, that triumph seem-
ed still a depressingly long distance
away. Peace was only a pleasant vista,
and war remained the grim reality of
the time.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
BUILDING INDUSTRY ACTIVE.
“Face-Lifting" Operations.
With the freeing of commercial
building from restrictions, “face ' lift'
ing” has developed in a few months
into big business in the building field.
Faraway House, in Franklin Street, is
one of the first renovations of older
buildings to be completed. Formerly
part of a large holding occupied by
Walter 6? Morris Ltd., it was recently
bought by the pastoral firm of A. J.
G? P. A Mcßride Ltd., and owes its
new name to the first station —Far'
away Hill—owned by the late A, J.
Mcßride. The alterations, planned by
Dean W. Berry and Gilbert, and car'
■ried out by Hansen & Yuncken, in-
dude a modern frontage with terra
cotta tiled entrance, and facade of pale
green tiles.
The city’s biggest reconstruction
job, the renovation of the three'Storey
Covent Garden restaurant building for
new premises for the Commercial
Banking Company of Sydney, began
long before building restrictions were
lifted, and is expected to be com'
pleted before the end of the year.
The disastrous fire of October, 1948,
left only a blackened shell, which re'
mained an eyesore in the city’s main
thoroughfare until the work of re'
building began two years ago. The
work involves something near the con'
struction of an entire building.
Woods, Bagot 6? Laybourne Smith are
the architects, and S. J. Weir the
contractor.
Work on the addition of a fourth
story to the Norwich Union Building,
on the corner of Waymouth and
Bentham Streets, is about half' com'
pleted, and should be finished by the
end of the year. This job, on a
building abutting the footpath on the
corner of two busy streets, has in'
volved special problems in the demo'
lition of the cornice and front para'
pet. Tubular steel scaffolding, with
overhead protection at street level, was
erected along the entire two sides, and
an enclosed chute for the removal of
debris from the top to street level was
provided.
The extra storey covers the entire
7500 sq ,ft. of the building, and goes
Straight on top of the previous flat
roof, which, with the former roof
covering removed, serves as a floor
for the new storey. The building
was planned for two extra floors by
the architect. F. K. Milne, when it
was built in 1932, but the present
floor will be finished with a pitched
roof of asbestos cement. The work
includes reconditioning and redecorat'
ing throughout the building, partition'
ing in the new floor, rockwool ceiling
insulation, and raising of the lift
house above the new roof level to
take a modern elevator. William
Essery 6? Sons have the £50,000 con'
tract.
Another building soon to be “face'
lifted" is the Cavendish Chambers in
Grenfell Street. This was bought by
the Union Insurance Society of Can'
ton in 1950 ,and is soon to have its
street frontage modernised and its
public portions redecorated. In com'
mon with the Society’s Australian and
overseas buildings, it will then be re'
named Union Building. Caradoc
Ashton. Fisher, Woodhead and
Beaumont Smith are the architects.
Renovation of city, suburban and
country hotels, although the jobs are
not large in themselves, is approach'
ing big business in the aggregate. Up
to a dozen £5OOO to £lO,OOO con'
tracts are being let every month, and
the total of hotel renovation work in
the few months since building restric'
tions went off is well into six figures.
New Hotel Ideas.
A new and interesting hotel job for
which tenders close this month with
P. R. Claridge and Gunn is the Lox-

usual features in the design include a
receiving platform from which goods
will be delivered to a basement cover'
ing the entire area by electric hoist;
a central ceiling, following the shape
of the bar, dropped below the main
ceiling to provide a quick discharge
of air to six syphonator air vents;

tiled spaces for floral displays along
the frontage; and heat'resisting glass
over the whole of the bar counter.
Windows, which form a major part of
the frontage, will be mechanically
operated to open and close simuh

THE OPEN FIREPLACE.
Even in these days of electric and gas fires that operate at the touch of a switch
or tap, there are still plenty of people who are prepared to undertake the extra
work involved in an open fireplace because they enjoy the fascination of this live
heat. The problem of flying sparks has been cleverly tackled in these four Ameri-
can examples by firescreens so designed and contrived that they in no wise detract
from the appearance or efficacy of the open fire. Top left has a huge kitchen-like
canopy with a neat flyscreen with hinged doors. Top right is a more sedate
example in the main bedroom of a large home which has a similar type of screen.
In the two lower examples the problem is tackled in a different way with a flexible
curtain-like screen made of chain wire, rather in the manner of the chain armour
worn in days gone by and formed by a series of interlocking rings. This arrests
the sparks but doesn't give the shut-in affect of the fixed screens.

Schools and Hospitals.
School and hospital work is resum-
ing with the new financial year. A
tender of about £50,000 by J. Grove
6? Sons for the new Minlaton High
School was accepted this month by
State Cabinet. The school, which
will accommodate 200 pupils, will
have five classrooms, two science
laboratories, a library and a domestic
science section. The same firm has
just completed a £37,000 addition to
the Mt. Barker Hospital, accommodat'
ing eleven beds and a kitchen block.
Tenders have closed for the £25,000'
odd Keith Hospital job, and a con'
tract is expected to be let this month.

the radio station and personnel of a
base to serve the northern areas of
the State, will be built of locally'
made clay bricks, for which a source
has been arranged for the job.
Commercial building is providing a
steady flow of contracts in the small
and medium field. A contract for
£6500 for a block of four shops at
Broadway, Glenelg, was let last month
to Webber 6? Williams. S. J. Weir
secured a contract, at £4500, for the
building portion of a milk depot at
Paringa Park. A contract for the first
portion of reconstruction of Paramount

MODERN FRENCH CLUB.
Although this is described as a new French Club if one closed one's eyes and allow-
ed the mind to drift back to one's childhood memories it would not require a
great deal of imagination to see in it the funny houses made of chocolate and
gingerbread for the wall in the foreground bears a striking resemblance of a crazy-
work quilt. The spiral staircase like a mechanised version of barley sugar, then
comes zig-zag windows with a peppermint walking stick hanging on the roof at
the far end. It presents a striking study whatever one's outlook, and leaves one
wondering what manner of people would occupy a building with such strange
contrasts.

secured the £4250 contract for new
offices and council chamber for the
Mallala District Council .replacing the
original office built in 1878. The new
building, of Mt. Lofty stone, with tiled
roof, will comprise general office, dis'
trict clerk’s office, meeting room and
strongroom. Tenders will be called
later for fitting of the building.
Building Cost Trends.
A pointer to building cost trends
for larger jobs is given in the accep'
tance of a tender by Emmett & Sons
for the two-storeyed office block at
Thebarton for the Alaska Ice Cream
Co. The figure is not disclosed, but
it is stated to be some thousands be'
low :he lowest tender received for the
same job in 1950, when the work was
shelved because of cost. The building,
of reinforced concrete and brick, will
make a handsome cornerstone to the
company’s plant. The modern ex'
terior involves extensive use of glass.
The building, which includes board
room and stores on the first floor, is
expected to be finished before the
end of the year, when the company’s
manufacturing steps up for the sum'
mer.
B.M.A. at Brougham Place.
Tenders will be called privately soon
for an institutional job of an unusual
kind. This is the conversion of a 10'
roomed house in Brougham Place,
North Adelaide, into the first unit of
the British Medical Hall, headquarters
of the S.A. Branch of the British
Medical Association. The first part of
the work will provide a board room,
council room and offices. The first ex'
tension will add a meeting hall to ac'
commodate 200, and three suites of
offices for doctors. Later still, the
building will be extended to include
more medical suites. McMichael &
Harris are the architects.
Contracts at the Woomera Long
Range Weapons Establishment during
the month comprise chiefly air'
conditioning and ventilation system
jobs, for buildings for personnel and
for delicate electronic equipment
which must be maintained at an even
temperature in the extreme conditions
of the north.
T. O’Connor & Sons secured a
£9OOO contract for a mechanical vem
dialing and hot water service, and
another for £7200 for a mechanical
ventilating system. A £9400 con'
tract for the supply and installation or
an ammonia refrigeration system went
to White Engineering Ltd., Beverley;
and another, for £B3OO, for the sup'
ply and erection of an evaporative
cooling and heating system to Unbe-
haun and Johnstone.
Other Works Department contracts
let during the month include one for
£14,889. for alterations to buildings in
L.R.W.E. installations at Salisbury, let
to Hansen 6? Yuncken, and a £13,000
job for the erection of a brick can-
teen and store building at West Eeach
Airport, let to Egarr 6? Sons. R. J.
Buddie, a local contractor, secured the
contract, at £7387, for the erection of
a brick airline terminal at Port Lin'
coin.
State Government Works.
State Government works have
brought few large contracts, the big'
gest being a £40,000 acceptance from
Wilckens and Burnside for the build'
ing of No. 2 pumping station for the
Mannum'Adelaide pipe line at Palmer.
This station, the first to be construct'
ed on the pipe line, will be of brick
and reinforced concrete. Tenders have
closed for the supply and erection of
a steel'framed asbestos cement sheath
ed compressor and winder house at
Radium Hill, and for the supply of
labour and materials for the placing
of about 2500 yards of reinforced con'
Crete at the uranium treatment works
at Port Pirie. The latter job is ex'
pected to cost about £50,000.
Cabinet acceptance of tenders for
these works is expected this month,
also for the £7o,ooo'odd work of ex'
cavating the Biscuit Flat and Bray
drains, for the Southeastern Drainage
Board.
Cement Still Short.
Cement deliveries are still lagging,
with a soaring of the demand to the
equivalent of eight bags a head a year
in S.A., claimed to be the world’s
highest rate. Production, though far
above previous years, is unable to
cope with this demand, with “teeth'
ing troubles” still delaying full pro'
duction by new plants. One firm
alone is 6000 tons behind with de'
liveries, and another is planning this
month to import Tasmanian cement,
at 3/' to 4/' a bag above the local
price, to cope with orders. Most
home'building demands are being met,
but the man who wants cement for
overdue jobs around the house is
going short.
In contrast with large jobs, for
which tendering is competitive, home'
building costs have risen in the past
year, according to figures released by
the State Government Statist. The
7318 new buildings completed in
the nine months to March cost
£19,500,000, in contrast to just over
£18,000,000 for 8085 new buildings
in 1951 - 52. Fewer men are working
in the industry 9424- —than at any
time since June, 1950. In June, 1951,
there were 10,268, and in June, 1952,
10,371.
High building costs and tightening
of finance have made home'building
clubs in Adelaide increasingly popular.
The S.A. Home'builders’ Club Inc.,
the oldest and largest in the State,
will be eight years old this month,
and is completing houses at the record
rate of one a week. It has built a
total of nearly 300 houses, has 50
under construction, a membership of
about 250, and owns equipment worth
about £lBOO.
Qualifications are simple but defi'
nite —members are rostered for duty
and are expected to work two days
each week. Every man must put in
200 hours’ work before he can re'
ceive club labour or hire equipment
on his own job. Each district has its
own foundation group, brickmaking
group, carpenters, plumbers, plasterers,
bricklayers, electricians and terrazzo
workers. The only work not done by
club labour is specialised plumbing,
which must be done by an authorised
tradesman under the Act.
The estimated building time for an
average five'roomed house is about
2400 hours. Savings on building costs
work out at about £2OOO on a £4OOO
house.

GIANT CRANE ON ULTIMO JOB
NATIONAL CASH REGISTER PROJECT STARTS.
Work is well under way on the foun-
dations of the new National Cash
Register Building at the corner of
Harris and Mary Ann Streets, Ultimo.
The contractors, H. W. Thompson
Pty. Ltd., Master Builders, last week
reported good progress on the first
phase of the project.
To facilitate construction of this
building (see illustration) the con-
tractors have erected a giant five-ton
crane on the site (see illustration).
This crane will remain in position
until the project is completed.
A feature of the crane is the hori-
zontal chord trusses designed by H.
W. Thompson Pty. Ltd. in conjunc-
frion with the State Lifts and Scaffold-
ing Department. This top bracing
for the towers is a new departure in
crane construction.
Another interesting feature of the
cranes is that H. W. Thompson
executives originally designed tipples
to carry ready-mixed concrete by
crane to all points of the job.
These ingenious tipples are now be-
ing used for every purpose on build-
ing jobs.
Our representative who visited the
Ultimo project last weet was greatly
impressed by the speed and efficiency
shown by wortmen in pouring foun-
dations with the tipples and the giant
crane with its 110 ft. jib.
The concrete was being mixed on
site and the huge tipples were being
swung with great accuracy and at
quiet intervals to the formes.
As a bystander commented: “They
could drop that concrete through the
eye of a needle!”
Control of iron and steel, with the
exception of tinplate, has ended in
Britain, because steel output is high
enough to meet all domestic demands
and provide more for export.
110 ft. JIB CRANE.
This giant crane dominates the skyline
at Ultimo, where H. W. Thompson Pty.
Ltd. is erecting the new National Cash
Register Co. Ltd. premises. The crane,
with its 110 ft. jib, bears a remarkable
resemblance to the one which occupies
pride of place on the Master Builders'
Association of N.S.W. Seal.

any roughness due to the water “lift-

Ammonia and hydrogen peroxide

industrial chemicals. Both chemicals
should be stored in a cool place when
not in use and as hydrogen peroxide

able to buy larger quantities than are
required for any particular job.
Bleaching of Wood
Details of Process.
In response to inquiries the Timber
Development Association of Australia
states that the following procedure
has been found to be suitable for
bleaching a wide range of timbers.
Dark coloured woods can be made sev-
eral shades lighter and light coloured
woods can be bleached to a “Blonde”
finish. There is no record of the
bleaching reagents interfering with
subsequent polishing operations.
The bleaching is effected by one oi
more applications of aqueous ammonia
followed by hydrogen peroxide. The
details are as follows:
Solution A. Aqueous ammonia—
made by diluting one part of 0.880
ammonia with 5 parts of water.
Solution B. Hydrogen peroxide—
this may be used in the concentrated
form (100 volumes) or if the mater-
ial is bleached readily it may be dilut-
ed up to 5 times with water.
Solution A is applied to the wood
by means of a swab or mop and is
immediately followed by Solution B
applied in a similar manner. The
article is allowed to dry thoroughly
and the above process repeated, if
necessary. If these two treatments
have not produced a marked reduction
in the colour intensity the colouring
agent is of a type which does not
bleach readily and further treatment
will have little effect. If the treatment
has been effective further applications
of Solution A and B may reduce still
further the colour of the wood.
After the article is thoroughly dry
3s should be lightly sanded to remove

Work is expected to begin in about
two months on a section of the new
Brisbane Building at the Civic Centre,
Canberra.
Mr. E. W. Andrew, who is associate
architect on the project with Mr. M. J.
Moir, of Canberra, announced last
week that construction would com'
mence when the working drawings
were completed, and the section would
be ready for occupation in about 18
months.
The building is designed for shops
on the lower ground floor and ground
floors, with offices on the first floor.
Shopping arcades are to be provided
on both the lower ground and ground
floor levels.
The outside of the Brisbane Build-
ing has been designed to harmonise
with the existing buildings in Civic
Centre, Mr. Andrew added.

Building In Australia
£284,450,000 Under Construction.
(From Our Canberra
Correspondent.)
Figures issued by the Common'
wealth Statistician last week give the
total value of buildings completed in
Australia during the quarter ended on
March 31, 1953, at £64,566,000,
whilst the value of all the buildings
under construction is estimated at
£284,450,000. Of these, buildings
commenced during the quarter were
valued at £54,529,000.
The figures relate to the operations
of private contractors. Government
authorities and owner'builders, and all
the values given exclude the value of
land and represent the estimated value
of buildings on completion.
Housing Predominates.
Of the total value of all new build'
ings, completed houses represented
£45,490,000 and numbered 18,055,
whilst houses commenced during the
March quarter numbered 16,316 and
were valued at £40,443,000. At the
end of March there were 71,704
houses under construction, totalling
£169,926,000 in value.

The peak in house construction was
reached in the March quarter of 1952,
both in regard to number and value
—85,464 houses of a total value of
£192,867,000. But the highest value
of other buildings under construction
was in the quarter ended June 30 last
year, when the total stood at
£125,534,000. The value compares
with £114,524,000 for the quarter
ended March last. The value of new
buildings other than houses commenc'
ed during that period was £14,086,000
and of the number completed
£19,076,000.
Factories: £31,295,000.
Among the new buildings under
construction at the end of the quarter
were factories valued at £31,295,000,
flats totalling £5,432,000 in value and
hotels, guest'houses, etc., totalling
£1,258,000.

Brick Production

7,000 Million Brick Target for 1953.
Disastrous Affect of “Penal
Taxation.”
"'There are good reasons for believ-
iiig that the 1953 output of bricks
will reach at least 7,000 millions —
adequate to meet the Government’s
estimated requirements for the year,
and some 378 million more than the
number produced during 1952,” de'
dared Mr. H. Halliday, 0.8. E., Dh
rector of The National Federation of
Clay Industries, Great Britain, in a
recent statement.
Recent comments that the brick
industry needed help in the form of
Government loans, or subsidies, did
not reflect the general opinion of the
industry, he said. Manufacturers con-
sidered that the most effective help
the Government could give was sub-
stantial relief from the present penal
level of taxation.
“The industry's resources were sad'
ly depleted during the long period of
wartime closure; by the abnormally
heavy costs of bringing works back
into production; and by the effects of
the dislocations caused by the repeat'
ed changes in capital expenditure pro'
grammes during posPwar years. When
taxation demands have been met, there
is little left for costs of maintenance

“The position is further aggravat-
ed,” continued Mr. Halliday, “by the
excess profits levy, based on bad stand-
ard periods, when production and de-
mand were low. Brickmaking is a
wasting asset industry i.e., it is living
on its mineral resources, and is being
called upon to use up its raw mater-

Twenty years ago “Plastics” was a
name that one used glibly but knew
little about. Today it is no exagger'
ation to state that every home, every
office, every car, plane and train con'
tains something fashioned from the
great and ever-increasing range of
man-made materials that are collective-
ly referred to as Plastics.
It is perhaps, not surprising there-
fore, that we now have a technical
book not for the craftsman but for
the “Home Craftsman,” which would
seem to indicate once and for all that
plastics have achieved the everyday
character of the older materials that
have been man’s servants over the cen-
turies.
No Tradition.
A man working in a traditional
craft —woodwork or metalwork—in-
herits a sense of the right use of ma-
terial which comes from thous-
ands of years of accumulated know-
ledge and trial and error. In plastics
this continuity is lacking, hence the
necessity for such a book. “In this
mass-produced age,” says the author,
“there is a great satisfaction, beyond
the pleasure of the work itself, in
making something unique which can-
not be bought in shops. Mass pro-
duction gives us things cheaply but,”
he continues with great wisdom, “it
cannot give us exactly what we want,
unless everybody else wants it too!”
The book follows the logical se-
quence of first describing plastics in
general with specific details of partic-
ular interest to the craftsman; then
starting from the very beginning it
covers the practical working of plastics
with hand tools; more advanced tech-
niques follow, culminating in the ap-
plication of light machines to plastics
work, both as a means of eliminating
drudgery and as a means of obtaining
effects almost impossible by hand
methods.
Wide Variety of Application.
Starting from a frontispiece depict'
ing a piece of sculpture in “Perspex”
one is amazed at the wide variety of
articles that can be produced from the
various plastics available.
Perhaps the most fascinating appli'
cation is the “blowing” and drawing
of perspex whereby bowls, light fit'
tings, cigarette boxes, buttons, door
handles, etc., are produced.
An interesting and useful book.
Baby carriage rack is a new feature
on the 42-passenger buses being built
in England for Christchurch, N.Z.
These “perambulator carriers,” fitted
to the rear of the buses, would be a
total loss on traffic of large Australian
cities.
RR Jeep developed in U.S.A. and
called Hy-Rail has bus body and flang-
ed wheels to keep it on the railway
tracks. Guide wheels are raised and
lowered hydraulically so jeep can
leave tracks and convenient point to

Is Planning Stifling Development ?
IMPACT OF PLANNING PROPOSALS FOR SYDNEY.
Notes from an address delivered by S. E. WILSON, a Councillor of The Retail
Traders' Association of N.S.W., as a Guest Speaker at the Australian Planning
Institute (Sydney Division) on 21st May, 1953.
[ln view of the widespread interest in this problem, upon which many and
varied views are held, these extracts are published for general interest. —Ed.]
Planning a great city is not a task
to be undertaken lightly, and already
there are many indications that not
sufficient attention has been given to
all aspects of the problem before the
plans for the County of Cumberland
were produced and before the plan
was prepared for the City of Sydney.
It is, of course, quite wrong to as-
sume that those of us who may be
heavily interested in city properties
and engaged in a variety of commer-
cial activities are simply opposed to
any form of planning. On the con-
trary, I believe the majority are con-
vinced that some intelligent and far-
sighted planning is essential. Errors
have been made in the past, but we
must take great care we do not do
hasty, ill-considered things costing mil-
lions of pounds and simply embark on
a policy of curtailing the city to over-
come some immediate problems, in-
stead of planning for normal expan-
sion of one of the greatest sea-port
cities in the Southern Hemisphere.
In raising some objections to a
specific plan for specific reasons, there-
fore, the business man must not be
regarded as a supporter of disorganised
chaos. Indeed, the business man
charged with the control of any sub-
stantial enterprise plans extensively. It
is a normal and necessary part of his
responsibility if he is to succeed, but
he rarely plans without exhaustive
consultation with architects, engineers,
lawyers, perhaps scientists, financiers
and, if necessary, governments, in an
endeavour to investigate his problems
as a whole. This, I suggest, is where
to some extent he differs from those
who have planned our city, and we
believe this is responsible for some of
the problems that have arisen.
The President of the Cumberland
County Council has said: “Representa-
tives of city business interests cannot
be adequate judges of the planning of
a city of 1700 square miles embracing
forty separate Councils.” With this,
city business interests will entirely
agree. They make no such claim.
But who is? Who is competent to
undertake the task without any con-
sultation whatever with the wide in-
terests affected? What consideration
are they in a position to give to the
economic consequences? The Presi-
dent of the Cumberland County Coun-
cil has himself stated that the City
Plan in its present form would upset
the balance of the County Plan. That
is not surprising when it is remem-
bered the Plan was prepared without
a searching investigation of its effect
on all aspects of the city.
Disastrous Economic
Consequences.
Briefly, many business men believe
the Plan will have disastrous economic
consequences. It will seriously retard
development and will impose the most
discriminatory and unfair burdens on
individual property owners without any
compensation whatever. They also
believe that such a far-reaching plan
should not be proceeded with until all
these and other aspects are fully in-
vestigated by a competent, indepen-
dent tribunal. Finally, they are not
satisfied the Plan will solve the city’s
principal problems. That, briefly, is
the attitude of many business interests.
We may first, perhaps, summarise
some of the principal factors which
encourage development. These are: —-
(a) Chances of success and a fair
reward.
(b) Suitability of area in relation
to production and distribution.
(c) Security.
(d) Freedom from disturbance.
(e) Opportunities to expand.
Most of us would probably concede
that an expanding economy is neces-
sary both for our survival and the
lifting of our living standard, and an
expanding economy presuppjoses maxi-
mum flexilibity and encouragement of
development.
The question, then, to which we
are asked to address ourselves is:
Does Planning Stifle Development?
If we confine ourselves to city plan-
ning, the question is not readily an-
swerable as one general proposition.
It is necessary, in my view, to ap-
proach it as applied in at least three
or four different sets of conditions: —
(a) As it affects an existing well-
developed large city such as
Sydney or some other State
capital.
(b) As it affects a partly-developed
town which may be foreseen
as a city of the future. For
example, on the North Coast;
in New England; or the
Riverina any one of which
may one day be a separate
State.
(c) As it affects a sparsely settled
territory, the geographic loca-
tion of which marks it out for
development as a city of the
future, for example, Canberra
or Darwin.
(d) Perhaps one other instance
may be a city devastated by
warfare which must be re-
built.
The answer to the question ob-
viously would vary and be qualified in
respect, of each case.
One may dispose of the last three
instances briefly. Clearly, in a partly-
developed town, planning could be
undertaken with minimum interference
with existing conditions and provision
could be made for zoning and expan-
sion on adjacent territory without any
serious interference with development.
Indeed, provided all factors were ade-
quately considered and the plan as-
sumed real permanency and was to
be implemented in reasonable stages,
it may assist orderly development and
add to security. The same comments
would apply with even less risk of
any resulting damage in the second
example—the sparsely-developed terri-
tory similar to the virtually uninhabit-
ed area which became Canberra; or
Darwin, which is the centre of an im-
mense, unsettled territory. If devas-
tation of a city demanded extensive re-
building, clearly any planning should
be undertaken and established so that
development and rebuilding could go
hand in hand.
Let us, therefore, attempt to confine
our examination to the first problem:
that of an existing well-developed large
city—our Sydney.
The Degree of Planning.
Again, the question raised by the
title of this discussion becomes one of
the degree to which the planning re-
casts the city and surrounding areas
and the degree to which industry and
capital investment in premises and
plant are disturbed, or threatened; the
degree to which expansion is curtailed
and rebuilding restricted.
A certain degree of planning might
well take place without serious dis-
turbance or interference with develop-
ment, but the approach to the prob-
lem would determine this question.
Broadly, it may depend on whether
the plan was primarily designed—
(a) to curtail and seriously re-cast
a city, its buildings and the
class of business activities per-
mitted, or
(b) with the deliberate objective of
leaving the city undisturbed
but relieve the pressure by en-
couraging expansion to outer
areas, improving transport
facilities and diverting great
streams of traffic to the outer
perimeter of the city.

Business men believe broadly that
the first proposition should not be at'
tempted until the second has been
completely exhausted. The cost fac'
tor alone in the former proposal may
well prove prohibitive. The questions
of how it is to be met and who finds
the money must certainly be among
the first to be examined and answered.
Now, what are some of the factors
in planning that are likely to con-
tribute to the stifling of development?
Let us examine some of the features
of planning with which we are faced
in the City of Sydney to'day. The
commercial area is definitely restricted.
The shopping area is restricted. The
industrial and warehouse area is re'
stricted. The present permissible floor
area of buildings is defined and in
many cases restricted upon rebuilding
to an area considerably less than
existing in some cases or permissible
under existing statutes and ordinances.
Considerable areas now being used
extensively for commercial and indus'
trial purposes become residential. The
types of industrial activity, particularly
in the commercial and shopping area,
are severely limited. Finally, anything
from 50 to 100 years would elapse
before the city would begin to assume
the replanned aspect. In the tram
sition period, development must be
stifled. Even now, since the County
of Cumberland Plan has been adopted
and published, there is grave danger
that detailed plans by municipalities
may alter the final Plan. The Fresh
dent of the Cumberland County Coum
cil has already drawn attention to the
probability of this disturbing position
arising from the City Plan.
Effect on Values.
What effect has such planning on
development? What result has it upon
values and, consequently, on the capi'
tal investment in city property? These
are very important questions.
The U.C.V. of the city at Ist
January, 1949. was £69,155,177, and
at Ist January, 1953, it had risen to
£104,164,430, representing an increase
of 50.62 per cent. But those values
are based largely upon sales, which in
turn are based on existing conditions.
It is reasonable to expect, therefore, a
substantial drop in the capital value of
city property faced with reductions of
floor space upon rebuilding. The
effect may be much quicker in the
case of older buildings.
A city property valued at
£1,000,000, of which £300,000 repre'
sented U.C.V. and £700,000 (he im'
provements, may, under the proposed
City Plan, lose 25 per cent, of its
floor area. There are many such cases
and some even more drastic. Clearly,
both the Improved Capital Value and
the Unimproved Capital Value are
likely to suffer in sympathy.
The chain of repercussions from the
Plan, therefore, becomes immediately
evident. As there is no question of
compensation, we are faced with;
(a) Loss of capital. The writing
off as a permanent loss of capi'
tal of that portion of its build'
ing which is affected by the
index and cannot consequently
be re'erected.
(b) Other assets and goodwill of a
business would require to be
dealt with on the assumption
that it is located in a contract'
ing area instead of an expand'
ing city.
(c) A considerable percentage of
the owner’s equity of a mort'
gaged property would inevit'
ably be lost. The mortgagee’s
security would shrink.
What is the probable effect of this
on an industry contemplating, for in'
stance, installation of new plant while
owning a building affected in this way?
What is the position of trustees with
millions of pounds of trust money in'
vested in assets which are depreciating
and only portion of which can be re-
placed?

Surely these are questions worthy
at least of investigation before a plan
is adopted.
Because of restricted space for some
activities there will be a tendency to
create premium values for some lands
purely because of their scarcity, making
fixed costs of business higher. This
will discourage enterprise and drive
business to other centres where there
is no planning or where such plan'
ning as may exist imposes less onerous
restrictions.
Building during the interim period
is fraught with so many dangers that
many enterprises will no doubt solve
this problem by simply avoiding this
city. Many old buildings now near'
ing the time when they should be re'
placed will now be shored'Up so that
rebuilding will be delayed as far as
possible owing to loss of floor space.
A general dilapidation of older, higher
buildings appears inevitable. Sites
purchased at high prices on which re-
building was contemplated are likely
to remain untouched. A serious dis'
turbance of confidence will immediate'
ly be reflected in a stagnant city real
estate market. The time factor is so
great that planning ahead for enter'
prises intelligently is rendered impos'
sible and far too risky.
We know, of course, that planning
authorities claim the “Valuer has no
place in city planning. That may be
correct, but he has a definite influence
on whether such altruistic planning is
likely to stifle development,
No Compensation,
One other highly important ques*
tion is that of the moral issue. Has
any section of the community a right
to interfere with and damage other
people’s property, causing great capital
loss without even a suggestion for
compensation? Such a proposal is
utterly immoral.
To avoid these consequences, many

of us believe that planning should be
approached from a different angle.
We believe that a guiding principle
should be, as far as possible, to leave
an established city undisturbed. Ac'
cept it as it is, but call in the em
gineers to give it the services it re'
quires. It is wrong to cut down the
city to make it comply with obsolete
and inadequate services. The first
concentration should be on areas
where buildings and dwellings are
sub'Slandard and where slums exist.
The main planning should be pri'
marily outside the city perimeter to
divert development and relieve city
pressure. We should plan the outer
areas and complete the services, high'
ways, power, light, water, sewerage
and telephones, and industry will
rapidly follow. We have done very
little but expect industry to go out as
pioneers and wait years even for ade'
quate roadways. Where are our Cir'
cular Highways as in Britain, the
Autobahns one sees in Germany, or
the Autostrada of Italy? The 1917
viaduct of the city railway is still un'
connected at Circular Quay, and tem'
porary trams still run on the Harbour
Bridge after nearly 25 years. Yet our
solution is to tear down and restrict
the city! We must reverse our pre'
sent process of settlement and indus'
try, pushing out first and waiting in'
terminable periods for even roadways.
We should plan and prepare to em
courage diversion within broadly de'
fined areas, not leave the pioneer to
struggle in the wilderness.
Exhaustive Examination
Required.
At the outset I stressed the fact
that business men do not set them'
selves up as experts to re'plan the city,
but perhaps these few viewpoints in'
dicate that many things require ex'
haustive investigation and considera'
tion before a comprehensive plan of
this nature should be allowed to affect
a great city. If serious economic con'
sequences have been overlooked in the
County of Cumberland and City of
Sydney Plans through lack of exhaus'
tive enquiry, it will not be the first
time planning has failed, nor is failure
confined to city planning. It is com'
mon where the planner goes ahead,
carried away with enthusiasm for his
particular science.
Even “planned food production”
has produced some disastrous results
which wider investigation at the be'
ginning may have avoided. The East
African Ground Nuts Scheme resulted
in a loss of £36,000,000; the Gambia
Poultry Scheme lost £825,000; and,
nearer home, the Peak Downs Project
in Queensland has lost £880,500.

SUPPORT THIS PURELY AUSTRALIAN COMPANY
Perhaps the people, who in the end
paid for this planning—the taxpayers
—would have been better off had
there been an infinitely more thorough
investigation before the plans were
adopted.
We have another planning lesson
to be learned from our own Depart-
ment of Post-War Reconstruction.
We all remember the extent to which
the planning was carried —the mag-
nificent blueprints —nearly all based
on secondary industry development.
But what has happened? Where are
the plans? Where, in fact, after seven
years, is the Department? Meanwhile
the emphasis from the Government
down has moved from planning secon-
dary industry development pn which
so much money was spent to expand-
ing production in primary industries,
which the planners overlooked. We,
in Sydney, must take care that our
Cumberland and City Plans do not
result in losses that will make mere
dwarfs of some of these other efforts.
But it is not too late. Now is the
time to estimate what the economic
consequences of this Plan will be. It
is vital that such an inquiry should be
undertaken. What is the cost? Who
is to bear it? Where is the money
t ocome from? Who pays for con-
verting Woolloomooloo to a residen-
tial area? It would be interesting to
have the views of the Maritime Ser-
vices Board and those who control
our shipping on the effect of the Plan
upon Sydney as a great seaport. Have
all the relevant facts been taken into
consideration? What is the view of
the Australian Naval authorities on a
residential area surrounding its great
graving dock, the deep anchorage in
Woolloomooloo Bay and its base on
Garden Island? There are many other
interested authorities whose views
would be pertinent.
So the business man who has to
safeguard investment and assets as well
as plan development merely asks that
when it comes to re-planning a whole
city after more than 160 years, no
plan of such a far-reaching nature
should be tolerated without the most
exhaustive investigation of its objec-
tives and consequences under every
heading. We are told by the Presi-
dent of the Cumberland County
Council that there can hardly be a
question of haste when the County of
Cumberland Plan, covering 1700
square miles, took three years to com-
plete. Well, let us pay tribute to it
as a monument of expedition. Prob-
lems of much less stature have fre-
quently taken as long as tha* to in-
vestigate let alone complete. For the
sake of a little time Sydney should
not be permitted to be restricted and
re-planned with possible grave conse-
quences without the most searching
and comprehensive inquiry.
NATURE'S RICHEST
STOREHOUSE.
Fabulous Future For Brazil.
General Marshall, the American
who devised the famous plan for aid-
ing Europe, has put it on record that
World War 11. could not have been
won without aid from Brazil.
The truth is, we can’t live in this
modern age—in peace or in war —
without steel. And without manganese
there would be no hard steel, the sort
of steel used in making tanks, guns,
and ships.
Russia thought she had almost a
monopoly of it. But it was discovered
not so many years ago that the south-
ern part of Brazil —the Amazon basin
—was incredibly rich in manganese,
and also in high-grade oil.
During the war, had it not been
for this Brazilian source, it is doubtful
if the U.S.A. and Britain could have
kept up such an enormous output of
armaments.
Brazil is Nature’s richest storehouse.
Nowhere else on earth can man hope
to find such an abundance of minerals.
The country is also the greatest
source of vegetable oils.
In the Peruvian portion of the Ama-
zon basin has been discovered the
Blue Goose Dome, one of the greatest
oil finds on earth. Half the country
is floating, on it, according to a recent
geological report.

New Oil Tank-
Building Technique
A new and improved method of
tank building is being used by Ampol
Petroleum Limited in the construction
of oil storage tanks at the company’s
Balmain, Sydney, and Newport, Mel'
bourne, terminals.
In effect, the tanks are being
“built from the top down.’’
Each tank is 47 feet high and has
a diameter of 30 feet and following
completion of the foundations, the
cone'shaped roof and top circular sec'
tion are completed and placed on top
of it. These are then lifted up and
the second circular section built on to
it, and so on until the tank reaches
its full height.
Cost of the new tanks will be much
cheaper than previously, while the
fob will be done much more quickly
too, as workmen will no longer be at
the mercy of the weather.
An important factor is screen
walls are no longer required by the
Explosives Department during con'
struction. These walls have been ne'
cessary to prevent explosions or fires
which might be caused during weld'
ing when such tanks are built near
existing petrol or oil storage tanks.
