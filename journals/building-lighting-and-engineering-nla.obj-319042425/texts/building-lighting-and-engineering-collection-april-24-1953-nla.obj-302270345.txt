THE ORANGE BOWL. FLORIDA
66,280 PEOPLE FROM THE AIR.
This remarkable picture was taken from 1000 feet directly over the Orange Bowl, Florida, on New
Year's Day, when the festive climax of America's college football season takes place. 66,280 people
were present to witness this event and to see the Orange Bowl Queen on her streamer-encircled
pedestal in the centre of the vast arena. America builds these huge arenas, as does South America
and Mexico, while we in Australia halt and muddle.

Royal Automobile Club of Queensland
NEW PARKING BUILDING.
By F. O. NIXON.
The official opening by the
Governor, Sir John Lavarack, of the
ground floor and earmarking building
above of the Royal Automobile Club
of Queensland at the corner of Water
and Quarry Streets, St. Paul’s Terrace,
Brisbane, took place on 14th March.
For a building, original in its park'
ing conception, the foundations make
ample provision for up to ten more
storeys; but even in its present extent
of ground floor, with open deck with
space for sixty cars on which to park
members’ cars, it is imposing in its
architectural features, a striking one
of which is its mushroom'headed
columns designed on the flat slab prim
ciple, thus eliminating beams and
allowing a reduction of floor'to'ceiling
clearance to 7ft. 9ins.
This reinforced concrete building,
with brick filling, was started when
steel beams were in very short supply;
but with the present improvement in
steel supplies the higher floors will
have a second choice. The area of the
building is 140 ft. x 120 ft. and, being
on a hillside, the one-way safety ramps
for both entrance and exit will come
from the levels of the higher street
frontage, the separate inward and out'
ward ramps thus rendering collisions
next to impossible. The low ceilings
of 7ft. 9ins. mentioned will favourably
affect the pitch of the ramps. The
flat reinforced roof of the present
building will become the floor of the
next storey, and so on.
Although the R.A.C.Q., as it is bet'
ter known, does not intend at present
to move from its Queen Street site to
the new building, there are provided
in the latter much which will not em
tail more than internal alterations to
bring the building right up to date
should such a move eventuate.
In the present set-up is a general
office, a petrol-filling station with
greasing and washing bays, a store and
spare parts section, dining-room for
both sexes, toilet block with carrier
system of mechanical ventilation. The
department for engine inspection and
consultation is on the higher frontage
of Water Street.
With the enormous growth of the
R.A.C.Q. such a building as this, with
its many services to its members, was
inescapable. Of the club’s fifty-nine
service vehicles, forty-five of them will
operate from this new building.
The architects for this structure are
the association of J. M. Collins, A. H.
Job and C. W. T. Fulton; the con'
tractors being M. R. Hornibrook Pty.
Ltd.
The following subcontractors were
associated with the work: Burley Elec'
trical Pty. Ltd., electricity; J. R.
Wyllie 6? Sons Pty. Ltd., plumbing;
J. McNiven, painting; Carrier Air'
Conditioning Ltd., ventilation; Roof 6?
Building Service Pty. Ltd. and
Neuchatel Asphalt Co. (Qld.) Pty.
Ltd., waterproofing.
Mr. Harold Montague Sandy,
chairman of directors of James
Sandy Pty. Ltd., who died sud'
denly in London on March 25
last, was a member of a noted
and respected family whose en'
deavours over the past century
have been closely allied to that
important branch of industry—
the Glass and Paint Trade—for
four generations.
Mr. Sandy was chairman of
directors of James Sandy Indus'
tries Ltd., James Sandy Pty. Ltd.,
paint and glass manufacturers,
and its subsidiaries, the Carter
Paint Pty. Ltd. and Wollongong
Glass Company.
Mr. Sandy won the M.C. dur'
ing World War I. He was a
keen golfer, and committeeman
of the Australian Golf Club for
11 years and captain for two.
He was a grandson of James
Sandy, the founder of the firm,
which celebrates its centenary this
month.
DESIGN OF THE MODERN
SCHOOL.
Excellent New Book.
“School Buildings, 1945-1951,” by
Bruce Martin. 128 pp. Pro'
fusely illustrated. Crosby Lock'
wood 6? Sons Ltd., London.
English price, 25/'.
In most countries of the world the
post'war years have been exceptional'
ly interesting and fruitful ones in the
history of school buildings, and no
country has made a more important
contribution in this field than Great
Britain.
As a result of six years of war and
huge bomb damage and the raising of
the schooMeaving age there was an
enormous volume of work to be un-
dertaken, and as the money available
had to be spent to the very best ad'
vantage every aspect of planning, con'
struction and materials came under the
closest scrutiny.
Bruce Martin, who has been con'
tinuously engaged since the war in
building some of the schools that have
attracted great attention in Britain and
also from overseas authorities, is well'
qualified to write this excellent book.
What Is A School?
To each person concerned with
schools, the school building assumes a
different form and each person tends
to see a single aspect of the whole.
To an educational administrator it
is a building of a certain cubic capacity
and area for a definite number of chib
dren and having a detailed schedule
of accommodation. The cost must not
exceed an amount determined by his
advisers and it must conform to the
current Regulations of the Ministry of
Education.
To a child it is a place where he
spends, some say, the best part of his
life, where he is both happy and miser'
able, where he grows up, where he
meets other children and his teachers,
where he can build sand castles, make
a noise and run about, and where he
learns to work, to think and to play.
To a teacher, the school building is
primarily a certain room where he en'
deavours to look after the needs of
forty children, where the chalkboard
is seldom at the correct height, the
lighting often poor, the chairs make
a noise on the floor and the blind'
cords break.
To a parent it is an assembly hall
with a platform at one end with a
child—his child—singing with others.
It is a place where he meets the head'
master and hears about his child from
the observations of others.
To a caretaker it is a problem of
have to keep everything clean, of
pipes that go rusty, hinges that squeak,

CITY OF SYDNEY PLANNING SCHEME
DRASTIC IMPLICATIONS ON CITY PROPERTIES.
Should the proposals relating to
“Bulk and Floor Space” of Buildings
as set forth in the City of Sydney
Planning Scheme become law it will
have serious repercussions upon
city property and will hamper or pre-
vent many important developmental
projects that are in train or in pros-
pect.
While existing buildings are not to
be interfered with, once any exten-
sions or alterations embracing addi-
tional bulk in floor space is envisaged
the new regulation would apply.
On first sight this may not ap-
pear to be serious, but once its impli-
cations are considered the outlook is
very different.
So that the impact of the proposed
new ordinance on any specific pro-
perty can be analysed we quote the
relevant extract from the Act and also
append the Maximum Floor Space
Index which is necessary for any com-
putation to be made.
A number of leading retail stores
have investigated the effect of the
new proposals upon their premises,
and one and all are alarmed at what
they find. We are indebted to
Anthony Hordern Sons Ltd., whose
Building Expert and Property Man-
ager had computed that with the ap-
plication of the rule that they would
only be entitled to 4.37 floors over
their site. While it is easy to say
that is all right because it doesn’t
apply to existing buildings, it would
be applicable to all sites that have not
as yet been developed and it is absurd
to try to hold back legitimate and
unpredictable progress in this ill-con-
sidered and mandatory manner.
The City Council can’t expect to
continually jack up values and ratings
on the one hand and perpetrate acts
on the other hand that depress the
value of city property by a more and
more restrictive policy that hampers
and stultifies natural and legitimate de-
velopment.
N.B. —Those whose properties are
affected should lodge their objections
by May 3, 1953.
CITY OF SYDNEY PLANNING
SCHEME.
Bulk and Floor Space of Buildings:
In the area of the city affected by
Part IV of the Ordinance, the floor
space in new buildings or existing
buildings to which it may be desired
to add, is to be restricted and calcu-
lated in the following manner:
Area of Site: Comprises the area
of the allotment, plus-— Area of road-
way contained in the space covered by
the frontage of the allotment multi-
plied by half the width of the street
(not in any case, to exceed 33ft. for
the half-width). In the case of blocks
with more than one frontage, there
shall be added to the area of the site,
a further rectangle for each addi-
tional frontage, calculated on the same
principle. (For full definition see
Schedule 7, Local Government Act.)
Permissible Floor Space: The per-
missible floor space is calculated by
multiplying the site area by the given
Index rate provided for the block in
which the particular allotment is sit-
uated.
Number of Floors: Divide the Per-
missible Floor Space by the Area of
the Allotment to show the number
of floors to be erected over the whole
of any allotment.
A greater number of floors may be
erected to the limit of 150 feet in
height if they do not cover the whole
of the allotment and so do not ex-
ceed in floor space the area arrived
at by multiplying the Site Area by
the Index Rate.
Existing Buildings: The floor space
shall be taken as the sum of the roof-
ed area of the building at each floor
level, including all wall thicknesses,
corridors, staircases, lift wells and
basements.
This part (Part IV.) shall not pre-
vent the re-building, restoration or
replacement of buildings which have
sustained war damage or damage by
fire, lightning storm or accident, ex-
cept operations of this kind involving
an increase in the size of the building
as it existed immediately before the
occurrence of the damage in such
cases, beyond the floor space as cal-
culated above for new buildings.
Index Rate: The Index Rating, ex-
tending from 1.1 to 6.0 and the rele-
vant blocks, numbering 85, are shown
on Plan 2 attached to the City Plan-
ning Scheme Ordinance. Particulars
taken therefrom are set forth here-
taken therefrom are set forth on the
opposite page.
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW
SULPHURIC PLANT.
Work will begin next month on the
building of a new £1,000,000 sulphuric
plant at Cockle Creek, near New-
castle.
The plant is to be built for the Sub
phide Corporation Pty. Ltd., and will
use local pyrites instead of sulphur
for making the acid.
IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW PLANNING PROPOSALS.
The black line drawn along the facade of Anthony Hordern & Sons Ltd. premises,
George, Goulburn, and Pitt Streets, Sydney, indicates the impact of the new pro-
posals if applied to a new building to be erected on this site and in respect of
which the Index Figure is 3.5. The resultant number of floors that would be per-
mitted over the site would be 4.37.

SUSPENDED ANIMATION AT THE QUAY
STATION JOB REMAINS AT STANDSTILL.
Although the Socialists’ preelection
promises hinted that work ‘ might’
recommence on the Circular Quay
Railway Station, the job this week
still presents a tragic picture of sus-
pended animation.
It is not as if electors were delud-
ed by the pie-crust pledges of Labour
politicians, of course, for the derelict
works (see illustration) act as a con-
stant reminder that our State Govern-
ment “keeps the word of promise to
the ear and breaks it to the hope.”
We can safely essay or surmise
that the growth of no other city in
the world is retarded (for reasons
political) as that of Sydney, and we
are sure that no other city on the
globe possesses a monument to the
inertia and torpor of its politicians.
We can also claim, without fear of
contradiction, that ways and means
could be found to complete the Cir-
cular Quay Station and Railway Loop
if the powers-that-be were only one
iota as sincere as they claim to be in
all matters appertaining to the ad-
vancement of the State.
Meanwhile the costly project stands
abandoned forlorn, and its very air
of dejection is transmitted to the
thousands who daily pass by it, and
under its arches to the ferries.
Costly cranes stand idle, neglected,
and other expensive equipment rusts,
uncared for.
In the course of time the wooden
f orm , WO rk will decay and collapse
(i n f ac t, there are signs of this al-
i y j r . l i . ,:ti u ~
r “ dv *- a " cl a tber cbaP ! er , ]1! b
added to the sorry history of the Quay
Ra. way Station.
If the Commissioner of Railways,
Mr. Windsor, wants to implement the
promises for better railway service
which he broadcasts over the commer-
cial radio stations, he should pay some
attention at least to the shocking waste
of public money on abandoned rail
works ’ such as Partly-completed sta-
tlo?s °" some th « s . uk “ rban ‘" es>
and, of course, the Socialist sepulchre
Q f forgotten promises at the Quay!

DISTINCTIVE AMERICAN HOSPITAL
View of the abandoned, derelict Quay Railway Station job, showing costly cranes standing idle, and expensive form-work exposed to all weathers.
Truly a sad picture of suspended animation on a project of State-wide importance.
This 120-bed hospital—the Jack-
son-Madison County Hospital in
Western Tennessee, U.S.A., was
completed in 1950. Large hori-
zontal concrete bands over the
window heads give continuous
shade and character to the de-
sign; the serrated "zipper-like"
affect at the corners is a strik-
ing foil to these heavy horizontals.

One Hundred Years In Australia
GLASS AND PAINT TRADE LEADERS AND PIONEERS.
James Sandy Pty. Ltd. Celebrate Centenary.
The originator of the firm, James
Sandy, arrived in Sydney by S.S.
“Queenstown” in January, 1852, and
until 1859 carried on business as a
hardware importer. He then bought
into a partnership with the firm of
James Leviet and Co., 261 George
St., Sydney.
He remained a partner in this
firm until 1872 when he purchased
what was considered in the Colony
at that time the “old-established”
firm of Thomas EdenS and Co., which
had carried on business since 1853 as
Oil and Colour, Glass and Wallpaper
merchants.
The name of the firm was then
changed to James Sandy and Co., and
a thriving business was carried on at
premises at 255 George St., with
twelve employees. In 1873, James
Montague Sandy, son of James Sandy,
joined the firm and the business con-
tinued to grow rapidly, and finding
the premises too small to meet the
expansion the firm moved to 271
George Street. In 1883 James Sandy
died, leaving the business to his son
J. M. Sandy.
In 1884, Mr. J. M. Sandy purchas-
ed a large Oil and Color merchant’s
business, and trade was carried on at
271 George Street, 330 George Street,
and at a bulk store at Millers Point.
A Mr. Baley was taken into the
business as partner, but the partner-
ship was dissolved in 1886; a Mr.
Lachan was then accepted into part-
nership in the business, but two years
later the partnership was dissolved
and a Mr. Cormack entered the bus-
iness as a partner.
At this time employees of the firm
numbered 45. During 1892 the firm
purchased the business of The Aus-
tralian Glass Co., and extended the
operations of the business to bevell-
ing, polishing, silvering etc., of glass.
The business flourished, and 75 em-
ployees were engaged in all through-
out the various sections.
New Building Erected.
In 1903, owing to increase of bus-
iness, the showroom at 330 George
Street was found to be inadequate to
meet demands, and a building was
erected next door to meet the firm’s
special requirements.
In 1906, Mr. Cormack retired from
the business, and in 1909, for family
reasons, the firm was formed into a
Limited Liability Company under the
title of James Sandy and Co. Ltd.,
with Mr. James Montague Sandy as
Managing Director, the other Direct*
ors being Mr. H. Freeman and Mr.
A. R. Troup, Mr. James Lionel M.
Sandy, eldest son of Mr. James M.
Sandy being appointed Secretary.
Early in 1914 the Redfern works
were altered and brought up-to-date.
On August 4 1914, immediately
on the outbreak of World War 1, Mr.
I. Lionel M. Sandy enlisted in the
forces and was killed in action dur-
ing an aerial encounter in 1917.
Early in 1915 Mr. Harold M. Sandy,
who was also in the firm, enlisted,
and served firstly with the Light
Horse, later transferring to the in-
fantry in France. He fought at Pas*
schendale and Polyglon Wood, and
obtained his commission in the field
and also won the Military Cross.
During 1917, Mr. Edward M.
Sandy, youngest son of Mr. J. M.
Sandv, enlisted and throughout the
war years, the firm carried on the
business quietly under difficult wartime
conditions, until Mr. H. M. Sandy
was demobilised, and became a Di-
rector of the Company.
In 1921 Mr. J. M. Sandy died in
England, and Mr. H. M. Sandy be-
came Governing Director.
At this time, Mr. A. H. Craig
was appointed to the Board. In 1922
the firm purchased the building at
268*270 George Street with the in-
tention to use it in future develop-
ments. The business was expanding,
with 170 employees. Some time prior
to this, a branch had been establish-
ed at Newcastle in premises 123 Scott
Street.
New Factory Built.
In 1924 Mr. Edward M. Sandy
made a world-wide tour collecting
data for a new factory. From the
information thus gained, a building
was designed to meet Australian re-
quirements and built at Redfern after
his return to Sydney in 1925. The
building completed in 1927, stands
on an area of 110 ft. by 110 ft., and
is of concrete construction four storeys
in height, and glassed on three sides
with plate glass; all modern details
pertaining to factory design were in-
cluded and the new plant installed
included the most up-to-date bevelling
and silvering plant.
In the open plate glass section,
sheets of glass as large as 17’ x 9’ are
carried in stock and handled with ease.
This building joins the old factory,
which stands on an acre of land, this
old building being now used as a bulk
oil and colour glass store.
On February 2, 1931. the com*
pany made another progressive move
and occupied their own premises at
268*270 George Street. This build*
ing with its 47 ft. frontage to George
Street and 120 ft. to Dean Place, af*
fords excellent display space for the
company’s large and varied stock.
For many years the Company has
also carried on business as manufac*
turers of paints, kalsomines, dry col*
ours, etc., under the name of The
Carter Paint Pty. Ltd., which com*
pany moved into a new modern fac*
tory at Auburn in 1950, and in order
to intensify its activities in the South
Coast area the company in 1950 pur*
chased the business of the Wollon*
eong Glass Co., Corrimal St. Wol*
longong. The employees of the com*
pany now number 200 and the com*
pany is proud of the fact that there
are fifteen employees whose years of
service aggregate 581 years.

VISION AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
THE TROTTER-PATERSON MEMORIAL LECTURE.
By Dr. E. D. ADRIAN, O.M., P.R.S.
The second Trotter' Paterson
Memorial Lecture of The Illuminating
Engineering Society, London, was
given at the Royal Institution on 28th
January, 1953, by the President of the
Royal Society, Dr. E. D. Adrian,
0.M.. Master of Trinity College,
Cambridge, who took as his subject
“The Nervous Reactions of the
Retina.”
After paying tribute to the two
great illuminating engineers in whose
memory the Lecture was founded, Dr.
Adrian gave a very lucid account of
work on the nervous system, a subject
in which he has an international repu'
tation and for which he received a
Nobel prize some years ago.
Different animals, he said, were de'
pendent on different senses as their
chief means of learning about and
reacting to the outside world. In some
animals hearing was alhimportant, in
others it was smell or touch; but in
man, the monkeys and the birds, sight
was by far the most valuable of the
senses. What we saw was not the
exact pattern of light and shade form-
ed on our retina; this image was “edit'
ed” by the mind, blanks were filled in
and different portions were emphasised
in a manner depending largely on pre-
vious experience.
The mind, said Dr. Adrian, tended
to react to a change in the stimulus
which it was interpreting much more
than to the absolute steady value of
that stimulus. Further, its reaction was
more pronounced in the case of a
rapid change than with a slow one.
Dr. Adrian then went on to describe
the processes which occurred between
the retina and the cerebal cortex, and
it was now known that electrical im-
pulses travelled along the individual
fibres in the optic nerve when the
retina was stimulated.
A phenomenon mentioned by Dr.
Adrian was the effect of change of
stimulus, to which he had referred
earlier; cutting off the illumination, he
said, resulted in signals along the
nerve fibres which were as intense as
those produced by turning the light
on. Then there was the experimental
fact that great activity in one area of
the retina could suppress activity in
continguous areas, so that the contrast
at the edge of an illuminated area ap'
peared to be exaggerated.
We could not, he said, improve our
eyes or any other sense organ, but we
could influence the way in which our
minds interpreted the messages it re'
received. Questions of aesthetics,
however, had still to be left to the
psychologist or settled by the time'
honoured method of trying something
new in lighting and seeing whether we
liked it or not.

The Olympus - powered Canberra,
product of the Bristol Aeroplane Com'
pany, has attained heights of over
60,000 feet. This is of outstanding
operational importance as is the re'
markably consistent performance up to
these very great altitudes.
The Olympus is the first turbojet
engine produced by the company, its
other gas turbines being of the turbo'
prop type. The Olympus is also the
only two'shaft turbine, apart from the
American J. 57, in the world.

A HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHT HOURS
A practical demonstration of erect-
ing a house in eight hours was re-
cently given at Punchbowl by lan
Donaldson and Co.
The house, built at Leichhardt Con-
structions Pty. Ltd. modern factory,
was completely erected by a team of
four workmen in a day, and the walls
and partitions were erected in 55
minutes.
The foundations and floor had been
previously prepared (see illustration
No. 1) which also shows the first
section of the rear outside walls and
two partitions being placed in posi-
tion.
All the wall sections and partitions
arrived at the site in a special trailer
and were then conveyed by mobile
crane to the scene of operations (il-
lustration No. 2), which shows the
last section of the outside wall being
lowered into position.
The whole operation which was
watched by housing authorities and
the Minister for Housing, Mr. Clive
Evatt, was conducted with split-sec-
ond timing.
Roof Goes On.
Following the erection of the walls
(with doors windows, already in
place) another trailer unloaded the
roof trusses, which were immediately
placed in position. Tiles followed,
workmen placed the stove, tubs, cop-
per, cupboards, sink, etc., into posi-
tion, the water was connected, and,
with the exceptio.n of electricity, the
house was ready for occupancy in a
span of eight hours.
French’s Forest Resort Project
£500,000 SCHEME PROPOSED.
A proposal to build a £500,000
bungalow tourist resort on 28 acres
of ground in French’s Forest has been
put forward by a Sydney businessman.
He is Mr. J. Gelbar, managing di-
rector of Gelbar Import and Engin-
eering Co. of Australia, Pty. Ltd., 10
O Connell Street.
Warringah Shire Council has ap-
proved the scheme in principle and
has offered every possible assistance.
Mr. Gelbar intends to float a com-
pany to build the resort as soon as
the Cumberland County Council gives
its approval to the project.
The resort, which will be situated
on property on the south-eastern corn-
er of Wakehurst Parkway and Rose-
ville Road, is planned to accommodate
250 people in 51 two-unit bungalows
and three or four 10-unit dormitories.
• Each bungalow will comprise
two self-contained units of a bedroom,
lounge, bathroom and kitchenette.
• Each dormitory will have 10 self'
contained units, consisting of a single
bedroom and bathroom,
• Amenities will include a large
swimming pool, tennis courts, ball'
room, open-air and lounge bars,
children’s play area and swimming
pool.
The application to erect the tourist
resort is to come before an early
meeting of the Cumberland County
Council.
Although the area sought by Mr.
Gelbar for his project has been zoned
as a green belt, the Cumberland Coun-
cil will permit a tourist resort in such
a zone.
No. 1. The start: A
special trailer delivers
wall and partition sec-
tions to the site. A
mobile crane can be
seen swinging one sec-
tion towards the part-
ly-erected house.
No. 2. Ten minutes
later: Two sections of
the outside wall, and
two partitions are al-
ready in place on a
previously - prepared
floor with brick foun-
dations.
No. 3. Fifty-five min-
utes after the operation
started: The final sec-
tion of the outside wall
(complete with doors
and windows) is low-
ered into place. The
roof and interior fit-
tings immediately fol-

Lighting Impressions in Europe

Among other things, 1 was, or

y b if j
The ‘first European city, after leav'
ing the ship, was Naples. Its narrow
streets are crowded day and night;
the shops are open until late at night.
There are many large electrical shop;:
with light'fittings mass'produced, but
seldom of really good workmanship.
The people are poor, and so the prices
must be rather low. This compels the
factories in Northern Italy, from where
almost all light'fittings come, to pro'
duce cheap units. That means all
metal'connections are soft soldered.
Flex is of the poorest quality and all
fittings are incredibly small. One can
see bedside'table lamps in polished
brass finish, with metal or glass'shades,
only about 6in. high, so as to save
metal. They have large varieties of all
the fittings, pendants, small chande'
liers, table and desk'lamps, all with
polished brass finish. The designs are
neat, modern as well as period, tiny
bullet' shape lamps and fittings in
Baroque'Style a lot of alabaster'marble
lamps. One can also see crystahlamps
and chandeliers, very modern floor'
stands made of conical metahtubes,
and a speciality of Southern Italy;
glass'pendants of the shape of lanterns,
Rocco'Style as well as Empire'Style,
and high modern ones, too.
There seem tQ be tOO many ljght .
fittings shops in Naples and each shop
is fully crowded with goods, and the
, . , ru j -tl
show' windows are overfilled. Ihe
, Ti _ , . .
great unemployment in Italy is the
* ( y / c. 3 ,
cause of very keen competition where
one penny (5 lire) counts.
Italian Glass Light-fittings,
There are, of course, made to order
light'fittings in the large banks, in the
many places, and in modern hotels,
I spent a few days in the Hotel
Vesuvio, a new, large hotel where
many English people live, and there
I saw a number of very interesting
modern light'fittings. In the large
lounge'rooms there were some ball'
shaped pendants with a diameter of
approximately 3ft., the glass'ball con'
sisting of twelve segments, each seg'
ment having polished and bevelled
edges. Just imagine one segment with
its widest part about 9fin. and approxi'
mately 3ft. distance between the two
corners. Near each corner there was
a hole fin. drilled to fasten the seg'
ment to the metal stem, which was a
lin. tube. Inside of the glass'ball
were polished brass brackets, clustered
around the stem. Altogether I count'
ed thirtV'six such brackets, each carry'
ing a Krypton 40watt small candle
globe fitted into a blossom ' shaped
metal'spinning. The whole chandelier
used 1440 Watt and gave hardly the
light effect of two Comptalux globes.
I must admit it is wonderful to look
at these fittings, especially in daytime
-—they are full of charm, harmony and
delicate art.
But please do not ask how they
clean these giant glass balls. I watch'
ed two hotel employees who started
in the morning—they were still busy
during the day and had not finished
late in the evening. They polish the
glasses with love and tenderness. De'
finitely not a job for Australia. There
were on the walls suitable brackets
with six to sixteen arms each. All the
metal work was stove'baked clear
enamel and fully resists the sea'air.
In some other places in Naples, as
well as in Rome, Florence, Bologna,
Peruggio, Milan and others, I found
the same kind of light'fittings, but
there, in Central Italy and in Northern
Italy, the shops already sell good
quality and still more varieties of
modern lamps.
Starting in Rome, I visited qute a
number of factories, and I must say
that the different Italian Chambers of
Commerce were very helpful. In
Milan alone I called at fourteen fac'
tories, many of them producing very
high'grade fittings, including modern
fluorescent light'fittings.
In Milan I also found the factories
which manufacture the cheap stuff I
had seen in Naples and a few hun'
dred girls were working, doing the
soldering, polishing and assembling.
One of the most efficient factories
in Milan is the one which has made
the light'fittings on the Lloyd Tries'
tino ships, “Australia,” “Neptunio”
and “Oceanea,” which many of us
have seen here in Sydney Harbour.
This factory is specialised in light'
fittings for ships.
Crazy Fittings,
In some places, such as Bologna,
there are studios for light'fitting pro'
duction. There are artists working
and modelling the craziest lamps.
In Bologna I had the opportunity
of going to the yearly Art and Craft
Exhibition, where all kinds of in'
dividual workmanship could be seen.
Here I saw the most wonderful
alabaster fittings and also many carved
marble lamps, and I shall not forget
to mention the lampshades made of
opaque veneers of rare timbers, many
of them combined with lace.
The Italians, like the French, love
their opemair cafes and they use there

artistically designed light'fittings, while
also in the theatres and operas they
have an abundance of light.
I have often wondered from where
many of the ideas came for modern
light'fittings, and when I visited the
Palazzo Venezia in Rome—the palace
where Mussolini used to live—l saw
there chandeliers and wall brackets of
enormous dimensions and very in-
teresting designs which must have
given many artists inspirations for new
creations. There were many chande-
liers, among them some of 20ft.
diameter hanging in a hall of 180 ft.
x 54ft. and sOft. high.
Biblical Ideas in Israel.
Then I went to Israel, where I saw
many new ideas originating from Bib'
lical light'fittings. Some artists have
studios where they make individual de'
signs. The Bezalel Museum in Jeru'
salem, which at the same time is the
Art Academy, has a collection of old
biblical candlesticks and chandeliers.
The Hotel King David in Jerusalem
has a number of large halls, each of a
different pre-Christian style, as Egyp-
tian, Assyrian, Babylonian, with in-
teresting light'fittings which could just
as well be called modern.
The next step was Austria. There
are many designing firms active and
thev produce a good quality of very
modern lamps. I could not find out
how they manage to make these fine
nerforated metal shades. Although
the country has become very poor and
has the Russians in Vienna and sur-
roundings, they try to create fine works
or art. There I had the opportunity
to attend a lecture in honour of
Leonardo da Vinci’s five hundredth
anniversary, and an old professor of
the University—the same I had attend'
ed once—spoke among other things
of Leonardo as an engineer who had
also been active in designing light'
fittings.
In Holland and Belgium I did not
see many new creations for lighting.
They mostly stick to their old style
chandeliers which look very solid and
well-made.

NEW SWISS PICTURE THEATRE
Wire Sculpture" has been employed in the lighting fittings on the walls of this
recent picture theatre in Zurich (right) to give an effect like an Einsteinian rela-
tivity problem! Women however, might be pardoned tor thinking the walls were
decorated with press clasps. On the left the wall bearing the film has been
accordean pleated and waved as well, as though the instruments it represents were
in full action, whilst the canopy above is without connection to the walls. It is
always interesting to try to unravel the meaning of everything new, though even
the Editor has "to give this one best."
Below is a general view of the interior of the theatre which is known as "The
Astoria. Internal colour scheme is grey.

In Belgium they have some lighting'
glass factories which manufacture the
artful all'Over'the'Surface frosted glasses
with a special way of diffusion of light.
English Exhibition.
England produces quite a number of
modern designs. An exhibition of
Merchant Adventurers in London had
a large range of very interesting lamps,
all most effectively exhibited. I think
it was the best light'fitting show I saw
in Europe and I think the English
must have some special ability for ex'
hibhions because among the many Art
Galleries I visited in Europe the three
London galleries the National Gal'
lery, the Tate, and the Wallace were
definitely the best arranged I saw.
Returning to the Continent, Switzer'
land is the country where they show
vou the most wonderful designs of the
latest light'fittings—probably with the
exception of Sweden and Finland,
where I did not go. I saw in Switzer'
land really the best in design and
quality and in high prices, too. They
also produce a lot of wooden'earved
light'fittings. .
Here again I visited a number of
very modern factories. Swiss factories
have a special peculiarity: they are in
themselves worthy of sightseeing tours.
All buildings are most modern, many
electronic devices are used, each
worker is treated like an alderman of
the city; the machines are of the
latest design. It’s a pleasure to see
these factories working. The high
prices probably originate from that
pleasure.
Lighting in Paris.
The next and the last country I
visited was France, and I tell you
straight away that I saw how fascinat'
ing light'effects can be when I went
in Paris to the Follies Bergere. It is
impossible to describe all the colours
and colour effects. They must have
an arsenal of light'fittings and spot'
lights to produce all this. Even
Americans, who are usually very reluc'
tant to say that there can be something
good outside U.S.A., applauded like
madmen. Of course, there were some
other effects, too, which also affected
the eyes in a very agreeable way. A
lecture about these effects would have
to be held in another society.
Well, Paris and other towns in
France are nice, but you will not see
any locally' produced modern light'
fittings. In Versailles, Trianon and
Malmaison, there are many style
features, and there again many artists
must have got some inspirations, be-
cause some of the light'fittings look
quite modern, although 200 to 300
years old.
And, speaking of old light'fittings,
J would like to show you just before
finishing a few very old lamps from
Pompeii, Peruggio and Florence,
we in Sydney also have an-
tique designs fifty years old and still
in production, the fittings I saw in
Pompeii are much older. They are
about 200 years old.
The floorstand in the Municipal
Palace in Peruggio is about 600 years
old and the torch'bearer statue in the
Etruscan Museum in Florence is ap'
proximately 1000 years old.
I am sure many Australian travellers
have seen more of Europe, because,
despite wars and destructions, the old
Continent is—and, let us hope, will
always be—the fountain which gives
humanity the drink of culture.
Lighting Impressions Overseas
By Mr. S. WATSON.
In this short lecture you will have
already been warned that the observa'
dons are personal ones, so that if I
appear to concentrate on certain as'
pects of lighting to the exclusion of
others, please do not take this as an
indication that the interesting develop'
ments of to-day are confined to a
limited field. Everyone will surely
agree that the science and art of light'
ing are, even now, in their very early
stages, and the lighting engineer
travelling overseas at the moment
meets with an abundance of fascinating
new ideas in every possible direction,
which must lead eventually to a bet.er
appreciation, particularly of the appli'
cation of lighting both by the profes'
sion and the lay public.
However, to avoid any sense of dis-
appointment tomight, let me first say
that it is not intended to detail a great
list of revolutionary and so far urn
published data. As many lecturers to
this Society have stated in recent
months, the emphasis everywhere to-
day is on experiment and development
with existing equipment and tech'
nique, and these are the aspects on
which I should like to comment.
Tungsten Filament.
Although it is a little awkward for
the purpose of discussion, I shall try
to group these remarks under two
broad headings, “Sources” and “Ap'
plications.” Sources will be taken
first, and perhaps we should commence
with the oldest source of all. the tung'
s"en filament lamp. A member of our
Societv recently lectured on the sub'
iect “Has the Filament Lamp Reached
the End of Its Development?” From
what I have seen recently I should
say No, not by any means. The lec'
turer referred on this other occasion,
of course, to improvement in efficiencv
and light output, but to my mind
the most important recent develop'
ment with this light source is the in'
corporation of source and beam con'
trol mechanism in the one unit, re'
suiting in the welhknown range of
reflector lamps. These lamps are now
being manufactured in a very wide
range of wattages, with both spot and
flood characteristics, and certain types
designed for outdoor use may be used
fully exposed to wind and rain with'
out further protection. The advam
tages of these lamps over the older
equipment are very great. They are
more compact, easier to install, re'
quire no adjustment, no maintenance,
and have a higher efficiency. The im'
pact of reflector lamps in the field of
store and shop lighting, and certain
types of floodlighting, has in recent
years—to contradict myself—been in
the nature of a revolution. Until
quite recently, and as is still to a
large extent accepted in this country,
retail store lighting was principally the
province of fluorescent equipment.
But it was quickly recognised that
whilst undoubtedly this form of light'
ing was highly efficient in terms of
lumens per £ invested, the result, from
a merchandising point of view, often
was uninterestingly flat and lacking in
character, or plasticity as it is now
expressed. Reflector lamps provided
an immediate answer to the problem,
and in all modern stores are now uni'
versally employed in conjunction with
fluorescent equipment. I hope to be
able to show examples of these appli'
cations in a few minutes. Time will
not allow comments on other recent
developments in filament lamps, and in
fact many of these are for specialised
use and are not of any great general
interest.
Fluorescent Lighting.
Coming now to fluorescent lamps,
we enter a highly contentious and
confused field. Undoubtedly, the two
major lines of development at the
moment are in the directions of sini'
nlified auxiliary apparatus and iim
proved colour. Possibly in some cases
for good reason, the starter switch
employed with hot cathode tubes has
become very unpopular in recent years,
and all over the world there is a
movement to eliminate the starter
switch and develop quick starting
characteristics. If this results in fewer
and simpler and less costly com'
so much the better, but urn
fortunatelv many of the special cir'
ruits so far evolved, whilst they do
have fewer components, are by no
means simple, and are certainly not
less costly.
Currently available starterless lamps
and equipment may be grouped under
32

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


two general headings. Firstly, there
are the more or less conventional pre'
heat hot cathode tubes operated with
cathode pre'heating transformers, and
variously known in England and
America as “quick start,” “rapid start”
and “trigger start.” Secondly, we
now have a group of cold start, hot
cathode lamps, exemplified by the
European internal self - start tube,
which will start at normal main voh
tages, and the American instant'Start
and slimdine series which require a
comparatively high voltage to initiate
the arc. Each of these systems natU'
rally has its own merits, and problems,
but one of the main disadvantages
common to all types is a reduced over-
all efficiency as compared with con'
ventional circuits using starter switches.
That is the price you must pay for
starterless operation, but it is fairly
safe to say that the problem will even'
tually be overcome, or at least mini'
mised. It is interesting to note at this
juncture that even in countries where
starterless equipment has been avail'
able for some time, by far the greater
percentage of fluorescent equipment
purchased is still of the conventional
type.
The problem of colour with fluores'
cent tubes has also resulted in the in'
troduction of a confusing and endless
range of types over recent years, but
there are signs that an attempt is now-
being made to rationalise the situation
to a workable and more reasonable
choice of colours for most applications
met with in practice. Until recently,
the emphasis was placed on efficiency,
and better fluorescent powers have
raised lumen per watt ratings to a
very high level. There is, however, a
limit to this form of improvement,
both theoretical and practical, and
high efficiency and good colour rendfi
tion rapidly become incompatible.
Due to the prominence of the mer-
cury resonance lines and red deficiency
in the powders, fluorescent lighting
has, for some time, been viewed with
suspicion as a light source, particular'
ly for home use and wherever the
emphasis is on appearance rather than
seeing. These special applications can
now be met with the new deduxe
colours, which are similar to the
colours we know, but in which high
efficiency has been sacrificed for a far
more satisfactory balance of spectral
distribution. The current trend, there'
fore, is to offer two different colours
in each of the low, medium and high
colour temperature groups. One
colour is a standard high efficiency
type suitable for industrial and most
commercial applications, and the
second the deduxe colour, covers the
more exacting commercial installations
and all other cases where good or
pleasing colour rendition is of first im'
portance.

The increased stroke of the new press makes it an outstanding tool and permits it
to be used for components of the size now needed by aircraft designers. One of

NEW METHOD OF LEVELLING MACHINERY.
A simple method of levelling machinery on even the most uneven floors has been
devosed. It will be shown at the British Industries Fair, London and Birmingham
from 27th April until May 8 by Cooper and Co.. Little King Street. Birmingham.
It is a glue and felt combination and dispenses with the necessity tor bedding a
machine down with bolts to the floor. The felt is cut out to precise sizes and
when glued and set at the base of the machine the result is a firm and solid fitting.

Gas Discharge Lamps.
Although they could in themselves
be the subject of a separate lecture, I
must group the third important type
of sources as “other gaseous discharge
lamps.” The most important are, of
course, mercury and sodium, bo.h of
which have been brought to a high
stage of development since the last
war. In the case of sodium lamps,
although there have been improve-
ments in lamp efficiency, the most in-
teresting aspects are in application to
be dealt with later.
Mercury lamps, as sources, offer two
new lines of development both directed
towards better colour, namely, spectral
correction by combination with tung-
sten filaments or with fluorescent
powders. Many years ago the com-
bination of tungsten filament lamps
with mercury lamps was popular for
high bay industrial lighting, and in
certain countries it appears that this
type of lighting is coming back into
strong favour. For this application,
the blended lamp, having a tungsten
filament in the same envelope with a
high pressure mercury discharge ele-
ment, and acting as a ballast for the
latter, has many advantages, particu-
larly as regards capital cost.
The newest mercury lamp is, of
course, the colour corrected mercury
fluorescent. It is, in fact, a major de-
velopment and is likely to replace
tubular fluorescent lighting for many-
industrial applications and almost cer-
tainly for street lighting in built-up
areas. I should like to say more about
these lamps ,but at the moment un-
fortunately that is not possible.
These are the most interesting
sources in the news at the moment,
although perhaps brief mention should
be made of other types of mercury
arc lamps, even though some are hard-
ly light sources. Germicidal lamps
have been in use for many years, and
continue in popularity, more particu-
larly now in the manufacture of perish-
able substances such as foodstuffs and
drugs. There is also a complete range
of high pressure, small volume mer-
cury arc lamps associated with tele-
vision and aerial navigation, and the
special problems of t|ie graphic arts
relating to the development of a group
of special printing lamps, many of
these having considerable output in
the ultra-violet region. Applications
have even been found for mercury
lamps in the curing of synthetic resins,
some of which are photo sensitive, but
that is getting away from lighting.
Applications.
Before dealing with specific applica-
tions, mention should be made of an
aspect which could very well be the
secret behind the great quantity and
variety of excellent lighting installa-
tions which we see illustrated in over-
seas journals. One gains the impres-
sion that in many of the older coun-
tries there is a very well-developed
appreciation of the importance of
lighting in everyday society; in other
words, people are more lighting con-
scious. It is obvious to a visitor that
both public and private authorities
generally are prepared to invest far
greater capital outlay in lighting as
compared with the situation in this
country, and this applies not only to
industrial and commercial lighting as
well as to transportation and street
lighting, but even to the purely deco-
rative forms such as floodlighting or
special effects for festive occasions.
This general movement for a more
intelligent approach to lighting has
also affected the ordinary citizen to a
surprising extent. To take night driv-
ing as an example, it is rare to see
in Europe a car driven at night with
the headlights on the upper beam,
even on main highways. Hand sig-
nals, which are always of doubtful
value at night, have given way com-
pletely to lighted mechanical signals
on the side or rear of the vehicle,
either flashing or showing direction
arrows, and full use is made of these
facilities on all occasions.
On the research side, many in-
teresting new ideas are being de-
veloped on the relationship between
lighting and personal comfort. Great
emphasis is now being placed on the
increasing amount of illumination
necessary with age; far greater use is
being made of colour, and interior
lighting generally is being planned in
relation to the general environment
rather than as a simple consideration
of lighting levels or brightness con-
trasts.
Street Lighting.
The latter part of the remarks on
light sources dealt with mercury and
sodium lamps, and it is convenient to
continue immediately with their appli-
cations, the most important being, of
course, street lighting. Opinions on
the most satisfactory type of equip-
ment and laying out for street light-
ing still differ considerably from coun-
try to country. As far as the western
part of Europe and England is con-
cerned it is most marked that sodium
lighting is being installed in an in-
creasing proportion every year on all
important trunk routes, whilst the
newer types of mercury lamps, and in
some cases fluorescent lamps, are find-
ing their natural applications in heavily
built-up areas where pedestrian traffic
is high and there is an objection to
the colour of the sodium lamps. The
standards adopted for main roads light-
ing with the newer installations are
exceptionally high, and it is not at all
uncommon to find installations where
the average spacing between points is
less than 100 ft. with 140-watt sodium
lamps placed on both sides of the
roadway. On the question of fixtures
for gas discharge lamps, both the cut'
off and reflector type lamps are popu'
lar. I had the opportunity of driving
under many different forms of street
lighting and in my own personal
opinion there is no question that the
cut'off street lighting system employ'
ing sodium lamps is the most satisfac'
tory, and provides the safest and most
comfortable seeing conditions for the
driver. Every opportunity was taken
also of questioning regular drivers of
motor vehicles in different countries,
and it was interesting to learn that the
average driver has a marked preference
for sodium lighting, whatever form the
fixture took.
Some examples of street lighting
with various types of sources are
shown in the photographs now illus'
trated. The first two show examples
of colour corrected mercury and
fluorescent lighting in a main city
street. The second two are examples
of sodium lamps in cut'off fixtures,
placed along a main through road in
a city: in this case sodium is used to
delineate the correct route for
through traffic, and the second one
was taken on an inter-city highway
adjacent to a rail crossing.
We all know the problem of fatigue
experienced by long-distance transport
drivers at night, which is exaggerated
by the monotony of long stretches of
straight highway. Some attempt is
being made in certain countries to
avoid the danger of the drivers losing
attention, by creating points of focus
at suitable intervals. The next two
illustrations show an example of a
cross-bridge on a highway which is
floodlighted with sodium lamps for this
purpose. This type of application falls
within the category of light conscious-
ness mentioned previously.
Finally, as a service to motorists, it
is interesting to see the type of 24-
hours’ service station which is found
in great numbers on all main roads.
Here again, as a means to attract the
attention of motorists, the surround-
ings of the station are invariably flood-
lighted with sodium lamps.
In America, the situation with street
lighting is quite different, due mainly
to two controlling influences—the low
cost of power and the high cost of
labour. Sodium lamps have never
been popular in U.S.A., although
some use has been made of mercury.
Under post-war conditions, however,
it has been found that the maintenance
costs on all forms of gaseous discharge
street lighting were so high in propor-
tion to the running cost that many of
34

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


the existing installations are being
changed from mercury vapour to fila-
ment lamps of large wattages. Here
again, lighting standards, in particular
on main thoroughfares, are very high,
and cost is not allowed to stand in the
way of safety. It would be wrong to
create the impression that all street
lighting overseas is at a very much
higher standard than in our country;
there is in fact still a great deal of
extremely poor light, but it is most
noticeable that highway authorities
generally are becoming very much
more conscious of the importance good
lighting plays in accident and crime
prevention and do not hesitate in
diverting very large sums of money to
this purpose.
Industrial Lighting.
Continuing with the application of
the gaseous discharge lamps, it can be
said that sodium lamps play a very im-
portant part wherever visibility is like-
ly to be affected by dust or smoke.
The next illustration shows an example
of sodium lighing in a railway mar-
shalling yard, and this is followed by
a typical installation in a foundry.
The next illustration of the lighting in
a floating dock is interesting in that
the original lighting was provided by
sodium lamps, but it was found sub-
sequently that the colour of this form
of lighting made it impossible for the
painters to work on vessels at night,
and the dock was reequipped with a
combination of fluorescent and mer-
cury lighting. The next illustration
shows the interior of one of the heavy
machine shops associated with the
same dockyard, with the new mercury
fluorescent lamps installed in high bay
fixtures.
These lamps are of outstanding
merit for this type of application, and
their use is being extended in the
heavy industrial field at a very fast
rate.
Light industry, as in this country,
is very well-served by fluorescent light-
ing. Fixtures are more or less in the
form we use at the moment, although
in general the lighting levels adopted
are higher. In the better class of in-
dustrial interior in Europe, 15 to 20
foot candles is the accepted minimum,
and of course 50 foot candles or more
in the U.S.A. The following two il-
lustrations are typical, one being the
printing shop of a textile mill, and the
second a general machine shop. In
both of these examples it should be
noted that the whole of the ceiling
surface, including all structural steel
work, is painted with a high reflectance
white, which, moreover, is kept white.
Once again, in both cases, the manage-
ments were light conscious.
Commercial Lighting.
The backbone of all commercial
lighting of the better type is unques-
tionably tubular fluorescent, although
as mentioned previously the advent of
new reflector lamps has resulted in a
highly satisfactory solution to the
problem of retail store lighting, in the
form of combination of both fluores-
cent tubes and reflector type down'
lights. There does not appear to be
any outstanding development in the
construction of fluorescent fixtures
apart from the facts that increasing
use is being made of plastic materials
and that the greater proportion of
designs incorporate louvres in one
form or another. The next illustra'
tions are examples of this trend as ap'
plied to the lighting in retail stores of
various types. Here again, lighting
levels are very high, but the designer
has not lost sight of the importance
of rendering form and texture by a
variation in the intensity and direction
of lighting in certain locations.
These last'mentioned aspects are, of
course, major factors in the case of
show window lighting. Generally
speaking, there are marked differences
between the European and American
practice in this regard. In Europe,
the tendency is to sell from the win-

MAGNIFICENT NEW SOUTH AMERICAN HOTEL
This munificent new hotel El Panama, at Panama City, is one of the largest and finest in Central America, Its 300 rooms
each has a private terrace overlooking the Pacific Ocean and is surrounded by fifteen acres of tropical gardens planted
around a beautiful swimming pool. Why can't Australia do something like this? We have had some smart Americans here
offering to buy up hotels and build up a chain of decent residental hotels tor tourists. But because "the laws of the land"
will permit them to bring their money into the country, but not take it out again, they decided to keep their money where
it would be safe and we can keep our hotels such as they are, and for which (with one or two exceptions) any self-respecting
Australian would blush.

dew, and high level general lighting
by means of grouped banks of fluores-
cent tubes is common where it is
necessary to display a great array and
variety of merchandise. American
practice, on the other hand, is more
like ours. Every effort is made to
dramatise the display, thus drawing
attention to the store rather than to
the particular item of merchandise.
Fluorescent lighting is practically never
used in American show windows, but
great use is made of reflector lamps,
special projectors and carefully con-
trolled backgrounds to ensure the
greatest degree of modelling and con-
trol of the observer’s attention.
Office Lighting.
At the moment fluorescent lighting
has an unchallenged hold in the office
lighting field. The types of fixtures
commonly met with are similar to the
range available in this country. How-
ever, the outstanding new idea for
office lighting, and similar types of
commercial premises, is the replace-
ment of separate fixtures altogether by
a complete luminous ceiling. This, ot
course, is a natural development from
the louvre-all ceiling introduced some
years ago . Whilst louvres present an
attractive appearance, they do not, un-
fortunately, overcome the problem ot
specular reflection. The luminous ceil
ing, on the other hand, completely
eliminates this fault and permits the
lighting levels to be raised to extreme-
ly high levels without the discomfort
of glare from any cause. One form
of this development is illustrated in
the next photograph. The diffusing
material is lightweight corrugated
P.V.C. sheet, which requires the
minimum of structural support and
can be readily dismantled for cleaning.
The light source is, of course, a group
of fluorescent tubes mounted directly
against a white ceiling.
Finally, I should like to show you
some examples of flood lighting from
various parts of Europe, employing
sodium, mercury and tungsten filament
sources. It is, of course, obvious that
we do not always have the opportunity
in this country for obtaining results
such as these, but there are undoubted-
ly many cases in public gardens, city
squares, and so on, where good flood-
lighting would be a valuable asset to
the community and an aid in develop-
ing civic pride. These are but a few
examples of lighting application select-
ed at random.
As far as the immediate future is
concerned in Australia, I think we will
have a splendid opportunity of apply-
ing some of these new ideas during
the long-awaited commercial building
boom which must take place almost
immediately. It should be remember-
ed that since before the war all build-
ing has been confined to the indus-
trial and domestic spheres, and con-
sequently there has been no occasion
for lighting engineers to introduce
many of the more important recent
introductions in lighting practice.
Now that the building industry is in
a better position generally, we must
make up for the lag, providing new
shops, offices, theatres, churches and
other types of public buildings, and I
think we can look forward to many
outstanding Australian lighting installa-
tions of which we can be proud.
DISCUSSION.
In referring to the one-third and
two-third circle fluorescent tubes men-
tioned by Mr. Beecher, Mr. Deegan
said that they were not standard sizes,
and asked about the manufacture of
them. Mr. Beecher said that they
were made by some of the smaller
factories in competition with the
makers of the standard types. Mr.
Beecher added that there was no great
difficulty in making them.
Mr. Knight referred to a statement
by Mr. Watson concerning an Ameri-
can trend towards the use of incan-
descent lamps for street-lighting be-
cause of the high labour costs in that
country. Mr. Knight said that surely
the shorter life of the incandescent
lamps would increase the labour cost
of replacements.
In reply, Mr. Watson said that,
owing to the group replacement sys-
tem used with incandescent lamps, the
cost of labour per lamp was lower
than that occurring with the individual
replacement of discharge lamps.
Mr. Freedman mentioned the in-
stallation in the Banking Chamber of
the Bank of N.S.W., Sydney, as a
typical example of the advantage of
the reflector bulb lamp. The existing
fittings which had been more preten-
tious than useful had been transform-
ed into efficient lighting units by the
replacement of a number of small
lamps with the reflector type bulbs.
Mr. Bugler asked Mr. Watson if
there had been any departure in other
countries from the standard bi-pin
lamp holder for fluorescent lamps.
Mr. Watson said that apart from the
BC lampholder used in England and
certain instant lamps with single con-
tacts, the bi-pin was the standard cap
throughout the world.
COLOUR IN SCHOOLS
By DAVID MEDD, A.A. Dipl., A.R.I.B.A.
Summary of a Paper presented at a meeting of The Illuminating Engineering
Society, London, on February 10, 1953.
The author stressed the now familiar
plea for closer collaboration between
the lighting engineer and the architect
at the early design stage of a job.
Architects, he said, need to take ad-
vice on the best way of achieving the
right quantity and quality of lighting,
and colour choice is not entirely the
prerogative of the architect or deco-
rator. The architect wants to feel he
is free to design in terms of light and
shade with certain aesthetic considera-
tions in mind. Brightness contrasts
that would be intolerably disabling in
certain spaces may be quite justifiable
in others.
Visual Interest.
The eye yearns for visual interest;
many buildings to-day lack visual in-
terest through lack of imagination and
an attitude of mind that says it must
cost money, and all that is achieved is
cream walls and mottled floors, re-
lieved by fluorescent light fittings and
green woodwork. However, there are
signs that designers are realising that
modern architecture is starved of visual
interest, and that a form of decoration
and enrichment must be established
which springs naturally from present-
day materials, techniques and economy.
This is the right way and the difficult
way. The easier way is to revive
cliches from earlier periods or to in'
vent them.
The provision of visual interest is
made easier by exploiting a wide
range of textures, colours and mate-
rials. The device of contrast to pro-
duce visual interest is one that can be
used more. Architects will not achieve
visual interest in buildings until they
are able to use the whole scale from
the smoothness of glass to the rough-
ness of stone, from the darkness of
deep shadow to the brightness of the
sun, from the delicacy of pink to the
boldness of scarlet, from the blackness
of black to the whiteness of white.
In rooms or spaces where good
vision is of prime importance the
architect, with the help of the lighting
engineer, must of course deploy the
light source, both natural and artificial,
to ensure not only adequate illumina-
tion whenever required, but a balanc-
ing of sourcing to avoid brightness
contrasts that will cause disability or
discomfort. He must also realise the
effect of these sources' on the reflect-
ances of colours he will be using.
The paper also described the range
of colours for use in schools which
has been evolved by the Ministry of
Education. It is known as the ‘Arch-
rome’ Range; the colours in the range
have been in use by some educational
authorities for some time.

CIRCULAR CAFETERIA
FLEMINGTON RACECOURSE, MELBOURNE.
1200 MEALS PER HOUR.
The unusual and spacious new
Cafeteria recently completed at the
V.R.C. Racecourse at Flemington has
been the subject of considerable coni'
ment.
The photographs that we illustrate
were taken when there was no racing,
and the deserted appearance is in the
sharpest contrast to race days, when it
is a mass of hungry punters having
that snack to keep up their morale or
celebrate their success.
The new Cafeteria was built as a
result of fire which destroyed a
previous somewhat inadequate lunch'
room. As the whole of the Hill site
is to be replanned and rebuilt, it was
decided to keep the Cafeteria in the
open area away from future possible
buildings. The existing main water
reservoir, which serves the course, had
always been an eyesore, and it was de'
cided to try to utilise the walls of this
structure as the back wall of a circular
open air Cafeteria, and it was, there'
fore, designed with a circular skillion
roof, draining back into the reservoir
itself.
It is designed for a capacity of 1200
meals per hour from the main Cafe'
teria section which is on quick'service
lines and with a separate tea and pie
bar capable of something in the order
of 1500 serves per hour.
When not in use, the steel roller
shutters let down from the top hamper
to the top edge of the counter and
enclose the whole of the interior
equipment.
Surrounding the service section is a
double ring of terrazzo'topped outdoor
tables, each fitted with a coloured
umbrella when in use. This is supple'
mented by an eating area on either
side of the main Cafeteria service sec'
tion, within cover of the main roof,
which is equipped with laminex'topped
stand'up tables.
There are three complete service
sets to the Cafeteria, each with a
double in and out queue. Stainless
steel tables for trays are placed at the
sides of the ingoes.

OPEN AIR MEAL AREA.
A generous area right around the circular service core is devoted to tables, the area being covered
by means of an extensive canopy-like circular roof.

Modem Equipment.
The whole of the heat for bain
maries, etc., is supplied by
steam generating plant, and all equip'
ment is of stainless steel. The service
of tea is made by means of a protect'
ed plastic tube bowser system by which
a dozen or more cups can be filled
rapidly at the one time at a special
serving section of the counter which is
drained. At the rear of the bain maries
are steam'heated pie warmers and cake
and sandwich shelves . Washing'Up is
done on a return system, with a cem
tral station at the rear of the Gafe'
teria section serviced by two washing
machines, mobile garbage cans and
rinsing sinks of stainless steel. The
whole of the area surrounding the
Cafeteria has been hard paved.
Special staff retiring room and all
amenities is planned at one end of the
building adjacent to the Boiler Room.
Prepared foods are brought in heat'
ed boxes from outside sources and are
conducted from the main bulk store to
the bain maries, pie warmers, etc., by
means of electrically' heated trollies
into which the canisters of the bain
maries can be fitted. Each bain marie
has a double set of canisters so that
they may be alternated for replenish'
ment purposes. The washing'up ser'
vice has a capacity of 1920 units of
dishes and utensils per hour.
The Architects were A. C. Leith,
Bartlett & Partners, and the Consulting
Mechanical and Heating Engineers
were Sydney R. Bell and Associates.
Westcott Hazell Engineering &
Steel Ltd. supplied the steam gene'
rators and Frank Curtis 6? Son were
responsible for the general plumbing.
New Standard
Contract
The Standards Association has is-
sued a new standard contract for civil
engineering works.
Called “Standard General Condi-
tions of Tendering and Contract for
Civil Engineering Works,” it is based
on generally accepted practice between
the parties engaged on the larger types
of construction.
It uses non-legal phraseology, yet
meets all legal principles.
Copies are available at 5/- from
the Sydney and Newcastle offices of
the Standards Association.
A similar set of conditions is now
being prepared by a committee of
specialists to cover electrical engineer-
ing works and general machinery.
There is also a form of contract
which was originally issued by the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects in conjunction with the Master
Builders’ Federation of Australia.

Dear Mrs. Taylor,
Your last issue was most informa'
tive, and I intend to pass on the article
about the automatic garage to Mr.

Mr. Sara has been preparing draw'
ings for a proposed garage on a site
behind the Strand Theatre that Signora
Spencer erected in Hunter Street,
Newcastle, for which Messrs. White
and Kaberry were the architects, in
1913.
I am interested in the fans included
in your description of the new Clark
brick'making plant. I believe they
were imported, but I would like to
have every scrap of information about
those two fans for reasons which I
could tell you of later and which in'
eluded among other expenses a tele-
phone call to New York.
I appreciated very much Mr.
Ashton’s article on the ancient cities
and am very anxious now to read the

I would like to write longer, and
so win the prize for the most appre'

perhaps I have already written enough
to win.
With best regards.

THE UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS
A REMARKABLE ARCHITECTURAL ACHIEVEMENT.
Completion of General Assembly Building,
The U.N.O. Tower on the East
River, New York, is now known all
over the world. Many, however, do
not realise that it is but part —certainly
the most dramatic part—of the United
Nations Headquarters and therefore as
the other major activities have just
been completed we will give a few
brief facts about this outstanding pro-
feet, which on account of the fact that
they are in the eyes of the world a
symbol of hope for world peace and
the visible expression of world govern-
ment, they may be regarded as an
architectural achievement of unique
importance.
The Site.
The site for the United Nations
buildings is seventeen and a half acres,
banded by the East River, Forty-second
Street, First Avenue and Forty-eighth
Street; part of the buildings are
cantilevered over the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Drive that runs along the
river’s edge.
Director of Planning
Appointed.
When the site was determined,
Wallace K. Harrison was appointed
Director of Planning by the U.N.
Research into requirements was first
undertaken: How many employees?
How many conference rooms? What
would be the relation of delegates and
staff? To what areas would the public
be admitted? What kind of library?
How much parking? etc., etc. The
organisation of the United Nations
may be summarised as follows;
The General Assembly, which is the
supreme governing body, consists of
Delegates from all the member States
and meets for two or three months in
the year.
The Security Council, Trusteeship
Council and Economic and Social
A few minutes before the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened on
October 14, 1952, delegates of the 60 member nations stepped from the lobby of the new Assembly
building on to a long escalator. The escalator led into the huge 2,054-seat General Assembly Hall
where the delegates took seats at their assigned desks. From their seats, delegates observed two tiers
of translators' cubicles set in strips of gilded South American mahogany. The long strips slant inward
and upward 75 feet toward the glass dome. Two large murals by France's Fernand Leger flank the
Hall. Like the Conference building, the Assembly is long and low. But where the Conference build-
ing is rectangular, the Assembly is sweepingly curved and capped with a large dome. One end,
that facing the Secretariat building, is clear plate glass. The other has translucent glass strips set
between marble columns.

Council, the fint of which is in pet'
manent session and the other two meet
three or four times a year.
The Secretariat, which is an inter'
nationally recruited Civil Service
which, headed by the Secretary
General, keeps the organisation run-
ning.
The Court of International Justice
sits at the Hague.
The Research finally decided that
the number of personnel to be plan'
ned for was 3200, exclusive of “ser-
vice” personnel.
Development of Plan.
Early in 1947 Mr. Harrison, with
Max Abramovitz as his Deputy Direc'
tor of Planning and the ten inter'
national design consultants G. A.
Soilleux (Australia), Gaston Brunfaut
(Belgium), Oscar Niemeyer (Brazil),
Ernest Cormier (Canada), Ssu'Ch’eng
Liang (China), Charles Le Corbusier
(France), Sven Markelius (Sweden),
N. D. Bassov (U.S.S.R.), Howard
Robertson (Great Britain), and Julia
Vilamjo (Uruguay) - began work on
the design. Fifty'three basic schemes,
some with three or four variations,
were developed and discussed, and
finally a scheme was unanimously
agreed upon—the first unanimous pre'
sentation ever made to the General
Assembly by a U.N. committee—pre'
sented, and approved.
Finance to the extent of 65,000,000
dollars was made available as an in'
terest' free loan by the United States,
repayable over thirty'two years. Final
cost was 68,000,000 dollars, which was
a very small increase for such a com'
plex problem.
The Secretariat Building.
The Secretariat building, the tallest
of the group, consists of thirty'nine
storeys above ground, and three storeys
underground. This rectangular'shaped
structure of steel and glass is located
at the southern end of the site area,
oriented north and south. It is 72ft.
wide, 287 ft. long, and 554 ft. above
street level.
Vertical transportation is provided
by eighteen highspeed elevators, two
service elevators, a freight elevator
and eight glass'enclosed moving stairs.
Six of the passenger elevators ter'
minate at the 15th floor, six at the
27th floor and six at the 38th floor.
The service elevators serve the base'
ment and all thirtymine floors.
Elevators and stairways are centrally
located in the building in order to
provide the maximum amount of
perimeter lighting. The building also
has an electric dumb waiter system in
a vertical conveyor system* extending
from the third basement to the 39th
floor; in addition, there is a pneumatic
tube system.
THE SECURITY AND TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL.
On the left is the Security Council, which was donated by Norway and designed
by Arnstein Arneberg. The Trusteeship Council on the right was given by Denmark
and designed by Finn Juhl. The third, the Economic and Social Council (not illus-
trated) given by Sweden, was the work of Even Markelius. Henry S. Churchill,
F.A.I.A., in a critical and descriptive article in the "Architectural Record" says:
"All three lack conviction; they are the expression of personal ideas of decoration,
not the expression of an underlying and common culture."

Conference Area
and Meeting Halls.
Adjoining the Secretariat building
on the east there is a seven-storey
building, comprising the Conference
area and meeting halls. This structure
houses three of the principal organs
and the Security Council, the Econo-
mic and Social Council and the Trus-
teeship Council, as well as other con-
ference and committee facilities.
The Conference area, which is con-
nected with both the General Assem-
bly building and the Secretariat offices,
is approximately 400 ft. long and 183 ft.
wide, and contains seven storeys, in-
cluding two basement levels, one con-
course floor, three floors above the
First Avenue entrance level.
The Council chambers for the three
Councils are on the upper level; these
rooms are 72ft. wide and 135 ft. long,
'with 24ft. ceilings. The chambers are
completely equipped with facilities for
technical services, including simul-
taneous interpretation into the five
official languages, press, radio, tele-
vision and film.
On the level directly below the
Council chambers are three large Con-
ference rooms of about the same size,
135 ft. long, 72ft. wide and 18ft. high;
there are also six smaller committee
rooms.
The main delegates’ lounge on the
delegates level in the north area is
36ft. wide, 175 ft. long and 24ft. high,
exclusive of the bay window, which
projects 10ft. The principal dining
area at the Headquarters is located on
the roof level, directly above the
Council chambers, and contains a dele-
gates’ restaurant, seating 300 people,
private dining rooms, and a Secretariat
cafeteria seating 400 people.
The General Assembly.
The General Assembly building has
a sloping form and a shallow dome.
It measures 380 ft. long and 160 ft.
wide. The north end, which is the
principal public entrance, has a facade
75ft. 6in. in height supporting the
roof, which slopes gradually downward
to 53ft. 6in. at the southern facade.
The tilted dome covers the delegates’
area in the Assembly auditorium.
There are five levels in the passage-
way connecting the General Assembly
building to the conference area. In the
two lower levels of the Assembly build-
ing there are radio studios, committee
rooms, maintenance areas, recording
rooms, and a master control room.
Also in these lower levels is the fourth
large conference room for Assembly
committees. The principal delegates’
entrance is on the west side of the
building off First Avenue.
The General Assembly auditorium
consists of a circular-shaped area, over
100 ft. in diameter, and capped with
the shallow dome. The entire build-
ing is equipped with an air-condition-
ing system of the latest design, and
the auditorium itself is served with all
sound devices and with motion-picture
projection facilities.
Underground Garage.
An underground garage, built in
three levels, accommodates 1500 cars.
It is partly under the General Assem-
bly building and partly under the
landscaped garden area. Numerous
entrances and exits are planned to pro-
vide a maximum degree of flexibility
in entering and leaving the garage, as
well as speediest. possible circulation
through it. The total area provided
for parking is about 600,000 square
feet.
Materials From All Over
The World.
In keeping with the international
character of the organisation, the
United Nations selected certain mate-
rials from many lands. Limestone for
the facings of the Assembly hall and
Conference area came from Britain,
marble from Italy, carpets, office furni-
ture and library shelving from France,
carpets from Scotland and England,
chairs and fabrics from Greece and
Czechoslovakia, tables and fabrics from
the Netherlands, tables from Switzer-
land, and various woods for interior
finishings from the Philippines, Cuba,
Guatemala, the Belgian Congo, Nor-
way. Belgium and Canada, while in
addition many governments have
made gifts.
In a critical and descriptive article
in a recent issue of the “Architectural
Record,” Henry Stan Churchill,
F.A.1.A., says: “The planning of the
U.N. group is a triumph of clarity
and ingenuity, a putting together and
sorting out of an almost incredible
variety of elements and functions. It
is also a triumph of technical skill, of
structural ability, of mechanical en-
gineering. Almost every possible de-
vice of a mechanised nature has been
used to further the comfort of the
users of the buildings, to speed-up
communications, to disseminate infor-
mation quickly and accurately. It is,
in other words, a very fine example of
American architectural skill.
“It is not, however, much more
than that: and perhaps it could not be.
Our architectural genius to-day, and in
the United States particularly, lies in
the design of buildings for the use of
business. Our most successful struc-
tures, aesthetically as well as technical-
ly, are office buildings and factories.
“The Secretariat is the U.N. to the
world. By its simplicity of form and
dominating mass it has become the
symbol for U.N. The General Assem-
bly building does not dominate either
by its physical presence or its spiritual
content. The failure is not the fault
of the architects, but of a time in
which no emotional symbols are pos-
sible because there is no deep belief,
no emotional content in our lives.
Symbols, great art, are not created ad
hoc, they are inherent in the cultural
and emotional heritage and appear as
such, whether we like it or not.”
ELECTRIC PAINT REMOVER.
The General Electric Company
(U.S.A.) is now marketing a new
electric paint remover designed to
lift paint off quickly and economi-
cally through the use of radiant heat.
Development for both home and
commercial use and selling at $l5
f£A.6/17/6), the paint remover con-
sists of two skids between which is
mounted a 1000-watt tubular heater.
The heat from the unit softens and
blisters the paint so that it can be re-
moved with a putty knife.
Old paint, it is claimed, can be
removed as quickly as the operator
can scrape it off.
INTRICATE MECHANICAL SERVICES.
At three levels the repetitive designs formed by the window mullions and divisions
is broken by the different grille work of the glass that are devoted entirely to hous-
ing the extensive and intricate mechanical services of the building. On the left
we see the interior of one of the floors. On the right Is the roof showing the
open grillework that surrounds it to screen the various roof-top units and thus
maintain the uniformity of the facade treatment.

COLONEL ALFRED SPAIN
ILL IN SYDNEY HOSPITAL BUT NOW “ON THE MEND”
A Remarkable Career of Achievement.
The many friends of Colonel Alfred
Spain will be sorry to learn that he
lies ill in Sydney Hospital. Although
suffering from the effects of a stroke
his virile character as ever is asserting
itself and he chats away with his usual
keenness and opens his mail expertly
with his unaffected hand.
It is difficult to believe that Col.
Spain was born in 1868, which by
simple arithmetic makes him in his
eighty-fifth year. Truly a remarkable
man, for with his direct speech and
dynamic and virile personality, a reas-
onable assessment of his age would
be the early sixties. His keenness and
the immense amount of public service
that he is still rendering is an excellent
argument against the fallacy of early
retirement and the transition from a
life of activity to one of comparative
stagnation which is so often fatal.
The following details of his career
are taken from an article in the series
“Australia’s Elder Architects,’’ written
by Adrian Ashton, F.R.1.8.A., and
published in “Building: Lighting: En-
gineering’’ in 1946.
“Alfred Spain was born in Neutral
Bay and has lived there ever since,
his present home being in Shell Cove,
Kurraba Point.
Having received his initial education
at various Sydney private schools he
commenced his technical life in 1884
by attending the Sydney Technical
College, which, in those days was a
very small organisation compared with
the College of to-day. His associates
in those days included Tom Cosh,
who was later to become his partner
over so many years, and loe Kethel,
both of whom have now passed on.
Col. Spain recalls with pleasure
that the late limmy Nangle—a name
which will for ever be revered as the
Father of the Technical College was
also one of his fellow students, and
how together they embarked upon a
special course of practical brickwork.
Years ago dear old limmy, puffing
away at his pipe and knocking the
ashes in the huge brass jardiniere that
always served him as an ash-tray, used
to tell me anecdotes about those self-
same days.
Articled in 1884.
At the same time that he commenc-
ed his studies at the Tech, he was
articled at the early age of 16 to
Thomas Rowe, F.R.l.B.A.—father of
Ruskin Rowe—of the firm of Rowe 6?
Green, whose offices were located in
Vickery Chambers, Pitt Street. Other
members of the junior staff of the
office included E. 1. F. Crawford, Alex.
Virtue, Charles McCrea, H. N. Davis,
and G. V. F. Mann, who later forsook
the architectural life and became the
Director of the National Art Gallery
of N.S.W. Alex. Virtue remained as-
sociated with Spain throughout his
life and became Spain &? Cosh’s right-
hand man for many years.
It is often said that one’s student
days are the happiest, and judging by
the appreciative chuckle from the Col-
onel when narrating the following in-
cident, there is a good deal of truth
in this assertion. He recalled how the
five lads used to take it in turns to
gor out —no doubt, to slip out —to a
fruit stall near the present Dalton
House and return with a large bag of
huge Fijian bananas- —which in those
halcyon days were 24 for sixpence—
to keep up their strength till lunch-
time.
In 1890, his six years of assiduous
study at the College and with his firm
were rewarded by a Bronze Medal
awarded by the School of Science and
Art, South Kensington, London, which
conducted competitive examinations
throughout the Empire, for the de-
sign of a Town Hall. It was the only
one awarded in the Colonies for that
year, and in addition to the medal
carried a Studentship at the School,
which, however, young Spain was un-
able to take up. In any case perhaps
he had other ideas, for a year later he
started on his own —those magic
words to any professional man when
full of anticipation he waits for all
his dreams and hopes to be transmut-
ed into the reality of actual practice.
Partnership Formed.
In 1893, however, he was invited
into partnership with his old chief,
Thomas Rowe, as well as William
Wright Campbell, who at that time
was in charge of the School of Ar-
chitecture at the Technical College.
Thus the firm of Rowe, Campbell &
Spain was formed and the following
advertisement appeared to apprise the
public of this fact—
NOTICE OF PARTNERSHIP
It is hereby notified that
Thomas Rowe

And intend practising their
Profession at
VICKERY'S CHAMBERS,
72 and 78 PITT ST., SYDNEY
Thomas Rowe,
W. Wright Campbell,
Alfred Spain.
January 1, 1893.
The new partnership, however, was
not destined to carry on very long,
for first of all Wright Campbell died,
to be followed in 1899 by Thomas
Rowe, thus leaving young Spain once
again on his own.
One of the first important undertak-
ings of the new partnership was the
remodelling of the building in which
they were established, Vickery’s
Chambers, 72-78, and also the ad-
joining premises of Chrisopher New-
ton, 78-72, Pitt St. Incidentally, Vick-
ery’s Chambers persisted until 1939,
when Bryant House, now Queensland
Insurance Building, was erected.
Early Commissions.
Another interesting job carried out
by the firm was the construction of
St. Clement’s Anglican Church at
Marrickville, which the firm won in
competition. In thos days for work
of this type it was the custom for the
building contract to be divided into
two parts, and he recalls that the gen-
eral contractor was Alfred Bignell,
while W. J. Brown was the contract-
or for the stone and brickwork. This
church was also unique in that it had
the first spire with a structural steel
frame to be erected in Australia, the
contract being entrusted to the Amer-
ican Bridge Co.
In 1899 the firm were appointed
architects to the Fire Brigade Board,
which resulted in Col. Spain being as-
sociated with the design and construc-
tion of buildings for the Fire Brigade

over a long period of years. He said
that he found the work most interest'
ing and looks back upon this part of
his professional life with great pleas-
ure.
He recalls that on one of the first
jobs for the Board —-the construction
of a station at Concord —he was in-
vited to make an inspection trip with
the then Fire Chief, Alfred Webb,
who was desirous of trying out a
couple of horses to test their suitability
for service with the fire engine. For
this trip the horses were harnessed to
a light vehicle, and outward bound
and also on the way home until they
were approaching the city, all was well,
when apparently the horses were sud-
denly afflicted with nostalgia for their
stable and evening oats or they smelt
some smoke, or perhaps they were
anxious to take this last opportunity
of proving their worth, for they start-
ed off full speed with the light vehicle
swaying perilously, and the two Al-
freds, like Roman gladiators, doing
their utmost to keep it on an even
keel. Possibly Spain’s interest in af-
fairs nautical enabled his navigational
skill to save the day, for they arrived
back at Fire Headquarters breathless
but right side up.
The Wheat Arch.
In 1901 the firm was commissioned
by the Wheatgrowers (Messrs. Win-
chcombe & Rickard were the treas-
urers of the movement) at very short
notice to erect what was described as
the Wheat Arch in Bridge Street near
the Royal Exchange, in connection
with the celebrations following the
formation of the Commonwealth.
Triumphal arch.es, representing the
various primary industries, wool,
wheat, etc., were constructed down
the length of Bridge Street, the Wheat
Arch with its motto “Ceres Welcomes
the Commonwealth,” spanning from
the corner of the Lands Department
to Mort’s statue. Spain recalls how
this job, a photograph of which hangs
upon his office wall, was carried out
at a very reasonable cost in the short
space of twentV'one days.
After the unfortunate death of his
two partners. Spain carried on unaid'
ed for five years, but his practice was
expanding so rapidly that he decided
to form a parnership with his old
student friend, Tom Cosh, so in 1904
the firm of Spain and Cosh was form'
ed, the new firm being also established
at Vickery’s Chambers and many im'
portant buildings were erected.
Military Career.
The Colonel’s military career com'
menced in 1890, when he received
his first commission as a Lieutenant,
and he now enjoys the privilege of
being the oldest surviving member of
the original Engineer Corps. In
1910 he received his volunteer dis'
tinction, V.D., for twenty years’ con'
tinuous service, this being one of the
last awards to be issued by King
Edward VII.
Having formed the firm of Spain
and Cosh, the Colonel then felt free
to journey to England to further his
military career, and in 1905 he visit'
ed the Old Country and was stationed
at both Aldershot and Chatham with
the Royal Engineers for special courses
of training. He had hardly retired in
1910 when, with the advent of World
War I. he was recalled for active set'
vice and organised and commanded
Engineers A.I.F. reinforcement camps
and Engineers depots, Sydney, after
which he enlisted for service aboard
with the A.I.F. and was with the Sea
Transport Service, 1916-1917. After
the war he retired with the rank of
Colonel and with a fine record of
thirty years’ service for King and
Country. He still retains his associa-
tion with his old Corps and is Patron
of the Engineers’ Sub-branch of the
R.S.L.
Tribute From Builders.
Prior to leaving for abroad in 1905
he received a unique tribute from the
various builders and contractors with
whom he had been associated in his
professional life, and surely no archi-
tect could receive a greater compli-
ment than the wording of the inscrib-
ed address of esteem which was hand'
ed to him on this occasion (as illus'
trated opposite). The signatories were
all welhknown builders of the period,
G. P. Jones, A. W. Robey, R. D.
Sime, N. W. Trevaskis, and P. Me'
Intyre.
The Colonel in his turn pays tribute
to many of the early master builders
who have been responsible for the
construction of a number of the im'
portant buildings in this city, who
have since passed away. Such men as
Alexander Dean 6? Sons, William
Stuart, R. D. Sime, W. Coleman.
Baxter 6? Boyne, W. Mounsey, T.
Wall, Tom Wall, ]. M. Pringle, Me'
Intyre & Tones, A. A. Scott, Adam'
son & Dow, Duncan Mcßae, David
Brodie, Alfred Bignell, W. I. Brown,
McLeod Bros., Tohn White, and Love'
ridge 6? Hudson.
“I have been associated with all
those mentioned in the erection of
many buildings in this city, and I live
to appreciate the valuable assistance,
knowledge and experience which is so
essential in the execution of the work
entrusted to them.
“I have often thought what a loss
it is to the profession and community
generally when death removes men
with such a high standard of know'
ledge and ability.”
Apart from his profession and the
Army, the Colonel has always had
two other great loves—the Zoo and
the sea —and he was never happier
than when planning the extension of
Taronga Park, cleaving the blue waters
of Sydney Harbour or Broken Bay in
his 32ft. auxiliary cruiser, “Bonito,”
or following the art of Izaak Walton.
Mention of the author of “The
Compleat Angler” draws attention to
the fact that when he went abroad in
1905 he was requested by the Com'
monwealth Government to represent
it at the International Congress of
Fisheries in Vienna, and how tragic
it is in the light of recent history to
hear the Colonel enthuse about the
beauties of the Vienna of those days.
What a marvellous city, full of life,
happiness, music and sunlight, and
how, as number eleven on the list of

300 delegates, he was personally pre-
sented to the Emperor, Franz Tosef.
Perhaps, however, he remembers even
more vividly than these colourful
scenes the salmon and trout and
other “glorious hospitality”—he did
not explain whether this came out of
a bottle or not —which he received
on this occasion.
Taronga Park.
Col. Spain first became associated
with the Zoo when in 1910, as a Vice-
President of the Royal Zoological So-
ciety, he was approached by the late
Hon. Fred. Flowers, M.L.C., to bring
to a head the various new site pro-
posals which had been cropping up
for years. He was one of those who
strongly supported the move to Ta-
ronga, and in due course Government
approval was gained and in October.
1912, after four years of hard work,
the grounds were ready for the ani-
mals to be moved from Moore Park,
though it was not till four years later
that the Taronga Zoological Park was
opened to the public on October 7,
1916. It is interesting to note that
the word “Taronga” in the Australian
Aboriginal language signifies “sea
view,” wffiich is certainly appropriate.
On the death of the Hon. Fred.
Flowers, the first Chairman of the
Trust formed to administer the Park,
Col. Spain was appointed Chairman
in 1928, a position which he retained
until December, 1941, when, owing to
the provisions in the Public Reserve
Trustee Bill, it became necessary for
him to retire. The Trust, however,
expressed the desire that he should still
accepted the position of Honorary
has accepted the position of Honorary
Consultant. As the Architect and prac-
tical man on the Trust, Col. Spain
has been the main constructive brain
behind the development of the Park
over the years, and to describe him
as Col. Spain of Kurraba and Taronga
would certainly not have been amiss.
In any case, his work there will remain
forever as a living memorial to his
life and work.
Keen Yachtsman.
As if the various events already
narrated were not sufficient for any
one man’s lifetime, they are only a
few of his many activities. For
many years he has been Chair-
man of the Anniversary Regatta held
every year on Sydney Harbour on
January 26, Anniversary Day, this love
of yachting being reflected in the fact
that he belongs to Royal Sydney
Yacht Squadron.
As a yachtsman he is, of course,
interested in meteorology and has
found weather synopsis very helpful
m his boating experience, especially
in deep sea fishing excursions. “You
should always,” he says, “be on the
alert to know when it is advisable to
return to port.
“I have three barometers and a
baragraph. which I check up every
day but it is only by long experience
which enables you to form some idea
as to what the tricky movements of
the weather, particularly cloud forma-
tion. is going to produce.
“When the rain is before the winde
Your topsail sheets and halyards
mind.”
That he can also look after himself
and other when maritime accidents do
occur is borne out by the fact that he
was awarded the Royal Shipwreck So-
ciety’s Silver Medal for gallantry in
saving life in Sydney Harbour in
March, 1934.
Many Interests.
He is a Past President of many
years standing of the United Ser-
vice Institution of N.S.W., of the
Royal Empire Society, Vice-President
of the Boy Scouts' Association, as well
as being a member of the Fishing As-
sociation for fifty years, an association

Spain has always been interested in
the development of the city on pro-

is gained in the following address made
before the Association in 1928:
“Sydney Harbour Bridge is no long'
er a figurement of the imagination,
and before many years it will be an
accomplished fact. But what consid'
eration is being given to'day to the
question of the control of the traffic
at the bridge heads, more particu'
larly on the southern side of the har'
hour? ... In another few years an'
other great city will surely arise on
the other side of the harbour. Im'
mediate consideration should be given
to the opening up of a new avenue
of traffic from the southern bridge
head, feeding the whole of the western
districts, crossing over the reclaimed

portion of Darling Harbour, and con

Col. Spain is a man full of keenness
who has no time to think of the pass-
ing of time, a man who believes in
the greatness and destinv of the Brit-
ish Empire and who has served it
faithfully for thirty years as a soldier,
a man who lives a full life and who
is consequently happy in work achiev-
ed and in the service rendered to his
country and his fellow men.”
It is fitting that his highest reward
—a most distinctive honor —should
have reached him in this hospital,
which was designed originally by his
former first partner, Mr. T. Rowe, of
Rowe & Spain, long before they be-
came partners and over whose welfare
and destiny he had kept watch and
ward for so many years. It came in a
letter informing him that it had been
decided to name the Out-door Pa-
tients’ Department, that he had offi-
cially opened three months ago;
“The Colonel Alfred Spain
Outdoor Patients’ Department.”
In an honor like this there is some-
thing that will live down the ages
of time, letting the world of today
and generations vet to come know
that in our day one —Alfred Spain—
lived to benefit mankind which in-
cluded the sick and the wounded.
We sincerely trust that Col. Spain
will overcome his present illness and
return again to his beloved Harbour
at Neutral Bay.
BIG FLATS NEAR COMPLETION
COSTLY PROJECT AT MILSON'S POINT
The Housing Commission’s huge
block of flats at Milson’s Point is ex-
pected to be completed by the end
of this year.
They will have taken three years
more to construct than was first esti-
mated.
The cost —now expected to be
about <£900,000 —will be <£300,000
above the original estimate, or just
under £3OOO a flat which must be con-
sidered “pricey” for flats of 1 or 2
bedrooms.
309 Flats.
The four blocks (see illustration)
contain a total of 309 flats.
Tenants are already living in two
blocks —one of 28 flats, and one of
37.
The two 12-storey flats containing
122 flats each are yet to be complet-
ed.
The builders, F. T. Eastment and
Sons, hope to have one of these
blocks completed by June, and the
second one finished by August.
Delays.
Preliminary work began in No-
vember, 1948, with November, 1950,
as the target date for completion.
Shortages of building materials and
labour held the work up in its initial
stages.
The shortage of local structural steel
delayed the work for 18 months.
A considerable saving resulted by
waiting for local steel instead of us-
ing the imported product.
The flats consist of one and two
bedroom units.
Rents range from £3 to <£3/14/0
for one-bedroom units and from <£3/
18/0 to £4 a week for two-bedroom
units.
Because costs are still rising, rents
of flats in the 12-storey “A” and “C”
blocks still under construction, are ex-
pected to be higher still.

How Eire Houses Its People
SENSIBLE SCHEMES MAKE HAPPY CITIZENS.
Last year the Eire Government paid
out £ 1,800.000 in State housing
grants. With a population of
3,000.000 Eire had, at last count a
housing list of about 40,000. The
Government’s idea in giving money
to its people to build houses is to
get them into homes worth living in.
This is how Eire’s idea works . . . .
Anyone who wants to build a
house can get a Government grant
of from £175 to £275, depending on
how many rooms the house has.
Anyone! And no questions asked!
[Not like in Australia. A Korean
returned soldier cannot get a home
under the Government War Service
Homes Scheme as the Government
does not recognise this as a war,
though some of the poor things have
been freezing at 40° below zero—to
fight for us.]
It doesn’t matter whether home'
seekers are married or single, Irish,
English, or Scotch, millionaire or
pauper.
The only rule is that the house must
not be over a certain floor space. That
is to stop rich people building man'
sions with State help.
How It is Done.
Let us examine two cases quoted in
a recent report on Eire housing.
These families live in County Dublin.
Family “A” —man, wife, and small
child —live in a pink pebble'dash
semi'detached house with front and
back gardens, four bedrooms, a lounge
and dining room. It cost them
£l9OO.
The husband. 26 years of age, earns
£8 a week. How can a young man
on a small wage afford to buy such a
house?
They were living in a flat (flats
are plentiful in Dublin) when they
decided to get a house of their own.
They went out to a building estate
at Santry near Dublin, and saw the
type of house they wanted to live in.
Then they went to the Customs
House in Dublin and applied for the
Government grant of £275.
It came in two instalments —half
when the walls were up and the bah
ance when the roof was on. The
husband signed the back of the Gov'
ernment cheques and handed them
over to the builder as part of the cost.
If he had lived in another county
he might have got another £l4O from
the county council—free. For any
county can if it wishes, give couples
up to half the amount of the Gov'
ernment grant where the means justi'
fy it. Most counties do.
Finally, husband “A” got a council
loan of £1250, payable at 28/' a
week over 20 years. If he had so
desired, he could have spread the pay'
ments over 35 years. Interest is
5|%.
The council loan, plus the Govern'
ment grant, still left husband “A”
with over £3OO to find, as the loan
of £275 cannot be used as a deposit
on the house.
However, the husband in question
had saved the £3OO. If he hadn’t,
perhaps the builder —as some builders
in Eire do- —would have taken a*£2s
deposit and the rest in instalments.
The family, for the next seven
years, get two'thirds of their rates
paid by the State.
Family “B.”
Family “B” lives in a £2450 house
in Glenomena, County Dublin, built
their house with the aid of the grant,
and were one of about 5000 people a
year who apply for Government hous'
ing grants.
Their house, comfortable and spa'
dous is a credit to the architect, the
builder the owner, and the State.
A lot of people say that builders,

floor polishes that come off, windows
that are broken and mud all over the
floors.
To a builder it is another method
of construction, drawings to be inter-
preted, material shortages to be over-
come, men to be encouraged to be
conscientious and to give of their best.
To an architect the school building
and site are one, to be laid out for
present needs and for possible future
changes. Together they are to be de-
signed to encourage the growth, health
and happiness of children and teacher
and to suit all those who are concern-
ed in any way with the initial creation
and final use of both building and site.
Although the author has primarily
been concerned with British schools in
his work, the present book illustrates
and analyses recent school design and
construction in America, Switzerland
and Stockholm, giving plans and basic
data.
It is only necessary to scan through
this splendid book, which is right up
to the minute, being only published
in November, 1952, to realise the vast
changes that have taken place since
the appalling schools of the Victorian
era and its aftermath, when the major
matter of consideration was the orna-
mentation of the facade.
To-day, all that is changed, and
even in this impersonal functionalistic
era it is not enough for a school to
be efficient, logical and hygienic, but
to be a real contribution to the rising
generation it should possess grace and
-'harm, be a place where children can
indeed absorb, perhaps unconsciously,
hose essential values and virtues which
need forever to be restated in acts,
embodied in deeds and preserved in
work.
Layouts.
The smallest one-bedroom flat con-
sists of—Living room, 12ft 6in by
12ft. 6in.; Bedroom, 12ft 6in. by
10ft.; Kitchenette, sft. x 12ft., with
built-in cupboards, stainless steel sink,
electric stove, tiled walls. (Only a
small refrigerator will fit into the re-
cess provided in the tiny kitchens.)
Bathroom, with bath, toilet, basin,
electric hot water heater, tiled walls.
The largest unit consists of—Veran-
dah, 6ft. by lift.; Living room, 16
ft. by lift. 6in.: Bedroom No. I,
12ft. by 13ft.; Bedroom No. 2,13 ft.
by 9ft.; Kitchenette, containing items
as in smaller units —6ft. by 13ft.;
Bathroom as for smaller flat; En-
trance hall.
Some Lifts.
Blocks “B” and “D“ are “walk-
ups.” They have no lift\ but blocks
“A” and “C” will have two'ff(ts each.
Tenants on the fourth floor of “D”
block have to descend down five
flights of stairs when they want to
use the communal laundry situated
beneath the building.
They have to descend down or
climb up only two flights of stairs to
leave the building, because the block
is built on a steep slope, with the sec-
ond storey at street level.
“B” block consists of three floors
and a basement.
Besides the lack of lifts, the noise of
electric trains, trams, and traffic on
the nearby harbour bridge is already
harassing tenants.
They are finding that there is little
or no “luxury” living in what will
ultimately be the £1,000,000 Green-
away flats.
(continued from previous page)
knowing they will automatically get
£275 from the Government towards
the cost of a house, just as automati-
cally put their prices up. But the
£2450 home of Family “B“ is worth
every penny that it cost.
Other Schemes.
This is not Eire’s only housing
scheme. Anyone who wants to build
a house for letting can get a grant of
£250 to £4OO spread over 10 years.
People living in old houses that
need rebuilding can obtain grants up
to £l2O, plus up to £6O from the
county council in some cases.
Wisely, the Eire Government en-
courages the people to better their liv-
ing conditions, knowing full well it is
worth money to get the population
out of old one-storey thatched cottages
and rickety rooming houses into decent
homes.
In the long run it will pay off.
Such a system could also pay off in
Australia, if we could only divorce
politics from housing, as Eire has
done.
EXCITING DESIGN.
American architects and structural
engineers are producing some exciting
designs in some of their recent build-
ings for stadia, auditaria, arenas, etc.
We illustrate the first unit of a vast
Agricultural Centre that is being built
for the State of Alabama on a 70-acre
tract near Montgomery’s city limits.
This dramatic coliseum will have per-
manent seating for 9060, to be used
primarily for fairs, livestock shows,
and large State-wide meetings, though
it will also be available for rodeos,
concerts, etc.
Without question, the most remark-
able things about this concrete struc-
ture are the round plan, roofed by a
barrel arch of thin-shell (3-inch) con-
crete. the axis of which runs at right-
angles to the axis of the arena, and
the fact that the frame and the seating
are independent structures. Thus, the
greatest height and consequently,
most seating occurs at the ideal.
50-yard-line zone. The firm of
Ammann 6? Whitney were consultants
for the thin-shell roof.

COMMON LAW LIABILITY
MASTER BUILDERS’ ASSOCIATION HEARS INFORMATIVE
ADDRESS
At the last general meeting of the
Master Builders’ Association of
N.S.W., the manager of the Federa-
[tion Insurance Co. Ltd., Mr. C. J.
Champion, gave members an informa'
tive address on Common Law Liability.
Because of the importance of this
subject, we present the address in the
interests of members who were unable
to attend the meeting and all other
readers.
In his address, Mr. Champion said
that the purpose of his talk was to
briefly outline to members of the As-
sedation some insurance matters
which affect members in the normal
conduct of their business affairs, with
particular regard to their liability at
Common Law.
The legal liability in this regard is,
is a general rule, based on negligence,
ind it was considered necessary to
jriefly discuss the term “negligence”
is applied in this connection. Neg'
igence has been defined as “the omis'
ion td do something which a reason'
ble man acting upon those consider'
tions which ordinarily regulate the
onduct of human affairs, would do”
~or —“the doing of something which
prudent and reasonable man would
lot do. It could be defined as the
ailure to use such care as it was
be duty of the person charged to use
i the circumstances, and consequent'
l there must be a duty to take care.
- could be that in certain circum'
:ances a considerable amount of care
’as taken, but there may be, in fact,
duty to take greater care.
Every person has a liability to every
ther person, but this liability can, of
)urse, only arise where negligence
in be proved. The onus of proving
Jgligence lies upon the person who
leges he has been injured, and actual
:gligence must be shown. The mere
ct that an accident occurs on dam'
:e is caused, is not sufficient.
Claims can be made by the injured
:rsons themselves, or by a husband,
the wife has been injured in an acci'
:nt, for loss of her services as well
for medical and other expenses.
ie dependants of a deceased person
)uld also have a right of action at
>mmon Law, should the deceased
rson s death have been caused by
gligence of some other party.
People whose entry on to land or
emises is not the result of any spec'
contract relating to the land or
toperty, may be divided into three
classes—Invitees, Licensees and Tres-
passers. The liability of the occupier
for injury suffered by them whilst on
his premises depends on the class into
which the particular person falls.
• An invitee is a person who en-
ters for a purpose of which the occu-
pier himself has some pecuniary, ma-
terial, or business interest. The oc-
cupier must use reasonable care to
prevent damage to him from any un-
usual danger of which the occupier
knows or ought to know.
• A licensee is a person who comes
on to the premises with the occupier’s
consent but not in connection with
some matters in which he has a pecun-
iary material or business interest. The
occupier must take reasonable care to
prevent the licensee relying on the
appearance of safety and thus sus-
taining harm from danger of which
the occupier is aware, but the licensee
is not.
• A trespasser is a person who en-
ters without the consent of the occu-
pier. He cannot complain of any in-
jury he may receive unless it arises
from a wilful act of the occupier.
It has sometimes been argued that
children form a fourth class addi-
tional to the classes of Invitee, Li-
censee, and Trespasser, but the posi-
tion with regard to children does re-
quire careful consideration. If a child
is proved to be a trespasser, its rights
are no better than any other tres-
passer. It is true, however, that
where a person has some allurement
on his land which is particularly at-
tractive to children, and knows that
children are in the habit of entering
his property to play on it, the Courts
are very ready to infer that he has
licensed them to do so. unless it is
shown that he has taken steps to keep
them off his land. Where a child
is on property with the permission
of the occupier it must be remember-
ed that things which do not constitute
traps for an adult, may constitute a
trap for children, and the occupier, if
he knows of it, must take reasonable
care to render the children safe from
k?” 1 ’ , AJso ’ an occupier might be
able to discharge his duties by posting
notices of a concealed danger, where-
as this might be insufficient in the
case . ,°‘ a child. In addition, what
could be contributory negligence on
the part of an adult, may not be con-
tnbutory negligence on the part of a
child.
The whole question of Common
Law Liability with the introduction of
Compulsory Third Party Insurance in
connection with motor vehicles, has
had the effect of making the public
“claim conscious” with regard to any
injury sustained, however slight, and
the injured person immediately con'
siders against whom a claim should
be lodged. Publicity given by the
press to actions for damages has also
been a contributory factor to this
position.
As regards Common Law Liability
to employees, it was pointed out
that should an employee meet with
an accident arising out of, or in the
course of his work, he is entitled to
receive compensation from his env
ployer in terms of the Workers’ Com'
pensation Act. On the other hand,
however, should the accident have
been caused by the negligence of the
employer, or some defect in the em'
ployer’s ways, works, plant, or ma-
chinery, the injured employee, or his
dependants, can elect to claim dam-
ages from the employer at Common
Law. Such a claim could eventuate,
e.g., should an employee be killed or
injured as the result from a fall from
a ladder, and it could be proved that
the ladder was in a bad state of repair,
in such case an action could be
brought against the employer at
Common Law for substantial damages.
In this connection it was clearly point'
ed out that the normal Workers’ Com'
pensation Policy issued in New South
Wales by insurance companies gen'
erally, protects the employer in re'
spect of liability under the Workers’
Compensation Act, and also provides
indemnity in respect of claims at Com'
mon Law brought by employees in the
direct employ of the employer, but
whilst all liabilities under the Work'
ers’ Compensation Act are covered
the indemnity in respect of claims at
Common Law is limited to £1000 in-
clusive of all costs and expenses in-
curred!
In view of the steady increases in
awards made in Common Law actions
in recent years, it could be that the
amount of £1000 would provide in'
sufficient protection. It is possible to
extend existing Workers’ Compensa'
tion policies to include indemnity for
amounts in excess of £1000 on the
payment of an additional premium on
the existing Workers’ Compensation
premium, and it was suggested to
members that they give careful con-
sideration to extending their Work'
ers’ Compensation policy in this re-
gard.
It was also pointed out that under
orkers Compensation Act persons
m receipt of more than £1250 per
annum, exclusive of overtime, bonus
and special allowances, were not
workers within the meaning of the
Workers’ Compensation Act, but that
employers, notwithstanding the fact
that they would have no liability urn

der the Act to such employees, could
i have liability at Common Law, and it
was suggested that arrangements be
| made to protect themselves in this
' connection also.
Public Liability.
Reference has been made to Com-
pulsory Third Party legislation and it
is often overlooked that the employer
stands in exactly the same relationship
to the public as the motorist, as re-
gards claims which may be made
should a member of the public be in-
jured or his property damaged arising
out of the negligence of the employer
or through any person for whose
negligence the employer is liable or
through any defect in his premises.
Many cases have arisen where in-
jury to members of the public has
been caused through negligence, e.g.,
dropping of tools, carrying of ladders,
etc., which have been followed by
substantial claims for damages upon
the employer at Common Law. Con-
sequently, it was suggested that mem-
bers of the Association should effect
Public Liability Insurance to protect
themselves in respect of such claims.
It was also pointed out that under
the normal Public Liability Policy, a
member could have indemnity under
the policy for an amount in excess
of £IOOO, but unless his policy had
been fully extended and additional
premium paid ,the indemnity in re-
spect of claims for fire damage could
be limited to £1000!
Fire Insurance.
Having regard to the position
which has arisen over the past few
years it was strongly suggested that
members should ascertain that the
amount of cover provided by their
insurance is adequate to indemnify
them in the event of loss, and to see
that the amount of cover was com-
mensurate with the value of the pro-
perty concerned. It had been found
that in many cases insurances had
been effected some years ago for an
amount in keeping with the value,
but that in the event of a loss it was
found that the amount of insurance
was entirely inadequate, due to not
having been kept in line with rising
values.
It was also pointed out that fire
insurance covering property at var-
ious situations was usually subject to
the conditions of average, and that in
members’ interests they should satisfy
themselves that the full value of the
property in all situations was covered,
otherwise in these particular circum-
stances the Average Clause would ap-
ply and they would only be obtaining
a proportion of their loss.
It was also strongly suggested that
members should extend their fire pol-
icy to cover the risk of explosion,
whether fire ensued or not.
Personal Accident Insurance.
It was pointed out that members
were compelled by the Workers’ Com-
pensation Act to provide weekly bene-
fits, medical and hospital expenses,
etc., to their employees should they
be injured at work, but that if the
employer suffered an injury himself,
no such benefit is provided, and that
in such circumstances it would prob-
ably be necessary for him to go to
the expense of engaging additional
labour, or he would at least be in-
volved in medical and hospital ex-
penses. To cover this contingency it
is possible to effect a Personal Acci-
dent only, or Accident and All sick-
ness insurance for a scale of benefits
including a payment of a weekly
benefit to meet the various require-
ments, and such policy would provide
cover for the full 24 hours of the
day.

STEEL SPEEDS
PROGRESS
gEHIND most of the developments which make this land of
ours a better place in which to live and work, stand the
furnaces and mills of the steel industry, for steel is man's most
versatile metal . . . the tool and material of progress.
Without iron and steel, the achievements of modern
industry, agriculture and transport would be virtually impossible.
Helping speed Australia's development are the 23,500 men and
women of the B.H.P. organisation, supplying the nation with
iron and steel, and building for the future.
The industry’s steel-making capacity is being expanded by
more than one third, and new plant installed . . . more steel

SAGA OF NELSON’S COLUMN
CONSTRUCTION FEAT RECALLED.
With the approach of the Corona'
j tion. Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar
Square is being scrubbed to grace the
occasion. Always at national rejoic'
ings the London crowds congregate
around this massive monument, but
few pause to think of its momentous
history.
lust before the crowning of King
William IV. in 1830 the royal mews
and stables in the heart of London
were demolished, leaving the huge
open space that is now Trafalgar
Square. For a long time it seemed
as though it would remain waste
ground for ever.
Historians relate that, when a block
of flats was originally built on the
eastern side, the first tenant to move
in found that —after years of talk-
he still had no address. Most Lon'
doners called it the “lumberyard”.
The authorities wanted to dub it
“King William IV.’s Square” The
architect favoured a name to com'
memorate Nelson’s final sacrifice. But
no one had the courage to tell the
King so . . . until in the end the
worried architect went to the monarch
himself.
Trafalgar Square.
Bluff, sailorly William instantly
scrawled across a map: “Trafalgar
Square,” with his royal signature. A
civil servant commented: “It’s most
irregular.” Even then it was 34 years
after the Battle of Trafalgar before an
architects’ competition for designs for
a Nelson monument was announced-
and a further 28 years before Land'
seer’s lions arrived. They were cast
from guns recovered from the wreck
of the “Royal George.”
Architect John Nash wanted a
temple in the middle of the Square
to house the Royal Academy. An'
other visionary saw Nelson straddling
an enormous globe in the centre of a
huge artificial lake. One designer
suggested a cast'iron column 218 ft.
high. Ultimately a 203 ft. granite
column was decided upon.
Then the Government ordered the
height should be reduced to 170 ft.
6 inches. Actually the column tops
184 ft. and is therefore illegal!
18-Ton Statue.
Our great'great'grandparents sub'
scribed their pennies and sixpences
for the column, and the cheese'paring
Government reluctantly met scarcely
half the cost. Paid for by the British
public, the 18'ton statue of Nelson was
carved out of Scottish granite. This
may sound a queer tribute for such a
patriotic Englishmen on the one hand,
but on the other hand “nothing but
the best was good enough” and so the
stone had to be Scottish granite.
When the finished statue was at last
ready for inspection at ground level
it was inspected by 100.000 people in
two days.
From head to toe. Nelson stands
17ft. tall, his hat measures a
yard and a quarter across and his
sword is over seven feet long. The
detail is complete even to the design
of his saucer'size medals. The big
thrill came, however, when this huge
figure was hauled to its final eleva'
tion.

TUNNELLING AT
GUTHEGA DAM.
Two tunnels are being
constructed at Guthega
Dam by the Norwegian
contractors, the Selmer En-
gineering Co. The dam
is on the Upper Snowy
River at an elevation of
5000 feet above sea level.
In the upper picture a di-
version tunnel 600 ft.
long has been constructed
to take the river flow
around the site of the
dam from a small coffer
dam upstream. In the
lower picture a drilling
team is engaged on the
main supply tunnel yhich
will convey water from
Guthega Dam to the top
of a hillside 800 feet above
the power station at Mun-
yang. Steel penstocks will
connect the tunnel with
the turbines. This con-
tract is due for completion
in 1954 and will make
available 60,000 kilowatts.
The discharged water will
again be available for di-
version to the Murray
River system where it will
generate further power at
progressively lower levels.

Landseer’s Toothless Lion,
Before this feat was commenced, a
table was laid on the platform and
scaffolding at the top of the column
and a hearty rump steak dinner was
ceremoniously served to the fourteen
workmen. It was privately thought
wisest to stage the dinner before the
hauling operation in case some of the
workmen were accidentally killed and
thus “would be unable to be pres'
ent.”
At 5.20 a.m. on November 3,
1843. the lower block of the statue
left the ground. On top of the scab
folding a powerful engine slowly
hoisted the travelling platform. Neb
son’s lower half reached the top in
six hours, a rise of six inches a min'
ute. His upper half and separate
left arm went up the next day.
The four lions at the base were
planned as sphinxes to commemorate
the Battle of the Nile, and sculptor
after sculptor refused to undertake
them. When Sir Edward Landseer
1802' 1875). the most celebrated anb
mal painter of his time, finally under-
took to design the lions, difficulties
arose over a model.
For a time, the zoo authorities
permitted the artist to have an old
toothless and sleepy beast in his gard'
en. The result was that critics of
the finished work thought Landseer’s
lions looked too harmless!
(The total cost of the column,
with the figure of Nelson on the top,
was £45,000. Besides the four bronze
lions at the corners of the base there
are four bronze reliefs representing
respectively the battles of the Nile.
St. Vincent, Copenhagen, and Tra-
fafgar.)
Troubles Develop.
With the installation of the lions,
the story of Trafalgar Square was far
from complete. The basins of the
fountains leaked, sending a miniature
river down Whitehall and troubles
developed with the water supply. For
many years, too, people feared to go
near the column lest Nelson should
topple down.
During the war, when bombs fell
nearby, panic among officials was re-
newed. Through binoculars it was
seen that Nelson had developed a
white belt round his middle and it
was feared that the granite might be
moving sideways. Steeplejacks found
the mortar was deteriorating between
the blocks and the base of the statue
was pitted with holes which had to be
filled with cement.
In addition. Nelson has already had
a fracture in his right arm put in
splints. From 1905 to 1919, accord'
mg to existing records, the statue re-
ceived no attention at all. When a
famous London steeplejack, Mr. W.
Larkins paid a visit after this lapse
of years, he found nearly a ton mound
of dead birds, skeletons, nesting ma-
terial and other rubbish.
Steeplejack’s Nightmare.
The top of the column was. up to
a decade ago regarded as a steeple'
jack’s nightmare. First, the overhang
of the plinth has to be negotiated.
Like a fly, the steeplejack crawls over
the projection, clinging to the stone'
work. Then comes a greasy platform
In 1919, old Larkins slipped on
the inch'thick layer of greasy soot
and nearly fell. He was on his back
with his legs over the edge—and man'
aged to use his elbows as a brake just
in time to save himself.
Sixteen ladders and 360 ft. of guid'
ing ropes were standard equipment in
scaling the 145 ft. granite column.
His last bath was given in 1946. It’s
little wonder that Nelson is so seldom
shampooed, but surely they would not
use this antedeluvian equipment when
Mills scaffolding, which emanated
from England long before this time,
could have been had for the hiring.
It is easy to handle, strong, affords
movable platforms at all stages, irre'
spective of height and provides safety
for all workmen. It is as foolproof
as scaffolding can be. The task of
washing the statue takes a fortnight.
The base of the column is washed
every three months and swept weekly.
Yet the column itself hasn’t been
cleaned for over 100 years.
Monuments of national heroes are
still being added to Trafalgar Square.
The latest were five years ago when
the busts of fellicoe and Beatty were
erected and unveiled.
With its new Lutyens fountains,
shrubs and flowerbeds, Trafalgar
Square will again be a focal point for
Londoners on Coronation Day, as it
has been for every important event
of history for over the last 100 years.
SHARP PRACTICE.
Lighthouse-keepers at Gabo Island
were recently mystified by the deter'
ioration of two bricks near the base
of the lOOyear'old lighthouse.
The bricks appeared to be the vie'
tims of “brick-eating” white ants or
similar termites.
Scientific aid was called in, without
success.
However, as the result of long, risky
and furtive observation by the chief
keeper at Gabo, the mystery has
been solved.
The two bricks are softer than the
rest, and the penguins, which swarm
about the island, sharpen their beaks
on them.
WHAT IS IT?
It was once fairly easy to assess the purpose
of a building by its appearance. A factory
looked like a factory, an opera house like
an opera house, and a church like a church.
Today under the levelling influence of func-
tionalism this individual character and as well
as national characteristics have been engulfed
in the “international modern style.” For
instance, what are the four buildings? Can
you guess? No. 1 is a recent office building
in Houston, Texas; Nos. 2 and 3 are dif-
ferent views of the Royal Festival Hall, Lon-
don, while No. 4 is a new factory at Dux-
ford, England, for Aero Research Ltd. If
the order had been reversed would you
have known?

U.K. Professor
Expounds Housing
Theory
“Change Homes Five Times,”
He Says.
If everyone in the future is to get
a fair share of Britain’s homes, the
average man might have to change his
home at least five times in an average
lifetime, according to Professor Sir
William Holford, town planning pro-
fessor of London University College.
In a recent lecture to a London
audience he said that:
• Mr. Average would be born in a
Flat;
• His parents then would move
with him into a House;
• He would marry and take his
wife to a Flat;
• They would have children, and
move to a House;
• The children would grow up,
and he and his wife would move to a
Flat again.
Professor Holford explained that
houses would be reserved for fam-
ilies with children.
As the children grew up to marry-
ing age parents would move out of
their houses into ground-floor flats.
Younger married couples who were
childless would live in upstairs flats
of their own. Single people would
live in buildings catering for large
numbers, and people who found them-
selves alone would go into homes
shared with other people.
“His Castle.”
“Young and old people prefer to
have company,” the Professor said.
“They would free the self-contained
homes for married couples and fam-
ilies.”
But he added “Whatever happens
to an Englishman, he will always make
the home he lives in his castle.”
RAIL LINK IF SUEZ GOES.
The Belgian Congo is making rap-
id progress on a strategic railway line,
which could be of the greatest import'
ance if the situation in Egypt should
result in the loss of the Suez Canal
base to the west.
The project, which resulted in the
construction after World War 11. of
the vast Mackinnon road base in Ken-
ya, was partly dismantled when the
British decided to remain in the canal
zone.
Construction now involves a link
between Kamina and Kabolo —both in
the heart of the continent.

NEW AMERICAN
BUILDINGS
Witty Signs Gets
Business
As business becomes keener, shop'
keepers’ signs are becoming wittier.
And it has started a new craze in
the U.K.- the collection of witty signs
to attract business.
Here are a few samples:
On a builder's office—
“l Send Innocent Men To The
Scaffold.”
A painter and paperhanger says—
“ They Deserve Hanging—Every
One of Our High'Class Wallpapers.”
An optician advises passers'by—
“lf you want to be optimistic,
don’t have misty optics.”
A London tobacconist advertised in
his window that all customers would
receive “a free coat'hanger and cig'
arettedight.” He gave them each a
nail and a match!
In a vacuum'deaner dealer’s win'
dow—
“Don’t Kill Your Wife. Let Us
Do The Dirty Work.”
While a laundry firm contributed
this gem—•
“Why Faint at The Washtub?
We have a Specially Trained Staff
Willing to do it for you.”
A linen draper advertised the sale
of sheets with this unconscious hu'
mour: “These cannot last long at
this price.”
And a tailor’s witty effort: “Trous-
ers pressed 6d. per leg. Seats free!”
A leading North country store an'
nounced in large letters: “A Man in
Our Clothes Gets On,” but a rival
went one better with; “A Girl in Our
Hats Gets Off.”
A furrier’s sign reads: “Ladies’
Skins Cleaned and Relined”.
A motor garage declares: “If we
can’t make it go it must be a snail,”
and a dry cleaner’s shop announces
to all and sundry: “We would gladly
dye for you.”
Restrictions on
Prefab. Imports
Precautions Against Sirex Wasp.
Restrictions on importing prefabri'
cated houses as a precaution against
the spread of the sirex wasp was re-
commended in a special report tabled
in the Federal Parliament recently.
Real Danger.
The report urged that, because of
the real danger to Australian timber.
no timber carrying bark should be ah
lowed into Australia.
The Minister for Health, Sir Earle
Page, who tabled the report, said later
that the Commonwealth endorsed in
principle the recommendation that
quarantine precautions taken against
the entry of Siricid wood wasps, be
intensified.
The report was prepared by a com'
mittee of three experts appointed in
November. 1951.
Mass Production
of £1000 House
Victorian Project to Start.
The Victorian Housing Commission
recently asked the Winwood Housing
Organisation, Moorabbin, to build
them a house for under £lOOO. The
finished job (see illustration) cost
£995.
Rental of the house will be 38/'
per week, and the Commission hopes
to mass produce it to reduce rents
to a minimum.
The house, designed by the Com'
mission, with Mr. Bent Overend as
supervising architect, is a rectangular
“Army style” building. Amenities
are a sink, bath, and electrical fittings.
Full scale production of the house
can be achieved within a month.
Lessees will have to paint their own
homes inside and out, because paint
has been left off as part of the econ-
omy campaign.
Extra rooms and verandahs can be
fitted. Present Commission prefabs,
rent for 65/' a week and cost £1675
to construct. The £995 house is much
smaller and bathroom and laundry
are combined. So are the kitchen and
living room.
Commission authorities believe the
house is the absolute cheapest that
can be made. They are not for sale,
but for rent.
The houses will be sawn through
the centre for transport in two halves
to the necessary allotments.
The new office building recently completed
at Seattle and known as Grosvcnor House,
achieves contrast by the metal spandrels to
the corner windows against the solid and
lighter coloured masonry. Below is the new
medical building attached to Hartford Hospi-
tal, in which the fenestration takes the form
of a series of square openings.

VICTORIAN 38/- A WEEK HOUSE.
Built for £995, this prototype Housing Com-
mission home will rent for 38/-. It is hoped
to mass produce it to reduce rents to a mini-
mum. The interior is divided into five rooms
with partitions. Lessees will have to paint
their houses inside and out to keep the
rents through initial investments down.

BOOK REVIEW.
(1) “Walls and Wall Facings,” by
Denril Nield. 276 pp. Index
Illustrations. E. 6s? F. N. Spon
Ltd., 22 Henrietta St., London.
English price, 18/-.
The author in his Preface quotes
good sense written over a hundred
and thirty years ago in 1820 in
Treadgold’s “Elementary Principles of
Carpentry: “But Science remains a
dead letter unless it be applied ’to the
business and affairs of men’; on the
contrary, when it is applied to ‘the
useful arts, it extends the view of the
artist; substitutes certainty for uncer-
tainty; security for insecurity; it in-
forms him how to raise the greatest
work with confidence, and how to
produce stability with economy, or, in
its own language, how to obtain a
maximum of strength with a minimum
of materials.”
Pursuing this theme, the author
says that much has been done to in-
vestigate the principles of building,
and much research has been carried
far into particular aspects of construc-
tion, but the relation between this
valuable work and our everyday build-
ing has been very small. New tech-
niques usually have to develop from
traditional methods, so that a purely
scientific consideration of the problem
often gives no immediate practical
solution.
“Applied to simple domestic con-
struction,” he continues, “much of
what is in this book may seem an ex-
panded and windy way of pointing out
the obvious and preaching applied
commonsense, but the obvious is what
is known to those who know and
commonsense is that to those who
have reasoned on these lines before.”
Theory and Practice.
The layout and approach is essen-
tially appealing and is divided into
Theory and Practice, each being sub-
divided into detail sections covering
various aspects of building construc-
tion. Thus, under “Theory” comes
Functional Requirements Analysed;
Strength and Stability; Exclusion of
Rain (a vital section!); Durability;
Heat Insulation; Appearance; Fire Re-
sistance; Sound Insulation; Movement
Due to Changes in Moisture Content
and Temperature.
Under “Practice,” the various types
of construction are covered as follows;
Brickwork details; Solid Built Load-
bearing Walls; Cavity Brick Load-bear-
ing Walls; Load-bearing Walls other
than Brick; Panel Walls: Panel Wall
In’fillings; Panel Walls—Heat insulat-
ing Layers; External Facings; Partition
Walls.
A research item of interest to many
readers will be the definition of
“Grog” a burned'day material
made by crushing and grinding broken
clay products, which makes a useful
aggregate in insulating concrete in'
tended for use in temperatures up to
2200 degrees F. Surely just another
example of the vagaries of the English
language!
(2) “Costs and Prices,” by S. R.
Brown, LL.B., F.C.A. (Aust.).
272 pp. Index. The Law
Book Company of Australasia
Pty. Ltd. Price, 30/'.
“It has been said,” says the author
in his Preface, “that one man’s price
is another man’s cost. Like some
other aphorisms, however, this one
does not really mean very much, even
supposing we validate it by connecting
the persons contractually.
“If one man agrees to work for
another at twenty pounds for a forty'
hour week, is that figure really the
price the former requires and it is
really the cost to the latter? In any
exchange of goods and services where-
in money is the basis of the exchange,
what do the resultant costs and prices
which are thrown out really mean?
Of themselves, as mere figures, they
mean nothing. It is questionable
whether anything outside the field of
personal emotions can ever be mean-
ingful unless related to something
else. A firm in business to make a
profit must relate its costs to its in-
come (which latter depends in turn
upon the relationship between price
and volume) in order to invest the
concepts of cost, price, income and
profit with meaning.
“Mere relation is not enough, how-
ever. It is essential that the be-
haviour of these things be studied.
This, then, has been my task in the
preparation of this book—to present
an analysis of the relation between
costs and prices and their behaviour
in relation to volume. These are the
factors of profit.”
In recent years two points have re-
ceived heavy emphasis in cost account-
ing literature: (1) That cost account-
ing is an activity which must function
in such a way that it produces infor-
mation which will enable costs to be
controlled and the efficiency of the
activities of a business enterprise to
be measured; and so dominant is this
function that the furnishing of cost
data for purposes of price determina-
tion plays but a subsidiary role. (2)
That there are different costs for dif-
ferent purposes.
Chapter I considers the economists’
approach to pricing policy, the relation
of their notion of cost to price and
the criticism which can be levelled.
Chapter 2 reviews actual pricing situa'
tions as they exist in the business
world, and it is found that cost plays
little or no part in price information
in some situations, yet in others it is all
important. Chapter 3 follows with a
consideration of the influence of
volume on cost, price and profit, while
in Chapter 4 differential cost and
revenue analysis materially follows and
the study of this cannot be over-
emphasised.
Economy in operations is considered
in detail in Chapter 5, while Chapter
6 covers two matters intimately con'
nected with cost control, since they
make for efficiency and cost reduction.
These are time and motion study and
incentives. Chapter 7 deals with the
allocation of costs to products and
consider how far product profitability
statements are feasible, and finally two
important methods available for direct'
ing cost control—budgets and their
systematic use—are discussed.
In no place throughout the text is
it assumed that any cost compilation
is, or can be, a substitute for sound
management.
Baseboard Heating
System
In a new housing project near
Chicago, in the suburban community
of Des Plaines Villas, the builders are
installing a new type heating system.
It dispenses with visible radiators
or regulators, and requires only oar-
row vents here and there in the base'
boards around each room, and there
are no basements to hold the heating
system, only a small room compactly
stacked with a miniature boiler, hot
water domestic heater, valves, and
overhead expansion tank.
All this equipment requires only
a 6ft. by 4ft. floor area. Furthermore,
the system is self-operating.
On the recommendations of Uni'
versity of Illinois heating researchers,
the builders adopted baseboard heat'
ing for its houses, over a hundred of
which have been completed out of a
projected 500. The system is said to
be extremely economical, clean and
efficient.
The theory of baseboard heating
is that by heating the entire outer
floor area, warmer floor areas are
maintained, drafts are eliminated, and
temperatures raised more easily. A
constant, even temperature throughout
each room is also stresed.

London Airport Will Be World’s Finest
COVERS FOUR AND A HALF SQUARE MILES.
Heath Row, London Airport, cov'
ers 2874 acres —or some 4\ square
miles, of which 80 acres were entirely
flooded when, on May 15, 1944, the
first man came on the site to start a
job where today 11,000 people are
employed and where 21 different
countries operate between them 23
airlines.
Two rivers flowed 1\ miles across
the south'west corner of the airport,
the Longford River and a sort of
canaLcum'river known as the Duke
of Northumberland’s canal. The
Northumberlands have a house nearby
known as Lyon House, but during
the Napoleonic Wars, a Duke of
Northumberland who owned a gun'
powder mills on the edge of Houns'
low Heath, provided a short cut by
building the canal down to the
Thames, where ships were waiting to
load his powder.
Many Obstacles.
To clear the south-west corner of
the site, it was decided that the two
rivers should be diverted into a com-
mon bed. But the Ministry of Works
said: “No, this is an Ancient Mon-
ument!”
After prolonged argument and dis'
cussions—at a cost of several hum
dreds of thousands of pounds—it was
agreed that the rivers could and should
be diverted, but each in its own bed.
The airport authorities then dis'
covered in the course of building that
a small village called Stenmore would
have to be practically isolated, so they
borrowed a Bailey Bridge and used it
for two and a half years.
Then the Middlesex County Coun-
cil produced maps and blueprints
showing that the Duke of Northum'
berland Canal marked a Parliament'
ary boundary, so that if the river
were diverted, it would change the
voting powers of the inhabitants of
the neighbourhood.
Solution.
Some unnamed genius found the
solution by placing brass tablets
down the exact centre of the east'west
runway, to indicate the exact demar'
cation line of a jealously guarded Brit'
ish Parliamentary boundary.
Specimens.
While digging was proceeding be-
tween the airport and the Thames,
a distance of about 2L miles, the ver-
tebra of a dinosaur was found. It
measured 6ft. wide and 2ft. thick.
At the eastern end of the runway
there was something that looked like
a pyre. It turned out to be a 14th
Century Celtic temple. There was
also finds of ancient pottery and the
remains of an ancient stockade.
On the taxi'track, where planes
move out to the runways, a brass pin
embedded in the grotund marks the
spot where a brass cannon was found
upside down, buried deep in the
earth.
The cannon was presented to the
War Office, the dinosaur's backbone
went to the Natural History Museum.
Spectators.
On a fine Saturday or Sunday about
6000 people visit Heath Row, paying
6d. a head to go into the Public
Enclosure. Threepence admits a child,
who when not watching the 'planes
flying in and out, plays in the sand-
pits or rides on the roundabouts.
Finest.
Wonderful as London Airport ah
ready is, it is nothing to what is ah
ready planned, something super that
will make it the finest airport in the
whole world. The London Airport
to be, will consist of a mass of central
buildings in the middle of the air'

London Airport, together

over 1½ million passengers
in 1951 and this traffic is
expected to be doubled by
1960. Consequently plans
have been prepared for de-
veloping Gatwick Aero-
drome into an alternate
airport. The two main
east-west runways, the
northern one, shown black,
being due for completion
in 1956, will be 7,000 ft.
long and 200 ft. wide. Be-
tween them, at the eastern
end, and close to the
railway, will be the new
terminal buildings. The
maintenance area will be
in the south-eastern corner
of the airport. A N.E.-
S.W. runway, crossing the
other two is also suggest-
ed. Its length would be
5000 ft. and breadth 150 ft.
The London - Brighton
Road, which crosses the
middle of the airport, will
require diversion.

MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
Mr. JOHN DANIEIL.
Tall John Daniell, Manager of
Indent Tile Pty. Ltd., was born
at Greenwich, Sydney. At Shore,
before finishing his school career,
John's name was well known as
a distance runner.
Mr. Daniell spent some years
in Brisbane with both Noyes
Bros, and Warburton Frank! Ltd.,
and on his return to Sydney in
1937, joined the Indent Organis-
ation.
Mr. Daniell thinks the modern
trend in tile use Is for "comple-
mentation," rather than orna-
mentation.
"Inside furnishing is not as
gaudy as it used to be," he says,
and he considers modern require-
ments are becoming less ornate
and in fact almost sedate even
though colourful, but adds that
such tiling as "Animal Picture"
tiling, for the children's nursery,
is by contrast, becoming popular
in new homes.
Among other activities Mr. Daniell is President of the N.S.W. Wall and Floor
Tile Association, a body which, although not much publicised is extremely active.

The end of cement shortages, fore'
seen when building restrictions were
removed in February, and since, has
not yet arrived, although it is still in
sight. The demand has increased side
I by side with supplies, which are near
the peak of the total manufacturing
I capacity of the two companies.
The S.A. Portland Cement Company
has topped the capacity of its new
works at Angaston by the equivalent
of 10,000 tons a year. The designed
capacity of the works was 80,000 tons
[ a year, and the current rate is 90,000.
The Adelaide Cement Company’s Bir'
kenhead works is producing at about
i 85 per cent, of its designed capacity
l of 150,000 tons a year. As the total
State production last year was just
over 100,000 tons, the extent of the
increased demand is obvious.
Except for a few minor emergencies,
big jobs are not suffering from the
shortage. There is a heavy country
demand, as farmers undertake works
postponed for several years, prompted
by income tax concessions which em
able the cost of a new house or farm
building to be written off in five years.
The small “man in the street,” who
wants cement for long'planned home
jobs, is feeling the pinch most. Sup'
pliers are still working to a quota
system, and some are not accepting
orders. One big distributor estimates
that orders, mainly for the country,
are about 4000 tons in arrears. It is
likely to be two or three months yet
before orders are caught up.
Country contractors, with local
labour and no accommodation prob'
lem for their employees, are securing
some big contracts in country towns,
under conditions where competitive
tendering is still keen. Traeger &
Co., of Tanunda, last month received
the contract for the £50,000 Tanunda
War Memorial Hospital. This 15'bed
hospital, with provision for extension
to 30 beds, is to be built of cream
bricks on a site east of the town,
overlooking the southern part of the
fertile Barossa Valley. Built as a dis'
trict war memorial, it will be one of
the most modern hospitals in the
State. Work has just begun, and com'
pletion is expected in about fifteen
months. The architect is Gordon
Brown.
Another contract let to a country
firm during the month was for extern
sions and alterations to Wood, Son,
Seary’s packing sheds at Renmark.
E. A. Hage, of Renmark, was the sue-
cessful tenderer at £20,000.
Adelaide contractors have secured
contracts for two large Government
jobs in the country.
Clarke and Raymond, at £97,000,
were the successful tenderers for t‘he
new primary school, comprising twelve
classrooms and conveniences, at Reidy
Park, Mt. Gambier. S. J. Weir, with
a tender of £48,750, took the contract
for an infant school of six classrooms
at Renmark.
Housing Trust plans for the coum
try include a new suburb at Port
Augusta, comprising about 400 homes.
It will be known as Wilsdon, and
Housing Trust plans submitted to the
Town Council include areas to be set
aside for schools, churches, shops and
gardens. The trust has also submitted
to the Port Lincoln Council a plan
for the subdivision of land for an oval
near trust homes on the eastern side
of the railway.
Hospital and institutional work is
continuing, as it did under building
restrictions, to play an important
part in contracting. Marshall and
Brougham, Norwood contractors, be'
gan work some weeks ago on the
£40,000 job of remodelling the theatre
at the Memorial Hospital, North
Adelaide. When finished, it will be
one of the most modern and well'
equipped in the State. The work is
being carried out to a tight schedule,
and is expected to be finished within
the contract time of seven months.
Extensions to two old people’s
homes have just been undertaken.
H. K. Egarr, of Kurralta Park, has the
contract for a £14,000 extension to
Resthaven, at Leabrook, to accom'
modate 20 beds, and an £ll,OOO con'
tract for an 18'bed wing and staff
quarters at the Central Mission Old
Folks’ home has been let to S. J.
Weir. Tenders have been called,
closing at the end of April, for a new
hospital at Keith, and for a 15'bed
extension, new maternity wing and
nurses’ block at the Millicent Hos'
pital. The expected cost of the Mil'
licent job is about £40,000.
Plans are being drawn up by
Gordon Brown for a new wing and
assembly building at the Magill
Methodist Children’s homes, at an ex'
pected cost of £15,000, and tenders
are expected to be called this month.
Building of large, well' equipped
private homes has quickly followed re'
moval of restrictions on area and cost.
One recently completed by H. G.
Egarr at Waikerie, on the Murray
River, at a cost of £15,000, includes
air'conditioning among its modern re'
finements. Many others costing be'
tween £B,OOO and £lO,OOO are under
construction a type of home which
has not been built since before the
war.

Commercial building is also getting
under way. Tenders have just closed
for the first new branch building for
the Savings Bank of S.A. to be Built
since the war. This is a single-storey
building in the suburb of Colonel
Light Gardens.
Another Savings Bank building is
still at the design stage. It is intend-
ed for a site on the corner of Hindley
and Bank Streets, bought by the bank
from Fling & Sons last month for
£50,000. Caradoc Ashton & Fisher
are designing the building, which, be-
cause of its unusual shape, presents
wind-bracing problems quite out of
the ordinary. With a frontage of just
over 20ft. to Hindley Street, and ex-
tending 212 ft. down Bank Street, it
will rise to the full height of 130 ft.
oermitted by building regulations, con-
stituting one of the narrowest build-
ings in the city. The final impression
will be something resembling a book
standing on edge. The building will
establish the new building alignment
of Bank Street, allowing for its widen-
ing.
Another big job for which the same
firm of architects will be responsible is
the complete new country abattoirs to
be built at Port Pirie for the local
Abattoirs Board. Calling of tenders
for the job, which is expected to total
£150,000, is awaiting finance arrange-
ments, including approval of Port
Pirie ratepayers.
A city job of unusual interest is
the new Royal Automobile Association
road service headquarters and adminis-
tration building begun last month at
.North Adelaide. Architects for this
£25,000 job are Caradoc Ashton &
Fisher, the contractors are Fricker
Brothers. The building will be of
cement bricks, with steel roof con-
struction and concrete floors. It will
be 16,000 sq. ft. in area, single storey,
and include office block, garage space,
tool and parts stores, vehicle-washing
facilities, spray booths and a fully-
equipped maintenance workshop for
the patrol's 17 vanel vans, 37 motor
cycle outfits, three utilities and four
staff cars.
A special control room will be built
and fitted out for two-way radio com-
mnication with patrols, which it is
hoped to introduce with the occupa-
tion of the new building. Completion
is planned to coincide with the asso-
ciation’s 50th anniversary on Septem-
ber 30.
F. Fricker Ltd., who are toward the
half-way mark on the new Western
Districts Hospital, and have begun
work on a new factory at Kilkenny
for A. M. Bickford & Sons and the
£40,000 St. Michael’s school at Bever-
ley, have just secured another big
contract. It is for a new office and
glass store on the Port Road for
Pilkington Brothers, at a cost of about
£75,000. The building will be of
brick, single storey, with concrete
floor, asbestos cement roof, with steel
stanchions and principals. Total area
is over 150,000 sq. ft.

Local building and engineering in'
dustries, and others all over Australia,
are benefiting from the construction
of the world’s largest single sulphuric
, acid plant at Port Adelaide. Principal
contractors for the £2,000,000 plant
| are Simon Carves (Australia) Pty.
Ltd. Civil engineering work, already
| let to a local contractor, will continue
for about a year.
Sub'contracts for work totalling
more than £500,000 have already been
| let throughout Australia, including
steel fabricating contracts for more
j than £250,000 to South Australian
\ engineering firms.
Specialised machinery for the plant
will begin to arrive from Simon'
Carves’ parent company in England
within the next six months. The rest
of the plant will be made or bought
in Australia.
The contractors expect the plant to
be finished to schedule at the end of
next year. It will use pyri.es from
I Nairne to produce sulphuric acid to
overcome the shortage in superphos'
phate manufacture in S.A. Three
roasters, 30ft. in diameter and 60ft.
jhieh, will produce the sulphur dioxide
gas from the pyrites, with a boxdift to
reach the cop platform.
Pyrites from Nairne will be fine
enough to pass a 60'mesh sieve when
lit arrives, but it aggregates in the
stack, and must be dried and disim
tegrated before being fed into the
roasters. The plant for this part of
the process will come from the U.K.
Gases from the roasters will be cooled
in heat exchangers, firing water'tube
boilers which generate steam for a
2,000 kW. turbo'generator. Two
blowers, driven by 600'h.p. motors,
will drive the gases through cyclone
dust collectors, electrostatic dust and
mist precipitators and finally through
leaddined towers in which the gases
will be washed by weak sulphuric
acid and then dried. Vanadium cata-
lyst oxidation oxidises the sulphur
dioxide to the trioxide in the oxida-
tion plant.
The S0 8 will be finally absorbed by
circulation through strong acid sprays,
the resultant 94 per cent, sulphuric
acid being drawn off through coolers,
and thence to storage tanks for de-
livery by road or rail tank cars.

ADDRESS TO STUDENTS
By HOWARD ROBERTSON, M.C, A.A.A., S.A.D.G.,
President of The Royal Institute of British Architects,
Delivered on February 3, 1953.
I think it is not unfitting that my
first address to students should be
prefaced by some remarks about the
relationship between students and our
Institute.
The word “student” only connotes
a stage in an architect’s career. The
student becomes an architect: the
genuine architect remains a student all
his life. There is a line to be crossed
at examination time; but there is no
separation of interests between any of
us. What the Institute tries to do in
order to benefit its fully qualified
members is automatically of benefit to
students who are goin" to qualify.
What it does for students is going to
be valuable to all architects in prac-
tice. We are all the same race of
people, merely arriving at different
ages and stages. The work of the
Practice Committee, the Salaried and
Official Architects’ Committee, the
Public Relations Committee, to men-
tioh but three, is directed to ends
which in the broad sense are of bene-
fit to students, as aiming to improve
the status and prospects of the pro-
fession and of the practice into which
they are about to enter.
The Board of Architectural Educa'
tion and its various committees pro'
vide the outstanding example of con'
tinuous and mainly voluntary service
in the Institute devoted essentially to
educational matters. The Visiting
Board, the Juries, the special commit-
tee which -sits to review the whole
position of education, occupy the time
of many busy people whose time is
often precious. The extent to which
public - spirited architects give their
working hours gladly and freely to
Institute purposes is probably not
fully realised, and the proportion of
that particular contribution of volun-
tary service which is devoted to the
educational side requires to be under-
lined. I mentioned these facts because
many students in days to come will,
no doubt, be making their personal
contribution in the same way. And
they must not be disappointed if in-
stead of bouq_uets they are the re-
cipients of criticism which sometimes
comes in its fullest force from those
who have made the least personal
effort to help their Institute. Archi-
tects will ultimately, of course, get the
Institute they deserve. I think we
can to-day be reasonably proud of
ours ;and membership of it is a hall'
mark. It will be due to the apathy
of the many, rather than the fault of
the few, if we fail to maintain our
standards.
SUN CONTROL.
The recent craze for walls of glass has brought
in its trail—very naturally—all sorts of de-
vices to keep the sun out. This new Infants’
School at Putney, London, uses the time-
honoured eaves awning with good affect. The
contraption on the end might be a water
tower, chimney or bell tower. It’s any-
body’s guess. It has come to something when
architecture has to rely on a bit of “Floren-
tine” canvas to produce the only “good
effect.”

Findinq Where One’s Talents
Are.
It is difficult to know at the outset
I of the training where one’s talents and
I abilities may lie. They are apt to de'
I velop or be found wanting only slow'
I ly, as one matures. Perhaps the best
I attitude at first is that of the KomTiki
I navigators— to go along with the cur'
I rent and not force oneself into plan'
I ning a course too rigidly in advance.
For instance, some architects are poor
assistants but prove to be excellent
[ directors of their own practices, be'
cause they have, let us say, a flair for
i, making contacts or for organising and
| delegating. Others have the sense of
organising but cannot manage to pick
lup work. Others still are marvellous
within an organisation but feel that
they will not stand too well alone. It
I is a matter of personal endowment of
temperament, environment, of relation'
I ships, and of alertness or good luck
in following the turn of fortune’s
I wheel.
But whatever the future may bring,
I there are certain conditions to be ob'
served, not as guarantees of success,
but as contributing thereto.
Apart from an enthusiasm for archi'
tecture, which I hopefully assume in
every student present, there is the
matter of technical equipment, and
this is a complicated subject bound up
{ with educational methods. I cannot
j speak of these this evening, but only
I of the end in view.
The first and hardest thing to re-
member is that in this professional
world, however deserving one may
feel oneself to be, nothing is owed to
any of us. Nothing is ours by right.
Therefore, from the outset, one has to
market something; in this case, first
one s talents, and finally one’s services.
If everyone is going to earn a salary,
and eventually fees, it is necessary to
provide a service in exchange. And
[ even a student entering an office for
the first time is expected to bring with
him a certain basic technical and
, manual skill, and be able to deal with
simple problems. To draw firmly, title
legibly, dimension clearly, so that
sharp prints can be taken, is a great
asset in an office. To be able to pro'
duce a simple, agreeable and realistic
perspective sketch that a client will
understand is a further accomplish'
ment which is valuable but rare. Un'
fortunately, drawings in the manner
of Osbert Lancaster, Le Corbusier,
Mies van der Rohe, or even Gordon
Cullen, are of little avail except when
done by these masters themselves.
Please aim at something more prosaic
to begin with. The architect’s office
has to communicate with clients or
committees often lacking in artistic
awareness, and must use simple chan'
nels. And a perspective realistic.
crisp and well composed - is one of
them.
A second desideratum is a ground'
ing in simple construction. Damp'
courses, flashings, windows, door de'
tails, gullies and gutters unfortunately
still exist as building features. Know-
ledge of these need not preclude a
nice taste in space frames; but basic
knowledge of the simple essentials is
indispensable.
Architects’ Work 90% Factual.
And here I must confess, and warn
all concerned, that architects’ work to'
day is about 90 per cent, factual and
only 10 per cent, dreaming and de-
signing. Designs happily seem at
times to take shape quite suddenly in
one’s mind, and can then be sketched
out quite quickly. But the routine of
administering contracts, or correspon'
dence. of dealing with troubles, and,
last but not least, of attending to end'
less factual working drawings and tire'
some schedules, quite honestly occupies
most of the office time. Once the
sketch scheme is accepted, building
projects become problems of contracts,
prices, foundations, structure and ser'
vices, services, services. And all archi'
tects’ offices are full of youthful and
elderly men hoping, hoping, that

someone else will attend to just those
things. The elderly men in question
are often the partners, people like my-
self, who know that the chores are in-
escapable. The youthful ones are, of
course, sanguine people like your-
selves.
Personally, I would like to sec con-
sideration given in school courses to
the possibility of a rather more factual
study of the business side of architec-
tural practice: awareness of it is be-
coming quite vital. Something might
have to be crowded out to achieve it.
Thoughts on what could be sacrificed
are, however, out of place to-night.
Importance of Costs.
But I must allude to a criticism
often levelled against architects that
they nay insufficient attention to costs.
Actually, very few to-day are guilty of
that. A very hard economy holds the
architect’s sensitive nose right down
amongst the obnoxious prices, with
the quantity surveyor at hand with his
smelling salts. Our trouble has been
to produce anything architecturally
satisfactory while prices rise against us;
and the balance is struck by whittling
down either size, quality or structure,
or materials and finish. You cannot
have both when people are trying to
beat an impossible budget.
No one expects students to be cost-
minded by nature, but it is salutary for
schools to teach how to cube, and to
call attention to price ranges per foot
of current types of building; also to
point out that a description on a draw-
ing reading “partitions to be made ol
some plastic material” may possibly
contain the germ of a hideous dis-
appointment when prices are con-
sidered. It is interesting for the
student himself to know a little about
costs, and to observe and note what is
actually being achieved in current
building. The best way, of course, is
to pay the bill for some minor con-
struction of one’s own or, better still,
the family’s.
I now come to the more interesting
side, the one that probably appeals
most to all of us: namely, architectural
design.
I suppose one of the trustiest plati-
tudes for the lecturer on design is the
one about bavin? to put something
into oneself before expecting to bring
much out. The question arises, what
should one try to absorb in order later
to be onself productive?
Copyism and Individuality.
The temptation in my day, and it is
still there, was to form one’s design
vocabulary on the recent work of
other architects: to be briskly alert for
the latest mannerisms and stylish turns
of architectural expression; to pick up
all the tricks, unfortunately without
realising that these are probably the
mannerisms of architects whose deeper
contribution is based on a study and
development of fundamentals which
they have laboriously explored and
developed.
Living men who have looked below
the surface and are thoroughly familiar
with tradition, although they may not
use its vocabulary, include famous and
familiar figures such as Auguste Ferret,
Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius,
the late Gunnar Asplund, Le Cor-
busier, Mies van der Rohe, Richard
Neutra, and many more. Some of
them have imitators who may fondly
hope to start where these men leave
off. But they may forget that these
leaders developed their own personal
expression the hard way,, by endless
studv and experiment, in some cases
accompanied by frustration and dis-
appointment. Their work may be in
one sense laboratory research, in that
it does not always produce satisfactory
or conclusive results for general appli-
cation. But it brings to the surface
very stimulating suggestions and some-
times idioms of great expressiveness
and character which are eagerly seized
upon and too rapidly become tricks of
the trade.
Groups and cliques of disciples
form, often with a healthy intolerance
of each other. Groups are not to be
despised. They have always existed in
the past, and render great service as
spearheads for progress. The danger

arises when they have served their pur*
pose but continue on as power groups
for pressurising opinion or for the
advancement of individuals.
In the immediate past an attempt
was made to establish something in
the nature of an international “style.”
It is a pity the word “style” was used,
for “trend” might have expressed a
more defensible intention. It is diffi'
cult to endorse the idea of a truly in'
ternational “style,” since climate, ways
of life, natural environment, and other
factors differ in most countries, just as
the people of those countries tend to
differ. Surely the way for a designer
is not to be too selLconscious, but to
develop his own personality, and fob
low his own inner convictions which
will be formed according to his own
environment, his way of life, his study,
his experience. The student does right
to study and follow such movements
to analyse their root causes: but he
should retain h,s own independence
and judgment.
“Advance Guard” Movements
Advance Uuard Movements.
This brings me to the reflection that
Z St °l U 6 T deS,gn h ith rh an

nals as quite legitimately follow their
own policy of stressing more part.cu-

critics do undoubtedly help to foster
this fear. An American journal will
write a caption that such and such a
design is “Perret'Beaux Arts.” This
is, of course, at first glance a terrible
condemnation, and the architect cub
prit is expected to shrivel up amid the
jubilant execration of avant' garde
readers. Another article will come to
the unhesitating conclusion that the
albglass house by so'and'so is now
quite demoded, and in fact represents
the end of an epoch. The real thing
is, of course the more recent albglass
house by such'and'such, which vibrates
with the tension of the new age. And
so it goes on. It would not matter if
this sort of writing did not lead archi'
tects away from what is terribly iim
portant namely, designing primarily
to do what they are paid for, namely,
to serve their clients by giving them
the pleasant usable, durable practical,

have the right to expect for even a
meagre capital investment.
WC arch . itects could easi, V de-
sign ourselves out of a commission,
just as the builder could price himself
out of a job. It is salutary that we
should realise this. We should not
spend too much time on designing for
a Mediterranean climate, or on pro-
vidmg such things as albglass fronts
and interlocking space just for the fun
of it in cases where practical demands
undeniably suggest more solid walling
and considerable privacy. Our archi'
tectural treatments should, in fact, be
soundly and factually based,

This is not to say that we should
sink back into a slothful imitation of
the past. Some people may be dis'
couraged by the difficulty of producing

by the so-called “machine age,” is the
change in the appearance of machines.
In the early days there was a reflection
in the design field of the sort of
machinery that the Wright Brothers
contrived for their biplane. Our chairs
and tables and Mondrian’s painting all
felt it, and it still persists. But now,
so gradual as to be scarcely noticed
by most people, we see the merging
of the rigid mechanical form with the
biological. The new Handley - Page
H.P. 80 looks more like a great bird
or fish. Our locomotives and racing
cars are developing an almost rep-
tilian form. The painters and sculp-
tors, as always, have sensed this.
Look, just to take two examples, at
Graham Sutherland, and some recent
work of Reg Butler.
Developments are nowadays so rapid
that it must be very hard for assessors
to judge a competition with an open
mind, especially one for students. I
suppose we must recognise that to win
an award in a competition it has
always been necessary either to have
a good deal of knack, or better still
to exhibit some quality that first in-
trigues and then captivates the jury.
Competitions.
Competitions may be heart-breaking;
but they are a superb training-ground
for us all. They reveal where one
stands oneself, not to forget, of
course, the human failings of all asses-
sors except the one who makes that
rare personal award. To-day it cannot
truly be told that assessors are stylis-
tically prejudiced. They do try to
recognise what is appropriate and what
is good of its kind. Any student who
is disappointed with the results should
not, be at all discouraged. The careers
of all artists have been sprinkled with
disappointment, and recognition often
comes very late indeed. But when we
embrace an artistic career we must be
prepared to accept its vicissitudes.
We are assured of being in excellent
company.

“Stacreep” Crane Control.
The accuracy, robustness and sim-
plicity of “Stacreep” crane and hoist
control, developed by B.T.H. to give
stable creeping speeds with A.C. motor
drives for lifts, hoists, conveyors, etc.,
is demonstrated as a working exhibit
on a complete Joseph Booth 6? Bros,
crane crab. The crab is mounted on
crane rails some 14ft. above the
ground to simulate an actual installa-
tion, and is operated by pendant push-
button control.
Electronic Equipment.
This demonstration shows the appli-
cation of a high-speed electronic batch
counter to the cutting of wood veneer
in pre-selected lengths, the veneer
being represented in the exhibit by
paper tape.
A disc with 45 holes around its
periphery is arranged to be driven
from the tape so that a beam of light
on a photo-cell is cut once for every
tenth of an inch movement of the
tape. The signal from the photo-cell
is passed to the batch counter.
The batch counter comprises, essen-
tially, four dekatron counting tubes
arranged to operate in cascade, so that
the first dekatron counts tenths of an
inch, the second inches, the third tens
of inches, and the fourth hundreds of
inches.
Counting proceeds until the glow in
all four dekatrons reaches the pre-
selected cathodes, i.e., until the batch
figure is reached. The tape is then
stopped and cut off, the counter is re-
set, and the next length proceeded
with.
The electronic equipment used in
the above application is one of two
similar high-speed counters now in
production by B.T.H. Whereas the
above equipment is capable of batch-
ing, or operating, at any pre-selected
number between 1 and 9999 at a
maximum speed of 40,000 counts a
minute, the other equipment is pri-
marily a counter registering up to one-
less-than-a-hundred-million at a maxi-
mum speed of 25,000 counts per
minute. Still higher speeds than these
can be obtained if required.

WORLD S LARGEST ALUMINIUM
HANGAR FOR COMET
AIRCRAFT.
Progressive British Structure.
Having a clear span of 200 ft. (217
feet overall) and a length of 3 30ft.,
the world’s largest flight hangar of
aluminium structure is now being
erected at Hatfield (Hertfordshire)
for the De Havilland Aircraft Co.
Ltd.
The hangar, designed for Comet
aircraft, is the third example of wide
span aluminium structures by Struc'
tural 6? Mechanical Engineers Ltd. of
Slough, who were also responsible for
the main arch structure of the Dome of
Discovery with a clear span of 342 ft.,
and the three'bay hangar at London
Airport with three 150 ft. spans.
One-seventh Weight of Steel.
Aluminium alloy was chosen for the
Hatfield project because of economic
advantages. In a span of this width
the structural weight is only about
■one-seventh of that of an equivalent
steel structure. Thus, apart from the
saving in material, the light weight of
the structure permits prefabrication
and transport of very large sub-
assemblies and their erection with a
minimum of labour and equipment.
In this instance the main structure
was erected by eighteen men in thir-
teen weeks, using only two 5-ton
hand-operated cranes and practically
without scaffolding.
A further important saving derives
from the fact that the structure does
not reajuire painting owing to the
high resistance of the aluminium alloy
used to atmospheric attack.
General Description.
The main structure of the flight
hangar consists of twelve aluminium
alloy portal frames at 30ft. centres,
spanning 217 ft. between pinned bases
and giving a clear floor area 200 ft.
wide by 3 30ft. long with a clear height
of 45ft. The roof is of “North Light”
construction with aluminium roof
decking covered with bitumen felt, the
glazing being fixed with aluminium
glazing bars. The east side is sheeted
with corrugated aluminium sheeting
lined with insulation. The wes. side
abuts an annexe building which incor-
porates a control tower at the south-
west corner. The north and south
ends are fitted with doors giving a
clear opening 200 ft. wide by 45ft.
high.
Aluminium alloy HE 10* was chosen
for the structural sections. This alloy
is the one most widely used in struc-
tural work on account of its good
mechanical strength properties, high
resistance to atmospheric attack and
ease of fabrication. The same alloyf
is used for the main gusset plates.
The corrugated sheeting is of alu-
minium alloy NS3J.
Rivets used in shop connections
vary from fin. to fin. diameter and
are in alloys of the NES and NE6
types. All rivets were closed cold, by
squeeze or percussion riveters. Site
connections are made with sheradised
turned and fitted steel bolts, and spun
galvanised black steel bolts.
The loading conditions are in ac-
cordance with those stipulated in BS
449: 1948. In addition to dead loads
from the covering and structure, a
'now load of lOlb./sq. ft. was taken.
To allow for the addition of light
sprinkler systems, etc., an extra load
of 21b./sq. ft .was also taken. The
main portal frames have also been
stressed to withstand 30cwt. point
loads at four positions along the lower
boom to allow for a light runway being
added.
Wind forces are based on a wind
velocity of 65 m.p.h. at an effective
height of 50ft., resulting in a pressure
of 141b./sq. ft.
Structure.
The main struc.ure comprises the
twelve portal frames at 30ft. centres,
spanning 217 ft. between pinned bases
of welded steel, giving a clear span in
200 ft. between the inner legs. The
legs of the portals are Bft. wide and
the horizontal girder portions have a
constant depth of 10ft. throughout
their span, except for a greater depth
at knee positions to counteract the
heavy fixing couples induced. The

booms under the severest loading con'
ditions is 45ft. 4|in.
Primary and secondary members of
these frames consist of double bulb
angles, so designed that there is no
danger of torsional failure at a. lower
load than that at which flexural failure
would normally occur. Previously,
battened channel construction has been
employed for structures of this nature,
but it has been found that the use of
double angles results in a considerable
saving of man'hours during fabrica'
tion. Connections are made with fin.
or fin. thick gusset plates.
Upper and lower booms of the por'
tals are stabilised by saw tooth trusses
spanning between node points at 10ft.
centres. The legs are stabilised on the
east side by using stayed sheeting
rails, the stays springing from the in-
ner legs of the portals. This also re'
duces the section required for the
sheeting rails. Any unbalanced load
is catered for by ties running horizon'
tally between the, inner legs, the end
bays being fully trussed between tie
and rail.
This method of stabilising cannot
be repeated on the west side, as large
openings are required lo give access
to the annexe building. The portal
legs on this side are stabilised by the
addition of a vertical frame running
parallel with the leg, and two other
frames at right-angles to the leg, thus
forming a boxed structure. It is in'
teresting to note that each portal
weighs only 6 tons 7 cwt.
The saw tooth trusses are designed
with a view to ease of fabrication and
each consists of a rafter, a horizontal
tie, a qu.een tie and two internal struts.
The rafter is in the form of a 4in.
channel with an additional flange, the
clear web obviating the necessity for
gusset plates for internal members in
the majority of the trusses, the mem-
bers being riveted directly to the web.
Lateral stability is provided by two
ties at rafter level and one at truss tie
level. The roof decking is bolted
directly to the top flange of the rafter
section.
The hip slopes at the ends of each
bay of trusses are supported by pur-,
lins which span between the hip
trusses and the sloping shoulders of
the portal frames. The hip truss spans
between the second node of one por-
tal and the first node on the adjacent
portal.
Each truss rafter is fitted with a
framed stool, to which it attached one
side of the valley gutter and the lower
glazing rail. The glazing astragals
span between this rail and cleats rivet-
ed to the upper boom of the portal
frames at 2ft. centres.
There are 23 trusses to each bay,
making 25 3 in all. Each truss weighs
1751 b.
Wind girders are introduced in the
end bays of the structure between the
ultimate, penultimate and antepenuh
timate portal.
Canopy frames are fitted to the
north and south ultimate portal frames.
The upper guide channels for the
doors are incorporated in the canopies,
and are supported by wind girder
members at 10ft. centres, produced
beyond the line of ultimate portals.
The underside of each canopy is
sheeted with 16s.w.g. aluminium alloy
sheeting, level with the lower flanges
of the guide channels, thus providing
a flat surface for the rubber draught
excluder along the upper edge of the
sliding and folding doors.
Expansion Joints.
The problem of expansion along
the 3 30ft. length of the hangar has
been solved by introducing expansion
joints at all structural connections on
one side of the sixth portal frame
from the north end. The truss shoes

portal swing in an arc . This has
necessitated using a special cast shoe
on each truss along this bay, in place
of the usual gusset plate. All sheet'
ing rails and ties on the east side have
slotted holes at this postion, the rail
stays being formed in such a manner
as to allow freedom for expansion and
still to function as stabilisers for the
portal leg.
Expansion in the width of the build'
ing is absorbed by strain in the portal
frame members.
The roof is of north'light construe'
tion, with eleven valleys. The day'

corporating twelve continuous runs of
glazing 9ft. 3in, deep using aluminium
alloy glazing bars and £in. wired cast
glass in 24in, panes.
The south slopes are covered with
Briggs aluminium roof decking cover'
ed on the outside with fin. insulation
board, bonded to the deeply corru'
gated decking with hot oxidised bitu'
men, the whole being waterproofed
with two layers of bitumen roofing
felt with mineral finish to the capping
sheet. The hip slopes are also cover'
ed in the same way.
Valley putters spill over these slopes
into 2ft. wide boundary wall gutters
of robust construction which run the
full length of the sides, widening at
each corner to form 10ft. by 12ft.
platforms, and are then continued
along the ends. They are fitted with
aluminium handrails so that they may
be used as walkways. The gutters are
drained by six 4fin. diameter alu'
minium alloy down pipes,
Canopies are provided over the main
doors, the north canopy being glazed
and the south covered with Briggs
decking.
The east wall is sheeted with corru'
gated aluminium alloy sheeting treated
by the Alochrome process. This wall
is lined with 3/16in. thick asbestos'
wood board and Sunfoil reflective in'
sulatiion fixed by extruded aluminium

of the wall is of brick. The west wall

cion, which was undertaken by Carter'
Horseley (Engineers) Ltd.
The lifting of the portal frames was
given careful consideration so as to
obviate any undue lateral distortion,
the vertical legs of two frames being
first erected and braced together
laterally and in the plane of the portal
frame, whilst the roof portion was
lifted into position by slings from four
points about 40ft. apart, each pair of
slings being suspended from lifting
beams. Although the weight of the
roof portion is only about 4.5 tons,
two s'ton hand cranes are used to pro'
vide the 60ft. length of jib required
for the operation. Whilst the vertical
legs were being erected, the roof girder
was assembled in two halves. The
two assemblies were then brought to'
gether along the centre line of the
portal frame, mated and then lifted
into position. The assembly took only
two days per frame, and the lifting
operation was completed in three
hours.
Following the erection of two
frames, the roof trusses were then
hoisted into position by hand, using
light tackle rigged from the portals
which were held in position by the
cranes until sufficient trusses were con'
nected to give lateral support to the
portal frames. Longitudinal ties, brae'
ing members and glazing purlins are
then fixed by hand.
Erection of the complete structure
was completed by a staff of eighteen
men in thirteen weeks.
The- portal frame bases are secured
to the reinforced concrete foundation
blocks by means of four 2in. diameter
holding'down bolts designed to resist
shear force and uplift. These bolts
were anchored to the foundation
blocks by means of dowels turned
through 90 degrees under stout steel
flats set in the concrete, being inserted
iust prior to erection of the portal
frame by lowering them into cavities
formed by Hy ' Rib reinforcement
f*routing'in being done after final set'
tine of the structure.
Restraint against the spreading of
the foundation blocks due to horizon'
tal thrust was provided by the intro'
duction of 18in. by 18in. prestressed
concrete tie beams, using “Freyssinet”
system.

BACK TO FUNDAMENTALS.
The Victorian era with its surfeit of dec-
oration in all respects, brought the in-
evitable revulsion and the age of sim-
plicity to the stage of starkness was the
result. This German theatre auditorium
seems to carry this theme, in respect of
the proscenium to its very basic form,
for it consists of three unbroken rect-
angular planes in basket-weave pattern
like a child in a kindergarten plays
with, when provided with a few pieces
of coloured paper. The horizontal cross
piece is adjustable.
NEW BOSTON BUILDING.
This monumental structure is the Retail

tains its full measure of "perpendicu-
larity" which tall buildings endeavour to
produce.

BRIDGES SPANNING THE
BRISBANE RIVER.
The electrification of Brisbane’s
suburban railways is proceeding,
though the completion of the widen-
ing of the track, particularly in cut-
tings where large quantities of rock
must be removed, must necessarily
take some years. A number of new
bridges will have to be built, the larg-
est of them to cross the Brisbane
River at Indooroopilly having a pro-
jected length of 684 ft. There is al-
ready a railway bridge and a traffic
bridge at this point and the new
bridge will come between them. The
superstructure will be 36 ft. in height.
The steel for it will be partly as-
sembled, and then projected on to a
pier in the centre of the river, and
then continued to the Chelmer side
of the river. It will be necessary to
strengthen and to retain the present
railway bridge with its two pairs of
rails. Ten tenders were received from
various parts of the world, the high-
est, £913,576, coming from Etudes et
Entreprises in France. One came
from West Germany. It is a feather
in the cap of Queensland’s engineer-
ing enterprise that the lowest quota'
tion, £407,538, came from Evans
Deakin Hornibrook Construction Pty.
Ltd. Of the tenders received from
British firms that submitted by Dor-
man Long & Co., the builders of the
Sydney Harbour Bridge, was for
£710,329. It is intended to give prior-
ity to this work by providing the
money for it in the 1953-54 financial
programme.
Another bridge projected, over the
Brisbane River, which will bring the
number to seven, is a new bridge
from North Quay at the Southern end
of Queen Street to relieve the pres-
sure on the Victoria Bridge which
has served for more than half a cen-
tury. following the disastrous 1893
floods which carried the then existing
bridge into the stream.

TRANSPARENT STAIRS.
This sinuous erection, hovering, as it
were, 'twixt earth and sky, although
against the background of glass walls it
is difficult to discern the free-standing
treads which are devoid of risers. In
addition to the spiral ribbon-like string
and handrail even the centre post is
curved like a stick of barley sugar. Ap-
parently the idea is to provide the means
of access from floor to floor with as
little obstruction as possible to the clear
vision. It succeeds.

COMPLETION.
Construction of a block of Hous' |
ing Commission flats in Mount St.,
North Sydney, nears completion and
will be occupied shortly.
The naming of these flats caused a
public outcry late last year when it
was announced that they would be
named “Geraghty Court ” in honour
of the “rebel” member for North
Sydney, Mr. J. L. Geraghty (since
defeated) who as an Independent
member, held the balance of power
in the State Assembly.
Mr. Geraghty will be best remem',
bered having been instrumental in
bringing about the Royal Commission
on Liquor and, in the witness box,
denying his charges made under Par'
liamentary privilege.
The naming of a block of flats by
the Labour Government in this gentle'
man’s honour has never been satis'
factorily explained.
HOMES BY ROAD.
Prefabricated homes are being builttl
in two sections at a Snowy
Hydro'Electricity Authority factory inn
Cooma for re'erection at work areas.
The homes are then transported as
halTsection at a time, over the steep}
roads in the Australian Alps to for-n
ward camps.
So far more than 50 houses have-
been constructed at the rate of three)'
a week.
Most of the homes are two'bedroomn
units, but lately several three'bedroorm
houses have been built.
One half of the house consists oo
bedrooms and a lounge dining'roonn
and the other half contains thir
kitchen, bathroom and laundry. *
Of particular importance in such »
cold climate is the slag'wool insulas!
tion in the homes.
“Patients with one type of goitn:
can very likely be cured by swallows

a cost of about .£1 instead of havinn

AUSTRALIA BUILDS 77,898
HOUSES IN YEAR ENDING
JUNE 30, 1952.
Falling Off Not Yet Apparent
in Most Recent Building Figures.
The latest building figures received
(16/4/53) from the Acting Common'
wealth Statistician, Mr. S. R. Carver
(No. 20, December Quarter, 1952)
still reveal buoyant building figures
which do not as yet appear to have
caught up with the recent outcry to
the effect that building was slacken'
ing.
In the year ending June 30, 1952,
77,898 new houses were completed
throughout Australia; 80,007 were
commenced during the period and
83,083 were still under construction
at the end of it. The grand total of
Commonwealth'wide completions were
made up as follows: N.S.W., 23,273;
Victoria, 23,951; Queensland, 11,803;
South Australia, 7,711; Western Aus'
tralia, 6,577; Tasmania, 3,999, and
A.C.T., 584.
The total value of all building
work carried out throughout Austra'
lia for the year ending fune 30,
1952, was .£215,845,000; work valued
at =£315,803,000 was under construe'
tion at the end of the period, of this
<£134,643,000 was in N.S.W. and Vic'
toria.
The number employed in the Build'
ing Industry at December 17, 1952,
was 103,043, made up of 10,341 con'
tractors, 10,635 subcontractors, and
82,067 employees; 50% of this total
was in N.S.W. and Victoria. The
peak period for employment was
June 10, 1952, when it was 1 13,257,
thus the fall has been 10,214.
THE CHEQUE CELEBRATES
ITS CENTENARY.
The cheque came into existence in
its present form in 1853, though pro'
totypes have been in use for more
than 2000 years in China, India, and
the Far East, where the signatures of
well-known merchants were honoured
for vast sums.
If the writer is reputable the bank
will honour his cheque even if it is
not drawn on the usual cheque form.
A blank piece of paper will do.
One of the queerest cheques on re-
cord was written on a plank of wood
in California in 1850. The bank paid
out on it.
One of the main difficulties of bank'
insr used to be the transfer of funds
back and forth between banks, and
about the year 1770 bank messengers
or runners decided to meet at set
periods and exchange cheques. In
1775 the first clearing house was es-
tabhshed, but it was not until 1853
that New York followed the example.
CANBERRA B.W.I.U. GETS WAGE
INCREASE.
“Industrial Blackmail,”
Says Commissioner.
The dispute in Canberra between
the Master Builders’ Association and
the Building Workers’ Industrial Union
ended yesterday.
The Australian Capital Territory
Conciliation Commissioner, Mr. G. A.
Findlay, was informed that the Master
Builders had acceded to the Union’s
demands.
The dispute began last Friday when
the 8.W.1.U., supported by the Trades
and Labour Council, withdrew its men
from all work being done by Kennedy
6? Bird Pty. Ltd. in Canberra.
The firm had refused to pay the
men the 1?A marginal increase grant'
cd to members of the Amalgamated
Society of Carpenters and Joiners.
The Commissioner, in a strong com-
ment, said the action of the 8.W.1.U.
was “industrial blackmail.”
Full'sizcd motor cars arc now being
transported by 'plane. Two large
American cars were sent from Tor'
onto to Edmonton, Canada, and prov'
ed “an easy load.”
A drop of water released every sec'
ond from a leaking tap can waste as
much as 175 gallons of water a month.

CO-OPERATIVE GROCERY BUILDING AT SEATTLE.
The administration building of the Associated Grocers’ Co-op. in Seattle, U.S.A., is built
on a 26-acres site in one of the city’s outlying suburbs. The 70 by 300-foot structure is
attracting much attention as an outstanding example of efficient planning, convenience of opera-
tion, and attractive use of local materials. It was erected in conjunction with an eight-acre
warehouse and a maintenance and truck repair shop. A liberal use of glass in walls and par-
titions, and an exterior brick wall that runs right into the main lobby, give the structure
more the appearance of a huge estate than an office building.

THE AGE OF STILTS.
From tim to time children acquire a craze fpr sto;ts amd pme seen them hobbling ab out on ungainly sticks to the
accompaniment of great hilarity. Today the craze seems to have passed by the children and affected buildings, for
perusing the architectural journals of the world one sees all sorts of buildings from huge hotels and multi-storeyed
blocks of flats to simple houses all stuck up in the air on thin concrete pillars. In the tropics one can appreciate
the practical value of the air circulation provided, and in Queensland the need for this which provides a means
for white ant inspecion, but in other instances it indeed hard to come to any other conclusion than it is just
another modernistic cliche, The bottom right example has a mild attck or "Polio" as well as a touch of "bulls-
eye-itis". The top right cottage in the sloping fins between the windows has obviously been influenced by the
construction of some aluminium frefabs. All the plans could be described as "quite liveable" excepting for the
glare now being introduced in buildings through an excess of light.
