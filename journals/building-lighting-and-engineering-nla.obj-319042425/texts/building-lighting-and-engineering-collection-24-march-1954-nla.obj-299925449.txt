The all-aluminium Kingstrand house can help to meet
the requirements of housing difficulties in many parts of
the world.
The lightness of the housing-unit enables easier handling
with a considerable saving in transportation and erection
costs.
The outstanding characteristics of aluminium include
high resistance to corrosive atmospheres, imperviousness
to termites and vermin and the ability to reflect a high
percentage of all radiant heat so that rooms can be kept
at more moderate temperatures in tropical areas.

THE PEOPLE'S PARKS
The recent approval, somewhat reluctantly given by the Cumberland County
Council, of an area of the Domain adjacent to the Art Gallery for the erection of
a hypothetical Opera House, has once again raised the old controversy about filching
the people’s parks.
The inner area of Sydney is, perhaps, in comparison with some other cities,
well served by parks and open spaces, and the fact that they are within convenient
proximity of the heart of the city makes them a great asset to the citizens.
It is only necessary to wander through Hyde Park, the Botanical Gardens, or
the Domain, during the summer months particularly, to find them thronged at
lunch-time with people enjoying the sunshine and the green beauty of the gardens.
That these spacious areas are very tempting to officialdom trying to find a site
for a Baby Health Centre, a Library, Community Centre, Memorial Garden, Opera
House, or even a lowly but necessary public “comfort station,” has been only too
well demonstrated in the past, and on many occasions the members of various
citizens’ organisations, whose self-charged task it has become to protect these national
assets, have darted into the fray and have, by their vociferous protests, undoubtedly
saved many good pieces of parkland from being alienated. Without such vigilance
a fait accompli was often the inevitable result.
With Florence Taylor’s design for a cultural centre it was different. In it she
placed a Conservatorium (obviating the need for the present Conservatorium that
takes up park space), an Auditorium, Technological Museum, in a row with the
present Art Gallery; and behind the Art Gallery an Opera House, to which access
could be had from the existing Art Gallery driveway, Dr. Bradfield’s railway (under-
ground) and Sir John Young’s Crescent at the rear, from which access could also-
be had to an underground parking station to accommodate a huge number of
Sydney’s cars. We have no proposition for parking on such a large scale as this
would afford. This vast area could be completely underpinned and ventilated by a
series of pipes placed alongside of tree-trunks so as not to spoil the landscape above.
At the Macquarie end of this parking station a car-elevator with attendant could
provide every Macquarie Street medico and others with their car at a minute’s notice.
Again, in her scheme to compensate for the parkland taken up by the cultural
centre, she suggested a resumption of the lower part of Woolloomooloo for playing
fields after moving the people from the low-lying area to flats on the higher level —
a humanitarian scheme. The buildings there have been called “hovels” for the last
50 years, presumably because they are occupied by many families instead of each
house providing one family only.
Some of the greatest cities of the world have magnificent gardens and woods
which are one of their people’s greatest legacies and are never depleted in any way.
London’s Hyde Park, the Bois in Paris, Central Park in New York, Rome’s in-
numerable gardens ... so one could continue.
The desire to erect an Opera House in Sydney is one for which Eugene
Goossens, when he first arrived in Sydney some years ago, crusaded with fervent
zeal. He considered that Fort Macquarie presented an ideal site.
Again, looking round the world, one finds that some of the greatest Opera
Houses are not located on outstanding sites but take their place in the centre of
cities, rubbing shoulders with commerce and industry, for apart from the natural
desire to raise a building of monumental characteristics, the important part of an
Opera House is, after all, what goes on internally.. One does not look out of the
windows at the view. Mr. Goossens, who returned recently from abroad, now
seems to share this view and has suggested a new site over Wynyard ramp.

AUSTRALIA’S LARGEST FLAT DEVELOPMENT
“GREENWAY,” MILSON’S POINT, SYDNEY.
THREE HUNDRED AND NINE SEPARATE FLATS
A vast housing development that
has gradually reared its massive bulk
alongside the Northern approach to
the Sydney Harbour Bridge has re'
cently been completed and its 309
flats occupied by some 800 people.
It was officially opened on Sunday,
March 28th, by Mrs. Clive Evatt, wife
of the Minister for Housing.
It was at first known as Job 777
but on completion of the first small
three'storey unit it was named
“Greenway” by the Housing Commis'
sion of N.S.W., which was responsible
for the project. It was most appro'
priate to name this vast development
after Francis Greenway, Sydney’s first
architect who, under Governor Mac'
<iuarie had such vision and left such
a fine legacy of beautiful building
much of which still remains and de-
lights us.
The great block was designed by
Messrs. D. T. Morrow 6? Gordon,
leading Sydney architects, for the
Housing Commission, after Mr. P. J.
Gordon had investigated post-war
multi'unit design and construction in
Great Britain and on the Continent.
Spacious Site.
The site is on the East side of the
Northern approaches to the Harbour
Bridge, only two minutes from Mil'
sons Point rail and tram station, and
five minutes from the city by rail or
tram.
The land, 2| acres in area, was ac-
quired by the Commission from the
Main Roads Board, being the residue
of the resumptions made for the erec'
tion of the Harbour Bridge. The
buildings cover approximately 33 °/c of
the site, the remainder being set out
with lawns and gardens, providing
together with the flat roof areas, gen'
erous open space. The nett density
of the area will be 260 persons per
acre, as compared with the present
density of the neighbourhood of
twentv'five.
309 Flats.
The project contains 117 two'bed'
room, and 192 single bedroom flats
in two structural steel frame eleven'
storey sections (Blocks A and C), a
four'Storey brick bearing section
(Block B) and a six'storey reinforced
concrete frame section (Block D), the
whole being faced externally with a
warm red brick, and having steebframe
windows.
Each of the large Blocks A and C
is served with two fast-moving auto'
made electric lifts. The small blocks
are without lifts, but the larger of
them, Block D, with five floors, has a
bridge leading into the second storey
from the street so that no tenant has
to climb more than three flights of
stairs.
Maximum Sunshine and Air.
In their conception of this vast urn
dertaking the architects sought to de'
sign four connected blocks, two tall
and two short, in such a way as to ah
low the maximum circulation of air
and sunlight.
From most flats a magnificent view
of the Harbour may be seen through
picture windows.
The individual flats are planned with
all electrical kitchenette alcoves, with
adequate built-in fitments, tiled walls
and convenient garbage disposal
chutes. Bathrooms, which contain the
toilet, are tiled in bright colours. Liv-
mg rooms and bedrooms are finished
in pastel shades, the former having an
electric fire set in a brickette mantel.
Each unit is entered from a com'
mon hall to either an entrance lobby
or access hall within the unit. The
floors of the main corridors and stairs
are finished in terazzo while those
to flats are covered in linoleum. Wir-
ing has been allowed for telephones
to every flat.
Groups of private letter boxes are
set in the main entrance court.

Floor Areas.
The following table shows the areas
of various floor spaces of each unit,
with the common areas and laundries
divided among the number of units
sharing them. These areas do not in-
elude wall thicknesses.
Elaborate Electrical Installation.
The main switch room situated on
the lower ground floor of one of the
eleven'Storey buildings is a most im'
pressive sight, the room being filled
with boards covered with circuit break'
ers, fuses and time clocks for main
and auxiliary circuits, including the
lifts.
The electrical installation for 309
flats has 2308 light outlets, 1666 pow'
er outlets, 309 two'phase permanently
wired outlets, 309 3'phase permanently
wired outlets. In addition there are
33 single'phase permanently wired out'
lets to laundries and 3'phase outlets
for wash-boilers and drying cabinets.
The total connected load for the pro'
ject is 7934.5 kW.
The building of Greenway increas'
ed the load of the surrounding dis'
trict to such an extent that the
County Council constructed a new sub'
station on the MacDougal Street front'
age of the site.
In the eleven'Storey buildings the
fuses for each flat are in two special
meta Mined cupboards in the main pas'
sages of each floor, those for each flat
being clearly marked and a circuit
breaker is incorporated to permit work
to be carried out on any one flat
without interruption to other circuits.
The house service installation
serves corridors, stairs, laundries,
booster-pumps and outdoor lighting.
Stair lighting is controlled by push
buttons actuating a time'switch which
automatically switches off the light
after three minutes thus eliminating
waste of power.
Corridor lights are subdivided so
that alternative lights are on separate
circuits. One circuit controlled by
a switch operates all the time, the
other circuit works only at night and
is controlled by a time'switch. Out'
door lighting is controlled by time'
switches and operates only at night.
Garbage Disposal System.
In a project the size of Greenway
the disposal of garbage is a major
problem. Tenants obviously cannot
be expected to carry garbage bins
down ten floors and out to the street,
quite apart from the unpleasantness
of keeping a bin in a flat or the diffi'

culty of Council employees emptying
309 of them into a waggon. In
many such cases incinerators are used,
however, after studying overseas meth-
ods it was decided to use garbage
chutes to carry rubbish to large con-
tainers. The shutes are constructed
of glazed earthenware pipes as this
material does not readily hold the
rubbish and is easily cleaned down
when necessary. Hopper-type open-
ings are provided in or handy to each
flat and all refuse except large cases
or bottles can be wrapped and placed
in these. Specially designed bins
stand at the bottom of each shute and
as these fill they are jacked on to a
trolley moved out and replaced by
empty ones. The containers are then
wheeled to one of two garbage dis-
posal bays and emptied by the Coun-
cil employees. Most bins are cleared
daily and the present success of the
method is due in no small measure to
the co-operation of the North Sydney
Council. The position of the shutes
has dictated to some extent the level
and position of paths around the
buildings for all shutes must be con-
nected to a garbage disposal bay by a
path of slope easy enough to allow
a man to haul a fully laden container
over it.
Fire Precautions.
In the case of fire each wing is pro-
vided with a fire escape stair with aut-
omatically closing metal fire-doors,
while fire extinguishers are handy to
all escape stairs. Lift and meter
rooms have special chemical extin-
guishers fitted to combat electrical
fires.
In addition all rooms and corridors
are served by a fire alarm system and
a thermostat in the ceiling is connect-
ed to an indicator board at the en-
trance of the building. The sudden
change of temperature caused by a fire
actuates the thermostat, ringing an
alarm bell in the building and also
indicating on the board the position
of the fire. The system is connected
directly by land-line to the headquart-
ers of the District Fire Brigade and
immediately gives the alarm there also.
Booster pumps are constructed outside
both the larger sections to give extra
pressure to the water for fighting fires
on the upper floors.
Laundry Facilities.
Tenants in all buildings are provid-
ed with means to do their own wash-
ing. In the two smaller buildings the
laundries are in the lower ground floors
"while in the larger blocks one laun-
dry is built on each floor and there is
also an extra one on the ground floor.
All are equipped with wash-boilers and
dryers, operating on coin in slot met-
ers. Rooms for airing clothes are also
provided in the basement to the two
major blocks.
Economy in upkeep was a major
requirement in the planning of this
huge project, and each elevation has
been designed to limit exterior paint-
ing to the steel frames of the windows.
Material Statistics.
An idea of the great size of the
project may be gathered from the
following details of materials used:
Face bricks: 1,550,000; Common
bricks, 2,000,000; Cement: 3,231 tons;
Structural steel: 1,350 tons; Reinforc-
ing steel: 400 tons.

UNIFORM BUILDING
REGULATIONS.
Board of Inquiry Set Up in Victoria.
A Board of Inquiry to recommend
to the Minister for Public Works sug'
gested amendments to existing regU'
lations has been set up in Victoria.
The board comprises Mr. C. E.
Tuxen, engineer and surveyor (chair-
man); Cr. A. K. Lines, vice-presi-
dent of the Municipal Association; Mr.
S. T. Parkes, chairman of the Royal
Victorian Institute of Architects; Mr.
S. T. Parkes, chairman of the Royal
Victorian Institute of Architects; Mr.
T. W. Morris, president of the Mast-
er Builders’ Association; Mr. A. C.
Leith, structural engineer; Mr. G. A.
Lang, assistant building surveyor of
the Melbourne City Council; and Mr.
D. Lovegrove, secretary of the Vic-
torian A.L.P., representing the trade
unions.
The Minister, Mr. Merrifield, said
the Government considered an inves-
tigation by an expert body was neces-
sary because of complaints that the
regulations were deficient.
Terms of reference were:
1. What amendments are necessary
to give effect to any suggestions by
persons or bodies associated with the
building industry.
2. What are the best means of im-
proving the administration by by-laws
and regulations under the Local Gov-
ernment Act or any other Act gov-
erning the erection of buildings.
3. How best can the results of re-
search into and modern developments
in the design and construction of
buildings be incorporated in the uni'
form building regulations.
“NOTHING NEW UNDER
THE SUN”
The addition of the Western end
of St. Johns Cathedral in Brisbane, es-
timated to cost £400,000, is being
visualised, now that a quarter of this
sum (including a donation of £lO,OOO
worth of building porphyry) has been
subscribed. So nearly does it appear
to be assured, it was recently remark'
ed by a reverend gentleman that it
was doubtful whether a sufficient num-
ber of stonemasons could be secured
to perform the work. The old order
of preparing the stone on the job has
been superseded in many buildings by
the fashioning of it in workshops,
where most of the work is done by ma'
chinery, and the prepared slabs of
freestone, marble etc., brought on to
the job and fixed in the positions they
have been prepared to fill. Just how
old is this practice, which we call
“modern,” may be judged from read'
ing verse 7 of Chapter VI. 1 Kings,
as follows: “And the house, when it
was in building, was built of stone
made ready before it was brought
thither; so that there was neither
hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron
heard in the house, while it was in
building.” The “building” was, of
course, Solomon’s Temple, which can
by no means be regarded as “mod-
ern,” having been built about 3000
years ago.
A study of ancient history provides
us with an awareness, that there is
nothing new under the sun.

Architects: Stafford, Moor & Farrington.
Kellogg (Australia) Pty. Ltd. are to
build a new office block at the Bot'
any premises. It will comprise a base'
ment, a ground floor on two levels,
and two upper floors.
It is designed in accordance with
the modern conception of office build'
ings to provide efficient working con'
ditions, which are congenial for the
staff and at the same time have an ad'
vertising value to the company’s pro'
ducts.
The basement houses locker rooms
and amenities for factory staff and will
be connected to the existing factory
buildings by underground tunnel.
The ground floor is on two levels.
the part above the basement in the
main building wing being raised to
give window lighting and ventilation
to the basement below.
In this main wing the ground floor
and the two upper floors are devoted
to office space. A conference-room is
on the ground floor. The principal
toilet accommodation is at the first'
floor level, for easy access from all
parts of the building. A small elevator
is provided in this wing.
The lower ground'floor wing con'
tains the main entrance lobby and
executive and its flat'roof area will be
developed as a roof garden. It is pro'
tected from the south by the main
building wing, and from the west by
a parapet wall, topped with pergola
treatment.
Skilled Planning.
The fundamental problem in plan-
ning the building was that the site
faces due west to Stephen Road and is
exposed to hot afternoon sun in sum'
mer and cold westerly winds in winter.
The proposed building has Been de'
signed so that the main wing runs
east and west, with its windows on the
north and southern sides. The single'
storey executive wing has windows to
all sides except the west.

Oldest Australian Charity
Still Expanding
STATE GOVERNOR OPENS NEW HOSPITAL BLOCK.
“Although the oldest charitable or'
ganisation in Australia, our Society is
still suffering from growing pains, for
more accommodation is being made
available, or is urgently needed in our
Royal Hospital for Children, Ren'
wick Babies’ Hospital and our Scarba
House for Children,” said Mr. C. P.
R. Hurditch (President) at the 141st.
annual meeting of the Benevolent So'
ciety of N.S.W. at its Royal Hospital
for Women recently.
He disclosed that during the past
year over 30,850 men, women and
children had been cared for by the
Society.
At its Royal Hospital for Women,
4237 babies had been born and 20,351
womenfolk cared for; 5226 sick
babies were nursed through its Ren'
wick Infants’ Hospital at Summer Hill,
437 kiddies found a home at Scarba
Welfare House and many mothers
convalesced at the Society s 1 Rest'
awhile” Home.
Building Extensions.
The N.S.W. Health Minister, Mr.
M. O'Sullivan, moved the adoption
of the report for 1953, which referred
to the completion of the first section
of the Nurses’ new quarters at the
“Royal Hospital, the commencement
of building a new Outpatients’ Depart'
ment and Staff Quarters at the Oxford
Street entrance, and reconstruction of
the Admission Department.
The nurses’ new quarters, when
completed, will cost £275,000, and the
Outpatients’ Department a further
£250,000. The steelwork for the lat'
ter project is now being erected.
The Society receives an annual sub'
sidy of £361,000 from the State Gov'
ernment. Administration costs climb'
ed £BO,OOO a year during the past
three years, and went past the
£500,000 mark, the Treasurer, Mr.
W. G. Charlton, told the meeting.
“However, the galloping inflation
has now been corrected,” he said.
Governor’s Remarks.
The Governor of N.S.W., Sir lohn
Northcott, K.C.V.0., was welcomed
by the President. Mr. Hurditch.
Sir John, replying in his usual
happy vein, commented that the
Queen had been “absolutely thrilled
to be in Sydney.
“Discount the rumours that she
was worn out. That was far from
being the case. She would come home
absolutely thrilled, and recount all the
incidents of the day’s happenings.
She showed no signs of tiredness,”
Sir John said.
It was brought home to him that
the Queen serves us and calls for our
service also.
“She has pointed out to us our op'
portunity to give some service to the
community,” Sir John added.
Unveiling of Plaque.
Following the termination of the
meeting, the Governor was escorted
to the entrance of the nurses’ new
quarters, where he unveiled a plaque
commemorating the occasion.
Sir John praised the noble work of
the sisters, nurses, and staff, and wish'
ed them every happiness and comfort
in their new home.
ENERGY EXPENDITURE
In walking down stairs does a per'
son use more energy than when walk'
ing on the level. If your guess is
Yes, then you are right. Investigation
into physical reactions of the body
show that each step down brings into
play a larger number of muscles to
maintain the correct position of the
different parts of the body and adjust'
ing the body to the new posture with
every step.

BALMAIN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
175 FLATS ERECTED BY HOUSING COMMISSION OF N.S.W.
On the harbour frontage at the em
trance to Iron Cove, the Housing
Commission of N.S.W. has recently
completed, at an approximate cost of
£475,000 (including cost of land,
building and road construction), a
flats project second only in size to
the “Greenway” project at North
Sydney.
The development has been erected
on land bounded by Elliott and Glas'
sop Streets, Balmain, and contains 175
flats in thirteen individual blocks. The
building construction was carried out
bv C. A. Gaskin Pty. Ltd. under the
supervision of Messrs. Brewster 6?
Murray, Architects, and the internal
road construction by Mr. W. E. Frap'
pell.
The estate has been developed over
the past three and a half years and
the accompanying photograph taken
shortly before the completion of the
two blocks in the left foreground,
shows the internal roadwork and the
manner in which the area surrounding
the remaining blocks, which have
now been occupied some little time,
has been terraced with the aid of the
stone retaining walls. The undeveh
oped area in front of the two blocks
not occupied, is now being treated in
a similar manner.
Death of
Mr. A. I. Rigby
The death occurred on March 9, of
Mr. A. L. Rigby.
Les Rigby, partner in the leading
building organisation of Kell &
Rigby, was welhknown throughout
Australia not only for the many im-
portant structures that he had erected
but also on account of his great public
service, for he devoted a very large
part of his time and energies to the
welfare of his fellow men, particularly
those who were less fortunate, such
as the crippled children.
Important Buildings Erected.
Founded in 1911, the firm of Kell
& Rigby have been responsible for
the erection of a number of import'
ant buildings in Sydney including the
Anzac Memorial, the Grace Building
A.P.A. Building, Department of Ag'
riculture, S. Hoffnung, Medic a 1
School, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,
sections of Bunnerong Power House,
and the Britstand Building at Mascot.
His son, Mr. Alex. Rigby, is a mem'
ber of the firm.
Mr. Rigby was President of the
Citizens’ Reform Association of Sydney
a former Governor of the twenty'
ninth district of Rotary International
and Director of the Rotary Club of
Sydney.
He was also a member of the
N.S.W. Housing Commission, a mem'
ber of the Western Suburbs District
Hospital Board, Chairman of the
Board of the N.S.W. Society for
Crippled Children, a director of Boys’
Brigade, a councillor of the Royal
Empire Society, and of the N.R.M.A.
The funeral took place on March
10, after a service at St. John’s Church,
Ashfield.
Eloquent Tribute.
In an eloquent tribute to Mr.
Rigby’s memory, the Rev. A. B.
Campbell, a retired Presbyterian min'
ister, said it had been his natural de'
sire to share his life with others. He
gained a friendly, simple delight in
serving mankind.
He had not been an individualist;
his centre lay beyond himself, and he
had given freely, without counting
the cost to his health.
The ancient Greeks had a word for
moulding a substance or individual,
the speaker continued. That word
was “character,” and the quality of
Mr. Rigby’s life was its moral force.

Were much needed in these times.
“It is great to live a life in which
me can create things and not de'

lasting value to the community, be it
a building, a reputation, or a partner-
ship.”
“Mr. Rigby had been in partnership
with Mr. W. J. Kell for 40 years,
and he prided himself on the quality
of workmanship which reveals the
quality of the man.
“These high standards were main'
tained in the standards of his voca'
tion, and Mr. Rigby would be the
first to acknowledge his debt to the

RESPONSIBILITY OF
CITIZENSHIP
The past fifteen years have seen
many changes in our economic front.
Many anomolous positions, too, have
arisen, not the least of which effect
the ordinary citizen and his suburban
home.
Building costs have risen three or
four fold since 1939; rents have been
held down by controls. Municipal
costs have increased enormously and
thus rates have risen steeply.
These and other attendant prob-
lems have caused distress and disgust
to rise in the hearts of many a citizen
home'owner or landlord who feel that
they are indeed the lost tribe that
nobody cares about.
No matter what one may think in'
dividually or to what political party
or world trend one may attribute the
cause, it seems fairly certain that we
will have to accustom ourselves to pre'
vailing high wages and costs.
The retiring Mayor of Mosman,
Alderman G. I. Ferris, in his final
minute to Council made reference to
these problems.
"‘Mosman is growing old and many
business premises, homes and gardens
are not receiving the same attention
they did in years gone by. I realise
only too well that high costs and com'
paratively low rents are major causes
of deterioration. Perhaps a better un-
derstanding and a little more co-op-
eration between tenant and owner may
achieve something. It might be the
means of putting a few nails in a
fence before it has completely fallen
over; of placing a gallon or so of
paint around some windows or doors,
and what an amazing and pleasing
difference that makes too, and then
with hedges trimmed and the garden
plot cultivated, the home, no matter
how small or how old, takes on a
new, cleaner and tidier appearance. It
looks as though it is a home and that
someone cares and is proud and happy
to live there.
To qualify as good citizens I be-
lieve that each and every one of us
must appreciate that we have a re-
sponsibility to our fellow residents.
We must all be prepared to do our
share.”
A little co-operation, a few nails,
and a drop of paint is worth in prac-
tical results much more than cursing
the landlord for his hard heart; the
tenant for his neglect and the council

The Fibrous Plaster Association
of New South Wales
SUCCESSFUL ANNUAL DINNER.
The Annual Dinner of the Fibrous
Plaster Association of New South
Wales was held at Amory, Ashfield,
on March 11, and as usual was a most
successful and enjoyable function, be-
ing attended by some 100 members of
the Association meeting in Sydney in
Annual Conference.
The Fibrous Plaster Dinner has
gained for itself a distinctive place in
the building calendar and every year
a most representative gathering of im-
portant personages in Parliament and
in the industry attend this function.
On this occasion the chief guest
was the Hon. Clive R. Evatt, M.L.A.,
Minister for Housing, while the
Leader of the State Opposition, the
Hon. Vernon Treatt, M.L.A., also at-
tended. The toast of Parliament was
proposed bv Mr. E. H. Tytherleigh,
President of the Association of the
Co'operative Building Societies of
N.S.W. who, in a breezy address, out'
lined the progress of Parliament since
the earliest days. Organisations such
as the FibrousPlaster Association were,
he said, the democratic parliaments of
that industry, and followed naturally
upon the old craft guilds. He would
like, however, to see that pride in
craftsmanship and personal skill which
it was necessary to attain before being
admitted to the craft guild of the
past, more in evidence in this age of
trades unionism. He described Magna
Carta as the first great parliamentary
foundation stone. Since then, he said,
amidst considerable laughter, founda'
tion stones have been issuing from
parliamentary sources with increasing
rapidity.
The Hon. Clive Evatt, in respond-
ing to the toast of Parliament, said
that the democratic system was the
finest yet evolved and it had been a
rich experience to be present at the
recent opening of the N.S.W. Par-
liament by Her Majesty The Queen,
this ceremony being performed in the
oldest legislative chamber in the Brit-
ish Commonwealth outside the Mother
Country. It was necessary, he said,
for the people to see that a parlia-
mentary system did not become frus-
trated by the weight of bureaucracy
and red tape.
He paid tribute to the fibrous plast-
er industry, particularly the manner
in which it was decentralised, for there
was hardly an important country town
in N.S.W. where this versatile material
was not manufactured and the product
distributed by members of the Asso-
ciation, many of whom were present
here tonight.
Sulman Medal Presented For Royal Swedish Legation
At a luncheon of the N.S.W. Chap-
ter of the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects at the Trocadero, Sydney,
on Wednesday last, March 10, the Sir
John Sulman Medal for 1952 was pres-
ented to Messrs. Peddle, Thorp &
Walker, Architects, for the Royal
Swedish Legation Building at Can-
berra. The Diploma and Medal was
presented to Mr. George Thorp, sen-
ior member of the firm by Mr. E. W.
Andrew, President of the N.S.W.
Chapter.
The bronze Plaque which is affixed
to buildings awarded the Sulman
Medal was handed to Mr. A. Ros,
Charge d'Affaires, Royal Swedish Le-
gation, representing the Minister for
Sweden. He was also handed a copy
of the Sulman Diploma for transmis-
sion to Mr. E. H. G. Lundquist, the
Swedish architect who prepared the
original sketch plans for the building.
Mr. I. Stenstrom, Consul for Sweden,
and Mr. I. Knutzelius, Vice-Consul, in
Sydney, were-also present.
Mr. Ros, in thanking the President
on behalf of the Embassy, said that
the award has caused great interest
and given great pleasure to the Swed-
ish people.
Mr. George Thorp said that to be
lucky enough to win the Sulman
Medal an architect required a good
client, a good site and a good build"
er. They had been most fortunate
in each of these three respects in the
present award. Mr. W\ A. Grant,
Managing Director of John Grant 6?
Sons Pty. Ltd., builders of the Lega-
tion, was also present.

The Building Industry
In proposing the toast of the build-
ing industry, the Hon. Vernon Treatt
said that it was an unavoidable fact
that the building industry was one of
the most vital in any community, and
if it was busy and healthy so was the
rest of industry. The industry could
go ahead in the confident knowledge
that provided they gave the commun-
ity satisfaction, they would never
work themselves out of a job, for
there was work ahead for a 100 years;
after that they could start all over
again rebuilding.
In response to the toast of the
Building Industry, Mr. S. D. C. Ken-
nedy, F.1.A.8., President of the Build-
ing Industry Congress of N.S.W., said
that the industry must have finance
and men if Australia was to progress.
Australia possessed the shortest work-
ing hours in the world other than
America, but in order to justify these
conditions employees must work the
full hours if we are to prosper. Mi-
gration was vital to Australia but in
order to attract the right type proper
housing must be made available.
Mr. Percy Bottomley, F.A.1.8..
President of the Master Builders’ As-
sociation of N.S.W., in supporting
Mr. Kennedy, said that building was
a “grand industry” and after 50 years
of association with it he would cer-
tainly adopt it if he were starting all
over again.
The toast of the Fibrous Plaster As-
sociation was proposed by Mr. Cobden
Parkes, F.R.1.8.A.. Government Ar-
chitect of N.S.W., who stressed the
special qualities of fibrous plaster and
the fact that it had been developed in
Australia and was unique to this coun-
try. “Continue,” he said, addressing
the members, “to take pride in your
Association and the quality of your
material, and you will go forward in
the remarkable fashion that has char-
acterised your organisation in its com-
paratively short life.
Industry Now Established.
Mr. D. J. O’Dell, immediate Past
President of the Association, in his re-
sponse, said that he felt that the in-
dustry was now established as an inte-
gral part of the building industry in
N.S.W. He made no apologies for
saving with pride that he considered
that this satisfactory state of affairs had
been obtained purely through their
own efforts. He knew of no other
material in the industry that was man-
ufactured and fixed on the job by the
same people, so that they took re-
sponsibility from start in finish.
The new President of the Associa-
tion, Mr. Gordon New, proposed the
toast of the guests, the response being
in the hands of Mr. A. L. Smale,
Deputy Director, War Service Homes
Division. Mr. D. Stewart Fraser,
M.L.A.. Executive Director of the
Building Industry Congress of N.S.W.,
acted as Master of Ceremonies in his
usual good-natured and efficient
manner, while during the function
Don Graham, baritone, Lochie Mc-
Laren, raconteur, George Herd, jug-
gler and Dexter, magician, entertained
the gathering.
Mr. Evatt, in speaking of the pro-
gress of the Association, paid tribute
to the work of its energetic and effi-
cient secretary Mr. Tod Jarman.
NEW RHEEM ELECTRIC
WATER HEATERS.
Easy to Install.
Rheem Australia Pty. Ltd. announce
two new electric water heaters. These
are easily installed, the only connec-
tions required being to the cold water
mains and to the electricity supply.
Because of their design, they may be
installed at any level anywhere in the
home and without head pressure re-
strictions. This makes them ideal for
flat roofed or modern two level homes.
and in addition, the use of small bore
pipe cuts considerably both installation
and operating costs.
The first of these Mains Pressure
electric models, Series 501, 35 gallon
unit which has a lower “off peak” ele-
ment and an upper booster element.
The other new model is the Series
500 which is an Electric Mains Pres-
sure Unit of 25 gallons capacity, de-
signed to operate on continuous tariff.
Both these models have storage cyl-
inders made of electrically arc welded
steel with a heavily hot dipped zinc
coating, similar to those of the gas
mains pressure units.
New Mains Pressure Gas Model.
In addition, to meet the demand for
a de luxe unit, Rheem is adding to
their range of Gas Mains Pressure
units, a new Series 30 “Coppermatic”
unit of 15 gallons capacity, which
has a cylinder fabricated of Cusilman
bronze, and otherwise operates simil-
arly to our other gas units.
The retail prices of these new mod-
els are as follows- -501/35: <£s4/10/0;
500/25: <£43/10/0; 30/15: £7l/10/0.

Flicker Discomfort In Lighting
LECTURE TO ILLUMINATING SOCIETY, LONDON.
Messrs. J. B. Collins, B.Sc., and R.
G. Hopkinson, Ph.D., M.1.E.E., in a
paper delivered before the meeting of
the Illuminating Engineering Society,
London, on 9th March, 1954, said
that flicker is a factor introduced into
the lighting problem from the popu-
larity of discharge lamps, especially
fluorescent tubular lamps. Such lamps
have a much greater degree of light
fluctuation than filament lamps of com-
parable light output.
Flicker in modern lighting is shown
by the investigation not to be a ser-
ious problem but it does give rise to
complaint because some slight discom-
fort or annoyance is caused to some
people on some occasions. People
vary very widely in their sensitivity
to flicker and any one individual will
vary in his sensitivity from time to
time.
In a well-engineered lighting instal-
lation, flicker should be noticeable
only by a small percentage of the gen-
eral population, and only on large
bright areas such as the white paper
on a drawing board, or a luminous
ceiling. By the of techniques such
as two lamps on a “lead-lag circuit,
oi three lamps on the phases of a 3-
phase supply, the possibility or annoy-
ance from flicker can be effectively
eliminated.
The nature of the visual processes,
and of the engineering factors, which
together govern flicker perception in
lighted interiors, have been investigat-
ed. Flicker is more readily perceived
on large areas than on small, and the
brighter the area the greater the
chance of flicker being seen. A large
area of moderate brightness may, how-
ever, show flicker more readily than
the smaller brighter lamp which illum-
inates it. A lamp which does not
“black-out” between cycles (on an
A.C. supply) will cause less flicker
than one which does. At the present
moment, most “warm” colour lamps
have a significant amount of after-
glow, and so do not black-out. Other
developments on luminiscent powders
may enable these advantages to br
shared by lamps of “colder” colour.
Two nresent-day “cold” lamps on a.
lead-lag circuit exhibit the same ef-
fective flicker characteristic as a typi-
cal “warm” lamp alone, i.e., the cir-
cuit supplies the afterglow lacking in
the fluorescent powder of the “cold"
lamps.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Faulty starters, old lamps, and cir-
cuit faults can introduce severe flicker,
but these are matters which are easily
recognised and put right. A signifi-
cant factor which is not recognised is,
however, the presence of a 50'cycle
component in the wave-form of the
light output of the lamp, superimpos-
ed on the normal 100'cycle wave-form.
Part of this can be eliminated by
screening the lamps, not all old lamps,
show some SOcycle asymmetry all
along their length. A small amount,
2 i per cent, of the total light output,
•of such a component is readily vis-
ible as flicker by most people under
typical drawing-board conditions. The
prevalence of this factor in practice is
not known, but it is believed to be
■one of the chief causes of noticeable
flicker in practice.

American Production Methods Impressive
SYDNEY ARCHITECT RETURNS FROM STUDY TOUR.
Mr. T. A. Daly, B.Arch., was select'
ed last year, with Mr. David Stewart,
B.E.D. Phil (Oxon), by the American
Education Committee on the quota of
two graduates of Australian Univers-
ities to attend the Summer Course at
The Massachusetts Institute of Tech'
nology. Both successful selected ap'
plicants were also granted Fulbright
Scholarships.
Mr. Daly is a Sydney University
Graduate in Architecture, and also
holds a Diploma in Town and Coun-
try Planning from that University and
is the first Australian Architect select'
ed to attend a M.I.T. Summer Course.
Mr. Daly left Sydney in May, 1953,
and proceeded by plane to the United
States and across the continent by train
to Boston where he spent four months
attending lectures in Architecture and
City planning at M.I.T. The course
concluded with one month’s travel
through the eastern states, with intro'
ductions to such well known Archi'
tects as Walter Gropius, Carl Koch,
Phillip Johnson, Eliot Noyes, Paul
Rudolph and Will© Von Molke.
He then travelled to England and
Europe giving intense study to the
various aspects of the problems met
in private practice and brought back
some 1200 colour slide photographs
of prominent buildings throughout the
world.
Impressions Gained.
His outstanding impressions gained
abroad were:
In the United States: (i) The econ-
omy of construction in the medium
sized factory and the prefabricated or
mass produced house as in Levitt
Town; (h) The methods builders use
in organising the erection and order'
ing of work to ensure maximum man
production hours; (iii) The contin'
ual adaption of Building Regulations
to provide for use of new materials
consistant with contemporary design
and the maintenance of protection
factors for fire, structural strength,
and modern living standards; (iv)
The use of dry construction to expe-
dite erection of large city buildings,
including the use of prefabricated ex-
terior panels as in the Alcoa, United
Nations, and Lever Buildings; (v) The
emphasis on classroom design in the
post'war schools from Kindergarten to
University.
On the Continent: (i) The excel'
lence of Danish and Swedish mass
housing and apartment buildings; (ii)
Office buildings and churches in
Switzerland; (iii) The apartment
buildings, factories, and exhibition
buildings of Pier Luigi Nervi in Italy.
Mr. Daly is a senior member of

New Swedish Building Methods and
Materials Shown at Gothenburg Fair
SECTIONAL BUILDING RAPIDLY GAINING GROUND
Prefabrication and standardization
have made rapid progress in the
Swedish building industry in recent
years. New methods and materials
are being employed on an increasing
scale, making it possible to build
houses quicker, better and cheaper.
This rationalisation of the building
industry is largely the result of an ex-
tensive research and practical experi'
ments, starting out from the basic
thought that the building industry has
long been lagging behind in technical
development and that there must be
ways and means of lowering the costs.
In carrying on this research private
enterprise, Government institutions and
local authorities have largely pooled
their resources.
A broad and interesting survey of
the progress made was given at the
Internationa] Autumn Fair, held in
Gothenburg, September 12'20 which
included a special exhibition called
“Building and Home,” with different
departments for construction and in-
terior decoration.
Like most countries, Sweden has
been confronted with a difficult hous'
ing problem for many years. Though
not being dragged into the war and
thus having her existent supply of
dwellings intact, house building has
largely been hampered by economic
reasons and partly also by lack of la'
hour. Several other factors have com'
plicated the situation and contributed
to stepping up the demand for new
dwellings. According to statistics pre'
sented by the Swedish Board of Hous'
ing at the Gothenburg exhibition it
will take a further number of years
before the situation has been normal'
ized, in spite of a very lively building
activity at present.
Influx to Cities Causes Problem.
Since the end of the war no less
than 400,000 apartments have been
built, providing accommodation for
1.25 million people, or one'fifth of
the population. This is more than
during any other period of similar
length. That it has not sufficed de'
pends chiefly on the increase of popu'
lation —10.6 per cent, in the'l94o’s
as against 4 per cent, in the 1920’s —
the unprecedented influx of people to
the cities from the country areas and
the fact that young people now marry
earlier than previously. A higher
economic standard and the general so'
cial welfare policy are other factors
that have played an important role in
raising the demand for new and better
dwellings. Moreover, the average
length of life is longer, and there is
practically no emigration, Sweden, on
the contrary, now being an immigra-
tion country.
The relation between wages and
rents have, however, developed fa'
vourably. While before the war an
industrial worker had to pay about 40
per cent, of his income for a modern
two'room'and'kitchen apartment, it
now takes less than 20 per cent. The
Board also gave an account for the
various Swedish Government measures
for supporting house building, chiefly
by loans at low interest. These meas'
ures include considerable investments
for raising the general housing stand'
ard in rural districts. Nowadays new'
ly built country houses are largely fit'
ted out just as modernly as in the
cities, having a bath, central heating,
a kitchen with electric stove, refriger'
ator, stainless sinks, etc.
Prefabrication the Key Word.
The Swedish Contractors’ Associa-
tion had arranged another interesting
display, with a modern scaffolding of
light steel tubing—seen all over the
Central Hall—as the focal point. Here
they demonstrated with graphs and
photographic enlargements interesting
building schemes recently completed
by some of their members. In Avesta,
in Central Sweden, as well as in Mah
mo and other places several houses
have been built according to the
Sundh Method. This system, develop'
ed by the Swedish building engineer
Ernst Sundh, involves the casting of
wall and floor sections on the building
site, with window and door frames as
well as tubing fitted in their places.
The large standardised elements are
then placed in position by means of a
powerful crane and are joined together
with cement. This method, which is
now being tried also in France and
some other countries, will be used for
23 houses with 500 apartments about
to be built in Kyrkbyn, in Gothenburg.
These houses will also be provided
with prefabricated chimneys, into
which will be cast all major elements
for heating, plumbing and electricity.
It is estimated that the building time
is reduced bv about three months for
an ordinary apartment house, at the
same time also considerably lowering
the costs.
Similar prefabrication building car'
ried out by the large contracting firms
Skanska Cementgjuteriet and Nya As*
fait AB with factory'cast elements were
also shown.
Slide Mould Casting.
Another method, which in recent
years has found extensive use in Swed'
en for the erection of silos, factory
buildings, etc., is the sliding mould
system. A particularly interesting
project, described at the Gothenburg
exhibition, was the construction re'
cently of the 90 feet high iron sponge
plant at Persberg, in Central Sweden.
The contractors, the Siab Company,
of Stockholm, here cast 2,600 cu. ft.
of concrete in nine days by means of
sliding moulds, while a roof structure
of steel, weighing 110 tons, was used
as working platform, gradually being
raised to the top of the building as
the casting proceeded.
The well'known Swedish Siporex
building material was demonstrated in
a special outdoor exhibit. This porous
material, which today is produced on
a license in many countries, including
the U.S.A., combined many excellent
properties. It is light and strong and
has a high insulating capacity against
cold, heat and sound. Moreover, it
is fire'resistant and can be worked
with hand tools more or less like
wood. It is produced in slabs as well
as in large wall sections, while long
self'bearing elements are supplied for
roofs and floors. This type of mater'
ial is used for all kinds of houses from
small villas to big factory buildings.
One of the company’s latest contri'
butions to the prefabrication develop'
ment is the production of building ele'
ments resembling heavy splintered
planks. Lifted in position by an ord'
inary truck crane and easily handled
by a couple of hands, they are quick'
ly assembled into houses. Ordinary
mortar work is practically entirely eh
iminated. Outside plastering is not
needed and papering can be made di'
rect on to the inside.
Prefabricated timber houses are by
now an old Swedish speciality. In
this field standardisation has been
brought almost to perfection. It
would, however, be a complete mis'
take to believe that all Swedish tim'
ber houses look just alike. The stand'
ardised elements permit of innumerable
variations in size and appearance. The
Swedish manufacturers of timber
houses deliver almost anything from
fairly large hospital buildings to small

bungalows and rolling canteens and
workers’ vans. The out-door exhibits
included several well-equipped units
of the latter type as well as summer
bungalows, completely equipped and
furnished.
Cement Transport in
Pneumatic Tanks.
Among the exhibits were a wealth
of cranes, trucks, concrete mixers and
other building machinery. A unit at'
tracting special interest among foreign
visitors was a lorry for bulk transport
of cement in tanks according to the
Swedish Interconsult system. The
cement is Unloaded from the tanks
into silos at the building site by means
of pneumatic pumps built into the
truck. This method has been found
highly economical as no bagging is
required and loading and unloading
takes a minimum of time and labour,
the whole work being handled by the
driver alone. Besides, there are no
losses through dusting. Over 50 per
cent, of all cement used in the large
Swedish cities is now transported in
such tank trucks.
This Gothenburg exhibition also
comprised a series of full scale mod'
els of apartments, where Swedish ar'
chitects presented their latest ideas of
how a home should be equipped and
furnished in order to be practical and
cosy. Suppliers of the hundreds of
products that go to equip a modern
building, of course, also showed their
articles. There was an abundance of
laminated doors, full view windows,
washing machines, bath room equip-
ment, refrigerators, etc. Furniture
manufacturers and interior decorators
occupied two of the halls, presenting
one of the largest and most beautiful
displays of modern Swedish interior
decoration and industrial art ever stag-
ed.
A special sound insulation exhibit
supplied the somewhat surprising in-
formation that a woman’s voice can
scream some one thousand periods
higher than a radio set. This was
proved by means of push-button op-
erated records demonstrating the in-
sulating capacity of various types of
wall and floor constructions against
different types of sound, from insect
music with up to 20,000 periods per
second and aeroplane noise to human
voices. The male voice varies from
70 to 6000 periods and the female
from 150 to 9000.
Another feature was a model of the
City of Gothenburg l s new electricity
works at Savenas combined with a
plant for central distant heating of
6700 apartments by means of exhaust
steam.
20 Countries Offered Varied Fair.
Other departments, too, at this fair
—Gothenburg’s first international one
—had much of interest to offer the
visitor. In all, 775 firms from 20
countries participated. West Ger-
many was represented by 85 exhibi-
tors. Great Britain by 29, while 17
were American firms. Many interest'
ing novelties were displayed, as, for
instance, a new ASEA device for pro-
tecting power and telephone installa-
tions from damage by lightning and
a handy tool, called the Cromna
wrench, which can be used both as a
spanner and as a pipe-wrench. In
the handicraft section the lady visitors
seemed to be specially tempted by
Greek and Jugoslavian rugs and em-
broideries.
Gothenburg being called “Sweden’s
Gateway to the West,” it fits in well
to mention in conclusion an exhibit
arranged by the Port Authorities, il-
lustrating the rapid growth of traffic
and port facilities. The total amount
of shipping calling at this port in
1952 comprised 18,000,000 net register
tons, of which 13,000,000 tons were
overseas traffic. Imports via this ship-
ping centre have more than doubled
since the 1930’5.
Sliding mould casting was used by the Siab contractors for the erection of this
90 ft. high plant at Persberg in Central Sweden. The steel roof construction, weigh-
ing 110 tons, was used as working platform, moving with the moulds to the top.
SWEDISH OVERPASS ROUNDABOUT.
Following the U.S. trend of constructing
overpass roundabouts on highways, an
unusual overpass in the form of a round-
about was opened late last year on the
Ma'mo-Lund motorway in Sweden. As
seen from the illustration, this round-
about passes over two roadways and a
railway track, and feeds traffic into
seven separate motorways. Vehicular
traffic using the roundabout keeps to
the right, as in other Continental coun-
tries, and the design of the overpass
reduces risk of accidents.

Aluminium Aircraft Hangar at
London Airport
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION DETAIL .S
[Extract from a lecture by L. E. WARD, A.M.l.Struct.E.]
In May, 1950, the Ministry of Civil
Aviation invited tenders for the de'
sign and construction of a three'bay
hangar at London Airport. With a
view to reducing maintenance costs to
a minimum, the roof structure was to
he fabricated in aluminium alloy but
the stanchions, at the discretion of the
tenderer, could be either steel or
aluminium.
The original specification drawn up
by the Ministry of Civil Aviation ah
lowed great latitude as far as the struc-
tural design was concerned, and it
dealt mainly with the functional aspect
and standards of materials and work'
manship. The hangars were to be
used for the maintenance of aircraft,
and as an aid to the efficiency of the
operatives a high degree both of ther'
mal insulation and natural lighting was
essential. As a means of reducing the
fire hazard, a deluge fire control sys'
tern was to be incorporated in the roof.
Each of the three bays of the
hangar was to give a clear working
area 125 ft. wide by 110 ft. deep, with
a minimum height of 30ft. In addi'
tion, each was to be furnished with a
thermally insulated and power'operated
door giving a clear opening 125 ft.
wide by 30ft. high.
That part of the specification con'
cerning the intensity of natural light'
ing was concise and simply stated that
the arrangement of glazing was to en-
sure a daylight factor of 18 (com'
put e d according to T.P. No. 28
D.S.I.R. Building Research) over the
majority of the floor area when the
doors were in the closed position.
The roof, except where glazing oc'
curred, was to be covered with alu'
minium decking, possessing a thermal
insulation value of .35 B.Th.U./hr. c F./
sq. ft.
In order to guard against accidental
damage, an Bft. high dado wall was to
be constructed in brickwork. This
was surmounted by a 10ft. deep
stretch of vertical glazing and the re-
maining wall was formed of 20 S.W.G.
corrugated aluminium sheet.
Loading Conditions.
The hangar was designed for the
following specified loading conditions
in addition to the dead loads: —
LOADING A:
Superimposed Load (deemed to in'
elude snow) = 15 ,lbr./sq. ft. on
plan.
Superimposed Load (deemed to in'
elude lighting and heating ser'
vices, etc) = 2 Ib./sq. ft. on plan.
LOADING B, C, and D:
Wind Load. The unit wind pressure
p = 25 Ib./sq. ft.
LOADING B:
An external wind pressure equal to
p normal to the full area of vertical
surfaces. In the case of main frames
and bracing, this pressure was taken
equally between the windward and lee'
ward faces.
LOADING C:
An external wind suction equal to
p over half the length of the roof
frbm the windward edge and .5p over
the remaining half excepting that
when the main doors are open to
windward ,5p suction* is taken over the
whole roof.
LOADING D:
An internal wind pressure of .5p on
all surfaces when the main doors are
open to windward and an internal
wind suction of ,5p when the doors
are open to leeward or parallel with
the wind direction.
Combination of Loading.
Generally (i) A
Doors Closed (ii) A+B-f-C
„ „ (ui) B-j-C
Doors Open (iv) A+B+C-f-D
„ (v) B+C+D.
Each of the above conditions was
to include thermal stresses due to a
temperature range of ±45°F.
At the time of tendering, the “Re'
port on the Structural Use of Alu'
minium Alloys in Buildings” had not
been published by this Institution.
No other authoritative code being
available, the working stresses and
standards of construction were recon'
ciled with 855449: Use of Structural
Steel in Building.
Bearing and shearing values of rivets
and bolts were ascertained by testing
sample specimens, and in each case a
factor of safety of 3 was used. This
resulted in the following stresses:—
Permissible shear stress in NES
rivets, 3.33 tons/sq.in.
Permissible shear strees in Black
bolts, 4 tons/sq. in.
Permissible bearing stress in HE 10
WP, 10.8 tons/ sq. in.
In the case of the base castings the
factors of safety were increased to 3.75
based on the ultimate stress.
Design.
In view of the urgent need for this
hangar, three weeks were allowed for
the design and preparation of the ten'
der. Consequently, the general de'
tails had to be decided quickly in order
to obtain quotations from specialist
firms for the roof decking, glazing and
lining and arrangements demanding
lengthy stress analysis were promptly
ruled out. After considering various
schemes, it was decided to use two
pinned portal frames spanning parallel
to the door as principals, thus making
each bay structurally independent.
With this arrangement the depth of
the portal frame leg provided sufficient
width to house the doors in the open
position. Each bay was structurally
independent.
Attention was then given to glazing
and it was found that the 10ft. stretch
of glazing on the lower roof slopes
together with the 17ft. wide deck
light and the 10ft. deep wall glazing
gave the requisite daylight factor over
most of the floor, excepting that part
immediately adjacent the doors. By
the addition of the smaller deck light
at the front of the building, the factor
was increased to the required amount.
The remainder of the roof is cover'
ed with aluminium decking. In prim
ciple, this consists of an 18 SWG cor'
rugated sheet, the corrugations being
spaced 6in. apart and 2|in. deep. A
sheet of insulation board spanning be'
tween the corrugations provides a base
for the bituminous felt covering which,
together with the insulation board, is
bonded with hot bitumen. The deck'
ing is clipped to the purlin, clips
being on alternate sides to stabilise
the purlin flange. The weight of the
decking is 4 Ib./sq. ft. and it possesses
a thermal insulation (U) value of .33
BTU’s/hr./°F./sq. ft.
Building board manufacturers were
contacted in an effort to obtain a
material which would comply with the
lining specification. No single board
possessed all the required properties
and so it was decided to use a £in.
thick cementitious asbestos board in
conjunction with corrugated aluminium
foil insulation. The foil was first
stapled to the lining, the whole being
panelled in aluminium sections, which
were clipped to the sheeting rails.
It was decided to employ six frames
equally spaced at 22ft. centres within
the depth of the building. First
thoughts were to design the purlins as
latticed girders, but this scheme was
rejected in favour of supporting the
purlins at quarter points by struts
springing from the inner boom of the
main frame. A longitudinal tie was
incorporated to transmit out of balance
loads to the end bays, which, being
34

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


fully latticed, were capable of absorb'
ing these loads.
The actual spans of the portal frame
was dictated largely by the doors,
which, in their parked position, occupy
a distance of 12ft. 6in. at each side
of the clear opening. A nominal
clearance of 6in. between frames ac-
counts for the dimension of 149 ft.
centres of outer legs. The extreme
20ft. of each roof slope was pitched
at 19° to facilitate the incorporation
of normal patent glazing, the remain-
der of the roof being at 11° and
3.5° pitch.
In the light of little experience of
the expansion of aluminium structures
of this magnitude the problem was
solved by designing each bay as an in-
dependent structure. An expansion
joint is also provided in the sheeting
and glazing in the centre of the side
and gable walls in addition to a joint
in the roof decking.
Foundations.
The foundations are constructed of
normal reinforced concrete and the
unusual feature is that they were de-
signed to hold the hangar down as
opposed to holding it up. The larger
type of foundation is designed to cater
for an uplift of 75 tons and consists
of a turee-foot slab of reinforced con-
crete 23ft. long by 14ft. wide, the
underside of which is sft. below floor
level. A four-foot square core of
reinforced concrete projects from the
centre of the slab to floor level and
contains a well to accommodate the
base casting. Mass concrete over the
remaining area provides additional
dead weight.
Fabrication.
The first stage in the fabrication
was to set out the structure on the
lofting floor, and the templates were
made from the actual sections to be
used, these being finally incorporated
in the structure. The incoming mate-
rial was cut to length on high-speed
saws, following which pilot holes, gene-
rally -gin. less in diameter than the
finished hole, were drilled. Batten
plates were pre-punched and riveted to
the main members in standard jigs,
following which the gusset plates were
riveted to the main booms and finally
the internal members riveted on.
All the rivets were cold driven
closed, a 25-ton pneumatic squeeze
riveting machine being used for fin.
rivets and a similar machine of 9-ton
capacity used for fin. diameter rivets.
The portal frames were made in as
long lengths as possible, the sizes
being limited to those which could be
conveyed to site on a 60ft. low loader.
Each complete frame was temporarily
shop-assembled and holes for fitted
bolts reamed to ensure a good fit on
erection. The completed sections were
manoeuvred with the aid of an avail-
able four-ton electric overhead travel-
ling crane although, if necessary, they
could have been man-handled.
Upon arrival at site the heavier
components were off-loaded with the
aid of a 3-ton 30ft. jib crane. Two
halves of adjacent portal frames were
assembled side-by-side, the feet of the
frames being connected to the hinged
bases and the apices resting on the
concrete floor slab. After the purlins,
ties, etc., had been fixed, a rope was
secured to connect the eaves to a three-
ton winch situated about 75 yards out-
side the bases. A load applied by the
winch then raised the portal frames,
pivoted about their base pins, into
position.
Speedy Construction.
The hangar, which, despite a very
wet winter, was completed within the
period of a year, is an outstanding
example of the use of aluminium in
buildings. Apart from the structure,
aluminium has been used in the roof
decking, wall sheeting and glazing, in
addition to forming the insulation for
the walls. The doors, had they been
constructed in any other material,
would have been unwieldly.
This hangar is the forerunner of
several which are, or are due to be,
elected in various parts of the country,
and it seems that the future of alu-
minium aircraft hangars is assured.

Motels For Car
Travellers
Amazing Growth in America.
Ideal For Australia.
Public attention has been focused on
the American motel system by the
General Secretary of the Victorian
Automotive Chamber of Commerce,
Mr. H. A. Allibon, who returned re'
cently from a seven-months world
tour convinced that the American mo'
tel was the answer to poor facilities
provided for car travellers in Aus-.
tralia.
“America has thousands of these
places,” Mr. Allibon said, “and all
give a grand service.” He quoted one
motel at Houston, Texas, which, he
said, had 152 flats in blocks of four
each and equipped with gas, electricity,
central heating, and covered garage.
Figures concerning the ever-grow-
ing extent of the motel system in
America are truly remarkable. It is
estimated that during 1953, 20 motels
were completed daily or almost double
the number in the previous year.
20.000. Holiday Makers.
This state of affairs is attributed to
the fact that in America twenty mil-
lion people now take their holidays by
car and in addition are always abroad
at week-ends. Approximately ten mil-
lion of these travellers with their fam-
ilies regularly patronise the roadside
chalets, where they can park their car
almost at their bedside and make a
prompt start next morning.
San Luis Obispo, in California, was
the scene of the construction of the
first American motel —in 1925. When
the last war began approximately
15.000 had been established. Most of
these were primitive places where two
persons could stay for the night at a
cost of as little as two dollars or less.
Since the war ended, however, increas-
ed earnings by the people, as reflect-
ed, among other things, by a great
increase in motor car purchases, have
resulted in a boom in motel construc-
tion. In 1948 they numbered about
25.000 and during the past five years
this total has doubled, with new places
appearing along every major highway.
It is estimated that there are nearly
10.000 motels in California and 5,000
in Florida, but they are a feature of
every State’s accommodation facilities.
And as there are approximately 20
chalets to each motel, there are some
1.000. units in the country.
In the aggregate the motels repre-
sent an investment of 6,000 million
dollars, and the gross revenue last year
is estimated at well over 1,500 million
dollars. Of course, in recent years
construction has been on a bigger
ASPECTS OF SYDNEY'S WATER SUPPLY.
The January, 1954, issue of the Sydney Water Board Journal contains two articles
of particular interest. The first deals with the history of the water supply of Parra-
matta and is illustrated by two familiar landmarks of this ancient city: old Govern-
ment House, now the Preparatory School of The Kings School, with its serene and
charming Georgian facade (top) and below it the equally admired Lennox Bridge.
The two lower illustrations are from an article on the external protection of water
mains by means of "gunite" coating by cement mortar being sprayed on under
pressure. A reinforcing mesh is used on the larger pipes to prevent the cement
coating breaking away

and even better basis with every com-
fort and such luxuries as tiled bath-
rooms, air conditioning, valet service,
baby sitters and even dog kennels.
The average investment is now ap-
proximately 130,000 dollars, while
some luxury motels in the South and
South-West have cost between 500,000
and 1,000,000 dollars.
A New Factor.
During the past year anew factor
has developed, there being at least two
schemes under way to establish nation-
wide chains of luxury motels bearing
the same brand name and maintaining
uniform standards. Tourinns Inc., of
New York City, proposes to build 60
super motels on the outskirts of as
many major U.S. cities at a cost of
half a million dollars each —a total
outlay of 30 million dollars. Several
have already been built, including
Pittsburgh and Allentown, Pennsyl-
vania; Wilmington, Delaware: and
Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Hotels Challenged.
The introduction of the motel, of
course, has provided a challenge to
the hotels, some of which have re-
acted by building their own motels on
city outskirts. Also of concern to the
hotel keepers is the fact that ninety
per cent, of motels are open all the
year round instead of only during the
vacation months when motor holiday-
ing is at its highest. It is also claim-
ed that 60 per cent, of motel guests
on a year round basis are business tra-
vellers.
Despite the increase in motor hotel
standards, they still cost less to build
on an average than a modern hotel,
and if occupancy can be maintained at
about 70 per cent, a fair profit is
made. It is stated that some motels
cnjoving a higher occupancy rate are
paying for themselves within as little
as three to five years.
Australia’s Scope.
Clearly, with its population fast ap-
proaching the 10,000,000 mark and a
certain continued rapid growth by mi-
gration, Australia must sooner or later
enter the motel business on a by no
means meagre scale. No country is
more suited to holidaying by motor
car than is Australia, with its far flung
distances, wide open spaces and tour-
ist attractions of multitudinous variety.
Its hotel provision, both city and along
the country highways, is sadly lacking
in the facilities which the motels of
America have set out to supply. More
and more, and not the least among
Asian countries, is the call of Austra-
lia as a car-holiday resort making it-
self felt.
In this respect it is of special im-
portance that American capital is so
greatly interested in Australia at the
present time. Might we suggest that
here is a field worthy of investigation
by our American friends? This do-
main is practically 100 per cent, un-
explored and, we suggest, should of-
fer scope on a grand scale for a sur-
vey on the practicability of putting
capital into an extension to Australia
of an institution that is proving a boon
to millions of people in the United
States.

ULTRA-VIOLET RADIATION
Ultra-violet radiation has injurious
effect on many plastics and causes a
breakdown of the structure of the
atoms. At room temperature the plas-
tic polythene frequently used for H.F.
electrical work is a crystalline sub-
stance but at 80 deg. C. it tends to
creep and will dissolve in many or-
granic compounds beyond the range
of its crystalline structure. Polythene
fluoreses under ultra-violet rays and
changes its structure. This is one of
the causes of failure experienced in
poly-vinyl insulations used for elec-
trical work.

Trucking Facility Speeds Pier Cargo
New Pierside Terminal Expedites New York Truck-borne Sea Commerce.
(From our New York Correspondent)
The difficult problem of truck load-
ing has been largely brought under
control by the Holland-America Line
at its new Hoboken terminal. The
Holland-America Line bought its
piers a few years ago after many dec-
ades of paying rent, and by modern-
ising them made room for the grow-
ing truck-borne sea commerce.
Cargo moves in and out of the
terminal in hundreds of thousands of
tons annually in shipments of every
kind and size, ranging from small par-
cels to cabin cruisers. Reception and
delivery at the pier is by truck, rail-
road car and lighter. Last year
trucks were carrying 60 per cent, o
the business, lighters 30 per cent, and
the railroads 10 per cent.
Door-to-Door Delivery.
The growing success of trucking
since the war has been due, most of
all, to the fact that it allows door-to-
door delivery. Of major importance
to the shipper and consignee is the dis-
patch with which all functions are per-
formed. Congestion and idleness are
expensive. The ease with which light-
ers and railroad cars are handled at
the terminal is well known. New,
however, is the arrangement for the
quick handling of trucks.
Trucks of all sorts and sizes visit
the pier at the rate of a thousand a
month. Many of them are thirty-two-
foot-long giants—forty-four feet with
their “horses.” The Holland-America
platform can accommodate eleven to
fourteen trucks, and twenty men can
be worked in the yard nearby.
The approaches to the terminal are
wide, roomy and on company-owned
property. Thus, costly waiting time
is minimised; unloading on exposed
public thoroughfares avoided; and
excruciating manoeuvres inside a con-
gested shed unnecessary. Goods are
unloaded under cover in all weathers
and conveyed to shipside immediately.
The line has to arrange for the re-
moval of cargo long before a ship
touches port and consignees are noti-
fied when to pick up their cargoes.
“A ship is a vertical store,” said Mr.
van der Werff, operating manager of
the line. You can’t just go in and
grab off an item that you want at any
time. You have to dig around to get
at it.”
How the Platform Works.
A truck driver may have only a
portion of his load for delivery to the
Holland-America Line. His major
concern is to dispose of it as quickly
as possible. Upon arrival at Hoboken
he produces his manifest to the chief
of the receiving department, just in-
side the main gate. Here the ship-
ment is processed according to vessel,
destination and stowage requirements.
The driver then reports to the plat-
form chief who assigns him a check-
er. A pallet board is placed at the
rear of the truck on which the driver
puts his load. A forklift truck then
sidles up and whisks it away. The
driver gets his receipt and the trailer
leaves the platform.
The .complex nature of the steam-
ship business is evidenced by the fact
that movements of the forklift are
governed by what is to happen to its
load in the next couple of weeks.
Each piece of freight receives its as-
signed place both on the pier and in
the vessel in which it is to travel.
This in turn depends on its character.
Chemicals, for example, are kept well
away from foodstuffs at all times.
Tea, coffee and other sensitive cargoes
are stowed far from paint, salted hides,
onions or similar products.
Destination is a factor in loading—-
first in is last out. Not everything
can be put on top, “top stow,” and
for that reason a lot of co-operation
is needed between stevedores, chief
mates and cargo surveyors from the
insurance companies who ascertain
that everything is stowed in good
order.
Large shipments often have several
consignees and must be kept separate
as to lot number. Some items must
be kept aside for inspection by ship-
pers or buyers before loading. Re-
frigerator and valuable cargo go
aboard at once to their special loca-
tions. Nothing is left to chance.
When a ship finally pulls out her holds
are like a jigsaw puzzle that has been
successfully assembled from a seeming-
ly hopeless tangle.

was supposed to consolidate ticket of'
' flees and to centralise airport bus ser'
I vice, but the tremendous increase of
| air traffic, estimated this year to be
nearly seven million passengers at the
airports serving New York City, soon
outgrew the building and airlines were
forced to continue to use separate tick'

inal is able to accommodate about 7000
passengers a day and the great big
buses that carry them. It was con'
structed by the Triborough Bridge
and Tunnel Authority as a public ser'
vice to relieve traffic congestion on city
streets caused by airline buses. The
new terminal is located on the north
side of the Manhattan plaza of the
Queens Midtown Tunnel.
It will be the point of arrival and
departure of all airline buses serving
International and LaGuardia Airports
and, until another terminal is erected
on the west side of Manhattan, it will
also handle Newark Airport traffic.
The total cost of the entire building
and land is approximately $7,500,000.
Skilful Planning.
The terminal building consists of a
street level storage and maintenance
garage for the airline bases, a main
floor with a large central public wait'
ing room surrounded by airlines tick'
et counters and loading and unloading
space for buses, and’ a mezzanine con'
taining a public waiting room and
ticket counters of the foreign flag lines
and general offices. The roof, reach'
ed by ramp at the north-west corner
of the building, is a public parking
place with a capacity of almost 300
cars.
The greater part of the ground floor
is occupied by a storage and mainten-
ance garage for airline buses. Within
this area buses will be stored when not
in transit, washed, repaired and servic-
ed with gasoline and oil.
The main floor of the terminal con-
taining the public waiting room, the
ticket offices of the domestic airlines,
and bus loading docks, is reached by
escalators from the taxi and pedestrian
arcade and from another arcaded taxi
driveway. An impressive public ro-
tunda occupies 18,000 square feet in
the central part of the building. The
waiting room is surrounded by 500
feet of ticket counters and the baggage
rooms of the domestic airlines which
open directly to the bus loading plat'
form.
A horseshoe shaped roadway at this
level with 15 parking docks wholly
within the building surrounds the
waiting room, ticket offices and bag'
gage room and provides off-street
loading and unloading space for bus
passengers.
Ten domestic air lines and ten for'
eign flag airlines use the East Side
Airlines Terminal.
Result of Co-operation.
The terminal is the result of coop-
eration between New York City and
the airlines. It was built and is own-
ed by the Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority, and is leased in its
entirety for twenty years by the East
Side Airlines Terminal Corporation, a
newlyTormed corporation owned by
the ten major domestic airlines oper'
ating out of metropolitan New York.
The corporation in turn leases space
to the individual lines.
At present the airport buses will
have to continue to use some second'
ary highways since parts of the routes
are under construction. Part of the
new Queens Midtown Expressway has
been completed. The final route to
La Guardia Airport will be by way of
the Queens Midtown Expressway and
Brooklyn'Qucens'Expressway. The en-
ture cost of this work is being paid by
the City of New York with exception
of a $22,200,000 part which is being
paid by the Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority.
London Airport A
Lesson in Tidy
Efficiency
Nearly 3000 acres of airfield, Lon*
don airport is soon to become, if not
already there, the world’s largest air-
port. The structures will have cost
■£3£ million (sterling £A1,568,000) by
early 1956. The control tower will be
122 i feet high and will control the
movements of vehicular traffic as well
as airplanes.
The chief traffic artery from outside
to the terminal area is through a
tunnel 2000 feet long by 86 feet wide
with two separate roadways. Its plan'
ning was not only one of architectural
problems, it was a town'planning prob'
lem, and will be a lesson to the world
in tidy efficiency on a big scale.
The total cost of the airport to the
Ministry of Civil Aviation will have
reached £2l million before it is com'
plcted in 1956.

British Firms Builds 1000 Houses In 1953
A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT.
One thousand homes completed and
handed over during 1953 is the
achievement of Gee, Walker and Slat-
er, Ltd., contractors, at the 605-acre
L.C.C. housing estate, Boreham
Wood. The I,oooth house in 1953
has a double significance, for it is also
the 2,000 th completed since building
operations began in March, 1950.
The fact that the sites for develop-
ment were approximately two miles
apart made certain difficulties in con-
tinuity of construction, but neverthe-
less 2,026 houses have been complet-
ed and handed over to date. There
are approximately seven basic types
each with many variations to suit sit-
ing, architectural features and aspect.
The types range from old people’s
dwellings of combined living-room and
bedroom to the higher rented house
type of two reception with three or
four bedrooms. Some types are semi-
detached, others in blocks of four,
six, eight or twelve. Shopping centres
are easily accessible and cinemas.
churches and refreshment houses
planned.
Extensive Site Development.
All the land for the estate was en-
tirely undeveloped, and it was a ne-
cessary provision, before any houses
could be erected in bulk, to provide
the normal site development. 13*
miles of roadways were laid, 23 miles
of public and semi-public pathways,
22 miles of kerbs and miles of
sewer pipe of 6in. to 36in. diameter,
also 20 miles of cables with 520 street
lamps. The building of 2,500 houses
shops, flats, maisonnettes, etc., pro-
ceeded concurrently with this devel-
opment.
38,000,000 Bricks.
Over thirty-eight million bricks,
30,000 tons of cement were used and
new techniques were developed in the
building of the estate. A particular
feature is that practically the whole
of the joinery work for the estate was
constructed in the contractors’ own
shops. An interesting feature was the
crane and skip method of pouring
No-fines mix for the construction of
non-traditional houses, by which means
the entire construction of the whole
of the external walls of one house was
completed in four days.
In the early stages of the work the
contractors were faced with a short-
age of labour. After recruiting locally
every available building worker and
those who could be adapted as such,
they began to recruit all over England
and in some cases Ireland until event-
ually a satisfactory labour force was
built up. A hostel was opened in
Boreham Wood which housed nearly
200 and which catered for 11 different
nationalities.
At the peak of activities, some 1200
operatives were employed and a fleet
of double-deck buses was maintained
by the contractors to convey them
from various centres to and from their
work daily.

Armitage Pottery
Works, England
“Coronation Kiln” Inaugurated.
The completion of a major recon'
struction scheme at the world famed
Armitage sanitary pottery works of
Edward Johns & Co. was recognised
recently when the Lord Lieutenant of
Staffordshire (Mr. H. Wallace'Cop'
land) opened new general offices and
inaugurated the third continuous kiln,
appropriately called “The Coronation
Kiln.”
It was stated that since the end of
the Second World War the company’s
exports had earned no less than
£2,000,000 sterling for the country.
First Kiln Built in 1817.
It is noteworthy to recall that just
because a brickmaker wished to ex'
pand his activities the name of the
village of Armitage, almost in the
centre of England, has become the
home of a make or brand of sanitary
pottery now well-known in most
countries the world over.
It was there in 1817 that Thomas
Bond, a maker of bricks, decided to
manufacture earthenware or pottery
and he built a kiln. His ambitions
were of short duration, however, for
in 1819 he was adjudged bankrupt,
having overstrained his limited re-
sources.
The history of the site is some-
what obscure during the period of 30
to 35 years from 1819 but there were
undoubtedly two potteries functioning.
“Armitage Old Pottery.”
“Armitage Old Pottery,” however,
still remained and about 1851 it was
THE ONE AND ONLY PETTICOAT LANE
LONDON'S UNIQUE SPECTACLE.
The most famous of London's street markets is Petticoat Lane. For six days of the
week Petticoat Lane does the disappearing act and goes by the name of Middlesex
Street, one of London's narrower lanes, running from Whitechapel High Street
to Bishopgate. During this period there is nothing to distinguish it from hundreds
of other obscure London streets. But on a Sunday Middlesex Street disappears and
Petticoat Lane in all its glory takes over, and it is a wonderful show. Apart from
the bargains to be made and the bustling crowd there are the side-shows. Crowds
from all over London come to find a bargain, companionship, and a laugh

taken over by Salt and Swan. It was
in 1867 that a notable change took
place when the pottery was purchased
by the Rev. Edward Johns, an auc'
tioneer and Congregational minister
from Rugeley and during the latter
half of the 19th century, the pottery
made progress and created a reputa'
tion for the excellence of its craftsman'
ship, which was carried on by his son
Mr. Edward William Lewis Johns after
the death of his father in 1893.
The increasing demand for that new
product of sanitary earthenware came
along with the development of the
modern system of waterborne sanita'
tion and the Armitage pottery
strengthened its position. In 1900
Mr. E. L. W. Johns decided to sell
the business and in 1900 Mr. Edmund
R. Corn took charge of the Armitage
pottery, Mr. Alfred H. Corn remain'
ing at the North Staffordshire factory,
which concern eventually became
known as Richards Tiles Ltd., now the
largest manufacturers of ceramic wall
and floor tile in the world.
From 1900 onwards under Mr. Ed'
mund Corn's capable direction the At'
mitage pottery rapidly established it'
self as one of the important manufac'
turers of sanitary earthenware in that
comparatively new section of the pot'
tery industry.
Post-War Reconstruction.
In 1947 foundations were laid and
the extensive reconstruction of the
factory commenced on a long term
plan. January, 1949, saw the “light'
ing’’ of No. 1 continuous kiln, the op'
eration of which radically altered the
method of “burning’’ or “firing’’ clay-
ware and which made possible not
only an even and better product, but
greatly improved working conditions
for the operatives.
It is interesting to mention that
this kiln is probably the first of this
large size to be built in Britain on the
first floor, for just over three-quart'
ers of its length is “upstairs.” A sec'
ond continuous kiln was put into op'
eration in February, 1950, and the
third was completed in 1953.
Further stages of reconstruction are
in hand, but with the completion of
the major part, the Armitage Sani'
tary Pottery, now occupying some
twenty acres, is placed in a sound trad'
ing position, employing the most mod'
ern manufacturing methods and pro-
viding clean, ventilated and comfort'
able working conditions, such that it
may modestly be said compares fa'
vourably with any factory in the in'
dustry anywhere.

SUMMER TEMPERATURES
IN BUILDINGS.
Building Station’s Investigations.
The design of buildings for human
habitation in hot climates presents
many problems which are being stud-
ied by research scientists, architects
and engineers in most countries of
the world.
During the past four years the Com'
monwealth Experimental Building Sta'
tion has been carrying on experiment'
al work with the primary purpose of
improving the thermal behaviour of
timber framed construction for service
in inland districts and also to provide
practical guidance for the reduction of
indoor temperatures during hot sum'
mer days.
The Station has studied the effeo
tiveness of: Roof space ventilation;
Shading and insulating of sunlit walls
and of roof claddings: Light external
colours for walls and roofs; Natural
ventilation, when used in conjunction
or by themselves in the construction
of a building.
A concise account of the Station’s
investigations since March, 1950, has
been issued in Special Report No. 11

scenic distraction and one's physical awareness of the players leads to a natural

The Royal Visit Arches of Sydney
REMARKABLE STRENGTH OF PLYWOOD.
By MALCOLM S. STANLEY, M.C., M.I.E.(Aust.).
A striking part of Sydney’s decora-
tions for the historic visit of Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth 11. and
H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh were
the great arches that gracefully span-
ned some of Sydney’s main thorough-
fares.
Although they are now but a mem-
ory, being whisked away in the night
as dramatically as they were created,
their conception, construction and
erection called for so much thought,
skill and ingenuity on the part of their
designers and constructors, that the
story of those which relied on timber
and plywood for their being—as dis-
tinct from standard steel structural
shapes and steel tubes—is of particu-
lar interest.
Those described hereunder were
unique because they consisted of a
fabric of plywood glued to a light
internal timber strip framing. We
know that aircraft plywood was used
for the famous mosquito bomber dur-
ing the war years, but the use of ply
for structural work is of more than
passing interest, especially for struc-
tures having great spans.
Six of the ceremonial Arches were
of plywood:
(i) The Boomerang Arch, Park
Street. 96 ft. span.
(ii) The Bankers’ Arch, intersec-
tion of Pitt Street and Martin
Place. 120 ft. span.
(iii) The Retail Traders’ Arch,
Macquarie Street. 65 ft. span.
(iv) The Insurance Companies’
Arch, Macquarie Street. 72
ft. span.
(v) The Timber Development As-
sociation’s “Log Arch,” Mac-
quarie Street. 65 ft. span.
(vi) The Agricultural Society’s
Arch, Bridge Street. 71 ft.
span.
Although plywood is one of the
light weight materials! 1) and the
structures were erected only for the
period of the Royal Visit, they had of
necessity, to survive any probable wind
loadings!2). Items !l) and !2) are
intimately co-related and received
special attention, decorations suspend-
ed from the structures were also con-
sidered from the aspects of dead load-
ing vertically and wind loading later-
ally. This was particularly justified
for gusts of wind of 55-60 miles per
hour arrived with a cyclonic storm
during the brief life of the structures.
The manufacturers of all these
arches, Messrs. Ralph Symonds Ltd.,
were responsible for the fabrication and
design, using one of their products,
“Reswood Ply”. The material has a
thickness of and the assembly—
a hollow cell type—depended on glue
for continuity. The sheets were glued
to timber corner fillets and altogether
the successful use of tough plywood
glued to a light internal timber-strip
frame has been amply justified by
these unique constructions.
No Design Data Available.
Several Building Codes and official
sources were examined and interview-
ed but no positive design data exists.
In the absence of design data, the man-
ufacturers and I conducted tests for
the express purpose of determining
basic values for design purposes. The
results were astonishingly high, and
demonstrated the remarkable tough-
ness of plywood as a structural ma-
terial in relation to its light weight.
Weight for weight plywood is strong-
er than steel. The test results on full
size models of plywood amply proved
its quality, strength and efficiency, and
provided full assurance to the engin-
eer that it could be used with confi-
dence for the structures under review.
The Civic Authorities concerned with
the safety of the public properly and
critically reviewed the computations.
Glue was the sole jointing medium
—this is not a blood-albumen glue
but a product of modern chemistry.
We are moving into a new glue age,
which will bring surprising results.
A few months ago I observed a shear
test. Two strips of t?” thick steel 3”
wide x 12” long were glued together.
Instead of rivetting the strips, they
were glued. Tension loading was
transmitted through a h" bolt at each
end, the bolts tore through the steel
without failure of the glued joint. It
is quite on the cards that the steel
fabricators of tomorrow will be usingr
a form of glue in lieu of arc welding.
It sounds romantic, but it may not be
remote as we may imagine. So far
as timber joints are concerned the
glue joint is stronger than the tim-
ber. This is a fact.
Hollow Cell Structures.
In respect to design, the structures
consist of hollow cells with walls of
iV’ Reswood. Over the tables of our
cafes engineers and architects argued,
criticised and fought in friendly jousts
over the basis for design; the turmoil
certainly continued in secret behind
the closed doors of the authorities-
who control our professional destiny.
Present day design routine is due
for a revision. If we place a load on
a slab, the girders carry the load plus-
the slabs plus their own dead weight;
the columns carry the load plus the
slabs plus the girder and the dead
weight of the columns; thence to-
the footings. These carry the load
plus the slab plus the girder plus the
weight of the columns plus the dead
weight of the footing.
If we are designing a simple cor-
rugated iron covered steel structure
the steel core framing is assumed to
provide the whole of the strength;
stresses and strains are based on the
analysis of the steel-framed skeleton,
the sheet covering is regarded as re'
dundant, and neglected except as a
dead weight loading.
Strength in Stressed Skin.
For the structures of this thesis,
the antithesis was adopted, the intern-
al skeleton was neglected, and strength
was assumed to depend entirely on
the stability of the stressed skin. Corn-
er fillets and cocasional timber battens
glued to the internal walls of the cell
skins only existed to control local
buckling of the stressed skin. Thus
the problem of design became auto-
matically one of primitive simplicity.
In general the cells are rectangular
or triangular with walls of Ts” Res-
wood ply. Because I was handling a
structural material somewhat new to
the engineer, low stress intensities were
adopted. The cells were large in cross
section and high values for the mo-

ments of inertia and of gyration fob
lowed with consequently low stress
values. These were facilitated by the
low dead weight of the structures as
a whole. This suggests a new ap'
proach to structural design.
Space Frame Design.
The use of the term "Space Frame
Design” is creeping into our structural
literature and this modern note de-
serves serious attention by our design'
ers. Our application of the art to
these ceremonial arches was thorough'
ly tested by the cyclonic gales which
passed over Sydney during the brief
life of the structures.
The following brief records, shall
we say for history, of these various
unique structures.
(i) The Boomerang Arch.
Consisting of four main members
each 64 ft. in length (hollow rect'
angular cross section from tip to tip)
shaped like boomerangs and meeting
in a hinge at the crown. The inde'
pendent footings were 14 ft. apart on
the footpaths, the spans 96 ft, the
height of the hinge above the road'
way 31 ft. 6 in. The main members
shaped in profile like a boomerang
were hollow rectangular cells in.
wide and of varying depth, being a
maximum, viz., 70” at the bend of the
member. The plywood skins were
glued to internal corner fillets with oc-
casional 2” x 1” battens glued to the
internal walls. The covering material
was ply.
Regarded as a skin stressed mem'
her it may be of interest that the hob
low cell 70” x 9.5” has a moment of
inertia value of 27,450 in. 4 (neglect'
ing any internal framings). This im'
mediately suggests inherent possibilb
ties with great strengths associated
with low stress intensities, the latter
under vertical loadings being a maxi'
mum of 40 lb. per sq. inch —absurdly
low. The total dead weight of the
structure was less than two tons. Lat'
eral wind loading (assumed 20 lb.
per sq. ft.) acted against the minor
axis of the members, bracing and guys
were erected as a precaution; the
former were hidden between the
frames and the latter were attached
to convenient electric light poles.
Later the structure was transported by
road to Melbourne, and was hailed by
the local press as being a unique con'
tribution to that city’s decorations.
It was designed by Beauvais Assocb
ates Ptv. Ltd., Sydney.
(ii) The Bankers' Arch.
This beautiful and dignified struc'
ture was designed by Mr. G. C. G.
Neave, A.R.A.I.A. It was a brillb
antly conceived idea which should
be permanently recorded in the
history of "Structures of Austra'
lia.” The span between the spring'
ings was 120’ and the four main mem'
bers intersecting in a crown hinge
were triangular hollow cells in cross
section, tapering from the springing
to the crown; the curve was para'
bolic. It was a “pure'brcd plywood”
structure and for the first time in my
experience the whole of the wind and
dead loadings and stresses —for a span
of this dimension —were adequately
carried by three strips of thin tV’
plywood.
The tapering sides of the hollow
cells were assembled to form an equb
lateral triangle in cross section glued
to corner strips or fillets with longitud'
inal internal battens glued to the in-
ternal skins, with occasional dia'
phragms spaced for larger portions of
the members. At the springings
(40’ above the pavement) the sides
of the triangular cell were 60”, tap'
ering to 24” at the crown. At the
60” cross section the moment of in'
erita was 69745 in. 4 at the gravity
axis. At the 24” cross section the
moment of inertia was 17100 in. 4 at
the gravity axis. These physical char'
acteristics reflect great possibilities.
Preliminary tests on triangular hob
low cells with 30” sides dispelled any
doubts regarding the stability of the
completed structure. Probable wind
loadings—which did eventuate -were
easily met by the erection of light
steel cables. The height of the orna'
mental crown above the pavement
was 92’.

(iii) Retail Traders' Arch.
Macquarie Street.
This exceptional structure consisted
entirely of i%” Reswood and glue.
The cross girder 65’ span was a hob
low triangle in cross section, 30’ wide
on the upper face, the depth from
upper flange or face to the lower apex
of the triangular section being 6’6”,
giving a 16’6” clearance for traffic.
This triangular girder at the ends rest'
ed on pylons, the latter being 65’
from centre to centre. A wind load
of 20 lb. per square foot formed the
basis for design. To resist overturn'
ing each pylon contained 20 tons of
bricks; these were neatly hidden be'
hind the low plywood walls forming
a surround. Some measure of the in'
ertia moment values may be of in'
terest:
(i) hollow plywood cell pylons
6’ wide x 13’ deep I =
422000 in. 4
(ii) hollow triangular cell girder
30’ wide x 6‘6” deep I =
125050 in. 4
Physical characteristics of this mag'
nitude result in stress values of an ex'
traordinarily low order. Later a mo-
tor crane jib collided with the soffit
of the girder, without appreciable
damage. It was designed by Mr. C.
S. R. Garth, A.R.A.1.A., Director of
Parks, Sydney City Council.
(iv) The Insurance Companies’
Arch.
From an architectural point of
view this was a real joy, but from an
engineer’s outlook—a perplexity. The
main members intersected and then
continued to a pair of hinged
joints at the crowns from which a
royal crown was suspended. This arch
was close to the entrance of Govern'
ment House in Macquarie Street and
at night the lighting left nothing to
be desired.
The springings or bases were 30’
apart on the footpaths and the spans
across Macquarie Street 72’; height
to the hinges was 46’. Wind loadings
formed the basic problem; ultimately
we were satisfied to eliminate guys.
The main members consisted of glued
laminated timber cores 24” deep x
4” wide, clothed with plywood to
produce a shape triangular in cross
section. The exterior was finished
to produce a scintillating effect under
night lighting. Messrs. Stephenson 6?
Turner, Architects, were responsible
for this design.
(v) The Timber Development
Association’s “Arch”.
The idea behind this ambitious con'
ception was to produce and rotate a
log 8’ in diameter high above Mac'
quarie Street. It must have succeed'
ed for reports are that a bushman in'
formed a traffic policeman “he had
helped to fell the tree from which the
log was cut.”
The pylons rested on the footpaths
and were loaded to resist overturning
by wind; roller bearings were built
into the pylons, and steel flats were
bent round the “log” to form tracks
at 65’ centres, which permitted rota'
tion of the “log.” A quarter h.p. elec'
trie motor supplied the power.
Weight of the log was about 3 tons.
Total length, 72’.
The crown decoration was support'
ed by a frame resting on roller bear'
ings and was loaded with a counter'
weight (covered by decoration), thus
permitting the log to rotate whilst the
crown remained stationary and vertb
cal. The “log” was painted to re-
semble an Angophora Lanceolata.
The pylons were finished with beau'
tiful specimens of plywood veneers.
My interest was concentrated on the
“log”; it was 8’ in diameter. The
internal framings, 2” wide, were dr'
cular wheels in form and spaced at
intervals of 3’ along the length of the
log; around their circumference were
rebated slots at approximately 18”
centres to take 2” x 2” battens. These
ran longitudinally from end to end of
the “log.” The 2” battens and the
2” faces of the circular diaphragms
provided the glue base lines, i.e., lon'
gitudinal and circumferential —to
which the i%” Reswood sheets were
glued, light 1” tacks were used at 2”
intervals to hold the sheets in place
until the glue set. The final basic
structure was a tube of tV’ plywood
8’ dia. and 72’ in length.

hollow cylinder of plywood should be
even capable of taking its own load

leaving out the loadings from wind
seemed positively absurd, so arrange-
ments were made to test it. Three
one-ton loads were applied over the
middle third of the span length. The
test attracted the interest of engineers,
and to our surprise the deflection at
mid-span was 7/10000ths of the span
or i 9 s of an inch. Officers of the City
Council and I took the readings. For
purposes of calculation the internal
framings were neglected and I treated
the ’log” as a skin stressed cylindrical
member. The result was completely
justified by this routine.
(vi) Agricultural Societies’
Arch —Bridge Street.
This arch had a span of 71’ outside
to outside of the pylons. This struc-
ture was actually a portal frame with
an arched cross member, the height
of the arch at mid-point being 33’.
The structure was completely cov-
ered with excellent decorations de-
picting the fruits and vegetables of
New South Wales, not forgetting the
farmyard rooster. The weight of the
decoration approximated two tons.
Luminous paint was used and infra
red lamps installed, and the structure
looked its best at night.
The only structural material used
was “Reswood” ply, assembled as
hollow cells. The pylons 6’ x 5’ were
of hollow cellular construction, and
the plywood was glued to corner fill'
ets with occasional framings and lon-
gitudinal 2” x 1” fillets.
Wind loading—2o lb. per square
foot. This was especially investigated
as a lateral loading. Guys were erect'
ed as a precaution and the pylons were
each loaded with nine tons of bricks.
The stress intensities under vertical
loading varied from 130 p.s.i. to 220
p.s.i., which was well inside the work-
ing stress for plywood.
Mr. R. Tennant, of the Royal Agri-
cultural Society, is to be congrat-
ulated on a fine job of work.
In Conclusion.
The writer records with pleasure
his association with the Acting City
Engineer, Mr. R. Stephenson and Mr.
John Rankin, City Building Surveyor
and his staff, who used every art
known to the engineer to ensure that
these “temporary structures” should
be stable, surrounded as they would
be by dense crowds of citizens. Critics
could point to weaknesses in the math-
ematical analysis—l would be one of
the first to acknowledge these claims,
but emphasise the need for research
into the strength characteristics of this
unknown and unacknowledged tough
material. Whatever our shortcomings
might be; whatever routine of analysis
we propagated we have been complete-
ly justified by the behaviour of the
completed structures, for under cyclon-
ic conditions they showed no sign of
strain. Some of the six arches may
have been sheltered by surrounding
structures. Others, like the “Boomer'
angs” and the “Bankers’ Arch” were
exposed to the full weight of the
storm.
The fabrication of the six structures
by Ralph Symonds 6? Co. Ltd. had
been practically completed before I
was consulted, and any modifications
(which an engineer simply has to
make to justify his existence) were
of a minor character. Ralph Symonds
& Co. have presented a new struct'
ural material —in the form of full siz'
ed structures —to the engineer for
study. Mr. Symonds is to be com'
mended for his initiative and compli'
mented on the 100 per cent, success.
The writer shares the honour of as-
sociation with these outstanding—now
historical —structures.
They were fabricated and erected
by Mr. Symonds despite a tolerant
opposition. Tennyson inspires the
urge to write —
“Mors acerba fama perpetua”*
Critics to right of him.
Censors to left of him.
Experts behind him

Australian Institute
of Builders
N.S.W. Chapter
£50,000 Federal Headquarters at
North Sydney.
There was a large attendance of
members and visitors at the general
meeting of the N.S.W. Chapter, Aus-
tralian Institute of Builders, which was
held on March 19, at the Sydney Tech'
nical College Theatrette.
The Chapter Presi dent. Mr.
Charles F. Gage, occupied the Chair,
with the Treasurer, Mr. Austin W.
Edwards, and the Secretary, Mr. J. A.
Benson, in attendance.
New Headquarters.
During the course of the meeting,
the President informed members that
considerable progress had been made
regarding the establishment of a per'
manent headquarters for the Austra'
lian Institute of Builders in Sydney.
Mr. Gage said that a property in Ah
bert St., North Sydney, has been select'
ed as the site of a new £50,000 build'
ing to be erected by the Chapter.
The necessary finance is now avail'
able, and plans and specifications.
prepared by Mr. E. W. Andrew,
architect, have been approved.
A coloured drawing of the new
headquarters was shown to members,
who were very favourably impressed
with the overall concept of the pro'
ject.
The building, which has its front'
age to Albert Street, will present a
modern three'Storey aspect, and will
be two storeys in height in the rear,
owing to the fall of the site.
The Assembly Hall will seat 250,
and the building will also provide
space for a library, committee room,
and all offices and amenities.
Members are unanimous that the
new North Sydney headquarters will
add considerably to the status of the
building industry in N.S.W., from an
academic and ethical point of view.
The President, Mr. C. F. Gage, has
rendered outstanding service to the
Chapter during his term of office and
the acquisition by the Federal body of
an imposing building, specially design'
ed and planned by experts, is an
achievement to be proud of, a mem'
ber told our representative.

Uses of Laminated Timber Construe'
tion.”
Mr. Zipfinger is regarded as an ex'
pert in this specialised field, and his
address traced the evolution of lam'
inated timber for use in massive arches,
towers, and a variety of other purposes
on the Continent and overseas.
The address was supported bv manv
lantern slides of projects which involv'
ed the use of laminated timber con'
struction of many different types.
Fire Resistant.
Mr. Zipfinger stressed the fact that
laminated timber constructions are
highly fire resistant, a reason why this
type of arch is used for industrial
buildings overseas where fire risk is
present. Among those are paint and
chemical plants, theatres, churches, etc.
Other points made by the speaker
were:
• The use of high-grade material
can be limited to positions where
high stresses occur; for instance,
in a beam, to top and bottom
laminations only. Poor quality
timber in random lengths can be
safely used in lightly-stressed sec-
tions.
In a laminated timber beam, the
glue lines bind the boards to-
gether, making it to all intents
and purposes a solid piece of
timber.
The maximum length or height
of laminated timber constructions
is practically unlimited. Very
deep beams can be constructed as
cheaply as shallow beams from
timber of ordinary dimensions.
Although spans and dimensions
of these constructions are un-
limited, the maximum span, from
a practical point of view, would
be not over 300 ft.
Members can be cambered,
curved or tapered for sake of ap-
pearance or for greater structural
efficiency; extra depth can be
provided where needed.
• Laminated timber construction is
highly resistant against gas fumes
and corrosion. It is fire and
water resistant.
The Chapter members were particu-
larly interested in the fact that lamin-
ated timber arches in Holland had
been under water for lL years during
the war, and emerged as good as the
day they were made, when the land
was drained.
Vote of Thanks.
Moving a vote of thanks to the
speaker, Mr. A. W. Edwards said the
address had been both educative and
enlightening. There seemed little
doubt that laminated timber arches
could supply an alternative for steel
arches in Australia, especially in view
of the climbing costs and scarcity of
the latter material.

GRANDSTAND AT SPORTSSROUND, ’S HERTOGENBOSCH, HOLLAND
Length 205 ft.; width 38ft.; height 24ft.; spacing 16ft. (Built 1938.) The cantilevered awning giving
an unobstructed view of the playing field, has to be strong enough to stand up to the force of all
winds and weathers underneath as well as on top. It is structurally sound if its verticals are strong
enough to convey these pressures to the extended anchorage beneath the seating, and no engineer
would undertake such a structure without first seeing to that.

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
It is not surprising that the number
of building permits given by the Bris-
bane City Council in the months of
January and February were much be'
low the average of the preceding
months. This applies particularly to
January, when the number of permits
was 507, and the number in February,
674. The midsummer holidays string'
ing off into January, and the heavy
rainfall, both affected that month, and
the heavier rain and floodings in
places, minus holidays, did not, how'
ever, affect the figures to the extent
that might have been expected in Feb'
ruary.
Building Figures Analysed.
In January, taking for granted the
predominance of dwellings costing less
than £3OOO, there were 23 in the
£3OOO to £4OOO class, four costing
£4OOO to £6OOO, and four, at £6OOO
to £7OOO. There were 12 permits for
flats, shops and factories and altera'
tions to others costing from £4OOO to
£10,000; a factory- to cost £24,000
and office building £70,000. Petrol
service stations continue to brighten
up, four of them costing in the aggre'
gate £lB,OOO. Two Church halls cost
respectively £5OOO and £3000; a
theatrette £4000; an amenities block
£5250; and a swimming pool at Boys’
Grammar School £12,500.
In February the number of new
dwellings to cost over £3OOO and up
to £4OOO was 22, while 11 others are
to cost over £4OOO to £BOOO. Despite
the trials and tribulations of landlords,
six of them are venturing into the
troubled waters of the Landlord and
Tenant Act, with new flat buildings
costing from £3OOO upwards to one
block to cost £20,000 and another
£30,000. No less than 23 new shops
and factories, including additions and
alterations to others are to cost from
£3200 to £13,000 and another of them
£25,000. Additions to two Church
halls will cost £3400 and £BOOO, and
those to a Church £16,664. Three
service stations will expend £15,200
in the aggregate. Shop and office fit'
ters E. J. Grigg and Sons Pty. Ltd.,
will spend £25,000 on rebuilding their
premises; and a new factory and of'
flee block for H. V. McKay Massey
Harris Q. Pty. Ltd. will cost £234,000.
That it costs money to “unbuild” just
as it costs to build'up, is shown by the
allocation of £9OOO to demolish old
shops to make way for a new insur'
ance edifice. So many building ar'
tisans, painters, etc., have been en'
gaged in decorating, repainting, and
furbishing for the Royal Visit, that
the leeway to be made up presages a
very busy building period ahead.
Despite the disastrous floods so close
to Brisbane, as is Northern New
South Wales, human beings display
much of the ardour of the ants which
begin to rebuild immediately disaster
has overtaken their nests. Whether
the ants are encouraged in the same
way by physical and moral help, as
has been displayed by the fortunates,
towards the unfortunates, is something
which we can only hope for, in the
name of human charity.
Somerset Dam.
Brisbane’s great Somerset Dam,
with its two main purposes of water
storage and flood prevention, has util'
ised another potential string, in the
shape of a hydro-electrical generator
to help in peak hours to augment
Brisbane’s diversified electrical power
generators. The impounded water be'
hind the dam, on being released
through a 9ft. steeMined outfit in the
dam itself, goes to a 4,500 h.p. tur'

kW installed downstream in the pow'
er house. The average output of elec'
trical energy would be from 750 to

100 kW in normal circumstances; but
there being a need for greater power
when the dam has water beyond the
needs to maintain the level of a full
head, the output of energy could be
increased. Such a contingency is more
likely to occur when Brisbane’s elec'
trical stations in course of completion,
find it difficult to provide the maxi'
mum load of winter requirements, a
probability envisaged when an agree'
ment was made in 1949 to “feed” this
potential power into the State Elec'
tricity network.
There has been strong criticism in
the City Council Aldermanic circles,
over the delay in bringing the power
house at Tennyson on the Brisbane
River to a completion. Tenders were
received some two months ago, and
are still held up until the position is
clarified. The most favoured two of
the four tenders received quoted prices
of £263,000 and of £289,000, which
were hardly comparable because in
the first'named—Hornibrook’s tender
—a rise and fall clause was provided,
and in the latter, £26,000 higher,
which excluded a rise and fall clause,
in terms of the specifications of the
Brisbane City Council’s Consulting
Engineers. As Hornibrook’s tender
provided for completion in 20 motnhs,
a rise and fall clause as protection
against cost of living quarterly adjust'
ments, just as, say potatoes, take a
jump during a temporary shortage, is
a gamble that they, and their Queens'
land Associations would rather not
have to juggle with, even though the
danger period were only 20 months.
Moreover the electricity department
manager (Mr. Anthony) had recom'
mended in unequivocal terms, that
Hornibrook’s tender be accepted. The
Department of Planning and Building,
City Council had tendered £304,781/
18/6 contract to be completed in 24
months. It is cases such as this one
that emphasises the need to stabilise
wages. Fresh tenders which closed on
March 18 have been called.
The need of every serviceable rail'
way carriage during the passenger ac'
tivities arising out of the Queen’s
visit, brought into use one that had
been built in 1882. It was numbered
7, and by working on it at some pres'
sure, carriage makers had it in service
as a second class carriage with a plat'
form at each end, in lieu of a guard’s
van and a first class compartment. The
approximate present cost of a Queens'
land Railways suburban coach —not a
de luxe vehicle by any stretch of im'
agination—is £lO,OOO. When the
carriage of 1882 vintage was built, its
cost was £683. O Temporal O mores.
The once greatest gold mine in the
world —Mount Morgan Gold Mining
Co. Ltd. —is now turning its serious
attention towards the manufacture of
fertiliser in the form of ammonium
sulphate, from the immense quantities
of pyrites at Mt. Morgan, in conjunc'
tion with the nearby open cut coal
measures of the Callide Valley. The
project is now being discussed in Eng'
land from whence it is hoped to get
the necessary money to build the
works.
The company, according to the
Chairman of Directors —Mr. J. Mah
colm Newman —is sanguine of success
in adding this £lO million pound string
to its bow of gold and copper recov'
eries over the past 60'70 vears.
Chain Store Expansion.
One of the triumvirate of chain
stores, Penneys (already having 31
branches in Queensland and Northern
N.S.W.) the other two owners being
Woolworths and Coles—is to spend
£200,000 in building a structural steel
and brick air'conditioned retail ware'
house with frontages to three streets in
Fortitude Valley. The frontage to
Brunswick Street will be 73 feet and
that to Warner Street 285 feet when
old two'storey buildings of brick, stone
and timber have been demolished. The
present plan provides for four rein'
forced floors, which include a base'
ment and a sub'basement, this latter
being a customers’ car park. Founda'
tions provide for two additional floors.
Prefabricated Dwellings.
The major tangle that has developed
since the Housing Commission in its
laudable endeavour to accelerate the
number and speed of house building,
is such that the Premier, Mr. Gair,
has felt it necessary to give the prob'
lem his personal attention. In these
latter years of scarcity of materials
and artisans, rising wages and prices,
and where foreign workmen are han'
dicapped, just as Queensland builders
would be similarly handicapped if sud'
denly transferred to Italy, Sweden,
Holland and France to build houses
there. The problem is real. Everyone
who has any knowledge of the com'
bined worries in the building indus'
try, will wish the Premier success in
straightening out the tangle, with fair'
ness to all concerned. The fact that
one company was charged in July last
in 16 alleged breaches of awards cov'
ering several building trades supports
this view.
The fact that the Housing Minister
(Mr. Hilton) needs the help of the
Premier emphasises the gravity of the
position, as he finds it. In connection
with seven awards covering the claims
of Ake Sundell, of George Street,
Sydney Constructional Engineer and
Contractor, there has been litigation
resulting after some appeals upon ap'
peals, in favour of Sundell with heavy
costs against the Government. It has
been said that many people in the
country work from “ Jackass to
Jackass”; that people in the cities
now live from “Golden Casket to
Golden Casket,” and it may soon be
added that people in the building in'
dustry live from dispute to dispute.
Most cases, wisely, are kept out of
court.
The Premier will hardly find his
new task a sedative after the very sue'
cessful, but hectic. Royal Visit. The
Italian problem concerns a contract
for £2,750,000 entered into by the
firm of Legnami Pasotti, with opera'
tions at the suburb of Carina, South
Brisbane.
In the Swedish case, awards exceed'
ing £30,000 have been given against
the Government and costly legal pro'
ceedings are still pending. The most

CONCRETE FLOORS
ore -
• ECONOMICAL
• FIRE AND TERMITE PROOF
• COMFORTABLE
• AN AID TO CONSTRUCTION
Local physiological investigations and overseas experience have proved that concrete floors are
neither cold nor hard to walk on as was commonly thought to be the case. Now that this fallacious
belief has been discredited the very definite advantages which these floors have over other types will
undoubtedly bring them into great favour with home builders
Some of these advantages are:
• Since the floor is placed directly on the ground many courses of brickwork are eliminated
resulting in a saving of labour and materials.
• The floor is fireproof and termite-proof.
• The lowering of the general level of the house improves appearance and combined indoor
and outdoor living.
• From the commencement of the job workmen have a clean smooth surface on which to work
which is inducive to greater efficiency.
Concrete floors in homes is not a new idea as statistics show that in the U.S.A. in 1950, 22%
of all cottages built in that year had concrete floors.
The sketch indicates one method of constructing a concrete floor on the ground —there are
others to suit circumstances and requirements.

the city of Brisbane. The French con'
tractors, Le Corche Freres, abandoned
their contract, and left the country
and a number of unfinished houses,
and dissatisfied occupants of many
others. The retention money of
£50,000 held by the Government has
been used to finish some of the houses
by day labour, after which the Hous-
ing Commission will not build any
more houses in this area. It is pub'
licly stated that the firm of Le Corche
owes £130,000 to the bank, and
£120,000 to trade creditors in Queens'
land.
One thing is certain: the creditors
can expect nothing from the Govern'
ment. At a recent meeting they de-
cided to take steps to force a settle'
ment, if possible, from debtors com'
pletely away from Australia.
The State’s allocation of £8 million
for prefabricated housing is the foum
tain from which the turmoil has arisen.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
The Commonwealth Savings Bank
of Australia has announced that it will
erect new, modern premises in Hind'
ley Street. The site, with a 40 ft.
frontage by 213 ft. depth, was bought
during February for an undisclosed
figure—believed to be among the
highest paid for any comparable pro'
perty in Adelaide. Work has begun
on plans for the new building. A
property adjoining the proposed bank
site has also been sold. Both transac'
tions, among several recent Hindley
Street property deals, highlight the in-
creased interest being taken in this
thoroughfare by commercial organisa'
tions. Large'scale development of
Hindley Street, as an outlet for over'
crowded Bundle Street, is pending.
The recent flurry of real estate activ'
ity is expected to result in more big
renovation orders to South Australian
contracting firms. One major build'
ing in Hindley Street was bought re'
cently at a price upward of £50,000
by a leading department store and
renovation work is expected to start
within the next few months.
Among the more interesting of cur-
rent Hindley Street “facedift” jobs is
that in progress at the premises of
James Smith Ltd. The re-modelling.
designed by Harold T. Griggs, will be
done in two sections. Work has
been in progress since mid'January
and will be completed about July. An
'■''island” showcase window of about
350 square feet is among the most
striking aspects of the plan. A can'
tilever verandah will be added —the
aluminium structural frame and treat'
ment for the frontage windows will
be new to South Australia. Contract'
ors for the job are McEntee and Wil'
liams.
Two big hotel fobs have come off
the drawing boards. More than
£40,000 will be .spent on alterations to
the Largs Pier Hotel. Tenders will
be called immediately the plans are
approved by the Licensing Court. The
hotel will be glassfronted for about
160 feet along the Esplanade. Amen'
ities will include a patio lounge, beer
garden, bowling green and tennis
courts. One breakaway from the con'
ventional is the provision of a drink'
ing bar for ladies. Preliminary work
is now under way and the main job
is expected to be finished by Christ'
mas. The alterations were designed
by the architectural staff of the South
Australian Brewing Co.

The Midland Licensing Court has
granted Mr. C. W. Stratton, of Glen
Osmond, a license to erect The Flind-
ers Hotel, a two-storey 12-bedroom
structure in . Grand Junction Road,
Rosewater. The design, by Evans and
Bruer, Philpot and Partners, is one of
the most revolutionary seen in this
state since the war. The site is close
to the Addison Road intersection, al-
most half a mile from the nearest
hotel. Tenders will be called shortly
and construction will take about 12
months. A feature of the design is
the placing of the private entrance,
set back 90 feet from the footpath.
Entry is through a lawn and beer
Garden. The public and saloon bars
and bottle department connect direct-
ly with a central keg store and cold
storage space at ground level. The
dining room, public lounge, and bars
all face on to the beer garden. Seven
of the guest bedrooms will have pri-
vate showers and all 12 will have hot
water. In addition there will be four
staff bedrooms.
A £136,000 tender from the Peak
Construction Co. has been accepted
for building a new theatre and men’s
block at the Port Pirie Hospital.
State Government approval for the
work has been given. The new build-
ing will be three-storeyed with at least
two operating theatres, in addition to
a 70-bed men’s block, and will house
Physiotherapy and X-ray departments.
The Director-General of Hospitals
(Dr. J, R. Rollison) says the exten-
sions are in accordance with modern
hospital design.
Two educational courses in build-
ing—the first ever instituted in this
State —opened at the School of Mines
on February 8. The State Chapter of
the Australian Institute of Builders and
the Builders and Contractors Associa-
tion of South Australia are giving the
project full-scale backing. Contract-
ing firms have been circularised, and
several are encouraging specialised ed-
ucation for selected employees. The
syllabus includes a three-year course
for building foreman and clerk of
works and five years for a master
builder’s certificate. There are 12
pupils in the former class and four in
the latter. The master builder’s cer-
tificate has already become the quali-
fication for membership of the Aus-
tralian Institute of Builders. The In-
stitute Secretary (Mr. Henry Wilck-
ens) hopes it will, in time, become a
necessary qualification for anyone
wanting to set up business as a master
builder in South Australia.
South Australian church bodies plan
to spend about £440,000 on new
buildings and extensions in 1954
easily a record for any year. Last
year’s programme called for a
£150,000 outlay. Biggest expenditure
this year will be by the Methodist
Church, which has expansion plans
totalling about £lBO,OOO. The Roman
Catholic Church has a programme of
new schools, convents, and church
buildings, to cost more than £160,000.
The Baptist Church will spend about
£32,000, the Church of Christ about
£30,000, and the Church of England
about £20,000. Priority projects for
the Methodist Church include a two-
storeyed block of memorial classrooms
at Prince Alfred College, expenditure
of £40,000 at Methodist Ladies’ Col-
lege, including £32,000 for a new
boarding house wing; an administra-
tive wing, dormitory block and chapel
at Wesley College; and additions to
Nunyarra Youth Centre. Belair. Ac-
tivity among the other denominations
is confined mainly to church hall and
primary school buildings.
Gay’s Arcade, which runs between
Adelaide Arcade and Twin Street will
be remodelled to accommodate mod-
ern shops, showrooms, a night club,
a coffee lounge, and a quick-service
cafeteria. The project will cost more
than £20,000. Mr. J. R. Skipper,
who took a 20-year lease on the prem-
ises this year aims to convert a neg-
lected part of the city’s shopping
centre into a modern block, represent-
ing as many retail trades as possible.
The new Arcade will be three-storeyed
and all ground floor shopfronts will be
extended four feet and modernised
with large plate-glass windows. There
will be 18 shops, each with an area
of about 1,000 sqare feet.
Work on the Ashton and Lenswood
Cold Stores is in its final stages and
both projects will be completed early
in March. Construction has been
continuing since early last year. The
estimated building costs are £50,000
at Lenswood and £34,000 at Ashton.
When completed, the Ashton Cold
Store —capacity 84,000 cases —will be
the biggest under one roof in South
Australian country areas. Lenswood
Cold Store, built under more than
one roof, will hold 113,000 cases,
making it the largest overall in South
Australian country districts. Lucas
and Parker are the architects for both
jobs. Contracts were let piecemeal.
Tenders have closed for the erection
of a new block of living quarters at
Minda Home, Brighton. The new
building will be single-storey, divided
into senior and junior sections, and
designed to accommodate 72 girls.
Construction will be mainly of brick
with a tiled roof. Ten dormitories are
included in a main structure 277 feet
long. Facilities include ablution
blocks and recreation areas for each
section, sick dormitories, and dressing
rooms. The architect is Hubert H.
Cowell. Tenders are still under dis'
cussion and work will begin immedi'
ately a contract is signed.
Plans to re-equip the Tivoli Theatre
and spend about £60,000 on ex-
tensive alterations, have been scrap-
ped. For the third time in eight
years, the property is up for sale.
Mr. D. A. Waterman, a director of
Waterman Bros. Ltd., which bought
the theatre in 1946, has announced
his firm’s decision to place the Tivoli
on the market again. No reason has
been given for the abandonment of
plans—scheduled to be put into oper-
ation this year —which were to have
made the Tivoli a top-line theatre
with an archestra pit large enough to

accommodate a full symphony orches-
tra, and a stage fitted with the latest
mechanical equipment.
The Savings Bank of South Austra-
lia, which has noticeably stepped up
its building programme over the past
18 months, has accepted a £24,000
tender for construction of new branch
premises in Commercial Road. Port
Augusta. Whyalla builder, T. W. Gil-
bert, whose firm erected the Port Au-
gusta High School, was the successful
contractor. Plans disclose that the
new, double-storey structure will have
a terracotta facing of 10-inch square
tiles with a corrugated asbestos cement
roof. The bank will use the ground
floor, and upper rooms will be avail-
able for letting as office space. Archi-
tects for the job are the Adelaide firm
of Caradoc Ashton, Fisher, Wood-
head, and Beaumont Smith.
Five South Australian delegates left
Sydney for America with the Austra-
lian Building Industry Productivity
Team. They included Mr. R. f.
Nurse, president of the Builders and
Contractors Association of South Aus-
tralia; Mr. H. Wilckens, State Chapter
Secretary of the Australian Institute of
Builders; Mr. Harold T. Griggs, ar-
chitect; Mr. M. C. Wood, building
contractor, and Mr. John Martin, di-
rector of an Adelaide firm of plumb-
ing, heating and ventilation engineers
The South Australians are particular-
ly interested in American equipment
pools, whereby a number of firms buy
heavy items of equipment, then hire
them out individually from the “pool.”
Thus the plant is in constant use. In
South Australia, graders and similar
heavy equipment owned by single
firms are often in use for only about
four days a month.
Three metropolitan beach councils
—Glenelg, Brighton, and Henley and
Grange—have only four months left
in which to spend a further £75,000
on foreshore repairs. Storms which
lashed South Australia last year caused
hundreds of thousands of pounds
damage on Adelaide beaches, and the
Government granted £200,000 for re-
pair work. Tune 30 is the final date
set by the Government for Councils
to claim reimbursement for foreshore
restoration. It is felt that both
Brighton and Henley and Grange will
have difficulty in completing their pres-
ent jobs in time to collect the full sub-
sidy. Unless work is completed by
early April bad weather will make
building operations along the fore-
shore extremely difficult.
Plans for a number of interesting
jobs in the under-£20,000 bracket were
completed over the past month. A
contract will be signed shortly for
erection of the Aldgate Memorial
Hall. Local stone will be used for the
main external walls and large glassed
areas will face the north-east and
south-west. A feature of the design
is the use made of a difficult site by
terracing and the placing of floor
levels. The hall will seat 300 people,
and a supper room, dressing rooms
and a stage will be provided. Archi-
tects for the project are Evans and
Bruer, Philpot and Partners. The
same firm has also completed the de-
sign for a new Lutheran Church in
Archer St., Adelaide. It will accom-
modate 250. The design incorporates
a “Mothers’ Room” separated from
the nave by plateglass windows and
completely soundproofed. Loudspeak-
ers will convey the service into the
room. A decision on tenders for this
job is expected soon.
Contracts worth more than <£30,000
have been let by the Commonwealth
Works Department for work at Wood-
side Army Camp. Sealing of the
parade ground will be done by N.
Mellor Ltd. for £14,198. A £9,975
contract for paling fencing went to S.
J. Weir Pty. Ltd. and a £7,745 order
for paving and sealing to G. J.
Stevens.
Few big jobs have been let by the
Department this year, but there has
been a rise in the amount of post of-
fice building. Biggest job in this cate-
gory is the two-storeyed brick com-
munications building at Balaklava to
be erected by Gaskin Bros. (S.A.)
Ltd. at a cost of £29,869.
The two-storey building of Knox,
Pritchard and Cheel Ltd. in Hind-
marsh Square, Adelaide, has been sold
for an undisclosed sum. It was bought
by Retail Motor Trading Co. Ltd. and
will be completely remodelled for use
as offices. The alterations will include
a new facade and will begin almost
immediately.
Royal Tour “face-lifts” will be of
long-term benefit to Adelaide, says the
president of the South Australian In-
stitute of Architects (Mr. W. T. Has-
lam). The old style of attempting to
paint the walls of buildings to look
like stone has been abandoned, and
lighter colours are now being used
in line with modern trends. The ef-
fect is startling in Adelaide’s hitherto
drab streets. Building in Adelaide is
gradually moving forward, Mr. Has-
lam says. Industrial architecture has
shown definite improvement in recent
years. New commercial building, as
indicated by blocks due to go up soon,
also seems to follow modern thought.
Though Mr. Haslam sees no evidence
of an increased use of architectural
services for home-building, he says
that even in the field of domestic de-
sign, Adelaide is moving slowly away
fromh the conventional.
NEW ENGLISH CHURCH.
This Parish Church of St. Paul was recently built at Stratford, England, to seat
300 people. The principal considerations affecting the choice of scheme was that
it should be in accordance with the evangelical tradition of the Parish and that
the cost should be kept as low as possible. The plan is accordingly simple, having
a combined Chancel and Sanctuary and a wide and short Nave, which enables all
members of the congregation to have a clear view of the Altar.

Professor of
Architectural Science
Welcomed
Dr. H. J. Cowan Addresses Architects.
At a luncheon of the N.S.W. Chap-
ter of the R.A.1.A., members of the
architectural profession in N.S.W.
welcomed Dr. H. J. Cowan, who has
recently arrived in Australia to take
up an appointment at the University
of Sydney, as Professor of Architect-
ural Science.
The Professor stated that although
the subject of Architectural Science
was one which had come into prom-
inence in recent years in Great Brit-
ain, Australia had the distinction of
being the first to appoint a Professor
entirely devoted to this new aspect of
an architect’s work.
He briefly spoke of the scope of
his work as he saw it, and invited
comment and advice from members of
the profession. As the first Professor
of this new subject, there was, he
said, ample scope for making mistakes
in setting up a course of instruction.
Professor Cowan, who is 34 years
of age, was Lecturer in Civic Engineer-
ing and Architecture at the University
of Sheffield. He has had professional
experience in building and engineer-
ing in London and at the University
of Sheffield developed a modern con-
crete laboratory where research on re-
inforced and prestressed concrete was
carried out.
Mr P. J. Gordon proposed a vote
of thanks to the Professor on behalf
of the gathering.
TREATMENT OF CONCRETE
ROOF SURFACE.
The blistering of the surface of a
concrete roof proved on investigation
that the origin was the lightweight
(ash) concrete grading had been em-
ployed for the top layer. Evidence
goes to show that the expansion of
trapped moisture between the layers
is the cause and the solution is to em
sure that the applied surfaces are
thoroughly dry; both the base and
the top layer being heated during the
application of the latter. The material
alternatively should be sufficiently
porous and situated so as to permit
the rapid escape of water vapour by
downward diffusion. Excessive temper-
ature rise of the upper surface, where
its dryness cannot be ensured, should
be prevented.

industrial, hospital, or owner'occupier
purposes.
However, owing to high building
costs, commercial building is expected
to remain stagnant in Brisbane for
five years, according to a leading archi'
tect.
This was despite a heavy demand
for office space, and there appears to
be prospects of little relief for some
time, he added.
Some of the buildings begun or to
be commenced this year are:
• Canberra Hotel —T emsto r e y
brick, steel, and reinforced concrete
addition to present hotel in Ann St.
The wing will accomodate 200 extra
guests, with new kitchen, additional
dining'rooms and function rooms.
Cost: £450,000.
• Cyclone Co. of Australia—Brick
and steel'framed production shop at
Geebung, with brick administrative
and amenities buildings and extensive
concrete roadway. Cost; £125,000.
• Dalgety and Co. Ltd.: To begin
in April or May; a five'Storey mod'
ern brick and reinforced concrete
wool store at Bulimba. Cost: £500,000.
• Egg Board: Three'Storey concrete
building, Normanby. Cost: Over
£200,000.
• Marrickville Margarine: Four'
storeyed, flat-roofed brick and rein'
forced concrete building. £250,000.
• Mt. Olivet Hospital: Five'Storey
steel, reinforced concrete, and brick
hospital, Kangaroo Point. Cost:
£280,000.
• Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assur'
ance Co.: 12'storeys, including base'
ment. Cost: £250,000 to £300,000.
• Prudential Assurance Co.: Five'
storey building. Cost: £500,000.
University Buildings.
Building projects at St. Lucia, site
of the Queensland University, include:
• Cromwell College (Congregation'
al Churches in Queensland). Design'
ed for 120 students. Cost; More than
£lOO,OOO.
• Kings College (Methodist
Church); Two'Storev brick and stone
building for at least 70 students. Cost:
£160,000.
• St. John's College (Anglican):

NACO ADJUSTABLE LOUVRE
WINDOWS.
New “Weatherseal.”
Naco Trading Pty. Ltd. announce
a new patent “Weatherseal”. A pro'
truding rib has been formed down
the centre of each louvre frame, the
glass'holding clips have recessed flanges
which, when the louvre is closed, lock
against the frame ribs to form a com'
plete seal.
Circular bronze bearings which
maintain sufficient space between the
frames and the glass clips to allow
movement without rubbing or bind'
ing, permit painting of the louvres if
desired.

Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modern school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and Hilcon lightweight precast reinforced
concrete Roof, Floor and Wall units.
All Presweld Components are permanently rust-
proofed by the hot dip galvanizing process.

MCNARY HYDRO-ELECTRIC
STATION GENERATORS.
The contract for the manufacture
and installation of two water wheel
generators, physically ranking among
the largest ever built, has been award-
ed to the English Electric Export 6?
Trading Company Limited by the
United States Army Corps of Engin-
eers at a cost of approximately
£1,300,000.
The maximum output of each gen-
erator will be 84,740 kVA at 13.8
kV, 60 cycles, 85.7 r.p.m. (approx.
108,000 H.P. output).
The hydro-electric station at the
foot of McNary Dam, built across the
Columbia River is designed to ac-
commodate fourteen generating sets,
having a total maximum output of
1,186,400 kVA.
The two machines are due for com-
missioning before December, 1956.
Upstream from McNary is the Chief
Joseph Dam, for which the company
is building three 310,000 kVA banks
of transformers to step up the gener-
ator voltage to 230 kV for transmis-
sion purposes. Four generators are
connected to each bank of transform-
ers.
A few facts, giving some impression
of the size of the generators now or-
dered, may be of interest:
1. Well over 1,000 tons of material,
mainly special steeJs and copper, are
required for the construction of each
unit, which will have an overall size
of nearly 52 ft.
2. To facilitate transport and erec-
tion, each stator will be split into sev-
eral parts. The complete stator will
weigh about 180 tons and will have
an outside diameter of approximately
42 ft.
3. The assembled rotor will be near-
ly 35 ft. in diameter and over 5 ft.
deep. With the shaft—which will be
nearly 35 ft. long and will weigh
some 80 tons —and other fitted parts,
the rotor weight will approach 500
tons. (This will be the heaviest lift
to be negotiated by the station cranes.)
4. The thrust bearing of each unit
will have to withstand the hydraulic
thrust, as well as the weight of the
rotating parts of the generator and
turbine amounting to 1700 tons in all.
The generators will be built at the
Stafford Works of The English Elec-
tric Company Limited.
The English Electric Company Lim-
ited have supplied Water Turbine Gen-
ertaing Plant to all Major Generating
Authorities in Australasia who use this
form of power.
IS MODERN LIGHTING ON
THE RIGHT TRACK?
This subject is discussed in an ar-
ticle entitled “Looking Lighting in
the Face,” by Mr. W. Robinson, B.Sc.,
A.M.1.E.E., F.1.E.5., in the journal
“Light and Lighting” (Vol. XLVI,
No. 12).
The author treats the subject in a
very practical way and recognises that
his viewpoint may be a “heresay” to
orthodox lighting practice. He con-
siders that modern lighting fittings
and reflectors are doing a dis-service
to the public and to the industry.
For instance he shows that the ordin-
ary dispersive reflector designed to
re-direct all upward light downward
actually deprives the user of 30 per
cent, of the light of the lamp.
By elaborate, massive shades and re-
flectors the light emission of both fila-
ment and fluorescent lamps is strangu-
lated. He calls for simplicity and
utility in lighting fittings.
This is an article which would re-
pay study by many illuminating en-
gineers. They will find it illuminat-
ing.

gineers report a decrease from the
high level of road-making costs which
have prevailed in recent years.
Because of the rocky nature of the
area road making of Burke Road,
North, at Heidelberg, is costing £lO
a foot.
Mr. R. F. Cowell Ham, architect,

H. Vivian Taylor has invited bids for
alterations and extensions to the-
theatre entrance.
Another large factory building is-
announced for Clayton, on the Princes
Highway, beyond Oakleigh. An Eng'
lish Company—Allied Ironfounders—

cost about £291,000. It is the first
tenant-owned office building in Mel-
bourne and its successful flotation
could be the forerunner of others.
Difficulty, however, still exists under
the present Landlord and Tenant Reg-
ulations of obtaining possession of old
buildings to be demolished to make
way for new offices.
In Gilbert Court some floors have
been sold to an investment company
which will rent space.
Cr. Solly said he welcomed the new
building as the erection of office
buildings in the city had stagnated
since the war.
Cr. Solly announced recently that
it was the intention of the Melbourne
City Council to seek Loan Council
approval to the Council borrowing
£3,500,000 for major building works.
Last August the City Council ap-
proved the erection of an 11-storey
office block, with 150,000 sq. ft. of
floor space on the Collins Street front-
age of the Western Market site.
Other major Council projects are
the big housing scheme in Pigdon St.,
Carlton, comprising blocks of flats and
homes for old people to clear portion
of the city slums.
Other projects include a new
bridge over the Yarra at King Street.
It is understood some of the Insur-
ance Companies have already indicat-
ed they would be prepared to take up
the major portion of the loan issue.
It is reported that rank and file
of building workers will campaign for
increased margins and improved work-
ing conditions. They also want the
pay of apprentices worked out on
tradesmen’s rates.
The Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works has announced a
£300,000 plan to extend and improve
water, sewerage and drainage schemes
in several of the areas under its con-
trol.
The outer suburbs have grown so
quickly in recent years that the Board
has been unable to keep up with the
spread. Many areas are without sew-
erage and some will be for many
years but the works now proposed
will improve the position for some
areas.
New water mains are becoming ne-
cessary to meet the increased demands.
In the Brighton-Moorabbin area
miles of new mains are to be laid.
The Board of Works has announced
that it will adopt a new method of
replacing corroded domestic water
pipes. Corrosion in old pines will be
removed by sand blasting and this
will also increase the diameter of the
pipe so that a copper tube can be in-
serted inside the old galvanised iron
pipe while still in the ground. This
new technique has been developed by
Mr. E. F. T. Splatt, the Board’s water
service engineer.
The chief use of the new method
will be in replacing water pipes be'
tween street mains and householders’
meters. Mr. jessop, Chairman of the
Board, expects to cut the cost of pipe
replacements by about one'third and
to save householders more than
.£65,000 a year.
The Board has signed a contract
with Sainrapt and Brice (Aust.) Pty.
Ltd. for £159,922, for the construction
of a diversion drain and tunnel, two-
thirds of a mile long, to prevent flood-
ing of a section of the industrial sub-
urb of Sunshine.
The Sunshine City Council is itself
also carrying out extensive drainage
works.
Speaking at a recent meeting of
the Victorian Division of the Austra-
lian Welding Institute, Mr. Galbally,
Minister for Electrical Undertakings,
predicted that Victoria would become
an all-electric State within the next
six years.
The delayed Morwell briquetting
project would be started this year and
machinery which has been lying idle
for so long erected.
The Government aimed to double
the present generating capacity of
Yallourn within 5 years. The Com-
mission was developing and ex-

New Canberra
College
£154,>900 Project Opened.
The new £154,000 Christian Broth'
ers’ College in Canberra was recently
opened by Cardinal Gilroy. The cob
lege was designed by Mr. C. Glancey,
architect, and erected by S. D. C.
Kennedy and Bird Pty. Ltd., Master
Builders, of Sydney and Canberra.
Mr. Kennedy told our representative
that the authorities plan to extend the
present building as soon as funds per'
mit, and the completed school will
cost £250,000.
The fine three'Storey mottled cream-
brick building on an elevated position
in Canberra Avenue at the southern
entrance to the city has already be-
come an Canberra landmark.
It includes a residence for the teach-
ing staff, incorporates the most mod-
ern architectural features and is claim-
ed to be one of the best schools south
of the Equator.
Many of the fittings and appliances
are unique in Australia.
From the entrance steps to the Col-
lege, in a wide semi-circle, can be
seen the R.A.N. station, H.M.A.S.
“Harman,” the Fairbairn R.A.A.F.
station, the Australian Memorial to
the U.S.A., and the Australian War
Memorial.

The Privileged
Classes
Postal van drivers are refusing to
clear street boxes if cars are parked
in front of them. At the foot of
Loftus Street recently, three Com'
monwealth cars blocked out the only
posting box on the Quay. A mail
van was seen to drive by twice and
then drove off without clearing the
box.
One would at least expect the Com'
monwealth to set an example by keep'
ing its mail boxes clear, as requested
by its own employees—the postal van
drivers.
To get immunity from parking
fines one must buy a barrow. Con'
trive by crafty influence to get road'
side sellers’ license and then occupy
the most congested traffic spots in
Bydney. A barrowman can park his
car all day long in city streets without
the tyres being chalked. They can also
spread their boxes along city kerbs
for yards in each direction. There’s
no doubt about it, they certainly are
the aristocracy of the Socialist Party.
But let a car occupy the kerb beside
him and he is booked in a twinkling.
A car stood all day long in a city
street. A “Brown Bomber’’ marked
all the cars in its vicinity but left this
car alone. At the end of a tiring day
bending down to chalk innumerable
tyres, the “Bomber’’ unlocked the
door of the privileged car, climbed
in, and drove off!
No Fines Concrete
No'fines concrete, i.e., concrete
made without sand has advantages
over normal concrete in that the voids
between the aggregate hinder the pas'
sage of water through the mass, and
also improve the best insulating pro-
perties of the wall in much the same
way as does the cavity of a brick wall.
Savings can be made of 40% of
cement as compared with dense con'
Crete of equal volume; forms may be
much lighter. No'fines concrete is
particularly suitable for walling and
the walls may be built by unskilled
labour in medium and large scale
buildings. For dwellings, costs of no'
fines walls compare favourably with
costs of brick walls, especially where
bricks must be hauled long distances.

on the subject may be obtained from

Stockholm Builds Self-Contained Suburb
RELIEVES DULLNESS OF “DORMITORY” CITIES
Inspired by British residential plan-
ning and research the Stockholm City
Authorities about two years ago em-
barked upon a new venture in sub-
urban building, the Vallingby satellite
city. Planned for a population of
24,000, Vallingby is designated to be-
come a garden city with varied types
of buildings, both single- family villas
and apartment houses; the latter are
being built in the form of 10-12-
storeyed “point houses’’ or as uneven-
ly distributed rows of 3-storeyed
buildings. Situated about ten miles
west of the centre of Stockholm, Val-
lingby will have every civic, social and
trade facility for its own inhabitants,
as well as for another 50-60,000 people
living in the adjacent smaller suburbs.
The development of this new city,
devised in detail before any construc-
tion was begun, shows a pattern quite
the opposite to that of the established
historical trend of community growth,
in which the centre of trade or wor-
ship gave birth to the urban unit.
The facilities provided by modern
communications usually make the sub-
urban dwellers look to the metropolis
as their social centre. The resulting
bleak', anonymous life of the “dormi-
tory suburbs has been blamed for
the rootlessness and discontent of
their inhabitants so common in our
days. The Vallingby planners have
wished to counteract this tendency by
giving the people who live there a
natural communal centre, a trading
and meeting place with facilities also
for leisure and amusements. There-
fore the Vallingby centre has been de-
signed to comprise all kinds of civic
facilities from the outset.
One-third of Vallingby’s dwelling
units are now inhabited or ready for
occupation, and the building of the
centre as well as the remaining hous-
ing cpnstruction is going ahead at a
very lively pace. When the city has
been built out according to the plans
—which will be in about 2 years time
—the centre, schools and libraries, etc.,
will also be in full operation. Medi-
cal and dental clinics, a chemist’s shop,
banks, restaurants, sports and hobby
facilities are also included in the pro-
ject, apart from a diversified business
section.
Local Employment.
Moreover, it is the aim of the City
Authorities to provide for employ-
ment facilities within the new com-
munity itself for as many of the inhab-
itants as possible. Apart from the
openings provided by the shops and
services at the business centre, Val-
lingby will also have its own indus-
trial centre of some 2,000,000 sq. ft.
Situated about f-mile from Vallingby,
it is now under construction. By the
middle of 1954 there will be initial
employment facilities for about 1500
persons, a number that will have
grown to 3000 a year later. A tent-
ative estimate puts the number of em-
ployable persons at one per household,
if the average household is taken to
be three persons. Thus, Vallingby,
when fully developed, will have about
8,000 employable persons, of whom
at least half are expected to find work
within the area, while as many again
will probably be employed there al-
though living elsewhere. There will
be no effort at regimentation in the
sense that people should be required
to live and work in the same area. Be-
sides the industries there are many
other opportunities for work, such as
a considerable number of shops, of-
fices and restaurants. There are also
two large hospitals in the vicinity.
Two projected garages for a total of
about 1200 cars, repair and service
shops, filling stations and subway stor-
age depots will also provide work for
a number of people. Schools, church
and the health and social services in-
crease the list of opportunities for
employment.
Safe Roads for the Children.
Vallingby is united with Stock'
holm’s centre by the new metropolis
tan underground railway opened a
year ago, and one of the main ap-
proaches to the highway to Vasteras
and Orebro—two large trading and in'
dustrial centres —passes through its
outskirts. The system of communica'
tions within the city presents some in-
teresting aspects. The network of
streets has been designed so that child-
ren should be able to walk anywhere
in the area without having to cross
the big motor roads. Vallingby being
situated in a hilly wooded terrain, it
has been possible to run underpass
parkways, prohibited to traffic, between
all parts of the city. Moreover, dairies
and grocery shops are to be found in
almost every quarter, children sent out
on errands thus not having to cross
the main road. The motor roads,
which have separate bicycle lanes, are
wide enough to permit of street park-
ing to a large extent.
Shop Space Sought After.
The community centre, located
round a piazza of about 100,000 sq.
ft., is built over the subway which
here passes above ground. Traffic will
be permitted on one half of the piazza,

WROUGHT IRON FURNITURE.
There has recently been a distinct vogue
for wrought iron furniture, both tor in-
ternal and external use. We illustrate
some recent American examples, the
table having a glass top. The Victorian
age was very partial to cast iron garden
furniture, the more ornate the better,
but with the revulsion against this orna-
ment it went completely out of fashion.
The pendulum is now swinging back
again, but in a very much more sub-
dued key.

AMERICAN BANK IN LONDON.
We Illustrate the interior of the West
End Branch of the Bank of America at
the corner of Davies St. and Grosvenor
St., London. Where the building is to
form only the ground floor of a six-
storey structure, and the architect has
no control over the design of the re-
maining floors, as is the case in this in-
stance, the task of achieving a design
incorporating dignity and modernity is
made more difficult. A feature of the
caught the turbulence at the moment of
banking chamber are the sunken light
wells that give an added affect of
height.

INTERLOCKING WALL BLOCKS
IN NEW FRENCH BUILDING SYSTEM
A new system “dry” house construe'
tion, invented by civil engineer Betim
as, was demonstrated at Grenoble in
September, 1952, and has been de'
scribed by P. Cottenet in the January,
1953, issue of “La Technique Mod'
erne —Construction.”
This so'called “Mont System” uses
agglomerated prismatic blocks, with a
cross'section reminiscent of an Tbeam
with broad flanges of different width.
The broader flanges form the extern'
al wall, whilst the smaller flanges serve
as anchor ties. The “web” of the
block has, on either side, two grooves
matching the anchor flange of other
blocks. The wall is built up of two
identical curtains facing and interlock'
ing each other, and leaving air cav'
ities between them. The wall con'
struction is thus reduced to the ele'
mentary process of piling up the pre'
cast blocks in toy'set fashion. By
staggering the levels, each block of
one curtain interlocks with four blocks
of the opposite curtain so that the
mechanical stability of the wall is per'
feet.
In addition to the standard wall
blocks, special blocks are required for
the construction of the wall corners
and the horizontal and vertical edges.
The “corner blocks” are like the
standard blocks, piled up vertically,
but they are filled with a lightly rein'
forced concrete so as to ensure the
perfect stability of the corner. In
contrast to the standard and corner
blocks which permanently remain part
of the structure, the “framing blocks”
are merely used as temporary form'
work for the concrete finishing of
the side posts, piers and lintels. If
desired, the framing blocks may be
recessed so as to obtain fillisters for
the woodwork of doors and windows.
The standard block measures 22 x
22 x 44 cm. (8| x 8-|- x 17iin.) and
weighs about 44 lb. The wall thick'
ness can be varied by using either one
or the other of the two interlocking
grooves provided in the web of the
blocks, the wall thickness being 34 cm.
(13fin.) in one case, and 28 cm.
(llin.) in the other. Even thicker
walls (46 cm. equals can be
obtained by adding a third curtain so
that the middle curtain interlocks with
both the outer ones. The party walls
consist of simple single'curtain blocks
of 10 cm. (nearly 4in.) thickness.
This method of dry construction
based on mechanical interlocking, re'
quires a certain standard of dimen'
sional accuracy in the manufacture of
the blocks. For the casting of these
blocks, a special vibration method is
being used which ensures accurate dh
mensions, a high degree of homo'
geneity in the material, and an excel'
lent surface finish which makes any
special after'treatment unnecessary.
The crushing strength of the ma'
terial is about 60 kgs. per sq. cm.
(860 lb. per sq. in.). The extra sta'
bility afforded by the piers and steel
reinforcement can be enhanced by US'
ing stronger concrete or by filling in
the air cavities, or by using a third
curtain, as already mentioned. Ow'
ing to the particular* interlocking sys-
tern, temperature expansion is easily
absorbed by the joints, and no special
measures are necessary. Acoustic and
thermal insulation are adequate and
can be improved by special measures
where there are special requirements.
Theoretical considerations, confirm'
ed by practical experience with 50
houses of this type, erected for miners
in the Dauphine mining district,
point to an overall saving of about 30
per cent., compared with the cost of
a traditionally built house.
THE NEW CULT STAIRS.
Even the simple staircase in the hands
of modern designers have undergone
some radical changes. In the upper ex-
ample the main weight of the stair is
taken on a central raking concrete beam
from which the treads and risers are
cantilevered at the sides where weights
are lightened. The lower example has
a handrail that would baffle small boys
who love to slide down them. The
horizontal members provide support tor
flower boxes that lend charm and in-
terest.

Classroom In the Pre-Sehool Development Centre. Brisbane.
Ivory Cane-ite walls make this one of the most attractive in
Australia also provide insulation against the heat of a
Brisbane summer. In Carlton, Victoria, you’ll find Cane-ite in
another pre-school centre keeping out intense cold in winter.
Ivory Cane-ite has excellent light reflection qualities, too.
Knitting Mills Interior Holeproof 1N.5.W.1, Rydalmere.
CANE-ITE was specially selected here because of its un-
equalled insulating ability — Holeproof's knitting rooms must
be kept at a constant temperature and humidity for the
operation of finely set knitting machinery. Cane-ite absorbs
noise also—lessens nerve strain, increases efficiency, outputs
PRE-FI NISH ED smooth surface of Ivory Cane-ite needs no further
decoration, gives excellent light reflection. Cane-ite is also obtainable
in natural suede-like finish, or primed, which needs no base coat.
EASY-TO-HANDLE. light, convenient sheets of Cane-ite Wallboard
come in ten sizes for quicker, easier construction.
SAVES INSULATION COSTS . . . half-an-inch of Cane-ite has insulating,
value equal to an 8-inch brick wall or 12 inches of concrete.

the other half being reserved for ped'
■estrians. In the buildings below and
around the central open space there
will be some 60 shops, including two
department stores, beauty and barber
shops, etc. There are also 400,000
sq. ft. of office premises. The City
authorities report that they have had
applications for space from 700 pros'
.pective lessees.
One of the advantages to be gain'
■ed in a city that is fully planned be'
fore the construction starts, and which
is built up within a comparatively
short period, is that certain heating
and sanitary services, usually handled
by individual caretakers, can be co'ord'
mated from the outset. Thus savings
in personnel and costs can be made,
especially when hot water and heating
pipes are laid down already before
the housing construction is commenc'
■ed. Ultimately the entire district of
Vallingby and adjacent suburbs will
have their heat and hot water sup'
plied by a planned new stearmpower
plant, which the City of Stockholm is
Dui.ding at Hasselby, a couple of miles
to the south of Vallingby. This plant
is to supply the City of Stockholm
with extra power for peakdoad periods,
the surplus heat being pumped to the
new suburbs in rockwoohinsulated
pipes, placed in large culverts which
have already been laid down. It is
citimated that the loss of heat from
plant to customer will be only about
10 deg. F.
Garbage Supplies Hot Water.
In the meantime, however, the
heating and hot water for the city
of Vallingby is handled by a provh
sional plant; at present there are three
automatic oihheated boilers, of which
only one or two are needed as yet,
but the plant is equipped for an ulth
mate number of six burners, convert'
ible to any kind of fuel. Further'
more, a huge garbage incinerator made
by the Gotaverken is at present being
installed, also filling the purpose of
supplying Vallingby with all its hot
water requirements. The incinerator
has a “Landsverk” stoker which is said
to be so perfect that bottles or tin cans
will not hamper its working as they
are reduced to dust in the process.
The incinerator is planned as a per'
manent installation. This plant is
largely automatized, having a special
tipping lift, which deposits the garb'
age and returns the containers with
the a:d of only one man. It is also
equipped with the most modern soot'
blowers and chimney draft regulators
of the Swedish make, known as the
’’Superior.”
The Vallingby project being the
first large'scale experiment of its type
in Sweden, it is viewed with a good
deal of apprehension by the author'
ities. However, judging by the inter'
est displayed by prospective inhabi'
tants, industrial enterprises and trades'
men, it looks as if the experiment,
which is being closely followed by
city planners in many countries, is
going to prove a success.
