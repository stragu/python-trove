Every convenience for efficient work is necessary in the modern
hospital to ensure smooth flowing operation. Just as essential are
ideal living-in conditions for nurses who after a strenuous tour of
duty like to relax in comfortable surroundings. At Adelaide Children’s
Hospital, the Nurse’s Home offers every type of amenity for nurses
“off duty” and not the least of these comforts is the two Otis Passenger
Lifts. Saving needless stair climbing and conserving energy, the Otis
lifts provide speedy service to all floors and play a vital part ir
making life comfortable for nurses “at home.”

Try the test at the right! It will prove to you
beyond all doubt that Masonite Tempered
Presdwood is 100% satisfactory for external
building applications. Not only is Tempered
Presdwood strongly moisture-resistant—it is far
more adaptable to your ideas of construction and
finish than any other board. You can bend Masonite,
punch it, saw it, plane it. Masonite is hard, smooth and
'rainless, with great structural strength and dimen-
-'oual stability. It takes and holds any applied finish.
BEFORE
Take a piece of
Masonite Tempered
Presdwood (write
for a sample if you
wish). Leave it in
a container of wate?
for as many days—or
months—or years—
as you like. Remove
the Tempered Presd-
wood occasionally
and check it against
a dry sample. You
will find that size,
stability, rigidity and
surface are com-
pletely unaffected by
the moisture.

dilion of the board, notwithstanding 31 days

The new "DULUX WALL COLOUR" GUIDE ensures

Until now colours had to be chosen from a colour
card, with only limited choice, or specially tinted
on the job, in an attempt to obtain a colour
vaguely described by the customer. Now the
thrilling, new and unbelievably lovely "DULUX

limitless. Your customer can "pin-point" the exact
colour desired, involving at most a simple blend-

The all-aluminium Kingstrand house can help to meet
the requirements of housing difficulties in many parts of
the world.
The lightness of the housing-unit enables easier handling
with a considerable saving in transportation and erection
costs.
The outstanding characteristics of aluminium include
high resistance to corrosive atmospheres, imperviousness
to termites and vermin and the ability to reflect a high
percentage of all radiant heat so that rooms can be kept
at more moderate temperatures in tropical areas.

OUR BEAUTIFUL QUEEN
QUEEN ELIZABETH II.
Trained from childhood to be Queen of the great British Commonwealth of Nations, Queen Elizabeth
II. looks "every inch a Queen" in this recent portrait. In her first Christmas broadcast in which she
carried on the tradition of her father and grandfather, she said: "At my Coronation I shall dedicate
mmyself to your service ... I want to ask you all, whatever your religion may be, to pray for me
on that day; to pray that God may give me wisdom and strength to carry out the solemn promises
I shall be making, and that I may faithfully serve Him and you all the days of my life. It is with
this high purpose and courage that she has stepped into the highest duties demanded by the Crown
with dignity, sincerity and charm, whilst still retaining the noble spirit of Motherhood and wifely
companionship for the man she has made her husband. In this picture taken against the window
curtains of the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace the Queen is wearing the Blue Ribbon
and Star of the Garter and a Russian fringe design diamond necklace (a wedding present from the
City of London), diamond drop earrings and two diamond bangles. On her head Is a diamond

which was reset for Queen Victoria and dates back much earlier. This was worn by the Queen
when she opened Parliament a few months ago.

THE QUEEN AND US
Significance of the Coronation.
Here is something that concerns
you, me, and every other member
of the great British Family of Na-
tions. On Tuesday the second
of June, 1953, Elizabeth 11. will
be crowned Queen by the Grace
of God of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and of her other Realms
and Territories. And she will be
the first Sovereign ever to be
specifically crowned as Queen of
Australia. Her titles have been
so rearranged that they will have
special application to each part of
the Commonwealth of Nations,
and Australia has agreed that for
Australians her titles will include
mention of the United Kingdom,
of Australia and of the term De-
fender of the Faith.
The Coronation will be the oc-
casion of great pomp and tradi-
tion. It will contain ritual that
goes back to the days of Charle-
magne (770 A.D.). It will also
be televised, signifying the blend-
ing of the ancient with the mod-
ern.
Behind all the celebration and
pomp there is a profound concep-
tion of great moral and spiritual
significance, and it is to that con-
ception that I suggest we turn our
thoughts now.
You will recall that in her
Christmas Day broadcast to her
people, Queen Elizabeth used
these words: “Pray that God may
give me wisdom and strength to
carry out the solemn promises I
shall be making and that I may
faithfully serve Him and you all
the days of my life. At my Cor-
onation next June I shall dedicate
myself anew to your service.”
Those are serious words, and
they have a serious message for
us. If our young Queen is pre-
pared to dedicate herself to our
service, is it not meet and fit that
we should strive to be worthy of
such selfless dedication? When
she pledges herself to a lifetime
of service on our behalf, do we
not owe her something in re-
turn? In making a return service
we really serve our country. I
suggest that we do give some-
thing in return.
But how shall we do it? By
striving to be better citizens, by
striving to help one another, by
remembering our duties and re-
sponsibilities to our homes, our
families and our fellow citizens.
The Queen is setting us an ex'
ample, and if we study the form
which her Coronation will take
we shall find how her example
affects us all. Let me try to ex-
plain to you some aspects of this
personal relationship.
Soon after she will enter West-
minster Abbey, in which all of
her 40 predecessors, except two —
(Edward V. and Edward VIII.)
—since William the Conqueror
have been crowned, and in which
she herself was wed on 20th No-
vember, 1947, she will turn to
the east, to the south, west and
north, so that everyone in the
Abbey can see her- The Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, who, by
the way, officiated at her wedding
ceremony, will then ask the con-
gregation whether it accepts her
as the lawful Sovereign.
The congregation will cry “God
Save Queen Elizabeth!” Now, in
doing that, the congregation will
speak on behalf of every one of
her many millions of subjects. It
will indicate that Queen Elizabeth
is the personal Sovereign of you,
and me, and all of us.
When she has been so acclaim-
ed, she will take a solemn oath.
The thing that concerns us most
about that oath is that she will
swear to govern the peoples of
her various realms and territories
“according to their respective laws
and customs.” This means that
she promises to govern as a con-
stitutional monarch according to
the laws which her peoples make
themselves. She becomes the
guardian of our rights and privil-
eges and liberties. It is to the
Crown that we look for protection
under a rule of law. The rule of
law is a fundamental British con-
cept stemming from the ethics of
Christianity, and on it is based
the constitutional character of the
Crown.
When the Queen takes part
in the ceremony of anointing, this
is one of the oldest parts of the
Coronation ceremony and reaches
back to Biblical times. Just as
King Solomon was anointed by
Zadok the priest and Nathan the
prophet, our Queen will be
anointed from the oldest part of
the Coronation regalia, the am-
pulla and spoon.
She will thus be consecrated to
her task under Divine guidance,
and will be answerable to God
for her rule. The Archbishop in
his prayer at the anointing will
ask for Divine aid for her and
for God’s blessing. At that mo-
ment we should remember that
we all have a duty to God, and
that if we are, too, to have God’s
blessing we should observe our
duty and obey His laws, the laws
on which our civilisation is built.
The ceremony takes on a furth-
er religious atmosphere after that.
The presenting of the Sword of
State indicates that, as well as
symbolising the righting of
wrongs and the exercise of jus-
tice, the Sword is to be put to
the service of the Church. The
Orb, which is next delivered, is
surmounted by a Cross, and this
indicates that the Christian relig-
19

ion dominates the world. There
are two sceptres, one being the
ensign of queenly power and jus'
tice and the other, which is call'
ed the rod of equity and mercy,
represents the Holy Ghost. To*
ward the end of the ceremony,
the Queen will be presented with
a Holy Bible as, I quote, “the
most valuable thing that this
world affords.”
Before that takes place, how'
ever, the most important tempos
al act in the whole ceremony will
be performed. That will be the
actual crowning of the Queen.
And here we experience another
personal contact with Her
Majesty.
The Archbishop will take the
Crown of St. Edward from the
Dean of Westminster, and, while
the Queen is sitting in the his'
toric Coronation Chair, made or'
iginally for Edward 1., will place
the Crown reverently on the
Queen’s head. That will be the
signal for cheering, trumpets and
cannon fire.
But it will also make the Queen
the symbol of unity throughout
her vast territories. She will be,
in some cases, the only bond be'
tween the members of the Com'
monwealth family.
The bond is strong, however,
and if she can hold together so
many classes and creeds and
races, could not her example spur
us to greater unity among our'
selves as Australians? What unity,
you may ask. We may have our
differences, but they are provid'
ed for under our form of derm
ocracy, of which the Queen is
the head. More compelling fac'
tors tend to bring us together.
We need unity in the faoe of
danger, we need a realisation that
we have a duty to defend the
community and to preserve for
our children that which was given
to us, that we have a duty to deal
fairly with our fellows, a duty to
ourselves of honest work, and a
duty to the development of a true
community spirit. If we perform
these duties we shall be achiev'
ing the unity which the Queen
represents.
After the crowning the Queen
will be enthroned, and then she
will receive the fealty or alleg'
iance of the Church leaders and
the homage due to a liege lady
from the temporal peers. In their
homage they represent all of us.
And as we pay homage, let us
remember that the Queen has
dedicated herself to the service
of the Commonwealth. That
means you and me. Let us then
dedicate ourselves to the service
of the Queen.

Wilson Hall
Has Something
To Demolish Or Not.
A controversy second only to the
Olympic Games site Donnybrook has
been raging in Melbourne in whether
the famous Wilson Hall at Melbourne
University that had been severely
damaged by fire should be restored to
its pristine Gothic brilliance or
whether it should be demolished to
make way for a new hall designed in
the contemporary style.
A decision to demolish was ap'
parently made and the wreckers start'
ed and then, as the south wall tumbled
down, the storm broke afresh and
work was stoppfed.
The fact that the “solid oak” beams
were found to be Oregon upset some,
but as “Cross Section,” issued by the
University of Melbourne Department
of Architecture, says: “The whole
Gothic Revival building was false.”
In view of this statement it is sur'
prising to read further and hear these
progressive young minds add: “But it
was a pretty, picturesque fake and one
of the only buildings in the University
capable of arousing affection.”
Perhaps it is propinquity that has
allowed the head to be ruled by the
heart.

YORK MOTORS PTY. LTD.
NEW BUILDING, KENT ROAD, MASCOT.
Architects:
C. C. Brewster & Murray.
Master Builders:
Hornibrook, McKenzie Clark Pty. Ltd.
The site for this new industrial unit
for York Motors Pty. Ltd. is close to
the northern boundary of Mascot Air
Terminal, and is of built'up ground,
having previously been used for market
gardens.
The problem was to provide 30,000
square feet of uninterrupted and natU'
rally lighted floor space for motor as'
sembly, together with a small office
section and employee welfare facilities.
A fundamental part of the problem
was to utilise “Clearspan” arch seg'
ments which the clients had already
purchased. Because of proximity to
one of the aircraft approaches to Mas'
cot, the height of the building was
restricted by the Department of Civil
Aviation.
Planning.
The introduction of an open mezza'
nine level for employees’ dining em
abled all subsidiary functions to be
grouped in a comparatively small area,
and enabled more space to be devoted
to the main function of assembly.
By supporting the 150 ft. clearspan
prefabricated arches on reinforced con'
crete abutments stiffened in both
directions with reinforced concrete tie
beams, it was possible to reduce the
overall height and provide a monitor
type lantern which greatly increased
the natural lighting and ventilation.
The steel arches springing from sft.
above finished floor level do not iiv
terfere with the assembly process, and

roof extending from the junction of
the first and second arch segments to
a height of 10ft. at the wall face em

ables the space between arches to be
profitably used.
Construction.
Fourteen slightly cambered arch seg'
ments each 12ft. long bolt together to
span 150 ft. and bear upon reinforced
concrete abutments.
The front wall of the building is of
reinforced concrete and supports a
continuous beam carrying the bulk'
head end stanchions of the arches,
while timber girts bolted to the end
stanchions proivde fixing for the glaz'
ing bars and glazing. Brick walls with
timber boxTrame type windows are
used along the side and rear walls,
whilst above the windows on the rear
elevation deep corrugated asbestos
cement is used to lessen the western
sunlight.
The interior walls of the amenities
are of normal brick construction, ah
though the office partitions are con'
structed of flush timber panels with
glass above. To prevent excessive
noise entering the offices, acoustic
treatment has been used on the office
ceilings. The lantern light is framed
with timber and contains fixed glass in
glazing bars and units of fixed louvres
in each bay for permanent ventilation,

acter, will embody the results of the latest developments in lighting colour, materials and construction.

New Infants’ School, Bexley North, Sydney
MODERN INFANT TEACHING.
Great changes over the past two
decades have taken place in the educa-
tion of children and infants. Great
changes also have come about in the
school buildings in which these new
methods and conditions are practised.
Every aspect has been the subject of
the most minute study, and to-day the
modern school is indeed a credit to
our education system.
A new development is the segrega-
tion of the kindergarten building from
the other school buildings so that the
very young can pursue their simple,
leisurely way undisturbed by the mis-
chievous intentions of their older col-
leagues.
One of the most recent of these
new Infants’ Schools has recently been
completed at Bexley North, and we
take pleasure in illustrating it in action
training happy and healthy young
Australians. It is a brick structure of
two storeys.
The main entrance leads from a ter-
race giving access to both the Ad-
ministration offices on the one side and
the Assembly Hall on the other, the
former unit comprising an office for
the Headmistress, a waiting alcove for
the public, a staff common room, and
the requisite staff toilets.
North-easterly Aspect.
There are in all nine classrooms and
a kindergarten room, and all have a
north-easterly aspect. The classrooms
on the Ground Floor have three light
windows opening from the floor for
direct access to wide terraces, so that
classes may be conducted in the open
during suitable weather. The Assem-
bly Hall is 60ft. x 30ft,, with a 10ft.
wide stage at one end. It is fitted
with light-proof curtains and is divided
from the kindergarten room by fold-
ing partitions in order to give ready
access to the former for exercises and
games by the younger children.
A feature in the planning of these
new buildings is to provide a self-
contained kindergarten unit away from
the main body of the school in order
that the older children may be kept
separate and have their own entrance
lobby for hats and coats, washroom
and toilet. The kindergarten room
opens to a wide terrace for outdoor
exercises. To minimise noise, acoustic
ceilings have been provided through-
out the corridors and classrooms.
A large shelter shed, tuckshop,
washrooms and toilets for the children
are conveniently located at a lower
ground floor level with direct access
both from within the building and
from the playing areas. Large paved
assembly areas are arranged on the
northern side of the building with
direct entrance to both the ground
and upper floors.
Special attention has been given to
the general interior decoration, and
the colour scheme is in light pastel
shades throughout the building. The
kindergarten room has the various
cupboards arranged along one wall in
varying colours to provide a more ap-
pealing atmosphere for the younger
children.

Brisbane City Council
INTEGRATED DESIGN
POWER PLANT.
Tennyson.
On April 15th the first unit of the
Brisbane Cit” Council’s 10,000 kW.
Integrated Design Power Plant was
officially placed in service. The second
unit has since been completed and the
station is now operating at full capa'
city. The plant is situated at Tenny'
son on the upper reaches of the Bris*
bane River and will greatly assist in
alleviating power shortages which
Brisbane in common with other cities
of Australia has experienced for some
time.
The official opening, at which 120
guests were in attendance, took place
at the Station, where Mr. R. W.
Campbell, Joint Manager and Director
of A.G.E., invited the Chairman of
the Transport and Electricity Commit'
tee of the Brisbane City Council,
Alderman W. C. Coutts, to formally
accept and place in commission the
first unit of the Station. Mr. H. H.
George, Joint Manager and Director
of A.G.E., was present. Mr. J. J.
Convery, of the International General
Electric Company, N.Y., welcomed
the guests and congratulated the Chief
Engineer and Manager of the Brisbane
City Council Electricity Department
and his Staff on the splendid work
they had performed in placing this
Station in operation in such a short
period of time.
The plant was supplied by the In'
ternational General Electric Company,
U.S.A., and the major components
consist of two 5,000 kW., 3,000 r.p.m.
General Electric turbine generators
operating at 400 lbs. per square inch
gauge and 750 degrees total tempera-
ture. Steam for these units is sup-
plied bv two 70,000 lb. per hour oil-
fired steam generators manufactured by
Foster Wheeler Corporation, U.S.A.
Power venerated at 11 kV. is sup-
plied to the transmission system of
the Brisbane City Council from these
units through three General Electric
Company’s 4,000 kVA. 11/33 kV.
single-phase outdoor transformers and
appropriate 11 kV. and 33 kV. switch-
gear. The contract included the sup-
ply of everything making up the
Station with the exception of cement
and window glass.
It is of particular note that the
whole of the equipment was manufac-
tured, delivered, erected and placed in
service within two years after receipt
of the order. The erection itself was
completed slightly over seven months’
time and this feat was due in a large
measure to the aggressive manner in
which the work was pursued by the
Electricity Department of the Brisbane
City Council.
The erection of the plant was super-
vised by Mr. A. T. Brice, Project
Manager, Mr. J. Andrews, Turbine
Erection Supervisor, both from the
General Electric Company, U.S.A.,
and Mr. F. Barco of the Foster
Wheeler Corporation. Valuable assis-
tance was also rendered by Mr. D.
Monson, Turbine Erection Supervisor
of the General Electric Company, Mr.
R. R. Dewey, Foster Wheeler Cor-
poration, and Mr. R. Stovell of the
Bailey Motor Company.

”MY BLOOD BOILS”
WRITES FLORENCE M. TAYLOR
ABOUT SYDNEY’S TRAFFIC PROBLEMS.
For fifty years ever-increasing num-
bers of motor cars and lorries have
been on Sydney’s roads that were
made for the few, slow horse-drawn
vehicles fully abundant years ago.
For fifty years successive govern-
ments and city councillors have wrung
their hands in despair, because they
haven’t known what to do about halt-
ing the ever-increasing congestion.
Their only idea has been to sup-
press the motor cars’ activitiy. To
cope with it? Nothing could be fur-
ther from their thoughts.
Now they are endeavouring to in-
troduce a plan to restrict the natural
growth of the city. By a law, dating
back to 1940, one is permitted to use
only 35% of one's land for building
purposes for a 3-storey building, 40%
for 2-storeys, and 50% for a 1-storey
building. This alone puts Sydney’s
progress back 100 years. The balance
of the area can run to weeds or be
the repository of empty bottles and
tin cans.
We must raise our voices in protest.
This fine city belongs to us, the
people. Aldermen and Politicians now
framing laws to stop its growth are in
power for a limited period, to guard
it not to bludgeon it to death simply
because they don’t know what to do
in the matter. Crass ineptitude can-
not be permitted to take the place of
highly skilled knowledge required for
such profound problems with which
they have been entrusted. Curtail-
ment of traffic facilities, of building
space, of other developments is a
most retrograde step.
Until we bring* sound knowledge
to light we will not be able to build
our cities to service the people as
they should be serviced.
What we want at the head of affairs
to handle our problems are Architects,
Builders and Engineers.
But where are these people?
Shame on them for quietly attend-
ing to their jobs without even putting
up a fighting attitude against all this
display of ineptitude in civic affairs
that is now overtaking us.
Private enterprise built this city.
It belongs to them and the people
they serve. It does not belong solely
to those who have been appointed to
administer over it for a limited per-
iod. Once again I must quote Ruskin:
“The earth is lent to us for life. It
is a great entail. It belongs as much
to those who come after us as it does
to us and we have no right by any-
thing we do or leave undone to in-
volve them in penalties which it was
in our power to bequeath.”
We quote America as an example
to the world in handling traffic prob-
lems.
Chicago.
Chicago is an Industrial and Smoky
place. 135 years years ago it was a
mudhole. It was called “The Windy
City which it still is. 55 years ago
only 1,000,000 people lived within 5
miles of its centre. Three years ago
we saw 6,500 cars parked in a car
park on the Lake shore. It is
912 miles from New York, 2,271
from San Francisco. It covers'2l3 sq.
mdes and has capacity-built suburbs,
highly industrial, some are residential.
It made its land by resuming sand
from the lakes, in much about the
same way that Rio de Janeiro made
ner land by levelling down her moun-
tains. Now, Chicago has wide boule-
vardes, scenic outerdrives, some of
them like the Wacker Drive, being
double decked and flanked with fine
buildings.
T ransport.
It has the largest railway terminal
m the world with 22 trunk lines of
railroads, none of which run through
Chicago. 1,500 passenger trains are
handled there daily. Freight is
handled by 17 outerbelt lines around
the city. Within Chicago’s industrial
area are 8,000 miles of railroad track.
Two airports of 620 acres, an Inter-
national Airport of 4,500 acres look
after aerial traffic. There is a landing
strip on the beach and within a 20
miles radius there is a score of other
airports. There is a helicopter service
from the post office.
The port includes an outer harbour
of 1300 acres protected by breakwat-
ers. J 3 steamship lines carry vessels
over made routes of waterway con-
necting the Mississippi River and the
Gulf Ports built in 1933.
It is the hub of great motor trucks
and provides a daily scheduled service
to 24,000 communities.
[These are not taxed out of exist-
ence as they are in Australia because
they compete with a Government own-
ed non-paying railway system. Amer-
ica shed her Government-owned rail-
way system years ago when they were
not paying propositions. They are
paying handsomely under private en-
terprise from which the Government
gets far more in taxation than they
would ever have received by running
the railways as a Government con-
cern.]
The City has a complete motor bus
system, a noisy, elevated railway
(which has served its life of useful'
ness and is now due for demolition),
surface trolley lines and subway sys'
tem.
A system of underground freight
lines operates on 60 miles of narrow
gauge track laid 50ft. below the
ground about 45 years ago.
Population and Building.
Chicago proper is a considerable
city of 3,620,962 people (1950 Gen-
sus). Seventy years ago it had
503,185 people [such as we had in
Sydney way back in 1910. We had
only reached a million in 1922 and it
has taken us all this time, 31 years, to
reach 2,000,000, during which time
we have done nothing in terms of
providing transport for the ever-in-
creasing numbers].
Greater Chicago has now 5,495,364
people.
Its main business section is crowd'
ed into £-mile rectangle bounded
tracks of elevated railroad (“the
loop ) on which Banks, Insurance
Companies, Stock Exchange, Board
of Trade, etc., are crowded.
Michigan Boulevarde is lined with
giant skyscrapers facing Grant Park
in a densely settled block of 8 sq.
miles. The city thins out as it merges
into the suburbs. The Medical Gen-
tre is the most congested spot.
Its activities are terrific, entailing
much traffic movement. The Post
Office built in 1934 at a cost of
=£10,000,000 handles 35,000,000 letters
daily and 500,000 sacks of parcels.
The Merchandise Mart on 93 acres
of floor space is the largest building
in the world owned by one man and
is second in size only to the Wash'
mgton Pentagon. It cost £15,000,000
to build in 1930. Children under 12
are not allowed in this building, and it
is not possible to buy a single thing.
It is just a show mart.
There is not a vestige of congestion
in servicing these enormous buildings.
The Palmolive Building, 37 stor'
eys, is topped by a 2,000,000 candle-
power beacon, the largest in the world,
rotating twice a minute.
The Board of Trade has 43 storeys
and it is topped with a 31ft. modern
statue of Ceres, Goddess of Wheat.
Civic Opera Building 555 ft. high,
completed in 1929, seats 3,800 people.
Its immense stage is 13 storeys high.
These are all things to be proud of.
Parks and Boulevardes.
When we have a few thousand
people attending our sports we feel
very distressed about the handling of
the traffic, yet the Golden Field in
Burnham Park, Chicago, seats
120,000 people, who are all cared for
from a transport point of view with-
in less than an hour.

[I guarantee one could not find a

There is a Bandshell in Grant Park
for open air concerts. When I was in
Chicago 40 years ago, 5,000 chairs
were moved on to the grass in the
day time so that people could enjoy
the music in the open air in comfort

on “made land” where sand was
pumped in and debris dumped to
raise this strip of land above the lake

U.S. SUPREME COURT BUILDING AT WASHINGTON.
Wherever one goes in America one sees fine, impressive buildings, expressive of their functions in
well-considered and beautiful settings. This building, designed by the late Cass Gilbert, is of white
marble with flanking wings. It was completed in 1935. Entrance steps are flanked by two allegorical
figures, one representing "Abstract Justice" and the other "The Execution of its Decrees." The
building contains a memorial hall, courtrooms, suites of offices for justices, rooms for international
conferences and offices for the Attorney General and his staff. Over its entrance the inscription
reads: "Equal Justice Under Law," about which we may be pardoned if we wonder if we are
slipping, when we see the liberality of our awards and compare them with equal justice." Our
soldiers come back from the war, maimed, and for defending their country they receive but a
tithe of what joymakers riding pillion on bikes receive when they come to grief m a road accident.
The rewards they receive would set them up for life and leave an abundance for their offspring
to inherit.

and 200 miles of hiking trails in the
forest preserves.
Now all of this would require a
terrific amount of money for upkeep,
yet if money has to be found it is
found and people take a pride in their
possessions. [lf any suggested inv
proving in Australia costs money, the
scheme is pigeonholed.]
In 1938 there were 9,921 manufac'
turing firms employing 484,000 em-
ployees which rose to 2,300,000 work'
ers in World War 11., which is great'
er than we have in the whole of
Sydney. There are 200 Trade and
Technical papers, 60 foreign language
newspapers, 150 of . the largest banks
in the world. It boasts of the great'
est sanitary system, the greatest filtra'
tion plant. All the water is chlorin'
ated at the pumping stations against
bacteriological pollution. [lt is hor'
rible to drink the stuff .Our water
is much better.]
Bridges.
Chicago owns and maintains 61
movable bridges, 25 fixed bridges, and
there are 13 other bridges and 109
viaducts.
These figures are quoted to show
there are no engineering difficulties in
traffic problems that cannot be over'
come. If things have to be done,
they simply do them.
Our authorities on the other hand
lack courage to do anything. They
suffer with fear. It is a fear to tackle
anything which is born of ignorance
of the subjects the city is calling upon
them to handle.
We cannot teach people anything.
We can only draw out what is in them,
and evidently engineering is not in
them or they would be revelling in
it. They ought to step down and
leave someone who knows how to
handle problems carry on. All our
transport problems would be child’s
play to Engineers.
New York City.
New York, once a Royal Province
of England, was named after the
Duke of York in about 1670.
In 1880 the population of New
York was 1,911,698. About equal to
Sydney’s present population.
Famous Bridges.
In 1898 it had just one bridge.
Now with a population of 7,891,957
(1950 census) it has 62 large bridges.
New York did not seek to stunt her
city’s growth, as they are endeavour'
ing to do here. They sold vacant
spaces “from heaven to hell’’ and
these words were embodied in some
of the deeds that I have actually seen.
They could build all over the land
they had paid for, if they wanted to
build that way [not over 35% of
the land, such as we are now imposing
on Sydney’s property owners, because
unimaginative controllers, temporarily
in power, have become self'righteous
are now taking steps to bring into
law the machinery to enable them to
continue the process of destroying
the built'up assets of this great city.]
No, the Americans did not seek to
curtail the development of their cities,
or destroy their assets after they
had been built because traffic problems
bothered them. They got busy with
their traffic problems as they arose —
and solved them.
Yes, in 63 years [while Sydney has
built one large arch bridge of 1650
feet span, or 3,770 feet, if we include
approaches], the New Yorkers have
built 62 bridges over one river, and
more wherever required which em'
braced reclamations, twistings and
turnings of enormous size. They re-
quired engineering skill and a know-
ledge of the land resumption [such
as our own Dr. Bradfield had, but
which unfortunately for us, no other
engineer in Sydney has been given a
chance to exercise his skill upon, be'
cause those at the head of affairs have

CIVIC OPERA BUILDING.
Occupies one block where the Wacker two-level street serves it on the Chicago
River front, Washington Street and Madison Street with bridges over the River
serve it on two sides and Franklin Street at the rear. It has 26 lifts. It was built
by Samuel Insul in 1928 and Is known as "Samuel Insul’s Folley." It is stated locally
he swindled a lot of people out of money and ran away before it was finished.
Its gold leaf is so resplendent that it is described by modernists as "Ginger Bread
and Wedding Cake architecture," but we have often heard of "Pearls being cast
before swine," and there would be a number who could never appreciate anything
quite as beautiful from an architectural point of view as may be seen in this
building. The stage of the Opera House accommodates 1,000 persons and it goes
up to 15 storeys in the building.

The single span of the George
Washington suspension bridge over

ers are 625 ft. tall. Bronx-Whitstone
Suspension Bridge (span only) is
2,300 ft. The Bronx Bridge carried
19,678,000 vehicles in one year.
New York also built tunnels to cat-
er for their traffic, when bridges could
no longer cope with it.
The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel
Authority report that the structures
over which they officiate consume
14% of their revenue, which in 1951
totalled $27,000,000 (£A. 12,000,000)
derived from 113,046,037 vehicles.
The Holland Tunnel under the
Hudson is 9,250 ft. long, 5,480 feet
of which is under water.
The Lincoln Tunnel is 8,000 ft.
The Brooklyn Battery Vehicular Tun-
nel is 9,117 feet, and is comprised of
twin tunnels. Air changes at the rate
of 25,000 tons of fresh air per hour
keep its atmosphere pure. It cost
$84,000,000 (£A.37,300,000). I was
in New York when these twin tunnels
were opened on May 25, 1950, and
before I left, one week later, a sec-
ond tunnel had been started elsewhere
to ease the traffic pressure in New
York City.
The Battery Park underpass opened
on 10th April, 1951, has two vehicu-
lar tunnels, 3,200 feet long. It car-
ries 13,388,000 vehicles in a year.
The Queens-Midland Tunnel is old-
er. It was opened in 1940 and is
6,200 ft. long and goes down to 95
ft. below East River. It has two tuj?es
31ft. wide and carried 15,057.317
vehicles in 1951.
Airports,
La Guardia airport, built in 1939,
cost <£22,000,000. It covers 558 acres.
But because it could only handle 60
operations an hour Idlewild, covering
3,276 acres was opened in 1948. It
is approached by vehicular traffic by
underground routes from all direc-
tions. There is no surface traffic lead-
ing to this airport.
Then there is the Floyd Bennett
Airport, the Newark Airport, the Pet-
erborough Airport.
In 1951 they built a new ’bus ter-
minal—the largest in the world—and
that is how their traffic problems are
handled.
Greater New York’s population is
13,000,000, and would thus be six
times the size of Greater Sydney.
Therefore, by this standard Sydney,
if we were progressive, should possess
one-sixth of New York’s facilities. We
haven’t a tithe of them.
There are 241 Parks in 5 boroughs
not including squares and triangles
at street intersections. There are ten
18-hole golf courses, 17 swimming
pools, and 6 beaches.
New York Central Park has 840
acres, in which one is not permitted
to smoke. It contains a menagerie,
the Metropolitan’ Museum of Art,
which is visited yearly by 5,000,000
and Cleopatra’s Needle, which came
from Egypt, its fellow obelisk is on
the Thames embankment in London.
The parks are replete with memorials,
statues and busts treated with respect,
as they are all over America.
The 39-storey Secretarial Building
recently erected cost $100,000,000
(£A. 44,000,000). Broadway is the
main thoroughfare of the business sec-
tion which has taken 150 years to de-
velop. It is only 80ft. wide for the
most part.

These figures are quoted merely to
show that with so many people and
so many things they consume and
handle yearly, that the traffic problems
must be immense indeed, particularly
when it is realised that the widest
thoroughfare, Broadway, is only 80
feet wide for most of the way. Yet,
they can all handle their problems.
Mostly, services are underground -
garbage and mail have their own spe-
cial tunnels with unattended trucks
automatically working. These services
do not block up the roadway. And
because of this we block the future
progress of our city.
We should say “thank you’’ to all
the big merchants of Sydney who, by
their enterprise, • have built it up to
its present standard and beauty and
prosperity which will enable us to
forge ahead in providing them with
transport facilities, to enable them to
carry on, prosper and enrich the city
by further developing .it. They have
done a noble work. They should be
lauded, not blamed, and helped, not
frustrated.
Union Claim on
Coronation Day
The Building Workers’ Industrial
Union and the Australian Builders
Labourers Federation recently sought
to have the carpenters and bricklayers
and the builders’ labourers awards var'
ied to provide an additional paid pub'
lie holiday for Coronation Day, which
has been proclaimed a public holiday
on 2nd June, 1953.
The builders’ labourers claim came
before Conciliation Commissioner
Galvin in Melbourne on 14th May,
when the Commissioner stated in his
summing up, that he proposed to dis'
miss the application.
Mr. Justice de Baun also refused
the claim on behalf of carpenters and
bricklayers, holding that it was a sub'
stituted day and already covered by
the relevant award.
Mr. W, D. Ford, Secretary of the
Master Builders’ Association of
N.S.W., said that so far as building
trades awards are concerned, Corona'
tion Day is merely a substitution for
Queen’s Birthday, and as such it is a
normal public holiday provided for in
the loaded rates.
Employees who are called upon to
work on that day would receive pay'
ment at the rate of double time, and
employees who do not work would not
be paid, as is the case with other
public holidays.
AMERICA'S SENTIMENT.
America is rich in memorials to honour

THE LISTER BLACKSTONE GREY IRON FOUNDRY
NEW STANDARDS IN MECHANISED AND PRECISION PRODUCTION.
Officially Opened by Governor of N.S.W., Gen. Sir John Northcott.
The industrial importance of the
completion of the Lister Blackstone
Grev Iron Mechanised Foundry at St.
Peters, Sydney, was emphasised by the
fact that the Governor of N.S.W.,
General Sir John Northcott, consented
to perform the official opening cere'
monv on April 14th, 1953.
Sir Percy Lister, present head of the
Lister enterprise, which dates back to
1867, when Robert Ashton Lister be'
gan manufacturing farm implements
in a smithy in Dursley, Gloucester'
shire, England, was also present, hav'
ing come especially to Australia for
the opening.
The new foundry, claimed to be as
modern as any in the world, presents
a striking contrast with the old type
foundry, which was hot, dirty, grimy
and haphazard.
To'day, all that is changed in this
modern marvel of mechanisation.
There are no great spurts of searing
flame; temperatures in the foundry it'
self are moderate; cleanliness and
order are the corollary to swift, sciem
tific production. Heavy toil is taken
from the backs of men and placed on
machines where it belongs.
Daylight streams through a scien'
tifically constructed roof, without glare
or direct sunlight; walls are ofTwhite;
equipment is grey and green, restful
to the eyes; and rails carrying moving
equipment are a contrasting yellow.
Tiled shower rooms, lockers and
change rooms provide amenities second
to none in the foundry industry.
Most Modem Technique
in the World.
The design and layout of the foum
dry are based upon the parent com'
pany’s long experience in foundry
mechanisation and a study of the most
modern techniques developed in
Europe and the United States of
America.
A unique feature is the raised floor.
There are no tunnels and few pits.
This method of construction permits
easy servicing of equipment as well as
the storage of finished castings and
some raw materials. The majority of
these latter are brought right into the
foundry by road or rail and are trans'
ferred directly to the bins. Magnetic
and mechanical elevating systems carrv
raw materials to the service bins for
weighing prior to furnace charging.
Each furnace is equipped with the
latest wet'type dust and spark sup'
pressors which completely prevent any
pollution of the atmosphere.
Scientific Control.
The metallurgical laboratory enables
absolutely exact control of metal
samples being continuously taken for
analysis. Equipment includes a camera
microscope, giving up to 2000 mag'
nifications, and a ring'weight air'
damped analytical balance which
measures instantaneously to an accu'
racy of one'tenth of a milligram.
Charging the Cupolas.
Two balanced blast cupola type ful'
naces, standing 80ft. 6in. above ground
level, are used alternately. They are
fitted with control equipment which
provides immediate guidance for melt'
ing temperatures. Any grade of cast
iron can be manufactured. Automatic
weighing ensures rigid control of the

pig iron, scrap, limestone and special
metals which comprise the charge.
Smooth, Speedy Flow
of Production.
The whole aim is high-speed repeti-
tion production of high-grade castings
at the lowest possible cost. The moulds
to metal, not the old metal to moulds,
principle cuts handling to a minimum.
The pouring station is adjacent to
the cupolas to which electrically ope-
rated hoists return the ladles on an
overhead monorail for refilling, thus
maintaining metal temperatures within
the correct range and greatly simplify-
ing handling of the hot metal.
The moulding system is entirely
mechanical. Machines are used in
pairs, allowing the employment of
teams of three men for maximum
efficiency; half boxes are moulded on
each of the machines and are matched
on the roller conveyor, resulting in
exceptionally high output from each
machine.
These modern moulding machines
allow the use of a wide range of box
sizes and, therefore, ensure the maxi-
mum output of metal per box.
The speed of the mould conveyor
can be regulated to suit the size and
continuity of the moulds. The moulds
proceed from the pouring station
through an elaborate fume and heat
extraction system to the “shake-out.”
Installed in parallel is a special
mould conveyor permitting heavy sec-
tion casting to cool sufficiently before
being shaken out.
Superfine Finish.
The system sand is carefully select-
ed to provide a superfine finish to
meet the most exacting demands. Con-
tinuous scientific sand control is car-
ried out by experts with Australian
and overseas experience, aided by a
well-equipped sand laboratory, devoted
entirely to sand analysis and testing.
Continuous Sand System.
An important economy factor is
that sand is used over and over again
in a continuous circulatory system.
Surplus sand from the moulding
machines and from the “shake-out,”
from which metal is automatically ex-
tracted by magnets, is conveyed back
into the main storage hoppers. It is
then rejuvenated in the sand mill by
the necessary addition of new in-
gredients and goes again into produc-
tion of new moulds.
The castings are taken by conveyer
to the fettling area, being cooled en
route. Here they are cleaned and
dressed by the latest methods and care-
fully inspected prior to delivery to the
customer.
Sir Percy Lister.
In the course of his remarks, in
which he thanked the Governor for
his graciousness in performing the
opening ceremony, Sir Percy Lister
said:
“We have a very fine, fully media*
nised foundry at our Dursley Factory,
with a capacity some six times greater
than this, which was opened in 1936
and, at that time, was regarded as the
most modern foundry in Europe, and
we have spared no effort to keep it
up-to-date within the limits provided
by the initial structure, but for work*
ing conditions and ease of maintenance
we have to take second place to you
here at St. Peters, and from the
sample castings which have come
home from here you are already
giving us food for thought in this
connection as a friendly, yet competi-
tive, spirit prevails throughout the
the consulting electrical engineers, and
tories.”
“In the past, the foundry has always
been considered the rough, dirty and
least congenial of the various activities
of the engineering industry, but to-
day, as I think you will appreciate
when you walk round, it is demon*
etrated that it can be one of the
cleanest and healthiest of jobs, but it

will only be as clean and healthy as
those who work in it keep it and want
it to be. Like a well-kept home, where
the housekeeping is good, so here at
St. Peters, with the great start this
foundry gives you, you should make
your housekeeping so good as to set
a new high standard in Australian in'
dustrial working conditions. If you
do, be assured you will not only have
happier and healthier working con-
ditions but you will never fail to be
proud of showing them to others, and
you will go forward from day to day

South Australia’s Building Boom.
The housing shortage, which has
kept South Australian builders busy
since the war, is easing, but homes are
likely to be scarce for some years.
In some Adelaide suburbs spectao
ular population increases have kept
pace with the step'up at an evenin'
creasing pace.
In the six months Tuly to Decemb'
er, 1952, 4843 houses worth £11,459,'
000 were erected in S.A.—the highest
rate of building since the boom began.
During 1945'46, 1349 houses were
built in S.A. at a cost of £1,233,000.
Annual totals since are: 1946'47,
2242 houses for £2,355,000; 1947'48,

Much of the increased construction
came through the Housing Commis'

Continent. It contains 31 suites and, on the ground floor, a dining room, beauty
salon, garages and shopping centre are included. The larger flats combine profes-
sional rooms with private accommodation, many being leased to doctors. Area
of standard suite is 1325 sq. ft. Architect Frederick Romberg was given a free
hand by the owners who only specified a modern design and the greatest possible
natural light—surely an architect's dream.

New Sanitarium
Nurses’ Home
Spacious, Well-Equipped Quarters.
Recent additions to the Sanitarium
Hospital in Fox Valley Road, Wah-
roonga, provide an excellently design-
ed 126-room nurses’ home with mod-
ern facilities. It was built by H. W.
Thompson Pty. Ltd., Sydney Master
Builders.
This modern, splendidlv'equipped
nurses’ home is undoubtedly a syrm
bol of the progress made by the Sani'
tarium Hospital, which is the largest
private hospital in N.S.W., specialis'
ing in medical, maternity and surgh
cal nursing.
Our representative was last week
afforded the opportunity of inspect'
ing the new home, which was plan'
ned on the most modern lines by
David W. King and Associates, Ar'
chitects, Sydney, to accommodate a
nursing personnel of 126 in single
rooms.
Commanding Position.
The new home occupies a coni'
manding position at the rear of the
hospital in Fox Valley Road, and it
overlooks, from a considerable alti-
tude, the Parramatta district and be-
yond.
The vista from the spacious sun-
deck, is a glorious one, and at night
it presents a panorama of twinkling
lights like a vast jewelled carpet.
The building comprises three and a
half floors (see illustration), with 42
bedrooms on the top floor, 26 on the
second floor, 42 on the ground floor,
and 16 in the lower basement portion.
Each floor has its own alhelectric
kitchenettes (see illustration) where
nurses may prepare their own meals
when off duty, and snacks and suppers
whenever desired.
There are also spacious bathroom
and toilet blocks on each floor, equip-
ped with every possible requirement,
including hair sprays. Each of these
blocks is finished in tiles with individ-
ual colour schemes.
Colour Motifs.
In fact, colour plays a very import-
ant part. A hospital official explained
“that there are six different colour
schemes used in bedroom furnishings
on each floor, and of the 42 bedrooms
on the top and ground floors, only
seven had the same curtains, bed-
spreads and floor colourings.
“This brings the true atmosphere
of home to our staff,” the official add-
ed.

A novel way of furnishing the
rooms was adopted by the hospital
authorities. They appealed to ex-pat-

ients to donate a sum of money suffi'
cient to furnish a bedroom, with the
result that 70 people provided enough
money to fully furnish 126 bedrooms,
at a cost of £l5O each for sisters’ bed'
rooms, and £llO for each nurses’ bed'
room.
The names of the donors are in'
scribed on neat plates attached to the
bedroom doors, as a constant remind'
er to all of their generosity.
A spacious nurses’ lounge and sis'
ters’ lounge is yet to be furnished,
as funds permit.
“We offered ex'patients a tangible
way of showing their gratitude for our
nursing care,” the hospital official
said, adding “The result far exceeded
our expectations!”
Construction of the Nurses’ Home
commenced in May, 1950, and the
building was dedicated on Decembei

gathering.

“Little or Nothing
To Learn”
A Parable With a Portent.
And so it came to pass that Caliph
Cahill left his Hot'Air Castle” in
Macquarie Street, and departed on the
“Oronsay” to see for himself how
much the rest of the world could
learn from Sydney.
“I shall return unto the fold satis'
fied that Sydney has nothing to learn
from the mighty world beyond our
coastline,” Caliph Cahill told his Min'
isters,
“I shall return fortified in the
knowledge that our transport system
is not as bad, say, as the rickshaw
congestion in Colombo at tiffimtime,
our traffic problems are not as serious
as those in Port Said on a gala day.
“I shall arrive home persuaded that
the odour from our city markets is not
as bad as Alexandria Harbour at low
tide, and that our drinking laws are
no more primitive than those of the
lowliest Egyptian workers.
And he will say to Aladdin Martin
on his return; “Didst thou rub thy
magic lamp and make the transport
pay in my absence?
“Didst thou heed the particulars I
sent thee regarding rickshaw licens'
ing, the use of Arab dhows instead
of ferries on our harbour, the prob'
lems of operating bullock wagons on
short runs, and other methods of mak'
ing profits grow where deficits at pres'
ent will flourish?”
And Aladdin Martin will hang his
head and weep: “Yes, O Caliph,” he
will cry. “I did indeed study the
particulars of rickshaws, and dhows
and bullock wagons, but decided, re'
luctantly, that they would impose no
more hardship on the populace than
do our present trains and trams,
and buses, and ferries.
“In fact, they would give a better
service and run a better timetable than
we could possibly give at present, and
that, O Caliph, would never, never
do.”
And Caliph Cahill, nodding wisely
(we almost said, drowsily), will heart'
ily agree!

JOHANNESBURG’S NEW RAILWAY STATION
A £6,250,000 PROJECT.
Johannesburg is in the process of
developing a new railway station, the
phenomenal growth of the city having
rendered the old facilities entirely in-
adequate.
Although the existing railway station
was extended after the first world war
it was impossible for the planners of
1920 to foresee Johannesburg’s phe-
nomenal growth, and it became neces-
sary in 1940 to consider a major ex-
pansion scheme. With a view to pro-
viding, if possible, for any foreseeable
expansion over the next fifty years, it
was decided to investigate all possibili-
ties thoroughly.
Traffic Growth.
The investigation showed that the
rate of growth was far greater than
that of the population, this being due
chiefly to the large increase in third-
class passenger journeys and the
widening of the city’s perimeter.
As recently as 1945, Major-General
Szlumper estimated that passenger
journeys during the next thirty years
would increase at an average annual
rate of 2,500,000, By 1949 the traffic
had already increased by 36,000,000,
at an average rate of 9,000,000 per
annum. It is obvious from these
figures that it will be very difficult to
over-estimate the increase in traffic
over the next thirty years.
Type of Station.
Johannesburg has always been a
through station, a type that has many
advantages, both from the railway
operating point of view and that of
the passengers themselves. The big
advantage of a through station, par-
ticularly one handling a large volume
of suburban traffic, is that only about
half as many, platform faces are re-
quired to handle the same number of
trains as in the case of a dead-end
station.
At Johannesburg Station two dif-
ferent kinds of traffic are handled,
namely, long-distance and suburban.
The suburban traffic consists of short
trains with a maximum of eleven
coaches. The long-distance trains have
as many as seventeen coaches. The
suburban trains occupy the platforms
for only a few minutes. The long-
distance trains, both arriving and de-
parting, occupy the platforms for a
much longer period, to facilitate the
more leisurely loading and off-loading
of long-distance passengers and their
luggage.
There is an obvious advantage in
PROGRESS TO DATE.
This photo shows part of Johannesburg’s new station in use. The progress made dur-
ing the last few years is well illustrated in this picture, taken from a northern
aspect. The new tracks and platforms as well as the Johan Rissik Street bridge
can be seen.

SOUTH AFRICA.

are being erected in South
Africa include the New Cape
Broadcasting Station at Sea
point. Cape Town which is

Estimated cost is £325,000. In

sembly plant at Port Elizabeth,

ng resemblance to other Ford

separating these two types of traffic
and keeping the suburban platforms
clear of parcels and luggage, which
impede the rapid flow of passenger
traffic.
The Problem of Construction.
The problem of constructing the
new station was that of building a new
station practically on the site of the
old, but at a level approximately 13ft.
lower. All traffic had to be kept
going during the construction period
as the type of signalling used at the
old station did not permit of tracks
and platforms being introduced piece-
meal, and at the same time the several
crossings of the railway lines had to
be kept open for road traffic.
It was therefore decided to recon-
struct the station in two stages. The.
first stage would involve the construc-
tion of a replica of the existing station
at the lowel level north of the old
station. This could be done by con-
structing three temporary platform
faces, all the others being permanent.
Stape two would be the lowering of
the old station site to the new level,
the construction of the additional
tracks and platforms and the final
straightening-out of the main lines be-
tween Johannesburg and Bloemfontein.
Having completed the planning of
the new station so soon after comple-
tion of the construction of the old
one, the question arises as to how long
it will be before it is too small. The
expansion of Johannesburg and the
Reef will probably continue irrespec-
tive of what happens to the local gold
mining industry, but adequate provi-
sion has been made to expand the
station to meet requirements without
losing the value of the present project.
The estimated cost of Johannes-
burg’s new station is £6,270,100; up
to the end of March, 1952, a total of
£2,943,758 had been spent.

LIGHT SORTS COAL.
If a new apparatus being tried out
at a Coal Board research station passes
its tests with flying colours, the labor-
ious hand-sorting of coal at pit-heads
will eventually be on the way out.
“Brights” and “dulls” are the two
main types of coal, and as quantities
of mixed coal pass along a conveyor
belt the machine directs a beam of
light on to it. The apparatus reacts
differently as “dulls” and “brights”
pass through its sensitive ray, the re-
sult being that the tell-tale beam aut-
omatically separates the coal.
THE Le TOURNEAU BUSINESS
PURCHASED.
The American interest in LeTour-
neau (Australia) Ptv. Ltd. has been
acquired by Westinghouse Air Brake
Corporation of U.S.A.. which has
purchased from R. G. LeTourneau
Inc. of Peoria, Illinois, its entire earth'
moving equipment business and world'
wide distributor organisation. It is
contemplated that a new company
known as LeTourneau Westinghouse
Company be organised immediately to
take over the operation.
Mr. R. G. LeTourneau, who is a
pioneer and leader in earth'moving
equipment, will continue his develop'
ment and research for the new com'
pany.
It is not anticipated that any alter-
ation in the Australian management
and organisation will take place as a
result of this transaction.

The History of Housing from Caves
to Modern Homes
There is a wonderful warmth to the
word “Home,” and from its very
earliest meaning as a shelter for family
living it has become the building
block ot nations and civilisations.
Within the walls of the home the
family group developed, and the
dearth of suitable homes to-day is
tragically retarding the progress of
Australia and other nations.
It is interesting to review the slow,
but nevertheless, the steady develop'
ment of houses through the ages.
Over centuries the crude tree dwell'
ings and caves of primitive men were
slowly abandoned. Early modern man
built sapling huts on poles and plat'
forms above the lakes of ancient
Switzerland 12,000 years ago.
The Ancient Egyptians built houses
of semi'mud bricks with flat roofs
adapted for outdoor living in desert
climates.
Three'tired dwellings on the island
of Crete indicate that there were apart'
mentdike dwellings in ancient times,
while Roman houses of ancient Pom'
peii have been revealed as dwellings
of great beauty.
Prehistoric Housing.
The earliest' known habitations of
man are the caves of Europe and
China, where primitive man sheltered
from the elements and wild animals.
He kindled a fire, which gave warmth,
protection and the means of cooking
meat over the glowing coals. Some
cave dwellers are still found in parts
of British East Africa and Ceylon,
while artificial caves and rooms are
tunnelled in the face of Loess cliffs in
North China.
North America furnishes a wide
variety of structures —from the snow
house of the Central Eskimo to the
hogan of the Navaho Indian.
Most of the North American struc*
tures can be paralleled in other parts
of the world. The sembsubterranean
lodge is widespread in northern Asia,
and the skin tepee is found in north'
western Siberia. The log house has
its counterpart in South America, in
Malaysia and Melanesia.
In Malaya it is usually raised high
above the ground on piles and may be
of enormous size, while in interior
Borneo a whole village may be under
the roof.
In Mexico and middle America the
neopie had established permanent vih
lages before the beginning of the
Christian Era. In Mexico the tribes'
‘men of 2000 years ago, like the farmers
of to'day, lived in huts with thatched
roofs set on walls of wattle smeared
with mud.
Historic Times.
Of the Early Greek houses, most is
known about those of the Minoan
civilisation on the island of Crete,
where ruins of the ancient city of
Cnossos show stone stairways leading
to upper floors.
To defend the city it was necessary
to accommodate a large number of
people in a small area, so houses of
two and three storeys were invented.
Thus 20th'century crowded cities
with their multistorey buildings had
their prototype as far back as 3000
B.C.
Greek houses of the early Hellenic
period were at first one room with a
porch, like a typical Greek temple.
Later, an entrance porch was added,
which led to an inner court around
which rooms were arranged.
Roman Houses.
The early Roman house consisted of
one room only, which was the family’s
sleeping, cooking, eating and living
quarters. Later, small rooms, called
cubicula were added around this cem
tral room, and the roof was broken
through in the middle to let in light.
Rain water fell through this opening
into a cistern or tank built in the
middle of the floor.
The most common building mate'
rial was unfired brick, covered with
stucco, with several fired brick layers
on the top for protection. Rubble
stone walls were also common. Floors
were covered with mosaics or marble.
In simple homes or less important
rooms, unglazed ceramic tile was used.
In their northern colonies in Ger'
many and Britain, the Romans heated
their houses with hypocausts. These
were systems of hot'air ducts under
the mosaic floors, which resembled in
many ways tO'day’s ultra'modern sys'
tern or radiant heating.
SOUTH AFRICAN
BUILDING
FORGES AHEAD.
That South Africa is forging
ahead with major building pro-
jects while Australia stagnates
under the crushing burden of
high costs and easy-going ef-
fort is instanced by this series
of important buildings illus-
trated in recent issues of

BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Mediaeval Houses.
The instability and lawlessness of
the Middle Ages made security of its
occupants the primary function of the
house. A ditch, mound, palisade or
wall surrounded all houses of con'
sequence. English castles were pro'
tected by moats and drawbridges. The
layout mostly consisted of a hall sur'
rounded by subordinate buildings.
The hall had a hearth in the middle.
Late in the 14th Century, the fireplace
was moved to the wall and was capped
with a hood, and wooden screens
were used to close off the entrance
passage.
In the 15th Century more rooms
were added to the hall, with the result
that the early English country homes
grew in a most haphazard fashion with
little attention paid to comfort, con'
venience, or basic unity.
Of the few mediaeval town houses
which have survived in England, one
of the oldest (12th Century) is the
Jew’s House in Lincoln.
Renaissance Houses.
The most basic changes in European
house construction came in the time
of the Renaissance, when the invention
of gunpowder made the city walls of
little use and they were torn down.
Cities expanded outward and archi'
tects began to make greater use of
space. Italian house builders turned
again to the concept of their early
Roman forebears, as can be seen to'
dav in the early Renaissance houses of
Florence.
In the Renaissance period houses
were sacrificed for the classic idea of
symmetry, and the rooms were con'
structed less to suit the convenience of
the inhabitants than to fit the exter'
nal splendour of the house.
The Great Fire of London (in
1666) and the rapid growth of a
wealthy middle-class created a great
demand for new houses in England.
This ushered in the Georgian style,
in which a house is entirely symmet'
rical to the point that even the chim-
neys must be properly balanced.
There is a central entrance with out'
side steps and a portico.
The Renaissance brought to Euro'
Dean house-building an added elegance
in both interior and exterior adorn-
ment. Rich carvings festooned roof
edges, columns and porticos, and in-
teriors were given grandeur with high
hallways, sweeping stairways, and rich
panellings.
Oriental Houses.
There are three main types of
Oriental architecture as expressed in
dwellings—the Islamic, extending from
North Africa to India; the Chinese;
and the Japanese. All three are a
direct product of their environment.
The congested populations of Is-
lamic cities created the need for build'
in?s of more than one storey, and the
traditional Moslem desire for family
privacy led to the placing of living
quarters around the inner courtyards
and on upper floors.
China is a land of housing contrasts,
where the peasant lives in a rectangular
thatched cottage of one or two rooms.
Along one wall of the main room runs
a waist'high shelf called a K’ang.
Ducts under the vest of this shelf run
from the stove built at one end, and
the family sleeps on the shelf in warm
comfort.
Wealthy Chinese have larger houses,
but they are essentially the same as
the smaller huts. They are merely
collections of houses grouped together
within a courtyard.
The Japanese building style, one of
the oldest and most original, is in
many ways the most modern. The
present'day architectural uses of natU'
ral materials, of blending the house
with the landscape, and of economy
of space, originated in Japan. Even
the idea of prefabrication first ap-
peared there. The Tatami, or bam'
boo mat, which form the floors of
Japanese rooms, is prefabricated and
made in set sizes. The rest of the
house is built to fit the size and num'
ber of tatami used, just as European
architects design their houses to per'
mit the use of prefabricated walls.
Victorian Homes.
These houses were ornamented on
the outside with elaborate scrollwork,
with domes and cupolas and towers
placed without any relationship to the
logic of the interior. The ceilings of
the rooms were too high for the
amount of warmth the heating plants
provided, while windows were narrow
and heavily draped. Only the plumb'
ing, revived for the first time since
the Roman era, was a real improve'
ment.
Modern Houses.
The evolution of the modern house
began when 20tlvcentury architects
commenced to study the functions per'
formed in a house and to shape the
space to fit these functions.
The French' Swiss architect Le
Corbusier’s slogan “A house should
be a machine for living” no doubt
con'.ributed much to the character of
the modern dwelling. Instead of an
arrangement of cubicles, parlour, study
and dining-room were merged into one
large, welMit living room. The ex'
terior form of the house followed the
interior functions.
No history of housing would be
complete without mention of U.S.
architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who
argued that although the house must
function as a well-run machine, it must
also have individuality and integrity.
His philosophy was termed “organic
architecture.” He taught that a house
must grow out of its natural setting.
There should be no break between
exterior and interior materials and the
whole house should have an over'all
unity reflecting its location, materials,
and occupants.
As these revolutionary new con'
cepts in home'building began to take
hold they were incorporated into the
olans of almost all newly'built houses
to a greater or lesser extent.
Prefabricated Houses.
The first attempt to standardise cer'
tain parts of a house to facilitate
cheap, quick home'building was made
in Germanv in the 1920’5.
An architect, Erich Frieberger,
worked out a “Growing House” built
of standardised elements, whereby a
home-builder could order a minimum
house with all utilities and add more
rooms as required.

The sub-frame, gooseneck and tandem
axles are of typical design but the

tilts over the rear wheels to form its
own loading ramp. A pair of double-
acting hydraulic cylinders controls the
tilting movement. This operation and
the locking or unlocking requires only
five minutes work by one man.
SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS PLAN WAHROONGA CHURCH
The Australasian Inter-Union Con-
ference of the Seventh Day Advent-
ists, under the leadership of the Sen-
ior Elder, Pastor A. G. Stewart, re-
cently launched an appeal for funds
to erect a new church on the Confer-
ence’s estate at Wahroonga.
The first appeal was made to the
congregation on April 11, resulting in
donations to date of about £6OOO.
Pastor Stewart told our representa-
tive that the new church (see illustra-
tion) is estimated to cost between
<£30,000 and £32,000.
It has been planned by two quali-
fied members of the church, and is
designed to accommodate the Advent-
ists’ Sanitarium Hospital staff and per-
sonnel of the Church’s Australian
headquarters.
The new church will be erected at
the gates of the Sanitarium Hospital
in Fox Valley Road, Wahroonga, and
an old dwelling is being demolished to
provide a site for the edifice.
Pastor Stewart expressed confidence
that the full amount of the building
commitment would be forthcoming,
and mentioned a “solid” lump-sum
donation of <£llos on the day .the
appeal was launched.
FESTIVAL ARCHITECTURE.
The recent Festival of Britain provided British architects with a unique opportunity
to be original and to produce designs with a background of frivolity and whimsi-
cality instead of as usual stern reality so typical of Britain's former practice, and
they made the most of it. We illustrate a section of the Festival, with the old

Construction Industry is Vital to Australia
and Barometer of National Prosperity
More and more, economists are coming to see that the construction
industry forms a reliable barometer of our national prosperity. More
and more, it is being realised that the welfare of the construction in-
dustry is irrevocably interlinked with the welfare of Australia.
To further appreciate the import-
ance of the industry which this jour-
nal so proudly serves, let us study the
ramifications of construction in all its
branches.
Designation.
The term “construction industry"
is a loose designation for the activities
and processes involved in assembling
a wide variety of materials for the
purpose of creating, altering, or re-
pairing permanent structures at given
locations.
In general such structures include
buildings, railways, highways, bridges,
water supply systems, and other sim-
ilar engineering projects. However,
except for the actual assembly opera-
tions, the modern construction indus-
try is a composite of many other im-
portant industries, such as brick man-
ufacture, sand and gravel production,
and concrete manutacture, who supply
their total product to the construction
industry.
Others furnish part of their pro-
duct to other fields of manufacture,
and such a large percentage of their
output is required in construction that
their profitable existence in normal
times depends largely on it. Among
these are the timber, steel, stone, clay,
marble, granite, slate, lime, pipe, as-
bestos, gypsum, glass, paint and var-
nish, builders, hardware, plumbing,
and electrical industries.
Funnel For Products.
Thus the construction industry be-
comes a funnel for a wide variety of
products, and it also fans out into sev-
eral categories of building activity.
So vast and varied are the ramifica-
tions of the construction industry that
it has been found impossible to treat
it as a homogeneous whole for pur-
poses of realistic economic analysis or
government regulations.
The, various categories often operate
independently of each other as regards
investment of funds and overall activ-
ity, and the effect on the national
economy of the several kinds of con-
struction differs widely
The most obvious classification is
according to the type of structure
built, which in turn may be broken
down into housing, stores, churches,
schools, railway stations, farm build-
ings, city commercial business prem-
ises and suburban industrial factories.
theatre, garages, roads and highways,
public utility structures, dams, har-
bour works, bridges and railways.
For purposes of economic analysis,
however, construction is according to
the source of its financing and its
economic use. On the basis of source
of investment, the simplest division
is into public construction and private
construction, as:
• Public construction is financed by
local. State or Federal Governments.
Many factors determine the type and
amount of public construction. Cer-
tain structures are customarily financ-
ed by government agencies from tax
appropriations, such as roads, high-
ways (including bridges) water con-
servation, schools, harbour works, and
public housing.
• Private construction is financed
by individuals, companies, co-opera-
tive organisations, and religious bodies.
The largest single item in this group
is residential construction, which in
normal times is financed by the pros-
pective occupant or by firms for re-
sale. Company or corporation finance
construction embraces plant and fac-
tory buildings, warehouses, offices,
stores, theatres, garages, hotels, and
other commercial structures.
• Charitable and non-profit organ-
isation building includes sanatoria, hos-
pitals, schools, colleges and churches,
which also come under the heading
of religious organisation construction.
Business Barometer.
Building and construction activity
is frequently used as a reliable indi-
cator of economic trends. Increased
activity in any field of building is a
general indication of increased busi-
ness. The amount of raw materials,
variety of processing techniques, and
large numbers of wage-earners con-
nected with construction, and its var-
ious subsidiary suppliers, constitutes
so large a segment of national pro-
duction that any trend in this field
tends to affect business as a whole.
Most importantly, the large propor-
tion of construction for the purpose of
producing income is an indicator of
the trend of capital investment and
business expansion or contraction.
Business Cycle*
Because new building involves large
expenditures, retrenchment in this
field tends to precede the downward
trend of the Business Cycle reflected in
reduced buying and increased unem-
ployment.
Building and construction have ah
ways reflected the general level of
economic and cultural development
of a people, and that is why State
and Federal Statisticians are closely
watching the construction figures for
signs of the expected upsurge in build-
ing.
This change in direction in public
and private construction will prove
the adaptability of the industry and
its willingness to co-operate in every
wav to advance the economic devel-
opment of Australia.
TOO MUCH GLASS?
Many feel that the present cult of all-
glass walls can be carried too far, In
Australia at any rate. That the occu-
pants of the house illustrated in the
lower two views have found this out
would seem to be Indicated by the
large sloping canvas awning seen to the
left of the chimney in the centre illus-
tration, which would rattle terribly in
the wind. In the upper example the
glass Is countered by continuous curtains
and large roof projections.

British Drive to Preserve Churches
£4,000,000 Needed For Work,
Many of England’s 12,500 parish
churches, humble and majestic alike,
are in urgent need of repair. Their
walls, roofs and ornate timbers are
collapsing dangerously, destroying the
grace and craftsmanship of centuries
and much else besides.
In an alhout drive to rescue 3509
such buildings, the newlyfformed His'
toric Churches Trust must collect
£4,000,000 in the next ten years.
With the Queen as Patron, and Prince
Phillip as the Trust’s President, and
Sir Winston Churchill, Mr. Attlee, the
Lord Chancellor, Speaker of the
House of Commons and other distin'
guished laity among its trustees, good
support is confidently expected.
Ancient Heritage.
England’s little churches, 300 of
which contain features venerated be-
fore the Norman Conquest, tell as no
books can the story of the people of
the sea-girt British Isles.
This is one of the reasons why the
Historic Churches Trust is anxious to
snatch an ancient heritage from its
twentieth'century threat of doom.
These churches are much more than
places of worship or treasuries in stone.
Several in East Anglia, off the Welsh
coast and on the borders of Scotland,
were built first as fortress towers or
defence posts.
At Rothwell and Wakefield there
are church towers with machicolations
projecting parapets through which
the besieged used to pour down hot
sand and molten lead on invaders.
At Newton Cottage, lying on Glamor'
gan’s coast, the church tower retains,
near its summit, traces of an archer’s
shooting gallery from which outraged
Welshmen once sped arrows into the
eyes of attacking pirates.
These little churches, embedded in
the very fabric of English national
life, are rich in events of great historic
importance.
When Cromwell’s men stabled war'
horses in their naves, defiled and de'
faced their fonts, figurines and monu'
ments, filched their gold and silver
plate, vandalism reached its peak.
“Angel” Roof.
In the gloriously lofty “angel” roof
of Mildenhall Church in Suffolk,
traces of attempted vandalism can still
be seen.
Looking into the roof, one can see
angel heads riddled with buckshot.
When the Diocesan architect put up
scaffolding to make a detailed exami'
nation, two of the bodies of angels
were, he discovered, pierced by iron'
tipped arrow heads.
Unable to reach the roof because
of its great height, the Cromwellians
in brute fury turned their bows and
blunderbusses against it.
At East Dereham, Norfolk, in 1799,
the massive tower of the church be'
came a cage for French prisoners'of'
war. Every time the bells pealed,
these unfortunate wretches were almost
maddened. One tried to escape, -was
shot, and his remains now lie beside
his one'time prison tower.
History in Sculpture.
At Tiverton Church, Devon, there
is an ornamental moulding beautifully
carved by some sculptor, illustrating
the evolution of sailing ships. The
models depicted show how cannons
were first mounted ’tween decks, and
the size and saiLpower of ships were
altered to fit the new armaments.
Great Marlow Church, Buckingham'
shire, preserves monumental witness to
a fatal accident, in which the victim
was Sir Miles Hobart, Speaker of the
House of Commons. He was killed
when his coach lost a wheel and over'
turned at Holborn in 1636. Parlia'
ment actually ordered this memorial
to be designed for him at a cost of
.£5OO. The tragedy, with the flying
coach wheel, is depicted in relief.
Other Memorials.
The Hartley Maudit, Hampshire,
memorial to a fighting ancestor of Sir
John Stewart’s family, is unusual, to
say the least.
The motif shows him engaged in
mortal combat with a Balliol, one of
the French King’s Scottish champions.
The Stewart, having broken his sword
against his enemy’s armour, seized a
gatepost, and in the memorial he is
belabouring and beating down his op'
ponent with this unorthodox weapon.
If seeking game, one can track
down a pheasant in church, as on the
Bromley Tomb at Wroxeter. At
Much Marcle, in Herefordshire, a
knight rests with his feet on a por'
cupine. At Miserden, a goat con'
tentedly munches a cabbage. And at
Broomsgrove, the victims of an early
rail disaster a real “Puffing Billy”
bust'up, which happened in 1848
are commemorated in sculpture.
Oldest Parish Church?
Which may be England’s oldest
parish church is highly disputed. The
North'east has three Saxon churches
at Escomb, Jarrow, and Monkwear'
mouth, where men have worshipped
continuously for 1200 years. Other
churches lie on sites where Druids
spoke with their stone gods, made
sacrifices of fresh blood, or where the
Roman legions raised basilicas or
temples to their war gods.
At Taplow, Bucks, a tumulus* in
the churchyard yielded some years ago
a Saxon chieftain’s body, plus his
spears, swords, jewelled necklets and
silver shield bosses.
The proud story of England’s
forays, invasions and historic incon'
gruities are thus recorded as well as
her religious, cultural and social pro'
FLOWERS IN THREE COUNTRIES.
Most people love flowers —in fact there
surely must be something missing if
these wondrous creations of shape,
colour and perfume do not give one
pleasure. Continental people particu-
larly like to bring flowers into their
buildings and daily life as much as they
can and we illustrate several interesting
examples. (Top) Pergola overhead and
flower-boxes on the side of a reinforced
concrete railway bridge at Etaples,
France. (Middle) Charming gardens
surrounding new flats at Zurich, Switzer-
land, and (bottom) formal garden plots
in the new County Primary School at
Ramsgate, England.

gress in the stone of the nation’s
churches, and one can sincerely hope
that success attends the efforts of the
Historic Churches Trust to arrest
time’s decay and man’s neglect and
preserve, for all time, this precious
ancient heritage.
It must be remembered that within
the walls of these 12,500 churches
the greatest influence for the good of
mankind is being exercised, the highest
moral code of ethics is practised, the
tasks of uplift tirelessly goes on from
the correcting of the wayward to the
care of the needy. These quaint and
beautiful buildings are just the shell
that houses the spirit of everything
that is worth while in life. From our
comparative “lap of luxury’’ we in
Australia can send our contributions
so that others —the offspring of our
British race—may benefit from the
maintenance of their ways of life into
which we were born and from which
we have benefited.
(* Tumulus: An artificial mound
usually of sepulchral character. The
largest known are the tombs of the
Mikados of Japan, in Karachi and
Yamoto. some antedating the Christian
Era by many centuries. The interior
consists of a large vault, built of un-
hewn stones, converging or “pelasgic’’
walls, roofed over by huge stone slabs,
each weighing several tons. This vault
is reached by a gallery of similar struc-
ture. Over the whole building a mass
of earth is heaped, so that it resembles
a natural hill.
In Wiltshire, England, is the largest
tumulus in Europe, covering 5£ acres.)
Flame-Gut Expansion
Joints For Bridge
Floor
For twelve bridges on the New
Jersey Turnpike, U.S.A., a simple and
efficient form of finger'type expansion
joint was fabricated by flame'cutting
steel plates to produce inter-meshing
fingers having an average length of
about 6 inches. Special care was need-
ed to avoid warping and to ensure
free movement when in service. Cut'
ting tips were chosen to give a wide
cut and thus leave adequate’ clear-
ances. On skew bridges the fingers
run parallel to the bridge centre line
variations in design to meet the dif-
ferent bridge requirements entailed the
making up of 12 electronic tracing
templates. After cutting, the plates
were flattened in a press, sections
spliced by welding and matching
plates carefully checked for clearance
fits.
Newcastle Plan On
View At Quay
In Old Maritime Building.
The Department of Local Govern-
ment has taken over the former Mar-
itime Services Building at Circular
Quay, to exhibit the master plan for
the Newcastle region.
# There were so many plans and
supporting documents that the de-
partment had been in a quandary tw
find space to display them properly.
It has met the situation by renting
the old Maritime Services Building.
Here the plan can be inspected by
the town planning section of the de-
partment, the Town and Country
Planning Advisory Committee, and
Government departments affected by
the proposals.
The committee will begin detailed
consideration of the scheme on Tues-
day. May 26,
As examination proceeds, certain
aspects of the plan will be referred
back to the Northumberland County
Council (the Newcastle planning
authority) for elaboration or altera-
tion.
(Footnote: The former Maritime
Services Building was earmarked for
demolition, to make way for the Cir-
cular Quay railway link. There ap-
pears little possibility of this work
proceeding for some time at least.)
THE PLACE OF HONOUR.
In times gone by the place of honour was over the fireplace and here the family
portrait, the marble clock, the alabaster bust or the blunderbus he[?]lo[?]m was wont
to hang. The changed treatment of the fireplace in the present [?] or its entire
elimination in many cases, has wrought great changes in this traditional repository
of the household gods. Many fine homes in California, however, as these illustra-
tions show, still like a fireplace and still like to hang a portrait, prized picture or
sculptured group above it. The bottom left example, which is plain and mantleless,
relies upon some trailing foliage to break the severe monotony. All of these fire-
places are provided by curtain chains or collapsible wire screens which run on
runners, housed inside what would be a neat pelmet it applied to curtain runners.

BRICK SUPPLIES IN BRISBANE
By F. O. NIXON.
The four Brisbane brickmaking es-
tablishments which were banded to-
gether in the name of Brick Supplies
Pty. Ltd. for some years past have
disbanded as from 25th March, when
the company ceased to operate.
No reason is given in the announce-
ment for this change of business
policy in asking the public to contact
direct any of the brickmakers. Sup-
plies now are back to normal. Also,
the Queensland Cement & Lime Co.
is about to put on the market their
cement bricks in standard brick size.
The enormous increase in the num-
ber of dwellings erected each year
since this second war taxed every form
of building material to supply the
needs; and in consequence the pro-
portion of timber homes which had
always been high—as high as 95% at
one period in years gone by—fell, as
adequate supplies of building timbers
had reached their peak and the de-
mand for bricks reached the same pin-
nacle. The recent financial blanket
cast upon loans for house-building has
had the effect of reconciling supply
to demand, and with it has risen the
greater use of bricks in house build-
ing. When the large-scale production
of cement bricks of the clay brick
standard size being made by the
Queensland Cement and Lime Co.
Ltd. at Darra comes on the market in
May there should not be the shortage
that was experienced prior to the
“loan blanket,” even though house
building should increase with the rise
in prosperity which should lift it.
The Queensland statistician’s figures
show that the average completion rate
of six months as against twelve months
in the Southern States is largely due
to the accelerated proportion of tim-
ber houses to 80%. In 1951/52 there
were 11,803 houses completed at
June, 1952, there were 5140 houses
under construction. In N.S.W. in
the same period 24,364 houses were
begun and 23,273 completed, while
there were 32,884 under construction.
Because of the double length of time
for completion in N.S.W. there were
six times as many homes than in
Queensland under construction at one
time.
The very large number of homes
built and under construction at South-
port, Surfers Paradise, and the ad-
jacent towns of the South Coast have
the advantage of a local brickworks
besides sawmills. For a long period
permits to build seaside houses were
not granted to anyone with a home
elsewhere, that is a house for seaside
holidays. With the lifting of this re-
straint, something in the nature of a
building boom is going on in South-
port, Surfers Paradise, and all other
seaside resorts as far as the N.S.W.
border at Tweed Heads. Quite a num-
ber of these homes are owned by resi-
dents of Sydney, Melbourne, and even
in New Zealand, who come and go
by sea planes that alight at Southport
or by air planes that land at Coolan-
gatta.
The new sea plane base at Redland
Bay at the southern end of Moreton
Bay, midway between Brisbane and
Southport, can be used by the largest
sea planes in existence.
Owing to accidents that have oc-
curred in the Brisbane River it was
deemed to be unsafe to both sea
planes and river traffic to allow the
former to continue to use the river as
a base.
Building from the Top Down
or First Build Your Attic in
New “From the Top Down” Method
By A. L. KIDSON.
Swedish construction engineer,
Harald Lindner, has an idea that may
revolutionise methods for building
multi-storeyed houses. His plan is to
complete the top storey first, then the
next highest, and so on down to the
ground floor. No “Alice-in-Wonder-
land” theory this, but one that has
been carefully thought out by a man
who knows the game.
For Lindner, after graduating from
the Stockholm 8.Y.5.A.N., a technical
high school, became one of the big-
gest building contractors in that city.
When socialisation cramped his efforts
he moved to Australia, where he
is now planning to try out his new
method. This, he claims, will save
substantially on time, labour, materials
and “all in” costs.
Here, then, is his idea. The attic
carcass flooring and the roof are built
first. This is done on the bottom
plane of the proposed building, i.e.,
at ground level. The framing of
joists, and the roof, with final roof
superstructure, are completed in this
first step, the whole lot being then
hoisted to a height of one storey.
This way, the top storey of the
building can be completed under the
lifted roof, and become joined to it.
That part is then lifted, in its turn,
one storey high, thus giving space for
the mounting of the next storey at
ground level, and so on.
The basic theory is that hoisting
the whole building—which must be
done, of course, at the final stage —
is cheaper than lifting it in small parts.
For example, an eight'Storeyed house
45ft. x 160 ft. weighing 2500 tons can
be lifted 10ft. (the height of one
storey, which is the maximum raise
required) in 10 hours by means of
24 electric motors each of three h.p.
Cost of the current, Lindner estimates,
will be under ten dollars (iA.4/10/0).
Lifting members are jacks, installed
in the cellar. Each has two screw'
spindles carried by strong roller bear'
ings and made to revolve slowly by
means of worm gears and electric
motors. These can be synchronised
to give a completely even lift at each
point of the cross'section where they
are placed. The load is taken at each
point by a horizontal yoke with two
threaded sleeves.
Lindner visualises these jacks being
used to fit out the building skeleton
with prefabricated units comprising
carcass flooring, walls, stairs, and so
on. For the skeleton he recommends
a welded steel structure, fireproofed
with concrete. All mounting work is
done at ground-level by means of
machines, some stationary and some
movable, e.g., trucks, which could
thus deliver units direct from factory
to point of installation.
Site preparation follows standard
practice. Where rock foundations do
not exist, the usual strengthening
methods must be used. The basement
floor is formed in the usual way, with
basic walls and columns of concrete,
and a concrete carcass at about ground-
level. This is permanent, and will
later become the building’s ground
floor. It serves as a mounting surface
44

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


for all the upper storeys.
On it is laid out a set of piaster
plates or other ceiling material, and
on that again is placed the sustaining
steel skeleton of the carcass flooring
for the roof. By means of filling
blocks, concrete castings, etc., and by
mounting the roof with its insulations
and superstructures, such as fan' and
lift'machine rooms, the roof construe'
tion is completed.
At the same time the work of erect'
ing columns is going on in the base'
ment. These are prefabricated twins
with cross connections. They are
raised and brought into position in
such a way that strong girders rest
crosswise upon the yokes of the jacks.
Each yoke is then screwed up to
connect the top ends of the columns
with two girder stumps having the
same cross-section as the columns.
These girder stumps are mounted in
the finished carcass flooring structures
and extend downwards through a slot
opening in the basement carcass floor-
ing. Columns and girder stumps are
welded together, and the jacks can
now be started.
Raising must be done slowly, so is
best postponed until night. That way
there will be no interference with the
mounting and installation work. Con-
trol and alarm systems connect the
columns. These automatically cut off
current at the slightest difference in
the rate of movement.
By next day the mounting plane is
clear, and ready for the work of lay-
ing out a new ceiling and the steel
frames for a new carcass flooring. In
the cellar, new steel columns are raised
beneath the yokes now screwed up.
To allow easy fitting for these, the
previous hoisting has been carried
some inches beyond the necessary
level.
With new columns fitted into posi-
tion the jacks are now adjusted for a
lowering movement. The end parts of
the previous column, hanging down
through the slot opening in the base-
ment carcass flooring, are slowly lower-
ed towards the top ends of the new
columns, which thus take the load.
The yokes can now be disengaged
and re-set in the lowest working posi-
tion.
Columns are welded, ready for the
next raising step. In the meantime a
new carcass flooring has been prepared
on the bottom plane, stairs and par-
tition walls have been mounted, and
floor coverings laid in. Any pipes or
wiring in walls or floors are as far as
possible built into the unit blocks at
the factory. These blocks may consist,
for example ,of a wall complete with
kitchen equipment on one side and
half a bathrom on the other.
When the equipment of this storey
is finished, the outside wall blocks,
with window openings, balconies, and
finished insides as well as outsides, are
fastened, and the top storey is com'
plete. The jacks start up and lift
the completed storey 10 feet. Work
on the next storey is started, and is
done by the same shift in the same
way. Theoretically, there is nothing
to prevent finishing a storey a day.
Here are some of the advantages
Lindner claims for his method:—
1. Less Working Time. The sys'
tern is specially suited for assembling
prefabricated components on the build'
ing site. These can be moved by
suitably adapted vehicles which de'
liver them directly into place on the
mounting plane. There they can be
speedily mounted and finished by
machine operations.
2. Material Saved, because—
(a) the method does away with
scaffolds, stairs and other
gangways, lifts, concrete
moulds and props;
(b) there is no loss of materials
during transport, reloading,
and hoisting;
(c) material is more economical'
ly used in factory operations.
3. Labour Saved, because all pro'
cesses can be streamlined—
(a) through the same men doing
the same work repeatedly:
(b) by the maximum use of
machines.
Under present methods much time
and power are lost in moving up and
down stairs at all meal-breaks, to fetch
tools and materials, carry up cup'
boards, bathtubs, etc. If delivered
too early, these have to be moved from
room to room for storage. More
labour is lost in the moving of team
workshops during finishing; in mov-
ing form wood from room to room
prior to its cleansing and disposal; in
the removal of “left over” materials,
tools and machines.
4. General. The new method cuts
down considerably on water usage for
concrete casting, brick-laying, finish'
ing. All work is done under cover.
There is no exposure to weathering or
other forms of damage requiring re'
pairs and adjustments in the course of
construction. Greater accuracy is pos-
sible in the calculation of quantities
and strengths. Transport and cartage
are reduced. The jacks and their
motors are demountable and can be
used again. The method lends itself
to the use of new materials.
HUMOUR.
An Arctic explorer recalls the time
when he swallowed frozen brandy in
chunks. A genuine hard drinker.
According to a novelist, the sun'
shine pouring through the window on
to your bed is the best possible induce'
ment to get up. Except, perhaps, the
rain pouring through the ceiling.
“Not a square yard of territory
should be left unused,” declares a
politician. We must find work for the
idle lands to do.
NEW RADIO-TELEPHONE LINK.
Early this year a new radio-telephone link
was brought into service between
Turkey, Western Europe, and U.S.A. The
new receiving station at Ankara is shown,
the equipment being supplied by Stand-
ard Telephones & Cables Ltd. in collab-
oration with the Turkish Posts and Tele-
graph Administration.

LEG-BREAKING MADE EASY.
If one was endeavouring fo build a stair-
case for one's creditors in the hope that
they may break the legs or trip over-
board, this is it. Children could com-
mit suicide quite easily by falling off
the landing or the top step. It is in-
deed hard to understand the fascination
that these ridiculous cantilevered slabs
that masquerade as stairs have for the
"modernist."

BOOK REVIEW
“Dictionary of Architecture,” by H.
H. Saylor. 221 pp. 16 pages
of diagrams. John Wiley &
Sons Inc., New York. Chap-
man 6? Hall Ltd., London.
The author who as Editor of
the Journal of the American Institute
of Architects and a Fellow of that
body is eminently qualified to prepare
this useful reference book in his
Preface says that every half-century
someone writes a dictionary of archi-
tecture. This rapidly in many respects
goes out of date, and in our own time
with the rapid development of build-
ing techniques, new materials and the
necessity of seeking new forms to ex-
press new social needs it becomes more
an historical record than an aid to
vocabulary.
In the preparation of a volume to
suit present needs the greatest difficulty
lies in deciding where to stop, for
to-day’s practice of architecture calls
for a knowledge of far more than con-
struction and the disposition of space.
To confess ignorance of hydraulics,
acoustics, heating, ventilation, elec-
tricity, hygiene, economics, clima-
tology painting, sculpture and art in
general would automatically infer a
lack of competence as a practising
architect. Therefore, such subjects
must be touched upon.
The Past Is Prologue.
In this period of transition, when
the forms of past epochs seem to have
little practical bearing upon the archi-
tectural problems of the twentieth cen-
tury, the student is tempted to fix his
eyes on the future and pay little atten-
tion to the road behind. And yet he
must soon realise that even so forward-
looking a pioneer as Einstein could
not hope to move ahead into the un-
charted fields of Knowledge without
an understanding appreciation of what
has been done along the road behind
by such men as Archimedes, Francis
Bacon, Isaac Newton, Kant, Descartes
—even as far back as the discoverer
of the wheel. The past is prologue.
In describing pronunciation, pho-
netic spelling has been adopted, while
in the interests of economy of space
illustrations have been restricted to ob-
jects that are difficult or impossible to
describe in words alone.
Even to me, who has a reasonable
knowledge of architecture and its prac-
tice, on skimming through the pages
there are innumerable items of interest
Here are a few: Aileron —a wing wall
to mask the aisle of a church (one
usually thinks of a plane); appui—a
solid separate member, as a window-
sill or top member of a parapet ot
balustrade; artifact—that which is pro-
duced by human art; bossage—a stone
in the rough left projecting from a
wall to be sculptured later; Chester —
Anglo-Saxon term for a fortified town
built on the site of a Roman military
post; cinerarium—a recess for the per-
manent container of the ashes of cre-
mation; colombage—Norman term for
half-timber construction; coulomb
the quantity of electricity carried in
one second in a current of one am-
pere; creche—a sculptured or posed
representation of the Nativity; croquis
—a sketch; papal—a cross with three
transarms or crossbars; dairi —resi-
dence of the Japanese Mikado; erisma
—a buttress or shoring to support a
wall; fevage—a tax on chimneys; gal-
leting—a form of masonry jointing
embellished by embedding on the sur-
face small chips of flint; gynecontis—
the section of the Greek church re-
served for women;; haw—mansion or
dwelling, as used in Domesday Book;
ichnograph a ground plan; jesting
beam—a beam introduced into a struc-
ture for ornamental purposes only;
lactarium —a dairy house (sounds like
modern American); palafitte—French
and Swiss term for a lake dwelling;
pet-cock—small valve on a pipe line
boiler or radiator for drawing a test-
ing; type —the canopy sounding board
over a pulpit; vivarium—a zoological
garden.
The dictionary is right up to the
minute and in addition to ample
coverage of the traditional and ancient
side of architecture the scientific as-
pects are not in any way neglected
and ancient Gothic and classic terms
rub shoulders with case hardening, hot
and cold cathodes, egg-crate ceilings,
sheradizing, heat pump, silica gel and
casein paint and photo-electric cells.
Trades names that have by usage en-
tered the language are also covered
and we find monel, masonite, formica,
Incite, plexiglas, etc.; likewise, terms
such as the Munsell System of colour
nomenclature, Nissen and Quonset
huts, etc.
It is also of interest to see included
reference to a number of Australian
timbers such as Black Beam, Cooin-
new and Rosemay (neither of which
appear to be particularly well-known);
we also learn that a Fmia-mia” is a
circular native hut peculiar to Australia
and the “adjacent islands.”
The difference between American
and English practice in respect of
Quantity Surveyors is also emphasised
by the definition against this item.
“In England and certain of her
Colonies (that means us) one who
draws up lists of quantities labour
and materials upon which contrac-
tors’ tenders are based.”
Royal academicians will also be
startled to learn that the sacred letters
R.A. are described as standing for
“Registered Architect.”
However, all in all, it is an excel-
lent reference volume on all things
architectural.
ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW
PUBLICATION.
(1) “Code for Protection Against
Lightning.”
In spite of the value of lightning
rod systems for protecting buildings,
their use has not proved as effective
as possible because of a general lack
of information as to the best methods
of protection. To enable the public
to demand installations designed for
adequate protection, the American
National Bureau of Standards has just
issued the new edition of “Code for
Protection Against Lightning,” spon-
sored jointly by the National Fire Pro-
tection Association, American Institute
of Electrical Engineers, and the N.B.S.
Widespread ignorance regarding
proper installation practice has result'
ed in great variations in lightning pro-
tection both of buildings and of elec- ,
trie equipment and, consequently, in
installation of many inadequate sys-
tems. This handbook emphasises per-
sonal precautions and protection of
buildings and miscellaneous structures.
In addition to including material
revised from previous handbooks, the
volume contains information on alu-
minium as a suitable material for light-
ning protective systems, new rules on
grain elevators and on vents and stacks
emitting explosive dusts, vapours, or
gases, and detailed specifications for 1
lightning rods.

Wunderlich Ltd.
Annual Meeting
The chairman of directors, Mr.
Alfred Wunderlich told the share'
(holders at the annual meeting that he
[considered the firm had had a most
(satisfactory year.
Both in turnover and net profit a
[record year had been established.
When this company in 1908 held
[its first Shareholders’ Meeting it had
[assets valued at £lBO,OOO with a paid'
[up capital of £144,500.
Now, 45 years later its assets amount
to £3,098,190 and the paid-up capital
is £707,633.
The modernisation of most of their
[lB plants is proceeding apace, with
some excellent results from the re'
cently installed modern tile and asbes'
tos cement machinery.
The Board decided to still further
[increase the Contingencies Fund which
will now stand at £235,000. A further
loan of £60,000 from the A.M.P. has
been negotiated bringing their indebt'
edness to £560,000.
The 260 Staff Partners have bene'
fited this year to the extent of
£25,500. The late Dr. O. Wunder'
lich proposed and inaugurated this
scheme which has proved of incalcub
able benefit to the company.
Mr. D. Croudace, Managing Direct'
or, said the building trade business
was becoming more competitive.
Government departments and private
were insisting on cancellation
of the “rise and fall” clause, so that
they might rely on firm prices if ma-
terials and wages rose before the order
was completed.
Wunderlich Ltd. might have to take
that risk, because of the necessity to
keep costs down to a minimum, he
added.
The report said that the changed
position indicated that builders had
now to reduce estimates for new work.
Mr. Croudace said that, although
demand for some prodvcts had eased,
overall sales for the year rose by 25%.
Although the increase did not yield
much extra profit, it helped to carry
increased costs.
[ Results had also been assisted by
labour savings from installation of
more modern machinery.

wood magnate with whom she sat at

“The House of the
Tree”
Novel Italian Apartment Building.
“I think that I shall never see a
poem as lovely as a tree,” wrote Amer-
ican poet Joyce Kilner before World
War I.
His magnificent and moving ballad
“Trees,” has perhaps done more than
any other literature to inspire within
us a love of trees, and a desire to
preserve them, wherever possible.
How well one Italian property'own'
er has done this is graphically illus'
trated in our photos, depicting the
nowTamous “house built around a
beloved tree.”
Cleverly the graceful white home has
been planned to preserve, for all
time, the pine tree which has its roots
outside the front doOr (see bottom
photo) and rears its spiny head
through the balcony and above the
roof.
The house, built in a suburb of
Milan, comprises two selTcontained
apartments, with separate entrances,
and sunlit patios.
Note the flower'troughs on the up'
stairs patio, to add a further touch
of brightness and colour to a build'
ing of distinct novelty.
There are, of course, typical shut'
ters to exclude the hot Italian sun
at its zenith and window shades to
further protect the interior from the
glare. The shutters are finished in
green. The Spanish'type tiles are of
terra'cotta, and walls are white.
Each apartment comprises five
rooms and usual offices.
State Homes “On
Easy Terms”
Ministers to Discuss Proposals.
State Housing Ministers are ex*
pected to meet soon to discuss pro'
posals to sell State'owned houses on a
small deposit.
The Housing Ministers will also
consider a Victorian plan to extend
repayments under the Commonwealth'
State housing agreement from 53 to
73 years.
Mr. Evatt Inspects.
Mr. Clive Evatt, N.S.W. Housing
Minister, last week discussed both pro'
posals with the Victorian Housing
Minister, Mr. Hayes.
Earlier, Mr. Evatt made a tour of
Victorian Housing Commission estates.
He said he was particularly impress'
ed with the Commission’s “economy”
home, which would be let at about
45A a week.
For N.S.W.?
This much'publicised “economy”
home has three bedrooms, a combin'
ation living room'kitchen, and bath'
roomdaundry.
According to Press reports, Mr.
Evatt said he felt the “economy”
home would help meet the urgent
problems that had arisen in connec'
tion with emergency homes and coum
try housing.
He said he would get N.S.W. hous'
ing officers to make a detailed report
upon the “economy” unit.
(Mr. Evatt is making a coast'wise
trip to Fremantle. Before he left
Sydney he declared his intention of
investigating the housing position and
problems in Victoria, S.A., and
W.A.)

Outdoor living has great appeal to the present generation and as a result the Sun Deck, Sun
Porch, Terrace and Patio have all become very popular attributes to the modern home. The

COMMONWEALTH GLASS CONVENTION
INTERSTATE AND LOCAL DELEGATES DISCUSS PROBLEMS
The Commonwealth Glass Convention of The Federal Glass Merchants’
Association of Australia was held in Sydney from May 4th to Bth, 1953.
There was a full representation of
glass merchants from every State in the
Commonwealth, and Convention offi-
cials were gratified by the widespread
interest evident in the progress and
advancement of the flat glass industry.
Official Opening.
The delegates and members of the
Association gathered in the Conven-
tion Hall, A.C.I. Building, William
Street, at 10.45 a.m. on Monday, May
4th, for fraternisation, and the Con-
vention was officially opened at 12.15
p.m. by the Deputy Lord Mayor of
Sydney, Alderman Frank Green.
The President of the Glass Merch-
ants’ Association, Mr. Frank G.
O’Brien, in introducing the Deputy
Lord Mayor, paid a tribute to the con-
stant interest shown in the develop-
ment of industries by the Sydney City
Council.
The Convention was honoured, he
said, by the presence of Alderman
Green, who was further demonstrat-
ing the Council’s interest by perform-
ing the Official Opening Ceremony.
In his remarks, Alderman Green
said he considered it a great honour
to be asked to officially open the Con-
vention.
He said he had recently read some-
thing of the inside history of the
glass industry, and he had been as-
tounded to learn of the tremendous
advances which the industry had made.
The art of glass-making went far
back into history. Alderman Green
continued.
“I think modern developments are
ideally suited for the uses of glass,
there are all sorts of things to be made
from this indispensable material.
But it is good for us to be re-
minded at times not to advance too
fast.
Although Australia has made re-
markable strides, I believe we should
not go too rapidly,” he added.
Alderman Green said he had be-
lieved, in his ignorance, that plate
glass was still imported, and he was
happy to learn that much of the na-
tion s requirements were produced lo-
cally.
“This helps us in our efforts to
achieve a well-balanced economy,” he
declared.
It was a pleasure, Alderman Green
said, to see that Mr. W. J. Smith
(Chairman of Directors, Australian
Consolidated Industries Ltd.) was
present; and he congratulated him on
his long and successful association
with the glass industry.
“Conventions are excellent for the
advancement of industries.
“Nothing succeeds like a talk around
a table. It serves its purpose far
better than \)hone calls or letters,”
Alderman Green went on.
“It is a very great honour to de-
dare this Convention open, and I
wish its deliberations every success.
“I hope you will solve at least 99%
of your problems,” he added.
Luncheon and Toasts.
The gathering of 130, comprising
official guests, delegates and members,
sat down to an excellent luncheon in
the spacious Convention Hall.
Following the Royal Toast, the
Convention Proceedings were opened
by Mr. W. J. Smith in a bright, happy
speech, seasoned with his inimitable
reminiscences.
Mr. Smith said it was indeed a
great honour to be invited to propose
the Convention Toast.
In doing so my mind goes back
many years to the time when one
would not see such a happy gather-
ing.
In those days it was too much to
expect to see a poor manufacturer
who supplied goods to be invited into
such a select circle as I see here to-
day, Mr. Smith said, amid laughter.
It is some years ago since I and
my organisation felt it would be ‘very
nice to become manufacturers of flat
glass, or window glass.”
Mr. Smith traced the difficulties
arising from that decision, when Aus-
tralian and overseas interests joined
hands to say “such an industry in Aus-
tralia was not acceptable or desir-
able. ’
Rough-house tactics prevailed,” he
added.
However, they got to know each
other by watching each other, until
today the lambs are invited to eat
at the same manger as the lions!”
(Prolonged laughter and cheers.)
Mr. Smith continued:
“The Deputy Lord Mayor has said
that while it is good to progress we
must watch our step and not overdo
it in our manufacturing industries.
“I agree, for sometimes our eyes
are bigger than our stomachs.
“I believe we should go steady,
and concentrate to fortify what we
have already accomplished,” Mr.
Smith declared.
He said it was indeed gratifying to
see that so many people of the glass

industry had made the trip to Sydney
for the Convention, “to learn things
from their angle and use and apply
them in Australia, so that the very
best can be produced and used.”
“It is only a matter of time until
the people become accustomed to use
the products of Australia,” Mr.
Smith added.
He traced the history of medieval
glass, but commented that his person'
al knowledge only went back some 60
years! (laughter).
“I will leave the matter of medieval
glass to some of the older men here!”
(more laughter).
Mr. Smith referred to the loss to
the glass industrv incurred by the
death of the late Mr. Harold Sandy.
“May I say that the Sandy organ'
isation, with people like yourselves
and the President, Mr. Frank O’Brien,
have done a great deal for advancing
the use of glass in Australia?” Mr.
Smith concluded.
Convention “Important.”
Replying on behalf of the Con'
vention, Mr. D. Clarkson (Adelaide)
said that all members of the glass fra'
ternity were delighted to see Mr.
Smith present and fully realised what
a wonderful job AjC.I. had done in
Australia. (Hear! Hear!)
He thanked Mr. jSmith for gener'
ously allowing the Convention the use
of such commodious premises.
"I did not realise until I came to
Sydney the support we have received
from Mr. Frank O’Brien.
“We are greatly indebted to him
for arranging the Convention,” Mr.
Clarkson declared.
“I think there is a strong and great
necessity to get together and strength'
en the bonds of trade,” he added.
“We hope that, through the initia'
tive of the Sydney firms in backing
the Convention ,we will return home,
having learned a great deal by ex'
changing our knowledge with each
other.
“The Convention will be of great
benefit to the glass industrv generally.
“Let us strive to lift the industry
to what it should be,” Mr. Clarkson
concluded.
President’s Remarks.
The President, Mr. Frank O’Brien,
in welcoming the official guests, said
the Convention was honoured by the
presence of distinguished representa-
tives of the architectural profession
and building industry.
He referred to the important part
architecture plays in “designing uses
for glass, resulting in builders erect'
ing buildings, and furniture manufac-
turers using mirrors.”
This cycle was of utmost import'
ance to the glass industry, Mr.
O Brien declared, and he reminded
the gathering that the encouragement
of building was of vital importance to
the nation, “for the building industry
is the backbone of the secondary in-
dustries of Australia.” (Applause.)
“We propose to share our know'
ledge during the Convention, and thus
advance our industrv.
“The Convention will also prove
that the present unity of merch'
ants will become greater through our
Association,’” Mr. O'Brien concluded.

ed by Mr. Frank O’Brien, was briefly

In an informative scroll issued to
members by the Committee and en-
titled “Our Heritage,” the history of
glass-making is traced from the Nean-
derthal man to the present time.
“OUR HERITAGE.”
The text of the message to Austra-
lia’s “Worthy Company of Glaziers”
reads as follows:
Yes, fellow craftsmen, the arts and
crafts associated with glass and glaz-
ing are “misteries” whose origins reach
right back to that instant in time
when a Neanderthal man was startled
to see in the ashes of his fire a shiny
lumn of semi-transparent new mater-
ial. We know that it was the product
of heat fusion of sand and silica. Our
prehistoric ancestor thereby became
the first glass maker and later the first
glass user, as he tipped his spears
and arrows with the sharp-edged flakes
split from the amorphous lump of
crude glass.
Just a few thousand years after,
his latter generations were drinking
from glass, eating from glass, using it
to form exquisite ornaments and, as
the ultra in building, even using it in
windows in lieu of skin or horn.
Coming to more recent times, we
find the arts and crafts of glass flour-
ishing in the reign of Edward Third
who granted The Glaziers Guild a
Fraternity Charter, empowered a dis-
tinctive dress or livery and approved
a code of rules under which the craft
prospered.
In the robust reign of the Tudors,
the Fraternity of Glaziers prospered
and waxed fat.
The first description of the “armes,
creast and supporters of the Corpora-
tion and Fellowship of the Glaziers
of the Cittie of London” occurs in
1588. In that year, Clarenceux, King-
of-Arms, visited the Company to view
and approve its “armes.”
In 1615 an Act of Common Coun-
cil directed that all persons using the
art of glazing within the “City and its
liberties ’ should be subject to the con-
trol and search of the Masters of the
Craft and laid down stringent rules
for the binding of apprentices to none
but Glaziers of the Fraternity.
The Glaziers, a tough and hardy
lot even in those days, stoutly resisted
in Queen Elizabeth’s reign an at-
tempt by certain outside interests to
gain control of the price of glass.
The result of the Glaziers’ resistance
was the incorporation of the Company
during Charles the First’s reign in
1638.
The seventeenth century Glaziers
were an independent and indeed a
truculent lot. In 1627 the Master and
Wardens were committed to Newgate
Prison for refusing to pay their as'
sessment of a forced loan to the Crown
and William Holly, “Glazier to the
City,” was discharged from his office
for “grosse and obstinate carriage
against the Court of the Common
Council.”
In the eighteenth century, the Glaz-
iers flourished mightily. Gentlemen
Glaziers, in wire'distended coats and
embroidered waistcoats, silk stockings,
and square-toed red-heeled shoes, with
gold-laced three-cocked hats and livery
robes, took part in the pageants, fet-
ing and revelry that played such a
large part in civic life in the days of
Good Queen Anne.
The special Glazier’s barge, gaily
flying silk banners and Company
streamers, was a feature of civic water
pageantry on the Thames on high
days and holidays.
The Glaziers Hall was destroyed in
the Great Fire of London and not re-
built. The Company leased the beau-
tiful Loriner s Hall until 1747 when
we are told they commenced to wand-
er from tavern to tavern and coffee
house to coffee house.”
A Depression in 1795 (how history
repeats!) caused a slump so bad that
in 1799 the Company sold much of its
precious plate.
A series of vicissitudes was experi-
enced until the beginning of the
1900 s, when the Company steadily
regained its standing and strength.
Through the years a gradual change
in the purpose and composition of
the Company has been experienced
until to-day the Glaziers Guild is not
composed of practising glaziers or
artificers of glass but rather of pro-
minent City of London merchants
and representatives of the professions.
Nevertheless, the ancient traditions of
the Glaziers Company are upheld and
arts such as painting and decoration
on glass are encouraged. The Wal-
ford Fund is also devoted entirely to
technical education in glass usage.
The Company is still willing and
anxious to promote by every means
in its power the beautiful art it was
founded to foster.
To-day the Company is one of the
best London guilds and, in the seventh
century of its existence, is still full of
vitality and adapting itself to the needs
of the time. The Company has asso-
ciated itself with the Federation of
Glass Manufacturers and will doubtless
play an important part in the develop'
ment of the glass industry.
And so to-day, my Masters, in a
lusty growing country far removed
from the ancient birthplace of our
arts and crafts, we assemble at our
Convention in Sydney in the year
1953 as a Worthy Company of
Glaziers, to consult among ourselves
the “wayes to improve the craft,” the

THE SLENDER SUPPORT.
Whereas once the desire on the part of
designers was to make a support look
robust and capable of carrying the
load superimposed upon it, today the
opposite appears to be the case and
the more slender and unobtrusive it is
possible to make the light steel columns
the better. We show two recent ex-
amples, one German and the other Brit-
ish, In the upper not only are the tub-
ular supports very thin but the cyclone
type wire balustrade is so fine that it is
scarcely discernible.

NORWAY—LAND OF
PERPETUAL LIGHT! TILL
Norway is a delightful country. It
is nearly three and a half times bigger
than England, but its population is
less than one-third that of Greater
London.
In many places, in the small vih
lages particularly, the municipal elec'
trie light burns all day. Hydro'elec'
trie power is so cheap that it pays
to keep the light burning, for the cost
is a very small sum, rather than to
install expensive machinery for switch'
ing it on and off.
In fact, it is on record that people
have been fined for switching off the
lights!
The question of light plays quite
a large part in Norwegian life, be'
cause in the north they have what is
called the “Land of the Midnight
Sun. where during a part of the
year there are twenty-four hours of
daylight.
GLASS IN ARCHITECTURE
MANY USES AS BUILDING MATERIAL.
The ways in which glass is serving
us in our daily life are constantly
multiplying so that today glass in all
its varied forms contributes immeasur'
ably to our comfort and wellbeing.
In architecture, glass is rapidly
coming to the forefront as one of the
most modern fabricated materials.
It combines decorative and insulat'
ing qualities, as can be seen by the
uses it has been applied to on the
Continent, where fire protection is
an important consideration.
The invention of glass dates from
the earliest antiquity, and the honour
of its discovery has been contested by
several nations. As the oldest known
specimens are Egyptian, its invention
may with great probability be attrib'
uted to that people.
Among the Romans the glass'mak'
ing art does not date earlier than the
inception of the empire, but there
exists ample evidence that its use was
most extensive.
It is uncertain whether glass was
made in England before the 16th cem
tury, as that in use mav have been
imported from Flanders or Venice.
Benedict Bicop introduced makers of
glass windows into Northumbria in
674; but window glass was not gen'
erally used for windows till the 15th
century.
In 1771 the company of British
Plate'glass Manufacturers was estab'
lished in Ravenshead, near Prescot,
Lancashire.
In Scotland the manufacture was
begun in the reign of lames VI. in
1600 and glass was manufactured first
at Wemyss, in Fife, and afterwards at
Prestonpans and Leith.

Many Developments.
The enormous strides made by the
glass'manufacturing industry in recent
years have kept in step with progress
in the fields of architecture, building
and science.
Perhaps the greatest tribute that can
be paid to the glass industry is that
its many developments have brought
beauty and comfort into the lives of
milions.
Among the many products which
have contributed to our well'being are:
• Wire Glass: A combination of
wire and glass extensively used in
building operations, especially where
fire protection is an important consid'
eration.
• Glass Wool: This is merely spun
glass which has been shaped into
hanks or plates and solidified with
glue. The principle of all spun glass
and spun wool making is the fact
that when glass is heated it may be
drawn out so fine that more than
2000 glass fibres may be laid side by
side in the space of one inch. A
block of glass one foot long and
two inches square, containing four
pounds of glass, can be spun into a
3000 mile filament. Because of its
light weight it makes an efficient in'
sulating material.
9 Fibre Glass: First developed as a
substitute for asbestos in insulation,
fibre glass is now used for a variety
of purposes. As a textile material
fibre glass has many interesting possF
bilities. The newest glass yarn pro'
duced in U.S.A. is composed of 102
filaments, and has a length of 100,000
yards per lb. A single filament is one'
twentieth the diameter of the average
human hair, and stronger than a steel
fibre of equal diameter.
Cloth manufactured from glass
fibre has been successfully used for
wallpaper and electrical insulation.
• Safety Glass: Safety, or lamin'
ated glass consists of two sheets of
plate glass cemented together by a
plastic substance or gummy cement,
and is widely used in the motor indus'
try.
Safety glass will break, but the
pieces remain together, and will not
fly out of the pane.
A lesser degree of strengthening is
possible for ordinary window glass.
This is accomplished by adding salt
cake and alumina to the other consti'
tuents of standard window glass, and
such glass serves as a protection against
hail. It is also useful to offset the ef'
feet of high winds which might shat'
ter ordinary panes.
Modern Architecture.
With the development of modern
architecture, the 20th century has
produced a style of building which is
a natural expression of its time.
The techniques and aesthetics of
modern architecture have slowly evolv'
ed, emerging from the work of many
men. Careful analysis of the require'
ments of the building and of the pro'
ducts of industry and science have en'
abled architects to create structures
of surprising beauty and efficiency.
Accurate planning and precise
methods of construction are charac'
teristic of this architecture.
The skeleton frames are of steel,
reinforced concrete, and wood. Ma'
terials are metals, plywoods, plastics,
and extensive use of glass blocks (see
illustrations) with wood, brick and
stone used in new and ingenious ways.
Asthethic quality is. achieved by the
use of the open plan which is flex'
ible, fluid and usually asymmetrical.
The resulting spacical relationship
and interpenetrations of space are ef'
fected by large glass areas (see illus'
trations) simple, unornamented sur'
faces, colour, and textured materials.
A NEW PAINT SYSTEM
999 COLOURS FROM 16.
A recent demonstration in London
of the new Colorizer system introduc'
ed by Jenson and Nicholson for their
Robbialac paints gave convincing evi'
dence that this new development will
be a boon to all sides of the building
industry.
For a long while Architects have
deplored the lack of variety indicated
by the normal run of manufacturers’
colour cards, and much time has been
expended within the office or on the
site in mixing the exact shades of
paint desired. On the site the short'
age of experienced operatives has been
felt and the man who can mix paints
to exact colours may be something of
a rarity.
The colours for the new Colorizer
paint system are related to a system
used in the United States of America.
Colourants in 16 different colours
have been manufactured and these
mixed with a white or grey base en'
able 999 different colours to be struck.
There are 528 tints based on white
and 470 shades based on grey; the
grey itself completing the 999 colours.
No colour calls for more than two dif'
ferent colourants.
Colour samples of the various
shades and reference numbers are
available on cards measuring lOin x
2?in. x which are contained in
a leatherette case. This system is ideal
for carrving around and costs 25s post
free. An album with the tints and
shades graded on each page is also
available at a cost of £8 and this
would be ideal for the builders’ merclv
ant or for the stockroom.
As Mr. T. H. Vinnicombe (DF
rector of Jenson & Nicholson’s Decor'
ation Division) said, the colourants
used are entirely new and revolution'
ary and are not to be confused with
ordinary tints and stainers. The col'
ourants are supplied in eight different
sizes which serve to colour a gallon
or a small tin of white or grey paint.
Furthermore, the colourant which is
supplied in a tube is quickly squeezed
out and dispersed in the material by
stirring or even shaking gives perfect
repetition of the required shade.
Besides greater choice of colour,
some other advantages this system of'
fers are —The stockist needs less space
to store more colours. Brush hands
can do the paint mixing. The Con'
tractor has no need to “knock up”
large quantities of paint as small
amounts can be mixed to the exact
tint required. One tone lighter can
be selected for undercoats or the same
colour used for all coats.
The Colorizer system fs available
for the whole Robbialac range, En'
amel, Eggshell enamel, Suede finish
and Undercoat.
The cost of the Colorizer paints
compare favourably with others on
the market. In cases where large
quantities of one colour are required
this will be sent already mixed direct
from the manufacturers’ factory.
Robbialac Colorizer paints are to be
distributed from March, but at the
moment only to stockists in greater
London and the Home Counties. Un'
til distribution is wider, decorators
and builders outside the Home Coun'
ties will be supplied with any of the
new colours in any of the four finishes
direct from Jenson and Nicholson or
through their Decorators’ Merchants.
The new range of colours are con'
fined to the lighter tints and shades
as it was felt by the manufacturers
that these were the colours in most
demand for large areas of paint work.
But ten deep colours of Enamel are
available. It is intended at some fu'
ture date to enlarge the system to in'
elude the deep tones or saturated
colours for which there is undoubtedly
some demand. However, technically
it would appear a more difficult prob'
lem to produce an extension of the
present range in the deep tone colours.
In any case in a great many situations
flock papers or other materials in deep
tone colours would seem to be a
better answer than paint.

PLYWOOD IS A REMARKABLE PRODUCT
A CENTURY OF OUTSTANDING PROGRESS.
The progress plywood has made during the last 100 years is as equally
remarkable as this indispensable product itself.
It is interesting to trace the history
of the evolution of plywood since a
nowTorgotten American, John Dresser,
patented a primitive rotary lathe for
cutting thin sheets aof wood, which
were then called scales or scaleboards.
In those distant days, however, the
lathe was of little importance to wood
workers.
Around 100 years ago thin sheets
of wood- —now known as veneer —
could be made only by hand, and
little of it was available commercially.
One of the few forerunners of real
plywood was the pin block, or wrest
block, in a piano, made about 1830,
of several crossed layers of thin sawed
maple timber glued into a solid block.
Though the term “plywood” did
not come into common usage until
1916T8, these pin blocks, into which
the tuning pins were fastened, were
of this type of construction, since they
possessed dimensional stability. They
have been standard construction for
all pianos for almost a century.
“Balanced” Construction.
In technical parlance, plywood is
an assembly of wood made up of
three or more layers of veneer joined
with glue and usually cross'banded,
that is, laid with the grain of adjoining
plies at right angles.
Usually an odd number of plies is
used to obtain “balanced” construe'
tion, balance consisting in identical or
similar species, thickness, and arrange'
ment in the plies on either side of a
central ply or “core” so as to avoid
warping and twisting of the assembled
sheet or panel and to insure a mini'
mum of swelling and shrinking.
The foregoing is a general defini'
tion, since a definition satisfactory in
all details to those handling plywood
has not been agreed upon.
Plywood has been a common ma-
terial for furniture parts for many
years, wherever tough, thin panels,
are required. With the development
of waterproof, called exterior grade in
the U.S.A., forms of structural ply'
wood are coming into increasing use
concrete forms, prefabricated house
panels, small aircraft, and boats.
“Veneered” Construction.
Great quantities of “veneered con'
struction,” involving cross'banded
veneers or solid wood cores of various
thicknesses, enter into furniture pro'
duction. However, in stability with
respect to swelling and shrinking, pro'
ducts of this type are somewhere be'
tween allweneer plywood and solid
wood.
Adhesives.
In the history of plywood, the
twenty years between 1930 and 1950
saw the product make great progress.
The major factor was the perfection
of synthetic resin adhesives and of
hot'pressing, resulting in waterproof
plywood.
This alone opened up an enormous
field of utilisation for aircraft, boats,
and prefabricated buildings.
Tego film, the pioneer of the phenol
formaldehyde resin adhesives, first ar'
rived in the U.S.A. in 1933 from Ger'
many. It was first made in America
in 1937. Closely following were the
ureas, the melamines, and the resor'
cinols —all of them synthetic resin ad'
hesives ranging from high water re'
sistance to “completely waterproof.”
Some of them were supplied with
catalysts for hardening at room tern'
peratures, but the most durable prov'
ed to be the hot'pressed phenolic ply'
wood. Some of the multi'opening hot
presses of the blood'albumen period
were re'commissioned, and by 1940
many hot presses were again in ser'
vice.
The glues commonly used in bond'
ing veneers into plywood include
casein, soybean, and starch glues, all
setting at room temperature; “cold'
setting” urea glues that will harden
at 75° F. or above; urea formal'
dehyde and ’low'temperature” phenolic
glues that require temperatures from
90° to 160°F. such as can be obtain'
ed in a room or kiln with controlled
heat; and the majority of phenol'
formaldehyde and melamine-formalde'
hyde glues which require 200° to
300° and are therefore set between the
plates of a hot press.
Presses.
Press equipment ranges from simple
sets of hand clamps to giant multiple'
hot'plate presses, steam heated, capable
of supplying up to 300°F. of heat and
200 lb. pressure per square inch. Time
required under heat and pressure may
vary from a few minutes for thin ply'
wood to a couple of hours for extra
thick assemblies.
A rapidly developing method of
heating glue lines in plywood as the
use of high'frequency electric fields
which considerably shortens the time
required for glue setting.
Moulding.
In the manufacture of objects such
as boat hulls, seaplane pontoons, air'
craft parts, radar dromes, and similar
shelhlike constructions of plywood,
fluid pressure moulding (bag mould'
mg) may be resorted to. This may in'
volve the use of either atmospheric
pressure brought into play by draw'
ing a vacuum within a rubber bag
holding the object to be glued or by
inflating a rubber bag to press the
plywood being formed against a
mould. Heat to set the glue is sup-
plied throughout the bag or mould
by steam, steam-air, water, or air. In
the case of wood moulds the veneers
being used can be “tailored” to adjust
to the mould shape and lightly tacked
to the mould during the assembly per'
iod.
New Materials.
New materials and processes now
make it possible to increase the den'
sity of wood under high pressure.
Hardwood equivalents can be made
of impregnated softwoods, and ex'
cess density can be localised as re'
quired. Other variations are: ply'
wood'plymetals, with inner or outer
layers of metals for tough service, as
in truck bodies; paper or fibreTaced
plywood for smooth dense surfaces for
painting; plasticTaced plywood for
decorative or other purposes; and in'
ner or outer asbestos layers for fire
protection.

HORNSBY WAR MEMORIAL
A £16,000 PROJECT.
Following a recent survey of build-
ing costs, the Hornsby War Memorial
Committee has resolved to implement
a scheme to provide a memorial build'
ing for Hornsby Sub'branch, R.S.S.
and A.I.L.A.
The Committee was instituted in
1943, and later purchased a property,
“Camira,” in High Street, Hornsby.
An adjoining property was purchased
some time later, and the two proper'
ties are now assessed as being worth
£B2BO.
Three Blocks.
Mr. Ross Aynsley, a member of the
Sub'branch, was commissioned to
draw up the plans, providing for the
subdivision of the property into three
blocks.
On “A” block is situated “Camira”:
on “B” block will be erected the Mem'
orial with a frontage of about 80 ft.
to High Street. Block “C” is at pres'
ent occupied by a Diggers’ Hut.
The Memorial building (see illus-
tration ) provides for two shops and
a caretaker’s residence on the ground
floor, with vestibule and offices. On
the first floor will be a hall 46ft. by
30ft., together with necessary offices,
with a balcony 63 feet long across
the frontage of the building. A flat
roof will provide for a roof garden,
offering a magnificent vista for miles
around. A condition pertaining to the
erection of the hall is that the hall
cannot be used for licensed premises.
If the R.S.L. so decides, a licensed
clubroom can be erected on Block
“C.”
The approximate cost of the Mem'
orial as shown in the plans is £16,000,
and the Committee anticipates that
finance for building projects will soon
be made available, when advances
from 60 to 80% will be possible.
Television
Development
When Not Under Government
Control.
Whilst we, in Australia, have been
denied the right of enjoyment of tele'
vision through Government failure to
take the lead itself, whilst refusing to
let private enterprise carry the thing
through, other nations imbued with
a spirit of progress, are enjoying this
latest contribution to pleasure in the
home, to the full.
We find quite a number of books
are already being published on this
subject, and so far we haven’t read
a book.
Last week we had fully a dozen
such records sent to us.
Today, one came from Philips,
Eindhoven, Holland, announcing the
publishing of a new series of funda-
mental books on television containing
5 or 6 specialised monographs which
aim at supplementing the existing gen-
eral treatment of the subject. The first
book is:
“Television Receiver Design 1.
1. Stages.” By A. G. W.
Uitjens. 188 pages 6” x 9”.
123 ill.
and
“Television Receiver Design No.
2. “The Flywheel Synchroniza'
tion of Saw'Tooth Generators.”
By P. A. Neeteson.
The Government of Australia has
not yet decided how much of this
science, that it knows nothing about,
is due for coming under Governmental
control.
WHAT NEXT?
What wonderful methods the
Americans have developed to trans-
form old-fashioned eating methods
into something slick and modern.
First drug-stores then the automatics.
But Salt Lake City has beaten them
all. It has opened a “Grabiteria’’!

Removal of building restrictions is
making itself felt gradually in hotel
work, alterations and additions to
many commercial premises and in
home-building, but has not yet begun
to affect big construction. In smaller
jobs there appears to be plenty of
work, and in home-building, in par-
ticular. it is often difficult to get three
tenders.
By contrast, big contractors, with
expensive plant and equipment lying
idle, are looking for large industrial
and commercial work and cutting their
prices to the bone. A significant point
is that penalty clauses in contracts are
coming back, and have not so far dis-
couraged tenderers.
Institutional work is still providing
the biggest contracts apart from De-
partment of Works jobs. A contract
for the first section of the new
£lOO,OOO Burra Hospital has been let
to Emmett 6? Sons for £24,000. This
building, of nine rooms, hall and ser-
vices, will be used by nurses while the
rest of the hospital is built. It will
be particularly well-finished, with cork
floors and semastic skirting. Cliff
Dohnt, a local contractor, was the suc-
cessful tenderer, at £ll,OOO, for the
new nurses' home at the Onkaparinga
District Hospital at Woodside. This
includes a particularly large kitchen
unit so that the building can be used
later as domestic quarters when the
rest of the hospital is completed.
Prices are still being considered for
the first section of the Port Adelaide
Methodist Mission Old Folks’ Home.
It will be one of two 28-room wings,
each expected to cost about £30,000.
Tenders closed early this month for
the Keith and Millicent Hospitals, and
acceptance is expected soon. Tenders
for the Magill Children’s Home closed
on May 20.
A country job for which tenders
have just closed is the meat-chilling
works at Berri, comprising two cool-
ing chambers, each 40ft. by 10ft., a
cutting room and delivery platform.
Construction of a new slaughterhouse
is expected to follow soon.
State Government tenders called last
month were confined entirely to school
and hospital work. Tenders close on
June 3 for the new Minlaton High
School, comprising four classrooms,
two laboratories, four other school
rooms and staff quarters. The speci-
fications call for concrete brick con-
struction with galvanised iron roof.
Tenders close on May 27 for a new
bed lift installation, extending over
four floors, for the casualty building
at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, and
tenders are also being called for a new
X-ray suite, comprising a theatre and
work rooms, at the Morris Infectious
Diseases Hospital.
Jobs for which tenders are expected
to be called soon include the new ad-
mission block at Parkside Mental Hos-
pital, and about a dozen new schools
in various parts of the State.
In the local government field, ten-
ders have been called for additions to
the Henley Beach Town Hall, com-
prising a 27ft. by 31ft. building for
the immediate role of council cham-
bers and mayor’s parlour.
Commonwealth work has been
quieter, with fewer big contracts than
usual, and Woomera again furnishing
the largest jobs. Mechanical Handling
and Heating (S.A.) Ltd. last month
got a contract for the supply, delivery,
erection and testing of eight 5-ton
overhead travelling cranes at Woo-
mera, at £30,700.
Overseas Corporation have secured
a second contract in two months for
the internal finishing of a mess build-
ing at Woomera, the price in the latest
instance being £13,800. Tenders for
the construction of two reinforced
buildings at Woomera are being con-
sidered early this month.
Other Works Department contracts
include one for £lO,BOO for alterations
to hostel accommodation at Salisbury,
which went to G. H. Rippin, of
Henley Beach, and a £14,572 contract
for the supply and construction of a
Bellman hangar for use as a workshop
at the Adelaide Airport, secured by
Pricker Brothers.
Contracts for 90 War Service
Homes, in small groups, and mainly
at the new Golflands estate, have been
let during the month.
Renovations of city and country
hotels, in many cases long overdue, is
going ahead with the removal of con*
trols, and about a dozen jobs, small
individually but totalling quite a re*
spectable sum, have been let. One
firm of architects alone is handling
about £30,000 in contracts for work of
this kind. The order of costs is in-
dicated by the £7OOO for new men’s
and women’s bathroom blocks in one
of the smaller hotels.
Costs have caused the temporary
shelving of plans mooted in Adelaide
in the past few years for the so-called
“luxury” hotel. One of these was the
100 bedroom-bathroom hotel project-
ed by Lees on the site of their John
Bull Hotel in Currie Street. The
Statler Hotel project of Handby’s
Hotels was abandoned, and the land
in North Terrace offered at auction
last year.
Estimates of cost for such hotels
from the Eastern States suggest about

NOVEL USE OF CORRUGATED SHEETING.
This new building in Stuttgart, Germany, utilises corrugated sheeting in the span-
drels between the continuous rows of windows. No doubt economy of cost was
the reason for its use though the affect achieved is quite good. Local civic auth-
orities would probably have a seizure if it were proposed in Sydney.

The S.A. Brewing Co. is, however,
going ahead with its projected Hotel
Burleigh at Cheltenham. This two-
storeyed, 32-bedroom building is esti-
mated to cost about £90,000, or about
double the original estimates. The
plans provide for five bedrooms with
private bathrooms and five with pri-
vate showers, a guest lounge, U-
shaped public bar, saloon bar, and a
large public lounge opening on two
sides to a wide sunroom. Tenders are
expected to be called soon.
Other suburban hotels may follow
later this year, after applications for
new licences, following local option
polls, are heard. There are three ap-
plications from Semaphore and one
from Port Adelaide before the Licen-
sing Court, and Port Adelaide’s poll
would entitle it to seven new licences.
Alterations to new business premises
are many of the city’s streets
a face-lift. One is Walter and
Marsh’s building in Franklin Street,
which is expected to be finished this
month. Hansen 6? Yuncken have the
£12,000 contract. This firm was also
the successful tenderer at £14,000 for
alterations to Burford’s premises in
Sturt Street.
Marshall and Brougham have just
completed the £25,000 job of remodel-
ling the Commercial Bank’s head office
in King William Street. This includes
air-conditioning equipment supplied by
the Adelaide firm of W. Eglington 6?
Co. A new steel and concrete bulk
store for Malcolm Reid & Co. in York
Lane, at a cost of £25,000, is being
built by Hansen 6? Yuncken.
A new, modern frontage is
scheduled in Flinders Street, in the
shape of a building for British In-
sulated Callender’s Cables (Aust.) Ltd.,
for which tenders are being called.
This building will have as its basis
an old, six-roomed house, to which
will be added a flat-roofed, glass-fronted
showroom at the front and a store at
the back. The original building, com-
pletely renovated, will serve as an
office, Lester Bunbury is the designer,
and Milne, Dawkins, Boehm Ellis
have prepared the specifications.
Another city remodelling job is the
Civic Theatre, for which Lawson,
Cheesman Doley have called ten-
ders. This is a big project, involving
complete renovation, with air con-
ditioning, sound-absorbent walls and a
new ceiling to the auditorium.
A new building in the city for
which a contract was let last month
was the motor showrooms to be built
for Motors Ltd. in Brown Street. The
contract for the first portion of the
work, excavation and filling, went to
Wilckens 6? Burnside, at £40,000.
Work began early this month on
what is likely to be Adelaide’s largest
industrial building constructed of the
States most plentiful building material,
cut Mt. Gambier stone. This is a
24,000 sq, ft. extension to W. H.
Wylie & Company’s shock-absorber
factory at Hilton, estimated to cost
about £15,000. The contractor, W.
H. Blunden, has adopted this mate-
rial because of the urgency of the job,
which is expected to be finished with-
in three or four months.
The factory will make a wider
variety of shock-absorbers for Aus-
tralian and New Zealand users, and
when the addition is completed it will
be the largest of its kind in the
Southern Hemisphere. The original
plant, of about 40,000 sq. ft., was
built during the war by the same con-
tractor.
Adelaide’s first large blocks of self-
contained flats are proving popular,
and are filling up as fast as they are
completed. R. J. Nurse is the con-
tractor, for the S.A. Housing Trust,
and already 24 flats are occupied in
the first block, named Goodman Court
after the first chairman of the trust.
In all, 200 flats are contracted for, 52
on the Glenelg tramline at Plympton,
90 in three groups along Anzac High'
way, and another 90 at Fullarton.
Two of the Anzac Highway groups
are well-advanced, but work at Fullar-
ton is yet to begin. AH are to be
built of cut Mt. Gambier stone.
The flats are in three basic styles,
some on one floor, and others extend'
ing over two floors, with living-room
and kitchen on the ground floor, and
two bedrooms above. Each flat has
its own back and front door in this
layout, and all flats have lino floors,
Venetian blinds and canvas awning
blinds where necessary. The Trust

1 lays out and maintains gardens. The
j rents are £3/3/0 a week for single'
bedroom flats and £3/10/0 for two'
bedroom units.
Further building of flats, particular'
ly of the multi'Storey type, has been
I given some encouragement by an
amendment to regulations under the
Building Act governing proportions of
building area to vacant ground on ah
lotments. The Act previously required
j 150 sq. ft. of ground for each room
in a flat building—an obvious anomaly
|for a building of more than a few
[storeys. The amended regulations,
which are similar to those in the
Eastern States, require the proportion
of an allotment occupied by a build'
; ing and its appurtenances to be not
more than 50 per cent, for a single'
storey building, 40 per cent, for one
of two storeys, and 35 per cent, for
three or more storeys. This opens the
! way, as far as regulations are con'
cerned, for plans for multi'Storey flats
which have been proposed for North
Adelaide.
! Concrete brick manufacture, which
[sprang during the war from a small
[industry with only a few manufacturers
to a thriving business with many
operators, is in a fair way to becom'
ing placed on a permanent basis. Its
future has always been claimed to lie
in mechanical manufacturing methods,
and these are now being introduced
into S.A. by the Baldwin Brick Co.
in its plant at Magill.
i About £20,000 worth of machinery
jhas been installed, and this will en'
able the works to treble its former
capacity, to about 70,000 bricks a
week. The process means less labour,
better quality bricks and less curing
[time. Bricks pressed out by a 200'
ton press are cured in two days in
steam kilns, compared to the 28'day
curing required in the open air. Closer
kontrol is also claimed to turn out a
more uniform concrete brick.
New developments in building
[materials may also be expected from
research work in the ceramic section
of the S.A. School of Mines and In'
dustries, established five years ago. Its
head, Mr. R. Ellerton, was brought
from Stoke'on'Trent, the world’s
greatest centre of ceramic develop'
[ment, to work under the joint con'
jtrol of the School and C.SJ.R.O.
I Already a new form of perforated
brick, with 13 holes, has been de'
veloped. It is quicker to dry and fire,
saves 20 to 30 per cent, of clay, and
has a load'bearing capacity almost the
same as a solid brick. Hollow blocks,
with a saving of 40 to 50 per cent, in
day, have also been found suitable
for partition walls, where no great
weight is carried.

Report of Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia, held
at G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday, 7th May,
1953, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. G. C. T. Brown,
and 24 members and visitors were
present.
The minutes of the General Meet'
ing held on the Bth April, 1953, were
taken as read and confirmed.
Report from Council.
The President reported that Mr. J.
C. Knox, of Punchbowl, had been ad'
mitted as an Associate Member.
On behalf of Council the President
requested those members who had not
yet paid their subscriptions for the
current year to do so forthwith.
The President announced that the
Award for Meritorious Lighting Instab
lations, inaugurated last year, would
be continued this year. The subject
for the 1953 Award is Commercial
Lighting, and the closing date for em
tries is the 31st July, 1953.
The following panel of jurors have
been appointed:—
H. G. Fallon (Chairman), E. W.
Williams, J. S. Johnson, Mr. E. W.

tion of Australia), and a representa'
tive of the Retail Traders’ Associa'
tion.
Next Meeting.
The President announced that the
next meeting, to be held on Thursday,
4th June, would be a combined meet'
ing with the Electrical Contractors’
Association. The subject for the even'
ing is "Modern Trends in Lighting
Installations," and the two speakers
would be Mr. G. Y. Falk and Mr. W.
A. Smith.
Subject for the Evening.
The subject for the evening was a
paper entitled “Fluorescence and
Phosphorescence," which was deliver'
ed by Professor O. U. Vonwiller,
F.lnst.P.
At the conclusion of the paper an
informal discussion took place during
which members and visitors were able
to examine at close quarters the
various specimens exhibited by the
Professor during his address. In ex'
pressing his appreciation of the ad'
dress, Mr. J. Knight recalled some of
his experiences twenty years ago when
he attended Professor Vonwiller’s
classes at the Sydney University.
The vote of thanks was moved by
Mr. B. Austin and seconded by Mr.
Blunt, both of whom had also studied
under the Professor at the University.
WHAT ARE WE COMING TO?
Through the ages men have striven to give of their best to their God and in
the great churches, cathedrals, temples and mosques the very finest of artistic
and cultural development Is to be found. Today the opposite seems to be the case
and In certain quarters it is the most ugly, bizarre or distorted that appears to
be the criterion. We illustrate (top right) a crucifix for a church at Assy; (left)
a standing figure, and (centre) a bronze equestrian figure, which appears to have
only three and a halt legs, the two hind elongated legs and the curved front leg of
rubber, the head of a camel and the neck of-crazy!

Fluorescence and Phosphorescence
Delivered before The Illuminating Engineering Society of
Australia—N.S.W., May, 1953.
By PROF. O. U. VONWILLER, F.Inst.P.
The subject on which I am to speak
has a twofold interest; in the first
place because of practical applications,
increasing rapidly in number and im-
portance, and secondly because to the
scientist, endeavouring to find out how
things happen, it presents challenging
problems the solution of which seems
ever more difficult as our knowledge
grows. There is a close relation be'
tween achievement in research on the
scientific and on the technical side and
we find that many, if not most, of the
contributions to the purely scientific
aspect of the subject come from labo'
ratories associated with large industrial
corporations interested in the produc'
tion or use of photo-luminescent or
rather radioduminescent materials.
PhotO'luminescence is the emission
of light by bodies on which light fails,
the emitted light being of different
colour from that of the incident. In
practice we are interested mainly in
light emitted in the visible region of
the spectrum and for this the incident
light is in the invisible or ultraviolet.
However, as will be shown later undir
certain circumstances infra-red radii-
tions have a marked effect on lumines-
cence. Effects similar to those pro-
duced by light are obtained from many
materials by the incidence of cathode
rays, X-rays and the radiations from
radium and other radio-active sub-
stances. I am using the term radio-
luminescence to cover all cases of
luminescence induced by radiation
whether of light or of these last-
mentioned agencies . Luminance due
to chemical change and that displayed
at times by living vegetable and animal
matter does not come within our
scope.
In fluorescence the light persists
only while radiation is falling on the
material, ceasing almost instantaneous-
ly at its removal; in phosphorescence
there is an after glow, steadily de-
creasing in brightness, and lasting, in
some instances, only for a fraction of
a second, in others for many hours,
or even days. This distinction between
the two types of radio-luminescence
is satisfactory for practical purposes
though more exact definitions can be
given in terms of the physical pro-
cesses involved. Fluorescence does not
cease instantaneously with the cut off
of the exciting radiation, and Leverenz
calls materials fluorescent if the emis-
sion continues for less than one hun-
dred millionth of a second, phospho-
rescent if it lasts longer. Materials
displaying the effects are called respec-
tively fluorophors and phosphors.
Fluorescence had already been ob-
served in 1570, a tincture of wood of
a certain tree showing a blue light in
sunlight, and many similar results were
recorded later; this effect is like that
seen where sunlight falls directly, or
through the twin glass wall of a con-
taining vessel, on kerosene or petrol
The discoverer of phosphorescence
was a cobbler of Bologna named
Gascarido; a student of alchemy in his
leisure, in 1602 he found a mineral,
since shown to be a sulphide of
barium, “heavy spar,” also called
“Bologna stone,” that shone brightly
after exposure to sunlight. We can
imagine his excitement at what must
have appeared a step towards the goal
of the alchemist, the “philosopher’s
stone” with its expected virtues.
In 1652 Zecchi, examining the
effects of lights of different colours on
phosphorescent materials, made the
important discovery that, while some
colours were more effective than
others, the colour of the phosphores-
cent light from a given material was
independent of the colour of the ex-
citing light.
Passing over many observations
made during the next two centuries
we find that systematic experimental
observations were made in England in
the middle of the nineteenth dentury
by Brewester, Herschel and, particular-
ly, Stokes; their work was mainly on
fluorescence. At that time the wave
theory of light was well-estabilshed
and the principle of the conservation
of energy and its significance were be-
ginning to be appreciated by scientists.
(I have a text book on Physics,, dated
1849, in which that principle is not
mentioned!)
Stokes realised that in fluorescence
(and phosphorescence) we have an
instance of transformation of energy,
the energy in the incident light being
absorbed and re-emitted, wholly or in
part, by some then unknown process,
as light of different wave length. Of
course, with many materials there is
absorption of light without emission,
the absorbed energy being accounted
for by development of heat, chemical
changes, electrical effects, etc. Stokes
found further that, when excited by
nearly monochromatic' light, that is

light covering a narrow spectral range,
the colour of fluorescence was indepen'
dent of the wave length of the excit'
mg light, the colour of course varying
with different materials; this corres'
ponds with Zecchi’s finding, two cen'
turies earlier, for phosphorescence.
From his observations Stokes made
an important generalisation known as
Stokes Law: the fluorescent radiation is
always of longer wavelength than the
exciting rays. For example, a green
fluorescence is not excited by red light
or a blue by green. As with many
generalisations, there are exceptions to
this law and in fact it was questioned
at the time of its pronouncement;
however, it is a very close and valuable
approximation to the truth and holds
for phosphorescence equally with
fluorescence. It was not until early
in the present century that Planck’s
quantum theory and Bohr’s theory of
spectra explained Stokes law and the
occasional exceptions, and paved the
way for present day attempts at pic-
turing the atomic processes involved
in fluorescence and phosphorescence.
In Figure 1 is a diagramatic pre'
sentation of the main facts of Stokes’
work. Wavelengths are represented
by distances along the horizontal line,
the shorter being at the left. The
visible spectrum is from V (violet) to
R (red). In a given materials fluores'
cence, or phosphorescence, might be
excited by light of any wavelength be'
tween, say, A and B, the spectrum of
the excited light extending from C to
D and the intensity in this spectrum
at any wavelength being given by the
height of the curve a, b or c, at the
corresponding point. Radiation, of
the same power ,of wavelengths mark'
ed a’ b’ and c’, between A and B,
might give spectra a, b, c, between
C and D, the radiation not being
equally efficient in producing lumines'
cence; the work of Stokes, and Zecchi.
indicates that the heights of the curves
a,b,c, have the same proportions at
all points between G and D. Stokes’
law states that the region AB will lie
wholly to the left of CD, that is
every exciting wavelength is shorter
than any excited one.
However, in some instances there is
an overlapping of the exciting band
AB and the emission band CD, so
that the longer exciting wavelengths
might cause an emission, part of which
would have a shorter wavelength.
Even in such a case most of the emis'
sion would have greater wavelength
and what might be called the weight'
ed average wavelength of the emission
is greater than that of any exciting
wavelength.
Of course, with some materials we
have luminescence spectra, correspond'
ine with CD, extending into the infra'
red or the ultra-violet, and the ex-
citing region AB might be wholly in
the ultraviolet or in the visible. Fur'
ther, there may be more than one
band of exciting light, each perhaps
producing its own luminescent band,
especially when mixtures of phosphors
are used.
During the second half of the nine'
teenth century steady advance was
made, especially in devising instrumen'
tal methods for determining short de'
cay periods. At this time screens coat'
ed with small crystals of phosphors
were used a good deal as detectors in
the study of ultraviolet light; a by'
product of extreme importance was
the discovery of X'rays by Roentgen
in 1895.
Three advances in atomic physics
made early in the present century
have an important bearing on our sub'
ject. Plancks’ quantum theory of
radiation postulates that light is ab'
sorbed or emitted in definte quanta or
units of energy inversely proportional
to the wavelength and that in a beam
of light of given' wavelength we have
an integral number of photons each
with the energy of the corresponding
quantum; as the wavelength of the ex'
treme red is about double that of the
extreme violet the photon of violet
has about double the energy of a
photon of red. Next, Rutherfords’
theory of the atom consisting of a
tiny positively charged nucleus round
which revolved still tinier negatively
charged electrons, as the planets re'
volve round the sun, shows how an
absorbed photon might give the
energy required to take one of these
electrons to an orbit further from the
nucleus, and, thirdly, Bohr advanced
the theory that in an atom there were
only certain stable orbits in which an
electron could revolve. The energy
of the atom depended on the orbit
occupied by an electron and if an
electron went from one to another
the*re would be a loss or gain of energy
which might be balanced by the emis'
sion or absorption of a photon of the
appropriate wavelength.
Later experimental and theoretical
work has given what is doubtless a
more correct, but at the same time less
definite, picture of the atom, but we
can use this earlier one to get some
idea of the processes under discussion.
At once we see that Stokes’ law can
be reconciled with the theory if we
accept the view that, in absorption of
a photon, all the energy goes into a
single electron, which is thus raised
to an orbit or level for which the
energy of the atom is correspondingly
greater than the initial one. If, then,
emission is caused by the return of
such displaced electrons to a lower
energy level, at most for each absorb'
ed photon we have one emitted photon
and we cannot expect a gain of energy
the wavelength of the emitted light
must be not less than that of the ab'
sorbed; when we apply this to the
more complex states of matter, liquids
and solids, it can be shown that almost
invariably there must be a loss, some
of the energy absorbed from the pri'
mary proton being given up to add
to the vibrational energy of the atoms
forming the molecules of a liquid or
forming a solid crystal. Hence the
emission photon has less energy and
therefore a longer wavelength than
then absorbed one. In exceptional
cases some of the vibrational energy
that all molecules and crystals have,
even at the lowest temperatures, might
be given up in some way and added
to the energy of an absorbed photon
to give an emitted photon of greater
energy and less wavelength than the
exciting one. This is the exception to
Stokes’ law.
At this stage a little might be said
about the efficiency of a fluorescent or
nhosphorescent process. This might
be expressed in several ways. As we
have seen, equal quantities of incident
light energy of different wavelengths
give quantities of emitted light energy
but, within limits, the light energy
emitted is proportional to the light
energy absorbed, the differences being
due to the fact that not all the in'
cident light is absorbed but some may
be transmitted through the medium,
reflected at various surfaces, etc.
Hence we may state the efficiency
as the ratio of the light energy emit'

ted per second to that absorbed, both
being measured in watts. If we are
concerned with observations by eye
we must take into account the sen'
sitivity curve of the eye and, as with
any illuminant, state the performance
in lumens per watt, as of course the
supplier of “fluorescent” lamps does.
But often it is convenient to speak of
the photon efficiency, the ratio of the
number of photons emitted per second
to the number absorbed; this may be
as great as one, but it must be re'
membered that some of the photons
emitted in the body of even a very
small crystal may be absorbed before
they reach the surface. Even though
the photon efficiency may be com'
paratively low the process may be of
value in transforming absorbed short
wavelength light for which the eye is
insensitive to light in the visible spec'
trum as in the fluorescent lamps where
most of the energy of the electric dis'
charge in the mercury vapour is given
out in the form of light waves well
in the ultraviolet. Much of this, fall'
ing on the phosphorescent coating on
the inside of the tube, is changed into
visible light with a spectral distribution
depending on the nature of the phos'
phor used, giving radiation, from a
comparatively cold source, of a quality
that would be given with thermal ex'
citation only at temperatures unattain'
able with incandescent solids and with
light efficiency, in lumens per watt,
greater than with any form of incan'
descent lamp.
About 40 or 45 years ago Lenard
and fellow workers in Germany car'
ried out a long investigation on the
production and examination of phos'
phors. Their work forms the basis of
present day methods of productions
and Lenard gave a theoretical picture
of the atomic processes that, in its
essentials, is that accepted by scientists
to'day.
Lenard 1 found that chemically pure
crystals of a substance such as zinc
sulphide showed little or no phospho'
rescence, but that when the substance
contained a small quantity of some
other element, such as copper or silver,
it might be highly phosphorescent.
He found that in general a phosphor
consisted of host crystals, such as sub
phides, selenides, silicates, phosphates,
and tungstates, of various metals, these
crystals usually being nearly trans'
parent, and small quantities of some
other metal that he called an activator.
In addition, a third constituent was
sometimes of advantage, a flux such as
sodium chloride. The flux was prob'
ably of use in ensuring the mixing
and uniform distribution of the ac'
tivator during the fusion and other
heat treatments in preparation, and
perhaps in controlling the size of the
crystals that cooled out, this being a
factor of importance. The term phos'
phor is tO'day restricted to such pre-
parations.
Lenard found that there was an
optimum quantity of an activator in a
given host crystal, greater or less quan'
titles giving a lower efficiency. This
quantity varies a lot; in a zinc sulphide,
copper amounting to about 0.01 per
cent., that is about one part in ten
thousand, gives the best effect, while
in a zinc silicate one per cent, or more
r . . T i
of manganese is required In natural-
ly occurring phosphors the crystals are
not pure but contain activators, for
r
example, the mineral willemite is a
v,. .. ,
zinc silicate containing a little man'
ganese.
In a crystal we have an orderly
array of atoms arranged in regular
geometrical patterns. In Lenard’s view,
accepted to-day, the activator atoms
formed what he called centres of one
of two types. In one, the foreign
atoms replaced one of the atoms of
the crystal; thus in a zinc sulphide,
made up of atoms of zinc and sulphur,
a small number of the zinc atoms
might be replaced by atoms of the
activator, copper for instance, and each
copper atom introduces a tiny abnor-
mal region in the crystal because the
electric and other forces between it
and the neighbouring atoms are dif'
ferent from those for an atom of zinc.
Such centres Lenard called substitu'
tional or s centres. In the other type
e , activator atoms apparently find
their way into spaces between the
regular layers of atoms that charac'
terise crystals, causing small local dis'
tortions; these centres are called inter'
stitial or i centres.

plain the slow decay he assumed that
such escaped electrons did not imme'
diately return under the attractive
force of the positive charge on the
atoms but in some way were held im'
prisoned in what are called traps,
regions from which there is a definite
but small chance of escape. If, as the
result of the incidence of light, a
large number of electrons are im'
prisoned in traps, after the light is cut
off they might be expected to escape
and return to atoms that have lost an
electron at a rate proporlional to their

number, giving out phosphorescent
light with corresponding intensity, if
the energy lost in the action results in
the formation of the equivalent
photon. Thus, if 100,000 electrons
are in traps when the exciting light is
cut off, and 100 return each second,
when, in the course of time, the num-
ber in traps has fallen to 50,000 we
should expect the rate of escape to be
50 per second and so on, the rate of
escape and the intensity of the emit'
ted light falling according to what is
known as an exponential law with
time. In some instances the decay does
follow this law, but generally it has
more complicated forms; however, it
is not difficult to devise explanations
of these by assumptions of different
kinds of traps and by modifications of
the procedure.
Later it was found by Gudden and
Pohl that the crystals of phosphors
were rendered temporarily conducting
by the light that caused luminescence
indicating that the effect of the ab'
sorbed photon was to detach com'
pletely the electron from the atom so
that it was free to respond to an ex'
ternally applied electric field, and in
this state it might be supposed to
wander until entrapped. In modern
developments from Lenard’s theory the
picture is a more complicated one; the
absorbed photon removes an electron
from an atom of the host crystal, the
energy given raising it to the “con'
ducting level”; this electron, with some
loss of energy by a “radiationless”
process, “falls” into a trap; an activat'
ed atom also gives up an electron,
with some radiationless loss of energy
to the host atom, and finally the ac-
tivator atom receives the electron from
the trap with the emission of a photon,
the energy of which must be less than
than that of the originally absorbed
photon because of the losses in the
two radiationless changes. These
losses presumably go to increase the
vibrational movements of the atoms
in the crystal.
The traps are usually regarded as
imperfections of some kind in the
crystal, possibly aiising in the forma'
tion from solution or fused mass, as
minute cracks or local slight departures
from the perfect geometrical form, etc.
They are “potential” traps, regions in
which the electrical forces on an elec
tron due to the charges in neighbour'
ing atoms prevent its escape. As these
atoms are all in a state of vibratory
motion, more energetic as the tern'
perature rises, sooner or later they
may be momentarily so placed that the
electron escapes, of rather is ejected,
and is free to fall to the lower energy
level of the activator atom.
In gases and liquids we have fluores'
cence only; in solids we may have
fluorescence and phosphorescence, and
a return without the delay of a trap
might be called fluorescence. We can
understand that, in a fluid, traps, which
reasonably might be expected to de'
mand some approach to rigidity in the
material, would not exist.
During the second world war there
was great activity in research on the
production and properties of phos'
phors, especially on those sensitive to
the incidence of cathode rays for
screens used in. radar equipment and
for other purposes. Since the war this
activity has increased with the de'
mands of television, and most impor'
tant of all perhaps the “fluorescent”
lamp, as well as many other purposes
such as X'ray screens, luminous pig'
ments, etc.
Naturally, different phosphors have
to be used to meet the different re'
quirements such as rate of decay of
afterglow, colour, conditions of ex'
citation, etc. Further, there is always
room for improvement justifying the
search for new phosphors.
The annual production of phos'
phors must be several hundred tons,
the greatest demand being for fluores'
cent lamps. Leverenz estimates, that
well over 100,000 samples of phos'
phors have been synthesised and test'
ed in various laboratories during the
past 20 years, and points out that
while it is easy to devise a new phos'
phor it is difficult to prepare a “sue
cessful” new one, that is one that can
be produced again at will, and that
sheds new light on the mechanism of
luminescence or is superior to existing
phosphors for practical purposes.
It is only by systematic and pro'
longed careful experiment that the
best composition can be determined
for the puropose required and, of
course, an important practical point
is the permanence of the properties;
for example in a fluorescent tube the
action of the mercury vapour, or of
the very short wave radiation from
the mercury dischargs might cause a
progressive fall in efficiency.
A lot of attention is given to the
heat and other treatment in the pre'
paration of the phosphors; changes
in this may cause a big difference in
efficiency.
In many phosphors the presence of
extremely small quantities of an im'
purity may reduce the efficiency to a
remarkable extent; this is not surpris'
ing in view of the small quantities of
activators used in some phosphors. For
example in a zinc sulphide phosphor
activated with 0.01 per cent, of cop*
per it was found that when prepared
with the addition of one part of
nickel in a million the phosphor was
inactive and it is stated that one part
in 1000 million of nickel would pro'
duce an appreciable loss of efficiency.
This would be 1/60 grain in a ton!
Yet this, at first sight incredibly
small quantity, means that in one
ounce of the phosphor the number
of nickel atoms would be given by 3
with 14 noughts after it!
It is readily seen that exacting de'
mands are made in the matter of pur'
ity of constituents for phosphors. The
tolerances however, are greater in
those instances in which larger quant'
ities of activator are used. For ex'
ample in a zinc silicate activated with
one per cent, of manganese about one
part in ten thousand of nickel is re'
quired to annul the activity. Impur'
ities that destroy or reduce the sensi'
tivity of phosphors are called poisons.
On the other hand in some instan'
ces the addition of a metal may add
to the sensitivity and in many phos-
phors there are two kinds of activators.
Time does not allow more than a
mention of this.
In Figure 2 are illustrated some of
the phenomena of decay of phosphors.
It will be noted that the rate of rise

of luminescence is related to the rate
of decay after the exciting radiation
is cut off. The decay curve (2) il-
lustrates the phenomena of quenching
(3) and stimulation (4), effects some-
times found when red light or infra-
red light falls on the phosphor during
the decay.
Quenching is a rapid falling off in*
luminosity when the long wave radia-
tion is applied, while stimulation is an
initial rise in brightness followed by
a more or less rapid decay as indicat-
ed in the diagram. In many instances
the presence of a small amount of a
second activator has a big influence on
the stimulation by infra-red light. The
magnitude of the effect depends on
the wavelength of the infra-red light.
Explanations of these effects are stilL
in the speculative stage; the absorp-
tion of long wave radiation may in-
crease the vibrational activity of atoms
in the neighbourhood of traps enabl-
ing a quicker escape of electrons from
the traps andso a greater intensity of
the phosphorescent light with, of
course, a more rapid decay. Quench-
ing without stimulation must be the
result of the electrons escaping from
the traps and giving their energy,
not in the form of light but, in addi-
tion to the vibrational energy of the
atoms, in the form of heat.
Mention must be made of the effect
of temperature on phosphorescence. In
general there is a temperature for
which the emission is a maximum,
this temperature varying widely with
the nature of the phosphor. At high-
er temperatures the width of the
spectral emission band is increased
and at lower temperatures it becomes
narrower; in some instances the wave-
length for which the emission is great-
est changes with the temperature. An
interesting effect is that if an excited
phosphor is subjected to very low tem-
perature, such as that of liquid air,
the luminescence may cease but on re-
storing it to room temperature the
glow comes on again; the light is
“fro zen in” at the low temperature.
We can imagine the escape of an elec-
tron from a trap is conditioned by the
vibrational activity of the neighbour-
ing atoms; at very low temperatures
this is correspondingly small and there
are no escaping electrons. An increase
in temperature increases the rate of
decay as might be expected.
This necessarily rather sketchy ac-
count at least should indicate the
complexity of the subject and the vast
amount of work that has been done
in tKis field. Time does not allow
mention of the contributions of many
workers such as Goethe, Becquerel,
Wood. Nicholls and Merrit, to name a
few. Below is a short list of recent
publications on the subject; in these
are bibliographies of earlier work, one
giving a list of 750 papers.

British Building Briefs
Cheap “Blitz Site” Homes.
Plans for building thousands of
cheap “short term” houses on Lon-
don’s blitzed sites are being consider-
ed by London County Council.
The homes would be designed to
last about 20 years and some would
be built on existing walls of old pro-
perty to cut costs.
The L.C.C. Housing Committee re-
cently started a probe into which
boroughs were not using the “precious
space’’ of blitzed sites.
The Council claims that the “short-
term” homes would mean that Lon-
don might get a minimum of 5000
new houses much sooner than expect-
ed.
Cut Costs, Speed-up Housing.
Moves to cut costs and speed-up
house building have been recommend-
ed by a British Government report.
Recommendations include use of
standardised doors, floors, cupboards,
plumbing, wiring fittings, and the
building of narrower council houses
with lower ceilings and interior walls
made of substituted materials.
These recommendations, the report
states, could be put into effect im-
mediately.
They are far-reaching, and, by
standardising internal fitments costs
can be cut and housing speeded-up.
The chairman of the committee
that made the report. Sir Donald
Bailey, inventor of the Bailey Bridge,
said: “We are suggesting a co-ord-
ination of existing methods of mass-
production and standardisation—to
produce more houses at less cost.”
MOUNTAINS THAT “WALK”
When a village near Modena in
Italy was overwhelmed by a landslip
one night recently, the 300 villagers
were evacuated just before the slow-
moving mass of rock and earth, nearly
a mile wide, engulfed their homes.
Continuous heavy rains caused the
disaster.
Landslides often occur with dra-
matic suddenness. Forty people perish-
ed when one occurred at the little
French watering place of Roque
Billiere in 1926. Taken by surprise
during the night by a torrent of water
and mud which came down from the
mountains and swept across the village,
the panic-stricken people rushed from
their houses to seek refuge in another
part of the town. But they were
caught in a torrent and carried away
in the mud and flood waters.
About 25 years ago a hillside was
found to be slipping near Dorking,
England. Thirteen acres were sliding
rapidly downhill and over 100,000
tons of earth were dislodged. A river
had undermined the base of the hill.

We Can’t Stop
To Worry
On the occasion of the opening of
the new premises of the Sydney
Chamber of Commerce, the President
(Mr. F. G. Moat) said that when the
Chamber’s Council decided to embark
upon the project there was more a
tendency amongst some sections of
the community to build a wailing wall,
rather than an edifice symbolizing con-
fidence in our future.
The opening address was delivered
to a gathering of Trade Commission'
ers and Commercial Consuls of over'
seas countries, Government officials
and prominent business men.
Mr. Moat contended that his Coun-
cil’s faith in the future has been vim
dicated by events since the decision
was made, and pointed to the revival
in overseas trade —the principal yard'
stick of our prosperity—and the ulti'
mate pick'Up in the tempo of internal
trade which was gathering momentum
as each section of industry and com-
merce solved the problems of the lev-
elling out period.
Having passed through a testing
period, and, incidentally, learned an-
other lesson, the future is bright, said
Mr. Moat, and pointed to the conser-
vation schemes now in progress, and
the improved farming methods which
are already paying dividends not only
to the farmers but the finances of the
Commonwealth and people. He also
gave instances of industrial expansion
throughout the State and the Com'
monwealth, which he said must pass
on benefits to the citizens of Australia.
We are too young and virile as a
country to allow slight reverses to
worry us. There are too many things
to be done for us ever to despair of
our future, said Mr. Moat.
In regard to the Chamber’s history,
Mr. Moat told an interesting story
from its early beginnings in 1826, in
the days of Governor Darling, to its
world'wide ramifications and influence
today. The word picture he outlined
fully justified his final words:
“Gentlemen, proud of our past,
and confident of our future, I de'
dare these premises open.”
WOMAN WAS FIRST.
A woman had met Thomas Edison,
famous American inventor, for the
first time, and she just wouldn't stop
talking. For the tenth time she turn*
ed to the celebrated man and bleated:
"You will go down in history, Mr.
Edison, as the inventor of the first
talking machine.”
“Indeed, no, madam,” replied Edi-
son. “I am not the pioneer in the
field. The first talking machine was
invented by the Almighty, and I
merely invented one that could be
stopped at will!”

CORNER OF QUEEN AND EDWARD STREETS, BRISBANE.
In the November, 1952, issue of
“Building: Lighting: Engineering”
there appeared on page 25 a picture
of the remodelled “Courier” news'
paper building which had been pur'
chased by Finney Isles 6? Co. Ltd. as a
branch of their principal establishment
in the next block.
Within a few months of this extern
sive remodelling, these four'Storeyed
premises have been sold to the Com'
monwealth Bank for the sum of
£261,000, a sum very much in excess
of the price which Finney Isles 6? Co.
Ltd. were reported to have paid. It
has been stated that Finney Isles &
Co. Ltd. will continue to conduct the
very extensive cafeteria establishment
in the basement, and also a refresh'
ment bar in Queen Street at the ex'
treme right'hand side of the building.
This large purchase by the Com'
monwealth Bank has been made in
order to establish another savings
bank, although the main office at the
corner of Adelaide and Albert Streets
is only a block and a half away. It
will take at least six months before
the alterations can be made to the
new acquisition to equip it for savings
bank business.
In addition to these city banks, a
sum of £70,000 is being spent in the
modernisation of the Commonwealth
Bank. Fortitude Valley, in Wickham
Street near Brunswick Street, a job
which is expected to take ten to twelve
months to complete.

The Waterproofing of Concrete Structures
EXTRACTS FROM A PAPER GIVEN AT THE INSTITUTION OF
SANITARY ENGINEERS, LONDON.
By ISAAC HOPKINS, M.S.E., .I.Struct.E., A.I.S.E.
Design.
From experience in structural inves*
tigations I feel that, even to'day, it is
not fully realised and appreciated what
effect the design has upon the ultimate
result in the form of the completed
structure. I am referring mainly to
underground construction, which is
liable to be subjected to ground water
pressure.
If the designer gave more attention
to the matter of soil mechanics, site
conditions, and the practical limits
concerned, I feel that a good deal of
the structural defects which I have
personally investigated could have been
eliminated to a very large degree.
Construction.
Normally the mixing of concrete is
taken as being of an elementary charac*
ter. This idea is fatal, and I have no
doubt is the cause of many failures in
concreting work. Concrete mixing
and uses is a science and every detail
has to be taken into account in order
to produce the best results.
The first essential is to see that the
sand and aggregate are of the best
qualities, accurately proportioned with
the cement, thoroughly mixed and
well placed. Secondly, and far more
important, is to see that the concrete
is not disturbed in any shape or form
after the initial set has occurred, and
this is normally taken as being in
about thirty minutes after mixing, and
which gives ample time for placing
and so on. The matter of disturbing
the setting process is generally over*
looked and has been the means of
causing many failures as far as con*
creting work is concerned.
Methods of Waterproofing.
(1) Asphaltic or sheeting mem*
branes.
(2) The usage of waterproofers in
the concrete.
(3) Plain concrete.
(4) Waterproof renderings.
(5) Pumping.
(6) Colloidal concrete.
(7) Pressure grouting.
The first method has been used for
many years and is commonly used to*c
day, but is being replaced to a very{
large extent by the other methods!
enumerated.
The membranes have to be loaded)
against water pressure in the case ofh
both walls and floors, with the resultll
that when the work is completed)
means of access is eliminated. If as
fault develops due to settlement oik
some other factor it is extremely difd
ficult, if not impossible, to find thes
location of the fault. I feel that tho
design and layout are very often aOj
fault in being unnecessarily complex
cated, and could have been simplified,!
thereby giving the operator a muchrl
better opportunity of making tho
membrane continuous.
Another factor is that during tho
application of the membranes, th©
ground water should be kept well!
down by means of pumping opera-i
tions, so as to give dry conditions,?
which are essential.
There seems to be a conception thatJj
if the lower foundation concrete isi
correctly designed, that the membranes;
can be laid on this, and do not re-';
quire a loading concrete
strong to counteract the water pres-?
sure. I have seen many faults developq
because of this, it not being realisedb
that the ground water can developq
pressure between the lower slab andb
the membrane, thus lifting the load*!
ing concrete.

(2) Waterproofed Concrete.
There are numerous liquids, pastes
and powders which can be added to
the mixing water for waterproofing
concrete.
There are also cements obtainable
in which the waterproofing medium is
integral with them. It is a common
fallacy that if these mediums are used,
an impervious concrete is obtained,
even though normal methods are used.
Even though a waterproofing
medium is used, first-class methods
should be applied, it is not sufficiently
realised that waterproofed concrete is
highly specialised.
The main faults are bad joints, no
allowance for contraction due to
seasoning, no consideration for tem-
perature variations, and bad placing.
In the case of daywork joints, the
old work should be hacked to give
100 per cent, exposure of the aggre-
gates, well cleansed, watered, and
given a one inch coating of 1 to 2
mortar with the waterproofer incor-
porated, before the next lift is placed.
Against the possibility of contrac-
tion the small gap system is common-
ly used. This consists of leaving gaps
24in. wide or so in the construction.
These being filled in later when the
major contraction has occurred in the
main structure. Surface treatment at
the gap should be as in construction
joint practice.
Another deterrent against contrac-
tion is the use of plasticizers which
tend to reduce the water content whilst
retaining the same workability. I may
add that most waterproofing additives
act as plasticizers, or lubricants.
The basic factor is to keep the
water content to a minimum, by cor'
rect proportioning, adequate mixing,
and final water seasoning of the work,
for at least 14 days after completion,
the longer the better.
(3) Plain Concrete.
The question as to whether plain
concrete can be made waterproof is
highly disputable.
Many of our most eminent en-
gineers say it has and can be done.
I read in a technical book on con-
Crete some years ago that the water-
proofing of concrete structures is a
question of making construction joints
watertight.
This is true, because it is found that
making a concrete mass in strict ac-
cordance with the best standard prac-
tice results in it being impervious.
Success with plain concrete depends
on. first, the materials and methods
used, and secondly, a degree of
porosity in the aggregate which gives
a better bond with the mortar.
I have found that with a completely
impervious aggregate the bond is not
perfect, resulting in water travelling

Waterproofed Rendering.
This method is becoming increas— :
ingly popular. It has two fundamen-
tal attributes.
First; The structure itself can bea
built by normal methods,
specialised operatives.
Secondly; Any faults, due to settle'!
ment or temperature effects, can bea
located and remedied. In the case off
concrete construction it is
difficult, if not impossible, to control I
each of the various operations, where' \
as, with renderings the work can bea
done by a group of highly trained I
men.
The waterproofing medium used is e
the same as in concrete, but proper' ■»
tions may be different. The methods I
used are as important, if not more s
important, than the additives, in the a
form of liquids, powders, or special 1
cements.
The primary factor is to obtain a i
good bond between the rendering and 1
the structure. This can be done by a
adequate preparation and correct d
method of applying the renderings; ;
with lapping, the use of gaps, and so (
on.
The grading and type of sand, and f
thorough mixing, are important, with i
special care given to the water season' [
ing of the work.
With this method the question of f
continuity to form the internal tank' >
ing may present some difficulty.
I would like to emphasise here that d
renderings are integral with the struc' '
ture, so that the necessary precautions ?
in designing against structural move'h
ment are vital.
(5) Pumping.
A system of internal pumping is 8
largely used in cases where structural!
movement has occurred and the water-
proof lining is not easily accessible.
The main objection is the question!
of silting, creating undermining andl
possible settlement of the structure.
(6) Colloidal Concrete.
We enter a new phase when wes
consider colloidal concrete. Muchr
has been done and a good deal known,,;
but there is still a wide field of re-
search to be dealt with in its applica-
tion.
Colloidally mixed, a cement mortan
has attained its maximum as far ass
water content is concerned, and thiss
can be proved in a practical mannen
quite simply. Take a bucket full off
water, then a bucket full of colloidalh
grout. Then pour the grout slowlyy
into the water bucket, along the edge..:
It will be found that the grout will!!
displace the water without dispersal.,!
This is an extremely important charac'-:
teristic. The grout is waterproof
out the addition of any agents.

The method of concrete making is
I to select a nomporous aggregate, place
[ in position, then add the grout which
I fills in all voids and forms the mass.
Its main uses are for road work,
I mass retaining walls, and similar con'
I struction.
I have no doubt that a concrete
I structure built with this system would
be watertight provided the correct
materials are used, and the best em
I gineering practice observed.
(7) Pressure Grouting.
This is mainly a remedial measure,
and used in connection with existing
structures. Its uses have.been known
for many years, and it is now a highly
specialised system.
Primarily it consists of injecting a
! prepared cement by pressure to the
outside of underground concrete con'
struction, also, in cases, into the con'
; struction itself.
This fills any cavities or any voids
which may be present, preventing the
entry of ground water.
Its use has been extremely success'
ful, but, as in the case of any
specialised work, long experience is
required as there are so many factors
to be taken into consideration.
Summarizing These Methods.
From my experience a balanced ap'
plication of systems two and four is
the most easily applicable, and the
most economical.
The following fundamentals repre'
sent the case for these systems.
(1) Ease of application, and more
continuity of construction.
(2) Less excavation, and economy
on pumping costs.
(3) Easier access to remedy defects
from whatever cause they may
originate.
The application of these systems
must originate from the drawing board
stage. Afterthoughts during construe'
tion are sometimes unavoidable, but
should, and could, be eliminated, pro'
vided every phase of the problem is
given adequate thought and considera'
tion.
Rectifying Faults.
The most common fault is the coiv
traction crack, due to seasoning of the
concrete.
Based on the assumption that the
concrete is impervious, the procedure
is either to pressure grout the crack,
or cut out and reform in waterproofed
concrete or rendering.
If ground water is coming through
the crack, it can be dealt with by
quick'setting mortar. Usually the
crack is filled in solid. If, however,
it is considered that further movement
is suspected, an expansion joint is
formed.
It will be realised, also, that access
is required to the faults. This is
normally the case, but sometimes
machines, in the form of pumps, en-
gines and switchgear, may have been
erected and cannot be removed for
access purposes. In cases of this type,
local or total pressure grouting is the
answer.
Underwater Construction.
Underwater construction in concrete
has been carried out for many years.
Its use has developed in recent years,
due to the introduction of various
types of liquid accelerators, used for
mixing the concrete, or cement mor'
tar, as the case may be. There are
also types of cement suitable for urn
derwater construction.
The main factor in connection with
the liquids is that the setting can be
controlled by normally altering the
water additive volume.
Repair to Concrete Structures
Above Ground.
Waterproofing above ground and
the protection of reinforcement are
important. There are two phases;—
No. 1: Precautionary.
No. 2: Remedial.
The precautionary measures are es'
sentially good design and first'dass
construction.
Good cover for the reinforcement
at all points, and care in construction
to see all bars are welbcovered and

not displaced during concreting.
With regard to remedial measures
the normal faults are spalling of the
concrete off the bars or stirrups. The
primary cause is the entry of water
through the cover concrete to the re-
inforcement, causing rust and expan-
sion of the steel. Following this,
climatic agents take a hand. The re-
suit is local reduction of bar section,
and the effect of this on the stability
of the structure. In all repairs of this
kind, the first essential is the correct
preparation, and the bond to the exist-
ing concrete.

“LEST WE FORGET’’
CORAL SEA NAVAL
COMMEMORATION.
Early in May, Lieutenant General
Bridgeford, former Comander of Brit-
ish Commonwealth Forces in Japan
«md Korea, is reported in the daily
press to have said:
“Australia would not be a free coun-
in 20 years unless the Commun-
ists’ southward push, now started in
Indo-China, was quickly halted by the
free nations.
‘Unless the free nations of the
world are prepared to send forces to
help the French in Indo-China, South-
east Asia is lost,” he said.
“Then the next move will be south-
ward. Unless the people of the world
are aroused to military action, we are
in great peril here.”
“Most people had failed to realise
the grave danger facing Australia.”
As an antidote to the over-emphasis
placed upon “Sport” in Australia,
which, too often, is merely the frame-
work upon which the evils of gambl-
ing by the lookers-on, rather than the
participants of healthy recreation —is
hung, these words should be made to
sink deeply into the minds of the
people while there may yet be time.
It is heartening to know that the
lesson of the Coral Sea Battle, when
U.S.A. and Australia only just turned
the tide which would have engulfed—
just how many countries besides Aus-
tralasia, we can only conjecture.
So far we are not being found un-
faithful to the remembrance of oui
obligation. Australia's deep gratitude
to U.S.A. should never weaken, de-
spite any economic arguments on
trade, and commerce, and other things
that may be raised in future years.
On the 11th Anniversary of the
Coral Sea Battle in 1942, that epic
victory was the occasion of a com'
memoration at the memorial erected
by the Australian-American Associa-
tion in Newstead Park, Brisbane, where
stands the historical Newstead House,
the early seat of Governmental Ad'
ministration, when what is now
Queensland, was a part of New South
Wales. This historic building was oc-
cupied by U.S. forces during World
War II.
The gathering of 2000 people on
Sunday, 3rd May, 1953, which in'
eluded detachments of the Navy,
Army, and Air Force, took part in a
simple, and because of that, impres'
sive service. The Acting Premier, Mr.
J. E. Duggan, in a customary eloquent
speech said:
“The Coral Sea Battle will go down
in history as one of the most decisive
sea battles of the world.” Further,
he said, “The ceremony marked a
kinship between Australia and the
U.S. not only in democratic ideals,
but in a common interest in the
Pacific.” A setting of the 23 rd
psalm was s> i ng by 130 High School
girls.
Said the U.S. Vice'Consul, Mr.
Charles Carson: “This assembly at
the foot of an enduring monument,
is a most demonstration that
you remember the Americans who
‘once passed this way’.”
Included in the assemblage were the
Lord Mayor, Brisbane (Alderman
Frank Roberts), the Naval Com-
mandment (Commander H. S. Ches-
terman). Army Representative (Major
C. H. and Group Captain
G. C. Hart' 1 (R.A.A.F.), while the
flag of A\ ,ralia and the Stars and
Stripes waved overhead.
The Northern Command Army
Band accompanied the Handel Society
while they sang the “Hallelujah
Chorus.”
Dean Taylor pronounced the bless-
ing, and the ceremony concluded with
the singing of God Save the Queen
and the American National Anthem.

Painting Asbestos Cement Sheeting
TYPES OF PAINT AVAILABLE.
Many enquiries have been received
by research organisations as to which
paint will keep its colour and last long'
est when applied externally to Asbestos
cement in Australia.
Like timber, asbestos cement needs
painting periodically, but the frequency
of repainting can be reduced to a min'
imum if care is taken at the beginning
to understand the special requirements
for this material.
Asbestos cement is not an easy ma-
terial to paint for three reasons:
(i) The surface of asbestos cement
is variable in appearance and absorp'
tion. Part of it is whiter in appearance
than the rest and is absorbent and part
is glazed and is not absorbent. These
differences can give a patchy appear'
ance to the surface when painted.
(ii) Asbestos cement is composed
of fiberised asbestos and Portland
cement, and like all cement products
it contains alkalis that will attack
the paint film. The degree of alkalim
ity is variable but it can cause flaking,
cracking and discolouration of the
paint.
(iii) Asbestos cement contains moiV
ture which may assist the alkali to
attack the paint or may cause blister'
ing.
Difficulties in painting asbestos ce'
ment can be largely overcome by em
suring that the surface is reasonably
free of alkali, dry and with the vanV
tion in absorption reduced to a mini'
mum.
The best method of reducing the
risk of attack from alkali is to allow
the sheets to weather for from three
to six months before painting. The
alkalis become carbonated on exposure
to air, and in addition, rain will often
wash them off the surface to some
extent. The surface should be pro'
perly cleaned before painting with a
little water and a brush to remove
any loose or powdery material.
Treating asbestos cement with cheim
icals such as a solution of zinc sub
phate or hydrochloric acid to neutral'
ise the alkalis is not recommended.
The chemicals can only be expected
to act upon the surface and often
leave a powdery deposit which may
interfere with the adhesion of the
paint.
To deal with the variation in ah'
sorption, glazed areas should be rough'
ened with sandpaper and then if the
variation is also so great that it is
unlikely that a good finish will be ob'
tained a sealing coat should be ap'
plied according to the type of paint
it is proposed to use.
Two Types of Paint.
There are two types of paint re*
commended for painting asbestos
cement outdoors in Australia and
both are equally satisfactory. These
are: Cement'powder based paint, and
Resin emulsion paint.
These paints are applied with a
brush direct to the asbestos cement,
unless a sealing coat is required first
to equalise absorption. Both are alk'
aline and therefore unreactive with
the alkali in the asbestos cement.
Cement paints are not suitable in acid
industrial atmospheres.
Both of these paints do naturally
deteriorate with time. Cement paint
develops fine hair cracks and small
pieces break away. Resin emulsion
paint gradually chalks, leaving a sur'
face which, after light brushing, is
ready for repainting.
Oil gloss paint should only be used
where a glossy surface is necessary.

This should be applied over an oil
gloss undercoat to an asbestos cement
surface which has already been coated
with one or two coats of a high
quality cement sealer.
Polyvinyl acetate emulsion paint is
likely to be satisfactory, but no de-
tails of its actual performance in this
country are, as yet, available.
Another of the special requirements
to remember when painting asbestos
cement is that where one side is con-
stantly wetted, such as in a gutter, that
side should be given a protective coat
of bitumen and the asbestos cement
allowed to dry out before paint is ap-
plied to the other side.

A NEW SYSTEM OF
DAMP-PROOFING.
Electro-Osmosis.
A method of damp-proofing, claim-
ed to be more efficient, completely
permanent, less expensive and less
complicated than traditional methods,
has recently been introduced to Brit-
ain by Silicaseal Limited (of West-
gate Hill Grange, Newcastle-upon-
Tyne 4). Known as the Ernst Damp-
proofing System, it is based on a phy-
sical phenomenon known as Electro-
Osmosis. This is the displacement of
water through certain capillary mater-
ials under the influence of an electric
current. Electro-Osmosis has already
been applied for a number of years
in various industries and for the drain-
age of moist soils, but it was not un-
til 1930 that two Swiss, the brothers
Ernst, thought of applying it to the
problem of drying out foundation
walls. With the co-operation of the
Technical High School in Zurich and
the University of Basle the principle
was developed and a satisfactory sys-
tem devised.
The Electro-Osmotic installation
consists of a series of electrodes con-
nected together which are permanent-
ly embedded in the walls, together
with a series of earth conductors which
form the opposite charged conductors.
Accurate electrical measurements are
made to determine the exact places in
which the electrodes and conductors
are to be fixed and a working plan is
prepared on the basis of these details.
The electrodes, consisting of copper
wire in spiral form,. are fixed into
holes which have been drilled into the
walls to a depth of approximately
two-thirds of its thickness, and then
joined together with a copper wire
which is laid in horizontal chases cut
in the surface of the wall. These
chases have a depth of 2in. and a
breadth of An insulated cable is
also used to connect these electrodes
together to ensure even further effi-
ciency. The earth conductors, which
are buried in predetermined positions,
are connected together with an insul-
ated cable which is laid alongside the
copper wire in the chases. Finally,
the connecting leads of the wall elec-
trodes and the earth conductors are
joined in junction boxes which are fit-
ted in easily accessible places. The
holes and chases are then filled up
with cement mortar sothat the orig-
inal solid composition of the wall is
restored. The installation is perman-
ent and an integral nart of the struc-
ture; it will continue to operate
throughout the life of the building
provided it is not disturbed. Advant-
ages claimed for the new system
(which has already been installed in
some buildings in this country) are
impressive. The system not only ar-
rests the upward movement of ground
moisture but drives it back to the
ground water level. It is not neces-
sary to fix the installation below the
floor as with conventional damp-proof
courses, consequently the floors need
not be taken up. The system is pot
only effective downwards but also
sideways, thus eliminating lateral mois-
ture infiltration. The internal drying
of walls can be measured with elec-
trical instruments and a record kept
allowing a synopsis of the moisture
condition of walls at any time. The
installation of the system in new build-
ings, while slightly more expensive
than a normal damp-proof course,
will, it is emphasised, ensure perman-
ent dry conditions throughout the
life of the building.

(Top left) Fireplace, set in large chimney breast of Ashlar stone masonry, is pro-
vided with a hanging netted chain screen for safety against fire. A television set
is seen on the left so that people may enjoy themselves whilst sitting before the
fire. A mantle is not considered necessary as the masonry provides enough interest,
colour and texture. (Top right) Here the mantlepiece provides a resting place for
slender candlesticks and above are playfully placed plaques. Textures in the window
pelmets and settee upholstering maintain a nice contrast with the plan all-over
carpet. (Bottom left) Here again protection of a fire screen assures safety from
falling embers. Note the high up "hearth stone" relieved by vase at one end. A

lightness to the scene. It balances up nicely. (Bottom right) Fireplace without

BRITISH MOVES ON
HOUSING.
Homes Programme Gathers Speed.
The two'bedroom house featured at
the recent “Daily Mail” Ideal Home
Exhibition in London showed a great
saving in cost and materials.
This new People’s House for
<£4soa'year families is a better “mod'
el” than the one shown at Olympia
in 1952, and is considered by the
Ministry of Housing to be the answer
to rising costs and rents.
Peak Housing Production.
The Minister for Housing, Mr.
Harold Macmillan, said recently that
every month of 1953 should bring
Britain closer to peak housing produc'
tion.
He said that the Government could
not solve the accommodation prob'
lems of the homeless in a matter of
weeks, but by building more houses
faster, they would reduce the waiting
time for everybody.
The length of time people would
have to wait depends partly on where
they live, the Minister declared.
More people wanted council houses
in some parts than in others, but the
programme for 1953 is bigger than in
any year since the war, and the speed
of building is increasing. For the
three years before the present Gov'
ernment took office the housing pro'

gramme was limited to 200,000 a year.
Extra Houses.
According to official figures, the
Churchill Government in 1952, its
first year, built 45,000 more houses
than in 1951. This year began with
280.000 houses under construction.
That amounts to an extra 125,000
houses in the first two years of the
Government—extra homes for about
400.000 people.
Right Approach.
Undoubtedly the Churchill Gov'
ernment has the right approach to
the housing problem—an approach
Australian Governments would be
wise to emulate.
This tremendous housing drive has
been shorn of all red'tape, and the
Government realises that the only
way to meet the genuine needs of
the peo’ple is to get the houses up,
and the right kind of houses. Con'
sequently the authorities are building
more two'bedroom houses at present
—designed to meet the requirements
of young couples.
In Britain the local councils alio'
cate the houses, as they are more fam'
iliar with local needs. They do their
job humanly and impartially, and
some councils allocate a percentage
of their new houses to newly'married
couples—s% is not uncommon.
People’s House.
The two'bedroom house featured at
the Daily Mail” Ideal Home Exhibh
saving in cost and building materials.
Thousands of people streamed through
it at Olympia.
The Minister recently gave a fillup
to private enterprise building by mak'
ing the building license automatic
for houses of 1000 sq. ft. or less. The
two'bedroom exhibition home has
been adjudged ideal for a young
couple, and there are also ways in
which the local councils can help
them financially.
Local authorities can advance up to
90% of the cost. Consequently, ah
though the couple would have to get
a plot of land, they can ask the local
council for an advance of all except
the first £l2O on a £l2OO house.
Hundreds of authorities in Britain
make such advances, to encourage and
further the housing drive. Surely a
similar scheme could be evolved and
implemented in Australia?
Private Enterprise.
The Housing Minister intends to em
courage private enterprise building on
a grand scale, not that many restric'
tions have gone and there exists no
severe shortage of materials.
The Churchill Government wisely
realises that a growing private enter'
prise programme is an essential part
of Britain’s housing policy. As they
push the level and speed of building
up the Government may meet with
sporadic shortages of one or two ma'
terials. But the position is being
closely watched and everything pos'
sible is being done to prevent serious
shortages occurring.
The world wishes Great Britain
good luck with her immense housing
programme. If drive and initiative
can turn the trick in the U.K. we feel
it is about time a similar programme
was launched in Australia, such as
this journal has advocated countless
times.
ENGLAND ON TOP.
England’s high altitude flying bet'
tered that hitherto claimed as “the
highest” by America when the Olym'
pus'powered “Canberra” climbed
59,446 feet into the air on a trial
flight. It has since attained heights
of over 60,000 feet.
Come on, America, competition is
wholesome and spells progress in every
direction.

TEMPORARY ANTI-RUST
PREPARATION.
A very useful rust-preventing pre-
paration for machinery, spare parts,
tools, etc., is made as follows:
Dissolve 1 oz. of camphor in 1 lb.
of melted lard. Skim off any scum
that falls, then add as much fine black
lead as needed to give the mixture a
grey colour.
The articles to be protected should
first be cleaned and then smeared with
the mixture. After 24 hours, it is
rubbed off with a soft cloth. The
fine film which still remains fills the
pores of the metal and prevents rust
so long as it is intact.

One of the world’s priceless treas-

lent to London as a Coronation ges-
tore by a decision of Bayeux Town
Council, North-west France.

has been shown in England, although
it is said to have been embroidered by
William the Conqueror’s Queen Ma-
tilda.

Conquest.

people, 202 horses and mules, 55 dogs
and 505 other animals, with num-
bers of buildings, ships and trees.

The little cottage in the lower right example with its simple little pitched root ties and timber
infilled gables looks rather overwhelmed amongst the bevy of "contemporary" houses wilh the ag-
gressive rectangularity and their uncompromising flat roofs. It is a comparison of particular interest
to study the bottom right and top right examples which almost have the same plans yet by diverse
elevational treatments look so different. Both the other two houses are larger and more pretentious,
that in the bottom left being almost a mansion by today's space standards.
