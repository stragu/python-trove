Of several hundred tons of structural steel
which collapsed during the erection of the new
Lake Macquarie Power Station, Wangi, N.S.W.,
a large section fell against the MILLS scaffold-
ing used in the construction of a concrete stack.
The scaffold took the full weight of impact
and, although a section was pushed well out
of alignment, as the illustration shows, the
stability of the scaffold as a whole was not in
the slightest affected.

Fibrock-Asbestos
Cement Sidings
They cost less than weatherboards but they are more
attractive. These are the same type of asbestos cement
sidings that you see advertised in “Progressive
Architecture and other U.S. architectural magazines.
The soft grey color needs no painting.
Also, Fibrock sidings blend beautifully with timber
or brick construction. Each siding measures 2 feet by
one. Nail holes are already there just waiting for the
nails. Require practically no upkeep over a lifetime
of wear.
Fibrock Roofing
Why worry about the tile shortage? This is a roofing
that is really beautiful in its own right. The soft grey
natural color of the corrugated sheets is much easier on
the eyes than the hard-looking “red” of ordinary tiles.
If you wish, these sheets can be painted also. Fibrock
Corrugated Roofing is completely fireproof, and will
outlast any tile or metal roof.
Fibrock Flat Sheets
Do you know that asbestos cement flat " '
sheets are included amongst the big
range of C.S.R. Building Materials?
This is a stronger sheet than any
other type of flat asbestos cement
sheet because it is made from blue
asbestos fibre (much stronger than
white) from C.S.R.’s own asbestos
mine.

A FINE ADDITION TO SYDNEY S PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
Built at a cost of £500,000 over a period of some six years, which covered some of the most
difficult ever experienced in Australia in respect of labour and material shortage, the new
Headquarters of the Maritime Services Board of N.S.W. at Circular Quay is an important
addition to the public buildings of Sydney. Its site, on the western side of Circular Quay, is
an historic one, and it has witnessed most of the important events of Sydney since the landing
in 1783. Part of the site for many years was occupied by the old Commissariat Store.

THE MARITIME SERVICES BOARD BUILDING
IMPOSING NEW HEADQUARTERS
AT CIRCULAR QUAY, SYDNEY.
OFFICIALLY OPENED. DECEMBER 10, 1952.
The official opening by the Premier
of N.S.W., the Hon. J. J. Cahill, on
December 10th, 1952, before a repre'
sentative gathering of over four hum
dred people, of the imposing new
Headquarters of the Maritime Services
Board at Circular Quay, Sydney,
brought to fruition one of the major
changes that have occurred for many
years in this historic area.
Time Schedule Dislocated.
The construction of the new build'
ing was mandatory in the consumma'
tion of the Quay Railway Scheme, for
the railway will run straight through
the centre of the Board’s old building.
A time schedule was worked out and in
order that the Board could move from
its old building into the new and thus
allow for the demolition of the former,
a start was made on the new head'
quarters in September, 1946. Condi'
tions in the Building Industry were
extremely difficult for the next five
years and as the result of labour and
material shortages the completion of
the building took a great deal longer
than had been anticipated. Had the
same virus not affected the construction
of the railway itself, this factor would
have caused dislocation in the schedule,
but progress in this respect was pos'
sibly even slower, till even tO'day with
the building completed and occupied
the tragic Quay Railway is once again
“resting” for the umpteenth time in
its chequered career since the Eastern
Tunnel entrance emerged in 1918 —
which date was proudly, if inadvisedly
as events have transpired—emblazoned
upon it.
Quite apart, however, from the
exigencies of the Quay Railway, the
Board needed larger premises, for the
’existing structure, built to house the
activities of the Board when it was
constituted in 1900, had become em
tirely inadequate and outmoded for
this important Authority which con'
trols the great Port of Sydney.
The change'over of the multifarious
activities of the Board was a major
task in itself, but by careful planning
was expeditiously executed over a
weekend and the Board opened for
business in its new headquarters on
Monday, December 15th, 1952.
The new building occupies a splem
did site bounded by Circular Quay
West, George Street North, Barton
Street and Argyle Street, and when
the surrounding area is laid out with
lawns and gardens as planned it will
indeed be one of Sydney’s outstand'
ing public buildings.
The Main Entrance.
The building has three entrances.
The main entrance, centrally placed in
the frontage facing historic Sydney
Cove, is approached from Circular
Quay West, whilst that to the Wharf'
age Hall, on the southern side, opens
on to the present Barton St. frontage.
Entry to the western side of the build'
inc is gained from George Street
North at a slightly higher level.
Viewed from the roadway in front
of the main entrance, the easterly
aspect gives a stately impression re'
suiting from the length of its impos'
ing facade, with the central portion
rising in bold outline above the height
of the northern and southern wings.
The building is faced on all sides with
sandstone of a deep warm sienna
colour, upon a rusticated base of
polished Rob Roy granite. Adorning
the face of the centra] tower and
overlooking the waters of Sydney Cove
is a clock, with its aluminium chapters
and hands clearly outlined in black
against the light shade of the stone'
work for all ferry travellers to see.
Cut in the stone in relief below the
clock are three symbols—a ship’s pro'
peller, wheel and anchor —signifying
respectively the driving force, the
guiding force, and stability of the
Board.
The main entrance is approached
by means of a terrace, tiled in reddish'
brown to tone with the granite base.
Twin flights of broad steps, giving
access from either end, lead on to the
terrace, whilst space in the dwarf wall
has been provided for the cultivation
of garden flowers and trailing plants,
which will lend contrast and softness
to the granite. Above the entrance is
a panel by sculptor Lyndon Dadswell,
incorporating a group of figures carved
in bold relief to convey an impression
of waterfront activity in the transit of
goods by sea, and typically symbolic
of the commercial life of a great port.
An Imposing Vestibule.
Large bronze doors, sliding into re'
cesses, give entry to the outer ves'
tibule, which is separated from the
main vestibule by a glass and alu'
minium screen. Doors in the centre
section of the screen give access to
THE OLD BUILDING.

the main vestibule, where the eye is
immediately attracted by the stately
columns surfaced in shades of red
scagliola, the highly' polished walls
lined with Wombeyan marble and the
aluminium balcony railing and satin-
finished lift doors and surrounds.
Two modern, fully-automatic lifts
are installed and each car, with a
speed rated at 300 feet per minute,
has walls lined with polished maple
and a coved ceiling of spun aluminium,
and is illuminated by fluorescent light-
ing.
Unioue War Memorial
and Mural.
Upon the vestibule’s southern wall,
covering an area 16ft. long and 14ft.
high, Lyndon Dadswell has created a
unique war memorial, in abstract form,
to those members of the Board’s staff
who served in both world wars. It
takes the form of a map in outline
constructed of one inch diameter alu-
minium rods and indicates the areas
ih which Australian Forces operated.
(See detailed description in separate
article describing this and other ex-
amples of applied art in the building.)
A large mural by veteran artist
Norman Carter occupies the right wall
of the vestibule, adjacent to the In-
quiry Office, and presents a “bird’s
eye’’ perspectiive view of the commer-
cial section of the Harbour shown in
relation to the City. This work in
striking fashion gives an attractive and
informative picture of the main wharf-
age along the southern shore of the
Port from the Captain Cook Graving
Dock to Glebe Island.
The warm cream and biscuit tones
of the Wombeyan marble squares lin-
ing the walls of the vestibule with the

On the mezzanine floor, offices are
located on both sides of a corridor to
the left, which is finished in tiles of a
rich cream shade, while on the right
a doorway gives access to the balcony
overlooking the Wharfage Hall, where
staff accommodation is also provided.
H ere, the paving will form a circular
pattern with the path which will also
lead to the more elevated George
Street North level. The whole of the
area extending south from the build-
ing to the site of the adjacent over-
head section of the railway line, which,
on completion, will link Wynyard and
St. James Stations via the Circular
Quay Station, will ultimately be laid
out in lawns interspersed with garden
plots and decorative trees.
Upon final completion of the sur-
rounding setting, the Wharfage Hall
will be approached over a wide path-
way leading to a short flight of steps.

swing doors, the spaciousness and re-
strained treatment of this fine interior
is at once apparent. The counter.
sweeping in an unbroken line from
the western to the eastern wing, is of
polished maple surfaced with rubber
inlay, and has been designed to con-
form with the shape of the building,
curving gracefully for each change in
direction, emphasised in the form of
an aluminium band running its full
length.
The tall, stately columns, 24ft. high,
treated in green scagliola, form a pleas-
ing contrast with the lighter shades of
green scagliola tiles on the walls.
Upon the floor, which is died in
scagliola terrazzo, in a position near
the entrance door and at the intersec-
tion of the building’s axial lines, the
points of the compass have been inset
in contrasting colours to lend added
flavour to the building’s nautical as-
sociations. Another maritime touch
may be seen in the balcony of the
mezzanine floor, where the horizontal
members of its aluminium railing are
fashioned to form a pattern of waves.
Historical Mural.
The face of the balcony, which, on
entering; the Hall is observed directly
in front, is decorated with a ribbon'
shaoed mural depicting the historical
background to the growth of maritime
activity on the coast of New South
Wales from the earliest colonial days
to the present era of modern pas'
senger liners. This work comes from
the brush of the noted muralist, R.
Emerson Curtis.
Heating of the Wharfage Hall
when required will be achieved by a
warm air circulation system utilising
four electric heating units, each out'
let being screened with an aluminium
sfrill, decorated with an appropriate
marine motif in the form of sea
horses. Artificial lighting is of the
fluorescent type, directed from fittings
located on the ceiling. Over that area
used by the public these fittings are
3ft. 6in. in diameter, covered by
dished perspex diffusers which are ser'
viced by access from above. The
large, tall windows permit of a gene'
rous stream of natural light, and their
appearance is enhanced by the fitting
of Venetian blinds with slats of cream'
lacquered aluminium.
Port of Sydney Relief Map.
Leaving the main vestibule and
reaching the first floor a relief
map of the Port of Sydney, covered
by plate glass in a polished maple and
aluminium frame, appears directly op'
posite the lifts. Illuminated by con'
cealed lighting, this coloured map,
which covers the commercial section
of the Port, is set out in true contour
both in regard to the embraced land
areas and also the bed of the Port.
Without embodying intensive detail it
illustrates all the principal streets in
their relationship to the wharves; in-
eludes a general idea of the proposed
remodelling of the Darling Harbour
wharfage and shows the positions of
the various navigation beacons within
the area and consequently is of great
value to visitors desiring to grasp the
ramifications of Sydney Harbour and
to the Board in explaining its de'
velopmental programme.
President’s Suite
and Board Room.
The Commissioners’ suites, located
in the northern end of the building,
have parquet floors of sanded tallow'
wood and walls panelled to door
height in a variety of beautifully
grained Australian veneers. Rose butt
maple has been used in the President’s
room, silky oak in those of the Vice'
President and Commissioner and, in
the Secretary’s office, Queensland map
Concealed border lighting, in addition
to the normal fluorescent type, is pro'
vided in the ceiling of each room,
completing an atmosphere of dignity
and comfort.
DIGNITY AND SPACIOUSNESS.
There is a fine feeling of spaciousness in the Wharfage Hall, which is the most imposing part
of the building.
THE BOARD ROOM.
The walls of which are panelled with rose butt veneer relieved by lighter decorative bands of

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


The spacious Board Room is panel'
led to ceiling height with attractive
rose butt veneer, relieved by lighter
toned decorative bands of inlaid celery
top pine and, with its great central
table, gives a feeling of impressive
dignity.
Other offices of the Administrative
Branch are located off the main cor'
ridor as it continues past the lifts to
the southern portion of the building.
The Accounts and Legal Branches
are accommodated on the second floor,
while the entire space of the third
floor is devoted to the various sections
of the Engineering Branch.
The Design Office.
The Design Office, which utilises
the whole of the northern wing, has
been planned to provide for a maxi'
mum of natural light, supplemented
by indirect artificial lighting, if re'
quired, over the drafting tables.
Modern drafting tables allow ample
space not only for current work but
for ready access to reference drawings
on one side and calculation pads on
the other. Bookcases with plateglass
sliding doors are built into the front
and rear of each table. The equip'
ment includes a complete and readily
accessible filling system housed in
steel cabinets.
On the same floor, to the south of
the elevators, is the Preservation and
Research Section, comprising a gene'
ral laboratory, appliance room, offices,
store room, etc. Hitherto, the whole
of the work associated with this branch
of the Board’s service was performed
in premises at Fort Macquarie, and
while certain operations on a larger
scale, such as impregnation of timbfers,
paint formulation, etc., are still car'
ried on at this site, a great amount of
the research work required in connec'
tion with the Board’s activities is now
undertaken in the new quarters.
The Laboratory.
Designed and equipped throughout
in keeping with modern trends, the
Laboratory is provided with a fume
exhaust, while the Appliance Room is
designed to protect, as far as possible,
the precision chemical appliances from
the effects of vibration and draughts.
In the absence of coal gas supply,
“Blue Ray” gas is utilised to provide
flame heating. Electric heating is
achieved by thermostatically controlled
hot plates and an oven.
Survey Branch, plan printing and
photographic dark rooms are on the
fourth floor.
Conference Hall.
The Conference Hall on this floor,
which is 75ft.'by 43ft., has a floor of
parquet tallow-wood and wide metal
doors on the sides giving access to the
flat roof of the wings of the building.
On portion of the southern wall, ad'
jacent to the entrance door, a plat'
form and screen will be provided to
enable a 16 m.m. cinematograph pro'
jector and a 35 m.m. still projector to
be operated when required. A servery
is available for the provision of light
refreshments.
On this floor also a tide recorder,
officially known as an automatic elec'
trical water level recorder, will ulti-
mately be installed in the Survey In-
snector’s room. This apparatus will
indicate tidal heights as a curve in
graph form and will be actuated by
electrical impulses received from the
transmitter connected with a tide
gauge located over a well installed at
No. 8 Ferry Jetty, Circular Quay.
The Cafeteria.
A modern cafeteria for the Board s
staff is situated at the northern end of
the ground floor of the building.
Capable of seating 176 persons, it has
been tastefully furnished with attrac'
rive duralium tables, surfaced in blue
laminex. with the chairs finished with
a fabricoid of royal blue. Its floor is
of parquet tallow'wood, and entry may
be gained either by the corridor lead'
in? from the main vestibule or through
the doorway at the northern end.
Self'service facilities include a stainless

stainless steel, and roller shutters can
close the kitchen from the cafeteria as
desired.
Heating and Hot Water.
Heating of the building, with the
exception of the Wharfage Hall
■and the Board Room, is achieved by
means of the circulation of hot water
over radiation panels set flush with the
ceilings. An off-peak system of heat-
ing is used emnloying two cylinders
of 4800-gallon capacity in which the
water is stored at about 290 degrees
Fahrenheit and delivered at approxi-
mately 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Each
cylinder, constructed of half-inch steel
plate, is heated by fifty-one 4 kW.
elements, and sections of the building
may be heated, according to choice,
independently of the others. Hot
water for the hand-basins is provided
by means of a separate off-peak unit
of 1000-gallon capacity.
The building is equipped with an
automatic telephone service in which
the Head Office, Workshops and other
outside sections are all on a common
system, making it possible to dial
direct from one to the other. A con-
tinuous all-hours service is available
to the public, enabling information re-
lating to shipping to be furnished at
all times and to facilitate the engage-
ment of various services by shipping
companies, stevedores and others.
There are 250 telephones connected
to the service. A system of elec-
tric fire-alarms is installed throughout
the premises.
After a period of fifty years the
Port Authority of New South Wales
is now fittingly accommodated for the
important role which it plays in the
development of the State and the
Commonwealth.
The building cost approximately
£500,000 and was designed by the
Supervising Architect, Mr. D. H.
Baxter and his predecessor( who re-
tired in 1947), Mr. W. H. Withers,
both of whom deserve the highest
credit in planning and designing a
building to efficiently house the mul-
tifarious activities of the Board and
to bring it to successful completion
during the most difficult conditions
that the Building Industry has ever
known. Similar credit must be ex-

Applied Art in the New Maritime
Services Building
SCULPTURE AND MURALS.
A feature of the new Maritime
Services Board building at Circular
Quay is the excellent manner in
which the work of three welhknown
Australian artists has been utilised to
enhance this fine structure. The first
to be seen is the sculptured bas'
relief panel over the main entrance.
This is a symbolic work by Lyndon
Dadswell, who is in charge of the
Sculpture School at the East Sydney
Technical College.
This strongly'executed work, which
has a nice touch of historical feeling,
indicates an emblematic presentation
of the complete meaning of a port in
its association with the carriage of
poods by sea. The sculptor has con'
veyed by the incidentals of his theme
the idea of a haven of rest and safety
for ships after long and dangerous
voyages . The foreground treatment
symbolises harbour activity in the
handling of commerce, giving a strong
impression of the dignity of honest
labour in its vital role in the building
of a new nation by the trade through
the gateways of its ports. In the
background is the fine old Commis-
sariat Building that used to occupy
this very site for so many years.
Unique War Memorial.
Mr. Dadswell was also entrusted
with the design of a war memorial to
those members of the Board staff who
served in the two World Wars and
which occupies one complete wall of
the Main Entrance Vestibule.
Mr. Dadswell felt that the spirit of
sacrifice called for expression in a
broader and higher sense than the
mere exposition of the names of in'
dividuals. He therefore designed a
map covering those areas of the globe
within which Australian Forces were
involved during the two World Wars,
which in its formalised treatment is
intended to tell a simple story without

the distraction of extraneous detail.
This map, which is in outline only, is
formed with one inch diameter alu-
minium rod with the dull glow of a
satin finish and projects three inches
from the surface of the wall by attach-
ment with unseen pins, giving a float-
ing effect in emphasis of the general
abstract idea. The purpose of detach-
ment from the wall is also for the
creation of a natural shadow outline
to convey in significance the two con-
flicts.
Painted upon the wall itself within
the map’s boundaries, in a reddish-
brown tone conforming to the colour
scheme of the vestibule is seen
a smaller abstract shape extending
from Norway to the South Pacific,
outlining more concisely the combat
areas of the Australian Services.
In his designs for the fabrication of
this symbolic work, Mr. Dadswell
divided a plan of the complete map
area into numerous small sections,
each of which are set out to full scale
showing the exact shapes for guidance
in the bending of the rods.
The design may be said to emanate
from an emotional desire to convey
with simple feeling the sacrifices of
those who served and a unique and
original work has resulted.
The Port Mural.
On the right wall of the vestibule,
and at a height convenient for close
inspection, is a colourful mural, twelve
feet long and five feet six inches high,
presenting a “bird’s eye” or aerial per'
spective view of the commercial sec'
tion of the Port. With the Harbour
Bridge leading in from the left fore-
ground, it embraces all that area of
the southern shores extending from
the Captain Cook Graving Dock to
Glebe Island.
This difficult and meticulous work
has been successfully executed by the
well-known veteran Sydney artist Mr.
Norman Carter.
A work of this kind, apart from the
essential requirement of high artistic
merit, can only be conscientiously
executed after painstaking observation,
research, and reference to innumer-
able photographs. Intensive applica-
tion to these features is imperative as
it is intended that, in conjunction with
its aesthetic value and attraction as a
decorative panel of outstanding
quality, the mural will also conform
to the utilitarian advantages of the
subject. Situated as it is near the
Inquiry Office, it affords practical map-
like details in correct perspective as
a realistic picture of the principal
wharfage of the port, prominent
buildings and other features of the
city.
Historical Port Mural.
The fourth artistic contribution is
the extensive mural on the balustrade
to the mezzanine floor at the end of
the great Wharfage Hall.
This was a most difficult task by
virtue of its location and dimensions

—a ribbon 40ft. long and 3ft. i6n.
high—but it occupies a most impor-
tant position, for on entering the Hall
it is directly in front of one’s gaze.
This work was entrusted to Mr. R.
Emerson Curtis, who is well-equip-
ped by experience to undertake this
difficult assignment.
This mural has a smooth, horizontal
flow undisturbed by any predominant
vertical lines. The subject is basically
historical mingled with a strong theme
of maritime development.
Envisaged necessarily from a low
oblique angle because of the narrow-
field, the coastline, which occupies the
central section of the mural, is, in
contrast to the general delicate green
tones of the Hall, of a reddish-
brown colour. Within the open-
ing of Botany Bay rides Captain
Cook’s ship “Endeavour,” and beyond
the raised cliffs of the headlands of
Port Jackson the “Sirius” and “Sup-
ply” are seen in full sail. Down the
coast the miniature “Tom Thumb” of
Bass and Flinders ventures on its
heroic way, whilst in serried array to-
wards a final fade-out in the south
appear many of those sailing ships
whose names are significant in the
history of New South Wales. There
are the “Dunbar,” the whaling ships,
the wool clippers, and many others,
each vessel in itself meticulously drawn
with authentic detail and presenting a
concourse leading to the “Sophia
Jane” and R.M.S. “Orient,” which
appear as the first ships with an
element of steam propulsion.
Above Port Jackson to the north is
illustrated, with the same clever inten-
sity of detail, the evolution of steam
navigation. Here are the freighters,
colliers, oil tankers and an aircraft
carrier, and so on to the huge “Queen
Mary” and the tiny Pilot Steamer
“Captain Cook.”
Towards the right and left boun-
daries of the design the coastline
fades, and on the extreme sides, with
the suggestion of a scroll return, are
the vividly -executed representation of
typical outports with their wharves
and breakwaters.
The Board are indeed to be con-
gratulated in incorporating in their
new Headsuarters these fine examples
of Australian Art.

Annual Report for 1951-52.
On June 2nd, 1952, The Corpora'
tion of the City of Adelaide cele-
brated the anniversary of a hundred
years of continuous functioning, and a
dinner attended by the Governor, Sir
Willoughby Norrie, was held to mark
the event.
This fact is recorded in the Annual
Report for 1951-52 just to hand.
Another highlight of the civic year
was the visit of the Lord Mayor of
London, Sir Denys Lowson, and Lady
Lowson, who were tendered a Civic
Reception at the Town Hall by the

New factories were being built for
A. J. Swaine 6? Co, Ltd., Dunlite
Electrical Co. Ltd., Wise Engine Ser-
vice Ltd., and Kallin Motor Co. Ltd.
The new Geology Building at the
University of Adelaide was completed,
also the students’ quarters at St.
Mark's College and the nurses’ quar-
ters for The Little Company of Mary
(S.A.) Inc.
Listed under the heading of “Major
Projects not yet Commenced’’ were
the following:—Parsons & Robertson
Ltd. (office and warehouse additions),
Hubert G. Jennings (factory addi-
tions). John Farmer Ltd. (factory).
Greater Union Theatres Pty. Ltd.
(theatre alterations), G. A. Habib
(factory), C. Li asc os (factory).
Freighters Ltd. (workshop), J. R.
Treeonning (workshop addition).
fEd.: Doubtless these building pro-
jects have more than doubled them-
selves in the last six months, since the
curb upon inflation has given con'
fidence to investors all over Australia,
and all overseas, too. For the last 40
years Adelaide has been most attrac'
tive to manufacturers as their workers
have not been nearly as obstructive to
progress as they have been in the
Eastern States. If it continues this
way. South Australia, before long,
should attract much available invest'
ment money, hundreds of millions of
which will pour in from overseas.
“We will work harder, longer, better”
should be the slogan of the workers
there, which would put South Aus'
tralia “on top of the world, in which
the workers themselves would be the
greatest beneficiaries.]

FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP
IN MARITIME BUILDING.
Melocco Bros. Pty. Ltd.
A feature of the Maritime Services
Board building reviewed in this issue
is fine marble, scagliola and terrazzo
work executed by the well-known firm
of Melocco Bros. Pty. Ltd., which has
pioneered and specialised in this work
for so many years. In the main
Wharfage Hall the walls are covered
with scagliola tiles and the columns
with scagliola cast in situ; the fronts
to the sweeping counters are of similar
finish, while the floor is of scagliola
terrazzo —alternate squares being pre-
cast and the remainder cast on the
job, thus eliminating the necessity for
brass strips. The decorative design on
the floor, featuring the points of the
compass, is in similar terrazzo but em'
ploying brass strip-work to bring out
the design.
In the main vestibule the walls are
sheathed with Wombeyan marble in
squares of alternate light and dark
tonings and with a skirting of Mudgee
green. Main stairs up to the second
floor are in scagliola terrazzo.

New University Dental School
and Dental Hospital
IMPORTANT MELBOURNE PROJECT.
Preliminary works have commenced
at the Haymarket site, Melbourne, for
the new ’’University Dental School
and Dental Hospital” which is destined
to become the major dental institute
for the State of Victoria.
Special facilities will be provided
for the extensive training of dental
students, for post-graduate teaching,
and for research activities, which will
absorb about two-thirds of the new
building capacity. The Dental and
Oral Hospital—which will occupy the
balance of the space—will also be en-
gaged upon more than routine den-
tistry.
Most of the high brick walls which
enclosed this historical area have now
disappeared, and a tender from Hol-
loway Bros. (London) was recently
accepted for the preliminary building
operations.
The architectural character of the
new building has been influenced—to
a degree—by the taller Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital, which will form an
appropriate background for the dental
structure. The new building will com-
prise four or five storeys only for its
major wings.
In the Basement of the new struc-
ture there will be malocclusion, perio-
dontia and other surgeries, as well as
students’ locker and rest-rooms. The
caretaker’s quarters will be located
where the floor level rises above the
ground line.
On the Ground Floor, examination
rooms are planned, with administrative
offices and board rooms. Exodontia
and oral surgeries are located on the
main eastern wing, together with X-
ray suites. The western wing con-
tains prosthetic surgeries and labora-
tories. At the extreme western end
provision is made for the .main theatre,
which is planned in conical form with
a spacious foyer.
On the First Floor—in the southern
wing—a demonstration theatre for
students is provided, as well as labora-
tories for senior and junior prosthetic
training. The lofty conservative den-
tal surgery—to be one of the largest
in the world—occupies the entire
eastern wing on this floor, with the
southern natural lighting windows ex-
tending upwards to the equivalent of
two storeys in height.
On the Second Floor, three recovery
wards are provided in the southern
wing, as well as a post-graduate sur-
eery. In the western wing an opera-
tive technique section has been plan-
ned, as well as a centre for histology
and pathology.
A central lecture hall is also pro-
vided on this floor. Two additional
lecture theatres are planned at the end
of the western wing, where the central
sterilising room and another theatre
are located.
On the Third Floor research labora-
tories, conference rooms, as well as
nurses’ and staff rooms are planned,
with another central lecture theatre.
The upper floors in the central section
will contain staff dining-rooms and
residential suites for the matron and
sisters.
The building will be constructed in
reinforced concrete, faced with light
cream brick external walls.
Approximately ten years have been
devoted to progressive planning by
the architects, following extensive re-
search by Professor A. Amies and his
associates who co-operated closely in
the planning.
The preliminary plan and design of
the structure was prepared by Mr.
Percy Everett, F.R.A.1.A., Govern-
ment Architect for Victoria; while the
contract plans, details and specifications
were prepared by the office of Mr.
Frank Heath, A.R.1.8.A., F.R.A.I.A.
Preliminary works have commenced at the Haymarket site, Melbourne, for the new Dental School and Hospital.

Prestressed Concrete in Hangar Construction
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS AT LONDON AIRPORT.
An article by A. J. Harris in the
‘’Structural Engineer describes the
design of hangars at London Airport
in which prestressed concrete was ex-
tensively used.
The contract comprised two parallel
rows of five hangars with their rear
walls separated by two rows of work-
shops and a central access road. Each
row of hangars has a total length of
900 ft., or 180 ft. for each hangar, the
full interior length being unobstruct-
ed and permitting the free movement
of gantry cranes spanning the full
110 ft. depth.
The original plan called for two
5 sft. gantry cranes with a central
track girder supported by the trans-
verse, 110 ft. span, secondary roof gir-
ders. This plan influenced the design
of thse secondary girders and the pre-
liminary work was already well ad-
vanced when their design was changed.
The most interesting structural
features are the five main portal gir-
ders of 150 ft. span, one for each
bangar. The 30ft. intermediate walls
between each portal house the opened
doors.
It was desired to have each hangar
completed as an independent unit,
thus eliminating continuous girder
construction. Moreover, rigid frame
construction covering the required face
dimensions would have been too stiff
to take temperature stresses. A sample
girder design also lent itself more
readily to prestressing.
These main girders carried their
own dead load and that of half the
roof, wind loads and also the crane
track loads. The latter were neces-
sarily eccentric, thus adding torsional
stresses to the normal end shears. As
the rear wall was of non-rigid con-
struction the full horizontal wind load
was also carried by the main beams.
The latter were hollow concrete
beams 14ft. deep and sft. 3in. wide.
Normal thicknesses were 4in. walls
(except near the ends), soffit
slab and Sin. top slab. The thin bot-
tom slab and corner fillets provided
room for 41 Freyssinet cables of 12
x o.2in. type.
The beams were cast in place after
precast transverse diaphragms had
been located at 15ft. intervals. These
diaphragms had triangular openings in
the webs and projected inward to pro-
vide brackets for the crane tracks and
outwards to support a canopy over the
sliding doors. The diaphragms also
marked points for bending the cables
upward into the webs after being pro-
gressively turned outwards in the sof-
fit slab.
The main girders bear on fixed piers
at one end where they project a short
distance to receive the anchorage
cones. At the other end are rocker
piers and the beams cantilever 15ft.
to another set of anchor cones. The
intermediate space of 12ft. 6in. was
subsequently filled in with normal re-
inforced concrete cantilever construc-
tion bonded in by the projecting cable
wire ends near the fixed pier bearings.
The secondarv beams carrying the
roof were of precast segments of T-
section with 4in. web and flange, each
segment carrying triangular web stif-
feners on either side. These units
were assembled on false work and re-
inforced by Freyssinet cables.
These secondary beams support pre-
cast concrete purlins and also triangU'
lar beams carrying the roof lanterns
which cover about half the roof area.
Rooting is lightweight aluminium
channels with a fibre-board and bitU'
minous felt finish. The secondary
beams bear on top of the main beams
at the diaphragms previously mention'
ed. Their ends are hidden by a para-
pet wall and formed gutter added
afterwards.
WHAT OVERHAULING THE
“QUEEN MARY” MEANS.
In the recent annual overhaul of
the 81,000-ton British Atlantic liner
“Queen Mary” two thousand work'
men went over every inch of her hull
and superstructure and every bit of
her machinery and equipment.
Beneath her waterline the “Queen
Mary" was given an application of
seven tons of special anti-corrosive
and anti-fouling paint.
On to the superstructure, funnels
and masts went another ton of paint.
Electricians overhauled the entire
electrical installation which is suffi-
cient to provide light for a town of
30,000 people.
The ship’s 600 telephones and 700
clocks were tested.
The 180 ' ton electric - hydraulic
steering gear was examined and test'
ed, along with every other piece of
equipment.
The four 32'ton propellers were
removed for overhaul and the 140'ton
rudder inspected internally.
Each two hundredweight link of
the 330 fathoms of anchor cable was
scaled and painted.
The complete job took just over a
month.

OPEX WEB JOISTS
NOW AVAILABLE IN AUSTRALIA.
By D. DALGLEISH, A.M.I.E.Aust.
[An Australian company now sup-
plies the long-awaited open web joists
under licence to the Canadian firm of
Dominion Structural Steel.}
Most architects have at some time
or other viewed with envy the ad-
vertisements or articles in overseas
journals illustrating open web .joist
construction used for supporting up-
per floors or for roof construction.
Open web joists were first put on the
market in U.S.A. in 1923, being form-
ed as a Warren truss, using electric
arc welding for joining the members.
It was with considerable pride that
th e Standard Steel Company an-
nounced their intention to manufac-
ture these joists in Australia un-
der licence to Dominion Structural
Steel Limited of Canada. The com-
pany has now tooled-up to produce
open web joists in large quantities,
and as the Standard Steel Company
are the sole manufacturers of “Clear-
span Arch and Portal Frame Build-
ings they are in a very good position
to manufacture open web joists at
highly competitive prices.
Apart from their other advantages,
Clearspan joists are favoured be-
cause of lightness in handling and
speed of erection. The ends of the
joists are reduced to in depth
so that they may be easily bedded in
between courses of brickwork. As
this point of support is above the
centre of gravity of the beam, they
may be placed in position and imme-
diately walked on without fear of
overturning. (See Figure I.)
After joists are fixed in position a
simple bridging member is fixed to
the underside of the top chord and
tied at the ends, or to adjoining walls.
This leaves the joist ready for loading
and fixing of floor materials, whether
in timber or concrete. Electrical or
plumbing services may then be run
through the web area without expen-
sive cutting in or complicated pipe
bends.
Clearspan joists have a most use-
ful application for the construction of
mezzanine floors in factory-type build-
ines where the headroom is over 20ft.
(See Figure 2.) For example, in a
building between 40ft. and 50ft. wide,
a centre row of columns spaced at
20ft. centres are placed along the
centre line of the building to support
a main beam. “Clearspan” joists 20ft.
to 2 sft. span are then laid across the
building from centre beam to side
walls, such joists being capable of
carrying loads up to 100 lb. per square
foot. Where greater loads or spans
are required, “Longspan” joists may
be used effectively.
Amongst the various types of floor
decking used, timber and concrete are
the most popular. For timber floor-
ing a 2m. x 2in. nailing strip is bolt-
ed to the top chords of the joists and
the flooring fixed in a normal manner.
For concrete floors a 6m. x 6in. light
wire mesh is laid over the joists to
support hessian-backed building paper.
Above this is laid steel mesh reinforce-
ment suitably supported above the
formwork and tied down. Normal
concrete may then be placed over the
area, laying planks across the joists
for wheel-barrow traffic. Experience
indicates that normal foot traffic may
take place over the mesh away from
the planks without harmful effect.
Other methods of decking can be
formed with pre-cast pre-stressed con-
crete slabs, or by placing concrete on
to expanded metal lathing incorporat-
ing reinforcing ribs. It may be readily
appreciated that placing of concrete
slab floors in this manner is lower in
cost than the normal method of con-
struction with timber formwork.

“Clearspan" Open Web Joists will
be welcomed for use as upper floor
joists in two'Storey domestic construe'
tion, for the joists can be delivered
to the site in exact lengths, ready for
immediate building into the brick'
work. They may also be used for
roof construction in skillion'type build'
ings, being ideal for this type of work.
An interesting form of sawtooth
roof construction was recently com'
menced where 30in. deep longspan
joists were used across the brick side
walls of a 40ft. wide factory, being
spaced at 20ft. centres along the build'
ing. 20ft. long open web joists were
then placed parallel to the side walls
and spanning from the top of one
longspan to the lower chord of the
next. This provides a low'pitch saw'
tooth roof construction with a glass
area 30in. deep at 20ft. intervals, the
light area in this case being 12% of
floor area and the cost less than nor'
mal steel roof truss construction.
Standard Steel Co. Pty. Ltd. have
recently established a Technical Sales
Division in Sydney at 310 George
Street. Telephone BU 2342 and 2237.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND
IN CYPRUS.
Shrine 2600 Years Old.
An ancient sanctuary of a cult which
thrived 2600 years ago has been laid
bare by archaeological excavation near
Meniko, 16 miles west of Nicosia,
Cyprus. Accidentally discovered by a
Cypriot farmer clearing his field of
stones, the shrine is full of statuettes,
consecrated terra'cotta objects, incense
burners, and other relics.
Most important find is said to be
a terra'cotta figure of the deity won
shipped by the ancient cult; it is a
small male figure, bearded and with
horns, seated on a throne.

DIMMING OF FLUORESCENT
LAMPS NOW POSSIBLE.
Increased Versatility Claimed.
By means of the new light control
system developed by General Electric
lighting engineers at Nela Park, in
Cleveland, U.S.A., the brightness of
fluorescent lamps now can be con'
trolled merely with the turn of a knob,
just as smoothly and easily as incan'
descent lamps have been dimmed or
brightened in the past.
It is claimed that this new system,
not yet in production, greatly in'
creased the flexibility of fluorescent
lamps and the range of uses to which
they may be put.
The new control system will be
available for use with either the con'
ventional 40watt pre'heat type of
lamp, or with the new 40watt “Rapid
Start’’ fluorescent lamps. Two sizes of
controls will be made, one operating
up to eight lamps, and the other up to
3 5 lamps.
Although the light control system
will be used effectively in general
lighting applications, it is expected to
be especially in demand to create
special lighting effects, particularly
with coloured fluorescent lamps.
Engineers explain that although
coloured fluorescents are much more
efficient than filament lamps, their use
in the past has been limited, because
their brightness could not be regulated
effectively. Fluorescent lamps produce
more than three times the white light,
and up to 25 times the amount of
coloured light provided by incandes-
cent lamps of the same wattage.
The engineers expect the dimming
feature to find favour in such a variety
of places as theatres, auditoriums,
schools, display rooms ,stores, hotels,
nightclubs, restaurants, television
studios, shop windows, signs, etc.

A CATHEDRAL, A BRIDGE,
AND A SONG.
Man reared a cathedral —
From vaulted depths the towers rise
and soar
In pinnacles and spires that pierce the
blue.
That men may glimpse, in Gothic
tracery.
The lift of angel wings upraised in
prayer,
A prayer ascending to the infinite —
—To reach the stars.
Man built a bridge—
From caissons deep below the swirling
tides,
Majestic pylons interlaced with light
Rise proudly upward to the azure vault
To hold a harp outstretched against
the sky,
A poet’s dream against the sunset
gold—
—To reach the stars,
Man made a song— ■
From deep within the hungry hearts
of men
The song calls forth the longing and
the dream
And swells the music of the star'filled
skies
With raptured notes of Nature’s
symphony.
Hearts soar aloft on wings of melody—
—To reach the stars.

CHICAGO CIVIC CENTRE
HUGE DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECT.
To Cost 50,000,000 Dollars.
The word Chicago has come to
stand for many things some good,
others far from good. Its birth and
progress was almost like a fairy tale,
and the child who watched canoes un-
loading schooners on the Chicago
shore in the early 19th Century lived
to see thousands of locomotives serv-
ing a vast industrial and agricultural
empire.
Ingenious and serious-minded men,
finding their fortunes in Chicago,
worked steadily for its progress. It
made mistakes and they were big
ones but the city developed an
aggressive character of its own and
became energetic, confident and
imaginative. Progress was the ideal,
this being defined largely in terms of
comfort and technical convenience.
It astonished the nation and the world
by its rapid recovery after the nearly
disastrous fire in 1871 and its life in
the roaring ’Bo’s and the opulent ’9o’s
became almost legendary, and by the
turn of the century nearly a million
people lived within five miles of
Chicago’s centre.
The Burnham Plan.
The creative spirit which had stirred
the admiration of visitors from all
parts of the world at the World’s
Fair of 1893 culminated in 1909 in
the completion, under the imaginative
leadership of Daniel H. Burnham, of
the plan for Chicago.
Planner Daniel Burnham saw the
Chicago of the future as a city possess-
ing a beautiful skyline on a leafy lake
shore, an efficient system of diagonal
streets that connected focal points, an
enveloping countryside of woods and
meadows, and a magnificently con-
ceived Civic Centre west of the river.
The present lake-front parks, Union
Station and Roosevelt Road, are
among the solid achievements of
Burnham’s plan.
The Burnham Plan produced more
than mere physical changes in
Chicago. It aroused the interest and
pride of the people. It convinced
them of needs for improvement on a
broad scale seldom before contem-
plated by an American city. The prc-
sent generation, while enjoying the
fruits of the Burnham Plan, can also
contribute to the heritage of future
generations. A lasting contribution
will be a soundly-conceived Civic
Centre, conveniently located and ap-
propriately designed. ’
So speaks the Chicago Plan Com-
mission in the special Brochure that
has been produced to illustrate their
Civic Centre proposals.
The case for a Civic Centre can be
stated in simple financial terms. Gov-
ernment agencies in the Chicago area
now pay over 6,000,000 dollars a year
for space that will be provided in the
Civic Centre. These same government
dollars might be spent more logically
in the development of a Civic Centre
which will be both economical and
efficient.
The Federal Government in Chicago
is scattered in thirty-five locations.
Chicago offices of the State of Illinois
occupy about twenty different loca-
tions, and Cook County has ten busi-
ness addresses. To-day, thousands of
administrators and employees conduct
the city’s business in forty different
offices, at fifteen different locations.
Some of this dispersion i> logical, but
most of it is not. Nor was it planned
that way.
The piecemeal pattern is the result
generally of the growth of government
services, and the absence of parallel
effort to provide for public office
space.
A Logical Step.
The waterside reconstruction of
Chicago took a great step when the
original Master Plan of 1909 produced
the new lake front. The Civic Centre,
it is claimed, is a logical extension of
this process through the re-develop-

that it is conceived as a unit. Rare-

ground up.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


ment of the Chicago River frontage.
The site proposed, bounded on the
west by the Chicago River, on j the
east by Wells Street, and by Madison
and Van Bonen Streets on the north
and south, is a focus of activity m
national, regional and local terms.
The buildings occupy a smaller
proportion of the site than the green
park that surrounds them, and this
green space provides a welcome con-
trast to the crowded city blocks
through which the pedestrian ap-
proaches the Civic Centre from the
Loop.
Space and Height.
Perhaps the most appealing element
of the plan is its airiness. Such a
spacious effect is not to be confuseu
with wasteful exploitation of ground
space. Obviously enough, modern
architectural design has successfully
solved the problem of space by pro-
viding in height what it does not pro-
vide in extended area. Yet, many
modern buildings, especially in central-
city areas, have not solved the prob-
lem of providing traffic and recreation
space around them. This design
solves both problems at once. It pro-
vides a proper atmosphere.
An Elevated Plaza.
An elevated plaza, enclosed by the
three central buildings, is an outdoor
meeting place within a few steps from
government offices. The plaza is
reached by a stair from the lower
shopping level, and from the plaza
pedestrians are provided with an in-
triguing view of the Centre, the build-
ings in the immediate vicinity, and the
entire Loop.
Significantly, for to-day’s needs, the
entire lower level is planned for de-
velopment as a major parking facility
near the heart of the Central Business
District for approximately 3000 cars.
To-day, the Chicago citizen con-
ducts his government business with
City, County, State, and Federal agen-
cies in too many locations. A com-
plete circuit of all these offices amounts
to many miles.of travel. Loss of time
and a sense of needless travel is in-
evitable. Citizens of Chicago are an-
nually . losing thousands of hours of
time and many thousands of dollars
because of the inefficient scattering of
government buildings throughout the
city.
Free Circulation.
Compare this with circulation with-
in the city Civic Centre. No time is,
lost here. Distant parts of the Centre
can be reached swiftly and any point
in the Civic Centre can be reached
from any other point in a few minutes.
The clear separation of automobile
traffic and parking at the lower level,
pedestrian traffic at the Plaza level, and
traffic on the interconnecting pedes-
trian concourse at the 12th floor aids
rapid communication and assures
safety and ease of movement to people
within the Civic Centre.
Pedestrian traffic through the Centre
moves freely in either a horizontal oi
a vertical direction. There are twelve
separate banks of elevators connecting
the parking level, the plaza and the
12th floor concourse. The five main
buildings are interconnected at all
three levels.
Five Main Buildings.
Four governments and their law
courts are quartered in the five pnn-
cipal buildings of the Civic Centre.
The Board of Education occupies a
satellite building to this main group.
The court building occupies the cen-
tral position. On its south stands the
Federal building, on its north the City
building. The State building flanks
them to the south and the County
building to the north.
The interior area of each building
is arranged for the flexible use of in-
terchange of spaces ranging from
court rooms and council chambers to
private offices. This arrangement will
benefit everyone, and future mainten-
costs are kept at a minimum by means
of this internal flexibility.
Three Phases of Development.
The scheme is planned to unfold in
three phases
(1) Land for structures acquired,
approximately eight acres; esti-
mated cost, 10,000,000 dol-
lars; 100,000 sq. ft. of revenue-
producing space provided.
(2) Acquisition of four acres for
plaza area; cost, 5,000,000 dol-
lars; 150,000 sq. ft. of space
provided.
(3) Third and fourth phases cover
the acquisition and clearance of
seventeen acres; cost, 18,000/
000 dollars, to provide parking
area and park space.
Estimated cost of acquiring all the
land and existing improvements is
3 5,000,000 dollars; construction of the
deck over Wacker Drive and the
Plaza area cost 13,000,000 dollars;
landscaping, 2,000,000 dollars: making
total cost approximately 50,000,000
dollars.
It is estimated that the project will
serve 30,000 people.
The scale of the Civic Centre pro-
ject is vast, but so is the city it is
planned to ultimately serve. “Chicago,”
says the Commission, “deserves a pro-
ject of this magnitude.”
The population of Chicago City is
under 4,000,000.
NEW YORK PRODUCTION.
A Correction.
On Page 46 of the December, 1952,
issue in an article entitled Fabulous
New York,” amongst other statistics
quoted to emphasise its vast size and
activity it was said that the gross
value of 1951 industrial output was
14,000,000 dollars: this should have
read 14,000,000,000 dollars.
AND NOW . . . THE TELE-TELEPHONE!
Among the many electronic wonders seen at
the recent National Radio Show at Earl s
Court, London, was the tele-telephone. With
this installation one can see as well as hear
the person called up. Its installation would
save time in large offices and factories. It is
already beyond the experimental stage. In-
cidentally, some 78% of Britain popula-
tion can now be served with television and
nearly 2,000,000 T.V. receivers are already
in use. Nearly 30% of the British radio
manufacturers’ yearly factory output of
£85,000,000 is exported.
SOLIDITY AND LIGHTNESS.
(Top) The new Technical College building
erected for the Cornwall County Council

and presents a striking contrast to the usu-
ally accepted structure. (Bottom) “Sky-
hooks” provide cover for a parking space in

A HOUSE IN EIGHT HOURS
BRITISH BID FOR DOLLAR MARKET.
Recently, in England, ten men set
out at 8 o clock one morning to build
a house by 5 o clock in the evening.
It was finished a few minutes after
4 p.m.
By eight minutes past four the
men had cleaned up and lined up
ready to be congratulated by Works
Minister David Ecclcs (see illustra-
tion).
The Minister had launched the
building race with a blast of a whistle
at eight that morning, and the work'
men beat the allotted nine'hour limit
even with breaks for tea and lunch.
In the spacious living-room of the
house they toasted their accomplish-
ment as they stood in the shadow of
Lincoln Cathedral which took centur-
ies to build as all cathedrals are built
piece-meal and the style of architec-
ture of each section erected invariably
proclaims the period in which it was
built, and Lincoln is no exception ac-
cording to sections built in the Nor-
man and succeeding styles.
While the crew transformed a bare
plot of land into a home—complete
with everything but furniture and the
family to occupy it —across the road
in the Newsum sectional building fac-
tory hundreds of men and women were
turning out their daily quota of simil-
ar houses.
Export Only.
None of these well-built and com-
fortable houses will be erected in
Britain—at least for some time. They
are being built for Canada, which has
a shortage of houses, but a surplus
of dollars. Similar houses have al-
ready been shipped to Australia and
N.Z Africa and Israel, straight from
the Newsum factory. They form part
oi the expanding U.K. export indus-
try of prefabricated buildings, which
is expected to earn £8,000,000 in
1952. Since 1949, not only houses
but whole hospitals, power stations
and schools have been shipped over-
seas.
Trial Order.
The Canadian Government housing
agency has placed a trial order of 28
houses, which have been erected in
Gander, Newfoundland, and Ajax,
Ontario. The current Canadian wint-
er will give the houses a severe test
as to suitability.
Main selling point of the Newsum
organisation is that two- and three-

Heat Resistant Paints
C.5.1.R.0. reports further success
for the heat resisting lentyl titanate
paint developed by its Division of
Industrial Chemistry in collaboration
with the Defence Research Laborator-
ies.
Butyl titanate is now being manu-
factured in the United Kingdom and
several companies are making paints
containing it. Experimental batches
of butyl titanate paint are also being
tested in the U.S.A.
The N.S.W. Department of Rail-
ways has applied the paint in an ex-
tended test for the protection of loco-
motive fire doors. These doors in the
extreme temperature of a locomotive
furnace burn away with a high rate
of wastage.

In this time the unpainted half of
the second door had burnt away com'
pletely, but deterioration was very sub'
stantially reduced on all treated sur'

The railway report concludes that
the application of butyl titanate paint
would result in a marked reduction in
the general wastage of locomotive fire
hole doors.
This practical test again confirms
the value of organic titanium com'
pounds for the manufacture of heat
resistant paints.
Butyl titanate was first developed by
C.5.1.R.0. chemists in 1945. It is an
excellent electrical insulator, and can
be used for the manufacture of heat
resisting plastics. It improves the
weathering properties of normal
paints. Paints manufactured from it
will resist temperatures of 1000°F.;
adhere to metals, glass and even con'
crete; and are resistant to salt water
corrosion.
It is manufactured from the com'
paratively rare minerals rutile and il'
menite which occur in the heavy beach
sands of New South Wales and
Queensland.

New Forest College
in Cyprus
Forestry Centre of the Middle East.
Students from the United Nations
and from four Middle East countries
are attending the first training course
for foresters to be held at the new
Forest College at Prodhromos in Cy-
prus.
With the opening of the College,
Cyprus has taken its place as the
Forestry centre of the Middle East.
The students- —thirty in all —are tak-
ing a one- or two-year course design-
ed to prepare them for the best for-
est services in the Middle East and
Europe.
They are taught the basic sciences
of forestry, such as botany, geology,
climatology and ecology, and the
specialised subjects of silviculture,
crop mensuration, protection and util-
isation, together with surveying and
engineering.
Expert Tuition.
The College, built as part of the
Cyprus Ten-year Development Pro-
gramme, was completed early in 1952.
In addition to lecture rooms and other
service facilities, it combines hostel
accommodation for thirty students,
and is a fully residential institution.
The teaching staff is headed by
Mr. R. J. Streets, who was formerly
in charge of the British Forestry Com-
mission’s Foresters’ College in Nor-
folk. He is assisted by two Cypriot
forest rangers whom he trained in
Britain.
The Forest Department in Cyprus
is the oldest established forestry ser-
vice in the Colonies and its new Col-
lege at Prodhromos will have a great
effect in the development of the is-
lands’ forests.
Ten-year Plan.
New roads and communication sys-
tems have already been improved and
an effective fire protection scheme put
into operation, under the Forest De-
partment’s Ten-year Plan. Extensive
areas of formerly derelict land in the
mountain regions and in the plains
have been successfully afforested.
The new Forest College will add to
the progressive development of Cy-
prus as a whole, and will make an
important contribution to international
forestry development in the Middle
East, by training students for forest
services of neighbouring countries.
DEVELOPING INSTRUMENTS
FOR ATOMIC SCIENCE.
By JOSEPH EARL.
English technical journalist.
In all branches of. work connected
with atomic energy there is a vital and
growing need for instruments which
will detect the radiations given off by
radio - active materials. These are
equally important whether used in
Government research laboratories, in
hospitals, factories, or in areas where
Civil Defence workers may have to
detect harmful radiations which would
come from atomic bomb attacks.
Naturally, the varied requirements
call for a wide diversity of such in'
struments which are called “monitors.”
Many of them must be portable and
must work from batteries. Some are
adapted to examine water supplies.
Two of these instruments which are
in production in Britain each weigh
less than 14 lb. They are sensitive
enough to detect the minute radiations
given off by a luminous wrist watch,
robust enough to withstand the kind
of treatment they are likely to get,
and will work for long periods with'
out attention of any kind.
Nucleonic instruments of this and
other kinds which are used for
measuring things - the strength of
radiations, the thickness of sheet mate'
rials, the numbers of things in packets,
and so on were shown at the recent
international Instruments and Measure-
ments Exhibition and Conference in
Stockholm.
Peaceful Purposes.
The atomic pile itself is a scientific
instrument designed to produce atomic
reactions. More and more these reac-
tions are being applied to peaceful
purposes. Already, products of the
niles, such as radio-active isotopes, are
being used in medicine, veterinary and
agricultural science and to a growing
extent in industry. Soon it will be
commonplace to find in factories such
things as beta-ray thickness gauges,
and package monitors, ionization in-
struments for preventing static elec-
tricity, and scores of other instruments
for specialised uses.
The range of industries in which
isotopes are now used extends from
iron and steel, through plastics and
textiles, to drugs and fine chemicals.
In medicine the radio-activity of the
isotopes makes them invaluable
“tracers” which can disclose minute
details of the functioning of the
human body. Their curative proper-
ties are already established in some
diseases, and they are replacing X-rays
in some cancer treatments.
This tremendous and rapid growth
of a new science has led to a corres-
ponding growth in the instruments
needed for it. Many previously used

AN UNUSUAL SIGN.
This huge sign for a Californian Food Store
is certainly both appropriate and dramatic.
It is 49ft. by 42ft., stands 52ft. high a nd [?]
made of steel bands 18 inches wide “woven"
in between the steel uprights. It is said
that the sign “breathes” because of the open
areas in the woven pattern and thus has little
wind resistance.

have been makeshift in design and
manufacture. That phase has ended,
and the instruments now coming for-
ward, including many which were on
show in Stockholm, carry the evidence
of maturity. They work properly and
safely, they look good, and those
meant to be used by the unskilled will
function efficiently in their hands.
Behind this change is the work of the
scientific instrument maker. In this
field Britain has always had a tradition
of fine craftsmanship. Now the in-
strument maker’s skill is being mar-
ried to the work of the specialists in
radio-active materials.
The Radiation “Monitor.”
Already more than thirty United
Kingdom firms are making instru-
ments for use in connection with
nucleonics. Most common of the in-
struments is the radiation monitor.
It detects radiations in laboratories,
hospitals, and the factories in which
work with considerable amounts of
radio-active materials is carried on.
Some of these instruments also record
the intensity of radiations over a
specified period.
At the other extreme are the great
machines for use in research into
atomic energy and as powerful X-ray
sources. One of these is just about
to be delivered to the British Atomic
Energy Research Establishment at
Harwell in the English county of
Berkshire. It is a 15,000,000 electron
volt linear accelerator. Its purpose is
to accelerate beams of electrons until
they reach a velocity of 99.95 per
cent, of the speed of light. These
extremely fast electrons strike a heavy
‘metal target and produce very hard
X- or gamma rays of the order of
2000 Roentgens at one metre.
The simplest instruments used in
nucleonics as yet are the pocket radia-
tion monitors. These are worn by
people working with atomic energy
and by hospital staffs using X-rays or
isotopes. These monitors are about
the size of a fountain pen, but ac-
curately record the amount of radia-
tion to which the wearer has been ex-
posed during a given period.
Necessarily there has grown up a
whole technology of complicated in-
struments needed by research workers
which consist of electronic machines
which were at first adapted to their
new purposes. Now these machines
are specially designed and built for
the work. During the seven years of
Harwell’s history a vast amount of
this technical knowledge has been
gathered by United Kingdom
specialists and it is now being put to
practical uses. The cream of this
knowledge is embodied in the British
Scientific Instrument Manufacturers'
Association of which every firm con-
nected with the manufacture of
nucleonic instruments is a member.
Australia—A Carefree Nation
LACKS “BROTHERHOOD-OF-MAN” IDEALISM.
By FLORENCE M. TAYLOR.
The world has now a population
of 2,500,000,000. It has douoled it-
self in the last century. People are
increasing at the rate of 50,000 a
day, so that by the time 43 years
have elapsed they will number
40.000.
How to feed them, house them,
clothe them in this “Brotherhood-of-
man’’ idealistic age is our problem-
and theirs.
Australia’s Vast Open Spaces.
Australia with its vast open spaces
and 8,500,000 population could do a
lot to help, by firstly conserving water
and growing trees, and more trees so
as to preserve the earth s outer crust,
for erosion is a quiet ceaseless devas-
tator which nobody heeds despite
warnings. The earth’s crust must be
nourished by trees, not starved as we
are so ruthlessly and constantly do-
ing. Our vegetation surfaces are
capable of expansion and we could
exploit our mineral wealth, which as
yet is almost untapped.
White Australia Or?
Our natural population is increas-
ing at the rate of ljr% per year. The
door is only just ajar for migrants,
though Holland could send 50,000
people a year. That Nation of
10.000. souls cannot possibly ex-
pand on its 15,764 square miles of
territory. Britain could send 50,000,
Italy 200,000, and other nations would
want to participate.
There are 9,000,000 “expellees" in
Germany from other troubled coun-
tries who would welcome coming to
work in Australia, and, if we worked
harder and longer to build houses
quickly for them, and grow food and
find employment, our country could
develop so as to absorb them. They
would make desirable citizens.
India with a 300,000,000 popula-
tion has marvellous watercourses and
irrigation channels (the conservation
control and distribution of which she
owes to British engineers), but she
finds it more profitable to grow' hemp
for money than food for her under-
nourished millions. Every few years
a scourge will take off 5,000,000 or
10.000. which is regarded as a
successful year.
Russia has penetrated into Afghan-
istan adjoining, which means noth-
ing to us. We are so dumb.
Pakistan spends 70% of her en-
tire income on military preparation.
India spends 40% of her entire in-
come on military preparation. They
fear each other mostly, but the pre-
paration is available for any emerg-
ency.
Indonesia with 70,000,000 souls is
a seething cauldron of political in-
trigue from which nothing compre-
hensive can be expected until she
settles dowm. She grows nee abund-
antly and her paddy fields are a credit
to the workers. Russia fosters and
exploits revolutionary situations such
as exist here. According to Emery
Bares it is “a Red Legend. Central
Java has a population of 1900 people
to the square mile, Australia has less
than 3 people to the square mile.
China. with its population of
500.000. is becoming very war-
like, and with the aid of Russia it has
purloined Tibet as a’ military base,
while it still carries on the Korean
war which has cost Australia many
lives and much money (Australian
statistics not available). America has
poured £7,500,000,000 into this same
war, and has 21,984 dead, and total
casualties numbering 125,887 to 24th
November, 1952. We have no record
of England’s figures, but the Indo-
China war is costing France
£500,000,000 a year, which all serves
the same Russian purpose.

pleted during World War 11., but it

is catching up again with a popula-
tion of 90,000,000. 75% of its tiny
island surfaces are not suitable for
cultivation and it lives on what the
remaining 25% of land surface will
yield, mostly rice, young bamboo
shoots and fish.
Japan is very population-minded,
whereas Australia couldn’t care less.
At the present we are only living for
the highest pay, for the lowest pro-
duction, for the fewest working hours
and mediocrity that must accrue from
this attitude, and after all this comes
an abundance of holidays and sports
galore.
It must be admitted that we are a
very care-free nation in a world that is
far from being care-free.
Our Country Is Worth Working For.
We have yet to learn that we can-
not live for ourselves alone, and that
besides defending our country in
Korea, it is worth working for at
home—and working hard for it, so
that we may forge ahead among all
the nations of the world. Nature has
given us a most bounteous country.
It is ours to develop to the fullest
measure, if we will.
Mr. R. G. Ca sey once suggested
that each worker should give of his
efforts 5 hours a week for his coun-
try. This would automatically reduce
costs by J?th. of present costs. This
would enable our country to compete
in a world market instead of pricing
ourselves out of it as we are so rapidly
doing.
EUROPE-AFRICA TUNNEL.
From London to Cape Town by
rail has every appearance of becom-
ing a reality, according to overseas
reports. At the moment two obstacles
remain to be overcome: first, an Eng-
lish Channel tunnel; second, a tun-
nel beneath the Strait of Gibraltar.
The second obstacle may, in the
near future, start to disappear if the
Marquis of Mulhacen is allowed to
proceed with plans for eliminating the
ten-mile gap which today separates
the two continents.
He estimates a tunnel under the
Straits could be built for £90,000,000,
the whole project to take six years.

Mobile Offices For U.K. Builders
As modern methods replace old
practices, British builders are turning
more and more to quicker means of
getting jobs done.
Latest innovation is the use of mod-
ern caravans to replace the familiar
wooden huts, used by builders during
construction work on sites. The ad-
vantages are many; the caravans are
light, clean, quickly transferred from
site to site, whereas huts had to be
brought in sections and unloaded.
Our illustrations show two differ-
ent types of mobile offices in use on
building jobs.

termini to run, without change of
coaches, to Cape Town.
Only Yesterday.
By the middle of the 19th century
our ancestors had the tools and ma-
chines necessary for building a perm-
anent link between the British Isles
and the Continent. The more imag-
inative engineers came up with
schemes by the dozen for making the
connection across the English Channel
—by bridge, tunnel, or submarine
railway.
In 1882, a tunnel was actually be
ing built under the Channel, and a
Press reception was held at the bot-
tom of the sea, after a mile and a
half of the tunnel to France had been
completed. In that year, however,
work on the tunnel was stopped for
reasons of defence and never resumed.
Thirteen years earlier, in 1869, the
French engineer submitted to Napol-
eon 111. plans for a submarine rail-
way with pneumatically powered cars.
Nothing ever came of it, but contem-
porary drawings show a submarine-
like craft with propellers fore and
aft, mounted on a six-wheeled dolly,
running on rails across the sea bed.
The permanent-way had been built
level with culverts and causeways.
Conning towers and portholes com-
pleted the structure, but there is no
indications how the occupants were
supplied with air.
UNDERGROUND OPAL TOWN.
Opals, in spite of the superstitious
belief that they bring bad luck to
their owners, may soon become ex'
tremely valuable, for the N.S.W. opah
mining fields are reported to be dry-
ing up.
The barren expanse of this area
are the main source of opals in the
world, and Australia has been export-
ing £2,000,000 worth of the stones
annually.
Goober Pedy, in Central Australia,
is the centre where the most opals
have been mined during the past 50
years. Discovered by accident in
1915. it had been nearly w r orked out
and abandoned by 1946. Then an
aboriginie found a new vein eight
miles from the old site, and a new
rush was on.
Today an entire community of some
400 men, women and children work,
eat, sleep, and live deep in the sub-
soil from which they gouge their
wealth. No bricks or mortar are need-
ed to build their homes. Stripped to
the waist in the desert heat of Central
Australia .the men carve each crude
dwelling from the soft sandstone with

"GOING IP?”
THE STORY OF THE LIFT.
The Genius of Elisha Otis.
Interest Revived.
History tells us that almost 2000
years ago the poet Virgil became in-
fatuated with a beautiful maiden who
dwelt in a tall tower, and he sought
permission to visit her in her lofty
abode. Apparently consenting, the
fair maiden started to haul Virgil up
in a contraption consisting of a barrel
suspended by a rope and operated by
a crude, hand-worked windlass.
But as the ardent poet approached
the summit the young lady suddenly
halted the device and left Virgil dang-
ling between sky and earth, while a
bevy of her fair friends burst into
peals of merriment from adjoining
rooms.
Early Devices.
Undaunted by Virgil’s unhappy ex-
perience, the gadget-conscious people
of that era found the idea of a ver-
tical ride irresistable. Tiberius, the
Roman Emperor, installed a water-
driven lift in his palace about A.D.
25. Before this conception, a Roman
architect, about B.C. 26 wrote of
several devices, used as early as 236
8.C., for raising weights. The citi-
zens of Pompeii were using both
goods and passenger lifts suspended
by bronze wire when their city was
Egyptians since the beginning of
their recorded history have been rais-
ing water from the Nile by bucket
hoist and there has been no difference
in the windlass theory for 6000 years,
whether applied to a bucket of water
from a well or a river or a passenger
lift used to-day, though power motives
and safety devices that need not de-
pend on the human element are revo-
lutionary in the latter.
Twelve huge lifts in the Roman
Coliseum hoisted wild animals and
gladiators from subterranean cells to
the floor of the arena. This must
have been in the first Colosseum in-
augurated by Titus. The existing
structure did not come in until after
the great fire in 217 A.D. It show's
no device for raising animals, though
plenty of passages and trapdoors are
recorded. But even underground
traps would require some kind of a
hoist.
Many of these early devices —power-
ed variously by slaves, animals, coun-
terweigh.s, water and even the w'ind —-
were amazingly complex, but with the
onset of the dark ages the art of
elevator making vanished.
The few that remained were used
in monasteries, where primitive basket
hoists were used to lift monks and
travellers up formidable mountain
precipices to otherwise inaccessible
eyries.
In the 17th Century there was a
revival of interest in passenger lifts
when a Frenchman named Velayer
produced a “flying chair” which real-
ly worked—although crudely.
This device employed a rope which
ran over a wheel supported by an arm
extending from the roof of a build-
ing. On one end of the rope was a
chair, on the other a sandbag counter-
weight.
To go up, the passenger sat in the
chair, unhooked an anchoring sand-
bag and pulled himself skyward hand
over hand by means of a second rope.
When he reached his floor, he simply
anchored his chair to a nearby hook,
opened a window and stepped in.
Flying chairs finally fell into dis-
repute when the daughter of Lou*
XIV became stuck between floors and
had to remain there for three terrify-
ing hours while workmen broke
through the thick walls and effected
her rescue.
Unhappy Experience.
History tells us that some years
after this unpleasant episode a wealthy
Parisian named Throuvier installed
the first recorded secret lift in his
mansion.
It appealed to his sense of humour
to say “Au-revoir” to his friends on
an upper floor, offering some excuse
for not seeing them off the premises.
When they were wearily making their
way down the winding stairs he would
descend in his lift and greet them
boisterously in the courtyard, to their
utter bewilderment.
But one day the lift descended
with such speed that, instead of sur-
prising his friends agreeably, he did
so “most disagreebaly.” He used the
staircase after that.
In spite of these occasional difficul-
ties, many royal palaces were soon
equipped with counterweight hoists,
some running in special shafts with
cages to protect the passengers.
By 1830, lifts driven by hydraulic
plungers were in use in a few English
factories, and the London G.P.O. was
equipped with a lift system in which
several cabins were attached to an
endless chain.
Safety Devices.
America’s first real contribution to
the problem of vertical ascent came in
1852, when a Vermont-born master
mechanic named Elisha Otis attached
the leaf spring of a waggon to the
roof of a lift ca?e and hooked a cable
to the spring. If the cable broke, the
spring, relieved of the pull of the
rope, straightened out and caught in
ratchets on both sides of the shaft,
thus stopping the cage.
Many other safety devices followed.
In the years 1880 and 1886, 328
patents were issued in the U.S.A. on
lifts and safety devices.
With the invention of the electric
life in 1880 by Werner Siemens, of
Berlin, the potential height of the
shaft was greatly increased, and the
skyscraper became feasible.
To-day, high-speed electric lifts
travel 1200 ft. a minute up the tower
of the Empire State Building in New
York City, tallest structure in the
world.
Better hoisting devices have im-
proved the ride until the passenger
scarcely realises the cab is in motion,
except for certain internal sensations
associated with gravity.
Wilhelm Klein, of Frankfurt, a 52-
year-old professional blood donor,
claims a world record by giving alto-
gether 879 pints of blood in 1500
transfusions in the last 15 years.
ERA OF THE UNUSUAL.
The development of unusual shapes and forms
appears to be the major pursuit of some pres-
ent-day designers. Top example shows a table
that looks like a deformed boomerang, tha-
has been “grounded”. In the centre is an
office with furniture supported on spindley
legs no thicker than electric light conduit
and the draws of which are moveable wicker
baskets that may have the advantage of their
shiftability to strong rooms at night. Bottom
left is a plant and ornament stand supported
by spindles which, being metal, are strong
enough to support all the weight likely to
be put on to it. Optic illustions that it is
almost floating in air have to remain uncor-
rected. Bottom right shows some frail look-
ing chairs made of mesh.

AN UNUSUAL CIVIC CENTRE
PERTH SHOWPLACE AT COTTESLOE.
The most unusual Civic Centre in
Australia is to be founded at Cottesloe,
eight miles from Perth, and overlook-
ing the Indian Ocean.
The suburb of Cottesloe is a popu-
lar residential district, enhanced by its
sandy white beaches, which are in
themselves an added attraction.
The district was named Cottesloe
on September 21, 1886, bv the then
Governor, Sir Frederick Napier
Broome, as a compliment to Captain
Freemantle, who took possession of
Western Australia for the Crown, and
who afterwards became Baron Cot-
tesloe of Swanbourne and Heard-
wick. The name of Swanburne has
been given to the adjoining district
north of Cottesloe.
Local government in Cottesloe be-
gan in a former butcher’s shop. In
1904 the board moved into a wooden
hall, and four years later the Cottesloe
Municipal Council was created. In
1950, after many homes, the Council
changed its venue to the imposing villa
known as Overton Lodge (see illus-
tration) which has now become the
Cottesloe War Memorial Town Hall
and Civic Centre.
This magnificent villa was built by
Mr. R. W. Pennefather, Q.C.. in 1899,
and it was purchased bv -the mining
magnate, Mr. de Bernales, in 1911.
He made some alterations and called
it Overton Lodge, after his Brixton
London, birthplace.
In 1936 Mr. de Bernales commenc-
ed to transform Overton Lodge into
a Spanish style mansion which would
be a showplace of the State. No ex-
pense was spared, and the final build-
ing. alterations, and additions cost
£7OOO. These included a study, li-
brary and billiards room, all with
french-polished jarrah walls and ceil-
ing and jarrah parquetry floors, three
additional bedrooms with odjoining
bathrooms, and a breakfast room.
Master Builders who visited Perth
for the recent Master Builders’ Feder-
ation of Australia Convention spoke
with admiration of the splendid crafts-
manship evident in the construction
of the Lodge, and especially in the
woodwork.
It spoke volumes, Mr. Charles
Thompson said, for the standard of
workmanship to which Australian
craftsmen can attain, given the encour-
agement, and the opportunity to pro-
duce their best.
The property is enclosed by 3000
feet of stone wall 15 feet high, dom-
inated by balustrading designed in
the Italian classic style. Dr. Benales
knew more about getting rich than
he did of architecture, or he would
never have surrounded the simple yet
delightful Spanish building with ful-
some Italian walling.
Civic Centre.
To meet the requirements of a civic
centre, open porticos were enclosed
by large glass windows to make tea-
rooms. These windows open upon
lawns where teas are also served under
shady beach umbrellas. The upstairs
ballroom has been enlarged and now
measures 80 feet by 30 feet. The
dining room, with its massive fire-
place overhung with an equally mas-
sive mirror, is now the council cham-
ber.
Many other alteraticpns have made
space available for the town clerk s
office, an infant health clinic, and an
R.S.L. clubroom.

(Top) Glimpse of the portico, where meals
are served, as diners look out across the

Civic Centre were once undulating sandhills
until Mr. de Benales had them terraced and
two feet of surfacing soil deposited over the
whole area. The soil came from the Darling
Ranges 27 miles away. One can do all these
things with money as he made it. This
view is of the level centre tower overlooking
spacious lawns and beaches. Like Mr.
Woolcott Forbes (whose case is now being
heard in Sydney) who built the beautiful
Lady Gowrie Hospital as a suitable residence
for himself, Mr. de Benales thoughts turned
to beautiful architecture and having built
these buildings their names will be immor-
talised when all their other transactions will
have been forgotten.

Hot Snrav
Improves Finishing
Technique
An ingenious alternative to the use
of volatile thinners for reducing the
viscosity of finishing enamels is a de-
vice which heats the paint on its
way to the spray gun.
The new process, which is of
American origin (the Arco Company
of Cleveland, Ohio), should be of par-
ticular interest to the automobile in-
dustry as it appears to solve a number
of temperature and humidity prob-
lems—and needs only one coat to
give a perfect surface. Besides this,
it saves solvent costs, greatly reduces
blushing and practically eliminates
runs.
Built into the spray line, the “Con-
trol-Temp,” as the new device is call-
ed, is a small cylinder eight inches
long and weighing a pound and a
half. Inside the cylinder is a helical
tube through which steam at five or
ten pounds pressure or water at 200
degrees F. is circulated. The finish-
ing material passes round the outside
of this tube on its way to the gun.
The cylinder is completely insulated
so that it can be held in the operat-
or’s left hand while he works the
gun with his right. Alternatively, it
can be hung from a waist belt or
even dragged along the floor for it is
equipped with heavy duty rubber
bumpers to withstand rough usage.
The “Control-Temp” uses a stand-
ard spray gun with room tempera-
ture air pressure. One great advant-
age is that no special circulating
equipment is needed and only the
finishing enamel actually used is
heated.
Although only a small quantity of
finishing material is in the heating
unit at any particular moment, heat-
ing action is so rapid that it is quite
easy to maintain an output of one
and a half pints per minute. There is
an economy in operator’s time since
there is no warm-up period needed.
Cleaning is normally done by
flushing the heater with solvent. At
intervals, the unit will benefit from
an alkaline cleaning of the outer shell
through which the finishing medium
has passed.
Where there is no heat source
available, a small steam generator or
a 35 gallon hot water tank with cir-
culating pump will normally be ade-
quate.
Contract Signed For U.S. Memorial
QUEEN MAY UNVEIL AUSTRALIAN TRIBUTE.
The Queen will be asked to unveil
the Australian war memorial to the
United States in Canberra during the
Royal tour next year.
In the presence of Federal Parlia'
mentary and U.S. consular represent-
atives the £63,661 contract for the
national memorial was signed last Fri-
day, in the office of the contractors.
The Immediate Past Federal Pres-
ident of the Australian-American As-
sociation, Mr. E. K. White, and Mr.
D. S. McConnell, managing-director
of McConnell Building Co. Pty. Ltd.,
Master Builders, Macquarie Street,
signed the contract.
Money for the memorial, which will
be erected in King Avenue, near
Duntroon Military College, was sub-
scribed throughout Australia.
The memorial, which was designed
by a Sydney architect, Mr. R. M.
Ure, will be an aluminium covered
column 250 ft. high, surmounted by a
ball and a 35ft. eagle.
Mr. McConnell said it was anticipate
ed that the memorial would be com'
pleted by November 30, and the Aus'
tralian'Amcrican Association hoped
Queen Elizabeth would unveil it dur'
ing the Royal Tour in 1954.
Speaking at the signing, Mr. White
said it was a climax to the efforts of
the Federal memorial committee to
build a memorial which would syfn-
bolise Australia’s gratitude to Amer-
ica for coming to our aid in World
War 11.
The Federal Navy and Air Minister,
Mr. McMahon, representing the
Prime Minister, said the Federal Gov'
eminent felt the memorial was a posh
tivc indication of the cemented rela'
tionship between the U.S.A. and Aus-
tralia.
The Senate Opposition Leader,
Senator N. E. McKenna, read a mes-
sage from the Federal Parliamentarv
Labour Leader, Dr. E. V. Evatt, in
which he said that wartime Prime
Minister lohn Curtin made a direct
appeal to President Roosevelt which
resulted in General MacArthur com-
ing to Australia.
The Acting Consul-General for the
United States, Mr. K. F. Potter, said
“The memorial will be a symbol of
the continuing warm and friendly re
lationships of our two countries.’
Mr. White signed for the Associa
tion in the absence of the president
Sir lohn Latham, through illness.

Are Airships
Coming Back?
In recent months the first British
airship to be built for 20 years made
its maiden flight.
Most aviation experts consider these
sky'vessels as out'dated —-costly to
build, slow, clumsy, dangerous to fly,
but recent experiments have probably
shown the shape of things to come,
for modern authorities on air travel
are thinking of their return.
They list the following advantages
over aircraft: They can run to a
more definite timetable. They do not
need lengthy runways or costly blind'
landing systems. They can stand still
in their own element, and as a result
there is no cause for alarm when the
engines stop.
The old airships faced two dangers
-—fire and “back'breaking”—which
combined to make them a perilous
form of transport. Now both of these
problems have been overcome, and
airships of the future will be just as
safe as ocean liners.
Fires were generally caused by hy'
drogen, the highly inflammable gas
which was used as a lifting agent. At
the time there was no suitable gas
which could be used as a substitute,
but now helium, which is non-in-
flammable, has been produced in suf'
cient quantities to replace the hydro'
gen.
The danger of back'breaking has
been eliminated by building on a huge
bow'shaped girder, with great width in
the centre and tapered ends.
Other Factors.
Other important factors which help
to make the modern airship a practic'
able proposition are improved wire'
less, radar equipment which will
eliminate the dangers of fog and
heavy weather, and a wider range of
fabrics and metal alloys to build with.
Plans are already in hand for the
construction of giant skywessels which
will contain private cabins, dining'
rooms and smoking rooms. These
craft will combine speed with coni'
fort and grace. In the field of com'
merce, it is maintained by many ex'
perts that they can well outstrip aero'
planes in the economical carriage of
merchandise.
To give an idea of their vast cap'
acity as load carriers, it was recently
demonstrated in the U.S.A. that an
airship 850 ft. long could house from
seven to nine fully loaded heavy
bombing aircraft.
GRAND COCKTAIL PARTY.
When Bradford Insulation Pty. Ltd.
opened an office in Canberra, it
“sprang a party” to commemorate the
occasion.
No less than 120 Ministers, Senat'
ors, leading officers from Government
Departments, Chambers of Manufac'
tures, etc., attended, and, of course,
their own personnel from all over Aus'
tralia with Mr. George Bradford at
the head of affairs.
A recent British Post Office deveh
opment is a robot letter "facing” and
cancelling machine which copes with
320 letters a minute. If these were
sorted and stamped by hand it would
take a man 16 times as long.
Birmingham Small Arms Co.
(Britain), will soon be turning out
rifle parts based on a casting process
first used to make idols and temple
bells in China 4000 B.C. Experts say
the “new” method is simpler, more
flexible than modern processes.
Fewer Houses
Under Construction
September Quarter Shows Decline.
The Acting Commonwealth Statis'
tician, Mr. S. R. Carver, said last
week that there were about 4400
fewer new houses under construction
in the three months that ended on
September 30, 1952, than in the pre'
vious quarter.
In the September quarter, 77,576
houses were under construction in
Australia, a drop of 6250 since Sep'
tember, 1951.
In the same quarter, 20,107 homes
were completed, about equal to those
of the previous quarter.
The number of new houses com'
menced fell by more than 2000 to
15,683. The total fall over the whole
year was 6368 houses.
N.S.W.
In New South Wales, 31,062 new
houses were under construction, a
quarterly fall of over 18,800. The
number of houses commenced was
4496, a drop of almost 1300.
In the same quarter. 6318 houses
were completed in N.S.W., a slight
increase on the previous quarter.
Workers.
People working on new construe'
tion on September 30, 1952, in the
whole of Australia totalled 109,639, a
fall of more than 5000 on the pre'
vious quarter and a fall of 16,844
since September, 1951.
In N.S.W., on September 24,
1952, 36,930 people were engaged in
new buildings, a drop of 2849 on
the previous quarter, and of 8634
in the 12 months under review.
CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION.
The durability of concrete construction was
demonstrated in an unusual manner by the
upper building, which is part of the Uni-
versity of Miami. In 1926 a hurricane
stopped the University building programme
and for 24 years the concrete skeleton stood
exposed to wind, sun and rain. In 1950
further funds being available the building
was found to be quite structurally sound
and with slight re-designing was completed
as shown. Below is the interior of a new
building in which the circular concrete col-
umns set back from the facade enable the
whole of the external walls to be built of
glass bricks without a break in their con-
tinuity.
-“Progressive Architecture and Architect-
ural Record," U.S.A,
CAST CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION.
Pre-cast concrete units —grilles, balustrade,
posts, etc., are used extensively in this re-
cent French building—the International Insti-
tute d’Adiopodoume. With its tiled roof
and sheltering verandahs it appears to be well
suited for its purpose in a tropical climate
overlooking the lake.

AN EXAMPLE OF VOLUNTARY CO-OPERATION
THE SYDNEY STREET OPENINGS CONFERENCE.
Twice a year a group of men, the
Sydney Street Openings Conference,
meet to co-ordinate for the whole of
metropolitan Sydney, the digging up
of streets for renewals and repairs to
underground mains and for carriage-
way reconstruction. The result of
their activities has been to save the
community substantial sums of money,
greatly to reduce the inconvenience
of traffic, and in particular the avoid-
ance of digging up of newly con-
structed roadways.
The half-yearly meetings of the
Sydney Street Opening Conference
are held at the Sydney Town Hall,
under the chairmanship of the Town
Clerk, City of Sydney (Mr. Roy
Hendy). In addition to the Sydney
City Council the following bodies are
represented: Australian Gas Light
Company; North Shore Gas Co. Ltd.;
Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and
Drainage Board; Postmaster-General's
Department; Department of Rail-
ways; Department of Government
Fransport; Sydney County Council;
Sydney City Council’s Engineer De-
partment; Department of Main
Local Government Associa-
tion; Local Government and High-
way Engineering Branch of the In-
stitution of Engineers.
Details of Works Supplied.
Each of these organisations sup-
plies details to the Town Clerk of
works protected during the succeed-
ng six months, which are then com-
Pined and issued to each of the bod-
es represented.
The Conference also provides a
means of dealing with special cir-
cumstances as, for example, the lim-
itation of street opening prior to cere-
monial occasions.
The Sydney Street Openings Con-
ference was instituted by the Sydney
City Council, and held its inaugural
meeting on the 10th March, 1909.
A special work of importance
carried out by the Conference was the
preparation and review from time to
time of a scheme for space allocation
for underground services on footways.
So far as possible, new underground
services other than sewers, are usu-
ally now placed in footways, in ac-
cordance with the standard space al-
location adopted by the Conference.
The Conference considers also such
matters as methods of pavement re-
instatement with special reference to
backfilling of trenches so as to reduce
to a minimum subsequent subsidence
with its attendent further cost to the
road authority and possible danger to
the travelling public. Raking back
of utility poles at the kerb line to pro-
vide greater clearance for double
decker buses has also been consid-
er e-d.
UNDERWATER TELEVISION.
First underwater television pictures
taken 16 miles out to sea and 100
feet down were received recently
through a ship-to-shore link-up by the
British Admiralty at the Portsmouth
Naval Barracks.
And Now
Moving Pavements
EFFORTLESS SHOPPING.
Latest idea for shifting crowds is
the moving pavement. For a year a
trial strip 85ft. long and 2ft. wide has
been under test by experts at Akron,
Ohio. Faults have been corrected and
it is now said to be almost perfect.
It operates rather like an escalator
laid flat. The passenger steps on it,
grasps a handrail, and your journey
starts. Built sectionally, it has speeds
varying from less than one mile per
hour to five miles per hour. You
step on to the slow section and then
transfer to the speedier strip.
When a proposed new' subway
shuttle system was introduced between
Times Square and Grand Central Sta-
tion. New York, late in 1952, a mow
ing pavement was also included in the
plans.
The day may come when mobile
pavements are common in Sydney and
Melbourne, where the need for them,
or some similar invention, is apparent,
especially in Martin Place and Pitt
Street, Sydney, and Collins Street and
Flinders Street, Melbourne. And
after moving sidewalks, why not mov-
ing roads and streets to do away
with the motor car nuisance!
“STREET OPENINGS” CONFERENCE AT THE TOWN HALL. SYDNEY.
In order to try and reduce and control the indiscriminate digging of “bigger and. better holes” in Sydney's streets
a "Street Openings" Conference, attended by representatives of the various public utility authorities, was held
at the Sydney I own Hall on November 24 last. Similar meetings are held twice a year under the chairmanship
of the Town Clerk, Mr. Roy Hendy.

Generous Use of Paint Reduces
Industrial Accidents
BRIGHT PAINTS GENERATE BOTH PRIDE IN THE PLANT
AND SAFETY.
By Our American Correspondent.
The National Safety Council re-
cently has published a report on
Colour in Industry. In it you will
find the generally accepted instruction
on how to use colour on plant in'
teriors.
Historically first was developed a
pipe code. The contents of pipes,
according to the pipe code. tO'day are
classified in this manner: Fire protec'
tion, red; dangerous content, orange
or yellow; safe content, green; pro'
tection materials, bright blue; valuable
materials, purple.
Safety Colour Code.
Here is the classification contained
in the American Standards Associa'
tion Safety Colour Code:
(1) Red is used to identify fire
protection equipment or its
location, inflammable liquid
containers, emergency stop but'
tons for electrical switches, etc.
(2) Yellow or yellow and black
stripes are recommended for
marking hazards that may re'
suit in accidents from slipping,
falling, and bumping into ob'
jects.
(3) Green with white designates
the location of first-aid and
safety equipment such as shcb
ters, gas masks, bulletin boards,
etc.
(4) Black and white is used for
housekeeping and traffic mark'
ings.
Three other colours have been pro-
posed as an addition to the Safety
Colour Code. They will probably be
included in later editions of the Code:
(5) Orange, to attract attention to
special hazards or guards out
of place.
(6) Purple for radiation hazards.
(7) Blue for caution, to be used at
power sources, etc.
There is a third colour code for
accident prevention signs. It uses red
for special dangers; yellow for pos-
sible dangers or unsafe practices;
green for safety instructions; black for
directions to stairways and exits. All
three codes have a sufficient con-
formity.
Colour Improves
the Plant Morale.
The right colours and colour com-
binations in our homes, offices, plants
and travel accommodations are highly
important both for health and effi'
ciency. Repainting a plant interior
in the proper colours increases the
production, as we have learned by
now from many experiences. Bright,
light colours have a stimulating and
cheering influence on most people,
producing very much the same effects
as would friendly words of encourage'
ment.
There is no doubt, V. R. Croswcll
stated recently, that colour on equip'
ment and plant interior improves the
plant morale. It generates pride in
the plant and in the job. It is one of
the biggest helps in solving house'
keeping problems. And anything that
increases employee interest in the job
and improves housekeeping will auto'
matically increase safety.
Bright Paints,
But Not Too Bright.
Light'Coloured surfaces may reflect
too much and produce glare, resulting
in eye strain and fatigue. The per'
centage of light reflected is:
White 82'89%
Cream 73*78%
Ivory 62'80%
Buff 61*75%
Aluminium .. .. 65%
Light Green .. .. 49'66%
Dark Green .. .. 11'25%
Yellow 48'75%
Light Wood (Tan) 42*49%
Grey 36*61%
Light Blue .. .. 34*61%
Pink 3046%
Dark Tan 17*63%
Brown Wood .. 17'29%
Dark Red 13*30%
White usually is ilsed on the ceiling
and colours of medium reflectance
values for working surfaces, walls and
floors. As a general rule, ceilings
should reflect 75 per cent, of the light
that strikes them, in order to provide
adequate lighting on the working
place.
Colours having reflectance values of
50% to 60% are recommended for
walls directly in line with the workers’
eyes. This means proper and restful
conditions for the eyes. Floors should
have a reflectance factor of 25%.
An article in “Fortune” magazine
stresses the magnitude of the improve*
ment in plant morale that followed a
good paint job with improved visi*
bility and safety. Responsible plant
executives, according to “Fortune,”
say that colour in the plant has re*
duced eye strain and physical fatigue;
has been responsible for a definite im*
provement in production; and has re*
duced absenteeism 20%. A plant im*
proved with bright colours is said to
attract a higher type of workers.
R. J. Cooke reported an experience
in a large plant where new workers
were given the task of unloading
boxes of rivets from freight cars. The
boxes were painted black and the men
took frequent rests, slowing up the
unloading time. At the advise of a
colour expert the boxes were painted
light green. Immediately the men
began taking fewer rest periods; the
empty freight cars moved out of the
yard faster. Painting the boxes a
light colour had created an optical
illusion which made the workmen less
conscious of fatigue.
Drop in Accidents
Due to Re-painting.
“Textile World” recently published
the experience of Rome Hosiery Mills
in Rome, Georgia, which in its in*
dividual way, by using new paints,
produced a sharp drop in minor acci*
dents as well as near*injuries.
Machinery had been painted be*
fore to indicate danger spots. Those
were the spots where serious accidents
could occur. But what about so*
called minor spots?
Every corner, stairs, railing, and

MILWAUKEE TEMPLE OF MUSIC.
While Sydney musicians and music-lovers are
forced to put up with inadequate, improvised
“sound shells,” year in and year out, owing
to lack of initiative on the part of the City
Council, overseas cities are catering in every
way possible for outdoor musical performances.
Our photo is an excellent illustration of how
architectural concrete has been adapted to the
clean-cut modern design of the impressive
Temple of Music in Milwaukee (Wisconsin).
Architectural concrete produces beautiful and
enduring structures of any size, style or design
when the simple and time-tested principles of
quality concrete construction are followed.
When the Editor of this journal was in
America forty years ago staying at The Con-
gress Hotel on the Lake Shore, facing which
and along its entire shore front is an area
laid out as a park, a shell was there in
front of which 5000 seats were brought out
at 5 p.m. so that people could enjoy the
music provided. The seats were all cleared
away by the morning. There was no charge
made upon the music-loving public who oc-
cupied the seats once a week. Our civic
authorities may well learn a lesson from this,
and present Sydney with a Temple of Music
of equal architectural beauty.

who together produce the nations’
finest buildings. Where beauty must
be matched with perfect functioning,
the choice is naturally National.

exposed machine parts were painted
according to the advice of Mr. R.
H. Primm, the plant’s manager.
Throughout the mill, wide focal
orange strips were painted on posts
and corners. Electric switch boxes
got coats of orange paint. Wide
orange strips on columns indicated
motor switches, while narrow orange
strips indicated light switches. Back'
ground areas, such as where fire ex'
tinguishers hang, were painted a vivid

of focal yellow. Step edges, guards
for machinery and equipment, the
elevator edges and guards, and other
spots likely to be “caution” areas re'
ceived coats of bright yellow paint.
As an extra safety precaution, the
mill fabricated in its own shop a num'
ber of metal guards to place around
the end of drive shafts. These, too,
were painted bright yellow. Caution'
consciousness is evident throughout
the mill. Mr. Primm says, a lot of
skinned shins and bumps have been
prevented by the generous use of
paint, and employee efficiency has
been raised.
This is one example how individual
management can use paints and colours
in its own right and to its own taste.
It is preferable to follow the advice
-of Colour Codes since they have been
worked out by reliable colour experts.
The main thing, however, is to call
attention to dangerous spots through
use of colours and it is only of
secondary importance w'hich colour
scheme you will follow.
Competitive
Housing
MARKET BACK IN U.S.A.
With the ending of Regulation X
in September last, free enterprise has
again taken the place of government
controls in home-buying credit.
This is interpreted by experts as a
prelude to a new attempt at reviving
the traditional law of supply and de-
mand.
It could also mean the return of
a competitive housing market in 195 3
with the promise of prices and pro-
duction, sales and services in homes
depending more upon a “free com-
promise” between what it costs the
builder and what the purchaser can
afford to pay.
No Decline in Demand.
According to home-building authori-
ties, the ending of rigid controls on
home-buying credit could result in the
unprecedented building of 1,500,000
new homes in 1953.
Some officials have even gone as far
as to predict that home-owning de-
mands are potentially great, promising
perhaps the biggest home - building
year in America’s history in 1953.
There has been no decline in hous-
ing demands during 1952, and with
2,500,000 new persons coming to the
U.S.A. annually, based on the birth
rate and count of immigrants, and
with obsolescence, fire losses, demo-
litions for road building and commer-
cial expansion, there appears little
chance of catching up with the normal
housing rating of 7% for many years.
New Tanganyika Tobacco Factory
HANDLES 2000 TONS A SEASON.
A new tobacco processing factory
has recently been completed in the
Songea district of Tanganyika. It is
capable of handling 2000 tons of leaf
every season.
The factory ’<= the latest develop-
ment in a peasant farmers' industry
that has grown since 1930 from an
annual crop of 830 Kgs to 1,185,000
Kgs. (approximately 1166 tons).
African growers market their to'
bacco leaf through a co-operative
marketing union, which today has 17
primary co-op. societies affiliated to it,
with a total membership of some
14,000 growers.
SYMPTOMATIC OF ITS PURPOSE.
The new Administration and Receiving Build-
ings for the State Hospital at Hastings, Minne-
sota, have recently been completed and we
illustrate the entrance to the former. It is
cynically suggested that it looks as unbalanc-
ed as the poor inmates who pass through
its portals. The feeling of scale and the
inter-relation of adjacent masses which in the
past were the guiding principles in archi-
tectural design appear to be a thing of the
past and the desire today is to shock by the
unusual and unorthodox.

After curing the tobacco is tied into bundles or “hands” of approximately 14 leaves. It is
then ready to be delivered to the growers local co-operative society. Here the peasants are
arriving at their Society with the tobacco carried in large reed baskets.

HOUSING IN QUEENSLAND
ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROBLEMS.
Report of Queensland Housing Commission.
The Annual Report of the Queens-
land Housing Commission for the
year ending 30th June, 1952, which
is iust to hand records achievements
ind problems. Under the former
heading is the fact that for the twelve
months period under review a record
number of 2,062 houses were com'
pleted against 1,219 in the previous
pear; total built since 1944'45 is
7.429. At the end of June, 1952,
here were in addition 2119 under
onstruction and 2436 approved to
ommence.
Imported Houses.
The report records that in Janu'
iry, 1950, tenders were called through'
mt the world for the supply and erec'
ion of houses to the Commission’s
jwn designs. Before this action was
aken submissions from some 200 firms
rom Britain, Scandinavia and the Con'
nnent were carefully examined but as
nearly all were for more or less as'
embly line uniform “box'like struc-
ures they were rejected and Queens-
and was the first of the States to in-
ast that houses for Queensland be
manufactured similar to the designs as
ocally constructed.
Contracts have been signed for
1516 timber houses. From France
[886); Sweden (630) and Italy
[1000), and it is claimed in the report
hat these houses are more attractive
han those imported by the Com-
monwealth and acquired at better
nrices than those by either the Com-
monwealth or any other State.
Hie Zillmere Project.
Queensland was the first State to
rnter into contracts for the supply
ind erection of large groups of im-
sorted houses and Zillmere was the
irst project covering 886 houses.
As a pioneering venture difficulties
were expected and did arise, the most
serious being that the quality of the
vork performed by workmen of many
sationalities who were not as compel'
ent as Australian tradesmen and the
necessity to instruct them in their work
and issue directions through interpre-
ters. The report states that the labour
recruited from overseas was supposed
to have been screened by the Com'
monwealth Migration Department and
that all men to be engaged upon the
work were to be financial members
of the union covering their particular
craft. It is contended that had this
been properly carried out the greater
part of the troubles that have oc-
curred on this project would have
been avoided and much of the correc'
tive work necessary would have been
obviated.
The contract document provides for
the completion of each house "as evi-
denced by the final certificate of the
“Commisioner.” The Report says
that a final certificate has not
been issued in respect of any of
these houses because correction work
has yet to be carried out at the
contractors' expense.
During 1951'52, 1048 houses were
built through or purchased from the
Commission, compared with 726 for
1950'5 1; rents charged ranged from
8/' to £3/4/0 a week, the average
figure being £2/2/3.
A considerable improvement in the
supply of building materials occurred
during the period.
GOVERNMENT & INDUSTRY.
8.H.P., 1.C.1., A.C.1., and all the
big companies would never have
grown to be of national help to the
Government, if they had been stunt'
ed, restricted and hampered in their
growing stages by the Government
as all industries are now restricted,
hampered, stunted or strangled alto'
gether.
The big industries came forward
by government protection.
PLASTIC PIPES FOR WATER
SUPPLY.
Investigation in Adelaide.
Transparent, plastic pipes of per'
spex ' like texture are being investi'
gated by South Australian water sup'
ply experts for possible use in spray
irrigation of orchards and also for con'
necting water supply to homes. These
pipes are made only in small sizes of
up to a few inches in diameter.
Corrosion Resistant.
Resistance to corrosion is the great
advantage claimed for the light, easy'
tO'join plastic pipes, which are com'
parable in cost with galvanised iron.
It is also claimed that they will last
twice as long as galvanised iron pipes,
which last only about six years in
some South Australian irrigation areas.
It is claimed that the plastic pipes
resist both external corrosion, due to
soil salt and dampness, and internal
corrosion.
Absence of internal corrosion means
that the smooth pipes retain their full
water'Carrying capacity.
Butyrate materials, imported from
America, are being used in some of
the transparent plastic pipes already
being made on a small scale in Vic'
toria.
HOW MUCH IS A TREE
WORTH?
$8500 For One Walnut Log.
How much is a tree worth? If its
end use is newspaper pulp, not much.
If its function is the sheltering of a
homestead, the owner may contend
that it is priceless, and he will en'
counter little argument. For a tree
that can be spared for crop disposal,
commerce will decide on its value as
a raw material for lumber or fire'
wood. Not many trees will bring
the cash return reported for a noble
American walnut recently cut in the
Blue Grass region of Kentucky. Its
trunk measured 36' in diameter. For
one log of this, 10' 6" in length, a
plywood company paid the owner
$B5OO (£A3800). The sheer cut
17,000 square feet of clear veneer
from it, worth nearly a dollar per
pound.

Kitchens Back In
Popularity In U.S.
In the U.S.A. there are now many
signs of a return to the good old days
when a family’s existence revolved
about the kitchen.
The kitchen is becoming a second
living room, as well as a place to
cook, cat, and view the television.
Home-planning experts consider
that the new gay, pleasant rooms are
evidence of the housewives’ reactions
to the small white "laboratory-type"
kitchen so popular of a few years ago.
AJso, they believe that today’s
American kitchens are indicative of
the family's increasing desire to spend
more time with “Mom” in her new
domain of automatic dishwashers, elec-
tric garbage deposits, clothes washers,
electronic cookers, and television.
Importantly, one influencing factor
is the increased cost of construction
for, with space at a premium, it is
natural that kitchens should do double
—and triple—duty.
Great Possibilities.
Rooms shown at the National
Home Furnishings Show in New
York last September demonstrated the
great possibilities in kitchens as liv'
inti rooms.
These kitchens were planned to en-
sure economy of motion while prepar'
ing meals and performing the attend'
ant duties. Equipment such as dish'
washers, freezers, laundry plant, and
cabinets were placed in exactly the
right position to save steps.
But to emphasise the fact that the
kitchen is no longer just a work area,
there was also space for dining, T.V.
sets, reading nooks, facilities for en-
tertaining guests, children’s play, and
family hobbies.
The kitchens were more decorative,
with brilliant flooring, mellow'finished
furniture, provinciabpatern wallpapers,
and gay curtains.
“Half-a-House”.
Architectural changes, such as the
popular “open'plan”, have produced
other innovations. One home-maga'
zine presented its “half-a-house” kitcfv
en, which actually combines living,
recreation, cooking, dining, and laun-
dry functions of the household. An
overnight guest can be accommodat-
ed in the kitchen on a couch which
also serves as a bed.
The half-a-house room was built in
a space 23 by 25 feet, with all areas
constructed around a central fireplace
core that houses gas range, storage
cabinets, ironer, T.V. set, and fire'
wood compartment. About one-quart-
er of the room was devoted to the
“living” area, including day and
night couch, lounge chairs, and the
T.V. set. Colours used were white,
brick red, soft blue, and terracotta.
Five Kitchens.
Another home-magazine featured
five “do things” kitchens. One was
called the “growing kitchen” since it
permits the addition of luxury items
as finance allows. Red and pink were
carried out in its checkered floor,
gingham curtains, and table tops.
The “hobby kitchen” had a nook
for every avocation from dress-making
to handicrafts.
The “lived-in” kitchen with its
maple furniture, copper utensils and
bright curtains offered both comfort
and colour, while the “colour
kitchen” had yellow cabinets, counter
tops in red, and plastic floor tiles in
red and white stripes.
Half a ton of flint chippings were
recently rushed from Suffolk to Wind'
sor Castle to replace flints which sou
venir'hunting tourists had picked
from between the castle stones.

DINING WITH DIGNITY
THE “FIVE FLIES,” AMSTERDAM.
In 14 years of hard work, Nicholas
Kroese has become an inseparable part
of Amsterdam. Nicholas, as all Am'
sterdammers know him, has specialised
in buying or renting old houses in the
historical Quarters of the city, reno'
vating and refurnishing them with
tables, stools, beautiful “Delfts Blue,’
old Dutch copper and other products
of 17'century Dutch handicraft and
making them into restaurants.
He does not call these places “res'
taurants,” however; he uses the old
Dutch word “Eethusysje," or eating'
place.
ine names, too, are cleverly chosen:
The Five Flies, Mother Benelux, Black
Sheep, Mother Hendrina, Ye Olde
Cellar, the Lions'Borough.
All these houses date back from
1627, 1642, 1660 and 1687, and
Kroese has transformed them all into
delightful eating'places with the old
Dutch atmosphere recaptured for
modern diners.
Five Flies.
His first eating'place (see photo)
was built in 1627 by Jan Janszoon
Vijff Vlyghen (Five Flics), and thus
he called it “The Five Flies, with
his signboard showing a rum'cask with
five flies around it.
Other places were opened in quick
succession, until tO'day his guest book
has already grown to over twenty
volumes. Famous people from all
over the world, including Winston
Churchill, have laughed at wine'
card, called the “washing'list,” over
four feet long.
Last year Kroese received 25,000
Christmas cards from the U.S.A.,
Britain, South Africa, Australia, and
many other countries —an eloquent
tribute to a man who has raised the
art of dining to a new dignity.
The recent arrival of a copy of the
Magna Carta, or “Charter of English
Liberty,” in Australia, reminds his'
torians that King John did not sign
this document; his Seal was affixed
in the Chancery. It is extremely
doubtful whether he could write, for
neither writing nor signature of his
has been left to posterity.
Olympic Pool Design
Result of Architectural Competition
Announced.
The result of the Architectural Com-
petition conducted for the design of
the Olympic Pool for the 1956 Meh
bourne Games was announced just
before Christmas. As with the Stadium
competition the winning design went
to Melbourne, to a group of four
young architects: Mr. and Mrs. John
Murphy, Peter Mclntyre and Kevin
Borland.
Stephenson G? Turner and George
Molnar, of Sydney, and Mussen,
McKay and Potter, of Melbourne,
were awarded premiums of <£4oo each.
The Pool, which is to be construct'
ed in Fawkner Park, South Yarra, will
accommodate 6014 persons; the pool
is 50 metres by 20 metres and the.
building 340 ft. long, 220 ft. wide and
60ft. high. A false end, which can
be taken out after the Games, will
enable the pool to be slightly increased
in length to comply with Australian
swimming distances.
Estimated cost is £350,000, includ'
ing £60,000 for heating, ventilating
and water purification.
In this old-fashioned, step-gabled Dutch house, Nicholas Kroese
started his eating-place 14 years ago. His “Five Flics” is now a
curiosity, which no visitor to Amsterdam fails to see.

At the
PLANNING
STAGE
is the time to call in
OTIS
The building and its function must deter-
mine the type and design of vertical
transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Otis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators —because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in

The Fireplace
In History
As Old As Civilisation.
Since time immemorral, the hearth'
stone has been the focal point of all
family life, and the storv of the evolu'
tion of the fireplace, told briefly here,
is a fascinating one.
As long ago as 1500 8.C., north
British housewives, returning from
their shell-fishing on a bleak winter
night, would duck through the low
entrance of their stone huts and rush
to warm their hands over a fire.
Not much different tO'day, perhaps,
except that the fire was burning in
a saucer ' shaped depression in the
centre of the earth floor and was con-
stantly replenished with easily'gathcred
peat.
Gradually, from that primitive fire'
place, there evolved through the ages
a centre hearth.
At Glastonbury*, near Wells,
Somerset. England, over a thousand
years later, a lake village was built
over flooded ground, the houses stand-
ing on horizontal logs with wattle
sides, reed roofs, and trodden clay
floors. These had, each, their central
hearth.
The family could assemble in a
complete circle round the fire, no heat
was lost, and they could eat straight
out of the cooking pot.
When, a few years later, the
Romans occupied Britain, they intro'
duced central heating.
Underneath the pavements of their
floors they laid shallow culverts, along
which they passed heated air.
All-purpose Fires.
When the Saxons arrived they
sacked the Roman-British cities and
erected their houses in open country
where they could farm. These houses
consisted of a large hall like a glorified
aisled barn, again with a central fire
which was used for all purposes.
Every family required a hearth for
cooking or for warmth, and it was,
even in those distant days, an obvious
object for taxation!
About this time the hearth'penny
or smokc'nenny was levied as a con'
tribution to the Pope to signify sub'
jection to papal supremacy. It was,
for this reason, also called Peter’s
Pence.
Walled Fireplaces.
With the coming of the Normans,
historians find the first suggestion of
walled fireplaces.
A wide fireplace, built in the out'
side wall, had what may be called a
flue, but was, in reality, an escape for
the smoke.
Instead of going up above the level
of the roof, as a chimney stack, it was
earned at an angle through the wall
and emerged into the open.
At first the narrow windows had
no glass, and the shutters were open'
ed during the day, necessitating the
use of stone hoods built out over the
fireplace to control the draught.
As time went on, small rooms were
added to houses, but the great halls
remained a feature of the big houses
until Elizabethan days.
By the 18th Century the great halls
had gone, and now families gathered
round a more intimate hearth.
However, discoveries of the 19th
Century introduced gas and later elec'
tricity as means of heating homes,
which, with the steam radiators and
central heating, seems to have spelt
the doom of the long'cherished family
hearth.
* Glastonbury is a borough near
Wells, Somerset, England. It is noted
for an old abbey with a legend of
thorn planted by Joseph of Arimathea.
It is also adjacent to Avalon, the
burial island of King Arthur.

Picking the Colour that Sells
New Emphasis on Colourful Paints.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER,
Our New York Correspondent.
The mass market buyer to'day
thinks a lot more about colour than
he or she did ten years ago. The
sales figures of the paint industry, as
published by “Business Week.” alone
shpw that.
In 1941, ivory, cream and buff
accounted for roughly 65 per cent, of
paint industry sales. To'day they
make up only about 17 per cent, of
the volume.
Green has climbed from 5 per cent,
of sales to 25 per cent.; blue from
5 per cent, to 16 per cent.; grey and
rose from 5 per cent, to 11 per cent.
Last year ,out of the 112 paints in
one company’s line, the top five sellers
were grey, chartreuse, turquoise, brown
and dark green.
More Colours in Automobiles
and Housewares.
In automobiles, too, there is more
demand for colour, according to these
statistical figures. In 1941, black cars
made up 26 per cent, of the total
sales of one typical manufacturer. By
last year, black had skidded to 10 per
cent, of total industry sales; while blue,
grey and green made up better than
75 per cent, of volume. Light blue
and green alone made up 32 per cent,
of last year’s sales.
Furniture is shifting from char'
treuse. red, yellow and green toward
more blue. Women’s wear, long a
colour stronghold, show trend to
beige and yellow-greens.
In kitchen housewares, the
favourites of ten years ago were white,
black, red, and green. Last year, the
sales of one fairly higlvquality line
showed nearly 63 per cent, of volume
in pastel yellow', pastel blue, pastel
green, and pastel pink. A nation'
wide survey of homeowners found 36
per cent, of the people questioned
wanted refrigerators and other kitchen
appliances in colour.
Colour choice has become less an
artistic satisfaction for the manufac'
turer and more a process of giving
the consumer what he wants. Many
companies do this research themselves,
others consult the colour experts, of
whom the best known are Faber Birren
and How'ard Ketcham.
Of room paints light colours are
preferred, but w'hite and cream make
up only 17 per cent. The mass mar'
ket, we are told by colour experts,
seems to prefer a limited range of
colours. In a line of 1000 interior
finishes, the top twenty colours w'ere
all greens, greys, reds, pinks and yeb
lows. The proper colour may be im'
portant enough for the mass market
buyer to overrise quality in price in
picking the product wanted.
New emphasis on colour to'day has
become a major factor in store design.
Different departments are demarked
by contrasting colours, each appro'
priate to the merchandise sold and the
colour pattern throughout is planned
to set up a unifying theme for the
store as a whole.
Repainting Salesroom
Stimulates Sales.
A prominent Chicago meat packer
remodelled his salesroom, painting the
walls yellow and putting yellow saw'
dust on the floor. The red meat hung
around the walls—it was supposed to
be an effective colour contrast.
However, sales got fewer from week
to week, although prices, quality and
other market conditions were the same
as before. H. S. Kahm, who tells the
story, says that it took a colour con'
sultant to figure out the trouble. A
technical condition of the human eye,
called “afterimage,” was harmful to
the remodelled salesroom. Customers
looked at the red meat after exposing
their eyes to the yellow walls or floor,
and the resultant blue afterimage
caused the meat to appear sicklish and
stale.
The colour consultant made several
suggestions, and after the colour of
the walls was changed to green a
complementary colour to red and
the sawdust on the floor was dyed
green, the red meat looked even more
red and alluring than usual. Sales
went up. Red is the afterimage of
green ,and the red afterimage applied
to the red meat made it appear red'
der, fresher, and more tempting.
The manufacturer who picks appro'
priate colours for his product will
usually find his goods continuing to
sell, other factors being equal. The
one who picks wrong colours may find
an inexplicable decline of his sales
curve.
The lundvroom of a big mid'
western factory was redecorated in a
light blue. The employees began to
complain that it was chilly and women
employees went so far as to wear their
coats to lunch.
The heating engineer knew that the
room temperature was a steady 72 de'
grees, the same as before, since the
temperature was thermostatically con'
trolled. He recommended that the
walls be painted orange and that
orange slip covers be placed on the
chairs. There were no more com'
plaints about the chilly room. Actual'

BUILDING ON OIL.
The independent Arabian State of Kuwait, near the head of the Persian Gulf, has prospered
immensely since its ruler the Sheikh A1 Salim A1 Subah has encouraged the exploitation of its
cil resources by overseas interests. Much of the oil royalties is being expended on public
amenities. A £2,000,000 contract has been let to a British firm, John Howard 8C Co. for the
construction of a technical college at Kuwait, which is planned to be the centre of engineering
studies for the Arabic-speaking Middle East. These buildings will include the main block,
laboratories, class rooms, workshops, library, and also accommodation for 750 resident
students. There will also be a swimming pool and 220 acres of playing fields.

ly, there was no change whatever in

Chain restaurants operators have
discovered that orange walls back of

his sales of salads 25 per cent, simply

Colour Speeds Up
T umover.
Longchamps Restaurants in New
York adopted their striking red'and'
yellow colour scheme on the advice of
a colour consultant. The restaurants
originally were decorated in a chaste
grey'green, but patrons were inclined
to linger too long in these pleasantly
soothing surroundings. When the
colour of the interior decoration was
brightly changed, customer turnover
speeded up and business increased as
much as 50 per cent, at a downtown
branch.
Colours of the uniforms of wait'
resses should also reflect warm,
“edible” colours. They are designed
to blend into the general colour pro'
gramme for the interior of the res'
taurant.
Preference of colours appear to be
influenced by physical and economic
factors where you live, how much
you earn, your age, the climate. New
Englanders generally prefer quiet,
somewhat “puritane” colours. People
in California tend to like light pastel
tints.
Guests in hotel and restaurants
should be satisfied with colours they
will normally like best or which will
establish an appropriate mood. Cor'
ridors and stairways in ivory or soft
yellow are sunny, bright and active
in stimulation. Due to the inherent
likes of most men and women, blue

CHURCH OR WIGWAM?
It s a bit of a poser to make up one’s mind whether the upper example (interior and exterior)
is and Indian wigwam or tepee, or as we are informed, a community church of Portland’s
Cedar Mills. U.S.A. It is of particular interest, however, in that apart from their unorthodox
design, both this and the lower church employ built-up laminated timber trusses in their con-
struction. The thin cross on the large plain window that forms the background to the altar
in the lower example is far away from the stained glass glories of Gothic architecture.

is the preferred colour for men’s
facilities, soft rose for women’s. In
cafeterias, peach is the ideal colour,
being considered the most attractive
of all light hues by the average person.
The subconscious influence of
colours is obvious from an experience
described by James Lambert, superin'
tendent of the botanic gardens of the
University of Pennsylvania. He told
of a resort hotel to which business'
men went for weekends to get away
from the worries of every'day life.
The hotel management began to feel
a gradual lessening in business, but
for some time nobody could find out
the reason.
What had happened was that a new
flower garden had been laid out. Red
was the predominant colour of the
flowers. The red flowers were re'
moved and the hotel garden redesigned
in blue and white flowers. Gradually
the businessmen returned as guests,
Mr. Lambert stated that even he,
familiar with flowers, had been violent'
ly irritated after an hour on the hotel
verandah gazing at the red flowers,
Gazing at the subsequent white and
blue flowers, however, gave him men'
tal peace and relaxation hard to define.
I Am Glass
The Christmas Greeting Card of
the Directors and Staff of Sydney
Glass Pty. Ltd. used George Over'
myer’s story of glass from “The
Miracle Maker”:
I am created of the admixture of
Earth’s minerals, formed by the
alchemy of time
I am born transformed in the blast'
ing heat of fiery furnace
In molten mass I am tediously fash'
ioned by the hand of cunning Ar'
tisan —or fed into the maw of in'
tricate machine
I assume ten thousand hues of all
the spectrum —either transparent,
translucent or opaque—upon my
maker’s will
I can masquerade as ruby'emerald'
and all the other
priceless jewels of man
But frivolous baubles are not my as'
piration—l serve ten million pur'
poses in as many different places,
forms and ways
My duties are unnumbered —-infinite;
pay heed to my utility;
I admit the Heavenly light to hovel,
palace or cathedral, and yet repel
cold winter’s howling breath
I faithfully project the light that warns
great ships from shoal and concern
trate the beams that guide swift veh'
icle through storm and gloom of
night to bring the wayfarer safely
home
I visibly contain my master's food —
his drink —and countless other of
his commodities; protecting them
in transport and in the mart and
home
I form the shell of glowing bulb and
tube to diffuse his artificial light—-
and to disseminate his advertising
I am the walls of his abode, his of'
fice and his factory—and objects of
utility and art in each of these
I reflect his image—and mark the ef'
fects of time upon his person—
sometimes I flatter but more often
am critically severe
I correct his impaired sight and thus
bestow enjoyment of the printed
word —and all of Nature's beauties
roundabout
I magnify his minute, unseen enemies
and thereby do I promote his health
and happiness
I form the gossamer thread from
which is fashioned fine raiment —-
yet too the insulation of his dweb
ling
I reveal to him the mysteries of his
Universe —-carrying his vision to the
illimitable reaches of the outer stars
Through me he learned to chart the
Firmament- —-to plot the orbits of
the Planets and predict the courses
of the Comets and Eclipses

THE “NEW LOOK” IN HOUSES.
If the author of “Home, Sweet Home” were to start revising the words of his famous song,
he would have to drastically change the picture of the “roses around the door” to “limitless
glass and no internal walls,” if these two illustrations of recent American houses arc any
criterion. That on the left shows the interior of a house at San Pedro, California, where the
internal walls consist of movable screens—on the Japanese principle, excepting that the latter
are temporarily fixed, whereas the above screen is just adjustable. The building on the right
is a house at Cincinatti, Ohio, built on a ste[?]te to gain an extensive view.

Multiple Injury
Causes
The following extract from the cur'
rent Accident Prevention Bulletin
(Dec., 1952), may prove of interest
(and a warning) to Master Builders
and their employees. The injuries set
out in the report could be duplicat'
cd in any joinery shop or on any
building job.
The injury report said: “Stepped
on a projecting nail. Did not report
for first aid for two days, resulting
in bad infection.” It sounded like a
fairly simple matter, but careful in'
vestigation showed that the injured
employee was carrying a tray on his
shoulder when he stepped on a nad
in a small piece of board lying db
reedy in his path. The rest of the
story follows:
1. The board was part of a crate.
2. The contents of the crate had
been unpacked at a proper place but
the piece in question had dropped un-
noticed from a truck loaded with sim'
ilar pieces which were being moved
away for proper disposal.
3. The truck had been piled too
high, and was not intended for such
duty, and was pulled along when it
should have been pushed.
4. The board fell at a point where
the aisle was congested with castings
to be surfaced on a nearby machine.
5. The castings threw a shadow
across the aisle at this particular point.
6. The nature of the load carried
by the injured man prevented his
seeing where he stepped. He did not
see the board.
7. The soles of his shoes were
worn through.
8. He did not report the injury for
two days, by which time the wound
had become infected.
The conclusions reached by the in'
vestigators indicated:
(a) The wrong type of truck was
used.
(b) There was both bad loading
and wrong handling of the
truck.
(c) The aisle was congested.
(d) There was not sufficient ilium'
ination.
(e) The load prevented clear vis'
ion. The investigation disclos'
ed, further, that the trays
should have been trucked and
not carried.
(f) The man’s footwear was in'
adequate for the job, and
(g) There was his failure to report
the injurv promptly for first
aid. This latter affected the
severity in the case but had
no bearing on the cause of the
injurv in the first place.
This is what might be called a
“peach of a story” for any Plant
Safety Committee to consider.
Building Progress
Bendigo Figures.
Statistics of building permits in
Bendigo during 1952 disclose a large
increase in the number of permits is'
sued for business premises and factor'
ies, but a fall in permits for housing.
The number of permits for bush
ness premises and factories was more
than double those of 1951 —57, as
compared with 25 —while the valua'
tion rose sharply from £22,487 to
£259,032.
However, an analysis of the figures
showed that practically the whole of
the increase in the value of factory
permits was the inclusion of a major
project—the new wing of the Bene'
volents’ Home, valued at £22,000.
The figures showed that in 1952
there was 28 fewer permits for homes
and a drop of 39 in permits for alter'
ations to flats and dwellings.

Goodyear To
Operate Huge
Atomic Plant
New Gaseous Diffusion Plant
to Produce Uranium-235.
. _
A momentous announcement with
far-reaching implications for Good-
year was made recently by the Atomic
Energy Commission in Washington,
U.S.A., said Mr. H. C. Steiner, Vice
chairman and Manaeine Director,
Goodyear Tyre 6? Rubber Co. (Aust.)
Ltd., when it was announced that
Goodyear has been selected to operate
a huge new Gaseous Diffusion plant
in Southern Ohio, to produce Uran-
fum-235 for the American Govern-
ment.
Estimated cost of the huge new
plant is iA547,250,000; it is sched-
uled for completion in about four
years, and Goodyear, the principal
employer, will use a permanent work-
ing force of some 4,000 persons.
Goodyear will put individual units
of the Uranium-235 production plant
into operation as they are completed,
and its officials will work closely with
the Union Carbide and Carbon Corp.,
operating contractor for the Gaseous
Diffusion plants at Oak Ridge and
Paducah, U.S.A., which company also
will assist in the training of key per'
sonnel employed by Goodyear.
Mr. E. J. Thomas, Goodyear Presi'
dent, in making the announcement,
emphasised strongly the necessity for
America to continue with the applica'
tion of atomic energy for weapons
of war, in order that world leadership
in this field can be maintained and
used as a force to make future wars
improbable. “Of special importance,”
he said, “was the application of atomic
energy to peaceful use in the inter'
ests of mankind.” He pointed out
that already developments are under
way, leading to utilisation of atomic
energy in power plants and transport'
ation, and further, that medical and
industrial uses are here.
The new power plant to be built will
be the largest of its kind in the world.
The purpose of the plant is to pro'
duce the concentrated U'235 Isotope
of Uranium, which is both fissionable
and radioactive.
The factors of safety embodied in a
modern Gaseous Diffusion plant are
so great, that danger to the operating
personnel is less than in an ordinary
chemical plant.
Mr. Thomas said: “We feel that
it is a good thing for an organisation
to accept such a challenge.”
The history of the Goodyear Tyre
6? Rubber Company is full of instances
of the acceptance of such challenges,
and the meeting of such responsibili'
ties not only in the development of
the rubber business itself, but in the
part played by the company in the
creation of the Synthetic Rubber in'
dustry, in its substantial entry into
the aircraft industry, and in accepting
the assignment during the last war,
to operate a Powder Bagging Works
for the Government in Indiana, and
in the manufacture of shells and guns.
In rubber manufacturing, Goodyear
has built and manned plants in many
parts of the U.S., and in fourteen
countries overseas, including the
tralian factory at Granville, N.S.W.
200,000 MILES ENDURANCE
RUN.
Travelling the equivalent of over
four times round the world, one of
the British Army’s new combat veh'
icle engines, the four cylinder “8.40,”
has just completed the first half of a
200,000 miles run to test its endur'
ance under service conditions. After
a complete strip down for test pur*
poses no defects were found other
than one broken compression ring.

“THE PRUDENTIAL”
AT LOS ANGELES.
If one were to judge Los Angeles by the
improvidence that would seem to be the out-
standing characteristic of some of its inhabi-
ants —or to be more precise, of those adjacent
to Hollywood—one would perhaps be sur-
prised to see a fine new structure like that
that has been erected for the famous “Pru-
dential” organisation. An attractive feature
is the roof garden at first floor level and the
continuous horizontal metal louvres that pro-
ject like balconies to screen the rows of win-
dows on the sunny side and which impart
the main character to an otherwise very simple
design. Architects were Welton Becket SC
Associates. The sign “Prudential” on the
plain projecting wall is pronounced enough
so that “all who runs may read” and yet,
being in scale, it is not aggressive.

The 1952 total was nearly double
that of 1949—£26.123,249.
The figures showed the effect of
inflationary cost increases, the report
added.
In 1946, 7460 buildings cost
£9,616,446.
By 1950, the number of buildings
completed had nearly doubled to
13,937, but the cost amounted to
£31,383,457 —more than three times
the 1946 figure.
The 1952 cost was more than five
times the 1946 total, but the number
of buildings completed in 1952
(16.441) had risen only about 2\
times.
The Capital Value
Of A Birch Broom
Making “Softies” of Men.
In the Domain underneath the big
fig trees three men are engaged at
regular intervals sweeping up the
mess, that proverbially “dirty” fig
trees make, with birch brooms. The
capacity for sweeping up by these
gadgetS'of-other'days may be describ'
ed as “a few inches at a time” at an
expenditure of much energy, as each
man sweeps over the same ground—
over and over the same ground— to
dislodge the leaves, figs and other deb'
ris. The make of these brooms by
one of the Council’s men at say 7A an
hour would be its real value, if it took
just one hour to make, or 21/' if the
cost of gathering the raw material,
carting it, assembling it and tying it
around its broom handle ran into 3
hours. But in the hands of three
men “toying” with such a thing at
say 7/' an hour on a 40-hour week,
would be £l4 x 3 = £42 a week in
wages or £2,184 a year, when pos'
sibly one man with a sizeable broom
at say £lO initial expenditure could
do the same quantity of work with
less exertion. The result of this would
equal 1 man at £l4 = £728 + £lO
for a good broom = £738, thus ef'
fecting a real saving of £1,446 in
ratepayers’ money each year.
But speaking of brooms, everyone
in the world would laugh to know
that when a large sized broom is used
on the railways two men have to push
it. In the days before we “coddled”
men and made “softies of them” it
took a man'sized man to push these
self'same man-sized brooms on rail'
way stations.

SYDNEY OF THE FUTURE
CITY COUNCIL'S DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
Zoning For Central City Area.
What will Sydney look like fifty years from now? The City
Council of Australia’s largest city knows the answer, for the plan
for the future was presented to the public late last year, but
whether it will be acted upon this year is in the lap of the gods.
Changes and additions to the Cum-
berland County Council’s master plan
for Sydney are contained in the City
Council’s scheme under which it pro-
poses to control the future develop-
ment of Sydney.
Maps and details of the new plan
are now on view at the Town Hall
for inspection of the public until
February 3, 1953. and these include
many radical changes.
Civic Centre.
The City Council envisages a large
civic centre to be built around the
upper end of Hyde Park.
The whole of the area bounded by
Liverpool Street, Wentworth Avenue,
Goulburn Street, and Elizabeth Street,
will be used for this purpose, with
also a complete block in Elizabeth
Street, between Liverpool and Bath-
urst Streets, another complete block
in College Street, bounded by College
Street, and an extension of Hargrave
Street, and a third, smaller block on
the corner of Oxford Street and
Wentworth Avenue.
The City Council plans to resume
all this land eventually for the civic
centre. •
The civic centre will consist of four
large buildings.
Development Plan.
The City Council has adopted this
scheme in principle. After public
objections have been considered the
plan will go before the State Par-
liament for ratification.
Early wholesale resumptions and
demolitions are not proposed, but
when the plan becomes effective any
new building projects will have to
conform with it.
Under the plan, the central city
area is zoned into business and shop-
ping areas.
The main business centre is defin-
ed as being within the area from
Dawes Point to Martin Place and
from Macquarie Street to the eastern
side of Kent Street.
The city shopping centre is defined
in an area from Martin Place to Cen-
tral Railway, bounded by Elizabeth
Street, the eastern side of Kent Street,
and both sides of upper George
Street.
Residential Area.
Almost the entire area from Wool-
loomooloo across William Street to
Oxford Street has been defined for
residential use.
The only minor exception is a small
area bounded by William, Boomer-
ang, Haig and Riley Streets. In that
block are the Industrial Blind Institute
and the head offices of Australian
Consolidated Industries Ltd.
Industrial Areas.
A further large industrial area is
provided in Surry Hills bordered by
Elizabeth, Riley, Campbell and Hunt'
er Streets. Under the original Cum-
berland scheme this was planned as
a residential area.
The council plans that the Devon-
shire and Riley Streets side of this in-
dustrial area will be surrounded by a
green belt to divide them from the
nearby residential districts.
On the western side of the city the
land from the western side of Kent
Street to the harbour has been defin-
ed as a B class industrial area.
The whole of Pyrmont, excepting
32 blocks for residential purposes, has
also been reserved for industry, as has
most of Ultimo and Chippendale.
The plan permits three industrial
areas to remain in Newtown, one op-
posite the railway, the second off King
Street, and a third in a block bounded
by Newman Street, close to the rail-
way.
In Redfern there has been some
(continued overleaf)
(Top) This will be the New Street Station of the future. When railways have beep electri-
fied, the network of rails, points, etc., will no longer be dominant feature of this area.
As shown by the bottom diagram, they will be hidden beneath airy and useful buildings.

curtailment of the planned living area
under the Cumberland scheme to pro-
vide more industrial space opposite
Prince Alfred Park.
In the Paddington area, which it
is proposed to re-plan as a first-class
residential district, the open space
provided under the Cumberland
scheme has been extended along New
South Head Road to Glenmore Road
to the north.
Parking Areas.
Provision has been made for sur-
face parking areas in most of the in-
ner citv suburbs, but not within the
city proper.
There have been few variations
fro m the overall Cumberland scheme
for development of most of the inner
suburbs. A large parkland will be
provided for Newtown.
New Arterial Road.
In the remaining suburbs in the
City Council’s area, except Alexandria
and Waterloo, which are heavily in-
dustrialised, most of the land is to be
for residential and parkland purposes,
with minor defined areas for factories,
shops, and offices.
A new arterial route is proposed
in addition to those in the Cumber-
land scheme. It is designed to serve
the eastern suburbs.
Commencing at Figtree Avenue in
the Domain, it will follow Cowper
Wharf roadway to a point in line
with Challis Avenue, Potts Point.
From there it goes into a tunnel un-
der Potts Point in line with Challis
Avenue [which scheme Florence
Taylor, Editor of this journal, devis-
ed nearly 20 years ago].
It then follows the foreshores of
Elizabeth Bay, Elizabeth Point, Mac-
leay Point, and the western side of
Rushcuttcr Bay, to turn south along
the Rushcutter Bay stormwater chan-
nel to join with New South Head
Road at Nield Avenue.
Much of the route is over water,
and it is proposed to use the reclaim-
ed land for parks.
Birmingham Plans, Too.
It is interesting, in the light of
Sydney’s revised plans, to learn that
highly industrialised Birmingham,
England, is also making sweeping
plans for its future.
In the past, big towns have, like
Topsy, “just growed”. Now the ad-
vent of Town Planning has brought
their growth under control, and the
development of a town no longer just
happens. It takes place according to
a deliberate design. The plans on
view at the Town Hall show us what
Sydney will look like 50 years from
now —if the development is actually
proceeded with!
In his book “Birmingham—Fifty
Years On”, Paul S. Cadbury describes
what the “Magnet of the Midlands”
will look like in A.D. 2002. The
plans he describes represent, in the
main, schemes already approved by
the City Council. They could well
be an object lesson to our own plan-
ners, for the problems of the two
cities, Birmingham and Sydney, run
strangely parallel.
Birmingham has been growing
faster than the rest of England, and
without planning control this trend
would probably continue. But the
policy of the Government is to spread
industry more evenly throughout the
country, with the result that Birm-
ingham's population is estimated to
be less than today’s figure of
1,100,000.
There will be fewer people—and
fewer factories, according to Mr.
Cadbury. In 1939 there were about
13,000 separate factories in the city,
most of them very small. Already
the pattern is changing, as small units
disappear, and the big units become
larger. In 1938 there were 181 sep-
arate manufacturing jewellers; in
1952 there are only 124. In 1939
there were only 10 factories employ-
ing over 1000 workers; in 1950 there
were 33. This trend will continue.
In some trades groups of factories
will be gathered under one roof.
Plans have already been made for a
new Jewelling Quarter, where many
separate firms will be housed in
BIRMINGHAM’S CIVIC CENTRE.
Heart of the future city: This is what Birmingham’s Civic Centre will look like, with the
Inner Ring Road (right) crossed by a f|y-over. In the middle, the Hall of Memory will
still be standing.
ATOM AGE SHOPPING CENTRE.
An atomic age shopping centre: New Street in Birmingham as it will be. Compare its
ponderous stores with the shops in the photo. Overhanging or cantilevered storeys which leave
the wide footpaths open to the elements in sun or rain gives one furiously to think of our
good fortune in devising the footpath awning.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


flatted factories run on Trading Es-
tate lines. Factories will no longer be
scattered indiscriminately, but will be
confined in Factory Zones, spaced
throughout the city.
Birmingham’s skyline will change
as commercially valuable buildings
will increase in height. But the ap-
pearance of the city will be little
different from the existing large areas
that have been built or rebuilt during
the past 30 years. The houses of
Kingstanding and Weoley Castle will
still be there, with the rest of the
113,600 houses built between the
wars.
Slums To Go.
The slums will disappear, though.
About half the dwellings occupied in
Birmingham today, including all the
back-to-back hovels and terraced
“tunnel-back’’ houses, will be dem-
olished in 50 years, and the people
rehoused.
Five re-development areas in the
centre of the city have been, or are
being, acquired by the Council.
These include the worst of the slums,
in some of which back-to-back houses
are packed at a density of 80 to the
acre.
These will be replaced by flats and
maisonettes with a density of not more
than half this figure, the surplus pop-
ulation being housed in new suburban
estates. In the redevelopment areas
rebuilding will still be at a higher
density than in the suburbs, but the
layout will be less wasteful and the
ground used more economically.
There will be large blocks of flats
with light and space around them.
The Bath Row area (part of present
slum-land) will be rebuilt at a density
of 120 people to the acre, but there
will be 21 acres of space adjoining.
City of Houses.
Birmingham will still be a city of
houses. When it is rebuilt, not more
than 10 per cent, of the population
will live in flats. The majority of
houses will be of the two-storey cot-
tage type, in the ratio of probably
25 to 1. People will change their
dwellings as families grow.
New housing will be developed in
neighbourhoods, each with an indus-
trial area, shops, a community
centre, libraries, churches, etc. Houses
will be more convenient to live in.
Open fires will give way to a system
of district heating, and filament lamps
will be replaced by artificial daylight.
Shopping Areas.
The plan for Birmingham’s central
shopping area will largely free it from
traffic. There will be wider pave-
ments, with arcading to make win-
dow shopping more pleasant on wet
days. Extension will be mainly up-
ward. and there will be buildings of
20, 30, and even 50 storeys.
The ribbon - developed suburban
shopping areas will have disappeared
by 2002. Either the shops will have
been re-sited and re-built away from
the main arterial roads, a new road
will have been built, leaving the sub-
urban shopping area on its present
site, but with all through traffic di-
verted round it.
In the centre of the city there will
be vast car parks, underground or
multi-storey, at the end of each ar-
terial road.
Roads.
Birmingham will have inner, outer
and middle ring roads, and 12 arterial
roads. If the increase of traffic on
the inner ring road is continuous,
road tunnels will be built.
The whole design of the inner ring
road has been modified to give easy
access to both Birmingham’s railway
stations. When the railways are elec-
trified, both New Street and Snow
Hill Stations will go underground.
Then valuable land will be available
for other purposes. New Street sta-
tion covers 11 acres, and much of
this space is earmarked for a great
retail shopping centre.
Parks, Playgrounds.
The city of Birmingham covers
51,000 acres, of which not much
more than half is fully developed.
Future plans reserve nearly 7000
acres for open space, where parks
and public playgrounds will be laid
out.
Building
Operations
In Queensland
September Quarter, 1952.
Operations by the building indus-
try maintained the high level of pre-
vious quarters to the end of Sep-
tember, 1952. There was some indi-
cation of a slight swing from the con-
struction of new dwellings to a greater
amount of work on new buildings for
business • and social purposes.
Total value of new dwellings com-
pleted during the quarter ended Sep-
tember, 1952, was £5,329,000, com-
pared with a quarterly average of
£4,556,000 for 1951, while other new
buildings completed were worth
£922,000, compared with a quarterly
average for 1951 of £579,000.
New Dwellings.
New dwellings completed in
Queensland numbered 2,868, includ-
ing 293 imported pre-fabricated dwel-
lings. Completion of ordinary dwel-
lings numbered 2,575, which was high-
er than the quarterly average for any
post-war year except 1951. Com-
mencements were also high at 2,953
new dwellings, a figure that has only
once been substantially exceeded
(3,434 in September quarter of
1951), and a number of dwellings
under construction at the end of the
quarter rose from 5,177 in June to
5,262 in September.
Employment.
Employment of 20.678 workers in
the building industry showed no mark-
ed change from the level that had
been reached in September, 1951, and
maintained since that date. During
the twelve months, the only significant
changes in the distribution of labour
were an estimated decrease of about
2,000 workers on new dwellings, an
increase of 700 on other new build-
ings, and an increase of about 900 on
alterations and maintenance.
Commencements.
Total dwellings commenced in the
September quarter, 1952, numbered
2,953, including 609 imported pre-
fabricated houses. During the quart-
er, the number of new dwellings com-
menced under government sponorship
by private builders was very high at
1,028, while other commencements by
private builders reached their highest
level for four quarters, numbering
1,219. Owner-builders commenced
639 new houses.
Completions.
Of 2,868 dwellings completed in
the September quarter, 1952, 73 were
built by government day labour, 597
were under government sponsored
schemes, 1,425 others were built by
professional builders, and 773 were
built by owner-builders.
Dwellings.
Dwellings under construction at the
end of September, 1952, numbered
5,262, which was 85 more than three
months earlier. Principal changes
were decreases of 134 in dwellings un-
der construction by owner-builders
and 206 in those being built by pri-
vate builders not under government
sponsorship. Dwellings completed
during September quarter, 1952, in-
cluded 2,836 individual houses, 10
dwellings attached to shops, and 22
flats. The individual houses included
293 imported pre-fabricated houses,
while other houses completed in var-
ious materials were: Timber, 1,954;
fibro-cement, 297; brick, concrete,
etc., 216; and various other wall ma-
terials, 76.
Costs.
The average costs per house in the
September quarter, 1952, were:
Brick, etc., <£2,982; wood, <£1,911;
quarter fibro-cement, <£1,623. The
average brick or concrete dwelling
completed in the September of 1952
cost <£1,739, or 139.9 per cent., more

timber dwelling, had risen by £1,071,
or 127.5 per cent., and the average
fihrO'Cement dwelling by £866, or

Value.
The estimated value of all build-
ing work completed (including new
work finished, and alterations, addi-
tions, repairs, etc.) during September
quarter, 1952, was £7,803,000, com-
pared with £8,508,000 for the pre-
ceding quarter, and a quarterly aver-
age of £7,673,000 for the year 1951-
52. New dwellings completed were
worth £5,329,000, other new build-
ings £922,000, and alterations and
maintenance £1,552,000.
Private Builders.
Private builders had 13,784 men
working for them on 30th September,
1952, including the contractors them-
selves, and sub-contractors and their
employees. Government constructing
authorities had 2,880 employees. It
is estimated that about 850 tradesmen
were employed by persons who were
building their own homes themselves,
and small contractors engaged in re-
pair work, etc., with their employees
numbered 3,164 at 30th June, 1952.
The total number engaged in build-
ing at 30th September, 1952, is esti-
mated at 20,678.

BUILDING FIGURES FOR 1952
16,441 BUILDINGS COST £50,161,548.
Figures covering building opera-
tions for the year ended 31st De-
cember, 1952, compiled by the Met-
ropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drain-
age Board, of building operations
within the area served by the Board’s
watermains, show that the number of
new buildings completed was 14,323
at a cost of £44,396,606, whilst alter-
ations and additions were carried
out to 2,118 existing properties at a
cost of <£5,764,942, a total of 16,441
jobs being completed at a cost of
£50,161,548.
The number of buildings completed
has only been exceeded on one occa-
sion, namely, for the 12 months end-
ed 30th June, 1952, when 17,095 jobs
were completed. It represents an in-
crease of 6% over the previous cor-
responding 12 months figure of
15,540. The cost, however, has reach-
ed a new record surpassing the pre-
vious highest figure of £46,118,991
established for the 12 months ended
30th lune, 1952, The average cost
per building was £3,051 which com-
pares with £2,406, £2,252, and £1,850
for the preceding three years. Thus,
over this period the average cost has
increased by 65%.
Homes Dominate.
The erection of homes continues to
dominate the activities, 14,93 3 having
been erected or altered during the
year, representing 91% of the total
building jobs completed. For the
previous three years the figures un-
der this category were 14,398, 12,895
and 13,233.
The Housing Commission of
N.S.W. has again contributed very
substantially towards the number of
homes erected, 2,420 cottages and 3 3
blocks of flats comprising 373 units
erected by this Authority having
been rated by the Board.
The number of buildings erected
or altered in the city of Sydney was
209 at a cost of £2,766,139, whilst
16,232 were completed in the re-
mainder of the Board’s area for
£47,395,409. During the first half
of the year 8,3 51 jobs were complet-
ed at a cost of £25,414,994, whilst
in the second half 8,090 jobs were
completed for £24,746,554.
The districts in which the greatest
building activity occurred are shown
on page 87.
Speedier Completion of
Construction.
The payment of a building fee is
usually an indication that early com-
mencement of building operations is
contemplated. Despite the fact that
the number of fees paid fell from
21,122 for the 12 months ended 31st
December, 1950, and 20,318 for the
12 months ended 31st December,
1951, to 14,172 for the current 12
months, the number of buildings com'
pleted during the corresponding per'
iods rose from 13,937 to 15,540 to
16,441. This can only be attributed
to the more economic distribution of
available manpower and materials per'
mitting of speedier completion of
work than formerly. Although there
is still a great number of outstanding
fees for which buildings have not

The following schedule will indicate
the number of buildings erected and

the number of buildings erected
should, in the very near future, com'
mence to follow the downward move'
ment evidenced in the payment of
building fees.

Australian Cities
Must Stop Growing
Warning From Atomic Expert.
Australian cities must be limited, as
an atomic defence measure to their
present size, according to Profes-
sor E. W. Titterton, of the Australian
National University, who was Aus-
tralia's chief observer at the recent
Monte Bello atomic bomb test.
Professor Titterton said the test
was significant to Australia because it
showed the effects an atomic explosion
could have in a harbor.
He warned that Australia’s popula-
tion was largely concentrated in cities
close to the sea.
To provide for future expansion
and development, satellite towns must
be built around the large cities, [and
promptly destroy their economy upon
the success of which the nation de-
pends equally as much as on rural de-
velopment.—Ed.]
“Prices and Cost Structure in Aus-
tralia are stabilising,” is the opinion
of Mr. Allison, President of the As-
sociated Chambers of Commerce.
“Australia’s economy is probably at
its soundest,” he said.

RIGHT WAY TO PLAN CITIES
MELBOURNE TO GOVERN GROWTH IN THREE STAGES.
Investigation of C.C.C. Master Plan.
For the purpose of investigating
at first hand the Cumberland County
Council’s Master Plan, the chairman
of the Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works, Mr. John C. Jessop,
visited Sydney this week.
He was accompanied by the board’s
secretary, Mr. C. F. Trathan.
At a Press conference on Monday,
Mr. fessop explained in detail the
ramifications of the Melbourne Mast-
er Plan, and made several comparisons
with the C.C.C. scheme.
He expressed the opinion that
Sydney’s Master Plan was the wrong
approach.
“It is not the planner’s duty to
tell people what they want,” Mr.
fessop said.
“It is their duty to provide that
their cities are better places to live
in and at the smallest economic cost.”
Three-Year Limit.
Mr. fessop explained that the Mel-
bourne Master Plan is being prepared
for submission to Parliament, with
recommendations by next July, which
marks the expiry of the three-year
limit imposed on the Board.
The recommendations will suggest
that the plan be implemented in two
stages. These will be:
• Estimate of overall cost;
• Manner in which the money
will be paid.
Avoid Sydney Errors.
Mr. lessop said the purpose of his
visit was to thoroughly investigate
Sydney’s Plan, and “avoid Sydney’s
;rrors.”
“I will examine carefully the legisla-
tion governing the Plan, especially
as regards compensation.
“We have come to pick the brains
of the planners here, and to endeav-
our to acquire a full knowledge of
the Scheme,” he added.
Claims and Compensation.
Mr. Jessop said that his board was
vitally interested in the question of
claims and compensation due to the
resumption of properties to imple-
ment their Plan.
“Human nature is ao different in
Melbourne than in Sydney, and there
was much opposition in some quart-
ers,” he declared.
He hoped that the Melbourne Mast-
er Plan would not be “slashed or
mutilated.”
Hii, board had co-operated closely
with many authorities transport,
roads, gas, and so on—and he hoped
that the final Plan “would meet with
the blessing and approval of the var-
ious authorities and the 38 local bod-
ies concerned.”
Scientific Survey.
In reply to a question from “Con-
struction,” Mr. fessop said a scientific
survey of 4000 homes was conducted
with the help of the Australian Gallup
Poll. This survey answered a num-
ber of important questions, such as:
• Do you travel long distances to
your work from choice or neces-
sity?
• Do you shop locally, or in the
city?
° Do you use local recreation
areas?
• Would you prefer to work near
(or nearer) your home?
The series of prepared questions
drew a very definite response from
those interviewed, and showed that the
people desired to live in self-contain-
ed suburbs.
The survey showed that in their

own suburb people hoped to find their
own jobs, do most of their shopping,
and find most of their entertainment,
“if the right types of homes were
built there.”
Traffic Sampled.
Mr. jessop said that a sampling of
traffic in Melbourne showed that half
the traffic passed straight through the
city. A series of specially-built and
replanned roads will later encircle the
city, and thus enable traffic to by-pass
the inner city area.
“We spent 18 months finding out
facts and analysing our findings on
terms of statistical plans,” Mr. jessop
added.
Huge Area.
“The Melbourne plan will exer-
cise jurisdiction over 660 sq. miles, in
which, physically, 10 million people
could live in comfort,” Mr. jessop
explained.
“But 1 believe the ultimate popula-
tion of Melbourne will not exceed
million.
“There will be two zones: the Ur-
ban Zone which will be the city of
the future, with million people liv-
ing in its boundaries, and the Rural
Zone, or green belt.
“It is the people on the edges of
the two zones who are mainly vocal
against the Plan,” said Mr. jessop.
Roads.
The board has interim development
powers over the roads, which would
be brought to Expressway standards.
Some new roads will be built, some
straightened, and two others will be
built to follow the river valleys.
“This will lead up to the complete
Master Plan, which will be in three
stages: interim, intermediate, and ul-
timate,” said Mr. jessop, adding:
“We have no doubt at all that the
Plan will make Melbourne a better
place to live in.”
Long Service.
Mr. jessop is serving his 13th year
as chairman of the Melbourne and
Metropolitan Board of Works.
Elected a Member of Heidelberg
City Council in 1932, he remained
in office continuously until appointed
to his present position in 1940. Dur-
ing his term as a Member of the
Council he was Mayor of Heidelberg
in 1935 and Vice-Chairman of the
Finance Committee in 1937. He was
elected a Delegate to the Board of
Works in 1934.
Under the terms of the Board’s
Act, the Chairman is elected every
four years by the 47 municipal dele-
gates. Upon election the Chairman
ceases to be a representative of any
municipality and must devote his full
time to the Board’s business.

After serving the Master Builders’
Association of New South Wales as
acting-secretary, Mr. Wilfred D. Ford
was appointed Secretary at the end
of November.
The position became vacant in May
last, when the Association’s highly-
esteemed Secretary, Mr. Leslie G.
Smith, died while on vacation at
Orange.
Prior to his appointment Mr. Ford
served the Association as Industrial
Officer.
An efficient and capable executive
and very popular personally, Mr.
Ford has brought a high degree of en-
thusiasm and energy to his new and
responsible duties as Master Builders’
Association Secretary.
Members have every confidence
that Mr. Ford will use every effort
within his power to advance the fu-
ture welfare of the Association and its
manifold activities.
THE GOAL OF
STANDARDIZATION.
The goal of standardization is very
high indeed; it aims at improving
the living standard of all people.
With a higher standard of living, man
will be able to attain a higher spirit-
ual level, because letters, sciences and
the arts flourish only in civilizations
where material needs are first satisfied.
We will be able to realize this goal
most efficiently through a truly inte-
gral international standardization. Our
effort to speed the application of
standardization is thus justified and
motivated by the growing necessity of
incessant improvement.
Mutual assistance among nations
can be fully realized only through
co-ordinated efforts. All progress
must be based upon the results ob-
tained at a given moment by the best
known methods in that part of the
globe where scientists, engineers and
technicians have achieved the best re-
sults.
This powerful mutual assistance
must evolve as all progress does.
Standardization is not static. At all
times, it defines the better product,
the better technique in each field, so
that better results may be achieved; it
modifies its definitions as soon as
evolution permits definite codification
of an improvement of standardized
elements, both abstract and concrete.
Thus standardization puts in place and
reinforces each rung of a ladder, the
building of which never stops.
A. Albert Caquot, President, ISO.
[The Editor’s experience of stand'
ardization, in home life particularly, is
that it is a “levelling down” process
whereby everyone has to live in the
same type of house with the same type
of fittings, etc. It cuts out all indi-
viduality and leaves nothing initia'
tive. Something should be left to
“variety, the spice of life.]

British Concrete
System in New U.S.
Bridge
A British method of pre-stressing
concrete is to be used in the U.S.
for the first time in the construction
of a three-mile length of trestle bridge
at Tampa Bay, Florida.
The pre-stressed length of the struc-
ture (which will have a total length
of 15 miles) will include 363 spans
for which 2,178 beams are being
made.
The method itself is known as the
Lee-McCall system. In August, 1950,
McCalls Macalloy Ltd., of Sheffield,
England, were invited by Preload En-
terprises Inc., of New York, to col-
laborate with them in preparing the
design for the length in question. It
was known that other methods of
pre-stressed concrete were being con-
sidered.
A design was submitted and subse-
quently McCalls were informed that
a tender for the pre-stressed concrete
work based on the use of the Lee-
McCall system and amounting to ap-
proximately eight million dollars was
the lowest received.
The method uses bars of a new
type of high tensile alloy steel as dis'
tinct from the usual wire cables. The
pre'Stressed part of the structure will
be the longest ever built. Completion
is expected in the middle of 1953.
Contracts using the Lee'McCall sys'
tern are now being carried out in
Australia, New Zealand and in a
number of other countries.

STRIKING CONTRASTS.
It would indeed be difficult to imagine two more diverse conceptions for a home than those portrayed in the
top right-a fine home in the simplifie English county house style—and that seen fn the bottom right which
combines all he features of what used to be known as a week-end “shack”, yet which today is being produced
by modernists as the complete housing solution. Although the points of the compass are not indicated it is
assumed that the lounge room in this design faces North and consequently the various rooms opening on to the
courtyard would be a pleasant feature. The other two plans are both large houses, one traditional and the other
modern.
