6-INCHES WIDER THAN OTHER HARDBOARDS
4-ft. 6-ins.
a
Timbrock is natural
wood made better. It
is stronger, splinter-
less, grainless, more
flexible, and ynost
important—white
ants wont attack it.
Council regulations and building practice call for
studs at 18" centres and the 4' 6" width of the
Timbrock board gives you the equivalent of three
18" panels. Also, two TIMBROCK 4' 6" boards
placed horizontally give the standard 9' ceiling
height. These “pre-tailored” sheets go up as fast
as you can nail them. No effort, no waste, so
Timbrock saves you time and money.
TWO TYPES
OF TIMBROCK
STANDARD TIMBROCK for
interior use.
TEMPERED TIMBROCK for exterior
walls and bathrooms.
Both types in 3/16" thickness.
TIMBROCK COMES IN MORE
LENGTHS. There are five lengths
s', 6', 7', B'—and exclusive to
TIMBROCK the big 14' board
so handy to home-builders.
TIMBROCK does it better. Walls,
cupboards, built-in furniture,
bookshelves, home-interiors, flush
doors, display cases, counter and
office fittings all can be built
better and at low-cost with time-
saving TIMBROCK.
TIMBROCK IS EASIER TO WORK
—Timbrock is easy to nail. It is
flexible, can be bent around
corners. It can be sawed or
planed. This board is lighter in
colour than other boards. Its
attractive natural colour needs
one coat less of paint.

The "DULUX WALL

a choice of 15 basic
colours and 30 blends,
making 45 illustrated

ours are available in

are sure of a perfect
job that will create
customer goodwill with
a minimum of non-pro-
ductive effort on your

The new "DULUX WALL COLOUR" GUIDE ensures
colour harmony, together with customer harmony.
Until now colours had to be chosen from a colour
card, with only limited choice, or specially tinted
on the job, in an attempt to obtain a colour
vaguely described by the customer. Now the
thrilling, new and unbelievably lovely "DULUX
WALL COLOURS" offer a choice that is almost
limitless. Your customer can "pin-point" the exact
colour desired, involving at most a simple blend-
ing and eliminating trial-and-error mixing.

Why Aluminium?
Cheaper Handling - Quicker Erection Lower Maintenance Costs
■■■
*-•>:;
Comet Flight Hangar for the de Havilland Aircraft Company Ltd.
200 ft. Clear Span. Main Structural Contractors: Structural &
Mechanical Development Engineers Ltd., Slough, Bucks.
This new hangar is another example of wide
span aluminium structures. Aluminium was
chosen for this structure —the world’s largest
in aluminium—because of economic advan-
tages. In a span of this width the structural
weight is about one seventh that of an equiva-
lent steel structure. Thus, apart from the
saving in material, the light weight permits
prefabrication and transport of very large sub-
assemblies and their erection with a minimum
of labour and equipment. The main structure
was erected by eighteen men in thirteen weeks,
using only two 5-ton hand-operated cranes,
practically without scaffolding. Moreover, the
structure does not require painting owing to
the high resistance of the aluminium alloy to
atmospheric attack. Elimination of the
necessity for periodic stripping and repainting
means a considerable reduction in maintenance
costs.

Second Success for Peddle, Thorp & Walker.
The Sir John Sulman Architectural
Award for 1952 has been made in
favour of the Royal Swedish Legation
at Canberra.
The final design for the Legation
was developed by Sydney Architects,
Messrs. Peddle, Thorp & Walker

THE ROYAL SWEDISH LEGATION, CANBERRA
SWEDISH CHARM IN AUSTRALIAN SETTING.
The Legation building is sited on a
hill with excellent views round from
Capitol Hill to the Alps in the dis-
tance and the length of the building
runs east-west allowing the main rooms
to face north and gain the benefits of
sun and view. As many of the trees
as possible were left standing and the
main building and driveway set in
relation to them.
There are three buildings—the main
building, the caretaker's lodge and gar-
ages. The main building is two-storey-
ed with full basement space. The plan-
ning problem was how to combine in
one building all the functions of the
Legation and the accommodation re-
quired. There are Minister’s residence
and entertaining rooms, the First Sec-
retary’s residence, three staff bachelor
flats and the general office, all with a
separate private entrance and all with
access to the general office.
Orrefors Glass Doors.
The royal blue entrance doors to
the Minister’s residence lead into the
hall through a pair of plate glass doors
etched in Sweden by the famous Orre-
fors glass company. There are four
panels and the symbols of each repre-
sent in turn, Sweden, Australia, the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Wide
doors from the hall lead into the salon
which opens through sliding doors to
the large dining room which again
opens on to the study; these three
rooms are planned on an axis to open
up as one. Off the dining room is the
pantry and the kitchen on one side
and on the other, the breakfast room,
which is at the end of the terrace and
gains the morning sun. The study,
which is also the Minister’s office, has
access through a waiting lobby to the
general office.
On the first floor are the bedrooms,
guest rooms, bathrooms and dressing
rooms with balconies off, whereas in
the basement is the cellar and tap
room with its brick floor and large
fireplace, traditionally Swedish, for en-
tertaining.
The remaining basement space
throughout is taken up with laun-
dries, drying rooms, boiler rooms and
stores. On the ground floor is the
servants flat close to the service on-
trance and to the kitchen with separ-
ate access to the first floor. The three
bachelor flats consist of sitting room,
bedroom, bathroom and kitchen and
are on the first floor
Away from the mam building is the
gatekeeper’s lodge which is a neat
three'bedroom cottage, and also
ages with a welhequipped workshop

BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING
August 24, 1953.


The windows were imported from
Sweden and are double'glazed sashes
with Venetian blinds between the two
glass sheets, the building is centrally
heated throughout and this reduced
heat loss. Ceilings to upper oors are
of fibrous plaster with insulation to
reduce heat from roof in summer and
conserve the heating in winter.
Australian timbers were used
throughout in flooring and trim, each
main room having a different timber
flooring. The parquet flooring in
brush box, rose gum, spotted gum and
rose she'oak. The board flooring—
spotted gum, tallowwood and cypress
pine. The trim and woodwork gen'
erally is in Queensland Maple where
stained and polished, carefully detail'
ed for outline and finish.
Green Swedish Marble Fireplace.
The fireplace in the salon is in
Swedish green marble, cut and finish'
ed in Sweden. The stone panels over
the main doorways were also carved in
Sweden and shipped out to Australia,
as were such things as the plaster panel
over the fireplace in the First Secre'
tary’s flat.
Throughout the building there is a
striving for good finish and for light'
ness as in the generally soft colour
schemes. The colour schemes were
worked out in coordination with the
various Swedish firms who were com'
missioned to decorate and furnish the
various sections of the Legation, dif-
ferent firms being given separate sec'
tions. Generally soft pastel shades are
used, pale greens, ivories, champagne
and pearl to give a background to the
colour of textiles, paintings and fur'
nishings with an occasional emphasis
with royal blue.
Fine Taste in Furnishings.
The textiles show what grace and
good taste the Swedish designers give
to their products, from carpets and cur'
tains to chair coverings and table
cloths. The general effect being of
lightness and grace. The light fittings
were imported from Sweden and their
finish and careful design are a pleasure
to see in contrast to those available in
Australia.
The furniture varies in design and
style, from the contemporary Swedish
to Regency in the guest room, to the
formal Gustavian reproductions which
are in the dining room, or to the
light seats and tables of the breakfast
room. The workmanship is of a very
high standard and the timbers used
give an excellent light and polished
finish.

The main building is centrally heat'
ed throughout with a radiant heat sys-
tern of hot water circulation through
copper pipe coils. Some of these coils
are embedded in the concrete floor
for floor heating, others in the ceil'
ing. The boiler is oil fired and located
in the basement.
To make the most of outside wall
space in the staff flats and servants’
flat, the kitchens and bathrooms were
placed inside the building and are
mechanically ventilated.
In the Legation building there was
a striving for design to give the clean
graceful lines characteristic of Swedish
architecture, to plan for Australian
conditions and to fit in the Australian
landscape.

BRITSTAND DISTRIBUTORS LTD.
IMPOSING NEW HEADQUARTERS
GARDENERS ROAD. MASCOT, SYDNEY.
Architects: C. C. Brewster & Murray.
Builders: Kell & Rigby.
The approach made by Britstand
Distributors Ltd. to the problem of
assessing the requirements for its pre'
raises may be of interest to other
companies who face the same ques'
tion, having in mind that an architect
can naturally get a better result for
his client if the latter has a clear con'
ception of the fundamental needs.
two companies face exactly the
same problem, even though they may
be in the same industry, because build'
ing layout is to some extent affected
in important directions even by the
systems and the organisational plan
used or likely to be used.
Before any architect was appointed,
Britstand therefore first put the build'
ing project in the charge of one of
its executives for preliminary investi'
gation and study. The first step there'
after taken was the creation of a
Building Advisory Committee coni'
prising executive heads of main de'
partment, as follows:—Sales Division,
Finance Division, Advertising Divh
sion, Spare Parts Division, Receipts
and Despatch Division, Service and
Workshop Division.
Space Requirements.
A vital and basic problem was that
of space requirements for their por'
tions of the building in the light of
past experience and probable future
developments, and they were required
to estimate this on the basis of: (1)
Present requirements; (2) Estimated
requirements in five years; (3) Esti'
mated requirements in ten years.
After careful investigation and dis*
cussion, the Committee recorded its
recommendation of a single'storey
construction throughout, with possible
exception of ancillaries such as film
projection room, advertising division,
conference room and staff lunch
rooms.
Inter-relation of Areas.
Tbe next st wag t determine the
best compromis e location of the main
sections of the building in relation to
eaC h other, i.e., offices in relation to
Showroom, and these two in relation
to Spare Parts Storage and Workshop.
Problems to be considered included
division of Showroom from Offices,
distance to be walked by staff between
Offices, Spare Parts Division and
Workshop, minimum movement dis'
tance of spare parts and complete
machines between Spare Parts Storage
bays, Workshop bays and Receipt and
Despatch control points. It was con'
firmed that the problem called ap'
proximately for ' a “T”'shaped build'
ing with Office Block and Showroom
forming the horizontal portion of the
‘ T. Spare Parts Storage forming the
upper portion of the vertical of the
T. and Workshops forming the
lower portions of same.
Unless undue wastage of land by
sideways expansion of the Spare Parts
Division was to occur at an early
stage in the life of the building, or
elS j to °5L th( : higher, heavier
and mor l e cost J y Workshop area, this
meant that adequate long-term pro'
v , lslo f\ Spare , Parts Storage space
should be provided initially,
The “T-shaped design would allow
for convenient extension of Offices in
a rearward direction if and when
necessary, and the Office area was
therefore held to the five'year estimate,
W j lle th f S P are Parts area was a ot'
ted on ten ' year estl "a ate -
Workshop area was allocated on the
five'year estimate because of the ease
°f economic Workshop extension,

Detailed consideration was then
given to the question of such matters
,as best location of executives and staff
i n relation to each other in all sections
of the building.
For instance, being a marketing
company and in view of the nature of
the systems, policies and activities of
the company, it was recommended
that the Managing Director’s Office
be flanked on the two sides by Sales
Manager’s an d Secretary s Offices,
Assistant Sales Manager s Office to be
nea r to Sales Managers Office, and
Service Manager’s Office to be close

to both. Section Managers’ Offices
to be close to Assistant Sales Mana'
ger’s Office. Relevant assistants and
stenographers to be located imme-
diatelv outside the offices of the execu'
tives for whom they work.
Recommendations of Divisional
Sub-Committees.
Recommendations o f Divisional
Sub'Committees to the main Commit'
tee also covered essential equipment
and features of their portions of the
building. For instance Despatch
Division asked for sunken loading
docks to minimise loading and un-
loading labour. Spare Parts Division
requested teleprinter connection with
the G.P.O. for instant receipt and
despatch of telegrams, and a host of
similar recommendations considered
desirable for the lowest long'term
labour costs and greatest efficiency,
Everyone wanted good natural light
and ventilation and a low noise level,
thus called for sound absorbent ceil'
ings in office areas because of the
considerable noise developed in the
Workshop from the operation of large
tractors and other powerful engine'
functioned equipment.
Selection of Architects,
_ , , , . , , t
It was obviously desirable to select
architects who had maximum expen-
ence m the design of the particular
type of building required,
An independent consultant was
therefore selected to investigate all
known likely architectural organisa'
tions who had sufficient staff to effi'
ciently handle the project.
A final submission was received
from the consultant listing a consider'
able number of architects, with nota'
tions as to the size of their organisa'
tions, reputation for ability, etc., and
a recommendation limited to a choice
between four.
After due consideration Britsand
chose Messrs. C. C. Brewster &
Murray as architects for the building.
Messrs. Julius, Poole and Gibson were
appointed electrical consultants, and
Messrs. Stanley and Llewellyn mecha'
nical consultants.
Britstand executives on overseas
business tours also investigated and
inspected comparable premises in the
U.S. and Great Britain, while Mr. C.
C. Brewster, senior partner of
Brewster & Murray, also made very
detailed investigations whilst in U.S.A.
and Europe and made valuable recom'
mendations as a result.
For its size, the building is claimed
to be in advance in its features and
design of any comparable premises in
U.S. A., Great Britain or Australia,
and great credit is due to our archfi
tects for their creation of an outstand'
ing building embodying full functional
efficiency, excellent appearance and
economic design.
Tenders were called for the work in
the latter half of 1951, and from six
prices, that of Messrs. Kell & Rigby
was accepted. The erection of the
building was delayed in the early stages
mainly because of the hold'up in ship'
ment from England of the prefabri'
cated steel columns and roof trusses
and then in a minor degree later by
continually wet weather.
The building comprises primarily
four main sections, e.g., Showroom,
Offices, Spare Parts and Workshop.
The Showroom.
The main entrance to the building
is through the Showroom front door,
so that all entrants will see the ex'
hibits as they pass to the main enquiry
counter. In the same way, those who
enter to purchase spare parts, cross
the Showroom floor to the Spare Parts
counter. The Showroom has many
outstanding and new ideas. The show
windows themselves, which the archi'
tects claim are the only type which
will not reflect glare, are new even
to America, but are eminently sue'
cessful.
The Showroom floor has a new
type of concrete surface which is a
hard, pleasantdooking surface which
can be easily cleaned and yet is in'
expensive.
The flat roof is a type fairly new
to Australia and is cooled by a thin
layer of celhconcrete.

The New “Corroboree Room” at the Wentworth Hotel
AN “ADVENTURE” IN DESIGN.
The Wentworth Hotel has recently
transformed the former “Tudor
Room” into the “Corroboree Room”
a modern, fully air-conditioned pri-
vate dining room. A distinctly Aus-
tralian atmosphere has been provided
by a striking “Corroboree” mural cur-
tain on one wall, and two original
water colours by aboriginal artists in
strong, bright colours on the other.
The room has a dining capacity for
30 people and of up to 50 people for
cocktail parties.
An air of spaciousness, without loss
of “intimacy,” has been achieved by
opening up the exterior wall.with two
large plate-glass windows, giving an
outlook to the attractive park in front
of the Hotel, and positioning a mirror
of the same size as one window at the
other end of the room. Illuminated
mirrored glass shelves are fitted on the
wall at the rear of the cocktail bar to
serve for display and glass storage.
The plate-glass windows are furnished
with floor-to-ceiling white Venetian
blinds.
Variable Lighting
and Colour Scheme.
Perhaps the most striking feature
of the room is the harmonious effect
of the variable lighting and colour
scheme. The use of air-conditioning
made it possible to adopt a colour
scheme in which “warm” colours pre-
dominate. A slightly mottled bur-
gundy hair cord was selected for the
carpet, and yellow as the basic colour
in the curtains used on three walls—
plain yellow on two, and the mural
curtain already mentioned on the
third, depicting small aborigine figures
in a “corroboree” scene framed in
strong wavy lines in brown and grey
on a yellow background. The mural
curtain is positioned to reflect in the
large mirror, doubling its apparent
length. The wall surfaces are light
grey, with white introduced in the top
of the cocktail bar, flower box, Vene-
tian blind ladders and door architrave,
and the ceiling treatment.
“Floating” Cocktail Bar.
The cocktail bar has a “floating”
effect, and is positioned so as to leave
maximum usable space in the room.
Its clear, modern design is softened by
the use of quilted grey plastic studded
with large yellow buttons to tie in
with the curtain colour. The doors
to the storage section below the cock-
tail bar shelves, and the main entrance
doors were treated to match.
A decorative flower box at the other
end of the room provides a protection
from the service stairway, and also an
unobtrusive table for ashtrays and
glasses. This box was kept low so as
not to effect the impression of
spaciousness, and, like the cocktail bar,
is designed on the floating principle,
The two original watercolours by
aboriginal art i s t s are dramatically
grouped on the opposite wall to the

mural curtains, in reversed frames so
constructed that the pictures can be
changed by simply sliding them up-
wards. The timber background to the
frames, the woodwork of the flower
box, and the brown in the mural cur-
tains tie in with the timber in the
dining chairs.
Air-conditioning
and Lighting.
Two major considerations were air-
conditioning and lighting, and in these
a particular problem was the low ceil-
ing height, which was crossed in its
length and breadth by beams provid-
ing only 7ft. 3in. clearance from the
floor.
Air-conditioning was essential to
provide adequate ventilation, which
could not be obtained by natural
means, and the inlet registers are con-
cealed in the lighting cornices, and the
return air register in the servery area
behind the cocktail bar. To reduce
running times when the room is only
being used by a small group of people,
and to increase the capacity of the
conditioning plant when it is fully
utilised, the ceiling was lined with 3in.
of “Insulwool.”
One of the main problems in a
room of this nature is the heavy
smoking during large gatherings, which
requires a large amount of make-up
air to be introduced into the system
so that the smoke haze can be dissi-
pated. The introduction of such a
large volume of air, and the rapidity
of the movement meant that special
attention had to be given to baffling
the inlet air so that the deflection from
the ceiling treatment would not cause
discomfort to occupants.
The plant is controlled by a push-
button within the roof itself, and,
once started, automatic controls en-
sure that warm, or cool, conditioned
air is admitted as required. The
equipment is capable of providing 20
air changes per hour, whilst maintain-
ing the room temperature at 70 degrees
F. with a 55 per cent, humidity. The
total heating load of the plant is 6
kW., with h.p. in electric motors.
The equipment was installed in a
specially-built house directly above the
Corroboree Room, and its design en-
sures that noise and vibration are kept
to a minimum.
As the room has to rely mainly on
artificial light, a totally indirect system
of lighting has been used with a view
to giving the impression of added
height to the ceiling and space in the
room. The flared cornices conceal
the fluorescent tubes, and at the same
time lead the eye upwards with a view
to hiding the existence of the heavy
beams.
Warm white fluorescent cold
cathode were used for the general
lighting scheme. “Warm white” was
chosen in order to introduce red into
the lighting to offset any coldness of
the air-conditioning, and to flatter the
skin colouring of the guests. A colour
contrast is provided by blue fluores-
cent tubes installed behind opal screens
in the cocktail bar shelves. This
colour also shows glassware to advan-
tage. The pictures are lit by gold-
plated bullet spots, using metal fila-
ment lamps.
The difference in brightness be-
tween the flat ceiling sections and
sloping surrounds was reduced by
painting* the main ceiling in a flat
white, and the sloping surrounds in
medium grey. This treatment still
gave maximum light diffusion on the
main ceiling surface.
The main lighting installation is
controlled by a variable dimmer which
reduces the foot candle intensity over
the whole room from the maximum
of 8 to 3. Lighting and air con-
ditioning controls are grouped in the
cupboard at the rear of the cocktail
bar.
Although only a small room, the
general effect produced by the above
features is most pleasing, and the
adoption of an “Australian” decora-
tion scheme an interesting and novel
development which, if followed in
Australian publicity areas overseas,
would no doubt excite a considerable
amount of interest.

“Dream Village” Project Starts
SELF-CONTAINED COMMUNITY PLANNED AT BLAXLAND.
A “dream village” at Blaxland, 43
miles west of Sydney, will be Austra-
lia’s most ambitious housing project.
The Legion of Ex-servicemen is
sponsoring the erection of 800 houses,
14 shops, a community centre, a club,
and two churches on a large estate.
The village, when completed in five
years, will house about 3500 people.
The Legion is supplying finance for
ex-servicemen and war widows for
homes, and has selected 45 applicants
from the first 250 to apply under the
scheme.
These home-builders require only
£5O deposit to receive half an acre of
land and a modern one-, two-, or
three-bedroom house.
If those selected cannot provide
£5O, that amount can be borrowed
from the Legion, and repaid by instal-
ments.
The Legion has set a limit of
£2750 on home finance, and repay-
ments will be made over a period of
20 years.
Mount Riverview.
The Director of the Timber Devel-
opment Association of Australia, Mr.
Colin Davis, in announcing details of
the “dream village,” said that approx-
imately 400 acres have either been
purchased or are held under option in
a self,contained area centred around
the famous Mt. Riverview Lookout,
which is part of the project’s property.
“The principle behind the project is
to establish a model village for ex-
servicemen—a village in which all
profits are returned to the village for
improvement and the establishment of
amenities,” Mr. Davis said.
“It will also serve as a ‘pilot’ vil-
lage for similar projects in other parts
of the Commonwealth,” he added.
Mr. Davis explained that the pro-
ject is sponsored by the Australian
Legion of Ex-servicemen and Women
(N.S.W .) in the same manner in
which it has sponsored Legion Cabs
(now the largest taxi cab organisation
in the world); Services Mutual In-
surance Co. (the only Ex-Service fully
mutual insurance Co.); the Legion
Home Planning Service (which has
helped to build over 2000 homes in
N.S.W. since 1947); and Legion Co-
operative Societies (which have lent
almost £1,000,000 to 800 ex-service-
men in the State.
Community Centre.
Mt. Riverview will be a community
centre, in which all profits will be re-
turned to the village.
When an applicant is clearing his
half-acre block, he and his wife are
jointly interviewed by the Legion’s
consulting architect Mr. John P.
Ley.
They are encouraged to design the
home of their choice within the scope
of the available finance.
Their plans and specifications are
then prepared by the Mt. Riverview
Home Planning Service.
It is proposed that the homes them-
selves will be erected by Mt. River-
view Pty. Ltd. (comprising Legion
representatives), but in the meantime
the company has engaged Campbell
and Dening, of Lawson, to erect the
homes to the roof pitching stage as
sub-contractors.
This firm was selected after exhau-
stive enquiries by the Board and archi-
tect into quality, price and reputation.
The homes from the frame stage
will be taken over by teams of trades'
men actually resident in the village or
building their homes in the village.
All work and prices will be closely
supervised by the Board, the architect,
the Blue Mountains City Council and
the lending authority.
Community Effort.
Instead of unsightly houses clutter-
ed together in narrow streets the vil-
lage streets, as a result of community
effort, will be lined with orange trees,
and through the same efforts a com-

NEW U.S. RESEARCH CENTRE
LEVER BROS., NEW YORK.
Flexible Laboratory Units.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER.
Facing the Hudson River at Edge-
water, New Jersey, and affording a
dramatic view of the New York sky-
line in the new Research Centre of
Lever Brothers Company. It is dis-
tinguished by its glass-steel construc-
tion, like the famous office building of
the company at 53rd Street and Park
Avenue in New York.
Architects of the Research Centre
are Skidmore, Owings and Merrill,
who designed the striking New York
structure.
The new Research Centre comprises
a five-storey research laboratory and a
two-storey pilot plant. The building
is patterned so that there is the most
convenient access to all laboratories,
and from all laboratories to the pilot
plant. The laboratory units were “de-
signed and combined like dominoes”
to give the most effective horizontal
relationship between them. Then the
units were stacked on top of one
another for the best vertical relation-
ship, not only among the units them-
selves, but among the five major de-
partments as well.
Laboratory Units Are Flexible.
The Laboratory units are flexible as
well. Any of the laboratories can be
enlarged by removing the cinder block
partitions, taking out an adjoining
utility room and installing more labora-
tory benches.
In the new Research Centre such
unusual laboratories are housed: the
first perfume “organ” in the world; a
spectre-photometric and X-ray labora-
tory which “fingerprints” chemicals by
colour and by inter-atomic spacing; a
home laundry service in which house-
wives actually participate; a dental
clinic with new brushing machines; a
hair laboratory staffed by beauticians;
a complete bakery; a laboratory which
studies films, foams and suds, measur-
ing films of one 10-millionth of an
inch in thickness, and containing a
machine which measures the forces to
make and collapse suds and foams; a
super-sonic washing machine; a pilot
plant capable of semi-commercial
manufacturing of new products.
By using concrete and reinforcing
bars and mesh, 450 tons of structural
steel gave way to only 209 tons of
reinforcing steel. Copper piping went
out the window in favour of galvanised
steel.
The total area of the Centre is
127,520 square feet, of which 84,400
square feet is in the laboratory, 36,800
is pilot plant, and 6,320 is storage.
Land area is six acres. The laboratory
building is air-conditioned, while the
pilot plant is mechanically ventilated.
300 people are working in the labora-
tory.
Novelty with Glass in Structure
and Colour.
For the greater part of the glass
area, economical blue Coolite
glare-reducing glass is used. This has
a slightly pebbled, or Luxlite, finish
on one side and acid-etched on the
other. This glass is translucent and
filters out about 50.8 per cent, of the
solar heat. Continuous vision strips of
clear, blue Solex glass, which filters
out about 35 per cent, of the sun’s
heat, is provided at eye level on each
floor. These vision strips only are
operable, and can be opened for ven-
tilation.
Each floor of the Research Centre
has a different colour scheme, although
the basic colour is a grey, containing
a dash of red. Offsetting the drab
grey is a gay colour, noticed particu-
larly in the corridors, where one wall
is grey, the other cocoa brown, green,
canary yellow, or rasberry red. Ex-
posed on each laboratory ceiling is a
group of service pipes in colours, each
a different colour to identify water,
gas, electricity, or distilled water.
Perfume “Organ.”
Some of the apparatus and instru-
ments used in the Centre are unusual.
One such is the perfume “organ.”
The perfumer, a chemist, sits before a
large console and mixes odours to ar-
rive at the proper fragrance for various
products. One Lever soap is scented
with a blend of 58 perfumes. In the
console, a series of shelves semi-
circularly arranged in front of the
perfumer, are hundreds of bottles con-
taining oils and fragrances. A thin
strip of blotting paper, or “smelling
blotter,” is dipped into the bottle, re-
moved and allowed to dry off. The
different shades of odour are noted as
the perfume evaporates; the chemist
follows the odour from the first dip
into the perfume until the next day.
In the Dental Clinic, toothpastes
and dentifrices are tested, the cleans-
ing ability of dentifrices as well as
the effects of dentifrices and mouth
washes on gums, the ability of a den-
tifrice to polish tooth enamel. A
“Lustremeasure” does just that: it
measures the amount of light reflected
off teeth. Another specially-devised
machine is the “Osmoscope, which
accurately measures mouth odours and
the efficiency of dentifrices in stop-
ping them.
THE LEVER RESEARCH CENTRE.
Lever Bros, have recently completed the most modern Research Centre of its type
in the world at New Jersey looking over the Hudson River to the dramatic New
York skyline. Associated with the five-storey building is a two-storey pilot plant.

Vigorous Housing Policy Planned
For New Zealand
(A. L. Kidson)
At a government-sponsored Na-
tional Housing Conference which
began in Parliament Building, Web
lington, on August 4, plans were out'
lined for a full-scale drive to provide
more homes for New Zealanders, and
to put a curb on building costs. Dele-
gates numbering 106 came from 46
organisations, representing every facet
of house-building. They were wel-
comed by the acting Prime Minister
(Mr. Holyoake), the Minister of
Works (Mr. Goosman), the Associ-
ate Minister of Finance (Mr. Bowd-
en), the Minister of Industries and
Commerce (Mr. Watts), and the Min-
ister in charge of the State Advances
Corporation (Mr. Marshall).
Ministers reviewed New Zealand
housing costs and achievements in re-
cent years, and stated government
policy. This aimed at restricting the
number of State-built houses, and
creating conditions which would en-
able people to build their own houses.
The government believed that private
enterprise should build houses which
private people could own. This did
not mean a complete cessation of State
house-building; the government still
accepts responsibility for much spec-
ialised building for people on lower
incomes, and for groups of public
servants. Between 2,800 and 3,000
State houses will continue to be built
each year.
In the last three years 48,800
houses have been built in New Zea-
land, 10,000 of them by the State.
At the same time the government has
sponsored a number of schemes to
help people build their own homes,
and it has encouraged the group
building of houses for sale. It hopes
that more such groups will be formed.
Overseas prices for certain building
materials affect house costs in New
Zealand, and these have risen sub-
stantially. In 1939 a three-bedroom
State house cost £NZIOSI to build.
In 1940 similar houses cost <£1168;
in 1945, £1582; in 1950, £lB9B, and
on the latest figure, £2492. Paths,
fences, etc., cost £72 in 1939, com-
pared with £l7O in 1952. In the
same period timber components rose
from £235 to £490.
While housing problems are no eas-
ier to solve in New Zealand than else-
where, the stage is ow well set there
for an “all out” drive towards solu-
tion. The supply position for mater-
ials has improved, controls relaxed.
Labour in the building trades is still
scarce, but overseas sources (notably
Britain and Australia) are being tap-
ped. Pre-cut houses, from Austria,
are now being imported; and since
their cost is comparable with that of lo-
cal structures they will play their part
in meeting New Zealand’s housing
deficiencies.
There, as in Australia, shortage of
finance has cancelled the advantage of
an improved supply position and the
lifting of controls. A substantial gap
has grown between mortgage limits
and actual building costs. The gov-
ernment struck a positive note at the
Conference by announcing a new fi-
nance scheme to bridge that gap.
subject to certain limits, the State will
guarantee the difference between the
amount of the loans usually allowed by
private lending institutions and 90 per
cent, of the valuation of a new house,
with a maximum of £NZ2,OOO. It
will also extend loans on 35-40 year
terms, with the right of financing.
This will be done through the State
Advances Corporation. Examples of
the weekly repayments for a £2,000
loan depending upon the rate of in-
terest and the number of years in
which it can be amortised
This mortgage guarantee scheme
will extend also to private building
groups and organisations wishing to
develop housing schemes. If the
groups can develop land and arrange
finance through private lending insti-
tutions the government will make the
mortgage guarantee scheme available
for houses built by them. If after a
reasonable period the houses have not
been sold privately the government
will take over an agreed proportion
of them.
While the soundness of these pro-
posals will not be seriously challenged,
much controversy has already centred
on certain other suggestions which the
government hoped would receive the
blessing of the Conference, and
through it the building industry. One
is the provision of “low cost” houses,
for which the government will supply
plans at a nominal charge. Prototypes
have already been built in the four
main cities, where thev attracted much
attention.
These says the acting Prime Minis-
ter, are good-standard, durable family
homes, built to the requirements of
the New Zealand Standard Building
Code. Their cost is from £2,000 to
£2,500. Their function as exhibits
was to show the public how housing
costs can be cut by the adoption of
modern planning techniques. Critics
claim that the only technique used for

ELECTRICITY IN QUEENSLAND
AN ACORN BECOMES AN OAK.
(By Our Queensland Correspondent.)
The trite aphorism telling the world
that “Great Oaks from little acorns
grow” was never more appropriately
exemplified than in the case of elec'
tricity development in Queensland by
two partners —Barton and White —
subsequently floated into a firm, then
into a company, the City Electric
Light Company, and ultimately its
conversion, very recently, into a pub'
lie authority under the title of “The
Southern Electric Authority of
Queensland,” S.E.A., as it is now
commonly known.
But there were many shoals to em
counter before the smooth water to
the S.E.A. had been reached. Despite
the great ingenuity and technical skill
of both Messrs. Barton and White,
the treacherous reefs of financial insta'
bility obtruded to such an extent as as
dictate the need of a company, to be
called the Brisbane Electric Supply
Company which progressed so encour'
agingly as to warrant the construction
and expansion of this company in
1904 to a public company limited by
shares.
Thus came about the registration
of the City Electric Light Company
Limited which made such rapid pro'
grass that in 1917 an associated com'
pany was formed to undertake the
supply of electricity to the Ipswich
district, upwards of 25 miles west of
Brisbane. In addition, the C.E.L. ar'
ranged various agreements in terms
of which bulk supplies of electricity
were supplied to local authorities in
the Metropolitan area —before the
years of their absorbtion into Greater
Brisbane —until 1926 when the ab'
sorbtions came about, and the Bris'
bane City Council established its own
electricity department.
First Electrical Demonstration.
It is doubtful whether men born
40 to 50 years ago realise how differ'
ent is the world they now live in, to
that of the previous generation.
It is barely 7 years since the first
demonstration of electric light was
given in Brisbane, for on December
11, 1882, the 47,172 population of
the census year 1881, turned out in
their horse and buggies to see this
marvel of electric lighting from eight
arc lamps in Queen Street generated
from a dynamo in Adelaide Street. In
the following year, permanent electric
lighting was installed at the Govern'
ment Printing Office. A few years
later, about 1886 or 1887 an enter'
prising butchering establishment in
Rockhampton 400 miles north of Bris'
bane, by ocean, had one arc light
spitting out its fitful semi'blue splurges
between two carbon points. Be it
said, however, that the master'butcher
referred to, being an original share'
holder in the fabulous Mt. Morgan
gold mine that created more than one
millionaire, could afford to take risks.
Even more cautious were the people
of Great Britain, because it is record'
ed that only shortly before the de-
monstration in Brisbane—the first
British colony and almost the first
town in the British Empire to have
electric lighting—was that demonstrat'
ed at the Crystal Palace, London, to
be followed by the first public supply
at Brighton, England.
Men of Vision.
The history of Queensland should
record with great appreciation the
vision of men like Barton and White.
The building, so appropriately naim
ed, which still stands in Edison Lane
off Creek Street behind the Brisbane
General Post Office, in which Barton
and White pioneered, in 1887, the
first electrical power'house, was to be
the focal point of the apath” and seep'
ticism of a public that thought in
terms of pence, instead of in pounds,
as is the case today. Time has bene'
ficiently left the names of “Barton
and White” unobliterated after 66
years, from the wall of this old four'
storeyed building. It will be a pity,
if Brisbane National Trust, in embryo,
is unable to retain this silent memorial
from which has been evolved a great
source of electrical power benefiting
directly, or indirectly, more than a
million people.
First Modest Plant.
The modest plant of those early
days was a traction type boiler and a
Marshall engine. The generating unit
was a dynamo supplying the direct
current at 00 volts and about 30 kW
capacity. Overhead wires was the
method of transmission then, as now,
but over the roofs of buildings to such
places as the G.P.0., the Opera
House, and a few adjacent shops.
Then in 1899, 12 years later, a larg'
er power house was built in Ann St.,
with a maximum capacity of 92 kW.
Again, in 1912, a much larger power
house was built on the river bank in
William Street, very near to Parlia'
ment House, conveniently placed to
water, both for use in the power house
and for river transport for coal if this
means became more economic than
rail transport, and short city motor'
truck deliveries. This has been sup'
erceded by the ultra'modern Bulimba
A Station, also on the river side,
though further down the Brisbane
River near its mouth, and generates
92,000 kilowatts.

Abermain Power Station, Ipswich,
Queensland
“PACKAGED” STATION IN OPERATION.
The Southern Electric Authority’s
new packaged power-station at Aber-
main, near Ipswich, is now supplying
its full capacity of 10,000 kilowatts.
It began service on half-capacity at
the beginning of March, 1953, with
one of its two boilers operating, and
the second boiler went into permanent
commission some weeks later.
When, in January, 1951, it became
evident that unavoidable delays in the
programme of construction of the City
Electric Light Company’s Bulimba
“B” Power Station would prevent that
station from going into commission
by the winter of 1952, negotiations
were opened for the purchase of
power station equipment for quick de-
livery to meet the emergency condi-
tions which would inevitably arise,
and the plant was ordered in February,
1951, and scheduled to go into opera-
tion at North Ipswich in May, 1952.
A so-called “Package Power
Station,’’ it could not be taken from
the shelf like a packet of peas in a
grocer’s shop. The plant had to be
designed in detail, manufactured,
transported to the site, erected and
tested, and a building had to be con-
structed to accommodate it. All these
functions were the responsibility of a
single contractor.
Plant of American origin was select-
ed as at that time British manufac-
turers were unable to offer the de-
liveries which were required by the
company, which was endeavouring to
meet the winter load of 1952.
However, the purchase of equip-
ment from U.S.A., a hard currency
country, presented special problems.
After investigation by the Interna-
tional Bank, funds were allocated from
the fifty million dollar loan which had
been made available to the Common-
wealth Government for projects of de-
fence and national post-war develop-
ment. The next hurdle was the pro-
curement of an Export License and
Defence Priority in U.S.A. Shortly
after the order was placed, the United
States Government, after reviewing its
defence requirements, set up the
National Production Authority to al-
locate generating plant to undertakings
where its use would assist in building
up the defences of the U.S.A. and to
control the export of such equipment.
In order to secure priorities for the
Abermain plant and other Australian
Package Plants, the Commonwealth
Government arranged for Mr. H. G.
Conde, Commissioner for Electricity
for New South Wales, and an officer
of the Customs Department to pro-
ceed to U.S.A., where they presented
a comprehensive case for the exporta-
tion of generating equipment to Aus-
tralia. After prolonged negotiations,
the mission was completely successful.
U.S. Defence Priorities were allotted
to the Australian projects and export
permits were issued to manufacturers
who were then obliged to secure sup'
plies of essential materials, such as
steel. Armed with their defence alio'
cations, manufacturers still had to
purchase their requirements in the
open market and secured their quotas
with considerable difficulty.
All these factors imposed consider'
able delay, and the situation was not
improved by a six weeks’ strike in the
factory of one of the principal plant
manufacturers, followed by a dock
strike on the New York waterfront,
10,000-kilowatt Capacity.
The Abermain Power Station, with
an output of 10,000 kilowatts, has in'
creased the generating capacity of the
Southern Electricity Authority by
over 10%. The plant comprises a
single 10,000'kilowatt turbo'alternator
of conventional design, two boilers
each capable of evaporating 55,000 lb.
of steam per hour, together with the
necessary transformers, switchgear and
auxiliary equipment to enable it to
function as a modern high efficiency
power plant. The equipment is
housed in a reinforced concrete struc'
ture, except for the high'voltage equip-
ment, which is outdoor type, and the
boilers, which it is believed are the
first outdoor units to be installed in
Australia, the boiler fronts and operat-
ing platform being the only portion
of the boilers protected by the build-
ing.
Equipped with fully automatic com-
bustion control the boilers are coal-
fired, modern spreader being provided
to cope with the low grade of coal
now being supplied by the West
Moreton coalfield. Fuel transport
costs are entirely eliminated, the coal
being fed to the power station by a
70ft. rubber belt direct from the pit-
head of an adjacent coal mine—pos-
sibly the shortest distance from coal
mine to power station in any part of
the world. The coal is weighed auto-
matically as it passes along the belt.
Steam power stations require vast
quantities of cooling water for the
condensers, unless other means of
cooling are provided, and to ensure
that conditions will be adequate at all
times a cooling tower has been pro-
vided, surmounted by two induced-
draught fans each 20ft. in diameter.
Make-up water for this system is
drawn from the Bremer River through
a half a mile of pipeline.
To provide a fresh water supply
for the boilers, a mile of pipeline was
laid from the boundary of the City of
Ipswich. The water is softened and
then evaporated before being pumped
into the boilers.
THE ABERMAIN POWER STATION. IPSWICH, QUEENSLAND.
Now in operation, this station has a capacity of 10,000 kilowatts; when completed
it will cost £1,000,000. It draws its coal supply directly from the mine seen on
the left.

Transport Problems.
Special facilities had to be provided
to get the equipment from the wharf
to the site, for neither rail nor road
bridges between Brisbane and North
Ipswich were able to carry the heavy
loads without considerable stiffening,
which would have been a most expen-
sive operation. To overcome this
problem City Electric Light Company
Limited purchased a 300'ton floating
dock, which was out of commission,
and converted it to a barge. On this,
five loads, from 40 to 45 tons, were
towed by tugs up the Brisbane and
Bremer Rivers to the site, special load'
ing and unloading docks being con'
structed. The condenser, turbine, ah
ternator stator and two 20 M.V.A.,
110 K.V./33 K.V. step'down trans'
formers for Abermain Sub' Station
were each handled successfully in this
fashion.
In addition to its natural advantages
in regard to convenience of access to
coal and water, the Station is well
situated in regard to the Southern
Electricity Authority’s transmission
system, being just over a mile from
the Authority’s Abermain Sub-station,
which is now under construction. This
will be the central distributing centre
for power for the Ipswich district, as
well as the Nambour'Gympie area, the
Lockyer and Brisbane Valleys, and the
Darling Downs. Three HO K.V.
transmission lines connect the Sub'
station with the Bulimba Power
Stations, and from it two 110 K.V.
lines will radiate, one to Nambour and
the other to Postman’s Ridge, at the
foot of the Toowoomba Range. The
latter is already in commission, and
the Nambour line is under construe'
tion.
Cost Exceeds £1,000,000.
The Power Station, the completed
cost of which exceeds £1,000,000, is
by no means a stop'gap equipment
which will be a white elephant after
the present power emergency passes.
Its capital costs, which are somewhat
higher per unit of output than the
costs of the larger sets being installed
in the Authority’s Bulimba B Power
Station which is now under construe'
tion, are partially offset by the ehmi'
nation of fuel'handling charges, and
the Station’s high efficiency will enable
it to have a permanent economic place
in the generating system ot tne
Southern Electricity Authority, its
normal operation being on a two'shitt
basis on five days per week.
The Station adds little to the
Ipswich landscape as, being built on
a site hacked from the bush, it is
visible only from a hundred yards or
so off the Mt. Grosby Road, except
for the top of its 126 ft. steel stack,
which can be seen from some of the
heights of the Ipswich district.
EXPANSION IN BRISBANE
BULIMBA “B” POWER STATION.
Bulimba “B” Power Station has
been designed as a coordinated unit
of the generating facilities now exist'
ing and required for the future elec'
trical development of South East
Queensland. Located on the Brisbane
River, with its ample supplies of water
for condensing purposes, it is con'
veniently located with the Authority’s
main 110,000'volt Stepop Substation
on Lytton Road, from which electrical
power is or will be transmitted to the
South Coast, Ipswich and the Darling
Downs and to the North Coast by a
system of 110,000'volt overhead trans'
mission lines, the first two of which
are now in service, one terminating
at a 110,000 volt to 33,000'v01t Step'
down Substation at Burleigh and the
second at a similar Substation at Post'
man’s Ridge at the foot of the Too'
woomba Range, At the same time
3 3,ooo'volt underground and over'
head cables transmit power to the in'
dustrial and commercial areas in the
heart of the City of Brisbane, and the
new Power Station will be inter'
connected with the Authority’s exist'
ing Power Station, Bulimba “A.”
Reclamation at Gibson
Island.
Gibson Island, on which the Power
Station is located, was originally cut
off at high tide by tidal waters which
over'flowed into Doboy Creek. This
area has been reclaimed with ashes by
the Authority so that the Island is
now in fact an isthmus. Hundreds of
thousands of cubic yards of ashes have
gone into this reclamation project, and
Doboy Creek is being confined within
narrower limits in accordance with the
plans of the Harbour and Marine
Department. In order to ensure that
the circulating water from the Bris'
bane River which becomes heated in
its passage through the condensers
will not be short'drcuited, the dis-
charge from the condensers will enter
Doboy Creek and will have to make
a circuit of over two miles before
being re-circulated. This is a distinct
advantage to the Power Station site.
Foundation Problems.
The construction of foundations
was by no means a simple matter and
required the solution of many em
gineering problems, all of which have
been successfully resolved. The main
foundations for the building, boilers
and turbines are founded on rock at a
depth of over 120 ft., steel cylinders,
which are subsequently filled with
reinforced concrete, being driven from

Designed for an ultimate capacity
of at least 180 M.W.. and this may
be extended to 240 M.W., firm orders
have been placed for the first 90
M.W. of plant equivalent to the exist'
ing output of Bulimba “A” Power

The third unit of 30 M.W. is at pre'

The plant to be installed comprises
three 30 M.W. turbo-alternators of
British manufacture with auxiliary
equipment of Australian and British
manufacture and six boilers of equiva-
lent capacity each capable of evaporat'
ing 160,000 lb. of steam per hour,
all of which are being manufactured
partly in Australia and partly in
Britain, An extensive coal and ash'
handling system is being installed.
Coal will be delivered to the site by
an extension of the Authority’s elec'
trie railway siding from Murarrie Rail'
way Station, the tractor power being
provided by the Authority’s electric
locomotives. Waggons will be dump'
ed by being turned upside'down in
automatic coal tipplers. Power will
be taken out of the Station through
33,000'v01t indoor switchgear and a
system of 33,000'v01t oil'filled cables
of modern design laid in a cable tun'
nel over a halTmile in length.
Major Construction
Project.
The construction of the Power
Station is by standard a major project.
In addition to the problems asso-
ciated with the provision of secure
foundations, most of the foundation
works which are below permanent
ground water level—Gibson Island is
only a few feet above high'tide level
—were enclosed within a steel coffer'
dam, steel sheet piles being driven to
a depth of 45ft. Some'idea of the
magnitude of the structure can be
gained from the fact that over 21,000
cubic yards of concrete have been
poured to date. The framework of
the building structure, which is sub'
stantially completed, comprises some
2000 tons of structural steel and over
a million bricks will be used to com'
plete the structure.
The whole project has been delay'
cd very considerably by the post'war
shortage of essential materials, par'
ticularly steel, and by a shortage of
labour in the early stages of construe'
tion. As an instance, the City Elec'
trie Light Co. Ltd., which designed
and commenced the construction of
the Station, found it prudent to go
overseas for the whole of the struc'
tural steel for the first stage of the
building, and most of the reinforcing
steel used in the first stage was also
imported because the Australian manu'
facturers were unable to supply the
company’s requirements within the re'
quired period.
Estimated Cost
£8,000,000.
The estimated cost of the portion
of the Station to which the Authority
is now firmly committed by contracts
which have already been placed is
£8,000,000, and of this amount
£4,000,000 has already been expended
on account of building construction
and progress payments on generating
equipment. All this expenditure has
been necessary before the Station has
been able to produce any power at
all, but the construction of the first
30 M.W. turbo'alternator is now in
progress, and the first two boilers are
nearing completion.
This unit, with the various items of
auxiliary equipment which are neces'
sary to enable it to function, is expect'
ed to go into commission during the
current year and the second similar
unit is expected to be commissioned
before the end of 1954. These two
units alone will increase the Autho'
rity’s generating capacity by 66% and
will add 50% to the combined gene'
rating capacities of the Brisbane City
Council and the Southern Electric
Authority of Queensland, including
the two Package Power Stations which
the Authorities are commissioning at
the present time. By the time this
stage has been reached the two gene'
rating Authorities will be released
from the situation in which they are
now placed where no reserves of gene'
rating equipment are available to meet
contingencies arising from breakdowns
of plant which are inseparable from
the operation of such a complex as'
sembly of high pressure and high
temperature mechanical equipment and
the high voltage electrical equipment
associated with it.
No Super-high
Pressures.
In designing the Power Station the
Authority has made no attempt to em'
ploy the ultradarge units operating at
super'high pressures and temperatures
which are employed in some of the
largest power stations in America and
Great Britain, but have ensured that
the units which they are installing "are
the most economical for the conditions
under which they are required to
operate. Steam generating equipment
will operate at a pressure of 625 lb.
per sq. in., and a final steam tern'
perature of 850°F. The alternators
will generate at a voltage of 33,000
volts and power will be transmitted
from them to city by underground
and overhead cables without any inter'
mediate transforming apparatus.

Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on 6th
August, 1953, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. G. C. T. Brown,
and 51 members and visitors were
present.
The Minutes of the General Meet'
ing held on 2nd July, 1953. were
taken as read and confirmed.
Report from Council.
The President reported that Messrs.
Audio Visual Activities Pty. Ltd. was
readmitted as a sustaining member,
and that Mr. R. R. Palme was admit'
ted as an Associate. The President
•also reported that resignations from
Council had been received from
Messrs. B. M. Austin and R. Griffin,
and accepted with regret. To fill
these vacancies the President reported
that Messrs. W. A. Smith and M.
Craker had been elected.
Mr. Brown further advised that the
Council had extended the closing date
for entries in the 1953 Award for

sisted by Mr. E. L. Freedman, M.I.E.S.
(Aust.). They will demonstrate make'
up technique under incandescent and
fluorescent lighting, and will issue
colour harmony charts free of cost or
obligation to the ladies present.
Subject for the Evening.
The President announced the sub'
ject for the evening: “In What Direc'
tion Is the Fluorescent Lamp Likely
to Develop,” and introduced the
speaker, Dr. A. Dresler.
In moving the vote of thanks, Mr.
W. A. Smith said that it was very
stimulating to have someone like Dr.
Dresler talk to us about the tools of
our trade. As he listened to Dr.
Dresler, Mr. Smith said, he could not
help drawing a comparison between
this address and the previous one
given by the Doctor on the subject
of incandescent lamps. When the
Doctor spoke about the incandescent
lamp, he did so with joy as though
he really loved it and hoped that it
would develop further. Tonight,
however, Mr. Smith had felt that the
Doctor discussed the fluorescent lamp
with some reluctance as though it
were not quite respectable, and as
though he rather hoped that it would
not develop any further.
While sharing this feeling with the
Doctor, Mr. Smith continued, he
thought that the fault was not so
much with the fluorescent lamp as
with the designers who had fallen
down on their job of application. A
similar state of affairs had existed
•after the advent of the tungsten lamp,
and it was not until the fluorescent
lamp had been produced that the de'
signers really discovered how to de'
sign fittings for incandescent lamps.
We should, said Mr. Smith, be very
grateful to Dr. Dresler for showing
us some of the limitations of the
fluorescent lamp and accept the dial'
lenge to develon its advantages by
proper application.
The vote of thanks was seconded
by Mr. G. Y. Falk, who said that it
was always a pleasure to hear Dr.
Dresler speak and hoped that we
would continue to hear him at least
once a year. The vote of thanks was
carried by acclamation,
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Deegan asked the nature of the
colour difference between the Ameri'
can Deduxe Lamps and the normal
fluorescent lamps with which we are
familiar.
In replying, Dr. Dresler compared
the Mellow and Deduxe Warm White
fluorescent lamps with the gas'filled
tungsten lamp. He pointed out that
although the approximate colour tem'
perature of the Mellow lamp was
close to that of the tungsten lamp,
the Mellow lamp had a decidedly pink
appearance. Thus on the C.I.E. colour
chart the Mellow lamp lies on the
purple side of the black body locus.
On the other hand, the Deduxe Warm
White lamp lies almost on the black
body curve.
Mr. Freedman mentioned the trend
towards the use of higher current den'
sities in fluorescent lamps and sug'
gested that the resulting higher sur'
face brightnesses are undesirable. He
expressed the opinion that there was
a greater need for lamps of lower sur'
face brightness which could be used
without diffusing media.
Dr. Dresler said that the brightness
of the hot cathode lamps was of the
order of 1500 to 1800 footdamberts,
which was too high for general use in
working areas without employing some
means of glare control. The “slim'
line” lamp, which uses a higher cur'
rent density, had a brightness of 3000
foot'candles. However, the question
of efficiency must also be considered,
and the use of a high current density
was the only means by which the cold
cathode lamp could really compete
with the efficiency of the hot cathode
lamp.
Mr. G. Brown referred to the low
brightness of the electroduminescent
panel and asked if it could be used to
achieve the same lighting effects as
those now obtained by the use of
high brightness lamps behind a dif'
fusing panel.
Dr. Dresler said that at normal
mains voltage and frequency the
emittance of the electroduminescent
panel was about one lumen per square
foot. Therefore, even assuming the
properties of a perfect diffuser, a panel
covering the entire ceiling would give
an illumination of the order of only
one foot'candle in the room. The use
of higher voltage and frequency would
enable the illumination to be increased
up to about forty foot'candles, but the
greenish colour of the light would still
be a serious disadvantage.
Mr. Falk asked Dr. Dresler if there
were any particular reasons for the
universal choice of four feet as the
standard length of the hot cathode
lamp.
Dr, Dresler said that for normal
mains voltage five feet was probably
the optimum size for hot cathode
lamps as evidenced by the English 80
watt lamp. However, the two main
factors which determined the lamp
length were the efficiency and useful'
ness. The greater the length of a
lamp the more awkward it is to
handle, while the shorter its length
the lower it its efficiency. The four
feet forty watt lamp, therefore, seem'
ed to be a good compromise.
Mr. G. Brown referred to the
opinion expressed by Dr. Dresler that
the fluorescent lamp was not suitable
for general use in the home, and em
quired if others present also shared
that opinion.

Mr. Freedman said that opinions on
the suitability of fluorescent lamps for
domestic use depended on the point
of view. As the style of interior de-
sign changed from time to time, so
also did the light sources and methods
of illumination. He considered that
the use of fluorescent lamps in coves
and behind pelmets was in keeping
with modern decorative trends, and
could be developed further along these
lines.
Dr. Dresler said that the low effi-
ciency of cove and pelmet installations
was, from the lighting engineer’s point
of view, sheer waste.
Mr. McCourt said that much of the
criticism of fluorescent lamps in homes
was due to incorrect application. As
an example, he mentioned the mount-
ing of fluorescent lamps too close to
plaster ceilings, with the resulting
exaggeration of any unevenness in the
ceiling surface. He added, however,
that the decoration of most domestic
interiors was determined by the lady
of the house, and it was his opinion
that if fashion decreed the use of
fluorescent lamps in the home then
they would be used regardless of any
economic considerations.
Mr. Grey mentioned the import-
ance of light and shadow in enabling
objects to be seen and recognised.
He suggested that this factor favoured
the use of incandescent lamps in pre-
ference to fluorescent lamps.
Dr. Dresler said that about twenty
years ago the almost shadowless, total-
ly indirect lighting installation was
considered the ideal. Since then ex-
perience with such installations had
shown that some directional light was
essential, particularly where fine de-
tail had to be observed. However,
both incandescent and fluorescent
lamps could be used in a way which
would provide the necessary amount
of directional light required in such
cases.
In What Direction Is The Fluorescent Lamp
Likely to Develop
By Dr. A. DRESLER.
Precis of a Lecture delivered before
of Australia, N.S.W.,
The aspects of fluorescent lamp de-
velopment and application are so mani-
fold that it would be impossible to
deal with more than a very few of
them in one single lecture. For this
reason the speaker had decided to
limit himself to the discussion of some
of the more fundamental problems
which control the performance of
fluorescent lamps and are responsible
for the still existing rather wide gap
between the efficiency theoretically
possible and that actually obtained.
Two steps are necessary to produce
light by means of a fluorescent mate-
rial; firstly, a gaseous discharge must
be initiated which will generate ultra-
violet radiation. Secondly, a suitable
fluorescent material must be found
which absorbs this ultra-violet radia-
tion and in turn emits visible light.
One of the major factors controlling
the efficiency of fluorescent lamps is
the distance (in units of wavelength)
between the range of absorption and
that of emission. The closer they lie
together, the higher the efficiency is
bound to be, but it must be borne in
mind that the whole process cannot
be started unless the gaseous discharge
produces ultra-violet radiation of such
a wavelength that is readily absorbed
by the fluorescent powder. Unfor-
tunately, the possibilities of producing
ultra-violet radiation economically are
very much more limited than those
determining the behaviour of fluores-

cent materials. In other words, first
the source of ultra-violet radiation has
to be selected and then the fluorescent
material chosen to fit the properties
of the source.
The most economic way of produc-
ing ultra-violet radiation is to use the
low pressure mercury discharge in
which about 60 per cent, of the total
radiation is concentrated into one
wavelength (254 mu). This, how-
ever, means that the absorption bands
of fluorescent materials to be used
must lie in this part of the spectrum,
i.e., rather far away from the wave-
lengths of visible light (400 - 760 mu)
which they should emit. This auto-
matically limits the energy-efficiency
of fluorescent powders to the order of
50 per cent.
Another factor controlling the over-
all efficiency of a fluorescent powder
is its quantum-efficiency, i.e., the ratio
of emitted and absorbed quanta (ele-
mentary particles) of radiation. There,
however, modern “phosphors” show a
remarkably good performance, their
quantum-efficiency amounting on an
average to about 80 per cent.
Since white light, i.e., light of a
spectral composition similar to that
produced by temperature radiation be-
tween 3000 and 6000°K, cannot be
generated with a higher efficiency than
225 Im/W, the highest efficiency we
may expect from a white fluorescent

lamp will not exceed:
225 x .50 x .80 = 90 Im/W
but even this figure is related to the
ultra-violet radiation emitted and not
to the watts needed to produce it.
If one bears in mind that in actual
lamps some additional losses are in-
evitable. e.g., cathode losses, re-
combination losses in the positive
column of the mercury discharge, etc.,
it is quite obvious that our present-day
fluorescent lamps with an initial effi-
ciency of up to 60 Im/W (neglecting
losses in the auxiliary gear) have near-
ly reached the practically attainable
goal.
Future development is therefore
most likely to concentrate on improv-
ing the life, and lumen maintenance
and the colour rendering properties of
the lamp rather than on increasing
their initial efficiency. Reports re-
ceived from U.S.A. indicate that this
is in fact the case: hot cathode fluores-
cent lamps with an average life of
7000 hours were put on the market
there and in England last year. They
have improved cathodes and a remark-
able lumen maintenance, for after 7000
hours their drop in luminous efficiency
does not exceed 25 per cent.
Improvement in colour rendering
remains difficult. Present lamps give
too much green and too little red
light, even in the case of the recent
mellow lamp which is the “warmest”
of all fluorescent lamps. Moreover,
the addition of red fluorescence is
necessarily followed by a reduction in
luminous efficiency which, of course,
is not liked by either consumer or
manufacturer.
Extending the range of application
of fluorescent lamps from the com-
mercial and industrial field into the
domestic sphere will not meet with
any principle objections as far as
utility lighting, i.e., in kitchen, bath-
room and laundry, is concerned, par-
ticularly since the abovementioned im-
provements in life and lumen main-
tenance, once they are generally ap-
plied, should make the use of fluores-
cent lamps an economic proposition.
Considerable doubts, however, were
raised by the speaker with regard to
the use of fluorescent lighting in
living areas of the home, where good
lighting is not only required to give
enough light and to avoid glare but
also —and almost predominantly so—
to create the right -atmosphere. At
present there are no fluorescent fit-
tings available that will adequately
satisfy all these requirements. The
frequently-made suggestion to conceal
the lamps in cornice sand behind cur-
tains is too uneconomic a proposal to
be really successful, particularly as the
colour of most fluorescent lamps de-
mands that a higher level of illumina-
tion be provided to make the lighting
appear natural than is the case with
incandescent lighting.

HOLY MECCA FLOODLIT
IN PALE BLUE.
The Grand Mosque at Mecca and
the Kaaba, a sacred shrine in the
centre, believed by many Moslems to
have been built by Abraham, is now
being lit with hidden fluorescent lights,
soft colours, and vivid silhouettes.
And it has all been done by an
Englishman, Mr. L. E. A. Phillips,
who has never seen Mecca, and never
will —because only Moslems are al-
lowed on the Holy City.
Mr. Phillips, chief lighting design-
er of the General Electric Company,
flew to the Red Sea port of Jedda
and sent out Moslem Agents with tape-
measures and cameras. They brought
him back an idea of his task.
Then he sat in his hot hotel room,
talking for hours with Moslem relig-
ious leaders getting the feel of the
Holy City and sensing the religious
atmosphere of the pilgrimage to
Mecca.
So successful were his ideas that his
scheme was accepted without altera-
tion.
Bronze Lanterns.
The Grand Mosque is surrounded
by six lofty walls, in which there are
24 gates leading into a great enclos-
ed arcaded courtyard.
For this arcade, 225 fittings were
designed.
Each contains six 5 ft. fluorescent
tubes. Decorative metal work on the
fitting contains the one word—GOD
—in Arabic.
The courtyard will also be floodlit
by 28 lights mounted on concrete pil-
lars. Each one will consist of a sky-
blue shallow dome with a dozen 2ft.
lighting tubes radiating from it like
the spokes of a wheel.
Round the Kaaba, there will be 28
bronze lanterns mounted on concrete
pillars.
Seven Minarets.
Mr. Phillips’ masterpiece is in the
lighting of seven minarets.
The side of each minaret which
faces outwards from the mosque will
be lit by two floodlights giving a pale
blue tint.
On the other side, 1,000-watt lamps,
arranged as floodlights will provide
a contrasting background of light to
show the shape and modelling of the
towers in vivid relief.
The entire lighting system, using
200 kilowatts—about as much as a
village of a hundred houses —will be
operating in time for this year’s pil-
grimage this month (August).
But Mr. Phillips will have to wait
for photographs to appreciate just
how successful his remote controlled
designing has been.

IS BUILDING A GAMBLE?
If building is the gamble it is usu-
ally accused of being, isn’t it largely
the builders’ own fault, asks an
American journal.
Aside from the hazards of strikes,
public calamities and hazards which
menace all human enterprises, the
builder should take no more risk than
that assumed by other industries. The
hazards which strew the shore with
wrecks are those which are unavoid'
able.
Lack of accurate cost data, poor
book-keeping methods, poor organisa-
tion, over-extension of credit and cap-
acity, slip-shod estimating and a dis-j
position to take a chance are the fact-
ors that make the endeavour a gamble
instead of business. Technical abil-
ity alone does not make a builder,
but it is one of the requisites, for in
the very nature of things building and
contracting is a calling that demands
high courage and ability; those who
do not possess these qualities are
doomed to failure, the journal adds

THE STORY OF STUCCO.
Extensive Use in Italy.
The general use throughout South'
ern Italy and Sicily of soft stone ex'
plains the nearly universal use of
Stucco to form a complete coating,
not only to protect the building from
weathering, but also furnish a much
better surface for polychromatic dec'
oration than the stone itself could be
made to give.
Stucco, indeed, seems to have been
the rule for the outer surfaces of these
buildings when completed; and it was
only when the hard marble of the
hills of Attica was available that the
Stucco covering was dispensed with.
Stucco is described as a thin, rot'
proof, and fire'resistant overcoating
veneer of masonry, its weight being
distributed over the entire building sur'
face without ilheffects to the founda'
tion. The generally used kinds of
stucco are Portland cement stucco,
gypsum stucco, and magnesite stucco.
Being applied in a variety of colours
and textures enables it to blend archi-
tecturally with any surroundings. It
is windproof and watertight, resists
heat and cold, and has considerable
insulation value because it is a contim
uous, one'piece wall covering without
laps, seams, or joints.
Its proven ability to wear will in
all climates, plus its attractive appear'
ance, moderate first cost, and neglig'
ible maintenance expense, plus the fact
that the ingredients used in its pre'
paration are relatively inexpensive, eas'
ily procurable and universally avail'
able, are all responsible for its world'
wide use.
WHAT IS INSULATION?
On every hand builders are con'
fronted with the compelling fact that
people are demanding insulated walls.
The public has been awakened to
the importance of stopping heat leak'
age in walls; comfort and economy
depend upon doing so.
Consideration of how to keep heat
and cold out of a building calls for
straight thinking. There is no mystery
about it. Insulation is simply a matter
of putting dead'air spaces into a wall.
It is the air'blanket rather than the
material that stops the heat'leaks.
It is the air'blanket that insulates,
whether it be a dead'air space built
in the wall, such as the 2” cavity
brick walls common to Australia, but
not elsewhere, or myriads of-air cells
incorporated in materials like cork and
fabricated products. Solid walls are
heat conductors; an air'blanket be'
tween walls stops the heat from leak'
ing through. The more air, the better
the insulation.

NEW TILE WORKS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
H. L. BRISBANE & WUNDERLICH LTD.
Premier Opens £250,000 Plant.
H. L. Brisbane and Wunderlich
Limited, a West Australian company,
was formed in June, 1929, and pur'
chased a small terracotta roofing tile
factory at Belmont. From that small
beginning has emerged one of the
largest industrial organisations in
Western Australia at the present time,
employing over 700 men in its several
factories, which are spread throughout
the metropolitan area.
Products manufactured include terra'
cotta roofing tiles, glazed earthenware
sewerage pipes, sanitary ware, hotel
and domestic crockery, bricks, refrac'
tories and crucibles, stainless steel sinks,
steel shelving and general sheet metal
ware, shop fronts, shop and office fit'
tings. The company also trades as
glass merchants and general glaziers.
The Premier of Western Australia,
the Hon. A. R. G. Hawke, recently
officially opened a new terracotta roof'
ing tile factory for this company, a
factory which it is claimed is the most
modern in Australia. The history of
this factory is most interesting.
Tiles Extremely Short.
Eighteen months ago the supply of
tiles in Western Australia was extreme'
ly short, and was a big factor in re'
tarding the State Housing programme.
The company realised the position,
and approached the Minister for Hous'
ing and pdinted out that although the
company had increased its tile produc'
tion since the war by over 100%, the
lag in terra'cotta tiles was still acute
and the company’s existing works could
not be further extended, and to meet
the position it was essential to estab'
lish an entirely new tile factory. The
object in approaching the Minister at
that stage was to request assistance for
some priority for the materials neces'
sary to construct the factory; the
company supplied all the necessary
finance. At that time building mate'
rials of all descriptions were very short,
including steel, cement and, particu'
larly, bricks. The Government were
most anxious not to dislocate the exist'
ing building programme and requested
that the company manufacture its own
bricks, but assistance was given in the
matter of cement, timber and other
necessary supplies.
Site at Caversham.
On this basis the company manage'
ment set about designing the new
plant and to look for a suitable site.
Several sites were inspected, but it was
essential to locate the factory as near
as possible to the large clay reserves
held by the company at Caversham,
approximately 10 miles from the city.
Negotiations were finally instituted to
purchase 13 acres of land, on which
the new factory is now erected, and to
also acquire a small brickyard with its
clay deposits adjacent to the present
site. The acquiring of these proper'
ties not only provided the company
with an excellent site for its new
works, but also assured a supply of
bricks for the new factory.
Late in February, 1952, the bulb
dozers were put to work levelling the
site, which previously consisted of a
vineyard. By the end of January this
year, exactly 11 months later, the fac'
tory was complete with the exception
of minor adjustments, and the first tile
press was under test. This was an ex'
cellent performance in construction in
days when building materials were in
such short supply. As mentioned pre'
viously, the work commenced on the
site in February, 1952, and at that
period factory planning was complete
and orders placed for the most up'to'
date machinery it was possible to ob'
tain. During the planning stage a
great deal of thought, based on pre'
vious experience, was given to mecha'
nising where possible every part of
the manufacturing process. This was
worked out by the company’s own
engineers and technical men in close
collaboration with the architect and its
associate company, Wunderlich Limited
of Sydney.
Unique System
of Dryers.
A feature of the plant layout is the
unique system of dryers, which were
completely designed by the company’s
chief technical officer. The design of
these dryers is a combination of many
years of experience under actual work'
ing conditions, and were first experb
mentally introduced at the company’s
Belmont tile factory, and subsequently
this factory was entirely converted to
this type of dryer. The new factory
at Caversham has improved on that
system. One of the biggest problems
in the clay'working industry has ab
ways been that of drying, and whereas
previously with natural drying in
racks, requiring larger buildings and
excessive plant, tile drying took up to
six weeks, the existing system, which
utilises the waste heat from the kilns
as they are cooled, allows drying with'
in 50 hours, with a great improvement
in losses and general efficiency.
The kilns are largely of the stan'
dard type, but certain improvements
in construction have been embodied.
The company has always prided it'
self on its amenities for employees,
and included in the design of the fac'
tory were the amenities for the env
ployees, including hot showers and

proper sanitary arrangements, change-
-1 room and canteen.
Approximately 40 men are employ-
ed in the factory directly on produc-
tion. To lay the tiles, an additional
40 tilers are employed on outside fix-
ing, and employment is also provided
for clay cartage, additional coal, tim-
ber battens and other allied trades. It
could therefore be said that at a mini-
mum this plant provides employment
for at least 100 men.
Dust Elimination,
For the men directly concerned
with the production, every effort has
been made in designing the factory to
minimise or eliminate dust, which is
usually so prevalent in a tile factory,
and also to reduce by efficient mecha-
nisation the monotony and arduous
work often associated with the heavy
clay industry.
The company is very proud of this
factory, representing as it does its first
tile works completely designed on
paper and then erected as a complete
unit. The overall cost of the factory
was .£250,000, but it is felt that this
expenditure has been well justified,
both from the point of view of the
company and for its benefit to the
State generally. The production of
the plant is 3,000,000 tiles yearly,
which is equivalent to an additional
1200 houses per annum.
Lifetime Copper
Water Installations
Noyes Bros. (Sydney) Ltd.
Noyes Bros. (Sydney) Ltd. have
just produced a revised edition of
their useful folder covering light
gauge copper tubing for capilliary fit'
tings.
In the past the high cost of copper
installations, particularly for cold
w ater services has been a main factor
m influencing home builders to use
material other than copper, which is
recognised as being the best owing
to its lifetime wearing and nomrust'
mg properties.
Kembla tested light gauge copper
capillary tubing, finished to close
limits for use with capillary fittings,
is now being manufactured in Austra'
ha and will enable copper installations
to be made at prices within the range
of all home builders.
Cost Saving.
The saving in cost is obtained in
two ways:
(a) The usage of light gauge cop'
per tubing shows a saving of
33J% by weight for cold water
installation and 25% for hot
water installation.
(b) Usage of capillary fittings
which eliminates screwing as
with heavy gauge copper tub-
ing, shows a tremendous sav-
ing in installation.
The folder gives comparative tables
for saving per 100 ft. by using this
light gauge tubing as against heavy
gauge screwing copper.

HOW LONG IS TEMPORARY?
The disturbed period of the war years and between has seen the erection of many
temporary buildings which cling to life with great tenacity, for with the prevailing
chronic shortage of all types of accommodation—domestic, industrial and commer-
cial-it is indeed a brave man who orders a temporary structure to be pulled down
before it literally falls down. This cult is not ours alone, in spite of the fact that we
start at the top with a temporary Federal Parliament House—but is seen in both
England and America from the British Prefabs to the temporary offices of both
World Wars 1 and 11. in Washington's famous Mall. Sydney has an excellent ex-
ample of how temporary" hangs on in the "Tin-Town" Public Works Offices that
we illustrate at the corner of Bridge and Phillip Streets, Sydney. Ironically they
occupy the site of Sydney's first Government House as the R.A.H.S. tablet testifies.
Let us be confident and build extensively and well tor the future and not temporary
structures for the ephemeral present.

ROME'S NEW RAILWAY TERMINUS
STRIKING MODERN DESIGN.
There has been no more remarkable
architectural contribution in the an-
nals of 20th century in Rome than
the construction of the recently opened
railway terminus in the Piazza Gin-
quecento.
This impressive building, which
took the best part of thirteen years to
complete, is probably the most up-to-
date and ingeniously-planned railway
station in the world. It is the work
of six prominent Italian architects who
were faced with the almost insuperable
problem of designing, within the com-
paratively restricted area of the original
station, a fully-equipped modern ter-
minus with a daily average of some
fifty thousand passengers.
While the construction work, which
was suspended for a time during the
war, progressed, the remains of many
old Roman buildings were discovered
—fragments of which are now to be
seen outside the new station. The
ultra-modern terminus forms three
sides of a square with a main frontage
761 ft. in length, flanked by a parallel
range of buildings.
The traveller arriving at the main
entrance in the Piazza Cinquecento
first enters an immense ticket hall with
a floor of polished pink granite and a
canopied roof of glazed cement punc-
tuated by narrow eye-shaped windows.
The main body of the station, with
its arrival and departure platforms, is
separated from the ticket hall by a
spacious gallery, or concourse, with
street exits at either end. This cover'
ed way is bordered on one side by
shops of every description; a buffet
and restaurants.
The twin side'wings of the terminus,
overlooking the Vias Giolitti and Mar'
sala, contain depositories for luggage,
waiting'rooms, a library, customs and
jpost offices. Beneath the main en'
trance block and the central arcade is
an air-conditioned basement with cloak-
rooms and hairdressing saloons. The
entire structure is a triumph of archi-
tectural planning.

The “Spot Mix”
New Asphalt and Bituminous
Mixing Plant.
The British firm of Frederick Parker
Limited, Leicester, England, have an-
nounced an entirely new and ingen'
ious asphalt and bituminous mixing
plant. It has an output of 5/10 tons
per hour, according to conditions. It
has been named “Spot-Mix", and
has been designed specially for patch-
ing work, small road-surfacing pro-
jects and for laying car parks, play-
grounds, tennis courts and similar
jobs. It is a single-unit, mobile plant
of extremely compact design, and em-
bodies many features more usually as-
sociated with larger capacity plants.
These features include continuous con-
trolled feed, continuous rotary dryer,
storage of hot aggregate, accurate
batching, heated double-shaft paddle
mixer or pug mill, and a bitumen
heating and supply system.
The entire “Spot-Mix" plant is
mounted on two pneumatic-tyred
wheels, to be conveniently towed be-
hind the lorry carrying the aggregate,
and discharging the mixed material
lust where it is wanted when on patch-
ing work. Alternatively, it can be
set up in a static position when laying
larger areas, or feeding several scat-
tered jobs. The advantage of easy
mobility will readily appeal, for the
cost of transporting mixed material is
done away with and there is little loss
in heat in the mixed material as ex-
perienced on long hauls.
There are ten main points of in-
terest set out in the “Spot-Mix"
circular which may be obtained from
Norton Tootill & Co. Pty. Ltd., 301

CANBERRA HOUSING
CONTRACTS.
Big Expansion Predicted.
Contracts for £71,267 for the erec-

berra have been accepted by the De'
partment of Works from Peake Con'
struction Co. (Canberra) Ltd.
The contract is the largest for hous'
ing in Canberra for several months.
It is expected to be the forerunner
of a number of large housing and
flat projects now in final stages of
preparation.
Provided finance is available, it is
expected that at least 400 homes and
200 flats will be offered for tender in
the next 12 months.
Large'scale residential development
is anticipated in Deakin, Yarralumla
South, O Connor, Turner, and Ainslie.
Ample natural light has been the great objective of Rome's new Railway Term-
inus. It is questionable if this has ever been achieved in any part of the world or
at any time in history so effectively as it is here depicted. Loftiness, almost a
forgotten requirement, is something to feast the eyes upon and delight the soul.
The highly polished floors if not rendered slippery adds greatly to the charm
by enabling reflections to be made of the structure.

New Zealand Within Sight Of Self-
Sufficiency In Cement
(By a New Zealand Correspondent.)
Next year New Zealand will be
producing enough cement for her own
needs and the occasional market that
the Dominion has provided for Aus-
tralian manufacturers will disappear.
In fact, the New Zealand aim is a pos-
sible surplus for export, although there
is as yet little certainty about this since
demands for cement are constantly in-
creasing in New Zealand as the gene-
ral tempo of development becomes
greater.
Production at the moment in the
Dominion is* 260,000 tons of cement
a year and imports account for another
150.000 tons. By early next year,
as the result of one of the most im-
portant and successful programmes so
far undertaken by any industry in the
country, the three manufacturing con-
cerns will be producing at a com-
bined rate of 480,000 tons a year.
This amount will be increased to
500.000 tons or even more to meet
an exceptional demand and will place
New Zealand ahead of all other coun-
tries in cement production on a per
capita basis.
For the past four years New
Zealand has had to import cement,
at an annual expenditure of more than
<£Boo,ooo over and above the local
cost. Overseas supplies have come in
the main from Britain, but have also
included small quantities from Aus-
tralia and Japan and some from the
Continent. Shipments reached a peak
of more than 150,000 tons last year
and are still running at this level to
meet demands for big construction
works. Before the country finally
solves the cement problem, the total
quantity bought abroad will amount
to at least 500,000 tons. Imports will
begin to taper off this year as new
plants come into production and
should cease completely early in 1954.
Responsibility for expanding New
Zealand productive capacity to half a
million tons has rested with the three
manufacturing companies in the coun-
try Wilsons (N.Z.) Portland Cement
Ltd. (Whangarei), the Milburn Lime
& Cement Co. Ltd. (Milburn, Otago),
and the Golden Bay Cement Co. Ltd.
(Nelson). When they put their large-
scale development plans under way
some years ago, the Labour Govern-
ment was in office and was actually
contemplating launching a scheme to
build State cement works.
Largest of the companies is Wilsons,
which aims to produce half the yearly
output, or 250,000 tons. The Golden
Bay Company will account for 120,000
tons, and the Milburn concern 110,000
tons. To reach these targets the three
companies have shouldered a capital
liability for new works of between
£4,000,000 and £5,000,000. This,
however, is only a little more than the
sum spent to supplement supplies
from outside sources in the years of
shortage. For the country self-
sufficiency will mean cheaper cement
(locally produced and imported
cement has been pooled for price-
fixing purposes), a saving in exchange
funds approaching £1,000,000 a year
and less congestion at ports.
Oldest of the New Zealand manu-
facturing companies is Milburn, found-
ed in 1888. It acquired the Danish
rights from the International Cement
Co. of Denmark for the whole of
Australasia for manufacturing silica
Portland cement. At that time silica
Portland cement, although largely in
use in Europe and America, was little j
known in Australia and New Zealand, i
The company sponsored tests in 1897 j
to demonstrate the superiority of its
product over imported cement in tex-
ture, hydraulicity and tensility. Gol- J
den Bay is the youngest company, 1
having been formed a quarter of a
century ago with British capital behind I
it (British Standard Portland Cement I
Ltd.). It is now proceeding with a I
scheme to transport cement in bulk
to markets in both islands. A special- |
ly designed ship for this purpose is j
due to be completed at Leith, Scot- j
land, by next year.

New Telephone Exchange Progresses
SCHEDULE MAINTAINED ON BIG SYDNEY PROJECT.
Work in construction of the Tele'
phone Exchange in Dailey Street,
Sydney, is proceeding to schedule, ac'
cording to Mr. Ken Hutcherson, of
Hutcherson Bros., Master Builders.
Mr. Hutcherson told “Construe'
tion” that they commenced the con'
struction of an additional seven floors
to the existing building last August.
(The contract for the first three
floors was placed with Cody and
Willis, Master Builders, of Glebe,
and completed years previously.)
Biggest South of Line.
The ten'Storey building, when com'
pleted, will house what is said to be
the biggest telephone exchange in the
Southern Hemisphere.
Mr. Hutcherson is proud of the
achievement of placing 600 tons of
structural steel in the framework of
the seven floors in the record time of
11 weeks. The building, 150 feet in
height, is up to the limit permitted
in Sydney. The steel work is now
complete.
The work was carried out by Hut'
cherson Bros, while the Dailey Tele'
phone Exchange was working on the
first three floors, and such was the
planning that there has been no in'
terference, through building opera-
tions, in the past year.
Ready in 15 Months.
Good progress has been maintained
during the past 12 months, and Hut-
cherson Bros, expect to complete
the contract in about 15 months.
It is interesting to note that 3400
cubic yards of concrete have gone
into the construction of the building.
Roughtex face bricks have been
used in exterior walls, and the facade
is also of this type of face bricks re-
lieved with panels of cement render-
ing.
The plans were prepared by the
Commonwealth Department of Works,
md the estimated cost of the struc-
:ure is £332,000.
All joinery, doors, partitions, etc., is
being supplied by the builders.
The air-conditioning plant will be
supplied and installed by Carrier Air-
uo. Pty. Ltd. have supplied the bronze
window-frames.

CONCRETE TILES GAIN POPULARITY
NEW PLANT WILL HELP MEET DEMAND.
AUSTRALIAN ENTERPRISE AGAIN TO FORE.
Few of us to-day pause to think that the part of Australia most
familiar to Australians—the suburb—would probably appear entirely
different if it had not been for a chance happening in the 1880’s.
This momentous happening was the
first importation of terracotta roof'
ing tiles from Marseilles, France.
Records show Governor Phillip’s
residence claims the honour of being
the first house to be roofed with these
tiles, but before 1886 tiled roofs were
very rare. The better class houses
were invariably roofed with slate, im'
ported from Wales, the cheaper with
galvanised corrugated iron which gave
a quick and clean run'off and provid'
ed the domestic water supply. Gal'
vanising, by dipping of iron to pre'
vent rust, was patented in 1837 in
England; steel for structural purposes
was ushered in by Bessemer in Amer
ica in 1856, so that modern building
practice is not much more than 116
years old. But we are in an ever'
changing world. We must progress
or perish.
About the beginning of the cen-
tury the vogue for tiles caught on, and
they were imported in immense quam
tities from Marseilles.
Then, about 1908, production be'
gan in Australia. The French pattern
was adopted from the start, and it
has been the pattern, with minor devi'
ations, ever since.
The result was that a red flush
spread out through our suburbs. No
other country in the world—even its
birthplace in the South of France —
uses tiles in such enormous quantities
as does Australia. In 1950/51,
45.500.000 terracotta tiles were pro'
duced in the Commonwealth. But
remarkably, 47,800,000 concrete tiles
were also manufactured in Australia
in the same period.
Is there a swing to concrete tiles?
Prominent manufacturers like Reliance
Concrete Products Ltd. quote figures
since 1939 to conclusively prove this
claim.
[These figures are on the modest
side, if anything, as the government
statistician quotes 50,760,000 or
4.230.000 per month. The year
month, brought the total for the year
up to 60,000,000.}
Ultimate in Tile Making.
To further investigate the claim
that “You Can Rely On A Reliance
Tile,” our representative recently
paid a visit to the spacious new
Yennora factory, which houses a plant
representing the ultimate in tile'
making processes.
One of the most remarkable feature
is the automatic operation of the
plant at vital manufacturing stages.
Here cement, sand, and other basic
ingredients are measured and mix-
ed automatically to ensure unvary'
ing quality and consistency. Pres'
sure moulding is also controlled
by fully automatic processes to ensure
that there is no variation whatsoever
from the S.A.A. Standards.
To conform to this, all specifica'
tions required by the Standards As'
sociation of Australia for interlocking
concrete tiles are rigidly observed.
British Technicians.
The Reliance plant was recently in'
stalled at Yennora by top'grade Brit'
ish technicians with long and success'
ful experience in the U.K. concrete
tile factories.
Mr. H. Halsey, the Reliance Works
Manager, is one of the better'known
British authorities on concrete tile
manufacture. In his considered opim
ion, the Reliance product equals in
every way the British concrete tile, of
which over 122,200,000 wer produced
in 1951.
Feature of Tile.
Before the plant was purchased, the
directors of Reliance Concrete Pro'
ducts (Australia) Ltd. very thorough'
ly investigated many different methods
before deciding on the type and de'
sign of tiles most suited to overall
Australian conditions.
The interlocking pattern was finally
decided upon as it presented an at'
tractive appearance and fully complied
with the specifications of the Stand'
ards Association of Australia.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


All plant was manufactured in
England by Pegsons Ltd., of Coal-
ville, Lancashire. It was designed to
produce the large Australian size of
tile, 16|in. long by 9|in. (overall)
width.
These interlocking pattern tiles
have a substantial 4in. overlap, a posi-
tive, interlocking side lap, and are se-
cured to the timber battens by the
permanent nailing method, univers-
ally used throughout the U.K.
Other advantages are:
• Neat and clean appearance of
tiles when laid.
• Cutting is unnecessary as gauge
can be adjusted to the length of raf-
ters.
• The Ifin. width, deep ribs and
wide water channels of the side lock
pattern eliminates any possibility of
water penetration at this point.
• The weight of a Reliance tile at
lb. is less than that of an average
terracotta tile at 8 lb.
• Tiles are obtainable in eight
shades to meet the general demands
of architects, builders, and public for
tiles to blend with all types of wall
surfaces.
• Concrete tiles improve with age
and do not deteriorate and crumble.
• With these shades the tile roof
can be blended to suit the house.
With seven shades any number of
blends are possible.
• Also obtainable are ridge tiles,
starters, apexes, in colours to give a
polychromatic roof effect.
Firms Co-operate.
The Works Manager, Mr. Halsey,
told our representative that a normal
day’s output per eight hours is
16,000 tiles, or 36 pallets per minute.
These aluminium pallets were made
locally by Whitnal Products, a two-
man firm who produced a better job
than the imported cast-iron pallets.
They are lighter, and are not so
easily damaged, Mr. Halsey added.
The tile-curing racks were made by
Byrne and Davidson Pty. Ltd., Mas-
cot. They were highly praised for the
excellence of their work.
The total length of the factory
structure is 280 ft., including the 190
ft. curing shed.
Swing to Concrete Tiles.
Mr. Halsey has been in the con-
crete roof tile industry since 1945,
but he has been in the building in-
dustry in Britain all his working life.
He said that he was an executive
of the Leighton Buzzard Tile Co. in
Bedfordshire.
In that town, he said, there are
five large companies making concrete
tiles, and most of the population are
tile-makers.
One company is turning out 200
roofs a week. In 1951/52 the com-
panies turned out 1,250,000 squares
of concrete tile roofing, or 70% of
the U.K.’s needs.
One of the largest clay tile manu-
facturers in the U.K., G. Downing
and Co., recently installed a concrete
tile plant in one of their works at
Alloa, Scotland. This plant is sim-
ilar in many ways to the one at Yen-
nora.
Questioned regarding supply of
tiles, Mr. Halsey stated that there
would be no delay in deliveries ex
yard.
• The company would undertake
to supply and fix roofs, and supply
all materials: battens, malthoid, nails,
etc.
• A definite guarantee is given to
fix a roof by a certain time. The com-
pany will quote for a complete roof
and undertake to have it finished by
a given date.
• There are 133 tiles of the Reli-
ance pattern to a square, and a saving
of £2O or more compared with terra-
cotta, can be effected on an average-
size roof.
• Prices are: £5/8/0 per square
ex works. Fixed complete within
metropolitan area £8 per square.
Future Prospects.
Mr. Halsey said he felt there was a
great future for concrete tiles in Aus-
tralia.
“I am sure that the existing
prejudice against concrete tiles is
purely founded through ignorance of
the merits of the product.
“This has now been overcome as a
result of the high-quality present-day
concrete tile produced by modern
methods.
“When we think that thousands of
millions of concrete tiles have been
produced in Europe in the last 25
vears, I am confident that Australian
builders, ever alert to new trends, will
see many ways in which our organisa-
tion can advise and assist them,”
Mr. Halsey concluded.
THE KREMLIN.
The word Kremlin is derived from
the Russian word Kreml, which means
a citadel. And a citadel the Kremlin
was in the days of the Czars, contain-
ing palaces, cathedral, churches, ar-
cades and shops, a throne room, and
other relics of the Romonotf age.
PROMPT DELIVERY.
These concrete tiles, neatly stacked according to colour, await delivery to construct-
ing jobs. One truck-load can be seen leaving tor a home-building project at Pymble.
THE OFFICE BLOCK.
This modern brick office block, roofed with Reliance Concrete Tiles, has earned
much favourable comment from passersby.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
IMPORTANT NEW BANK PROJECT.
Reaction to the announcement by
the Savings Bank of S.A. of its plans
for a new city bank branch and block
of offices underlines the shortage of
office accommodation in Adelaide. Em
quiries for offices and suites in the
new building began by telephone be'
fore dawn on the morning of the an'
nouncement, and kept up for some
time. The bank’s general manager
(Mr. M. J. Moten) said ten floors
would be for letting, but no decision
on allotting space would be made for
at least a year.
The new building, which will have
a basement, ground and ten upper
floors, will be of similar appearance
to U.N. Headquarters in New York,
with a frontage of just over 20 ft. to
Hindley Street, and extending 212 ft.
down Bank Street on the new building
alignment. There will be no windows
on the Hindley Street end, or on the
western side, but the eastern facade to
Bank Street will consist chiefly of glass,
in a new type of sealed'edge double
glazing being made in Australia un'
der licence from the U.S. The cost
is estimated at £400,000.
Work is not expected to begin on
the new building for at least six
months, although demolition of Flint’s
building on the site may begin next
month. Final architects’ drawings will
take several months. The design of
a building which is in effect a high
wall, square on to the prevailing west'
erly wind, has presented special prob'
lems to the architects, Caradoc Ashton,
Fisher, Woodhead and Beaumont
Smith. A multiple type of gusseted
steel rigid frame has been specially
designed to meet the wind pressure
problem.
This, the first office building to be
controlled in Adelaide since the war,
will not make a deep impression on
the shortage of office space, banked up
behind a backlog of more than 12
years of war and building restrictions.
Since the removal of restrictions, high
building costs, combined with rent
control, have held back projects for
badly'needed new office buildings, and
commercial and professional firms con-
tinue to share offices and crowd into
single back rooms in some of the city’s
older “rabbit'warren” buildings.
Hotel Project Abandoned.
High costs have forced the S.A.
Brewing Co. to abandon plans for
building a modern, 34'bedroom hotel
at Finsbury, near Cheltenham race'
course. When the building was plan'
ned in 1946, the cost was estimated at
£40,000, but something like three
times that figure is the nearest estn
mate on present building costs. A. &
F. Tolley Ltd. are, however, going
ahead with plans for a £50,000 hotel
at Kilburn, and tenders are expected
to be called within about three months.
A contract for a big city remodel'
ling job has been let to Peake Con'
struction Co. The work involves the
complete- making'over of the three
floors of “The News” building on
North Terrace, for the editorial and
production departments. Among
other work will be the installation of
a heavy'duty goods lift for handling
newsprint. The work, which began
last month, and will be completed
early next year, is expected to cost over
£50,000.
Another big contract let last month
was for the Loxton Club Hotel, which
went to C. O. Juncken Ltd., of Nur'
iootpa, at about £60,000. A slight
amendment to the design involves pro'
vision for driving a semitrailer into
the basement, to unload at tray level.
Besides containing a 85 ft. island bar
counter, the longest in the State, the
5,160 sq. ft. building has many unique
features of construction. One of them
is the ceiling design, with aluminium
sections suspended from the roof
trusses, with acoustic tiles clipped on.
A striking feature of the front is the
provision of vertical aluminium fins to
shade the windows from the sidedong
slant of the setting sun on its south'
erly aspect. Work has begun on the
hotel, which is expected to be finish'
ed in about nine months. Claridge
and Gunn are the architects.
C. O. Juncken Ltd. have also se'
cured the contract for masonry and
roof work on the new Congregational
Church at Loxton. Cost of the com'
plete job, which is expected to be
about £B,OOO, has been kept down
by the use of voluntary labor, which
has laid the foundations, cut the
Overland Corner limestone for mas'
onry work, and will complete painting
and electrical installation.
The contract for a large city job
Melbourne Hospital To Be Remodelled
CORONATION BLOCK PLANNED.
An appeal has been launched for
funds to finance provision of the
Queen Elizabeth 11. Coronation block
of the Queen Victoria Memorial Hos'
pital, Melbourne.
A sum of £60,000 is required for
extensions and rebuilding. The Cor'
onation block of five floors will pro'
vide accommodation for 123 women
and babies, and provide chronic pa'
tients, midwifery and surgical sections.
The sketch shows how the complet'
ed project will appear.

BUILDING; LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


—a delivery building and showroom
for new cars for Motors Ltd. in Brown
Street, has gone to Wilckens and
Burnside, for about £40,000. The
same firm carried out foundation wo r k
for the 20,000 sq. ft. reinforced con'
Crete building, which will also have
16,000 sq. ft. of storage space for new
cars on a flat roof. The front is to
be in terracotta, with generous use
of glass show'windows. Lawson,
Cheeseman and Doley are the archi'
tects.
Sunbeam Corporation Expands.
A contract has been let for the
first section in S.A. of expansion by
the Sunbeam Corporation Ltd., which
has already begun in Sydney and Mel-
bourne. William Essery 6? Sons have
the £40,000 contract for a 20,000 sq.
ft. sales and assembly building for
Sunbeam products and Cooper Ma-
chinery, on the corner of Torrens and
Islington Roads, Woodville. This is
the first part of a unit which will
eventually be double the size. Work
has begun, and is expected to be
finished by the end of the year. Re'
modelling of the existing office and
showroom building in Light Square is
expected to begin early next year.
The first contract in work which
will eventually total over £400,000
has been let, in the shape of a £6,500
contract for a master’s house and care'
taker s cottage for Immanual College,
to be built on 50 acres of land at
Camden Park. Elsdon Brothers, of
York ,are the contractors. The in'
tention is to place som.eone in resi'
dence to look after the ground during
latter stages of the work. Tenders
will be called next for two two'Storey
dormitory blocks, and later plans in'
elude a dining hall, kitchen, stores,
laundries, single'Storey domestic staff
block and two'Storey classroom block,
accommodating in all 200 students.
Dean W. Berry and Gilbert are the ar'
chitects.
An £18,394 contract for the new
Keith Hospital has been let to A W
Baulderstone Ltd. The hospital, of 14
beds, will be built mainly of Mt. Gam'
bier stone* and is expected to be com'
pleted within about a year. Gordon
C. Brown is the architect.
William Essery 6? Sons have the
contract for a £6,000 shop and amen'
ities building in Hanson Street, city,
for Amscol Ltd. The work involves
the remodelling of an old building ad'
jacent to the firm’s dairy produce and
ice cream factory. The shop will sell
the firm’s products, and the staff facih
ities, which include a large room for
staff functions, will release more space
in the factory.
A trend in service begun by the big
new Ampol service station on Anzac
Highway ,is being carried on in a
smaller station to be erected for Mc-
Mahon Rubber Co. at Prospect. This
is the provision of powder room and
toilet facilities for the motorist. These
are included in the new station, for
which a £5,000 contract has been let
to R. V. Mossop. Selby A. Chinnery
is the architect.
A new feature will extend to the
country in the Tumby Bay Soldiers’
Memorial Hall, for which tenders
will be called soon by the same archi'
tect. The building, which will seat
1,000, includes a stage with a wide
proscenium suitable for three'dimem
sional films. Built of local stone and
brick, with stucco finish, the hall will
include a shop at the front.
The first chain store in the “com'
pany’’ town of Whyalla is to be built
soon. Tenders close this month for a
store for Coles Ltd. in the town. The
building, of 33 ft. frontage, 110 ft.
deep, with a 60 ft. storeroom and of'
fice at the rear, will be single'Storey,
of brick and concrete, with concrete
floor, and is expected to cost about
£20,000, including fittings and shop
front, for which separate contracts will
be called.
Tenders close early this month for
a meat and smallgoods factory at
Richmond for R. Conroy. The build'
ing, 46 by 66 ft., will be partly two'
storey, and will include an office.
Andrew Benko is the architect.
Wilckens and Burnside this month
secured the contract for a £12,000
combined showroom and replacement
parts building at Port Adelaide for
David Shearer Ltd., Mannum agricub
tural implement manufacturers. The
new building is expected to be com'
pleted in time to serve farmers during
this year’s grain harvest. Harold
Griggs is the architect.
C.O.R. Development.
Unusual construction is specified
for an office and amenities building for
Commonwealth Oil Refineries at Birk'
enhead, for which tenders have just
closed. The unstable nature of the
reclaimed ground has dictated a “raft”
foundation, with a 5 in. thick reinforc'
ed concrete floor poured integrally with
the footings. The concrete will be
poured on top of malthoid sheeting
to prevent damp from a water'table
only a few feet under the ground from
penetrating the concrete.
Recent State Government contracts
let, at prices not disclosed, include one
to Pricker Brothers Ltd. for building
a dining hall and scullery at Parkside
Mental Hospital, and one to J. Grove
& Son for additions and alterations
at Kent Town Occupation Centre.
Tenders have been called, closing on
August 26, for a new primary school
at Morphettville, and tenders for an'
other at Hampstead will be called
soon. Some big institutional jobs for
which tenders will be called shortly
include a new men’s ward, operating
theatre and X'ray block at Port Pirie
Hospital, a new men’s T.B. ward at
Parkside and additional accommoda-
tion for 300 patients at Northfield
Mental Hospital.
Some big contracts are foreshadow'
ed in recommendations by the Public
Works Committee for extensions and
alterations totalling over £300,000 at
the Adelaide Dental Hospital. Work
on a new four'Storey northern wing,
estimated to cost £156,674, is recom'
mended as an immediate project, with
a new two'Storey south wing, and an
extra storey to the present east and
west wings also projected.
Although the output from the S.A.
Portland Cement Company’s new An-
gaston plant is at the rate of 85,000
tons a year—s,ooo ahead of its
scheduled capacity, cement remains
short, and the first shipment of about
500 tons from Tasmania arrived at
Port Adelaide early this month. Other
importations are being arranged.
Bulk handling of cement, for the
first time in the State except for the
manufacture of ready-mixed concrete,
has been introduced to save time on
the big construction job of Aroona
Dam, which is to supply water for the
Leigh Creek coalfield. Six'ton steel
weatherproof hoppers, designed by the
Electricity Trust, arc carried by rail
trucks, and save considerable delay
at the Terowie break'of'gauge point,
where they are simply swung from one
truck to another. They are unloaded
into a silo at the site, and cement is
carried to mixers by conveyor belt.
Bulk handling by the same methods
is also used for aggregates. Some
Leigh Creek coal is being returned to
its place of origin in the shape of fly
ash cement, made from ash collected
from flues of boilers burning this lo'
cal sub'bituminous coal. About 20
per cent, of fly ash is used in the mix
for making cement for the dam project
at the Adelaide Cement Company’s
Birkenhead works.
The State Bank, which has since
the beginning of the war been build'
ing homes under group contracts for
ex'servicemen, is to revert to the pre'
war system of building homes on ap'
plicants’ own blocks. Only six houses
remain to be completed in the bank’s
last group housing scheme. Civilians
as well as ex'servicemen will be elig'
ible for State Bank homes, which have
been popular during and since the war
because of the lower cost due to
group contracts and bulk buying of
materials.

to plan the village was like being
“offered an architect’s dream on a
plate.”
“Every home-owner will be given
a free hand to plan the home he has
always wanted,” he pointed out.
“We are placing emphasis on out'
door living in the summer by liberal
use of patios (see illustrations) and
by slanting the homes to catch the
magnificent views.
“The village, set in a 500'acre
grandstand, commands one of the fin'
est vistas in N.S.W., and is on its
way to becoming a show'place,” Mr.
Lev added.
[lt has been truly said that “he
best place to find a helping hand is at
the end of vour arm,” and in this
scheme the Legion of Ex'Servicemen
are demonstrating what soldiers can
do for each other, for, taking it by
and large, many returned soldiers have
had a tough spin as a reward for all
they have done for their country.
The Legion of Ex-Servicemen are
to be congratulated on their achieve-
ments and aspirations which we hope
will be most successful.
Every man, who has ever been in
uniform, should join such a league to
lend support to a movement such as
this.}
Turning back the pages, it is found
that as far back as the early 1930’s
the directors of the C.E.L. planned
expansive development of electricity
supply to rural areas of the State in
its South Eastern division, following
upon the creation of the State Elec'
tricity Commission in 935, whose pow'
ers enabled the plan of the C.E.L. to
be implemented. The agreement
which was concluded in 1939 gave
the company the exclusive right of
supply throughout an area of approx'
imately 10,000 square miles in S.E.
Queensland, and at the same time pro'
vided for the acquisition of electrical
authorities then existing in this area,
which included the Ipswich Electric
Light Company.
The application of this C.E.L. fran-
chise was the beginning of a new era
of electrical progress, and the last
fifteen years have been marked by ex'
traordinary development, involving the
introduction of much new capital and
a tremendous growth of the electricity
power'potential of South' Eastern
Queensland.
During the period, the Company, in
addition to its Queensland undertak'
ing, obtained a franchise for the Shire
of Tweed in Northern New South
Wales.
The recent conversion of the C.E.L.
Co. Ltd. into a public authority, under
the title of The Southern Electric
Authority of Queensland, has not in-
terfered with the development pro-
gramme of new works and extension
of the transmission system already
planned, but it does provide for even
greater expansion.
£20,000,000 Assets.
The S.E.A. assets today are valued
are well above £20,000,000, the eight
million pound power house, Bulimba
B; with power house Bulimba A and
Abermain representing more than half
of this sum. The Authority employs
over 2000 workers, and the number
of consumers connected throughout
the area of supply exceeds 73,000.
Truly, the acorn planted by Barton
and White in 1887 has grown into an
immense Oak, with many outstretched
branches.
The wide extent of the Housing
Trust’s activities is indicated in its
quarterly report, which covers the
year ended June 30. During the
year, the Trust built 4127 houses un-
der all schemes —1,000 more than in
any previous year, and the Trust has
built or is contracting to build in 87
country towns.
A five-year dip’oma course in build-
ing is being planned jointly for the
Adelaide University and the S.A.
School of Mines, with the object of
raising the qualifications of S.A. build-
ers to a similar academic level to ar-
chitects and engineers. This was an-
nounced early this month at the an-
nual meeting of the Builders and Con-
tractors’ Association of S.A. by the
President (Mr. R. J. Nurse). He said
the course was being modelled on sim-
ilar courses in London and the U.S..
and would be recognised by the Aus-
tralian Institute of Buildings. Stud-
ents would be full-time, doing field
work with established building firms.
Mr. Nurse said high costs and tech-
nical advances made it desirable for
builders to have high academic quali-
fications.
S.A. SULPHURIC-ACID
PLANT.
A £20,000 contract for supplying
the steelwork for the flash roaster house
of the world’s biggest single unit
sulphuric acid plant being built at
Port Adelaide, has been let to the
S.A. engineering firm of Forwood
Down and Co. Ltd.
Mr. J. Cody, resident engineer of
Simon'Carves (Australia) Pty. Ltd.,
who are the principal contractors, said
the steelwork would be delivered on
the site by January for immediate
erection.
The roaster house, measuring 170
ft. wide (with annexes) 140 ft. long
and 89 ft. high would house three
flash roasters to burn Nairne pyrites,
thus producing the gas which will be
converted to acid at a rate of 300 tons
a day.
£1,000,000 CITY RAIL PLAN.
Ready in Two Years?
Activity at the Quay Again.
Plans have been announced for a
circular city electric train service, to
be in operation by June, 1955.
Trains will run from Central to
Town Hall, Wynyard, Circular Quay,
and St. James, continuing to Central.
The State Government will spend
<£500,000 this financial year on the
Circular Quay railway, and will spend
a similar amount next financial year.
Last week 30 workmen began pre-
paring for a resumption of work on
the Quay railway loop.
(Work on this project was stopped
by the Government last October.)
All the tunnelling work between
Wynyard to St. James Stations is
complete.
This week workmen were engaged
on tidying-up tasks at the Martin
Place excavations.
It is reported that some 800 men
will be employed for the next two
years on the construction of the Quay
Station building with overhead plat'
form.
Other works will include approach
viaducts on the eastern and western
sides of the station.
The installation of escalators from
the Circular Quay level to the over'
head platform, and the demolition
of the old Maritime Services Board
building to permit construction of the
western approach viaduct.

Penalty Clause In
Housing Commission
Contracts
“Rise-and-Fall” Eliminated.
The Minister for Housing, Mr.
Clive Evatt, has announced that con'
tracts to be let for the erection of a
number of Housing Commission
homes would contain substantial pen'
alty clauses, which would operate if
the houses were not completed on
time.
Mr. Evatt said that successful tend'
erers would be required to supply all
fittings and fixtures for the homes.
The contracts would not be subject
to rise'and'fall prices.
”It was recently suggested by the
Housing Committee of the State Par'
liamentary Labour Party that if tend'
ers of this kind became general, the
rate of home'construction would be
speeded up,” Mr. Evatt said.
He added that tenders for a num'
ber of cottages in four projects in
the metropolitan area are to be called
as a trial.
Contracts at present let by the
Commission provide that the Com'
mission supplies the builder with
baths, basins, stoves and kitchen fit'
ments, and contain rise'and'fall clauses.
Ed.—The question is asked: Does
this mean that if a builder, employing
say 10 men at £l5 (£l5O per week
for labour alone) has undertaken to
build a home in 10 weeks (£l5OO for
labour alone) during which time
quarterly wage increases, glorified by
the name of adjustments, have been
foisted upon him averaging say £l
per week per man, is expected to sink
£lOO of his own money into some'
body else’s home because of this urn
expected and, more often than not,
unwarranted increase in wages?
If so, builders had better watch out
for this contingency and include it in
their initial estimates, unless they want
to come to grief.
There is, however, one way to com'
bat it, and that is to sign for the job
immediately after the last wage adjust'
ment, and be sure to finish it within
13 weeks—before the next wage ad'
justment is due.
HOUSING PROGRESS IN
BRITAIN.
The number of permanent houses
completed in Great Britain during
April was 23,262 compared with
17,401 in April, 1952.
In the first four months of 1953,
92,623 permanent houses were com'
pleted compared with 71,010 in the
same period of 1952.
Building Industry Must Police Itself
PROTECTION NEEDED FROM “ROGUE” OPERATORS.
In the last year or two, Master
Builders’ organisations throughout
Australia have embarked upon a con-
certed campaign to raise the practical
and ethical standards of the industry
in the Commonwealth, although it can
be truthfully said by the Editor of this
Journal she has not yet found any
other organisation where integrity has
been on so high a plane as that main'
tamed within the Master Builders’
Association in the whole 46 years in
which she has been associated with it.
Unfortunately, there are builders out'
side the Association whose practices
reflect upon the building industry as
a whole.
This drive, therefore, has been
rendered necessary by an outcrop of
unskilled, unscrupulous, and ungovern'
ed builders who have battened on the
public to the public’s sorrow and im-
poverishment.
Capitalising on the appalling hous'
mg shortage, snide builders embarked
on their notorious rob'and'run tactics.
Some were caught and received jail
sentences; some escaped scot'free.
These men, accepted by the public
on their face value as builders, were
prompted by avarice and greed to de'
fraud home'seekers, and as a result
cast the cloak of suspicion and distrust
over the heads of reputable builders.
Malpractices.
During the recent building boom,
many fraudulent or irregular actions
and malpractices developed.
Among these were:
• Rogue operators masquerading as
reputable builders.
• Poor workmen with little or no
skill, who had joined the building in'
dustry to make big money.
• Unskilled builders who saw easy
money in snide tactics.
These malpractices had an adverse
influence on all types of building, and
timber increased prices, already rising
because of general inflationary trends.
This caused stubborn buyer resis'
tance and a trade decline.
Master Builders Discuss
Problems.
Alarmed at this trend, plus the in'
flux of many impractical individuals
mto the building industry, Master
Builders’ Associations throughout Aus'
traha have been discussing their mutual
problems and seeking ways to better
service to home-owners and improving
their relationship with and restoring
the esteem in which the builder has
been held by the public.
A builder, before being admitted to
membership of a Master Builders’ As'
sociation, must be proved to be a
thorough businessman possessing a
wide and comprehensive knowledge of
design and construction, besides being
a person of the highest integrity. No
qualifications less than these will meet
with the standards demanded of a
Master Builder.
Building Industry
Hurt.
Recent cases reported in the daily
u e r S tcveal that men of mediocre
ability have been operating to the det'
nment and reputation of the building
industry, resulting in financial loss to
everyone but themselves.
There have been reports of build'
mgs erected by these gentry that are
total failures from the occupational
and safety with the result
that their work” is a disgrace to the
name of builder.
Need For Registration.
Some months ago, the State Govern'
ment promised to introduce a Bill for
the Registration of Builders, as a means
ot stamping out the snide tactics of
unscrupulous builders. Caucus had
evidently not been consulted, for to
date promises have not been fulfilled.
Ibe agitation for Registration of
guilders will not cease until it finally
becomes law.
The Government appears to be of
the opinion that such registration
would create a monopoly for one class
of our citizens to the detriment of
many others, although this argument
IS not borne out by architects, elec-
tncians, plumbers, surveyors, the medi'
cal profession, chemists, and many
other licensed men who are all regiV
tered for the protection of the public.
Registration would give the building
industry the right to police itself (as
Master Builders are doing in Western
Australia and, more recently, in New
Zealand).
Registration, it is generally C on'
ceded, offers the best solution to the
problem of the unqualified builder in
relation to the industry.
cai ? best be summed'up in the
words of a prominent Master Builder:
Let us stand on good results only
and not debar any capable man from
doing a good job. Let us have all
the laws possible to promote good
construction and design, but let us not
limit ability.”

Master Builders’ Association
of Ballarat, Victoria
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.
The 46th Annual General Meeting
of the Master Builders’ Association of
Ballarat was held recently.
Officebearers for 1953'54 are:
President, Cr. K. C. Webb; Immed'
iate Past'president, Mr. A. D. Mason;
Senior V.'P., Mr. F. J. Dunn; Junior
V.'P., Mr. K. D. Taylor; Hon. Treas'
urer, Mr. F. H. Brown; Hon. Secre'
tary, Mr. N. M. Begg; Public Rela'
tions Officer, Mr, J. P. Luke; Social
Secretary, Mr. L. J. Webb; Commit'
tee (to retire 30/6/54): Messrs. A.
Luscombe, C. C. Nicholson, E. C.
Sheers, W. I, Chambers, R. G. R.
Cutter, C. J. Kenyon.
Annual Report.
In his annual report the President,
Mr. A. D. Mason, referred to the fact
that Victoria is passing through one
of the most difficult periods of its his'
tory and there is a definite need for
leadership of the very highest integ'
rity.
“Constructional projects, power,
public transport are some of the na'
tional works which cannot wait much
longer for a clarification of this urn
happy position and the blame must
be placed where it squarelv belongs—
on the employer, the employee, or the
individual in between, singly or cob
lectively, and once having determined
responsibility, to ensure that all forms
of extortion and sharp practice are eb
iminated,’’ Mr. Mason said.
Democratic British justice demands
that investigation be open, unfettered
by secrecy and receiving for its solu'
tion, the full cooperation of all mem'
bers of the community.
Whatever the rights or wrongs of
the sorry Hospital and Charities

“Too much criticism has of late

“I feel that this new status marks a
milestone in the life of the Associa-

“One achievement during the year,
however, of which I am particularly
proud, is the renovation of the Ex-

due but the result far exceeds our ex-
pectations and was worth every min-

it a home worthy of the Association.
With the provision also of exclusive

now be more readily appreciated and
administration of the Association will
benefit accordingly.”

“In the Association branch, the re-

one election and the total strength is
55 members.
“The Exchange branch has increas-

at 49. This may also be a record.
With six Life Members and one Hon-

now stands at 111.”
Significant Moves.
“Two significant moves have recent-
ly been reported in “Construction,”
the weekly journal of the Master
Builders’ Association of New South
Wales. The first item was the Regis-
tration of Builders in Western Aus-
tralia and the second was the affilia-
tion of the eight Suburban Master
Builders’ Association with the Master
Builders’ Association of New South
Wales, thus bringing together some
1300 Master Builders in that State.
Both moves have added strength to
Master Builders in their respective
States. In Victoria, affiliation is al-
ready an established fact, there only
now awaits the opportunity for an ef-
fective registration of Builders in this
State, time is running out,” the re-
port adds.
BUILDING IN MELBOURNE.
The number of new buildings sup-
plied with water in Melbourne for
the months of May, June, and July,
1953, was 1,070, 924 and 1,251 re-
spectively.
Research in America
Contribution to Industrial
Development.
Industrial progress in the United
States in coming years will be un-
precedented, even by its own high
standards, so long as the country con-
tinues its “ability to absorb change,”
says Dr. James R. Killian, Jnr., Presi-
dent of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Americans are entering
a period in which the impact of scien-
tific research on their lives will be
greater than anything experienced be'
fore.
“In 1915,” he said, “there was about
100 research laboratories in the United
States. To-day, there are some 3300,
employing about 165,000 persons. In
the past two decades research expen'
diture in the United States have mul-
tiplied over tenfold, and to-day near-
ly 3,000,000,000 dollars is being spent
on research.”
American industry to-day, he points
out, is producing nearly one-half of
the world’s goods, but has only 7%
of the world’s population.
British Building Peak
Highest Since War.
During March building in Britain
reached its highest peak since the war
with the completion of 28,729 new
houses and flats, which has already ex-
ceeded the target of 300,000 a year.
This achievement means that nearly
1000 families were moving every day
out of backrooms, slum tenements,
damp basements and overcrowded
homes of indaws into brand-new prem-
ises.
In Britain today a vast army of
290,000 building workers, not includ-
ing those on the pay-roll of local auth-
orities, are waging an all-out battle to
get homes built
However, authorities warn that it is
no good building homes at such a
cost that people of humble means
cannot afford them. The Minister
for Housing, Mr. MacMillan, also
warned that builders would price
themselves out of business unless costs
were brought down.
Authorities also said it was no good
building new homes when scores of
thousands of older ones in Britain are
becoming derelict every year.
These two problems, they claim,
will need all the skill and energy the
Government possesses, to finallv solve
them.
IRATE HOUSE OWNER
SOLVES PROBLEM.
After building a £2200 timber house
on leased land in New Rochelle, New
York, John Daniels refused to pay a
90% rise in land rental.
Served with an order to remove
the house, Daniels gathered half a
dozen friends with sledgehammers and
battered the house into matchwood.
Thus his temper hurt nobody but
himself when he lost his own £2200
structure.

U.S. Builder Learns
Costly Lesson
Unstable Site Causes Trouble.
There are (to vary an adage) ser-
mons in sites and history in struc-
tures such as in the Leaning Tower
of Pisa.
It pays, and pays handsomely, to
study the site of a proposed structure.
What is the composition of the
ground, what is the latter’s history,
will it sustain the required weight?—
these are questions that should be sat'
isfactorily answered before, not after,
the actual building is started. A test
boring will supply the answer.
Building Settles.
An interesting lesson along these
lines was the case of a two-storey
apartment house in Omaha, Nebraska,
which had a frontage of 84 feet and
a depth of 40 feet. It began to settle,
until one end sank Sin. and the other
end a foot. Heroic measures were ne-
cessary.
The contractors lifted the building,
a brick and stucco structure, 10 ft.
into the air, and saved it from break-
ink to pieces, by sinking into filled-in
ground. Concrete piers were sunk to
a firm base, and a new first storey was
built underneath the two existing ones,
making the building three storeys in
all.
Interior Damaged.
When it began settling one of the
party walls held firmly, thereby
throwing the entire building out of
level, making it impossible to open
or close windows or doors. Plumbing
and heating plants were damaged and
glass was broken. The building, which
cost $40,000 (£A.18,333/6/8), was
untenantable.
Unstable Site.
A test showed the ground to be fill-
ed to a depth of 30 ft. with old
bricks, old asphalt taken from the
streets, bed springs, wire, old cans,
etc.
The character of the filled ground
made it dangerous to send workers
down for fear of a cave-in, so timber
held in place with tubes and jacks
were inserted as the excavating pro-
gressed.
New Columns Built.
The workers went down 8 feet be-
fore reaching hard day. The bottom
of the large holes were belled out to
the extent of a 9ft. square for con-
crete footings. On top of the foot-
ings were poured concrete columns 2
ft. square reinforced with steel rods.
On top of 20 such columns, carried
to ground level were poured reinforc-
ed concrete beams to carry the brick-
work. A new full basement 10 ft.
deep was thus constructed, which in-
creased the building from 10 to 15
flats.
AMERICAN ACTION.
One often hears it said "The Yanks certainly get things done,' and there is no doubt
whatsoever that for energy and application they deserve full marks. Throughout
the country there is industrial and building activity that leaves us—in a city that
has hardly seen a new city building in fourteen years—dumbfounded. From top
to bottom these projects are: (1) New office building in Los Angeles which con-
sists of three 12-storey units 100ft. by 150 ft. in plan that provide 460,000 sq. ft.
of floor area, shops and a parking area for 1400 cars. (2) The Metallurgy Building
at General Motors Technical Centre, Detroit, which is 320ft.x110ft. with labora-
tories and offices along both sides of a central 36ft. high foundry bay. It is air-
conditioned with a high-velocity system. (3) Combined Hotel and Office Building
at Los Angeles which contains 1275 hotel rooms and a 14-storey office wing.
(4) The General Wingate High School in Brooklyn, which is planned in the shape
of a "banjo", the circular structure 234ft. in diameter encloses ground floor cafeteria
and an auditorium with classrooms around the perimeter.

DAWN OF AUSTRALIA’S ALUMINIUM AGE
BELL BAY PLANT READY NEXT YEAR.
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S FAITH IN FUTURE.
Remarkable progress has been made to date on the establishment of
Australia’s newest industry at a cost running into millions. It is the
aluminium industry, designed for the production of ingot aluminium
from Australian bauxite by the Australian Aluminium Production
Commission.
The industry has been established
in the bush near George Town, his-
toric Tasmanian settlement on the
River Tamar, and the Commission has
the technical guidance of the British
Aluminium Co. for a term of 10
years.
Increase in Estimated Cost.
Originally the project was to be
financed by contributions of <£1,500,000
each by the Commonwealth and Tas-
manian Governments, but circum-
stances have since greatly increased
the total sum.
The estimated cost in late 1951 was
£7,250,000, and the increase will be
borne by the Federal Government.
Production by December, 1954.
Aluminium is vital to Australia in
peace and war, and no industrial na-
tion can do without it. Hitherto, the
Commonwealth has been dependent
upon outside sources for its supply,
but after December, 1954, that prob-
lem will be solved.
For by the end of next year the
new plant is expected to commence
production, with an output set at
13,000 tons of ingot aluminium a year,
attained gradually as each section of
the huge plant goes into operation.
The present total annual consump-
tion of aluminium metal in all forms
in Australia is between 12,000 and
14,000, and it has been estimated that
it will increase at the rate of 2000
tons a year.
Authorities believe that if these es-
timates are accurate it will be neces-
sary later to plan duplication of the
plant.
The Bell Bay project, decided in
theory in 1941, arises directly from
our national needs as disclosed by
World War 11.
In 1944 an agreement was signed
between the Commonwealth and Tas-
manian Government, providing for
the establishment in Tasmania of
plant for aluminium production.
In May, 1945, the Australian Alu-
minium Production Commission was
set up to give effect to the agreement.
The site chosen was Bell Bay, on
the Tamar River, some 31 miles from
Launceston and four miles from Low
Head. The nearest settlement is
George Town.
There the State Government has
erected a works township. The Bell
Bay site was selected mainly because
of its excellent situation as a port—
it has 33ft. of water at low tide.
Tasmania was chosen in the first
place as a source of large blocks of
relatively cheap hydro-electric power.
Ample Electricity Needed.
As most people are aware, alumin-
ium, in common with other substances,
is almost as common as dirt. It is
found (in combination) in clay every-
where.
However, extracting it is no simple
matter. That requires its occurrence
in a source material (bauxite) of suf-
ficiently high grade, and also ample

electric power for the electrolytic pro'
cess involved. *
To date only hydro-electric schemes
can produce the blocks of low cost
power essential to the electro-chemi'
cal industries.
Because of its ability to supply
cheap power, Tasmania has Electro-
lytic Zinc at one end and the new
aluminium plant at the other.
Regarding bauxite supplies, there
are various low grade deposits in the
eastern and southern States, while the
comparatively recent discoveries at
Wessell Island off the Northern Ter-
ritory, and elsewhere have raised the
estimated reserves to over 10,000,000
tons.
Building Schedule Maintained.
Work on the Bell Bay project is
proceeding simultaneously with the
construction by the Tasmanian Gov-
ernment of an 80,000 kilowatt power
station at Trevallyn, near Launceston,
designed specifically to supply power
to the aluminium plant.
Preliminary work on the 10,000-
acre site at Bell Bay started a little
over two years ago. Roads and a
wharf have been constructed, excava-
tions completed and foundations pour-
ed, several buildings are almost ready
and some plant has been installed or
is on the site.
The Commission’s schedule is being
maintained, and it is confident that
the first stage of the process will begin
in June next year and the actual pro-
duction of ingot aluminium by De-
cember, 1954.
144 Electric Furnaces.
The production process comprises
two separate sections.
In the first (the Bayer process) the
object is to extract high grade alumina
(aluminium oxide) from the bauxite.
This involves various milling oper-
ations and the digestion of the mater-
ial in large tiers, or vats, at high pres-
sure and temperature.
The slurrV produced is separated
into waste mud, which is dumped,
and a solution of alumina, which is
filtered and passed to decomposers
where, after some time, aluminium
trihydrate separates out.
This, after treatment, is calcined in
large rotary kilns, emerging as pure
alumina, which is stored in silos.
The second part of the process
(the Hall-Herault method) involves
the reduction of the pure alumina to
metallic aluminium. For this purpose
144 electric furnaces are being install-
ed, 48 in each of three buildings 1150
ft. long.
These furnaces will require 32,000
kilowatts—sufficient to supply a small
town.
The alternating current drawn from
Trevallyn will be converted to direct
current by a battery of 14 mercury
arc rectifiers.
Each furnace will be constructed of
brick lined with carbon blocks and
filled with cryolite, a fluoride of alu'
minium and sodium found in quantity
in its natural state only in Greenland.
Reduced in such furnaces, the aim
mina yields up its aluminium (which
is removed by tapping at intervals)
and cast it into ingot form.
The process is continuous, and will
operate 24 hours a day, seven days
a week.
The alumina plant will use about
50.000 tons of bauxite a year, and
the reduction plant will produce
13.000 tons of aluminium.
The electric furnaces employ Sodcr'
berg continuous electrodes, consisting
of carbon paste in an aluminium
sheath, which are consumed in the
process.
For their replacement a complete
carbon paste plant is being built. Its
raw material is oil coke, a byproduct
of the fractional distillation of crude
oil. The oil coke will be brought
from the U.S.A.
Later Extensions.
Besides the production of ingot
aluminium, the Bell Bay plant may
later be extended to embrace associ'
ated activities —the making of alloys,
the rolling of sheet aluminium, and
its fabrication, and even perhaps the
establishment of an aircraft industry.
Plans for doubling the present
plant, if consumption warrants it, in-
dicate the Commission’s readiness to
deal with future needs for expansion.
THE EVER-RECURRING
QUESTION.
Was the last word on incentives, in
the widest sense of that term, said by
Tiberius, a Roman emperor?
“Industry will languish and idleness
will be encouraged if a man has noth-
mg to fear and nothing to hope from
himself: everyone will indolently ex-
pect help from others: useless to him'
self and a burden to the State.”
Tiberius lived from 42 B.C. to A.D.
37. Though an emperor, he was not
without democratic ideas. It is record'
ed that under his administration,
“soldiers, governors, and officials of
all kind were kept in wholesome dread
of vengeance if they oppressed their
inferiors.”

Colourful Homes of Asbestos Cement
MODERN PAINTS ARE DURABLE, ECONOMICAL, EASY TO APPLY.
It is pleasing to observe that the
modern and attractive types of asbes'
tos'cement homes that have come to
the suburbs of Sydney in thousands
over the past few years, have brought
with them a new and cheering note of
colour to many hitherto drab suburban
landscapes. Dotted in groups here
and there, often in the midst of older
types of dwellings notorious for their
lack of colour, they are infusing
brightness and beauty into many of
our residential areas. Colour is the
keynote in the trend of modern home
design and decoration and the smart
asbestos'cement homes of today are
certainly playing their part in this re-
spect.
These new asbestos'cement homes
in their pastel tones of cream, green,
blue and pink are not only colourful
in themselves, but are reflecting their
brightness in homes of more sober
hues in the same areas. The corrugat'
ed asbestos'cement sheets used for the
roofs of many of these homes, which
are generally low pitched, are also
painted in the modern style and help
to give a further note of colour to
the landscape.
How are these beautiful pastel
shades obtained —are they durable,
and what do they cost?
Firstly, it should be made clear
that it is not necessary to paint the
pleasing light grey surface of asbestos'
cement sheets, either for protection or
preservation. In Sydney suburbs there
are a number of asbestos'cement
homes erected upwards of 45 years
ago and inspections have revealed that
the asbestos'cement sheets used in their
construction are as strong and durable
today as the day they were fixed.
The walls of some of these homes
have been left unpainted, whilst others
are coated with cold water paints which
have no protective properties what'
ever.
Modern research by paint manufac'
turers throughout Australia and the
development of new paint mediums,
has made it easy for the asbestos'
cement home builder to give full ex-
pression to his ideas of colour when
decorating the exterior or interior
walls of his home. These new paints
are easily and quickly applied to as-
bestos'cement sheets without risk of
failure and with the certainty that
their life will be at least as long as
that of the best quality paints applied
to other classes of building materials.
Sealing mediums or prior preparation
are unnecessary when the new plastic
(synthetic latex base), resin emulsion
or cement paints are used, except in
cases where dirt, grease, powdery or
flaking coatings must be removed from
old work.
Plastic, resin emulsion and cement
paints are available in a wide range of
soft pastel blues, greens, yellows,
buffs, pinks, greys and whites. Whilst
most are suitable for brush applica'
tion, others may be applied by roller'
coater or spray. Anyone who can
wield a brush can, by following the
manufacturer’s simple instructions, sue'
cessfully paint asbestos'cement sheets
with these latest mediums for they flow
on evenly, free of brush and lap
marks. If an area is missed it can be
filled in to match the first coat per'
fectly. They are virtually odour free
and dry out within a few hours. The
finished surface is washable and has

an extremely long life when compared
with the cold water type of paints
that they have supplanted. It is claim-
ed by the manufacturers that these
paints are mildew and fungus resist-
ant.
The many advantages of smooth
finish, easy application, satisfaction
and long life offered by these plastic,
resin emulsion and cement paints
more than make up the slight addi-
tional cost involved in their use. If
their initial cost is a little higher, they
give more years of satisfactory service
in return.
It can safely be claimed that
through the medium of asbestos-
cement there are many thousands of
people now living in comfortable,
bright and colourful homes through-
out Australia who, from the viewpoint
of cost, may not have been able to af-
ford to build a home at all but for
the availability of this economical and
durable building material.
The Electricity
Commission of New
South Wales
25,000 kW Walka Station Opened.
On Friday the Bth August the
Minister for Local Government, the
Hon. J. B. Renshaw, switched on the
latest addition to the Electricity Com-
mission’s Interconnected System, the
25,000 kW power station at Walka,
near Maitland.
At this ceremony Mr. J. L. Taylor,
a Director of Australian General
Electric Pty. Ltd., the Australian
Agents of the manufacturers of this
package plant, the International Gen-
eral Electric Company of U.S.A.,
handed over the plant to the Chair-
man of the Electricity Commission,
Mr. H. G. Conde, who in turn re-
quested the Minister to perform the
official switching on ceremony.
The Vice Chairman of the Elec-
tricity Commission, Mr. V. J. F. Brain
and Commissioners F. H. Campbell
and A. W. B. Coady also attended.
The Maitland Station is one of the
four package power stations purchased
by the Commission for Port Kembla,
Penrith, Liverpool and Maitland. This
strategic siting is particularly signifi
cant to minimise immediate demands
on the main transmission lines of the
Interconnected System which are hard
pressed to meet unrestricted demand.
These package stations purchased
in the United States on a “ready
made” basis were not individually de-
signed. Each station represents an
expenditure of over two and a quarter
million pounds.
In the three years of its existence
the output of the power stations con-
trolled by the Electricity Commission,
which supply some 95 per cent, of
the electricity consumed in New
South Wales, has been increased by
50 per cent, and, this winter, unre-
stricted demand of over 850,000 kW
has been met.
The Interconnected system extends
from Kempsey in the north, where it
links with and can feed power into
that of the Northern Rivers County
Council, south along the coast to
Newcastle and through the Hunter
Valley; south from Newcastle to
Sydney, thence west over the Blue
Mountains as far as Orange, Dubbo,
Narromine and Parkes, while from
Sydney it extends through Port Kem-
bla to the south and south-western
parts of the State.
Side by side with increased gener-
ating output the transmission lines of
the Interconnected System have been
greatly extended and strengthened.
This expansion is steadily continuing.
Meanwhile the present commissioning
of the Maitland Station is of the great-
est importance to electricity consum-
ers in the Newcastle area and the
northern part of the State in the in-
terests of securing uninterrupted
supply.
The first two of Maitland’s four
units which comprise the station will
now be on the line while the remain-
ing two units are to be commissioned
well before the end of the year.
Already this year has seen the ad-
dition of no less than 220,000 kW of
power to the Interconnected System,
this addition enabling the bridging, at
last, of the power gap which has exist-
ed in post war years.
Further additions planned for this
year are the completion and the com-
missioning of Penrith and of Maitland
and of a 50,000 kW unit at Bunner-
ong.
The Commission’s further construc-
tion programme includes the bringing
of Pyrmont to its planned total of
200.000 kW, the addition of a further
50.000 kW unit at White Bay, sub-
stantial additions to Balmain and
Lithgow Power Stations and the new
major power stations which are being
erected at Tallawarra, Wallerawang
and, of particular importance to New-
castle and the northern part of the
State, Lake Macquarie, these three
stations having a designed combined
total output of 630,000 kW.
Half Million Pounds
Plan For Oil Workers
Shell Geelong Refinery.
More than £500,000 will be spent
on workers’ amenities at the Shell
£9,000,000 oil refinery now under
construction at Geelong, Victoria, in
what is believed to be the largest
single sum ever allocated in Australia
for a workers’ welfare scheme.
Workmen today are putting the
finishing touches to the most modern
building for staff amenities yet erect'
ed in Australia—an ultra-modern,
streamlined building embodying the
combined ideas of world authorities
on design, colour and finish.
Said Mr. Lewis Luxton, Acting
Managing Director of the Shell Com'
pany of Australia: “This particular
building, on which we are spending
£lBO,OOO in order to provide our re'

cilities, comprises dining, recreation
and changing areas and a modern first
aid section.
“Among features of the building
are glass-enclosed dining rooms, cir-
cular-spraying wash fountains and pas-
tel-shaded shower rooms.
“No two walls of the recreation
halls are the same colour. Each is
treated with a different pastel shade
in the advanced American ‘Colour-
Psychology’ method of inducing har-
mony and relaxation by means of
colour variation.
“The dining areas offer workmen
the alternative of eating indoors in
glass-walled dining rooms or on a
first floor open sun deck overlooking
landscaped gardens.
“A new ultra-modern building for
office workers, costing £90,000, has
2,750 square feet of windows which
stretch almost from the floor to the
ceilings. To further lighten the out-
side appearance of this building, hor-
izontal bands of azure blue baked
enamel replace the usual brickwork
under the windows.
ing used in this office block. Copper
coils built into the floor carry low
temperature hot water and produce a
floor surface temperature of about 75
degrees. This system keeps radiation
loss through the extensive glass walls
to a minimum and ensures maximum
comfort.”
Refinery construction staff, at pres-
ent employed on the site, are accom-
modated in a £250,000 temporary hos-
tel. This hostel already provides the
best “living-in” conditions available to
Australian workers.

Planning Drive in Five States
POST-WAR LEGISLATION SHOWS RESULTS.
The Australia-wide realisation, dur-
ing recent years, that town and coun-
try planning could no longer be de-
layed, inspired very similar legislation
in all States except South Australia.
In the five States, as well as the Com-
monwealth field, the fruits of this
legislation are now apparent.
In New South Wales, the only
statutory plan of any magnitude is
that for the County of Cumberland,
which includes Sydney, but compar-
able plains for the other two great
urban areas, Northumberland (includ-
ing Newcastle, Mai.land and Cessnock)
and Illawarra (including Wollongong
and Port Kembla) are virtually ready
for submission. Within the County
of Cumberland, the City of Sydney
Scheme has been exhiibted and the
Nepean District Scheme is in the
hands of the Minister. In other parts
of the State, some thirty-five local
authorities are completing their plans.
Queensland, which alone of all the
States had comprehensive planning
legislation before the war, produced a
Greater Brisbane plan as early as
1944. This scheme is still administer-
ed under interim development powers.
Since then, schemes have been ap-
proved for five other cities and towns,
eight others have been completed and
twenty-five more are being prepared.
In Victoria, main interest is at pre-
sent centred upon the plan for the
Metropolitan Area of Melbourne, due
to be completed this month and ex-
hibited in July. However, work in
other areas has gone on steadily since
the Town Planning Act was passed in
1944, so that 50 municipalities of a
total of 198 are preparing individual
schemes, while another 42 are em-
braced within the Metropolitan Plan.
On this basis, more than 1,500,000
of Victoria’s 2,200,000 population are
within areas covered by planning
schemes.
Western Australia, after persistent
efforts to establish planning on a satis-
factory basis, referred the matter to a
;Select Committee in 1951. As a re-
sult of its findings, a Town Planning
Commissioner has been appointed, and
a distinguished overseas planner en-
gaged as Consultant on the planning
of Perth. A comprehensive plan had
been prepared for Fremantle in 1950
and eleven other towns had adopted
zoning schemes.
The Tasmanian Government passed
a Town Planning Act in 1944 and im-
mediately embarked upon State-wide
activity. A plan for Hobart was pro-
duced in 1947 and, by 1952, no less
than 31 of the State’s 49 local autho-
rities were working on schemes, five
of which had been approved. In ad-
dition, plans had been completed for
the most important of the State’s
regions.
The Commonwealth Government, in
addition to its leadership in the
regional planning field, has carried out
comprehensive replanning in Canberra
and Darwin and even in the island
territories of the Commonwealth.
The great deficiency throughout
Australia is not planning activity or
legislation, under which local govern-
ment has achieved great success, but
some clearly defined National and
State plans, on which all other work
should be based.
—“Civic Development.”
FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT
AGAIN.
The above building was designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright for the Arizona
Desert. The Editor of “Building” has
been in the Arizona Desert, but she
cannot visualise that living conditions
there would call for any building like
this. It is described as having “a
monumental luxury inseparable from
the materials themselves which is im'
possible to imitate.
‘This house is modelled like sculp'
ture. Shapes and masses of stone are
combined to form walls, and wood is
used according to its capacities to
form shapes which complement the
density of the stone.” We hope this
will be found to be a fitting descrip'
tion.
Without doubt, Frank Lloyd Wright
is as original and as startling in his in'
terpretations as when he first started.
Cement Pumping
An Interesting Development.
A recent development in the hand'
ling of cement is a hand-operated,
portable pump which is able to force
mobile mixtures of cement and water,
with or without sand, through lin.,
2in. and 3in. hose and pipe lines at
pressures of up to 150 p.s.i. or more.
These pumps belong to a complete
range of cement pumping equipment
new being produced in Australia by
The Power Element Co., Edgecliff,
N.S.W., for use on contracts of all
sizes, for such purposes as putting a
cement curtain into the surrounding
ground before excavating; sealing-off
in-coming water when driving a tun'
nel; filling cracks and crevices in rock
work: underpinning foundations with'
out requiring full access; grouting-in
plant and machinery; consolidating in
inaccessable areas by driving in cement
through pipes; stabilising bad ground
by injecting cement into it in all
directions; binding filling with cement;
mudjacking concrete paving and roads;
and also for providing a convenient
supply of cement for underwater work.
For use on small jobs which do not
justify the purchase of equipment,
Nevander type 153 pumps are avail'
able in Sydney for hire with operating
crew.
WHY BUSINESS MEN
ARE “TIRED”
A U.S. hygiene expert has just
turned the spotlight on 2000 “tired”
American business men. And he
thinks he has discovered why they
are tired. He says:
• They take their business problems
to lunch with them every day, and
they take them home at night, too.
• They think they are indispensable
in their jobs, so they never take a
real holiday.
• Instead of relaxing each evening
with a hobby, the tired business man
knocks himself out once a week with
too much strenuous exercise.
The research reveals that managers
have more ability to stand up under
emotional stress, strain and responsi-
bilities.
That is why they are managers,”
the expert points out. “They control
their emotions better. Hence they
have fewer nervous breakdowns.”
His conclusion is that the boss,
physically and mentally, is usually the
toughest individual in a successful bus*
iness.

Getting Cars Off the Street
A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SOLUTION FROM MINNEAPOLIS.
Twenty-five years ago there were
only 20,000,000 motor vehicles in the
United States. To-day, there are in
excess of 50,000,000 and over
40,000 communities are completely
dependent on motor vehicles for all
transportation needs.
The time has long passed when the
parking problem can be left up to the
individual motor vehicle owner. To-
day, for each 10,000 persons there
are more than 3,000 motor vehicles,
and as a result of parking problems
many cities have been threatened by
decadence and obsolescence.
Here are some solutions to the
parking problem advanced by the
smaller cities: —
• By private enterprise alone —Oak-
land, California, formed the Down-
town Parking Association, This asso-
ciation was financed by merchants and
property owners. They took leases on
ground or purchased the land for
parking facilities. The system has
worked fairly well.
• Bonds backed by meters —River-
side, California, is one of several cities
in which the parking meter revenue
on the streets are earmarked to acquire
off'Street parking facilities. As rapid'
ly as funds were available, these facili'
ties were acquired. The title is in the
name of the city. This plan took
many of the automobiles belonging to
owners and employees off the streets
and left the curbstone short'term park'
ing for shoppers.
During late 1950 and early 1951,
and after many months of weighing
the advantages and disadvantages of
city ownership and operation versus
private, thirty'two stockholders paid
in 600,000 dollars of equity money
and an insurance company loaned
1,500,000 dollars to provide funds for
construction of two open'sided park'
ing decks in the Minneapolis central
loop.
One deck has 535 stalls and the
other has 819.
The new corporation Downtown
Auto Park Inc. is operated by
officers and a board of directors who
draw no salaries. The stockholders
are the principal business interests, in-
cluding in their number: retailers,
banks, building owners and managers,
hotels, savings and loan associations
and a newspaper.
The corporation is now meeting its
cash requirements. By the end of
1952 they hoped to be showing a
profit.
Careless Handling of
Building Materials
Costs Britain Millions a Year.
Careless handling of building ma'
terials in Britain is reported to be the
subject of periodic circulars from the
Ministry of Works, and repeated warn'
ings from the Federation of Master
Builders.
It is estimated that at least 5 per
cent, is added to the cost of thousands
of houses and flats, factories and of'
fices, because of “the foolish foreman,
of the equally reprehensible contractor
who fails to exercise proper control
over deliveries and stores.”
One report contains a graphic ac'
count of what goes on: “Plasterboards
left stacked by the roadside and smash'
ed to pulp by children; bags of
cement gone solid through lack of
cover from damp; lime and plaster
bags burst through being thrown
from lorries; tiles smashed by the
thousand through careless unloading;
petrol drums dripping all night; good
timber chopped for firewood; cement
mixers left running through meal'
times; whole bricks broken because
bricklayers were too indolent to send
for half bricks; copper and lead trod'
den into the mud; nails scattered and
lost by the ton.”
The total loss to Britain is enorm'
ous, the report declares. Proper sup'
ervision would save annually, in house
building alone, no less than
£7,000,000, if this misuse and waste
was checked on mass construction
schemes.
TALKS NEEDED ON HOUSING.
Federal Government Not Satisfied.
The Federal Government was not
satisfied with many aspects of the
Commonwealth'State Housing Agree'
ment, and favoured a “tidying-up” be'
fore it came up for renewal, the Prime
Minister, Mr. Menzies, told the
Premiers Conference in Canberra re'
cently.
Mr. Menzies said he did not want
to see a state of affairs in Australia in
which Governments were universal
landlords.
That would be a shocking posi'
tion,” he declared and added that the
whole agreement required basic re'
consideration.
We want to examine the whole
thing, so that we may form plans on
the future association of the Common'
wealth and States in this field,” Mr.
Menzies commented.

Starts Planning Crusade.
Sir John Sulman was so struck with
the defects of Australian city planning
that he commenced a crusade in favour
of more rational design by his paper
on ‘The Laying Out of Towns” and
published a series of articles on “The
Improvement of Sydney” in 1907. He
was also author of the following
books: ‘The Federal Capital,” ‘Tim
provement of Sydney,” “Introduction
to the Study of Town Planning in
Australia,” and “Town Planning in
Great Britain, Europe and America.”
For many years his books on town
planning were standard authorities. He
established at the National Art Gallery,
the Sulman Prize for mural painting
which is awarded annually and pre'
sented one of the bronze plaques on
the western facade of the National Art
Gallery. Sir John died in 1934.
The Sulman Award.
The Sir John Sulman Medal is
awarded each year from a fund he
provided with a view to encouraging
excellence in design in street architec'
ture. The fund is so constituted that
all buildings are divided into five
classes as follows: 1. Public buildings,

The building and its function must deter-

transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Otis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators —because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in

Striking Exterior Appearance.
The dominant feature of the build'
ing is the tall tower above the en-
trance which is at such an angle so
that the large letters BRITSTAND
on two faces of same can be seen
clearly in the distance from two direc'
tions in Gardeners Road and across
from other streets.
Other features of special interest
are the use of steel and timber and
permanent porcelain enamel facings
instead of heavy masonry construe'
tion. This material does not need
cleaning, which is a big advantage, of
course, in this dirty industrial area.
The letters on the building are also
porcelain enamel.
Canopies for protecting glass against
the sun to the west; simple ceiling
Hnes for the effective use of the night
lighting; careful selection of internal
colouring, taking into consideration
the fact that the equipment which is
being displayed is coloured in very
bright and varied hues.
Office Section,
The office section was designed, on
the one hand, for ease of access and
efficiency of operation, and on the
other hand for good lighting, ventila'
tion and absence of noise. All execu'
tives, of which there are quite a num-
ber. have their own secretaries and
typistes nearby. The General Office
is also adjacent. There is only one
corridor in the whole of the extern
five office section.
All round'the'year lighting has been
obtained by the introduced of a light
irea towards the centre of the office.
The flat roof above the offices nearest
:o this light area serves two very use'
Pul purposes. Firstly, it allows clere'
storey lighting above same in the four
different directions of the compass,
and, secondly, it is an area which,
being enclosed by high roofs on four
ddes, serves as an excellent lunch'
time sunning area for staff in the
cooler weather. Certain of the offices
Pace the Showroom for the salesmen.
The whole of the ceilings to the
office section are sealed with sound'
absorbing materials, which is especial'
y desirable because of the proximity
of Mascot Aerodrome.
The windows to the offices, as in'
deed to the other areas, are aluminium,
:hus eliminating upkeep, which object
vas kept in view right throughout the
design of the whole premises.
The roofs of the offices are insu'
ated against heat.
There is a special sound-proof room
for external and internal telephone
systems, and a film projector and in-
struction room in conjunction with
development section on the first floor.
Spare Parts Section.
This is an area of 120 ft. x 150 ft.,
two bays wide mainly for bin storage
but with other different sections, such
as the main Spare Parts Office section,
isolated offices, counter order section
and double cart dock for delivery and
despatch at a lower level and under
cover. All these sections are lit both
by sawtooth roofs and side window
lighting. The base of this part of
the building is in iron for protection
with asbestos'cement walls above same
and asbestos roof. Spare parts offices
are soundproof and general artificial

Workshop.
The most unusual features of this
area, which is 210 ft. x 120 ft., two
bays wide, are its great number of
sliding doors for direct access from
the tarmac to the working areas and
the specially-designed drainage at the
openings to take care of the tracks of
the heavy equipment.
Its high saw-tooth trusses and steel
runway for the heavy-duty travelling
crane the whole length of same were
imported from England. The base
of this area is also in iron for pro-
tection purposes with asbestos-cement
walls above and asbestos-cement roof.
Because of the low-lying area,
general drainage was quite a problem
and a special pumping sewerage sys-
tem has been installed. Provision,
here again, has been made for future
extension and for the adjoining land
of their associated company, Britstand
Standard Machinery.
The site has a total area of 217,032
square feet and the area at present
occupied is 57,056 square feet.

SURVEY OF AUSTRALIAN
PRODUCTION.
Output Is Maintained.
Australian production statistics re'
veal three important features of the
current situation, states the Australian
and N.Z. Bank’s Quarterly Review.
One is the maintenance of a high
legel of output in heavy industries,
which are now abte to meet most local
requirements; another is the steady
trend of consumer durable production,
although at a considerably lower level
than a year ago; and the third is the
recovery of some sections of textile
activity.
Basic Products.
Figures for Australian black coal
(1,600,000 tons) in the nine months
to March, 1953, were similar to those
in the same months of the previous
year. The industry was satisfying
most local demands, and providing
small exports.
Pig iron output in recent months
has been at higher levels than in the
previous year, but has steadied as lo'
cal demand has been substantially sat'
isfied, the Survey states.
Here, too, some exports are being
made of limited types of steel pro'
ducts. Production of electricity and
gas is generally adequate. Paint pro'
duction (350,000 gallons), has stead'
ied recently, but at a lower level than
a year ago, when the post'war boom
was still apparent.
In the consumer durable field, pro'
duction of motor car bodies has pick'
ed up from depressed levels, while
refrigerator and electric motor out'
put is holding at levels below those
of a year ago, the Survey adds.

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
(By our Brisbane Correspondent.)
As I write this letter, Brisbane is in
the throes of its Royal National Exhibh
tion of eight days and nights. Seven
of these day and night sessions have
passed, and though the want of rain
will have kept quite a number of
country people from coming to the
city, and despite the increase of em
trance money to 4A in place of the
former rate of 3/', some attendance
records have already been exceeded.
During the first 7 days and nights,
619,126 people have attended the
show and paid £80,703 (exceeding
the previous record of <£73,686 for 8
days and nights) to enter the grounds.
On some days when the attendance
reached 109,154, and on another day
when 120,302 people were present,
former records of both people and
money were broken.
It is a truly great display of what
the State has produced, and what it
can afford to purchase in the way cl
machinery to aid production. In anti'
cipation of a more favourable budget
of decreased taxation, and increased
rainfall, everyone is on tiptoes of
happy expectancy.
Meanwhile, prayers for rain have
gone out from one religious quarter,
and in fear of a favourable answer,
the Government is working at high
pressure on the <£4,850,000 railway
department’s job at Redbank, between
Ipswich and Brisbane, in order to
complete the ground work on a site
of 175 acres, where new workshops
are to be built. For the last 7 months,
the preparation of this ground site,
involving the removal of forest trees
by heavy U.S.A. machinery, and the
levelling of the ground, has been hut'
ried, because of the delaying effect of
Continued overleaf.

rain falling upon work of this nature.
Although the railway workshops at
Ipswich, employing about 2,000 men
are the largest, or among the largest,
of their kind in Australia, the great
demands made upon the locomotives
in use, greatly accentuated by their
use —and—abuse during the war while
existing governmental and private
workshops were quite unable to keep
abreast of running repairs, these new'
workshops have become an urgent ne-
cessity. It is estimated that locomo-
tives costing £5,000,000 are in need
of overhaul, arising out of which 30
per cent, of the locomotives, and 10
per cent, of waggons, are out of com-
mission; whereas in pre-war days, the
relative proportions of idle locomo-
tives and waggons were eight per
cent, and five per cent, respectively.
Many compliments have been paid
from authoritative sources to the fine
services the Queensland Railways
rendered during the war —and it
should not be forgotten that nearly
2,500,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen
came to the State during the war —
but it has been at the expense of the
normal wear and tear of over-used
locos, and waggons and carriages,
which are no less prone to fatigue and
strain than are humans at this stage
in a hectic world.
The efficient and speedy manner in
which the ground work is progressing,
coupled with the difficulty of estimat-
ing contract values, has encouraged
the Railway Department in its deci-*
sion to erect the workshops by day
labour. Of course, contracts must
become a large section of the build-
ing costs, as a progressive steel supply
contract for .£415,000 has already
been let. A certain amount of rail-
way track in the siding and work-
shops, as well as a station, are part
of the whole scheme which is esti-
mated to be ready in 1957.
During the months of June and
July, the building permits granted by
the Brisbane City Council averaged
between 750 and 850, respectively.
Although the large majority of per-
mits were for dwellings to cost over
£2,000 each, the permits include 5
houses to cost between £3,000 and
£4,000; 5 between £5,000 and £7,000
one at £9,000, and two at £lO,OOO
each, figures which were never —or
hardly ever —reached in individual
dwelling costs prior to 1938. For the
sake of comparison of the gulf be-
tween the year 1937 when the aver-
age cost of Brisbane’s new homes was
£6OB, an average only exceeded in 4
of the years since 1926, when the
averages were, in 1927, £626; in
1928, £631; in 1929, £631; in
1930, £632 (how arresting is the law

reducing costs in these homes is the
squeezing of three bedrooms into the
94(M00t area of the standard State
home, cutting out walls and doors, and
making other economies in the quant'
ities of materials used. There has
been no saving, they say. Everything
in the house costs just as much as be-
fore, only there is less in them—much
less space, fewer walls and doors, light'
er foundations, inadequate shelter for
the outside doors.
Also criticised is the winning .entry
in the Government’s national housing
competition, awarded recently to the
Wellington architect Keith Cooper.
This provides for a house of 900
square feet, consisting of three bed'
rooms, a kitchen, dining'room and liv-
ing room, at a cost of £2,000 to
£2,200. The perspective sketch shows

out of it into the passage, through it
into another passage 2’ 9” wide
(though the author of the plan calls
it “changing space”) and then into
the w.c. or bathroom. Did you ever
see such a maze?”
Another proposal put before the
Conference was a “Build Your Own
Home” scheme. This had been out'
lined during the previous week in an
address to the New Zealand InstitU'
tion of Engineers, by Mr. F. M. Han'
son, Deputy Commissioner of Works.
It is based on economical use of floor
space, tuition classes for prospective
home'builders, and expert guidance
(occasional) during building opera'
tions. They would be done in spare
time —weekends and holidays—which,
Mr. Hanson estimates, make the equiv'
alent of 90 to 100 eight'hour days
each year.
In perhaps 18 months, the builder
would thus have his house at a stage
where he could live in it.
Though the weaknesses of such a
plan are obvious, owner'building has
nevertheless caught on very strongly
in Australia. It is estimated that in
Victoria alone, owner'builders will
spend at least <£A9,000,000 this year
on materials, fittings and appliances—
an excellent field for suppliers who
can keep pace with changing condi'
tions. New Zealand is similarly fa'
voured by climate, many national holi'
days, and a five'day working week.
The people there are traditionally
home'owners, and not lacking in re'
source, energy or initiative. Thus
such a movement may very well fea-
ture in the “shape of things to come,”
and add its force to the general drive
towards a more adequate supply of
houses.

Although each of these four cottages has similar accommodation-two bedrooms-the planning and
elevational treatment differs considerably. Top left has the walls constructed of either wide timber
boarding or of precast concrete slabs and the roof is flat. Top right is cement rendered and the
plan is broken up considerably to form a small courtyard. The bottom left design has a horizontal
type of treatment to the facades and a gabled roof, while the bottom right has a 45 degree pitch
roof with two bedrooms in the attic-type accommodation provided.
