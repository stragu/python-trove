OTIS
The building and its function must deter-
mine the type and design of vertical
transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Otis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators—because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in
vertical transportation.

Aluminium Awnings give Old Buildings new look
With aluminium, you can forget maintenance expense. Aluminium will never rot,
rust or warp. Under normal conditions of exposure it will never need painting,
but is easily painted if desired. Fire-resistant and vermin-proof, aluminium will
give you years and years of trouble-free service. Consult your architect or
building contractor about aluminium—about aluminium doors, aluminium win-
dows and other aluminium building components —find out what they mean to
your business in terms of long range economy and customer appeal.

PHILIPS Ballasts
The Philips Ballast is another essential component which
maintains the high standard of the Philips Fluorescent Lamp,
Starter Switch, and other auxiliaries. The ballast is used in
conjunction with the fluorescent lamp and is designed to operate
with low power loss and good waveform, which result in long
lamp life. The ballast is housed in an attractive metal container
and is provided with rubber insulated leads which pass through
bushed holes in the case. These leads are of sufficient length
to reach the lampholders. The following types are available:
Type 8099—40 W Lagging Ballast—suitable for use with one
only 40W fluorescent lamp or two only 20W fluorescent lamps
connected in series.
Type 8091—40 W Leading Ballast—suitable for use with one only
40W fluorescent lamp when used in conjunction with an adjoin-
ing 40W fluorescent lamp operating on a type 8099 ballast. This
operation results in stroboscopic correction.
Type 8115—20 W Lagging Ballast—suitable for use with one only
20W fluorescent lamp.
PL 22-54.
... its leadership
in the lighting field
is ensured by a
63 year old tradition
There is a growing consciousness in industry, in commerce, even in
domestic life, of the need for good lighting. It finds expression in
the growing acceptance of Fluorescent installations with their more
even distribution of light, more economical use of light.
Philips, leaders in the lighting field for over 60 years, maintains its
tradition in its full range of Fluorescent lamps and matched auxiliary
equipment.
To specify Philips is to facilitate efficient and economical lighting
arrangements adapted to the needs of the user. Apply to your

COOKING . . . Only gas gives you such even heat at
low cost —quickly controlled at the touch of a tap. Gas
ranges cost much less—are cooler, safer, last longer and
are more dependable. That is why more people in Sydney
cook with gas than any other fuel.
REFRIGERATION . . . Only gas gives you refrigerators
that last a lifetime. They have no motors or moving parts.
This makes them silent, wear free and repair free. Thermo-
static control gives the temperature you wish. Special
reduced rate for gas used.

WINTER WARMTH . . . Only gas gives you controlled
warmth—a cheerful glow that fills the whole room
instantly. A gas fire gives you exact heat . . . turn it up or
down to suit yourself. No work, no worry, and it's so easy
to change to a gas fire.
HOT WATER . . . Only gas gives you hot water all the
time for all the family. You can turn on all the hot taps
in the house at the same time with a gas hot water system
and there will still be hot water to spare. Gas never lets
you down.
EFFICIENCY
is the reason why
GAS COSTS LESS
Gas is the efficient, willing servant in 400,000 Sydney homes. In Bathrooms, Lounges, Kitchens,
Laundries—and in every room where gas can be used—it does a better, cheaper job. Gas gives
you hot water all the time for your bath, shower, shave, dish washing, cleaning and clothes
washing. Gas warms your rooms, does all your cooking, and gives you perfect, trouble-free
refrigeration. The price of gas here is amongst the lowest in the world for manufactured gas.
Despite increased costs in all commodities, your gas company's modem planning and production
methods have kept the price down.

IMPROVING THE BUILDING INDUSTRY
IMPORTANCE OF PREPARATORY ORGANISATION.
New ideas are continually being put forward for the improvement of various
aspects of the building industry. No doubt the Report that in due couse will be
made available by the Building Industry Productivity Team that recently returned
after an extensive tour of the United Kingdom and America will bring forward
many important points.
Those who thoroughly know the industry realise that it has many facets,
having regard to the various units that go to make up its complex entity.
There is the client who wishes to secure buildings for many uses, the architects
and engineers who translate his desires into an approprite form through the means
of plans, specifications, details, etc., and there is the builder whose task it is to com
vert these plans into concrete form. Then there are the many suppliers of
material and the subcontractors who, as specialists in the many mechanical aspects
of modern building, play their vital parts, and finally the skilled artisans and
operatives, without whose whole-hearted co-operation the whole industry is in-
effective.
There are as many ways of tackling this problem as there are problems, but one
aspect that should prove of interest to builders and architects was the open meeting
that was recently held in London between the London Master Builders Association
and the Royal Institute of British Architects, and at which Mr. Howard Robertson,
President of the R.1.8.A., gave a most interesting and provocative address.
“The Architect and Building News” (London), reporting this meeting, said:
“The frank exchange of viewpoints, the give-and-take of opinion, if continued
sufficiently often, must achieve a number of useful things. It will iron out many
small hut irritating problems and differences. It will tend to increase goodwill by
virtue of airing these differences, and it must in the long run increase the efficiency
of the industry.”
An interesting aspect that was brought forth in the discussion was that the
client should be disciplined in the matter of allowing proper time for preparatory
work. Both architects and builders hate being rushed at early stages because clients
have the erroneous idea “that once the contract is signed they should ‘expect
immediately to see gangs of men digging holes in the ground and bustling about.
If both sides agree to re-educate the client on this question and to convince him
that time spent on preparations, both in the way of drawings and site organisation,
is not wasted, it should soon become an established rule. It is quite accepted
practice in America to spend as much time, if not more, upon the preparation of
drawings, delivery and assembly schedules, etc,,jas in the actual erection and con-
struction work itself. There is no doubt that the industry in Australia could benefit
by improvements in this aspect of building organisation.

THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, CANBERRA
UNIVERSITY HOUSE COMPLETED.
INTERESTING PLANNING AND DESIGN.
Australia has produced many
scientists of world standing, but
in most cases their work has been
done and their reputations made
in other countries.
In the past it generally has
been necessary for them to go to
older centres of civilisation to
further their learning and to
pursue their research. This was
regrettable to the country of their
birth and, in many cases, to them'
selves, and so it had been an
ambition of many years standing
to be able to institute means
whereby they could work in this
country.
Higher Research Possible.
The establishment of the Aus'
tralian National University at
Canberra has now made it pos'
sible for such higher research to be
carried out in certain fields for
the first time in Australia.
The new University was
founded to supplement, rather
than to compete with, the work
of the established State universi'
ties, for all its students are gradu'
ates pursuing advanced study and
research in one of the four
foundation Schools of Medicine,
Physics, Pacific Studies, and
Social Studies.
Walter Burley Griffin’s original
plan of Canberra provided almost
300 acres for a University at the
western end of his chain of lakes.
Although the site has been used
for other purposes during the
intervening years, the genuine
attempt to restore Griffin’s origb
nal conception has resulted in the
site again being made available for
University purposes, and the Aus'
tralian National University has
made considerable progress to'
wards its own adequate housing.
The initial plans were drawn
up late in 1947, and building
commenced early in 1948. Of the
original programme of buildings,
the design of which was entrusted
to Professor Brian B. Lewis, Dean
of the Faculty of Architecture in
the University of Melbourne, the
Physics Research Block has now
been occupied for some months;
the Physics Administrative Block
is finished and ready for occu'
pation; the workshop for the John
Curtin School of Medical Re'
search is nearing completion; a
permanent store and general
workshop have been in use for
some months, and University
House was occupied early this
year and formally opened by His
Royal Highness the Duke of
Edinburgh on Tuesday, February
16, 1954.

Building on Ridge.
The site is low and undulating,
with the exception of a well'
marked ridge running east and
west near the southern boundary,
and this ridge coincides with one
of the axial views of Griffin’s
plan. This ridge has been selected
as the position for the main cem
tral buildings of the University,
which are grouped around three
sides of a long rectangle occupy'
ing the flat top of the ridge, with
the fourth side open to the east
and looking across the future cem
tral lake of Canberra. The view
in this direction is particularly
impressive, but the aspects in all
directions makes the site of the
University particularly attractive.

The Inner Court, looking west along the terrace on the northern side of the block. This
block contains most of the communal rooms, and is glazed from the top of 13½ "high radiant heat-
ing panels to ceiling for its full length along the north wall, which overlooks the reflecting pool
and the privacy of the Inner Court. This glazing is factory-sealed double glass with a half-inch air
space between the panes. A start had been made on the programme of shrub planting in this
court when this photo was taken in the middle of August, 1954.

ridge of the site. To the south
the view is across the proposed
future lake to Commonwealth
Avenue Bridge and the hills
beyond, and to the north the
view is to Black Mountain.
University House, in addition to
providing residential accommoda'
tion, is the social and formal
centre of the University.
The principal residential sec'
tions of the building are of three
storeys, built around three sides
of a quadrilateral in the form of a
truncated fan, with a curved
singk'Storey wing connecting ihe
southern ends of the east and west
wings.
The east, north and west wings
contain individual study units;
each of which comprises a study'
bedroom (or, in some cases, a
bedroom and separate study), a
bathroom and a balcony. Access
is by stairhalls serving in the
north wing, two units to each
floor and, in the other two wings,
four units to each floor.
At the southern end of the
east wing a singk'storey wing
has a ladies’ lounge facing east'
ward to what will be a private
ladies’ garden; and a porter’s
flat on the west facade overlook'
ing the forecourt and main
entrance.
The west wing terminates in
the dining block containing the
Refectory, private dining rooms,
the kitchen and staff bed and
recreation rooms; while the single'
storey centre block connecting the
east and west wings has the prin'
cipal communal rooms and the
offices for the Master and his
administrators.
Originally, University House
was designed for 96 senior mem'
bers, but later accommodation
was required for more junior and
less affluent members .There are,
therefore, 96 small flats which are
completely self - contained living
places, with the exception that all
eating is to be done in the
Refectory.
The Refectory.
This formal dining hall is over
80ft. long, 33ft. wide, and equal
to three floors in height at the
pitching line. The ceiling follows
the rake of the roof and shows
the twin concrete frames at
twelve Toot intervals. A small
musicians’ gallery runs across one
end.
Unusual stress has been placed
upon the design and functioning
of the Refectory, which is the
focus of University House and,
indeed, of the whole University
Whilst its primary purpose is to
provide comfortable and dignified
surroundings for meals, its second'
ary use is for all formal academic
occasions.
In addition to the Refectory
there are two suites of small din'

Contemporary
Australian Art.
University House is more than
a hall of residence, for it provides
meals for non-residents and guests,
and it will be the social centre of
the University. In addition, it is
hoped to make it something of a
living museum of contemporary
Australian art. An art advisory
committee, under the co-ordinating
guidance of Sydney sculptor
Lyndon Dadswell, has already
commissioned several pieces, in-
cluding a freestone piece by
Gerald Lewers at the main en-
trance and a terrazzo floor to the
main entrance hall designed by
•Hinder.
Furniture throughout the build-
ing has been designed by Fred
Ward, of Melbourne, and he has
co-ordinated selection of furnishing
fabrics and interior decorations.
The building was designed and
detailed by Professor Brian B.
Lewis and his staff in Melbourne,
and construction was supervised
by the Department of Works,
Canberra. Consultant Engineering
Services were provided by the
Department of Works in Mel-
bourne and Canberra. Builders
were Howie Moffat and Co., of
Sydney, operating under a cost-
plus contract.
Research School of
Physical Sciences.
The next largest completed
building is that of the Research
School of Physical Sciences, and
consists of two distinct blocks fac-
ing each other across a common
approach road and with base-
ment connection. The front block
is for offices and administration,
and is a two-storey brick building
with a low-pitch asbestos-cement
roof. The opposite block is
where the actual experimental
work is carried out, and is of a T-
plan with the single leg project-
ing down the steep hill to the
rear. At the junction of the T
and cut deep into the hill is the
THE FOYER.
The Foyer Is two stories
high and approximately
33ft. square. The en-
trances to the Refec-
tory are on the left, and
the doors in the right-
hand wall lead to the
Coffee Room. Light fit-
tings, which are so lo-
cated to add interest
to the heavily coffered
ceiling, were designed
and made by Brown-
Evans & Co. (Beco),
of Melbourne.

Accelerator, the machine used in
nuclear experiments, which is en-
closed by the excavations into the
hill and by mass-concrete on the
other side. The whole experimen-
tal building is of bolted steel-
frame, to allow for easy alteration,
and clothed in asbestos sheets
backed by wood-board insulation.
The various temporary buildings
adjacent to the Physics School
were not designed by the architect
nor included in the original, gene-
ral site plan.
Medical Workshops.
Of the Medical buildings, only
the workshops are completed,
whilst the School proper is now
under construction to the detailed
design of Messrs. Mussen, Mac-
kay fc? Potter, Engineers and
Architects, of Melbourne. The
Engineering Consultants for
mechanical and electrical services
are Messrs. W. E. Bassett and
Associates, of Melbourne. The
workshops are of similar construc-
tion to the Physics experimental
block, with asbestos external sheet-
ing on a steel frame.
Stores Building.
For general University purposes
a stores building has been erected,
and this also houses a general
workshop with a gantry crane. It
is interesting in being designed at
a time when brick, cement and
steel were in short supply, whilst
no-fines concrete blocks were
available; their low crushing
strength accounts for the but-
tresses at places of point loads.
The roof trusses carrying the
gantry crane are of timber and of
unusual design because of the
exceptional loading.
In the front of the site beyond
the existing main road is steeply
falling land, unsuitable for large
buildings, and this has been shown
as reserved for staff housing; five
houses have been built to suit the
difficult conditions of a magnifi-
cent view to the front and the main
sunlight to the rear. Mr. Roy
Grounds acted as consultant in
the design of all housing.
Whilst Professor Brian Lewis
was responsible for the building
designs and for detail and pro-
gress drawings, the Department of
Works had the responsibility of
supervision and the placing of
contracts, and its engineers acted
as structural and mechanical con-
sultants. Messrs. Howie Moffat
were the contractors for Univer-
sity House and the five staff
houses. John Grant and Sons
were contractors for the work-
shops and Accelerator building
for the Research School of
Physical Sciences, and Karl
Schreiner was the contractor for
the . office and administration
building. J. M. Cassin was the
contractor for the central stores
building, and Grant Bros, for the
Medical School workshops.
The main building for the John
Curtin School of Medical Re-
search has been split into two con-
tracts — the first, for preliminary
and foundations works, going to
Concrete Constructions Ltd., and
the second, for the main buildings
above ground floor level, to Karl
Schreiner.
The following sub-contractors
were concerned with University
House:—
Plumbing, A. W. Robey Pty. Ltd.;
Plastering, Hook Bros. Pty. Ltd.;
Terrazzo Work, Melocco Bros. Pty.

The whole of the interior and part
of the exterior finishes of University
House were supplied by Davison
Paints Limited, welhknown Australian
Paint Manufacturers, with manufac'
turing facilities in'four States of the
Commonwealth. In the main, the
interior decoration was carried out in
“Veltone" Wall Finish, to a colour
scheme designed by the architects.

SYDNEY GRAMMAR SCHOOL
NEW MEMORIAL WING OPENED.
Sydney Grammar School is the
latest of the Great Public Schools of
Sydney to complete new buildings
erected to commemorate the war
service of their old boys.
In recent months we have reviewed
the new Memorial Hall at Cranbrook
School and the Memorial Hall at
Sydney Church of England Grammar
School, while some months previously
we illustrated the new memorial class-
room block that had been built at
Newington College. Other schools in
the process of erecting memorial
buildings are Knox Grammar School
and Barker College, on the North
Shore line, both of which will be
described and illustrated when they
are completed.
Sydney Grammar School is one of
Sydney’s oldest Great Public Schools,
and, although the passage of time and
the growth of Sydney have made
expansion on this site extremely diffi-
cult, it was decided that the new
Memorial Wing should be built on to
the original building.
It is interesting to record that the
foundation stone of the original build-
ing of the school, which was then
known as Sydney College, was laid
on June 26, 18*30, and the centre
block was designed bv Edward
Hallen in 1832, as a stone plaque
testifies. In 1855 the two side wings
were added to the designs of Edmund
Blacket.
Memorial Library,
The recent additions follow the old
design in regard to proportion and
material, but with a simplification of
detail in accordance with modern
times. The building is of three
stories, and the most important unit
is the large Memorial Library on the
second floor. In addition, there is the
Mas.ers’ Common Room on the first
floor and two classrooms on the
ground floor, while the spacious stair'
hall is so placed in the additions as to
serve both the existing building and
the new wing.
The main facade to College Street
has been carried out in sandstone to
match the existing buildings, though
for economy reasons the side and rear
walls are cement rendered, but the
de ail matches the stonework.
Site of Memorial Library.
The Memorial Library is 52ft. long
and 28ft. wide, with large windows
and natural daylight top lighting.
There is a Librarian's office, stock-
room and workroom adjoining. The
walls are green, the flooring red and
rubber tiles, and the ceiling
white, with a portion treated with
acoustic plaster for quietness. Lighting
is fluorescent.
The Masters’ Common Room is
45ft. long by 28ft. wide, served with
a toilet block, kitchenette and study
annexe. It is comfortably furnished
with desks, chairs and metal lockers.
The colour scheme is bright, the
walls being blue-green and the floors
with black and white linoleum tiles.
The Architects were Messrs. E. A.
& T. M. Scott and Mr. Louis Robert-
son (in association). John Grant &
Son Pty. Ltd. were the Master
Builders.
Sub-contractors were as follows:
Terrazzo Work, Melocco Bros. Pty.
Ltd.; Linoleum to Masters’ Common
Room, Grace Bros Pty. Ltd.; Steel
Lockers to Masters’ Common Room,
Steelbilt Limited; Fire Doors,
Wormald Bros (East.) Ltd.
SKYSCRAPERS.
There’s a range of man - made
mountains
Raising peaks against the sky,
Where there’s thunder in the
caverns,
As the subway rushes by.
And in the man-made canyons,
Traffic torrents pour along,
And the sound of many voices,
Like the echo of a song.
But before man saw those summits.
In the evening light agleam.
He had. dreamed of shining
mountains,
And had builded toward his dream.
He quarried in the granite hills,
The rocks of massive size,
And piling them pile on pile,
He builded toward the skies.
He worked in Summer’s sweltering
heat,
And in the Winter’s snow,
When all the world he used to know
Was lying far below,
And he crawled along the girders
’Twixt the riveters and space.
And hammered out the highest peak
And fastened it in place.
And where no one could see him
But the creatures of the air,
He carved a frail cathedral spire,
And set it shining there.
So when the sound of human strife
And bickerings arise,
A harsh discordant clamour,
To the regions of the skies.
And men tear the lovely carpet
On God’s footstool with their wars,
God says, with weary patience,
Leaning down between the stars,
“They cannot be as cruel
And futile as they seem.
For they dream of lovely mountains
And have builded toward their
dream.”

WILSON HALL, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY
MODERN DESIGN TO REPLACE GOTHIC HALL.
Architects: Bates, Smart & McCutcheon; Builder: G. A. Winwood Pty. Ltd.
Work is to start immediately on
the building of the new Wilson Hall
at Melbourne University, to replace
the original building which was des'
troyed by fire in January, 1952.
On the advice of the architects,
Bates, Smart 6? McCutcheon, the
University Council recently accepted
the tender of G. A. Winwood Pty.
Ltd. of £196,108 for the work. It
was also agreed that the contingency
clause be increased by £3OOO.
The tender was the lowest of
twelve submitted.
The new Wilson Hall is a complete
break away in style from the original
building. It will be of light colour
brick construction over a steel frame
and will be 160 ft. by 56ft.
In a report on the new building it
is stated that “the detailed and care'
ful proportioning of frame members,
fenestration, eaves, and brickwork
texture will achieve something of
elegance and dignity.”
The concrete floor of the building
which will seat 1500 persons—will
be finished with parquet. The inter'
nal walls and ceiling will be in
polished timber treated for fire'
resis ance.
Sculptured panels, illustrating the
Search for Knowledge, will pattern
the external west wall. Carved stones
from the old Wilson Hall will be
used externally in the covered way
and south wall.
The 48ft.'high east wall will be en-
tirely of heat'resis.ing glass, and can
be opened up. The end of the west
wall will be of double diffused glass
so that an iridescent glow, rather than
a direct pattern of sunlight, will fall
upon the dais. On the wall behind
the dais will be a large painted
mural.
The total cost of the new building,
furnishings and the sculptured paneb
is expected to be £231,000. This is
£lOOO less than was originally
estimated.

ANNUAL MEETING.
The 3rd Annual Meeting of Vic-
torian Chapter Australian Institute of
Builders was held in Melbourne on
August 31. The Acting President,
Mr. A. V. Jennings, F.A.1.8., was in
the chair, in the absence abroad of
the President, Mr. G. A. Winwood,
F.A.1.8.
Approximately 50 members and
guests were present. The State Gov-
ernment was represented by the
Minister for Public Works, Mr. P. W.
Merrifield, who heartily congratulated
the Institute on its splendid work and
excellence of its objects.
Also in attendance was the Insti-
tute’s Federal President, Mr. Manuel
Hornibrook, F.A.1.8., who later in-
stalled Mr. A. V. Jennings as the
new Victorian Chapter President.
Third Annual Report.
The report by the Acting President
recorded that Tasmanian members
were granted a charter to form their
own Chapter, as distance precluded
them from participating in Victorian
Chapter activities.
“In the Federal sphere, there is oc-
casion for considerable gratification, a

Membership.
The year concluded with a total
membership of 56, showing a nett in'
crease of six for the year after adjust'
mg for the transfer of the eight Tas-
manian resident members to the Tas'
manian Chapter. The figures in each
grade are: Fellows, 29; Associates, 16;
Licentiates, 8; Students, 3.
It is again interesting to note that
of the total of 43 admitted to the
whole Institute for the year, 14 were
received into the Victorian Chapter.
Institute Annual Meeting.
Five members of the Chapter were
privileged to attend the Institute an'
nual general meetings held in Bris'
bane in June. The activities of these
meetings were very completely publi-

ate that it is largely due to his efforts
mat the building project is so well in
hand.
Conclusion.
In conclusion, may we repeat the
-ords of the Federal President from
Ins last report: “The Australian In-
stitute of Builders has been formed
primarily to advance the study and
practice of building and all kindred
matters, arts and sciences, and to im-
nrnve and elevate the technical know-
ffidge of persons engaged therein or
about to be engaged in, the building
ustrv. or in any employment,
manual or otherwise, in connection
therewith. Consequently, the Institute
is concerned with the individual. The
aim, therefore, of all Chapters
throughout Australia should be to
strengthen our membership by en-
couraging applications from the
voung men in the industry. The drive
for membership should be devoted in
large measure to those qualified for
Student, Licentiate or Associate mpm-
bership. It should be emphasised that
the Institute is not a close preserve
for the shomn few. but is open to all
who have the quah'firations prescribed
in the Articles of Association.”
Members of the Victorian Chanter
will certainly follow that advice. We
of an Institute with such worthv aims
are indeed fortunate to be members
and ideals. We must remember that
the more progress this Chapter makes
in the future, the more we are assist'
ing the Institute as a whole to mould
the future leaders of an industrv that
is doing such a vital job in develop'
ing Australia.

AUSTRALIA’S FIRST TUBELESS
TYRE.
Dunlop Eliminates Blow-out Danger.
Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd. re'
centlv introduced the nation’s first
tubeless tyre, thus opening a new era
in motoring safety.
Some important points are:
• The tubeless tyre is a great factor
towards safe motoring as possibility
of blow-outs are virtually eliminated.
9 Casual punctures will be a thing
of the past.
• The new tyre needs no tube yet
retains air 100 per cent, better.
® The price of tubeless tyres will
be the same as for a similar size
cover plus tube.
MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
MR. STANLEY R. MASTERS.
Mr. Stan'ey R. Masters is a leading authority on locks safes strongrooms,
and came from the English Chubb's the parent Company, to jion the Australian
organisation.
He was born at Dulwich (England), and jiond Chubb's at the age of sixteen.
In his youth he was a keen Soccer player, and still follows football as a spectator.
In the sketch, Mr. Masters is seen with the massive twelve-ton Strongroom Door
which was on display at the Festival of Britain. Later he went to Canada (where
he is well known) and sold this door to a leading Canadian Insurance Company—
the Confederation Life Association—for their new premises ìn Toronto.
In fact, in many parts of the world the name "Masters" is synonymous with
"Chubb's".
Mr. Masters was recently appionted a Director of the Australian Company.

BEAUTY BY DAY AND NIGHT.
The Beautiful Church in Trafalgar Square (Right).
Although not one of the famous Wren churches of London, St. Martin's-in-the-
Trafalgar Square, is one of the best-known landmarks in London. With its graceful
Fields, designed by James Gibbs with this fine site in the north-east corner of
spire beautifully floodlit, it presents an inspiring sight.

THE TOWER OF LONDON.
There Is probably no better-known building in the world than the Tower of London, which has played a dominant part in British
history for nearly 900 years, for it was in 1078 that William the Conqueror built the great central keep or White Tower as
it is called. (Lett) Over the years it has served the triple purpose of fortress, palace and prison, and to-day, including the
moat, which has been drained, it occupies an irregular pentagon of about eighteen acres, the circuit of the outer walls being
nearly two-thirds of a mile. In the centre is Queen's House, which is now the residence of the Resident Governor On the
right are the Wakefield Tower and the Bloody Tower, with one of the famous Beefeaters in the foreground.

Glass and You
Although glass has been known for
5000 years, it is only within the last
50 years that its possibilities have
been realised Corning Glass Works,
of New York, has been making
glass since 1877. The research car'
ried on by this company has brought
into being many types of glass for
many different purposes, such as
heat-resistant glass, glass of high
mechanical strength and resistance to
shock. The many different products
made by Corning Glass Works are
described in a well-produced booklet
by the company, sub-titled “Glass
and You.”
From very fragile glass filaments
under one-thousandth of an inch in
thickness, glass for all kinds of
scientific, commercial, industrial and
personal use is described —to the
largest piece of glass ever cast, the
20-ton, 200-inch glass disc for Hale

BOOK REVIEW.
“Acoustics,” by T. M. Yarwood.
Published by Macmillan & Co.
Ltd., St. Martin’s St., London.
Price, 15/- (sterling).
This is a textbook for physics and
engineering students by a senior
physics master, late of Kilburn Gram-
mar School, England. It is an intro-
duction to the study of the propaga-
tion, transmission and reception of
sound. The author covers the
ground necessary for the General
Certificate of Education examination.
The 14 chapters deal fully with the
velocity of sound, its properties and
reflection. The vibrations of musical
instruments of various types, sound
signalling and ranging and, finally,
acoustics of buildings; noise and
sound insulation.
The subject is well covered and ex-
plained, and the book contains many
references which will help the student
to extend his studies, also a compre-
hensive series of questions taken from
recent examination papers by which
he may check his knowledge and ap-
preciation of his studies.
BRITISH AVERAGE WAGE.
The average weekly wage of British
male manual workers, expressed in
Australian currency, was £l2/7/1 in
April, 1954, compared with
in October, 1953, and
£4/6/1 in 1938.
The average hours worked by all
classes was 46.5. These figures were
released by the half-yearly report of
the U.K. Ministry of Labour and
National Service.
THE BEAUTY OF FLOODLIGHTING.
The grace and dignity of Sir Christopher Wren's Royal Naval College at Green-
wich, London, provide one of the sights of this great city that is packed with
architectural and historical interest. By means of the modern marvel of flood-
lighting this achieves an even new beauty as it Is etched in delicate outline against
the velvet background of the night. These two units of the great College are
the King William and King Charles Blocks.
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.
The great pile of the Houses of Parliament and the Thames at Westminster, with
part of the riverside facade floodlit. In the distance on the top of the dark bulk
can be seen the twin towers of Westminster Abbey, also bathed in light.
BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
Some of the most historic scenes of our times have taken place outside Bucking-
ham Palace, London, as the citizens of London in joy and grief have gathered in
their thousands to pay tribute to their Kings and Queens. It was designed in 1825
by John Nash, the main facade being reconstructed in 1913 by Sir Aston Webb.
The gardens and lake at the rear cover about 40 acres.

Illuminating Engineering Society Honours Mrs Florence M. Taylor
HONORARY MEMBERSHIP CONFERRED.
The Illuminating Engineering So'
ciety of Australia (N.S.W. Section)
has conferred Honorary Membership
upon Mrs. Florence M. Taylor, Editor
of this publication. It is a particu'
larly outstanding honour, for it is
only the second occasion upon which
the Society has taken this action, the
first being to Mr. A. P. Turnbull,
Foundation President of the Society.
The presentation was made by the
President, Mr. G. Y. Falk, at a small
informal gathering of Councillors in
the office of Mr. Ernest Freedman,
the Immediate Past President, at
Condor Lamps (A/sia) Pty. Ltd.,
Clarence St., Sydney, on October 6.
Mr. Falk, in making the presenta'
tion, said:—
“The purpose of this function to'
day is formally to grant Honorary
Membership of the Illuminating Em
gineering Society of Australia, N.S.W.
Branch, to Mrs. Florence M. Taylor.
“However, I feel that although
many of us are familiar with Mrs.
Taylor’s activities in the community
as a leading citizen, I think k would
be appropriate to give a brief resume
of her outstanding contributions to
the life of this community.
“Mrs. Taylor was the first woman
architect to be registered in Australia,
having served her articles and quali'
fied from the Technical College. On
her marriage to her late husband, they
commenced the publication ‘Build'
ing,’ which has now had an uninter'
rupted history of 46 years.
“Mrs. Taylor worked with her
husband in the production of their
engineering and architectural jour'
nals until 1928 when, on his death,
she gave up all other activities to
dedicate her life to carry on the pub'
lication of these journals, ‘Building:
Lighting: Engineering,’ ‘The Austral'
asian Engineer,’ and ‘Construction.’
“Mrs. Taylor has also taken a very
active part in music and art, and was
the Founder and President of the Arts
Club for many years; she has raised
considerable moneys on committees to
send singers and artists abroad. Her
other public interests have included
Town Planning, and the Town Plan'
ning Association of N.S.W. was
founded by her and her husband.
Mrs. Taylor appeared in the Honours
List just before the War, and was the
recipient of the 0.8. E.
“The LE.S. has always been aware
of the value of Mrs. Taylor’s interest
in lighting, and we are proud to have
our articles and activities of the So'
ciety appearing in the ‘Building:
Lighting: Engineering’ manual.
“The Society has received favour'
able comments from its overseas sister
organisations on the presentation and
printing of our articles. At our last
Annual General Meeting the following
resolution was passed:—
“ ‘On the motion of Mr. Williams,
seconded by Mr. McCourt. it was re'
solved that this Meeting desires to
convey its appreciation to the pub'
lishers of. “Building: Lighting: Em
gineering’’ for the opportunity of
reading papers delivered before the
Society in this journal by conferring
Honorary Membership upon its
Editor.’
“In granting Mrs. Taylor Honorary
Membership of our Society, I would
like to point out that this honour has
only been granted twice in the history
of the Society, which covers a period
of 24 years.
“The previous recipient was Mr.
A. P. Turnbull, who was the first
President of the Society in 1930. He
received Honorary Membership in
1945.
“It gives me very much pleasure,
on behalf of the Society, to hand you
this letter which contains the resolu'
tion passed by the Council.”
(The letter is reproduced on
opposite page.)
Mrs. Taylor’s Thanks.
Mrs. Taylor, in thanking the PresL
dent of the Society for their kindness,
said: —
“I am overwhelmed by your kind'
ness in considering me worthy of the
honour you have conferred upon me.
I hope as time goes on I may prove
myself worthy of it.
“You know I am a very fortunate
woman, in that since my father died
56 years ago I have had to work for
my living and that has made life
bristle with interest. Then I married
the kindest man in the world. Most
of you who knew George Taylor
would echo ‘and the cleverest’-
Architect, Engineer, Survey Drafts'
man, Geologist, Astromer, Soldier
(he taught map'making and map'
reading to soldiers in camp). Cartoon'
ist, Poet, Writer. He dabbled in
wireless, aviation, and other things.
But. being a woman, I remember him
mostly for his kindness. He placed
woman on a pedestal—it wouldn’t
matter if it were a cleaner or a queen.
“After he died we experienced a
depression, and I tried to carry on.
On one occasion I went out for three
months, doing my own travelling, and
never signed a penn’orth of business.
I did not regard this as wasted time.
It was like your Edison, who was
quipped about wasted time in having
5000 failures in trying to get a lamp
to light. He replied: “That was not
time wasted. I now know 5000 ways
that lamps will not light.’ So I re'
garded this as time well spent in
listening to the problems of the
merchants I called upon.
“It was a humanising experience.
But one doesn’t have to go far to
seek this. At the present time my two
fine offices are being converted into
five smaller units. Six workmen over
Saturday, Sunday and Monday (the
holiday) erected partitions. I saw one
carpenter using a power saw cutting a
window architrave in halves vertically.
As soon as he got half-way up, one
of the others, seeing that he was get'
ting near his height level, leapt on to
a trestle and carried it upwards to
completion. Then, at lunch'time, on
Sunday, one came without his
lunch. One of the other men said,.
‘You can have half of mine, if you
like.’ Perhaps these acts may not be
regarded as much outwardly, but I
think that in the hearts of men of
this calibre we are very near to God.
“I thank you once more for this
recognition of my services, and I am
glad you included members of my
staffs upon whom I depend very
much. It has always been our pleasure
to render this service.’’
Mr. Falk was supported by Mr.
Ernest Freedman, who paid tribute to-

ATOMIC POWER FOR AUSTRALIA
Delivered before The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia (N.S.W.)
by John M. Blatt* on October 7th, 1954.
With the establishment of an
Atomic Energy Commission some two
years ago, the Government of Aus'
tralia has announced its decision to
embark on a programme of using the
uranium resources of this country to
benefit the Australian people. The
subsequent official announcements as
well as much public discussion have
shown that one of the most important
likely benefits is economic nuclear
power for the generation of electricity.
I would like to comment to'day on the
problems involved in formulating a
policy to deal with this problem, and
to give you my view of what a reason'
able policy might be. I believe strong
lv that there has not been as yet suT
ficient public discussion of matters
which may seriously influence the em
tire future of Australia: if my remarks
help in initiating such discussion. I
shall feel that I have accomplished
which I set out to do.
At first sight the problem of de'
veloping nuclear power generating
equipment for use in Australia is iust
another production problem. Australia
is just another production problem.
Australia can develop the machinery
herself, starting from scratch; she can
buy it from abroad, ready'made; or she
can adopt some kind of indbetwe'en
course. Which course to adopt ap'
pears to be a purely technical prob'
lem, to be decided on the basis of
comparative costs.
Problems To Be Solved.
However, this is far from the actual
situation. The nuclear power problem
is complicated by several factors: (1)
First is the problem of secrecy and the
tie'Up with military applications of
atomic energy; this means that, no
matter who does the actual nuclear
power work, the Government cannot
keep itself aloof from this field; even
if private companies do the lions’
share of the work, the Government
must insist on being closely informed
of all developments, and generally the
role of the Federal Government in
this field is likely to continue to be
much more important than in other
areas of power generation. (2) The
technology of nuclear power genera'
fion is still in an early stage; the field
is changing rapidly, new inventions
are being made continually, the
methods of last year are already ob'
solete, and there is every likelihood
that to'day’s methods will be obsolete
a year hence. (3) As a result of this
state of flux, it is virtually impossible
to make any realistic estimate of the
comparative costs of nuclear power and
estimates is indicated most strikingly
by the fact that, two years ago, the
U.S.A.E.C. found it necessary to issue
an official caution against over'
optimism in this field, and to'day the
same agency is issuing optimistic state'
ments forecasting economically com'
petitive nuclear power within the next
decade. All we can be sure of is that
any cost estimates based on the most
advanced nuclear power technology of
to-day are over-estimates of the true
eventual cost, and it is highly likely
that they are very bad over'estimates,
much too high. (4) While research
and development work in this field
seems obviously desirable, it is im'
neded both bv the high cost of secur'
ing the nece c< =ary facilities and person'
nek ?nd bv the secrecy barriers which
have been erected between nations, and
between scientists within the same
nation. (5) The problem is so big
compared to Australian resources that
outside assistance of some form will
be required, especially in regard to
technical knowledge.
I have painted a rather black pic'
ture, and I have no intention of mini'
mining the difficulties which we face
here. Yet it is clear that some sort
of policy must be evolved to deal with
these problems: Australia cannot afford
to simply sit back and do nothing.

tributed. Coal and water power are
totally absent from large areas of the
country. Thus Australia cannot af-
ford to overlook the possibilities of a
form of power generation in which
the cost of transportation of the fuel
from its source to the power plant is
a completely negligible factor in the
overall cost.
Let us see, therefore, what might be
the ingredients of a reasonable policy
in this field. Before discussing the
policy itself, we must make sure that
we agree on its ultimate aims. I think
we can all agree that the basic aim
should be to use the possibilities in-
herent in atomic energy to benefit the
the people of Australia; this includes:
(1) To ensure that any nuclear
power plant built in Australia is ef-
ficient and designed properly for Aus-
tralian conditions; to take advantage
of advances in the technology of
nuclear power generation quickly, and
to improve the design of nuclear power
plants as more of them are built.
(2) To build up within Australia a
pool of scientists and engineers skilled
in this field and related disciplines.
(3) To keep on the alert regarding
other uses of nuclear science besides
nuclear power; for example, let me
mention the use of nuclear techniques
for quality control in industrial pro-
duction and for medical and related
research.
These are by no means the only
possible aims; other people may like
a different emphasis. For example, I
have not emphasised here, nor do I
intend to do so later, the military
applications of atomic energy. A
country with a majority of its popu-
lation concentrated in a few large
cities can expect little benefit (to put
it mildly) from military applications
of atomic energy. I feel that the aims
which I have emphasised above are
non-controversial and will command
universal agreement. Let us therefore
stick to these.
Skilled Manpower.
Let us now see what policy can be
evolved to realise these aims. First of
all, Australia can not merely sit back
and wait until other countries develop
atomic power technology, and then
buy power stations from them. This
would of course give us the power sta-
tions; but it would be hard to make
sure we were getting the most up-to-
date, most efficient ones; it would be
hard to make sure we were paying a
reasonable price for them; and it
would be utterly impossible to build
up within Australia a pool of skilled
manpower in this field. This latter
point is most important, and it is the
one on which I would like to place
my main emphasis. Nuclear scien-
tists and engineers today are much in
demand all over the world, and they
can pick and choose where they wish
to go. The brightest, most imaginative
and productive men in this field in-
sist on being given freedom to do
research and development work. Even
if Australia trains such men. she can-
not keep them here if she merely pur-
chases machinery from abroad, with-
out doing any development and re-
search work right here in Australia;
the best men will leave, and Australia
will have to be content with the left-
overs.
Neither can Australia afford to do
all the research and development work
necessary to produce nuclear power.
Australia does not have the men, she
does not have the equipment, she does
not have the capital to engage in such
an ambitious enterprise; nor is there
any sense in ignoring the possibilities
of getting help and advice from other
countries, in exchange for value sup-
plied. I might mention that I have
been accused in the past of advocating
that Australia should “go it alone”;
this would be ridiculous, and I have
not done so in the past, nor do I wish
to do so now.
A middle course is therefore indi-
cated; Australia must endeavour to ob-
tain help and advice from abroad, but
she must also do her own research and
development work in this field, and
the two aspects must be carefully
balanced against each other. Further-
more, the research and development
work cannot be done unless young
men are trained in nuclear science and
engineering and related disciplines,
and adequate provision must be made
for such training. This balancing be'
tween foreign help and Australian
efforts, and between research and de-
velopment on the one hand and out-
right industrial construction on the
other, is not an easy task, and it is
precisely in this area that mistakes of
policy are most easily committed, and
public discussion is most urgently
needed. This is not a purely technical
question, which can be left to a hand-
ful of experts; it is a policy question
which affects the entire future of
velopment of Australia as a nation.
There is practically unanimous agree-
ment among experts on the purely
technical aspects of this problem.
The disagreement—and there is ap-
preciable disagreement, as you may
have heard—is a disagreement on
policy matters.
Well Balanced Programme.
Let me now try to outline what, in
my opinion, would be a well-balanced
atomic energy programme. First of
all, we must make provision for train-
ing students in this field. This train-
ing can be carried out effectively only
within Universities, and I am happy ot
say that the Government has already
asked for suggestions from the Uni-
versities. The Universities have a
tradition of teaching, they have ex-
perienced staff and a broad, overall
view. The drawback of University
teaching in this field is that an ap-
preciable part of the subject is secret,

and therefore cannot be taught in
Universities. However, this is not as
•serious a drawback as you might
imagine. The fundamental, basic
ideas are quite open, and the smaller
nuclear reactors are also non-secret.
A number of textbooks have been
written, which anyone can buy, and
whose study lays the necessary ground-
work for later work in the cecret
phases of the field. Furthermore, only
by open teaching of the subject in
Universities can we attract the best
students. For imagine the opposite:
the student about to enter a secret
school would have to undergo security
clearance, and he would have to give
up some of his personal freedom of
action, before he even knew whether
he liked the subject, or was capable
of progressing in it. And what would
happen to a student who failed to
make the grade? Such a man would
not get any benefit from his study,
yet he would be kept under security
surveillance for the rest of his life,
because he had learned some secrets
during his training period! Thus
training within established Universi-
ties, under open, non-secret condi-
tions, is an essential first step. The
equally essential second- step is follow-
up training in the secret phases of
the subject within government or in-
dustrial laboratories.
Since the essence of University
teaching in this field is its open, non-
secret nature, a reactor built within a
University must be of a non-secret
type. This automatically excludes the
very biggest reactors, which are
secret. However, non-secret reactors
are quite sufficent for training stu-
dents in the fundamentals of the sub-
ject. It has been stated by some
people that such a University reactor
would be only a toy, of no value for
either training or research. I disagree
completely; I have discussed the im-
portance of non-secret training
already. As far as research use of a
University reactor is concerned, it is
far from being a mere toy. I am
quite willing to agree that the obvious,
humdrum lines of research with low-
power reactors have already been ex-
ploited. But this does not mean that
imaginative, first rate scientists can do
no more work with such reactors. Cer-
tainly the things which can be done
with nucljear reactors have been ex-
ploited very much less than the
things which can be done with low-
energy electronuclear accelerators, of
which there are hundreds all over the
world, and yet more are being built
all the time.
The next question is again related
to training: what types of scientists
and engineers are needed most in this
field? In my opinion, this depends
very strongly on the overall aim of
the programme. If, for example, the
overall aim is limited to getting nuc-
lear power stations from abroad, and
doing research and development work
in Australia only on a small scale, only
on “ancillary problems,” then the
main emphasis should be placed on
training the men who have to run
the power stations and keep them in
operating condition. This means the
training of chemical engineers, metal-
lurgical engineers, and other types of
engineers, predominantly. Only very
few physicists, chemists, and other
fundamental scientists are needed for
such a minor effort. On the other
hand, if we adopt a more ambitious,
and, in my opinion, more sensible
policy of doing a considerable amount
of research and development work in
Australia, or some of the main, im-
portant problems in the field, then
engineers are necessary but not suffi-
cient. Fundamental scientists trained
in physics, chemistry, metallurgy, and
related fields are required as well as
engineers of all kinds. The relative
numbers are hard to determine but
there is no question that an ambi-
tious, well-balanced atomic energy
programme in Australia could absorb
many more men trained in fundamen-
tal science than Australian Universi-
ties could train in the foreseeable
future. The shortage would be of
men to fill the jobs, not of jobs for
the men. This is certainly the case
in the U.S.A. and in other countries
abroad.
Training of Students.
Going on from the training of stu-
dents, let us consider next what re-
search and development work on
nuclear power could and should be
done in Australia. I have stated be-
fore, and I repeat now, that a com-
plete investigation of all phases of this
problem would be a severe strain on
the capacities of a small country like
Australia. Australia must realise her
limitations and act accordingly. But
she must also beware of the trap of
doing nothing at all, or working only
on the “ancillary” problems. It was
stated recently in the press that Aus-
tralia would share in an atomic in-
formation pool, and that Australian
scientists would work in co-operation
with this organisation, on problems
assigned to them by the pool. I am
all in favour of getting whatever in-
formation we can: if it involves work-
ing on some problems assigned by the
pool, this is fine. But let ms not make
the mistake of working only on such
problems, of doing no independent
work on problems of our own choos-
ing. If such an information pool has
the effect of stifling Australian initia-
tive. of making Australia permanently
dependent on overseas countries, then
Australia is paying too much for the
information!
It may be cheaper to rely entirely
on such a pool, cheaper in the short
run. It is equally “cheaper” to im-
port industrial products than to en-
courage the development of secondary
industries on Australian soil. Yet no
one seriously maintains that Australia
should drop all tariff protection for
her industries, because it would be
cheaper to buy ready-made goods
from abroad. The reason is, of course,
that it is cheaper only in the short
run, but much more expensive in the
long run, because Australia, without
industrial development of her own,
would forever remain a dependent,
colonial country, in fact if not in
name. The same argument applies to
the development of nuclear power
technology. Children who continue
to hang on to mama’s apron strings
never grow up. Children should
learn from mama, they should accept
her help, but they should also take
some s;eps on their own as well!
What could such steps be? Since
the supply of manpower and capital
is limited, it would be foolish to
scatter them over a wide areea of re-
search and development. Rather one
should select carefully one particular
type of reactor which looks hopeful,
and which is adapted to Australian
conditions, and concentrate work on
this particular type. Which type to
select is a technical problem, on
which experts should be able to reach
agreement. Once the selection has
been made, research and development
work should progress in Australia, re-
gardless of whether it is duplicating
some work done elsewhere. For the
danger of duplication of effort is
much less serfous than the danger of
continued colonial dependence on the
work of overseas countries. The re'
search and development work is not
merely an end in itself; it is also a
means to another, equally important
end; to make Australia self-reliant in
the atomic energy field, and to build
up a pool of trained manpower in
Australia. Australia can afford some
duplication of research work in order
to gain that second goal.
Research and Development.
Research and development work on
large scale power reactors must be
adequately supported and well direct-
ed. Since it will inevitably be at
least partly secret, and since it is
necessarily very expensive, it cannot be
carried on entirely by Universities.
The Government must step in, pre-
ferably with the active participation of
private industry. The latter is desir-
able to acquaint private industry with
this field, and to ensure that proper
respect is paid to the problem of costs;
this is sometimes not the case in or-
ganisations controlled and financed
exclusively by governments. A large
atomic energy laboratory, patterned
along the lines of Chalk River in
Canada or Kjeller in Norway, seems a
reasonable first step, especially if pri-
vate industry is encouraged to take an
34

active interest as well. I understand
from reading the press that some such
scheme is now being seriously con'
sidered.
It should be stressed that it is
neither necessary nor desirable to wait
with such a scheme until after the
first group of students start to emerge
from the training programmes carried
on within Universities. Some people
expert in the various necessary fields
exist already locally, or are now abroad
in training, others can be attracted
here form overseas, or can be trained
relatively quickly abroad. It seems to
me that a reasonable procedure would
be to start research and development
work on a relatively small scale with
the help of such people, in the very
near future, and build up an organisa'
tion which later on can expand as
more Australian trained scientists and
engineers become available to go into
it. Thereafter it will become possible
to tackle more ambitious projects.
Finally, what about the end product
of all this effort, the power'producing
nuclear reactors? It seems to me that
it would be wise to go slow on actual
production of large scale power react'
ors, for their design is still in a very
fluid stage. This does not mean we
should construct none at all. Rather
it means that the first power reactor
which is constructed should not be
expected to pay its way directly; the
benefit derived to the people of Aus'
tralia will not be the power produced
by the reactor, but rather the experi'
ence gained in its design and build'
ing.
From this point of view the extra
work and money required to under'
stand and modify an overseas design,
rather than copying it slavishly, is a
very worthwhile investment. A power
reactor copied slavishly, without full
understanding of all the design con'
siderations, will produce power, but
it will not produce anything else. It
will not help Australia to become
grown-up and independent in this field.
Australia would not gain from its con'
struction the same type of experience,
nor would she be able to interest
in its construction the same high class
of scientists and engineers, as she
would by doing a larger amount of
design and development work. This
does not mean that overseas experi'
ence and help should be ignored; it
should be used wherever possible, but
it should not be allowed to stifle Aus'
tralian initiative, to relegate Australia
to working on “ancillary” problems
assigned to her by overseas nations.
Doing design modifications and cimi'
lar work in Australia will surely de'
lay the erection of the first power
reactor. But this delay is a cheap price
to pay for the invaluable training
given thereby to the scientists and
engineers, for the increased likelihood
of keeping the best men in this field
in Australia, for the long'range
betterment of Australia’s position in
this field.
I reealise full well that some of
the ideas expressed here run counter
to advice which Australians have re-
ceived from some experts attached to
overseas countries. These experts
often advise Australia to wait for de'
velopments overseas, and then to buy
the finished products. There is no
doubt that the policy of copying de'
velopments from overseas is greatly
to the advantage of the overseas
nation. They provide information
which costs them nothing, because
they would be working on the sub'
ject in any case. In return they get
Australia’s uranium, Australia’s space
for testing grounds, and best of all,
they can take their pick of Australia’s
young scientists and engineers who go
overseas to study; for the best of
these men will know that there is no
real future for them in Australia.
Hence Australia should accept the
help of experts attached to overseas
countries on purely technical matters,
but their policy recommendations
should be viewed with a great deal of
caution
Ine suggestions made here are by
no means very original, novel or
startling. Indeed, most of the smaller
European countries are facing these
same problems in very similar ways,

struction of at least one non'secret.

(2) Provision for follow'up traiiV
ing in the secret phases of the cub'

(3) Obtain information and advice,
from overseas wherever possible, but
do not allow overseas help to stifle
Australian initiative, to make Aus'

Australian conditions, and concentrate
research and design studies on this
type.

tion of such power reactors until the
designs stabilise, but do build pilot
models to gain experience, quickly.
(6) Accept the help of experts at-
tached to overseas countries on
purely technical matters, but be very
cautious about accepting their policy
recommendations.
This is a contentious subject and I
have therefore tried to explain care'
fully the reasons which lie behind
these proposals. If my remarks help
to stimulate discussion of atomic
energy policy in Australia, they will
have served their purpose.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. McCoutt: At the present stage
of development is nuclear power more
economical than standard fuel in pro'
duction?
Dr. Blatt: At the present stage —no,
but the curve of the economics of
power production using coal is almost
a straight line moving very gradually
upwards of recent years due to in'
creased costs of coal production. The
production of power by nuclear means
will gradually become more economi'
cal as development proceeds further.
Thus, the graph of nuclear power pro'
duction has a downward trend and,
plotting the two together, it is only a
matter of time before the two lines
cross. When that occurs, future pro'
duction of power by nuclear means
will become more economical than by
the use of standard fuels.
Mr. Blunt: What is the possibility
of erecting atomic power stations?
Would they be large or small? Would
small stations be as economical as
large?
Dr. Blatt: Large stations would be
the most economic because of the re'
mote control equipment required and
the cost of such eauipment is more or
less common to all nuclear stations.
Mr. Campbell: Due to the fact that
fissionable material has first to be pro'
duced for use in nuclear power stations
and that standard fuels would be used
to produce the fissionable material.
would it occur that, for example, in
total 1,000,000 tons of coal would be
used to produce the same amount of
power in the final analysis as
25,000,000 tons of standard fuel would
produce direct?
Dr. Blatt: There has been only one
report so far. Premier Playford in
S.A. publicly stated that a nuclear
power station would produce at 70%
to 80% of the equivalent cost of coal
per kWH of power produced.
Mr. Knight: War production in
America resulted in a great deal of
waste. Is it correct to say that dis-
sipated heat from a modern reactor
would not be wasted?
Dr. Blatt: Waste depends on the
type of reactor. The rate of power
production depends on the dissipation
of heat.
Mr. Knight: You mentioned nuclear
techniques for production control.
Would these be elaborate?
Dr. Blatt: The techniques referred
to are, for example, examination of
flaws in metals. Examination by X'
rays is an expensive procedure.
Nuclear rays are similar to X'rays and
they are more penetrating. Waste
products of nuclear fission can be used
and they would be obtained cheaply.
Such products are also useful as trace
elements in lubrication problems, etc.,
where the introduction of a fission bv'
product into the lubrication system
enables engineers to examine speedily
the we?r points.
TWIN APARTMENT TOWER BLOCKS
FRONT LAKE MICHIGAN
MANY NEW FEATURES IN CHICAGO BUILDINGS.
Standing on a superb residential
site in Chicago, and overlooking Lake
Michigan, two 26 ' storey separate
identical, rectangular towers dominate
the nearby skyline.
Both tower blocks (see photo),
placed at right angles to each other,
have their own entrance lobby, etc.,
and are connected to each other by a
covered way. Beneath the building
is garage space for 116 cars, while
the first floors are devoted to com'
munal laundries, deep freeze, and
other service rooms.
Above this level, each floor con'
tains identical flats, apart'
ments in the North Block and six'
room apartments in the South Block.
Structural Details.
The architect was Ludwig Mies
Van Der Rohe, in association with
Pace Associates, Holsman, Klekamp,
and Taylor.
Externally the two towers are
faced entirely with glass from floor
to ceiling, service floor glazing being
slightly etched to obtain privacy.
The facade of the building is
divided up with applied steel muh
lions of H section forming a regular
grid over the surface of the structure;
Lhe whole of the steel being painted
matt black with a special bituminous
paint.
Windows are aluminium, the bottom
units being hopper hung and the
large upper units pivot hung.
(Since the building was completed,
roller blinds have been fitted, grey
outer curtains are provided as part
of the furnishings to all flats, and an
inner curtain rail supplied for tenants’
own curtains.)
The structure consists of a steel
frame erected in stages. Floors are
concrete slabs cast on prefabricated
panels of corrugated iron on to which
reinforcing mesh is welded.
Steel mullion units were jig'
welded and assembled at the highest
level of the building, lowered over
the side and welded in position, the
window frames being fixed from in'
side, thus entirely eliminating exter'
nal scaffolding.
Heating is partly by radiation
from the suspended ceiling and partly
by convection from grilled tube units
beneath the windows .
(In some cases, it was found that
radiant heating was adequate by
itself.)
Air'conditioning is provided by
built'in units for certain flats, and 30
room'units are available for the two
blocks. These can be inserted in the
lower pane of the windows.
Each building has two 13'passenger
lifts, serving all floors from garage
area to roof.
Co-operative Basis.
The project was financed on a co'
operative basis, each tenant making
an inclusive payment as purchase of
the apartment, 6500 dollars
(A<£.2900) for the small flats and
12,000 dollars (iA.5390) for the
larger ones.
A monthly rental (the usual con'
tributions towards maintenance and
covering mortgage interest) averages
105 dollars (£A.47) for the small
flats and 210 dollars (£A.94).
Although occupants purchase the
apartments, the monthly rental is un'

usual and expensive by Australian
standards, but it must be remembered
that a grilled chop in any leading
hotel in the U.S.A. costs £2/5/-, and
each vegetable is charged up sepa-
rately. This is merely mentioned to
show relative values in America and
Australia, whose costs in foodstuffs
we all know.
However, this monthly charge will
decrease annually over 20 years.
The Critics.
One can hear many an architect or
aesthetic soul in Australia say, in
effect, of these Chicago apartment
towers: “I don’t like the beastly
things!”
We insist that all others shall ad-
here to our own cut-and-dried, in-
hibited and narrow viewpoint, as to
how people should conduct their lives
and where they ought to live.
This bitter experience has shown
us that we are not permitted to live
high up in the fresh air, but must
live out in the far-flung suburbs
close to the ground among the wogs
that breed in it and come from it to
disturb our slumber (mosquitoes at
night) or contaminate our food (flies
by day), whilst our children are
asked to encounter poisonous insects
(red-backed spiders) or even an occa-
sional snake. The services made avail-
able in flats become luxuries if applied
to homes, such as hot-water services
or radiant heating, refrigeration, or a
lift to take one to one’s very door. We
have no choice. But we are compelled
to travel in frequently anything-but-
clean conveyances that others have
fouled up for us with smokes and
spits. Hateful description, but very
real.
Travel Difficulties.
Distance, in this case, does not
lend enchantment. Commuters waste
an average of an hour to two hours
a day—exclusive of traffic congestion
and rail breakdowns travelling to
work. Two hours’ travelling a day
(of earning power at time and a half
at, say, 10/- per normal hour equals
30/- a day, or £7/10/- a week)
makes living in the distance a very
expensive luxury and flat-living close
up to the city very cheap.
Our architectural and aldermanic
ostriches see no advantage in travel-
line upwards and homewards in tall
buildings instead of travelling suburb-
wards by archaic transport methods.
They take great pains—and every
possible opportunity —to criticise as
“preposterous and impossible” any
large-scale flat-building project, and
“utterly out of all reason” any
scheme for Sydney on the lines of
Chicago’s eminently successful Twin
Towers.
If two such buildings as th&se
were submitted to the councils, the
local authorities would just about
drop dead. Like ostriches with heads
in the sands, they close their eyes to
the fact that many thousands of our
people are not housed —nor even
“properly garaged,” to coin a phrase.
Newly-weds make heavy weather of
married life in rooms or with in-laws;
children, born and bred in back-
street basements, learn crime and de-
pravity for lack of decent home-life.
Is it any wonder the Divorce, Crimi-
nal, and Children’s Courts are over-
worked?'
Let us stop mou.hing platitudes
about housing, and really get down
to it! What if people do live in tall
buildings? Millions do in other parts
of the world -- and love every
moment of it. They find equal com-
fort and greater convenience than
the average suburban co tage can
provide. Who wants a garden where
one “sweats blood” to get things to
grow, only to be told as soon as Sum-
mer comes in that one must not use
water on them? Or, if one is elderlv,
one has to dip deep down into one’s
pocket to pay a gardener <£3 a day for
the privilege of having a garden and
spending money on seeds, plants, etc.
All this makes living in the distance
a very expensive pleasure, no matter
how fond of a garden one may be.
Elderly folk enjoy flat life. Thous-
ands live in State-owned apartments
in New Zealand and pay nominal
rentals.
Control Needed.
Children, too, can be trained to
live in apartments. “Flat-broken,” as
it has been aptly described. Parents
to-day are largely to blame that no
one will admit children while they
are destructive, boisterous and wilful,
as so many are. The original ideal
of “allowing a child to exercise self'
expression” has developed into urn
restricted licence to do any damage
and make any noise it likes, and no
one is going to take that from “other
people’s kids,” as they say.
The Editor of this Journal had a
cook for one month this year —a
lucky month. He daughter came on a
visit, brought her little daughter
along. The child scribbled all over
the walls of a newly-decorated flat.
Such incidents don’t give people
any desire or encouragement to help
such types with unrestrained children.
SOHO FOUNDRY.
The Soho foundry at Birmingham
in which the original Tames Watt
steam engines were built is to be
closed after 165 years of constant use.
Its owners have no room to expand
there and are moving to another site.
TWIN APARTMENT TOWERS, LAKE SHORE DRIVE. CHICAGO.
These two 26-storey apartment towers on Lake Michigan, Chicago, are placed at
right angles to each other. Basement holds 116 cars. The Towers are a short
distance from "The Loop," Chicago's business centre. They thus solve transport
problems. If there are for instance, 250 flats in each building with say, four persons
to a flat, that would keep 2,000 people in the city within a few minutes walk to their
occupation. In this age of mechanism, there is a vast difference between taking a
dust-free conveyance—a lift—upwards into the pure air and above the fly line, and
a tram through a dust-laden atmosphere outwards into the far flung suburbs and then
walking a mile after leaving the tram. Some day, we in Australia will also think of
conserving life's energies and not using them so uselessly in travelling long distances.
Our methods of life, controlled by antediluvian building by-laws that prohibit free-
dom of movement and enjoyment, just doesn't spell sense, and It is time that we
altered our building by-laws to enable people to build skyscrapers if they want to
live in them. A hundred skyscrapers would not overcrowd the city. They would
keep 100,000 people from using the traffic laden dusty streets. They would save
rolling stock and the need for employing strike-motivated tramway men and bus
drivers, besides saving the Government a lot of money, and people from having
shattered nerves.

GOOD GLAZING PRACTICE
PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN.
{The following extracts from an article entitled “Facts About Glazing,’’ by J.
C. Moore and published by the Scientific Section of the National Paint Varnish
and Lacquer Association, Inc., Washington, U.S.A., is reprinted on account of
its general interest to Architects and Builders.—Ed.}
The best grades of putties and glaz'
ing materials will fail if improperly
applied or not properly cared for after
application. These failures do not ap-
pear immediately but after some period
of exposure, and are wrongly inter'
preted as due to inferior material.
Uses of Putty and Other Glazing
Materials.
What Is Putty? Putty is a soft,
doughdike, plastic cement made by
thorough mixing pigment with oil.
The chief uses of putty are in glazing,
and in filling crevices such as cracks
and nail holes. When properly paint'
ed, putty serves to seal a structure
against the destructive action of the
weather. A good grade of puttv or
glazing material under white paint does
not cause discoloration due to bleed'
ing. To'day’s putties are the result
of many years of research and
mentation by the manufacturers.
Wood Sash Putty. Wood sash putty
is usually a mixture of pigment and
linseed oil. Putty may contain other
drying oils such as soybean, perilla,
etc.
A good grade of wood sash putty
will not adhere with too great a
tenacity to the putty knife, or to the
glazier’s hands, yet it will not be too
dry to apply to the sash.
The application of a suitable primer
before applying putty is a necessary
practice. This preliminary procedure
should never be omitted.
Metal Sash Putty. Metal sash putty
differs from the wood sash variety in
that it is formulated to adhere to a
non'norous surface. As a rule, two
grades of putty are made for metal
sash, interior and exterior. Metal sash
is built sometimes to be glazed with
the facing inside, sometimes with the
facing outside. The latter condition
is found in metal casement windows
that require special casement glazing.
Puttv exposed to the weather should
be specially formulated to increase its
durability and flexibility. The interior
type should never be used for exterior
surfaces, iust as you would not use
interior paint on exterior surfaces.
Glazing Compounds. Glazing com'
pounds are also the result of many
years of research and experimentation
by the manufacturers. They differ
from wood and metal sash putties
both in composition and performance.
They are usually formulated from
selected processed oils and pigments
which will remain plastic and resilient
over a longer period of time than the
common hard'setting putties. Although
designed to resist abuses, they should
be used with the same care and pre'
caution given conventional putty. A
good grade of glazing compound,
even under severe weather conditions,
should not become brittle and crack,
nor become soft and sag, if handled
and applied according to the manu
facturer’s directions. It should cling
tenaciously to sash and glass and form
a smooth, tough, elastic, surface skin,
but remain pliable and plastic under'
neath. Moreover, the compound
should possess desirable properties of
ease of handling and application.
Causes For Glazing
Failures.
Haste Makes Waste. Hurried
ing often leads to failure because of
improper bedding, loose'fitting lights,
and insufficient pressure on the knife
to make good contact between the
putty and the sash. Take time to blow
the dust away and fix the lights
firmly with a number of clips or glaz'
ing points, as recommended by sash
manufacturers. Glazing materials are
not intended to hold glass in place.
This should be done by mechanical
means.
Weather. Any glazing material
applied to frosty, wet or dirty sur'
faces will not form a good bond. Best
results are obtained when the glazing
material is used above 40 o F. It should
not be stored in any place where it
will be exposed to extreme heat or
cold. In chilly weather, when it is,
desirable to warm the putty to make
it more pliable, warming with steam,
as in a double boiler is ideal; never
spread on a metal surface to which
heat is applied directlv: never exnose
the container to a direct fire. Direct
heating will usuallv burn the nuttv at
the Point of contact or remove the
oils at that spot. Avoid overheating
caused bv placing the container too
near a salamander or other source of
open flame.

masking the actual window frames themselves, is increasing in Europe, Window

BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


Condensed Moisture. Water vapour
in a heated or tightly closed building
condenses on the interior surfaces of
cold sash. This condition is a par-
ticularly noticeable cause of failure in
work done in the late Autumn and
Winter. A damp, closed building is
often heated before the glazing mate-
rial has had time to set and be painted
properl. The condensation of moisture
at the junction of the new glazing
material and the cold glass brings
about a loosening of the bond, and a
disintegrating of the glazing com-
pound. Glazing materials subjected to
these conditions will not produce
satisfactory results.
Lack of Priming. The application
of a priming paint is essential for
good results on both wood and steel
sash. In the absence of a special
priming paint, a good exterior house
paint, thinned according to the manu-
facturer’s directions, may be used.
Priming fills the pores of the wood,
lessening the absorption of the oil
from the putty which would leave it
dry and brittle. Wood preservatives
are not necessarily sealers, and in most
cases are not considered to be primers.
Since there is no absorption of vehicle
in the glazing of steel sash, a different
tvne of priming paint is used. A
satisfactory steel primer retards the
formation of rust that would loosen
the bond between the puttv and the
steel, and also provides the proper
“tooth” or roughened surface for
adhesion.
Aluminium sash should also be
tested. However, when the sash is
shipped from the manufacutrer
covered with a protective coating as
required by the Aluminium Window
'Manufacturers’ Association, no further
treatment is required.
Lack of Painting. All wood and
metal sash putties must be painted, or
job failure mav result. Painting ex-
tends the life of any glazing job.
Application and Handling.
Proper Consistency. Glazing mate-
rial should be mixed thoroughly just
before use, because there is a slight
tendency for the oil to separate from
the pigment on long standing. Any
oil floating at the top of the con-
tainer must be thoroughly mixed with
the entire batch. Particular attention
should be given to kneading the oil
back into the dryer pigment at the
bottom of the container. If, after
thorough mixing, the glazing material
is still too stiff for easy working, add
thinners according to the manufac-
turer’s directions only.
Priming. A good priming paint
should have been applied to a clean,
dry surface before any glazing is
started. This recommendation applies
equally to wood and steel sash. Special
primers containing a preservative to
prevent wood-rot caused by fungi and
mildew may be used where there is
need for such extra protection, but
where such primers are used, they
should be sealers as well. Good grades
of wood preservatives do not interfere
with the performance of glazing mate-
rial. The use of shellac or varnish as
a primer should be avoided, because
priming material will not stick to them.
A metal primer that will both retard
corrosion and provide a rough surtace
should have been applied to all steel
sash before the application of glazing
materials to ensure a long-lasting bond
between metal and glazing material.
The priming coat should be allowed
to dry thoroughly in all cases before
glazing material is applied over it.
This is equally true in the application
of preservatives. Glazing material
does not adhere well to a priming
coat unless the coat is dry.
Bedding. All glass should be well
bedded. Use a liberal ribbon of bed-
ding, extending all the way round the
inside of the sash. A thin continu-
ding, extending all the way round the
glass when pressure is applied, to
make a complete bond between sash
and glass. Each light should be held
firmly in place with a sufficient num-
ber of glazing points or clips. Skimp-
ing on bedding or a lack of firm sup-
port for the glass will lead to early
failure of the glazed sash. Shims
may be required to hold large and
heavy lights in place. Consult your
glass manufacturer for details.
Painting. After allowing enough
time for the glazing material to set,
it is best to paint promptly to seal
and protect it. Those glazing mate-
rials for which the manufacturer does
not recommend painting are usually
made in a variety of colours and re-
commended for use on sash painted
prior to glazing. To ensure a good
water seal when painting over puttv,
the same number of coats of paint
should be applied to the puttv as to
the sash, and the paint should lap
slightly on to the glass. This lapping
of paint on to the glass Provides a
sealing action at the critical edge.
Glazing materials will last longer when
painted within three or four weeks
after glazing, or even sooner during
Winter weather. Shop-glazed sash
should be painted as soon as possible
after being put in place.
Handling. The less the sash is
handled during the drying period of
the glazing material, the better will be
the results obtained. The planing and
weather stripping of wood sash or
preparation of metal sash, and the
addition of locks or other hardware
are likely to jar or vibrate the sash
sufficiently to loosen the glazing mate-
rial. This work should all be done
before glazing. The best policy is to
stack the glazed wood sash in a dry
place in such a manner that air may
circulate freely throughout the stack.
Metal sash is best glased after it has
been installed.
Metal sash in a warped condition
should be straightened and aligned
before glazing, NOT after.
Guarantees. The guarantees of a
manufacturer cover only the ingre-
clients of his putty, and not the re-
suits of its application, since it is im-
possible for him to control its applica-
tion and handling. Should be guaran-
tee the results, he is violating Rule 12
of The Trade Practice Rules for the
Putty Manufacturing Industry issued
by the Federal Trade Commission on
June 30, 1939, which states, “The
making of anv guarantee as to the
durability or service of any industry
product which is untrue or which is
impracticable or impossible to fulfil
because of contingencies such as, but
not limited to, workmanship or main-
tenance over which the manufacturer
or guarantor has no control, or which
otherwise has a tendency, capacity or
effect of deceiving or misleading the
purchasing or consuming public, is an
unfair trade practice.”
Summary,
1. Buy glazing materials from a
reputable manufacturer and follow his
recommendations as to proper grade
and type of material for any given
job.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s recom-
mendations in thinning.
3. Eliminate long storage periods
by ordering quantities consistent with
normal requirements. Turn the con-
tainers upside down occasionally when
long storage is necessary.
4. Ensure uniform consistency by
mixing thoroughly before using.
5. For best results, use above 40°F.
6. Be certain that the surface to be
glazed is clean, dust-free and dry.
7. Always prime. Give the primer
or any paint or preservative coating
time to dry before glazing. Never
use a primer such as shellac or varnish
that dries to a hard glossy surface.
8. Bed all lights, and hold them
firmly in place with the proper num-
ber of glazing points, clips or shims.
Be certain to use glass cut to the
proper size.
9. Apply firm pressure on the knife
to make sure there will be a good
bond between the facing material, the
sash and glass.
10. Place the glazed sash side to set
in a dry place that is not subject to
jars and vibrations; stack in such a
manner that air may circulate freely
and allow sash to stand until glazing
materials have properly set.
11. Sills must have been poured

LARGE TURBO-GENERATOR
ORDER.
An order valued at over a million
dollars (£A.445,000) has been placed
with Metropolitan Vickers Electrical
Co. Ltd., of Manchester by the Mani-
toba Hydro-electric Board of Canada,
covering two steam turbogenerators
which will be the largest in the
province.
Each set will consist of a 33 M.W.
turbine 6001b./sq. in., 827°F., driving
a 13,800-volt A.C. generator of the
hydrogen-cooled type at 3600 r.p.m.
M.V. has also supplied 91 single-
phase feeder reactors to the N.S.W.
Electricity Commission to be placed
at Bunnerong Power Station on 33
K.V. lines to limit fault currents and
enable economies to be made in exist-
ing switchgear. These reactors limit
fault currents on short circuit to 5000
(r.m.s.) and are provided with non-
magnetic shielding; their V.A.
characteristic being a straight line
curve.
SUSPENDER FRAMES SUPPORT CANTILEVERED ROOF TRUSSES.
The New York International Airport hangar will have exposed steel suspender
frames above the root which they carry in cantilevered sections 138 ft. on each
side of the central framework. The colossal overhang, as seen on the left, dwarfs
the supporting members, making them appear somewhat frail and inadequate for
their purpose. "Engineering News Record."

Building Regulations
“Archaic”
Complete Overhaul Advocated.
“One could find many present-
day building requirements insisted
upon by some council building in-
spectors which not only add undue
expense to new timber homes, but
are ridiculous in the extreme,” said
the Director of the Timber Devel-
opment Association of Australia,
Mr. E. Colin Davis.
“It is time the whole of Building
Ordinance 71 was completely re-
viewed by competent authorities to
remove some of its ridiculous clauses,”
said Mr. Davis. “The trouble is. it
would need so much attention the
authorities are probably content to
leave it alone.
“There are many clauses in this
ordinance which are archaic and have
only a retardant effect on both design
and construction. Just imagine any
regulation which prescribes both ant'
capping and damp-proofing when
either one serves both purposes,”
said Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis said that, following
overtures to the Department of Local
Government, he had been advised by
the Minister, Mr. Renshaw, that in
those cases where councils required
the insertion of ant-caps, there was
no practical reason why the damp-
proof course required Sy clause 21
should not serve as ant-capping—for
example, metallic damp-proof courses,
aluminium, copper and zinc.
“This is all very well, but the
average home-builder cannot afford
copper or zinc and feels that the
tried galvanised iron is quite suffi-
cient,” said Mr. Davis.
To-day, with no likelihood of a
decrease in building costs, it behoves
the Department of Local Government
to abolish any clause in the ordinance
which is out of date or unnecessary.”
Mr. H. G. Ferrier
To Attend 1.L.0. Conference
Mr. H. G. Perrier, Chairman of
Directors of Federated British Oil Em
gmes (N.S.W.), left by air on Octo'
ber 21 for Geneva, where he will
attend the Metal Trades Conference
being held under the auspices of the
International Labour Office. He has
been appointed employers’ representa'
tive by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment.
A.M.P. Office Block For Wollongong
WILL BE CITY’S LARGEST STRUCTURE.
The £lBO,OOO, five-storey A.M.P.
office block in Wollongong will be
erected on the corner of Keira and
Market Streets.
The Keira Street frontage will in'
elude shops. The building will pro'
vide large accommodation for the
A.M.P. Society’s district office, and
the four upper storeys, with a total
floor space of 24,600 sq. ft., will be
available for letting.
Architectural features are the hoods
and fins on the northern and eastern
aspects of the building, to provide
shade from the sun.
External walls will be of face brick'
work, and internal partitions will be
of a special modular design in timber
to allow for flexibility and the use of
standard components.
Construction of the building will
be of concrete frame, the floor sur'
faces being finished in asphalt tiles.
The roof will be a concrete slab,
and an upper pitched covering of
asbestos cement.
The architects are Messrs. Stephen'
son and Turner (designers of the
North Sydney A.M.P. building). The
contractors are Eldweld Pty. Ltd.,
Master Builders, of Wollongong.
INSULATED FORMS FOR
WINTER CONCRETING.
Pouring concrete in Winter does
not necessarily require costly form'
work or heating equipment. By lin-
ing the forms with double-thick
balsam-wood insulation a contractor on
a Missouri River (U.S.A.) project
was , able tp maintain a temperature
well over the minimum required by
the specification, without the use of
any enclosure, o rexternal heat. The
insulation helped to retain not only
the initial heat but also the heat of
hydration.
Lifts of about 20ft. were poured
as a unit, and an initial temperature
of 60°F. was maintained using cold

Electrical Industrial Development in Brazil
GREAT POWER EXPANSION.
Pronounced electrical activity has
been the feature of the national ad'
vancement o Brazil during the last
few years. The immense mineral and
vegetable resources of this vast coun'
try of over 3,289,000 square miles
have been seriously restricted by the
lack of power.
It is estimated that there is a power
deficiency of 1600 MW and that over
£320 million (sterling) will be needed
to establish a secure power basis for
industry. The developmental pro'
gramme including coal, iron and tim'
ber, will involve £6OO million (ster'
ling) over the next 10 years.
The showpiece of the Hydro'Elec'
trie power plants, now well under way
and due for commissioning next vear,
is the station and reservoirs at Cuba'
tao, in San Paulo region. This will
have an initial 260 MW and a final
capacity of 484 MW.
In the same area there is building
the most modern thermal station in
the country, Piratininga, with its first
two units of 100 MW each.
A major project in the State of Rio
de Janeiro is the underground hydro'
electric at Fontes, fed with water from
the rivers Paraiba and Pirai. This will
have an ultimate capacity of 330 MW.
The three power stations mentioned
above will double the generating plant
capacity within three years.
About half the population of Brazil
of 56 million lives in the Panama
basin, 1,158,000 square miles, where
there is a total power potential estfi
mated at 7053 MW. The iron and
coal industries are very backward and
depend on the power programme for
their development.
At present only about 2 million tons
of coal is recovered annually but
known reserves exceed 200 million
tons. Iron ore reserves capable of
producing 13 million tons of nematite
a vear exist in the Minas Exerais
region.
Precious and semi precious stones
and metals have long been recognised
as being a feature of the countrv and
rich deposits of uranium and thorium
kave been indicated in recent surveys.
Plans are being laid to build a nuclear
reactor within the next five years.
The key industry for the develop'
ment of the country is, however, elec'
trie power.

ence opened in Rio de Janeiro in
gust last. Delegates were conducted
over the industrial works mentioned in

AUSTRALIAN ELECTRICITY
STATISTICS.
For the 1952'53 period the output
of electric power supply authorities
was valued at <£60,000,000, of which
£9,600,000 was paid in salaries and
wages.
Land and buildings used in the pro'
duction of electricity were valued at
£29,500,000, and plant and machinery
at just over £94,000,000.
There are 349 generating authori'

TIDAL POWER IN LA RANGE
ESTUARY.
The La Ranee tidal power develop'
ment project initiated last year in
France has revived interest in the
problem of the industrial develop'
ment of power from the ocean.
It is only where a combination of
an extremely wide difference in level
between high and low tide, together
with suitable geographical arrange'
ments of land masses, exists that ad'
vantage can be taken of this power
potential of the tides.
The Severn Estuary in England has
already been harnessed, and if it were
possible similarly to treat the waters
of the English Channel there is a
total of 157,000,000 kilowatts going
to waste, 24,000,000 of which is con'
centrated ;n a short stretch of the
French coast.
The La Ranee Estuary is an inlet
opening on to the English Channel
just close to the Channel Islands; it
is tidal for a length of over twelve
miles and has a difference in tide
levels of about 45ft.
Much research has been carried
out, and the projected scheme in'
volves a barrage across the estuary
about two miles from the coastline,
where a power plant working on the
single'cycle or simple evacuation prim
ciple could be placed, estimated to
generate 8000 K.W. over a period of
3740 hours per year, the peak period
being limited to 1280 hours .

AUSTRALIAN BUILDING ACTIVITY.
The last twelve months has seen the revival of major building activity as applied to city buildings in the capital cities of
Australia. We illustrate one or two in this series. Reading from left to right, the new buildings are: Murray House, Grenfell
Street, Adelaide, which is under construction; new Co-operative building in Melbourne, for which the Architect is J. A.
La Gerche; the third is the Alliance Insurance Company's new building to be erected in Melbourne to the designs of A. C.
Leith, Bartlett & Associates. Above these three city buildings is the Memorial Hall to be erected at Aldgate In the
Adelaide hills, while below is the Queen's House Community Centre for the Brotherhood of St. Laurence at Carrum Downs,

WHAT STYLE?
Many folk, when considering the planning and design of their new home-to-be, consume large quantities of mental and
nervous energy upon what style house they will have. Shall it be Tudor, with its half-timber Spanish, Mission, with semi-
circular tiles, timber, log-cabin variety, or streamlined flat-roofed moderne? Perhaps there is a tendency to-day for many
of the extreme styles to die, and we see less and less of the stylised varieties mentioned in our suburbs. This quartet, how-
ever, contains two at least which conform to the same sort of style. Bottom left, with its curved gables and barley-sugar
columns between the windows, has a Spanish flavour formerly associated with the California-n Spanish type of home. Above,
the timber house with its wide horizontal boarding and vertical boarded shutters has perhaps been Inspired by the lines of
the log cabin, this style being particularly popular in the U.S.A. It would be hard to type the other two examples; the
former perhaps may be called a bungalow and the other a two-storey house.

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
Building; Permits.
The number of building permits
issued by the Brisbane City Council
during September—7o4 was 160
below those issued in the previous
month (August); but, notwithstanding
this, the number of new dwellings to
cost between £3OOO and £4OOO (42),
the most prominent class, was in
excess of August permits.
The unpopularity of flats, with
tenancy laws definitely against the
owner, is responsible for three build-
ings only, to cost £3250, £3750, and
£4OOO. Of six new stores and shops,
including additions to existing build-
ings, the costs ranged from £4OOO to
£lO,OOO each. Larger warehouses will
cost £12,000, £13,000, and £17,000
each. A club house for a bowling
green accounts for £6OOO. Two new
shops, with a dwelling in each case
will cost £4OOO and £6OOO.
The brewery company of Castle-
maine Perkins Ltd. is spending
£213,575 on a cold-storage addition
to its brewery at Milton, and £60,483
on a new city hotel in Creek Street;
and a suburban hotel is to take on p
new bar at a cost of £5285. Addi-
tions to a R.C. College will cost
£15,000, and to a convent £19,485.
A suburban fire station will cost
£12,500, and on a home at Sandgate
(by the sea) for Aged Masons £45,000
will be spent.
Housing.
Queensland building statistics to
June 30. 1954, just issued, indicate
that 8774 new homes were built, ar a
cost of £18,630,000, while the value
of other buildings” was £7,283,000.
It is authoritatively stated that
scarcely a home is being built for
rental. Many extraordinary features
of the Fair Rents Act have caused
landlords to be placed in an invidious
position. Of the 9169 homes com-
pleted in the year 1953-54, about one-
half were in the metropolitan area.
Despite the comparative paucity of
timber supplies, and the consequen-
ts rise in its price, the relative cost
of brick and timber housing still
favoured wood, as is borne out bv the
stated average cost —brick, £3164-
wood, £2125.
It is still very difficult to buy
bricks and cement through ordinary
trade channels, but, in respect of
cement, it is announced that the out-
r Ut °v.r tb , e Queensland Cement 6?
Lime Works Ltd. at Darra has been
stepped up to 250,000 tons per
annum, and that of the newly-opened
works at Townsville is 40,000 and
capable of turning out later on
80,000 tons of cement. When cement
supplies reach the demand, it is ex-
pected that cement bricks will come
on the market and thus overcome the
shortage of bricks that has been delay-
ing building construction for a long
time.
Federal Works
Expenditure.
Whether the proposed expenditure
of £3,000,000 up to June 30 next —
of £10,000,000 —on Federal works,
mostly connec'ed with functions as-
sociated with the Army and the Air
Force, can be looked at with equa-
nimity or not. if the price helps to
purchase security in a greatly dis-
turbed world, the doubt vanishes.
On airports £4,000,000 is to be
spent, and on the jungle training
camp at Canungra, near Brisbane's
finest national park, about £300,000.
The new Taxation building at the
corner of Wharf and Adelaide
Streets, is to be something to astound,
with provision to counteract bomb
assaults. The estimated cost —
£1,500,000 ensures it being the
largest Commonwealth building in
Queensland. In addition to the base-
ments, there will be eleven sloreys.
topped by a roof for the lift machin-
ery. There will be a frontage of
207 ft. 6in. in Wharf Street and 132 ft.
Sin. in Adelaide Street, and the
building would cover 27,000 sq. ft.
The erecting of the new building will
involve the demolition of a good-class
private hotel and a number of old,
below-standard shops. Early com-
mencement of the building is in-
tended, but will depend upon supplies
of steel to create a rigid steel frame
encased in concrete. No less than
<£250,000 is to be spent on furniture
and fittings of various buildings, and
£700,000 on repairs and maintenance.
Day work by the Department’s
own plan would build the new 2000 ft.
and 200 ft. airstrip at Eagle Farm at
a cost of £1,500,000, including the
supply of filling and other materials.
A similar expenditure on work now
in progress at Amberley will provide
safe landing for any kind of aircraft.
Similar sums are being spent on an
airfield at Garbutt Field (Townsville).
Of a lesser standard, designed to re-
ceive Super Convairs, £9OOO to
£lO,OOO is being spent on the aero-
drome at Coolangatta, and of this
sum £6OOO will be paid by the Ansett
Company. Before the end of October,
this work will be finished ready to
cater for the large demand for flying
accommodation of southern visitors

acre golf links on the Brisbane River,
between Hamilton and Pinkenba, but
as the lease has still another twelve
years to run, and as playing fields
appear to be sacrosanct, against the
demand for working fields, industrial
progress may have to wait.
There has been considerable crith
cism of the Brisbane City Council for
its reluctance to make available more
areas for industrial development than
it appears to be willing to provide.
Reputable real estate agents have
stated that they know of “millions
lost” in would'be capital investment
here, mainly from N.S.W. and Vic'
torian merchants and manufacturers.
In the Brisbane City Council, Alder'
man White said she knew of an in'
dustrial firm that had been refused
permission to build here.
The report of the Chairman of the
Industries Board (Mr. R. G. Hoare),
read in Parliament, referred to the
lag in extending secondary industry,
though many enquiries reach his
department. From an analysis of the
position aforementioned, it would
appear that the delayed plan of zon-
ing Brisbane, drawn up by the City
Council for the confirmation of the
Government, is, in the main,
responsible.
Despite all these delayed actions, a
great deal of large'type building can
be observed in the city area. Steel
frames are making skyward for the
twelve'Storied “house of glass” for
the Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assur'
ance Company; the State Govern'
ment Insurance Building (last sec'
tion). South Brisbane Auxiliary Hos'
pital, Mater Hospital (No. 2), Power
House at Tennyson, steel building in
the “Valley” for Holden cars, to
name some only.
In the field of remodelling, the
major work in the year was carried
out by Finney Isles & Co. Ltd. on
their Queen Street to Adelaide Street
departmental store, at a cost of
£200,000, which includes the instal-
lation of escalators and fluorescent
lighting and cantilever awnings. A
very striking result has been achieved.
This is only one of many remodelling
jobs, costing many thousands of
pounds in individual cases.
St. Tohn’s Cathedral.
Some disapproval has been ex'
pressed, in the Press, of the intended
modification in the original plan of
the famous British architect, Pear'
son, when the completing, at a cost
of £400,000, of the western section
of St. John’s Cathedral is under con'
struction. Some subscribers to the re'
cent appeal have publicly expressed
their resentment. Even though the
acoustics in this noble building are
poor, the architecture is too mag'
nificent to spoil.
North Queensland.
By degrees, the main highway
from Brisbane to Cairns—l2os miles
—is being made the kind of road in
which tourists delight. About £750,000
is to be spent on this road in the
1954-55 financial year, as part of a
highway that will have cost
£5,000,000. While it is intended to
have a bitumen surfaced road through'
out, there is still 474 miles of
metalled or gravelled road to be bitu'
minised. There is two miles of new
road near Mackay that will cost
£36,000 :o complete.
The new T.B. annexe to the Cairns
Brisbane Hospital, at a cost of
£220,000, was opened by the Federal
Health Minister only early in October.
Others of a like nature will be built
at Townsville, Rockhampton, and
Toowoomba.
Portion of the Brisbane Chest Hos-
pital at Chermside, which cost
£BOO,OOO of the £2,000,000 ultimate
amount, is now in occupation. It is
claimed to be the best in the Southern
Hemisphere. Such fine buildings and
equipments, with modern nursing,
must go a long way in the fight
against this dreaded maladv, resulting
mainly from removable causes.
Proposed River Tunnels.
In the search for means to alleviate
the growing traffic problems, prelimi'
nary feelers have been put out re'
specting the proposal to construct
traffic tunnels under the Brisbane
River, Commenting upon this, Mr.
M. R. Hornibrook is reported to have
said: “On big projects, modern en-
gineering expects problems and sets
itself to overcome them. There were
people who said the Hamiltomßulimba
sewer tunnel could not be built. It is
built. Traffic tunnels under the river
can also be built.”

Despite the unfavourable reaction
to the suggestion made in high circles
that the Town of South Coast—
which includes Southport, Surfers’
Paradise and other beaclvtowns to
Coolangatta - be renamed “Pacific
City,” rapid developments taking
place in those areas, particularly
about Surfers’ Paradise, are tending
towards the making of a new city,

but an impermanent kind are being
built freely. Beach etqsion has been
so serious at Narrow Neck, involving'
the expenditure of so much money,
that the whole practice of building
dwellings close to the beach sand'
dunes is receiving a lot of atten.ion in
the Press and in Parliament.
The suggestion that receives much
support is one that aims at reserving
all beach frontaje to the sea for a
safe distance from the highway, and
planting the intervening land with
trees and grasses that should arrest
the movement of wind'blown sand.
(Take, as an example, Manly
Beach.) The problem has been re'
sponsible, tot), for the raising of ob'
jections to the leasing of beaches for
the purpose of recovering rutile, zir'
con, etc., from the mineralised sands.
It is claimed by the objectors that
erosion must follow the action of
treating beach sands, the extent of
which was mentioned in Parliament
to be at the rate of one yard of sand
per minute for eight hours a day dur'
ing 365 days a year. As the State
Governments holds 700 building
allotments at Broadbeach that adjoins
Surfers’ Paradise, it was suggested in
Parliament that these allotments be
made available to those prepared to
vacate their near'the'beach holdings.
Here some owners have spent up to
£lOOO in moving their homes back
from the sea.
A demand has been made for the
abandonment of the mineral sands in-
dustry, despite its large value, es
being of less importance to the State
than the retention of the beaches and
the sand'dunes. On nearby Strad'
broke Island, with its many miles of
coastline and no dwellings, the ob'
jectors claim the industry could
flourish equally well, and, as a matter
of fact, is.
Over £160,000 is to be spent for
theatres on the South Coast, in addi'
tion to the estimated expenditure of
£50,000 on an ultra'modern theatre
in Southport.
Stanthorpe.
The unusual spectacle of speed'
boat races and a regatta and aquatic
carnival at Stanthorpe which is
3000 ft. above sea level, close to the
N.S.W. border town of Wallangarra,
200 miles inland from Brisbane—was
one of the func'ions at the “Back'tO'
Stanthorpe” week in October. This
was made possible by a new water
supply project which impounds
500,000,000 gallons of water in the
Storm King Dam recently completed.
There were 11,000 people and 4000
cars present on this occasion.
T.V.A. HAS LARGEST PUMP-
TURBINE.
The largest pump'turbine designed
or built to date is now being installed
in the Hiwassee Dam on the Ten'
nessee Valley Authority (U.S.A.)
System. The machine will rotate in
one direction as a pump, lifting water
into the dam at ofTpeak load periods,
and in the opposite direction as a
turbine supplying power to the
system at fulbload periods.
Nominal rating of the unit as a
turbine is 80,000 horsepower, at 190
ft. head. As a pump it can lift 3900
cu. ft. per second against a head of
205 ft.
The use of a pump storage system
at Hiwassee Dam only became attrac'
tive when it was found that a dual'
purpose unit could be designed, thus
reducing the capital cost of a separate
turbine and a separate pump. The
new plant is scheduled to gO'On'the'
line in October, 1955.

Important S.A. building projects
were being delayed by a serious
shortage of architects, the Immediate
Past President of the S.A. Institute of
of Architects (Mr. W. T. Haslam)
said this month: The delays, includ-
ing hold-ups in preparation of designs
and calling of tenders, were the result
of the current building boom—at least
six big city buildings are being
planned or built. At one time archi-
tects and engineers could be obtained
from overseas, Mr. Haslam said, but
there was now a shortage of experi-
enced architects in Britain. Although
the number graduating from Austra-
lian schools and universities was much
higher than before the war, it was
still insufficient to meet demand.
The Dept, of Works was in a par-
ticularly bad way at the moment, and
urgently needed up to 30 architects
and 20 engineers to keep up with its
building programme, he said.
The first three contractors for the
new satellite town at Salisbury are
now at work on the site. They are
Orlit (S.A.) Ltd., Elsdon Bros., and
M. and D. Richardson. Store com-
pounds have been erected, and
foundation work has begun on the
double-unit homes. The Housing
Trust has already received 50 applica-
tions for commercial, industrial and
shop sites in the scheme.
The S.A. Portland Cement Co.
Ltd.’s new kiln a; Angaston is now in
operation. It will produce 72,000
bags of cement a week, and may
overcome the cement shortage by the
end of the year. The extra 3000 tons
a week produced by the new kiln will
bring the State’s annual cement out-
put to 280,000 tons.
The new £500,000 factory of C.
A. Parsons (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. at
Whyalla was recently opened by the
Premier (Mr. Playford). It will
manufacture condensers and feed
heating equipment for turbo-generating
plant. The factory, which has a saw-
tooth roof design to give natural
lighting, was erected by Gibb and
Miller, of Adelaide. The interior has
been painted in soft colours of sun-
tint yellow, sky blue and leaf green,
and the exterior in aluminium finish.
The offices, built by F. Fricker Ltd.,
are air-conditioned, and employees
have an air-conditioned messroom
with a hot-water system.
Work has begun on a circulating
canal, 250 ft. long and 15ft. wide,
between the Port River and the
£2,000,000 Port Adelaide sulphuric
acid plant. A spokesman for Simon-
Carves (Australia) Pty- Ltd., principal
contractors for the plant, said this
month that the canal would be of
reinforced concrete, capable of
handling 1,000,000 gallons of water
an hour. Water from the canal would
be used for acid cooling and for the
turbine condenser, he said. Wilckens
and Burnside Ltd. have the contract
for building the inlet canal to the
opmp pit at the plant. Further con-
tracts will be let to provide a pump
room, an integral salt-water service,
and an outlet canal.
A license has been issued for
establishment of a crematorium a t
Centennial Park Cemetery, Spring-
bank. The contract for the building
—estimated to cost more than £50,000
—has gone to S. I. Weir Pty. Ltd.
The job should be completed by June
30 next year.

built at Kingscole, Kangaroo Island,
at a cost of £30,000. It will be
erected at the corner of Dauncey and
Murray Streets, on the site of the
present council offices. Adelaide archi'
tect W. D. Cowell has called tenders.
The plan provides for a large hall
suitable for films, dances, and similar
functions. There will also be a small
gallery, banqueting room, kitchen,
restroom for mothers and babies, and
two shops.
The first of the structural columns
on the western side of the new
£33,000 stand at Memorial Drive ten'
nis courts has been concreted. All
foundations are in. The contractors,
Hansen and Yuncken Pty. Ltd., expect
to complete the stand —designed to
seat 2500 —in time for the State ten'
nis titles in January. Work began late
in June.
A new two'Storey Roman Catholic
parish school is being built at the
corner of Military Road and Swan
Street, Semaphore. It will cost
£36,500 and accommodate 500 chib
dren from kindergarten to Interme'
diate standard. Aluminium window
frames and a steel and corrugated
asbestos roof will be features of the
school, which should be completed by
January. There will be a library,
typing and teachers’ rooms, a sick
bay, and an office. The balconies and
verandahs will be enclosed and used
as cloak and lunch rooms. Work is
already well advanced. The ground
floor is complete, and brickwork on
the second floor is almost finished.
The architect is E. A. Keal, and F.
Fricker is the contractor.
Some Adelaide architects believe
the building boom ahead of South
Australia may force them to become
their own builders and contractors.
The desirability of architects entering
this sphere of the building industry
was recently discussed by the S.A.
Institute of Architects. Although no
definite move has been made in this
direction, architects are known to be
concerned whether builders and con'
tractors can meet the increased de'
mand for their services. With big
Housing Trust and commercial build'
ing schemes just getting under way,
the shortage of contractors is likely
to be acute.
A modern two'Storey building with
accommodation for six shops and
parking space on the upper levels for
92 cars may be built in Gawler
Place soon. Plans for the building
are being sponsored by an Adelaide
businessman, Mr. H. H. Handby. and
a partner who is at present overseas.
A firm decision on the project is ex'
pected cshortly.
Structural work on the new Radio
Corporation Pty. Ltd. building in
Flinders Street, City, should be com'
pleted by March next year. It is
being raised on the foundations and
walls of a burnt'out building formerly
occupied by Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd.
Underpinning of the main walls and
the under'floor drainage system have
been finished, and pouring of concrete
columns to support the ground floor
is under way. The new five'Storey
building, which will cost £87,000, is
not expected to be ready for occupa'
tion for at least twelve months. Han'
sen and Yuncken Pty. Ltd. are the
contractors. Supervising architects are

ASPHALT ON FLAT ROOFS
Mr. Oliver S. Chesterton, M.C., F.R.1.C.5., in a paper given at a general meeting
of Quantity Surveyors at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in London
on October 21st, 1953, said, under “Roofs 11 :—
I have more than once been disappointed with the lasting qualities of
asphalt in large flat roofs ... it is tempting, when trying to keep down
the cost of a job, to employ an asphalting firm of no great reputation,
because they have quoted a highly competitive price . . . therefore, I
plead with Quantity Surveyors to make certain that asphalt roofing is
carried out by a first-class firm.”
Neuchatel Standardised Mastic Asphalt
for Roofing
• is manufactured to British Standard Specification in modern mechanically'
agitated cookers and all the processes of manufacture are under the supervision
of an experienced industrial chemist;
• is delivered to the job in hexagonal blocks, branded with the name “Neuchatel 11
and bearing the distinguishing letter “R 11 —to indicate that the material has
been manufactured to the British Standard Roofing Specification. These blocks
are re'inelted and used on the job without addition or alteration;
• is laid by skilled and experienced craftsmen in accordance with the British
Standard Code of Practice.
Fifty years of experience, full technical information, first'dass workmanship and
expert supervision go with Neuchatel Standardised Mastic Asphalt quality for

Mount Gambier, have started work.
Few Australian towns have as much
building activity in their main street
as Port Augusta. Buildings worth
hundreds of thousands of pounds are
under construction, and several will be
finished before the end of the year.
A modern Arcade is going up at the
southern end of the main street —
Commercial Road. It will include five
shops. Further down the street, G.
J. Coles Ltd. are building a store and
warehouse of Mount Gambier stone.
These should be completed by the
end of November. The Savings
Bank’s two'Storey £140,000 banking
chambers opposite the Town Hall are
rapidly taking shape, and many
smaller jobs are under way elsewhere
in Commercial Road.
Work will begin soon on the pro'
posed Westbourne Park Memorial
Hall in Goodwood Road. It will serve
as a memorial hall and R.S.L. club'
rooms, and will cost £12,700 to erect.
The Mitcham Council will pay £B4BO
towards the building, and the West'
bourne Park sub'branch of the R.S.L.
will supply the balance. The con'
struction will be of red brickwork,
asbestos cement roofing, coloured
cement'rendered entry portion, and
selected brick flower boxes. Seating
accommodation for 400 and a dance
floor are included in the plans. The
architects are Garlick, Jackman and
Gooden, and F .F. Welford 6? Sons
are the builders.
The Prince Alfred College Council
has accepted a tender for erection of
the College war memorial—a two'
storey wing of ten classrooms. The
name of the contractor has not yet
been released. The total cost of the
memorial building, together with ne'
cessary equipment, and the conversion
of three existing classrooms into a
modern library, will approach £50,000.
The building is scheduled for comple'
tion early next year. Hassell and Me'
Connell are the architects.
A recent meeting of the Council of
the S.A. Institute of Architects elect'
ed the following office'bearers for the
ensuing year: President, Mr. L. G.
Bruer; Past President, Mr. W. T.
Haslam, who is still a member of the
Council; Vice-President, Mr. J. C.
Irwin; Secretary, Mr. Gavin Walkley;
Assistant Secretary, Mr. R. V.
Boehm: Treasurer, Mr. R. O. Shep-
hard. Also elected members of the
Council were Messrs. D. W. Berry,
L. Lavbourne'Smith, K. M. Yelland,
J. S. Hall.
The Port Pirie City Council has
decided to borrow £90,000 from the
Savings Bank of S.A. to finance con-
struction of an abattoirs.
Within seven months, South Aus'
tralia will have a modern motel which
will provide a 24'hour service for
motorists and transport drivers on the
Gawler Road, ten miles from Adelaide.
It will accommodate 24 visitors in
four hutettes. The structure, to be
built of Mount Gambier stone, has
been designed by architect B.
Megson.
Cement brick manufacture at Yata'
la Labour Prison will be trebled—
from 1,500,000 to 4,500,000 bricks a
year. The Government has approved
the purchase of machinery to lift pro'
duction. Bricks made at the prison
are sold to the Housing Trust and
Government Departments.
The new West Beach Airport is
expected to be partly in use by
Christmas. Construction of temporary
passenger and flying control facilities
is well under way. The Director of
Works (Mr. W. T. Haslam) has also
announced the signing of a £4600
contract with Hansen and Yuncken
Ltd. for piling work for the perma-
nent terminal building.
Naracoorte’s best'kown landmark—
the 90ft. spire over the Presbyterian
Church—will be rebuilt soon. This
time it will be constructed of steel
and aluminium alloy instead of slate
and timber. Early this year steeple'
jacks reported that the spire was urn
safe and likely to collapse in a storm.
An appeal for funds to build a new
spire raised £7OOO, and the contract
has been let to Mr. George Klecka,
of Naracoorte. The work has started,
and should be completed by
Christmas.
Negotiations are in progress for
the purchase by Cox Brothers (Aus'
tralia) Ltd. of the Rex Theatre, which
adjoins their premises in Rundle
Street. It is understood that Cox
Bros, intend jto demolish the theatre,
and erect a five'Storey building in its
place. The Rex, built in 1911. is
owned by a private company and held
under lease by Hoyts Theatres Ltd.
Tenders have closed for construe'
tion of a new two'decker reinforced
concrete and steel Derby stand at
Morphettville Racecourse. It is to be
built for the S.A. Jockey Club. The
stand will be 150 ft. long, with stand'
ing room for 3350, seating accom'
modation for 350, a restaurant, two'
lane cafeteria, and 100'feet'lone bar.
The architects are E. H. McMichael
and Harris.
South Australia built 1363 fewer
houses in the year just ended, com'
pared with 1952'53. This is shown
in statistics compiled from builders’
returns. Most noticeable drop was in
brick houses. In the past financial
year, 5226 brick, stone or solid con'
struction homes were raised 551
fewer than in the previous year. In
all, 7644 dwellings of all types were
built in 195 30 4, compared with 9007
the previous year.
The Church Missionary Society
will modernise its recently acquired
premises in King William Street, City,
ihe present building is twootorey and
consists of two separate shops with
dwellings. These will be converted
and extended. The architects, Lucas
and Parker, have called tenders.
Plans for the beautification of the
Port Augusta foreshore are beginning
to take shape. The council has been
shown a preliminary sketch providing
for an amusement park, paddling
pool, car park, trees and lawns. Hous'
ing Trust architect W. L. Limington
is now working on the final plans.
Work will begin soon on a £4OOO
nursing block for the Salisbury and
District Hospital. The State Govern'
ment will subsidise the work on a £
for £ basis. Ihe new block will re'
place present nurses’ quarters, which
are in a building badly affected by
damp. J. Lyons is the architect.
A memorial stone to the late
Joseph Lampard will be erected in
the grounds of the Eudunda District
Hospital. Mr. Lampard, who died re'
cently, bequeathed a large sum to the
hospital. Erection will cost £5OO.
Mr. W. Blake, of Waikerie, designed
the stone, and Mr. W. Both, of
Eudunda, has the contract.
EUROPEAN MACHINE TOOL
EXHIBITION.
The fourth European Machine Tool
Exhibition, representing Belgium,
France, Germany, Britain, Italy,
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland,
was held in Milan during September
last. More than 750 exhibitors from
12 different countries contributed,
through 70 individual firms.
A very large exhibit was provided
by the Swiss tool indutry, comprising
grinding machines, profile and turning
automatic tools of all types. These
machines have been designed for the
mass production of geometrically'
shaped parts, requiring turning and
threading within exact limits of
tolerance.
The metrological qualities and per'
feet finish demanded by manufactur'
ers of precision instruments in gene'
ral and the watchmaking industry in
particular have stimulated the inven-
tiveness of designers of automatic
machines.
The variety and number of auto'
matic tools originating from Switzer'
land are truly amazing and are very
fully described in “Swiss Technics”

view of the frecasting by Sweden of

Failure of the Hills District Com'

cost the N.S.W. Government
£101,726. The payment was to meet
loans guaranteed by the Government.
Disposal of the Society’s total assets
is not expected to reach more than
£26,000, which will be paid into Con'
solidated Revenue.
The Society began home'building
operations at Penrith, Goulburn and
in the Sydney metropolitan area in
1946.
In 1947, on the recommendation of
the Co-operative Building Advisory
Committee, the State Government
guaranteed the Society’s loans for
£50,000.
In the current issue of “Trends,”
the N.S.W. Rural Bank warns that
too much finance for home-building
would react against builders as equally
as would a continuing shortage of
building materials and labour.
Unless the building industry labour
force was expanded and more mat-
erial made available, liberal home-
building finance could lead to an in-
crease in the commencement rate of
homes and a decrease in completed
dwellings.
This, in turn would reflect in the
cost of homes being built, the article
added.
Erection of 400 War Service homes
has begun on the Lewis Gordon Es-
tate, Bankstown. Blocks of land
worth about £5OO each on the open
market will be made available to ap-
plicants for homes at less than £l4O
for each site.
The State Government has set up
a committee to investigate a number
of amendments to the Landlord and
Tenant Act, including removal of rent
control on new premises, and added
powers for home-owners to evict
tenants.
Sydney City Council has let con-
tracts for erection of its first parking
stations. The contracts are worth
£250,000.
Sir Lindsay Parkinson (Aust.l Pty.
Ltd., Sydney, submitted the lowest
tender, £222,000, which was accepted.
Separate tenders of £22,075 for lift
installation and £10,785 for electrical
installation were also, accepted.
The station will have open-decks
and ramps and will accommodate 432
cars. -
Site of Sydney’s new Opera House
is to be at the corner of College and
Liverpool Streets, opposite the south-
west corner of Hyde Park.
Wollongong City Council has ap-
proved the application of Sir Lindsay
Parkinson (Aust.) Pty, Ltd., Sydney,
to build 38 homes, valued at £120,000
on the Figtree sub-division. Houses
will be of brick veneer and weather-
board.
The erection and completion of a
C.M.F. training depot at Lismore will
cost £45,598; a similar depot at Dee
Why will cost £53,250.
A new army depot at Beaton Park,
Wollongong, will cost £72,000 and
will be erected in two stages.
State Premier Cahill has promised
that trains will be running on the
new Circular Quay railway loop by
December, 1955. The whole work
will not be completed by that time,
but the overhead road and railway
station will be far enough advanced
to allow trains to begin operations.
An £lBO,OOO five-story A.M.P.
office block will be erected in thriv-
ing Wollongong. The building will
provide large accommodation for the
A.M.P. Society’s district office, and
four upper storeys, with total floor
space of 24,600 sq. ft. will be let.
Construction of a memorial great
gate and gallery of fine arts at Syd-

Considerable industrial and commer
dal building is in hand in Sydney
metropolitan area, and many fine new
premises are being erected at a total
cost of hundreds of thousands of
pounds. If this upward trend con'
tinues, record expenditure is tipped
for industrial and commercial con'
struction in N.S.W., which rose to
yond building contractors’ capacity
Hotel building and reconstruction
has also taken a decided spurt in re'
cent weeks. Some £200,000 alone will
be spent on alterations and exten'
sions to existing King’s Cross hotels.
Australian trading banks are also
purchasing many properties for con'
version to ,or erection of bank prem'
ses. This remarkable expansion is
particularly noticeable in suburban
areas.
The M.B.A. of N.S.W. has an'
nounced a new policy regarding “rise
and fall” clauses in contracts. It has
asked its members not to sign con'
tracts in future unless they contain
rise and fall clauses.
It is feared that marginal increases
might mean big rises in labour and
materials costs. Prices might rise be'
to absorb them, the announcement
yound building contractors’ capacity
said.
The State Government has allocat'
ed £53,845,000 for public works and
services for the 19 54'5 5 financial
year.
£250,000 will be spent mainly on
construction of shops, provision of
emergency accommodation, and slum
clearance.
£4,250,000 will enable completion
of major hospital buildings at 18
centres this year.
£5,925,000 education expenditure
includes £4,000,000 for school build'
ings and facilities. About 27 large
primary and secondary school build'
ings now under construction should
be completed this year.
£1,000,000 has been allocated to
State and mental hospitals construe'
tion.
£700,000 will go towards the Quay
Railway works, and a further £250,000
from the Education grant will go to'
wards the Sydney University building
programme and development of
N.S.W. University of Technology.
The N.S.W. Housing Commission
lost £90,906 in rental arrears to June
30 1a5t—£26,793 more than in June
1953.
2818 tenants received notice to
quit, and approval to proceed to evic'

The 8.1. C. president, Mr. S. D. C.
Kennedy, has advocated that one
house in every three should be allo-
cated to a migrant building trades-
man after the worker has been in
Australia a year. During this period
he would have built the equivalent to
one house. Mr. Kennedy added.
NEW ENGINEERING INDUSTRY
FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
English Firms Opens Branch
At Whyalla.
A further link between English
and Australian industry was forged
on September 26 last, when the Pre-
mier of South Australia, the Hon.
Thomas Playford . opened the new
turbo-generator factory of C. A. Par-
sons of Australia Ltd. at Whyalla.
Industrialists from all over Austra-
lia attended the opening of the fac-
tory, which is established in salt-bush
country opposite the B.H.P. ship-
yards. The bush-like scene is being
transformed to one of a garden
nature, as the factory is surrounded
by a garden containing over 900
shrubs. ,
Among the visitors to the opening
ceremony, which also included State
parliamentarians, were Brigadier J. E.
G. Martin, of the Queensland Elec-
tric Authority; Mr. R. W. J. McKay,
Chief Electrical Engineer of the
N.S.W. Railways; Mr. Willis Con-
nolly, General Manager of the State
Electricity Commission, Victoria; Mr.
J. Roberts, Chief Mechanical En-
gineer, the State Electricity Commis-
sion of Victoria; Mr. F. C. Drew,
Chairman, Electricity Trust of South
Australia: Messrs. R, H. M. Lea,
General Manager, and K. H. Milne,
Chief Engineer, also the Electricity
Trust of South Australia; Mr. J. G.
Burnell, Managing Director, Thomp-
son’s Ltd., of Castlemaine.
Opening Ceremony.
In welcoming the visitors, South
Australian-born Sir Claude Gibb,
Chairman and Managing Director of
the parent firm in England and
Chairman of the Australian Company,
said that it was particularly appro-
priate that the Premier should be
present, as it was on his advice that
the Company came to Whyalla. As
the erection of the building pro-
gressed, that advice was found to be
of the best.
Sir Claude paid a tribute to the
many administrators and workmen
who had helped with advice and en-
couragement in such a short time, as
it was only eighteen months ago that
a decision had been made to build at
Whvalla.
He also added a special expression
of thanks to the Directors and local
staff of the Broken Hill Proprietary
Co. Ltd. for making the building site
available and for special facilities,
particularlv the ready availability of
steel supplies. The main contractors

for the plant, the S.A. engineering
firm of Gibb and Miller Ltd., who
designed and erected the steel work
and installed the plant, also received
a word of thanks. Sir Claude said
Mr. A. J. Gibb, the Managing Direc'
tor of the firm, was his elder brother,
and it is not often one finds the
younger brother being able to boss
his senior brother.
In declaring the factory officially
open, the Premier said that he had
seen several factories in America and
Great Britain, but none of them com'
pared with this plant, and it gave him
great pleasure to be associated with
the opening of such a magnificent
factory. He added that the Company
and the B.H.P. by continuing to co'
operate as they had could make
Whyalla one of the great industrial
centres of Australia. He assured Sir
Claude that his Company was web
corned at Whyalla because Australia
was developing very rapidly. No
country could develop industrially
without electrical power.
The parent firm of C. A. Parsons
Co. Ltd., of Newcastle'on'Tyne,
had a world'wide reputation as a
leajder in the field of generator manu'
facture. He concluded by saying the
fact that the firm had come to South
Australia meant not only that the
State’s future requirement# would be
met, but that a lead had been given
to other industries to establish them'
selves there.
The Plant.
The factory comprises a single bay
400 ft. by 60ft., with an annexe 25ft.
wide housing the administration
offices, drawing office, messrooms and
storerooms.
The machines are painted cream
and green and with the
building’s interior scheme of cream
and blue.
A HANDY ELECTRICAL DRILL
The Desonter, a handy multum-in-parvo,
two-speed electric drill weighs only 9½

Failure of Community Building Society
GOVERNMENT MEETS GUARANTEED LOANS.
The failure of the Hills District Community Advance-
ment Co-operative Society Ltd. has cost the N.S.W. Govern-
ment ,£101,726.
The payment was to meet loans guaranteed by the
Government.
It is reported that disposal of the
Society’s total assets is not expected
to meet more than £26,000, which
will be paid into Consolidated Re'
venue.
The Society commenced home'
building operations at Penrith, Gouh
burn and in the Sydney metropolitan
area in 1946.
In 1947, on the recommendation
of the Cooperative Building Ad'
visory Committee, the State Govern'
ment guaranteed the Society’s loans
for £50,000.
Objects of C.A. Societies.
Under the Cooperation Act, 1923'
1945, the object of a Community
Advancement Society is to provide
any community service or benefit.
For this purpose it may establish and
operate public utilities, factories,
silos, cold'Stores, abattoirs, drafting'
yards, garages, machinery repair
shops, etc., erect buildings (including
dwellings) for members, provide
buildings and grounds for education
or recreation and promote clubs to
use them . . .
This type of society provides a
“simple and inexpensive method” of
procuring corporate existence by
such bodies as community centres,
etc . ,
(If the loss of <£101,726 to the
N.S.W. Government is a “simple and
inexpensive method” of building
dwellings, this Journal would cer'
tainly hate to see a difficult and ex'
pensive method of erecting homes!
We are sure none of the taxpayers,
from whose pocket this money is
taken, would consent to such induh
gences in their name. The Govern'
ment’s function is to administer
wisely to all, not lavish foolishly to a
few.)
Building Advisory
The Act also provides for a Co'
operative Building Advisory Com'
mittee of not less than three and not
more than six members, including
the Registrar as Chairman, and the
Treasury Under - Secretary or a
Treasury officer nominated by him.
The Committee’s duties are to
submit recommendations to the Min'
ister in connection with the promo'
tion and operation of Cooperative
Building Societies.
Most of the Building Societies are
functioning well at the moment, and
no exception has been taken against
the way their affairs are run. But
what has happened above has hap'
pened before and could happen again.
In fact, were we hit by even a
moderate depression and this has
happened before the Government
could find itself swamped with un'
redeemed pledges—a “fine bill to
foot’’ on a failing market.
We stoutly maintain that it is the
function of the Government to ad'
minister and provide the major under'
takings vital to life and well-being for
all—roads and bridges, railways and
electricity, water and sewerage, to
which tasks it has set outself out to
do. If it did these things alone it
would have its hands full enough,
without dabbling in the building of
tiddly'winking cottages which private
enterprise has always provided
promptlv. adequately and well in the
past. There was nothing shoddy in
the buildings in days gone by if

SLIDE DOORS
ON
■bM mBBSm
Houses sell quickly when
you install sliding
doors on BANGOR Track
These two houses are pretty much alike. But one
sold before the paint was on the walls and the
other was “For Sale” months after it was finished.
These days when money is
tighter a house has to offer
something extra to sell fast.
The quick-selling house has
sliding doors one in the
kitchen and another lead-
ing onto a sun deck. It
was those two doors that
caught the buyer’s eye.
SPACE SAVING
Install sliding doors in
every house you build—all
runnning on Bangor Slid-
ing Door Track.
It’s amazing the space they
add to an ordinary 10 to
12 square house. Buyers
are impressed when you
tell them every sliding door
gives them 9 square feet
more living space. They
like the idea of sliding
doors, too.
MODERN APPEARANCE
Bangor Track will carry
any type of door from
standard-size flush doors to
big custom-made jobs. It’s
as suitable in the laundry
as the living room. Conceal
the working parts under a
modern pelmet.
BUILDER SI Find out all about Bangor Sliding Door Track
INSTALLING BANGOR
COSTS VERY LITTLE
And it’s so simple. One man can
put up a sliding door in an hour
or two. There’s *iOt much difference
between that and hinges. Convert-
ing existing swinging doors to
sliding ones is simple, too.
SLIDE THE
GARAGE DOOR
ON BANGOR,
TOO
No one wants to buy a house where
they’d be battling with old-fashioned
garage doors fighting to swing
doors against the wind. Bangor
“Round the Corner” track runs the
doors neatly along the side wall of
the garage. Rolls open with just a
slight push.

erected by master builders. They had
reputations to safeguard and proud
they were of them.
The Government as a matter of
fact, keeps a whole Housing Commis-
sion in order to continue this “dab-
bling” into the affairs rightly belong-
ing to private enterprise.”
The trouble is, the Government
has issued so many laws containing
“THOU SHALT NOT”
framed by its own bureaucrats in the
last 30 years that it has done nothing
more than strangle private enterprise,
which has had, perforce, to withdraw
from the market, and. having done
this, the Government feels it in-
cumbent upon itself to step into the
breach and provide homes and other
buildings at taxpayers’ expense.
It is time our laws were altered so
that those who wartt to spend money
on buildings would be permitted to
spend it and make a profit on it, as
they are permitted to make a profit
in every kind of enterprise,, other-
wise nothing would exist.
Nothing could exist without a
profit motive even “a labourer is
worthy of his hire.” Why single out
property owners for deprivation,
when they supply, and always have
supplied, so dire a need as housing
the masses.
Perhaps if our laws said:
“THOU SHALT”
or, better still,
“THOU MAYEST”
instead of
“THOU SHALT NOT,”
it would help a lot.
Smoke Panel For
Wollongong
The Greater Wollongong City
Council is to set up a smoke abate-
ment panel similar to that at New-
castle.
The smoke and dust problem is
far greater in Wollongong and
Kembla than it is in Newcastle.
The main smoke and dust offend-
ers on the South Coast are coke fac-
tories, industries, power houses, and
harbour shipping, Aid. R. Birch, of
Greater Wollongong City Council,
told the Newcastle Council’s Smoke
Abatement Panel.
In the Legislative Assembly last
week. Local Government Minister
Renshaw said consideration should
be. given to setting un a special com-
mittee to investigate the dangers
caused by smoke in metropolitan in-
dustrial areas.
(Smoke is blamed for 340 deaths
in the Leichhardt area in four years
up to 1952.)
IMAGINATION IN DESIGN WITH ARCHITECTURAL CONCRETE.
The Y.M.C.A. Building in Oklahoma City, U.S.A., is an example of imagination
applied to the treatment of concrete building frontages. The bold combination of
vertical vanes for the lower floors and wide horizontal panels for the upper creates
an unusual and impressive style. Concrete gives architectural Ideas full play.
For any size or design the architect with creative imagination can produce
enduring though low-cost structures of outstanding appearance.

TO
BUILDERS
AND
MASTER PAINTERS
Ever since the Berger Group of
Companies pioneered the estab-
lishment of a Paint and Colour
Advisory Bureau known as the
Mayfair Colour Centre, this unit
has proved of great assistance to
Builders, Master Painters, Con-
tractors, Architects and others
interested in the problems of
surface treatments on buildings,
new and old.
To-day throughout Australia
thousands of homes, factories,
offices, hospitals, banks and
other institutions have been
colour schemed by Mayfair, with
results that have always reflected
credit on the Contractor con-
cerned.
The services of the Mayfair
Colour Centre are given com-
pletely without charge. Skilled
colour consultants prepare colour
schemes for smaller buildings
and carry out a complete pre-
painting survey for larger pro-
jects where paint and colour are
used not only to beautify and
protect, but also to improve
working conditions, assist in
traffic control, help prevent
accidents, increase production
efficiency and fulfil numerous
other functional tasks.
The Mayfair Colour Centre is
always available to help in
YOUR painting problems.
Mayfair is a SERVICE unit and
wants to be of service to YOU.

NEW CHURCH FOR
NEW LAMBTON.
A church of modern design in brick
and concrete is to be erected .on
Methodist property in Regent Street,
New Lambton, at an estimated cost of
'.13,000. Designed by Messrs. C. H.
Smith and Johnson, architects, of
Sydney, the central feature of the
building will be a tower. The interior
will be of chaste design expressing
dignity and reverence, and will acconv
modate 220 people.
The contractor, Mr. R. Keevers,
Master Builder, of Merewether, will
begin work in the near future, and
the Foundation Stone will be set on
December 11.
NEW PRODUCTION UNIT AT WILLOUGHBY.
G. Herring (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
G. Herring (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.'s new factory, now under construction at Willoughby,
will be an attractive industrial building of 30,000 sq. ft. floor area, with provision
for an additional 20,000 sq. ft. It has been specially designed for a sloping site,
which provides space for a large basement under the northern end, with separate
access from the Gibbs Street frontage. The entrance to the main factory floor is
from Short Street. The first floor will comprise administrative offices, Board Room,
and large modern cafeteria. Construction of the building generally is of a steel
frame with orthodox sawtooth roofing. The first storey has a floor constructed of
frontages are mainly standard unit steel frame windows. The northern elevation
is of steel construction, bulk of which is glazed with a combination of standard
sawtooth glazing bars with opening steel window frames. The external walls about
the texture brick base will be finished with "liquid envelope." This allowed the
use of plain asbestos-cement sheets butted together, with no interrupting or pro-
jecting cover slips. The main entrance will have a large stone-flagged forecourt
as an approach. Broad stone steps lead to the entrance doors, which are in turn
set in a recessed glass wall. The architects were Messrs. Davey and Brindley; the
consulting engineer, Mr. J. P. Hallett; and the Master Builder, Mr. Peter Cussell.
(Ed. We are glad to see North Sydney providing a near outlet for City expansion,
and we hope the Council will encourage business firms to build its new "Twin City
of Sydney" worthily and expeditiously by providing transport facilities such as
wide roads, whilst resumptions of properties can be put through before they
become prohibitive. The City of Sydney has done its level best to push people
out of the City into the far-flung suburbs. Councils in the last 40 or 50 years
have been too niggardly, too anaemic to embrace their situation by coping with
traffic, nor will it allow buildings to go higher to enable private enterprise to
cope with self-contained, all-purpose large buildings which will keep people entirely
off the streets by taking them from their tailors' shops, florists, grocers, cake shops
or restaurants, all within the buildings, upwards by lift to their flats, instead of
outwards by rail, tram or bus, which they insist on at present. Such travel tedium
just racks the nervous system of the users to bits. The City Council is going to
pay dearly for Its narrow vision, for hamstringing enterprise and kicking folks
round, when it sees a rival city growing up on the North Side of the Harbour,
as grow it must, since people accustomed to developing and living gregariously
are not going to change their ways of life to oblige unvisionary city aldermen,
who since Sir Allen Taylor's day have done everything to restrict but nothing to
progress their city. They have been entrusted with the care of this city and its
developmenot. They have failed in that trust.)

ROMANTIC OR UTILITARIAN.
Many people, when designing their homes, conjure up all sorts of sentimental pictures in their mind-dormer windows
massive chimneys. Juliet balconies, oriel windows, etc., etc. Others, perhaps with less of the romantic in their make-up, are
quite happy to have a root over their heads, providing it keeps the water out. Our artist puts forward ideas to cater for all
priate relationship and proportion to the others, so that each room serves its individual function and there is no
unnecessary walking about or interference as the various members of the family carry out their daily tasks.
