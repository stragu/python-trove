Air Line Terminals get that smart
ultra-modern look at little cost—with
CS.R. BUILDING MATERIALS
Next time you travel by air look
around you in the Air Terminals.
Whether you travel by A.N.A. or
T.A.A. you’ll see the latest ideas
in building materials —low cost
building materials — put to the
most modern use. At Eagle Farm
(A.N.A.), Cane-ite is used for
the walls—and this is where it’s
really brought home to you that
Cane-ite insulates as well as
decorates. Even in a Brisbane
summer the atmosphere is cool
inside this terminal because of
the Cane-ite walls which are
beautifully decorated with murals.
600 miles away in Sydney you
will see the smartness of C.S.R.
Floor Tiles in the T.A.A. termi-
nal. Thousands of air travellers
walk backwards and forwards
over this floor almost every hour
hour of the day. Yet the tiles
always look fresh and gleaming
— it takes only one polisher
three-quarters of an hour in the
small hours of the morning to
keep them looking so smart.
Then back at Eagle Farm
again look up at the Cane-ite
Acousti-Tile Ceiling in the dining
room which absorbs two-thirds of
all noise. That explains why,
with all the noise of arriving and
departing planes and buses and
messages over the public address
system, there is still an atmos-
phere of calm.
All modern airport terminals
give vou the impression of being
surrounded by efficiency and
streamlined comfort. You can
introduce this same efficiency,
smartness and insulated comfort
into your own business, factory
premises or home. For lower
tenders always ask for quotations
which include C.S.R. Building
Materials.

Dine at Eagle Farm and you dine in
calm, restful quiet, with most of the busy
airport's noisiness EXCLUDED. That's
because the Cane-ite Acousti-Tile ceilina
absorbs two-thirds of all noise.
Walk' into the Sydney A.N.A. City
Terminal and the smartness of C.S.R.
floor tiles takes your eye. Even after the
busiest day this floor looks fresh and
smiling. Requires minimum attention.

... short cut to
customer goodwill
The new "DULUX WALL COLOUR" GUIDE ensures
colour harmony, together with customer harmony.
Until now colours had to be chosen from a colour
card, with only limited choice, or specially tinted
on the job, in an attempt to obtain a colour
vaguely described by the customer. Now the
thrilling, new and unbelievably lovely "DULUX
WALL COLOURS" offer a choice that is almost
limitless. Your customer can "pin-point" the exact
colour desired, involving at most a simple blend-
ing and eliminating trial-and-error mixing.

fOA PROTECTION
FOR PRESERVATION
FOR HIGH REFLECTIVITY
Almost every surface that is exposed to corrosion by salt atmos-
pheres, or the smoke and acidity of industrial regions, can be
protected and preserved by the superior resistant power of
"Alpaste” Aluminium Paint.
"Alpaste” is an aluminium paint pigment in paste form which,
whilst avoiding the drawbacks of powder pigment, retains such
desirable properties as "leafing” and high reflectivity. In addition,
"Alpaste” gives more complete opacity (a layer of only 1/2,000th
of an inch thick will completely obscure the underlying surface,
however dark and dreary). Moreover, "Alpaste” gives 10% to
20% greater coverage power.
"Alpaste” is recommended as a preservative for wood, brickworic,
i, steel, magnesium, plaster, stucco and asphalt.

Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste’
Paint Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium which, when
mixed with a suitable medium, "leaf” and form an opaque and durable metallic shield. Moreover,
"Alpaste’s” high reflectivity and low heat absorption factor help to maintain a temperate interior
wherever it is used externally.

The Great Melbourne Fire left only one
building intact in a whole city block
GRINNELL SPRINKLERS SAVED IT!
In 1897 the city of Melbourne
suffered the fire that is still known as
‘The Great Melbourne Fire.”
From Flinders Street to Flinders
Lane, from Elizabeth to Swanston
Street, warehouses were reduced to
smoking shells. Yet right in the
middle of the area the Mutual Store
stood intact.
As the Melbourne Argus of
November 22, 1897, writes —“None
of the buildings was more fiercely
attacked than the Mutual Store and,
while the others were gutted with
phenomenal speed, the store stoutly
and successfully resisted.”
The Argus continues, “The test
which the Grinnell Sprinklers (which
protect the building in all areas)
received, served to show that they
could be relied upon to come into
play where the heat was allowed to
rise to the necessary temperature.
Wherever the fire encroached to any
extent the sprinklers operated.”
Today, over 50 years later, the
block around the Mutual Store has
been rebuilt and almost without
exception the buildings are fitted with
Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler systems.

THE PROBLEM OF COSTS
MANUFACTURERS’ PRESIDENT CONCERNED.
Two leaders of industry have re'
cently spoken on the problem of pro'
duction costs.
In the wider sphere of general in'
dustry Mr. R. Parry-Okeden, Presi'
dent of the Chamber of Manufactur'
ers of N.S.W., at the annual meeting
of that body said: “Costs in Austra'
lian industry are bigger, and have
grown faster, than those in any other
country.
“If imports are allowed once again
to flow freely while Australia’s pro'
duction costs are so much greater
than those of other countries, the re'
sultant ‘explosion’ would wreck Aus'
tralia.”
Mr. C. E. Thompson, President
of the Master Builders' Association
of N.S.W., in the Eightieth Annual
Report of the Association said; “Rising
costs are a continuing problem, and
we must realise that they will never
return to pre-war rates. The “bene-
fits’ of a 40hour week, two weeks’
annual leave, one week’s sick leave,
ten public holidays, increased margins
and last, but not least, long service
leave—all ‘given’ by Government
Statute—cannot be enjoyed without
increasing posts.'”
In these two statements lie the es-
sence of the national dilemma that
has arisen from the continued emphasis
towards the establishment of the so-
cialised “Welfare State.” No one be-
grudges the people the best standard
of living that is possible but it must
be borne in mind that fundamentally
the living conditions of any nation
are only as good or as bad as the
nation can economically afford to
support. As in all things, there must
be equilibrium. Work creates wealth:
if we work less, there is a reduction
in national wealth. The question is
not can we work less and take out
more, but how long can this be done
before economic disaster comes about.
In these post-war years there have
been many favourable factors to allow
both shorter hours and increased so-
cial benefits to carry on concurrently
inflated wool prices, war produc-
tion, bounteous seasons—but there
are now signs that the pendulum could
be about to turn,
Mr. Parry-Okeden and many other
thoughtful industrialists think that the
nation is in lad shape to resist its
■impact.
There are, perhaps, some helpful
signs as mentioned by Mr. Thompson
who said: “This year has seen a re-
turn to commonsense from an indus-
trial point of view and the frivilous
stoppages which beset us last year
have practically ceased.” Rise and
Fall clauses are now being abandoned
and firm contracts are being demand-
ed and obtained, so the Building In-
dustry is doing its part to resist the
stresses that the future may bring.
But the country as a whole still has
to be made aware of the situation.
Rises in the basic wage even since
March, 1952, have increased the total
wage bill of Australia’s 46,000 fac-
tories by more than £66,000,000 a
year.
“Brave words and gallant phrases
are no answer to the appalling cost
position,” concluded Mr. Parry-Oke-
den.
A little more application, more effi-
ciency, less bureaucratic interference
and a little more real work would still
enable Australia to remain the para-
dise that it is. It will ultimately re-
main with the individual to determine
the future for certain basic economic
facts are immutable.

THE HOTEL REX, SYDNEY
£270,000 PROJECT AT POTTS POINT.
Intricate Remodelling.
The opening of the Hotel Rex in
Macleay Street, Potts Point, Sydney,
has introduced some interesting new
features.
These include a Continental-style
sidewalk cafe, a glass-enclosed coffee
bar built as a round wing abutting
on the footpath, and a roof beer
garden with movable glass enclosure.
The Initial Conception.
The Directors of Rex Investments
purchased two old houses known as
“Oriana” and “Baroda” several years
ago and in 1950 commissioned John
P. Tate 6? Associates, Architects, to
prepare a basic plan for the proposed
hotel.
That this original layout was well-
conceived and planned is borne out
by the fact that it was fundamentally
unchanged except for the fact that it
was finally decided to demolish
“Baroda” and start afresh when build-
ing restrictions eased, for as it was con-
structed it would never have been pos-
sible to add additional storeys to it.
After great departmental difficulties
had been overcome in respect to build-
ing materials and local government,
the sketches were passed by all bodies,
including the Licensing Court, and the
final working drawings were prepared
in May, 1952.
Rapid Construction
Vital.
Owing to the magnitude of the in-
vestment, and the lack of financial re-
turn during the progress of works, it
was imperative that a rapid rate of
construction was maintained, so Rex
Investments called in their subsidiary,
Rex Building Co., to put the work in
hand. The construction was on a
cost-plus basis, but with the builders
having a stake in the project, none of
the usual pitfalls of this type of build-
ing arrangement were encountered.
The architects having secured all
necessary permits and approvals from
the Council. Water Board, etc., for the
working drawings, it was possible to
proceed without delay and a large body
of building tradesmen swooped on the
job in July, 1952, under the control
of Mr. Norman Tyler, the manager
of Rex Building Co., and Mr. Keith
Van de Water, the works foreman,
with Mr. Terry Petersen, of John P.
Tate & Associates, as supervising archi-
tect.
The initial attack was upon
“Oriana,” where innumerable problems
of construction, drainage, plumbing
and other services were encountered.
The building was very old and brick
joints had deteriorated, pipes rusted,
electrical services become outmoded,
and white ants and borers had left
their toll over the years.
It very soon became apparent that
decisions relating to future policy were
needed to enable the architects to
prepare details in time to allow for
subcontracts to be let and work to be
put in hand if the required time-table
of nine months for the Oriana’
“house” section, was to be retained.
Weekly Progress
Meetings.
Mr. D. H. B. Adams, director of
Rex Investments, initiated weekly Pro-
gress Meetings, commencing at 4 p.m.
every Monday and frequently lasting
till midnight, which were attended by
Mr. Adams, representing the pro-
prietors, and Mr. Petersen, Mr. Tyler
and Mr. Van de Water. Later, when

Mr. Ehrlich, the Manager, arrived
from Hong Kong, and Mr. Donnelly
was nominated as future licensee, these
gentlemen were added to the ranks
of the meeting.
The results of this procedure soon
became apparent, and it can be said
that these meetings were the crux of
the remarkable speed of erection that
resulted.
1500 Drawings
Prepared.
The architects had a mammoth job
drawing details to keep up with the
rate of building, and in all over 1500
sketches and drawings were prepared,
including 340 finished details. At
times all members of the staff were
working on the Rex job, and much
overtime was involved. A fine team
of tradesmen was assembled, and an
enthusiasm of the job soon developed
which led to efficiency and good work'
manship. Australian, British, Italian
and other European tradesmen all pull'
ed together and worked early or late
as was needed to meet any contin'
gency.
Sub'contractors soon appreciated
that required delivery dates for their
materials or articles were in deadly
earnest and if in arrears, they received
a daily ’phone check'up from the
builder’s office which led to delivery,
in exasperation, if nothing else. Very
fine workmanship was revealed by sub'
contractors which led to the whole job
coming together very rapidly.,
Ma»or decisions of policy or finish
were referred back to the Board of
Rex Investments, but largely, decisions
were made on the job by Mr. Adams
and the architects and few delays were
encountered in this direction.
Bar Block Commences.
The work on the new bar block
commenced in November, 1952. with
the demolition of the old stone build'
ing Baroda” and the excavation by
mechanical shovel of the site for the
basement. The final layout of this
basement hinged on the profile of a
rock cliff which cut across the site
and became exposed by the excavation.
It was decided to vary the layout
slightly to economise on rock excava'
tion and at the same time allow the
largest possible cool rooms.
The construction of the job was
decided to be of structural brick walls,
with reinforced concrete columns and
slabs, with provision in the design for
a future additional floor on top of the
existing Basement, Ground and First
Floors.
General finishes used throughout
the Bars and Toilets, and in the Cool
Rooms and Cellar, are the results of
experience accumulated by Rex Invest'
ments in their several other hotel
premises, the information in respect
of hotel design produced by the archi'
tects from their previous hotel de'
signs, and also the best elements and
standards of accepted brewery practice.
Perfect Handling
System.
The result, it is considered, has pro*
duced an almost perfect system of
handling liquor from the brewery wag'
gons to the public over the counter,
with opportunities to satisfy every
taste or need with a minimum of
handling and a maximum of cleanli-
ness and efficiency. Stainless steel has
been used extensively for sinks, basins,
servery tops, kitchen fitments and
urinal stalls.
An electric hoist operates from the
Cellar in the Basement through the
Bottle Department and up to the
Lounge on the First Floor, where a
subsidiary Bottle Department is placed.

HOTEL MANHATTAN, SOUTH BRISBANE
ARTISTIC INTERIOR RECONSTRUCTION OF AN OLD HOTEL.
Architect: W. J. Maloney. Construction: Dessaix Concrete Construction.
By F. O. NIXON.
Those. people who remember the
cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg
that was displayed in a building at the
Haymarket end of George Street,
Sydney, in the closing years of last
century, must wonder why this kind
of picture display has died out. Ot
course, the silent film, followed by the
talking one, killed the cyclorama as a
box'office proposition. It will still be
remembered as a fine piece of blend'
ing of real land with the unreal, paint'
ed landscape; and the daily sessions,
when uniformed soldiers took the
“field” in mock battles, created scenes
and incidents that were so realistic
that one dear old lady visitor was
heard to remark “Well! I didn’t know
there was so much spare ground about
Sydney.” Illusions can carry us far,
as a farmer believed when he put
green glass goggles on his horse at a
time when the grass in his paddock
was sparse and brown.
The enjoyment that can be de'
rived from viewing pleasant scenes in
the form of murals is evidenced in
Mr. and Mrs. R. P. McGuire’s “Hotel
Manhattan,” Stanley Street, South
Brisbane. In the “Compass Room”
of primrose and light blue, the mural,
35ft. x 10ft., is a tinted majestic
photograph of Moreton Island and
the lighthouse on Cape Moreton, with
the Pacific Ocean in the forefront up
to the railed edge of the room, to all
appearance the deck of a steamer
(even though the magnificent carpet
on the floor might appear to be a big
risk to take with the sea spray during
a storm). The effect is most realistic.
The mural is excellently tinted to bring
up the green foliage of the Island’s
trees to reality. From the four pillars
in the room are slanting spurs with a
light at their terminals. On the wall
are the port and starboard lights and
the steering wheel of the ex'coastal
steamer “Kallatina.” The steering
wheel has become the face of an elec'
trie clock, and the ship's bell and a
lifebuoy or two complete the maritime
illusion.
In the centre of the ceiling of sound'
proof 8.1. acoustic tiling, produced
locally by Messrs. Healy Bros., is a
large compass face, from which this
room takes its name. Viewed from a
sumptuously furnished lounge on a
hot day, the enjoyment of this mural
need not fall far short of the rapture
of being on the seashore. Nor do art
connoisseurs need to quarrel over the
picture's merits, or demerits, because
the camera used to take the various
ground and aerial photographs was in
the hands of L. 6-? D. Keen, commer-
cial art photographers of high stand'
ing.
In three aerial trips of six hours of
flying time, more than 100 photo'
graphs were taken on negatives origin'

THE RECEPTION ROOM
BRISTOL HEALTH CENTRE SERVES 30,000 PEOPLE
PLANNED FOR EFFICIENCY.
Late last year a new health centre
was opened at the Knowle West hous'
ing estate, Bristol, England, as part of
an important experiment in the early
life of Britain’s Natonal Health
vice.
Known as the “William Budd
Health Centre,’’ it commemorates the
work of a prominent Bristol doctor
who died in 1879.
The British post - war National
Health Service Act empowered local
authorities to build, equip and main'
tain health centres, and the Knowle
West project was the first to be built
specifically for this purpose.
The Bristol Centre sprang from the
30,000 people on the Knowle West
estate, most of whom had been moved
from overcrowded areas in the city.

WAR MEMORIAL BLOCK.
First Section Completed.
Architects: Wm. C. Brown 8C Mowbray.
Builders: Messrs. A. W. Edwards Pty. Ltd.
On the 6th June, 1953, the first
section of the Newington College
War Memorial Class Room Block was
opened by Colonel T. G. Millner,
M.C., V.D.
This block comprises an extension
on the eastern end of the original
Preparatory School, and it includes
five new classrooms, each seating
thirty, and a General Purpose Room
and a new Colonnade and Balcony.
The rooms located in the old build'
ing have also been renovated as part
of the scheme.
The Colonnade provides access to
the old and new classrooms on the
Ground Floor and will be continued
in a further classroom extension, to
form the School Quadrangle.
The extension is a structural brick
building, with reinforced concrete
floors and with the external elevations
finished with cream faced bricks.
The roof is covered with deep corru'
gated asbestos cement, carrying on
from the roof of the existing building.
In the rooms themselves, particular
attention has been given to acoustic
treatment and to the general interior
painting. All rooms are painted in
light pastel shades, with different
colours on different floors. Attention
has also been given to artificial light'
ing, in order that it may be adequate
for any “Prep” requirements at night.
In each classroom, spacious cup'
boards for teachers and wide instruc'
tion boards are provided—all instruc'
tion boards are green and each has a
separate gridded flap, hinged over the
main board for graph work.

SYDNEY PORT STORAGE EXTENDED
NEW BOND AND FREE STORE IN OPERATION.
The overall expansion of the Port
of Sydney since the war has brought
manifold problems to the Maritime
Services Board.
Among the post-war problems has
been the need for a rapid turn-round
of shipping, and this in turn has been
mainly dependent upon the availabil-
ity of bond and warehouse accom-
modation within an area adjacent to
berthing and transit shed facilities.
Tenders Called.
Some years ago it became evident
that further bond facilities were war-
ranted to cater for the expanding
trade of the Port of Sydney, and in
1949 the Board invited tenders for
the construction of a large new six-
storey bond store.
The location decided upon was the
site of a form steel storage yard,
adjacent to the old Primary Produc-
ers’ Store, Walsh Bay. Messrs. H. W.
Thompson Pty. Ltd., Master Builders,
were the successful tenderers, and
the bond stone was designed by the
Maritime Services Board architectural
department, under Mr. David Baxter,
chief architect.
Well-Planned Store.
Construction began early in 1949
and the building was officially hand-
ed over to the Board on June 1 of
this year. Built of reinforced concrete
throughout, the new store (see illus-
tration), known as No. 15, is linked
with No. 3 store of the old Primary
Producers’ store on all levels, and with
No. 2 on the ground floor, by fire-
proof doors. This planning enabled
advantage to be taken of the existing
entrance from the higher level of
Windmill Street, which now gives ac-
cess to the third floor of the new
building.
Feature of Roof.
The red brick facing of the store,
with its green terra-cotta mullions,
present a very pleasing apeparance,
the copper downpipes helping to
break the main horizontal lines and
the aluminium-framed windows per-
mitting a maximum of natural day-
light.
A feature of the saw-tooth-type roof
is the use of reinforced concrete for
the trusses and the extensive use of
glass to provide ample lighting on the
top floor.
The building is also fitted with in'
candescent lighting, and is equipped
with adequate amenities for the staff.
Ready Access.
The three entrances from Hickson
Road (the main port roadway) are
13ft. wide, and give access to three
automatic electric freight lifts, design'
ed to carry 6720 lb., and which will
accommodate a battery-operated fork-
lift truck.
The entrances also give access to
;he hatchways for three electric high-
speed hoists of one ton capacity each,
mounted on monorails on the third-
floor ceiling.
The new bond and free store has
provided accommodation for an ad-
ditional 11,000 tons of cargo.
No fewer than 92,000 Italian fam-
ilies live in caves and primitive huts,
230,000 families in cellars or store-
rooms, and 1,780,000 families are liv-
ing with three or more people to one
room, according to an Italian Parlia-
mentary commission.

“The fundamental aims of this
Society are to group together all those
Interior Designers who specialise in
the many and varied fields of the pro'
fession and to work as a body to pro'
mote and effect a better standard of
interior design.
“As, every day, Australians are be'
coming more aware of their environ'

Mech.E., P.P. Inst. Struct. E.,
A.M.1.E.E.. P.P.1.H.V.E., F.C.
G.1.E., and F. N. Spon, L.T.D.
Strand, London. 232 pp. illustrated.
30/' net.
This volume is a complete survey
of the materials, properties and uses
of Reinforced Concrete, and describes
the most up'to'date methods of de'
sign, construction, and applications in
the fields of civil and structural em
gineering.
The book is particularly noteworthy
for the balance which the author has
achieved between fundamental theory,
and specific design data.
Mr. Faber is a leading British con'
suiting engineer, and he is a member
of the firm of Oscar Faber and Part'
ners, London. He is chairman of the
Code of Practice Committee on Rein'
forced Concrete, and he is also con'
suiting engineer to the rebuilding of
the Bank of England and the House
of Commons.
Striking features of the book are
the numerous tables of general and
design data, in many cases originally
compiled by Mr. Faber for his per'
sonal use and published for the first
time.
The 17 chapters cover all aspects of
reinforced concrete construction, and
the book will prove indispensable to
civil and structural engineers, archi'
tects and surveyors, local government
officials, consulting engineers, and
students in universities and technical
colleges, both in Britain and abroad.

New Sawmill
For Tumut
Part of Development Plan.
A new sawmill to be erected at
Tumut, in southern N.S.W., is ex'
pected to commence operations before
the end of the year.
The right to install the new plant
and to purchase about six million sup-
er feet a year of pine logs from
nearby State plantations has been
granted to the Monterey Pine Co. Pty.
Ltd.
The company was selected from six
applicants after exhaustive examina'
tion of the qualifications of each, the
Minister for Conservation, Mr. A. G.
Enticknap, announced recently.
The N.S.W. Foresty Commission
has laid down stringent specifications
for the mill to ensure the proper pre'
paration of the timber for the market,
and has also imposed conditions cov-
ering markets.
Sawmilling Centre.
The Minister said that with deveh
opments now planned, Tumut will
eventually become one of the largest
sawmilling centres in N.S.W.
Local markets, such as the Tumut
and Riverina regions will have first
call on the output from the new mill.
The timber from the mill would hiv
prove the supply of quality cases for
the Tumut, Batlow, and Murrumbid'
gee areas, and would improve supplies
of flooring and weatherboards in the
district, the Minister added.
The Modern Flat
Roof House
Will Not Stand The Test of Time.
“I don’t believe today’s ultra-mod'
ern trend in small home building will
stand the test of time!”
This forthright statement comes
from Mr. G. Burridge Leith, who has
just retired from the position of
chief architect and valuer of the State
Savings Bank of Victoria after 3 3
years’ service.
Mr. Leith said he realised that a lot
of people would regard him as “a
conservative old fogie” because of his
views on the best type of architecture
for the small home occupier, but
since the end of World War I, when
he started in his Savings Bank post,
he had built “a lot of houses.”
Mr. Leith said he agreed that mod'
ern small house architecture had many
good points. “But,” he added, “lots
on these flat roofs and things are not
suitable for our climate.”

Sydney County Council Statistics
FINANCIAL AND ENGINEERING FACTS AND FIGURES.
The Sydney County Council’s 17'
page publication “Statistics—Financial
and Engineering,” for the year ended
December 31, 1952, contains many in-
teresting facts and figures.
Few realise that the length of pub'
lie thoroughfares supplied with elec'
tricity by the Council for industrial,
commercial and residential users at
December 31 was 1855 miles. The
total number of street lamps was
31,915, and used a total load of 4891
kilowatts.
At the end of 1952 there was a
total of 1183 of all types of A.C.
substations and distribution centres in
use, while during the year 32 suburb'
an type and 16 city type distribution
centres were commissioned. The tot'
al rating of distribution transformers
installed was increased by 37,480
kVA.
City Distribution.
At the end of the year four D.C.
substations were used to maintain
supply. The maximum loading on
the D.C. system was 7600 kilowatts,
a reduction of 3000 kilowatts compar'
ed with the 1951 maximum loading.
The number of substations in ser'
vice in the city A.C. distribution sys-
tern was 93. The maximum loading
on the system was 43,056 kVA, rep'
resenting an increase of 6156 kVA
on 1951.
(On January 1, 1952, the Elec'
tricity Commission of N.S.W. took
over the assets, debts and liabilities of
the Sydney County Council relating
to the generation of electricity and
the supply of electricity in bulk.)
The total number of customers con'
nected at December 31, 1952, was
315,416, comprising residential
(276,082), commercial (30,124), high
voltage (58), low voltage (454),
factory (8698).
Sales of electricity for the 12
months ended December 31, 1952,
totalled £13,352,630, while purchases
of electricity totalled £8,477,546.
Distribution cost £1,218,674, mis'
cellaneous operating absorbed
£729,602, and administrative costs
amounted to £595,236.
A surplus of £41,125 was trans-
ferred to the Revenue Appropriation
Account.
Assets as at December 21, 1952,
were valued at £25,722,693.
The S.C.C. is liable for repayment
of loans amounting to £15,314,159 in
connection with that part of the
Electricity Undertaking which came
under control of the Electricity Com'
mission on January 1, 1952.
Revenue.
Income from sales of electricity
were: Residential (£4,292,350).
commercial (£2,367,522), industrial
(£6,351,662), public lighting
(£341,096). Total sundry income was
£469,767, a total of £13,822,397, and
the average price per kilowatt hour
sold was 2.910 pence.
Expenditure.
Sales development accounted for
£78,433, and the emergency service
to customers cost £71,099. Total
expenditure amounted in all to
£13,781,272, which worked out on
the average cost of 2.901 pence per

Russian Skyscraper
Architecture
Part of New Five-Year Plan.
When the Soviet Government, in
1935, set in motion its first five-year
plan for the reconstruction of Mos-
cow into a modern city, it hardly
foresaw the difficulties of the project.
The work involved the demolition
of many worthless buildings and an
enormous amount of new reconstruc-
tion, without impairing the historic
old city.
This old city and some of its main
streets radiated, in a general way, from
the centre, the Kremlin, and the Red
Square.
These streets were connected by a
vast network of intersecting streets in
a random pattern, and a jumble of
twisting lanes and crooked alleys.
Dilapidated houses and shops were
crowded in among cathedrals and
other fine structures.
The advent of World War 11. con-
siderably hampered reconstruction.
and, although a new five-year plan,
1946-50, made some improvements,
Moscow remains largely a city of
slums, beset by an acute housing
shortage which has forced four or
five people to share one room for liv-
ing quarters.
As in old Moscow, the Kremlin
is still the centre of the new and the
city has been re-organised into ten
boroughs, most of which are wedge-
shaped, radiating from the Kremlin
or Red Square.
Thousands of worn-out buildings,
squalid tenements and slum dwellings

thus made available, imposing new
buildings, such as the one illustrated,
are rising, to contrast with the weird

domes of Moscow’s churches, and the
conspicuous Oriental features of other

nite variety of Government offices.

SOVIET SKYSCRAPER.
This Soviet skyscraper, 20 storeys high,
has been newly erected in Moscow. Its
appearance suggests that the Russians
have not emancipated themselves from
the traditional ornamentation of U.S.S.R.
architecture, the building being cluster-

bronze statues.
UNUSUAL CANOPY.
This rather unusual canopy adorns the
entrance to the caretaker's house at

The Amazing Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright
NEW SKYSCRAPER ON “THE PRAIRIE.”
The skyscraper that 83'year'old vet'
eran American architect and world
leader in architectural thought—Frank
Lloyd Wright, has been planning and
replanning for nearly a generation is
at last to be built, not in New York
or Chicago, but in a little prairie
town called Bartlesville, Oklahoma,
which in 1950 had a population of
but 20,000. It is 186 ft. high, contain'
ing 18 storeys and the area of each
floor is but 1900 sq. ft.
It embodies many new ideas not the
least of which is that it combines bus'
iness offices and residential dwellings
on the same floors. Structurally it is
of considerable interest —as Wright’s
buildings always are —and the tower
is carried literally from the inside out,
the bearing elements being four sep-
arate hollow concrete fins each 18ft.
long set like a cross near the centre,
thus the entire floor system can be
considered as cantilevers.
At first sight such a tower might
seem an anchronism in an age that
worships such flat surface buildings as
Lever House and U.N.O. Headquart'
ers. But this ornament, which is in'
herent in the structure itself, is stud'
ied, deliberate and defiant. “Is this
then,” says the “Architectural For'
um,” “that devotes a special issue
to the new structure, the last skyscrap'
er of another age? Or does it mark
a new swing of the pendulum which
through all ages has alternated be'
tween the wealth of ornamentation and
the elegance of simplicity?”
Confidence Is
Infectious
A little prairie town in Oklahoma,
by the name of Bartlesville, is about
to make building history. It has a
population of 20,000 yet a skyscraper
of eighteen storeys is to be erect'
ed there. This in itself is news
but the fact that it is to be an out'
standing structure designed by that
83'year'old controversial architecural
genius, Frank Lloyd Wright, gives
added emphasis to this announcement.
It is not being erected by a crank
but by a commercial organisation, H.
C. Price & Co., who see in it a good
business proposition; and this is
taking place in a small American
country town about the sise of
Wagga, Goulburn, Lismore, or
Orange.
In comparison we have the proud
city of Sydney with a population of
almost two million which hasn’t seen
a new major city building for some
fourteen years, though one co'opera'
tive unit is struggling along at the
moment. Why is this?
Rent control and high building costs
are the two obvious rejoinders and
very potent arguments they are and
very effective deterrents to building
investment they have proved to be.
But surely the time has now arrived
to look ahead and not backward; to
replace excuses why not, for reasons
why. Sydney and Australia must de'
velop and its capital cities must keep
pace and provide the accommodation
to house its commercial and adminis'
trative centres.
The picture is indeed very differ'
ent to twelve months ago. The
budget has given some small re-
lief in the taxation sphere to both
the company and the individual, the
cost structure of the country has defh
nitely firmed, and the elimination of
the quarterly basic wage suspense
must all be reflected in greater stabih
ity and increased confidence.
The Building Industry is today back
on an even keel and “cost plus’’ and
“rise and fall” are being relegated to
the special cases where they belong,
and the firm competitive tender has
returned along with its brethren con'
fidence and stability.
Many large organisations who had
shelved important projects are again
giving them serious consideration and
those who have called tenders are find'
ing that prices are considerably better
than those obtained twelve months
ago, so now is the time to build. If
the office'hungry city and the efficient
building organisations get together
promptly, cranes should soon begin
sprouting again on the skyline of our
Sydney. And what a pretty sight that
is!

No synthetic material has yet been
produced that can actually take the
place of real marble. Few realise that
some of the most beautiful and colour'
ful marbles are quarried in N.S.W.
and in some of Sydney’s most impres'
sive buildings Australian marble graces
their mighty foyers.
Frameweld Reinforcement for Concrete
PREFABRICATED WELDED REINFORCEMENT.
For many years engineers and de-
signers of reinforced concrete struc-
tures have seldom been able to ensure
that the final position of the reinforce'
ment would be exactly as planned, due
to the fact that loose bars or bars tied
together with binding wire are very
liable to displacement before and
during the pouring of concrete. Fur-
thermore, it is difficult, if not impos'
sible, to check the position of every
bar in a complicated system of rein-
forcement which has been fixed by
workmen at site by the wiring method.
It was with the desire to eliminate
or minimise the disadvantages that
the Frameweld System of prefabricated
welded reinforcement was evolved.
With Frameweld units there is no
fear of displacement. Checking at
site becomes unnecessary as the units
are accurately fabricated by electric
welding in steel jigs from the drawings
provided and the designer can rely
on the assumptions in his calculations
being faithfully reproduced on the
site. The position of all reinforce'
ment can be checked with the detail
drawings before the units leave the
shops. Furthermore, the lengthy,
laborious and expensive method of
’wiring up’ at site with binding wire is
completely eliminated and the building
contractor is relieved of all respom
sibility for the correct position of
reinforcement.
Frameweld units are designed for
erection at the construction site be'
fore erection of the formwork, and
they form a self'supporting structural
frame. All problems of level and
position of steel are worked out in
the drawing office and the units fit
into their predetermined position sirm
ply and quickly. In practice, the
formwork may be positioned from the
reinforcement frames after they have
been plumbed and levelled. In this
manner the precision of structural
steelwork construction is combined
with the advantages of reinforced con'
crete construction.
The Frameweld System is patented
by T. C. Jones & Co. Ltd.. 9L95
Wood Lane, London, W. 2. An in'
structive brochure sets out complete
details of tests conducted by the De'
partment of Scientific and Industrial

Permanent Home of the United Nations
In New York, N.Y., U.S.A.
With the opening of the new
General Assembly building, the main
structures of the United Nations Per-
manent Headquarters in Manhattan
stand completed—the product of an
international committee of architects
who have worked since 1947 under
the direction of U.S. architect Wallace
K. Harrison.
First building finished was the 39-
storey Secretariat, a glass-and-marble
shaft rising high on New York’s East
River skyline. Next came the low,
rectangular Conference building with
its three Council Chambers outfitted
by the Scandinavian countries. Final-
ly, the sloping, domed Assembly—
focal point of the eighteen-acre U.N.
site—has been completed.
The Assembly houses a public con-
course for exhibits and displays a
public lounge, a small meditation room
for the use of delegates and conference
and committee rooms. Dominating
all is the huge auditorium, with 750
seats for delegates, 270 seats for ob-
servers, 234 Press seats, and 800 for
the public. Total, 2054 seats.
The ten-man committee of architects
included G. A. Soilleux, of Australia,
who was at one time a partner of
Vivien Taylor in Melbourne, the noted
specialist in theatre architecture and
acoustics: Gaston Brunfaut. of Bel-
gium; Oscar Neimeyer, of Brazil;
Ernest Cormier, of Canada; Ssu-
ch’ong, of China: Le Corbusier, of
France; Sven Markelius ,of Sweden;
N. D. Bassor, of the Soviet Union;
Howard Robertson, of the United
States; and Villamoi, of Uruguay.
WORLD BENEFACTORS.
America is unquestionably shoulder-
ing the world’s problems in her efforts
to establish peace. ( We hope at the
end of it all the world will treat her
better than some of the British bene-
ficiaries have treated that country —
Persia, Egypt, and others. England
has brought engineering science into
many countries over which she ad-
ministered or had dealings, and has
established schools, churches, water
conservation, sewerage works, roads,
bridges, railways, road culverts, elec-
tricity, gas works, etc.
Some of the dependancies on Britain
are still being graciously and regular-
ly looked after.
At the present time, the British
Empire’s Leprosy Relief covers Gold
Coast, Kenya, Malaya, Nigeria, Nyasa-
land, Sudan, Tanganyika, Uganda,
Zanzibar, to mention a few.
These little considerations are like-
ly to be forgotten unless we remind
people from time to time that Britain’s
influence over the world embraces
everything from structural develop-
ment, schooling, medical science and
religion.

a counter point with the tall, slender Secretariat (right). The
roof of the new structure flares up to 75 feet at the north end; the
depressed dome rising from it is directly over the assembly room.
One end of the new structure is a huge, recessed window; the
other is entirely of translucent glass set between marble columns.
The side walls, of marble and limestone, disdain straight lines—
they curve inward. Even the roof is concave. Visitors enter the
building at the north end; the delegates' entrance is toward the
south, marked by a canopy of marble (left). In the courtyard is a
fountain given by the school children of the United States. Black
pebbles that combine with white to make "wavies" in its pool were
gathered by the women and children of the Island of Rhodes and
are the gift of the Government of Greece.
(Centre) Candidates for United Nations Field Service are given
an intensive three-month training course which, to date, has gradu-

AN ENDLESS TASK.
Five million books covering more
than 60 miles of shelves are housed
at the British Musuem Library, Lon-
don. A copy of nearly every book
ever published is to be found there.
For 22 years, week in, week out,
eight scholars have been steadily at
w'ork cataloguing this colossal library.
They recently reached the D’s., which
means that at the present rate of pro-
gress their vast job will not be com'
pleted until the year 2036.
But by then, it is computed, the
early volumes of the catalogue will
be a century out of date. So once
more a team of scholars will have to
undertake the cataloguing. It’s really
a task that never ends.

Wall and Ceramic Finish in One.
A comprehensive catalogue in colour
of the new Wunderlich ceramic pro'

Blocks,” has just been received.
Originally developed and widely
used throughout U.S.A. as an interior
and exterior modular structural build'

vantage that it is “A Wall and Cera'
mic Finish in One,” for the ceramic
glazed surface is available in a variety
of plain and mottled finishes, that are
“colour engineered” to meet today’s
requirements both in the commercial
and industrial building fields.
Another feature is that the blocks
are made either double or single fac'
ed; the former permit the erection
of a partition wall that is complete
in itself, thus saving time and labour
and obviating delays, for only one
trade is involved. The single faced
blocks find use as the exterior or in'
terior skin of cavity walls.
Ceramic Glazed Structural Blocks
ensure bright maintenance free walls
and are recommended for use not only
on new buildings but in the alteration
of existing buildings.

To make my own career begin.
To serve the world in my own way.
To gain in wisdom, day by day,
With hope and zest to climb, to rise,

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust.-N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia
held at the G.U.O.O.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday,
3rd September, 1953, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. G. C. T. Brown,
and eighty-seven members and visitors
were present. The President cordially
welcomed the many visitors, particular-
ly the ladies in the audience.
Minutes.
Minutes of General Meeting held
on the 6th August. 195 3, were taken
as read and confirmed.
Report from Council.
The President reported that Mr. J.
B. Keenan, of 3 Wentworth Street,
Dover Heights, had been admitted as
an Associate member, and that the
resignation had been received of Mr.
G. D. Coutts. The President also
reported that Council had accepted
with regret Mr. H. D. Ritchie’s resig-
nation from Council. .
Subject for the Evening.
The subject “Light 6? Cosmetics”
was introduced by Mr. E. L. Freedman
with the assistance of a film, “The
Nature of Colour,” loaned by the
Visual Education Unit of the Sydney
Technical College. Demonstrations of
correct and incorrect make-up were
then given by Misses Jean Edgar and
Pat Hart. Two light sources, one
using daylight fluorescent tubes and
the other incandescent filament lamps,
were used to show that the correct
make-up appeared satisfactory under
widely different lighting conditions,
while the incorrect make-up appeared
satisfactory only under the particular
light source used during the applica-
tion.
At the conclusion of the demon-
stration, Mr. G. C. T. Brown present-
ed Miss Edgar and Miss Hart with a
token of appreciation from the Society
and remarked that for him the even-
ing had given an entirely new sig-
nificance to Pan-cake Day.
Vote of Thanks.
In moving the vote of thanks, Mr.
L. Hyatt said that he had always
wanted to belong to a learned society,
and on joining the I.E.S. he had be-
lieved his ambition to be realised.
After attending this enjoyable and at
times hilarious evening, however, he
now had grave doubts about the use
of the word “learned.” Despite the
hilarity, Mr. Hyatt continued, we have
been clearly shown the importance of
sympathetic and suitable lighting for
social occasions. As we have seen,
under one light source a lady can ap-
pear most attractive, whereas under
another her appearance simulates an
overdose of sunshine.
Quite apart from this lesson, Mr.
Hyatt said, all members should be
grateful to Mr. Freeman for arranging
an evening where, in the forcible
presence of their wives, they were per-
mitted to sit and stare at two very
attractive young ladies making-up their
faces.
Our gracious thanks go also to Miss
Edgar and Miss Hart for a most in-
teresting evening, which demonstrated
that the correct application of make'
up serves only to enhance an already
attractive appearance.
The vote of thanks was carried with
acclamation.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. McCourt said that he had been
asked to raise the question of make'up
for men. In some countries, male
clothing, particularly of the tweed
varietv, is being perfumed with “mas-
culine” scents, such as brier, heather,
etc. He recalled that not so many
centuries ago the male of the species
was addicted to scents, powder, peri'
wigs and perukes. Such things as
rosewater and almond water were in
common use, and, in fact, more atten-
toin was paid to cosmetics by men
than by women.
Miss Edgar said that many men to'
day were paying a great deal of atten'
tion to the care of their skin, and cos'
metic demonstrators were often asked
for advice. However, she hoped that
there would not be any great swing
back to the use of cosmetics by men
as the demonstrators were fully occu'
pied trying to cope with women’s
cosmetics.
In aswer to a question on the dif'
ference between normal and theatrical
make-up, Miss Edgar said that theat'
rical make-up was much heavier, and
was used to accentuate the features
This was necessary due to the high
intensity of stage lighting required to
reveal facial expression to the audience
at the back of the theatre.
Mr. Craker asked the nature of the
make'Up technique for film and tele'
vision as compared with stage make'
up.
Miss Edgar said that make'up for
films was not unlike an ordinary street
make'up, and in fact many present
improvements in women’s cosmetics
were directly due to the application of
techniques developed for film use.
Make-up for television, on the other
hand, was entirely different, as un'
natural colouring was necessary to cor'
rect colour distortion on the television
screen.
Mr. Zinader referred to the water-
proof qualities of the make-up used in
the demonstration and queried its
effect on the natural nrocess of per-
spiration.
LUMINOUS CEILING OF BAFFLED TYPE.
This is now a standard system of ceiling lighting in the U.S.A. manufacturers
supplying all the necessary materials. The fluorescent lamps are fixed to the struct-
ural ceiling and baffles are hung between them. In the foreground of this picture
two and a half lines of lighting tubes are shown bare without the baffles. This
system is particularly useful in rooms where the direction of vision is fixed, as in
a classroom. For the latter the baffles may be of acoustical tile as an alternative
to translucent plastic.

Miss Edgar replied that although
the make-up was waterproof it did not
seal the pores of the skin. The natu-
ral process of perspiration was there-
fore unaffected even under the heavy
stage make-up.
Mr. Knight asked if the splashing
of water on the face removed the
powder applied over the make-up.
Miss Edgar said that powder pro-
perly applied was pressed into the sur-
face of the make-up and held by it.
A small amount of powder might be
removed by the water, but most of
it would remain unaffected.
In answer to a question “Is there
really a kiss-proof lipstick?” Miss
Edgar said it depended on the amount
of effort that went into the kiss. Lip-
stick correctly applied was reasonably
indelible.
Mr. Palme said that he had observed
that some lipstick seems to run into
the crevices of the lips, particularly
at the corners ,and asked the reason
for this.
Miss Edgar said that this fault was
caused by incorrect application. When
correctly applied, the foundation make-
up is carried over the lips, filling the
crevices and forming a smooth base
for the lipstick.
LIGHT AND COSMETICS.
A Not Too Technical Introduction
to a Highly Technical Subject.
By E. L. FREEDMAN,
M.I.E.S. (Aust.).*
Women like to judge the quality
of light sources and of the lighting
installations in which these are em-
ployed by the effect which they have
on their own and on their sisters’
faces. If what they see in their mir'
rors pleases them, if the light is kind,
and soft, and flatters their complexions
—obviously, the lights must be good.
If the reflections of their faces appear
hard, and cold; if the light reveals
more than they might have liked to
see —the lights must be bad, obviously.
As Lighting Engineers, we take such
comment in our stride. We know that
light, and the effect it has on us,
should be judged by more accurate
standards than by a casual glimpse
into a woman’s mirror; and that it is
in “The Nature of Colour” 1 that only
those colours can become apparent to
our eyes which are contained in both:
in the radiated light and also in the
objects upon which the light falls.
We look at the incandescent lamp, 2
the light source of our homes. We
know that it is very different from the
natural light of the day; it flatters and
dulls greens and blues, and is grossly
overbearing on reds and orange. We
have to take our hats, and frocks and

stockings, to the window if we want
to know what they really look like.
But we look happy and healthy under
it, and it enhances and flatters the
colours and texture of our com-
plexions. We are used to it. We
like it.
How different the fluorescent lamp, 2
the light source of our offices, stores
and factories. It is quite similar to
daylight ;shows colours in their true
values, with little, if any, distortion.
It is very efficient. It permits of but
few shadows. It is practically glare-
free. It makes seeing easy and re-
duces eyestrain. But we are still very
suspicious of fluorescent lighting, par-
ticularly in our homes, where we pre-
fer to live in a world of make-believe
and illusion rather than face the cold
and hard facts of the hostile outside
world.
To-night, we shall enter this world
of illusion and make-believe through
another door; a door which we Light-
ing Engineers usually find locked and
heavily guarded against us. Two
charming girls, 3 Miss Jean Edgar and
Miss Pat Hart, will demonstrate to us
that every woman can and does look
beautiful, glamorous and attractive,
lovely and lovable ... as long as
she applies the right kind and colour
of beauty preparation to suit her own
particular type, her own particular
personality.
We Lighting Engineers will not be
hard to convince. Just because we
are engineers, we have not forgotten
how to interpret and understand, and
to appreciate and trust that which
comes to us through the five senses
with which nature has endowed us:
our senses to hear and to feel, to smell
and to taste, and above all to SEE.
We know that, between the dryness
of the technical fact and the full-
bloodedness of sensory experience, lie
many illusions, lie all those impon-
derable effects which are created
through that elusive medium of
STYLE, and are appreciated through
that equally elusive medium of
TASTE, which we had to create and
acquire, and work for and cultivate
until they became part of our entire
nature and manifest in the perfection
of our work.
Miss Jean Edgar will create before
us now a face; her own face, to suit
her own particular style k She will
work under the most adverse, the most
exacting lighting conditions; under the
strong and pitiless light of the artificial
day. But she knows, and so do we,
that if she can master the imitation
daylight of our fluorescent lamp, that
she will be able to make-up also in
the light of the morning sun with
confidence, and look her best through-
out the following day, evening and—
night. We, who now meet Jean
Edgar, have no doubt that she will
convincingly succeed.

than £1,500,000,000 in six years,
France will still live for a long time
in the shadow of electric power
shortage.
Production will remain so delicately
balanced that any untoward circum-
stance, such as a drought, might cause
the re-introduction of the rationing
that was lifted only in 1950, as pro-
duction caught up with demand.
Hydro-electric plants increased the
installed capacity by 78 per cent, since
1946 to 6600 MW, while thermal
plants increased by 117 per cent, to
5600 MW.
Promising as a future source of
power is atomic energy. France’s five-
year atomic energy programme, which
is just beginning to move, will re-
quire £5,000,000, but this will only
be the intial stage in this direction.
The industrial development—known
as the Monnet Plan —allocated capital
for power plant, in 1947, to be con-
structed where the energy supplied
would be to the greatest advantage
for the recovery of those key indus-
tries which were vital to the economy
of the country. This plan is now be-
ginning to pay dividends.
To distribute the increasing supply
of power to other industrial centres
the 225 kV transmission lines were
almost doubled, between 1946 and
1952, to 4035 miles and lower voltage
lines by corresponding distances.
Reports have been made of a pro-
ject to provide a power exchange, be-
tween Britain and France, by a cross-
channel submarine cable. Experts
figure that such a link would enable
an exchange of electric power that
would benefit both countries.
While this project is still in the ex-
perimental stage, and there are many
difficulties to be overcome, the ex-
perience gained by the “Pluto” cross-
channel petrol pipes of the war shows
that they are not insurmountable.

MAIN REGULATING
TRANSFORMERS.
For the Hydro-Electric Commission,
Tasmania, four main regulating trans-
formers are being built by the English
Electric Company Limited at their
Stafford Works in England. The
throughoutput of each transformer
will be 100,000 kVA at 110,000 volts,
and it is believed that these units will
be the largest regulating transformers
ever shipped to Australia.
Each transformer consists of two
parts, a series booster unit and a
potential unit provided with on-load
tap-changing equipment to boost and
buck the voltage from the outgoing
series terminals by plus 6% to minus
12% for Trevallyn and plus 12% to
minus 12% in the case of Tungatinah.
Each pair of regulating transformers
is suitable for operation in parallel
and for direct connection to busbars
where the maximum symmetrical short-
circuit level may reach 2500 MVA.,
this latter requirement necessitating
special design features.
The first transformer for Trevallyn
has been completed and will arrive at
Launceston, Tasmania, within the next
few weeks. The second unit will fol-
low shortly, and the remaining two
transformers are destined for the Tun-
gatinah Power Station.
The English Electric Company
Limited build more large high-voltage
transformers for Australia than any
other manufacturer and have obtained
major transformer contracts in America
for such locations as Folsom, Seattle
and the Chief Joseph Dam.
HYDRO—CANADA’S WORD
FOR POWER.
Unlike the United States, which
has by reason of its geographical lay'
out to depend largely on heat-power
for the greater part of its electricity
supply, Canada is favourably situated
and has an abundant water - power
potential.
Canada’s kWh output per head of
population is 25 per cent, ahead of
the United States and is behind only
British Columbia and Norway in the
figures of world electricity production.
It is estimated that even with its
great development, only 22 per cent,
of the nation’s known water power
resources so far have been tapped.
Up to the end of 1952, 14,300,000
horsepower of hydroelectric power
was operating, and this year 830,000
horsepower will be added. One and
a half million horsepower additional
will be operating by 1955.
Hydropower progress is in evidence
in every province of Canada and in

the hitherto unorganised territories of
the far north. While the possibilities
of heat power generation are being
developed where “hydro” is not im'
mediately available, the future use of
uranium reactors is also being kept in
view. Dr. C. J. McKenzie, President
of Atomic Energy in Canada, says :
“These must be for special purposes
and point sources of great heat energy
where the cos tof the energy will not
be of major importance.”

MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
Mr. ROBERT RICHARD,
CHUBBS AUSTRALIAN CO.
LTD.
The Chubb tradition, estab-
lished in England when Queen
Victoria put her imprimateur
of recognition upon the qual-
ity of Chubbs production in
1847 by appointing them as
her patent lock manufacturers,
has been handed down from
generation to generation; son
suceeding father after father,
over one hundred and thirty-
four years. Since the foun-
dation of this firm every kind
of encouragement has been
given to all relatives, execu-
tives and workmen alike who
could possibly contribute to
the scientific development of security as well as perfect craftsmanship. The pres-
ent Chairman of the world organisation is Mr, H. Emery Chubb, C.B.E.
The present house is still maintaining this legacy of quality and tradition,
which embraces the hallmark of Chubbs. So it is in Australia, where Robert
Richard, the 43-years-old Managing Director of Chubbs (Australian) Co. Ltd.,
who was born at Kogarah, perpetuates the locksmith practice, as well as the archi-
tectural metalwork his father before him brought to this firm. Robert Richard won
athletic fame at his school. He went into Chubbs in the workshop and has worked
his way up to the top. He served in the 4th Armoured Brigade in the Australian
Forces in World War 11. In 1946 he was appointed Director and in 1951 succeeded
the popular late Sid Langsworth as Managing Director, whose brother Chris. Langs-
worth, was Managing Director before him.
Hospital Works In
Newcastle
£83,500 Allocated.
The State Government has allocated
.£83,500 to complete new hospital
buildings in Newcastle district.
Announcing this recently, Mr.
Simpson, M.L.A., said representations
had been made to the Minister for
Health, Mr. O’Sullivan, for funds to
finish a new ward block, a new laun'
dry for the Royal Newcastle Hosph
tal, and for the nurses’ home at New
Lambton.
As a result of these representations
the Gov ernment has allocated
<£83,500 for these works in 1953'54.
This amount should be enough to
complete the buildings, Mr. O’Sullivan
said.

Old world grace is captured in the

adopted in a modern shoe store though
the simplicity of the lighting layout can-
not lighten the heavy ponderousness of
the bulky raking concrete beams sup-

The New Statler Centre in Los Angeles
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER.
Very few large modern hotels are
being built in the United States at
present. Statler Centre in Los
Angeles, the largest hotel project to
be constructed in America in more
than twenty years, therefore, made
particular impression in the whole
nation. Statler Centre, which occu-
pies an entire city block, is comprised
of a 1300-room hotel, an office build-
ing with 150,000 square feet, shops
and stores which utilise 75,000 square
feet, a 500-car underground garage,
and a semi-tropical garden-pool area
in the heart of the business district.
Architects were Holabird 6? Root &
Burgee, of Chicago, and William B.
Tabler, of Hotels Statler Company Inc.
Every Guest Room
Has Outside Exposure.
Every guest-room is air-conditioned,
with individual control. The guest
can regulate temperature to suit him-
self. Every guest-room has outside
exposure, there are no courts. Size
of the building plot made possible
construction of the building in five
great wings. Each wing has a sepa-
rate foundation, making possible earth-
quake-proof construction. Every guest-
room also has a television set and
radio, circulating ice water, servidor
service, etc.
Seventy per cent, of the guest-rooms
are of the studio type living-room
by day, bedroom at night.
Guests arriving by automobile need
not register in the main lobby if they
prefer not to —a sign that hotels learn-
ed something from their increasing
competition with motels on edge of
the highway. They can drive direct-
ly into the hotel garage, register at a
special desk, and go to their room
floors in an elevator. An attendant
parks the car.
Facilities of Statler Centre for con-
ventions, banquets and group business
are the largest west of Chicago. The
main ballroom accommodates 1230
persons. An adjacent large ballroom
can be opened into this room to in-
crease its capacity, if necessary.
The building houses a laundry
capable of taking care of the needs
of a city of 20,000, has an ice plant,
a carpenter shop, and many other
facilities. A motor stairway transports
guests from one entrance to the main
lobby, one storey above.
The kitchens in the new ,£11,000,000
Hotel Statler have been designed for
highest efficiency. The dining-rooms
have been built around the kitchens,
so that each kitchen opens directly
into the rooms it serves. Food and
raw materials come in one end of the
kitchen, progress through the various
steps in the preparation required, and
go out on the waiters’ trays at the
other end. The 3 kitchens are expan-
sive, they are brilliantly lighted by
fluorescent daylight strip fixtures and,
being done in white, are free from
shadows. Upwards of 15,000 meals a
day can be prepared in those three
kitchens.
Special Services
For Children.
One of the most popular features
of Hotel Statler guest service, from
the standpoint of parents ,is the special
attention given to children. In the
Cafe Rouge, the popular-priced res-
taurant, there is a Children’s Menu
featuring healthful dishes that appeal
to children, at reasonable prices. Each
child also receives, besides the menu,
a souvenir gift—a balloon or a package
of animal crackers.
The Hotel also provides a crib, at
parents’ request, when a small baby
is brought to the guest-room. When
parents wish it, the baby’s formula is
prepared exactly according to specifi-
cations by a hotel dietitian. A baby
sitter, selected from the Hotel’s staff,
is assigned at standard rates. This
enables the parents to visit friends or
see the sights of the city with the
knowledge that their child is properly
cared for.
Volume of both radio and television
speakers in guest-rooms is controlled
at two points: the electronic control

centre and in the guestroom itself.
Coaxial cables run through amplifiers
at each of the roof top antennae / to
boost the output from the normal
range of 3000 to 10,000 microvolts
to a high level of 750,000 microvolts.
The cable used is of special design to
eliminate leakage and interference.
There are special service corridors
for staff members. They don’t have
to haul luggage and supplies through
the guests’ parts of the hotel. The
ceilings of the guestrooms are not
high. But a virtue has been made
out of a necessity by putting in wide,
horizontal windows. The wider ex'
panse brings a sense of space into the
room.
Statler used a special light concrete
for use in the walls, thus allowing for
a lighter supporting framework and
smaller foundations.
Skilled Craftsmen Thrive in Mechanical Age
By MARY MOORE
(from “Craft Horizons,” U.S.A.)
Practising the old art of hand'
processing and fashioning wrought
iron in an out'of'the'way workshop,
skilled American artisans find a ready
market for their products and satisfac'
tion in their work.
Deserted for many years when the
modern machine age passed it by, the
small American village of Landgrove,
Vermont, where Samuel Ogden set up
the Rowen Forge, is now a thriving
community. Strangely enough. Land'
grove’s rebirth and slow but steady
growth in importance are due directly
to a family’s desire to live in the
country and to a man’s enthusiasm for
and faith in the old'fashioned way of
making things by hand.
The word “rowen,” the name
chosen for the forge, means “a second
growth; aftermath.” No one had
lived in this place for five years or
more.
Puddled iron( iron freed of most of
the carbon and other impurities),
which they use exclusively, is no
longer commercially available from
American mills ,and consequently few
people in the United States now use
it. Puddling, a hand process which
requires skilled workmen, is largely
responsible for the superior properties
of wrought iron for forge work. But
its production is tedious and time'
consuming and has been found un'
profitable for large masses of iron.
Mild steel (steel with low carbon con'
tent), made by the open hearth or
by the Bessemer process, is generally
used and worked with a great variety
of power tools. In this respect, and
in many others as fundamental, the
Rowen Forge is different.
The Rowen Forge uses neither mild
steel nor power tools beyond an irrre'
ducible minimum. All stock on the
racks is of true Norway iron, import'
ed from Sweden. Even though the
cost of the iron is approximately twice
that of mild steel, it is less susceptible
to rust than steel, it is more malleable,
more ductile, will take more twisting
and bending without breaking, and it
will forge'weld at higher temperatures
and more easily. In effect, it is more
durable and more easily worked into
fine and intricate designs, and it is
better suited for forge welding, which
is the only type of welding used.
A unique collection of tools were
gathered from old blacksmith shops
all over the countryside for forming
intricate shapes in hot iron. All iron
is punched unless the drill will do a
better job, and the power-grinder is
only used for sharpening tools.
The two Ogdens (father and son)
have turned out a surprising variety
of ironwork, including all kinds of
fireplace accessories, rigid or folding
firescreens, hobs, andirons, fire tools,
trammels, hooks, oven doors with
hinges and latches. Directly above
the workshop, in the display room,
which is used also for an office, can be
seen some examples of the various
kinds of lighting fixtures, including
chandeliers, table and standing lamps,
wall fixtures, post and entrance lamps.
Samuel Ogden has a collection of
books covering almost all phases and
periods of the iron worker's craft, but
it is the actual work itself—the ham'
mering of iron at the forge—and the
great intimacy he has with the ways
and needs of houses which determine
his design.
Samuel Ogden has proved that even
where mechanised processes are gene'
rally preferred there is need for and
appreciation of the “old'fashioned,”
hand'made products.

dress to the Reinforced Concrete As-
sociation, London, on the subject of
Translucent Concrete," illustrating his
address with a number of examples

struction is extensively used to excellent
advantage and affect. This particular

University.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
The Adelaide City Council has
passed plans for the largest multi'
storey block of flats ever contemplated
in the State. The building, to be
called Brougham House, will be of
ten storeys, with 70 flats, designed to
be sold as home units on a system
new to Adelaide but already popular
in Eastern States. The company back'
ing the flats has been registered in
Adelaide as Brougham House Ltd.,
with a capital of £415,960. Shares,
numbering seventy, will cover three
different types of flat, three'bedroom
at £6900, two'bedroom at £6400, and
bachelor flats at £3750.
The company expects to complete
the 100 ft. high building in the first
half of 1955. It will be surrounded
by gardens, and the larger flats will
command a view of the city and the
foothills. The site has a frontage of
423 ft. to Bagot Street and 87ft. to
Brougham Place and Kermode Street,
in one of the city’s choicest residem
tial districts.
Plans provide for eight flats to a
floor, with fireproof doors and garbage
disposal chutes on each floor. There
will be three sets of lifts, each serv'
ing a maximum of three flats on each
floor. Fifty garages will be provided,
and the building will include a dining
room. Living room size in a typical
three'bedroom flat will be 17ft. by
14ft., with a main bedroom 12ft. 6in.
square and a dining room. Messrs.
Armstrong and Orton, of Victoria,
are the architects.
Work is due to begin soon on the
preparation for one of the city’s
largest buildings. The Adelaide City
Council is calling tenders for clearing
the site of Flint 6? Sons’ building on
the corner of Bank and Hindley
Streets, later to be occupied in part
by the Savings Bank of South- Aus'
tralia with a multistorey building.
Clearing is over a site 40ft. wide to
Hindley Street, and extending 220 ft.
down Bank Street, and about half of
the site width will be taken up in the
widening of Bank Street.
The Adelaide engineering firm of
Forwood Down & Co. has secured the
latest contract on the world’s largest
single'unit sulphuric acid plant under
construction at Port Adelaide. The
contract, let at £20,000, is for supply'
ing steelwork for the flash roaster
house, which will be 170 ft. by 140 ft.
and 89ft. high. Simon Carves (Aus'
tralia) Pty. Ltd. are the main com
tractors, and the plant is being built
for Sulphuric Acid Ltd.
Perry Engineering Co. have a
£19,500 contract for fabricated steel'
work for a maintenance shop for
caterpillar tractors at Enfield for Ade'
laide Motors Ltd. The flooring work
on the 45,000 sq. ft. building has
already been done by Marshall
Brougham, and tenders for the main
building will be called soon.
Wood, Bagot, Laybourne Smith 6?
Irwin are the architects.
Tenders are being called by F.
Kenneth Milne for another motor in-
dustry job, the erection of a motor
showroom and service depot in Gilles
Street, City, for Doug Burns 6? Sons.
A £12,000 contract for a single'Storey
brick office building in Flinders Street,
designed by the same architect, for
British Insulated Callenders Cables
Ltd., has been let to J. Jenkins 6? Son.
The contract is for the building only,
and tenders for fitting will be called
separately.
Foundation work on two country
cold stores, at Ashton and Lenswood,
is well advanced, and tenders have
been accepted for later phases of the
construction. Tenders accepted are
for Ashton: main trades, Grove 6?
Sons; structural steelwork, Collins 6?
Son; refrigeration plant, White Em
gineering; and for Lenswood: main
trades, Grove 6? Sons; structural steel'
work, Todd 6? Sons; insulation, New'j
ton Brooks; refrigeration plant, White,

store, which will be the largest under
one roof in South Australian country
districts, is estimated at £34,000, and
THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE.
There has always been a strong Oriental influence in San Francisco and California
and though this was naturally rather in eclipse during the war it is again asserting
itself if one is to judge from these illustrations showing recent large residences
built on the Eastern coast of America. The traditional Japanese cherry blossom
design forms the decorative background for the spacious living room seen in the
top left and this true to type is given a folding screen effect while a large Japanese
porcelain figure is in the foreground. Similar figures—rather weird to western eyes
—hold lamps with shades like a deep bamboo screen woven and matted together,
on either side of the dressing table in the bottom left. An Eastern feeling Is
also engendered in the clustered glass candelabra placed on one side over the
fireplace, and in the curtain pelmet (bottom right). The top right has no Eastern
—or any other particular character —and its most interesting feature is the large
suspended ceiling canopy over the bed that conceals the inclined lighting. The
head of the bed, upholstered to match the counterpane, is placed in front of a
huge black marble setting.

AMERICA'S VERMONT MARBLE
WHERE MANY QUARRYMEN WORK UNDERGROUND.
One hundred rail carloads of the
stone, called Vermont Pearl, were used
in the building of the United Nations
Secretariat in New York City. It is
white with bluish green veining.
This marble was discovered and the
first quarry was opened in 1785. Geol-

back millions of years, when an arm of
the sea reached up into Vermont. Over
the centuries sea life deposited lime-
stone to depths of a mile in the area.
During later folding of the earth's sur-
face and emergence of the land mass
from the sea, the limestone was meta-
morphosed or crystallized by heat and
pressure to form marble.
Many Vermont marble quarries, how-
ever, are small at the top, balloon out
below the surface, and the quarrymen
work underground.
Granite is another building stone
quarried In the north-eastern region of
the United States.
Mechanical methods are used for
handling. Both marble and granite are
quarried and processed in about the
same way. Rough-cut blocks of marble
and granite are removed by large cranes
loaded on to flatcars and transported to
nearby processing sheds. There they
are cut to size by diamond-toothed gang
saws that can cut a block into six slabs
in one operation. Finishing, sculpture,
and polishing are the final steps.
The Arlington Memorial Bridge across
the Potomac River at Washington, D.C.,
is made principally of granite, the stone
that is used in structures where great
strength is required. The U.S. Supreme
Court Building, the New York Public
Library, and the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier are all made of marble.
THE THOMAS JEFFERSON MEMORIAL
The exterior and dome of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington. D.C., are
made from Vermont marble, Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence,
was third president of the United States. Marble blocks also form the exterior
of the monument to George Washington (background), first President. About
half the Washington Monument's interior backing is granite.

WORLD WIDE CONSTRUCTION
THE UNIQUE ALCOA BUILDING.
The Aluminium Tower in Pitts-
burgh’s Golden Triangle is now ap-
proaching completion, and will with-
out doubt become another symbol of
modern U.S.A. This building has
provided ample scope for experiment-
ation in new ideas of design and ma-
terial and engineers engaged on the
project have taken fullest advantage
of their opportunity.
When the influential Aluminium
Company of America (A.L.C.0.A.)
planned this building it aimed at
bringing its numerous offices in Pitts-
burgh under one roof, and at the
same time exploiting to the utmost
the uses of aluminium for construc-
tion purposes.
The result is that aluminium has
been used in a new way in building,
and to secure new ends. The com-
pleted building is claimed to be the
lightest weight building for its size
yet erected, and the many years of
investigation and research have been
well rewarded.
Fire-Proof Structural Frame.
Technically, the aluminium is bas-
ed on a structural steel frame, which
is fire-proofed with foam concrete. In
the mechanical core areas foam con-
crete has an additional use as floor
slabs. Most of the flooring is compos-
ed of -celluar steel panels, with plastic
tile or concrete fill surfacing. Perlite
plaster inserted.
The exterior walls are thin and
consist of stamped aluminium panels
bolted to the angles on the spandrel
beams. Reinforcement is given by
4 in. of perlite concrete sprayed on
to the slotted aluminium lath and re-
inforcing bars. Aluminium radiant
heating and cooling panels are built
into the ceilings, to combine heating
in the winter with a high degree of
summer coding. The ventilation sys-
tem is composed of aluminium ducts
attached to the ceiling diffusers. Other
uses of aluminium include the electric
wiring conduit, sector busses, and
much of the piping in the building.
The building is 30 storeys high,
with two basements and a penthouse.
On each floor a small utility core has
been built, comprising a fan room
with electrical equipment, wash
rooms, and fire stairs. The windows
are double-glazed with heat resisting
exterior panes. They can be reversed
for cleaning, and are sealed round
the edges with pneumatic synthetic
rubber tubes.
£50,000 Aluminium Offices.
The county of Merioneth (Wales)
recently erected new county offices
and municipal chambers largely of
“Bristol” aluminium construction.
The dominant feature of the
buildings is a two-storey central block
in local and traditional stone, on eith-
er side of which are single-storey alu-
minium wings with stone gables. Be-
hind is a further group of aluminium-
built offices, linked to the central
block by a stone corridor. The alu-
minium structures are finished in a
shade of gunmetal grey which har-
monises with the stone and the sur-
rounding landscape.
The stone-built central building
comprises the main entrance foyer, en-
quiry room and ground floor cloak-
room. The main committee room
and waiting room is on the first floor.
In the aluminium wing on the left
of the main building is the council
chamber, clerk’s department, and edu-
cation block at the rear. Erection
of a finance block will eventually give
the complete scheme the shape of an
“H”. A feature of the council cham-
ber is that the floor is sunk to allow
for tiered seating, and to lend an im-
pression of height and dignity to the
room.
The work on the building site
commenced in May, 1951, and the
total cost of roads, fencing, buildings,
and furniture was approximately
£50,000.
Hungarian Stadium Will
Be Europe’s Largest.
In Budapest Hungary, construction
is now proceeding on the biggest and
most modern sports stadium in Cen-
tral Europe. The structure, which is
due to be finished early next year, is a
major project under Hungary s cur-
rent five-year plan.
Actual building is well up to sched-
ule and a completed portion of the
stadium with accommodation for
80.000 people, will be opened this
month.
Elliptical in shape, the stadium
measures 520 yards from the entrance
to the border of the opposite stand
and 720 yards across the long diam-
eter.
Tall pylons designed to resemble
towers or battlements give the build-
ing the appearance of a castle and
have added a new feature to the sky-
line from the Eastern Railway Station
to the famous Hungarian Boulevarde.
There are 38 of these supporting
columns around the stadium and each
has a staircase leading to the stands.
Staircases are built from artificial stone
bars, with Gothic patterns. A com-

pact tower of the stadium is an 11-
storey athlete’s hotel, which rises in
the main front. It has a central air-
conditioning system, and a special in-
stallation to eliminate dampness. The
furnace room, machinery room and
main switchboard for illuminating
evening sports, are all housed in the
basement of the hotel. It has dress-
ing room accommodation for over
500 athletes, and a hall in the hotel
for receptions and lectures to seat
200 people.
Open Stands,
Stands in the stadium are complete-
ly open to the air, but a covered
promenade extending round the
ground floor beneath the ferro-con-
crete structure will shelter 80,000 in
inclement weather. This promenade
circle connects all the pylons and ends
in front of the two entrance gates
at the central building. Ambulance
stations will be located in the pylons,
and two speed-lifts will be installed.
Construction enables spectators to ap-
proach their seats by facing the play-
ing grounds, and the number of seats
in each sectional row has been kept
to 40.
Near the stadium the new Budapest
underground terminus is being built,
to give ready access for patrons.
Some 80% of the entire building of
the stadium consists of assembling pre-
fabricated elements and there is a
high degree of mechanisation
throughout the whole huge project.
The completed stadium will be large
enough to hold an Olympiad.
It is a great pity that Melbourne
didn’t take a leaf out of Budapest’s
book, and get busy long ago with
the erection of its own Olympic sta-
dium.
(Budapest (population 1,164.963)
consists of two cities on opposite sides
of the Danube. Melbourne (popula-
tion 1 326,400) consists of one city
on one side of the Yarra, with resi-
dential sections on the other, but with
endless factional fights.)
QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
Of the 720 building permits issued
by the Brisbane City Council during
August, the far greater majority were,
of course, for dwellings. Though the
average cost still ranges about £2OOO
each, there are variations in respect
of one new home to cost £20,200,
another £7177, one at £6OOO and 33 at
from £3OOO to £5OOO.
New factory buildings are to be
built costing £12,000, £6500, £15,000,
respectively, and amenities blocks cost-
ing £3500 and £7BOO each. A work-
shop will cost £16,000 ,a service station
£9OOO, shops (in some cases with
dwellings attached) £4500, £BOOO
(three), £4OOO, £4500. Additions to
St. Patrick’s Church buildings in
“The Valley” will cost £46,732, and
a malt-crushing house for a brewery
will entail the expenditure of £18,200.
A few flat buildings are amongst the
permits.
Timber merchants report a good
demand well up to the supplies avail-
able. though manufacturers of fibrous
plaster walls and ceilings report that
prices are now competitive.
The experiment of importing
foreign materials and foreigners
French, Dutch and Italian to erect
prefabricated houses has been most
unhappy, resulting in groups of un-
completed houses being left to the
Housing Commission to finish. Large
sums of monev are owing to work-
men and suppliers of materials, and it
is questionable whether the provisions
of the Contractors and Workmen’s
Lien Act, which provides protection
to workmen for wages, and where the
wage-earner (then called a sub - con-
tractor) supplies material also, can
produce any financial relief.
This applies to the extent of any
contract moneys unexpended in the
construction of the building. What-
ever happens, large monetary losses
seem to be inescapable.
Among the numerous instances of
building, painting, and face-cleaning,
in time for the Royal visit in six
months’ time, is the cleaning of the
outside walls of Brisbane’s eighty-
years-old General Post Office at a cost
of £2724. This called for the thorough
washing-down of all stonework, with
clean water, vigorously applied with
coarse scrubbing brush, and where
stains do not respond to scrubbing,
carborundum and sand had to be
used.
All defective pointing had to be
raked out and repointed. Waterproof-
ing and preserving liquids had to be
applied to tops of cornice moulds,
arch, and cap moulds.
Other work included:—Re-facing,
porphyry foundation walls; re-work
stone plinth of arcade and replace-
ment of a number of defective stones.
The effect is pleasing, and in this
age of bitumen roadways lessening
the dust nuisance of the past, the
cleaner face should be maintained for
a long time. The previous operation
was fifty years ago, when the atmos-
pheric contamination with acids and
chemicals was much less prevalent
than it is to-day.
It is anticipated that the clamour
for a new G.P.0., which on several
occasions in the last thirty years has
reached the stage of “plans (architec-
tural) and promises” (political), is
now stifled, to the peace and content-
ment of lovers of good architecture,
devoid of all-too-frequent modern
garishness. In any other surround-
ings but the main city street, the
smouldering local “National Trust”
would rise up to protect this present-
able building with historic associations.
Though it is only a two-storeyed struc-
ture, the services—beyond congestion
at the stamp sales counters —appear to
be adequately catered for, and such
additional space as is required for ad-
ministrative purposes exists behind the
post office and through to Elizabeth
Street, where building is to start soon.
In 1872, John Petrie built this
Grecian edifice for £7450, using sand-
stone from his quarry at Albion
Heights, about three miles distant, and
porphyry from a much handier dis-
tance. Haulage by drays, the then
normal means, was slow and arduous
over poor metal roads. By 1879,
building prices had advanced some-
what, as is instanced by the fact that
E. Telegraph office wing adjoining
cost £19,000 to build. Both of these
prices are historically interesting when
compared with present-day building
costs.
CORK-ALUMINIUM ROOFING.
This photo shows a remarkable roof that was erected for the Riverside Restaurant
in the Festival of Britain. In an undulating slope it comprised a two-inch layer of
cork in between two sheets of 20 gauge aluminium. The large corrugations were
14 ft. long and two feet high. Alphamin Ltd. developed the "sandwich" in sheets
8 ft. x 4 ft.

Beginning with the pioneer Tom
Petrie, this family has left its mark
on Brisbane’s building construction
that many would like to be indelible.
It bids to remain so in the case of the
Customs House, built in 1892, an
architectural gem of admitted excel'
lence and adequacy for the needs of
the people at Petrie’s Bight, Brisbane.
Some internal renovations and altera'
tion of entrance were made in 1950.
Several generations of that family
have come and gone before the arrival
of the present John Robert Petrie,
who conducts the business, dating
back to 1840, of monumental sculptor,

his late grandfather.
Somerset Dam.
The concreting of this great struc'
ture —begun in 1937 to impound a
lake as a flood preventive and as water
supply to the City of Brisbane, eighty
miles distant from the Stanley River,
which empties into the Brisbane River
—has been finished. Its delayed com'
pletion during the war years was due
to the need of its essential plant to
build the dry dock on the Brisbane
River. After the war, the plant was
returned to Somerset so that the wall
could be carried to its full height.
The Resident Engineer (Mr. R.
Gipps), a scion of a one'time Cover'
nor of N.S.W., reports that 269,000
yards of concrete had been used in
the dam. which took 50,000 tons of
cement, 250,000 yards of stone,
100,000 yards of sand. Some quantity
of machinery on order overseas, which
would be installed over a period of
the next two or three years, includes
powerhouse machinery, coaster gate,
and operational winches.
The cost will reach £3,250,000, in'
eluding interest on the loan for the
project unavoidably protracted by the
war years. The area of the Somerset
Dam, between Kilcoy and Esk, is one
of much beauty naturally, in its pine'
clad mountains, and artificially, in a
magnificent sheet of water dotted with
small islands evolved from small hills,
and rich in anglers’ estimation.

Fire Tests of Steel Columns Encased with
Gypsum Lath and Plaster
U.S. BUREAU OF STANDARDS TESTS.
This report, one of a series issued
by the National Bureau of Standards
on building materials and structures,
presents the results of fire tests of steel
building columns protected by gypsum
lath and gypsum plaster, the latter in-
corporating three different aggregates.
The fire-endurance limits of pro-
tected columns described in this report
may serve as a guide for the selection
of constructions to meet building-code
requirements.
The results presented are those de-
rived from fire-endurance tests of six-
teen steel columns encased with gyp-
sura lath and gypsum plasters. The
laths were wired into place; those on
eight columns were of the fin. thick
perforated type in a single layer, those
on seven of the other eight columns
were of two layers of the fin. thick
plain type, and on the other a single
layer. Six of the latter eight also
had a layer of wire fabric to reinforce
the plaster. Expanded perlite was
used as the plaster aggregate for thir-
teen columns, sand for two, and ver-
miculite for one. The thickness of
the plasters ranged from fin. to 2in.
and those of the encasements from
fin. to 2fin.
The fire-resistance values indicated
by the tests varied with the composi-
tion, reinforcement, and thickness of
the protective coverings, and to some
degree with the size of the column.
The fire' endurance limits, as deter-
mined from the tests, ranged from 1
hour 23 minutes for a lOin, steel H-
section column protected with fin.
perforated lath and fin. of sanded
gypsum plaster to 4 hours 42 minutes
for one protected with two layers of
fin. lath and a Ifin. thickness of
perlite-gypsum plaster reinforced with
wire fabric.
1. Introduction.
The fire resistance of columns is
considered of prime importance in
buildings. Building regulations usual'
ly require fire' resistive columns,
whether they support roof or floors.
Columns are also frequently used in
conjunction with partitions or walls in
the sub'division of large buildings into
fire areas. The number of these areas
is determined by the required fire re'
sistance which, in turn, is governed
by the type of construction and the
amount of combustible material in'
volved in the occupancy of the build'
ing. The fire'resistance ratings of
columns or other building members
are based upon the results of standard
fire tests on representative construe'
tions.
Inasmuch as gypsum laths and light'
weight plasters are extensively used as
protective coverings for steel struc'
cures, a series of fire tests of columns
so protected was undertaken as a part
of the programme of research on
building materials and structures at the
National Bureau of Standards. Six'
teen steel H'section columns encased
with various combinations of gypsum
laths and plasters comprised this series.
Two of the sixteen columns were sub'
jected to fire tests while under load.
2. Results of Tests.
A general pattern of behaviour was
observed in all the tests. A network
of fine craze cracks covering the plas'
ter surface and thin cracks parallel to
and about 1 or 2in. away from the
corner beads developed early in the
tests. The latter extended over the
full exposed length of the protective
covering and by mid'test had grown
to widths ranging from fin. to fin.,
with evidence of curling of the white-
coat finish along the edges of the
plaster. Usually, too, by mid'test
shrinkage of the column covering
caused it to begin separating from the
column cap, thus creating an opening
all around the column. In compari-
son with the other cracks, these open'
ings widened more rapidly during the
rest of the test and are considered to
have contributed to hastening the
failure of the coverings protecting the
steel. The widths of these openings
at the times the column-shaft tern-
peratures reached the allowable limits
were estimated to range from -jin. to
2in., not excepting those columns
having cornerite and plaster intended
to cover the opening. Because of the
narrowness of these openings and their
position on the column, they were
probably a minor factor in the failure
of the columns tested under load.
Shrinkage of the type mentioned
above is characteristic of gypsum ex-
posed to fire.
In no test did any significant amount
of plaster covering fall before the
limit of temperature had been reach'
ed, notwithstanding the large cracks
parallel to the corner and the bulging
of the plaster and plaster bases. In
three instances, however, soon after
the permissible temperature limit of
the steel had been reached, the cover'
ings fell, exposing a large part of the
steel column shaft to the fire.
All the reinforcement used in the
tests was wrapped around the column.
In view of the difference in resistance
to compression in the transverse and
longitudinal directions of the wire
fabric, it is probable that better re'
suits could have been obtained with
the fabric applied as continuous strips
from too to bottom of the column,
thus providing less opportunity for
the sag of the plaster to open wide
cracks at the top cap.

dards. Washington, 25 D.C., U.S.A.

Surfaces.
Taubraans’ “Gentile” is a paint
specially designed for the exterior
painting of homes, commercial build-
ings and factories. Its outstanding fea-
ture is that due to its resistance to the
chemical reaction of cement, it may
be applied directly to dry new cement
rendered surfaces, brickwork, etc., ob-
viating the necessity of the customary
Sealer, and “Centite” fills the surface,
leaving a durable finish which is abso-
lutely waterproof. Asbestos cement,
however, should first be sealed with

CASTRIES IS REBUILT
A MODERN TOWN RISES ON THE ASHES OF THE OLD ON ST. LUCIA.
Castries is the capital of St. Lucia,
second largest island in the British
Windward Group. In June, 1948, 20
acres of the town were devastated by
a fire which raged for 8 hours. It
destroyed private, commercial and ad-
ministrative buildings leaving others
irreparably damaged. Today, as a
result of the British Government’s
help, a modern Castries has risen on
the ashes of the old, built by the Is'
landers themselves under expert sup'
■envision.
Ramshackle shanties have been sue'
ceeded by modern blocks of flats. The
haphazard intermingling of public,
private and commercial buildings of
the old Castries has been replaced by
a welhplanned new town w r ith resb
dential, shopping and administrative
zones. Narrow, congested streets
have been turned into wide thorough'
fares that can cope with modern traf'
fic in comfort. A new sewerage sys-
tern with pumping stations and urn
derground sewers is now in being,
where none existed before. High
pressure water mains including points
for fire'fighting have been installed.
A modern Custom House and an up'
to'date Fire Station, Police Barracks,
and a Police Station—all these and
more have been built in four years.
A new Government Office building
with a fine Council Chamber, new
Law Courts, a Government Printing
Office are other aspects of the re'
building of Castries which have neared
completion. The British Government
made a free grant covering the best
part of the cost of a government
housing scheme and the whole cost
of installing and repairing essential
services. The latest estimate of the
rebuilding programme was <£1,800,000
in 1950.
Islanders who previously sought
work as unskilled labourers have now
learned to work with concrete and
steel and are capable of becoming,
after a short period of training, com'
petent craftsmen in the building
trade. This will help to solve the
manpower surplus problem facing St.
Lucia as well as make these Islanders
an asset to the colony.

The Island of Sf. Lucia has a deep wafer frontage at Port Chartries, an English

MEET THE MASTER
BUILDERS
born at Burwood. Sydney, on November
22, 1914, Mr. Quick may be described
as a young man full of optimism, for the
promise of life offers much for the fu-
ture. With a past full of knotty prob-
lems, "too numerous to mention" he
has taken delight in overcoming them,
so that now his life in retrospect and
prospect, reads like an open book. He
has had many achievements, but his
greatest achievement is still to come.
Apart from travelling all over Aus-
tralia, he saw the East. Middle East
and other lands during his 65 years ser-
vice with the R.A.A.F, from 1939/
1946.
He likes everything including duty to
the building fraternity, for he rose to
be president of the Western Suburbs
Master Builders' Association and went
as a member of several delegations to
the M.B.A. of N.S.W.
He is a member of the Local Parents
and Citizens' Association, the local R.S.
L. Building Committee and the Munici-
pal Progress Association, in addition to
which he works for the Poliomyelitus So-
ciety of N.S.W.
He likes music and sport and is a
member of the Eastern Suburbs Tennis
Association.
His favourite quotation is:
"A man must keep abreast of the
advancing tide of knowledge and
must peer into the future with a
sound appreciation of the past;
concentration and judgment, ex-
perience and industry. Patience
and perseverance must come to-
gether in the successful life, but
with them all and above them all.
must come the finer things; the
things that make the difference be-
tween the men who leave the world
no better than they found it and
the men whose spirits forever heunt
the eternal shores of time."
A. Meed
is rather an enterprising young Sydney-
sider of 35 summers, whose building
"nous" was "born in the blood," for he
has already made his mark in the build-
ing trade. He is at present engaged in
erecting a three-storey block of shops
and offices in Manly for the Chic
Salon (N.S.W.) Pty. Ltd., and also build-
ing a modern new factory and offices
for the housing of his own firm at 70
Hotham Parade, Artarmon.
He is particularly proud of the re-
modelling job he carried out for
Greddens Pty. Ltd., at 116 King St„
Sydney.
Mr. Speers considers that surmounting
the problems encountered in connection
with staircase headroom and egg-crate
(plastic louvre) ceilings called for more
practical application of his natural in-
genuity than any other facet of build-
ing operations, but these he has attack-
ed and surmounted with his usual de-
termination and drive.
He has travelled over many parts of
Australia and New Guinea.
He is a keen sportsman but his fa-
vourite game is golf.
He cites Henry Drummond as the
author of his favourite quotation:
"Half the world is on the wrong
scent In the pursuit of happiness.
They think it consists in having,
and getting, and being served by
others. It consists in giving and
in serving. He who would be great
among you, let him serve."
Born at Hay, N.S.W., on I Ofh May,
1907, Tom Patterson has taken a keen
delight in whatever he is called upon to
do. whether it be the well-being of the
building fraternity as a whole, or build-
ing cottages for a home-hungry popu-
lace. Before the war some of his "ar-
chitected" structures, full of charm as
well as appropriateness and convenience,
were such as to engender pride of at-
tainment, and in this regard mention is
made of Architect John R. Brogan in
connection with a residence, in particu-
lar, at Vaucluse of which one could
well be proud.
In the last five years Tom Patterson
has been a Committee member and
Vice-President of St. George and Suth-
erland M.8.A., of which he is now Presi-
dent.
During the war, as Chief Supervisor,
with the Department of the Interior in
the Northern Territory, one of his jobs
ran into £lOO,OOO. Still with the Depart-
ment of the Interior he was supervisor
under Architect Tavener for the Herne
Bay Hospital, built originally for the
American troops.
In his early days he played for the
St. George Rugby League Football
Club; he has represented the district
at tennis, and still plays A Grade com-
petitive tennis.
His favourite quotation: "Do unto
others as you would have others do unto
you."
In the little fishing village of
Volendam, Holland, a house is paper*
ed with 250,000 colourful cigar bands,
which have been collected from all
over the world. So intricate and onv
amental are the wall and ceiling de*
signs that it has taken the owner three
years to glue them into position.

MASTER BUILDERS’ ASSOCIATION OF N.S.W.
EIGHTIETH ANNUAL MEETING.
The 80th Annual Meeting of the
Master Builders’ Association of
N.S.W. was held in the Association’s
Rooms, Castlereagh Street.
The following Office-bearers were
elected for 1953-54:
President: Percy Bottomley.
Senior Vice-President; K. C. Mc-
Gregor.
Junior Vice-P resident: W. J.
Bryant.
Hon. Treasurer: A. W. Edwards.
President’s Report.
In presenting his Annual Report
for the year 1952-53, the President,
Mr. Charles E. Thompson, F.A.1.8.,
said:
Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to report to you
on some of the more important ac-
tivities that have occupied the Asso-
ciation during the year ending Aug-
ust, 1953.
It has been an unsettled period for
the industry although costs have con-
tinued to rise they have not done
so in such an alarming manner as
they did in 1951-52. The effect of
the Federal Government’s financial
policy is being felt and I feel that it
has helped to stabilise our industry
by the return of keen healthy compe-
tition. We are now back to firm
prices for home building and within
limitations, much industrial work also.
I wish to pay tribute to the valu-
able help afforded me by my fellow
Executive Officers, Committeemen and
the representatives of the kindred As-
sociations who have done so much
to lighten the problems which have
confronted me.
As I foreshadowed in last year’s
report, this year’s activities have been
of such magnitude that the Associa-
tion is becoming one of the foremost
Employers’ Organisations in the
Commonwealth, and our service to
members and the community of the
utmost importance.
Building Survey.
During the current year buildings
to the value of <£90,084,000 were
completed in New South Wales, and
of this amount £61,133,000 were
spent on housing. 26,134 dwellings
were completed, as compared with
23,212 last year, 13,983 of this num-
ber being in the metropolitan area.
Of this number 2,097 were for the
New South Wales Housing Commis-
sion.
The number of employees in the
industry has fallen from 45,470 to
36,930, the lowest it has been for a
number of years. Accurate figures as
to the number of builders who have
ceased operations are not available,
but it is significant that the Associa-
tion has had only nine resignations
and the majority of these from elder
members. We may assume that many
newcomers have withdrawn from the
industry with the return of compete
tion.
The rate of commencements in
housing fell sharply during the June-
September, 1952, quarter, but increas-
ed during the December quarter and
remained steady since. The rate of
completions increased in the same
ratio, mainly due to materials becom-
ing readily available and a stabilising
labour market.
We should not be over-optimistic
regarding the supply of materials, for,
although competition has returned to
the industry, any sudden increase in
building activity must be reflected in
availability of materials, particularly
bricks, roofing tiles, lime and cement.
Rising costs are a continuing prob'
lem, and we must realise that they
will never return to pre-war rates.
The ‘benefits” of a 40-hour week,
two weeks annual leave, one week’s
sick leave, ten public holidays, in-
creased margins and last, but not least,
long service leave—all “given” by
Government Statute— cannot be en-
joyed without increasing costs.
Affiliation With Suburban
Master Builders’ Associations.
On June 30, 1953, one of the
most important moves in the Build-
ing Industry occurred when formal
agreements were signed with eight
Suburban Master Builders’ Associa-
tions. These Branches will, while re'
taining their autonomy, become
Branches of this Association, with a
direct voice in the policy of the Mast'
er Builders’ Association. I feel that
this unity will be a force for good in
the State of New South Wale's. The
interests of the general public are
paramount and will be better served.
Our approach to other bodies is
strengthened by the knowledge that
we are speaking with one voice rep'
resenting a major industry. To Mr.
Wal Bryant, former President of the
Council of Suburban Master Builders’
Associations, and his fellow Branch
Presidents, I extend my sincere thanks
for their efforts towards bringing
about this notable amalgamation.
Membership.
During the year our membership
has increased by 96. This Associa'
tion and its Branches now represents
almost 2,000 Master Builders. We
arc the largest Builders’ Association
in the Commonwealth. I urge mem'
bers to do all within their power to
further strengthen our numbers by
introducing new members who will
uphold the high principles of the As'
sociation.
Industrial.
This year has seen a return to
commonsense from an industrial point
u The frivilous stoppages
which beset us last year have practi'
cally ceased. Disputes which have
arisen have been of a comparatively
minor nature and speedily settled on
submission to the Arbitration Court.
All apprenticeship awards have
been renewed, following the review
of tradesmen’s rates during 1951-
1952 It is felt that the Association’s
appeal against an interim increase
awarded to carpenter apprentices in
October last helped to keep the in'
creased wage rates awarded to a min'
imum. Whilst apprenticeship awards
are generous in many respects, there
are also obligations imposed on
apprentices, and I urge members to
understand their award conditions and
apply them rigidly, particularly in re'
spect to sick leave and tool allow'
ances. Where any doubts arise the
Association should be consulted. The
number of lads entering the bricklay'
mg, plastering and plumbing trades
are comparatively few and we must

Every year hundreds of commercial and industrial con-
cerns are “burnt into bankruptcy.” Most of these disasters
would have been avoided if Guardian Automatic Fire
Alarms had been installed. The moment a fire starts the
specially designed thermostat of the Guardian Automatic

it transmits a signal through the control panel in the

encourage interest to ensure a con'
tinuance of these trades.
The basic wage continues to rise
and has now reached £l2/3/0 per
week. The upward trend has not
been so great as heretofore, amounting
to 8A for the year. While it con'
tinues to rise costs must also, and it
is'to be hoped that a peak has been
reached.
During the year a new union has
entered the field, namely, The Amah
gamated Society of Carpenters and
Joiners, which is attempting to take
control of carpenters from the B.W.
I.U. This new union has secured a
Federal Award covering its members
in identical terms with our present
State Award for carpenters (with the
exception that there is no long ser'
vice leave provision). To date we
have not been unduly worried by their
activities, but it is inevitable that
there will be some inter union fric-
tion, and I advise members to remain
strictly neutral in the issue, for com'
pulsory unionism is not yet with us
and an employee is free to join
whatever union he pleases. Should
any disputes arise the Association
should be informed immediately.
The State Government’s intention
to amend the Arbitration Act to pro'
vide compulsory unionism has been
shelved following strong criticism,
even from within union circles. Apart
from this blatant attempt at regi'
mentation, we should not lose sight
of the fact that our organisation also
draws its being and powers from the
same Act of Parliament as employee
unions. Whilst the idea has been
shelved, it may only be temporary
and we must be prepared to oppose
any attempt to revive it, not only
in our own interests but those of the
comunity who have no wish to live
in a Socialistic State.
Federation Convention and
Executive Conferences.
The Annual Convention of the
Master Builders’ Federation was held
in Perth from 15th to 19th Sep'
tember, 1952, and was attended by
Messrs. K. C. McGregor, A. W. Ed'
wards, W. J. Bryant, and myself.
The major matters discussed included
the provision of quantities, a rise and
fall formula, the establishment of a
standard mode of measurement on a
Commonwealth basis, agreements with
the Royal Australian Institute of Ar'
chitects, imported prefabricated build'
ings and day labour. All these
matters have been reported to you
previously, so I will not elaborate
further.
A meeting of the Federation’s Exe'
cutive was held in Canberra on 7th
May, 1953, concurrently with that of
the Council of the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects. This allowed
definite progress to be made with that
body in the direction of quantity
limits and the introduction of a rise
and fall formula.
Conditions of Contract.
Following problems submitted to
the Association, a sub'eommittee has
been formed to review all forms of
contracts. This committee will have
many deliberations before it will be
in a position to make positive recom'
mendations. A further sub'commit'
tee is also investigating a form of con'
tract for use with subcontractors
Whilst the forms of contract avail'
able from the Association are not per'
feet documents, I urge members to
use them and enter into written con'
tracts on all occasions. The use of
loosely framed, privately prepared
documents or no contract at all can
e very dangerous and lead to delays
in payment and litigation. Members
are strongly advised to get any in-
structions varying contracts in writ'
mg. Any amendment affecting plans
already approved should be notified
o the appropriate Council, and ap-
proval sought for the altered plans
before proceeding with the work.
Common Law Insurance.

Considerable publicity has been
given to enormous verdicts granted
by juries in Common Law claims. Re'
cently an employee was awarded
£5,000 for the loss of three fingers
(under Workers’ Compensation Law
such an injury is limited to £750).

“Construction.”
Our official journal, “Construction,’’
has been a valuable source of infor-
mation to members throughout the
year, and additions to the paper have
been received with great interest. I
extend my sincere thanks to the
Editor, Mrs. Florence Taylor, 0.8. E.,
for her generous assistance to the in-
dustry and Mr. Reay Wilson for his
ready co-operation at all times.
Obituary.
It is with sincere regret that I have
to report the passing of a number of
well-known members since my last
report. These included:
Mr. Eric Rogers, of Oberon, on
sth June, 1952, who had been a
country member of the Association
since 28th June, 1938;
Mr. Harry Wall, of Messrs. Robert
Wall 6? Sons Pty. Ltd., on 30th No-
vember, 1952. Harry joined the As-
sociation on 22nd August, 1944, as
an additional representative of the
Company, who have been members
since 23rd April, 1906;
Mr. Fred. Wilson, 0.8. E., F. 1.0.8.,
F.A.1.8., of Howie Moffat & Co. Pty.
Ltd., on 14th June, 1953. During
his career Fred, served as a Commit-
teeman, President of the Association,
President of the Master Builders’
Federation, President of Building In-
dustry Congress, President of the Fed-
eral Council of Building Industry
Congress and Charter President of the
Australian Institute of Builders.
Social.
Important social functions included
the Annual Dinner at the Wentworth
Hotel on 17th October last. This
function was attended by a very rep-
resentative gathering of those engaged
in the industry. I also had the
pleasure of presenting the first
Florence M. Taylor Award to our
esteemed member Charles F. Gage,
F.A.1.8. Mrs. Florence M. Taylor was
herself a recipient of a replica of the
plaque, at my hands, in recognition
of her great efforts on behalf of our
calling.
The Annual Ball held recently at
the Trocadero was a great success.
This was the first major social event
since the affiliation of the Suburban
Associations, and the funds of the
Legacy War Orphans’ Appeal will
benefit considerably as a result.
The Golf Club held monthly func-
tions, including matches against the
architects, under the popular organ-
isation of Mr. Percy Bottomley. His
efforts are greatly appreciated and
have done much to foster goodwill
throughout the industry.
The Bowls Club also held regular
fixtures, the most notable event be-
ing the Interstate James Wall Cup,
played in Adelaide and won by the
South Australian team. The Cup will
be played in Sydney next year, when
it will be our privilege to act as hosts
to the interstate visitors.
Conclusion.
It has been a busy year. Action
has commenced on matters which are
of the utmost importance to the Asso-
ciation. Among these is the re-draft-
ing of the Rules which is being con-
ducted by a special sub-committee.
Also it has been decided to move
the Association’s office to a close
central suburb to cater for the mem-
bers and the Exchange more econom-
ically and efficiently.
Following a period as Acting Sec-
retary, Mr. W. D. Ford was appoint-
ed Secretary on 25th November,
1952. To our Secretary and the staff
I express my thanks for their loyalty
and co-operation during this year of
office.

President.
FREEDOM CURTAILED
AND “DITHERED.”
The State Opposition Leader (Mr.
Treatt) said: “The Government should
abolish all price controls except on a
few essentials.’’
Why except on a few essentials?
Why not the lot?
It is simply maddening to attempt
to make purchases and be told “we
cannot stock those goods yet. We are
waiting for the price-fixing commis-
sioner to let us know the prices we
are to charge, otherwise we might be
caught up with a surplus of stocks that
we would have to sell at a loss.’’
How can any country progress with
its freedom curtailed and dithered?

dustry circles, because of his long con-
nection with Wunderlich Ltd., one of
Australia’s most progressive manufac-
turers of a wide range of building
materials.

FACTS.
In the latter half of the last cem
tury the king of Fiji offered his coun'
try as a British colony. It was
abruptly refused. In 1874 he again
pleaded to have Fiji annexed. This
time it was reluctantly accepted.
MURAL AND SCULPTURE.
Man m all ages has developed forms to satisfy his sense of decoration and in spite
of the withering blast of modernism that would sweep away all that lies in the
past new forms still continue to emerge. On the left is a remarkable example of
e mural in a modern office that gives the impression of looking out a window
down a street, when in fact it is a blank wall. On the right some very skilfully
conceived and laid brickwork provides a rich background to a sculpture of Joan of
Arc in the parabolic arch to the entrance of a modern church.

Building Industry Congress of Victoria
PRESIDENT’S REPORT.
Mr. R. B. Doyle, President of the
Building Industry Congress of Vic-
toria, in his Annual Report delivered
on August 14 said:
The year which ended on 30th
June last, completed the twenty-first
since the inauguration of Congress.
No year during my term as President
has been so auspicious as the one im-
mediately past. It was the year of
Coronation, and whilst preparing this
address, the gladdening news of an
armistice in Korea was announced.
The Trend of Business.
I was fortified in making predic-
tions last year by the information ob'
tamed from all sections of the indus-
try by the Opinion Poll (the first of
its kind) conducted by the Executive
Director during the second quarter
of 1952. The predictions made in
June, 1952, were borne out by actual
experience.
The results of the second Opinion
Poll which was completed in June,
1953, have been distributed to all
members of Congress and a studied ex-
amination of the opinions reproduced
therein crystalises the problems which
confront the industry.
The constriction of the Building In-
dustry may be taken as one of the
most damaging of all forms of econ-
omic restraint. It is now almost a
decade since the end of the war —yet
we are still subject to certain building
operations control. Rent control is
injurious to the economy yet is re-
tained through fear of political con-
sequences if it is removed. Price con-
trol is detrimental to the community,
yet the same fear exists of the conse-
quences of removal.
The results and conclusions of this
second Opinion Poll are commended
to all who have the future of the In-
dustry at heart. They are the consid'
ered opinions of those best fitted to
suggest where attention should be giv-
en to bring about a high level of
building activity.
Building Operations Control.
Almost 70 per cent, of the respond-
ents to the recent survey expressed
the opinion that there was no no-
iticeable difference in the volume of
business obtained as a result of the
removal of controls. The removal of
controls was too belated. If there
bad been more attention given to the
constructional needs of industry fol-
lowing the end of war, the picture
could have been very different. We
might have retarded the excessive and
unbalanced programme of Public
Works and this might in turn have
kept the general cost index at a more
healthy level.
Our national development and ex'
pansion, like that of the rest of the
great democracies, has been carried
out most during periods of freedom.
In most other countries this side of
the Iron Curtain there has been a
lessening of restrictions and a greater
removal of controls. Unfortunately, it
almost seems as though we have got
so used to controls that there is not
sufficient force behind our attempts to
secure their removal.
The position has been expressed
most appropriately by a member of
our industry, whose remarks I quote:
“We have reached a state of thral-
dom through own fault; a state when
encouragement 1S ©ven to the type of
politician who thrives on regulations.
Attempts to regain freedom are
frowned upon. Unless we take posi-
tive action we can never hope to ac-
quire the spirit which is evident
throughout the working population of
the United States—a spirit which leads
to the vast productive effort of that
country.’’
Price Control.
87 per cent, of the contractors who
replied to the recent questionnaire
sent out, said that price control
should be removed. If there were
solid grounds for believing that this
form of control helped to prevent
costs rising, the builder might be ex'
pected to favour its retention. On
the contrary, price control is of nega'
tive value to the builder.
The accent tO'day should be on pro'
ductivity. Price control certainly pro'
duces. It produces shortages and
black markets and pays a handsome
premium to the inefficient. Its men-
tion adds unnecessarily to the high
cost of Government. Excluding rent

Rent Control.
Rent control is with us still and
so the decomposition of rented pro-
perties continues to take place. That
we may reach a stage where owners
will repudiate ownership of properties
would seem to be a fantastic concep'
tion for Australians. It has happened
in France, it will happen here unless
there is a courageous and statesman-
like decision to cease this vicious form
of control.
There can be no doubt that the
retention of rent control is purely pol-
ideal. No party has dared to ap-
proach the matter on a broad and
equitable basis. As a result those
thrifty citizens who in the past built
Aouses for rental are barely receiving
sufficient to provide for adequate
maintenance of their property. Rents
in Victoria are believed to have only
increased by 2 per cent, as against
about 25 per cent, in other States.
In all equity this problem must be
tackled. I make the suggestion that
to avoid political repercussions the
matter should be the subject of an in-
vestigation by a joint committee of all
parties. Ample evidence will be avail-
able to influence a favourable deci-
sion to undertake at least a progres-
sive removal of this iniquitous con-
trol.
Import Restrictions.
Full credit is due to the Federal
Government for the courageous and
statesmanlike manner in which it ar-
rested the inflationary pressure during
the early stages of 1952,
The relaxation of restrictions in the
importation of certain essential mater'
ials recommended in my last year’s
report has been granted. I am con'
fident that prudent counsel coming
from this Congress, which has as its
basic consideration the welfare of all
sections, will be given the deserving
consideration of our Federal Govern'
ment.
Credit Restrictions,
This was the most effective medium
of many used by the Commonwealth
Government to counteract the spiral
of inflation during the early months
of 1952.
At the time of their introduction
many protests were made with some'
what undue haste. We expressed the
opinion in Victoria, after some exper'
ience of the effects of the restrictions.

that the financial policy of the Fed-
eral Government must receive ap-
proval. I see no reason now for re-
vision of that opinion for the practical
benefits of this action to the Build-
ing Industry is reflected in the reduc-
tion of building costs which is of
great importance to the community
and of value to the industry itself.
Building Costs.
There was evidence last year that
the upward spiral of building costs
had been halted. In our last survey
57 per cent, of the building contract-
ors who replied indicated that build-
ing costs had now been stabilised, 41
per cent, of the same group advised
that costs had actually dropped dur-
ing the past twelve months. The per-
centage decrease was stated by that
group to average 9\ per cent., a fig-
ure which was the average also indi-
cated by 62 per cent, of architects.
Although this reduction in costs is
very welcome there is no room for
complacency in the matter. If the
economic figure at which a purchaser
could without undue hardship enter
into the commitment of buying a
home is around two and a half times
his average annual earnings, then we
must continue to strive for further
reductions in building costs.
It is interesting to note that the
average weekly earnings per employ-
ed male in Victoria reached a peak of
£16.3 at December quarter, 1952, By
March, 1953, it had dropped to
£14.6, almost 10i per cent. On the
above basis we should strive to bring
the cost of workers’ homes down to
the £l9OO-£2OOO mark without re-
ducing the standards of habitation. It
is apparent there is need for still
greater economy in the costs of ma-
terials, labour and management.
Whether further economies can be
effected must be decided by each sec-
tion within the industry.
Productivity Team to Study Abroad.
I am pleased to be able to report
that real progress has been made in
furthering my suggestion that a
Building Industry Productivity Team
should visit America.
It has now been decided that a
representative team will leave next
year for America and proceed via the
United Kingdom.
Detailed arrangements as to the
itinerary are now being made and it
is hoped that the Department of Ex-
ternal Affairs and also the Depart-
ment of Commerce and Agriculture
will co-operate with us in every way.
Great credit is due to many dis-
tinguished members of our Industry
who have indicated their desire to
make this visit. At their own ex-
pense they wilf perform the great set-
vice of bringing back to Australia the
knowledge to be learned in America
—the greatest industrialised nation in
the world.
Transport Regulations.
The arbitrary direction to freight
many building materials and fittings
by rail is contrary to the interests of
the public—particularly the country
people of this State. Fifty-seven per
cent, of manufacturers and merchants
throughout the State, who co-operat-
ed in the recent Opinion Poll, said
that the enforcement of the Transport
Regulations was of adverse effect.
Congress must strongly protest
against the present policy of the Gov-
ernment regarding road transport. It
does claim that a thorough investiga-
tion should be made of railway admin-
istration. If there is room for any im-
provement in service, there is, un-
doubtedly, reason why a searching
enquiry should be made into the ex-
travagant cost of operation of the
public transport system.
Without the consolidating influence
of Congress the Building Industry
would be a group of disunited inter-

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


ests —each seeking to obtain recogni-
tion as an important section of the
Industry without the necessary back-
ing and strength of an incorporated
body.
The position has been clearly stated
by the Honorary Treasurer and Chair-
man of the Finance Committee who
emphasises the great value of Con-
gress when he says:—
“For protection purposes Congress
is essential to the well-being of the
Building Industry. It has been de-
monstrated that Governments respect
the strength of the organisation rep-
resenting the complete cohesion of
the industry, whereas it might willy-
nilly impose its whims on individual
unrelated sections. This latter point
would, of course, be more clearly de-
monstrated should Defence again de-
mand urgent national action.
“From within its own ranks Con-
gress can exert influences which guard
the ethical practices of this industry,
and which also tends towards indus-
trial friendships that might well be
lacking otherwise. In short, it pro-
vides a forum where the whole in-
dustry can unite, and in view of all
our experiences over the years, it is
unthinkable that we should go back
to the days before Congress.
“ . . . the cost of membership is
negligible in view of the valuable
benefits obtained. On those sections
who believe that unity is strength an
obligation for support is imposed.”
Stability is Strength
The emblem of a leading Austra'
lian Assurance Company depicts a man
vainly struggling to break a bundle
of small sticks across his knee: the
implication—Unity is Strength. And
so is Stability: a point emphasised in
the annual report of the Building In'
dustry Congress of N.S.W., presented
last week, which considers this factor
of stability to be the basic feature in
the building revival which is gather'
ing momentum daily.
‘For the first time in years Builders
are able to plan ahead in respect of
materials, says the report. “Build'
ers are now tendering firm prices in'
stead of cost plus quotations ...”
This indeed is a remarkable revolu'
tion in a short space of time and it has
enabled the building public to regain
their confidence in the industry which
largely through no fault of its own
had in the stress of circumstances lost
reliability and dependability. But this
fact was realised by every thinking
Master Builder and be it to their last'
ing credit that they have put their
disrupted house in order with energy
and speed, 'lo achieve this they have
been worthily assisted by their con-
feres, the manufacturers and material
suppliers who have also striven
mightily to bring about price stabil-
ity to their vital products.
And so price stability is emerging
and with it the inevitable reward for
sincere striving—the public are having
second thoughts on that building pro-
ject that they had last year abandoned
as hopeless or put “on the ice” indefi-
nitely.
That sensitive flower of confidence
which had firmly shut up its delicate
petals after the continuous blasts of the
fierce wind of inflation, is beginning
again to unfold to the warmth of the
sunshine of stability.
There is no question that building
is looking up each week and many
builders who were quiet for months
are now extremely busy; the Secretary
of the local Chapter of the R.A.I.A.
also reports a continuous stream of
architects buying in for contract
forms.
It is sincerely to be hoped that this
expansion will not lead to a new
tightening up of materials and labour
for this would inevitably sow the seeds
of another and more serious setback.
Manufacturers and merchants, many
of whom were caught with over large
stocks are being very canny at pres-
ent and producing or ordering more
or less from hand to mouth. While
this is understandable in some cases,
they should, in the light of events,
take stock of the present position and
take the necessary steps to see that
the appropriate flow of materials are
continuously available to meet the tide
that has turned and is again in good
flow.
Corner Site For
Funeral Home
Dignity in Keynote of Design.
A new Funeral Home which the
Metropolitan Burial and Cremation So-
ciety proposes to erect at Marrick-
ville, will incorporate a domestic style
of architecture to give an impression
of quiet dignity rather than that of
fulsomness or severity usually express'
ed in a business structure (see illus'
tration above).
Designed for the Society by archi'
tect T. M. Maloney, the Funeral
Home will have its business entrance
under a porte cochere on Marrick'
ville Road, and the Chapel will face
Victoria Road. The premises will oc'
cupy an imposing corner site.
The building will be set back from
the road sufficiently to afford space
for a garden and driveway.
The ground floor will comprise gen'
eral offices, chapel, with amenities as'
sociated with a Funeral Home, a flor-
ist and receptionist.
The upstairs portion will comprise
two selTcontained flats for resident
staff, with an open-air playground
(not shown).
The working drawings are nearing
completion, and erection of the build'
ing is expected to commence soon.
By 1960 the purest forms of petrol
and fuel oil and high octane motor
spirit will be produced as by-products
of the Morwell (Victoria) gas mak-
ing plant.

Registration of
Builders
Six months ago it looked as if a
forty-year-old fight for the Registra-
tion of Builders was about to be won.
What has happened to cause the delay
to that promising state of affairs?
The President of the N.S.W. Phar-
maceutical Society recently told the
Australian Pharmaceutical Conference
in Sydney that people with no connec-
tion whatever with pharmacy were
opening pharmacies all over the
country.
Well, that may be news in the
pharmacy world, but it is not to the
Master Builders, for they have had
to tolerate a similar situation in the
building industry for years. This evil
was greatly intensified during the post-
war period, when any Tom, Dick or
Harry, who thought that there was an
opportunity to batten on the desper-
ation of the home-starved public,
started to do some alleged building
with probably less qualifications to
build than the “watchmakers and
food vendors” whom it was said were
running pharmacies.
Capitalising on the appalling hous-
ing shortage, snide builders embarked
on their notorious “rob-and-run” tac-
tics in large numbers. A few were
caught and received jail sentences;
many escaped scot-free.
Some were scoundrels, others fools,
but the public suffered in both cases
and so by implication did the ancient
and honourable craft of Building.
What a crazy set-up it is. Anyone,
bv merely printing a letterhead and
erecting a sign, can be a builder.
Can employ skilled craftsmen, like
electricians, plumbers and drainers,
each of whom has to be registered and
licensed and who cannot achieve these
qualifications without arduous train-
ing and experience. Surely a situa-
tion to delight the cynical Gilbert!
Building today is a job for a man
skilled in the many-sided aspects of
the technical skill and commercial and
organising ability necessary to success-
fully build and only those so equipped
should be able to undertake such vit-
al work.
There is nothing unfair about the
proposition; no forming of a pro-
tected class, for registration will be
open to all who have been properly
trained and have appropriate experi-
ence. Architects, Surveyors, Solicitors
-—professional men connected with
building are also registered and can
only attain this status by proper train-
ing. Why not the key man in the
building cycle—the Master Builder?
The New South Wales Govern-
ment should implement this import-
ant reform without further delay.
N.Z. Home-Building
Scheme
Encouragement for Amateur
Builders.
The N.Z. Government is reported
to be tackling vigorously the problem
of bringing homes within reach of
people with limited financial resources.
Although an estimated 15,000
houses are being built each year in the
Dominion, the housing shortage is
just as serious (pro rata of the popula-
tion) as it is in Australia.
One of the most practicable and
commendable schemes at present un-
der consideration by the N.Z. Gov-
ernment, is a plan to enable young
people to build their own homes, en-
tirely or in part, and thereby reduce
the cost to a figure they can meet.
Technical Training.
It is proposed that the young home
builders be given instruction at tech'
nical colleges in various centres
throughout the Dominion, that they
be enabled to purchase plans and spec'
ifications at a nominal price, and that
for those who do not wish to under-
take the whole job tradesmen will
build to the stage of completed walls
and roofing, leaving the interior work
to the amateur builders.
It is thought that the idea of having
basic construction handled by trades-
men will appeal to the financing auth-
orities, who can thus be certain that
the asset they are helping to create
is fundamentally a sound and secure
one.
The scheme at present under con-
sideration is an attempt to overcome
the difficulties of amateur home-build-
ers, and assist them to avoid the many
pitfalls awaiting the unskilled builder.
With the aid of instruction at tech-
nical colleges and plans and specifica-
tions drawn up in conformity with the
standard N.Z. building code, home-
building, it is believed, can be speeded
up.
Shortage of Tradesmen.
The proposal to extend the activi-
ties of the technical colleges follows
the lines of some Sydney colleges,
where even eager women home-build-
ers have taken bricklaying courses.
The only drawback to the N.Z.
scheme will be the shortage of job-
bing tradesmen, as there is more than
enough work in building in the Do-
minion to keep all the tradesmen fully
occupied.
However, the plan enjoys Govern-
ment sponsorship, and any scheme to
help people build their own homes at
a reasonable cost is assured of the full-
est support, the Acting Prime Minister
said recently.
NORWEGIAN EMPLOYERS’
FEDERATION BUILDING, OSLO.
(Top) Exterior of the headquarters of the
Norwegian Employers’ Association, Oslo.
Construction was begun in 1947, and com-
pleted, after some delay, in 1951. In accord-
ance with building regulations, the structure
has seven storeys above ground along one
frontage, and six along the other, plus one
roof storey retracted from the street. The
corner itself is dominated by a prominent
tower-like part of the building. The main
entrance is on the side of the seven-storey
frontage (sec illustration) and gives on to a
spacious vestibule containing the main stair-
case and three lifts. A secondary entrance
is situated on the side of the six-storey front-
age. Th e structure consists largely of rein-
forced concrete, with the exception of some
free-standing stanchions which are built of
stone-lined steel profiles to minimise their
width. The facades are lined with stone
slabs and, in some parts with copper sheeting.
(Bottom) SCHOOL AT PORTO FARINA,
TUNISIA.
Built overlooking the lagoon at Porto Farina,
this fine school, of an architecture unfamiliar
to our eyes, is typical of that commonly seen
in Tunisia. The school, designed by French
architect Paul Herbe, has eight classrooms.
Three of the classrooms, situated on the
ground floor, are for girls, while the remain-
ing five, for boys, are on the first floor.
A ramp of easy grade connects the two floors.
The unusual colonnade and galleries give ample
shelter from the hot sun and winds; a very
important consideration in sweltering Tunisia.

The Master Builders’
Federation of
Australia
Forthcoming Convention in
Melbourne.
Forecast of “Bright Future”
Fulfilled.
The 47th Annual Convention of
the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia will open in Melbourne on
Monday, October 5.
Delegates will once again assemble
from the six States, the Northern
Territory, and the A.C.T., to deliber'
ate upon problems confronting the
Australian building industry.
Future Bright.
In this regard, it is interesting to
reflect upon the forecasts made last
year in Perth by delegates that “a
bright future lay ahead of the indus-
try.”
In recent months there has been
very definite signs that building con'
struction is on the up'grade, as con'
firmed by official statistics, and this
fact proves in full the almost uncanny
knowledge our building industry lead'
ers, as personified by the Federation
Executive, possess.
Fruitful Deliberations
As the Federation President, Mr. C.
R. Hansen, of Melbourne, said in his
closing address at Perth:
“Our deliberations have been very
fruitful, and the whole Convention
has been an unqualified success.
“The work done here augurs well
for the future of the Australian build'
ing industry.”
The Melbourne Convention will be
the forty'seventh of its kind held in
the 63 years of its fruitful existence.
Oldest Employers’ Federation.
The Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia, which is the oldest employ'
ers’ federation in Australia, was
founded at Sydney on November 19,
1890, under the title; The Federated
Master Builders and Contractors’ Asso'
ciation of Australasia.
There were present 15 representa'
tives of N.S.W., seven Victorians, and
six Queenslanders.
The President of the Sydney As'
sociation, Mr. Peter Dow, was elected
Chairman, and the chief work of the
Convention was the drawing up of
the Constitution.
The Federation which a handful of
Master Builder stalwarts started in
1890 in Sydney has grown tremend'
ously both in membership and in in'
fluence in the years between, and its
future progress is secure in the hands
of the capable men who each year
achieve the high status of the Federa'
tion Executive.
Demolition of
Exhibition Building
The Sydney City Council accepted
the tender of Mr. H. J. Abbey, Mast'
er Builder, of Epping, for demolition
ot the historic Exhibition Building
in Prince Alfred Park.
Mr. Abbey’s tender was the lowest
—for <£6B7—with a time limit of 154
weeks.
In all, 12 tenders were received for
the work, and prices ranged from <£6B7
to £11,960.

An admiral who had spent all n;s
life in the service of the Navy, was
retired to a staff position ashore. An
official warned him against an attrac'
tive typiste in the office. “She is
nothing but a siren,” he was told.
“You should do something about it.”
Now the only sirens the admiral
knew were syrens. A bit embarrassed,
he called the girl into his room and
said gruffly, “I hear you are making

Floor, and in all toilets, tiles have
been used, and in the Saloon Bar,
asphalt tiles were substituted to create
a slightly different atmosphere, to-
gether with wall panelling and mirror
treatment to the back fitment of the
Bars.
The Main Vestibule.
The Main Vestibule to the Bar
Block, which also serves the Main
House Block, is paved with handdaid
marble mosaic brought to a polished
finish, and the walls are panelled in
sepelli mahogany.
Light fittings are mainly of fluores-
cent type, both flush and pendant
varieties, and gas heating is installed
to cater for winter temperature.
The building was completely re'
wired for electric light and power, and
an emergency lighting system was in'
stalled operating on a petrol'driven
generator in the basement.
New Facade.
The new facade, composed of light-
coloured structural brick and stone,
was built nine feet out from the
original “Oriana" fact, and this allow'
ed the inclusion of private bathrooms
and sitting annexes with wide windows
in the upper-storey bedrooms.
The building has four lounges. Two
are smaller guest lounges on the resi-
dential floors, the third is at the side
of the main entrance, and the fourth
is the Canberra Lounge in the Bar
Block.

The Lounge itself has flush con'
cealed lighting, and coloured spot light'
ing set into the ceiling has been used
to relieve ceiling shadow.
On each side of the Lounge, murals
with international and local motifs
adorn the walls in three spaces of five
feet by fifteen feet. They were done
by a New Australian graduate of the
Swiss Art Academy, Richard Bauer,
who came to Australia in 1947 and
was painting the walls of the hotel to'
gether with other house painters be'
fore the management discovered his
qualifications as an artist and com'
missioned him to do these murals.
The Lounge also has a timber'
framed strutted roof off hardwood,
sheeted with corrugated iron, which
can be lifted entirely to allow for the
erection of another storey above the
Canberra Lounge, for which provision
has been made.
A convenient space has been alio'
cated to a selLcontained lounge, kit'
chen which is connected by a stairway
to the main kitchen in case of its

The main kitchen, which is staffed
by twelve chefs, is fitted with two
heavy'duty gas ranges, boiling table,

A “Believe It-Or-Not”
House
Roof Supports The Walls!
A recently'completed house in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, is some'
thing startling in the field of home
designs. The house appears to defy
the law of gravity by having the roof
hold up the walls.
This unique home features a “stress'
ed'skin” construction that takes the
weight off the walls, thus providing a
flexible wall that simplifies room lay'
out.
With the roof constituting the
major supporting unit for the whole
house, says the “Christian Science
Monitor,” the walls can be shifted
around with little consideration for
the weight they might normally bear.
The result gives spaciousness at a cost
considerably below the figure needed
for a conventional house of similar
size.
Simple Principle.
How did designer Mr. Carl Koch,
do it? the article asks.
Fold a piece of fabric over a stick
in one hand, push the fabric out on
either side and pull it taut at the
bottom, and what happens?
The strain falls on the stick at the
top, while the pressure of the fabric
constitutes an upward tug rather
than a downward drain on the base.
In Mr. Koch’s house the centre
beam at the very peak of the roof is
the stick, or the major supporting
unit of the house. Plywood panels
are used for the walls.
Mr. Koch has not only provided
floor'to'roof windows but he has cov'
ered the interior walls with the same
type of weatherboard that is used on
the exterior.
The house has a combination
kitchen, dining, and living room
downstairs, three upstairs bedrooms,
and a large downstairs room suitable
for an extra living room or study.
Stressed-Skin Construction.
Mr. Koch set out to create a house
with more usable space within the
limits of a conventionally sized home.
The stressed'skin type of construction
achieves this by minimising the need
for load'bearing partitions.
The Koch method of using prefab'
ricated panels makes it possible to
erect and enclose the main structure of
a house from the foundation up in a
single day, making building opera'
tions less dependent on the weather,
the article adds.

Timber Homes
Become Popular
Official Figures Confirm Trend.
The latest figures released by Gov-
ernment Statisticians of the various
States show that the trend for tim-
ber homes, as against brick or fibro,
is rapidly spreading right across the
continent, the Director of The Timber
Development Association of Australia,
Mr. Colin Davis, said last week.
In an authoritative round-up of of-
ficial Government figures, it is appar-
ent that many more timber homes are
being built, their cheapness and
“changed architecture” make an ap-
peal to young couples.
Figures given by Mr. Davis were:
• Queensland: Of 2473 new homes
built in the State during the March
quarter of 1953, 1546 were timber
and 228 brick or concrete. Average
cost of these houses was £2856 for
brick, £1905 for timber, £1516 for
fibro.
• Victoria: Of a total of 6585
homes built last year 4181 were tim-
ber and 733 brick. Average price of
each brick home was £4580; the tim-
ber homes averaged £2400 each.
• Tasmania: The average number
of umber homes under construction
in the March quarter was 2308 or
53.1 per cent, of the total, while
brick or concrete represented 24.7 per
cent, or 569.
• South Australia. The number of
timber homes erected each year has
risen from 23 3 in 1947 to 1153 in
1952 —an increase of almost 500 per
cent., whereas the number of brick
homes has risen from 2377 in 1947 to
4272 last year, or approximately 180
per cent.
• New South Wales. The number
of brick or timber homes completed
during the March quarter were about
the same, with 1518 brick and 1435
timber, but timber homes are gaining
in popularity because of their variety
of colourful designs.
Mr. Davis said that the Australian
timber industry is one of the country’s
most important industries, employing
hundreds of thousands of men.
“The popularity of timber must un-
doubtedly help the country sawmillers
who have worked under such difficul-
ties and done so much for the country
when overseas timbers were almost un-
procurable,” he declared.

The installation of Fibrous Plaster and 8.1. Acoustic Tiles, carried out to detail to
the Hotel Manhattan, is a creditable example of the class of work carried out by
Healy Bros., Montague Road, South Brisbane.
The 8.1. Acoustic Tiles, noise-absorbing and decorative, were manufactured by Healy
Bros., and, combined with Fibrous Plaster, resulted in an interior lining to meet all
modern requirements, beauty, acoustic qualities and durability.

35ft. by 10ft., 24ft. by Bft., and others
10ft. by 6ft., entailed the use of 2000
square feet of tarpaulins to convert
the Hotel Manhattan into a suitably
large darkroom.
Specially'made frames in forty feet
lengths were built to expose the
photographic paper. To process the
murals, 400 gallons of developer and
hypo solution were used. The full
length of each mural was exposed and
developed in one piece on a concrete
floor, the area of the five of them
being 720 square feet.
As a feat in enlarging, it is interest'
ing to note that the largest of the
murals that of Moreton Bay and
Island was enlarged 6500 times
larger than the area of the negative.
In the ballroom, the area of which
is 69ft. x 18ft., there are murals of
the best'known seaside places from
Southport to Coolangatta and Tweed
Heads, the twin towns on the border
line of Queensland and New South
Wales, a distance of nearly twenty
miles. In the striking view of the
latter town can be seen the Tweed
River, Ocean Bar, magnificent blend'
ing of sea coast, inland lakes fringed
by the McPherson Range, with Mt.
Warning in the centre of the picture
and rising to over 4000 ft., unchanged
since the day when Captain James
Cook named it in his voyage down the
east coast of Australia.
Side by side with the ballroom,
69ft. x 18ft., adjoining the lounge,
90ft. x 36ft., is the opemair beer
garden—with chromium'plated furnh
ture —from the overhead beams of
which hang tropical ferns.

THE H.C.S. THERMOSTAT GIVES
★ Temperature Control
* Pre-Heat Control
★ G Control
Satchwell H.C.S. design makes installation
easy; its smart appearance helps build sales
for retailers, and its automatic control of
pre-heat, oven temperature and griller control
(all by one knob) delights the housewife.
"H.C.S/ 7 are hydraulically controlled and
particularly suitable for ovens where the
element arrangement demands flexibility
between the thermally sensitive element and
the external control knob.
Relative positions of the Satchwell 7/ H.C.5. 7/
phial and knob are limited only by the length
of the capillary tube.
Pilot lamps indicate when elements are carry-
ing current and when oven has reached desired
temperature, after initial heating. Oven
thermometer is unnecessary.
Temperature range of the four "H.C.S."
thermostats is 200/600°F. The control knobs
are marked 200/550°F. Additional control
switch is unnecessary, as in the "off" position,
the contacts will not close no matter how low
the ambient temperature.
FOUR TYPES OF “HC.S.” THERMOSTATS
1. A single-stage instrument suitable for side and
bottom heat cookers.
2. A two-stage instrument for high loaded side and
bottom heat cookers, having high loadings for quick
pre-heating.
3. A three-stage instrument for top and bottom heat
cookers wherein the top elements are used for grilling
(broiling) and also quick pre-heating.
4. Three-stage instrument similar to 3 above but with
provision for additional control by time switch.

The “Manhattan,” the previous
name of which was “Delaney’s Hotel
has been undergoing extensive altera'
tions for many months, a task of no
mean order when, apart from the
original building of three storeys
which could not be regarded as de
luxe by any standards in the social
sphere, has now an interior which is
all that. All this former mediocrity
has to be lived down, and will be,
since many wedding receptions are
planned to take place in the Compass
Room and balls and parties in the
ballroom. As time goes on, there will
be high'dass accommodation for a
limited number of guests who would
be attracted by the Manhattan s
proximity to the interstate railway
station and to the city proper across
the Victoria Bridge.

George Hudson Pty. Ltd.
OPEN NEW CITY OFFICES.
A HUNDRED YEARS OF PROGRESS.
September 22nd, 1953, marked yet
another important milestone in the
development of the old established
firm of George Hudson Pty. Ltd., for
on this occasion the company’s new
premises Hudson House at 219
Elizabeth Street, Sydney, were official'
ly opened.
To mark this event in their history
the Directors gave a party in the new
showrooms, which was attended by
large numbers of the Timber Indus-
try, Builders, Architects and those as-
sociated with the Building Industry.
6000 Homes
Since the War.
The Managing Director, Mr.
Charles H. Hando, in his remarks
said with pride that since the termina-
tion of the war the company had sup-
plied complete, ready for erection,
over 6000 new homes, not including
outhouses, garages, etc.
“The demand for the company’s
products is on a high level, but we
are finding our clients are having in-
creasing difficulties in securing the
necessary financial assistance. It does
seem a tragedy in a country progress-
ing as Australia is, with the unsatL-
fied demand for new homes, that in-
sufficient loan funds are available for
this very necessary development.
Many of our prospective clients have
their own land, and a fair proportion
of ready cash, but need loan assistance.
“We believe the name of Hudson’s,
and with it its ‘Ready Cut Homes,’
after well over half a century in this
department, has proved second to
none, and with our expansion in re-
cent years to our own production of
indigenous timbers, blended as ex-
perience directs us with imported soft'
woods, we should go forward to even
greater service to the public than
ever before. The Hudson Ready Cut
Home is not just a prefabricated
package building - we claim it is
second to none as a finished product
and a permanent dwelling.
“It may interest you all to know
that with our extensive experience
based on over half a century, we know
of practically no instances where
owners have failed to repay borrowed
funds in full.”
Difficulty of Securing Premises.
The city offices established by the
company thirty ago in Castle'
reagh Street had become entirely in'
adequate, but the problem of obtain-
ing a larger building had been very
great.
The present premises had been pur-
chased some three years ago, but it
had taken considerable time to obtain
possession of even two floors of the
building so that the present remodel-
ling could be carried out.
Mr. Hando paid tribute to Mr.
Crawfurd H. Mackellar, the architect
who had carried out the remodelling,
and to Mr. Knight, of Howie Moffatt
6? Co. Pty. Ltd., the builders who had
executed the work, and to the many
sub'contractors and suppliers of mate-
rial who had assisted them.
The interior display portion of the
building is still not complete, but it is
intended ultimately to have models of
practically all the company’s Standard
Homes and a full range of display of
various other building materials, such
as Joinery, Parquetry Flooring, Wall'
boards, Floor Tiles, etc.
The Official Opening.
The State Minister for Housing,
The Hon. Clive Evatt, M.L.A., in de-
daring the premises officially open,
said the firm had played a big part
in Australian history, and had been

in existence for something like 100
years; apart from the fact that it is
a commercial enterprise, there is no
better work than the work of pro-
viding homes for the citizens of our
community.
The firm of Hudson’s, said Mr.
Evatt, has contributed in the post-war
period no less than 6000 homes, and
“I say the Government is very proud
of what you have done. When we
have solved the problem of housing
we will have a happy and contented
nation.”
Finance for Home
Building.
Speaking of the Federal Govern-
ment’s financial policy, Mr. Evatt said:
“We must have a financial policy for
home-building; it has got to be done:
no other financial matter is more im-
portant; we must have confidence, and
credit is confidence; if we believe in
our land and have confidence in
Australia, there must be credit; that
is the way to make Australia strong.”
Mr. Evatt said he was amazed and
impressed when reading details of the
Company’s Retiring Fund, and one
thing that stood out was that 51
members have been with the firm for
over 25 years. The sum of £104,000
has been contributed by the company
since the inception of the Fund in
1945. which is an indication that the

George Hudson
Ply. Ltd.
HISTORY OF THE
FIRM’S DEVELOPMENT.
1850 1953.
The present company of George
Hudson Pty. Ltd. had its origins in
the firm of Hudson Brothers, which
commenced operations in the 1850’s.
This firm of Hudson Bros, were car'
riage builders in a large way and were
contractors to the N.S.W. Government
in respect of considerable quantities
of rolling stock used in the early rail'
ways of the State. The firm also
operated timber mills and retail yards.
Subsequently the undertaking was
divided, the elder brothers continued
the carriage'building section which
eventually became the company now
known as Clyde Engineering Co. Ltd.
—whilst the youngest brother, George
Hudson, took over the timber section
of the business, which for many years
was conducted at Redfern in the
vicinty of what is now the Redfern
Railway Station. It is known that in
the early days the firm had logging
operations and sawmills in the Galston
area and also at Bulladelah on the
Myall Lakes.

Company Formed
in 1909.
In 1904 the business was floated
into a company known as George
Hudson 6? Son Ltd., with an autho'
rised capital of £10,000, and at the
beginning of 1909 acquired the in'
terests of the Kauri Timber Co. Ltd.
at Blackwattle Bay, Glebe, to which
site the company’s operations were
subsequently transferred. At this time
the company was under the control of
George William, the eldest son of
the original George Hudson. The
acquisition of the Kauri Timber Co.
Ltd. may be regarded as the starting
point of the very considerable expan'
sion which subsequently took place.
Mr. George William Hudson died in
1929, and his brother, Mr. Harold
Stanley Hudson, became Managing
Director, and consolidated the business
during the depression years, which all
recognise as having been a very dif'
ficult period.
Mr. Harold S. Hudson died in
1948, when Mr. Charles H. Hando
was appointed Managing Director.
Mr. Hando has been connected with
the company since 1909. During the
early years of this period he was con'
nected with the erection of Ready'
cut Homes, and in the establishment
of the Parquetry Flooring section of
the business.
The company has always been
pioneers in the Industry and were the
first to commence Ready-cut cottages.
Parquetry Floors and the manufacture
of dowel doors. Apart from the re-
tail business and manufacturing opera'
tions, the company has been an im-
porter of overseas timbers on a very
large scale.
Post-war Expansion.
Since the war, the business has con'
tinued to expand, as since 1945 over
6000 homes have been supplied
through its Ready'CUC Department.
This, of course, is in addition to the
very considerable quantities of timber,
etc., supplied for general building
activities.
Owing to increased activities in the
Ready-cut Department it was found
that the accommodation which had
been occupied at 7 Castlereagh Street
for thirty years was inadequate,
tremendous congestion arising through
the interviewing of many thousands of
enquirers each year. In 1950 the
company acquired premises at 219
Elizabeth Street, Sydney. After pro'
tracted litigation an order for posses'
sion of the premises was obtained,
and in January, 1953, commencement
was made on extensive remodelling to
meet the requirements of the company.
Whilst the Court had granted an order
for the possession of the whole of the
building, in view of the delay that
would have been involved in further
litigation the company has taken pos'
session of only two floors.
In 1946 the company acquired the
whole of the paid'up capital of Joseph
Reid Pty. Ltd., Sawmillers, of South
Grafton, and thus became actively en-
gaged in the Hardwood Sawmilling
Industry, being the owners of three
mills in the Grafton area and a very

extensive retail business in South
Grafton.
The company has always taken an
interest in the welfare of its employees
and during 1945 inaugurated an Em'
ployees’ Retiring Fund. This Fund is
on a non'contributory basis and since
its inception the company has con'
tributed £104,971 to the Fund. At
the present time there are 170 mem'
bers. The sum of £B5OO has been
paid out to the dependants of de'
ceased members and to employees who
have reached the retiring age. The
Trustees of the Employees’ Retiring
Fund have been able to make avail'
able finance for a considerable number
of employees to acquire their own
homes.
At the present time the company
and its subsidiaries employ 550 hands,
and it is interesting to note that since
1949 51 badges have been presented
to employees who have completed 25
years’ service with the company.
The company has remained in the
hands of the family of the founder,
four of whom are members of the
present Board of Directors.

Knox College
Memorial Building
Governor Unveils Tablet.
The State Governor, Sir John
Northcott, recently unveiled the com'
memorativc tablet of the new War
Memorial block now under construe'
tion at Knox Grammar School, War'
rawee.
The large new buildings, now in
the course of erection in Pacific High'
way, are being built by McDonald
Constructions Pty. Ltd., Mascot.
Two Blocks.
The additions consist of a science
block containing, on the upper floor,
new physics and chemistry laborator'
ies. On the ground floor provision
is being made for new change rooms,
tuck shop, cloak room, masters’
rooms and several sound'proof music
rooms.
This block comprises the War
Memorial building which is being
erected by the contributions of old
boys, parents and friends. The com'
memorative tablet forms part of this
block.
The second block, to be known as
the John Williams Memorial Assembly
Hall and Library, is the gift of Mr.
E. R. Williams, in memory of his
son John, a Knox old boy who was
killed in World War 11.
Tower a Feature.
This hall will have a seating ac'
commodation of 1000, and is being
equipped with the latest sound sys'
tern. The Hall will be approached by
a promenade terrace running the full
length of the building.
The architect, Mr. Ruskin Rowe,
has designed the Hall to give a Scot'
tish atmosphere and a special tower
will be a feature of the building.
The new buildings will face Pacific
Highway and will completely change
the present aspect of the college as
seen by passers'by. The frontage to
the Highway has been resumed by the
Main Roads Department in order to
widen the roadway, and this work is
now in hand.
To widen the road an old paling
fence was removed, and will be re'
placed by a new fence, partly of stone
and partly of timber. The stone sec'
don will provide for wrought iron
memorial gates and will enclose the
memorial quadrangle between the new
buildings.
Italian Style Architecture In Marrickville
Church
135 ft. BELL TOWER WILL COMPLETE PROJECT.
St. Brigid’s R.C. Church, Marrick'
ville, which is administered by the
Passionist Fathers, was commenced in
1918, and is now in the process of
completion to the designs and under
the supervision of Louis P. Burns
and Thomas M. Maloney, architects,
of Sydney.
This project involves the erection
of a bell tower (see architect’s sketch)
which will rise 135 feet from the
pavement to the top of the surmount'
ing cross, a narthex, baptistry, and
western porch.
A wide piazza across the western
facade is reached by a flight of steps
and the Italian style of architecture
has been adopted.
The colour and texture of the ma-
terials have been carefully studied and
the architects have selected a certain
amount of glass mosaic for the wall
and ceiling treatment of the Baptistry,
and vaulted western arcade.
New Shrine.
It is of additional significance that
the treatment of a new shrine within
the existing church will finish an ap'
propriate setting for a reproduction
of an Italian marble statue by Michael
Angelo. A niche has also been im
corporated in the western facade of
the tower to contain a more'thandife'
size statue of St. Brigid, patron saint
of the church.
Balanced Composition.
When the work is completed the
architectural result will be a balanced
composition, with the tower furnish'
ing the vertical accent, and which will
tie together the mass of the Church
proper and the large monastery.
The whole group has a delightful
garden setting. Working drawings are
now in the process of completion, and
then tenders will be called for the con'
struction of the additional works, in'
eluding the bell tower.
Working drawings will shortly be completed and tenders called for the erection
of a bell tower and additions to St. Brigid’s R.C. Church, Marrickville. Louis P.
Burns and Thomas M. Maloney, architects.
