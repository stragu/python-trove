FIRE
PROTECTION
Grinnell protects lives—
thousands of feet underground
GRINNELL PROTECTS LIVES AT SEA. TOO
SINCE
1889
“THE RIGHT PROTECTION
FOR EVERY FIRE RISK’’
Grinnell does its job in the main drives, shafts, both sloping and
vertical, in some of the largest mines in Australia, South Africa,
Canada and other mining countries.
Grinnell automatic sprinklers protect the timberwork against am
outbreak of fire. These drives*and shafts are highways to dozens
of workings—a fire in am one of them could cause collapse and
maybe the imprisonment of a number of men. But the instant
a fire breaks out the Grinnell Sprinkler directly above the blaze
would open, drenching and extinguishing the fire. Throughout
Australia, Grinnell protects stores, churches, schools, offices,
libraries, farms, all types of fire risks great and small, all day,
all night, all year round. Let Grinnell protect your building, too.
The GRINNELL Automatic Sprinkler
and Fire Alarm Systems
are a product of WORMALD BROTHERS INDUSTRIES

★ FOR WALL AND CEILING BEAUTY
p
./
See how
recessed edge joint treatment
gives a smooth surface
Gyprock cement is "buttered"
into the channel formed by the
recessed edges of the boards.
Next comes reinforcing tape.
It is centred over the chan-
nel, pressed into place.
Then the surface is
smoothed and edges
feathered out.
There you see demonstrated the all-important PLUS
in Gyprock dry wall construction. Special tape and
“filler” are used to bring Gyprock panels together
into one continuous wall Or ceiling in effect, a
single smooth surface. These surfaces stay smooth,
too, because joints formed by this method are as
strong as the board itself.

Another important plus— Gyp-
rock is unaffected by temperature
changes. Will not warp, shrink
or swell. Will not decay or
deteriorate. Also its mineral core
is resistant to borers and white
ants. And besides permanent
beauty, Gyprock offers your
client the priceless bonus of
FIRE PROTECTION! Fire insurance
costs less when you build with
Gyprock. That’s mighty important for
any building to be used by the
public, as well as for homes.

FIX
YOUR CONCRETE FORMS
with
ci.ijiiirinVßSi
Made by the Pioneers of better formwork,
Williams Form Hardware permits the easy
fixing and stripping of forms, whether
light or heavy, timber or steel. Forms are
held exactly to line with Williams Clamps
and High Tensile Tie Rods, having a work-
ing load more than 3 times that of equal
diameter mild steel rods. Great economy
in cost Is thus effected.
Used for over 20 years by major construction
• groups in the U.S.A, now used in Australia
by the following authorities: Sydney Water Board,
Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission of
N.S.W., N.S.W. Department of Railways, Metropolitan
Board of Works, Melbourne, Queensland Irrigation
Commission, Queensland Main Roads Board, State
Electricity Commissions, and by contractors in all
States.
A substantial saving is possible on the cost
* of vertical formwork, because of the reduction
in labour employed in fixing and stripping.
Forms are tied and spaced EXTERNALLY by
** * half-driving a nail into the stud, through the
cross-drilled hole in the She-bolt. This permits taster
forming and re-use of the removable clamps without
waiting for the forms to be stripped.
y| A tie-rod may- be used from I" to 7" less
• than the wall width. Stocks need therefore be
carried in multiples of 3", rather than every fractional
inch, as is required by any internal spacing clamp.
Williams Clamps are locked against any
tendency to loosen under vibration.
Vlbra-lock clamp
eliminates spanners:
Fast adjustment with
balanced wing nut.
High tensile crimped rod
forms a watertight tie with
freedom from surface rust stains.
Nail in stud spaces form
externally.
Reversible water supporv
bracket saves toe-nalline
of walings to studs.
The illustration above shows typical application to wall forms
with faces either vertical or battered.
Holes in Vibra-Lock
Brocket are conven-
ient for nailing to
forms, if desired.

ROWCO JAeiedceKt' FITTINGS
CUT INDUSTRIAL LIGHTING COST
In good lighting first costs are not the real costs!
Real costs are first costs plus installation, operation and maintenance
expenses for the entire life of the system.
With the ROWCO SV/IND/240 “V” Industrial Twin 40 fitting you
will frequently find that fewer units are needed, this means first
costs are lower, but the really big saving comes in lower electricity
consumption and lower maintenance figures.
The ROWCO SV/iND/240 has brought high praise from plant en-
gineers because of its greatly increased vertical light output and
fewer maintenance problems.
Suitable for flush or suspension mounting.
ROWCO lighting engineers are just as near as the telephone and through-
out Australia offer engineered lighting , not just fixtures.

BIG BRIDGES ARE BIG BUSINESS
AMERICANS MAKE THEM PAY.
As Sydney expands more and more
each year, the problem of linking the
two sides of the Harbour becomes
more acute.
Although this necessity has been
apparent for some time, as each
month more and more motor vehicles
are loaded on to the overtaxed road
system and conglomerate morning
and evening at the Bridge toll bottle-
neck, it has only been during the past
few weeks that the subject has again
hit the public headlines.
This has mainly been the result of
the advocacy of a tunnel under the
Harbour by a Sydney member of
Parliament.
The mention of a tunnel was, of
course, the cue for the anti-tunnel
advocates to open up their artillery
in favour of a bridge, and so the age-
old controversy, which had been so
keen prior to the construction of the
Harbour Bridge, was once again
started off.
In our last issue we published an
article dealing with a number of pros
and cons in the Bridge-Tunnel argu-
ment. If we look to one of the great'
est cities in the world and one in
which the density of traffic is prob'
ably the highest, we find that both
these methods are extensively used,
for New York has a number of great
bridges spanning both the Hudson
and the East Rivers and at the same
time has driven a number of traffic
tunnels beneath these waterways.
These New York bridges and tun'
nels are not only first-class engineer-
ing structures, but in the hands of skip
ful administration have become excel-
lent commercial propositions as well
and pay handsome profits.
Thus we find that the Triborough
Bridge and Tunnel Authority made a
profit of j£A. 1 1,291,335, for the year
ending December 31, 1952, which
are the latest available. Figures from
the 1954 Year Book gave the follow-
ing details:—
Vehicular Traffic in 1952.
Triborough 35,504,074
Bronx-Whitestone 19,698,172

of 29,278,695.37 dollars and, after
deducting 14% for upkeep from the
revenue, it leaves 25,179,678 dollars,
equalling an income of jEA.I 1,291,335.
With something under one-fifth
of New York’s population, we could
build one every five years if we made
such profits.
The profits from transport in New
York are pretty progressive, the 1952
figures being slightly up on the 1951
figures, which were: —
Triborough 32,587,435
Bronx-Whitestone 19,698,172
Henry Hudson 21,060,348

For twelve months ending Decern'
ber 31, 1951, the Authority reported
an income of 27,029,479 dollars
(jEA.12,120,842), an increase of
25.7% over the preceding year. Cost
of operation averaged 14% of re'

The bridge, the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge, spans the Hud son River in New York State. At present under construction, it
will have a total length of 7800 ft., comprising continuous truss span of 5200ft. It is scheduled for completion by 1956.

THE MESSINA STRAITS BRIDGE, TO LINK ITALY AND SICILY.
The world-famous bridge designer Dr. D. B. Steinman has produced a scheme for spanning the Messina Straits between
Italy and Sicily. This graceful structure is a combined railway and highway bridge, and is especially designed to
resist aerodynamic and earthquake forces. The total length of the bridge will be two miles, and it will have the
world’s greatest suspension span, 5000 feet, each side span being 2400 feet. Estimated cost, 150,000,000 dollars.

used the facilities.
These are large sums of money to
accrue from transport for one
Authority alone, after building eight
bridges and tunnels, some of gigantic
dimensions.
Then there is the New York City
Transit System, controlling all the
other tunnels, bridges and roads, wii.h

In 1953, this City Transit System
faced mounting deficits in operation
in excess of available revenue. On
May 26, 1953, the State Legislature
created the five-member New York
Transit Authority, with power to
impose increases in taxes or fares—
the latter at 15 cents. This would
entail altering all the turnstile coin'
boxes and the striking of possibly
50.000. tokens for passengers
using the coin-boxes. This is the
only way of paying fares as one
enters the vehicle or the underground.
1.500.000. people use New York’s
rapid transit systems a year (under-
ground), 500,000,000 use its surface
systems totalling 2,000,000,000 a
year. 775,000,000 use trolley and
bus lines.
There are, all told, 250,000 bridges
in the U.S.A., besides over 200,000
culverts on the 3,000,000 miles of
roads and highways.
There are, in all, 400 toll bridges,
including 200 privately'owned bridges.
There are nine bridges over the
Mississippi within 15 miles along the
riverbank between the twin city of
Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Pittsburgh (population, 2,200,000)
has 18 highway bridges and nine rail'
road bridges spanning the Allegheny
and Monongahela Rivers.
Chicago, a city twice the size of
Sydney in terms of population
(3,620,962 in 1950, or 5,500,000 if
the five metropolitan areas are con'
sidered), has 100 bridges. They have
built bridges so that each street will
not have traffic held up to cross the
river, but go straight over it without
delay. We hold our traffic up at each
street intersection in our city. Such a
thing as a bridge is unthinkable.
It is only engineering and financial
brains of the first quality that are
capable of achieving these results.
We have them, but they are not
given an opportunity to exercise their
skill. Instead we find municipal
gentlemen, the majority of whom have
no specialist training whatsoever in
these spheres, touring the world to
‘ study” traffic and parking problems.
What is required in Sydney is that its
traffic problems should be examined
by the best engineering brains avail'
able and their findings implemented
promptly.
Dr. J. J. C. Bradfield was such an
expert and, although criticised as
being grandiose and ahead of his
time in many of his ideas, we are
now reaping the benefit of his skill
and foresight. But in a growing city
like Sydney, the traffic and transport
needs are never static. They should
be constantly under expert review and
new developmental schemes contimi'
ously being planned and implemented.
ON OUR COVER.
THE MOUNT HOPE BRIDGE,
RHODE ISLAND, U.S.A.
This suspension span over Narragansett
Bay, between Providence and Newport,
which is the largest bridge in New Eng-
land, was built "to take the island out
of Rhode Island." It has a main span
of 1200 ft., and with its flanking spans
bridges a water gap of 3000 ft. Includ-
ing the viaduct approaches, the total
length is 6130 ft. A prior design, of the
cantilever type, prepared by a State
commission, was officially estimated to
cost 6,000,000 dollars. The structure as
built, of advanced suspension design,
cost 2,500,000 doHars. The thought and
planning that went into creating a
beautiful span in a beautiful landscaped
setting were rewarded when the Mount
Hope Bridge received the 1929 Artistic
Bridge Award of the American Institute
of Steel ConstruHion as the most
beautiful long-span bridge of the year.
SHELL CHEMICAL COMPANY.
Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty.
Ltd. was registered in Victoria to pro'
duce and sell chemicals mainly derived
from oil. It is a subsidiary of Shell
Petroleum Company Limited, London.
With Australia’s expanding primary
and secondary industrial requirements,
and the availability from Shell’s new
Geelong Refinery of the selected
1 quids and gases required for chemi'
cals production, components will be
produced from the “cat'cracker” com'
plex now under construction and due
to operate in late 1955.

Successful Year Forecast For Federation
48th ANNUAL CONVENTION CONCLUDES AT HOBART
CONFERENCE MAKES FAR-REACHING DECISIONS.
(From Our Special Convention Reporter.)
Hobart, Friday, November 12.
The 48th Annual Convention of the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia concluded here this afternoon.
It was the first time in 27 years that the Annual Convention had been held
in Tasmania.
Nearly 150 delegates and visitors from other States are attending the
Convention, the 48th to be held by the long-established Federation, which
is also the oldest Employers’ Organisation in Australia.
The following Federal Executive was elected for 1954 - 55:
President, G. H. Day (Q.); Senior Vice-president, S. D. C. Kennedy
(N.S.W.); Junior Vice-president, R. S. Nurse (S.A.); Immediate Past-president.
T. M. Lipscombe (Tas.); Hon. Treasurer, W. Fairweather (W.A.); Hon. Asst.
Treasurer, C. J. McDougall (Vic.); Secretary, T. J. Cavanagh (N.S.W.).
The following members of Affiliated Associations were appointed Delegates
to the Federation:
Messrs. A. E. Ebeling (Q.), S. O. Edwards (N.S.W.), C. K. Orrett
(Newcastle). J. E. Simmie (Vic.), G. H. Fricker (SA.), L. Lilleyman (W.A.),
O. Moore (Tas.), F. J. Watters (A.C.T.).
The 1955 Convention will be held in Brisbane at the end of September or
early in October next year.
The Convention, at the Wrest Point Hotel, Hobart, was officially opened
by the Premier of Tasmania, the Hon. Robert Cosgrove, M.H.A. Delegates
and visitors were later tendered a Civic Reception by the Lord Mayor of
Hobart, Aid. R. A. Park, M.H.A.
Official delegates were:—
N.S.W.; Messrs. K. C. McGregor,
W. J. Bryant, S. O. Edwards, P.
Bottomley, and W. D. Ford (Secre'
tary).
South Australia: Messrs. H.
Wilckens, F. Brimblecombe, G. H.
Fricker, M. C. Wood, B. Galloway
(Secretary).
Queensland: Messrs. C. P. Hornick,
J. A. Dredge, A. Corbett, A. E.
Ebeling, J. H. Woodward (Secretary).
Victoria: Messrs. W. R. Longmuir,
T. W. Morris, L. L. Cockram, C, J.
McDougall, E. S. Elliott (Executive
Director).
Tasmania: Messrs. T. G. Neave, C.
K. Gillham, G. Box, S. Dowling, J. E.
Braithwaite (Secretary).
Western Australia: Messrs. W. L.

burn (Secretary).
Newcastle: Messrs. F. E. Anderson,
F. H. Compton.
Canberra: Messrs. F. J. Watters, J.
E. Simmie.
Past Presidents of the Federation
were in attendance as ex'officio
delegates.
The weekdong Convention includ'
ed a series of business meetings,
social events, and a number of excur'
sions, sightseeing tours, and cruises.
The comprehensive entertainment
programme ended with a Ball at
Hobart Town Hall on Friday, Novem'
ber 12.
Official Opening.
In introducing the Premier of Tas'
mania, the Hon. Robert Cosgrove,
the President, Mr. T. M.
Lipscombe, paid a tribute to the Pre'
mier’s outstanding qualities. He said
that in Tasmania the Premier did not
need introduction. He was so well
known and so widely respected by
one and all that such introductions
were superfluous.
However, with delegates present
from all States, it was a great pleasure
to present Tasmania’s Premier to
leaders of the building industry.
(Applause.)
Mr. Lipscombe added that Mr.
Cosgrove had been responsible for a
great deal of Government construe'
tion during his years of office-
schools, hospitals, and Government
buildings throughout Tasmania.
In thanking Mr. Lipscombe for the
sincerity of his remarks, Mr. Cos'
grove said he was delighted to web
come the Master Builders to Tas'
mania.
“Many people think Tasmania is a
very small Island State, and that very
little is going on in it.
“To the contrary, very much is
going on here, in industrial, commer'
cial and domestic building.
“This morning I have opened a
conference of parents and friends.
Their problem is getting schools. I
think it is appropriate that I am open'
ing your Convention, for you are the
men who can build those schools,”
Mr. Cosgrove said.
He refexred to the question of
availability of building materials, and
enjoined the builders to ensure some
continuity of supplies. He hoped
that the Convention would be able to
overcome existing problems, for
shortage of materials puts up construe'
tion costs.
Mr. Cosgrove said his Government
regarded building as a vital industry,
and his Cabinet had done consider'
able Government building. But t|iat
tyne of building formed only a snjall
proportion of construe'ion carried
out in Tasmania, where tn% emphasis
was on home'building.
“The erection of homes is a very
important activity. We must make
people contented by providing them
with decent homes.” (Applause.)
“We have tried to build comfort'

able homes for our citizens,” Mr.
Cosgrove continued.
“We sell lots of these homes with-
out any deposit, and we hope that
eventually all tenants will own their
own homes.
‘“The weekly payments include the
local rates, by agreement with muni-
cipalities and councils.”
Prospects Bright.
Mr. Cosgrove said he felt that the
future prospects of the building in-
dustry were “very bright.”
“Growing communities in every
State would ensure that, but there
must not be any slackening in home-
building.
“We must keep the building in-
dustry active and thus assist other in-
dustries to build up accordingly.
“I am sure the overall prospects for
your industry have never been
brighter,” Mr. Cosgrove declared.
He concluded by voicing his hopes
that the Convention would be a very
useful one for all concerned.
“The meeting together of delegates
from different parts of Australia is for
the benefit of all.
The good - fellowship thus en-
gendered will be of mutual advantage
to all members of Australia’s build-
ing industry, and will be carried into
the future,” Mr. Cosgrove added.
Civic Welcome.
At mid-day, delegates were received
by the Lord Mayor of Hobart, Aid.
R, A. Park, M.H.A., who praised
the building industry for its past
magnificent achievement. He was
optimistic regarding the future of
building in Australia. The builders of
Australia have left their mark on the
nation, he said.
“Importantly, you are building
goodwill and good-fellowship, which
are all-important in your industry.
We need your help in achieving
homes for the people,” the Lord
Mayor added.
Supporting the Lord Mayor,
Brigadier H. Strutt, M.H.A., referred
to the important part the building in-
dusry plays in the economy of the
nation.
“You are doing a big job—keep it
up,” he added.
Deceased Members.
Prior to the commencement of the
Convention, all present stood in
silence in tribute to the memory of
two Federation members who passed
away this year—Mr. E. A. Allwood
(W.A.) and Mr. D. R. Tate (Tas.).
Presidential Address.
In his Presidential Address, the
Federal President, Mr. T. M. Lip-
scombe (Tas.) said:—
Gentlemen, —It gives me pleasure
to present to you, this, the 48th Presi-
dential address. Your Federation has
been in existence for the past 64
years, and during that time its mem-
bers have seen the changing fortunes
of our island continent fluctuate from
devastating slumps to great boom
periods.
You will have an opportunity at a
later stage of this Convention of dis-
cussing the past year’s work of the
Federation, which is reported fully in
your Executive's Report.
During the year I have given a lot
of thought to your Federation’s
affairs, and have tried to find ways
and means of improving the present
organisation to make it worthy of
the industry it represents: an industry,
gentlemen, that carried out work to
the value of £340,000,000 during the
last financial year. In an endeavour to
get a picture of the functions of this
organisation I turned to the records
of previous Conventions, but found
in general that the discussions had
been very similar over the years.
One of the first functions of the
Federation was to endeavour to obtain
satisfactory Contract Documents, and
in this work it has been successful, but
it is still amending and adding to the
documents. The next discussions
centred around Arbitration and Con-
ciliation, and during the earliest dis-
cussions your members considered
they were faced with ruin should the
artisan receive increased wages or
better conditions. Your members at
that time and through the years ad-
vocated that all industrial matters be
handled by the States, because by so
doing a better control would be ac-
complished; but have we obtained
that control? I fear not! !
The next main worry was the con-
struction of Government works by day
labour, and it was said at that time
that no country could survive if day
labour was allowed to develop. Other
problems were the variations and con-
ditions between the several States, and,
in some instances, even between sec-
tions of the one State.
To sum up, the broad activities of
the Federation to the present time
have centred around —
(a) Conditions of Contract;
(b) Arbitration and Conciliation
carried out by States, and
(c) Day Labour versus Contract.
Some ten years after this Federa-
tion was formed, the people ol Aus-
tralia decided to form a Federation of
the several States, and so our Com-
monwealth of Australia was born.
Now, the people of Australia in their
wisdom decided that if a Federation
was to work, it had to have very defi-
nite powers, especially in time of war,
and I think you will agree that that
decision was well founded and our
Commonwealth has gone on from
strength to strength.
Let us look at our own Federation
and we will find that it is only a
very loosely knit organisation with
the States doing the actual organising
work. State by State.
I put it to you gentlemen, if it is
necessary for Australia, as a Common-
wealth, to have a strong Federal
Organisation it is equally necessary
for this organisation to have a strong
Federal organisation.
We will look at the industry as in-
dividuals first. Most of us are men
wno have made our way in life by our
own organising ability and determina-
tion; many oT us have not had the
business training that high executives
in other industries receive, because
most industries approaching the size
of ours are made up of large firms
who can afford to keep training young
men to fill the executive positions as
required, whereas our industry is com-
posed of thousands of various sized
firms. Our industrv, fortunately, is
still completely democratic, and there-
fore any man who has the ability may
control his own business.
Continued overleaf.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING
November 24, 1954.


This state of affairs, while very de-
sirable and a bulwark to our present
way of life, has many advantages, and
one of the main ones is that we are
prone to look firstly at our business,
and secondly at our own State, and
neglect very of.en, through lack of
time, to have an overall picture of
the industry as a whole.
This viewpoint of the individuals of
the industry has gone on ever since
builders have been building, and con-
sequently the industry is suffering
severe handicaps. You are aware, no
doubt, by observing other organisa-
tion’s activities what public relations
mean to any industry, organisation or
cause. Take, for example, your Com-
monwealth Loan market. Some years
ago, through faulty handling of the
Bond market. Commonwealth securi'
ties fell into disfavour, and it was
necessary to launch a campaign to win
back public support, which is in fact,
public opinion. You know how the
various political parties are constantly
striving to improve public relations.
Your industry, gentlemen, as I said
earlier, is of the order of £34,000,000
per year, and I don’t think any in-
dustry of this size can afford not to
have good public relations.
Every year you pay an insurance
premium to safeguard your workmen,
and cover your buildings, plant and
machinery against loss. Now. have
you ever assessed your loss through
the lack of organisation in your in-
dustry with its attendant faults?
From time to time we have dis-
cussed finance to strengthen this
Federation, but every time it is dis-
cussed it is viewed from a State basis
instead of from a per capita or in-
dividual basis.
I submit that if every member was
prepared to pay to the Federation £5
per year, it would be sufficient o set
up a Secretariat capable of assisting
all the States with Arbitration dealing
with the Commonwealth Government
on matters concerning construction of
all sorts and building up public rela-
lions with the building public.
Let me say here that the present
Secretary should be retained in a
part-time capacity to assist whoever is
selected for the major job of organisa-
tion, because with his wealth of
knowledge of the industry his assis-
tance would be invaluable.
If we are prepared to take from
the industry, we must be prepared to
return a proportion to it. Should you
crop soil continuously without fer-
tiliser, vpu will finish up with a
desert. If you allow your industry to
continue as a disorganised rabble, you
will find somebody else taking it over.
I have not put forward these thoughts
with the idea of a completely reor-
ganised Federation next year, but I do
feel that it is very necessary for a
progressive policy to be adopted if the
industry, as we know it, is to survive.
During the year I have visited four
States and New Zealand and have
talked with our members in those
States, but was unable to give the
service necessary for industry to pro-
gress.
I know there are many interstate
difficulties to be overcome, but these
will fade away when an organisation
capable of helping the several States
is in operation. It must be borne in
mind that we are a fast changing
world. Many of us joined the indus-
try before concrete mixers were used
on the job, and now we are leaving
that great invention behind to buy
from the central mixing plants to
keep up with the march of progress.
Therefore, we must adjust our Federa-
tion to the changing times and
strengthen it to meet the Union
strength, the Socialist Government
strength, and other forces who are not
in agreement with private enterprise.
The friendships built up between
members in the different States over
the years by this Federation have been
a major achievement.
I would like to take this oppor-
tunity of thanking the Executive and
our members for their assistance and
courtesies during the year, and our
Secretary, Mr. T. I. Cavanagh, who
has done everything possible to make
my year a success.
I trust your stay in our island
will be enjoyable if, perhaps, a little
different to the great cities of the
other States.
I leave this thought with you,
gentlemen—lf we are able to go out
of this industry leaving it a little bet'
ter than when we joined it, our
labours will not have been in vain.
Report of Executive.
In presenting the Report of the
Federal Executive, the President,
Mr. T. M. Lipscombe, said:
“Since the last Annual Convention,
your Executive has had two official
meetings and one unofficial meeting,
the latter to deal with certain indus-
trial matters in collaboration with
four of. the Federation’s affiliated
Associations. Additionally, your Exe-
cutive met the Council of the R.A.I.A.
and discussed a number of matters of
mutual interest.”
Finance.
“The Hon. Treasurer will deal
later with the financial position of the
Federation. You will agree that it is
a satisfactory one if viewed in the
light of the Federation’s present con-
stitution. If, however, any conddera-
tion is to be given to the expans : on
of the Federation, it is obvious that
contributions from affiliated Associa-
tions will have to be made on a
larger scale.”
Taxation.
The Report dealt at length with the
liability of the Federation to taxation
on the income derived from its invest'
ments, and contained a number of
suggestions for the future.
Federal Building Prize and
George A. Taylor Prize.
Continuing, the Report said;
“Your Executive, pursuant to a
resolution carried at the last Conven-
tion, gave consideration to the posh
tion of the George A. Taylor
Memorial Prize, and is now able to
report that Mrs. Florence M. Taylor,
0.8. E., widow of the late George A.
Taylor, has graciously consented to
the capital amount of the George
A. Taylor Memorial Prize being in'
corporated in the Federal Building
Construction Prize Account, on the
understanding that the Federation will
undertake to continue the award of
the George A. Taylor Memorial
Medal to the winner of the Federal
Building Construction Prize.
“No action was taken during the
year to effect the amalgamation of the
two Prize Funds, but this will be done
during 1954-55.
“The Federal Building Construction
Prize and the George A. Taylor
Memorial Prize for 195 3 was won by
Mr. J. F. McKern, of Victoria, and
the presentation of it was made to
him at a meeting of the M.B.A. of
Victoria.
“The Federation extends its con-
gratulations to Mr. McKern.
“Your Executive believes that some
comment upon the examination of
the prize papers is warranted. Last
year, and the year before also, there
was a considerable time lag between
the holding of the examination and
the awarding of the prize. This, your
Executive believes, tends to kill inter'
est in the competition among pros'
pective competitors, and therefore
recommends that action be taken to
ensure that the time lag is reduced
considerably, even to the extent of
setting dates for the forwarding of
the names of State prize winners to
the Federation under penalty of dis'
qualification for non-compliance .
“Certain comment has been put
forward by one Association on the
conduct of the prize generally, and
this will be considered during the
Convention.”
Conditions of Contract.
“Among matters discussed by your
Executive with the Council of the
R.A.I.A. was that on Conditions of
Contract, pursuant to resolutions car-
ried at the last Convention.
“The R.A.I.A. Council agreed in
principle with the suggesion put for-
ward by the Federation with regard
to payment to nominated cub'

contractors and to notify local
Chapters of the Institute to agree to
alter the contract document accord'
ingly.
“The Federation’s suggestions re'
lated to amendment of Clauses 15
(a) and 21 (1) (b), and have been
circulated to affiliated Associations.
“Several other matters relating to
Conditions of Contract were dis'
cussed, and it was agreed by both
bodies thit the continual alteration of
the Conditions was not sound. How'
ever, it was agreed that a joint con'
ference of two members of each
organisation and the respective orga'
nisation secretaries should be held,
with a view to reviewing all suggest'
ed amendments, so that any projected
alterations to the Conditions can be
undertaken at the one time.
“It was originally suggested that
such a conference should be held in
October, 1954, but as neither the
Federation nor the R.A.I.A. had re'
ceived any comment from their
affiliated bodies, it was decided that
such a conference should be post'
poned until the bodies concerned had
an opportunity of forwarding recom'
mendations for consideration. This
matter will be discussed during the
Convention.”
Rise and Fall Clause.
“The operation of the Rise and
Fall Clause has been a contentious
matter during the past twelve months
owing to a measure of instability in
regard to prices having crept into the
industry.
“Your Executive believes that %'e
abolition of the Rise and Fall Clause
as soon as practicable would find
favour, but the industry has not yet
reached the degree of stability which
would make it safe for the Federa-
tion to agree to the abolition of such
a Clause at this stage.
“However, your Executive did
accept an agreement from the R.A.I.A.
that it would recommend to its mem*
bers that contracts having a duration
of longer than twelve months should
contain Rise and Fall, provisions
although since then the position in
regard to the stability of the cost
structure has deteriorated, and the
matter will come forward again for
discussion at this Convention with a
view to a recommendation being
made to affiliated Associations.”
Quantities.
Dealing with the question of
Quantities, the Report says:
“Generally, the agreement reached
with the R.A.I.A. with regard to
Quantities has, your Executive be-
lieves, worked satisfactorily, in that
the Institute has recommended to its
members that they provide Quantities
in terms of the agreement which, for
the benefit of members of affiliated
Associations, is set out hereunder:
“That the R.A.1.A., whilst agree'
ing with the Federation that the Insti'
tute cannot bind any of its members’
clients in advance to provide Quanta
ties, nevertheless agrees jointly with
the Federation to recommend to
members and clients that in their own
interests and in equity to the builder
Quantities be provided on the follow'
ing basis:
“(1) For all residential work costing
more than £IO,OOO and for
which competitive tenders are
publicly invited, Quantities shall
be provided.
“(2) For all residential work costing
less than £15,000 and for which
not more than six tenders are
privately obtained, Quantities
shall not be required.
“(3) For all other work costing more
than £12,000 and for which
competitive tenders are publicly
invited, Quantities shall be
provided..
“(4) For all other work costing less
than £20,000 and for which not
more than four tenders are pri'
vately obtained. Quantities shall
not be required.
“(5) In cases in which the work is of

Quantities are not necessary,

the President of the M.B.A. of

“Whilst the Institute has honoured
its agreement in making this known
to its members, no doubt delegates
will bring forward instances of diffi'
culties in regard to Quantities experi'
enced in their own respective States.
An example of such a difficulty which
may be quoted came from Newcastle,

and in this connection a letter written
by the Federation to the R.A.I.A. re-
ceived general approbation in New-
castle and on that account and because
it enunciates the Federation’s policy
in the matter, might reasonably be
quoted:
“ ‘The Federation cannot subscribe
to your interpretation of the agree-
ment reached between the Federation
and your Institute in regard to the
provision of Quantities. We assume
that you refer to the agreement
reached at the Canberra joint confer-
ence. The Federation agrees with
your contention that an architect
normally cannot commit an unknown
third party to an agreement with an-
other party; but we believe, and we
take it that your Institute was in
agreement with us in the matter, that
both the Federation and your Institute
had certain responsibilities in offering
advice and guidance as to the correct
procedure that should be followed in
the negotiation of a building contract,
and we assume that your Institute
agrees to advise its clients in terms
of the Quantity agreement reached
by us. If clients, however.. refuse to
accept the advice of our joint bodies,
we believe that members of the Fede-
ration’s affiliated Associations should
be permitted to reserve the right to
determine their own course of action.
“ ‘ln our Quantities agreement
there is at least an implied suggestion
that in the event of circumstances
warranting it, the local Institute of
Architects and the local M.B.A.
should meet with a view to ironing
out local difficulties. In these matters
the Federation is not in a posi ion to
bind its affiliated Associations.’ ”
War Service Homes.
During the year our President and
Mr. T. M. Morris (Victoria) waited
upon the Director-General of War
Service Homes to discuss with him
certain matters which were brought
forward at the last Convention.
“The main matter discussed related
to the misinterpretation of the War-
ranty Clause and its .application to the
Maintenance Clause. Following the
interview, the Director-General ad-
dressed the following letter to the
Federation:
“ ‘You are assured that it is not the
intention or the practice to withhold
maintenance payments on individual
houses pending the completion of
maintenance items on other houses in
the group.
“ T agree that the Works Super-
visor should endorse the back of the
list of .maintenance items (our form
A 26) when he is satisfied that the
maintenance items listed thereon are
satisfactorily completed. When new
forms are printed, provision will
be made for a form of certificate on
the back, but in the meantime until
the existing forms are exhausted a
rubber stamp will be utilised to pro'
vide a form of certificate which will
be signed when the items are satis'
factorily completed. This certificate
will be in somewhat the following
form:
“ ‘ “I certify that the items as listed
on this form are now completed eatis-
factorily.” (Signature of Works
Supervisor, a?d date.)
“ ‘lt will be the builder’s respon'
sibility to see that the form is readily
available at the inspection for en-
dorsement by the Works Supervisor.’
“Your Executive suggests, there'
fore, that if builders insist upon the
certificate mentioned by Mr. Lucas,
much of the trouble with regard to
misinterpretation of the Warranty
Clause will be corrected.”
Dept, of Works.
“During the vear your President
and Secretary also waited on the
Deputy Director'General of Works,
Mr. L. G. Price, to discuss matters re'
lated to Condi.ions of Contract and
Quantities. It is believed that the
interview was a satisfactory one, in
that Mr. Price expressed himself as
being in complete sympathy with the
Federation’s viewpoint, and as evi-
dence of that it may be noted that
following a suggestion made by voiir
President the Federation has been
advised by at least one affiliated Asso'
ciation that the Department is provid'
ing Quantities in accordance with the
agreement between the Federation and
the R.A.1.A.”
Industrial.
“New ground was broken in indus'
trial matters by the Federation, in
that it acted as co-ordinating body for
affiliated Associations in N.S.W., Vic-
toria, S.A., and Tasmania in amng-
ing a conference with the Builders’
Labourers’ Federation to discuss, at
the request of the Union, a new
award. The conference, proved
abortive; but much useful frank dis-
cussion took place and provides food
for thought on the part of affiliated
Associations,” the Pveport concludes.
Important Decisions.
Decisions were reached on many
matters submitted for discussion by
the President, Executive, and Affiliated
Associations. These included:
• Appointment of Manager for
Federation;
« Federal Building Construction
Prize;
• Rise and Fall Clause;
• Quantities;
• Conditions of Contract;
• Industrial Matters;
• Apprenticeship;
• Immigration Programme;
• Sub'contractor’s Forms;
• Bonding Scheme;
• National Code of Ethics.
In thanking delegates for their
“very tolerant attitude” to the Chair
and each other during the business
sessions, the retiring President, Mr. T.
M. Lipscombe, recalled that during
his term of office he had received
many letters offering him advice and
assistance.
“I have been given a tremendous
amount of help and support from all
members of the 1953-54 Federal
Executive,” he added.
In wishing the incoming President
a very pleasant and prosperous year of
office, Mr. Lipscombe thanked one
and all for coming to Hobart for the
very successful Convention.
“We have greatly enjoyed having
you here. We wish you a pleasant
trip home and a ‘happy building year’
next year.” (Applause.)
The newly-elected President, Mr.
George H. Day, of Queensland, said
he had “been very happy indeed to
serve under Past' president Tom
Lipscombe.
"I am fully aware of the response
bilities of my new office and I feel
very confident that the Federation will
have another successful year.
“We have so many keen members
from the other States to help in rum
ning the Federation that I know we
are going to achieve a very great deal
in 1954-55,” Mr. Day declared.
Presentation to Tasmanian
Secretary.
Mr. Day, in making a presentation
to the Tasmanian M.B A. Secretary,
Mr. J. E. Braithwaite, said he had left
no stone unturned to ensure the com'
fort of delegates and the smooth
running of the Convention. Mr.
Braithwaite had done a really wonder'
ful job, he added. (Applause.)
Mr. Day then handed Mr.
Braithwpite a memento from the
Federal Executive, and a similar gift
for Mrs. Braithwaite, who was one of
the many Tasmanian hostesses.
Presentation of Gavel.
In presenting a suitably-inscribed
gavel of Tasmanian native woods to
the Immediate Past'president, Mr. T.
H. Lipscombe, Mr. Day conveyed the
thanks of delegates and visitors to all
the Tasmanian Master Builders for
work done in connection with the
Convention.
In accepting the gavel, Mr.
Lipscombe said: “It was team-work
that made the Convention a success.
Everybody worked eagerly and long
to make the Conference an outstand'
ing one.
“I am sure we will long remember
it in Tasmania,” he declared.
Business On Agenda.
Following adoption of the Hon.
Treasurer’s Report and Balance Sheet,
26
November 24, 1954.
BUILDING: LIGII I ING: ENGINEERING


and official correspondence, on the
opening day, delegates proceeded with
consideration of business listed on the
Agenda, as follows:
Conditions of Contract.
The Federal Secretary, at the Presi'
dent’s invitation, outlined the work
done by the Executive over the ; year,
and the stage now reached in negotia'
tions with the Royal Australian Insti'
tute of Architects.
The President, before adjourning
the debate, said that the Tasmanian
M.B.A. had obtained legal advice on
two or three clauses of conditions of
contracts.
Quantities.
Consideration was to be given to
a submission by the A.C.T. Master
Builders’ Association that Quantities
should form part of the contract. At
the request of A.C.T. President F. J.
Watters, the submission was with'
drawn.
The Federal Secretary reported that
during the year the Federal Executive
had made a survey of the desires of
affiliated Associations in the matter of
Quantities.
The consensus of opinion was that
the majority did not desire that Quan'
tities should " form part of the Con'
tract. It had been the policy of the
Executive to discourage Quantities
forming part of the Contract, but it
was felt that Quantities should be
guaranteed as a whole.
After outlining informal discussions
with a Department of Works official,
the Secretary said a formal'’ l - motion
from the Convention setting out its
policy would be helpful to the Federal
Executive.
He added that the question had
been fully covered in the Executive’s
1953'54 report. (See “Construction,”
Nov. 10, p. 2, col. 4.)
In the discussion which followed.
various delegates referred to ex'
periences in their own States.
Mr. W. L. Brine (President, Wes'
tern Australia M.8.A.) said the posh
tion in his State was that Bills of
Quantities for certain Government de'
partments were prepared by outside
Quantity Surveyors, and were thus
able to carry their own guarantees,
which were rigidly met.
The speaker said his Association
felt the W.A. Public Works Depart'
ment was satisfied with the existing
practice of recognised Quantity Sur'
veyors preparing Quantities.
He preferred that Quantities should
not be part of Contracts, and would
support a motion on the broad lines
that Quantities should be guaranteed
and not form part of Contracts.
The discussion then closed.
Uniform Mode of Measurement.
The President reported that the
Tasmanian M.b.A. nad decided to
adopt the N.S.W. standard of measure'
ment.
The Federal Secretary said that the
Institute of Quantity Surveyors (Mel'
bourne) had been trying for some
years to form a Federal Institute, and
this had now been achieved.
A recent convention of the Insti'
tute had resolved that a standard mode
of measurement should be evolved,
and Bills of Quantities prepared to
give maximum service to builders.
The Institute had also asked for
advice and assistance. The Federal
Executive had discussed the matter at
a meeting and had suggested, in reply'
ing to the letter, that attention be
drawn to the fact that the Institute
had already made suggestions that the
Federation should adopt the N.S.W.
mode of measurement as standard.
“That letter was an attempt to take
the leadership from the Federation
and place the matter in the hands of
people who are actually servants of
the building industry,” the Secretary
declared.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (President,
M.B.A. of N.S.W.) said the recently'
formed Institute of Quantity Sur'
veyors had held its first convention
in Sydney.
Since its formation, builders have
had no difficulties and have ex*
perienced an amicable relationship
with the surveyors.
Referring to the number of copies
of Quantities supplied to builders, Mr.
McGregor said each contractor re'
quired at least six copies and were
fully prepared to pay for them.
He suggested that in the event of
framing any resolution, an approach
should be made to obtain more copies
of Bills of Quantities.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.) agreed
with Mr. McGregor that it was not
“greatly difficult” to get Quantities,
but said he desired to sound a note
of warning. Some architects maintain'
ed there was a cheaper method of pro'
ducing Quantities than at present.
He said the idea of abridged Quan'
tities was sound, but it must be work'
ed out with the Quantity Surveyors
on a sound basis.
Mr. Morris warned that an officer
of the Institute had very definite views
regarding builders —views which were
dictated a little by architects. “This
officer is very keen to impose condi'
tions in practice overseas upon Aus'
tralian builders. We must be very
careful,” he added.
Mr. McGregor (N.S.W.): T agree
with Mr. Morris that the builder
should tell the Quantity Surveyors
what we want.”
Mr. McDougall (Victoria) suggest'
ed that the Institute of Quantity Sur'
veyors be notified that the Conven'
tion had adopted the mode of measure'
ment prepared by N S.W., and would

be prepared to discuss alterations from
time to time.
Mr. W. L. Brine (W.A.) said his
State had used a code of measurement
for the past 15 or 16 years.
“Fortunately, in W.A. the question
does not arise.
“The whole of the negotiations in
respect of Quantities are carried out
by my Association and the Institute
of Architects.
“I would suggest that any motion to
be framed on the basis of negotiations
between the Quantity Surveyors and
the Master Builders’ Federation will
treat Quantities as an arrangement be'
tween the Quantity Surveyors’ Insth
tute and the Associations themselves,”
Mr. Brine added.
Mr. C. P. Hornick (President,
M.B.A. of Q.) questoined whether
the Quantity Surveyors should be ap'
preached direct.
Mr. S. O. Edwards (N.S.W.), sup'
porting the two previous speakers, ad'
vocated direct representation to the
Quantity Surveyors’ Institute.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
then moved a resolution notifying the
Quantity Surveyors’ Institute that the
Federation has adopted the N.S.W.
mode of measurement and is prepared
to give consideration to amendments
from time to time.
Supporting Mr. McGregor, Mr. F.
E. Anderson (President, Newcastle
M.8.A.) said Newcastle architects had
recommended to their main body that
Quantities be shortened to a more
condensed form. His Association had
made an agreement that any altera'
tions be checked by them.
“I feel we should abide by adopt'
ing the N.S.W. mode of measure-
ment,” Mr. Anderson added.
Mr. W. R. G. Longmuir (President,
M.B.A. of Victoria) said Victoria had
had a lot of trouble with the Quan-
tides system, which had almost broken
down. The Victorian Quantity Sur-
veyors’ Institute had taken little note
of the Australian Institute, and had
evolved a number of variations to the
procedure set down by the Federation.
He said the Victorian Institute had
promised to “play the game” in
future.
Mr. Longmuir read a proposed
form of agreement on Quantities with
these clauses:—
(1) Public Tenders: If estimated
cost exceeds £15,000 in the case of
houses or £20,000 in any other work,
Quantities shall be provided.
(2) Private Tenders: In private ten-
dering the number of tenders shall
not exceed 4. Quantities are not re-
quired for other work unless the esti'
mated value exceeds £30.000. A
period of three weeks must be allowed
for preparation of a tender.
(3) Reference Panel: Should the
architect consider that in cases other
than those covered in the above
clauses should be made to the Secre'
tary of the Royal Victorian Institute
of Architects, who will refer the mat'
ter to a panel of two architects and
two builders whose decision shall be
final.
Should the panel be unable to reach
a decision, the application shall be
deemed to have failed. The applica-
tion should be in writing and should
consist of six written copies together
with two sketch plans, for such pre'
liminary information as is required to
describe adequately the nature of the
application.
(4) When not more than four ten'
ders are called privately, no Quanti-
ties are required unless the estimate
exceeds £30,000.
Mr. W. L. Brine (W.A.) said his
State had a joint committee on Quan-
tides comprising two architects and
two Master Builders.
Mr. H. C. Wilckens (President,
S.A. Builders and Contractors’ Assn.)
said his State had an arrangement
whereby any tenders over £15,000 re'
quired Quantities.
“A Builder ' Architect Liaison Com-
mittee meets regularly on any matters
brought up. The Committee polices
Bills of Quantities by cooperating
with all builders in our Association,”
he added.
The Federal Secretary (Mr.
Cavanagh) warned that it was useful
ot consider the preamble to the actual
agreement with the R.A.I.A. and the
Federation to ensure that architects
should provide Quantities. The
R.A.I.A. could not actually bind in'
dividual Chapters to in turn bind their
members.
“It is competent for any affiliated
Association to reach a separate agree'
ment with any Chapter.
The question arises as to how Hr
the Federation can go in regard to
Quantities agreements,” the Secretary
added.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.) said
an extraordinary situation existed in
his State. It had been understood that
there was an agreement with archi'
tects regarding Quantities, which some
honoured in spirit and others did as
they pleased.
“It is absurd to say we can’t bind
them in regards to methods of tender'
ing.
“The Federation should take the
matter up with the R.A.1.A.,” Mr.
McGregor declared. He suggested
formation of a subcommittee to in'
vestigate the matter and really get
somewhere; such subcommittee to
comprise one delegate from each State.
Other speakers supported Mr.
McGregor’s suggestion.
Mr. C. I. McDougall (Victoria)
said it would provide an excellent op'
portunity to reach uniformity through'
out Australia. He was sure that every
State was behind the Federation in
this matter.
Mr. F. E. Anderson (Newcastle)
said his Association for many years
has had an agreement with the archh
tects. There existed a committee of
two architects and two builders, and
if any builder noted the price exceed'
ing the limits of the contracts he in'
terviewed the committee, who stamp'
ed the plans accordingly.
“The system works quite well,” Mr.
Anderson declared.
Mr. G. H. Fricker (S.A.) said the
State Liaison Committee “was good
and gave builders an excellent spin.”
“Builders should put their own
house in order before approaching the
architects,” he added.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.) said
that in December last his Association
had received a letter from the R.A.I.A.
saying the builders were not honour'
mg the agreement.
Later, they received a letter stating
that there was no agreement!
Mr. McGregor declared that things
were quite dilferent in Port Moresby.
He quoted from an article in the
“South Pacific Post” under the cap'
tion “Haphazard Tendering in New
Guinea.” Herewith are some extracts:
A building expert said the amount
of a certain tender was totally inade'
quate because of the high cost of
building in the Territory. “A small
eight'square house built like a box
could possibly be designed to work
out at a cost of approximately =£2ooo.
“But when one of the local builders
sees full plans and specifications, he
immediately puts on £IOOO, just in
case there is something he can’t un-
derstand in the plans.
“The reputable builders in Moresby
are so tied up with the bigger jobs
that they won’t tender for the smaller
ones and the incompetent builder
knows it.
“There is also a builders’ fraternity
in Moresby. The fraternity often
meets in one of the hotel bars, where
three builders who have already ten'
dered (for a fob) may discuss their
tenders.
“A fourth builder will then realise
he is perhaps £2OOO below the lowest
of the three tenders. If he has not
already submitted a tender he does so
later at a figure he knows is in line
with the others.
“The position recently reached such
a state of chaos that people who called
tender itemised parts for the work and
asked builders to quote for each small
item.”
Rise and Fall.
Conference then gave consideration
to the general position in regard to
incorporation of a Rise and Fall clause
28
November 24, 1954.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


in building contracts and to the fob
lowing resolution submitted by the
M.B.A. of W.A.:
“For contracts for which the time
allowance is in excess of 6 months,
the tender submitted will be firm
for a period of 6 months. For that
part of the work then left incom'
plete, any increase or decrease in
labour and in materials that has
taken place during the six months
preceding will be applied. The
incomplete work will be assessed
in accordance with a progress
statement taken out at the end of
the first six months’ period of the
contract. A similar procedure will
be adopted for each succeeding 6
months period during the progress
of the works. In all cases the
quantities as prepared by the
Quantity Surveyor to be accepted
as the material and labour neces'
sary to complete the whole works.
Mr. W. L. Brine (W.A.), intro'
ducing the motion, said it was brought
forward as a basis of discussion and
as a further means of reducing the
amount of work necessary to carry out
Rise and Fall.
Mr. F. J. Watters (A.C.T.) said the
time factor of Rise and Fall was not
in the best interests of builders. De'
partment of Works contracts set a 50'
week time limit, which was usually
abused by the Department.”
Mr. A. Corbett (Q.), supporting
Mr. Watters, said his Association had
had a lot of discussion regarding Rise
and Fall Clauses and was very much
against any time limit.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.) ex'
plained his State's attitude. He said
his Association had advised its 2000
members that in future all tenders
should include a rise and fall clause.
Recently there had been some con-
troversy in the Sydney Press on this
question. The thing that had brought
Rise and Fall most into disfavour was
during the bad year of 195001, when
builders would have contracts signed
up with a Rise and Fall Clause and
would not start the job for a year.
“The potential cost would rise be'
fore the first brick was laid.
“In those days anyone who could
trip a builder had done a good day’s
work, but costs went up and up.
“N.S.W. was now insisting on a
Rise and Fall Clause in contracts.
Many tenders were now made out in
two wavs: one Rise and Fall, and one
Firm. Clients and architects must be
conscious of the need for such a
clause, but Canberra authorities have
declared they will not sign contracts
with Rise and Fall clauses,” Mr.
McGregor added.
Mr. M. C. Wood (S.A.) said that
about 18 months ago builders agreed
they should get rid of Rise and Fall.
Now they wanted it restored, and kept
in force from the start of all jobs.
Mr. T. M. Morris (Vic.) declared
that it was difficult to get unanimity
among builders themselves. Public
Works and State Departments had
positively refused to listen to argu'
ments regarding imposition of a Rise
and Fall clause. Architects said they
could get all the firm tenders they
wanted.
One big anomaly was that architects
who will not agree to Rise and Fall
very often include in contracts Prime
Cost items which are subject to
and fall in costs. Many merchants
never put in quotes unless protected
against such cost fluctuations.
Mr. Morris said the Federation
should take up the matter because, if
the builder cannot be granted Rise
and Fall, then firms must not be in it.
It was a real anomaly and the
Federation would be quite justified in
clearing it up, Mr. Morris added.
Mr. T. G. Neave (President, Tas-
manian M.8.A.) said the State Gov'
ernment had announced that in future
builders could not claim Rise and Fall.
Every endeavour should be made to
get the clause back unconditionally.
Mr. W. L. Brine (W.A.) declared
that present'day circumstances had
forced builders back to Rise and Fall.
He was not quite convinced by some
of the arguments heard, and he
thought the suggested motion might
meet the bill and give reasonable pro-
tection to builders.
Mr. S. O. Edwards (N.S.W.):
“Bunders have had a lot of adverse
criticism. The War Service Homes
Division has said flatly that if builders
want Rise and Fall, there would be no
more contracts.
"If builders are given stable prices,
they will give stable tenders.
“Some firms submitted two tenders.
But how do they arrive at firm
prices?”
Mr. L. Burne (Vic.) thought it was
wrong to set out any time limit in
contracts between client and builder.
The main difficulty arose from the
“cupidity” of some builders, who will
accept the conditions offered and
tender without a Rise and Fall Clause.
It was completely wrong to set a
time, Mr. Burne declared.
The Federation should define Rise
and Fall, and set no time limit. He
added that it was completely wrong
to cut it down to six months.
Sales Tax.
Conference gave consideration to
submissions regarding Sales lax from
the Queensland and West Australian
Associations.
Mr. C. P. Hornick (Q.) said Sales
Tax in his State was payable on tern-
porary structures erected inside build'
ings—such as stalls at the Exhibition.
He added that buildings were
“caught” for Sales Tax on temporary
seating erected on buildings for the
Queen’s visit to Queensland.

AN "OUTSTANDING" BREWERY BUILDING.
Outstanding in its surroundings, this West End Brewery building in Hindley Street,
Adelaide, rises sheer from the roadway. It is one of the city's most spectacular
structures, with clean and sharp lines that contrast with the older buildings on
either side of it.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Mr. W. L. Brine (W.A.) comment'
ed that Sales Tax was payable on a
barrow if used in front of a concrete
mixer; if used behind, none.
The Federal Secretary affirmed that
the Taxation Department defined bar-
rows used in front of mixers as
“mode” to manufacture.” This defini-
tion did not apply to barrows used
at rear of the machine. He added
that the Federation intended taking
the matter up with the Department.
Mr. H. C. Wilckens (S.A.) said a
case should be prepared on items
upon which Sales Tax was payable.
The President stated that a Com-
monwealth committee was dealing
with depreciation, and the matter
should be taken up with them.
He added the Executive would in-
vestigate the position thoroughly.
Retention Money.
The Federal Secretary reported on
a discussion with a Department of
Works official. Dr. Loader, who said
he was fully in sympathy with build-
ers’ problems regarding retention
moneys.
Dr. Loader, the Secretary said, ap-
preciated that builders could have a
considerable amount of money tied
up, and had suggested that the Fede-
ration should consider a bonding
system, or investigate ways and means
of builders providing some form of
bank guarantee, to ensure 100 per
cent, payment.
Dr. Loader would welcome any
views the Federation had on the mat-
ter, the Secretary added.
Mr. F. J. Watters (Canberra) said
that 90 per cent, of work available in
Canberra was from Government de-
partments, The 10 per cent, reten-
tion of moneys was “most unfair.”
Quite often builders had two or
three £lOO,OOO jobs a year, and thus
would have a large amount of money
tied up.
With private work more plentiful,
the departments were having difficulty
in obtaining tenders.
Mr. Watters suggested a retention
of five per cent, to £50,000; over
that sum, two and a half per cent,
should provide sufficient coverage for
the departments.
He felt the Federation should take
the matter up with the Department of
Works in an effort to lighten the
burden.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
felt the matter was “completely
“wrapped up in Victoria,” where the
Master Builders had formed a com-
pany to guarantee its members.
He had made a general survey of
N.S.W. Government departments and
architects, and learned that they
would welcome such a scheme “with
open arms.”
The question of bonding was a mat-
ter for the Convention and the
Federation.
In most American States, the law
was that all contractors must be
bonded on contracts and for protec'
tion of suppliers.
Mr. McGregor suggested that the
Federal Executive should closely
examine the question of bonding on
a national basis.
“It would be the greatest step for'
ward the building industry has ever
taken,” he declared.
Mr. FI. C. Wilckens (S.A.), who
toured the U.S. with the Australian
Building Productivity Team, explained
the American system whereby the
Builders’ Bonding Bureau guaranteed
contractors.
He added that his State would sup'
port Mr. McGregor’s submission.
Mr. R. ]. Nurse (S.A.), another
Productivity Team member, said the
U.S. Builders’ Bonding Bureau was
really another form of registration of
builders.
The builder supplied the fullest in'
formation possible to the Bureau, pro'
vided copies of balance sheets, etc.,
to enable the officials to estimate his
capabilities, and thus regulate the
amount of work he can efficiently
undertake.
The Association of General Con'
tractors of America, a powerful body
connected with the Bonding Bureau,
was “a boon and a great support and
protection for U.S. builders.”
Mr. Nurse added that any bonding
system in Australia must be on a
national basis.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.), who
handled the Victorian bonding
scheme since its inception, said his
State had taken the matter very
seriously. His Association had held
many meetings and had many fine dis'
cussions. They had found a few diffi'
culties, however.
He thought the time had arrived
when builders could no longer be ex'
pected to finance the public. “The
builder is not a millionaire, and can’t
wait for his money.
“The average building firm to'day
has to trade on overdrafts, so we put
the matter up to the architects as to
a method of reducing costs,” Mr.
Morris said.
Discussions with architects had re'
vealed that his Association could not
itself bond members. It was there-
fore necessary to form a company,
which is now in process of being
done, as a guaranteed group of
builders,
A group of builders, Mr. Morris
explained, may put in a certain sum
each as a guarantee of good faith in
themselves, and a guaranteed payment
to the contractor would obviate the
necessity of retention money.
The scheme would include every'
body of any consequence, control
anomalies among builders, and govern
conditions that applied to the pro'
jected plan.
“It would not pay -a builder to be
outside the group. It would be a
tremendous drawback to the builder
who didn't care if he was in it or out
of it.
“The day something on these lines
is evolved we will have gone a long
way in being of service to the
industry.”
Mr. Morris said Victoria was trying
to clear up the legal side before the
end of this year. The architects had
agreed to it in principle and were
anxious to get it working. They
could then recommend any builder in
that group with confidence. Thus
only members of the Association
would be guaranteed to architects, and
it would build up the M.B.A. into a
body respected by all industries.
Mr. Morris pointed out that not
every Association member would be
eligible for bonding, but endeavours
would be made to keep it as wide as
possible. He was anxious to bring
home'builders into the scheme.
“The collective bonding together
of assets in the form of guarantees
would have a big and favourable
effect on the public dealing with
builders,” he declared.
The idea originated with the then
Victorian Housing Minister, Mr.
Warner, who once asked a builders’
deputation: “Can’t you do something
to handle the crooked builder?” Mr.
Morris continued.
“The Federal sphere is beginning
to get interested, and if Victoria can
show something solid and sound, the
Commonwealth will be pleased to
accept it, and our Master Builders’
Associations will mean more than ever
before.
“We want a little more faith, a
little more trust, and a little more get'
ting together to make the industry
bigger and better,” he added.
Answering Mr. G. H. Fricker
fS.A.), Mr. Morris said Victoria had
discussed levying on jobs as a means
of covering the finish of jobs, but
under the group guarantee scheme the
complete job would be protected. But
the company would not be a guaran-
tee against insolvency.
Mr. McGregor (N.S.W.) suggested
that an approach be made to the
Commonwealth Government that re'
tention m. yneys be substituted by a
guaranteed bonding system.
It was resolved that the Federation
contact the Committee on Deprecia'
tion appointed by the Federal
Treasurer, point out anomalies in the
building industry, and submit details
of individual items presented by each
State.

Architectural Relationships.
Concern at the growing trend for
incomplete plans and specifications re'
_eived from architects was expressed
by South Australian delegates.
Mr. H. C. Wilckens said his Asso'
ciation was concerned at the division
of works to be performed into sepa'
rate parts to be carried out either
under separate contracts directly with
the proprietor or by means of "nomi'
nated subcontractors.”
It also objected to the principal
contractor having to carry the respom
sibility for performance of work
neither shown on the drawings nor
specified but which might be expected
to be performed to comply with the
object of the contract.
Re'tendering or “private negotia'
tions” after closing of tenders, with'
out acceptance or rejection of com'
petitive tenders, was also a cause of
complaint.
Mr. Wilckens declared it was time
the builders “became forthright in the
matter.” He sought the views of
other States.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.) said
architects will not i c sue certificates to
sub'contractors. The whole respom
sibility was placed on builders.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.) asked
why do not architects register plans
instead of builders having to do it?
Architects claimed that the uniform
building code did not allow them to
do so. This brought up a far bigger
problem. “Too often plans and spe'
cifications to tender on are incom'
plete,” he said.
He looked forward to the day
when builders could force architects
to submit complete and detailed plans
and drawings.
Architects were too fond of putting
in penalty clauses, and builders in
turn should put in their own penalty
clauses.
A productivity team which had
visited the U.S. had been impressed
with the complete drawings and plans
submitted by architects in America,
Mr. Morris added.
Mr. R. ]. Nurse (S.A.) said the
trouble in his State was that architects
relied on consultants for electrical and
other services. Most work was done
by electrical firms themselves, which
in turn supply the P.C. items.
In the U.S., plans for electrical and
other services are part of the overall
mechanical services.
Australian architects had a prob'
lem in getting consultants on mecha'
nical services. Mr. Nurse suggested
that builders could assist the archi'
tectural nrofession by trying to find
a cure for what was lacking in the
tvpe of drawings at present submitted.
He added that architects should not
be permitted to put in P.C. items.
Mr. W. L. Brine (W.A.) said his
State has trouble to a greater or lesser
degree, but all matters are ventilated
before a committee. However, closer
contact was wanted between repre'
sentatives of different Architects’
Chapters-.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.)
said architects are not only specifying
P.C. items, but names of firms to
supply them.
“It is distinctly unfair that archi'
tects should be allowed to put in a
firm’s name,” he added.
The President said that builders
should “put their own house in
order.” and when architects did not
suit them should tell them so.
Trade Trainees.
Introducing the subject of trainees,
Mr. Kennedy deplored the fact that
no Korea'Malaya ex'Servicemen were
permitted in N.S.W. to be trained as
plumbers.
He said that under the C.R.T.S.
scheme, 410 men had completed train'
ing as plumbers at 24/9/’54, and
1102 in the Commonwealth as at
30/6/’54. Mr. Kennedy declared it
was an “appalling position” to find
ex'Servicemen of two combat areas
excluded from plumbing training. He
asked that the matter be taken up
with the Prime Minister and Mr. Holt.
Referring to apprenticeship, Mr.
Kennedy said there were more trainees
last year in the N.S.W. building trade
than at any time previously.
The total number of apprentices
from January to September (inclusive)
this year was 1353.
Of these, 399 were indentured car'
penters and joiners, and 329 trainees.
Delegates reported that there were
shortages of apprentices among brick'
layers, plasterers, plumbers, and
carpenters.
Because of the operation of varying:
awards, it was decided the matter
could best be dealt with by individual
States.
The Convention expressed regret
that Korean and Malayan ex'
Servicemen were not permitted to take
a plumbers’ training course in N.S.W.
This attitude had resulted in a
dearth of tradesmen in the State.
Immigration.
Mr. Kennedy, who is a member of
the Immigration Planning Council,
outlined a plan for selected migrant
building workers to build homes in
Australia. The overall scheme was
that these migrants should leave their
families for the first twelve months,
during which time they would have
built the equivalent of one house.
These migrants should have one out
of every three houses erected, and
then establish their families in
Australia.
Mr. Kennedy said a large number
of migrants were expected from Hob
land and Austria, and homes would
be needed for them.
N.S.W. was the worst offender in
regard to housing newcomers. They
must be resident in the State for
twelve months before they can enrol
for a ballot.
Perhaps an approach to the Prime
Minister and the Immigration Minis'
ter would help get housing moving
and stimulate immigration, Mr. Ken*
nedv added.
The Convention endorsed Mr. Ken'
nedv’s migration policy.
Federal Ethical Code.
Mr. W. R. B. Longmuir moved
that the incoming Federal Executive
Continued overleaf.
ATTRACTIVE INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.
Possessing many superficially attractive features, this Kuwait Sea-water Distillation
Plant building is typical of sound architectural treatment and functional design
often lacking in structures with more claim to such than industrial plant housing.
The clean lines and tapering piers blend to make this handsome building an out-
standing landmark in its locality. —"Contract Journal.”

be instructed to prepare an Ethical
Code for the building industry
throughout Australia.
Mr. H. C. Wilckens (S.A.) said
several codes were in existence in
various States. They should be for-
warded to the Executive for considera-
tion.
Mr. T. G. Neave (Tas.) said Tas-
mania had adopted the N.S.W.
Master Builders’ Code of Ethics. He
thought it covered the industry very
well. A builder, by signing the
M.B.A. by-laws, thus accepted the
tenets of the code. He suggested
the N.S.W. code should be generally
adopted.
The Federal Secretary said that re-
cently, for the second or third time,
the Federation had come into the in-
dustrial picture as co-ordinating body
“for the greatest good of the States”
in a conference with the 8.W.1.U.
An expression of opinion from the
different States would indicate
whether the Federation should take an
active part in industrial matters or
stay inactive, “as in the past 62
years.”
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook (0-) out-
lined the International Labour Orga-
nisation’s opinion on the weekly-
hiring rate. There was a tendency to
give weekly hiring and a guaranteed
wage.
He had heard discussions of various
countries which favoured a weekly
hiring rate in industry.
The only thing Queensland didn’t
like about weekly hiring was the wet-
weather conditions.
Mr. Hornibrook declared it had a
lot in its favour and has the tendency
to put more work in the hands of
genuine builders than the other small-
job builders.
Queensland is used to weekly hir-
ing, and has no particular grudge
against it.
“You will find it is not the bogey
you think it is, excepting the wet-
weather clause. The 1.L.0. will en-
deavour to ensure that employees the
world over will be granted weekly hir-
ing,” he added.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.);
“If we can do anything to regularise
employment in our industry we are
doing some good.
“If we can get the ‘fly-by-nights’
out of the industry we are achieving
something.”
Mr. W. J. Bryant (N.S.W.):
“Skilled labourers are just as import-
ant on the job as any other trades-
men. To-day we have to accept
adults who are generally the rejects
of other trades. We are not getting
the type of men desirable to the
industry.”
He praised the Federal President’s
suggested change of name from Build-
ing Labourers to Skilled Building
Technicians, and to see if it were at
all possible to train building labourers
as skilled technicians.
This should stop the floating popu-
lation of semi-skilled labour in the
building industry, who were continu-
ally seeking high-priced, temporary
jobs.
Mr. S. O. Edwards (N.S.W.)
moved a resolution that the Confer-
ence was in favour of the principle
of weekly hiring of employees in the
building industry.
Everything should be done to
attract more labour into the industry
and keep it contented, he added.
Mr. T. G. Neave (Tas.) said he
was in favour of the weekly-hiring
rate, but it was important to retain
the right to hire and fire, and the
hourly rate of notice.
Mr. R. 1. Nurse (S.A.) outlined
the American General Contractors’
Code of Ethics. The organisation
comprised twelve districts in 48 States,
and the twelve districts between them
have 82 managing directors.
“The Council has a Manager and
Secretary, and committees function at
the national level. The whole indus-
try centres round the A.G.C. Private
enterprise does the job— not the U.S.
Government,” Mr. Nurse added.
Conditions of Contract.
Conference gave consideration to
discussions between the Federal Execu-
tive and the R.A.I.A. Council and to
submissions made by affiliated
Associations.
Opening the discussion, Mr. M
R. Hornibrook (Q.) said that if
the Conference wanted to do any-
thing about obtaining a better set of
conditions of contract the best pos-
sible solicitor should be engaged to
follow ihe matter through and “get
somewhere.” It was sad to hear of
brother-builders being up against it,
and the necessary steps to obtain a
new set of conditions should be
promptly taken.
The President thought Mr. Horni-
brook’s advice "iair and reasonable.”
If the Federation goes to the archi-
tect, it must also go to the Common'
wealth Government. It was high time
conditions of contract were put in
order.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.):
“As soon as a client signs a contract
he is a component part ot the
contract.
“We have to look after the inter-
ests of the building public, as well
as protect our own members. It is
a joint contract between architect,
client and builder.”
Mr. H. C. Wilckens (S.A.) said
the conditions of contract should be
entirely rewritten so as to be fair to
the builder, on the one hand, and the
owner on the other.
He suggested drafting an Austra-
lian Master Builders’ Federation Con-
ditions of Contract.
The matter was left in the hands of
the Executive to report back later.
Sub-Contract Forms.
Conference gave consideration to a
letter from the M.B.A. of W.A., bring-
ing before the Federation a sugges-
tion by a W.A. firm of architects that
a Federal standard form for sub-
contracts be considered.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
said his members felt the same way
about the need for a sub-contract
form. “It would be a very desirable
feature,” he added.
Mr. H. C. Wilckens (S.A.) agreed
entirely with W.A. that a form of con-
tract between the main contractor and
sub-contractor was very necessary. He
said his State had a form which “ties
up sub- and principal contractors very
well.”
Mr. W. Fairweather (W.A.) moved
that the Federation investigate and
prepare a sub-contract document, and
obtain copies of all similar documents
available from the States.
The motion was carried.
Managerial Move.
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook (Q.), ad-
dressing Conference on its last day,
thanked Mr. R. J. Nurse (S.A.) for
having so ably explained what was
offered in the U.S. by way of service
to builders.
“You don’t do that without
money,” he said.
Australia has grown big enough to
put the Federation on a direct foot-
BANK BUILDING WITH DRIVE-IN
FEATURES ON STILTS.
Mexico City's Lomas de Chapultepec
suburb has a new drive-in bank, with
traffic-ways cantilevered past the column
line above the open street level. Four
open traffic lanes at street level pro-
vide direct car-to-teller banking. Above
the root a shaped canopy allows day-
light to penetrate to the central portion
of the main offices. Glass, tile and
brick comprise the exterior walls.

ing in the shortest possible time.
This would require the services of
a full-time manager, with office and
necessary staff, to look after all the
affairs of the Federation and pilot the
whole organisation.
“If we had a manager with a full'
time job we would achieve a lot
which would be of great benefit to
builders. A levy of £5 per head or
on a sliding scale would finance the
proposed set'up.”
Mr. Hornibrook referred to the
M.B.A. of N.S.W’s. proposal to erect
a new building, and suggested that a
portion could be made available to
the Federation Secretariat.
He thought Headquarters should
be either in Melbourne or Sydney—
the latter, preferably.
Mr. Hornibrook moved that: “To
put the Federation on a more direct
footing the incoming Executive be
directed to submit a scheme within
six months for housing of the Federal
offices, and that ways and means be
sought for providing direct manage'
ment for the future running of the
Federation.”
Mr. L. L. Cockram (Vic.), speak'
ing to the motion, said the Conven'
tion owed the President a debt of
gratitude for his address, which ably
dealt with many vital matters.
There were many reasons when the
Federal body should be given more
power to foster private enterprise on
a national basis.
“The States won’t lose by it, and
the industry would gain considerably.
The Federation should seek a topdine
executive as manager,” Mr. Cockram
added.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
said Mr. Hornibrook had an excel'
lent way of taking the bit in his teeth
and getting somewhere.
New South Wales would be happy
to offer accommodation to the Federa'
tion. So far, only a deposit has been
paid on a building site.
Mr. H. C. Wilckens (S.A.), in sup'
porting the motion, said: “Continued
public relations can do nothing
but good.”
The President thanked Mr. Horni'
brook for brining the matter of a
manager forward. The question had
been discussed over a long period of
years, but there was no time like the
present.
He appreciated N.S.W’s. offer of
premises. Another suggestion was to
put a representative at Canberra
“right at the feet of the Federal
authorities.”
“We have got to get the right man
to run our Headquarters, and we must
select a man worthv of his hire. Aus'
tralia must be combed to get the best
man we can obtain,” the President
declared.
Mr. P. Bottomley (N.S.W.)
seconded the motion, which was sup'
ported by Tasmania, Canberra,
Queensland, and W.A., and carried.
Architects as Contractors.
The President asked if some archi'
tects were forming contracting com'
panics within their organisations?
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.) re'
plied that there was considerable dan'
ger in any such arrangement. He in'
stanced the case of the Joint Coal
Board, whose architects had also
tendered for erection of the Board’s
new premises in Sydney. This firm
had also been mentioned recently in
the Press.
He said the general consensus of
opinion in the Architects’ Institute is
that there is no reason why firms of
architects should not offer full and
complete service.
The speaker knew of three particu-
lar cases where clients of architects
had called tenders, then rejected all
tenders, and had gone about erecting
buildings under the supervision of
architects.
Mr. C. J. McDougall (Vic.) said
that for a long time architects had
thought they should be leaders of the
industry. That was the reason why
builders were getting so much sub'
contract work to'day.
“Don’t treat the matter too lightly,”
he warned.
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook (Q.) de'
dared it was a “double'edged sword.”
An architect’s job was to design and
to best represent his client by being
arbitrator between him and the
builder.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
said architects to'dav were disinclined
to accept anything but firm'price ten'
ders. This virtually put subcontractors
in the position of doing cost-plus
jobs for clients.
A motion moved by Mr. Horni'
brook that the Federation views with
disfavour the idea of architects become
ing builders, was carried.
Decisions of Conference
Prior to the conclusion of the Con'
vention in mid'afternoon, a number of
resolutions were put to Conference
and carried. Among them were:
• Federal Building Construction
Prize.
The incoming Executive was re'
quested to prepare a Code for the ad'
ministration of this Prize as a separate
document of conditions. The eligi'
bility clause now disqualifies a boy
taking full'time courses in building
construction with his employer’s con'
sent, but it does not disqualify a boy
attending classes at night only.
• Rise and Fall.
Conference passed a resolution that
a Rise and Fall Clause —without any
time limit —be incorporated in all con-
tracts,
• Quantities.
Conference approved the decision
to reaffirm the R.A.I.A. agreement
on Quantities and stated that any libe'
ralising of the amounts would be a
retrograde step.
The Commonwealth Government
has already adopted the limits agreed
upon by the R.A.I.A. and Master
Builders’ Federation. It was consider'
ed that if the Federation liberalised
the amounts it would be the signal for
the Commonwealth Government to
widen their figures. It was felt that

NACO LOUVRES IN SINGAPORE.
"Naco" Louvres were well displayed at a recent exhibition of Australian-made pro-
ducts in Singapore. The display shown here featured the air-control louvre fixed
directly in the wall masonry. The exhibit attracted the attention of Sir John Nicol,
Governor of Singapore (left), and Mr. G. Anderson, Australian Trade Commissioner.

R.A.I.A. it should not let the State
Chapters cut down the builders’ own
position.
• Conditions of Contract.
Anomalies and general weaknesses
in the Conditions of Contract are to
be referred by States to the Federal
Executive with a view to taking
prompt action with the Federation’s
legal advisers to bring about imme-
diate rectification of the position.
• Industrial Matters.
Conference unanimously resolved to
support the principles of Conciliation
and the Arbitration Court system.
• Apprenticeship.
The Federal Executive during the
Convention gave further consideration
to the training of eligible ex-service-
men as plumbers under the Korean-
Malayan Training Scheme. It was de-
cided to further consult with Mr. L.
Burne (Vic.), who will obtain infor-
mation from the Employers’ Associa-
tion before taking action.
• Immigration Programme.
Conference congratulated the Fede-
ral Government on its immigration
programme, and urged it to extend
the programme in regard to building
workers.
• Sub-contractor’s Forms.
The Federal Executive is to prepare
a document with a view to obtaining
uniformity throughout the States.
• Bonding System.
The Federal Executive was request-
a bonding system for builders, and
asked the M.B.A. of Victoria for fur-
ther information. It will later report
upon the Victorian proposal, after a
full investigation.
• National Code of Ethics.
The Federation expressed interest in
ed to prepare a National Code of
Ethics for all members of the affiliated
Associations.

President’s Convention Dinner
MASTER BUILDERS’ FEDERATION OF AUSTRALIA.
The social side of the very success'
ful 48th Annual Convention concluded
on Thursday night, November 11,
when the Federal President, Mr. T.
M. Lipscombe, F.A.1.8., gave’ a Din'
ner to delegates, visitors and Tas-
manian Master Builders. Some 200
were present at Wrest Point Hotel,
Hobart, and the function was out'
standing for its excellent service and
lavish hospitality.
Among the official guests were the
Lord Mayor of Hobart, Aid. A. R.
Park, M.H.A.; the Leader of the
Opposition, Tasmanian State Govern'
ment, Mr. R. C. Townley, M.H.A.;
Mr. A. W. Voss, Vice-president,
R.A.1.A., Tasmanian Chapter; Mr. M.
R. Hornibrook, Federal President,
Australian Institute of Builders; Mr.
G. H. Day, Senior Vice-president; Mr.
S. D. C. Kennedy, Junior Vice-presi-
dent, and Mr. R. J. Nurse, Hon.
Treasurer, of the Master Builders’
Federation.
Mr. G. K. Gillham was Toastmaster.
Toasts.
Following “The Queen,” proposed
bv the President, Mr. M. R. Horni-
brook proposed “The Commonwealth
of Australia.”
“It is my very pleasant duty to
speak to this Toast of the Common-
wealth which we serve and through
which we owe allegiance to the Queen.
Her Majesty has given Australia a
tremendous inspiration from her re-
cent visit,” the speaker said.
He referred to the Charter from
the Throne for the government of the
Commonwealth by Commonwealth
and State Parliaments.
The Commonwealth had a great re-
sponsibility for the defence of the
nation and had done a fine job to
date, which it would continue to do.
Mr. Hornibrook paid a tribute to
the present Commonwealth Govern-
ment, which had great responsibilities
to its people.
“In time of war the Australian
Master Builders were called upon to
do a mighty job. They did not fail
in their duty and will not fail to do
their duty should war ever come
again.” (Applause.)
Mr. Hornibfook concluded his
Toast by referring to the great
national progress recorded under the
present Administration. The Tas'
manian Government faced a big re'
sponsibility to carry out a lot of work
in the Island with every expedition.
Responding, Mr. R. C. Townley,
M.H.A., said it was a great privilege
to be a guest of the building industry
—the most important industry in the
nation.
“No other industry affords so ac'
curate an indication of prosperity
trends of Australia as your well'
organised, well-administered industry.”
(Anplause.)
Mr. Townley said every member of
the Federation had a great respon'
sibility.
“Some building is done with words,
and some is done the way you do it!
“There is proof enough in this
great land of ours that we are build'
ing a really strong, great nation. We
have produced sportsmen, scientists,
industrialists, people in every sphere
of industry who are on a par with
the best of other countries.
“Through them the future of Aus'
tralia is assured.
“But,” Mr. Townley warned, “we
must give attention to the fundamen-
tals without which no nation ever be'
came great.”
He warned that 13,000,000 people
faced Australia to the north, and it
was vitally necessary to “lay sure and
sound foundations for the future secu'
ritv of Australia.”
“We must have regard to the old'

fashioned things like Honesty, Loyal*
ty and Integrity if not, we cannot
hope to survive.”
He sometimes wondered about the
future, when one sees all around him
signs of disunity within the nation.
Every young country develops a
certain parochialism which leads to
feuds, strife and jealousy.
If ever there was need in the
world’s history to adopt “Unity” as a
watchword, that need was now, Mr.
Townley declared.
“Australia, with its 10,000,000
people, stands alone in the South'West
Pacific, a fact that makes us sure the
things which divide men into the divi*
sions of class, creed and intolerance,
have no place in the Commonwealth.
“This land of ours is a great coun*
rty, and it demands people with
breadth of vision, tolerance and un*
bounded belief in its future.
“We must develop Australia with
utmost speed, not only to be pros*
perous, but to be safe.
“You builders are an important part
of this nation, and you must always
bear in mind that you are building
not only for yourselves and your
clients, but are building for Australia
and our children’s future.” Mr.
Townley added.
M.B. Federation of Australia.
Proposing this Toast, the Lord
Mayor of Hobart. Aid. A. R. Park,
M.H.A., said the builchng industry,
which was responsible for
£340,000,000 expenditure this finan*
cial year, was indeed a very important
industry.
“Here in Tasmania we think we are
doing well if we have £1,000,000 to
spend—in fact, we are only a kinder*
garten State when it comes to spend*
ing, in the light of the vast amount
spent throughout the Commonwealth.
“I have a great amount of respect
for your industry, and a great amount
of responsibility rests on your shoul*
ders.”
The Lord Mayor warned that un*
less Australia builds its population up
to at least 60,000,000, it will face
many threats.
“One of the most important tasks
in Australia is to hold the country,
and to do that we must supply homes.
“We look to you men to build
homes. If that is done, the people
we need will come out to Australia.”
The thought of millions of people
at Australia’s front door caused him
deep anxiety, and he was very wor*
tied whether, in the next twenty years,
Australia can be held secure.
“I have knocked round the sea and
seen something of the world,’ the
Lord Mayor said. “Unless we popu*
late Australia we will never hold it.
“You builders have a great respon*
sibilitv and the greatest prospects in
the world in your industry.
“It is the greatest barometer in the
country and her yardstick of pros*
perity. I have not the slightest doubt
you will live up to your responsibili*
ties to the nation.”
He referred to day labour difficul*
ties, and said there existed no means
better than the private enterprise sys*
tern of tenders and contracts to get
things done at a reasonable cost,
“This great country of ours is being
murdered by things that are going on
to'day,” the Lord Mayor declared,
“and it is up to us to change all that.”
He congratulated the Australian
Building Productivity Team on its re*
cent successful overseas tour. The
Councils Building Surveyor was a
member, and the £2OOO spent to send
him overseas was the “best £2OOO we
ever spent.”
“I am sure it will pay dividends not
only to the Council but to Tasmania.”
In a tribute to the Team the Lord
Mayor said the benefit of its observa*
tions were already being felt, and,
“spread over the years, would p:ove
one of the finest things the building
industry ever did.” (Applause.)
Responding, the Federal President,
Mr. T. M. Lipscombe (Tas.) the
host for the evening said it was a

privilege and a pleasure to be able to
preside at the Dinner, which he would
always remember as “a pinnacle of his
building life.”
He was very conscious that the
words spoken at the Dinner were
deeply complimentary to the Aus*
tralian building industry.
Mr. Lipscombe recalled that he be*
gan his building career in 1923, when
a Mr. W. Gillam gave him his first
job, and an opportunity—then very
rare —to Lam the trade. Later on he
became a builder on his own account.
“Mr. Gillam. who is now 87 years
of age, has honoured me by coming
to this Dinner, and I offer him my
very sincerest welcome.” (Prolonged
applause.)
Continuing, Mr. Lipscombe said the
building industry was a very large and
very important one.
“We have got to look at it on a
national basis. Tasmania existed 100
years before Federation, and as we
have grown State by State, so must
the building industry grow to nation*
hood. (Applause.)
"We must be prepared for the next
war,” the speaker warned.
“The last time we were not ready.
The next time we must be primed to
go to war within twelve hours, other*
wise it will be too late.
“Organisation on a national footing
is a prime essential. We have the
technical brains required for such a
plan.”
Referring to the Convention, Mr.
Lipscombe said it had been very sue*
cessful, and had already done much
for the industry. Clear thinking on
the part of delegates had brought the
objects up*to*date.
“I feel that if we can put back into
our mightv industry a little of what
we are taking out of it, we will not
only make it worthwhile, but we will
leave it the better for our generations
to come,” Mr. Lipscombe concluded.
Tin Guests.
Proposing the Toast of “The
Guests.” the Sen'or Vice*president,
Mr. G. H. Dav (0 ). said the Con*
vention had further consolidated firm
friendships already established.
It was his first visit to Tasmania
and he liked immensely the cities he
hal already seen, and the people he
had met. (Applause.)
The Vice*president, R.A.I.A. (Tas.
Chapter). Mr. A. W. Voss, briefly
responded on behalf of the guests.
ROLLING SCAFFOLD PAYS FOR ITSELF.
This study showed that men cleaning and painting the Morgantown (W. Va.) lock
job spent half their time in raising and moving conventional scaffolding. The
mobile scaffold shown here was designed by the ingenious foreman, who built it
of pipe and rubber-tyred wheelbarrow wheels. It rolls along as the work progresses
and quickly pays for its cost. —"Construction Methods and Equipment."

CONVENTION HIGHLIGHTS
BUSY SESSIONS: ENJOYABLE FUNCTIONS.
Thirty-five delegates of the Master
Builders’ Federation from all States,
and 50 others with no voting power,
dealt with a very comprehensive
agenda at last week’s Hobart conven-
tion.
The programme, however, also en-
tailed an equally extensive entertain-
ment schedule. The business sessions
were suspended temporarily last Wed-
nesday, when a river trip was made to
New Norfolk. Unfortunately, the day
was wet, and opportunities for sight-
seeing were by no means the best.
Outside business hours, buffet din-
ners, outings for the ladies, a ball, the
President’s Dinner, and various other
functions were held.
Despite the heavy round of activi-
ties, a considerable amount of work
was done
Delegates did not conform to the
definition given by Mr. Strutt, M.H.A.,
at a civic reception in their honour.
He said the successful conference is
one in which delegates return to their
States with their brief cases fairly full
of papers, and their livers not behav-
ing as they should.
“What we want to build today is
goodwill and good fellowship, and if
we can help to do that we are doing
a good job,’’ the Lord Mayor of
Hobart, Aid. R. A. Park, M.H.A.,
declared at the Civic Reception to
delegates.
He said it was pleasing for him to
welcome the Master Builders because
one of his colleagues. Aid. T. M.
Lipscombe, was Federal President.
Mr. Struct, M.H.A., said pioneers
had built Australia fairly well, but it
had to become a bigger nation to take
its place in what the future might
hold, and the builders’ organisations
played a very important part.
In Australia, all Governments should
encourage builders and building or-
ganisations to do the job that should
be done by builders.
By allowing tenders to be freely
competed for, builders were able to
build up their supply of materials,
equipment and men.
That should equip them to do the
job they should be doing in peace
and at other t i ’mes.
The Federal President, Mr. Lips'-
combe, and Mr. G. R. Day fQ.). ex-
tended their thanks to the Lord
Mayor.
Mr. Dav said that while the States
worked independently they were
actuated by what came out of the
Federal conferences.
Concern at the serious lag in the
completion of school buildings was
voiced at the Australian Council of
School Organisations in Hobart last
week.
The council agreed to ask the Mas-
ter Builders’ Federation to suggest a
scheme to expedite the erection of
school buildings, and to give the sug-
gestion its utmost support.
Delegates were particularly con-
cerned at the lag in building for
secondary education.
(Last year Tasmania spent .£870,000
on new school buildings and addi-
tions to old school buildings. This
year it is proposed to spend £1,000,000.
Generally, Tasmania’s schools are be-
ing built on modern lines. They are
modern in design, colour and light-
ing.)
The presence of many of Austra-
lia’s leading master builders in Tas-
mania last week has placed emphasis
upon the great importance the indus-
try occupies in the nation’s economy.
The Convention received exceptional
Press and radio coverage, and all as-
pects of the discussions were very
widely reported.
Housing figures released in Hobart
last week reveals that a shortage of
houses still exists in Tasmania, but ex-
cept in the Hobart area the degree
of urgency does not appear as great
as it was two years ae%>.
This view was expressed by the
State Director of Housing, who said
applications for the year totalled
13 39. Some 467 dwellings were com-
pleted during the year, making a total
of 3496 since the inception of the
posL-war housing scheme.
An interesting feature of the Con-
vention was a talk by Mr. M. R.
Hornibrook (Q.), on his trip to
Europe to attend the 1.L.0. Confer-
ence in November-December last at
Geneva. He represented Private En-
terprise at the Building and Civil En-
gineering Conference arranged by the
International Labour Organisation.
Mr. Hornibrook related a fascinat-
ing story of his travels, and held
attention of his listeners for almost an
hour.
Earlier in the Convention, Mr.
Flornibrook addressed delegates on the
work an activities of the Australian
Institute of Builders, which was found-
ed three years ago at the Federal
Convention in Adelaide.
He traced the growth of the Insti-
tute and outlined progress on the new
North Sydney headquarters.
Mr. Hornibrook announced that
the Institute’s No. 1 honorary life
member, the Prime Minister, Mr.
Menzies, will set the foundation stone
at 4 p.m. on Friday, December 17.
Many members from State Chapters
will also attend the ceremony.
The leader of the South Australian
delegation, Mr. H. C. Wilckins, en-
tertained delegates and visitors at
Wrest Point Hotel, to films and slides
of his recent trip overseas with the
Australian Building Productivity Team.
Added interest was given to the even-
ing by a web-phrased, descriptive com-
mentary of places visited and sights
seen.
The Federation’s Junior Vice-Presi-
dent, Mr. R. J. Nurse (S.A.) gave a
very informative talk on impressions
and observations as a member of
the Australian Building Productivity
Team. He traced the journey from
Australia, to the Continent, U.K.,
Canada and the U.S.A., and drew
many interesting comparisons of build-
ing methods and techniques investi-
gated by the team. Mr. Nurse added
that a booklet embracing all aspects
of the tour is in course of preparation.
Recalling the previous Convention
in Tasmania 27 years ago, veteran
Master Builder Manuel Hornibrook,
speaking at the President’s dinner,
said: “There are very few people here
to-night who were with us at the last
Tasmanian Conference. Claude
Cooper was President in those days,
‘Splinter’ Watson was a member, and
Tom Cavanagh was Hon. Secretary.
“Those three are present here at
this dinner. (Applause.)
“We thought the Conference we
held then was quite big, but this
gathering to-night is the largest assem-
blage of Master Builders in connection
with the Federation that I have yet
seen.” (Cheers.)
Mr. Hornibrook recalled that on
his last trip to Hobart he had an acci-
dent, which handicapped him, but did
not deter him from enjoying real
Tasmanian hospitality. (Applause.)

tions to the Federation will be pub-

National Council of The Illuminating
Engineering Societies of Australia
NINTH CONFERENCE IN PERTH.
The Ninth Conference of The
National Council of The Illuminating
Engineering Societies of Australia
was held in Perth, W.A., from
November 3 to 5, 1954. All States
were represented, the delegates from
N.S.W. being Messrs. H. G. Fallon,
W. I. Stewart, and E. L. Freedman.
The N.S.W, delegates feel that this
Conference has been one of the most
successful in the history of the
National Council. It was character'
ised by the immense preparatory work
of the host Society, and the National
President, Mr. E. J. Negus, and the
outgoing and incoming State Presi-
dents, Messrs. R. L. O’Neill and A.
R. Leonhardt, had left no stone un-
turned to organise a Conference
Agenda which, for its blending of
Conference work, illuminating en'
gineering publicity and personal hos'
pitality, has yet to be matched by-
other States.
At the Conference level, much ad'
ministrative work was carried out. It
was particularly gratifying to see that
some of the most contentious prob'
blems resolved themselves amicably
and that in all matters unanimity
ultimately prevailed. The accompany-
ing picture of the Conference dele-
gates at the Conference table of the
Boardroom of the Employers’ Fede-
ration depicts clearly the spirit which
reigned at this Conference.
Important Paper.
The most interesting feature of the
days in Perth was the happy blending
of the Conference and a Convention
of Lighting Engineers. The principal
paner, read by Mr. H. G. Fallon on
“The National Importance of the
Lighting of Our Traffic Routes,’ is
printed on page 38 of this jour-
nal. For many months past, the
State Society had prepared the ground
for the Convention, and the public—
as well as the principal Government
and municipal bodies were ready
and prepared to discuss Public Light-
ing during the days of the Confer-
ence. There was not a day during
the week on which the Society and
its activities were not reported in the
daily Press, and on the last day in
Perth the Society even rated the
front page! Mr. Fallon’s lecture was
extremely well attended, approxi-
mately 120 members and visitors be-
ing present, led by the Minister for
Local Government and the Executives
of the State Electricity Commission.
Apart from the administrative and
technical work, the highlight of the
Perth week was probably the immense
hospitality which the State Society
and its members showered upon the
visiting delegates. They spent a de-
lightful evening at the home of Mr.
W. W. (Bill) Gunn, well known —
particularly to the New South Welsh-
men —as a Past President and Fellow
of their own Society before transfer-
ring to Western Australia. They were
the guests of the State Society at a
luncheon attended by some 65 mem-
bers and their friends, at which Mr.
Ernest L. Freedman gave an address
on “Some Lighting Impressions Over-
seas”; and they were again guests of
the State Society at a Picture and
Social Evening attended by approxi-
mately 95, at which they were prt-
sented with a book on the wild
flowers of Western Australia, with
beautifully coloured illustrations and
suitably inscribed, as a memento of
their visit to Perth. A formal Dinner
given by the Retiring National Presi-
dent, Mr. E. J. Negus, concluded the
Conference days.
The 195 5 Conference is scheduled
for Brisbane, in the home State of the
newly-elected President of the National
Council, Mr. F. J. Ryan.

The National Importance of Lighting Our Traffic Routes
By H. G. FALLON, B.E., A.M.I.E.Aust., F.I.E.S.Aust.
An Address Given at Perth, Western Australia, during the Ninth Annual Con-
ference of the Illuminating Engineering Societies of Australia, November, 1954.
Introduction.
Characteristics, moulded by history
and displayed in public conduct and
habits, will inevitably be reflected in
the policy and outlook of any coum
try. The British have produced a
typical outlook of conservation and
discipline, while the United States of
America has become associated in our
minds with large'scale enterprise and
mass production, productive of expan'
sive thought and organisation. In
Australia we have benefited greatly in
the past by both these very different
views, as expressed for instance in
various standard specifications, by fit'
ting the best ingredients of each into
our way of life and our engineering
codes in appropriate quantities, hav'
ing subjected them to the slow cook'
ing of such bodies, as the Standards
Association and garnishing them with
the requirements of our local condi'
tions.
As a nation we are, I think, re'
sourceful and selhreliant, and perhaps
a little too selTsatisfied, but naturally
we do not possess the traits of our
older forebears and cousins across the
seas. It is, therefore, interesting to
compare the statistics and pronounce'
ments of England, and America con'
cerning the subject of road accidents
and safety, so that, when we face our
own problems in this regard, we may
use the combined experience avail'
able to arrive at a reasonable and satis'
factory solution. There is, of course,
another reason for such a comparison
—they both speak our language.
The Australian Road Safety Coum
cil has already accomplished a great
deal in this direction, and its three'
pronged attack under the headings of
Education, Enforcement, and Em
gineering has been vigorously
pursued. It deserves much more supf
port than it has been given. We shall
not overcome this scourge of the high'
ways without the combined efforts of
every responsible Government body,
and every man, woman and child who
can walk across a road or drive a
vehicle. It will be shown from the
following considerations that good
street lighting is a valuable asset to
night safety, and that there is
an urgent need to increase these
facilities on our traffic routes to the
proper standards from what, in many
cases, is just hopeless inadequacy.
Accident Statistics.
In 1953 there were 38,300 persons
killed in the U.S.A. and 1,350,000
injured in road accidents. This is
more than the total Americans killed
and injured in the whole of the
Korean war. In Great Britain, for
the same period, 5090 persons were
killed and 221,680 injured on public
roads. In Australia the figures are
1865 killed and 41,858 injured. The
numbers of killed and injured per
million of population are:—
Killed. Injured.
G. Britain* (49.2) 103 4510
Australia (9) 207 4651
U.S.A. (162) 236 8340
* Population in millions.
The order would be changed if
figures were given per million motor
vehicles, of which there are a great
many more in the U.S.A. than in
Australia or Great Britain. (U.S.A.,
56,280,000; Australia, 1,990,000; and
Great Britain, 5,286,000.) However,
such a comparison would not indicate
relative road safety.
It is rather surprising and pleasing
to see that Great Britain has so
definitely taken the lead in this re'
meet, and it is strongly suspected that
the Government’s action in co-
ordinating the efforts of all interested
in road safety and in subsidising traffic
route lighting has a great deal to do
w’th it. The subsidy amounts to 50%
rf the cost and refers to “Class A
Trunk Roads,” which are selected by
the Ministry of Transport. The light'
ing nrovided is, of course, approved
bv the Ministry. U.S.A. has many
fine examples of excellent street light'
ing, but it is a vast country and, like
Jias long and empty dis'
tances between many of its towns and
cities. The figure for injured persons
is extraordinarily high.
Professor Walter Gropius, much'
travelled authority on modern archfi
tecture, commenting on the impact of
the automobile on modern life at the
Fourth Australian Architectural Con'
vention held in Sydney this year, said
that the pedestrian in Sydney was a
little better off than in New York,
where they continue to survive solely
by flattening themselves against the
buildings to avoid the hordes of speed'
ing' cars.
The records of all three countries
show that a greater number of per'
sons were killed at night than in the
day, despite the considerable reduc'
tion of traffic at night. The number
of persons injured at night, however,
is less than that during the day.
Table I shows these figures for 1953
in each of the States, as derived from
compilations by the Commonwealth
Bureau of Census and Statistics. It
is estimated to have cost the commu'
nity over £50,000,000.
The same source gives the location
and causes of these accidents in gene'
ral terms, and discloses the remark'
able fact that 92% of all casualities
occurred in places such as straight
roads, controlled intersections and
bends with open view, where normal
caution and seeing conditions would
have sufficed to avoid a very large
porportion of them. With regard to
the causes, three are responsible for
more than half the casualties: Failure
to obey the rules of the road,'23%;
Excessive speed having regard to the
conditions. .1%; Inattentive driving,
19%. Other causes such as intoxica'
tion, 3%, are relatively small. (Slides
5,6, 7,8, 9.)
Light and Sight.
Why is it, we may well ask, that

mittee on Illumination and Street Lighting

the severity of accidents is so much
greater at night? What is the main
difference in the conditions of driv-
ing? The road itself and its markings
have not changed. The persons con-
cerned, with very few exceptions, have
not changed, and the vehicles are the
same. The only radical difference is
the lighting. It is a tremendous dif-
ference to drop from an illumination
during the day of thousands of
Kimens per square foot to. perhaps as
much as two or three and generally
less than one lumen per square foot.
(Figure 1.)
Yet even in this very lop/ range
the humati eye is sensitive and has re-
markable ' powers of adaptation and
appreciation of environ ment|L move-
ment. Fortunately, human vision is
not confined to the line of sight, and
the rod receptors around the central
area of the retina give us essential
and very prompt notice that some-
thing is there which requires imme-
diate attention. The eye turns auto-
matically in this direction in a frac-
tion of a second, sizes up the situa-
tion and. if necessary, sends the motor
system of the body into action. While
rod vision is always at the disposal of
every person with normal sight, it is
particularly sensitive at the low bright-
ness levels which prevail out of doors
at night. Hence even the slightest
glint or reflection out of the normal
line of sight may be the means by
which the driver of a motor vehicle
can detect the presence and intention
of a pedestrian about to cross the
road or the signal of another driver.
The one absolute requisite is sufficient
light to give at least this stimulus to
our vision.
Fixed Lighting.
It has been amply demonstrated
that the greater the amount of fixed
street lighting which is provided at
proper intervals, mounting height and
distribution, the safer are the condi-
tions both for the driver and the
pedestrian. This is true no matter
what source of light is used, whether
incandescent, mercury, sodium or
fluorescent. What we really want to
know is the minimum value which
must be provided to give reasonable
safety. The Street Lighting code
places this minimum for the least
important of the traffic routes at 30
lumens per foot of street, and for the
most important traffic route at 120
lumens per foot. The graph taken
from statistics by R. E. Simpson,
which included a number of Ameri-
can cities in 1935, shows that the
safety factor is particularly good at 80
lumens per foot. The British speci-
fication for traffic routes (A class
streets) recommends 30 to 80 lumens
per foot. In this range the use of
the motor vehicle headlamp driving
beam is considered unnecessary and
is, in fact, prohibited.
Vehicle Headlights.
While it is not disputed that head-
lamps on motor vehicles are required
under conditions of fixed street light-
ing less than those mentioned above,
or on country roads, yet it should be
most emphatically stated that there is
no greater enemy of vision on traffic
routes. There are hundreds of dan-
gerous situations created in every
Australian city every night by motor
vehicle headlamps. No amount of
fixed street lighting can counteract
their blinding effect. (Figure 2.) Con-
sider for a moment the conditions
with which the eve is asked to cope.
The level of brightness to which it is
adapted in the normal night street

lamberts. Under these conditions the
policeman on point duty can be seen
with reasonable clarity, and so can
the pedestrians crossing on the far
side of the intersection. Suddenly
behind these objects the head lights
of an approaching car appear, throw'
ing 10,000 to 15,000 candle-power
from the lower or traffic beam straight
into the observer’s eye with a bright-
ness 50 or 60 times as great. The
pupil immediately contracts in an
attempt to adapt to the higher level
and loses all sensitivity to brightnesses
previously seen. Even the white glove
and cap of the traffic constable dis-
appear. This is with a tilted traffic
beam which is so oiten encountered
on a rising gradient. The candle-
power of the upper or country beam
is between 40,000 to 50,000 and the
specification for sealed beam head-
lamps naively limits the maximum in-
tensity at any to 75,000 candle-
power.
Traffic Density.
All three Street Lighting Codes —
British, American, and
base recommendations on traffic den-
sity. The British Code does not,
however, subdivide its A class or
traffic routes into classes, merelv stipu-
lating that the amount of light pro-
vided shall lie between 3000 and
8000 lumens per 100 ft. of road. It

defines traffic routes as “all those
roads which form the main approaches
to or traverse important centres of
population, or pass through detached
built'up areas and on which there is
appreciable pedestrian traffic. On
these roads the standard of lighting
should provide an ample margin of
safety for all road users without the
use of headlights by motor vehicles.
When deciding upon the type and
level of lighting appropriate to any
given road, the volume and type of
traffic will be a predominating factor.”
There is much in this code which is
of great value, and no doubt it is
designed to suit the particular condi'
tions met with in the British Isles.
However, one can never agree that
it could be applied successfully with'
out the assistance of an experienced
Street Lighting Engineer.
The American and Australian Codes
are more specific with regard to traffic
densities and are compared as
follows:
The Australian recommendations
are based on a road width of 40ft.,
and for wider carriageways the lumen
values are increased proportionately.
I believe that this classification would
be improved by extending the limits
of traffic density and that a definite
value of lighting could and should be
fixed above which the use of motor
vehicle headlights ought to be pro-
hibited. A minimum value of 30
lumens/ft. of road might well be
chosen for this purpose.
Traffic Counts.
By specifying traffic density as the
basis of recommendations, it follows
that traffic counts have to be taken
at least in some typical streets. The
Dept, of Main Roads, N.S.W., have
developed an ingenious traffic meter
which counts the impulses given by
axles of vehicles to an air tube
stretched across the carriageway.
(Figure 3.) This meter is capable of
quite accurate measurements up to
very high densities. I understand that
a similar type is used in other States.
From several counts taken in August,
typical traffic flow curves over 24
hours are shown (Figure 4), and the
distribution of traffic during the week
divided into night and day periods
has been calculated. Some very inter'
esting variations can be seen from
Figure 5.
Road Capacity.
The capacity of the road to take
the traffic must have a considerable
influence on the densities experienced.
If the demand upon a road imposed
by traffic is greater than its capacity,
at a vehicle speed of, say, 30 m.p.h.,
then the vehicle speed must be re'
duced and congestion eventually
occurs. According to “Highway Prac'
tice in the U.5.A.,” published by the
Public Roads Administration in 1949,
the maximum possible capacities for
roads having different numbers of
lanes and assuming ideal conditions
are stated to be 2000 vehicles/hour in
both directions for twodane highways,
4000 v.p.h. in both directions for
threedane highways, and for roads of
four or more lanes 2000 v.p.h. per
lane. These figures are for average
speeds of between 30'35 m.p.h.
As roadway conditions are seldom
ideal, the volumes quoted above are
greater than those met with in prac'
tice. When handicaps such as parked
cars, traffic lights, cross'traffic, etc..
are taken into account the working
capacity per free lane is seldom more
than 700 m.p.h. It is interesting to
note from this report that as the
average speed increases, so must the
spacing between cars increase to retain
reasonable safety margins, and this
causes the number of vehicles passing

gested thoroughfares. Why, then,
should a greater amount of light be
suggested for the higher densities of
traffic?
Reference to the 24'hour traffic
flow curves (Figure 8) will give the
answer, for even the most heavily
trafficked highway has long periods of
light traffic conditions at night, and
it is probably the best made track for
those who are not so fussy about
speed limits at hours when the law is
not so likely to detect a breach.
The Cost of Good Lighting.

the recognised four main sources of

rises above 35 m.p.h. (Figure 6.)
It has been clearly shown as far
back as 1933 that it is the light, fast'
moving traffic on highways which is
most likely to produce casualty acci'
dents and that reductions in night
accidents are more marked under
these conditions as the street lighting
is increased than for the more con'

and it will be seen that the 500'watt
incandescent, 250'watt mercury, and
140'watt sodium all give maximum
beams of between 2000 and 3000
candelas (candle-nower), while the 2
x 80'watt fluorescent hardly touches
1500. It should be noted in passing
that the 400'watt mercury will give
nearly 5000 candela in the maximum
beam, ’there can be little doubt that
to obtain a reasonable distribution of
brightness from non'cut'off lanterns
the spacing between lamps can be
considerably greater for the mean'
descent, mercury and sodium sources.
Thus, in comparing the cost per
lantern, we must introduce another
factor of ‘lanterns required per niife"
before the true relative costs are
obtained. If the spacing is 120 feet
for all sources, this factor will be
unity, but, if comparable lighting re-
suits are obtained with 180 feet
except for fluorescent, which still
requires 120 feet—then the factor for
the latter will be greater than unity.
It is more convenient to keep the
lumens per foot of street constant,
however, and the cost of three 40'
watt fluorescent lamps in one lantern
at 120 feet, spac.ng should be directly
comparable in cost to the 500'watt
fluorescent, 250'watt mercury and
140'watt sodium at 180 feet spacing.
All give about 50 lumens/ft. of
street. (Figure 8.)
A great deal depends on the
charges made for electricity, and it
can be shown that, at 0.5 pence per
kWh. the 500'watt incandescent gives
the lowest cost; at 1.0 pence per kWh
mercury 250'watt and sodium 140'
watt are about equal and lower than
the others of similar lumen rating.
Fven at 2.0 pence per kWh the fluo'
rescent 3.4o'watt is still a fraction
higher than the 500'watt incandescent
and considerably higher than the
others. In Figure 9 this is shown
graphically, and it will be noted again
that for higher lumens per ft. of
street there is nothing to touch the
400'watt mercury lamp.
Economic Savings Likely.
In the April, 1954, issue of “Light
and Lighting” there is an editorial
comment regarding some conclusions
arrived at after careful study by the
British Electrical Development Asso'
ciation. It suggests that the moder'
nisation of existing street lighting
u l receive the highest priority and
that the elfect of this work might well
cause a reduction of 20% in the
total of those killed and seriously in-
lured at night. Is this too much to
expect in Australia?
To estimate the number of casualty
accidents which would be avoided if
the street lighting was brought up to
code standard, the only reasonable
basis appears to be the comparison
between the day and night hazards—
admittedly a very broad basis. Night
traffic in metropolitan areas is some'
what lower than 40% of the day
traffic (40% is the figure for many
of our highways). The accident rate
should, therefore, be weighted in this
proportion at least. For instance, if
1000 vehicles in the day produce ten
accidents and 400 vehicles at night
produce eleven accidents, then the
number of accidents for 400 vehicles
in the day can be compared directly
to estimate the added night hazard.
In this hypothetical case the direct
proportion is four compared with
eleven, and the difference of seven
could, therefore, be attributed to the
added night hazards.
It is further assumed that the per-
centage of casualty accidents which
occur on traffic routes in built-up
areas for day or night is 60% of the
total killed, and 70% of the total in'
jured. (In at least one State these
percentages are higher.) Now let us
apply the statistics given for 1953 in
Table 1 in the following;—
Value of Human Life
and Limb.
It is, of course, very difficult to
estimate the total loss to the commu'
nity which these accidents incur.
The value of a human life in this
respect varies a great deal and, in
the case of injury, the time and ex'
pense of recovery may be from a day
or two up to several years,, involving
anything up to thousands of pounds.
In a few cases, moreover, there is a
permanent disability resulting in a de-
crease of earning capacity. In our
various State Acts dealing with
workers’ compensation the amount
payable in case of death ranges
between £l5OO and £2500, plus an
amount of from £5O to £l5O for each
dependent child under the age of 16
years. In N.S.W. and South Aus'
tralia, payment is based on the de'
ceased person’s earnings over the four
years preceding the accident, while
the New Zealand basis is a figure 250
times the weekly earnings, or about
The rather astounding conclusion
from these figures is that almost 40%
of the night fatalities in buildup areas
and 30% of the injuries could be
saved if visibility conditions were
improved to a point approaching day'
light. Even with values within the
range suggested by the code for
street lighting, it is not unreasonable
to suggest that 25% of all night
casualty accidents would be prevented
on streets lit to that standard. This
means, in round figures. 250 deaths
and 4500 injuries saved per annum
on the 1953 totals of about 1000 and
18.000, respectively.
five years’ earnings, with a maximum
of £2370. These limits were fixed
five or six- years ago and are obviously
behind present'day levels, for if a
man on a basic wage of <£l2 had full
employment for four years his gross
earnings would be £2500.
On the other hand, the majority
of claims for compensation in road
accidents are common law actions
heard before a jury, and, in the last
few years, there have been many ver'
diets exceeding £5OOO where a death
is involved. In one road fatality in
1953. compensation amounted to
£13,500. In another case early this

year the widow of a grazier whose
average earings were £3OOO was
awarded £10,600 and, if the rule of
four years’ earnings had been applied,
the compensation would have been
higher.
We must not forget that compen-
sation paid under the Act does not
include any community losses such as
legal fees, police expenses, insurance
companies’ expenses, damage to
vehicles and property, hospital or doc-
tors’ fees, the loss of time and money
involved in attending to and settling
the business of the deceased, and all
the various phases of investigation.
There are cases in which no one can
be held responsible for the accident
except the person killed, and no com-
pensation is paid. With all these var-
ious considerations in mind, surely
the average figure per person killed,
irrespective of age, sex or position in
life, could not very well be less than
£5OOO for community loss.
Much of what has been said above
applies also to injuries. Workers’
compensation, taken again as a low
as hearing, sight or limbs are valued
limit, indicates that serious losses such
at between £750 and £lOOO. The
total community loss for the average
injury sustained in road accidents at
night might then be conservatively
taken at £lOOO.
The monetary value of the eco-
nomic saving made possible by proper
street lighting would thus be estimated
at £5,750,000 per annum, while the
additional annual cost of providing
such lighting would amount to about
£900,000. The proportion which
might be allocated to each State is
shown in Figure 10. A very attrac-
tive investment, to say the least of it!
But it should be regarded as a serious
responsibility.
whose Responsibility?
At present the municipal and shire
Councils of the Commonwealth are
shouldering practically all this respon-
sibility and are probably paying a
little more than £1,600,000 this year
for the lighting of their streets and
traffic routes —yes, and even State
Highways within their boundaries, if
it is practicable to light them at all. I
have no doubt whatever that the
principal Electricity Supply Authori'
ties and the Illuminating Engineering
Societies in each State have done what
they can to bring before the local
governing bodies the requirements of
the Street Lighting Code and the ad'
vantages to be gained by adopting its
recommendations.
Some of these Councils can afford
to authorise this street lighting, but
many of them cannot. Some are
anxious to fulfil their responsibility,
and some are not at all anxious to do
so, believing that other expenditure
is more important. There are differ-
ences of opinion and policy which
affect the lighting of one main high'
way passing through the areas of a
number of Councils and supply
undertakings. We must admit that
there is no appreciable co-ordination
or National responsibility.
State Governments have been
acquainted from time to time of the
urgent need for some co-operation in
the matter. The South Australian
Government as early as 1940 received
and adopted a report from the State
Traffic Committee on Main Road
Lighting and is now making a cub-
stantial contribution to the annual cost
of lighting the Port Road and Anzac
Highway. The following quotation
from clause 49 of that report is of
interest in this connection:—
“After the fullest discussion and
the most careful consideration, the
Committee recommends that two'
thirds of the annual cost of lighting a
main road which has been entrusted
to the control and supervision of the
Commissioner of Highways should be
borne by the State Government, and
the remaining one-third should be
apportioned between the local gov-
ernment authorities, through whose
areas the road passes, with the pro-
viso that the total amount payable by
any local government authority shall
not exceed £lB per centum of the
rates derived by it from properties
abutting on such main road."
But we may well ask, "Are these
two roads the only ones in Adelaide
which deserve such -support? What
about the Stirling Highway and
Canning Highway, in Perth; The
Gympie Road and Beaudesert Road,
in Brisbane: the Hume Highway and
Dandenong Road, in Melbourne; and
Parramatta Road and Pacific High'
wav, in Sydney?”
It is well known that these are not
the only important traffic routes to
and from our capital cities. Most of
them are not lit to code standard.
The only conclusion which can be
reached at this National I.E.S. Con'
ference is that unless the State Gov'
ernments do something to assist the
local Councils in lighting the main
traffic routes in our metropolitan
areas, we shall not succeed in stop'
ping the increasing number of road
accidents which kill and maim so
many of our valuable citizens through
lack of adequate visual aid.
Conclusion.
I would like to acknowledge, with
thanks, the assistance I have been
given so readily by Mr. Evans, of
London; by members of the I.E.S. in
various States, in particular to Mr.
Douglas, of the Dept, of Main Roads,
and Mr. Walker, of the Dept, of
Government Transport, both of

better proportion, the important part
which street lighting must play in the
prevention of night casualties, without
detracting in any way from the need
to pursue the more obvious methods
of improving the safety of the road-

Contemporary Commercial Design.
The building recently completed at
Mascot. Sydney, for \V. T. Coggins
Pty. Ltd. was chosen as the centre
for pre-checking for the Redex Trial,
and was admired by the thousands of
visitors, who were impressed by its
advanced design. It is an excellent
example of contemporary commercial
architecture, where structural beauty
has been achieved by the straight-
forward means of proportion, mass,
simple construction, and colour.
In particular, the ugly saw-tooth
roofing—which is less frequently u-cd
in factories overseas than here —is
not evident to the observer. This
effect is achieved without the extra
cost of high brick walls, mainly by
the arrangement of the office section
as a two-storey block in front of the
factory. This procedure also proves
convenient for both visitors and per-
sonnel, who—also in accordance with
overseas practice—are brought through
the front of the building, with con-
seouent advantages to the production
and general benefit of the Company.
The new structure has been built
for the servicing of Holden cars and
Bedford trucks, and for the sale of
spare parts and general facilities. This
is in accordance with the decentralisa-
tion policy of many city companies.
Use of Colour.
Illustrating the contemporary fea-
ture5 ’ the building is well set back
behind lawns and gardens, and per-
haps its main feature is a cantilevered
frame section, the inset of which con'

windows. Both the panels and the
windows, as well as other materials
used, require no future maintenance
in this heavy industrialised area.
Included in the entrance area to the
Ground Floor are the Spare Parts Dis'
play and Sales with storage behind,
and a large Customers’ Lounge and

are situated on the First Floor,
together with extensive amenity facili-
ties. Views of the working areas are
obtained from both floors, and espe'
cially from all the offices, where the
whole working area can be observed.
Also in keeping with latest overseas
trends, modern types of pits for ser-
vicing have been constructed, to en-
able quick and constant work on all
parts of the cars and trucks at the
same time. This feature eliminates the
need for hoists.

LIGHTING AND ELECTRICITY
SUPPLY
Summary of Presidential Address by
Mr. E. S. Lenox, M.1.E.E., F.1.E.5.,
Manager of West Sub-area of the
North-Eastern Electricity Board, Eng-
land, given at the first meeting of the
1934/5 session of the Illuminating
Engineering Society, London.
Reviewing the historical develop-
ment of lighting and the supply in-
dustry, and the utilisation of lighting,
Mr. Lenox spoke of the difficulties
of electricity supply systems because
of the low “load factor” of the light-
ing load. The gradual improvements
in lamp efficiencies brought visions of
reduced load, but this was circumvent-
ed by the expansion of the applica-
tions of lighting to periods other than
night use for two or three hours a
day.
After World War I lamp efficiencies
still further improved and the benefits
of good lighting were beginning to
be appreciated. New developments in
the coiled coil lamp and in the dis-
charge lamp were welcomed by the
industry, as a means of increasing the
use of electricity.
In just over half a century the cost
of light had steadily been coming
down. In 1893 one purchased 440
lumen'hours, in 1954 one purchased
23,000 lumen'hours. Notwithstanding
the efforts of the industry progress
in the utilisation of lighting has been
slower. Lighting in the home is still
slow in regard to the acceptance of
higher lighting levels. The very sini'
plicity of electric ligh ing has t 3 some
extent hampered its development. In
many homes the hanging lamp and
the single switch is the limit of its
application.
It seems inconsistent that many
supply authorities which would reap
the benefit, do not take more part in
the lighting campaigns. There is
great need for a revival of the energy
displayed pre-war in bringing the ad-
vantages of better lighting to the
notice of consumers.
In industrial and commercial premi-
ses there has been progress, but much
is still to be done. Many offices,
where daylight is inadequate, still lack
the benefits of good electric lighting.
Street lighting is not as good ?t it
should be and this is not the fault
either of the industry, or the design-
ers of lamps and fittings. If money
was made available we could make ou r
roads very much safer at night and
at less cost to the community of the
accidents from which we now suffer.
Mr. Lenox said the problem before
us now is the same as that of 60 years
years ago. namely, the improvement
of load factor. Expensive plant must
be used to the full. The peaks and
valleys of the load curve must be
levelled out. Advances in lamp effi'
ciencies, improved lighting techniques,
and higher standards of use and ap'
plication offer at the same time im-
provements in the load factor, greater
now than ever before.

Master Builders’ Association of Victoria
ANNUAL DINNER.
The general public knew very
little about the building industry, Mr.
W. R. G. Longmuir, President of the
Master Builders’ Association of Vic-
toria, told members at the Annual
Dinner held at Hawthorn Town Hall
on November 19.
Mr. Longmuir was proposing the
toast, “Our Industry.”
“Both the supply and construction
sides of the industry have to get
together to see that the prestige of
the industry is upheld,” he said.
“The fact that building work to
the value of £340,000,000 was carried
■out in the past year showed that
building was no small industry.
“Builders get kicked about and un-
justly blamed for many things. The
public did not realise the amount of
work, trouble and worry involved in
getting a job completed.”
Mr. Longmuir said builders offered
architects their fullest co-operation,
'and added that they were always pre-
pared to do their best, but architects
should remember that while builders
if supposed to be tough guys, were
only human.”
Suppliers were the builders’ back-
bone, but the President added: “I am
not going to mention anything about
bricks: they have had it, but never-
theless they are doing their best.”
In the field of housing. Mr. Long-
muir said the builder? had done a
magnificent job and were now doing
a good job in “putting a cover over
industry.”
A balanced programme of building
was necessary, and then housing and
industrial building must go hand in
hand.
Mr. Longmuir said that when he
was abroad he realised how much
other countries recognised the import-
ance of tile building industry to de-
fence. The better the industry was
mechanised, the more valuable it was
for defence purposes. In Britain, the
building industry had gone a long
way towards recovering i s position
since the war. Nowhere did the
building industry win a greater
prestige than in Britain.
The Hon. T. Hayes, Minister for
Housing, responding to the toast,
said the Housing Commission had
95% of its work carried out by con-
tractors. The Commission was not
interfering with builders: rather, it
wanted to encourage builders because
in the next two years it wanted a lot
more work done so that the Olympic
Games could be orooerly housed..
Mr. Hayes said: “You are in busi-
ness to get results, and we are here to
see that you get them if you can.
Anything I can do to assist will be
done.
I know it is said you should not
have control of cemen: and bricks,
but we are trying to see that every'
or.e in the industry gets a fair go.
ihe building industry would suffer if
controls were lifted. I want you to
co-operate, and I will co-operate with
you.”
The toast “The City of Melbourne”
was proposed by Mr. L .L. Cockram,
Senior Vice-President of the Master
Builders’ Association.
“Our industry has done a great
deal in making this city of which we
are so proud,” Mr. Cockram said.
’“We are proud that three Lord
Mayors of the city have sprung from
the building industry Sir John
Swanson, Sir George Wales, and, last
year, Cr. ‘Bob’ Solly.
“I know it is now past history, but
we owe a lot to Cr. Solly for the dig-
nified way in which he carried out his
duties during the Queen’s visit.
“We h?.ve outgrown our Town
Hall and should have another, much
bigger. We cannot accommodate
orchestral concerts. It is time we
had a really good auditorium for
them, even if it is a semi-open one.”
Cr. R. H. Solly, responding,
apologised for the absence of Cr.
Sellick, Lord Mayor, who, he said,
was busy with a conference of Lord
Mayors of other cities, discussing the
question of raising funds for their
respective needs.
Cr. Sollv said the Minister for
Housing, Cr. Hayes, who was also
Chairman of the City Council’s
Building Committee, could have re-
ported that in the past fifteen years
the overage value of permits issued
bv the City of Melbourne (not
Metropolitan Area) had been
£BOO.OOO, and last year, despite the
Landlord and Tenant Act and other
restrictions, they had risen to
£5.000.000.
Legislation promised by the Gov-
ernment, Cr. Solly said, would make
it possible to demolish some of the
old buildings and erect new ones on
sites in the city.
There was a big programme of
work in the city waiting to be com-
menced, but one of the greatest diffi-
culties in getting it moving was the
shortage of labour. This was a prob-
lem not only for the building indus-
try, but for the whole country. That
would be the main obstruction to an
extensive building programme.
Mr. T. W. Morris. Immediate Past
President of the Association, pro-
posed the toast of “Our Guests,” and
said he was glad to hear Cr. Hayes
speak on co-operation with the
Government.
Mr. Morris jokingly said he sup-
posed they should be happy because
the Government would be able to sell
its homes. It should not be long,
now that the Government was going
into the speculative housing business,
before Mr. Hayes, the Housing Min-
ister, was a member of the Associa'
tion.
Referring to the margins increase,
Mr. Morris said the Government had
indicated that it would meet the
builders and that “they would get a
fair deal.”
Mr. W. Balcombe Griffiths, Fresh
dent of the Royal Victorian Institute
of Architects, responding, said that
those in the design section of the in-
dustry would continue to do all they
could to foster the spirit of co-
operation.
Mr. W. J. Vines, President of the
Building Industry Congress of Vic-
toria, stressed the need for co-
ordination in the industry.
Mr. Vines explained that the Build-
ing Industry Congress was going to
try r. scheme proposed by Mr. Bal-
combe Griffiths. It would put out a
quarterly survey of the industry, and
to do this the 8.1. C. was going to
ask all sections to answer a series of
questions regularly. From these re-
plies a survey of the whole position
could be made. It would be possible
to indicate what work was coming up
in six or twelve months time, to
show what materials were in short
supply and where there was a surplus.
This would enable planners to plan
using materials available and for sup-
pliers to estimate what demand there
would be for their particular pro-
ducts. The success of the project
would depend on the support of in-
dividual members of the industry.
The Dinner was attended by 350
members and guests. All sections of
the building industry were repre-
sented.
£250,000 CENTRE FOR HEALTH
TRAINING.
Singapore is to have an up-to-date
public health training centre, at an
estimated cost of ,£250,000. A grant
of £lBO,OOO towards its cost is ex-
pected from the Colonial Develop-
ment and Welfare Fund. The centre
will probably be in use by November,
1955, said Dr. M. Doraisingham,
Deputy-Director of Medical Services.
Object of the centre is to give local
people training in different aspects of
public health work, so that the ser-
vices can be expanded to the rural
areas.

"A DIP IN THE FUTURE."
It was with this provocative heading—"a dip in the future"—that the upper illustration was featured in the daily Press.
It is a drawing of a proposed sports area which the City Council is proposing for Prince Alfred Park, Sydney, and which
provides for three swimming pools on the site of the demolished Exhibition Building, as well as refreshment rooms, gym-
nasium, and a sports oval. Below is another ambitious project of another type in another country. It is a model of a new
grain elevator being erected at Buenos Aires under the Argentine National Elevator Scheme. It will have a storage capacity
of 150,000 tons and five miles of conveyors will enable it to handle 1,500,000 tons of grain a year. Below this on the right

A number of important buildings to serve many different community purposes are seen in this group. At the top is a sketch
of the new c'assrooms to be erected at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide. Architects are Hassell & McConnell. Alongside is
a drawing showing the premises of the Australian Institute of Management in Queen Street, Melbourne, as they will appear
when completed. Below is a combination sub-station and fire station being erected in Brisbane by M. R. Hornibrook Pty.
Ltd. for the Southern Electrical Authority, and beside it interesting new premises for the E.S. & A. Bank at Burwood, Victoria,
which in its open planning and elevational treatment is very different from the more formidable type of facade usually
favoured by such institutions. Across the bottom is a new Smith-Wesson Co. plant at East Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.
recently completed seven miles from the Company's previous location. It incorporates subterranean tunnels and work vaults

Adelaide News letter
Demolitions to clear three more
sites for major city building projects
will begin early in the New Year.
Blocks to be pulled down include:'
• The Metters building, and adjoin'
ing structures at the corner of
Grenfell Street and Gawler Place —
to make way for an £BOO,OOO 12'
storey block to be raised by St.
Peter’s College.
• A two'storey block at the corner
of King William and Pirie Streets
is to be replaced by the new multi-
storey City Mutual Life Assurance
Society building,
• Harvard Chambers on the eastern
side of the C.O.R. Building, North
Terrace, a £145,000 five-storey
building, is to be erected by
Bagot’s Executor and Trustee Co.
The City Mutual Life Building and
Bagot House are expected to be ready
in about 19 months, and the St. Peter’s
College block in about two years.
Hansen and Yuncken Pty. Ltd. have
obtained the contract for erecting
Bagot House.
Revised plans for building a multi-
storey branch of the Savings Bank of
S.A. at the corner of Hindley and
Bank Streets are still being con-
sidered.
However there is a threat to the
present flurry of big building work in
and around Adelaide. Mr. C. R. Hay,
managing director of Haywire and Co.
Ltd., suppliers of reinforcing steel for
concrete construction work, said this
month that unless supplies of steel ar-
rived soon, major building work would
come to a halt. The position had
deteriorated over the past six months
and was now “hopeless.” Jobs which
he described as “threatened with
strangulation,” included:—
Murray House, a six-storey office
building in Grenfell Street; Angas
House, two-storey office block in
Angas Street; Radio Corporation,
office building, five-storey, in Flinders
Street; Bagot House in North Terrace;
and grandstands at Prince Alfred Col-
lege Oval, Memorial Drive tennis
courts, and Richmond Oval.
Plans to rebuild Myer Emporium
(S.A.) Ltd.’s Rundle Street store have
been announced. The managing dir-
ector (Mr. J. A. Martin) said on his
return from an overseas tour this
months that the present building
would be demolished and replaced by
a modern one of eight storeys. Work
would begin as soon as plans were
completed and materials were avail-
able. The building would be carried
out in sections to enable the store to
remain open for business. At Myer’s
annual meeting this month, the chair-
man of directors (Mr. Norman Myer)
said that the new store would be one
of the finest and most modern in the
world. The present space would
probably be more than doubled, he
added.
Close liaison between the S.A.
Architect-in-Chief (Mr. S. M. Siddall)
and Australia’s leading firm of hos-
pital archi ects is helping to speed
completion of plans for the £4,000,000
Queen Elizabeth Hospital at Wood-
ville. Mr. C. Sharp, of the Architect-
in-Chief’s Department, acting as Mr.
Siddall’s liaison officer, now spends
most of his time in the office of Mel-
bourne architects Stephenson and
Turner. The Department has handed
over all its plans for the hospital to
this firm. The principal of Stephen-
son and Turner (Sir Arthur Stephen-
son) is overseas studying the latest
developments in hospital architecture.
It is expected that these will be in-
corporated in the new hospital.
Stephenson and Turner are working
on the project in conjunction with the
Adelaide firm of Caradoc, Ashton,
Fisher, Woodhead, and Beaumont
Smith.
Jayworth-Besser Ltd., in association
with the Besser Manufacturing Co. of
America, began production of concrete
masonry units this month. Jayworth
executives believe that their new
£lOO,OOO plant at Rosewater will end
South Australia’s persistent brick
shortage. Using a Besser Vibrapac
concrete block-making machine, the
firm has a potential output equal to
50.000. bricks a year. The present
output for the whole of the State is
61.000. clay and shale bricks a
year, but builders estimate their an-
nual requirements at nearer 120 mil-
lion. The new plant will be officially
opened by the Premier (Mr. Playford)
on December 3, and will go into im-
mediate mass production—only ex-
perimental units are being turned out
at present. The Housing Trust will
be among the first to test the new
units, which will be either Adelaide-
size concrete bricks, or “modular
SULPHURIC ACID PLANT AT PORT ADELAIDE.
This aerial photo shows the tremendous strides made over the past few months
in the erection of the £2,000,000 sulphuric acid plant at Port Adelaide. Despite
Industrial troubles, nearly all the surface construction has gone up since April.
The principal contractors, Simon-Carves (Australia) Pty. Ltd., expect to have the
three 60ft. high roaster, tor burning pyrites from the Adelaide Hills, ready by
Christmas. The plant—the biggest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere—will
make Australia's superphosphate supplies more secure.

masonry units,” about Sin. x Sin. x
16in. Each block is “cored” to pro'
vide air space. This reduces weight,
lowers heat conductivity, facilitates
handling, and cuts cost.
Another move to relieve the brick
shortage is being made by Mr. M.
Zwar, a South Australian engineer,
who has just returned from a two-
year “research” tour of Europe. He
intends to establish a factory in South
Australia to produce cream sand'and'
lime bricks. He is already making pre-
liminary enquiries about the setting
up of a company to produce 10 mil'
lion bricks a year. He estimates that
to establish a company, with the neces'
sary land, plant, equipment, buildings,
and working capital would cost
£150,000.
The four commercial airlines ser'
vicing South Australia will begin to
use the new £2,000,000 Adelaide Air'
port at West Beach in December.
This definite assurance has been given
by Mr. N. M. Fricker, supervising
airports engineer of the Department
of Civil Aviation. Mr. Fricker plan'
ned the airport, after choosing the
site more than 10 years ago. Tern'
porary facilities were being rushed
forward 't& enable the opening, he
said. These included a control tower,
and a passenger terminal for all four
airlines. A start had been made on
the foundations of a three-storey per'
manent passenger terminal and control
tower, but this building—estimated to
cost between £lOO,OOO and £200,000
—would not be completed for about
two years. Mr. Fricker said that
when completed, West Beach would
be the finest airport in Australia.
A £30,000 factory and office block
in Daws Road, Cudmore Park, is be'
ing erected under a building system
which is new to South Australia. Con'
struction of the block, for Brownbuilt
(S.A.) Ltd., began a few weeks ago.
The 12,000 sq. ft. building was de'
signed, and is being built bv the In'
dustrial Construction Co., formed in
Adelaide about half'way through the
year. This firm is the first in the
State to adopt the U.S. practice of a
single organisation handling a build'
ing project ffom the design stage to
completion.
The Industrial Construction Co., who
designed the factory, is supplying all
building materials and fittings, arrang'
ing for their delivery, and handling
the building and installation work.
The State Government is making its
third bid since the war to recruit Bri'
tish architects for the South Australian
Public Service. A preliminary survey
is being made in England by the
State’s Agent'General (Mr. Green'
ham). The first recruiting campaign
was made soon after the war ended,
and a second in 1951. The new drive
is regarded as urgent, because the
Architect'in'Chief’s Department is be-
low strength by about 30 architects
and draftsmen. A constant stream of
employees are leaving to take higher'
paid jobs with private firms. The Bri'
tish architects would be under bond
to remain with the Department for
three years.
Executive Council has referred to
the Public Works Committee for in'
vestigation, a Government proposal to
build a new primary school at Ris'
don Park, Port Pirie. The wood'
construction school would comprise 12
classrooms, library, office and other ac'
commodation. The estimated cost is
£37,850.
The Education Department is seek'
ing greater use of private contractors
in an effort to clear up outstanding
school repairs. More than 1,000 small
repair and maintenance jobs are
cluttering up the Architect'in'Chief’s
department at the moment. To get
these works finished, a new system has
been agreed on. Local school com'
mittees have been asked to get local
contractors to tender for each job, and
submit that tender, together with
simple plans and specifications. If ap'
proved by the Architect'in'Chief’s De'
partment the work would be gone
ahead with. When finished and in'
spected by a departmental inspector,
the Government would pay the cost.
A modified proposal for a new
Unley High School—one of the big-
gest school building projects since the
war—has been announced bv the
Minister of Education (Mr. Pattim
son). The new proposal provides for
two units under independent control,
accommodating 890 boys and 710
girls in one sweep of buildings. It is
hoped the first unit will be ready for
occupation by February, 1957, and the
other section a year later. The Archi'
tect'in'Chief’s Department had been
asked to prepare plans of a two-
storev building to avoid the spread of
buildings in the original design. Plans
are expected to be readv shortly, and
v)ill be Submitted to Cabinet.
The cost of the project is not yet
known but is likely to be well below
the estimate of £632,871 for the
original plan.
I. Craven and Co. Ltd.’s store on
the corner of Rundle and Pulteney
Streets, City, will be given a £50,000
facelift during the next 18 months.
Plans to make the 68'year'old build'
ing one of the most moderndooking
in the city have been prepared by
architect E. A. Keal. The transforma'
tion has already begun. As a first
step, the Rundle and Pulteney Street
sides of the three'Storey building will
be faced with cream and burgundy
ceramic tiles. When this is com'
pleted, in about four months, the pre'
sent verandahs, supported by posts,
will be replaced with awnings. Lastly,
new display windows incorporating the
latest ideas in lighting and design will
be installed.
A £25,000 headquarters building
for the St. John Ambulance Brigade
will be built in John Street, Hind'
marsh. Garage facilities for the 14
ambulances, including the latest ideas
for pits, hoists, lubritorium and work'
shops, will form the central part of
the building. Sleeping quarters and
kkchen and bathroom facilities for the
10 night'duty drivers will be provided.
Other features include an administra'
tive block, first aid room, dispatch
and radio room, and recreation room.
Modern color planning and maximum
use of daylight have been included
in the design by the architects, Milne
Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis.
The Peak Construction Co. has the
contract for completing the new ob'
servatqry in the Adelaide University
grounds. The basement, in which the
seismograph is housed, was built in
1941 at a cost of £3,800. Total con'
struction costs are expected to reach
£15,000.
Work on the new roadhouse at the
Salisbury turmoff from the Main
North Road is expected to start
almost immediately. The joint pro'
prietors, Messrs. F. C. and M. A.
Burford, claim that it will be the most
modern buiding of its type in South
Australia. Twenty Tour beds in rooms
serviced with hot and cold water will
be available for overnight customers.
There will be garage space for 24 cars
and a large outdoor park for semi'
trailers and other commercial vehicles.
After importing nearly 4,000 dm'
ber houses from overseas, the S.A.
Housing Trust has decided to embark
on a new programme using Australian
timber. This is stated in the trust’s
recen'.ly'released quarterly report. As
a start. 250 homes will be built in the
metropolitan area, probably at Dar'
lington and Mitchell Park. Eventually
the programme will scatter the dweh
lings over a wide city area. Plans for
five new types of timber houses have
been prepared.
Tenders have closed for erection of
36 houses at South Golflands, to com'
plete the War Service Homes Divis'
ion’s 274'home programme in the
area. Work will start immediately a
contract has been signed. The ten'
ders are for brick houses which will
sell for about £3,300 each. A spokes'
man for the Division said this month
that the houses were expected to be
ready for occupation within 12 months.
Ex'servicemen are playing a major
role in building a new World War II
shrine behind the State War Memorial
on North Terrace. Most men on the
job are veterans of the war. The

PURE IRON IS RUSTLESS.
Crystals of pure iron, stated to be a
thousand times stronger than structU'
ral steel have been developed by
General Electric Co., of Omaha,
U.S.A. Their tensile strength is
1,000,000 pounds per square inch.
The pure crystals of iron do not rust,
because the perfect alignment of their
atoms does not permit oxidation.
This development is one that will
probably revolutionise many theories
and be of considerable potential com'
mercial value.
It is noteworthy that the famous
wrought iron pillar of Delhi, over
23ft. in height and weighing six tons,
which was set up about 415 A.D., is
reputed to be rustless, and it may be
that the art of making pure iron has
been lost until now.

Surveying in Relation to
Builtiers and Building
By CLEM JONES, B.Sc., A.S.M.I.S. Aust., F.R.G.S.
An Address to the Australian Institute of Builders, Queensland Chapter,
at the General Meeting held in Brisbane on August 27, 1954.
In addressing you gentlemen on this
subject to-night, I feel much more
at home than I have been when
speaking on occasions on other sub-
jects. The reason for this is, that I
feel that the surveying profession and
the building industry are very closely
allied and have a great number of
things in common. Furthermore, it
is quite obvious that as far as urban
and suburban land survey work is
concerned a surveyor effects surveys
primarily in order that the land which
he subdivides may be used for build-
ing purposes.
But, more particularly, we have
things in common in our actual work.
Fundamentally, we both commence
our work by the making or laying
down of measurements, and we are
both concerned with measurements or
distances and angles and the observ-
ing and fixing of levels. Additionally,
we both have a considerable amount
to do with plans and drawings.
Generally speaking, the drawings
with which surveyors are concerned
are those which show the work he
has done. Those drawings are then
quite often used by members of the
building trade. On the other hand,
the builder utilises plans which show
the work he has to do. Nevertheless,
the knowledge of and the use of
plans and drawings is a common bond.
Varied Scales.
Speaking af plans leads me to men-
tion a very frequent comment which
I have heard from builders deploring
the use of so many varied scales in
the drawing of survey plans. Quite
often, the use of unusual scales leads
to considerable confusion, not only
with builders, but with architects.
It is, I think, most desirable that
whenever a surveyor is preparing plans
of buildings or allotments which are
to be utilised by members of the
building profession, or by architects,
he should endeavour to prepare them
on plans with scales similar to those
generally used in your industry and
in the architectural profession, namely,
scales of one eighth, one sixteenth,
one thirty-second and so on. The
reason why surveyors use other scales
is that they use a decimal system and
work generally in links, one hundred
of which make a chain, and thus
quite often the most suitable and
easiest scale to use is a chain to an
inch.
The use in certain cases of scales
of one and a half chains to an inch,
two chains to an inch, three chain’
to an inch, etc., is therefore under-
standable. In the other direction we
find scales of so many links to an
inch, usually in multiples of ten, thus
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty and
so on are used. These scales are
most awkward if any scaling is to
be done by those who are not ac-
tually concerned in the survey pro-
fession. Because the scales are not
usually available readily to them it
is a big problem to those not familiar
with the type of calculation involved
to scale off and convert into feet and
inches, with an eighth scale, distances
shown on a plan plotted at say sixty
links to an inch.
Relationship of Links to Inches.
It is, indeed, a great pity that there
are these difficulties which arise from
the utilisation of links in our meas-
urements, and as shown on our plans.
Of course, you will appreciate that
the reason for this is that we adopt
the “acre” and divisions of it in our
areas. An acre is ten square chains
and the links and chains fit in with
calculation of areas in terms of acres,
whereas if we utilised feet we would
have a problem similar to that which
I mentioned in respect to scales, in
order to work out the areas in acres,
roods and perches.
That could, of course, be obviated
by describing the areas of our allot'
mcnts in square feet. In residential
allotments that is quite satisfactory,
except that the use of inches and frac'
tions thereof creates awkward prob'
lems in computing areas, and use
must be made of decimals. But it
becomes a problem when dealing with
areas or parcels of land comprising
thousands of acres. Enormous figures
would be required if you were to
quote these areas in square feet. You
will appreciate that it is hardly prac-
ticable to do so.
Incidentally, this is probably the
reason why our system of measure-
ments was based on the link and
the chain. The subdivisions i n
Queensland were generally large, and
the most simple means of calculating
the areas was to make measurements
in links and chains and so assess the
areas in acres and part thereof. Then
probably because Queensland devel-
oped more slowly than other States
in the urban and suburban sphere,
no action was taken to change the
units for urban and suburban sub-
divisions.
In New South Wales, we find the
position is different in that the country
subdivisions are made and measured
in chains and links and the town sub-
divisions in feet and inches. We
might be a great deal better off if

the same thing applied in Queensland;
but I very much doubt if there will
be any change now when it would
be a truly enormous task due to such
tremendous development in our State.
However, I think that most people
who are associated with land are
gradually learning to convert quickly
links to feet and feet to links, and
although the awkwardness still exists,
I think that we are possibly becoming
used to it.
Alignments.
Talking of urban and suburban
survey makes me think of alignments
which are a most interesting aspect
of surveying and one most vital to
builders because of their very great
importance in relation to buildings
which are built on to them. An align-
ment is of course, simply the line or
the frontage of a block of land which
is coincidental with the road boundary.
But the term “alignment” is quite
often confused the term “official
alignment” which is an alignment de-
clared and laid down in a particular
manner. It is still the road boundary
which is coincidental with the sub-
divisional boundary; but it is not
generally the original surveyed bound-
ary. It is a line laid down and gaz-
etted in a particular position by the
Government and once it has been
determined its existence makes certain
demands on any person who is build-
ing up to it. And that is where it
becomes of interest to builders.
I do not know if all of you are
aware of the requirements and the
position in respect to official align-
ments. They are just this. Any per-
son who is building or making any
alterations to the front of an existing
building, or is rebuilding a structure
which abuts on to an aligned street
must apply to the Government de-
partment concerned for what is known
as an alignment marking. In general,
the application is made through a
surveyor and a fee is paid. The fee
is £B/8/' for what is called a single
marking; that is one street; and
£ll/1/' for a double marking, which
is a marking on a corner where both
streets are aligned. The fee is paid
to the Government and it then in-
structs the surveyor (by the way, it
does not necessarily have to instruct
the surveyor who made the applica-
tion though it is usual to do so) to
place what is known as alignment
spikes.
The spikes are placed on a three
link set-off line to the official align-
ment. A certificate is eventually pro-
deed officially indicating the part of
the alignment marked, and in due
course after the building is com-
pleted, the surveyor is required to
furnish offsets to it to indicate whether
or not the building has been correctly
erected on the alignment of the street.
Quite often the questions are asked
—“Why should we have to pay this
fee? Why should we not simply pay
the surveyor for his work? Why has
the fee to be paid to the Govern-
ment?” Of course, the Government
pays the surveyor some of it back.
This is generally quite an insufficient
amount to cover the work which is
involved to the surveyor in making
the application and fixing the off-set
spikes in a particular position to suit
the builder for the erection of his
building.
However, to answer the queries:
the reason why the fee is charged is
that the Government has to reimburse
or repay the cost of having the orig-
inal work done. Years ago the various
alignment surveys were made to de-
termine proper alignments. They
were most necessary because in many
cases the old surveys were inaccurate
and the buildings on them were hap-
hazardly situated in relation to the
front line. We had fences and per-
haps buildings set out or back in a
most irregular line and it became
essential that something should be
done about it, and the Government
would proceed to have an alignment
survey done. In some cases, I under-
stand, it was just a matter of a Local
Authority deciding to have this survey
work done and paying for it.
In a case of this sort, the alignment
information is available to surveyors
and the Government do not ask for
payment. But in the case of align-
ment surveys in Brisbane, the cost
was borne by the Government and the
fees are charged in order to repay the
cost to the Treasury.
Re-Survey.
While doing alignment surveys quite
often the surveyor is asked to do a
re-survey of the property or to mark
some or all of the boundaries or
corners. Now I do not know if all
of you appreciate how necessary re-
surveys are, or what is the difference
between a survey, a re-survey and an
identification survey.
What we usually call a survey is,
of course, a subdivisional survey,
which in other words is the cutting
up of land into new allotments or
the actual dividing of existing allot-
ments into a lesser or greater number,
or possibly into the same number, but
involving the moving of a boundary
line or lines. A re-survey is simplv a
survey to replace pegs or to place pegs
at corners previously marked. In other
words, to establish boundaries pre-
viously established. It is the third type
of survey mentioned, however, which
causes confusion.
In my opinion, the term identifica-
tion survey should be confined to he
inspection and possibly small amount
of investigation necessary to identify
a certain parcel of land which is
being built on. This survey does not
involve the placing of any marks.
These surveys are most important to
the building profession, and some
builders insist on having an identifica-
tion survey done before they will put
up a building. Others require a sur-
vey, that is, they require new pegs
to be put in and numbered so that
they are quite satisfied that they can
set ou their building from the bound
aries of the block properly established.
As I said, others are quite satis-
fied to set out their building, per-
haps even start it, and then have the
surveyor go out and make sufficient
measurements to enable him to certify
simply that the building is on the
land on which they are supposed to
be building. The same thing applies
to identification surveys of city build-
ings, although there it is necessary
to do a considerable amount more
work to determine whether the build-
ing is on the property, and quite often
what the surveyor does in effect is
a re-survey, because the corners are
actually established.
Indeed a great deal of confusion
between the two terms “re-survey”
and identification survey” exists.
However, they can readily be dis-
tinguished if you look upon a re-
survey as one in which pegs or marks
are placed to define corners, or one in
which corners are defined relative to
some occupational marks; and on the
identification survey as one in which
not attempt is made to establish the
corners accurately, and all that is cer-
tified to is that the particular building
is within its boundaries.
Lodging Plan.
In connection with re-surveys, a
very important thing which some of
you may not know of, is the fact
that the surveyor is required to lodge
a plan. Having done a re-survey,
after having remarked the block, he
is required to lodge a sketch plan in
the office of the Registrar of Titles
within a period of six months, show-
ing the marks placed. Unfortunately,
that requirement is more often hon-
oured in the breach than the obser-
vance, and very, very few surveyors
do, in fact, lodge plans. Now this is
quite wrong. Yet some builders have
said on occasions “I do not want a
plan. All I want you to do is to
place pegs.”
Well, it is, in my opinion, abso-
lutely essential that the plan be drawn
and that that plan should be lodged
in the Titles Office. While the Titles
Office do not examine it, the fact that
it does exist there under the signature
of an authorised surveyor is bona-fide
evidence to the fact that the surveyor
is prepared to stand behind the sur-
vey and is prepared to be responsible
for it. Furthermore, it is evidence of

work that he has done which remains
there for all time and which can be
examined, looked at, and produced in
a court of law, if necessary, at any
time in the future. It is a surveyor’s
guarantee of the work that he has
done.
If you do not have a plan pro-
duced and pegs are just put in, there
is no evidence in the future that those
pegs were put in the right place, or
if it is a question afterwards whether
a building is incorrectly placed, there
is no way of finding out if it was
because those pegs were wrongly
placed, or whether it was because the
building was not built in accordance
with them. If the plan goes into the
Titles Office it can be referred to and,
no matter how long in the future,
investigations can be made to find out
just exactly what did happen.
I believe that if a plan of re-survey
is being prepared in connection with
a parcel of land on which a building
is to be erected up to one or more
boundary lines, the surveyor should
provide two plans. One which goes
to the Titles Office, showing the sur-
vey information, but is of little use
to the builder; the other which should
be drawn showing the boundaries
with the measurements in feet and
inches, and the corners properly re-
ferred to occupation, and with dia-
grams, if necessary, is vital to him.
Off-set marks placed to enable the
builder to off-set back to fix his true
corner or to fix his boundary line,
must be placed on these surveys, and
the second plan should show their
position clearly. I will indicate and
show examples of the type of plan
later when discussing these matters
generally.
One thing I must emphasise at this
stage is the tremendous importance
of having a re-survey or identifica-
tion survey done whenever a build-
ing, even a dwelling house, is erected.
As we are “growing up” in this
State and property is becoming more
and more valuable, the need for this
is more and more serious .
The mention of off-set marks and
boundary lines brings me to the diffi-
culty which often occurs where the
boundary lines are not at right angles
and, in particular, where the side
boundaries are not at right angles to
the frontage. Quite often, off-sets are
placed on the production of boundary
lines, and then the corner of the
building is put in square off to these
marks, as sh»wn on the diagram.
(See diagram on this page.) The
builder thinks that he is building on
the corner, but he is, in fact, building
either inside or outside the corner,
as the case may be, depending on
which way the line is skewed to the
frontage.
Now, alternatively, if the off-set
mark is at right angles to the corner
he quite often thinks that the mark
is on a production of a boundary and
joins it up by a line with the back
corner, and he finds after he is
finished that his building is over the
boundary.
Two Institute Might Agree.
Now, these things can only be
overcome by some uniformity of prac-
tice, <ind to a large extent an Institute
such as this could do a great deal if it
were to discuss the matter with the
Institute of Surveyors, with a view to
laying down a standard which would
be adhered to by all surveyors. There
would be no great difficulty in this,
and it would obviate a lot of mis-
understanding and errors. In fact, a
small handbook could be produced
showing the procedure to be adopted
in general when setting out and mark-
ing corners for the erection of build-
ings on boundary lines.

Whether it is decided to put the
off'set marks at right angles or along
the boundary line produced, or two
marks, one along the boundary line,
and one on the production of each
boundary line, at a specific distance,
or at varying distances —say, two or
three or four feet, depending on
where the marks could be placed con'
veniently is immaterial so long as
we get some uniformity of standard
which makes it reasonably easy for
the builder to follow the marks so
that when he does follow the marks
he is assured of placing his building
in the right place.
The same situation applies to the
placing and showing on plans of
bench marks for levelling purposes.
These things should conform to a
pre'determined standard and practice,
and, in particular, all surveys in'
volving levels should have the levels
referred to State Datum.
Consider Plans.
I do not want to dwell at any
length on the particular work that a
surveyor is required to do in connec'
tion with the actual setting out of
buildings, except to say that there are
a great number of important things
which can be of considerable assist'
ance to builders.
First of all, in connection with
dwellings, of course, the most import-
ant thing is the fixing of external
boundaries, so that the dwelling will
not be built on the wrong property.
You all know the seriousness of erect'
ing a dwelling on the wrong parcel of
land.
Another important factor is the
avoidance of errors which do occur
when setting out from plans. The
surveyor is in a better position to set
out than the builder, mainly because
he has the instruments necessary to
do the work accurately. I feel that
it is never worth the risk taken when
builders set out big jobs themselves.
It is much better to include the cost
of a survey in the tender price.
Scaling off plans can be dangerous,-•
particularly due to paper shrinkage,
which occurs in printing. Laying pffy
specific distances from fixed marks -
is much safer than scaling off plans'.
Surveyors can be of great assistance
in all major building operations if
thev properly establish bench marks
and base lines to assist in setting out,
etc.
Checks of the vertically of columns,
etc., can save tremendous waste in
construction, and these checks can
only be made properly by the use of
a theodolite.
Having mentioned some of the par'
ticular things which a surveyor should,
I feel be called upon to do, I must
mention at least one thing which
should be avoided. This is the plac-
ing of marks in unsuitable positions.
Timber hoardings and shuttering can
and do move, and marks placed in
them are not satisfactory. Marks
should always be placed so that they
will not move or be interfered with.
In conclusion, I would like to
reiterate my suggestion that this Insti-
tute and the Surveyors’ Institute con'
sider together the possibility of laying
down a s'andard procedure in all sur'
veys carried out for building pur'
poses. I hope that in the future the
surveving profession and the building
industry will become more closely
allied with the builders appreciating
how useful a surveyor can be to them,
and the surveyors appreciating just
what is required in order to assist
builders in their most important work.
UPPER LIMITS OF
TRANSMISSION VOLTAGE.
At the bi-anual conference of
C.I.G.R.E. on large electric systems,
progress in technical developments
was reviewed, particularly as to long'
distance, large-scale transportation of
• electrical energy.
I ■ ‘ln recent years the stage has been
'where 400 k.V. level has
;p£pved to be a practicable voltage
range, while in distance 600' to 900'
mile routes have been successfully
spanned in Sweden.
As this year’s conference there was
no suggestion that higher voltages
would soon be necessary (as in pre'
vious conferences); indeed, there
were many pointers to indicate that
50'cycle A.C. systems have reached
their upper voltage limit.
Expense of higher voltage insula'
tion, the cost of substations and other
equipment, corona loss and radio
interference problems would tend to
exercise severe restrictions on future
increases in voltage.
Bri ish, French, German, Italian,
and Swiss systems are built for 300
k.V., but are so planned to allow
adaptation for 400 k.V. In U.S.S.R.
a 400 k.V. line is being built, and in
Japan erious experimental work is
under way for development to in'
creases above its present 275 k.V.
system.
The most commonly used instru'
ment to extend human eyesight is the
periscope. No one .seems to know
quite when it was fiVst used, but the
development of the submarine at the
turn of the century brought it into
prominence.
CHURCH OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
Living up to its claim for modernity, this Trinity Church in Poplar, London, has been raised on the site of its predecessor,
which was knocked flat by a flying bomb in 1944, Simple and unpretentious, the building has been described as the most
outstanding church design to be evolved in Europe since the war. Traditions and prejudices are hard to side-step, but the
architects have done this in their 20th Century design. An impression of the traditional "flying buttress" may be detected
in the modern version concrete framing (centre). The interior is light and airy, somewhat austere, though dignified. The
slender and plain square tower carries the bell, which was all that was salvaged from the previous church. However much
it may be criticised, it is beloved by its congregation who regularly attend its services. —"London Calling."

Any accurate account of the pro-
gress of new building in any cLy
and State at this post-war juncture is
undoubtedly circumscribed by the
shortage of skilled and. to a slightly
lesser degree, of semi-skilled and un-
skilled labour, rather than the lack of
need of more new buildings or the
capital with which to finance them.
Labour Shortage.
It follows as a corollary that, for
the same cause, a shortage of build-
ing materials resul s. When the repre-
sentative of the Queensland Govern-
ment to the last Loan Council meet-
ing complained that the full sum of
his request for loan money for the
current year was whittled down, the
Loan Council’s rejoinder was, in effect
“Why don’t you use the unexpended
balance of last year’s grant?” The
reason was obvious, in the light of the
facts disclosed in the report of an able
research officer of the dady Press. In
it, it is pointed out that 3550 more
men will be needed to carry out the
1954-55 programme of the Queens-
land Dept, of Public Works, entailing
the expenditure of <£18,500,000 more
than the previous year. Without tak-
ing into consideration the needs of
non-Governmental building, the pro-
gramme of the Co-ordinator-General's
Dept, will need 20,496 employees to
expend £58,819,000 provided to carry
out the work plans of the State, in-
eluding semi-Governmental and Local
Governmental activities.
The problem, in this case, will be
largely one of labour insufficiency,
and in this connection it is disap-
pointing to learn that Queensland is
not faring as well as the other States
in attracting skilled migrants. A job
even though probationing of painting
railway trucks, by a migrant commer-
cial artist, must be little better than a
well-conducted prison in one’s own
country.

The Under-Secretary for Public
Works reported that “never in the
experience of the States has there
been the competition for the services
of architects, engineers, quantity sur
veyors, skilled building trades labour,
and building materials that has pre'
vailed m the post-war period now
in its tenth year. Natural results are
delays and high costs of building.
Despite all that this lengthy pre'
amble proclaims, there is an astonish'
ing amount of private building able
to surmount all the attendant dimcul'
ties of men and material shortages
with, no doubt, much mental strain.
The unpopularity of flats because
of the attendance of evils of undesir
able tenants, ' and a Landlord and
Tenant Act that panders to them—
has almost eliminated this class ot
building, there being but three per-
mits in October for two costing £5OOO
each and one combined with store
£7OOO.

from the roof timbers recently, the
Rev. Mr. Trigge did not fail to
observe the “tradition,” but instead
of regaling the artisans on beer he
provided “soft” drinks probably a
novelty to some.
Turning to the subject of water, a
swimming pool which is claimed to be
the most modern at any Australian
school, built at a cost of £10,500, was
officially opened by the Governor, Sir
John Lavarack, at his old Alma Mater,
the Brisbane Boys’ Grammar School.
As a memorial to 255 old boys who
gave their lives in World War 11, a
commemoration stone stands beside
the pool, which is of 25-metre
standard.
A sum of £45,000 is to be spent in
the current year on new tracks in our
National Parks so as to make more of
the beauty spots accessible to Nature
lovers. Tenders have been called by
the Brisbane City Council for six
trolley-buses to serve a new route, the
lowest tender being £29,574 for
chassis, and with locally-made bodies
the total cos" will be £54,000. When
these are ordered, a total of thirty-
three diesel and six trolley-buses will
have cost £260,000.
For a considerable time workmen
have been engaged on a new auto-
matic telephone exchange at Woo-
loongabba (South Brisbane), built at
a cost of £500,000, and the final link
with the network at North Brisbane
is about to be completed by the lay-
ing of thirteen submarine cables on
the bed of the Brisbane River from
Kangaroo Point to Edward Street,
City.
Decentralisation Continues.
The growing policy of many lead-
ing manufacturers to move out is
again in evidence with the opening
of H. V. McKay Massey-Harris
(Qld.) Pty. Ltd.’s new offices, show-
rooms and warehouse,, which cost
£500,000, at Geebung, a northern
suburb eight miles from Central Rail-
way Station. The new railway station
built near the factory has appropri-
ately been nifned “Sunshine,” after
the Melbourne suburb made famous by
the extensive works of the Sunshine
Harvester Coy., now in its seventieth
year of harvester operations that have
extended as far as Canada.
Much further removed from Bris-
bane is the £lOO,OOO farming machine
branch of Hastings Deering (Qld.)
Pty. Ltd. at Dalby, 153 miles west of
Brisbane, recently opened a policy
of decentralisation that will be watched
with no small amount of interest.

city of Mt. Isa—where the Mt. Isa
Mines Ltd. announced a £2,500,000
nett profit, after taxation, deprecia-
tion, etc., and whose employees’
wages, plus bonus, are as luxurious as
the ameni.ies of the town —is to have
a £300,000 hospital, towards which
the Mt. Isa Mines Ltd., with its usual
generosity, is contributing £50,000.
Should it be able to add some of the
rich deposits of radium in this area
to its other mineral productions, as
it promises to do, a veritable Bonanza
is in the offing. Such an acquisition
of real wealth must have a markedly
good effect upon the building of all-
weather roads where they have not
hitherto existed.
Work has commenced on a
£280,000 sewerage plan for the Bris-
bane City Council in which it is in-
tended to serve 2800 improved proper-
ties in six suburbs three each in
North and South Brisbane. There
will be fourteen miles of sewers to
construct. The functioning of the
South Brisbane sewers has been made
possible by the completion of the
Hornibrook under-river tunnel at
Hamilton.
South Coast Progress.
At Southport, the much-opposed
applications for mining the beaches
for Ru'ile, Zircon, etc., have been
withdrawn, and one anxiety, at least,
concerning erosion has been allayed.
The fabulous display of wealth goes
on in buildings. Recently a hotel
building block was sold for £50,000,
and now Southport Motels (Qld.)
Ltd. has been given permission to
build on an area of Teddar Avenue.
In granting licenses to build hotels at
the Town of South Coast, very strict
injunctions are laid down in the build-
ing character these public houses must
maintain.
At a recent meeting of the South
Coast Council, permits for buildings
valued at £138,794 were granted,
bringing the total value of permits
for the four months and a few days
of the 1954-5 5 financial year to
£969,463.
On a one and a half acre block at
Surfers' Paradise, for which £50,000
was naid, it is intended to build a
multi-storied hotel to the highest
American standards. Four houses,
five shops and some vacant land are
embraced by this £50,000 purchase,
the land having a frontage of 200 ft.
to the Pacific Highway. Southern real
estate and hotel proprietaries, of
which Park Line Pty. Ltd., owners of
the Chevron in Melbourne, are pro-
minent, have also purchased Paradise
Island, in the Nerang River, for
£9OOO. With the making of a con-
nection of this island with the main-
land, the possibilities in the utilisation
of this land are as entrancing as its
name implies.
In speaking at the opening of a
new <£6ooo swimming pool at St.
Hilda Girls’ School, Southport, the
Army Minister, Mr. J. Francis, said
that swimming had been made a com'
pulsory item of Army training when
he first took charge.
The State Government is manfully
trying to overcome the shortage of
State schools (and teachers) to ac-
commodate the increasing number of
children each year in excess of those
leaving, and the maximum number of
employees and materials are being
absorbed in the process.
BRICKS FROM FLY ASH.
The disposal of some two million
tons of Fly Ash from the power-
stations of the British Electricity
Authority presents an ever growing
problem. The discovery, however,
that bricks can now be made using
85 per cent. Fly Ash has been an-
nounced by the Department of Scien-
tific and Industrial Research. It is a
welcome one and opens up the pos-
sibility of a profitable and useful in-
dustry.
Although Fly Ash has been used
as a partial substitute for cement in
concrete, and up to 20 per cent, has
been used in brickmaking, the dis-
covery that larger amounts can be used
where a suitable plastic clay is avail-
able has helped to solve the disposal
difficulty.

Gawler, Churcher and Blackett have

Builders Pty. Ltd. for extensions td,

A big building development has
been announced for St. Kilda June'
tion. Recently the Ritz Mansions, a
block of flats, was purchased by the
interests behind the recent acquisition
of Chevron Hotel, on St. Kilda Road.
It is now reported the same interests
have purchased an adjoining block of
old residences. These are to be de'
molished and a two-storey department
store erected at a cost of about
£250,000. It has been suggested that
this building may later be added
to make it a twelve-storey block. The
adjoining Ritz Mansions, now known
as Park Lake Building, would also be
given another three floors.
The ground floor of Park Lake
Building is at present being replanned
as showrooms and offices for Interna'
tional Business Machines Pty. Ltd.
As they become vacant, the upper
floors will be converted into offices
and showrooms.
Melbourne’s city hotels are gradu'
ally disappearing. Two in Bourke
Street have been closed recently. The
National Bank of Australasia Ltd. is
to convert the old Richardson’s Hotel
on the corner of Russell Street into a
branch bank.
Another old landmark closed is
Parer’s Crystal Palace Hotel —recently
known as Usher’s Hotel—in Bourke
Street, between Russell and Swanston
Street. This building, which has a
bis area, was bought by G. J. Coles
and Co. Ptv., and is to be converted
into another city s'ore.
The Commonwealth Bank has just
paid about £70,000 for the freehold
of the old Sir Waber Scott Hotel on
the corner of Elizabeth and Franklin
Streets. It is on land about 75ft. by
90ft. The Bank will replace the
hotel with a branch bank building next
year.
A full report of the revision of
much of the Victorian Uniform
Building RegulaOono will be submitted
to the State Government by the end

The Returned Soldiers’ Association
has purchased" an old property at 15
Collins Street, on the south side, near
Spring Street and nearly opposite
Anzac House. It is reported that the
Association will build a residential
and recreational building on the cite.
For some time the previous owners
had been attempting to sell an “own'
your'own” office venture on the site.
The State Government is going
ahead rapidly trying to catch up with
the needs of the Education Depart'
ment for new schools. Recent con-
tracts let are for new classrooms at
Preston, to G. A. Winwood Pty. Ltd.,
for £16,840; technical school buildings
at Ballarat North to W. G. Feary
Sons, Eureka Street, Ballarat, for
£44,560; similar buildings at William'
town to T. W. Morris & Son Pty.
Ltd. for £44,263, and additions to
the high school at Rosebud for
£32,925 to the same builder. W. and
D. Pitts & Son, of Upwey, have also
been awarded a contract for £33,750
for the first section of a high school
at Lilydale. Overseas Corporation
(Aust.) Limited also have a £23,880
contract for a prefab, high school at
Nhill, and T. W. Morris 6? Son Pty.
Ltd. for £21,350 for more class'
rooms at Harrisfield. At Mananga'
lang a new administrative wing is to
be built to the Consolidated School
by G. A. Winwood Pty. Ltd. for
£24,400.
DON’T LET ATOMS BLIND
SANE FINANCE.
The warning has been made by a
former Atomic Energy Commissioner
of the United States (Mr. Eugene M.
Zuckett) of the danger of over'
optimism that the early appearance of
atomic energy will make existing
plant and processes obsolete.
It would be tragic, he said, if this
idea should result in a tightening up
of finance and caiptal needs for the
advancement of industries using pre'
sent methods.
Momentous accomplishments have
been made in the past twelve months,
but they have merely set the stage for
the development of the industry.
There are still many “headaches” fac'
ing the atomic industry, and the very
rapidity of the advancement has itself
introduced further problems that yet
have to be solved. One of the major
ones is that of greater efficiency in
the utilisation of all our fuels and
the dissipation of released radiation.

Sydney City Council received six
tenders for .construction of its first
parking station, ranging from
£222,000 to £268,000. Lifts and elec'
trical fittings will cost a further
£30,000 to £40,000. The site in
Kent Street, near Erskine Street, will
cost £41,500.
Architects for the station, D. T.
Morrow and Gordon, recommended
the lowest tender (£222,000), submit'
ted by Sir Lindsay Parkinson (Aust.)
Pty. Ltd., Sydney. This has been
accepted by the Council. Other park'
ing stations are planned for other city
sites.
The N.S.W. building industry is
now working at an accelerated pace,
and many big contracts are “on the
boards,’’ being let, or under construe'
tion. School'building has taken a de'
cided spurt this financial year, and
considerable metropolitan and country
work is in process of completion.
Religious denominations are like'
wise implementing many longstanding
projects, including construction of a
“parabolic” ' shaped R.C. church at
Botany, Sydney, and an unusual R.C.
church at Flemington. Its nave will
be twice as long as in an ordinary
church of similar accommodation.
At Marrickville, £40,000 extensions
to St. Brigid’s R.C. church are pro'
ceeding. Its new tower will rise to
nearly 150 ft.
Commercial, industrial, and hotel
buildings are also quickening the
tempo. Woodburn Shire Council re'
cently instituted moves for a first'dass
community hotel -for tourist traffic at
Evans Head. Randwick Council plans
erection of a community hotel, and
many thousands of pounds are to be
spent on extensions and alterations to
three leading King’s Cross hotels.
Many others are listed on a compre'
hensive renovation programme, in'
spired no doubt by prospects of 10
p.m. closing becoming law.
Ryde Council (one of the most
progressive of Sydney metropolitan
municipal bodies) is planning con'
struction of a modern shopping and
community centre. The erection of a
community centre including shops,
offices, restrooms, and an arcade—at
Eastwood is also under way.
There is considerable shop'building
activity in Sydney’s outlying suburbs
and in many parts of the State. The
big chain stores are competing with
one another to obtain and erect —
premises in key positions, and this
struggle for trading supremacy has re'
suited in a tremendous amount of re-
construction work.
Many smaller stores —with or with'
out dwellings—and lock'up shops are
being built, as the phenomenal sub'
urban growth continues. It would be
difficult to estimate just how many
shops of all types are being built, but
it must run into hundreds of thous'
ands of pounds worth.
Government building—both Federal
and State, has gathered considerable
impetus this financial year, especially
in the Federal defence sphere. One
£28,456 job will convert two existing
stores at George’s Heights to officers’
mess and quarters. Other costly works
involve airfields, naval installations,
and air navigational aids.
A huge semi'Government project
recently started in Sydney is construe'
tion of the new Qantas Building in
Hunter Street, to plans of Rudder,
Littlemore and Rudder. Contractors
are Concrete Constructions Pty. Ltd.
The cost has not been announced.
The War Service Homes Division
is calling an increasing number of
tenders, but difficulty is being experi'
enced in obtaining firm price quotes.
Sydney Master Builders have agreed
to accept only tenders with a rise and
fall clause without any time limit.
The State Housing Commission is
experiencing the same difficulties as
the W.S.H. Division. Home'builders
are very chary of firm price tenders,
especially since the margins case de'
cision, it is reliably reported.
The same overall position obtains
in all public tenders, and it is ap'
parent that the builders intend to stick
to their guns, as a result of decisions
reached at the recent Master Builders’
Federation Convention at Hobart.
In the banking sphere, considerable
building activity is reported. Like the
chain stores, trading banks are assidu'
ouslv seeking out key positions in ex'
panding towns and suburbs, and their
architectural divisions are kept busy
planning reconstruction of existing
premises or complete new buildings.
Insurance companies, to o, are
implementing an extensive building
programme throughout the State.
The United Insurance Co. Ltd. and
Mercantile Mutual Co. Ltd. are to
erect r. £49,000 three'Storey building
in Wollongong, to plans of Robertson
and Marks, Sydney. Other insurance
firms are also expanding to Newcastle
and further afield, as well as making
many alterations to existing city
premises.

construction involves many large and
influential manufacturing concerns. I

STREET LIGHTING PROBLEMS.
The Annual Conference of the
Association of Public Lighting Em
gineers (Eastborne, England, Septem-
ber 1954) had placed before it by
its ’President, Mr. L. A. Doxey, of
Leeds, the continued increase in road
fatalities, the majority of which
occur after dark.
Since 1945, the number of motor
vehicles in use in Great Britain has
doubled (now being about 5,000,000)
and is the greatest number per mile
in the world. In the period since
1945 51,000 people bave been killed
on the roads, ancTT*3o,ooo injured.
About 40 per cent, of the fatalities
occurred during darkness (42 per
cent, of the hours), when there was
lit.le vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
No greater contribution could be
made to road safety by night than the
introduction of a high standard of
street lighting. The main obstacle is
not technical, but financial.
The significant period for road acci-
dents is that from 7 a.m. to midnight.
Divided into 1600 hours of night
usage and 4600 hours of day usage
the ratio is 1 to 2.9. The ratio of
night'day accidents for adult pedes-
trians is 1.6 to 1, and for adult pedal
cyclists 0.7 to 1.
It was stressed at the Conference
that a national policy for traffic route
lighting is required, and it is not
necessary for this to conflict with the
local autonomy of the areas through
which they pass to be effective.
LARGE PHILADELPHIA
POWER STATION.
The projected major power station
for Philadelphia will establish new
high levels for efficiency, steam pre-
sure and temperature in steam plant.
The cost will be some 45,000,000
dollars (£A,20,000,000), and it will
contain the largest turbo-alternator
ever built, made by Westmghouse
Electric Corporation.
The alternator will have an output
of 270,000 k.W., and the turbine
steam conditions will be 50001 b./
sq. inch and 1200°F. The speed of
the alternator will be 3600 r.p.m.,
using triple-flow exhaust to condenser
with double reheat.
The generated voltage will be 24
k.V., 60 cycles; separately motor'
driven exciters and magnetic ampli'
fiers to regulate terminal voltage will
form tbe auxiliary equipment.

LOUVRE WINDOWS SPREADING
IN ASIA.
Following the growing popularity
of louvre windows in the U.S.A. and
Australia, a drive is now on to use
this type of ventilation more widely
in Asia. ♦
Enterprising Australians, in fact,
had louvre windows built extensively
into the Australian Pavilion Lself at
the recent Singapore Trade Fair.
These windows, and the exhibits
showing them in detail, attracted con-
siderable attention. There is little
doubt that the demand in Malaya for
louvre windows will increase con'
siderablv as a result of this, for they
seem ideally suited to that country’s
sticky climate, with its usual tempera-
ture of around 85° in the shade.
The louvre windows can extend
from floor to ceiling for the maxi'
mum daylight, if required. They can
be employed in any kind of building.
They are praceful, fitting in with
almost any kind of architecture, and
the Naco type produced by Appleton
Industries Ltd., which has various
branches throughout Australia, has a
patented device giving exact duplica
tion of movement.
Another Australian firm, A.
Agnew & Co. Pty. Ltd., which makes
Supaluvres, uses a gearbox drive for
its windows, operation being by a
handle which winds the windows open
or shut.
RIGGING AND SCAFFOLDING
GUIDE BOOKS AVAILABLE
The Department of Labour and
Industry has issued two books as
guides to riggers and scaffolders set'
ting forth safety measures which
should be adopted and methods of
calculating load factors.
They are profusely illustrated.
The books are available from the
Government Printer. “A Guide for
Riggers” costs 12/6 and “A Guide
for Scaffolders” 7/6.
TRIPARTITE SHELL ROOF
FOR CHURCH.
Concrete shell roof technique has been
adopted in the reconstruction of the
St. Rochus Church at Dusseldorf, shown
here. In radical contrast to the old
neo-Romanesque style of tower (on the
right), from which it is physically (and
spiritually) removed, the roof of the
new church consists of three identical
concrete shells, based on the centre
points of an isosceles triangle, and
linked together with annular ribs. The
concrete shells are 1½ inches thick.
