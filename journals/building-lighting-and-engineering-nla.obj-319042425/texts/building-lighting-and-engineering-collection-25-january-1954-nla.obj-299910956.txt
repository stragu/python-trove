The all-aluminium Kingstrand house can help to meet
the requirements of housing difficulties in many parts of
the world.
The lightness of the housing-unit enables easier handling
with a considerable saving in transportation and erection
costs.
The outstanding characteristics of aluminium include
high resistance to corrosive atmospheres, imperviousness
to termites and vermin and the ability to reflect a high
percentage of all radiant heat so that rooms can be kept
at more moderate temperatures in tropical areas.

It expels stuffy air, frees the kitchen of cooking odours, and whisks
away steamy heat, thus reducing condensation on the walls.
The unit consists of an efficient 9-inch extraction fan housed in a neat
metal casing which incorporates a telescopic duct, enabling the unit
to be easily installed in walls and partitions of different thicknesses.
The shutter completely shuts out back draught when the fan is not

Council regulations and building practice call for

Timbrock board gives you the equivalent of three
18" panels. Also, two TIMBROCK 4' 6" boards
placed horizontally give the standard 9' ceiling

Precasting concrete beams and lintels enables them to be made in a factory where efficient
conditions of manufacture give a cheaper and better quality product. There is no delay to
building construction whilst formwork is prepared for cast in place units and whilst the concrete
hardens. Bricklaying can be continued over precast beams immediately they are in position.
Prestressing enables longer beams to be precast and handled into position than would be possible
if they were normally reinforced. It reduces the depth of beam necessary for a given span
thus increasing the under clearance.

EDITORIAL.
AN EVENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
The announcement that the Royal Institute of British Architects is awarding
the Royal Gold Medal for 1953 to Mr. A. G. Stephenson (of Stephenson & Turner),
of Melbourne, is an event of some significance not only to the Architectural Pro-
fession, but to the British Commonwealth.
The R.1.8.A. was founded in 1834 and to-day with a membership of over
21,000 throughout the world is the leading architectural organisation amongst
British people and one which is greatly respected and exercises considerable influence
throughout the world. That it has the vision and energy to keep abreast with the
times is perhaps nowhere better illustrated in its many-sided ramifications than in
the annual awards of the Royal Gold Medal —the blue riband of the Architectural
world.
Initiated by Queen Victoria in 1848, the Medal has been awarded every
year since (with two exceptions) and the list of recipients, as set forth in the
R.1.8.A. Kalendar, may be said to embrace the leading architects of the past cen-
tury. Although the majority of the recipients were British the Council was not
insular and the work of a number of leading European architects was recognised
and embraced Austria, Italy, France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Finland and
U.S.S.R. They looked across the Atlantic too and made awards to U.S.A. and to
Canada. The architectural outlook also was not ultra-conservative or “stuffy” as
some would have us believe such venerable and ancient bodies can become, for
such controversial figures as Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier have been
honoured for their contributions to architectural progress.
Now they have extended their ga*e half-way around the world to a land
that was but “a geographical expression” when King William IV. granted the
R.1.8.A. its Royal charter, and recognised that an Australian Architect and his
work in Australia is worthy of joining this distinguished company.
The significance is twofold: a recognition of our cultural maturity on the
one hand and on the other that the Mother Country is, perhaps, looking more
earnestly within the British Family of Nations.
That the Queen will present this Medal in Australia instead of London
emphasises the new global conception of the Commonwealth.
The fact that Her Gracious Majesty will be away from the United Kingdom
for several months visiting the other Nations of the Commonwealth over which she
rules, is also an event of importance and significance, for it is the visible manifestation

NEW MUNICIPAL LIBRARY
AND BABY HEALTH CENTRE
BURWOOD, SYDNEY.
Much is bespoken these days about
the need for Community Buildings
and amenities in our suburbs for the
public generally. Special mention be-
ing given to such services as Baby
Health Centres for pre-natal and post-
natal care and such cultural services
as municipal libraries.
The Burwood Council is therefore
much to be commended on its en-
lightened move in building a com-
bined Library and Baby Health Centre
group.
The approach adopted by the ar-
chitects, D. T. Morrow 6? Gordon,
has been towards the easy and correct
functioning of both units, bearing in
mind that due to the position of the
site, the building must present an in-
teresting aspect from Burwood Road:
One reason being to encourage those
people not ordinarily interested in
such institutions or unaware of their
existence come and see them and
having once received their benefits
*o make use of them.
Hoods Deflect Sun,
Certain features have been incor-
porated which while different from
ordinary treatments have a practical
application. Because of the view from
the direction of Burwood Road, and
because of the need for natural light,
windows were considered necessary in
the western wall of the Children’s
library. The splayed hood, with the
wide overhang helps to keep the af-
ternoon sun out of the windows. The
rays of the sun when coming low
from due west are to a large extent
blocked by the buildings opposite.
Venetian blinds are installed through-
out for extra protection.
The front entrance to the library
is designed on the same basis as the
window hood.
Another external feature is the type
of brickwork used. The brick is only
2” deep and has a half inch joint cut
off flush; the effect being different
and in keeping with the building.
Maximum controlled lighting is a
necessity in the library, the verticality
of the mullion treatment lending a
quiet dignified air traditionally asso-
ciated with books.
Planning features include maximum
facilities for the staffs of each unit:
Nurses’ room next to kitchen in Baby
Health Centre and special room ad'
jacent to work room in library.
Sheltered Sun Terrace.
Adjoining the Baby Health Centre
Waiting Room on the north side is a
sheltered sun terrace and an outdoor
play area for older children who are
too young for school and who cannot
be left at home. Clear vision allows
mothers to keep a watchful eye on
things outside. At one end of the
Waiting Room is a Play Pen for tod-
dlers and a showcase for display of
things appropriate to Baby Health.
In both the Library and the Baby
Health Centre children are well cat-
ered for, the Library, devoting a spec-
ial section to them with books for all
age groups.
The Library vestibule features a
glass partition with an arrangement
of vertical fins and a showcase for the
special display of books. The con-
struction allows for full supervision of
the case rack and cloak annexe at the
other side of the entrance. Vertical
fins are also a feature of the entrance
to the Baby Health Centre at one
side of which is the pram park.

PYRMONT “B” POWER STATION, SYDNEY
DEVELOPMENT OF HUGE PROJECT.
100,000 Kw. Now Operating.
In the years when power blackouts
threatened to wreck industry with the
constant interruptions to operations,
the completion of the vast Pyrmont
Power Station that was to give such
welcome relief assumed the qualities
of a mirage. Its completion seemed
to recede as the cost ever increased.
But like most trials that are laid upon
the human race it was endured and in
due course came the dawn, when, in
July, 1952, the first 50,000 kW turbo'
alternator unit was commenced, to be
followed by the second in March,
1953, bringing such welcome extra
capacity that together with the other
extra sources that were becoming avail'
able, blackouts have become fewer and
fewer and the bad old days of candle'
light for dinner five nights a week
seem almost remote. May they stay
that way.
' . ri ,
Ihe construction of a maior power
station of this type is a huge and com'
plicated undertaking by any standards
and requires the concerted efforts of
many specialists and experts. In the
accompanying article, prepared with
the assistance of the Electricity Com'
mission of N.S.W., we give a short
description of the main features of the
Pyrmont “B” plant.
The power station, planned origin'
ally by the Sydney County Council,
j s now integrated in the Electricity
Commission of New South Wales’ In'
terconnected System following the ac'
quisition by the Commission on Ist
January, 1952, of the generating sta'
tions and main transmission lines for'
merly operated by the Sydney County
Council.
Pyrmont “B” will consist, ultimate'

units, each with its own steam genet'

The plant is designed so that each
of the four boilers has steaming cap'
acity adequate to meet the require'
ments of one turbo'alternator unit op'
crating at its maximum continuous and
most economical rating of 50,000 kW.
Inter'connection is provided between
the steam and feed mains of all units,
but the steam main interconnections
are normally not in service. Their
use is restricted to such situations as
the need to make use of a surplus of
boiler capacity resulting from the sim'
ultaneous reduction in output of a non'
paired boiler and turbine, or as requir'
ed during the start-up of a turbine in
order to provide steam at the requisite
eluding a contact type de-aerator, are
however, practised on the feed mains,

and for the period ended 30th June,
1953, which represented almost twelve
months commercial service for the first
unit, the overall efficiency of the first
boiler'turbine unit was 29.9% on a
generated basis and 27.8% on a sent'
out basis.
Availability of the plant has been
good, as evidenced by the load factor
of 88% for the first unit for the per'
iod ended 30th June, 1953. These
figures have been achieved using coal
of an average gross calorific value of
10,740 B.Th.U./lb. on an asffired
basis
The Four Turbines.
All four turbines are similar, and
are of Metropolitan'Vickers manufac'
ture, of the three cylinder, impulse
type. Five stages of feed heating, in'
eluding a contact type de-aerator, are
employed, drains from H.P. heaters
cascading to the lowest pressure H.P.
heater whence they are pumped by a
heater drain pump to the condensate
line. Drains from L.P. heaters cascade
to the lowest pressure heater and flow
finally to the condenser.
The condenser is a twin shell type
manufactured in Australia by Thomp'
sons (Castlemaine) to the design of
the turbine manufacturer, and is cool'
ed by salt water pumped by two muh
ti'speed vertical axial flow pumps from
a closed conduit connecting the sta'
tion with Jones Bay, Darling Har'
hour. Salt cooling water is screened
by vertical travelling screens located
in the conduit adjacent to the turbine
house, and chlorinating plant is pro'
vided to combat the formation of ma-
rine growth in condenser tubes.
Boilers Use Pulverised Coal.
The boilers have been manufactured
by International Combustion Limited
and are fired by pulverised coal and
four pulverising mills are provided per
boiler, the first unit being fitted with
Lopulco LMI2 mills and the second
with Raymond Bowl Mills.
Coal burners are of the tangential
tilting type, one burner being located
in each corner of the furnace. Each
mill has an outlet to each of the four
burners so that symmetrical firing con'
ditions are maintained regardless of the
number of mills in service. The tilt'
ing of the burners may be employed
to control superheat temperature and
the formation of slag on tube sur'
faces, but automatic superheat temper'
ature control is additionally provided
in the form of nomcontact type desup'
erheaters located between primary and
secondary sections of the self'draining
superheaters.
The combustion chamber is lined
with finned tubes, the rear wall tubes
being staggered at the gas exit from
the furnace to provide a slagging

screen. Gas flow in the furnace is in
a downward direction, through the
slagging screen, and then vertically up'
wards, passing in turn across the sec'
ondary and primary sections of the
superheater, the continuous welded
gilled tube economiser and through
twin Howden Ljungstrom air heaters.
From the air'heaters the gas passes to
twin Lodge' Cottrell electrostatic pre'
cipators and is then delivered by two
induced draft fans to a self-supporting
steel stack carried by the boiler-house
steel structure. This stack is of butt-
welded mild steel construction, lined
internally with Staniforth acid-resisting
lining and is fitted with a venturi sec-
tion at the discharge throat to increase
gas velocity and thus assist in dispersal
of stack gases. The top of the stack
is 360 feet above mean sea level.
Coal Handling Plant.
Provision is made for handling eith-
er road or rail borne coal into the sta-
tion, separate hoppers being provided
for road and rail deliveries. Rail
trucks are unloaded, either by gravity
in the case of bottom dump wagons,
or by grab cranes of a capacity of 160
tons/hour, the cranes being housed
in a building spanning the tracks into
the station.
From the road and rail hoppers,
coal is elevated into the station by
rubber belt conveyors, duplicate belts
of a capacity of 200 tons/hour being
provided. Magnetic pulleys are pro-
vided for tramp iron separation, and
automatic belt weighers are fitted to
those conveyors which feed on to the
tripper belts above the boiler'house
bunkers.
Coal for the stock'pile is delivered
by a belt conveyor and fixed chute,
in one of the conveyor transfer
houses, to the storage area, to be
spread by a bulldozer. Reclaimed
coal is also handled by bulldozer and
is returned to the rail track hoppers
for elevation to the boiler house
bunkers, which have a capacity of ap-
proximately three thousand tons for
2'50,000 kW units.
Ash and Dust Handling Plant.
Furnace ash and dust from all points
on the boiler are handled by a pneu-
matic conveyor system supplied by
B.V.C. Industrial Constructions. Three
stages of separation, including, finally
automatically shaken bag filters are
used to separate the ash and dust from
the conveying air before the latter
passes through the motor driven cen'
trifugal exhausters used in the system.
From storage hoppers in the ash
and dust handling building the refuse
is fed to inclined rotating drum con*
ditioner conveyors where it is wetted
by spraying and then loaded into
road vehicles for haulage from the
site.
Alternators.
The alternators are of Metropolitan
Vickers design and construction, rated
at 50,000 kW at 0.90 power factor
and generating at 3 3,000 volts.
The alternators are air cooled by
fans external to the rotor, cooling air
flowing in a closed circuit through
ducts formed in the alternator block.
Electrically, each generator is con'
nected via a reactor through a circuit
breaker rated at 1000 MVA to its own
generator group bus. This is connect'
ed by a 1000 MVA breaker to a feed'
er group, and by a further 1000 MVA
breaker and a reactor to a synchros
ising tie bus to which power'Station
interconnector transformers are con'
nected.

THE COAL HANDLING PLANT AT PYRMONT “B”
MALCOLM MOORE INSTALLATION.
An extensive coal handling plant,
designed and built by the Malcolm
Moore Engineering organi sat i o n
through its subsidiaries, Springvale
Conveyor and Engineering Company
and Moore Crane and Engineering
Company, is now in operation at Pyr'
mont “B” Power Station.
This vital power plant, controlled
by the Electricity Commission of New
South Wales, occupies a key position
in the supply of power to some of
the most important industries in the
State.
It is estimated that half a million
tons of coal will be handled by the
plant each year to create the power
necessary to generate 200,000 kW cap'
acity of this section of the station.
The importance of a belt conveyor
system in this type of installation is
obvious —no other method can con'
vey and elevate with the same degree
of efficiency or reliability.
A constant supply of coal to the
boilers is ensured by a duplicate line
of conveyors, comprising five sets of
two parallel conveyors, each with a
normal capacity of 200 tons per hour.
An additional conveyor is provided
to divert coal from the main lines to
a storage area adjacent to the rail
hoppers.
OVERHEAD CRANES AT PYRMONT "B"
MOORE CRANE COMPANY.
These three overhead travelling grab cranes installed at Pyrmont "B" Power
Station unload coal from flat-bottomed rail trucks by means of telpher-operated 2½
cu. yd. grabs. The cranes, designed and built by Moore Crane Company, are part
of the complete coal-handling installation supplied by the Malcolm Moore engineer-
ing organisation.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Unloading of Trucks.
A double line of track hoppers is
provided to allow hopper type rail-
way trucks to be discharged by gravity.
The rail truck unloading station is
also equipped with three overhead
travelling grab cranes for unloading
flat bottomed trucks. These operate
on one runway and have a span of
41ft. over two sets of rail tracks:
each is equipped with a 4 c. yd. grab.
A filtered and heated air supply to
the telpher cabins permits the crane
operators to work without discomfort
from coal dust.
Hoppers Pneumatically
Controlled.
The rail track hoppers are fitted
with eight gates and road hoppers with
two gates, for loading their respective
conveyors.
These feed gates are pneumatically
operated from controls placed at
ground level. The controls for the
rail hopper feed gates are arranged
with a mechanical interlock to prevent
the opening of more than one gate to
each line of conveyors. An electrical
interlock prevents coal from the rail
hoppers being loaded on to the belts
while the road hopper feed gates are
in operation. This system is necessary
to prevent overloading of coal to the
conveyor belts with consequent spill-
ing along the conveyor line.
Conveyors 2A and 2B run beneath
the rail track hoppers.
Removal of “Tramp-Iron.”
From the tunnel the conveyors rise
through an inclined gallery on to con-
veyors 3A and 38. These have wide
(48 inch) belts operating at a slower
speed to spread the coal and so facili-
tate the removal of “tramp-iron” by
magnetic head pulleys in the convey-
ors.
To provide maximum metal remov-
al, a special chute arrangements per-
mits the flow of coal from either con-
veyors 2A or 2B to be divided equally
between the two belts 3A and 38.
After passing the magnetic pulleys the
coal may be brought back to a single
stream on either conveyors 4A or 48.
Conveyors 3A and 3B also extend
under the road receiving hopper. An
interlocking device prevents coal be-
ing fed from the road hopper to a
belt which is already transporting coal
from the rail track hoppers.
Elevating to the Power House.
The conveyor system rises more
than 120 feet through inclined gal-
leries to the boiler house bunkers.
Conveyors 4A and 4B elevate to
the junction point of conveyors 5A
and 58, where a conveyor (No. 7) is
provided to divert coal from either of
the main lines to a storage area ad-
jacent to the rail track hoppers. When
required, stored coal is pushed into
the underground hoppers by a bull-
dozer and again travels the conveyor
line.
Delivery Chutes.
A special arrangement of chutes
permits diversion of coal from one
conveyor line to the other at certain
transfer points.
This important feature, not only
enables the splitting of one conveyor
load over the two magnetic head pul-
leys as already described, but also
provides an additional safeguard
against interruption of coal supply be-
tween the receiving hoppers and the
boiler house bunkers.
Selection and operation of chute
gates is by hand, but all gates are fit-
ted with position switches connected
with the electrical interlocking system
to prevent coal being delivered to a
stationary belt.

PYRMONT "B" BOILERS.
INTERNATIONAL COMBUSTION AUSTRALIA LIMITED.
Above is a view of a model of one of the boilers installed by International Com-
bustion Australia Limited, at Pyrmont "B" Power Station. Sydney. Four such
units will be installed upon completion of the project. Each is rated to supply
430,000 lb. per hour of steam at 1,250 p.s.i. The final steam temperature leaving
the superheater is controlled at 925°F. These units, the largest in Australia, are a
tine example of modern design and practice, and incorporate pulverised fuel-firing
with corner tilting burners. The high, totally water cooled combustion chamber en-
sures maximum radiant heat transfer which permits inherent operational flexibility
and ability to burn coals of varying characteristics at high efficiency without
slagging. Supervision from a central control room reduces manpower requirements
to a minimum. Two boilers have now operated over 17,500 steaming hours, and
the availability, including statutory overhauls, has averaged 93.5 per cent. This
and low maintenance costs have proved the adequacy of the design.

route has been selected.
The system of interlocking relays
incorporates all belt conveyors and
•auxiliary equipment including manu-
ally operated chute gates.
The function is to prevent a route
being set whereby one belt can be
fed with more than the normal amount
of coal.
When pre-selection is completed the
master button is pressed and all belts
start in their correct sequence.
In order to ensure that the entire
conveyor line is running before coal
leaves the hoppers, the last belt starts
first. This is indicated by the illumin-
ation of that section changing to red.
One belt after another automatically
starts up, until the whole line i$ in
operation and a continuous red line
illuminates the panel.
Should one belt stop because of a
fault, the corresponding strip shows
green again and an audible signal
sounds on the alarm system incorpor-
ated in central control. By means of
special local selector switches, it is
also possible to start or stop any con-
veyor, for maintenance purposes, from
a position adjacent to its drive.
When a conveyor is in local control
however, movements are still recorded
on the illuminated control panel.
Dust Minimisation.
In the operation of belt conveyors,
dust from dry coal is created at loading
and transfer points. In this installation
all loading points and delivery chutes
are completely enclosed, to check dust
escaping into the surrounding area.
These chute enclosures are fitted with
rubber sealing strips extending to the
belt and multiple soft rubber curtains
are provided at belt entries and exits.
In addition, ventilation pipes are pro-
vided to release any air pressure which
would tend to force dust past the rub-
ber curtains. The ventilator pipes,
which pass to the outside of the con-
veyor galleries, may be seen over the
drive pulley.
Coal Weighing.
To record the weight of coal pass-
ing to the Boiler House Bunkers,
“continuous weighers” are located on
belts 5A and 58. These weighers are
well-known “Blake-Denison” type.
Motor Driven Trippers.
The conveyor belts 6A and 6B
above the bunkers are fitted with
motor-operated tippers which distribute
the coal evenly to the bunkers through
dust-proofed chutes.
Dust-Proofed Bunkers.
The tripper chutes project into ver-
tical bunker openings provided with
heavv, continuous rubber curtains
which effectively close the opening.
Tripper chutes are streamlined to
reduce the opening in the curtains
thus keeping the escape of dust to a
minimum.
Installation Details.
Total length of conveyors installed
is approximately 2,200 feet, and all
belts are 30” wide except those of
3A and 38. Standard “Springvale”
“O” type medium duty idlers are
used throughout.
Belt conveyors and associated equip-
ment were designed and built by
Springvale Conveyor and Engineering
Company Pty. Ltd., Springvale, Vic-
toria.
The three overhead travelling grab
cranes were designed and built by
Moore Crane and Engineering Com-
pany Pty. Ltd., Williamstown Road,

WORK RESUMED ON BERGER HOUSE
SYDNEY CITY BUILDING TO BE COMPLETED.
After a period of inactivity, con'
struction work on Berger House, El iz'
abeth Street, has been resumed.
Stephenson and Turner are the ar'
chitects for the completion of this
16'floor building, and C. A. Gaskin
Pty. Ltd., Master Builders, carrying
out the building contract.
Gaunt Steel Structure.
Berger House was the first big con'
struction project to be commenced in
Sydney since 1939. Work began
in 1952, but was suspended in
the following December. For almost
a year the gaunt steel structure stood
as a silent reminder to passers-by of
the difficulties which prevent practh
cally all types of commercial and in'
dustrial building today.
Among the obstacles to expansion
and progress are the high costs of
building, rent controls (which are so
low as to discourage all investments)
and the rigid restrictions on building
finance during the past two years.
At the present time —despite optim-
istic predictions—a complete famine
in this class of finance has caused the
abandonment of most types of build'
ing. This, plus the actual costs of
construction, makes new city projects
uneconomic.
For example, the construction of
Berger House had begun on a basis
of £7 a square foot early in 1952,
but by December, 1952, increased
costs had boosted the estimate to over
£lO a square foot.
BERGER HOUSE, ELIZABETH STREET, SYDNEY.
Artist's sketch of Berger House, Elizabeth Street, near King Street, which will be completed by next December. Plans for
the completion of this 16-storey structure were prepared by the architects, Stephenson and Turner, and construction is being
carried out by C. A. Gaskin Pty. Ltd., Master Builders, Sydney.
January 25, 1954.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Mr. J. K. Morley, original manager
for the erection of Berger House, es-
timated last May that it would take
£lO,OOO to build 1000 square feet of
office space (“Construction,” 3/6/53,
p. 15).
Allowing a gross 9% for rates,
charges, and so on, this would mean
that a rental of £9OO a year or nearly
£lB a week would have to be charged
to cover the capital cost for each 1000
feet of floor space.
Initial Capital Issue.
The initial capital issue for Berger
House was about £lBO,OOO, and there
were about 30 shareholders in the ven-
ture, including companies, barristers,
solicitors, and other professional men
requiring office space.
When construction started the cost
was provisional—based on the actual
cost of building, plus overhead ex-
penses.
L. J. Hooker Ltd. took over the
management of Berger House from
J. K. Morley Ltd. last year, and a
change in architects was made. It is
understood that fresh tenders were
also called for the completion of the
building, which was originally com-
menced by the present builders, C. A.
Gaskin Pty. Ltd.
A representative of L. J. Hooker
Ltd. told our representative that the
full capital for Berger House has been
obtained, and all contracts have been
let.
He said it was anticipated that the
building will be completed by next
December.
A very substantial area of the floor
has already been sold to shareholders,
and only a small area now remains
available at the moment, he added.
The 16 floors will be entirely oc-
cupied by leading city firms and pro-
fessional men, and the list of share-
holders is a most impressive and rep-
resentative one.
The floors will be served by two
high-speed elevators, and the building
will be a splendid asset to Sydney.

Glazebrooks Paints Australia Pty.
Ltd. was formed in Australia in 1932
to manufacture products of Glaze-
brooks Limited, Birmingham, England
—in particular, Permoglaze, a special
type of enamel which excelled the
old-type enamels (the English com-
pany is now known as “Permaglaze
Limited”).
Melbourne Factory Built.
By 1938 the company had made a
place for itself in Australian indus-
try, but expansion plans were delayed
by World War 11., when the complete
resources of the company were requi-
sitioned for defence and essential ser-
vices. In 1945 the company, still
young but progressive and far-sighted,
commenced building operations on five
acres of land at Fishermen’s Bend.
The factory was built on the most mod-
ern lines and executives were sent
overseas to study the latest methods
in paint manufacture and to buy the
necessary equipment.
The Glazebrooks building at Port
Melbourne now occupies 60,000 sq.
ft. of the five-acre site. In addition
to the new factory. Sales and Admin-
istrative offices have been extended
and a large Employee Welfare Centre
Building and a Colour Advisory Ser-
vice building have been erected. In
addition to their site at Port Mel-
bourne, Glazebrooks have purchased
100 acres of land along the Geelong
railway line in Altona, which is being
held for future development.
In addition to the association with
Glazebrooks in England, Glazebrooks
by this time had linked up with the
Glidden Company of America and
right was granted to manufacture their
paints in Australia as soon as import
restrictions allowed.
Sydney Plant.
A site was purchased at Short
Street and Wattle Road, Brookvale,
and a new plant with an area of
40,000 sq. ft. has been erected.
Other structures house varnish-
cooking and raw material storage sec-
tions.
As well as the two main paints
manufactured by Glazebrooks, viz.,
Permoglaze and Tenox, they produce
a complete range of trade lines and
special industrial finishes such as
floor stains and varnishes,
Glazebrooks’ aluminium enamel,
opako water paint and rusta resta roof
paint.

SIR HARRY PILKINGTON
Head of British Glass Firm
Knighted.
Since 1826, when the family bush
ness of Pilkington Brothers Limited
was first started, the direction of the
firm has remained largely in the hands
of successive generations of the
Pilkington family.
Sir Harry Pilkington. a great'grand'
son of the Founder and the son of a
former Chairman, William Henry
Pilkington, who was recently knighted,
is the sixth member of his family to
be Chairman of the firm.
Sir Harry started with the firm
twenty'six years ago after leaving
Cambridge, and after learning the rudh
ments of the commercial side of the
firm’s activities he spent some time at
home and in Canada, becoming a
director in 1934 and succeeding Mr.
Geoffrey Pilkington as Chairman in
1949.
As befits the head of a large indus'
trial organisation, Sir Harry is one of
the acknowledged leaders of British
industry and has been elected Presh
dent of the Federation of British In-
dustries, the principal national or'
ganisation representing the whole of
British productive industry.
As head of a firm using some
500,000 tons a year, he is acutely
aware of the importance of coal, and
has for some time devoted much time
and energy to the problem of secun
ing the most economic and efficient
use of all forms of industrial power.
He has been Chairman of the F. 8.1.
Fuel and Power Consumers’ Policy
Committee and a member of the
Government’s Industrial Coal Com
sumers’ Council since its inception.
Sir Harry lives in St. Helens, the
home of the great Pilkington organisa*

Fight the New
Despotism
Crisis in Personal Freedoms.
The year 1953 is one that history
may record as a turning point in the
liberty of the subject—in N.S.W., at
least.
For the past 25 years successive
Federal and State Governments have
been piling power on power to order
our private lives until, in 1953, the
N.S.W. Government commands more
tyrannical authority than it has done
since the convict days. Ministers are
drafting regulations, neither debated
in the Legislative Assembly nor inter'
preted in the Courts.
Liberty Restricted.
They restrict our liberties, our free'
doms of speech, of movement, and of
action, and force us, against our will,
into compulsory membership of trade
unions.
Government today can deprive us
of our homes and gardens under Plan'
ning Acts. It can —and does —set up
Boards to control our lives, and the
very bread we eat —its price and qua!'
ity. One cannot move into a new
home and transfer one’s milkman. A
milkman’s permit to serve has to come
from the Milk Board.
It can amend or modify Acts of
Parliament by regulation—in fact, do
almost anything it likes except im'
prison us without trial.
New Despotism.
If this new despotism is allowed to
continue, and even if the Socialist
Government goes on exercising its
powers with the lack of restraint it has
shown so far, N.S.W. will be a total'
itarian State within most of our lives.
We are facing a crisis in our per'
sonal freedoms, which will expose us
to regulations and snoopers, to re-
straints and restrictions unheard of in
countries which reiterate that almost
forgotten line, “Britons never shall be
slaves.”
Something must be done to arrest
the insidious march of totalitarism
which will lead us, in effect, down
that slope which ends a' he precipice
over which Czechoslovakia tumbled
five years ago.
That such a warning is necessary is
an unhappy commentary on democ-
racy as it exists in N.S.W. todav.
And democracy, our politicians should
learn, is not irreconcilable with per'
sonal freedom.

Polythene Tubing for Water Supply
EXTENSIVE BRITISH USE.
For some years now, millions of
feet of polythene tubing have been
in use in Britain. Discovered in
Britain in 1933 by a team of research
chemists, polythene was used almost
entirely for its electrical and insulat-
ing properties when first developed
on a commercial scale. Two years
ago, however, specifications for its
use on a wider scale were submitted
to the British Standards Institute by
the British Plastics Federation, and
one of the first water engineers to
carry out large scale installations of
this material in domestic water supply
was Mr. N. J. Pugh, city water en-
gineer of Coventry, who at that time
was chairman of the 8.5.1. technical
committee.
Many Advantages.
Main advantages claimed for the
tubing are that it does not corrode;
can be produced as a continuous ex-
trusion; supplied in lengths up to
500 ft., as compared with the 22ft.
maximum length for steel tubing;
that it is eight times lighter than steel
and up to 11 times lighter than lead;
and that it can be coiled and laid by
mole-plough. It is also claimed that,
because of its insulating properties,
water in it is less likely to freeze, and
if it does freeze, the tubing will not
burst because of its elasticity. An
example of its lightness is that a 500
ft. length of -gTn. internal diameter
polythene tubing can be carried on
the shoulder of one man.
Uses for the tube include: Cold
water supply for human consumption
and domestic and industrial plumbing,
including mains; water distribution of
all kinds, including agricultural pur-
poses, parks, golf courses, etc.; buried
or external pipelines on farms, etc.;
water supply on civil engineering and
building sites; and emergency water
supplies—as used in Lynmouth and
the flooded coastal areas recently.
Various sizes of polythene tubing
conforming to the British Standards
were shown recently at the British
Plastics Exhibition at Olympia, Lon-
don.

“Bold Programme” For Victorian Housing
£12,000,000 ALLOCATED FOR PROJECTS.
The Victorian Housing Commission
built 2685 houses and flats in the 10
months from January 1, 1953, to Oc-
tober 31. Of these, 1464 were in
Melbourne, and 1221 in the country,
the Premier, Mr. Cain, said last week.
In the same period, contracts had
been let for building another 1963
houses and flats. The budget provides
for the erection of about 4000 houses
and flats during the current financial
year.
The Government has allocated
£12,000,000 from loan funds to the
Housing Commission for the 1953-
54 financial year.
Bold Programme.
“This has enabled the Commission
to adopt a bold programme,” Mr.
Cain declared.
The programme provided £400,000
to buy land, £1,650,000 for road
building, drainage, and site develop-
ment, £3,550,000 for house construc-
tion, £2,250,000 for concrete houses,
£2,500,000 for imported houses, and
£1,650,000 for general purposes.
Concrete Flats.
Last August the Commission’s
Holmesglen factory began production
of a new type of concrete flats at
the rate of one block of four units a
week.
Tenders have also been called for
the first 100 houses on the Broad-
meadows estate. This project will be
developed at greater speed as other
large metropolitan estates are com-
pleted in Melbourne.
Royal Medal For
Architecture
Award Made to Australian.
Mr. Arthur George Stephenson,
senior partner in the architectural firm
of Stephenson and Turner, has been
awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Ar-
chitecture for 1954.
It is the first time an Australian
has been awarded the medal, which
Queen Victoria instituted in 1848 for
the promotion of architecture.
The architectural work of Stephen-
son and Turner adorns the principal
cities throughout the Commonwealth.
Mr. Stephenson was the first Austra-
lian to become a member of the Inter-
national Hospital Association. He was
responsible for the Yaralla Hospital,
Gloucester House at Royal Prince Al-
fred Hospital, General Motors-Hold-
en’s assembly plant at Pagewood,
Royal Newcastle Hospital, sections of
St. Vincent’s Hospital, the new Dental
Hospital in Sydney, and the Royal
Melbourne Hospital.
High Award.
Mr. Stephenson was born in 1890
and educated at the Melbourne
Church of England Grammar School.
He did his architectural training in
Australia, and then spent 14 years
abroad before starting practice in Mel-
bourne in 1921,
He also spent some years with a
British exploration company in New
Guinea. Mr. Stephenson served in the
first Great War as Captain in the
Third Pioneers. He was awarded the
M.C., and was mentioned twice in
despatches.
The Royal Gold Medal goes each
year to a distinguished man of science
or letters who has designed a building
of high merit or produced a work
tending to promote the knowledge of
architecture or various branches oU
science connected with it.

Queensland’s “Gold Coast”
BUILDING ACTIVITY AT SURFERS PARADISE.
By F. O. NIXON.
A facetious member of a State
Government in Queensland, more than
half a century ago, referred to a newly'
built thirty miles of light railway from
a Central Queensland town to its sea-
side watering place as “a waste of
public money to enable the people of
that town and district to wash their
feet.” The Government, in doing this
act which is said to come next to god'
liness, automatically closed the four-
horse coaching service of Jimmy
Callaghan, who did the trip of 30 miles
over what went for a road in pre'motor
car days in four hours, with a change
of horses at Dan Hawke’s halTway
“house” (public).
The Parliamentarian’s would'be witty
remark could be applied with some
truth to all watering places which in
those far'off days awakened from their
lethargy during most of the year and
came into activity during the mid'
summer holidays and perhaps at
Easter. In the new world of motor
cars and bitumen roads, this rule has
gone by the board, and 50 to 70 miles
of motoring to attractive seaside re'
sorts is not as it was: an event to be
celebrated once or twice a year only,
but a weekend jaunt throughout the
year—'and on many occasions in be'
tween. Now, there is but little less
trouble in obtaining accommodation
or renting houses or flats at fabulous
rates at any time throughout the whole
year.
The term “Gold Coast,” being ap'
plied to the South Coast towns in the
19 miles of coast lands between South'
port and Coolangatta, is meant to re'
fer to the “gold,” or rather the wealth
that it stands for, wnich is brought
into these places in order to pay for
the galaxy of new homes and other
buildings being erected, and more
feverishly since building permits wete
released little more than a year ago.
New dwellings are of brick, cement,
stone, timber, and fibre; in the two
former cases two dwellings, each to
cost up to .£35,000, are nearing com'
pletion. Details of these latter can
stand over.
Some of those whose recollection
goes back to the end of last century
will remember the case of Tarangaba,
near Yeppoon, a delightful part of
the foreshore of Keppel Bay, where a
too'enterprising exploiter set out to
create a real “gold coast” with a reef
of payable gold. Unfortunately, it was
found, after the erection of a crush'
ing plant, a chimney stack and other
gold mining impedimenta, to be a
blatant “salting” with rich ore brought
laboriously from elsewhere by teams to
the Fitzroy River and then by yacht

THE CHARM OF SURFERS' PARADISE
Every year the charm of Surfers' Paradise on the South coast of Queensland appear to become
better known and more and more people go there to enjoy its even climate. Many folk retire there
and I ive permanently , others build luxurious holiday homes. We illustrate a few of the fine homes.

to Tarangaba. So this was a “gold
coast” that did not materialise.
But the new “Gold Coast” is build-
ing up—on a more lasting foundation.
It has capitalised a permanent golden
sunshine, and a rarely-equalled climate
for most of the year, to submit to
those who are prepared to pay the
price of it. Consequently, tms part
of the South Coast bas become the
hub of lavish dwellings owned in many
cases by residents of Sydney, Mel-
bourne, and even as far away as Wel-
lington, New Zealand. A sea-plane
service to Southport and an aeroplane
service to Coolangatta, 17 miles nearer
to the borderline at I weed Heads, pro-
vide the maximum of convenience and
the expenditure of time little more
than it takes in suburban trains and
buses to the owners of dwellings in
th eSouthern States. Queenslanders
are especially privileged. The almost
fabulous prices demanded and paid for
land—a great deal of land which is
Governmental leasehold at 3|% per
annum—and for the buildings erected
upon it are such as to put it beyond
the reach of the multitude, who at
holiday time can rent municipal camp-
ing sites.
The Government statistician states
that the biggest building booms are on
the sea coast, particularly on the
South Coast, where the programmes
increased by 400% in the last finan-
year—the last month, June, 1953,
being responsible for 109 new build-
ings worth £191,221. Since then, in
a fortnight, plans for buildings, sewer-
age, etc., valued the work at £209,877.
This sum included 48 new dwellings
(£110,540), five blocks of flats
(£56,286), one brick dwelling is to
cost £lO,OOO and another at the same
figure, a block of serviced rooms
(£14,000), a block of 11 flats
(£35,000.).
A shop and showroom is to cost
£7200. For the first four months of
the current financial year, plans have
been approved for 304 new dwellings,
38 blocks of flats, 21 conversions to
flats, garages, shops and 176 other
buildings with “septics,” drainage, etc.,
valued at £1,029,717. Prior to that
hectic one-third of a year, the record
stood at £1,899,218 for twelve months
to 31st July.
The first shop built in Surfers
Paradise, which stands on a corner
allotment of land once in this century
valued at £23, was recently sold for
£lB,OOO, and a bank, to cost £16,000,
is to be erected upon it. It is symp-
tomatic that a place called a “paradise”
should eschew such a coarse phrase as
“old age pensioner” and, in its place,
adopt the name of “Senior Citizens’
Garden Settlement” • the name re-
spectfully used by the Chatswood
Rotary Club. This will be the. name
of a settlement (or settlements) where
the retired citizens will live in neat
cottages with all the advantages of
but without the shortcomings
that feebleness in the occupants would
prefer to be without. At Coolangatta
another picture “Palace,” to cost
<£40,000, is to be a superior place to
the existing ones.
At “Miami,” another one of the
several beach centres, a surf clubhouse,
costing £6OOO, was opened at the close
of November. Where this is all going
to end, no one can see; but it is ob-
vious that a “Gold Coast” that pro-
vides the demand for surfing, sunshine
and climate, is not that evanescent
kind of ‘wealth” that is mined out of
the ground and then buried in vaults
labelled gold, ’ but real wealth that
comes within the trinity of food, cloth-
ing and housing.
The very recently-completed airport
frnnr , angatta that COSt 130,000 is
5500 ft. long, will take jets and Douglas
airliners and compares well with
the 6900 ft. long runway at Eagle
Farm. Visitors have the choice of
land or seaplanes.
So rapid has been the development
at the South Coast that water reticula-
tion has become an anxiety at the
moment of a longer spell without rain
than is usual. The weir over the
Nerang River cannot store sufficient
water for present needs until good rain
falls. Looking ahead, if delayed more
a few weeks the City Council has its
eyes upon Springbrook, 3000 to 4000
feet up in the MacPherson Range,
where a roaring canyon reminiscent of
the Blue Mountains spills away to the
lowlands. Underground water is
plentiful, and many of the beautiful"
lawns and gardens depend upon in-
dividual supplies distributed by elec-
tric pumps. There is a rich back-
ground of production in this district
that absolves it from being a mere
pleasure ground. At several beach
mines the sands are producing mine-
rals which include zircon and rutile,
for which there is an overseas market
for millions of pounds worth of these
minerals that only entail extraction
from the beach sands.
With all these natural advantages it
can be understood why someone has
conferred the name of “Gold Coast”
on the South Coast of Queensland.
PAINTING AT STRATHFIELD
HIGH SCHOOL.
J. Axtell’s Excellent Work.
The old - established painting or-
ganisation of J. Axtell, of 38 Wells
St., Redfern, Sydney, was responsible
for the excellent job of painting at the
Strathfield Girls’ High School that was
featured on page 20 of the December
issue. A feature of the work were the
attractive colour schemes.
CIRCULAR PLANNING.

are now putting the accent on colours,

The Bouwcentrum At Rotterdam
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING INFORMATION CENTRE
Insuring Building Millions Spent To Best Advantage.
[Extracts from a recent Address by Mr. J. VAN ETTINGER,
Director of the Bouwcentrum, to the American Institute of Architects
at the Waldorf'Astoria Hotel, New York.]
The Bouwcentrum, or Building
Centre, that was erected in Rotterdam
soon after the war was seen by the
world as a living symbol of the deter'
mination of the indomitable Dutch to
rise again. It is a live organisation
constituted to take the initative and
not just to be a dead repository of
objects and data, and a most energetic
Director in the person of M. Van
Ettinger and a full'time staff of 125,
keep it so.
Democracy and peace are things
which we value most when we no
longer possess them. Rotterdam learnt
that lesson when it was overrun in
1940 and a wave of misery and terror
engulfed this good old city. In those
days we became deeply conscious of
the fact that the sum total of the
activity we call “building” is of fun-
damental significance for this world of
ours.
Building is not only important in
connection with war and destruction,
but also because all development in
the world of to-day depends to a
marked extent on whether we can
marshal adequate building potential
and on whether we realise how im-
portant it is that the billions invested
in building should be spent wisely,
for efficient and large-scale building,
with the limited means which we have
at our disposal nowadays, is an essen-
tial condition in our rapidly-developing
world for reaching the safe port of
prosperitv, unassailable by extremists.
“The task which my institute in Rot'
terdam, the Bouwcentrum, has taken
upon itself is to ensure that the limit'
ed means available are used to the
best advantage,” said Mr. Van Ettinger.
The Bouwcentrum Founded.
The Bouwcentrum was founded in
1946 by the Netherlands architects,
together with the Building Industry
and in close co-operation with the
Dutch Government, as an independent
non-profit-making international insti-
tute. It was opened on the 18th of
May, 1949, on the Reconstruction
Day of the town of Rotterdam in the
presence of Queen Juliana.
How did it tackle this task? If we
regard the problems first of all from
a general national economic point of
view, we see that in Holland, for
example, one guilder in every ten is
invested in building; that is to say in
new construction and maintenance.
We must realise that the money re-
quired for this must be made available
from rents, writing off and more
especially by saving, as otherwise there
will be a continual threat of inflation,
as without adequate saving large-scale
building would send prices soaring.
For some time now we have been
waging a battle against a cold war,
against an attack on our prosperity,
and there is nothing more dangjerous
for Western Europe and world peace
than failure on the part of Western
Europe to complete its reconstruction.
It is clear therefore, that—in spite of
the heavy burden of rearmament —it
is of the utmost importance that we
should go on with our building activity
for civil purposes.
Distribution of Building Potential.
One of the secrets of the great sue-
cess of the reconstruction of the
Netherlands is that we have studied
thoroughlv the distribution of our
limited means over the different im-
portant sectors of building.
We need houses, churches, schools,
hospitals, roads, bridges, industrial
buildings, etc., and in times of re*
construction and development the pro-
ductivity of the whole country de-
pends on the correct distribution of
our building potential.
Bouwcentrum starts precisely at the
point where the problems of actual
building present themselves, them'
selves, thus at the point where the
architect and the contractor take over
responsibility, and here we must dis'
tinguish three different aspects:
Firstly, the building must be prac'
tical. It must meet the requirements
of the user, and the remarkable thing
is that the user cannot as a rule define
these reauirements himself.
Secondly, on the strength of these
reauirements the architect must design
the building, for which a suitable
choice of materials, constructions and
installations is essential.
Thirdly, there are the actual build'
ing operations ,and it is at this stage
that the contractor plays a major part.
There are, therefore, three phases:
programming, design and execution.

be said to symbolise the new Rotterdam rising from the ashes of the old.

BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING
January 25, 1954.


Building Type Structures,
Now, let us assume that an architect
receives an instruction to construct a
building for Child Welfare. How will
the institution in question approach
the problem of re-education? Will
the children be split up according to
age or intelligence, or is a division
into vertical groups preferred? Should
he design rooms for 4,6, 8 or 12
children? Should the colours of the
rooms be green, grey, yellow or blue?
Should he design one large central
kitchen or is decentralised cooking
preferred, etc. etc.
And can you expect the architect,
or his principal for that matter, to
study all these general problems for
this one building? This requires a
whole batch of experts, and as a rule
the architect has not got the time or
the money to make extensive general
studies. And when we realise that
the same applies to all buildings there
are only two solutions possible; either
the architect shows a strong tendency
to specialise or he enlists the aid of
an institution such as the Bouwcen-
trum.
In Europe the architect regards this
strong tendency to specialise as a dan-
ger to his creative capacities.
Staff of 125.
Even the Bouwcentrum, which has
a full-time staff of 125 persons, can-
not provide this assistance without it-
self having to seek advice elsewhere.
For this reason the Bouwcentrum has
formed a large number of study teams
in the spheres of housing, home
economics, child welfare, hospitals,
homes for the aged, etc. These teams
include the best men our country can
provide, and the results of these
studies, partly based on those which
have been made in a number of other
countries, enable us to determine step
by step the spatial consequences of
everything our society requires in this
sphere and to furnish the architect
with a sound basis for the designing
of all these typical elements of build-
ing.
Material and Construction
Data.
On the strength of these functional
data the architect can now start de-
signing. At this stage, however, a
new series of problems present them-
selves. With the ultimate conception
of the building in mind, but on an
objective basis, he must now make a
sound choice of materials, construe-
tions and installations. To achieve
this, close contact must be established
between the men in the laboratories
and the practical builders.
One of the first things we did in
the Bouwcentrum was to make up a
verv extensive collection of typical
building materials. On certain con-
ditions the manufacturers of building
materials, too, are afforded an oppor-
tunity to exhibit their products in an
objective manner, all exhibits, how-
ever, being constructed by the Bouw-
centrum itself, and nearly 400 indus-
tries from a large numberg of coun-
tries are represented here.
Efficient Administrative
Methods.
The Bouwcentrum is giving courses,
in close co-operation with the con-
tractors’ organisation, for young con-
tractors to teach them the principles
and the application of scientific man-
agement, and as many as 2000 young
contractors have already attended this
course, and when you visit the various
building sites in the Netherlands you
will in many instances notice the re-
sults of these courses in the form of
well-prepared production schemes and
efficient administration methods.
The Problems Analysed.
The problems involved in building
can be subdivided into five main
groups:
Firstly. The general, economic,
social and statistical problems closely
bound up with the total building
potential of the country as a whole
and the distribution of this total build-
ing potential over a number of build-
ing sectors.
Secondly. The problems connected
with town and country planning.
Thirdly. The general functional
problems and the application of the
functional notion to the various types
of buildings, such as houses, homes
for the aged, hospitals, special build-
ings for child welfare, schools, indus-
trial buildings, farms, etc.
Fourthly. Problems connected with
the correct choice of materials, con-
structions and installations with re-
ference to designing.
Fifthly. The problems relating to the
organisation of the site and the inter-
nal organisation of the contractor’s
business.
It is clear that the ultimate object
must be to furnish those who are
faced with the problems of building
in practice with a quantity of useful
knowledge, skill and experience which
will enable them to carry out their
task more efficiently and to base their
decisions on a better foundation.
EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR VIEWS.
(Top) Exterior of a section of the Bouw-
centrum showing the brick infilling and

ternally. (Middle) Interior view showing

organisation constituted to take the in-
itiative and not just be a dead collection
of objects and data and a most ener-
getic Director in the person of M. Van
Ettinger and a full-time staff of 125
keep it so. Too often our Museums
and Art Galleries are passive rather than
active, though our Technological Mus-
eum, under the direction of Mr. A. R.
Penfold, is ever available to industry
for specialised advice and research,
Average annual attendances at The
Technological Museum, Sydney, is
162,000; The Australian Museum, Syd-
ney, 247,000, and the National Art Gal-
lery of N.S.W. (no definite records
kept). 300,000.

BUILDING; LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


Three essential phases may be dis-
tinguished here:
(a) We must have this knowledge,
skill and experience at our dis-
posal;
(b) We must pass this knowledge,
skill and experience on to those
who are in need of it;
(c) We must influence them in
such a way that they will be
prepared to use the knowledge,
skill and experience which is
offered to them.
The information can be supplied
orally, in writing or visually by means
of an exhibition, a demonstration or
a film. It can also be furnished in
the form of a written or oral lesson.
An important point is, however, that
the practical builder should always re-
ceive the subject matter in digestible
proportions, and the Bouwcentrum
calls this work “active documentation,"
in contrast with the work of the lib-
rarian, which may be called “passive
documentation."
National and International
Co-ordination.
National co-ordination is achieved
by setting up a large number of study
groups, which altogether comprise
some 250 experts.
In the sphere of international co-
operation the Bouwcentrum wishes to
contribute its share to raise the general
level of prosperity by the improve'
ment of building methods. In Western
Europe in particular it is essential that
not a single cubic foot of timber or a
single ton of steel is inefficiently
utilised in building, now that rearma'
ment is bearing down so heavily on
economic life and is seriously threaten'
ing the completion of recovery.
In the course of the last two
years the Bouwcentrum has welcomed
visitors from 55 countries and we have
tried to help them the best we could.
We are prepared to go further than
that, we are prepared to put inter'
national cooperation on a real basis,
and with an ever-increasing energy.
We wish to live up to our function of
serving, to our status of a non-profit'
making institution, and to our prim
ciple of co-operation with each and
every expert in the sphere of building.
Scientists Soundproof
London Flats
Unwanted Noises Are Defeated.
The tenants occupying flats owned
by the Camberwell (London) Council
complained that everyone could hear
what everyone else was doing and
saying in the 48'flat block.
The council immediately invited
scientists of a building research team
to track down the ways the sound
of baby cries, conversations, foot'
steps up and down stairs, etc., were
leaking from flat to flat.
Sounds Charted.
The experts arrived in a mobile
laboratory. With brass and rubber
hammers they banged away at 10 taps
or thumps a minute (to imitate foot'
steps), and with recordings of various
noises, the scientists explored the
block.
In the mobile workshop, machines
charted the loudness and intensity of
the noises as picked up by micro'
phones in rooms next to the test and
on floors above and below.
Two flats were sound-proofed, as a
start. These proved so successful that
the 48 flats on the Denmark Hill es-
tate were treated at a cost of £6OOO.
Tenants moved out while the work was
done. Then they added one shilling
more per week on their rent, to meet
the cost. [They were very kind to
themselves to expect someone to spend
£6OOO for which they were willing
to dole out 2%. What kind of an
investment is this, Money must be
very cheap in England.]
Defeating Noise.
Councils, businesses, and air com'
panics all over the world are seeking
methods to beat the curse of unneces'
sary noise that slays sleep, upsets
nerves, invites ill-health.
Bristol (U.K.) Corporation acted
on a large scale in 1952 when they
decided to rehouse 2000 families, a
few at a time, while the floors of
their municipal flats were soundproof'
ed.
Novel Notions.
In many buildings now being erect'
ed in Britain, as well as flats, novel
notions to defeat unwanted noises are
being incorporated in constructions.
Asbestos washers act as baffle plugs
when fitted between steel girders.
Rubber pads insulate throbbing vibra-
tions of basement machinery from
passing along concrete floors and
walls.
Crumbled cork, glass wool, felt
strips, packed into specially contriv'
ed spaces halt every normal type of
A CORNER OF THE EXHIBITS.

U.S. EMBASSY IN RIO.
STRIKING NEW STRUCTURE.
The new United States Embassy in Rio
de Janeiro is one of more than fifty
new embassies, consulates and informa-
tion centres being built throughout the
world. This striking new structure ap-
propriately on Avenue President Wilson,
is Brazil's first all air-conditioned build-
ing. It was designed by the New York
architectural firm of Harrison and
Abramovitz—Wallace Harrison was chief
architect for Rockefeller Centre and
the U.N. building in New York. Be-
sides offices, the building has a cafe-
teria, movie theatre and apartments on
the two top floors for the embassy staff.
The small curved annexe in front is a
library. There are 27,000 square feet
of green-blue windows, some of which
look orange because of the light behind
them.

were destroyed. The destruction of
industry was on an even greater scale.
It was an opportunity for the planner
to turn ugly haphazard chaos into or-
derly, roomy cities.
The planners realised that today
mankind needs a dual-purpose city; a
large-scale, roomy city for the tech-
nological side of his life, and a quiet,
homey city for the precious human
side.
The metropolis must be laid out on
two completely different but carefully
interwoven scales. The technical and
the human must complement each
other.
Architects Succeed.
At the same time the architects
were seeking to give individuality to
each building. The examples illus-
trated here prove how well they have
succeeded. Dogmatic rigidity has
replaced by flexibility; squareness and
angularity in space and line by oc-
casional rounded and flowing designs.
Widely different building materials,
and an abundant use of glass are fea-
tures of modern German architecture
in the democracy of the Federal Re-
public of Germany.
All this has been done in the face
of complicated problems in the path
of new departures in the architectural,
building, and town-planning fields.
The German building industry,
Herr Werner writes, has followed the
line of least resistance in the face of
many difficulties. As after the first
war, there has been a tendency to
build on the outskirts of cities where
land is cheap.
“This irresponsible retreat in the
face of difficulties, which is almost
characteristic of the situation as a
whole in Germany today, places a
burden on the national economy.
“While good land in the down-
town areas remains unused, new in-
vestments are pumped into the sub-
urban districts.
“As a result the cities are becom-
ing more sprawling, and the cost of
street construction, utilities and pub-
lic transport are increased,” the author
adds.
[There is a parallel here in the
sprawling growth of our Australian
cities, and there are undoubtedly many
lessons to be learned from the re-
building of “defeated” Germany.]
Presentation to Adrian Ashton
APPRECIATION FROM R.A.I.A.
Recently Mr. E. W. Andrew, Pres-
ident of the N.S.W. Chapter of the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects, at a special meeting of the
Council, made a presentation to Mr.
Adrian Ashton as a token of appreci-
ation for his work as Honorary Editor
of the Chapter Bulletin over the past
ten years.
Mr. Andrew said that during the
war years of 1942 the Council had
felt the need for some means of keep-
ing its scattered membership informed
of Institute affairs and of items of gen-
eral interest to the Profession. Mr.
Ashton, then Architect to the Minis-
try of Munitions and a member of
the Council, had offered to produce
a monthly news-bulletin, which had
started in January, 1943. Over the
past ten years in spite of his many
other activities and his two-year term
of Presidency of the Chapter, Mr.
Ashton had each month personally
compiled, edited and published the
Bulletin which had proved of great
benefit to the Chapter and its expand-
ing membership.
Mr. Ashton, in thanking the Presi-
dent and Council for this kindly ges-
ture, said that the engraved Parker
Pen and Pencil set would be his con-
stant companions. He had been very
happy to launch the Bulletin and carry
it on for so long and now that the
Chapter staff was in a position to
take it over he handed it to them
with every good wish.
The meeting terminated with re-
freshments and Christmas and New
Year Greetings.
(Top left) New shopping centres, such as this department store in Kiel, are springing up everywhere, to replace those bombed
out during the war. This building with its attractive, clean cut lines, is typical of this type of construction. The large windows
are fixtures, the small ones in between can open for ventilation. A large cantilevered awning Is provided. (Lower left) De-
partment store in Heilbronn, which conforms to the principle that needs are best served by the plainest, simplest possible
floor plan and construction pattern. The building features mirror-like exterior surfaces, unusual awnings on varying levels,
and large plate glass windows. (Centre) This house at Frankfurt on Main features yellow steel-framed windows, white plaster
exterior finish, light grey balcony and dark grey slates, which harmonise with large picture windows. For outdoor living the
terrace is much used. (Right) Country house near Stuttgart, built from a ruin. The very unusual large scale corrugated
roof, painted turquoise on the underside, extends at an angle over the terrace, and seems to draw nature into the house on
the three main sides. Note the sloping windows which are miniature hot-houses for exotic plants.

COMPULSORY UNIONISM
GUIDE TO PROVISIONS OF THE ACT.
M.B.A. Issues Explanatory Notes.
The legal advisers of the Master Builders’ Association of N.S.W. have
prepared the following explanatory notes regarding the law providing
for absolute preference for unionists.
(The opinions expressed by Senior Counsel will be of the utmost
interest to both Master Builders and Associate Suppliers alike.)
Broadly, the Act provides that anv
employee who is employed under a
State Award or State Industrial Agree'
ment has until the 17th January, 1954,
to join an appropriate Union.
The main State Awards covering the
Building Industry are:
Carpenters 6s? Joiners & Bricklayers.
Plumbers.
Electricians.
Plasterers.
Clerks.
Painters.
Motor Waggon Drivers, etc.
Builders’ Labourers fall within two
groups:
1. Members of the M.B.A. are all
respondents to the Federal Builders’
Labourers’ Award and Builders’ La'
bourers employed by them are not
compelled to join a Union.
2. Affiliated members (Country
Branches and Suburban Branches) are
not members of the M.B.A. in accord'
ance with decisions of the Common'

Explanatory Notes.
The Industrial Arbitration (Amend'
ment) Act provides that all persons
over 18 years of age who work under
State Award or Industrial Agreement
must join the union covering their
calling or apply for membership of
it within 28 days of the Act coming
into force or from the date of em'
ployment. Employers must not know-
ingly continue the employment of non'
unionists after 28 days where the em'
ployment is subject to a State Award
or Industrial Agreement.
The Act was assented to on 17th
December, 1953. The 28 days expire
at midnight on 13th January, 1954.
A. Who Must Join.
The Act provides that the following
categories of employees shall either
join a union or apply for membership:
1. An adult (18 years of age and
upwards) who on 17th December,
1953, was employed in an occupation
to which a State Award or Industrial
Agreement applies.
2. An adult (18 years of age and up'
wards) who after 17th December,
1953, makes a new contract of em'
ployment with an employer under
which he works in an occupation to
which a State Award or Industrial
Agreement applies.
The Labour Office, Hanover, has done

buildings, and presents instead a cheer-
ful windowed facade. It is set facing

purposeful design of this spacious struc-
ture is a good example of type of con-
struction developed in Germany. Here

Broadcasting Station, Hanover, contains
within its walls a space-shaped concert
studio, and all other amenities required
in modern radio broadcasting. The

glass entrance hall set In chrome plated
steel and a spacious roof sun deck.
(Third) X-ray Institute, Osnabruck. This
medical science centre, described as an
excellent example of "pure plasticity,"
features cubic forms with white surfaces
in pleasant contrast to the landscape
setting. As in modern German build-
ings, generous use has been made of
glass. (Bottom) This new Cologne-

3. An adult (18 years of age and
upwards) who either on 17th De-
cember, 1953, or afterwards is em-
ployed in an occupation to which no
State Award or Industrial Agreement
applies and such an Award or Agree-
ment is made at some later time.
Where an adult ceases to be within
these categories he is not compelled
to join a union.
B. Who Need Not Join.
1. Those whose conditions of em-
ployment are prescribed by a Federal
Award.
2. Those whose occupation is not
covered by a State Award or Indus-
trial Agreement.
3. Persons occupying managerial
positions (see later remarks).
4. Ex-service men and women cov-
ered by the Commonwealth Re-estab-
lishment, and Employment Act.
5. Persons who apply for and obtain
a certificate of conscientious objection.
If the certificate is refused and the
applicant appeals to the Industrial
Commission against such refusal the
obligation to join is suspended until
the appeal is decided.
6. Employees under 18 years of age.
7. Persons who hold a certificate
of exemption on religious grounds un-
der the old Act.
8. An employee who on 17th De-
cember, 1953, was under 18 years of
age and who continues in employment
with the same employer after becom-
ing 18.
9. Where there is no union with
members engaged in the employee’s
occupation.
10. Where the period of employ-
ment is for less than 28 days.
11. An employee who on 17th De-
cember was award free but who later
by a change of duties with the same
employer comes within an award, e.g.
an employee who commences employ-
ment under a Federal award and
changes to a State award.
Meaning of “Knowingly” (see
opening paragraph).
An employer would not be exoner-
ated by the use of the word “Know-
ingly” if having reason to believe to
the contrary he failed to enquire
whether his employee was a member
of a union or was the holder of a
certificate of exemption or had made
application for one.
E.g., an employer in relation to
employees whom he has reason to be*
lieve were non-unionists on 17th De-
cember, 1953, would be obliged to
make enquiry of each of them as to
whether they were complying with the
law. If he received an affirmative
answer, the employer need make no
further enquiries. If the answer be
vague or evasive or if the employee
did not answer, the employer would
be required to confirm the position
of his employee either from the union.

ficatc, from the Industrial Registrar.
Oftence.
Failure to comply with the provi'
sions of the Act either by employers
or employees is continuing offence
from day to day. Maximum penalty
£lOO.
Conscientious Objectors.
Application for a certificate of ex'
emption because of conscientious be'
liefs not necessarily religious, should
be made to the Industrial Registrar on
a form obtainable from A.P.A. Build'
ing, Martin Place, and should be sup'
ported, probably on affidavit, stating
the reasons for the application.
Managerial Positions.
According to the provisions of the
Act, an employee to occupy a man'
agerial position, must be ’’principally
engaged in the direction and control
of others. The importance of the
position occupied is irrelevant. The
test is not management of a business
but direction and control of persons.
The Industrial Commission has held
that—
(a) Managerial position has a spec'
ial defined meaning different
from its natural meaning.
(b) The test under the Act is what
is the principal purpose for
which the employee is engaged.
(c) That the principal purpose is
not tested so much by the time
spent on any duties but by their
importance to the employer.
Award Coverage (subject to
paragraph B above);
All persons covered by a State
award or Industrial Agreement, except
those in managerial positions, are sub'
ject to compulsory unionism. Many
cases of doubt will arise under this
heading. While it is impossible to
deal with all of them the following
examples are given as a guide.
The Clerks (State) Award applies
to persons employed in any clerical
capacity whatsoever. If they are
clerks, compulsory unionism can apply
irrespective of the wages paid, e.g.,
over the exemption rate of £l6/18/0
per week. Whether an employee is
employed as a clerk depends on
whether the major and substantial part
of his occupation involves the keeping
of books, records or other documents.
It is not a question of what the em*
ployee is called but of what he is pri'
manly employed to do.
An employee may be employed pri'
manly to make management decisions.
This aspect of his work may not take
anything like the bulk of his time and
he may do clerical work. Such an eim
ployee does not come within the
Clerks’ Award.
(Top) Massive timber arches support
the roof and are a feature of this im-
posing German Church. Its exterior,
with curved tile roof, is equally unortho-
dox. Of brick and timber construction,
this church symbolises the new era of
German church building. (Second) Cafe
Kropcke, Hanover. The original building
was destroyed during the war, and this
charming glass pavilion was built on the
old foundations. The light construction
has a spic and span appearance. (Third)
Exhibition Building, Frankfurt. Built to

fine proportions of this well-lighted
building are extremely attractive. The
German trend to make increasing use of
glass is well illustrated here. (Bottom)

lin. There is no "timeless atmosphere"

velopment represents an attempt to de-
sign dormitories for young workers and

courtyards well away from the city.
(Bottom) Primary School, Offenbach.
This unorthodox school building was de-
signed to give pupils a sense of roomi-
ness and a view of the outdoors. The
classrooms on both floors are reached by
an unusual staircase from a large hall
which serves as a sports and assembly
room. A minimum of obstruction is ob-
tained through slender vertical balustrad-
ing and handrailing.

The following classifications, while
not exhaustive, are either managerial
or not covered by awards:
Directors.
Managers.
Secretaries where work is primarily
supervisory and/or executive.
Accountants and Sub'Accountants
who are employed primarily in a
supervisory and/or Executive cap'
acity.
Buyers in retail stores performing
mainly executive functions as dis'

Production Managers.
Production Superintendents.
Foremen.
Personnel Managers.
Industrial Officers.
Production and/or Plant Engineers.
Briefly stated the tests to be applied
are:
1. Is a position managerial?
The test is, are the employees prin-
cipally engaged in the direction and
control of others. If the answer is
“yes” there is no need for them to
join a union.
2. If the answer is “No,” does any
award or industrial agreement cover
tfieir work? If the answer is “yes”
they must join a union. If the answer
is “No’ there is no need for them to
to join a union.
Note: —The test is not the salary
paid.
The limit of £2,000 per annum is
only to allow the Commission to raise
the maximum salary in awards from
£1750 to £2OOO per annum.
The new law on Compulsory Union'
ism was passed by the Cahill Labour

WAR MEMORIAL HALL PLANNE
NEUTRAL BAY PROJECT.
St. Augustine’s Parish, Neutral Bay,
has planned a War Memorial Hall,
which is to be erected on the tennis
court site alongside the Rectory. It
will be surrounded by gardens and
lawns.
The hall has been designed by Mr.
B. J. Waterhouse, F.R.1.8.A., L.F.R.
A.1.A.. and it will be a structure
worthy of the Parish,
Layout.
In his condensed report covering
proposed construction and amenities,
Mr. Waterhouse states that the hall
will provide on the ground floor seat'
ing accommodation for 280 persons,
a stage 30ft. by 20ft., two dressing
rooms each 15ft. by 9ft., a kitchen
19ft. by 9ft., and a projection room
10ft. by 6ft. The basement floor will
provide two committee rooms each
15ft. by 9ft., and toilet facilities for
both sexes. A staircase connects the
stage to the basement.
The proposed terrace on the west
side of the building will make an at
tractive approach to the entrance
porch. Externally the walls of the hall
will be finished with facing bricks and
the roof covered with tiles of appro'
priate colour
Internally the walls of the building
will have a facing brick dado, the up'
per portion being plastered and colour'
ed. The ceiling will be of fibrous
plaster with curved sides and ends.
Flooring throughout will be of tallow'
wood. All joinery to the hall and
proscenium opening will be of Queens'
land maple.
The general appearance of the hall
will be in harmony with the Church.
It is estimated to cost between
£16,000 and £17,000 to erect, and a
drive for funds is at present under
way.

The number of permits (797) in
•October fully sustained the average of
the best months of the year (Novem-
her and December not yet available)
Permits for dwellings are as usual
well in the majority? those for build-
ings to cost from £3OOO up to £5OOO
numbering 33; those costing £5OOO to
.£lO,OOO being four in number wMe
one suburban home is to cost £23 190
Twelve cottages for the Housing Com-
mission are set down as £24,250 in all
That flats are still in demand is evi-
denced by permits for five such build-
mgs to cost from £3750 to £13,000
each. Workshops, service stations and
large-scale additions amounting to
£3OOO to £BOOO each related to twenty
permits. A dormitory block at a
Lutheran school is to cost £24,000,
and two churches will cost £12,000
and £5OOO respectively, while altera-
tions to two others are listed at £3500
and £6OOO.
Extensive additions to the suburban
Roxy picture theatre will cost
£lO,OOO, and the Cyclone Co. of Aust.
Ltd. is about to build a new factory
to cost £150,000 at Geebung, a rising
North-side suburb to which other fac-
tory owners have been attracted in re-
cent years. In another suburb, a fac'
tory to cost £17,500 has been started.
Evidently such a development as the
so-called “depression” years of the
early 1930’s ar e not to be among the
“uninvited guests” at our post-war

ceeded in an action in which he had
been awarded £7203 by the Arbitrator,
though set aside by the Queensland
Supreme Court, in August. The con-
tractor proceeded in his appeal to the
High Court for the full amount and
costs estimated to be quite £5OOO.
The Housing Commissioner in his
report mentioned that 1300 families
were now living in imported homes,
and a considerable number of homes
were in various stages of building,
while 144 had not been started or had
but little work done on them. In
spite of all things in a very trouble-
some business, the operations had
shown a profit of £24,804 on the three
funds of the Commissioner.
[Ed.: A private practitioner, making
such profits from housing in some of
* c other States, would be dubbed “a

ed as a crime in this country. In
other countries successful business

the Brisbane River was discovered, is
part of the layout. A lecture-room,
to cost £15,000, subscribed to by Old
Collegians of World Wars I and 11,
is part of the plan, and self-contained
flats, complete in all respects, will be
provided for seventy students. An
impressive feature of the College will
be a memorial tower, the foundations
for which go down from 20ft. to 25ft.
and rest upon solid rock. Freestone
and granite from local quarries will be
much in evicJence in this striking struc-
ture.
Activities in a greater or lesser de-
gree in building—decidedly greater in
the South Coast towns —could be re-
peated throughout most Queensland
towns. The greatest development, not
only in extent, but in its importance
to the permanent welfare of the State,
is in relation to large-scale water con-
servation.
It is indisputable that schemes of
water conservation and reafforestation,
the ultimate success of which needs
vision, have not been regarded as
popular with politicians, nor with
voters who have votes to record. It
is gratifying to realise that both with
politicians and voters whom they rep-
resent there has come a new realisa-
tion.
It will astonish many people to learn
that the Burdekin Dam, of which the
first section was officially opened re-
cently in the Gorge Weir, 70 miles
south-west from Ayr—a town between
Townsville and Bowen—will ultimately
have a greater storage capacity than
that of the seven dams provided for
in the Snowy Mountains project.
When the Burdekin Falls Dam reaches
its planned height of 150 feet, it will
have a storage capacity of 6,584,000
acre feet, as compared with 4,300,000
acre feet that the Snowy Mountains
project is to conserve. Figures, more
impressive to the non-technical mind,
are the claim that the storage content
of the Burdekin Dam will equal six-
teen times the volume of water in
Sydney Harbour!
These figures may cause a gasp, but
they are, nevertheless, official. The
expenditure of £400,000 has definite-
ly held back a great body of water
from which a large number cf farms
can be irrigated (many would prefer
to see this less vaunting over the
tobacco they can grow and more about
their food - growing possibilities).
Shortage of loan money may not allow
the scheme, which also embraces
hydro-electric power generation, to be
completed by 1980/81 its planned
period.

operation, for which the first shot was
fired early in December, is the Tinaroo
Falls Dam in the Mareeba'Dimbulah
area on the Dividing Range, twelve
miles from Atherton in North Queens'
land. The altitude of this area is in
the 3000 ft. to 4000 ft. belt through
which the Barron River runs in its pas'
sage to the ocean via the magnificent
Falls for which this part of Queens-
land is famous even beyond Australia.
The complete scheme is estimated
to cost £20,000,000 by the time it is
scheduled for completion in 1958/59.
The first large dam is planned to hold
back 90,000,000,000 gallons of water
in a lake of thirteen square miles (for
a mental picture think of a body of
water four miles long by three and a
quarter miles broad). This is about
two'thirds of the area of Sydney Har-
hour. From the high elevation of
Atherton, with its yearly rainfall of
about 55 inches during the “wet
season” the subjugation of the millions
of tons of valuable water now rushing
o the Pacific Ocean will be wortny of
a great poem. To the designers, and
to all concerned in its creation, the
scheme when completed will be their
worthy monument.
The “Song of Steam” could be ap-
propriately paraphrased in_the words —
“Harness me down with your mighty
bands,
Be sure of your curb and rain,
For I scorn the power of your
puny hands
As the tempests scorn the main ”
The 200 miles of main channels will
gravitate 350,000,000 gallons of water
daily to irrigate 38,000 acres of farm
lands that could grow most of the food
required to feed Australia’s people.
The capacity of these conservation
schemes to enable both tropical and
temperate foods to be grown is difficult
to conceive.
Other water conservation operations
on the Mclntyre River border of
N.S.W. and Queensland and elsewhere
in Queensland bring one to the realisa-
tion that at long last Governments
have put their fingers or the key to
Australia’s economic greatness in
bringing forth the twin child of sun-
shine that is, of course, water a
pair to whom Nature is very bountiful.
The success attained by the Horni-
brook Highway, which bridges the
shallow waters of Moreton Bay be'
tween Sandgate and Redcliffe, has been
such as to encourage consideration of
another scheme to connect Toorbul
Point at the northern end of More'
ton Bay, with Bribie Island. The State
Government has been asked by a pri-
vate company to grant a franchise to
build the necessary viaduct. This
means of transport becomes more
necessary to the growing number of
residents on the Island and visitors
since they have been inconvenienced
by the cessation of the Brisbane Tug
Company’s two welhequipped steamers.
The viaduct proper would entail three'
quarters of a mile of building over
three to eight feet of sea water. Estp
mated cost is £1,000,000. With road'
ways to the ocean beach, the whole
Northern distance would be about six
miles further than the distance South'
ports is from Brisbane- —possible road
deviations could shorten the distance
ro Bribie Island.
Despite the expected falling'off in
building permits for the City of Bris*B
bane as the year was drawing to as
close, the number of permits given im
November—B27—was 26 in excess ofc
those during the previous month.

Before you nail up that
Masonite Presdwood, moisten
the back of the sheets you’re going
to use and stack them flat —back to
back for at least 24 hours.
The reason is that in the process of
converting hardwood fibres into denser-
than-wood Masonite Presdwood, moisture
is eliminated in fact, the finished
product is in its driest possible state.
Before fixing, therefore, the moisture
content of the board should be stabilised
by wetting the reverse side of the sheet.
This ensures that if the Masonite Presd-
wood is fixed to an adequate frame, it
will remain rigid . . . smooth . .
unaffected by the absorption of atmos-

would be adversely affected by the
substitution of atomic powerhouses for
existing power producers should be
arrested, if not dispersed, by the report
by Mr. C. A. M. Weller, generatoin
engineer to the Brisbane City Coum
cil, who recently returned from a five
months’ visit overseas. He recom'
mended in his report that the present
programme of coahfired stations in
Brisbane continue until the economics
of atomic energy were known. Present
indications were, he reported, that the
cost of power from atomic power'
houses would not be less than the cost
from coal'burning stations.
Mr. Wellers’ report warned against
over'optimism that had escaped, even
though it would be three years before
the experimental atomic powerhouse
in Cumberland could operate and ten
years before Great Britain could have
a commercial unit. The use of gas
turbines was also deprecated by Mr.
Weller as the result of his researches.
The higher cost of light oils or natural
gas from blast furnaces put Australia
in an unfavourable position as com'
pared with Great Britain and the
United States of America.
So Queensland’s abundance of coal
is still a factor of great importance
whatever the distant future may bring
forth.
The Department of Public Instruc'
tion is having an anxious time in find'
ing room for the large growing popu'
lation, so much so that a great effort
is being made to overcome the diffi'
culty before the reopening of the
State schools.
Three new high schools are well
under way, and three days only having
been observed as midsummer holidays,
the progress made warrants the belief
that the buildings will be ready for
occupation at the right time. Each
of these high schools—at Banyo, Salis'
bury and Indooroopilly—will accom'
modate 250 pupils of the sub'junior
stage, taking academic industrial and
commercial courses. In addition,
domestic science will be taught at
Salisbury in an aluminium building.
The estimated production of face
bricks in Brisbane approximately
175,000 a week - is found to be
quite inadequate for present needs,
needs. More kilns and more men are
required, since the standard of dwell'
ings has improved greatly. Timber
dwellings find the same shortage of
materials, a combine dshortage which
arises from the enormously greater
number of dwellings being erected in
new suburbs that are being opened
up.
An early start is to be made to erect
very large buildings for insurance com'
panics in the heart of Brisbane—one
at the corner of Queen Street and
William Street and the other at the
corner of Adelaide Street and Edward
Street. In the latter case, a protest
has been raised by a leading business'
man whose men’s outfitting establish'
ment is finding its place of business
“isolated” between this large insur'
ance building on one side and on the
other the new Commonwealth Savings
Bank on the corner of Queen and
Edwards Streets, which has absorbed
one of Brisbane’s busiest shopping
areas.
This business head remarks, with
some truth, that if the large plate'
glass windows placed in the business
house only about a year ago were re'
tained and brightened up with colour'
ful presentations instead of the replace'
ment with Travertine marble, it would
have lessened the “deadening” effect
upon what was one of the city’s
bright retail business areas.
The “Gold Coast”—that part of the
Southern Queensland beaches of which
Surfers Paradise is the hub—is about
to ha'/e its laurels challenged by the
near North Coast, approximately the
same distance from Brisbane.
In 1954 it is intended to launch a
plan to spend nearly £2,000,000 upon
luxury hotels, modern bathing
pavilions, new water supply system,
new roads and an aerodrome. The
hir'.cknd is well provided with fruit
fa.-.s and much land that could not
be obtained at the “Gold Coast” even
at very much higher prices. Advan'
tages as enumerated will be necessary
if anything other than quietude is
sought when compared with the hectic
“Gold Coast.”
Still another rival is arising in the
development of the beach lands of
Northern New South Wales, from the
border of Queensland at Coolangatta
as far south as Brunswick Heads, with
several attractive beach resorts inter'
vening.
Major developments in sewerage and
electricity will absorb £7,000,000,
being provided for Brisbane City in
the present year. Brisbane’s late ad'
vent into sewerage has left the suburbs
at a disadvantage for a long time to
come.
The large new powerhouse at Tef
nyson, first 30,000 kilowatt unit, i
progressing towards completion, and
new water mains from Mt. Crosby,
which will give Brisbane an additional
8,000,000 gallons of water daily, form
part of the big works for which money
has been made available.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
Although there are many large'scale
building projects scheduled for 1954,
the New Year promises to be a testing
time for the efficiency of local build'
ing industry. Both architects and
builders are trying to reduce building
costs, and there are signs that they
are succeeding. Costs fell by an esth
mated 15 per cent, in the past year,
and Government statistics show 1,292
more houses completed in the year
ended June 30, with a labor force of
1000 men less.
The latest move in the drive for ef'
ficiency is the introduction at the
S.A. School of Mines of courses of
building instruction for building fore'
man and clerk of works, and for
master builder. The courses have
been introduced at the request of the
S.A. Chapter of the Australian Insti'
tute of Builders, and each is expected
to open with about 12 students. When
the courses are established, master
builders will take on cadets, who will
study to qualify themselves for the
profession of builder while working
on the job.
Moves towards greater efficiency
and lower prices have been welconv
ed as a counterblow to the down'
ward trend in home construction, the
bread and butter of many firms. Ah
though orders are still coming in,
some for luxury homes running into
five figures, many young couples seem
resigned to spending the first years
of their married lives in flats and fur'
nished rooms, rather than undertake
the expense of a house.
Big building shows every sign of
keeping up, and construction an'
nouncements are expected soon on
Brougham House, the State’s biggest
multistorey block of flats, and EhV
abeth House, a six'storey professional
office building in the city. Demoli'
tion work has finished on the site of
the Savings Bank’s projected lOstorey
building on the corner of Hindley and
Bank Streets, and tenders should be
called for the building before long.
Two city insurance companies plan
ll'Storey office buildings in the city,
although high costs have delayed both
projects until later in the year.
Several major hotel jobs have been
set down for the New Year. Prelim'
inary tenders have been invited for
the erection of the two'Storeyed Ah
bion Hotel at Kilburn, estimated to
cost about £60,000. The hotel will
have 14 bedrooms, including a pri'
vate suite for the licensee and a guest
suite, and will be of steel, concrete
and cream brick. A major breakaway
from conventional hotel design pro'
vided by the architects, Caradoc Ash'
ton, Fisher, Woodhead and Beaumont
Smith, is the setting of the hotel back
from the street in wide lawns and
gardens. Estimates are being prepar'
ed by Lucas &? Parker for the new
Hotel Seaton, on Tapleys Hill Road,
nearly opposite the Royal Adelaide
Golf Links, but it is expected to be
some time before tenders are called.
The State’s biggest new post office
contract for several years has been let
by the Commonwealth Works Depart'
ment to Wilckens and Burnside, for
£49,937. It is for the construction
of the Woomera Post Office, to be
built of concrete bricks, with roof of
asbestos cement. Besides the usual
postal facilities and staff amenities,
the post office will include a repeater
station for easPwest telephone traffic,
and some rooms will be air'eondition'
ed. Wilckens and Burnside also have
a £9,540 contract for construction of
reinforced concrete walls and ducts
at Woomera.
Other Commonwealth contracts in'
elude the building of a concrete and
brick power house, with steel truss
and corrugated asbestos cement roof,
for the P.M.G. Department in Frank'
lin Street, let to Martin Building Con'
tractors Ltd. at <£9,328, and a timber
piling job, the erection of a naviga'
tion light structure in Spencer Gulf,
let to L. McMillan for £11,589.
The only major State Government
contract last month was for the erec'
tion of brick workshops at Nailsworth
Boys’ Technical School, which went
to Marshall and Brougham at about
£28,000.
Hospitals and schools are providing
many jobs in the medium range. R.
J. Barratt Ltd., of Whyalla, have the
contract for alterations and additions
to Cleve District Hospital. The work
involves the building of new wards,
solarium, offices and one of two future
operating theatres. In the absence
of local bricks or stone, the job will
be in concrete bricks. It comprises
the first stage of adding to the exist'
ing nurses’ home to convert it into a
hospital, while the existing hospital,
which does not lend itself to addition,
does duty as the new nurses’ home.
Dean W. Berry and Gilbert are the
architects.
Tenders close with the same firm on
February 15 for alterations and addh
tions to Terowie Hospital, involving
an increase of bed capacity by adding
extensive sleepouts and outpatients’
rooms, and a steriliser room. The ad'
ditions will be in brick.
Tenders close at the end of January
with Milne, Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis
for a new maternity wing for Nara'
coorte Hospital. The new wing will
double the size of maternity acconv
modation with up'to'date facilities for
patients, staff and doctors. There
will be two delivery rooms, with ad'

Like any new building the modern hospital is
functional structure that is designed to meet to-day’s
need for a complete efficient medical service. One of
the most important factors that promote the effective
use of essential medical facilities is the lift service,
and it is significant that in almost every post-war
hospital the lifts have been by Otis. In Melbourne’s
Alfred Hospital there are a total of eight Otis Lifts
located in the various wings of the hospital.

rooms, food preparation rooms, show'
er and utility rooms and new entrance
and waiting hall, giving unusually high
standards for a country hospital. The
new wing, of about 4,000 sq. ft., will
be built of local stone, with insulated
iron roof, wood and concrete floors,
with rubber flooring and acoustic ceil'
ings in many rooms.
Tenders have just closed with Cara'
doc Ashton and Fisher for a new as'
sembly hall for Girton School, and ac'
ceptance has been deferred. The new
building, to be erected over portion
of the present school building, will be
110 by 40 ft., of brick with galvanised
iron roof in keeping with the present
structure.
H. H. Jory is calling tenders, clos'
ing on January 30, for a convent
boarding school and separate classroom
building at Yorketown. The board'
ing house comprises a large dormi'
tory, kitchen block and services, and
the classroom building two rooms 20
by 25 ft., with a 10ft. verandah on
one side. Both buildings will be
single storey, of brick and local stone,
with iron roofs.
Tenders are being called by Gordon
C. Brown for the second stage of new
building work at Wesley College.
This will comprise a two-storeyed
chapel in modern Gothic design in
cream brick, with imitation stone sur-
rounds, and four lecture rooms in
brick, two under the chapel, and two
separately, capable of being thrown
together to make an assembly hall.
Tenders have closed for the first work
for the college, a dormitory block, and
acceptance has been deferred.
Tenders close on January 25 with
Milne, Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis for
the Blackwood and District War Mem-
orial Hall. Designed on clean, mod'
ern lines, the building includes a hall
to seat 500, stage and dressing rooms,
supper room and offices.
Work on major alterations to the
city Mayfair Theatre has been de-
ferred until the beginning of winter
because of possible interference with
summer trade of the Norfolk Hotel,
another lessee of the same building.
The work involves complete remodel'
ling of stalls and circle, to make a
first-class, “intimate” theatre, with new
foyers, and air-conditioning. The
work has been let on a cost-plus basis
to F. Fricker Ltd. Lawson, Cheesman
and Doley are the architects.
Industrial building contracts have
tapered off during the holidays, but
some small jobs have been let. H. G.
Egarr and Sons have the contract for
extension and alterations of a build-
ing to make five shops at Belair, at
between £6OOO and £7OOO. Tenders
have closed, and are awaiting accept'
ance with Caradoc Ashton and Fisher
for a two'Storeyed building, compris'
ing banking chamber, with office space
above, for the Savings Bank of S.A.
at Port Augusta. The building, about
50 ft. square, is of local bricks and
concrete.
Tenders close on January 16 with
E. A. Keal for a machinery showroom
and warehouse at Cummins, on Eyre
Peninsula, for W. B. Walkom, agents
for McKay, Massey-Harris. The build'
ing will be 54 ft. square, with Min.
brick walls, terracotta tiled front, and
steel frame monitor roof. Red bricks
are specified, but owing to the absence
of local supplies, concrete bricks will
probably be used.
A new factory, although so far on
only a small scale, is planned for the
growing industrial area along South
Road, Milne, Dawkins, Boehm and
Ellis are calling tenders for a brick
and concrete factory of about 2,000
sq. ft. for Floorover Floor Polish Co.,
a new firm. The factory, like many
others in the area, is planned to allow
for considerable extensions.
The “noxious trades” area at Wing'
field is the scene of more and more
building activity. Woods, Bagot, Lay'
bourne Smith and Irwin have let con'
tracts to Forwood Down and Co. and
Fricker Brothers for a skin store for
William Haughton & Co., wool and
skin merchants. The building will be
steel'framed, roofed with asbestos
cement. Selby A. Chinnery is calling
tenders for garage and office block
and amenities to factory premises in
the same area for Master Butchers Ltd.
Dozens of contracts of a kind that
occurs only at long intervals are being
let throughout the city—for Royal
Tour decorations. Some of these are
quite large, one example being the
work on the C.M.L. Building, one of
the city’s largest, involving bunting,
trophies and lights, let to V. Antalffy
and O. J. Nilsen Ss? Co.
Easing of the shortages of some
building materials is foreseen in
1954, notably the cement famine
which still continues. The S.A. Port'
land Cement Co. expects to complete
its second kiln at Angaston by the
middle of the year, and this will lift
the firm’s production from 90,000 to
150,000 tons a year.
There is no sign of any relief from
the shortage of galvanised iron, and
the S.A. Housing Trust is still using
imported iron. Largely due to the
scarcity of suitable labor, clay bricks
are still scarce.
Improvement in supplies of cement
is expected to coincide with greatly
increased production of concrete
bricks. A concrete brick press has
been installed at the works of Con'
Crete Industries (S.A.) Pty. Ltd., in
the former Brighton Cement plant,
and a production rate of about 24,000
daily is forecast by the end of this
month. The same firm is producing
about 4,000 concrete tiles a day, and
expects to be making monocrete units
early this year.
GLASS BRICKS IN BUILDING.
The introduction of glass bricks had a
profound influence upon architectural de-
sign for it was a functional building ma-
terial as well as possessing a strong dec-
orative efiect. American industrial de-
signers, who employ them a great deal
claim that glass wall panelling diffuse
light far better than ordinary windows,
and provide privacy along with light.
They also reduce heat loss and conden-
sation. prevent the infiltration of dust
and dirt, and reduce the cost of air
conditioning.
The top building is the National Die
Casting Company's office at Chicago,
while that below is the Douglas Aircraft
Company's office at Santa Monica, Cali-
fornia. It is claimed by the manufactur-
ers of glass bricks that they are ideal
for use in hangars, airport buildings and
airline ticket offices, because they are
practical as well as a beautiful building
material.

Planning and Mass-Production Methods
in Community Development
The continued growth of cities in
the United States has created a prob'
lem for families who must live in or
near big towns but yearn to escape
from the traffic congestion, higher tax
rates and other urban problems. The
solution seems to be new suburban
developments which are springing up
around older urban centres. Some'
times the developments take the form
of new areas on the outskirts of estab'
lished suburbs. Sometimes whole
new cities are created, giving muni'
cipal experts a chance to put into
practice the latest concepts of com'
munity planning.
The most spectacular projects of
this type since World War II have
been carried out by the firm of Levitt
fe? Sons. Very few can match the
vast scale on which that company
operates, but everyone interested in
home building, homeowning or com'
munity planning can learn from what
the Levitts have accomplished. Their
success stands as proof that free enter-
prise is a dynamic force in American
life.
The Levitts’ experience during
World War II convinced them that
they could mass-produce houses profit-
ably— to both themselves and the
buyers. While they were putting up
2350 homes at Norfolk, Virginia, the
firm began planning the construction
of a new peace-time community on
Long Island, New York. Construc-
tion of what is now Levittown, Long
Island, began in the spring of 1947.
With it blossomed a new and hope-
ful concept of city planning. The
17,449 th Levittown house was finished
in 1951, and two years later the town
had a population of about 75,000.
The community has seven complete
shopping centres, several public
schools, a dozen churches, nine swim-
ming pools, a baseball and other ath'
letic fields, and numerous parks and
children’s playgrounds. A town hall
also graces Parkway Village Green.
This was the largest community
ever built by a single company. Yet
the Levitts had more ambitious plans.
The Long Island project, immense as
it was, had been carried out piece'
meal. Basically, it represented a giant
housing development in which the
firm perfected its mass' construction
techniques. What the firm really
wanted was to put its resources and
skills to work in building a whole
community a suburban haven in
which the latest concepts of town
planners could be realised.
Months before the completion of
the Long Island project, William
Levitt, who heads the firm, had been
exploring the nation’s critical housing
areas to find the most logical site for
a new Levittown. After much search'
ing he located what seemed the perfect
site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
New industries representing invest'
ments of some 500,000,000 dollars
(£A.222,000,000) were moving into
the area. United States Steel’s Fair'
less Works would be the core of a
development which probably would
fill the area between Trenton, New
Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
within the next generation.
The Levitts acquired 5000 acres of
land. This huge piece of real estate
was bounded on one side by the Penn'
sylvania Railroad and boxed in on two
sides by highways which speed traffic
to Trenton and Philadelphia. The
goal was to build a city of 70,000
population which would have the con'
venience, the closeness and the friend'
liness of a small town. The planners
carefully examined the layouts of
many model communities and decided
to build a series of small towns, each
one more or less self-sufficient and
separate from the others. Instead of
the traditional gridiron pattern which
gives monotony to many cities, Levitt
planners fashioned a system of curv'
ing streets built around the “master'
block” idea. Each so'called master
block is composed of two or three
compact neighbourhoods of 300 or
400 houses enclosed by a drive.
Names of the drive ssupply the key
initial letter for all streets inside the
neighbourhood.
The Stonybrook Section, for
example, is circumscribed by Stony'
brook Drive, and each street within
this section leads into the peripheral
boulevard. The name of each street
in this section begins with the letter
“S.” Thus a total stranger can easily
find his way. He locates the Stony'
brook section and travels along Stony'
brook Drive until he comes to the de'
sired street. Each master'block has
its own school facilities, recreational
aera and swimming pool.
Layouts for roads have been devised
so that no child will have to cross
a main artery to reach school. While
there is to be one main shopping
centre, there will be small neighbour'
hood shops within walking distance of
every home. Large sites are pro'
vided for churches of various denomi'
nations and provision has been made
for elementary, junior and senior
(secondary) schools.
To avoid the peasdn'a'pod look of
some reahestate developments, the
Levitts offer buyers four variations of
house design and five exterior colour
schemes. Another device to relieve
monotony was setting the houses in
staggered positions along the curving
streets.
Here, then, is the Levitts’ answer
to the problem of bigness: Keep resi'
dential areas to the smallest efficient
units. Only in smallness can a feel'
ing of individuality and community
pride be nurtured.
Continued on page 59
MASS-PRODUCTION OF HOMES IN U.S.A.
Built at the rate of 150 each day, the homes at Levittown, Pennsylvania show variety and individuality since they are placed
in staggered positions along curving streets. Colour schemes and designs vary to suit the landscape which has been provided
with different shrubs, trees and flowers. The city of 70,000 actually is composed of a series of small towns planned to avoid
big-city problems while offering big-city conveniences to home-owners, who are, in the main, employees in nearby industries.

Continued from page 57
While plans were developing, Alfred
Levitt, who designs the firm’s houses,
was experimenting in an isolated part
of Long Island. He was trying to
achieve two things: to design the best
possible house to sell at a price which
would attract the mass market which
Levitts’ large-scale production methods
demand, and to reduce construction
costs through efficient design so price
would be lower than that for any
other similar dwelling.
He decided on a snug, one-storey
ranch-style home with many con-
veniences and accessories. These in-
clude a wood-burning fireplace open-
ing into three rooms, radiant heating
from tubes embedded in the concrete
foundation slab, a modern electric
kitchen, a large Thermopane window,
a sliding, sound-proof bamboo parti-
tion which closes to add a third bed-
rom ,and, when open, makes the living
room a spacious 27ft. by 12ft. The
house sits on a 70ft .by 100 ft. lot and
has attached a carport and utility room
for tools or garden equipment. Shrub-
bery ,trees and decorative plants are
supplied by the builders. Every
house gets a total of 56 different
items, including maple, pine, willow
and fruit trees, ivy, climbing rose,
grape, and various shrubs such as
mountain laurels, rhododendrons,
azaleas and myrtles.
One of the most ambitious features
of the new city will be its shopping
centre, which will cover 50 acres and
provide 330,000 square feet of ground-
floor space in seven master-store build-
ings. The shopping centre will take
an L-shaped mall pattern, set well off
the highway and centring on a park-
ing area with space for 5000 auto-
mobiles. The store buildings are
double-ended to improve traffic flow
and furnish front-and-rear window
space. Due to the compact layout,
every store will be within easy walk-
ing distance of any given point in
the parking area.
One of the noteworthy features of
this shopping centre is a town hall,
already completed and utilised by the
Levitt organisation as an administra-
tion building. Ultimately it will be
turned over to the community for
recreational and civic purposes as a
gift from the firm.
This Levittown building schedule
includes eight large swimming pools—
one for each 2000 homes—ten regu-
lation baseball diamonds and dozens
of other athletic fields and play-
grounds. Provision of these sports
facilities anticipates that the town’s
population will be made up largely of
comparatively young adults and their
families.
The construction of the first homes
at Levittown, Pennsylvania, got under
way in April, 1952, and followed the
Levitt pattern—the assembly line in
reverse. Instead of the product mov-
ing past the worker on a conveyor,
the Levittown worker goes past the
unit which is being assembled.
The street system was completed
and surfaced first. Then trucks began
rumbling over the new roadways, stop-
ping every 70 feet to deposit predeter-
mined quantities of lumber, pipes,
bricks, steel tubing ,shingle-slabs and
other materials. Giant earth-removing
machines scooped out a rectangular
trench 25ft .by 35ft. at each site.
Then portable cement-mixers laid
foundations four inches thick.
After the quick-drying cement had
hardened, small groups of men de-
scended on the row of new-laid slabs.
Working in twos and threes they laid
bricks, erected wooden framework,
nailed on siding, sprayed on paint,
applied shingling and accomplished
other specialised tasks. Although 3500
men worked on the Pennsylvania pro-
ject in 1952, a visitor could hardly
find them because they were in small
groups spread out over many acres.
In the summer of 1953, construc-
tion was going ahead full swing, with
production reaching 150 houses per
day. The Levittown timetable calls
for 6000 homes to be completed in
1953 and an equal number in 1954.
About 13,000 of the 16,000 homes
to be erected in the new Levittown
will be the inexpensive model. Feel-
ing that there was a substantial market
for more pretentious homes, the firm
plans to build about 2000 larger homes
on larger lots.
Levittown railroad sidings receive
an average of 40 carloads of materials
a day during the building season, be'
sides almost a score of truck-trailer,
loads. A large part is moved directly to
the house sites, and the rest to ware-
houses or workshops. Warehouses have
been estimated to contain at all times
enough material to build 500 homes.
In 1951 Levitt 6? Sons used
57.600.000 feet of,lumber, 1500 miles
of tubing for radiant heating,
24.084.000 square feet of floor tile,
290.000 cubic yards of cement, and
1.927.000 pounds of nails. Among
household appliances purchased in
trainload lots from manufacturers
were 4945 automatic washing machines
and a like number of refrigerators and
electric ranges. Public utilities in-
cluded some 47 miles of water mains.
The public utilities alone required 800
carloads of cement.
Levittown, Pennsylvania, is a prac-
tical demonstration that community
planning is successful. Perhaps most
important, the new community is a
monument to American initiative and
private enterprise. For the success of
Levittown in Pennsylvania and Long
Island rests upon the willingness of a
private firm to pioneer new technique?
which enable it to better serve the
buying public.

SKYSCRAPER FLATS.
FINSBURY, LONDON.
Skyscraper flats which have been open-
ed in Finsbury, London, are the tallest
in Britain. The building is in three sec-
tions and the 12 storeys are 118ft. high,
providing modern and compact accom-
modation for 118 families. Each flat
has its own private balcony.
LESSENING THE SLUMS
IN ENGLAND.
These five-storey blocks of flats, 282 all
told, are spread over a site of 5 acres.
The balconies overlook Wells Common.
There is a plan to build 242 flats on
acres at Subiaco. The highest density
permitted by the London County Coun-
cil is 200 persons an acre and this only
in the inner central core, otherwise 55
dwellings to the acre. The national
standard is 3.6 persons to the family.
Some tall buildings in London, of ten
storeys or more, house 1,000 flats. Gas-
coigne Estate, Hackney, has 52.7 dwell-
ings to the acre; Mersey Estate, Isling-
ton, has 52. Tufnell Park, Islington, has
50. Tanners Hill. Deptford, has 49.5.
where 235,000 are living on 3,092 acres.
Rents vary from 8/6 for a one-room flat
to £1/3/7 for a 5-room flat, which rent-
al includes rates, hot water, central heat-
ing and other services. Many of the
100,000 Londoners, who had their dwel-
ings bombed out, are now accommodat-
ed in flats.

The Undermining of
Civilisation
Dr. E. von Hofmannsthal.
We are living in a besieged fortress
without realising it. From Moscow to
Cairo, from Madrid to Buenos Aires,
from Peiping to Guatemala the enemy,
fascists and communists united, is
building his lines of attack. The free
territories are shrinking gradually,
but we do not mind, we do not watch
the danger signals, we do not act.
We hardly talk about the recession
of civilisation.
And worse, we allow the enemy to
infiltrate into the beseiged fortress.
By accepting ideas of the enemy we
are sapping our defense.
Confiscation, open and hidden, is
such a totalitarian principle. Com-
munism and fascism strive on confis-
cation directed against all owners or
against selected groups of owners. It
is homogenous to their legal and econ-
omic systems but poisonous for any
democratic system, as it violates the
Human Rights of Property and of
Labour, property being only the can-
ned product of labour.
Now, unfortunately, most demo-
cratic countries have introduced this
strange element into their laws
through the backyard. Confiscation
through taxation, through money re-
strictions, through arbitrary acts on all
levels of administration, through con-
cer t e d actions of organisations,
through nationalisation without full
and prompt compensation, through
the extensive recognition of the
immunity of governments, confis-
cation in times of war against enemies
and constructive enemies, confiscation
in times of peace against discriminated
groups have converted the shield of
law into a sieve. To lawyers and civil
servants confiscation appears permis-
sible provided it is veiled under an-
other name and directed against the
other fellow. But as soon as you let
water into a bag of sugar you cannot
control where it stops.
Retroactive law is another totalitar-
ian principle. It is contrary to demo-
cratic law but adequate to the so-call-
ed “LAW” of totalitarian countries.
The one aims at safety and at the pro-
tection of the weak against the power-
ful, including the state. The other
aims at creating unsafely in order to
make the individual helpless in front
of the state. If retroactive penal law is
accepted, nobody is safe, as any-
one of his acts may be declared crim-
inal by subsequent legislation. This
unsafely is the atmosphere needed by
dictators. In the famous discussion
at the Conference for Comparative
Law at The Hague, 1937, a delega-
tion of Nazi lawyers tried hard to
convince jurists of the whole world of
the usefulness of retroactive criminal
law. They were rebuffed by repre-
sentatives of all countries, including
even fascist Italy, to whom retroactive
law seemed incompatible with their
concepts of justice, until that difference
between the aims of democratic and
totalitarian law was pointed out.
To Vishinsky, who in his introduc-
tion to the Soviet Code of Penal Pro-
cedure has declared openly that under
his concept of law it is merely a weap-
on in the class struggle, in the fight
of communism against capitalism, a
poisoned weapon like retroactive law
must be welcome. A democratic leg-
islator who applies retroactive law in
one corner of law commits
suicide by instalments.
But what is retroactive law? Only
that law that threatens acts committed
before its promulgation? Safety can
also be undermined by presenting fu-
ture acts related to previous facts.
Safety demands that everybody must
be in the position to know the legal
consequences of his acts. The client
who has entrusted his attorney with a
secret, protected at that moment by a
recognised privilege, was betrayed by
Nazi legislation on money restrictions
which threatened a lawyer for refusing
to reveal in the future confidential
communications received in the past.
Smokescreens veiling the retroactive
character of a law are only tricks of
the legislator. Such tricks are also
characteristics of totalitarian law.
One of the most dangerous attacks
on democratic law is the undermining
of the Human Right to Work. To
make this right contingent to the
membership of any group can destroy
it. No such membership to any
group can destroy it. No such mem-

bership to any group, be it national,
religious, racial or organisational must
be a precondition for putting brawn
or brain at the service of the society.
It is not decisive whether the group
is theoretically or in fact open to all,
as for instance Mohammedanism or
Communism or Fascism or only to
selected groups like Hinduism or
Nazism or certain unions of the Unit-
ed States which exclude foreigners or
outsiders.
Compulsion to enter certain groups
as a precondition of the right to work,
to become dependent on its leadership,
is in addition a violation of the demo-
cratic right to association. This prin-
ciple must not be confused with the
right to refuse work, the right to
strike. Legitimate right to strike con-
sists in the right to refuse work, but
not in the right to prevent others
from working. This essential distinc-
tion has been forgotten by demo-
cratic laws. If it endangers the effi-
ciency of strikes, all right: in really
democratic systems the right to strike
is not paramount over the right to
work.
Compulsory unionism incl uding
compulsory strikes is the counterpart
of the “work-book" created in all to-
talitarian countries for enslaving the
worker to the authorities of the state.
Compulsory unionism means the en-
slaving of the worker to the union
leaders, who are not restrained by an
instrument comparable to a constitu-
tion.
Another characteristic of totalitar-
ianism is any attempt to gag public
criticism. Argentina is a good ex-
ample of its effects. Criticism is the
strongest weapon of democracy. In
the great agglomerations of our times
it can only be wielded efficiently by
the press. Remedies against unjusti-
fied or wanton criticism are to be
found in good libel laws accessible
also to attacked groups, attacked of-
fices and to indigenous persons, dis-
tinguishing between intentional offen-
ces and mistakes made in good faith,
and including the obligation to cor-
rection. But endeavours to uniform
the press or to prevent it from criticis-
ing organs or organisations of the
state or other powerful institutions are
showing totalitarian tendencies, even
when they are veiled by tolerance of
“innocent" or welcome criticism as in
fascist or communist countries. Inde-
pendence of the press is the bulwark
of democratic law.
These are a few dogmatic examples
of the frequently unconscious, under-
mining of democratic law. For the
student of comparative law it is not
too difficult to recognise and to de-
scribe the symptoms of the creeping
disease. It is fascinating to investigate
which democratic systems are more or
less exposed to it; to study the ele-
ments of political life which make the
legal organisation 7 of a country more
or less resistant to such infiltration.
On the other hand, it behoves more
the national lawyers of each country
to watch the danger signals in their
own law and to fight the enemy be-
fore he enters the fortress or to
throw him out after he has succeeded
in doing it.
“Wonder” Clock Was
Hand Made
The most accurate clock in the
world, weighing four tons, has been
installed in Copenhagen Town Hall.
It has 110,000 parts. The clock will
gain only four-tenths of a second in
300 years.
Electrically governed, the clock has
12 main sections, including, of
course, the large main dial which
gives the ordinary time. Other dials
give the time as measured by the
stars, record movements of the moon
and earth round the sun, and movable
feasts. Time of sunrise and sunset
each day are shown; even eclipses
are “forecast" and recorded.
One amazing section of the clock
springs into action once a year—on
December 31—and takes about five
minutes to complete its complex func-
tion. It spreads the results over five
dials and a rectangular calendar.
The clock was planned in 1919 by
Jens Olsen, a clever Danish lock'
smith. But he lacked funds to pro-
ceed with it until 1944, when he be-
gan to make the intricate parts, main-
ly by hand. He died before his mas-
terpiece was finished. The world’s
finest clockmakers finished the task.

High Low Roof
Construction
In New British Steelworks.
An interesting feature of the mas-
sive Abbey Steel Works now in full
working production at Margam in
South Wales, Britain, is the roof con'
struction, which is of the new high'
low type and which was adopted after
various schemes had -been considered.
The roof has vertical glazing at the
breaks, the gantry girders being made
continuous over very long lengths.
These latter with their surge girders
attached are really space frames and
also be considered as horizontal struts.
Plain joist sections are used for the
purlins, but the maximum bending
moment has been reduced by canti'
levering the ends beyond the roof
frames and slinging the low roof steel'
work from these cantilevered ends.
By this means a 60ft. length of high
roof and a 20ft. length of low roof
are obtained with the main frames at
40ft. centres, and this proportion gives
an excellent appearance and a good
light distribution.
The practice is frequently adopted
in modern American rolling mills, but
so far as is known has only been used
once before for melting shop build'
ings. The method has many advan'
tages, including the fact that as the
roof is practically flat a permanent in'
sulated roof decking is used and there
are no valley gutters to cause drainage
problems or require continual main'
tenance.
The step between high and low roof
levels is glazed, giving an exceptionally
even distribution of light throughout
the building, and because the glazing
is vertical less dirt adheres to the sur'
face than would be the case with roof
lights. The sidewall glazing through'
out the works and the high'low roof
glazing in the cold mill includes a
series of tall imposing windows, curved
at the top, each over 14ft. wide and
ranging from 15ft. to 55ft. in height.
Standard “Aluminex” glazing bars are
used for the vertical members of the
windows and these are attached to
horizontal members of the same light
alloy. Extruded side bars ' hold the
side flashings in position.
The 55ft. windows are composed of
seven vertical tiers and each is sup'
ported on steel angle purlins by means
of the horizontal members formed from
special extrusions which provide com'
plete weathering at the junctions. The
vertical lines of the glazing bars, ex'
tending from the top of the coved
portion and then downwards vertically
to the sill, give a cascade appearance
to each window which is extremely at'
tractive.

man, dating back to 5000 years B.C.
Very old copper objects—vessels, urns
and water pipes—have been found in
pre'dynastic Egypt. A very interest'
ing and informative publication.
“Copper Pipeline Services in Build-
ing” (No. 25) contains much theoreti'
cal as well as practical instruction in
the use of copper pipes, fittings and
attachments normally required in
buildings. Dealing with long'establish'
ed plumbing practice in both heavy
and light gauge metal, it is an excel'
lent handbook for both designer and
craftsman.
“Copper Underground; Its Re-
sistance To Soil Corrosion” (No. 40).
This pamphlet contains experiences,
tests and standard requirements by
various authorities in the use of cop-
per for underground gas or water ser'
vices. It refers to British and American
data, codes and standards.
“Copper Flashings and Weather-

They are of the opinion that such
fine efforts as are being made by pri-
vate, municipal and government bodies
in honour of this historic occasion well
merit the Society’s Award.
The Award will be in the form of
a hand-lettered certificate that will in-
clude photographs of the winning in-
stallation, thus will be recorded the
most meritorious decorative lighting
installation of the Royal Visit. A
similar certificate will be awarded the
designer of the winning installation.

NEW FLOODLIGHTING UNIT.
Philip’s Altriflood.
Philip s Electrical Industries Pty.
Ltd. Ltd. announce the “Altriflood.”
This new fitting has been designed
for use with the existing range of re'
fleeter lamps: Altrilux, Attralux, Comp-
talux and the Repro-Mercury Lamp.
It can be operated in any position and
is adjustable, having the same foot and
pedestal as the standard under-awning
floodlight. The cover glass can be
clear or colour media can be fitted if
desired. When used with 500-watt
Altrilux lamps, the unit is equivalent
to a 750-watt medium beam floodlight.
It is claimed that the Altriflood is
a radical departure from previously
recognised forms of high-intensity
floodlight design and, as a result, can
solve floodlighting problems in hum
dreds of new applications.

THE FLOODLIT TOWER.
The square tower of an English church,
floodlit from the roof for the Corona-

a subtle interplay of light and shadow
bring out the beauty of the structure.
BEAUTY WITH LIGHT.
Westminster Abbey, beautiful at all
times, is beautified by light. The sym-
bolic architectural carvings are enhanc-
ed by the tracery of the light and con-
vey in a material way the finer aspects
of a perhaps less tangible "faith" for
which the noble building stands.

FOR WINDOW AND
COUNTER DISPLAYS
When planning displays of
merchandise, three important
factors should be considered.
Firstly, the display must attract
attention; secondly, it must
effectively advertise the pro-
ducts concerned, and thirdly,
it must combine these two in a
way that will actively stimulate
sales. A big step in providing
these essentials is to specify
Condor Inbuilt Reflector Lamps
because they are highly efficient
lighting “units” and can add
considerable “lift” to any
display. Make sure your goods
sell by using Condor Inbuilt
Reflector Lamps for all window,
wall, counter or floor displays.

WHAT IS ROBERTSON
PROTECTED METAL?
Robertson Protected Metal (R.P.M.)
is a steel sheet enclosed in a weather-
proof envelope of bitumen and asbes-
tos. It combines three minerals to
give a light, strong, maintenance-free
building covering. In the manufacture
of R.P.M., only the finest quality an-
nealed, cold rolled, scaleless, rust-free
steel sheets are employed.
Three Fold Protection.
To prevent the steel from damage when
exposed to corrosive atmospheres in industrial
or marine areas, it is hermetically sealed
from destructive elements by immersing in hot
bitumen. Then it is enclosed in an envelope
of tough asbestos felt which is simultaneously
rolled on both sides of the sheet and folded
around its edges while the bitumen is still hot.
This asbestos envelope serves to protect the
ductile, adhesive bitumen which coats the steel.
The third coating is applied when the sheet
is passed through a final molten bath of tough,
weather-resistant sealing bitumen which, on
cooling, provides the outer coating of the sheet.
The final manufacturing operation is corrugating
or bending the sheet to the form in which it
is to be employed.
The advantage of the use of Robertson Pro-
tected Metal is that at no time does it need
nainting, maintenance or replacement. It can
be removed and re-erected without any damage
to the laps or the roofing.

MODERN RE-HEAT POWER
PLANTS.
The thermal efficiencies of British
power stations are increasing each year
by the use of modern plant using
higher pressures and temperatures.
Hitherto, the emphasis has been on
the straight regenerative cycle in Great
Britain, but there are some installa-
lions where MetropolitanA/ickers Ltd.
machines with re'heat cycle have been
used to minimise boiler costs.
In the Littlebrook “B” Station,
which headed the list of the most
efficient British station with a thermal
efficiency of 29.95 per cent., the M.V.
machines are designed for initial con'
ditions of 1235 lb. per sq. in. at 825
degrees F., three'Stage 3000 r.p.m.
units reheating between the high and
intermediate pressure stages to 825 de'
grees. These are 48 and 60 M.W.
capacity.
The most recent development in
power station design in America is
that of a 120 M.W. 3000 r.p.m. unit
operating at 4500 lb. per sq. in., 1150
degrees Fahrenheit through reheat
stages 1200 lb. and 1050 degrees, and
180 lb. and 1000 degrees with double
reheat. It is designed to give a nett
overall plant heat conversion rate in
the order of 8500 B.Th.U. per kWh.

St. Bride’s, London, to be Re-built
Wren’s Original Plans Used.
St. Bride’s, in Fleet Street, was one
of Wren’s best'loved London churches. ‘
On Sunday, December 29th, 1940, it
was badly blitzed and little more than
a burned'out shell remained. For'
tunately, the famous spire remained
standing. During that terrible night
no fewer than eight of Wren’s city
churches were destroyed or severely
damaged.
Now, after lying derelict for eleven
years, proposals are in hand to restore
the church to Wren’s original design,
which in the passing years had been
subject to many changes.
This task of restoration, started in
1953, will be greatly simplified by the
fortunate existence of Wren’s original
plans.
It is 800 years since the first record'
ed reference to the church on the
banks of the old Fleet River, although
the dedication to St. Bride—or Bridget
—a 6th Century Irish Saint, suggests
that the foundation had an earlier be-
ginning.
The night in 1940 marked the
second occasion in its long history
that St. Bride’s had been destroyed by
fire, for it was burnt down in the
Great Fire of London in 1666. Re'
construction then started in 1671 and
took four years to build, the cost being
£11,430 without the steeple. The
present cost of reconstruction is estb
mated at £210,000.
The twelve bells in the steeple,
which were not actually struck, melt'
ed in the intense heat of the fire; they
were buried for preservation by the
then Vicar, who subsquently died,
without telling anyone where he buried
them, and so far they have not been
discovered.
With the possible exception of St.
Stephen’s, Walbrook, the interior of
St. Bride’s is perhaps the most im'
pressive of Wren’s city churches.
Mr. Godfrey Allen, M.A.,
F.R.1.8.A., is the architect for the re-
construction.
COPPER ODDS AND ENDS.
Copper is one of the first metals to
be employed by man. It has been
worked and fabricated possibly as far
back as 5000 B.C. Traces of early
applications of copper metallurgy have
been found in the valleys of the rivers
Tigris and Euphrates, believed to be
the birthplace of earliest civilisation.
Conner objects have been discover'
ed in Mesopotamia below the level of
the clay deposit left by the Great
Flood, believed to have occurred about
4000 B.C.
Earliest metallurgical furnaces had
shallow circular cavities to receive the
molten metal from the wood fire. It
is believed that the art of copper smelt'
ing was not known prior to 3500 8.C.,
although excellent copper castings were
produced long before this.
Egyptian wall paintings show blow'
pipes in use with small furnaces as
early as the Fifth Dynasty, Circa 2690'
2420 B.C. Bellows were used in
1500 B.C.
CORONATION FLOODLIGHTING.

delicate architecture and slender tap-
ering spire is brilliantly flood-lighted to

ARCHITECTS’ DETAIL
SHEETS.
Excellent New Book.
{“Architects’ Detail Sheets,” edited
by Edward D. Mills, F.R.1.8.A.
22 pages. Iliffe & Sons Ltd.,
London. English price, 25/'.]
The question of detail design in
modern buildings is one of consider-
able importance, for many of the early
examples of contemporary architecture,
while successful as broad concepts,
failed in detail. As a result they have
not successfully withstood conditions
of weather and daily use, and have
required extensive maintenance during
their relative short life. This state of
affairs can be largely avoided by the
exercise of greater care in the detailed
design of the structure at critical points
and a better understanding by archi-
tects of the nature and behaviour of
the materials used, as well as their
proper application. Good architect
tural detailing is both a practical and
an aesthetic problem, and the object
of the detail sheets published in this
book is to show in actual examples
how contemporary designers have com'
bined. in recent modern buildings,
good construction and satisfactory ap-
pearance.
One is used to seeing in the tech-
nical Press of the world the latest
examples of building and architectural
development in photographic form
which, while excellent, does not always
reveal the fine points of construction.
In this series of 96 selected details,
the photograph of the finished article
is on the right-hand page, while on
the left immediately opposite is the
detail drawing setting out construction
and material details to a good size on
a page 12in. by 9£in.
That the scope is wide is empha-
sised by such diverse examples as the
dramatic foundations to Le Corbusier’s
Radiant City at Marseilles to the cleres-
tory lighting at Rotterdam’s famous
“Bouwcentrum; the extraordinary tubu-
lar monument to the “Dead of Maut-
hausen” in Milan’s cemetery to the
pre-stressed reinforced concrete stand
at the Building Exhibition at Olympia;
a jeweller’s shop in San Francisco to
the Swiss Tourist Office in London.
The sheets have been selected from
those which have appeared regularly
in the British weekly journal “The
Architect and Building News” during
the past few years, and well-known
architects both in Britain and abroad
have co-operated in contributing mate-
rial and information from which the
sheets have been prepared.
The selected examples are arranged
in appropriate groupings and cover a
wide range of problems from windows
and door openings to staircases, fire-
places and internal fittings and furni-
ture. An English - French - German-
Spanish glossary of the terms used is
also provided.
Both architectural students and prac-
tising architects will find much of value
in the book, for while it is not intend-
ed to be a textbook of recommended
building construction, much can be
learned by an examination of the ways
in which architects in different coun-
tries and working under different con-
ditions tackle similar detail problems.

Crete, and sufficient is given of the
theory of reinforced concrete to en-
able such structures to be designed.
Various methods of analysis of
statically ' indeterminate structures are
given. The method of fixed points,
which allows a semi'graphical solution
of sufficient accuracy for practical pur'
poses to be obtained rapidly, is ex-
plained in detail for continuous beams
and frames. There are many numeri-
cal examples and an appendix gives
complete calculations for the analysis
of a portal frame bridge with beams
of varying depth and supported on
piled foundations.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
OF ELECTRIC POWER
IN EUROPE.
A significant development in post'
war Europe is the considerable growth
of exchange of electric power across
national territorial boundaries.
This has been promoted by the
United Nations Economic Commission
as a means of speeding up industrial
recovery and also to obviate the need
for power stations in close proximity
on opposite sides of the boundary.
The transmission of electricity for
short distances is economical, but for
long-distances it is costly. However,
where water power generation is avail'
able the lower cost of generation of
that means compensates for the longer
distance it may have to be transmitted.
The progress made in the technique
of long distance transmission is in'
creasing the distance of penetration
inside each country, but it is governed
by local conditions and density of
population.
In 1951 the total transfers of elec'
trie power between nine countries in
Western Europe amounted to 4000
million kWh., only 2.5 per cent, of the
total consumption in the countries to
which the exchanges were made.

Security Round The
World
Chubb:.’ Chairman in Sydney.
Mr. H. Emory Chubb, C.8.E., M.I.
MechE., Chairman of Chubb & Sons
Lock fe? Safe Co. Ltd., London, is at
present in Sydney in the course of a
world tour of his company’s interests.
Mr. Chubb, a fine English. gentle-
man, representative of the very best
of British traditional business, is no
stranger to Australia, for he has for-
gotten how many times he has visited
this country since 1914, when his or-
ganisation carried out important con-
tracts for the new Commonwealth
Bank Head Office in Sydney.
Since then they have been almost
continuously supplying security equip-
ment to this organisation as well as to
the trading banks and insurance com-
panies throughout Australia.
Chatting in the office of Mr. Robert
Richard, Managing Director of Chubbs
Australian Company Ltd., Mr. Chubb
said with quiet pride that 1953 had
been a record year for the parent com-
pany in England as well as for the
companies in South Africa and Aus-
tralia. Expansion continues and a
site had recently been purchased in
Canada where a new factory was to be
built, while arrangements were being
completed, in conjunction with a local
firm, to manufacture in Bombay. The
company was pursuing a policy of in-
terchange of executive and managerial
staff throughout the British Common-
wealth and this was proving most bene-
ficial to all concerned.
Collective Security.
In these days of uncertainty there
was a great desire by many people to
have some means of keeping safe
their valuables and documents and as
a result the demand for safe deposit
accommodation was greatly increasing;
the company were engaged in large
installations in Colombo, Singapore,
Venezuela and Rio de Janeiro to name
but a few. He called this tendency
a commonsense policy of “collective
security.”
Chubb security, built up by suc-
ceeding generations of the Chubb fam-
ily, is a tradition throughout the
world. The policy has always been
to produce the best possible. This
goes on, for in Mr. Emory Chubb’s
words “The Essence of Progress is
Test and Research.”
Mr. Chubb will be in Australia for
several weeks.

INTERSTATE DISTRIBUTORS ATTEND EXIDE SALES CONVENTION.
When Exide Batteries of Australia Pty. Ltd. held their 1953 Distributors' Sales Convention this year, it marked the resumption
of an Annual meeting that had been interrupted by the Second World War. The Convention was held in the Bligh Room of
Adam s Tattersalls Hotel, commencing on October 26 and continuing through till the 29th. Representatives of all the Exide
interstate distributors were present, together with Executives of the Exide Company. In opening the meeting with an ad-
dress of welcome to the distributors, Mr. Gilbert Graham announced the official appointment of Mr. George W. Graham as
Assistant General Manager of the Company. The three-day Conterenced, ending with a tour of the factory at Padstow and
Service Depot at Burwood, presented to the distributors solutions to many trading problems, and was considered a great success
in all directions. The photograph shows the assembly at the official dinner, attended by the distributors, executives and
directors of the Company.

TOGGEL ACTION CLAMPS.
P.T. Industries Pty. Ltd.
Toggel Action Clamps, now well'
established in America and England,
are becoming increasingly appreciated
in Australian industry and large Aus'
tralian concerns now regularly specify
P.T. Clamps wherever instantaneous
clamping and release of the work is
required.
For any type of production calling
for clamping of metal, wood or plastic
parts during welding, drilling, milling,
machining, grinding, riveting, glueing,
sawing or assembly operations, P.T.
Clamps are a means for swifter and
more accurate production.
The range of P.T. Clamps is em
gineered in such a fashion that if an
operator should not seat a part cor'
rectly in the fixture it will not readily
fall into position. The normal time
for opening and closing of a P.T.
Clamp is less than two seconds.
The range of Toggel Action Clamps,
manufactured by P.T. Industries Pty.
Ltd., 16 Brighton Road, St. Kilda. are
all made trom one'piece cold'drawn
carbon steel. There is no danger of
these separating under heat of welding
or similar operations.
P.T. Industries have a type and size
of Clamp for every need, from a mid'
get 2in. high to a giant clamp exerting
4000 lb. holding pressure, all of them
engineered and built to most efficient'
ly to do the job ensuring speed, ac'
curacy and ease of operation.
Professor of
Architectural Science
Dr. Cowan Arrives in Sydney.
The newly-appointed Professor of
Architectural Science at Sydney Uni'
versity. Dr. H. J. Cowan, arrived in
Sydney on the “Himalaya” last Sun'
day. He advocates the use of pre'
stressed concrete in large buildings as
a means of saving thousands of tons
of steel.
Dr. Cowan, who will be Australia’s
first Professor of Architectural Science,
said that prestressed concrete was con'
ditioned before use in building to

By its use large structures can be

Dr. Cowan’s work will include the
study of building structure and con'
struction materials, as well as the study
of lighting, heating, ventilating sys'
terns and acoustics.
He commented that he thought the
.Australian climate might well be one
of the most difficult problems facing
architects.

AUSTRALIA’S COLONIAL BUILDINGS
SHOULD THEY ALL BE PRESERVED?
Professor Bourke, who is Professor
of Fine Arts at Melbourne Univers'
ity, wants a Royal Commission set up
to investigate how to save the beauty
of “Colonial Australian Architecture.”
Lecturing at the summer school,
Albury, the professor said “It was a
tragedy that so many fine old Aus-
tralian buildings were now in a state
of disrepair.
“Unless a responsible body was con'
stituted, in a few years there would be
little left of the original architecture
of Australia.
“Too many people thought of the
future instead of building their
dreams on the excellence of past ex'
periments and success.
“Throughout Australia thousands of
grand old homes were falling apart,
and a Royal Commission must be
chartered to save them,” Professor
Burke added.
In Sydney.
This tragedy repeats itself constant'
ly in Sydney, where the graceful, lov'
ingly'built old homes of yesteryear are
meeting an ignoble, undeserved fate.
One of the saddest sights a “Con'
struction” reporter recently saw was
what is perhaps the oldest house in
Double Bay—and certainly the quaint'
est and most charming—being turned
into a Petrol Service Station!
Time marches on, while the ghosts
of our forefathers marvel at our idea
of “progress”.
We have to admit, however, that
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS. TASMANIA.
The Department has several vacancies on its Staff for Engineers and Architects and is
to discuss appointments with any persons interested in joining its staff.
Engineering vacancies include an Assistant District Engineer and an Engineer with water
experience (Eleadouarters, Hobart), and at least three Assistant Engineers for field
supervision of highway construction works. On the Architectural side, an experienced Design
Architect is required to handle Schools, new University Buildings and public Buildings generally.
Architects are required to assist in the above and in modern general hospital design, etc.
Salaries, including cost-of-living adjustment, are in the following ranges:—
Design Architect £1,408 - £1,564
Assistant District Engineer £1,369 - £1,486
Engineers or Architects .. .„ £1,135 - £1,369
Assistant Engineers or Architects £914 - £1,148
Commencing salary will depend on experience in the particular field required.
Basic qualifications *° r Engineers are a University Degree in Civil Engineering, Corporate
Membership of a recognised engineering institution or equivalent qualification. Architects must
be members of the A.R.I.A. or its equivalent.
The Department will possibly be able to arrange rented housing for married officers in
the centres in which thev are required to work.
Any interested persons are invited to forward details of their qualifications and professional
experience to the Director of Public Works, G.P.O. Box 662, Hobart, from whom further
particulars of duties, conditions of service, transfer expenses, etc., may be obtained.
whilst there is a measure of sentiment
attaching itself to some buildings (such
as Wentworth House, Vaucluse, where'
in our Constitution was signed) or
Macleay House, Elizabeth Bay, where
lived the donor of the Macleay Mus'
eum at Sydney University (which
houses the greatest number of insects
ever collected in the world), and we
desire to have these notable buildings
preserved, because of the great men
who lived in them in much about the
same way as the homes of Dickens
and Shakespeare have been preserved
in England, we must admit there is
no sense in keeping any structure
standing idly by after its scope for
usefulness has been spent, in order
that it may remain the unusuable hulk
of a spirit that has flown.
Beauty in buildings without use'
fulness is not sufficient to warrant
their remaining indefinitely, also have
we no architects or builders in our
day who can build equally well, and
leave their imprimateur on buildings
as did some of the architects and
builders in the past era?
What, for instance, could any mod'
ern architect do, were he called upon
to utilise building sites such as that OC'
cupied by the white'ant'ridden old
Mint Building in Macquarie Street,
Sydney, or the Georgian Barracks next
door, which have been most inappro'
priately requisitioned for modern uses
as Courts, when they are hopelessly
unfitted for their tasks? It is just a
rabbit warren with courts compressed
into tiny rooms. They bring nothing
but inconvenience to the high-rank'
ing people of our day who occupy*
them..

This photograph, from a leading mine
on the Witwatersrand, typifies South
Africa's major industry of gold-mining.
The circular clarifying tanks in the fore-

dustry is expected to benefit from the
present world trend towards the check-
ing of inflation and the stabilisation of
currencies.

Huge Hangar for Strato-Fortresses
DOORWAY 785 ft. LONG AND 65ft. HIGH.
A 780 ft. long and 206 ft. wide flight
test hangar built at Seattle, U.S.A.,
for the Boeing Airplane Company, is
believed to have the biggest roof and
unobstructed doorway in America, if
not in the world. The hangar will
house four 8—52 Strato-fortresses.
Only Two Columns.
The roof has only two supporting
columns. They are 260 ft. apart and
about 262 ft. from the ends of the
building. The columns are set on a
line running lengthwise through the
building, from the front door
and from the back wall.
The whole roof balances on these
two columns, but it is out of balance
because the front part is 40ft. wider
than the back. So the engineers set
a couple of anchors in the ground out-
side the hangar. As the construction
progressed they ran steel tension
columns from the anchors up to the
edge of the hangar roof to hold it
down.
Each of the supporting columns
bears about 5,000,000 pounds of
weight. Each of the anchor points is
subjected to an upward pull of about
33 3,000 pound.
Huge Doorway.
The doorway is 785 ft. long and
65ft. tall, and is fited with thirteen
vertical-lift canopy doors, each 60ft.
wide and 65ft. tall.
Each door is divided horizontally
into two sections. When a door is
raised, one section slides up behind
the other. Then both swing outward
at a right-angle, forming something
like a porch roof outside the hangar.
Cost of the entire building was ap-
proximately 5,622,000 dollars.
The upper walls of the hangar are
of corrugated galvanised steel with pre-
cast concrete walls below. Roofs of
both buildings are of ribbed steel, in-
sulated with Fiberglas and covered with
felt roofing.
Static Test Slab.
Another interesting item is the static
test slab, with hold-down tracks where
test engineers attach devices for apply-
ing stress loads to aircraft being tested.
The slab is from two to three feet
thick, roughly 195 ft. by 150 ft., and
contains 2012 cubic yards of concrete.
It also contains 114 tons of 12in. steel
channel assemblies and about thirty
miles of |in. and lin. reinforcing steel.
SUBMARINE LUXURY.
To attract volunteers for the sub'
marine service, the U.S. Navy De-
partment are offering hot and cold
running water, sun-tan lamps, and
lending libraries. Latest craft have
ceilings painted various shades of blue
to resemble the sky; sunsets and
dawns are provided by red and yellow
electric bulbs.
STRUCTURES, ARTISTIC AS WELL AS USEFUL

house, built at a cost of 100,000 dollars raised by public subscription, was recently
dedicated at Belle Isle, Mich., U.S.A. (Centre) Many elevated water towers, such

BRITAIN’S NEW OIL
REFINERIES.
Importance of Correct Lighting.
World production of oil and natural
gas is tO'day more than 130% above
the 1938 world figure this despite
the destruction of the war years and
the political boundaries which even
now hamper full development. The
total world output tops 640,000,000
metric tons a year, an astronomical
figure roughly equivalent to the world’s
total combined output of wheat, oats,
barley, rye and rice. And still the
demand exceeds the supply!
The British Commonwealth, for in-
stance, produces about 15,000,000 tons
of oil annually and consumes four
times that amount. Interesting, there'
fore, to British people is the 57'mile
line built across Scotland by Anglo'
Iranian to feed the refinery which was
opened at Grangemouth in 1951.
In the course of this long journey
—down all the miles from the well to
the jetty, through all the tons of mas'
sive equipment—electric power and
electric lighting are playing a vitally
important part. Powerful lights are
needed for all outdoor installations, so
that the work can go on without ces'
sation by night as well as by day.
(Once you get oil on the move, it
must not be allowed to stop.) Lights
are needed as well for the offices, the
camps, the houses of the company per'
sonnel. Some of these centres have
an electrical load equal to that of a
fair'sized town.
Lights Must Be
Flameproof.
The oil refinery, too, is very large-
ly dependent on electrical equipment,
and here the joint problems both of
flamproofing and of the best position'
ing of the installations become of
major importance. All equipment
within the danger area motors,
switches, light fittings must be
flameproof.
Lighting in particular must be
located with care. The pinpoints
which dot the structure of the re'
finery buildings at night, like spangles
in the hair of a pantomime fairy, are
in fact placed with meticulous care,
and with due consideration to the fall
of shadows on ladders, cat'walks and
runways.
Shell Haven
and Thames Haven.
Typical of the new oil refineries
being built in Britain—and of their
associated electrical and lighting prob'
lems—is Shell Haven, on the Thames
Estuary. Because of its excellent water
approaches, large expanse of flat land
of little agricultural or commercial
value, and abundant labour force, the
Estuary has from the early days of the
oil industry been a storage and re'
finery centre. Back in the 1920’5, a
refinery was established at Shell
Haven, and this is being successfully
expanded to an ultimate capacity of
3,000,000 tons a year.
Adjoining Shell Haven is Thames
Haven, containing the jetty facilities
and most of the tank storage capacity
for them both. It includes a £300,000
jetty, which is the largest in the
Thames Estuary and the first of its
kind in the world.
2000 Tons An Hour.
The new Thames Haven jetty can
accommodate the largest tankers, and
empty them at a rate of more than
2000 tons an hour; an operation which
involves a complicated system of der'
ricks, electric winches, flexible suction
hoses from ship to jetty, and banks
of steel piping from jetty to shore.
Tankers may dock at any tide—day or
night—and, when they do, forty
minutes of furious activity follow.
In such circumstances good lighting
is essential—not only on the jetty it'
self, but on the deck of the tanker.
All the equipment has, of course, to
be flameproof; and equally important,
it must be sufficiently robust to with'
stand exposure to the weather and
corrosive gases.
In order to ensure that these con'
ditions are complied with. The British
Thomson'Houston Company was ask'
ed to design fluorescent fittings for
both Shell Haven and Thames Haven,
the jetties of which became the first
in the world to be illuminated in this
safe and efficient manner. The fittings
consist of five industrial flameproof
units, each housing a sft. SOwatt
lamp, mounted on a multi'angle frame'
work, giving a high intensity of light
in any required direction as shown in
the accompanying illustration.
Such lighting is, of course, only
one of the contributions which the
B.T.H. Company is currently making
to the equipment and operation of the
oil industry. From the Rugby Works
and other B.T.H. factories come
various items of heavy electrical equip'
ment ranging from the three 18,725'
FLAMEPROOF FLUORESCENT FITTINGS.
The new oil jetties at the Thames Haven oil refinery are illuminated by Mazda
flameproof fluorescent fittings.

CAPACITIES OF PLUMBING
STACKS.
Assessing Pipe Sizes.
The problem of the capacity of a
vertical plumbing drainage stack in a
building has never been solved satis-
factorily.
The “Capacities of Plumbing Stacks
in Buildings,” by Robert S. Wyly and
Herbert N. Eaton, of the U.S. National
Bureau of Standards Building Mate'
rials and Structures, reports an attempt
to ascertain the maximum load that
can be brought into the stack from a
horizontal branch when water is being
discharged down the stack from fix-
tures on higher floors one of the
more complicated problems of stack
capacities. A theoretical approach to
the problem resulted in a formula,
which was then tested by experiment.
Obviously, no building drainage sys'
tern can be designed economically un'
less the minimum sizes of pipes to be
used can be predicted. The first phase
of a projected complete investigation
is concentrated on the drainage stack
and its horizontal branches, which
comprise most of the larger pipes used
in the system.
The report summarises previous re'
search on stack capacities and gives an
account of attempts to define stack
capacity. It outlines the problem of
stack capacity, describes tests to deter-
mine terminal velocities and terminal
lengths in stacks and tests on stacks
and drains, and analyses hydraulic and
pneumatic conditions in a stack in a
multi'storey building. It also suggests
applications of the results of the in-
vestigations and lists references to rele-
vant literature.

OPERATION RESCUE.”
Repairing Five Million British Homes.
Work For Small Builders.
Speaking at the opening of the
recent Building Exhibition in London,
Mr. Harold Macmillan, Minister of
Housing, referred to Operation
Rescue" and said to carry this out he
had to call in, not merely the great
contractors and the big builders, but
the small men —the jobbing builders —
accustomed to repair work of all kinds.
This was just the job for them.
“The amount of work needed per
old house will vary enormously," said
Mr. Macmillan. “For the majority it
will be just current repairs to houses
in reasonably good condition. There
may be four or five million such
houses, and though it may be only a
matter of £lO to £2O per house, all
this adds up to quite a lot when you
put it together. Then there will be
the bigger jobs, where the houses are
in a worse condition, and in some in'
stances local authorities will have to
help.
“What a chance all this is for the
building industry to take another step
forward! I told you two years ago
that I would keep the order book full.
Some say I have kept it too full —and
here I am, filling it up again! But I
believe that you will respond, as you
have in the past. The more we try
to do, the more we shall achieve.
Concern Over Cost.
“We are all concerned about the
level of costs, and the building indus'
try can do much to help us to meet
the problem. Some of the answers
may be here in this Exhibition, if
those who could make use of them
will do so with foresight and energy.
“There can be little doubt that there
are wide divergences in productivity
within the industry. A council house
takes some 1560 mamhours to build
in some parts of the country and three
times as many in other parts. True,
conditions vary from contract to con'
tract, but not to this degree. What
is the explanation? Ought we not to
do something about it?
“Don’t forget, the amount which
owners of property, the local authori'
ties and the nation at large can afford
to do to give us better housing de'
pends to a very great extent on the
building industry, both managements
and man, and on the building materials
industry.
“ ’Operation Rescue’ is more than a
policy. It is a challenge. The chah
lenge is ‘Can you do it, and do it at
a reasonable cost?’ I am sure that
you can. and that you will.”
