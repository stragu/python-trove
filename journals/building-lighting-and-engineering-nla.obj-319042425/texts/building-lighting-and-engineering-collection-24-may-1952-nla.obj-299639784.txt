Try the test at the right! It will prove to you
beyond all doubt that Masonite Tempered
Presdwood is 100% satisfactory for external
building applications. Not only is Tempered
Presdwood strongly moisture-resistant —it is far
more adaptable to your ideas of construction and
finish than any other board. You can bend Masonite,
punch it, saw it, plane it. Masonite is hard, smooth and
grainless, with great structural strength and dimen-
sional stability. It takes and holds any applied finish.
BEFORE
Take a piece of
Masonite Tempered
Presdwood (write
for a sample if you
wish). Leave it in
a container of water
for as many days—or
months —or years—
as you like. Remove
the Tempered Presd-
wood occasionally
and check it against
a dry sample. You
w 7 ill find that size,
stability, rigidity and
surface are com-
pletely unaffected by
the moisture.

THE PAINT PIGMENT
with A DIFFERENCE
The main difference between Alpaste and
other paint pigments is that it is not
granular in form. Alpaste consists of com-
mercially pure "atomised" aluminium,
which, when milled and polished, produces
finy, flat and very thin leaf-shaped particles.
These particles arrange themselves in over-
laooing parallel layers when mixed with suit-
ible vehicles. The result is an improved and

the University, which was the subject of a worldwide architectural
competition for the design and was won by Melbourne firm of
Rodney Alsop and Conrad Sayer. It is designed in a modern

LEARNING AND TRADITION
THE AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL, CANBERRA.
The Australian War Memorial gives tangible form to Australia’s
Nationhood achieved in World War I and consolidated in the
second great struggle against Germany and Japan. The fine
building, the design of which was the subject of an architectural
competition and was won by Emil Sodersteen and John Crust (in
association), was officially opened by the Lord
Cowrie, on Armistice Day, 1941—at the beginning of the second
great world war. The Memorial, which will preserve for all time
the fighting tradition of the Ansae and the “Digger,” occupies a
unique position in Australian life.

MODERN MOTOR CAR DISPLAY
FINE NEW SHOWROOM AT MOSMAN, SYDNEY.
THE MOTOR CAR IN MODERN LIFE.
The motor car, from a standing start some fifty
years ago, has materially changed our lives
and today it is difficult to overestimate its
importance in industry, transport and amenity.
Unfortunately, since the war it has become more
and more costly and consequently the settings
in which it is proudly displayed have also
increased in luxury and ostentation. In this
new example, the sleek Holden —the procuring
of which is the desire of so many —is displayed
amongst gleaming surroundings, bathed in light
like the most precious gem in a jeweller s
window, (See article on page 81)
NEW MOTOR SHOWROOM AT MOSMAN.
Supporting stanchions have been reduced to the absolute minimum of four slender steel uprights
so as to present no obstruction to view the interior of this fine new showroom for Holden cars
recently completed in Military Road, Mosman, for Mr. Norman G. Booth. The illustration
shows the showroom at night. Architects: C. W. Spinks & J. L. Sever.
ATTRACTIVE NEW SHOWROOM.
Natural light penetrates the interior of this new Sydney
showroom by means of clere-story lights above the cantilever
awning, but eye comfort is assured and glare eliminated by
the introduction of a continuous line of louvres, as shown
in the upper view. Artificial lighting is fluorescent. The
lower view, in a setting of foliage which indicates that not
all commercial houses arc bereft of art, displays the bold
recessed name panels on both sides of the small tower-like
section.
FIRST-CLASS DISPLAY.
The skill of architect, structural engineer and lighting engineer
have combined to produce this outstanding new which
provides a luxurious setting for the Holden cars that it displays.
The service section is at the rear, access being by wide drives
on both sides of the central showroom. An old two-storey
residence was demolished to make way for these premises.
J. Murray Steelworks Pty. Ltd. supplied the modern “streamline”
awning and Lehmann Bros, the floor tiles.

Home-Building
Rate Halved
Fall in Building Approvals.
According to a survey by the De-
partment of Secondary Industries and
Building Materials, home-building in
the Sydney area later this year will be
approximately half of that in the cor-
responding period of last year.
The survey covered most municipal-
ities in the Sydney area, and showed
that councils approved about 41.5 p.c.
fewer homes in the first quarter of
1952 than in the same period of 1951.
There was a decline of 9 p.c. in
the number of buildings commenced
in the first quarter.
In the first quarter of 1952 approv-
als of brick houses fell by 49 p.c. and
of timber houses by 38 p.c.
It is considered that the fall in
building approvals will mean a much
more sharp decline in the numbers of
buildings commenced by the end of
1952.
For the four months November to
February the nine Sydney municipal'
ities surveyed issued permits for 1837
homes as against 3076 in the same
period of 1950'51.
These nine municipalities have ap'
proved 70 to 80 p.c. of the home
building being done in the metro-
polis since the war, and they all record
a heavy falling off of applications to
build.
This is the result of the severe
credit restrictions imposed by the Fed-
eral Government, and its repercus-
sions are being felt right throughout
the building industry.
“Economic Basis” Needed.
In a section of a 22-page statement
on the economic position in the
House of Representatives recently,
Sir Arthur Fadden said that if the
Government met the demand for fi-
nance for home building without lime
it would not produce more homes but
force prices beyond the reach of or-
dinary people.
“The plain truth is that the build-
ing industry has to find a much more
economic basis,” he said.
“There are signs that this is be-
ginning to happen, with some build-
ing materials and labour becoming
easier to obtain in some areas.
“Houses are being completed at the
rate of 70,000 to 80,000 a year.
“At the end of December about
85,000 houses costing £290 million
were under construction. (£3412 on
an average, which is far too high for
an ordinary small house.)
“The Government realises the need
to maintain building activity.
“It insists on the industry reaching
a reasonable state of efficiency and an
economic level of costs.” he added.
Mr. Fadden did not say that as it
was the laws of the country, govern-
ing a 40-hour week that brought this
financial debacle about, that the
working week would be altered back
to 44 or even 48, to enable prices to
fall.
We show, at left, three little
homes that 17 years ago cost on an
average of £BOO each, which means
that three cottages could be built for
the cost of one at today’s price and
there would still be £lOOO to spare.
In those days we worked a 48-hour
week and things were reasonably
cheap and within everyone’s compass.
THREE COTTAGES AVERAGING 1800.
“To satisfy the most fastidious home owners”
fifteen years ago, these three cottages, which
appeared in the Co-operative Building Soci-
eties’ gazette (Nov. 18, 1937), could have
been built for an average of £800. Today’s
price would, in all probability, average
£3,000 each. Sketches by F. G. Goss.
APPLYING FORMICA FOR WALL
PANELLING.
A new method of applying laminated plastic
wall panelling has been used in the construc-
tion of a new B.B.C. staff canteen at Bush
House, London. The panelling has been
carried out in 1/16in. Formica veneer, grey
Linette for the flat surfaces and Bird’s-eye
Maple Wood Grain for curved surfaces. This
is the first time, it is stated that laminated
plastic veneers have been bonded direct to
cement-rendered walls with no cover fillets,
supporting ground or backing boards (afford-
ing considerable economy in application costs),
on such a large scale. The fabricators were
Permatops Ltd., London, S.W.15.

QUEENSLAND'S MEMORIAL TO AMERICA
“THEY PASSED THIS WAY.”
By F. O. NIXON.
Yes, two and a half million of the
flower of U.S.A. manhood and
womanhood. No less than 75,000 of
them based on Rockhampton, an an'
ticipated Japanese invasion-post near
Keppel Bay and the Central Queens-
land Capital of less than half that
population of their own, during the
war years—the 2nd World War, and,
let us hope and trust, the last.
- - - - -
* j ~ t .1 j r .1
And then at the end of the war,
begun by a clandestine attack on Pearl
Harbour and the U.S.A. Fleet riding
at anchor there, the heroes whose last
resting-place was in Queenseland soil
near Brisbane in no less than 1448
disinterred coffins with their sacred
contents also “passed this way” to the
ship that was to return them to their
native soil.
The dignified memorial of Helidon
Sandstone, surmounted with the
American eagle, was unveiled at New-
stead Park on Saturday, 3rd May,
1952, on the 10th Anniversary of the
Coral Sea Battle. It looks out over
an expanse of the Brisbane River, to
the Pacific.
From every visage, the placing of
this memorial on the bank of the Bris-
bane River at Newstead Park, where
the historical Newstead House, built
more than 100 years before the onset
of the war, was occupied by a section
of the North American Forces, is ap-
propriate. Adjoining the Park is the
wharfage where the first vessels of the
Army discharged their soldiers and
equipment. And from these same
wharves at the termination of the hos-
tilities the last remains of those who
had laid down their lives left Aus-

History has repeated itself, in so
far as an ever-grateful nation in the
Pacific has emulated the example of
France, when, in 1884, that nation
raised, in gratitude, the gigantic Statue
of Liberty on the Shores of the
Atlantic.
There the comparison ends, of
course; Queensland’s memorial column.
3f t in diameter, being 35ft. high from
t^e pavement to the Crown of the
sf t eagle. The spread of the base is
gft., and its paving 30ft. long by 20ft.
wide. Below the column, which is
0 f Queensland freestone from Low-
ther’s Helidon quarries, the base is
of axed granite. Two flagpoles, each
standing 25ft. beside the memorial,
were used for the first time on Satur'
day, 3rd May, 1952—the tenth an'
niversary, almost to a day, of the Coral
Sea naval battle—for the unfurling of
the respective flags of Australia and
the United States of America.
In the former case, the honour of
unfurling the Union Jack was in the
appropriate hands of Mrs. Rose E.
Manson, an Ipswich (Q.) lady who
had lovingly, since 1942, tended the
graves of the 1448 U.S.A. heroes in'
terred in the Ipswich Military Ceme'
tery. The stars and stripes was un'
furled by ex'Private First'Class T. D.
Marsh, formerly of Montana (U.S.A.).
The Memorial was designed by Mr.
F. G. Costello, chief architect of the
City of Brisbane, and his assistant,
Mr. R. J. Drysdale. The builders were
P. J. Lowther Son Pty. Ltd., includ'
ing the eagle by their craftsmen.
At the unveiling by the Governor,
Sir John Lavarack, the President of
the Australian ' American Association,
Professor (Dr.) John Bostock, had
with him Lieut.'General Robert L.
Eichelberger, D.S.C., D.S.M., and the
Hon. Pete Jarman (Ambassador Extra'
ordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States in Australia),
and many others, mostly members of
the Australian'American Association.
This is the inscription in metal on
the base of the Memorial:—
“THEY PASSED THIS WAY.
“This monument was erected by
the people of Queensland in
grateful memory of the contri'
bution made by the people of
the United States of America
to the defence of this country
during th 1939'45 war. Long
may it stand as a symbol of the
unity of English ' speaking
peoples in the cause of free-
dom.
The Australian'American Asso'
ciation initiated and implement'
ed the erection of this Memorial.
The funds were raised by
Public Appeal launched by the
Lord Mayor of Brisbane on 3rd
March, 1950. The first sod
was turned by the President of
the Association on 3rd May,
1951, in the presence of the
Premier of Queensland, the
Hon. E. M. Hanlon, and the
Ambassador Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary of the
United States of America.“

PROGRESS IN NEWCASTLE
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE.
At the unfurling of the flags, a
flight of Mustang fighter ’planes of
the R.A.A.F. approached in their
closest salute.
Could any four words in the Eng'
lish language have been made use of
more suitably to conjure up now, and
for all time, the poignant memories
of the day the Coral Sea Day
when a great world cataclysm was in
the balance and Providence decided
that the cooperation of two intense
freedomdoving democracies should be
sealed with a lifedong permanence,
stretching away into the timeless
future.
These simple words—“ They passed
this way” were suggested by Mrs.
F. S. Parkes, whose husband, a great'
grandson of Sir Henry Parkes, father
of the rhetorical reference to “The
silken bonds of Empire” that will ever
remain an inspiration to the Com'
monwealth he visualised, is the em
gineer of the Main Roads Commission
in whose keeping is the landscape en'
gineering of this Commission. So
great was the price paid in ours and
American blood that Australia should
ever remember that
“Greater love hath no man than
this,
That a man lay down his life for
his friend.”

PROJECTED NEW SYDNEY HOSPITAL
MODEL OF THE EXTENSIVE SCHEME.
THE GROUND FLOOR PLAN.
THE FIRST FLOOR PLAN.
24
May 24, 1952.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Proposed Tuberculosis Hospital, Killara, Sydney
FOR THE MISSIONARY SISTERS OF THE SOCIETY OF MARY.
f Ihe following extracts from the Report of the Architect, Mr. L. P. Burns, give an excellent
idea of the scope and details of this extensive project.—Ed.]
The site is one of ample acreage
on a high, flat plateau overlooking a
considerable expanse of wooded coun-
try, and although in a near suburb
of Sydney it is yet sufficiently detach-
ed as to have no overbearing in-
fluence on surrounding property; it
has easy access and commands exten-
sive view to the North, East and
South.
The main hospital front containing
the wards has been placed to face
North, with the service offices, lava-
tories, etc., on the South, an arrange-
ment which not only provides the best
outlook and sun to the wards but pro-
tects them from the prevailing winds
and rain.
The general building scheme re-
quired a hospital of 250-bed capacity,
a nurses’ home for 150 nurses and
domestics, a Convent for 30 Sisters,
a Chapel for use by all, but for par-
ticular use by the Nuns, accommoda-
tion for a Resident Chaplain and pos-
sibly a resident doctor. It was re-
quired that all these buildings, which
were separate in themselves, should
be so placed that their aspects were
the best possible consistent with their
various functions. In a general way
all livable parts of the hospital and
Convent are designed with a Nor-
thern aspect, delegating the South to
those offices which did not so require
the sun.
The Hospital.
The hospital has been designed as
a steel-framed building of six floors
and basement and can be roughly
divided by floors into sections as fol-
lows: The basement contains kitchen,
laundry and stores; ground floor: ad-
ministration offices and admissions;
first floor: some wards and occupa-
tional therapy: upper floors: wards;
while the roof is occupied by treat-
ment rooms and operating theatre.
It has a central Assembly Hall for
lifts and offices and the wards are
placed on each side of this central
section.
Typical Floor Layout.
The following is a description of
the accommodation and layout of a
typical ward floor:—From central lift
lobby, which contains visitors’ wait-
ing rooms, treatment, examination
and dressing-rooms, radioscopy and
phneumothorax rooms, the wards ex-
tend both ways. Each block, contain-
ing 27 patients, is treated as a unit
with its own offices consisting of
patients’ toilet, linen and blanket
room, drying room for blankets, steri-
lisation rooms, nurses’ workroom,
serving and dish - washing and
sterilization, flower room, incinerator.
The corridors are wide and spacious.
The wards are divided into series
containing single and double wards,
while an isolation block of two single
wards is at one end and a lounge
room for each floor is provided at the
other. Balconies extend along in
front of each ward which, with fold-
ing doors opened, becomes part of
each ward.
Particular attention will be devoted
to the wards, which are of one, two
and four bed capacity, and each ward
will contain built-in wardrobes, a
hand-basin, a dental basin, a sputum
destructor, bed and chair. It will be
equipped with electric call system and
lights r or ordinary use and reading.
A system of accordion doors will allow
the ward to be opened for its full
width to the balcony and when closed
still leave access between wards for
nursing service. Radiators will be in-
stalled at the outer wall area to pro-
vide required heat. Particular atten-
tion will be paid to the system of
wall, floor and ceiling colours to ob-
tain pleasing variety and pleasant sur-
roundings.
Operating Section.
The roof is devoted to all treat-
ment and operation theatre section.
It contains a large theatre with
sterilization rooms, plaster room,
scrub-up, etc., a central sterilization
and sterilised store, a records office,
nurses’ and doctors’ locker rooms,
toilets, etc. It will rely entirely on
artificial light and will be air con-
ditioned.
Treatments also provide for radi-
ography and fluoroscopy, general ex-
amination room, dark room, office
and viewing room and film filing
room. A Dental Suite and recovery
room is also located here.
The System
of Sterilisation.
All sterilising will be done as close
as possible to the source of infection.
Sputum wil be destroyed in the ward
by means of a gas destructor. All
linen will be sterilised in pressure
sterilisers in each block on each floor
before going to the laundry, and all
blankets will be washed and sterilised
on each floor. No contaminated linen
will go to the laundry. All food
utensils and trays will be sterilised on
each floor before going to the kit-
chen. All flowers and dust will be
destroyed on each floor by incinera-
tors. Nurses coming into and out of
the hospital will be required to pass
through a change and locker room
for gowns as a first and last step re-
spectively. As far as is possible the
system of sterilising will reduce the
spread of the disease to a minimum.
All used crockery and cutlery will
be sterilised in a pressure steriliser
situated in the washing-up room,
washed and stored for the next meal.
Boiler Room.
The Boiler House is a separate
building situated to the South-East of
the main hospital, which will mini-
mise nuisance from smoke. The
boilers will be operated on coal by
mechanical feeder with bunkers placed
overhead and fed by gravity to feeder.
The Nurses’ Home.
The Nurses’ Home will be a steel-
frame building of six floors situated
to the West of the hospital and con-
tains separate bedrooms for approxi-
mately 150 persons. Each bedroom
will contain built-in wardrobes and
dressing table, bed, chair, etc., and
will be 13ft. by Bft. in size. Each
bedroom will be connected to an in-
ternal communication system which
will allow the Sister in Charge to call
any nurse from the ground floor
office. Lavatory blocks are placed
conveniently to each set of rooms,
while a kitchenette, wash room for
personal clothes with dryer and iron-
ing facilities are provided on each
floor.
The ground floor is mainly en-
trance vestibule, lift hall and adminis-
trative offices. Two dining rooms
are provided with separate entrances,
one for nurses and one for domes-
tics, with foyers for each. A common
well-equipped kitchen with adequate
stores serves both dining rooms and
at the same time the Convent refec-
tory.
The auditorium is semi-public for
dances, picture shows and other en-
tertainments and is completely self-
contained with cloak rooms and lava-
tories. The auditorium has accommo-
dation for 300 people.
A minimum of a bedroom, lounge,
bathroom and kitchenette is provided
in a small separate building adjacent
to the covered way for a resident
doctor.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA
ANNUAL REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT.
Considerable Progress, Despite Difficulties.
“The results attained in all Depart-
fiect the greatest credit upon the initi-
skill and industry of all em-
ployees—administrative, clerical and
industrial alike,’ states the Minister of
Works, Mr. M. Mclntosh, in present-
ing his Annual Report to the Gov-
ernor of South Australia, Sir Charles
Norrie.
In spite of many difficulties, consid-
erable progress is evident in public
works projects, and is particularly im-
pressive in the delivery of water to
many points of the State.
Since March, 1944, when delivery
of River Murray water from Morgan
te Whyalla and the Woomera Rocket
Range, until June 30, 1951, 7,375,-
000,000 gallons of water was supplied
through this pipeline; approximately
double the combined capacity of all
reservoirs serving the northern areas.
To meet the requirements of the
growing population and rapid expan-
sion of industry, two major projects
are in hand, the Minister reports, viz.,
the construction of an additional res-
ervoir on the South Para River near
Williamstown and the construction of
a pipeline from Mannum to Adelaide.
The 10-million gallon reservoir to be
built at South Para will supplement
supplies to Barossa district and met-
ropolitan area.
To ensure a permanent water sup-
ply to Yorke Peninsula, the first sec-
tion of a Government - approved
scheme is in hand, but work has been
delayed by inability of the contractors
(despite Government assistance) to ob-
tain steel plate for manufacture of the
pipes.
The shortage of steel plate has also
affected other water schemes, but con-
struction of reinforced concrete tanks
and other work is proceeding,
Government Buildings.
Many new building projects were
in hand at Tune 30, 1951, the An-
nual Report continues.
A tender has been accepted for the
construction of a maternity section
at Woodville to function as a unit un-
til the full scheme of erecting a
public hospital to serve the western
district can be put in hand. The first
section of a Nurses’ Home to accom-
modate the nursing staff for the ma-
ternity section of this hospital is un-
der construction. A new Nurses'
block which will accommodate 314
nursing staff is being built at the Royal
Adelaide Hospital and a new boiler
house to serve the whole hospital is
under construction. This boiler house
will burn Leigh Creek coal. A new
Nurses’ block is being constructed at
the Parkside Mental Hospital and a
tender has been accepted for the erec'
tion of a new female admission and
treatment block. Plans are being
prepared for a new men’s ward, oper'
ating theatre, X'ray block, and addi'
tions to Nurses’ quarters at the Port
Pirie Hospital. The rapid increase in
the number of patients at the Mount
Gambier Hospital has necessitated the
reconsideration of the original scheme
for a new hospital and sketch plans
for a new building to accommodate
210 patients have been prepared and
submitted to the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on Public Works.
Major building projects in hand in'
elude a new hospital block and ad'
ditions at Port Lincoln; new tech-
nical school at Norwood; new high
schools at Brighton'Glenelg; Minlaton
and Naracoorte; new infant school
at Renmark; new area school at Ah
lendale East; a new wing at the Oak'
bank area school; new primary
schools at Whyalla West, Salisbury
North, and Mount Gambier; and new
schools at various places in the coun'
try and metropolitan area to cope
with the great increase in the number
of pupils. A number of new resh
dences has either been built or pur'
chased for the Education and Police
Departments and land in several lo'
calities has been purchased for use as
additional playing areas or as sites for
new schools in both metropolitan and
country districts.
Although the Architect'in'Chief and
his staff have continued to maintain
Government buildings and carry out
a large number of works for the var'
ious Government Departments, his
activities have been greatly hampered
by shortages of material and by in'
ability to obtain tenders for various
works. In spite of personal contact
and widespread advertising, it is be'
coming increasingly difficult to secure
tenders for country work. In many
cases, tenders have been advertised
several times before even one tender
is received. Because of these difficul-
ties, the full building programme ap'
proved by Parliament could not be
carried out.
Concluding his report, the Minister
points out that the Supply and Tend'
er Board handled a turnover of pur'
chases amounting to £7,615,083 dur-
ing the year, but relative shortages of
essential materials retarded efforts of
all Departments to keep pace withi
ever'growing demands.
Delivery of N.S.W. coal was 281,912
tons short of the State’s requirements,*
but fortunately development of the
Leigh Creek Coalfield has enabled in-
dustries and Governmental services to
be maintained without interruption,
the report adds.

Water Supply Branch.
In presenting his annual report, the
Engineer'in'Chief discloses that the
total invested capital for S.A. water'
works undertakings as at June 30.
1951, was £22,602,531. Gross revenue
for the year was £1,098,360, of which
£1,068,102 was absorbed in mainten-
ance and working expenses.
Overall working expenses again
showed a sharp increase, due mainly
to higher wages, increased cost of ma-
terials and additional pumping neces'
sary to meet water shortages.
The Department is now carrying
out the greatest construction pro-
gramme in its history, the report states.
Major works in hand are the Man'
num'Adelaide pipeline, a 10'million
gall, reservoir on South Para River,
the Uley'Wanilla (Eyre Peninsula)
water supply scheme, Chaffey and
Loxton irrigation schemes, Beri'Bar'
mera'Cobdogla drainage scheme, ex'
tensive land drainage works in the
Southeast, the construction of num-
erous water storage tanks, enlarge'
ment of the Upper Paskeville Reser'
voir and many other projects of lesser
magnitude.
Value of plant used on construction
work is over £1,250,000 and the
branch now has one of the most mod'
ern and complete fleets of mechanical
equipment in Australia.
The materials position has deterior'
ated further, the report points out,
owing to the enormous increase of
developmental works throughout Aus'
tralia and stockpiling of strategic ma'
terials by all nations.
Unfortunately the flow of migrant
labour for the heavy unskilled work
on construction projects has dwindled
greatly, while Australian born la'
bourers are practically unprocurable.
It would appear that the rapid in'
dustrialisation of the country has
made so much more congenial work
available that construction projects are
likely to continue suffering from a
shortage of labourers, which will ser'
iously retard progress.
As at June 30, 1951, the staff com'
prised 555 permanent and temporary
male officers, 85 female officers, and
2733 daily paid employees, including
671 New Australians.
Building Construction and
Maintenance.
According to the annual report on
the work of the Architect'in'Chief’s
Department, total capital expenditure
to June 30, 1951, was £9,529,804.
The Department has had a substan-
tial burden placed upon it by the
vast programme of expansion conse'
quent upon the:
(a) development ofthe State (in'
dustrial and migration);
(b) lag of construction prior to and
during the war period;
(c) compulsory lack of mainten'
ance over the above period;
(d) policy of improving standard
of amenities in Government
institutions, buildings and res'
idences;
(e) shortage of labour and mater'
ials.
Realizing that the organisation and
staff had not been sufficient reviewed
and expanded to meet requirements.
a special Committee was appointed to
report on the Denartment.
As a result, a major reorganisation
is in progress.
An impressive amount of Govern'
mental building was in progress as at
June 30, 1951, including the Nurses’
Home at Parkside Mental Hospital,

COLOURFUL SOUTH AFRICA
Makes Remarkable Progress
Of the four provinces of the
Union of South Africa only one, the
Cape, has a history which goes back
for three centuries. Natal, the Free
State, and the Transvaal are creations
of yesterday and have a history be-
hind them of barely a century, said
Mr. Mikulicil Rodd, in a speech he
recently delivered before the Inter-
national Club, Sydney.
Continuing, Mr. Rodd said that
the Union of the four provinces
was finally achieved, after long years
of strife, in 1910. Since then South
African industry has developed
mightily, the Boer, or Afrikaner
people have become a nation with
their own flexible and growing lan-
guage, which together with English
is the official language of the country.
(There are about 2f million white
men in the Union and a black popula-
tion of about 8i million.)
Beautiful, Modern Cities.
The Union is proud of its beautiful
cities like Cape Town and Durban
on the coast, the one upon the At'
lantic, the other upon the Indian
Ocean, and the great modern cities
like Johannesburg (see illustration),
as well as characteristically South AT
rican cities, such as Pretoria and
Bloemfontein,
Cape Town.
The splendid city of Cape Town,
lying within the shadow of Table
Mountain, has a population of over
500,000 people, is a world port, the
Parliamentary Capital of the Union
of South Africa, and is world'famous
as a tourist and health resort.
The Mother City is a fascinating
blend of old and new (see illustra'
tion). Narrow thoroughfares recall
the early Dutch days, as do the names
of many streets and quaint lanes,
while in the older parts of the city
there still remain many Dutch and
Georgian buildings, often standing
cheek by jowl with shops and offices
built in modern style.
Tall department stores, commercial
buildings and palatial banks in the
principal streets are forerunners of
great blocks of new buildings which,
within a few years, will grace the huge
new city area recently reclaimed from
the waters of Table Bay.
Cape Town is one of the oldest
Dominion cities, and it retains many
tangible links with the country’s his'
toric past.
More gracious legacies of the past
are the beautiful farm homesteads,
built in the Dutch Colonial style of
architecture, which dot the Cape Pen'
insula and its hinterland.
One such is the historic manor
house of Groot Constantra, 17th cem
tury home of Governor Simon van
der Stel (see illustration). This white-
walled, thatched house is the perfect
example of the “Cape Dutch” home-
stead of a bygone age.
Johannesburg.
In 1886 intrepid explorers, explor-
ing the bleak expanse of country they
called the Witwatersrand —the Ridge-
of-White Waters, discovered the great-
est goldfield ever known.
Today just over 50 years later,
there stands on this goldfield Johannes-
burg, South Africa’s largest, most
modern city.
Bustling, hustling, Johannesburg’s
pulse is the pounding of the ore-crush-
ers. Six thousand feet below Jo-
hannesburg’s streets (see photo) you
THE ART GALLERY, CAPE TOWN.
Among the many magnificent buildings in Cape Town, the Art Gallery at the foot of Table
Mountain has a quiet dignity, which is enhanced by the beautiful ornamentation of the setting.
WALE STREET, CAPE TOWN.
In this glimpse of Wale Street, with Table Mountain in the distance, can be seen a fascinating
blend of old and new. In the left centre is the old cathedral of St. Pauls, a fine example
of Classic and Gothic architecture. Just beyond is the huge Administration building for the
Cape of Good Hope.

are at sea level —and it is possible to
descend still deeper down the mine-
shafts.
Johannesburg is a wonder city, con-
stantly growing upwards, and expand-
ing outwards. Its streets seethe with
hurrying humanity, its tall white build-
ings are dedicated to Big Business. Its
huge department stores on Eloff Street
are equal to the world’s finest, and its
theatres and restaurants can best be de-
scribed as fabulous.
In sixty-odd years the city has
grown from a group of tents and
shacks to a mighty metropolis, built
by descendants of the first settlers who
lacked neither courage nor vision nor
faith in the future.
Pretoria.
“Flower of the Transvaal” is the
name coined to describe the garden
city of Pretoria. This aptly describes
this beautiful capital with its wealth

GROOT CONSTANTIA, CAPE TOWN.
In the wine-growing district of Constantia Valley is this historic manor house of Groot Con-
stantia, 17th century home of Governor Simon van der Stel, this white-walled, thatched house
is the perfect example of the “Cape Dutch” homestead of a bygone age.

and the forethought of men who selected it. Designed by the late Sir Herbert Baker. R.A.. and completed in 1913 at a cost of ap-
proximately £1,250,000, this masterpiece in stone stretches like the “Alhambra” along the shelf of the Meintjes Kop, in a sylvan setting of
great beauty. Outstanding characteristics of the building are the low roof with heavy projecting eaves which run round and along the entire
length of the building, broken only by the great columnar pavilions, and its twin dome-capped towers, each 180 ft. high, and separated by a
tremendous semi-circular collonade.

DEPARTMENT STORES MOVE TO THE SUBURBS
NEW TREND IN AMERICAN SHOPPING HABITS.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER.
You cannot make statistics with per'
sonal experiences.
However, one experience I had dur-
ing the last fifteen years seems highly
characteristic for the modern trend of
department store building in the
suburbs. The ladies of our West'
Chester neighbourhood fifteen and
twelve years ago used to do their shop'
ping at Macy’s or Gimbels’ or Altman’s
in New York City, and they liked it
because they were able to park their
cars right in front of those downtown
department stores.
You cannot park in New York City
any more. As Will Rogers used to
say: “When you have managed to get
a parking space in New York, for
heaven’s sake leave it there and buy
another car for driving.’’ This, of
course, is only one of the reasons why
suburb people prefer to stay in the
suburbs for their shopping. There
you’ll always find a space for parking,
though it might be a modest one.
Changes in the American
Way of Living.
Some other reasons for the trend to
move department stores to the suburbs
have been mentioned recently in an
extensive study by D. A. Saunders.
The population increase between 1940
and 1950 was the largest in U.S. his'
tory. The suburbs, growing much
faster than the central cities or the
countryside, accounted for practically
half the total increase. Motor vehicle
registrations in U.S.A. to-day are
about 50 millions, while in 1940 they
were only 32 millions.
Another point is that American mass
rapid transit has greatly increased in
cost. To go from our suburb, 25
miles outside New York City, to the
downtown department stores costs hus-
band and wife together something like
4 dollars or £l/15/7 for train and
subway for the round trip.
The same reasons are valid for all
the large American cities, and that is
why the same trend, to move depart-
ment store branches to the suburbs,
appears in all parts of the country,
from Los Angeles to New York, and
from Chicago to Boston. Most of the .
new branch-stores have large parking
lots immediately adjacent to the store.
Some suburban department stores, it
is true, are in crowded retail districts
where no large-scale parking is pos-
sible. But it seems those stores do not
like their present parking arrange-
ments.
At Altman’s branch store in White
Plains, N.Y., particular attention has
been given to the parking problem.
Attendants are stationed at the upper
main'levehentrance to help the cus'
tomers with packages, or to drive them
to their car in small station waggons
when the customer has finished shop'
ping.
“The dynamic growth in retailing
is in the suburbs,’’ says B. Earl
Puckett, board chairman of Allied
Stores, the largest U.S. department
store chain. Most experts agree that
no suburban branch department store
ever built has proved too large, ah
though many complain that they have
built on too small a plot.
Department-store Branches
in Suburban Shopping Centres.
For the suburban branch depart'
ment store, the great advantage of the
regional shopping centre is its com
trolled environment. As Mr. Saunders
points out, a large group of stores,
selected for both their competitive and
supplementary aspects, exercises a
combined drawing power far exceed'
ing the sum of their individual ap'
peals. The customer, of course, likes
the idea of “one stop” shopping in
which practically any combination of
merchandise wants can be satisfied by
a single trip.
A shopping centre requires, accord'
ing the Saunders’ figuring, within less
than thirty minutes’ driving time, a
potential market of at least half-a-
million population, most of it above
the national income average.
The alternative to a shopping centre
is this: If a store does not create an
environment, then the environment
creates itself. A large department'
store branch has a tremendous pulling
power and that attracts other stores.
It is no pleasant experience for an
individual department'Store branch to
have other merchants cash'in on its
pulling power, but it happens every
day.
Effects on the Downtown Store.
The expansion of the economy for
over a decade has dulled the impact
of the suburban branch on the down'
town store. As Mr. Saunders points
out, even in Los Angeles the down'
town stores have registered an in'
crease in dollar volume, despite the
explosive growth in that area’s
suburbs. But theirs is a threefold
threat of the suburban branch: it may
undercut the volume of the downtown
store; it may change its character; and
it tends to divert the attention of
main'Store executives from downtown
problems.
As a counter'Strategy, many mep
chants are becoming increasingly in'
terested in revitalising the downtown
by superhighways into the heart of
the city. The department stores,
says Mr. Saunders, did not create the
downtown muddle in America’s large
cities —they cannot solve it either. In
the meantime they had best roll with
the bunch and head for the suburbs.

Wunderlich’s Queensland Expansion
EXTENSIVE NEW PLANT OPENED.
By F. O. NIXON.
An eminent Australian economist
has expressed, very forcibly, his view
that the main road to economic re'
recovery in the Commonwealth lies in
the development of our primary in'
dustries and the scrapping of many
of the secondary industries that have
grown up under abnormal conditions
created by the war. Since the world
is underfed, and Providence has given
to the part of the world in which we
live a more bountiful share of sun'
shine and water, the forces that are
essential for the production of food
from the soil, many will agree that we
should concentrate on food produc'
tion and obtain our secondary re'
quirements from Great Britain and
other countries who buy our food.
No person old enough should have
forgotten what happened to Australia
as the result of its large importation
of manufactured goods from Germany
prior to the first war, and the floods
of manufactured goods from Tapan
prior to the Second World War.
With a third world war in the offing
—or rather, in the stratosphere—it
will be reasoned that a policy aimed
at making Australia independent of
producers of ESSENTIAL secondary
goods could justify the higher prices
it may be necessary to pay for them,
and for the greater measure of secu'
rity our secondary industries establish.
In another category are the secon'
dary industries that fabricate products
of our own earth into wares manufac'
tured by secondary industries.
One of such industries, carried on
in Brisbane for quite a number of
years, is the manufacture of “Mar'
seilles” terracotta roofing tiles by
Wunderlich Ltd. Their yearly out'
put of 1,500,000 tiles has now been
augmented by another factory capable
of turning out 3,500,000 tiles, and
since the yearly demand in Brisbane,
under present building conditions, is
15,000,000 tiles, the two factories of
Wunderlich Ltd., at Ferney Grove
and Northgate respectively (the last'
mentioned being the subject of this
article), will be able to supply one'
third of the demands of this State.
In Northgate, mile from the main
Northern railway, the Company has
built on its 53'acre block a factory
claimed to be the most modern of its
kind in any part of the world. It is
built to last, because the body of
clay in this area is so extensive as to
be able to produce tiles at the rate
quoted for at least three generations
to come. It is estimated that 15,000
tons of clay will be used each year.
Not only is it of a superfine quality,
but it, conveniently, burns to a good
red without the introduction of
colouring. Still greater production is
being planned, when a Danish
machine with all the latest automatic
equipment now in harbour —- is in
position.
Speaking at the official opening of
the works on 22nd April, at which
there was a large assemblage, includ'
ing an influential gathering of archh
tects and Master Builders, the local
managing Secretary of Wunderlich’s
Ltd., Mr. G. S. Warner said:
“The raw clay is dumped into the
‘apren’ feed and carried by conveyor
to the first set of crushing rollers.
“In a pug mill the clay is ground
and mixed with water. Passing
through closely-spaced rollers, it final'
ly emerges from a mixer in the form
of a ‘bat’. The long, thick slab of
clay is then cut into the required
lengths and conveyed by a wide, end'
less belt to the presses.
“As it is carried up to the belt,
the bat is manually lifted off and
placed in the press. Pressure is ap'
plied, the die faces imprinting the
familiar face design on the bat.
Another operator places the imprint'
ed tile on a second belt, and in pass'
ing along it is manually trimmed by
several workmen. Supported by
wooden tile frames, the still far from
complete product is packed on a ‘stih

lage,’ a rack device holding 150 tiles.
A lively, motorised fork'lift lifts the
entire stillage, shifting it smartly into
the large drying chambers, which are
heated from air drawn from the kilns.
“After the necessary drying period,
the tiles are transported to the kilns,
which are of brick construction,
having coal fires on either side. The
new tilery’s coal consumption will
amount to 3500 tons per annum.
There are eight kilns in all, each
having a capacity of twenty thousand
tiles.
“Heat from the flues beneath the
floors of the kilns bake the tiles at
a temperature of up to 1800 degrees
F. the heat being drawn up by chim'
ney stacks eighty feet high.
“Nearing the final stage of produc'
tion, the tiles are burnt in the kiln
for a total of four days; two days
at slow fire, the remaining time at
full temperature. Tiles take six days
in cooling.
“A mobile conveyor is run into the
kiln, the tiles are run out and stacked
on pallets. Finally, a fork lift tran'
sports them to the yard, to await de'
livery.
“Thus ends the tile'making process.
And hat was once a common slab of
clay is now transformed by the in'
genuity of man into a finished pro'
duct, a thing of beauty, which will
not only weatherproof, but also
decorate our homes.”
The Premier of Queensland (Hon.
V. C. Gair), who was present to
officially open the factory, spoke in
complimentary terms of “this further
milestone in the industrial growth and
development of Queensland.” He
congratulated the company “on the
excellent factory, which it is my
pleasure to officially open, and to
wish them further success.”
Continuing, the Premier said: “We
are to be asked to slow down on
works that are of a high national
value from a developmental angle,
and indeed very great defence value,
too. If that occurs it will be a great
pity for Queensland and for Australia
generally.”
Also in the large gathering, which
was lavishly entertained by a buffet
luncheon, were Mr. Croudace
(Managing Director of Wunderlich
Ltd.), Mr. Charles Wunderlich, Mr.
S. Sangster, fellow directors who 'had
come from Sydney for the occasion;
the Queensland Works Manager, Mr.
G. E. Gole, who with Mr. Scotford,

hands was the planning and construe'
tion of the Works, all of whom the
Chairman of the function, Mr. G. S.

Forceful Letter from Saying It With Light
“Retired Magistrate”
sth May, 1952.
Dear Mrs. Taylor,
Congratulations on your address to
Parramatta Rotarians. Such a fine ad'
dress, containing so much wisdom and
truth, should be repeated to other
patriotic bodies and business organisa'
tions. It is very sad to see our won'
derful country being ruined by Com'
munists and neer 'do ' wells when it
could be the most prosperous country
in the world, offering the finest work'
ing conditions and wages. Sadder still
is the looting and thieving of millions
of pounds annually from the Govern'
ment Departments, ships, bonds,
wharves, stores and homes, assaults and
robberies —often disfiguring or maim.'
ing for life beautiful girls and elderly
people; unspeakable evil; illegal strikes;
absenteeism; sleeping on the jobs, etc.,
etc. Worse still, we h*r from ap-
parently sane people that “Menzies has
failed to restore value in the pound,”
when, encouraged in all these crimes
by Labor Parties giving the men a 40'
hour week (so they can run two jobs
or a small business and earn £5 to
£2O on weekend jobs, tax free (i.e.,
evaded), and thus be too tired to
work honestly (if at all) on the Mon'
day at their regular employment.
All this crime has taken almost all
value out of the pound, and the
workers —poor fools—at the behest of
“fat union bosses” are stupidly killing
the goose that lays for them the golden
eggs of high wages, amenities, etc.
Australia could, even now, return to
great prosperity if workers would
abandon the foregoing strangulation
tactics, for they would automatically
put into trade and commerce and in'
dustry untold and fabulous sums of
money. By working honestly for 40
hours —not an average of 30 hours—
production would amaze us and restore
prosperity to everyone.
We can only pray for such poor
misguided workers, and for clean,
honest and statesmanlike government
in lieu of Labor Parties grovelling on
their stomachs to our workers. Mean'
time, despite every disability, with
droughts and floods thrown in, the
Menzies Government has done a won'
derful job to date. To properly realise
this we have only to try and visualise
the mess we should have been in had
Labor been in power in the Federal
sphere since last election. e
One has to hand it to U.S. archi'
tects who come up every day with
something new in architecture.
To them, progress means the con'
stant exploring of new ways, means,
and methods of making purely func'
tional buildings attractive and eye'
catching.
Take, for instance, the section of
the building in our photo.
At first glance, it could be a de'
partment store, a block of flats, a
theatre, or one of many other build'
ings.
Actually, it is a new Magazine Dis-
tributing Warehouse in Oklahoma
city, and the end walls illustrated here
combine utility with novelty.
The six sawtooth west'wall panels
are so set as to act as vanes for the
prevailing winds, and to exclude
western sunlight, while glass areas ad'
mit glareless northern daylight.
With all windows open, a cool
breeze sweeps right through the two'
stories of the building in the heat of
summer.
At night, illuminated from within,
the building catches the interest and
attention of the passer'by.
Clever architecture and clever ad'
vertising are thus combined to make
a prosperous business even more vah
uable and prosperous.
The U.S. Government is building
three escape-proof prison camps to
hold 3000 spies, saboteurs or other
subversive agents.

Lighting Research at the Commonwealth Experimental

INTRODUCTION.
Although the design of artificial
lighting installation has been ap-
proached in a scientific manner for
half a century or so, it is only com-
paratively recently that any attempt
has been made to place design for
daylight on a similar footing. That
there is a need to do so has been
emphasised by a recent investigation
in Texas, U.S.A. 1 , which showed that
a high proportion of children enter-
ing school with normal physiques de-
veloped various defects, especially of
vision, after a few years spent in
poorly-designed classrooms. To quote
this report:—
“It is interesting to note that in
the first grade only 18 per cent, of
the children studied had these defects.
This percentage increased to 40 per
cent, in the third grade, and by the
end of the elementary school period
the number of children leaving the
elementary school having eye defects
was 82 per cent.”
When some classrooms were re-
built to provide improved lighting,
physical difficulties largely disappear-
ed. This is just one example of the
need for further knowledge of the
subject.
General Considerations.
Successful lighting requires an ade-
quate “quantity” of illumination, pro-
vided by means which also give satis-
factory “quality.” The Station con-
sidered that the quantitative aspect
deserved highest priority, and its pro-
gramme was therefore planned with
two principal aims:
(a) To assess the adequacy of the
illumination in existing build-
ings and, where found unsatis-
factory, to develop and test im-
proved designs. This required
firstly the establishment of
standards by which the ade-
quacy of daylight may be
judged and. secondly, the de-

velopment of methods of
measurement by which build'
ings may be assessed in terms
of these standards, and valid
comparisons made between one
building and another.
(b) To develop methods for cab
culating, at the design stage,
the total illumination which
will result at different times in
the completed building. Such
calculations must depend on
consideration of at least three
factors: the relative frequency
of different levels of sky
brightness, the size and placing
of the windows, and the re'
fleeting power of surfaces with'
in the room.
Of these factors, the furnishing of
adequate data on sky brightness de'
pends on the meteorologist; light re'
ceived directly from the sky through
the windows can be calculated by
established methods; about the third
factor, reflected from internal sur'
faces, comparatively little is known.
The Influence
of Reflection.
The present position is well illus'
trated by the following quotation:
“This chapter recommends standards
of daylighting for rooms in houses,
flats and schools. ... In the present
state of knowledge, the standards are
of necessity formulated in terms of
the direct daylight to be provided and
no account is taken of reflected light.
The amount of reflected daylight is
in any case not significant unless there
is a considerable amount of direct day'
light.”
In contrast with this, a statement
on artificial lighting 8 reads:
“The interior finish of a building,
that is, the colour of the ceiling,
ceiling beams, side walls, columns,
machines, etc., has a considerable im
fluence upon the resulting illumma'
tion. ... It is obvious that where
the reflection factors of the ceiling
and walls are high, a greater proper'
tion of the light which strikes these
surfaces will be reflected to the work'
ing area than where the interior is
finished in dark colours.”
Since it is difficult to reconcile these
two statements, it is proposed to
examine briefly what is known on the
subject of reflected light. The method
for including reflection in the calcula'
tions for artificial lighting dates back
to 1916, when Harrison and Ander'
son published the results of their ex'
periments in model rooms, and intro'
duced the “Lumen Method” of de'
sign. As an example, this method
has been applied to a typical room,
the results being given in Table I.
To produce the required average
illumination of 10 foot'candles, four
500 W. lamps are required when only
direct light is available, i.e., when the
walls and ceiling are nomreflecting.
If these surfaces are highly reflecting
(80% reflection factor), only 200 W.
lamps are needed. Intermediate reflec'
tion factors naturally give values be'
tween these extremes.
If design were based on direct light,
resulting in the provision of 500 W.
lamps, the actual illumination with
the highly reflective surfaces would
then be 32.2 foot'candles, more than
threefold that required. Neglect of
reflection can thus lead to wasteful
design.
It would be natural to suppose that
similar effects would occur in natural
lighting, and yet the previously
quoted statement suggests that they
do not. What do the results of ex'
periments show? Figures 1 to 3 give
data obtained by three separate in'
vestigations. To make the results
comparable, all values have been ex'
pressed in ft.'candles under a uni'
form sky of brightness 1,000 ft.'
lamberts. The curves show levels of
illumination from front to back, on a
section of the room.
Figure 1 is based on experiments
by Ives, Knowles and Thompson 4 in
1935, in a building 30ft. x 30ft. x
15ft. with windows 30ft. x 12ft. By
taking measurements first with black'
ened walls and ceilings, then after
whitening these surfaces in turn, they
were able to determine the respective
contributions of light received direct'
ly from the sky, and by reflection
from the walls, and from the ceiling.
At the rear of the room 13.5 foot'
candles are due to direct light, while
41.5 are due to reflection, making a
total of 55.
Figure 2 shows results obtained in
Sweden by Pleijey 5 . He used a
model of a room- 20ft. x 13ft. x 9ft.
with a window sft. x 4ft. By the
same technique of varying the reflec'
tion factors of the internal surfaces
he obtained the results shown. It
will be noted that the difference be'
tween direct and total illumination is
not significant near the window, but
that this difference rapidly increases
as the rear of the room is approached.
At the extreme point the direct illu'
mination is only 1 F.C. while the total
(direct plus reflected) is 8 F.C.
Our own experiments in a room
14ft. x 14ft. x Bft. with a window 6ft.
x 4ft. give similar results, as Figure 3
shows. If only direct light is con'
sidered, the minimum illumination
falls below 5 F.C., whereas when re'
flections are included values every'
where exceed 20 F.C.
Suppose that in this room an illu'
mination of 25 F.C. at a point 2 feet
from the rear and side walls is re'
quired. With white walls and ceilings
this is the value provided. If only
direct light is considered, the value
at the same point is 5.3 F.C. If the
window is increased to the full width
of the room, and its head raised to
the ceiling, the direct'illumination at
this point is still only 16.5 F.C. To
obtain the required 25 F.C., the win'
dow head must be raised 18ins., re'
quiring also this increase in ceiling
height of the room. The illumination
with white surfaces would then be
about 75 F.C., or three times the re'
quired value.
The above examples show that the
effects of reflection from light'colour'
ed surfaces are similar in artificial and
in natural lighting. If they are

neglected in the calculations, urn
economic design results, leading to
the use of 500 W. lamps when the
200 W. size is adequate in one case,
and over-large windows and unneces'
sarily high ceilings in the other.
Methods of Measurement.
The effect of reflected artificial light
is taken into account in the “Co'
efficient of Utilisation,” which is the
ratio between the actual illumination
and that which would be available if
the whole of the flux from the lamps
reached the working plane. It is con'
sidered a fixed property of the room,
determined by its size, the reflection
factors of its surfaces, and the type
of light fittings, and is thus indepen'
dent of the light emitted by the
lamps.
A somewhat similar concept is used
in natural lighting, which is known
as the “Daylight Factor.” This is the
ratio between the illumination at a
point in a building and the total
simultaneously available on a horizon'
tal plane from the whole sky. (When
only direct light is considered, and
the sky is assumed uniformly bright,
this ratio is known as the “Sky
Factor,” and can be accurately cal'
culated.)
Since the total illumination from
the sky can vary greatly from day to
day, and even from minute to minute,
the illumination in a building varies
similarly. Hence direct comparisons
between measured values in two
buildings, or between two points in
one building, have no real meaning.
But if the measurements are express'
ed as daylight factors, such compari'
sons appear possible.
However, difficulties still arise, be'
cause the sky is not uniformly bright.
Even with a sky which appears uni'
formly overcast, the brightness of the
horizon will usually be only about
half the average value. On a clear
day the minimum may be about one'
third of the average, while areas ap'
proaching the position of the sum
will be several times higher than the
average. The daylight factor will
therefore vary, according to which
part of the sky the window faces.
Since consistent readings are essential
for purposes of comparison, it was
considered that these might be more
nearly obtained by using as the index
of external sky brightness, not the
whole sky, but a zone opposite the
window.
As illumination near the windows
is usually adequate, more emphasis
should be placed on points towards
the rear of the room. Figure 4a shows
the plan of a room and several such
reference points in it. 4b is a hori'
zontal projection of the sky, showing
the patches visible from these points.
It was evident that a simple shape
which would include these was a half'
cone with semi'angle of 45 degrees,
as shown in 4c, and by broken line
in 4b. The ratio between the
numerical values of indoor illumina'
tion and the average brightness of
the sky within this halTcone we have
termed the “Window Factor.”
For the actual measurements, bar-
rier' layer photocells were used.
These were fitted with filters to make
their response to light of different
colours as close as possible to that of
the average eye. Readings from such
cells do not comply with the photo'
metric law that the illumination is
proportional to the cosine of the
angle of incidence of the light,
the error at angles over about
40 degrees being considerable. Since
light from windows is frequently in'
cident at very oblique angles it is im'
portant that this error be eliminated
as far as possible. Pleijel, in Sweden,
developed a cosine'corrector based on
the use of a diffusing disc, raised
slightly above the surface of the cell
mount, so that oblique light strikes
this raised edge; an outer screening
ring eliminates all light when the
angle of incidence reaches 90 degrees.
The National Standards Laboratory
fitted several of out cells with simi'
lar devices. Figure 5 ilustrates the
design, and shows the errors of the
plain and corrected cells, the maxi'
mum for the latter, when calibrated
to give a true reading from the whole
sky, is about ± 7>%.
Several such cells were connected
through a selector switch to a meter
calibrated in two ranges of (M5O and
0'750 ft.-candles, so that rapid read'
ings could be made at a number of
points. A separate instrument reading
to 7,500 ft.'candles was used to
measure total sky illumination.
Measurements in a Building.
Our first experiments were design'
ed to test how well computed sky
factors agreed with the results of
measurement. Under a sky of uni'
form brightness, and with blackened
surfaces so that only direct light is
included, the sky factor, daylight
factor, and window factor should all
have the same value. It was also
desired to test whether similar results
were obtained in a fulhsized building,
and in a model of it. For this pur'
pose, a small hut measuring 14ft.
square and Bft. high was erected with
a window 4ft. high x 6ft. wide facing
south to a substantially unobstructed
horizon. Since the loss of light due
to glass is somewhat uncertain, origi'
nal measurements were made through
unglazed openings.
For later tests, in which the effects

of reflection were to be assessed, a
second window was provided facing
into a small courtyard, which was also
reproduced in the model, shown in
Figure 6, thereby ensuring that all
conditions were similar for both sets
of results. In both hut and model,
the walls and ceilings were fitted with
reversible panels, one side painted
matt black (R.F. 3%) and the other
matt white (R.F. 84%). Sliding win'
dows were provided so that later tests
could be conducted through glazing;
solid shutters completely closed the
window not in use.
A 45 degree halhcone, fitted with
baffles to intercept stray light and
painted matt black internally was con'
structed, and a photocell was placed
inside it. The axis of the cone was
set normal to the plane of the win'
dow.
On the roof, another photocell was
placed in a horizontal position, ex-
posed to the whole sky. A screening
ring to shield the cell from direct sun'
light was placed over it; the carriage
for the cell could be adjusted to suit
seasonal changes in the sun’s path.
This apparatus is illustrated in Figure
7. Suitable corrections were made to
the readings to allow for the area of
sky obscured by the ring.
The model was set up beside the
taken to the two measuring instru'
ments on the trolley.
The sequence of operations com'
menced by placing the cells in similar
positions in the room and in the
model. Readings were then taken of
the illumination from the whole sky,
within the cone, in the room, and in
the model. These were repeated, and
final readings of whole sky and cone
were taken a third time. The ave'
rages of these readings were then
computed to complete a set of results
for one point.
The observations were repeated on
eight days, three with clear skies,
three with overcast skies, and two
with scattered cloud. There were
considerable fluctuations in the sky
brightness while each test was in pro'
gress, and within the period of ap'
proximately one minute between two
readings at a point quite big changes
sometimes occurred. These changes
seem to account for the apparent
difference betwen results obtained in
the room and in the model, and to
some extent for the variations from
day to day.
Analysis of Results.
Figures 9 and 10 are scatter dia'
grams of the daylight factor and the
window factor in the room, plotted
against the computed sky factor.
Since proportional rather than abso'
lute values are interest, their loga-
rithms have been plotted. All points
should lie on the dot'dash lines if
the sky were uniformly bright. It
can be seen that there is actually a
considerable scatter above and below
them.
Separate statistical analysis were
made of all observations, and of those
no closer to the window than the
centre of the room; the latter are of
major interest. The results were as
follows:

epected to fall (±2.5 Sy).
Similar results were obtained in the
model, and these were also found to
follow quite closely (in view of the
large variations in individual read'

ings) those in the room, giving con'
fidence in the model technique.
The ultimate object of such
measurements was to find the dif'
ference in illumination caused by the
use of reflective rather than non'
reflective internal surfaces. This is
only possible when the measurements
taken under each condition are re'
liable and consistent. It is therefore
evident that in order to obtain reliable
results under the variable skies found
in Nature it would be necessary to
obtain averages of a number of tests.
However, the results of this limited
series of tests suggest both that
greater consistency (as indicated by
the spacing between the broken lines)
and that better agreement between
averaged measurements and computed
values (shown by the relationship be'
tween the heavy regression and the
dot'dash lines) is obtained by using
as the reference of sky'brightness, not
the whole sky, but a limited zone
visible through the window. The in'
tended similar tests with reflective sur'
faces were unfortunately not carried
out.
In view of these difficulties, the ob'
vious course is to perform the experi'
ments under controlled laboratory con'
ditions. For this reason, it is con'
sidered that, when possible, such work
should be conducted with models
placed under an artificial sky. Figure
11 shows the relationship between
computed values and those obtained
in the model under the artificial sky.
It can be seen that reliable results are
obtained by this method.
The Artificial Sky.
The Station’s artificial sky was de'
veloped from that used in Sweden,
and consists of a flattened dome 24ft.
in diameter and 7ft. Sin. high, lined
with hardboard and painted matt
white. A raised platform serves as
a working area below the centre of
the sky. Lighting is by means of 48'
40W. fluorescent tubes which have an
output of some 96,000 lumens. These
lamps are mounted on a suspended
ring, roughly halfway between the
centre and perimeter of the dome.
Sloping boards act as reflectors and
as baffles to prevent any direct light
from reaching the model. The
brightness of the sky is about 130
foot'lamberts, and is uniform to with'
in ± 2%. Figure 12 is a diagram'
matic section, and Figure 13 a gene'
ral view, of the sky.
Even with this sky, some fluctua'
tion in brightness occurs due to varia'
dons in the mains voltage. The effect
of these variations is eliminated by
using two cells in a balanced circuit,
as shown in Figure 14. One cell is
exposed to the whole sky, and the
other is used for measurement in the
model. Since the characteristics of the
galvanometer used require a reason'
ably high resistance in its circuit, it
was found necessary to make the re'
ference cell of larger size, giving some
10 times the output of the measuring
cell.
In use, both cells are exposed to
the whole sky with the slider D at
the right'hand end of the potentio'
meter Ri. The slider on Rs is ad'
justed until a balance is obtained, as
indicated by a zero reading on the
galvanometer G. Cell A is then
placed in the model, and slider D
moved to the left until the output of
the large cell B thus tapped off, again
gives a balance. The position of this
slider then gives a direct reading of
the daylight factor on a suitably cali'
brated scale. This circuit permits
consistent and rapid measurements to
be obtained, and was used to com'
pile the data for Figure 3.
Calculation of Illumination.
While the building to house the
artificial sky was being erected and
instruments purchased, some time was
spent analysing the results obtained
by Ives in America and Pleijel in
Sweden. From their experimental re'
suits we were able to obtain an em'
pirical method for calculating the
amount of reflected light for certain
restricted conditions. Later, these
methods were applied to our experi'
mental building, and values for the
total daylight factor at a number of
points were calculated. Since our ob'
servations were made with unglazed
windows, whereas glass was used in
the experiments on which the calcu'
lations were based, a comparison re'
quires the observed results to be re'
duced for loss of light in its passage
through glazing, by the usual deduc'
tion of 20%,
Table 2 shows a comparison be'
tween calculated and observed results
for one point at the rear of the
model.

The agreement is sufficiently good
to justify the belief that further ex'
penment would permit the extension
of this method for more general use,
and application in the drawing office.
However, before values so deter'
mined can be expressed as actual illu'
mination, further information on sky
brightness is required.
The Meteorological Branch has un'
dertaken a programme of continuous
recording of the brightness of a zone
of south sky within a cone of ap'
proximately 30 degrees semi'angle,
elevated at 45 degrees. These
measurements have been made in
Melbourne for more than a year, and
will later be made at each capital
city, and at Darwin to examine humid
tropical conditions, and at Charleville
for the dry inland. I am indebted to
this Branch for the data from which
Figure 15 was prepared. At present,
the only information available is for
a period in 1950, and the maximum
brightness recorded is 1000 footdam'
berts. In future work records of
higher values will be obtained. This
graph is therefore to be taken only
as a sample of the type of information
which will be available in the future.
This is intended for use in school
classrooms, which are usually occu'
pied within the period 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. The curves show the average
number of hours per day, within this
seven'hour period, during which the
sky brightness falls below any par'
ticular level up to 1000 foot'lamberts.
Suppose that a point at the rear
of a particular classroom is found to
have a daylight factor of 3%. When
the sky brightness is 1000 footdam'
berts, the illumination will therefore
be 30 foot'candles. From Figure 15
it can be seen that values will fall be'
low this level for some 3| hours per
day, on the average. However, they
wil only fall below 15 foot'candles
(corresponding to 500 footdamberts)
for an average of half an hour per
day. This might be regarded as satis'
factory.
Conclusions.
This completes the description of
the investigations which had been
carried out up to the time when work
on the project ceased. Their limited
scope can do no more than indicate
how future research might proceed.
It is suggested that the answers to
the problems outlined at the begin'
nmg of this paper might be found
along the following lines:
(a) Establishment of standards.
These could be based on the recog'
nised artificial illumination required
for different tasks. By reference to
data on sky'brightness as outlined
above, the daylight factor needed to
produce the required illumination
could be found.
(b) Measurement. Compliance
with these standards can most con'
veniently be tested by measurement
in models under an artificial sky.
When this is not possible, average
values of measurements on a number
of days in the actual building should
be used. Such measurements should

zone of sky facing the window.
(c) Calculation. As a result of
large numbers of such measurements,
possibly combined with mathematical
analysis, graphs or tables should be
prepared codifying the results, and
permitting pre-determination of the
total daylight factor at the design
stage.

that I express to you the appreciation
of members for the re-naming of your
Journal from “Building & Engineer-

gineering.”
I find it an easy task to conform
with this request by our members.
As I have already stated in my letter
to you of March 6th, we, the Execu-
tive of the Society, have greatly wel-
comed this move and are confident
that it will contribute materially to-
wards consolidating the feeling of co-
operation which exists between the
various professions representing the
Building Industry. In these days of
specialisation it is fine to note that
in the field of Architecture at least
even the specialist is but one of many
in a team united in their effort to
make this world a better place to live
in.
May I take the opportunity of ex-
pressing through you to Mr. Adrian
Ashton our thanks for the great
amount of personal assistance and co-
operation which he has given to the
Society in the many years of our
association.
Trusting that our Society will have
the privilege and benefit of being part
of “Building, Lighting, Engineering”
for many years to come,
I am, dear Mrs. Taylor,

The Station has selected the basic
climatic information required by a de'

th e Commonwealth Meteorological
Branch, Department of the Interior,
has. assembled this information in a
series of data sheets for 83 weather

BIRD RINGING IN LONDON.
Bird watchers in London have re'
corded that migratory birds make
journeys of 2,000 miles and more.
The tufted duck that winters on the
lake in St. James Park, London, spends
its summer and autumn on the lakes
and rivers of Sweden, Finland, Siberia
and Iceland. 3085 birds were ringed
for the tests.
Trafalgar Square is the nightly
roosting place for 100,000 starlings.
Londoners put up with these lousy,
dirty and destructive things in much
about the same way as we put up
with our pigeons cn public buildings.
It might be found more sensible to
wring their necks instead of their

Germany Attacks
Housing Problem
Since the war ended, more than one
million homes have been built in West
German towns, and five million more
are still required.
Houses are being erected in the
Federal Republic at the rate of about
310,000 annually, which means that
each year about a million people are
finding somewhere decent to live.
The Germans boast of this achieve-
ment. They claim they are building
homes faster today than ever before,
and faster than any other country.
This is the way they are doing it.

largely, but not entirely, from the
Federal Ministry of Housing at Boun.
The governing law (passed April,
1950) has divided building into three
principal categories.
Public Funds Assistance.
Under this first category, about 80
per cent, of contemporary buildings
is so regulated.
A Government loan covers from 40
per cent, to 50 per cent, of the total
cost, and the remainder is provided
by the individual builder with or with-
out assistance from a bank.
Under this arrangement, the total
floor space of houses and flats must
not exceed 700 sq, ft., with the month-
ly rent not more than a sq. ft.
(maximum £B2 a year).
Its design is one of several heartily
approved by the Housing Ministry.
It costs £A1250 to build, £A6O per
annum to rent.
Tax Relief Assistance.
Under this second category the
builder receives no public funds as-
sistance, but is subject to a scale of
taxation relief for his efforts.
The total floor space of homes built
under this arrangement must not ex-
ceed 1300 sq. ft., and the annual rent
must not exceed a maximum of £A2SO
a year.
Unlimited Loans Assistance.
Under this third category, if a build-
er does not want to borrow from pub-
lic funds, or to claim tax relief, he is
free to build on any scale he wishes
and to fix whatever rent he likes.
About 5 per cent, of the houses be-
ing built in West Germany today are
in this category.
The Federal Republic considers
building of supreme importance for
the fulfilment of its policy of asso-
ciating Germany with the Western
world.
“You can’t expect a man to defend
something he hasn’t got,” the Gov-
ernment claims.
It is therefore encouraging the
large-scale construction of homes for
its homeless, at rents they can well af-
ford.
The builders start at daybreak and
even work long after dark with the
aid of floodlights, seven days a week.
They’ll get that other five million
homes built in record time, and thus
achieve the complete rehabilitation of
the Republic.
Canada - Post-War
Housing for One Family
in Seven
Houses or Hangars? Is Latest
Problem.
Canada’s transition from post-war
peace to post-war preparedness has
had a greater impact on housing than
on any other type of building. The
choice is now between houses and
hangars, and government policy fa-
cours the hangars— not to mention
barrack blocks, airfields, and new de-
fence plants.
What is happening in Canada to-
day can well happen in Australia to-
morrow (and it may even be happen-
ing here now behind the scenes).
Housing Drops.
For the first time since the end of
the war, the volume of Canadian
house building showed an appreciable
drop in 1951. Compared with 1950,
contract awards declined 19 p.c.
Comments the “Financial Post”:
This doesn t mean that housing’s
lusty heart is suddenly to become stilh
ed. Residential construction is so vital
a production force in Canadian econ-
omy that its health is a matter of na-
tional concern. It can’t be allowed to
get sick. The truth of this statement
is evidenced by the vast record of
achievement chalked up by the in-
dustry.”
In the six years from January 1,
1946, to January 1, 1952, Canadian
builders erected nearly 500,000
houses, sufficient to accommodate two
million people. One Canadian family
in every seven now lives in a post-war
house.
Awards for residential building
formed a substantial portion of all
construction contracts in post-war
years. Fluctuations ranged from a
high of 41 p.c. in 1949 to a low of
19 p.c. in 1951.
Men and Man-Hours.
Construction of the average Can-
adian dwelling provides about 2300
man-hours of on-site and 3100 man-
hours of off-site employment, a total
of 5400 man-hours.
With a full working year of 2000
hours (250 eight-hour days), and the
average housing production per post-
war year is of 80,000 units, work is
provided annually for about 92,000
men in the building industry and 124,-
000 in the industries producing and
distributing building materials, a total
of 216,000 men.
(At the end of December, about
85,000 houses, costing ,£290 million,
were under construction in Australia.
Houses are being completed here at
the rate of 70,000 to 80,000 a year.
Housing construction for Australia
this year—7s,ooo units —is 30,000
units short of the target to cope with
the influx of migrants.
In 1950-51, N.S.W. completed
19,771 houses, with a building con-
struction work force of 35,451 (“Con-
struction,” Feb. 6, p. 5).
Figures for completed homes (in-
cluding individual flats) built in Aus-
tralia in each of the last three years
are:
1948- 52,684
1949- 56,979
1950- 69,128

THIS BUILDING WAS DEMOLISHED.
Things move fast in the United States and
buildings bow to progress—or change—just as
does everything else. To quote from a re-
cent article in the American journal “The
Architectural Record”: “Gone are the days
when importance lay in permanence in a
shifting society.” This five-sided building—
The Larkin Office Building in Buffalo, was
“torn down”, as the Americans say, as it
had outlived its practical use and “in turn,
it gives another generation the opportunity
for building anew for today’s needs.” It
was designed by the redoubtable Frank Lloyd
Wright.

The Convent.
The Convent is a two-storey brick
building approached through a cover'
ed way in the form of cloisters and
contains accommodation for thirty
Sisters. There are two reception
rooms, sewing room, recreation room
and refectory served from the nurses’
kitchen. All bedrooms face the North
and the whole building fronts on to
a private garden, which is protected
by cloisters from the general public
part of the hospital grounds. It is
within easy access by covered way to
the hospital or the nurses’ home.
The Chapel.
The Chapel is situated at the East
end of the Convent Block and forms
a link with the hospital. It has ac-
commodation for 140 people and 40
patients in a separate gallery com
nected directly to the hospital and
coinciding with the first floor level.
Sacristies are provided each side, one
for a working Sacristy adjacent to the
Convent, while the Priests’ Sacristy is
on the opposite side.
available, but on the above basis, Aus-
tralia’s housing achievement is more
than comparable with that of Can-
ada).
Action by Ottawa.
When Canada backed up the U.N
in Korea, it became obvious that a
full-scale defence construction pro-
gramme was vital, and the government
acted to restrict the number of hous-
ing starts, so as to avoid both a short-
age of building materials and check
the rise in prices.
Lending values were pegged at the
January 1, 1950, level and the addi-
tional 1/6 loan was suspended.
In other words, down payments un-
der the National Housing Act were
doubled, making it impossible for
many would-be home owners to fi-
nance the purchase of a house. The
number of new dwellings started drop-
ped accordingly. By September, 1951,
40 p.c. fewer foundations were being
put in than during the previous year.
When Ottawa authorities realised
that the house-building industry wag-
producing far less than capacity, new
measures were introduced by Resources
Minister Winters to encourage fresh
housing schemes.
The easier terms he announced were
designed to encourage fresh housing
schemes, and the easier terms apply
only to houses of limited sise. This
is to speed construction of dwellings
where most urgently needed for de-
fence development.
Builders engaged in this class of
work complain that maximum sales
prices are set too low to operate econ-
omically, pointing out that whereas
the prices of the houses are controlled,
their costs are uncontrolled—thus
forcing them to curtail operations.
Money Short.
The shortage of mortgage money
has also cut house production, and
current regulations authorise loans
within the terms of the National
Housing Act.
1. to certified defence workers to
assist in construction of houses to be
owned and occupied by them.
2. to builders to assist in construc-
tion of houses for sale to certified de-
fence workers, and
3. to builders to assist in construc-
tion of rental housing projects under
the rental insurance section of the
Act.
Loans to Builders.
The mortgage is 90 p.c. of the
agreed sale price of the house, which
may not be sold by the builder be-
fore completion. Sale is restricted to
a certified defence worker during the
first two months following completion.
After that time, the sale may be made
to a non-defence worker, but the
loan is reduced by one-ninth of the
original amount of the loan.
The Central Mortgage and Hous-
ing Corporation, with whom a num-
ber of builders are operating, may
enter into an agreement with a build'
er to buy back from him, at 95 p.c.
of the agreed sales price, any house
which he has been unable to sell with-
in a five-month period following com-
pletion. To obtain this buy-back pro-
vision. the builder has to pay CMHC
a premium equal to one-third of 1 p.c.
of the buy-back price. Payment must
be made by the date of the first pro-
gress advance on the mortgage.
Regulations also encourage erection
of housing for non-defence workers,
providing the homes are limited in
she and sell for an approved maxi-
mum price. Chief difference is that
the down payment is 20 p.c., not 10
p.c., as required by certified defence
workers.
BANK ADVANCES ARE
RECORD.
Trading bank advances, despite
credit restrictions, reached a new re-
cord of .£664 million in March—an
increase of nearly £9 million on the
previous month, and an increase of
£157 million over a year.
Figures issued recently show that
deposits at £1,241 million were £l3
millions more than in February, but
£44 million below those of March,
1951. Combined, this shows a “nest
egg’’ of almost £225 on an average
for every man, woman and child in
Australia.
RADIO STATIONS THAT
WORK UNATTENDED.
The only high power radio trans-
mitter in the world to work quite un-
attended has been installed by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
Several low power 8.8. C. transmitters
have been working on remote control
for some time but this is the first
occasion that this technique has been
applied to high power stations.
The electronic monitors take the
place of human supervisors. Two
have the task of watching the quality
and continuity of programmes while
a third checks the aerial transmission.
Any faults are automatically detected
and minor ones can be cleared by
switching the high tension supply off,
which is done three times by the ap-
propriate electronic monitor. • But if
the fault proves to be a major one
then the defective section of the trans-
mitter is closed down.
Virgil Tacket, recently buried at
Pikeville, Kentucky, was lowered into
his grave by power winch. The
reason? Tacket (26), weighed 43
stone.
A “Club for Intending Suicides’’
has been started in Vienna, where
there were 1487 attempts last year.
After being barred for 21 years
—parrots may again be taken into
Britain.
GLASS BENCHES.
Something new in park benches has recently
been designed in Paris in the form of con-
crete but lightened by the introduction of large
glass bricks. Though they look as if they
would be a little hard and cold they should
withstand the weather well, though one
wonders if used in Australia how long it
would be before someone with a sledge
hammer started knocking the glass panels out.

Demonstration At
Army College
Archetrim Used in New Buildings.
A practical demonstration of great
interest to the building and architec'
tural worlds was given at the First
Field Regiment College, Casula, Liv-
erpool, last Tuesday, by Barton Staggs
Pty. Ltd., manufacturers of Arche'
At Casula, nine blocks of modern
living quarters are being erected for
army personnel, and their general de'
sign and layout marks an innovation
in army life. , , , ,
Of two storeys each, the blocks
comprise living rooms, lounge rooms,
and ablution blocks on each floor,
and three personnel will be accommo'
dated in each spacious bedroom.
A further departure in the use of
Archetrim was demonstrated by the
ease, simplicity and speed of its ap'
plication, even when inexperienced
workmen used the product in trim'
ming doors.
To an interested audience, Mr. Bar'
ton Staggs explained that it usually
takes from H to 4 hours to trim a
door using standard architraves, and
that workmen who had only been us'
ing Archetrim since Friday last, were
now trimming doors in less than 15
minutes for each door.
After pointing out the many advant'
ages of Archetrim on jobs where speed
and finish are essential, those present
watched two carpenters trim doors in
a practical unrehearsed demonstra'
tion.
Although inexperienced in its use,
the times for trimming two doors
(one to a man) from start to finish
were 13 minutes and 12 minutes re'
spectively.
Among those who saw the demon'
stration, and who were later enter'
tained to afternoon tea in the officers
mess, were Mr. W. L. Knispel, Area
Technical Officer, Division of Nation'
al Development, Mr. J. O. Sampson,
Builder, Eastwood, Mr. J. Carr, of
Messrs. J. and A. V/. Carr, Builders,
Ryde, Mr. A. E. Drake, of Depart'
ment of Works and Housing, Mr. D.
Dalgeish, of Econo Steel Co. Pty.
Ltd., Mr, N. I. Anderson, Architect,
Mr. M. C. Maiden, and H, Castle,
as well as Army officers.
Also present were Messrs. Kelly and
Boyer, who are erecting the new dorm'
itory blocks, and the Clerk of Works.
An Army spokesman told “Con'
struction” that the new living quart'
ers would “undoubtedly give morale a
great boost.”
“It is quite a departure for this
type of structure to be built, and it
is believed that many more are plan'
ned for army camps throughout Aus'
tralia.
“Similar ones are under erection at
North Head and South Head, and
they will be the last word in com'
fort,” he added.
“Construction” was greatly impress'
ed with the standard of work being
put into the buildings inspected at
Casula, as well as with the layout.
For instance, a spacious lounge
room opens through fold'back doors
on co wide verandahs, and a large fire'
place will provide warmth and com'
fort in winter.
Bedrooms are large and airy and the
buildings, of excellent appearance, are
ideally situated for easy access and
quietness.
Later, the visitors were entertained
at the home of Mr. Norman Staggs,
Strathfield, and opportunity was taken
to inspect this fine house, which is
completely fitted throughout with
Archetrim pelmets, architraves, skirt'
ing, and the full range of Archetrim
furniture.
The typically Australian enterprise
of Barton Staggs Ltd. is giving env
ployment to many Australian work'
men, both directly and indirectly; it
is using native Australian woods in
large quantity, and it is adding in
many ways to our way of life, both in
homes and in furniture.

Know Your Hails
THE “PENNY” SYSTEM.
Until early in the 19th Century,
nails were forged by hand and had
no particular design—the shape being
left to the smithy’s judgment. The
first important step in nail manufac-
ture was when square cut nails made
by shearing from flat iron strip was
developed. It was not until about
1850 that wire nails, as we know
them, were produced commercially.
Since that time, numerous sizes and
patterns have been evolved and im-
proved.
The “penny” (d) system of desig-
nating nails, originating in England,
is commonly supposed to have come
about through one hundred 6d, Bd,
lOd, etc., nails costing 6 pence, 8
pence, or 10 pence. A more prob-
able explanation is that one thousand
6d nails weighed 6 lb.
Under present usage, the penny
size indicates a definite length.
HOUSE OF COMMONS’ STONE
FOR NIGERIA.
A piece of stone from the fabric of
the Palace of Westminster has been
presented by Her Majesty’s Govern'
ment to the Nigerian House of Rep'
resentatives.
The stone, which weighs about 120
lbs. and originally occupied a position
on the Victoria Tower at the south'
west corner of the Palace, takes the
form of a heraldic shield surmounted
by a crown, and is in an excellent
state of preservation.
The stone will shortly be sent to
Lagos, where it is to be placed over
the doorway of the chamber, facing
the entrance hall of the Central
House of Representatives. A suitably
inscribed plaque will describe the cjr'
cumstances of the gift.

Inquiry Into Apprenticeship In Australia
JOINT COMMONWEALTH-STATE COMMITTEE SITS IN SYDNEY.
Master Builders’ Association of N.S.W. Tenders Evidence.
The Joint Commonwealth ' State
[ Committee of Inquiry into Appren-
[ ticeship in Australia sat in Sydney
recently, and Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy,
r a member of the Executive of the
M. and the Industrial Officer of
the Association, Mr. W. Ford, ap-
peared before the Committee to ten'
der evidence on behalf of the building
j industry.
The following is an outline of sub'
■ missions proposed by the Master
Builders’ Association of New South
Wales, Mr. Ford said, in speaking of
the Apprenticeship position in
N.
1. The Building Industry is and ah
ways has been able to obtain sufficient
Apprentices to the trade of Carpentry
There has always been a shortage of
Bricklayers and Plasterers, mainly be'
cause these trades do not attract boys,
although it is partly the fault of the
system of contract work, and the
sub'contractors are not anxious to
take boys.
2. It is considered that the present
Apprenticeship System cannot provide
Australia s present and future require'
ments of skilled Tradesmen, assuming
that there will be an expanding De'
fence programme in the Building In'
dustry.
3. So far as this Industry is con'
cerned, the shortage is occasioned by
the limitation of scope. Smaller
Builders, who are the majority, sub'
let contracts for Bricklaying and Plas'
tering. Thes Subcontractors have
little interest in training men, but on
the other hafid, builders who are anx'
ious to train men, cannot get boys
to train. These two trades lack the
glamour of the Carpenter.
4. It should be emphasised that the
Association is not in a position to
speak for other Industries.
5. The New South Wales system
of Apprenticeship is considered high'
ly satisfactory and offers every possible
inducement to Apprentices. The As'
sociation would draw attention to the
success of the Trainee Apprenticeship
Scheme operating in this State.
6. The Association suggests that a
system of Pre'Apprenticeship Training
be reintroduced at Secondary Schools,
as was previously practiced in New-
South Wales. Additionally a scheme
of training similar to the Common'
wealth Reconstruction Training
Scheme for all Building Trades, is
suggested, or alternatively, a subsidis'
ed Adult Trainee Apprenticeship
Scheme. As far as the trades of
Bricklaying and Plastering are con'
cerned, consideration should be given
to the need for introducing a subsidis'
ed Post'School Scheme of Training.
7. The Association cannot suggest
any alternative system to that operat'
ing under the Industrial Arbitration
Act, 1940' 1951, in New South Wales,
which is considered efficient.
8. The Association submits that the
General Public should be educated to
appreciate the advantages of skilled
trades over “dead end” employment.
Attention should also be given to a
course of pre'employment training at
Secondary Schools to enable Australia’s
potential Tradesmen to appreciate the
advantages of the various skilled
trades.
Mr. Ford then introduced Mr. Ken'
nedy to the Committee, and brought
to the notice of members particulars
of the Training Scheme for the Build'
ing Industry which the M.B.A. of
N.S.W. had submitted to the Minister
for National Service in June, 1950.
Mr. Kennedy, addressing the Com-
mittee, said that the Scheme was nor
implemented, as the Minister was of
the opinion that the heavy industries
needed manpower rather than the
building industry.
M.B.A. Training Scheme.
The Training Scheme, as outlined
by Mr. Kennedy, was as follows:
1. The shortage of tradesmen in
the Building Trades throughout the
Commonwealth is affecting, adversely,
the home building and general con'
struction programme, and to over'
come this shortage the Master Build'
ers’ Association of N.S.W. submit the
following proposals.
2. Scheme to be Supplementary.
The Scheme provides for the train'
ing of ex'Servicemen and others as
Journeymen in each of the Building
Trades, and shall be supplementary to
existing facilities at present operating
for the training of Apprentices and
Trainees in these Trades, and shall
operate for a period of five; years from
the date of commencement.
3. How Administered.
It shall be the joint responsibilir-
of the Commonwealth Government
and the Master Builders’ Association
of N.S.W., and shall be administered
by a Committee of five members, one
to be nominated by each of the four
undermentioned organisations:

LONG GIRDER SPANS IN CHESAPEAKE BAY BRIDGE
This bridge over Chesapeak Bay is a major understaking its kind and requires transverse
truse and plate girder spans over dep water. A set of four 200ft. girders, with transverse
bracing complete, is here seen being floated into position on its piers. The girders are of
9ft. depth and the complete span weighs 250 tons. In the upper picture the span is balanced on
top of a 40ft. high falsework tower erected on a barge. In the lower picture it has been low-
ered into place by flooding compartments in the barge. On the left of each picture a second
span is being assembled ready for floating into position. There are seven similar spans in
the bridge.

might be established with the assist-
ance of the Vocational Guidance Of-
ficers of the Department of Technical
Education, or some vocational guid-
ance expert approved by the Commit-
tee.)
5. Ex-Servicemen.
Any ex-Serviceman, subject to the
provisions of the Re-Establishment
Employment Act, 1945, who did not
receive full time Training under the
C.R.T.S., shall be eligible for this
Scheme, notwithstanding what has
been set out in these proposals, and
shall receive an allowance for tools,
etc., as provided for under the C.R.
T.S.
6. Method of Training.
Subject to suitability being estab-
lished, the Trainee shall nominate the
employer to whom he wishes to be
attached, and who has indicated his
willingness to train such Trainee.
The Commonwealth Employment Ser-
vice, in co-operation with any trade
organisation, may assist in placing
Trainees.
The competency and suitability of
the Employer to give such training
shall be determined by the Committee.
The Trainee shall go direct to “on-
site” training, and concurrently with
this training, shall enrol in the appro-
priate Trades Course at a Technical
College. Where such Technical train-
ing is not available, the Trainee shall
engage in an approved course of study
by Correspondence.
The over-all period of training
shall be three years, but such may be
modified or extended if the Commit-
tee considers such to be desirable.
The Committee shall determine the
progress of the Trainee from time to
time, and shall subject him to any
tests which it may deem necessary to
establish his qualifications as a Jour-
neyman.
The Trainee shall attain a standard
comparable to that of an Apprentice
at the completion of his Apprentice-
ship.
Upon completion of his training,
the Trainee shall be given a Certificate
of Qualification.
7. Finance.
(a) Employers shall, in respect of
each approved Trainee, be sub-
sidised by the Government in
the amount of £3/0/0 per
week throughout the period
of training.
(b) Rate of pay on Commence-
ment in employment to be
£l/0/0 over the Basic Wage.
(c) e.g., Basic Wage, N.S.W..
June, 1950, £6/18/0 plus £1
—£7/18/0.
The difference between £7/
18/0 and the Award Wage of
£lO/4/0 to be divided into six
equal parts —employee to re-
ceive one part increase every
six months of his employment
until the Award wage is reach-
ed.
(d) All such increases to be paid
by Employer—the £3/0/0 per
week subsidy paid by the Gov-
ernment to continue until com-
pletion of training.
(e) Fees for Technical College
Courses or Correspondence
Courses shall be a charge upon
the Commonwealth.
8. General.
Conditions of employment for the
purposes of training shall be those
set out in the appropriate Award for
the Trade.
Any dispute between the employer
and the Trainee shall be reported to
the Committee for attention.
An employer and/or Trainee shall
have the right to terminate the con'
tract, subject to the approval of the
Committee.
In all matters involving the Indus-
trial Award the Apprenticeship Com-
missioner or similar Authority may
act.
The Committee shall have power to
co-opt any person, or delegate auth-
ority to any person, for the more ef-
ficient operation of the Scheme.
Shortage of Apprentices.
Mr. Kennedy told the Committee
that the M.B.A. originated the Train-
ing Scheme to offset the shortage of
tradesmen which was seriously affect-
ing the construction and home build-
ing programme.
He outlined present-day difficulties
faced by builders, and said the M.B.
A. felt that three months’ intensive
training of apprentices was better than
the usual training spread over 12
months.
In reply to a question by His
Honour, Mr. Justice Wright, Mr. Ken-
nedy said that the supply of carpent-
ers’ apprentices was at the present sat-
isfactory, but the plumbing industry
faced the worst shortage of appren-
tices.
Invited by His Honour to place
the trades in order of apprentice short-
ages, Mr. Kennedy said: (1) Carpent-
ers, (2) Painters, (3) Electrical
Trade, (4) Bricklayers, (5) Floor
and Wall Tilers, (6) Stone Masons
(very short), (7) Plasterers, (8) Fib-
rous Plasterers, (9) Plumbers.
Mr. Kennedy said that N.S.W.
started the Regional Apprenticeship

HIGHEST DAM IN EUROPE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
Tignes Dam, on the Isere River, in the French Alps, will be glacier-fed from the western
slopes of the Mont Blanc Range. A tunnel will divert the waters of two tributary streams
into the main reservoir. The site is at an elevation of nearly 6000 feet in a narrow valley
below a wide plain. The dam is of the arch type with a height of 592 feet above the river
bed and extends downward another 65 feet. The base width is 143 feet. Work can proceed
for only 150 days in the year. The completion date is in 1953. The capacity will be 191,000
acre-feet. Flood discharge is through two bottom sluices. A tunnel and penstock lead to
the first power house at Brevieres with a head varying from 755 down to 318 feet. A mine-
mile tunnel and a banded steel penstock lead to a second power house at Malgovcrt where
the available head is 2400 feet. The combined capacity of the two stations will be 428,000
kilowatts.

Training Scheme in 1944, when there
were 13,380 lads waiting to be train'
ed in all trades.
“There are only 6520 apprentices
in training today,” he added.
“Less than 50 per cent.”. His
Honour commented.
In reply to a question by a Com'
mittee Member. Mr. Kennedy quoted
figures to prove that fewer lads were
coming forward for apprenticship. He
said that 80 per cent, of the trainees
were “very satisfactory.”
His Honour: “It is better to get
an 80 per cent, result than have no
scheme."
Mr. Kennedy said the 1950 scheme
was originally formulated to carry on
where the C.R.T.S. left off, and was
interested to absorb servicemen as well
as civilians.
It was planned to encourage men
to enter the building industry as
tradesmen after suitable training, Mr.
Kennedy added.
His Honour asked Mr. Kennedy
how it was proposed to mitigate the
shortage of bricklayers.
Mr. Kennedy replied that the M.B.
A. had proposed to attract men into
the Adult Training Scheme, and en-
courage them to enter suitable trades.
Trainees would start at the actual
basic wage, and receive six'monthly
increases until they reach the Award
wage in four years.
His Honour asked whether the ne'
cessary tools were supplied by trainees.
“The cost would be substantial in
the case of carpenters and plumbers,”
he commented.
Mr. Kennedy said a carpenter’s kit
of tools would cost about £4O at to'
day’s prices, and a plumber’s tool
about £25.
Migration to Supplement
Tradesmen.
His Honour asked whether the
building trades could not be supple'
mented by suitable migrant trades'
men, and Mr. Kennedy replied that
the Minister for Immigration, Mr.
Holt, was making every effort to swell
the ranks of tradesmen with selected
migrants.
“At the present time committees are
overseas making such selections," Mr.
Kennedy said.
“A considerable number have ah
ready arrived, but we won’t get suffi'
cient men to fill our requirements,"
he added.
Man-Hours.
His Honour: “Is it a fact that
more man-hours go into structures to-
day than 10 years ago? That would
intensify the shortage, Mr. Kennedy?”
Mr. Kennedy: “Men today do not
have the same urgent need to work
as hard as at the old rate of erec-
tion.”
His Honour: “Has anything been
done to restore the old rate of
work?”
Mr. Kennedy: “Employers are
making every effort but it is difficult
to get some employees to do a fair
day’s work. Some do, some don’t.”
“Most employers find that the old
hands are working at the old rate,
but the younger men are slower, and
cannot work up to the speed of the
older men.”
Mr. Kennedy cited the time when a
man would hang 8 doors a day, “but
those days are gone,” he added.
Brick-laying.
Questioned by His Honour regard-
ing bricklaying figures, Mr. Kennedy
said that 350-400 bricks per day was
an average, but some classes of work
slows down the men. Thus it was
hard to draw comparisons, but he

CAISSONS FOR DEEP BRIDGE FOUNDATIONS.
The York River Bridge at Yorktown, Virginia, U.S.A., will include seven deck type trusses
ranging in span from 280 up to 500 feet. Two of these spans will swing open to give a
clear navigation width of 450 feet. The main constructional interest is in sinking six caissons

steel caissons which measure up to 66 by 52 feet in plan with a maximum height of lit
feet, and carrying six open dredging wells, being floated into a guide cage before lowering to
the river bottom. A fourth tower and connections will complete the guide cage. One of
these is seen in the upper picture being handled by a floating crane. The four legs of each
tower are steel pipes down which steel pipe columns are driven to anchor the tower in position

thought the general laying rate was
down about 30 per cent., owing to
difficult types of bricks.
However, the quality of bricks had
improved considerably lately, he add-
ed.
Replying to a question from a
Member, Mr. Ford said that parents
appeared to regard carpentering as
the glamour trade.
He felt too much emphasis w?
placed on woodwork at Technical
Schools, largely because woodwork
was so popular with youths.
Replying to a question Mr. Ken-
nedy said that under the supplement-
ary scheme not more than 15 people
were receiving training as carpenters
at the moment.
Mr. Kennedy was asked if some
purpose would be served by prevent-
ing small contractors from taking ap-
prentices.
He replied that nothing should be
done to prevent the small man from
training apprentices.
“In almost all cases they give very
satisfactory training to apprentices,”
he added.
Mr. Kennedy said he thought there
were still many good men available
for training.
His Honour said if the 1950 plan
operated all over Australia it would
have to function under varying con-
ditions.
It would be supplementary to the
present apprenticeship system and not
a substitute for it, he commented.
Mr. Kennedy said he was surprised
to learn that there were 50 per cent,
more indentured apprentices than
trainee apprentices.
He said he favoured technical train-
ing for apprentices, and favoured such
training being compulsory.
A Member said it would need a
State Statute to make it compulsory
the same as in southern States, where
compulsory training is “100 per cent
effective.”
A Member said the C.R.T.S. train-
ing was very effective and successful
and anything of a similar nature would
be very helpful.
His Honour asked whether peace-
time plan would be more effective
than a war-time training plan.
Mr Kennedy: Yes, Your Honour.
His Honour then thanked Mr.
Kennedy and Mr. Ford for their at-
tendance and assistance, and indicated
that he mav later ask them for further
information.
Until Winston Churchill introduc-
ed a Bill into Parliament in 1912
there were no compulsory early clos-
ing days in England. Many shops
stayed open until midnight. Often
there was no free Sundays.
OBITUARY
Mr. LESLIE GORDON SMITH.
Secretary, Master Builders’ Association of N.S.W.
The death occurred on May 2nd,
1952, at Orange, of Mr. Leslie G.
Smith, Secretary of the Master

Mr. Smith, who was aged 63, was
spending his annual vacation at
Orange with his wife, visiting their
daughter and son-in-law.
He became ill suddenly on the
Friday morning, and was taken to hos-
pital, where he died two hours later.
The funeral took place at Orange,
when many of the lale Mr. Smith’s

A number of leaders of the build-
ing industry made the long journey
from Sydney to be present at the
funeral.
Among them were: The President
of the M.8.A., Mr. Charles E.
Thompson (who was accompanied by
Mrs. Thompson, and Executive Mem-

The service was conducted at the
Holy Trinity Church, Orange, and at
the graveside by the Rev. A. G. Halli-
day.
At the conclusion of this simple but
moving service the Rev. Halliday ex-
pressed his sympathy to members of
the bereaved family at their great loss,
and, in referring to the sudden pass-
ing of Mr. Smith, gave a “few
thoughts to comfort you as you mourn
the loss of a loved one —a dear hus-
band and father.
“He was well thought of in Sydney,
and all those who knew him loved
him.
“He distinguished himself in his ser-
vice to his fellow men; he gave un-
sparingly of his best, and this know-
ledge must comfort you in your deep
sorrow,” the Rev. Halliday added.
The cortege then left for the
Church of England Cemetery where
the interment took place.
Long and Faithful Service.
This Journal has received many
expressions of the esteem in which
the late Mr. L. G. Smith was held by
all who knew him, and his long and
faithful service to the building indus-
try contributed greatly to the develop-
ment and growth of the Master Build-
ers’ Association of N.S.W.
Earlier this year, the Executive of

acknowledgment of the fact that Mr.
Smith had completed 25 years of ex'
ceedingly useful and unbroken service
to the Association, when a presenta'
tion was made to him by the M.B.A.
President, Mr. C. E. Thompson, at
an Executive meeting.
Mr. Thompson at the time told
members that he had a pleasing duty to
perform, which was to make a pres'
entation to the Secretary, Mr. L. G.
Smith, of an engraved tray, bearing
the following inscription—
“Presented to L. G. Smith, Esq.,
J.P., by the Members of the Mast'
er Builders Association of New
South Wales, in appreciation and
esteem of twenty'five years’ loyal,
unbroken service.
“10th October, 1951.”
In accepting the presentation Mr.
Smith said he wished to sincerely
thank the President and other Mem'
bers of the Association for the beau'
tiful gift, and he was particularly grat'
ified to receive, in a tangible form,
this recognition of his services. He
had endeavoured to serve all Mem'
bers without distinction, and express'
ed the opinion that the dearest things
in life could not be bought. He con'
sidered the greatest of all to be the
good wishes and respect of his fellow
men.
Mr. Smith said he had always plac'
ed the Association first and foremost,
often to his personal discomfort, and
could look upon his many years of
service as being, in the main, pleas'
urable though at times exacting, and
requiring constant vigilance.
That he had achieved all this, and
more, is perhaps the greatest tribute
to his life that we can now pay him.
On the occasion of this presentation
this paper commented:
“Through long years of close as'
sociation with Mr. Smith, this paper
and its representative have received
nothing but courteous consideration,
and a kindly understanding of the
many problems which beset a trade
journal of the type and standing of
“Building, Lighting, Engineering.”
Dwelling
Construction Progress
By JOHN O’KEEFFE.
Executive Director of Building
Industry Congress of Victoria.
During the year 1951, the con-
struction rate of dwellings (which in'
dude houses, flats and shops with
dwelling units) increased so rapidly
that the rate of completion was one
new dwelling for every 2.26 persons
increase in the population. This rate
of completion is better than the aver'
age of the past forty years calculated
at fivc'yearly intervals.
The accompanying statistics are tak'
en from the returns published by the
Commonwealth Bureau of Census,
Canberra. The ratios are calculated
from the figures shown in the re'
turns.
The number of dwellings completed
for the fivc'yearly period ended De'
cember, 1950, was over 20 per cent,
higher than any other previous period
recorded by the Bureau.
The rate of completion of dwellings
is indicative of the improving material
situation. The rate per quarter jump'
ed from 59 for every 100 commenced
in March, 1950, to a shade better
than 100 completions for every 100
commenced in December, 1951. The
speed'up to complete in the last quart'
er of any year is usual, although the
ratio has not exceeded 100 : 100 since
December, 1948.
A drop was recorded in the number
of dwellings under construction for
quarter ended December, 1951 —the
first since 1948. The lower commenc'
ing rate has eased the demand for ma-
terials and is probably indicative of
the lack of financial ability to purchase.
Past records help us to assess the num-
ber of houses which should be built
to meet accommodation needs. If pro'
perty owners were free to provide ac'
commodation, assess their own econ-
omic rentals and withdraw the privih
eges of tenancy from undesirable ten'
ants and obtain vacant possession of
their properties when demanded, there
would be no accommodation difficuh
ties. The restrictions contained in the
Landlord and Tenant Act have creat'
ed a situation which conveys a false
impression of housing needs; they
have upset the balance between the
different classes of housing which
should be built and they have deveh
oped a form of political reasoning
which is not directed towards sound
economic development.
VERTICAL FINS FOR SHADE.
Vertical brick “fins” and a concrete slab pro-
jecting tool not only provide shade from
the unwanted fierce rays of the sun but pro-
vide, in the four-square repetition, and the
rich shadow cast, the character of the design
of the Elementary School at Brighton, New
York.

The number of new houses under con-
struction at the end of December,
1951, was 27,219, made up as follows:
Private Contractors 6,3 39
Owner-Builders 16,491
Government Instrument-
alities 4,189
Whereas private contractors had an
average of 2.4 houses per contractor
in course of construction at March,
1950, the average dropped to 1.8 in
the December quarter, 1951. On the
figures supplied by the Statist’s Office,
owner-builders were carrying out 61
per cent, of dwelling construction.
The high cost of building has had the
effect of encouraging enterprising
home-seekers to build one for them-
selves. Whilst the number of owner-
builders (registered as persons erect-
ing buildings without the aid of a
contractor) more than trebled since
June, 1949, and totalled 17,061 at
December, 1951, the recorded number
of contractors showed a 17 per cent,
increase.

tion of Dwellings.

Roof Tiles —94%
Flooring —BB%
Scantlings —39%
K.D. Hardwood —BO%
Cement —97%
Fibrous Plaster —-94%
Earthenware Pipes —97%
The difficulty of procuring material
supplies has eased considerably since
June, 1949.
The number of reports received from
private contractors shows a consider-
able percentage drop over the period
in all of the basic materials listed, with
the exception of hardwood scantlings.
Only a quarter of the number of
builders reporting hold-ups two years
ago are still having a little difficulty
in obtaining their needs. The number
of dwellings held up at December,
1951, was over 80 per cent. less.
For many years prior to World War
11., the percentage value of new build'
ings constructed was:
74% Habitation;
26% Other new buildings.
During the last three years ended
30th June respectively, the ratios
were:
Other New
Habitation Buildings
1949 91% 9%
1950 93% 7%
1951 87% 13%
There is no doubt that political con'
trol over the building industry has
created a very unhealthy situation.
When the building industry is func'
tioning in a healthy way, it is good
for the economic health of the Nation.
Never before in the history of the
State has there been so much concern
tration on house building— concentra'
tion that has been enforced by gov'
ernmental controls.
The balance between the volume of
building for habitation, other new
buildings and public works being
carried out, is not good for the econ-
omic health of the State.
NEW TYPE OPERATING THEATRE.
Interior view of the new oviform operating
theatre in a new French hospital. There are
71 projections embedded in the eggshell, con-
trolled in groups of nine. The domed form
composed of smooth surfaces, continuous and
without angles or projections on which dust
can settle, allows greater control of the
asepsis of the theatre.
OVIFORM OPERATING THEATRE.
This new shape for an operating theatre is
being incorporated in the eight that are being
included in the new Memorial, France—
Etats—Unis, Hospital, being built at St. Lo,
France. It is stated by the designers that this
conception of the operating theatre in the
form of an egg is an attempt at synthesis of
all the needs of the control of the immedlate
ambience around the patient, i.e., lighting,
asepsis, ventilation, safety and all the func-
tions of the patient, surgeons, assistants, an-
aesthetists and nurses. It is claimed that the
avoid form results from and controls., all
these factors. Our illustration shows plans

Immediate Delivery... Faster Wall and Ceiling
Construction with GYPROCK PLASTER WALLBOARD
Gyprock is a new development in beauti-
fully smooth walls and ceilings. A plaster j
wallboard. it’s quicker and cleaner than
other types of plaster construction. Avail- I
able in 10 sheet sizes (6, 7,8, 9 and 10
feet lengths by 4 and 3 feel widths), it’s
very quickly handled—saves building lime
and costs.
There are two types of Gyprock Plaster Wallboard,
RECESSED EDGE. No join, no line, no
nails can be seen with Recessed Edge
Gyprock joint treatment. It gives you a
beautifully smooth, seamless wall and
ceiling surface ideal for papering or
painting.
SQUARE EDGE. The standard “square
edge” board is also obtainable in all sizes.
The rock-like qualities of Gyprock are un-
affected by temperature changes. Its mineral
core is resistant to borers and does not
attract vermin.

Britons Build
Their Own Homes
Enterprise Is Not Dead.
In Lower Bevendean, near Brighton,
England, there stands a group of 20
well-designed, pleasant three-bedroom
houses. Thev are the work of 50 ex-
servicemen who, fed up with waiting
for homes, set about building their
own.
Among them were men skilled in
house-building—bricklayers, carpent-
ers, plumbers, plasterers, and so on.
The whole job was done in their
spare time, and each comfortable house
took 5500 man-hours to complete.
How.
First, they formed themselves into
a society, which anyone in Britain
can do under the Industrial and Pro-
vident Societies Act. Next, the local
council was consulted, the site approv-
ed and. after many delays, the neces-
sary borrowing facilities arranged.
The usual procedure follows these
lines. Each member of a group form-
ed for home building subscribes his
share of one-tenth of the total estimat-
ed cost. The mortgage is for 60
years, the interest 4 p.c.
The contributions of each member
makes him a shareholder, but he en-
ters into an undertaking that,
whether he gets a house at the end of
the job or not, he won’t quit until
the last tile has gone on to the last
roof.
Target.
It follows that in a society of 50
members—regarded as the ideal num-
ber —if the target is 20 houses, not
everyone can become a tenant. Who
gets the houses is a matter for pre-
vious arrangement. And in addition
to the 90 p.c. government loan there
is an additional Government subsidy
of <£l6/10/0 on each completed
house.
Today, there are self-build housing
societies in many parts of Britain,
while in London there exists an organ-
isation with the experience and staff
to help people over the hurdles of
forming a housing society.
It all adds up to this. The spirit
of enterprise is not dead, and in
many instances single-handed and
stout-hearted men have erected their
own homes to the satisfaction of the
local authorities.
• In Peterborough, 50 employees
of an engineering firm—office work-
ers, lorry drivers and machine operat-
ors, are building their own homes in
their spare time.
• Two school teachers, Mr. Cook
and his wife, built their own home at
Letchworth, Herts.
• A 75-year-old retired builder has
completed a house single-handed near
Moseley.
• An engineer of Dartford, Kent,
built his own home in two years and
20 days.
Harnessing the Sun ?
U.S. geologists believe that man will
tap the sun for power in the next 50
years, but doubt if he will do much
industrially with atomic energy in that
period.
This was disclosed in a survey con'
ducted among “leading U.S. geolo-
gists” by the American Geological In-
stitute.
“Despite continuing depletion of
our mineral resources,” the institute
reported, “substantial industrial use of
atomic energy in the next 50 years is
considered relatively improbable.”

Mechanical Aids on Building Sites
THE MONORAIL TRANSPORTER.
Only within the past few years has
serious thought been given to the in'
troducdon of mechanical aids on the
ordinary building site. However, en-
terprising manufacturers and progres-
sive builders have seen the scope for
applying machinery in building, and
there is now available quite a variety
of materials, handling equipment and
power tools which, when properly
used, can speed-up building work by
increasing individual output.
Reorganisation of Site Work
Necessary.
Experience shows that to gain full
benefit from the use of mechanic il
aids and power-driven tools some re-
organisation of site work is necessary,
but it is this requirement and the in-
herent scepticism of many builders
about the value of new devices which
tend to retard their adoption and wider
use.
Mechanical Aids
in Concreting.
The handling and placing of con-
crete has long been an operation in-
volving a considerable amount of
manual work which is not only arduous
but also inefficient and expensive in
the use of available manpower. Many
progressive builders have taken steps
to introduce mechanical aids to this
operation, and they have been spurred
on in their efforts by the present acute
shortage of unskilled labour able and
willing to do work of this nature.
A British development recently in-
troduced into Australia and now being
used successfully by a number of con-
tractors is the “Monorail” transporter,
which consists of a petrol-driven wag-
gon which runs on a single rail and is
used for transporting concrete hod-

zontally from the mixer to the placing
point.
Accurate weighing of concrete ag'
gregate instead of the haphazard shovel
measuring methods formerly used is
doing much to improve the quality of
concrete, while at the same time
making for lower costs and more
efficient work.
The waggon has a capacity of 11
cubic feet and it operates to a distance
of 300 ft. in either direction from the
central mixing plant. As the waggon
is self'operated and is fitted with an
automatic cut'out, no driver is re'
quired during the journey from the
mixer.
The accompanying illustration shows
the Mono'tail track and the waggon
at the end of its run just before dis'
charging into a chute. The track can
be readily assembled on almost any
type of site: in the illustration it is
shown mounted on an overhead trestle'
way erected in a deep drain, but it is
more useful on a flat site where the
track can be laid directly on the
ground.
The time of travel of the waggon
over the 300 ft. in either direction is
one minute, and this speed can be
maintained on gradients up to one in
eighteen. The track is normally
straight, but the waggon will nego'
tiate curves of 12ft. radius if neces'
sary. The 300 ft. of track can be laid
by two men in approximately one
hour for average - site conditions. A
trailer is also supplied, and this can
be coupled to the powered unit when
a larger mixer is being used.
On the job illustrated —a large con'
Crete drain in a Melbourne suburb—
the equipment is handling as much
concrete as would require four men
with wheelbarrows. Due to the better
site organisation made possible by the
use of the equipment it is actually re'
placing six men, and the contractors,
Messrs. MacDougall & Ireland, state
that it has considerably reduced the
cost of handling and placing the com
Crete.

Navigation

Preparation of Returns Is Urgent
National Task.
For several months past, leaders in
the-building industry have been grave'
ly concerned by indications of a down-
ward trend in construction. This dan'
gerous tendency was acutely obyious to
those whose business it is to watch the
various pointers. But nobody is in a
position to plot a complete chart until
the statis icians have collated all the
relevant data.
The Commonwealth Bureau of Cem
sus and Statistics is frequently mis'
understood by those whose duty it is
to render returns upon which official
calculations are based. The Bureau is
helpless to discharge its national re'
sponsibility unless it can secure prompt
and accurate information.
Even at this time, when the building
industry appears to be on the verge of
a crisis, compilation of official reports
is held up for months because a few
people will not bother to do their
part. Builders are among the most
tardy and the result is that remedial

A Warning.
Stewart Fraser, Executive Director of
Building Industry Congress, sounded
a warning this week when he said:
“Some people seem to think that statis'
ticians juggle with figures merely for
public entertainment or to provide in-
teresting conundrums for quiz kids.
But the Commonwealth Bureau of
Census and Statistics is not a green'
room for jugglers; rather is it the
chartroom of our national ship where
the navigators work on their sights and
soundings to plot a safe economic
course.
“The Bureau is constantly engaged
in the preparation of statistical returns
which set out minus any verbal
adornment details of population,
employment, trade, prices, wages, pro'
ductive activity, transport, banking,
etc., etc. This information is vital to
the nation and to everybody concern'
ed with national prosperity and de'
velopment; without these economic
charts our industry and commerce
would be at the mercy of changing
winds and currents which, as has been
seen, almost overnight, can affect our
course and even put the ship hard
aground on some inhospitable reef.”
“The Commonwealth Statistician is
a reasonable sort of bloke,” continued
Stewart Fraser, “and realises that
builders have been beset with manifold
worries and problems during recent
years; he is reluctant to exercise the
wide powers of compulsion which are
vested in him by the Act.” Mr.
Fraser continued: “The Acting Com'
monwealth Statistician. Mr. S. R.
Carver, has gratefully acknowledged
that many builders are most co'opera'
tive and helpful, but many fail to
realise the real functions of his Bureau
or to appreciate that the completion of
returns can help so tremendously to
mitigate the builders’ own problems.”
Statistics Necessary.
The Bureau of Census and Statis'
tics cannot be listed among the number
of bureaucracies to whose existence the
protagonists of Free Enterprise are
prone to take strong exception; these
statisticians are not bureaucrats—they
are navigators. It is wise to cooperate
fully with the navigators in the in'
terests of self'preservation.
Builders, what about those returns?
Make it the next job!
In 1888, when the British Govern'
rnent employed its first two female
typists in the Inland Revenue Depart'
ment, the black'Stockinged pair, weav-
ing celluloid cuffs and high, stiff cob
lars, were shut up in a room and fed

£Bll,OOO to £1,153,000. Paid 'up
Capital has increased £107,000 in that
period. Reserves, all used in the busi'
ness, have increased from £189,000 to
£446,000. These figures speak for
themselves and give a fair indication
of the development of your Company.
Unfortunately, our greatly - increased
annual turnover only yielded an in'
creased profit of £40,000 over the year
1945, attributable to the unprecedent'
ed burden of present taxation and the
rigid fixation of selling prices.
The Balance Sheet which we are
able to present this year gives a clear
picture of the financial position of
the Company at date, and I venture
to think that it will be found eminent'
ly satisfactory. It shows our total
Liabilities, including the Long Term
Loan, as being £1,238,000, whereas
our current Assets alone amount to
£1,458,000 —a surplus of £220,000.
The Directors’ policy continues to
be one of safety by giving every pos'
sible protection to the Shareholders
and stabilitating if possible for some
years ahead the steady dividend of 10
per cent., putting each year any sur'
plus to Reserves and supplying out of
these the requirements of the future
development of the Company. The
present modernisation of our plants is
bing financed out of a loan which we
have negotiated on favourable terms
with the A.M.P. Society, and will en'
able us to carry out our plans for some
years ahead. No further capital issue
is at present contemplated.
I have a few words to say about
the growth of our Staff Partners and
Superannuation Fund that shows an
increase from £73,600 in 1945 to
£152,750 to'day. I have spoken in the
past of the great value of this scheme
to the Company, and it is the Direc'
tors’ determination to continue build'
ing up this Fund out of profits in
accordance with the original proposals
propounded by the late Dr. O.
Wunderlich. I am satisfied that we
are on the right track, and it is amply
borne out by the fact that resignations
by Staff Officers, Foremen and others
who are in the scheme continue to be
negligible.
The expansion in the volume of
business in that great State of Queens'
land is outstanding and has exceeded
our expectations. Also we have in'
creased our manufacturing capabilities
by the addition of a new modern tile
works in Brisbane now in operation.
Our investment in associated com'

WUNDERLICH LTD., ANNUAL
MEETING —Continued.
Address by Mr. D. Croudace,
General Manager.
After placing the matter of assets,
loans, land, building and plant before
the meeting, Mr. Croudace said: “We
have been much disappointed by the
withdrawal by the Federal Govern-
ment of the 40% depreciation allow-
ance on new machinery for Income
Tax one year before the time original-
ly fixed for its expiry. Much of the
machinery which we ordered from
abroad will not now come within the
allowable period. We consider that
when budgeting for a surplus of mil-
lions of pounds there was no need or
excuse for breaking faith with manu-
facturers such as we and putting us
in the invidious position of having to
unexpec.edly provide an additional
£40,000 for Income Tax. Apparently,
some recognition of the mistake has
now been made, for farmers are to be
relieved in this direction as an incen-
tive to produce more, but the Federal
Treasurer should learn that secondary
industries also are worthy of every en-
couragement in their endeavours to
improve production with expensive
modern plant.
Another unexpected shock was the
adoption of new values for Land Tax
Assessment. Up to this year the 1939
valuations have been accepted as static,
but the Valuer-General’s Departments
in the various States have, since the
release of land sales’ control, moved up
the values —some of the more recent
valuations showing a jump of 200%
in three years, the values being prob-
ably based on a recent sale of land in
the locality. These late valuations are
those adopted by the Federal Depart-
ment. We cannot argue against the
values being brought up-to-date, but
the retention of the; old rates on the
increased values has meant a heavy
extra impost on our Company.
The Treasurer has stated that the
average increase is 75%. That being
so, it would appear that secondary in-
dustries arc again “getting it in the
neck,” for the increase in our case is
from £2700 to nearly £12,000, an in-
crease of 350%, even allowing for the
elimination of the 20% super tax and
the raising of the statutory deduction
from £5OOO to £8750.
The absorbing topic to-day in busi-
ness and financial cricles is the meta-
morphosis in Australian economics
which has occurred within the last few
months. Whilst it was recognised
twelve months or more ago that the
great fall in wool prices would serious-
ly affect the national income, few an-
ticipated that it would be necessary for
the Federal Government to act with
such dramatic suddenness in the cur-
tailment of credit and the imposition
of drastic import restrictions.
It is quite evident now that the
Federal Government had no alternative
to clamping down on imports. At the
end of June, 1951, Australian funds
in London were no less than £845 mil-
lion. If imports had continued at the
same rate as that of the last twelve
months, these funds would before long
have been entirely exhausted.
What I do criticise, however, is that
the Government should apparently be
so lacking in up-to-date information as
to allow the position to deteriorate so
seriously before taking steps to correct
it.
The Government encouraged the
ordering of imported materials as one
method of fighting inflation. Then it
found that with the reduction in the
value of exports and the high cost of
swollen imports, dollars or sterling
could not be provided to pay for fur-
ther orders, even finding it necessary
to recall licences already issued. This
has not enhanced Australia’s chances
of raw material supplies in scarce mar-
kets. The failure, even at this late
date, to provide for the licensing of
vital raw materials, is causing us
anxiety.
It is not difficult to establish the
root causes of the financial malady
which is now affecting us. I think t
may be truly said that at no previous
time have we ridden so cheerfully and
carefree on the sheep’s back. Politi-
cians and the worthy Judges of the
Arbitration Court were alike infected
with the idea that everything was so
gloriously wonderful that not only
could we afford to pay fantastic wages
in the Wool Industry, but also gene-
rally reduce the working week through-
out Australia by four hours, with later
an extra £1 per week Basic Wage in-
crease all round and three months
Long Service Leave retrospective for
twenty years in New South Wales and
Queensland, which no doubt the other
States will follow,
Whilst Australian workmen have
been leisurely working a 40-hour week
with all sorts of concessions amenities
an( f social services, we have looked to
the Britisher, American, Italian, Ger-
man Japanese to supply us with
materials to make up the leeway in
production in Australia. The proceeds
from high wool prices have enabled us
to buy heavily from abroad at very

high prices, with freights at peak rates
and 25% exchange as a surcharge on
the total. If greater effort had been
put into production, to a substantial
extent some of these materials could
have been made within Australia.
There has been a tremendous loss
of production caused by senseless
strikes, which repeatedly occur in
various industries, despite our Arbitra*
tion Laws, Conciliation Commissioners
and a multiplicity of awards. How
can the “right to strike” be reconciled
with Arbitration Law? Contrast this
right to ferment industrial trouble with
the recent pronouncement of one of
our Judges that men who had agreed
to picket a New South Wales’ hotel
which they had declared “black” had
rendered themselves liable to prosecu'
tion for criminal conspiracy. And con'
sider also the respective losses to the
community.
All political parties and all brands
of economists in Australia seem now
agreed that we must produce more,
but political exigency again comes to
the fore and it remains to be seen
whether any party will have the
courage to advocate a return to a 48
or even a 44'hour week. That would
be the way to increase production, re'
duce costs and counter inflation, other'
wise nothing can be surer than a fall
in our boasted standard of living,
which recently has been bolstered up
by the high wool market: a standard
not justified by our present efforts nor
by our current earning capacity.
As for this Company, there has—so
far—been little diminution of demand,
and in fact the curb on housebuilding
will have a salutory effect in reducing
long delays between date of order and
supply. The Prime Minister has pro'
mised that the position will be care-
fully watched, for adequate housing
still remains a problem which a con'
stant flow of immigrants will accen'
tuate. The heavy cut in the importa'
tion of building materials will assist
local manufacturers if demands appre'
ciably decline, but even at this stage
there is a great deal of uncertainty
regarding procurement of import
licences for some of our raw materials
—particularly from dollar sources. We
feel, however, that as in the past the
Federal Government will recognise, if
belatedly, the importance of these
materials, not only for housing and
industrial development but also for
projected defence requirements, and
grant the very highest priority for
their importation.
I again wish to thank the Executive,
Staff and Works Foremen for their
unstinted efforts during the year, which
have helped so largely in the realisa'
tion of what I believe you will con'
sider a satisfactory result for the year’s
operations.

Steel industry engineers pushed back the sea to establish a new
industrial centre at the iron ore port of Whyalla on the western
shore of Spencer Gulf, South Australia. The tidal swamp of
thirteen years ago has been transformed by B.H.P, enterprise
into Australia’s largest shipyard, which has launched 126,000
tons of merchant shipping since 1942, a modern blast furnace
plant, and a deep-water harbour.
With industry came people, and a modern town was planned
and built. In ten years, Whyalla’s population rose from 1,200
to 8,000. With its fine modern homes and civic amenities,
Whyalla is a living, growing symbol of Australian enterprise

BOOK REVIEW.
“Thermal Properties of Building,”
by N. S. Billington. 208 pp.
Illustrated. Index. Cleaver-
Hume Press Ltd., London.
English price, 25/-.
“It is only within comparatively re-
cent years that special attention has
been paid to the thermal properties of
building materials and structures,” says
the author in the Introduction. By
this, we mean, he says, “conscious at-
tention,” for it is of interest to note
that many features of traditional de-
signs were highly satisfactory from
the thermal point of view. Such good
features include the use of massive
structures, whether of stone or mud,
both in temperate and in hot climates;
the employment of wood panelling and
tapestry hangings on the walls of
mediaeval castles, and the use of mate-
rials which can “breathe” and absorb
water without serious consequences.
New Materials: New Problems.
It is strange to record that the first
impacts of science, coupled with the
need for more rapid and cheaper
houSe construction, resulted in an im-
provement in some standards of de-
sign, but in a deterioration in the
thermal qualities.
The introduction of new materials
also brought in its train a number of
new problems which did not occur in
traditional forms of construction and
it was gradually realised that many of
these problems had arisen because the
thermal properties of the materials
had been neglected. One such prob-
lem was condensation.
A Complex Problem.
The variable flow of heat is a com-
plex problem and this fact combined
with a lack of appreciation of its im-
portance in building construction and
design has led to its almost complete
neglect by both architects and scien-
tists until recent years.
It is the intention of this book to
bring together the existing knowledge
on all such problems and to explain
the general principles involved so that
anyone designing a house or a heating
or air-conditioning system may have
the benefit of such data as are avail-
able relating to the particular prob-
lems associated with the heating or
cooling of buildings.
Mr. Billington, who is a M.Sc., is
well-qualified to write such a book for
in addition to being the Head of the
National College of Heating, Ventila-
tion, Refrigeration and Fan Engineer-
ing in London, he was for a number
of years associated with the Building
Research Station at Watford as Prin-
cipal Scientific Officer.
SUPPLEMENTING MECHANISED COAL MINING.
Coal cleaning was considered advantageous by the steel industry before the days of mechanised
mining, but has now become essential in order to keep down the ash content of the coke
fed to the blast furnaces. The upper picture shows the Barvoys-type washer, employed in
conjunction with a static dry cleaner, installed in 1945 at the Newcastle steelworks. Its
capacity is 300 tons per hour. To treat the southern coking coals a Baum jig-type coal washer,
with a capacity of 250 tons pet hour was placed in service at Port Kembla in 1948. Pre-
viously a washing plant had operated at Wongawilli colliery. The two plants involved a
capital outlay of £1.000,000. The lower view shows two of the 15 diesel-driven colliery loco-
motives supplied to Australian Iron & Steel by Malcolm Moore Pty. Ltd. These weigh
25 tons and will operate at speeds up to 14 m.p.h. They are powered by 204 b.h.p. diesel
engines.

AUSTRALIAN PAPER MANUFACTURERS’ ACTIVITIES.
Paper Talk,” journal of Australian
Paper Manufacturers Ltd., contains an
interesting account of the work that is
being carried out by its subsidiary
company, A.P.M. Forests Pty. Ltd., in
the fields of timber for the company’s
activities and reafforestation.
The new organisation, formed in
January, 1951, is divided into two de'
partments: Wood Procurement and
Forestry Development.
The Wood Procurement Depart'
ment is responsible for the supply of
pulpwood and saw logs. Its major task
is to supply Maryvale pulp mill and
the three Company sawmills, but when
other pulp mills are buit it will ex'
pand its operations to cover them also.
Pulpwood is drawn from State
Forests, private land and Company
forest in Gippsland. Contracts are let
for the supply of pulpwood and logs
to Maryvale mill and the field staff of
the Wood Procurement Department
supervise operations in the bush. A
large'scale bush operation such as the
one in progress in the State Forest at
Boola Boola requires very careful plan'
ning. Major roads costing thousands
of pounds per mile must be built, to'
gether with a host of secondary roads
and extraction tracks. Camps must
be erected and maintained, cutting
areas must be planned for summer and
winter operations.
The Boola Boola operation is the
largest single bush operation at pre'
sent. It is being expanded from 8000
cunits to 20,000 cunits this year; next
year output will be increased still fur'
ther. [A cunit is a unit of measure'
ment used in the logging industry and
is equal to 9.42 super feet “hoppers”
—a hopper in this case being a con'
tainer used for pulp.]
Fire'killed Mountain Ash and Wool'
lybutt are being salvaged from Mat'
lock, Upper Thomson and Tanjil.
Cutting is confined to places where
there is little regrowth so that second
crop will not be damaged.
These bush operations require a
large amount of mechanical equip'
ment. Tractors, bulldozers, graders,
top trucks, fire tankers, power saws,
etc., are operated by the Company,
hired to contractors, or sold under
hire purchase. When the pulp is fully
expanded about 33 tractors will be re'
quired for log hauling and road
making. Drag saws and chain saws
are counted by the dozen.
4000 Acres Planted.
The Plantation Section has de'
veloped rapidly. In 1970 it planted
600 acres of pine and in 1951 almost
2,000 acres. This year 4,000 acres
will be planted. When the plantation
project started it was realised that it
would have to be highly mechanised
if costs were to be kept down and

WELCOME TO MEXICO.
Mexico expects, more than 400,000 tourists
from the United States during 1952, and it is
likely that more than 10,000 cars per month
will cross the border at Laredo, Texas, dur-
ing the peak of the season. So Mexico has
built the 500,000 dollars immigration and
customs station at Nuevo Laredo, illustrated
above, just across the Rio Grande. To expe-
dite handling the great influx of automobile
traffic, there is an entrance road 11 lanes
wide. The building is of red brick faced
with concrete blocks and is completely air-
conditioned. The view is from the Inter-
national Bridge.

target areas were to be planted out
each year. During the past two years
special equipment has been purchased
or designed for each separate opera-
tion involved in pine establishment,
and as a result of this careful planning
the planting schedule has been main-
tained and costs kept down.
Planting a pine-tree may sound
simple, but there are a host of things
to do. Briefly they are as follows;
During the winter plans for the fol-
lowing year are made, a nursery site
is chosen and prepared with as much
care as a market garden. The seeds
are sown by the million in the spring
and the beds are carefully weeded and
tended throughout the summer. At
the end of May the pine seedlings are
about lOins. high and are ready to
be planted out.
While the pine seedlings are grow-
ing the chosen area is cleared and
fenced and prepared for planting. If
it is timbered the “Hi-ball” is used.
The story behind this machine is told
elsewhere in this issue. If there is
only regrowth and small trees on the
block an anchor chain is dragged be-
hind two tractors. Everything is up-
rooted. Where ti-tree occurs a super
Mallee roller is used to break it down
and cut it up for subsequent burning.
Timber and scrub is heaped into rows
and burned in the autumn. After
burning, the land is ploughed. After
clearing and fencing is completed, our
rabbit extermination team starts opera-
tions to try to get rid of every rabbit,
as they have a habit of biting the heads
off the seedlings after planting.
As soon as the first winter rains
come in May or June, planting starts.
Lowther mechanical tree planters, im-
ported from America, are used. To
save tractors and expense two planters
are towed on a drawbar side by side
behind one small tractor. Such a
team can plant between 16,000 and
20.000 trees per day. This winter
there will be a capacity of nearly
100.000 trees per day. After planting
is completed the cycle of operations
commences again.
“Whatever we do,” says the article
in conclusion, “we keep our goal in
sight— a sustained yield from all our
forests and plantations to cater for
A.P.M.’s needs, both now and far into
the future—in fact, trees forever.”
A new hut developed by the U.S.
Air Material Command for Arctic
conditions, unfolds from a compact
bundle and can be inflated with
simple hand pumps in three minutes.
“Nagging” comes from the Anglo-
Saxon word, ‘"gnag-an”—to gnaw or
bite.
Ministers Prepare
Works Programme
But Restrict Spending.
In advising State Cabinet Ministers
to prepare 1952-53 works programmes,
totalling £70,370,000, the Premier, Mr
Cahill, has counselled them not to
spend at that rate until the result of
the next Commonwealth loan is an-
nounced.
The Premier so advised his Minis-
ters in view of decisions made at the
recent Loan Council in Canberra.
At that time, the Commonwealth
said that only £lBO million would be
available for State works in 1952-53
—£so million from loans and £l3O
million to be found by the Common-
wealth —with an additional £3O million
for housing.
Disregarding this, the Premiers
over-rode the Commonwealth and
adopted State works to cost £247,-
500,000, in the belief that the loan
market will yield more than Com-
monwealth authorities predict.
• Under the £247,500,000 figure,
N.S.W. would get £70,370,000, plus
£12,100,000 for housing.
® Under the £lBO million scheme,
N.S.W. would get £5l million, plus
£8 million for housing.
Originally, N.S.W. asked the Loan
Council for £94,784,000 for State
public works and £17,100,000 for
housing.
Mr. Cahill advised his Ministers to
proceed with their programmes "care-
fully, cautiously and conservatively”
until the result of the first loan (prob-
ably by July next) was known.
BRITISH TELEVISION
CONVENTION.
The Television Convention, the
“British Contribution to Television,”
organised by the Radio Section of the
Institution of Electrical Engineers, was
held in London from April 28 to
May 3, and emphasised the importance
of television in modern life.
The opening ceremony was per-
formed by Lord Woolton, Lord Presi-
dent of the Council, and addresses by
Sir John Hacking, President of the
Institution of Electrical Engineers, and
by Sir Noel Ashbridge, Director of
Technical Services, 8.8. C., were given.
Historically, Britain has done vitally
important pioneer work in industrial,
no less than in broadcasting, television;
and the various applications of tele-
vision technique which fall outside the
field of broadcasting were reviewed.
Visit to T.V. Studios.
There were also visits to the 8.8. C.
television studios, the Post Office Re-
search Station, the terminal of the
London - Birmingham television link
and to the premises of a number of
manufacturers of television equipment.

Mr. G. Grey Wornum, F.R.1.8.A.,
has been selected as the R.1.8.A.
Royal Gold Medallist for 1952.
He came into prominence when in
1933 he won' the world-wide archi-
tectural competition for the design of
the R.1.8.A. Headquarters at 68 Port-
land Place.
He was also responsible for decora-
tion and design work on the “Queen

New Holden Distributing Centre
MILITARY ROAD, MOSMAN, SYDNEY.
In designing the new Holden Dis-
tributing Centre at Mosman, the
Architects, Spinks and Sever, have
utilised to the full the flexibility of
design offered by structural steel and
reinforced concrete to produce a
thoroughly functional building that
serves its purpose as a display, ser-
vicing and distributing centre for the
Holden motor-car.

Unbroken Facade.
The whole of the facade, which is
80 feet long, is of plate glass entire-
ly uninterrupted by any solid sup-
port, which imparts a light, graceful
effect and enables the cars on display
to be seen from any angle whatso-
ever. The roof and awning is
supported by four Sin. diameter steel
stanchions which are set 23in. back
from the glass. The roof construc-
tion is also unusual and consists of
cranked rolled steel joists that form
the roof of the showroom and the
cantilever awning. In order to com-
pensate for the natural light lost by
the awning, a series of clere-story
windows above it give unimpaired
light to the interior: a series of metal
louvres in the interior prevent the
direct rays of the sun —the building
faces north—from penetrating and
causing unwanted glare. They also
serve to give a maximum of reflected
light to the showroom.
Two-storey Section.
At the rear of the showroom,
which has a tiled floor and is appoint-
ed in polished silky oak, is a two-
storey section housing General Office,
Manager’s Office, and Toilet accom-
modation.
At the rear of the showroom block
is the workshop section, served by
direct in and out access, and which is
equipped with the most modern plant
and equipment for car and engine
servicing.
The building, which is set back to
the new alignment for the future
widened street, is undoubtedly a first-
class addition to the commercial build-
ings in this district.

MIRROR FOR SAFETY.
Aid to Trucks.
When a new building is in course
of construction in a busy street, with
the enclosure extending well out past
the footpath, getting in and out of
the enclosure with delivery trucks is
often a ticklish task, and there is
a grave danger of accidents.
To give drivers a view of approach-
ing traffic, a mirror, severals inches
square, and placed on a post on the
left-hand side of the entrance, will
greatly assist drivers to pick their
time for entering the traffic stream.

phur springs, jam rolls, grass-slopes,
and music stands; Katoomba Falls,
moonlight walks, sheep run, and holi-
day trips; scandal spreads, standard
weights, rubber tyres, the organ stops,
and the world goes round; trade re-
turns.”

turned and put his head in at the

FINE NEW STATE SCHOOL
WYNNUM, QUEENSLAND.
By F. O. NIXON.
The constantly ' growing demands
for new schools in Queensland, arising
from arrivals of emigrant families and
a greatly'accelerated birtlvrate, which
can be ascribed to high and higher
wages, child endowment and better
housing, is being met bv the Depart'
ment of Public Instruction in a very
creditable manner.
The priority of this class of build'
ing construction, on a plane with
housing, benefits, of course, from the
controls placed upon the greater
majority of so many other classes of
buildings.
The Wynnum Central School illus'
trated on this page embodies the
second section of the building refer'
red to in a previous issue.
In its completed state it might be
regarded as transitional in its design.
Although such design elements pre'
dominate, the functional elements are
strong. More particularly is this evh
dent in generous window openings, as
there should be in tropical and semi'
tropical zones. The shielding hood
to the lower windows and the win'
dow grouping are amongst the con-
spicuous features.
The teachers’ rest'room and the
head teacher’s office flank the en'
trance lobby, with classrooms to both
East and West of the central feature,
with a wide connecting corridor on
the Northern side.
On the ground floor is an enclosed
playing area with ample protection
from inclement weather, while at the
same time the area is accessible from
within the building.
Two essential features in any build'
ing—and too often neglected—venti'
lation and lighting, have been studied
assiduously, and the photograph,
taken at 10.30 a.m., clearly illus-
trates the exclusion of sunlight from
the classrooms.
The singledine planning ensures
the entry of the predominating
favourable breezes, and Winter
warmth to the classrooms.
As the suburb of Wynnum is a
rapidly' growing one, thirteen miles
from Brisbane, on very high ground
overlooking the Southern shoreline
of Moreton Bay, this architecturally
charming building is delightfully
placed.
In its length of 178 feet, it contains
18 classrooms, two storeys and a base'
ment, the roofing of red Marseilles
tiles blending with the red brick walls
with cream cement facing, the central
pillasters being capped and finished
in cream cement also.
The design for the building came
from the architects of the Public
Works Department, and all the work
was carried out by the regular artisans
of the same Department.

STEEL FRAMEWORK
Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modern school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and Hilcon lightweight precast reinforced
concrete Roof, Floor and Wall units.
All Presweld Components are permanently rust-
proofed by the hot dip galvanizing process.

“Bristol” Aluminium Buildings in Ulster
SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION PROBLEMS OVERCOME.
The widespread adoption of “Bris-
tol” permanent aluminium buildings
in Northern Ireland has a double sig'
nificance, for it provides a typical
example of an urgent school accom-
modation problem swiftly alleviated
and also illustrates how emergency
conditions have speeded the general
acceptance of aluminium as a modern
building material, needing only the
passage of time to achieve the “tradi-
tional” status of materials which it is
replacing in so many present' day
building schemes.
Probably no area of comparable
size anywhere has made such an ex-
tensive use of “Bristol” aluminium
buildings to provide new schools and
extensions to existing schools, and
probably no other area comparable
with Northern Ireland has been faced
with a more acute problem for many
Ulster schoohchildren were housed in
temporary timber schools, in village
halls and in various existing institu-
tional buildings, and in some cases
were kept in primary schools until
the age of fourteen owing to the lack
of secondary schools.
A major reason for that situation
was that few schools were built dur-
ing the period between the two wars,
with the result that Ulster, unlike
other parts of Great Britain, possess'
ed not one secondary school on
public charge when the “Butler”
Education Act was passed in 1947.
A factor which exerted a particular'
ly powerful influence in favour of the
aluminium school was the flexibility
of the system of construction, for
apart from the speed of erection, the
aluminium school has also the ad'
vantage that the layout may at any
time be varied to meet unforeseen
requirements.
In May, 1949, Northern Ireland’s
first “Bristol” building—Bangor Tech'
nical school —was declared open, and
from this time onwards adoption of
the “Bristol” system spread rapidly.
The well'known aircraft firm. Short
Bros, and Harland, of Belfast
already a successful collaborator with
the parent “Bristol” company in the
production of many famous aircraft—
took up the Northern Ireland agency
for the sale and erection of alu-
minium schools, and found that the
volume of business soon demanded
the exclusive attention of a separate
and self-contained building organisa-
tion, including administrative, produc-
tion, sales and erection departments.
To-day there are some twelve “Bris-
tol” schools in Ulster, providing ac-

RESTAURANT AND CLASSROOM.
Two uses for “Bristol" aluminium buildings
are shown in these Northern Ireland installa-
tions. (Top) A woodwork classroom at

was described as “gay, airy and matching the

commodation for 3000 schoohchildren,
and many more, which will provide
3500 places, are scheduled for early
erection, and there is no doubt that
the system will continue in great de'
mand.
There are in Northern Ireland
several outstanding examples of the
system s application to specialist uses,
notably a large extnesion at Mucka'
more Abbey Mental Hospital and an
extension at the Royal Victoria Hos'
pital, Belfast.
Another excellent example of the
“Bristol” system’s adaptation for medb
cal purposes is provided by the
Medical Department erected within a
few weeks at the Short Bros, and
Harland Queen’s Island plant. Lay'
out of the unit has been carefully
planned to meet the medical needs of
a large industrial organisation, facili'
tating speedy treatment of everyday
minor ailments and at the same time
making provision for the more serious
cases which occur from time to time.
The system was also adopted by
Mr. H. Lynch Robinson, A.R.1.8.A.,
to provide a creche and restaurant at
the Belfast Festival of Britain site,
and here its use was particularly sue'
cessful, and its appearance struck a
modern note entirely in harmony with
“festival” decor and demonstrated
that “Bristol” components can, with
imaginative grouping, achieve
aesthetic effects in complete accord
with modern architectural design re'
quirements.
Extensions to Muckamore Abbey
Mental Hospital, Belfast.
A SObed extension in “Bristol”
permanent aluminium buildings at
Muckamore Abbey Mental Hospital,
near Belfast, Northern Ireland—first
premises designed and built in Ulster
for care and training of patients sub
fering from arrested or incomplete
mental development was recently
opened. The extension, which is an
outstanding example of the applica'
tion of “Bristol” buildings for a
specialist purpose, has trebled the sise
of the Institution. Erected at a cost
of £68,000, the extension is a pre*
liminary step in the plans of the
Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority
to develop the Muckamore Abbey
estate into a lOOObed colony.
The extension buildings include: —

20 beds, two dormitories and

POLISH BORDER FORTIFIED
BY COMMUNISTS.
It seems the signing of the treaty
with West Germany, U.S.A., France
and England last week was none too
soon. On the Russian side prepara'
tions have been blatantly proceeding
for years.
It is reported from Germany that
the Polish Communist regime has
started the installation of minefields,
as well as the construction on anti'
tank obstacles and barbed wire bar'
riers along a two'mile strip of land
following the Oder-Neisse line divid'
ing Poland from Germany.
The Polish'German frontier is now
under the control of the Red Army.
On the German side, the guards re'
ceived orders to fire at every person
trying to cross the frontier. Guard
towers were erected at 500'yard in'
tervals and they are armed with
machine'guns. On the Polish side,
new heavy bunkers overlook the forth
fied boundary strip.
The largest tree ever felled on the
N. Queensland tableland, in the Dan'
bulla scrub, had a girth of 22 feet
9 inches. The logs 30ft., 24ft. and
25ft. long were too big to go through
the railway tunnels and had to be
milled on the tableland.

INTERESTING HISTORICAL FACTS.

It is difficult to say exactly when
the streets of Sydney were first illu'
minated. It would not be correct so
to class the bonfires lighted on Feb'
ruary 3, 1788, the day on which
Phillip’s Commission was read, as
there were then no streets to illu'
minate. Nor would the bonfires on
the following June 4, the King’s
birthday, be such. Probably the first
definite occasion would be the night
of the arrest of Governor Bligh, for,
of that day, Johnson wrote to Castle'
reagh: 'The general joy that was felt
displayed itself in rejoicings, bonfires
and illuminations.’’ Although he does
not say what form the illuminations
took, no doubt Macarthur and his
friends saw to it that they were
worthy of the occasion.
On the evening of July 13, 1821,
to celebrate the return of Governor
and Mrs. Macquarie from a visit to
Van Diemen’s Land, the township
was illuminated. No actual methods
are recorded, but the late Mr. J. P.
McGuanne wrote that, from his know'
ledge of the period, it meant that the
windows of the houses would be illu'
minated with lamps and candles, some
bonfires, flaring oil pots and tar bar'
rels on vacant spots.
An illumination of a paltry charac'
ter took place on October 1, 1831,
the night of Governor Darling’s de'
parture from Government House.
His opponents manifested their hearty
approval of his recall by lighting up
their office windows and displaying
transparencies.
The beginning of the regular light'
ing of Sydney’s streets was made on
April 7, 1826. On that evening, the
first street lamp was lighted in Mac'
quarie Place. In the following year,
the principal streets of the town were
illuminated. It is recorded that on
March 14, 1827, John White success'
fully tendered for the work of sup'
plying oil and wicks for 100 lamps,
and for keeping them alight each
night from half an hour after sun'
set until sunrise next morning, for a
payment of £346 a year. The lamps
were erected fifty yards apart diagon'
ally opposite along the streets. How
often John White had to complain
about the local lads who took a de-
light in smashing the lamps—and his
profits!
The next stage came with the in'
troduction of gas. On the night of
May 24, 1841, the Queen’s Birthday,
there was a display of gas signs on
Church Hill to show the possibilities
of gas lighting. Signs of various pat'
terns were erected, “Advance, Aus'
tralia, and “Success to the Australian
Gaslight Co. ’ being prominent. The
streets of Sydney were first lighted
by gas on the following evening.
May 25, 1841.
The first gas lamps were jet
burners, and their light would not be
a very great improvement on oil
lamps. But with the general intro'
duction of the incandescent burner in
November, 1896. there would be a
very noticeable change in street light'
ing. The competition with the slow'
ly expanding system of electric light'
ing helped to bring improvements in
gas lighting.
Electricity was first used regularly
to light the city’s streets in 1904.
These first lamps were arc lamps,

PRODUCTION OF FIBRES
IN PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.
Pandanus Fibre for Fibrous Plaster.
Extensive Experimental Work.
For many years before the 1939'45
War experiments had been carried out
in Papua and New Guinea with a
number of vegetable fibre crops, and
it was established that sisal, jute,
manila hemp, ramie, etc., would grow
satisfactorily in the Territory. Since
the war the world shortages and
Australian requirements, particularly
in regard to jute, have revived interest
in the possibilities of fibre production
in Papua and New Guinea.
In the later part of 1950 an Agri'
cultural Officer of the Papua and New
Guinea Administration was sent to
Florida (U.S.A.) and Cuba to study
fibre developments in these countries,
particularly in kenaf, a jute substitute.
Kenaf is a soft fibre obtained from
the stem of a species of hibiscus
(hibiscus cannabinus) and has been
found suitable for most of the pur'
poses for which jute is used.
His report expressed the opinion
that kenaf showed every prospect for
development as a major crop in the
Territory.
About 6000 lbs. of seed was pro'
cured from Cuba, and a private firm
associated with the investigations in
Florida and Cuba has carried out com'
mercial planting on a small scale near
Port Moresby.
The Flax Research Section of the
Commonwealth Scientific and Indus'
trial Research Organisation is co'
operating in the testing of fibres pro'
duced in the Territory. Tests so far
completed on kenaf indicate that a
good quality fibre of satisfactory
strength can be produced. Arrange'
ments are in hand for larger scale
tests, the more important of which
will be the spinning of up to i'ton
lots by private firms in trials for dif'
ferent end uses.
In addition to kenaf, other fibres
including manila hemp, sisal, iute,
pandanus and a number of indigenous
fibre plants are being examined to
determine their economic possibilities
in the Territory. Of these, manila
hemp and sisal for cordage and sisal
and possibly pandanus fibre for the
manufacture of fibrous plaster build'
ing boards seem to offer the best pros'
pects.
The areas in Papua and New
Guinea considered to be the best
suited for production of fibres are the
Oro Bay'Dobudura area, the Upper
Markham ' Ramu area, the Kemp
Welch River area, and the Sepik
Valley.
The Commonwealth Government
and the Papua and New Guinea Ad'
ministration will give encouragement
to private enterprise to establish the
fibre industry in Papua and New
Guinea by making land available,
giving technical advice to producers
and providing planting material.
There are 8000 different species of
mammals; more than 16,000 different
varieties of birds; 40,000 known
species of fish; 80,000 kinds of mob
luscs —snails and shell fish; and no
less than half a million known species
of insects.
A British soil authority recently
worked out the number of insects un'
der every square mile of soil. His
total was 2240 millions.

Holland Overtakes Housing Lag
Will Complete Programme by 1954.
There is a great deal to be said
for a nation which, by dint of prodh
gious human effort, rises from war and
water and, furthermore, reduces its
housing target by three years.
Of all the countries overrun by
the Germans, none has made swifter
progress toward normal living than
the picturesque little Kingdom of the
Netherlands, with its population of
just over 10,000,000, even though it
is still cut off from much of the rich
colonial empire which contributed
greatly to its pre'war prosperity.
The Netherlands endured unspeak'
able tortures under German occupa'
tion. In five years nearly 200,000
Dutch citizens, including some 110,000
Jews, fell before German firing
squads or perished in the cyanide
“shower baths” of concentration
camps because of suspected anti'Nazi
activities or Jewish ancestry.
Close to a million had been taken
from their homes for forced labour in
Germany, Poland, and Russia.
But the sturdy Dutch are fighting
their way back, rising from the tragic
effects of war and water (some of the
richest land of the country had been
flooded with salt sea water), and fight'
ing their way back from the extrem-
ities of destitution, desperation and
starvation.
Ahead of Target.
And now Holland, having set
1957 as the target for overtaking its
housing deficit, finds that, as the result
of a mighty concerted effort, it will
complete the programme by 1954.
Few realise the vast amount of
damage the Nazis did to the Nether'
lands.
For instance, in the central part of
Rotterdam, in an area of 325 acres,
the Nazis destroyed 25,000 dwellings,
500 restaurants, 4 hospitals, 21
churches, 69 schools, 1200 factories,
and more than 2300 retail shops,
banks, theatres, and other buildings,
not counting harbour installations.
In the Hague, in September, 1941,
Hitler started to build his “Atlantic
Wall,” and the first landmark to go
was the celebrated seaside resort of
Scheveningen. This beach was com-
pletely cleared and hundreds of homes
were demolished.
Extending toward the Hague it'
self, an area one and a quarter miles
deep, reaching back from the coast,
was evacuated. About 8000 houses
were demolished in this operation,
and about 85,000 residents were evac-
uated from the city.
Holland has solved most of its prob'
lems by building multiple dwellings,
such as those in Scandinavia and in
London.
(It seems as if we are “hysterical
about the individual house” —to quote
an Australian authority—which is un-
doubtedly the most extravagant of all
forms of housing in modern town
planning. Wasteful of travelling time
and fares which have taken on fabu'
lous dimensions, to say nothing of
miles and miles of piping for water,
sewerage, electricity and all other ser'
vices.
In the meantime the Netherlands is
facing its future with every confidence.
Damage to the cities and countryside
has been repaired in addition to its
housing target previously mentioned,
three years before it was anticipated.
The people are hard at work
everywhere, and visitors can now find
few scars of war on the pleasant Dutch
landscape.
“The sky’s the limit” is the U.K.
housing target as set by Mr. Harold
Macmillan, the Housing Minister.
£30,000 million is the American
budget figure for the financial year
ending June 30, 1953.

Elizabeth Street
Extensions
Projej[?]t May Be Revived.
One of the oldest State Government
projects, the Elizabeth Street extern
sion plan, is likely to be revived in
the near future.
The transformation plans calls for
the closing of the northern part of
Phillip Street, city, and to extend Eliz'
abeth Street from its present end at
Hunter Street on as far as Bent
Street, more than a good'sized block
away.
Resumptions were begun for the
project 30 years ago when it was first
planned.
The buildings, including shops, of'
fices and residential are still under
the resumption order and owners are
not happy about making any im'
provements to their property.
One owner who was about to start
“a skyscraper’’ worthy of the valu'
able site in Hunter Street, had ah
ready excavated this to receive the
foundations. This site has since been
used for parking cars. The Union
Club was another building in the
way, but because this is such an at'
chitecturally perfect building and
therefore a landmark of much distinc'
tion, there was such an outcry that
this had to be “called off’’, though
money had been passed and refunded
in the transaction. Perhaps the in'
fluence and affluence behind the Club
contributed to the decision not to
proceed with the scheme until some
thing better could be found to house
their activities.
Another site that could not be
built upon though plans had been
made for a worthy building and the
former structures were pulled down,
has since been used as an open air
car park. It is in Phillip Street at
the rear of the Union Club.
The proposed plan is a major work
which would involve a huge sum and
would take several years’ work.
Qantas Empire Airways is one of
the companies concerned with the
plan. It has bought a large building
block close to the proposed new
course of Elizabeth Street but can'
not have plans drawn for new head'
quarters before a plan of the propos'
ed street work is finalised.
The City Council claims that it is
waiting for the Commonwealth Gov'
ernment, which is interested in the
scheme, to resume a section of Phillip
Street.
G.P.O. CLOCK TOWER.
Inspection Reveals Careful Storage.
In company with officers of the
P.M.G., several executive members of
the Town Planning Association of
N.S.W. recently inspected the stored
parts of the Sydney G.P.O. clock
tower (including the clock). They
reported that all essential parts were
found to be in good order and care'
fully preserved and the undertaking
given by the Department that tower,
clock and bells would be preserved was
being fulfilled.
All that is needed now is to restore
it to its rightful place.
Each 24 hours your heart pumps
about 3500 gallons of blood, repre'
senting a dead weight of about nine

In 1714, the British Government
offered £20,000 for an accurate
method of determining a ship’s posh

six weeks’ voyage. Full award was
won by a Yorkshire carpenter, John
Harrison, whose 5 in. diameter chrom

FORESTRY IN MALAYA
IMPORTANT WORK RECOMMENDED.
Like most other aspects of Malaya’s
industrial and agricultural life, forestry
and the treatment of inland areas for
regeneration was completely disrupt'
ed by the occupation, when uncon'
trolled exploitations of reserves—par'
ticularly in the accessible lowland
areas —and destruction of large food
areas went unchecked. PosUwar de'
mands on timber have been heavy,
and in nine months after the war the
out'turn was million cubic feet to
meet the demands for reconstruction
of railways, military works, the
P.W.D., mines and estates. Steps
have been taken to systemise regenera'
tion operations in all reserves, and
unrestricted fellings has been stopped.
INCREASED MANPOWER
IN THE MINES.
U.K. Coal Stocks Rise.
The rising stocks of coal in Britain
as well as the increase in manpower
is an encouraging omen for next
winter.
Existing stocks total over 13 million
tons, a substantial gain on the
million tons of a year ago. Mam
power at 713,600 is the highest figure
since September, 1949.
BRITAIN'S GIANT NEW OIL
PLANT.
Work on the first stage of the new
<£4o million refinery of the Anglo'
Iranian Oil Company in Kent, South
England, which has kept more than
5,000 workers busy since July, 1950,
is nearing completion.
Operations are due shortly to be'
gin, and in 1953 an annual output of
four million tons, or 8,000 barrels a
day, is expected.
The project is part of the current
refinery expansion programme which
has increased the total amount of
crude oil processed in the U.K. from
2-| million tons in 1946 to mil'
lion in 1951, and which aims at about
24 million tons this year.
The new refinery in Kent, which
is situated on the marshy and historic
Isle of Grain, will be the second
largest in Europe, smaller only than
Esso refinery at Fawl e v, near
Southampton. It will partially offset
the loss of refining facilities which
the company suffered at Abadan last
year.

PRESENT OUTLOOK
IN AUSTRALIA.
A.N.Z. Bank’s “Quarterly Survey. ’
Referring to the recent steps taken
to. reduce imports into Australia, the
“Quarterly Survey” of Australia and
New Zealand Bank Limited states that
“even though import restrictions have
been considered unavoidable
present conditions, it is still important
to stimulate exporls in a positive at-
tempt to provide a long'term remedy
for the oversea trade balance.”
After drawing a distinction between
the quantities of wheat and meat pro'
duction in Australia on the one hand,
commodities which are sold under
government'controlled prices, and wool
production on the other, the Bank
points out that “Government controls
are not the answer to the problem of
raising the output of Australia’s agh'
cultural and pastoral industries. If
Australia is to achieve a significant in'
crease in output it is important to re-
store the incentive of a flexible &ys'
tern,” and goes on to say that “Recent
experience in Australia points plainly
to the fact that price is an important
stimulus.”
The “Survey” reviews a number of
significant factors affecting production,
and concludes that “in the final
analysis production depends on incen'
tive, and the final determinant of in'
centive is price. Increased prices cl
foodstuffs and raw materials bring their
own problems, but we are faced with
the difficulty that if we want more
food we must be prepared to pay for
it. There can be no doubt that Aui'
tralia has the resources to produce
vastly increased quantities of food.
The problem is one of ensuring that
the materials and equipment are pro'
vided, and that incentives to individual
producers are sufficient to stimulate a
really significant increase in output.”
Prospects for increased steel pro'
duction in Australia are reviewed in
an article on “Steel for Australia's
Expansion,” which claims that addh
tional plant and improvements in steel'
making practice “will raise annual
capacity of the Australian isdustry from
If million to 2f million tons by
1953.”
The “Survey” goes on to consider
the supplies of labour and coal. The
labour force is being steadily expand'
ed as a result of several factors, but
is still far short of requirements. Im'
proved supply of immigrant labour
has been a major consideration, while
the critical need for housing has been
met to some degree by the building
of hostels by the Commonwealth
Government and by the steel industry
itself, and by housing construction
activities of State Government auth< '
rities.”
Coal Supply “Improving.”
“But the most critical requisite for
expansion of output appears to be
coal. Additional coke ovens are being
installed to process coal into coke for
the blast furnaces, so that Australia
will have the plant to produce greatly
increased quantities of iron and steel
in future, providing the coa is avai'
abe. The restricted output of the
bast furnaces in recent years has been
governed by the limited supplies of
coal available, but the position has
been steadily improving.
“Thus the increased coal production
of 1951,” continues the Survey,
“largely explained the improved levels
of iron and steel production. Since
the mines resumed in 1952, coal pro'
duction has been in keeping with 1951
levels.”
Britain, Canada and the U.S. will
combine resources to build, equip
and man squadrons of Sabre jet fight'
ers. Canada will build the planes;
the U.S. will equip them; Britain’s
R.A.F. will man them.
ADMIRALTY TO TEST
UNDERWATER T.V.
Underwater television at 1,000 ft.

New equipment which has been
developed by Pye Ltd., of Cambridge,

image orthicon camera tube as used
by the 8.8. C. and the whole camera
will be enclosed in a steel watertight
casing complete with lighting and
able to withstand pressure up to 1,200
lb. per square inch.
In favourable conditions a forward
range of about 30 ft. is allowed for
at a depth of 1,000 ft. While a
standard camera will be employed cer'
tain modifications have been necessary
in order to obtain remote control of
focus, lens, turret and aperture. A
stabilising fin is fitted to the casing
for greater steadiness in bad tidal con'
ditions.

ago that the Admiralty successfully
located the lost submarine “Affray”
with hastily improvised equipment at
a depth of 288 feet.

THE MANSARD ROOF HAS CHARM.
That the Mansard roof possesses a charm of its own is very obvious to visitors to the Continent when in Paris.
In the Netherlands and in Britain itself this type of design is utilised extensively. In these house hungry years
with high building costs it has advantages for it provides bedroom accommodaton in the roof space on the same
lines as the steep-pitched attic type house, but by virtue of its special style provides rooms of a much larger
floor space than is possible with the attic type. The lower right is an attractive Mansard type cottage. Above,

SISKOL STONE-SAWING
MACHINERY.
New French Invention.
Demonstration at British Quarry.
A recent demonstration of stone'
sawing in the Weldon Stone Quarry,
Corby, England, showed a new type
of machine invented by a Frenchman
and now in use in the rebuilding of
destroyed areas in Normandy.
The sawing machinery is made in
a number of sizes and driven by elec-
tricty, compressed air or petrol-engine,
but always the complete plant is self-
contained, the saw and the power-unit
being in one.
The cutting principle is by claws,
or cock-spurs, set on links of a chain
of the bicycle-chain type. Claws are
set on alternate links. The claws, or
spurs, are made in Tungsten Alloy
and are sharpenable many times over
and are replaceable by an easy re-
placement of the link.
The chain is supported by a light
stretcher with ball-bearing sprocket-
wheels at each end. At the “Top”
end of the stretcher is the motor and
at the “Bottom” end of the stretcher
is a pair of whels; but both ends are
provided with handles and thf
machine is easily portable by two
men.
The effective cutting length of the
“saw” at the demonstration was about
five feet and the motor on the saw
was a two-stroke petrol engine. The
saw can be operated horizontally or
vertically or at any angle and can cut
the living rock on a quarry face.
The Weldon Stone is a shelly
oolitic limestone of the Upper Oolitic
Scries of the Jurassic System.
The demonstration commenced
with a normal saw-cut through a
large block of Weldon Stone. There
was no hitch and the saw went
through the block easily, smoothly
and rapidly, leaving a pile of stone-
dust under one end. The action was
astonishing, particularly in view of
the easy and casual way in which the
two Frenchmen carried and held the
saw in position.
The demonstrators then gave a
more dramatic exhibition. A piece
of stone about sft. long by about 3ft.
deep and some 3ft. broad was brought
up on a truck and sawn lengthways
into strips; each “slice” being per-
formed in 50 seconds.
The machinery, according to size,
costs from £5O to £4OO, and if the
life of the spurs is anything like what
it would appear to be and is claimed
it should revolutionise the cost of
cutting and masoning stone.

TRAVELLING CRANE BUILDS
A DAM.
Whitney Dam, on the Brazos River, in
Texas, U.S.A., is designed for both flood
control and for power generation. A revolv-
ing gantry crane with a 120 ft. boom travels
along a construction trestle to place concrete
in the dam. Concrete buckets holding 4 cub.
yds. are transported on a special trailer unit
drawn by a Tournapull engine unit. This
is seen at the right. The mixing plant sup-
plies 180 cubic yards per hour.

THATCH OR FLAT.
It is perhaps no exaggeration to state that the roof is the most important aspect of the design of a house in respect
of its external appearance and character. Take these four examples. Top left with its flat roof and square open-
ings is a product of machine age, devoid of sentiment and romanticism; bottom left is not dissimilar, though
the hard line of the flat roof has been somewhat softened by introducing a very slight pitch. It has a redeeming
terrace to add interest to the plan. When one contemplates the bottom right one’s mind goes to the English
scene with the thatched cottage and the thick thatch gracefully flowing over the upper windows. Top right may
be said to be in between and would probably be called a “bungalow”, but in each case it is the type and slope
of the roof that plays such an important part in the design of the house.
