Immediate Delivery... Faster Wall and Ceiling
Construction with GYPROCK PLASTER WALLBOARD
Gyprock is a new development in beauti-
fully smooth walls and ceilings. A plaster
wallboard, it’s cpiicker and cleaner than
other types of plaster construction. Avail-
able in 10 sheet sizes (6, 7,8, 9 and 10
feet lengths by 4 and 3 feet widths), it’s
very quickly handled—saves building time
and costs.
There are two types of Gyprock Plaster Wallboard.
RECESSED EDGE. No join, no line, no
nails can be seen with Recessed Edge
Gyprock joint treatment. It gives you a
beautifully smooth, seamless wall and
ceiling surface ideal for papering or
painting.
SQUARE EDGE. The standard “square
edge”” board is also obtainable in all sizes.
The rock-like qualities of Gyprock are un-
affected by temperature changes. Its mineral
core is resistant to borers and does not
attract vermin.

GRINNELL PROTECTION IS
FOR THEM AS
WELL AS YOU...

m
&
You may say you’ve taken every precaution
against ordinary fire hazards. That you can
depend upon ‘fireproof’ construction.
Aren’t you over-confident? Human negli;
gence in one way or another continues to
be the greatest cause of fire. So-called ‘fire-
proof’ buildings continue to become furnaces'
for inflammable contents.
What most people ignore is that, regard-
less of the cause of fire, regardless of the
building construction, it is the proper control
of fire from the first spark that constitutes
full and adequate protection against fire .
Grinnell is on guard 24 hours a day. It
kills fire, automatically, at its source.
You’re paying for Grinnell Protection
even if you haven’t got it. Insurance com-
panies allow a rebate of up to 50% on Fire
and Loss of Profits premiums where buildings
are Grinnell protected.
Wormald Brothers’ long-experienced
engineers will help you plan fire protection
for your specific risk.

GOTHIC DIGNITY AND CHARM
THE PARISH CHURCH.
ST. PETER’S CHURCH, NORTH SYDNEY.
As in all other aspects of architecture great changes are beginning to take
place in the realms of ecclesiastical design and the modern style is beginning
to make its presence felt in numbers of new Churches, particularly in Amer-
ica. While it is realised that the delightful little Church that we illustrate has
followed the tradition of the English Parish Church, and is the product of
days gone by in both style and craftsmanship, there is no denying that it
possesses a serenity and dignity that is peculiarly in keeping with its sacred
purpose. Each age is called upon to make its contribution and as such has
its place in the cavalcade of human development, consequently the tendency
in some quarters to ridicule all that has gone before is as foolish as it is
illogical. In the subsequent pages we illustrate some new Churches in the
modern style and also some erected in Australia over the last twenty years.

THE SOARING SPIRE
ST. MICHAEL’S, VAUCLUSE, SYDNEY.
This charming Church on a fine site at Vaucluse, with its delicate
soaring spire is visible from many points around the Harbour. The
Church was awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal for 1933. The
Architect was Professor Leslie Wilkinson.
Man and Nature seem to be vying with each other as both spire
and poplar reach gracefully to the sky.


THE CHURCH GOES MODERN
RECENT EXAMPLES FROM AMERICA AND THE
CONTINENT.
A CONTRAST IN FORMS.
The simplicity of the basic forms utilised in
the interior of the First Baptist Church, Long
Branch, California, are arresting. Above is
the sinuous sweep of the staircase rising from
the spacious foyer with the curved enclosed
balcony without a balustrade to the first floor
in the foreground. Below the grille-like treat-
ment behind the rostrum is in a way remin-
iscent of the large pipes of an organ. There
is little in the nature of ecclesiastical charac-
ter as generally understood. the sign
of the cross, it could just as easily be a
theatre or a council chamber.
TOWERS, SPIRES AND BELFRIES.
Variations of the theme for towers, spires and belfries are infinite, as emphasised by these re-
cent examples from America. The example on the left is a slender simple fleche-like spire
perched upon the apex of an isolated trefoil-on-plan monolith separated from the chapel, to dis-
tinguish its special purpose. The middle tower is a modem interpretation of the Renaissance
campanile with the cross prominently displayed. On the right, a simple brick pier bears
the bells that call the inmates of a Convent to prayer.
NEW DUTCH CHURCH.
This new Church was recently completed at Amstelveen, near Amsterdam. The Church com-
mittee advised its architect “that every effort should be made to bring the Church closer, in
a modern and progressive manner, to the community." Instead of walls of glass" as great
Gothic windows were called, we see small square holes worked into a patern over the
walls. The canopy over the pulpit acts as a sounding board though it looks exactly like a
springboard to our eyes.

NEW AMERICAN LUTHERAN
CHURCH.
This new Trinity Lutheran church, built at
Rapid City, South Dakota, follows very much
the traditional style and concedes little to the
modern movement that is finding favour in
some other denominations. It seats 500 and
uses the basement for Sunday School, choir,
etc. Exposed laminated wood arches support
the roof.

We illustrate a few examples. (Top left) New Church in the Netherlands (Bottom left)

chusetts. (Bottom right) Presbyterian Church, Cottage Grove, Oregon.
UNUSUAL CHURCH DESIGN.
Model for a new “modern” type Church to
be erected in America. Were it not for a
cross perched high on top of the tower at the
rear (see also centre illustration on opp. page)
one could be pardoned for thinking that it was
a generating station, a theatre, picture show or
public hall for it possesses nothing of an
ecclesiastical character—as expressed in former
religious edifices in any way. It is to be
called the Resurrection Church and is to be
built at St. Louis.
—“The Architectural Record," U.S.A.
NEW SWISS CHURCH.
Although this new church in Zurich differs
from the traditional Swiss protype, in that it
is octagonal in shape, the detached campanile
with its large clock-face is in keeping with
the older edifices. The upper view gives a
general view of the group, while the two
other views show the interior from different
viewpoints. The organ pipes are used for
wall decoration on the right of the central
picture, whilst the cross, tall, severe, but im-
pressive, is not centrally placed on its wall,
which is quite a departure.

THE CHURCH CROSS.
In this modern age ecclesiastical design has
undergone many drastic changes and no longer
can one recognise a religious edifice by its
Gothic or Renaissance style. Extreme sim-
POST-WAR SWISS CHURCH.
The only church on Swiss soil which fell a
victim to the war was a protestant church at
the town of Schaffhausen-on-Rhine, which was
practically surrounded by German territory.
It was bombed in error. The reconstruction
of this church has given rise to fresh argu-
ments among protestant circles in Switzerland
as to the building style which it would be
proper to adopt for a modern church of the
reformed faith. One school of thought advo-
cates the uncompromising continuation of the
reformed principle of utter sobrietay in church
building. This rebuilt church is a com-
promise between this and the other school of
thought that is prepared to make concessions
to the taste that desires a certain ornamental
symbolism.
—“Building Digest,” Britain.
BRICK AND REDWOOD.
Brick and redwood are the basic materials of
the Oneonta Congregational Church, South
Pasadena, of which we illustrate a corner of
the Sanctuary. Decorative plaster work fea-
turing a small quarter foil motif forms the
background to the altar. The ceiling is of
natural redwood.
—“The Architectural Record,” U.S.A.
plicity, unusual forms and all sorts of ex-
perimental ideas are being tried as this series
of illustrations bear out. One feature, how-
ever, remains unchanged—the Cross. The top
interior is a Presbyterian Church at Cottage

THE MODERN ECCLESIASTICAL
STYLE.
All evidence of the traditional attributes to
the ecclesiastical style of building has been
strenuously eliminated from this modern
Church. The stained glass windows are re-
placed by plain panels. The reveals of
carved and sculptured Gothic beauty departs
in exchange for a plain black background
studded at intervals, while even the stairs to
the pulpit perched, like a crows nest, on the
top of a single central support, are of the
riserless open type. The cross, though exten-
uated is to proclaim the purpose of the build-
ing.
AMERICAN CHURCHES.
Some American denominations are adopting
the modem style for their new buildings.
These two examples which bear no relation
to the Gothic, still have a character of their
own. The top example. Trinity Lutheran
Church at La Crosse. Wisconsin, is reminis-
cent of the Scandinavian style, and the Lower,
the First Free Methodist Church, East Liver-
pool, Ohio, has deserted brick and stone ex-
pressions as though inspired by asbestos-panel
temporary styles. Nevertheless the cross still
stands to proclaim the nature or purpose of
the structure.

THE CHURCH AROUND THE WORLD
ITS ENORMOUS POWER FOR GOOD.
It is often said that the twentieth
century is an irreligious age, particu'
larly at the present time. This hard'
ly seems to be borne out by the great
church-building activity which seems
to be a feature of most countries.
Only complete prohibition of the
use of materials for purposes other
than the building of homes in Australia
has prevented the Church here from
engaging in building activities and
going ahead as they have done in
other lands.
Far from this age being irreligious,
statistics show an ever-increasing num-
ber in almost all faiths. The field of
activity the Churches cover is as start-
ling as are the reforms in the modern
church buildings shown in this issue.
Churches concern themselves with
international affairs. They make
church buildings being erected in
Damascus or Jerusalem, whether for
Jews or Arabs, and throughout the
whole world, as much their concern
as church buildings erected in their
own cities, though they may never
have seen the places. They embrace
such subjects as revolutionary eras in
Asia, the suppression of Communism,
the care of the sick and lowly, moral
rearmament or human rights, and will
take anything from swimming classes
to atomic bombs in their stride.
Some of the churches are still ter'
ribly narrow in their views and will
go so far as to express resentment
about the recent marriage of a British
politician, which, being perfectly
honourable, had nothing to do with
them. Such interference with a man’s
private life is an impertinence and is
resented by many faithful adherents to
the Church.
In Metropolitan London there are
600 or 700 Parish and District
Churches belonging to the Church of
England.
Taking a few statistics from the
1949 American Year Book which
chances to be at hand, as an example
as to the adherents of the different
churches, we see that in America —
There are 672,000 Seventh Day
A,dventists;
1,610,000 Northern Baptists with
7,124 Churches:
The children attending the Southern
Baptist Sunday Schools number
4,004,705;
There are 5,716 Congregational
Christian Church buildings with a
membership of 1,184,661;
Protestant Episcopal Churches
(which are to America what the
Church of England is to England)
have 56,641 teachers;
Evangelical and Reform Church
members number 718,635;
Evangelical United Brethren have
4,516 churches and a membership
of 823,893:

In 1951 there were 15,533 Roman
Catholic Churches in the U.S.A.
Statistics about Australian churches
were not easy to obtain, even from
Church headquarters. We were told
that in the Diocese of Sydney, which
extends for roughly 10,000 square
miles, bounded by the Hawkesbury
River, Wallarawang, Sutton Forest and
Milton, there are 200 parishes and a
number of these have two, three or
even four churches in one parish ac'
cording to the density of the popula'
tion and the size of the Parish. More
than a quarter of the Anglican popula'
tion of Australia reside in the Diocese
of Sydney.
From Melbourne we learnt that they
had more Churches of Christ than
any city in the world, though the num'
ber was not stated.
The Church of Christ Scientist re'
cord ten churches in Victoria to their
credit and 19 in New South Wales.
This latter Church has approximately
3,030 branches located throughout the
world. 112 colleges and a university
have been established by this faith in
the 75 years since its foundation.
In America there are 20 major
Protestant denominations, quite apart
from the countless other faiths and
sects, all of which would disprove the
assertion that the world is far from
being irreligious. Yet all their com'
bined thought, the admirable activity
of millions of people would not bring
forth as much publicity in the Press
throughout the world as 200,000
people going to Helsinki to see the
sports, is capable of doing.
Nevertheless, the power for good
that the Church has exerted is breath'
taking. The granting of welfare aid
to 2,500,000 migrant workers and
families in U.S.A. is no small order.
In fha country there are 1,600
Y.M.C.A’s costing £60,000,000 a year
to administer. They have 3,500,000
members. Though high building costs
have recently delayed their building
activity, their properties in 1946 were
valued at £110,000,000.
The Y.W.C.A. has a membership of
3,000,000.
The Salvation Army world corps
and outposts number 17,329. They
provided in 1948 22,000,000 meals
for the hungry and 9,000,000 people
with beds. Their homes and hostels
open wherever they can do the most
good, often without payment from the
beneficiaries where payment cannot be
afforded, though one is expected to
give a little service in return if healthy
enough to do so.
Thus it will be seen that the Church,
apart from being the place for worship
alone, transcends all other influences
for good. It has spread its activities,
as in an open field, all over the world.
They cannot fail to be the greatest
power for uplift as long as clean think'
ing for the country’s moral develop'
ment, good manners and kindness
from one to another, and faith and
hope for the future is exercised.

CHURCH DESIGN
NEW BOOK REVIEWED.
“Church Design,” by Alan G.
Fudge, A.R.1.8.A. 50 pp. The
Epworth Press, London. (Eng'
lish price, 4/'.)
That changes in the design and
construction of religious buildings are
taking place is very evident from a
study of contemporary work in this
field—some of which is illustrated in
this special Church issue. It was in'
teresting, therefore, when this issue
was being prepared, to receive for
review a copy of this small brochure,
which, according to the jacket, “is
offered as a handbook for the use of
church building committees when
drawing up their programmes of re'
quirements, and of architects in pre'
paring sketch plans.”
The Author in his initial chapter
points out that religious symbolism is
quite as susceptible of change and de*
cay as every other medium of human
expression. Further, that a symbol has
two aspects: not only must it be ap'
propriate to the abstract truth it is
intended to express, but it is equally
essential that it should be rooted in
contemporary thought and experience.
The distinctive religious character
must, of course, grow out of Christian
theology; therefore it is unlikely that
a solution will be found by someone
evolving a brilliant design that would
serve as a type for future church
buildings, however valuable even one
flash of inspiration might be in in'
fluencing development. To some ex'
tent the new church architecture will
be inspired directly by theological com
ceptions, but it will derive much more
from the means adopted to express
those conceptions, namely, religious
symbolism
The Author considers that the
aesthetic significance of modern
changes in materials and structure is
insufficiently understood, even among
architects. In Britain, at any rate, he
says, those who have a real feeling for
the structural frame—now the domh
nant principle in the construction of
buildings—would still be a minority.
When the walls enclosing and sub'
dividing a building had also to carry
the weight of roof, floors, occupants

nearer the truth; heavy walls and
partitions are wasteful in space and in
the unnecessary loads the structural
framework is called upon to bear.
In his final analysis the Author
makes the telling simile that a place of
worship should be treated as a spiritual
instrument in the same sense as an
organ is a musical one, and the build-
ing should have something vital to
say.
The subject is dealt with in the text
under the following headings:—Archi-
tectural Approach; Planning for Wor-
ship; Planning for Age Groups; Plan-
ning for Recreation; Planning Against
Noise, and Planning for Good Acous-
tics.

mative little book.

mous with poor building. With

AND NOW ATOMIC HEATING!
Britain Installs First System.
Britain now has the first atomic
central heating plant in the world.
It is at the Ministry of Supply Atomic
Research Establishment, Harwell,
where a building containing 80 offices
will draw its heat direct from BEPO,
the large experimental atom pile.
Tests, which started with the new
installation recently, have been com-
pletely successful. Eventually two, and
perhaps three, more buildings will also
have “atomic radiators” and the
Ministry’s coal consumption will be
cut by at least a thousand tons a year.
After counting all incidental expenses.
the saving in cash is estimated at
£2650 a year. Costs of the installa-
tion amount to £15,000.
The constant hot water which will
flow through the pipes is obtained by
placing a heat exchanger, measuring
10ft. x 10ft. x 2ft. 6in. and weighing
eight tons, in the outlet air duct of
the pile’s air cooling system. Here
there is a by-pass fitted with a damper
which can be adjusted to vary the pro-
portion of the air flow passing through
the heat exchanger. Hot w'ater from
the exchanger is then circulated in a
closed circuit by a small pump to a
secondary water -to - water heat ex-
changer. This supplies hot water for
space heating and domestic hot water
supplies.
At present the air temperature at the
primary heat exchanger is 135 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the water itself is
heated to 130 degrees. This year,
when modifications to the pile have
been completed, these temperatures
will be substantially increased.
There is no danger from radio-
activity and the water can safely be
used for washing.
The heat output designed for the
first building is one million British
Thermal Units per hour, equal to
about 20 Oelectric fires, but for the
final installation the maximum output
will be seven million B.T.U. per hour.
The total floor area now being heated
is 32,000 sq. ft. and the volume of
space is 330,000 cu. ft.
The installation was carried out by
the Ministry of Works in collabora-
tion with the Engineering Division,

The Master Builders’ Federation of Australia
1890-1952: SIXTY-TWO YEARS OF OUTSTANDING SERVICE.
The Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia, which is the oldest employ-
ers’ federation in the Commonwealth,
was founded at Sydney on November
19, 1890, under the title: The Feder-
ated Master Builders’ Association of
Australasia.
There were present 15 representa-
tives of N.S.W., seven Victorians, and
six Queenslanders.
The President of the Sydney As-
sociation, Mr. Peter Dow, was elected
Chairman, and the chief work of the
Convention was the drawing up of the
Constitution.
“Conditions of Contract” came in
for a great deal of attention, and “As-
surance of Workmen,” “Employers’
Liability.” and the “Lien Law” were
also discussed. The proceedings closed
with the election of the first officials.
They were: President, Mr. R. L.
Brown (Melbourne); Vice-President,
Mr. P. Dow (Sydney); Secretary:
Mr. C. W. Miles (Melbourne); Treas-
urer, Mr. David Mitchell (Mel-
bourne), the father of the famous
Madame Melba.
Other important Conferences fol-
lowed: Melbourne, October, 1891;
Brisbane, October, 1892; Ballarat,
October, 1894: Sydney, April, 1898;
Melbourne, October, 1900; Sydney,
April, 1902: Brisbane, June, 1904,
and Melbourne, October. 1906.
Since then a further 36 conferences
have been held in various cities of the
Commonwealth, and the forthcoming
Convention, next month at Perth, will
bring the grand total to 46 in all.
Strenuous Fight.
Questions affecting the relationship
of the builder to the public, the ar-
chitect, and the workman have been
considered at these Conferences over
and over again.
As a body representing some thous-
ands of Master Builders, the Federa-
tion is in a position to speak with
full authority and firsthand knowledge
on current problems.

Few of the younger generation of
builders can realise how strenuous was
the fight of a former generation to
gain and maintain the conditions
which they now enjoy, and how neces'
sary it is for them to preserve a high
ideal of the dignity of the Building
Craft, as well as to keep open the gate
of opportunity for those who will
follow them in the calling of a Mast'
er Builder.
Many Difficulties.
The difficulties under which the
old'time builders had to carry on their
business cannot possibly be visualised
at this distance.
Perhaps the most historical docu'
ment in existence today which refers
to these difficulties was a paper read
by Mr. H. j. Thompson at the Tenth
PROPOSED ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AT MULYANDRY, N.S.W.
The projected new Church for Mulyandry, a small settlement about twenty-five miles from
Coolagong, has been designed by Architect L. P. Burns, with timber-framed walls and corru-
gated fibre cement roof in a simple Colonial character. It consists mainly of a porch externally,
nave and sanctuary, with two sacristies, one of which is to be used as living accommodation
for the priest, who will, from time to time, have to stay overnight. The Church has seating
accommodation for approximately 120, and will be finished internally with hardboard lining
to both walls and ceiling, suitably finished in pastel colours.

Interstate Convention at Sydney on
October 19, 1909,
Mr. Thompson, who was at that
time the President of the M.B.A. of
N.S.W., introduced, for the first time
on record, the question of Registration
of Builders.
Briefly put, Mr. Thompson proved
conclusively that the builders’ difficuh
ties arose largely from the fact that
the highly specialised and intelligent
labour he employed “is regulated by
industrial laws which largely ignore
the economic law of competition urn
der which he has to win work.”
Notable Convention.
The Fourteenth Convention, held
at Brisbane on April, 1915, was not'
able in the annals of Australian build'
ing for three reasons:
• The Federation had existed for
25 years, and was the oldest federation
of employers in Australia.
• Mr. A. Midson, a foundation
member, who had rendered long and
valuable service to the Federation as
Hon. Secretary and President, receiw
ed a cordial welcome from his fellow
delegates from other States.
• After discussion it was decided
by the conference that, owing to a
variety of causes, an effort should be
made to revise the Constitution of the
Federation in the direction of clothing
it with executive powers.
Much Achieved.
During its first 25 years of existence,
the Federation had achieved much.
The first eight years were occupied
with matters closely affecting the
building industry, and in 1898 it was
found that wider and more public in'
terests were demanding attention.
Tentative political experiments in
State Socialism were being essayed,
and these experiments were freely
criticised.
From 1898 onward, the subject of
“day labour” or State employment has
received a great deal of attention from
the delegates to State conferences,
with many apparent results.
Aftermath of World War I.
Time marched on, and World War
1., which finished in 1918, left its after'
math heavily on the work of the Fed'
eration.
The high cost of building, the
housing shortage, contracts and in'
creased costs, vocational training, a
builders’ parliament, continuity of em'
ployment, and a weekly wage all mark'
ed the pressure of heavy industrial
weather on the Federation Executive.
A no'Saturday work or a 40'hour
movement had run like an epidemic

walls and a tiled roof. Internally the walls are finished in cement render with an ornamented
wood ceiling and a laminated roof truss. The main accommodation in the Church consists of
a narthex, nave and sanctuary, with a Nuns’ chapel and two sacristies. Work has already com-

SYDNEY CHEVRA KADISHA
NEW JEWISH FUNERAL PREMISES.
The new Sydney Chevra Kadisha
has been erected for the Jewish Holy
Brotherhood, whose care is the burial
of their brethren. It replaces old and
inadequate funeral parlours at Red-
fern.
The site is ideal for the purpose.
It is at the corner of Oxford and
Wallis Streets, Woollahra, and is in
the shape of an elongated triangle with
sides 180 ft. long and with a base line
of only 66ft. Wallis Street grades
down to about 6ft. below Oxford
Street at the base of the triangle.
To accommodate the various func-
tions of such a building required con-
siderable skill, and the architects,
Messrs. Lipson and Kaad, have handled
this with skill. The treatment of the
various masses, office and living sec-
tion, Chapel and Memorial Hall step-
ping down from the rear in both
height and width and culminating in
the entrance porch and foyer right
on the corner is most effective and
uses to great advantage an unusual
site.
This firm has always been well*
known for the fine detailing be it
modern or traditional of its work,
and in this project they have had a
unique opportunity. The style could
be called modern Romanesque, for
basic features of that rich style such
as the semi'drcular headed twin open-
ings have been freely used. The de-
tail is redolent of traditional Jewish
motifs.
The exterior of the building is in
texture brickwork with cast stone
trim.
The Plan.
The functions of the parlours are
planned in two sections. The adminis-
trative section, which is of four storeys,
comprising: Hearse Garage, Prepara-
tion Room and Laundry on the Lower
Ground Floor; General Office and
Board Room on the Ground Floor,
with resident officer’s flat on the first
and second floor.
The Chapel and Memorial Hall
section comprises: Lying-in Room,
Male and Female Watchers' Rooms,
Chair Store and Rabbi’s Change
Room on the Lower Ground Floor,
while Chapel, Memorial Hall, Foyer
(and a detached building for a special
sect) are placed on the Ground Floor
level.

bolism. We illustrate two doorways and a window.

IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENTS IN BRISBANE.
By F. O. NIXON.
Architects: A. H. Conrad and T. F. B. Gargett.
Builders: Stuart Bros, Pty. Ltd. (Brisbane).
Both Brisbane and Southport—so
miles away on the South Coast—are
noted for the excellence of their
Church of England Grammar Schools
for boys, and for girls, also. Half a
century ago, when Southport was a
mere village watering place, and its
gay and affluent offspring Surfers’
Paradise had not come into exis'
tence, the fine block of buildings now
known as the Southport School for
Boys was merely a vision, but born to
materialise as visions rarely do.
It was, however, taking shape at
the hands of the Rev. Horace Dixon,
M.A., whose dream it was literally
“at the hands” of this enthusiastic
young clergyman now 83, and a
bishop of 20 years’ activity devoted to
social welfare because, at the end of
last century, he was busy with a saw
and a hammer and some timber build'
intf the school which became the fore'
runner of the present pile of buildings
at the southern approach of the
Pacific Highway to Southport.
This school, Brisbane prototype, is
at Oaklands Parade, East Brisbane,
where it was born in 1917; and its ex'
tent of buildings and grounds can be
gauged from the requirements that its
roll of 800 day and boarding scholars
implies.
The first building of the Church of
England Grammar School on the Oak'
lands Parade, East Brisbane, site was
the main School House, erected in
1917 and extended in 1928, and with
modern kitchen improvements in 1948.
Disregarding temporary structures,
other permanent buildings were erect'
ed progressively as follows: Brick Class
Room, 1921; Chapel, 1923; Darnell
Library, 1933: Junior House, 1934;
St. Magnus Class Rooms, 1935; First
Section, Goodwin House, 1936;
Donaldson House, 1937; Science
Block, Original, 1938; Swimming Pool,
1948; Extensions to St. Magnus and
Science Block, including Basement,
1948.
At this stage, plans were developed
to cover the ultimate completion of
all Senior School Buildings; the prim
cipal buildings in this scheme are the
extension of St. Magnus to twenty
full'size Class Rooms and the erection
of an Assembly Hall.
The sketch plans of the scheme are
published herewith, from which it will
be noted St. Magnus is to be com'
pleted as a two- to three'Storey “L”-
shaped building with north or east
light to all Class Rooms, with Cloisters
on the south and west sides. Apart
from two Class Rooms at the north'
eastern corner, the lower ground floor
is given over to open shelter and
luncheon space, lavatories, etc.; Head'
master’s and Administration Offices
will be on the ground floor in the
centre of the east wing; the Masters’
Common Room will be on the first
floor above the Administration Offices.
All Class Rooms are 22ft. 6in. wide
by 25ft. deep, front to back, and
locker rooms .are spaced as shown.
Balconies are Bft. wide in the clear
with three staircases. Locker Rooms
will be interspersed between pairs of
Class Rooms; the plan is elastic,
readily permitting variation of size of
Class Rooms as may be required.
The Assembly Hall, to seat 700
boys, will be built where the old tirm
ber residence “Palmyra” now stands,
to form the southern arm of a quad'
rangle between the Hall and the two
wings of St. Magnus Class Rooms.
This development will concentrate
all Senior School Class Room activities,
including the four existing Science

possibly ursurp the principal function
of the Arbitration Courts, were among
other problems confronting the Fed-
eration.
However, at the 17th Convention,
held at Adelaide in 1920, apprentice-
ship and the Training of Workmen
were fully discussed, and the position
of the Federation fully defined as to its
future status.
Progress was also made with the
question of the re-organisation of the
Federation, and the deliberations and
decisions at that Convention remain in
force to the present day.
Sixty-Two Years Old.
The Federation will be 62 years of
age in November next, and after meet-
ing in Perth next month, it will have
established the proud dual record of
46 Inter-State Conventions, and of
being Australia’s oldest federation of
employers.
The history of the Federation since
its inception is one of outstanding
achievement in every field of indus-
trial endeavour, and much of the hu-
mane and sensible legislation it sug-
gested over more than half-a-century,
are on the Statute Books of the Com-
monwealth and several States.
The Federation which a handful of
Master Builder stalwarts started in
1890 in Sydney has grown remarkably
both in membership and in influence
over the years between, and its future
progress is safe in the hands of the
capable men who unselfishly put ser-
vice before self.
Laboratories, Library and Chapel at
the northern end of the grounds, as
distinct from the “House” activities,
which will remain at the southern end.
The Headmaster’s Residence, while
not within the School grounds, is
admirably placed centrally opposite the
School, permitting easy access and
ready supervision of the School ac-
tivities.
The future of the Prep, is under
consideration, and will probably de-
velop along one of two alternative
lines, viz:—
(a) To erect a self-contained Prep.
School with its Class Rooms
and House at the southern end
of the grounds at the corner
of Oaklands Parade and Mow-
bray Terrace, or
(b) To erect a new House for the
Senior Boarders on the sloping
ground between the present
Main House, Donaldson
House, and the “Flat,” and to
utilise the present Main House,
Gerald, Donaldson and Good-
win Houses for the Prep.
A question that is of profound in-
terest to educationists, and also to
parents, is the number of scholars—
particularly boarders—to whom the
staff of masters, particularly the head-
master, can do full justice. This kind
of education has reached the stage of
fees so high as to cause parents to
look for results comparable with the
monetary outlay. One of the results,
rightly regarded as of first importance,
is the development of character, and
the question arises as to what number
of boys of various ages a headmaster
is able to know thoroughly while he
is consciously and unconsciously im-
planting in each of his charges those
examples and precepts that mean so
much in the future life of impres-
sionable youth.
It is obvious that the number of
young people to whom a headmaster
can do justice has its limitations and
depends upon the natural, and well as
the cultivated, ability of this teacher
and his physical capacity to implement
it.
Naturally, opinions differ as to that
number, just as opinions differ as to
the capability of unimpaired head-
masters. Some opinions by the ex-
perienced are that 200 boys are the
limit, while there are economists ad-
vocating higher education for all.
This will further complicate the prob-
lem.
The lasting fame which some heads
of famous public schools in Great
Britain have achieved suggests that
both the potter and the clay were
good, though the limit of neither had
been exceeded.

Nice For Greenway!
Mr. Harry Seidler, winner of the
recent Sulman award for his “ultra”
home at Turramurra, in an interview
(6/8/52) in the “Sydney Morning
Herald” is reported as saying that
Francis Greenway—architect for St.
James Church and many of Sydney’s
old Colonial buildings—“did some
quite good things here.”
Praise indeed! One wonders whose
work will live longest—After 130 odd
years Greenway still calls forth admira-
tion.
THE CHEMICAL CONTENTS
OF MAN.
It has been estimated that if the
chemical elements composing an aver'
age human body were isolated and sold
at commercial prices they would be
worth only about five shillings.
According to a recent estimate by
Omnibook, New York, the body is
composed of two-thirds or more of
oxygen and hydrogen in the form of
water. The various elements compos-
ing the human body occur in the fol-
lowing percentages: Oxygen, 65;
carbon, 18; hydrogen, 10; nitrogen,
3; calcium, 1.5; phosphorus, 1; po-
tassium, 0.35: sulphur, 0.25; sodium,
0.15; chlorine, 0.15; magnesium,
0.05; iron, 0.004; and iodine,
0.00004. Besides these thirteen es-
sential elements, the normal body also
contains minute quantities of fluorine
and silicon, and perhaps manganese,
zinc, copper, aluminium and cobalt.
On this subject London “Punch”
wrote many years ago when values
differed:
More Mechanisation Means More Houses
Mechanisation is being increasingly applied to the building industry in Britain as this illus-
tration indicates. This 30ft. elevator has an hourly capacity of 2000 bricks, 4000 tiles or 1000
coke-breeze blocks and can be operated" effectively up to a three-storey roof.

SULMAN MEDAL AWARD
TO “ULTRA-MODERN” TYPE HOUSE.
The Sir John Sulman Medal for
1951 has been awarded to Harry
Seidler, for his house at Clissold St.,
Turramurra.
The Sulman Award is made annu-
ally for a building of exceptional
merit erected in New South Wales.
Buildings of various types compete
each year: for 1951 the selection was
made from those in the Domestic and
Residential Class. The Jury compris'
ed Architects A. E. Stafford, J. C.
Fowell, G. H. B. McDonell and N. A.
W. Ashton; National Art Gallery Di-
rector, Hal Missingham; painter
William Dobell, and sculptor G. F.
Lewers.
Mr. Seidler came to Australia five
years ago from New York. Born in
Vienna he began his architectural stud-
ies at Cambridge, took his Bachelor
of Architecture Degree at the Uni-
versity of Manitoba, Canada, subse-
quently studying at Harvard.
Mr. Scidler is amongst the younger
architects whose advanced ideas on
house design have more than once
brought them into conflict with local
building regulations and controls.

The Turramurra house, built by Mr.
Seidler for his parents, has aroused
wide-spread comment and controversy

both inside and outside the architect'
ural profession, for it makes a com'
plete break with the traditional in
Australian home design. In common
with many other contemporary houses
it has a flexible open plan, in which
living and sleeping portions are link'
ed by a central play area. On the
north side, an outdoor living terrace,
sheltered from westerly winds, hollows
the rectangular mass of the structure.
Integration of the house with its
typical Australian bush surroundings
is emphasised by the use of local
sandstone for retaining walls and the
chimney column which reaches up
from the ground through the living
area, leaving the natural stone expos'
ed inside.
Timber is used for walls and roof,
and the concrete floor is supported
on slender steel columns; there is
extensive use of glass on all sides.
Colour is provided in the kitchen bv
sliding cupboard doors of bright red,
vellow, and blue glass.
Mr. Seidler has expressed apprecia'
tion for the co'operation of his build'
er, Mr. Bret R. Lake, of Crows Nest,
Sydney. So unusual a house, he sa
demanded no small measure of skill
on the builder’s part in correctly in'
terpreting and fulfilling the require'
ments of the job.
The Story of the Sulman.
The Sulman Award for Architect'
ure represents the effort of one man
to improve the standard of building
design in New South Wales.
Sir John Sulman, an English archi'
tect and town planner, who came to
this country in 1885, was so appalled
by the defects he found in Australian
city planning that he at once began
a crusade for a more rational approach
to design. His paper on "The Lay'
ing Out of Towns” was followed, in
1907, by a series of articles on “The
Improvement of Sydney.” For many
years his books on town planning
were standard authorities. As Uni'
versity lecturer in Architecture, a
Trustee of the National Art Gallery
andactive member of various groups
concerned with art, architecture, and
planning, he lost no opportunity to
disseminate his ideas and put forward
his plea that more positive steps
should be taken by Australians in
these fields. (continued on p. 65)

Messrs. Fitzgerald, Deegan, Forbes,
Cottrell, Ritchie, and ]. Knight.
The President warmly welcomed the
visitors present and particularly Mr.
H. R. Mansfield, the Secretary of the
Newcastle Chapter, and Mr. E. L.
Crowley, an I.E.S. member from Vic'
toria.
Minutes of General Meeting held
on the 3rd July, 1952, were taken as
read and confirmed.
Membership.
The following report was presented
from Council in regard to member'
ship:—
Advancement from Associate to Full
Membership: W. A. Smith, O. U.

place of Mr. T. S. Crouch, who had
resigned.
Crown Crystal Glass Visits.
The President reported that the
visits to, the factory of Crown Crystal
Glass Pty. Ltd. on July 10th and 17th
had been an unqualified success. Ap'
proximately 140 members and their
guests availed themselves of the invita'
tion. The President expressed the
Society’s thanks to the management
for the help which they had extended
in making the necessary arrangements.
Next Meeting.
The President announced that the
next meeting would be a joint meeting
with the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects, N.S.W. Chapter.
Speaker: Walter R. B u n n i n g,
F.R.A.1.A., A.R.1.8.A.
Subject: “Dramatic Changes in Store
Design.”
Subject for the Evening:
The subject of the evening was
“Lighting Developments Overseas.” It
was discussed by three speakers,
Messrs. S. N. Jeffrey, W. A. Smith,
and P. J. Grundfest. Each speaker
contributed mainly in the fields with
which he was personally associated.
Mr. Jeffrey, dealt with new mate'
rials, new sources, street lighting, and
the lighting installation for the British
House of Commons. Mr .Smith dis'
cussed the lighting of schools, art gab
leries, stores and displays, and the
lighting of churches. He gave a coni'
prehensive account of the lighting of
the South Bank Exhibition. Mr.
Grundfest reported on lighting pro'
gress made, mainly in U.S.A. and
Continental countries, and described
lighting landmarks of five continents.
He concluded with a short survey
which he entitled “Where Do We
Stand?”
Discussion.
Mr. E. W. Williams emphasised the
need for continuity of progress and
gave a vivid account of some of his
many personal experiences in the light'
ing field. He drew attention to the
latest reports on the development of
luminous capacitor light sources. He
facetiously painted a picture of light'
ing engineers in aprons dispensing
light by the square yard and cutting
out light sources with scissors. Ho
hoped that wherever progress was
made in the technical field that the
commercial interests would follow these
technical developments with zeal, and
produce and distribute consistently
improved light sources and equipment.

DISPLAY BY CHANGING LIGHTS.
A New York office building attracts the at-
tention of the public by its changing coloured
light displays. Glass panels on the street
front extend up to three storeys in height and
behind these the sloping cellular display panel
sweeps down to the vestibule ceiling level of
15ft. 6in., this ceiling also being of similar
type with concealed lighting effects.
ERECTING ILLUMINATED CELLULAR
CEILING.
This ceiling under erection in a New York
office building extends up to a 37ft. height
behind the glazed front and on this are
worked changing displays of coloured lights.
Hexagonal aluminium cells 6in. by 6in. make
up the ceiling. On top they are closed by
panels of Plexiglas above which are placed
the banks of reflector light strips. A master
controller rings the changes in the lighting
displays.

1. NEW MATERIALS.
The last war accelerated develop'
ment of many materials required for
military purposes. Some of these have
been since adapted and used for in-
dustrial applications. One of these
materials which has now been given
the name Chrysaline has been found
to be ideally suited in the manufacture
of lamp shades and diffusing covers.
Its original use was for spraying
warships, guns, etc., which became
known as the “Moth Ball” process.
After extensive tests and experiments,
it was found that the material had a
diffusing property which compared
with white flashed opal glass and a
higher transmission factor.
The material in its initial form is a
rubber'acetone based liquid and is
sprayed on to a revolving wire frame,
on which it forms a web. After the
initial web has been allowed to harden
a thinner plastic is sprayed on which
becomes part of the original webbing
agent. When this has dried and con'
tracted, the resultant substance is both
waterproof and fireproof. The shades
and diffusers can be made to any shape
providing a wire frame can be made
to that shape.
Shapes that hitherto could not be
manufactured in the usual materials
such as vellum, silk and buchram,
can now be obtained.
An example of some of the designs
obtainable is shown.
A material which has been used ex'
tensively in Europe and America is
Polystyrene. Its principle use has been,
for louvres. It has been found an
ideal substitute for perspex where this
latter material has been in short sup'
ply. The material is pressed into
reeded pattern but has little diffusing
property which has limited its use for
covers. However, when used as a
louvre it gives more “sparkle” to an
installation than reeded perspex with'
out increasing brightness.
The world shortage of raw materials
has caused manufacturers in the light'
ing industry to seek other materials
for lighting units. A P.V.C. reflect'
or has been developed in England for
use in vapourproof and dustproof
fluorescent lighting fittings.
The reflector is of white opaque
material, light and flexible and diffi'
cult to break under strain or impact.
Reflection factor is claimed to be high
as that of best vitreous enamels. It
is recommended as an alternative in
all locations where the ambient tern'
perature does not exceed 100°F.
I feel sure that in view of the said
metal and perspex shortages we shall
find new materials being developed
for lighting fittings, for although we
know that some Government offices
have been using paper and string for
lighting fittings, for some years, it is
not a commercial proposition.
2. NEW LIGHT SOURCES.
A great deal of progress has been
made on new light sources particu'
larly mercury vapour lamps. It is fair-
ly well established that air cooled men
cury vapour lamps, mid way between
very compact sources and long tubu'

lar sources, compare in luminous effi'
ciency with normal fluorescent lamps.
Recent developments in America and
England, however, have been chiefly
in the short arc field. A lamp has
been developed in the very high watt'
age range having a current density in
the metal seals of 10,000 amperes per
sq. cm. This has led to seals in glass
or quartz carrying as much as 250
amperes generally through foliations
of molybdenum sealed in quartz.
These lamps have an arc brightness
intrinsically greater than the surface
of the sun. It is possible that these
lamps will supplement the carbon arc
in studio work.
Lamps have been produced in
America having Cadmium added in
varying proportions. It is claimed
that these mercury Cadmium lamps will
emit as much as 70% of the red con'
tent of daylight.
In England the 1 KW HPMV lamp
is being used for High Bay lighting
and is also being used for floodlight'
ing. This lamp has the approximate
size and shape of the 400 W HPMV
fluorescent but its efficiency is an av-
erage of 45 lumens per watt through'
out its life of 3000 hours. It requires
an arc voltage of 300 V and therefore
needs a 400/450V three phase sup-
ply. This has not, however, been
found to be a disadvantage as most
large industrial undertakings have this
supply available.
Developments in tubular fluorescent
lamps include the introduction of
coloured lamps apart from the exist-
ing range of whites. These tubes are
available in Red, Green and Blue and
although the efficiencies of the Red
and Blue are relatively low they are
still higher than the resultant efficiency
of a tungsten filament lamp and a
colour filter. Their application is
probably limited to stage work, a’-
though they are very effective for di='
play backgrounds.
One important development in in'
candescent lamps is the silaca coated
lamps which cover the 40W, 60W
and 100 W sizes. An ordinary Pearl
lamp is internally sprayed with a fine'
ly divided silica powder. This is ap'
plied by a process which ensures a
uniform coating. The silica is keyed
into the etchings produced by the
pearl process by firing over a gas jet.
This in no way impairs the perform'
ance of the lamps. The light absor-
tion is very low (only 5%) but the
diffusing quality high.
This development may well cause
changes in the design of fittings as
less diffusion will be required in the
actual material used.
It should encourage the use of light'
er and more attractive materials and
increase overall efficiency.
I have briefly discussed develop'
ments in the incandescent and gaseous
discharge range of illuminants but re'
search both in America and England
has been carried out on a third meth'
od of converting energy to light. This
is known as Electroluminescence and
the light source is known as the lunv
inous capacitor. Briefly, the construe'
tion consists of a coating of phosphor
suspended in a suitable dielectric
spread evenly over a conducting glass
and has a metallic backing. When an
alternating current is supplied across
the plates the phospors luminise as the
potential changes. Light output in-
creases as the voltage and frequency
are increased but there is a limiting
voltage at which the dielectric will
break down. In America these lumin'
escent condenser lamps have been used
for clock faces and switchplates but
is hoped that in the near future
developments will enable them to be
used for ceilings and wall features
where uniform low brightness source
would be desirable. Development in
England has been of late concentrat'
ed on metallic glass having a very
thin film of gold for use with this
new source.
3. STREET LIGHTING.
The principal developments in
street lighting have been caused by
the addition of fluorescent lamps to
this field. It would be impossible in
the limited time available to deal with
all the variety of designs of lanterns
in which they have been used. They
have been used in reflecting and re'
fracting optical systems although it
is interesting to notice the increasing
use of Plastics for refractors. These
can be machined more accurately than
glass can be pressed; thus obtaining
a more finite distribution. Designs of

lanterns for the fluorescent lamp have
included Pole top. Horizontal and an
inverted. “V” design to give a non
assymetric distribution of 160°.
Mercury discharge lamps have gen-
erally been used recently burning
horizontally using the 250/400W
lamps. New lanterns have been de-
signed using heat resisting glass re-
fractors.
With the cooler Sodium lamps, tot-
ally enclosed perspex lanterns are be-
ing used extensively.
There have been several new de-
signs of cut off lanterns for mounting
at longer spacings than at present re-
commended in the Code of Practise.
4. THE BRITISH HOUSE OF
COMMONS.
Probably one of the most discussed
lighting installations of the post-war
years is that in the new Chamber of
the House of Commons.
The decision was made to reintro-
duce the late Gothic style in harmony
with the rest of the palace of West-
minster, but the Architect, Sir Giles
Gilbert Scott, seized every opportun-
ity to introduce the most modern
methods for heating, lighting and
ventilation. Before final decisions re-
garding the lighting were made, ex-
tensive tests were carried out, after
which, it was realised, that the high
luminous efficiency, and flexibility of
colour of modern light sources would
fulfill the artistic ideas of the Archi-
tect.
Before discussing the lighting
problems, a brief description of the
Chamber would be desirable.
The seating arrangements are al-
most the same as in the previous
Chamber but they are increased from
802 to 939. English oak has been
used for the benches, roof and the
extensive panelling. Light colour
Clipsham stone has been used for the
windows and masonry in the gallery.
The benches are upholstered in green
and the carpets are brown-fawn colour
to match the woodwork. The middle
of the floor is carpeted in green.
The requirements were that there
should be no evidence of arrange-
ments for artificial lighting during
daylight, and when daylight waned,
the lighting should be so controlled
that its introduction would not dis-
tract a Member addressing the House.
The main lighting for the Cham-
ber comes from the ceiling and by us-
ing a carefully chosen glass the day-
light appearance of the 150 laylights
is similar to the oak wood surround-
ing them. Each of the panels has a
lighting unit above; consisting of one
spiral cold cathode tube in conjunc-
tion with two tubular tungsten lamps
controlled from a special dimmer cir-
cuit so that the lighting can be
brought up from zero to maximum
and vice versa without flickering.
Due to the cut off caused by the
galleries it was found necessary to sup-
plement the lighting underneath them
and a row of 2’, 20W hot cathode
lamps was employed again controlled
from a special dimmer circuit. They
were mounted behind perspex which
was coloured to match the oak sur-
rounds.
To obviate contrast between the
laylights and the surrounding ceiling
and to illuminate certain architectural
features 2-8’ 125 W fluorescent lamps
were located in each of the ten win-
dows. Thev were housed in specially
designed reflectors so that light would
be directed on that half of the roof
on the same side as the units, and
louvres were also fitted so that the
lamps could not be seen from the gal-
leries.
The average illumination in the
Chamber is 12-5: lumens per sq, ft.
The House of Commons is a par-
ticularly good example of what can
be achieved by early co-operation be-
tween the Architect and the Lighting
Engineer.
Part 2: LIGHTING OF SCHOOLS, ART GALLERIES, STORES AND
DISPLAYS, LIGHTING OF CHURCHES.—THE LIGHTING OF THE
SOUTH BANK EXHIBITION.
By W. A. SMITH
At the beginning of the war the
lighting industry set up at' the request
of the Ministry of Supply, an organ-
isation known as the National Indus-
trial Electric Lighting Service. All
commercial companies engaged in
lighting were members and the ob-
lect of the Service was to ensure that
the urgent lighting work should be
spread over the entire resources of
the industry and carried out speedily
without the necessity , for wasteful
competitive tendering. The Ministry
of Supplv and later the Ministry of
Aircraft Production employed a num-
ber of lighting inspectors whose func-
tion was to visit factories engaged on
war contracts and to report on the de-
sirability or otherwise of re-lighting
the plants, bearing in mind that fac-
tones in Britain were working twenty'
hours a day. If redighting was re'
commended a request was made to
the NIELS, and one of the Compan-
ies on the rotor attended to the matter.
Scheme and quotation were submitted
to the Ministry and if approved the
work was put in hand and the Minis-
try concerned made a grant towards
the cost.
Besides the redighting of existing
plants the NIELS organisation was
also responsible for the lighting of new
war plants.
During the war years, therefore,
there was a tremendous amount of in-
dustrial lighting carried out, and as
the developments of new weapons
meant in many cases the development
of new manufacturing techniques, new
lighting problems arose and had to be
solved. By the end of the war we
had gained a great deal of knowledge
concerning the requirements of indus'
trial lighting and most of our plants
were well lighted in accordance with
the standards of the day. Industrial
lighting was, in fact, the only form of

lighting with which we were concern-
ed during those years and it was nat-
ural that as the fluorescent lamp had
been produced in England as a com-
mercial proposition just prior to the
war its use in factories was widespread,
hence besides learning more about in-
dustrial lighting we also learned how
to use this new light source.
At the end of the war the fluores-
cent lamp became available for gen-
eral use and the lighting industry
and the research organisations were
able to turn their minds to problems
unconnected with industry. Of these
problems the one of greatest import-
ance was that of school lighting. A
number of factors made this urgent;
the destruction of many schools
through enemy action, the legislation
which restricted the number of pupils
in each class, the raising of the
school leaving age by one year, all
meant that school building had to be
given a high priority. Artificial light-
ing was one of the many facets of
the problem which engaged the at-
tention of the Building Research Sta-
tion and much of the fundamental
knowledge which was gained as re-
gards illumination levels, brightness.
visual requirements and the funda-
mentals of fittings design as applied
to schools, was the result of the work
of Dr. Hopkinson and his colleagues
at the BRS. Much of their work was
incorporated in a code of practice for
school lighting.
Another problem which engaged the
attention of the B.R.S. was the light-
ing of art galleries. The National
Gallery and some of the Provincial
galleries had been damaged and some
of the rooms in them had to be en-
tirely re-built. The problem was to
devise a means of designing a gallery
which could be adequately lighted by
natural light and artificial light in such
a way that at all times pictures could
be viewed comfortably and colour
values rendered accurately under both
daylight and artificial light. The tech-
nique worked out was most interesting
and admirably fulfilled its function.
The problem with gallery lighting is
ensure that from the paintings them-
selves a full view of the sky is avail-
able through the skylight whilst from
all other points of view the sky view
is restricted, secondly, any view of
the sky from the observer’s point of
view must be prevented. A system of
louvres and an artificial ceiling pro-
vided the correct daylight conditions
whilst the artificial lighting system fol-
lowed from an understanding of the
daylight problem.
A fluorescent system was achieved
which gave lighting conditions simil-
ar in respect to colour and general
quality as daylight, hence it was pos-
sible to mix the two without colour
distortion when daylight conditions de-
manded an increase in levels. An
outcome of the rebuilding was that
the rooms became suitable for air
conditioning and the consequent pos-
sibility of hanging paintings without
glass covers considerably helped the
lighting problem.
I would mention at this stage the
close collaboration which exists be-
tween the lighting industry and the
Building Research Station; the In-
dustry has benefitted enormously from
hte influence of Dr. Hopkinson and
Mr. W. Allen, physicist and architect
of the station. They have gained the
respect of the lighting world by their
sympathetic understanding of the
commercial problems of the industry
and have been pleased to come out of
their laboratories and to collaborate
with the practicing engineers in their
day-to-day work. The station has also
had a considerable influence on con-
temporary fittings design, and many
of the well-designed fittings at pres-
ent available in Britain are the result
of designing to the visual require-
ments as propounded by Hopkinson
and following the constructive criticism
of members of the Station.
As regards fittings, whereas it was
rare five years ago for a manufacturer
to employ an industrial designer, now
most companies have on the staffs
qualified designers who work in close
collaboration with the engineers. The
result is that fittings are well designed
as far as their optical and engineering
properties are concerned and at the
same time have considerable artistic
merit. Fittings design has evolved al-
ways in terms of the shielded source,
much use has been made of Perspex
for complete diffusing covers, although
during the past year or two louvred
fittings have been produced. Exposed
tube installations are rarely made.
Lighting practice has developed
along rather interesting lines, the early
enthusiasm for all fluorescent installa-
tions has given way to the realisation
that the incandescent lamp has still an
important part to play in lighting
technique. The lighting of the Festi-
val Concert Hall which is the most im-
portant permanent building of the
post-war period indicates the general
trend of contemporary lighting prac-
tice. Cold cathode lighting was used
VERTICAL FLUORESCENT TUBES.
The use of vertical fluorescent tubes is often more appropriate than the conventional horizontal
system. This illustrates an attractive installation in the auditorium of a theatre. The fluorescent
lamps are wired to a damming circuit.
SCHOOL LIGHTING.
For school lighting nerspex diffusers are used, the reflectors having a 45 deg. cut-off.

I in the Auditorium from a series of
indirect ceiling coves. For decorative
purposes only general lighting being
from flush incandescent units, whilst in
the foyers an indirect lighting using
hot cathode lamps is combined with a
direct louvred incandescent system.
This gives a certain amount of sparkle
f to the interior which could not have
i been achieved by fluorescent alone.
This realisation that fluorescent
I lighting is not the answer to every
lighting problem and the desirability
[ of using any light source available to
achieve a desired effect is also appar'
ent in store lighting where we have
come to the conclusion that high in'
tensity lighting is not sufficient and
that even with intensity and brightness
grading there is an air of monotony
which is undesirable. The general
tendency is to use fluorescent lighting
to provide a comfortable general level
and then to make considerable use of
spot lights to feature various parts of
the store. Colour is also prominently
used by display men to provide in'
triguing backgrounds for special dis'
plays, the use of coloured fluorescent
lamps making the use of coloured
lighting an economic proposition. The
recent introduction of the hot cathode
fluorescent lamp dimming technique
has also been of considerable assist'
ance in display lighting, it is possible
by using red, green and blue tubes to
obtain any colour of light by merely
altering the setting of the dimmers as'
sociated with each lamp; the system
has been widely used at fashion dis'
plays where the colour of the back'
ground can be altered speedily to suit
the dress or costume on show.
Complete fluorescent installations
have, however, been made in buildings
which at first sight might be consid'
ered to be unsuitable. The rebuilt
House of Commons which was entire'
ly lighted by fluorescent lamps, was
described by Mr. Jeffries. Soon after
the Chamber was occupied a member
asked the Minister of Works whether
he was convinced that it was pleasant
to sit under the beastly fluorescent
lighting and would not something in
the nature of chandeliers be much
more easy on the eye.
Interesting experimental installations
of fluorescent lamps have been made
in some of our Gothic Cathedrals and
there has been much controversy as
to the desirability of this form of
lighting in buildings which were creat'
ed in the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Cem
tury. In Beverly Minster in Yorkshire
five foot tubes have been very clev'
erly concealed between the shafts of
the columns of the Nave, all the tubes
are on the altar side of the columns
so that from the point of view of the
congregation no light sources are vis'
ible. A recent installation in St. Cob
man’s Cathedral in Ireland has groups
of vertical tubes mounted at a height
of twenty'five feet along the side of
the nave on the main pillars. In
contrast, Canterbury Cathedral has
recently been relighted using the con'
cealed incandescent flood ' lighting
technique which was developed so
successfully during the Nineteen
Thirtys and applied with such aston'
ishing beauty to Norman and Gothic
architecture. Whether there is any
virtue in applying direct fluorescent
lighting to such buildings is a matter
of opinion, but judgment cannot be
passed until we have had more exper'
ience of this application.
The most important task of the
postwar period was the lighting of
the 1951 Festival of Britain, which
was the first large scale exhibition to
be held since the war. The British
lighting designer had his last oppor'
tunity to create lavish outdoor light'
ing in 1939 when the Empire Exhibb
tion was held at Glasgow, and in
planning for that he was able to call
upon the experience of his French
colleagues, for the 1937 Paris Exhb
bition was still in progress when Glas'
gow was being planned; also there
was the example of the American Ex'
hibitions —especially the Golden Gate
Exposition. But the 1951 Festival
was the first of its kind in the post'
war world and a new generation of
designers had grown up who had not
had the previous opportunity of see'
ing other people’s work of a similar
character and had never handled a
venture of this size and complexity.
Another factor which made the Festi'
val different to its predecessors was
that the main exhibition was not a
collection of buildings displaying the
production of the country, but the
whole intention was to tell a logical
and coherent story, a story of Britain
and the British people. The second
part of the Festival was the Pleasure
Gardens, divorced from the main ex'
hibition and recapturing to some ex'
tent the atmosphere of the Pleasure
Gardens of the last century. The main
exhibition was serious in its purpose,
the pleasure gardens were frankly
frivolous.
The lighting of the main exhibition
on the South Bank of the Thames
was characteristic of posriwar lighting
practice in Britain, restraint, simplic'
ity, economy. Light was at no time
used as an end in itself; at all pre'
war exhibitions light had been con'
sciously used for its own sake. At
San Francisco there were huge Tow'
ers of the Moon with blue lighting.
Towers of the Sun with golden light'
ing, structures were created in order
to display coloured light. At Glas-
gow, lakes, fountains, and cascades
were built in order to provide a diV
play of light allied with water, con'
crete structures were built for no
reason except to act as a background
for lighting. But at the South Bank
lighting was used out of doors to re'
veal the forms of building, the con'
struction of most of which were
unique, to add decoration when used
in conjunction with trees and water,
and indoors to reveal the exhibits. It
was the restraint with which lighting
was used which made its application
so exciting, at no time was one con'
scious of lighting as such, only its
effect.
The Exhibition site was cut into
two by a main line railway bridge, the
two halves were then dominated by
two huge structures, one vertical and
one horizontal. In one half was the
new concert hall and an old shot
tower in which at one time lead shot
had been made, and in the other half
COLOURED FLOODLIGHTING.
This representation of the Crystal Palace was floodlighted by coloured fluorescent lamps which
were operated by a dimmer to give it colour changing and dimming affect.

the Dome of Discovery and a slim
needle called the Skylon, 250 feet
high supported on three cables fifty
feet above the ground. These four
structures dominated the exhibition
site by day and their shapes were re-
vealed by subtle lighting treatment at
night. Only a small part of the top
of the dark grey shot tower was
floodlighted and about eight feet of
the base. Various openings in the
wall of the tower were lighted from
within, but the general shape was
rendered visible by light reflected
from other buildings. Discreet use
was made of floodlighting for the Fes-
tival Concert Hall to give an outline
to the building only, but as the whole
of the river frontage of the hall is
of glass through which can be seen
the huge main foyer, the restaurant,
and the staircases leading up to the
auditorium, any form of general exter-
ior floodlighting would have detract-
ed from the effect obtained by see-
ing into this brightly lighted interior.
Much has "been said and written of
the Dome of Discovery, this huge
aluminium dome 375' in diameter and
93’ high, supported only on its outer
rim. It housed all the scientific ex-
hibits on three levels, and because
the architect wished to emphasise the
smooth curve of the dome and its
supporting skirt, no visible light fit-
tings were allowed. Inside the Dome
there was no lighting except that on
the various exhibits, and in this semi-
dark interior one was conscious of
the vastness of the dome against which
the people seemed so small, and then
because the Dome of Discovery told
a story of the growth of the human
mind and a story of the Universe in
which that mind was seeking so many
answers, one felt that one was divorc-
ed from reality and simply a viewpoint
in space. This spacial concept was
taken up again in the exterior. Only
the skirt stretching inwards from the
rim of the Dome was lighted and
then by means of groups of 150 watt
spotlights concealed under the eaves
around the periphery. The huge mass
of the Dome itself was left unlighted
and from all points overlooking the
exhibition was seen only by contrast
and by reflected light.
On the other hand the skylon was
by day an aluminium needle, at night
an incredible vertical needle of light
poised high up in the air. It was
both a beautiful piece of architecture
and engineering and a very clever
piece of lighting. The lattice struc-
ture was lighted from the inside by a
series of conical polished aluminium
shades on twelve inch centres running
right up the centre, each cone con-
tained three one hundred watt lamps
which light the outside of the cone
immediately above it. As no light
fell upon the supporting cables there
was the complete detachment of this
ray of light poised motionless in the
air.
The main concourse which linked
the two halves of the Exhibition pro-
vided a unique lighting system, 15
watt lamps were recessed into the
pavement and as there was no form
of direct light in the vicinity the im-
pression of walking on the stars was
complete.
Almost every outdoor lighting re-
quirement at South Bank represented
a problem for the lighting engineer,
the biggest problem of all being that
as the exhibition site could be view-
ed from almost every angle and at a
number of different levels, glare had
to be avoided and because of the diffi-
culty of experiment, avoided at the
drawing board stage. For example,
much use was made of what are term-
ed '"'mobiles,” shapes of metal support-
ed so that they move freely in the
wind, presenting a bewildering com-
plexity of shapes.
One such series of mobiles, consist-
ing of metal spinners, was erected
along the whole length of the Baily
Bridge which was especially construct-
ed across the Thames to provide an
additional entrance to the exhibition
site. There were sixty-six masts
carrying the metal spinners, each sur-
mounted by the Festival Emblem
which was a star, the problem was to
light the spinners and the star so that
no light source was visible from any
point of view and no glare was to be
experienced by people using the
bridge. The solution was to mount
groups of concentrating floods below
the level of the bridge projected ver-
tically upwards and louvred to pre-
vent any view from the bridge pave-
ment. A similar problem occurred in
the lighting of the various groups of
flags and here floodlights were mount-
ed on the masts themselves well above
eye level and contained in conical
features which in the daytime disguis-
ed their purpose.
Another interesting mobile effect
was obtained from a large screen
which served to shut out the view
of nearby Waterloo Railway Station
from the site. The screen consisted
of a steel framework against which
three feet square patches -of canvas
were loosely stretched. The screen
was twenty one feet high and every
twelve feet of length the colour of
the canvas was changed. The bright
colour coupled with the movement of
the canvas in the wind gave the
whole a lively effect which was en-
hanced at night by lighting each can*
vas patch individually by means of a
150 watt reflector spotlight. The ap-
parent mobility of such a large num-
ber of patches would never have
been achieved if the whole screen
had been conventionally floodlighted.
One further lighting effect should
be mentioned. The architecture of
South Bank was contemporary and
from the river or from Waterloo
Bridge one could see the masses of
glass and feel that one was seeing the
shapes of architecture to come. On
the opposite side of the river, range
the buildings which collectively are
known as White Hall Court and
which are Gothic in character. These
buildings were floodlighted to act as
a foil for the contemporary scene
across the river, ten SKW long range
floods focussed only on the upper
portions of the buildings were used
creating the impression of an older
and possibly more restful age appear-
ing as a mirage above the river.
If the South Bank Exhibition show-
ed light as the handmaid of Archi-
tecture in the Pleasure Gardens situ-
ated along the river at Battersea it
was used as a decorative medium in
its own right, but once again it achiev-
ed its effect by its delicacy and re-
straint. There was an absence of
broad masses of light and colour;
free use was made of lanterns and
candelabra effects, the lighting of
trees and shrubberies, conscious shad-
ow to act as a dark foreground to a
lighting effect. The decorative treat-
ment of the Gardens had a distinctly
Victorian flavour in as much as free
use was made of structures made from
cane which took their form from the
wrought iron structures so much be-
loved by the Victorians. The con-
cept of the gardens was romantic, the
effect to be achieved frankly pretty
and because the gardens had to be
picturesque by day as well as by night,
the lighting equipment to be used had
to be pretty, hence apart from flood-
lights which could be concealed all
other equipment had to be designed
to be in keeping with the fairy tale
atmosphere. For example, the lan-
terns used for the lighting of the
main promenade consisted of street
lighting standards carrying wicker
bird cages with a lamp inside so de-
signed that they threw a pool of lighr
on the ground immediately below.
This essential prettiness was well
exemplified in the main vista which
was a strip occupying the whole of-
the width of the gardens, and built
on a number of levels so that from
the top or river end one could look
down to the far end over a lake with

British Housing Speed - Up
BRINGS SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN BUILDING.
Short-Cuts Give People Homes.
Just a little over nine months ago
the Conservatives took office in Brit'
ain. They made certain promises on
housing which, “come hell or high'
water,” they are determined to keep.
To date the British Government has
established a notable record, and the
results of the housing drive so far
this year is a notable achievement.
To complete 22 per cent, more
houses in the first quarter of 1952
compared with 1951; to have 15 per
cent, more houses under construction
and to start 34 per cent, more houses
in the same quarter than last year—
these figures reflect the greatest pos'
sible credit on the British building
industry.
Significant Increase.
The 10,000 extra houses finished
during the first quarter of 1952, com-
pared with the same period last year,
represent an increase of 22 per cent,
in house completions in Great Brit'
am. It is significant that though more
houses were built for private owner'
ship it was not done at the expense
of houses for letting. During the
first three months of this year over
8000 more houses were built for let'
ting than in the same period last year.
These 10,000 extra houses are the
first fruits of the housing speed'up.
Not only has the Government com'
pleted more houses but it also has
more under construction. On March
31, 1951, there were 202,053 houses
being built. This year at the same
time the figure was 231,651 —which is
15 per cent. more.
Likewise, more houses were started
in the first quarter of 1952 —34 per
cent, more than last year—59,577
against 44,536.
According to the Ministry of Hous'
ing, all the ground work for success
is there, but the real test of the pro-
gress of the work lies with U.K. local
authorities, the builders, the workers
and the producers of building mater'
ials.
Government Gratitude.
The British Government expresses
itself as being “very grateful to every'
one who has tried to catch the new
spirit in the building industry—local
government and builders alike”—but
adds that it is far too early to be smug
about the achievements.
Without doubt thousands of these
extra houses would not have been
finished during the first quarter with'
out the new spirit of urgency which
advanced their completion from May
to April or from March to February,”
adds the report.
Alternative Materials.
The report points out that there
must always be a risk to any building
programme in days of international
stress and uncertainty. Vital national
needs such as defence make large de'
mands on building resources. The
authorities must therefore find quick
remedies for local shortages of mater'
ials and thus cut site delays. The full'
est advantage must also be taken of
alternative materials.
A good example of this is found in
what is described as a “non'tradition'
al” house built from materials other
than the familiar bricks and mortar.
There are various processes, including
the use of concrete and other materials
whose quality has been proved to be
equal to bricks. The Housing Minis'
try hopes that there will be a consider'
able increase in the number of houses
of this type as their advantages and
speed, of building become more wide-
ly known.
Over 200,000 families have been
increased in non'traditional houses
since the end of the war, and build'
ers have increased the number under
construction by 26 per cent, in the
first quarter of 1952 compared with
1951.
Over 150,000 one'Storey temporary
bungalows (or pre-fabricated houses)
were built in the U.K. in the first
years of the war. The non'traditional
houses to which the authorities are
now looking to increase the building
programme are permanent houses com'
parable in every way with the tradb
tional “bricks and mortar” house.
Some of the approved methods in'
dude a measure of preTabrication,
which “brings the advantages of fac'
tory production into house'building.”
Built More Quickly.
These non'traditional homes can be
built more quickly, and national fig'
ures show that on the average the
time of completion for this type of
house is 20 per cent, less than for
traditional ones.
Some have been built even quicker.
In March the Minister opened some
at Eastcote, Middlesex, which had
taken seven weeks from start to finish,
with amenities comparable in every
way with the traditional brick house.
Block System.
The system of block licenses which
has been introduced in the U.K. can
also be applied to building non-tradb
tional houses. According to publish'
ed figures, the best results are obtained
by building non'traditional houses on
a substantial scale. For instance, a
contract for 20 houses needs 250 to
350 fewer “site man hours” than a
contract for four houses. And a com
tract for 40 or 100 houses show even
greater saving. But to obtain these
figures the authorities need the com
tribution of the small builder as well
as the large contractor. Both are ne'
cessary, each has his place in the
British housing programme.
People’s House.
The People’s House, the space'save
dwellings which conserve precious ma-
terials, are growing in popularity.
Many local authorities are building to
this type of design, which aims to
save 10 per cent, of main building
materials while maintaining room sizes.
Regional Production Boards.
The Regional Production Boards—
or “bottleneck busters”—are out to
speed the building of houses, and have
now buckled down to the task. They
will keep everyone, including the
Housing Ministry, on their toes, and
the first quarter’s figures for 1952
show that the impetus of the housing
drive is steadily increasing.
The successful outcome of the hous'
ing drive lies in materials like steel
and softwood timber, and with ade'
quate basic raw materials the Govern'
ment will speedily complete its mam'
moth housing programme.
BESCO OVERHAND PLANER.
Streamlined design is applied to this wood-
working machine by F. J. Edwards, of Lon-
don. It can be used for planing, jointing, re-
bating and moulding. The heavy box section
stand, of fine grey iron, carries two precision-
ground tables having a combined overall length
of 60in., allowing a 12in. cut. These tables
are adjusted in height independently. The
cylindrical cutter block is in two sections to
allow moulding or growing irons to be used
without disturbing the setting of the two
planing knives and revolves at 4,250 r.p.m.
in dustproof ball bearings. The guard is
fully adjustable and the long fence can be
tilted up to 45 deg. and remain rigid when
locked in its self-aligning brackets. The ma-
chine is driven by two vee-belts from a 2
h.p. 3-phase 50 cycle motor 400/440 volts
and is, therefore, a complete self-contained
unit.

Some Fallacies About
Timber
So much has been learned about
the seasoning and proper treatment of
Australian timber during the past
twenty-five years that it is surprising
to find how many fallacies about tim-
ber are believed and quoted. They
show a lack of understanding not only
of new methods but also of old estab-
lished ones.
For example, many people—includ-
ing some builders—believe that:—
• Sap is removed from timber in
seasoning, and kiln drying takes
the “nature’ ’out of timber.
• Timber stacked on end dries
quickly because the sap runs
down or is drawn down by the
force of gravity.
• Vertical flues in an air-seasoning
stack allow the air to rise and
increase the circulation.
During the seasoning of timber,
whether the method used is air or
kiln seasoning, or a combination of
both, the only constituent removed
which influences its properties is water.
The reason why green timber is
seasoned is to remove most of the
water present so that subsequent
shrinkage of the wood can be avoided.
The aim is to dry the timber to a
moisture content which is in balance
with the average humidity of the en-
vironment in which it will be used.
When this moisture content (known
as the equilibrium moisture content)
is obtained, subsequent “movement’’
re-shrinking, and swelling of the wood
is reduced to an absolute minimum.
This moisture content varies from
about 10 per cent, of the weight of
the wood in Adelaide to about 13 per
cent, in Brisbane—other capital cities
being within this range.
Although timber stacked on end
may dry quickly provided there is
ample space to spread the stacks, the
reason for the rapid drying is that
free circulation of air around each
board can then be obtained. The
structure of the timber is too minute
for any appreciable amount of sap to
drain down by gravity. End racking
is only suitable for timbers that do not
warp, because less restraint by spacing
strips can be provided.
The method of stacking timber for
air seasoning is of the utmost im-
portance and basic principles are now
clearly recognised. While vertical flues
in flat stacked timber stacks do in-
crease the circulation of air through
the stack, this is not because the air
rises through the flues. Actually, the
reverse is the case. As the air cir-
culates through the stack it becomes
cooled and, owing to its increased
weight, tends to circulate downwards
in the flues. Cold moist air collects
at the bottom and unless removed de-
lays the drying-out of the timber—
sometimes indefinitely. To assist this
downward movement, good circulation
of air underneath the stack in all
directions is essential. This is easier
to obtain with horizontal stacking
than with the vertical method.

CRANE CONTROLLED BY
TELEVISION.
The remote control of a large over-
head travelling crane by radio and tele-
vision at the Mechanical Handling Ex-
hibition at Olympia, London, attracted
considerable attention. Operation of
the crane, which can handle danger-
ous products in bulk such as atomic
materials, is achieved from a safe dis-
tance and assures that the operator
can handle the crane and see what the
crane is doing without exposing him-
self to danger.
By adding a television camera (de-
signed and manufactured by Marconi’s
Wireless Telegraph Co. Ltd.), to the
crane, it is now possible for the oper-
ator to see what is going on at some
remote point and handle his crane ac-
cordingly. It is claimed that the
handling of atomic and similar pro-
ducts in bulk can now be achieved
with perfect safety.

Laminex & Formica
Are Versatile
Building Materials
Australian Firm Demonstrates and
Exploits Possibilities.
Featuring a wide range of glorious
colours and patterns with smoothness
of texture and distinctive modern de-
signs Decorative Laminex is destined
to become one of the most practical
of all surfacing materials.
At their new Exhibition Centre in
Bathurst Street, A. D. Broady and
Company are now demonstrating the
numerous applications of both Lam'
inex and Formica.
In a chat with Mr. Broady our rep'
resentative learned many interesting
facts about the Exhibition Centre and
its usefulness to the building industry.
The basic idea behind the Centre,
Mr. Broady said, was to offer an op'
portunity to promote business oppor-
tunities by cooperation.
“In introducing this idea into Aus'
tralia we realise that we are making a
radical departure from orthodox bush
ness methods,” Mr. Broady remarked.
“Our aim is to work out new ways
and means of using our products, ex-
change ideas with go'ahead, progres'
sive firms, encourage them to seek new
methods, and assist them in every
way possible.
“In other words, we will cooper'
ate with anyone and everyone to our
mutual benefit, by exchanging ideas
and information.” Mr. Broady com
tinued.
“We will be very happy to offer
any technical advice free to anyone.
“We desire to impress on Archi'
tects and Builders that our methods
and materials hold no secrets, and that
we are established and equipped to
give prompt and efficient service,” Mr.
Broady added.
Humble Start.
Mr. Broady related the history of
his organisation from one room in
Surry Hills to the present palatial
Centre in Bathurst Street in the span
of a few years.
He had for long been intrigued
with the manifold possibilities, com'
mercially, and artistically, of both
Laminex and Formica, which are the
trade names of a special kind of lam'
inated plastic board of exceptional
hardness and durability with a lustrous
finish in beautiful colours.
This material has long enjoyed a
vogue in Britain, the Continent, and
U.S.A., where it has been put to an
infinite variety of uses.
When Manchester'born Mr. Broady
returned to civilian life after war ser'
vice in the Australian Armed Forces,
he proceeded to explore the possibili-
ties of marketing Laminex and For'
mica in Australia on a big scale.
However, he found Australian con'
ditions differed greatly from any other
country in the world, and it was ne-
cessary to evolve new techniques :n
using the two products.
“In England these materials are
used as exterior surfacing,” Mr. Broady
said.
“But the strong Australian sun
caused condensation on exterior work
and resulted in blistering.
“The outcome of it was that we
evolved new glues and new methods
to meet Australian conditions,” he
added. (continued on page 57)

(continued from page 55)
Mr. Broady told us that his firm
had its humble beginnings “using
nothing but hand tools, imagination,
grit, and enthusiasm.”
Mr. Broady was helped by two loyal
and able men, Mr. N. Miller, a Mast'
er Builder, and Mr. C. Fuller, who
saw the possibilities of the project,
and took a great personal pride and
interest in each job.
Together the team designed new
tools to enable the fabrication of Lam'
inex and Formica for all purposes.
Wonderful Response.
Mr. Broady paid a tribute to Aus'
tralian initiative and know-how, point'
ing out that, given encouragement and
the opportunity, Australians can
evolve new methods, machines, and
tools equal to the world’s best.
Qualifying this statement, he dis'

U.K. Housing Costs
The cost of two'bedroomed houses
built in England and Wales ranged
from £lOO6 to £1769. Three'bed'
roomed houses cost between £lll3
and £2228. Average subsidy for each
house was £5/1/0.
Birmingham, with 20,045 houses
built or rebuilt since the war, is lead'
ing the housing drive in England and
Wales. Bristol is second with 14,181
houses. The number of houses for
Londoners is 84,510, the combined

Efflorescence in
Brickwork
Preventive Measures Possible.
The ever-recurring problem of cT
florescence in brickwork has been
raised again by several builders, so
that a summary of information recent'
ly published on this subject may be
of interest.
It is well'known that efflorescence
can result from the saturation by
water and, on drying out, subsequent
crystallisation of soluble salts present
in brickwork. This may take on or
beneath the surface, either during the
original drying out of the building
or during periods of dry weather fob
lowing rain.
Surface efflorescence does not usual'
ly cause any damage, but it is un'
sightly. Rain may gradually wash
away the salts, but at the same time
part is absorbed back into the brick'
work. When the wall dries out they
appear again, but in a slightly less
quantity. This process of removal may
be accelerated by repeated washings
with water, allowing intervals for the
salts to be deposited between washings,
when they can be brushed off with a
wire brush. The use of acids and
other chemicals may produce an addh
tional supply of efflorescent saks.
Efflorescence beneath the surface
can damage the wall by causing the
surface to break up or flake away to
such an extent that the only remedy
is to cut out the damaged brickwork
and make good.
There are no satisfactory methods
of treating efflorescence in existing
brickwork other than those given
above. It is important, therefore, to
consider how it is caused and what
precautions to take to prevent its re'
currence.
Efflorescence is caused by:—
• Soluble salts in the materials from
which bricks and mortar .ire
made.
• Soluble salts produced during the
manufacture of bricks.
• Salt introduced into brickwork
from outside sources, such as in'
filling behind retaining walls,
garden soil, objects stacked
against it, or contamination from
sea water or spray.
• Faulty construction.
To prevent efflorescence: —
• Ensure correct design of con'
struction details for—
Damp'proof courses at the top
and bottom of walls and
around openings;
Weathering features, e.g., cop'
ing stones at the top of
parapet walls;
The joints between the brick'
work and other materials.
• Underfired bricks should never
be used.
• Choose mortar mixes for joints
with similar properties of strength
and porosity to those of the
bricks.
• Protect unfinished work during
inclement weather.
Further information on the cause
and effect of efflorescence in brick'
work is contained in the two follow'
ing books, which may be available in
any public library:—

New Building Techniques Rekindle
Old Labour Feuds
U.S. Unions Clash Over New
Methods and Materials.
During 1951 a Pittsburgh (U.S.A.)
building contractor found he had been
involved in union jurisdictional dis-
putes at the rate of one a week.
His experience, reports “Business
Week,’’ is typical of a U.S.-wide situ-
ation. As new methods and materials
come into use, unions fight for juris-
diction over the new type of work.
There’s little a contractor can do about
it except chalk up lost time and hope
for a quick settlement.
The Pittsburgh contractor calls that
city the country’s “worst plague spot”
for jurisdictional problems. That’s
partly because of the bustle of con-
struction in the city’s Triangle, partly
because of wide use of new technique
and materials.
Alcoa Episode.
When the Aluminium Co. of Amer-
ica planned to build in Pittsburgh, it
naturally decided to use as much alu-
minium as possible. Architects de-
signed a building using specially con-
structed aluminium panelling for the
outer shell. A nice modern idea, but
one that caused considerable labour
upheavals.
Both the Sheet Metal Workers
(AFL) and the Structural Iron Work-
ers (AFL) claimed the right to install
the aluminium panels—something not
clearly covered in union jurisdictional
rules.
The sheet metal workers claimed
they are entitled to all work on metals
10-gauge or lighter—including the 12-
gauge aluminium on the Alcoa build-
ing. The structural iron workers re-
torted that the Alcoa job wasn't sheet-
metal work but structural work: it’s
an assembly job, with windows built
into the panels.
When the iron workers got the jobs,
the sheet metal workers picketed the
building—shutting down all work for
four days.
The iron workers retaliated by
jumping their jurisdiction to work on
16-gauge metal (normally handled by
sheet metal workers) on the U.S.
Steel-Mellon skyscraper. In retalia-
tion, sheet metal workers picketed
that fob, too.
The Pittsburgh Building Trades
Council (AFL) then suspended the
sheet metal local union for picketing
in a jurisdictional dispute (it’s against
an unwritten building-trade union law)
and got the rival locals to agree to a
truce. They’ll share work while the
question of jurisdiction over alumin-
ium panels goes to the industry’s joint
board on jurisdictional disputes.
Divide The Work.
The idea of dividing up work is also
being followed on other buildings in
the Pittsburgh area where stainless
steel is used with stone.
Facings on three Equitable skyscrap'
ers in the Point Park area are stain-
less steel, backed by four to eight
inches of concrete. Sheet metal work-
ers, iron workers, and stone masons all
claimed jurisdiction—but worked out
a compromise settlement, dividing the
jobs. Sheet metal workers fabricate
the stainless steel sheets and straighten
out rough edges. Iron workers hoist
finshed panels into position. Stone
masons attach them. It takes extra
workers—but contractors avoid juris-
dictional tangles.
No Ledges—No Window-washing!
Other innovations cause similar
problems. For example, the modern
58

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


structural design of the U.S. Steel'
Mellon tower almost eliminated win'
dow ledges. The Building Service
Employees International Union (AF
L), which represents window clean'
ers, took a look and protested. There’d
be no window washing, it said, until
“safe” ledges were added.
To meet this union demand, metal
strips had to be welded on at the base
of each window.
Tiles, Too.
A whole series of disputes in the
Pittsburgh area stems from a new
trend toward noise'deadening acousth
cal ceilings. One one building job
where acoustic tiles were used, carpent'
ers, plasterers, and bricklayers got into
an argument about which group
should fasten the tiles. They finally
agreed to let the carpenters put half
the tiles on, and the plasterers and
bricklayers oneTourth each.
Book Review
Spon's Architects’ & Builders'
Price Book.
1951'52. 77th Edition.
585 pp. Index. English Price, 18/1.
E. 6? F. N. Spon Ltd., London.
One would think that it would in'
deed be a brave man who had the tern'
erity to produce a book on the tick'
lish and elusive subject of current
building costs. Spon’s, however, in
this publication of which this is the
77th Edition have over this long per-
iod been able to achieve a perspective
view of conditions and so march on
undismayed.
Although, of course, the rates quot'
ed for labour (craftsmen 3/' per hour
and labourers per hour) have no
relation to conditions prevailing in
Australia the system of measuring and
estimating does not change and this is
one of the major reasons for the book.
The book is a most comprehensive
reference for it contains all kinds of
valuable data relevant to the building
industry, working rules for the build'
ing industry, grading of districts,
market prices of materials, architects’
fees, quantity surveyors’ fees, etc.
That the problem of keeping up
with evet'rising costs is not only an
Australian phenomenon is instanced by
the fact that in the back of the book
there is a Stop Press section covering
the latest rises in prices and wages
and yet again in a loose insertion.
This latter explains that prices in this
edition were current at the end of
February, 1951. “Since then the cost
of labour has risen about 16% and
the cost of materials by about 2%. As'
suming the proportion of labour and
materials costs to be 40 : 60, the costs
of building has risen by about
(March 31, 1952).

Housing And The
Dustman
British Problems.
“Economical employment of labour
for refuse collection is a problem very
much to the fore at the present
time,” said Mr. H. Turner in his
presidential address at the Conference
of the British Institute of Public
Cleansing. “The development of new
housing schemes usually entails longer
carries for the ashbin men, and it is
very desirable for these to be kept to
the minimum, consistent with the con'
venience of the householder.
Mr. Turner went on to describe how
by co'operation with the housing de-
velopment authorities in a project in
his area a scheme has been adopted
for the provision of an ashbin hous'
ing in the side of newly built cot'
poration houses, together with provh
sion of a shelf for salvage. This ar'
rangement has been in operation for
over five years, and has been success'
ful in minimising the distance the
bin has to be carried, and ensured
its tidy housing.
CAUSES OF AMERICAN UNION DISPUTES. (see article on opposite page)
(Top) As neither window sills nor ledges were provided in this Pittsburgh building, window
cleaners objected, with the result that metal strips were added to sills. At a nearby con-
struction job . . . (bottom) Sheet metal workers and iron workers’ unions fought over who
would install aluminium panels in the new Alcoa building. (N.B. —The iron workers “won”.)

Cleveland
Zoological Park
Is Being Revitalised.
Cleveland, Ohio, is the sixth largest
city in the U.S.A. In 1902 it grouped
its public buildings in a “group plan”.
The courthouse and city hall are sep-
arated by a wall 540 ft. wide, 1500 ft.
long. An auditorium accommodates
an audience of 11,635, the stadium
seats 78,189. It has a public square.
In the Rockefeller Park there are 20
“cultural gardens” where busts and
statues of national heroes abound.
There are 32 parks and parklands, in-
cluding the magnificent Zoological
Park, situated on a wooded hillside
a little distant from the city.
With characteristic enthusiasm, the
Zoo authorities have initiated a re-
habilitation programme which calls
for a series of major structures to
house live exhibits.
The entire Zoo has been studied
over a period of six years to provide
a master guidance plan for the ulti-
mate expansion of the project.
Already several minor exhibits are
completed and this has been the re-
sult of a working collaboration be-
tween architect and sculptor to a re-
markable degree.
For instance, in the main entrance
of the Bird Building (see illustration),
the tower is embellished with five large
ceramic panels representing bird de-
velopment from prehistoric times to
the present.
The panels from bottom to top rep-
resent the archaeopteryx, the earliest
form of bird life, which was prob-
ably clumsy in flight similar to the
modern flying squirrel; the Hesporor-
nis, a six-foot loon who lived ninety-
million years ago, a master of water
propulsion; the Diatryma, the first
of the great earth-bound birds; the
Dodo, an awkward, flightless pigeon
of recent extinct classification; and
the American eagle, symbolizing the
now-living species. The smaller plac-
ques represent the extinct North
American birds; the Labrador Duck,
Heath Hen, Esquimaux Curlew, Car-
olina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon and
the Great Awk.
The modelling was executed in the
Cleveland studios of James and Rob-
ert Fillious, where a forty-foot easel
permitted accurate perspective cor-
rections for the various heights from
which the ceramics were to be view-
ed. Positive casts were used in study-
ing the colour, and full-sized negative
casts were shipped to the manufac-
turer.
When it comes to a comparison of
zoological gardens, we know that
Sydney’s Zoo holds its own among
the world’s best, but how “our
mouths water” for the “group plan”
with wide through streets (one show
place of which is 540 ft. wide) the
auditorium, the stadium, the public
square, the cultural gardens and many
other things, all of which goes to
show the nation owes something to the
cultivation of arts, and beauty, as well
as utility. It makes us realise how
little we have done in the last 50
years compared to Cleveland, despite
the fact that its population is only
about two-thirds the size of Sydney’s
population.
LIGHTING AND COLOUR
IN FACTORIES.
British Development.
The importance of lighting and
colour in factory design was mention-
ed by Walter R. Bennett, L.R.1.8.A.,
in a paper, “Amenities in Factory
Design,” presented at a recent meet-
ing of the Royal Society of Arts,
London.
Mr. Bennett said that standards of
artificial lighting had improved a great
deal since 1939, and this was partly
the result of having to provide better
conditions of lighting during blackout
conditions.
“Good eyesight is a priceless asset
and every effort must be made in the
design and arrangement of lighting to
avoid glare and eyestrain,” he said.
“The installation should also be of
such a nature that it does not form
an artificial ceiling at a false and low
level, which would create an unnatural
feeling of oppression, and the colour
of the light must also be related to
the general decorative scheme and the
type of work being carried out.”
Colour.
In recent years there had been an
increasing appreciation of the im-
portance of the scientific use of colour
in factories and research, and ex-
perience had proved that the use of
the right colours helped to increase
production and improve the general
working conditions, and by no means
least it also helped to reduce accidents.
The selection of colours for an in-
dustry was by no means a simple and
casual matter, and it was one which
required the most careful study, in
order to get the correct result in rela-
tion to the background, the surround-
ing plant, and the lighting system, so
as to reduce eyestrain and glare.
In the past too many firms had what
they termed their own “standard
colour scheme.” It was, and some-
times still is, dreary and drab, and was
applied to all buildings, irrespective
of the type of work or aspect and
lighting of the factory.
The British Colour Council had
given material assistance to many of
the leading industrial concerns, and
they had helped to induce that ap-
preciation of colour which was now
showing itself in many different direc-
tions.
The general background colours
should be restful and neutral, and
should be from the pastel ranges of
colours, but certain sections of the
buildings, such as columns, stanchions,
doors, etc., could with success be pick-
ed out in the brighter harder wearing
colours. Any colour which gave a
tendency of glare must be avoided,
and for this reason the use of white
or very light cream was not generally
satisfactory. The painting of
machinery had had considerable atten-
tion during recent years and in this
there was a wide field to give better
and brighter conditions inside factories.
No hard and fast rules could be laid
down, but the use of bright colours on
the moving parts or points of opera-
tion was a good guide, and the use of
cool colours, such as blue or green,
on heat-producing plant had proved
beneficial.

GERMAN HOUSING.
West Germany will build 380,000
new dwellings in the 1952-53 financial
year. The Government will give
financial aid in building 300,000 of
them and the balance will be financed
privately.
About 92,000 of the new dwellings
will be occupied by coal miners in the
crowded Ruhr.
Last year West Germany built
400,000 new homes, claimed as a
West European record.

NEW THOUGHTS IN DECORATION
FOLIAGE INSIDE AND OUT.
New ideas in decoration and new ways of doing old things are always coming forward; indeed it would be a barren world were this not
the case. There is an artificial character about the garden setting that was attached to a recent Italian exhibition and as depicted in the left
illustration. Rows of pot plants supported in cantilever brackets rather remind one of the old English coconut shies under the open pergola.
The lorenge-shaped garden plots in the concrete paving, each with their own electric light, is an unusual feature. The built-in settee under
the curved window in the centre view is attractive and looks comfortable with its cushioned back rest, which is more than can be said
for that on the right, where the central sprawling plant offers doubtful support for aching backs. Monsterio Delicioso is used most decoratively
all over America, but this surely is a base misapplication of something that can be and is most effective.

The Sir Tohn Sulman Medal is
awarded in New South Wales each
year from a fund he provided with a
view to encouraging excellence in de-
sign in architecture. The fund is so
constituted that all buildings are di-
vided into five classes, namely:
1. Public and Monumental.
2. Educational and Ecclesiastical.
3. Commercial and Industrial.
4. Recreational.
5. Domestic and Residential.
The award is made to each class in
rotation.
The architect for the selected build'
ing receives a bronze medal and a dip-
loma; and a plaque is affixed to the
building.
Commenting on the award the
Chairman of the Jury, Mr. A. E. StaT
ford, said: “Each year the buildings
entered in competition represent the
cream of the work completed in their
class. As with the best in all the arts,
there is always some controversy as to
their merit. And this is exactly what
Sulman himself would have wished,
because contention in these matters is
the sign of healthy interest and the
root of progress.”
Previous winners in the Domestic
class have been:
1934 Professor Leslie Wilkinson, for
his own home at Double Bay;
1940 G. H. B. McDonell for a
house at Gordon;
1945 Sydney Ancher, for home at
Killara;
1948 A. H. A. Hanson, for his own
home at Killara.

ing a vote of thanks, underlined the
importance of reports on progress
abroad. A wealth of information had
been presented by the three speakers,
and one cannot help but draw the con'
elusion that the developments in light'
ing in Australia compared favourably
with those overseas. The speakers
were complimented on the presenta'

fountains in it, to a large screen made
to represent the end elevation of the
1851 Crystal Palace which housed
the Great Exhibition of 1851 and
which last year’s exhibition seemed
to commemorate and which was used
as a drop cloth for the fireworks dis-
plays. Huge chandeliers each con-
taining nearly 200, 40 watt candle
lamps with smaller ones either side
containing 28 candle lamps lighted the
top of the Vista, red and gold painted
arcades outlined with incandescent
lamps flanked the lake and were re-
flected in its still waters, whilst at the
head of the lake were towers of skele-
ton construction lighted from the in-
side by means of Mercury vapour
lamps and outside by yellow incande-
scent. The lighting of the Crystal
Palace background was achieved by
coloured fluorescent lamps on a con-
tiuously operated dimmer system, as
the brightly lighted structure faded
out it could be seen in silhouette
against the softly lighted trees behind
it.
A new manufacturing technique
never hitherto used was employed for
lanterns which were used in large
quantities. Plastic material is sprayed
from a gun on to a wire frame work
and when dry takes the form of the
frame. There is no limit to the shapes
which can be created by this process
and admirable use was made of the
technique not only for making con-
ventional Chinese type lanterns, but
also delicate tulip shaped chalices
which were used for lighting the ele-
gant dancing pavilion. The same ma-
terial and technique was used for mak-
ing swans and other birds and ani-
mals which were lighted from the in-
side.
The lighting of trees and shrubs
was carried out partially statically by
conventional equipment and partly by
colour changing and dimming equip-
ment operating hot cathode fluorescent
lamps. Groups of red, blue and green
tubes were wired to a continuously
operated mixing and dimming system
and the ever-changing colour of the
foliage of the well-developed trees
along the main promenade gave an
element of surprise when viewed from
the darker foreground of this part of
the gardens. This was one of the
lighting effects used at the Festival
which will considerably influence our
ideas on outdoor lighting in the fu-
ture, and it may be mentioned that
the same system would have been seen
in operation in Sydney if the Royal
Tour had not been cancelled in such
tragic circumstances.
One problem which was not solved
was the lighting of flower beds and
although quite attractive shades were
designed for the various beds, which
were successful at night, their appear-
ance during the day time was so incon-
gruous that it was decided not to use
them.
South Bank and Battersea were only
two of the very many exhibitions
throughout Britain in 1951. A new
technique had to be worked out for
both the lighting for display and the
lighting for festive occasions. Inevip
ably mistakes were made and ideas
failed to achieve the high purpose of
their creators, nevertheless a great
deal was successful and will have an
important bearing on the future.
And if one may hazard a guess as
to the future of lighting in Britain it
is to see the lighting engineer much
more at home with the art of light'
ing and less obsessed with the purely
engineering aspects of it. Jie is as'
similating the results of research and
beginning to apply those results not
altogether with a slide rule but with
the eye of an artist, he is considering
even problems in industrial lighting
as problems in environment as well
as engineering. The lighting industry
is adopting a much more responsible
attitude and is genuinely trying to im'
prove standards of fittings design and
one sees now fewer of the more ab'
surd casings for fluorescent lamps
which were called lighting fittings in
the immediate post-war period. Light-
ing is an art as well as a science and
the trend in Britain is to produce
beauty as well as efficiency, and if we
have not yet reached the standards
in this regard of some of our near
neighbours at least the purely utiliter-
ian in lighting is behind us.
Part 3: LIGHTING LANDMARKS ON FIVE CONTINENTS—WHERE DO
WE STAND?
By P. J. GRUNDFEST
PART 3.
Le Corbusier said once; “Architec-
ture is above utilitarian things.” We
could say just as well: “Lighting is
above utilitarian things.” In spite of
his aphorism he designed many utili-
tarian buildings between Rio and Mos-
cow, but they all are of functional
20th century beauty.
Lighting engineering, too, produced
such outstanding creative personalities.
Paavo Tynell, a native of Finland, is
one of them who sometimes designs
lighting just for the sake of beauty—
almost “above utilitarian things,” and
then again, like Le Corbusier’s, his
beautiful creations become functional.
Leading men all over the globe are
designing correct lighting which, in its
functionalism, will convey the impres-
sion of beauty.
Unfortunately, many past and pre-
sent fitting designers did not always
grasp this fundamental truism. Early
designers had difficulties in freeing
themselves from a fitting style of earlier
light sources like candles, kerosene or
gas. This process of belated liberation
apparently will never end as long as
new light sources are being developed
and the markets are still flooded with
those so-called “Early Colonial’’ or
“Victorian” fittings which, let us hope,
will disappear one day.
Good designs began to appear on
the Continent about thirty years ago.
Functional they were and designed for
the then improved incandescent lamp.
Those of good design and craftman-
ship stood the test of time in our
quickly-changing century and are still
considered modern.
This development of incandescent
fixtures is still going on successfully
and parallel with the rise of the fluores-
cent ones.
Orefors in Sweden, Lalique in
France, Zelezny Brod in Czechoslo-
vakia. Murano in Italy (just to name
a few) are all creating chandeliers and
fixtures with glass as the only medium
of expression both for fluorescent and
incandescent lighting. In spite of
many plastic materials, glass has not
been beaten in this field.
Worth mentioning are beautiful
table lamps of French design, not
quite as modern as the American
Spiderleg lamps we have seen here as
the super-modern pricewinners in a
New York competition. But even if
the latter may not conform to-day
with the majority taste, they are worth
watching in their development.
There are several ways to buy light:

commercial lines is one. Individually'
made fittings are usually more costly.
But the third way, we may call it the
grand way, is carefully-planned archi-
tectural lighting. Every good installa-
tion of this kind bears inadvertently
the mark of combined planning by
architect and lighting expert. This co-
operation seems to be achieved in a
few progressive countries, and the re'
suit is an increasing number of good
installations.
Wilhelm Ostwald, the pioneer of
colour systems, suggested once the de'
sign of a “colour organ” on which
people could play colour symphonies.
For lower income groups which could
not afford such an instrument he sug'
gested something like a “colour violin”
instead. The smiling audience would
have been surprised to see only a few
years later such a colour organ install'
ed in the showrooms of the Compagnie
des Lamps Mazda in Paris (1929).
It was a piece of pure light architec'
ture and it was played on a keyboard
like a piano. It produced compositions
of coloured light to the accompanying
music. This . . . toy above utilitarian
things . . . developed through the
years until it became recently the
125,000 dollar Lobby of Light in
Madison Avenue, New York. It con'
sists of a cellular ceiling sloped up for
better display and reaching over three
floors. It may be lighted with a
single colour or else covered with con'
stantly shifting patterns of coloured
squares and stripes. In style with our
modern times there is no human play'
ing it, but the colour symphonies are
canned stuff, produced by switchgear.
At first thought this would appear
as another toy, but the owners of the
building do not think so. They are
spending 10,000 dollars a year to run
it because their building has become
the most talked'about and stared'at in
New York and this certainly means
more money to them in increased
rents.
Modern storelighting is to a high
degree a development of the U.S.A.
as a consequence of their general mer*
chandising achievements. The term
“Dramatic Lighting’ ’is a very popular

catch'cry, much more popular than, for
instance, the term “Eye Comfort,”
which deserves a far wider application.
Modern light architecture as applied
to filling stations and road houses is a
definite trend in the U.S.A.
Of the many kinds of Open Air
Installations only a few unusual ones
should be mentioned.
An interesting street'lighting unit
was recently installed for the first time
in Germany and seems to be becoming
popular. It is a mushroom'shaped
lantern containing 36 Hot Cathode
lamps of 40 Watts each. The lantern
is 9ft. in diameter and mounted 40ft.
high. The lamps are glassed'in and
each lamp with its starter gear is
mounted together into an individual
unit which can be pulled out like a
fuse.
A new way—at least, for us Wes'
terners- —of lighting large city areas has
been adopted in Israel for the square
with the ’bus terminals in Tel Aviv.
In addition to conventional platform
lighting the place is illuminated by
floodlights from rooftops, a system
which was in use before the war in
the main streets and places in Moscow,
Railway marshalling yards are also sue-
cessfully illuminated by floodlights
from high towers. Exhaustive tests
were made in England, using a borrow'
ed barrage balloon first as a carrier for
the reflectors. This system was intro'
duced prior to the war in some parts
of Germany and Czechoslovakia.
Sodium lamps are used to light
ski-runs in U.S.A. and Europe. In a
snow landscape, which is nearly black'
white, a distinction of colours is not
essential. On the other hand, mono'
chromatic light has proved to be ad'
vantageous for split'second observa'
tions.
Switzerland illuminates interesting
features on the Gothardt Line, like
churches, castles, rock formations or
waterfalls with floodlights, as a tourist
attraction more or less as we do in the
Blue Mountains.
In pure utility lighting Holland
and Ger many are making lately an
industrial reflector of an A'shape for
one or two fluorescent lamps. The
shielding angle is much higher than
the usual 20 degrees, rather in the
vicinity of 45 degrees. From Germany
also comes the use of “Blended Light”
(Mercury vapour plus incandescent)
in industrial reflectors equipped with
eggerate louvres.
Some lighting engineers in America
recognised the necessity of noise con-
trol in addition to light control in in'
dustrial and commercial premises. As
both installations are usually on the
ceiling and may clash, they designed a
combination of lighting and noise con'
trol which they sell together.
Daylight Research.
Germany and the U.S.S.R. had
artificial skies for daylight research
before the war. In Moscow they were
even planning to use the dome of their
Zeiss Planetarium as tht biggest arth
ficial sky in the world.
The U.S .A. are tackling daylight
problems in a practical way where it
is most desirable in school design.
Many buildings are being planned with
sun'control devices. The University
of Michigan has a fulhscale experimen'
tal classroom as part of a daylight
laboratory.
From Eastern Europe we have re'
cently not through our fault very
little knowledge. But from past ex'
perience and odds and bits of informa'
tion we are getting now and then we
are nevertheless able to piece a picture
together.
There were modern ELMA lamp
factories before the war in Czecho'
Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. In ad'
dition there were several outsiders in
Czechoslovakia. Leningrad ,the pre'
war lamp manufacturing centre of the
U.S.S.R., claimed then to have 22,000
people employed in the manufacture
of lamps. All these and the original
Osram factory in East Berlin are no
doubt making lamps as good as ours.
The former Osram factory in Prague
is making now hot cathode fluorescent
lamps and another factory made the
first cold cathode fluorescent ones back
in 1936 as a sideline to signs.
Illuminating Engineering Societies
were existing in all countries, except
the U.S.S.R., sponsored by E.L.M.A.
Highest quality lighting glass is still
being made in Czechoslovakia.
From the U.S.S.R. we do not hear
anything now, but since the ’thirties
the W.E.I. Institute in Moscow is the
centre of the entire electrical industry
of the Union with the lighting en'
gineering branch as an essential depart'
ment. There was a large optical re'
search institute at the University in
Leningrad.
The Metropolitan Railway in Mos'
cow r reveals striking application of
modern lighting methods. Every
station is designed in a different style
of architecture and lighting as a result
of the co-operation between architects
and the experts from the W.E.I.
There is every reason to assume
that, like before the war, all lighting
literature is available at least to lead'
ing men in the U.S.S.R. and they
know what is going on in the West.
Together with their own research, and
having a lighting literature of their
own, we must assume that they know
about lighting as much as we do.
How much practical use they make of

their knowledge we do not know.
South America and South Africa
are mainly following the lead of the
great English-speaking countries.
Japan, rebuilt again with the help
of the United States, is mostly in-
fluenced by this country.
This excursion “Round the Globe”
can of course convey just a glimpse
here and there on some outstanding
landmarks. But now the vital ques-
tion arises: Where do we stand?
On this point there are a few gene-
ral remarks only which can be made
here.
Big nations have certain production
advantages over us. An American
lighting designer can readily buy com-
ponents from the shelves of many a
specialist firm in the same way as we
buy lampholders. There are extruded
sections, ornamental castings, moulded
or shaped plastic parts, etc., by the
hundreds. He needs comparatively
little machinery equipment to iurn out
his own creations. We in Australia
have too frequently to put up with
substitutes for what we would like to
use. The fact that we produce in
small quan ities only and are handicap-
ped by lack of materials and resistance
to progress in many quarters of the
trade influences our quality standard
unfavourably. Other small nations, like
Denmark, Sweden, etc., are producing
lighting on a much higher standard of
craftsmanship, design and finish. A
healthy competition there seems to be
responsible for it.
Generally speaking we are not doing
too badly. We are producing in
quantities most modern light sources
and are importing the rest. The world
literature is available to us and, what is
more important, we are making use of
it. Moreover, colleagues from overseas
arc joining our ranks every year and
some of our own members have the
opportunity to go overseas to see for
themselves.
In architectural lighting we are still
struggling for that co-operation with
architects which is an exception rather
than a rule. We are well advanced in
the lighting of stores, factories, offices,
but we are badly behind in the light-
ing of churches, art galleries, railway
stations, hotels, restaurants, etc. Bed
reading lamps are still advertised by
guesthouses as a special attraction, and
many restaurant owners strongly be-
lieve that one footcandle on a dining
table “just creates the right atmos-
phere.”
An open discussion on the attitude
of the lighting trade towards modern
trends would certainly reveal interest-
ing opinions. It cannot possibly be
dealt with here. But two recent
articles in trade journals on salesman-
ship, one from Australia, the other
from U.S.A., showed a marked dif-
ference in attitude: The Australian
stresses prominently the profit motive
first, the American the quality. These
two articles surely do not indicate the
general attitude, but they are certainly
significant.
It is suggested that a discussion on
the question “Where do we stand?”
should take place on the non-partisan
platform of the Illuminating Engineer-
ing Society. It certainly would reveal
many interesting points.

Sir Edward has been outstanding
in his contributions to science and was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics
in 1947.
He is visiting Australia as Presi-
dent of the International Scientific
Radio Union, tjie General Assembly
of which is meeting in Sydney this
week.
The War Memorial Lecture, which
was arranged by the Sydney Univers-
ity Engineering Club, was largely at-
tended, and the speaker held the in-
terest of his audience from start to
finish.
In outlining methods used in the
United Kingdom research. Sir Edward
said it was conducted in the pattern
of a triangle with Government re-
search, industrial research, and univers-
ity research forming the sides of the
triangle. The Government research
was carried out by the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research, of
which the speaker was former Secre-
tary.
“Science and the Public”
In dealing with the subject of his
lecture: “Science and the Public.” Sir
Edward pointed out that in Great
Britain scientists carried out investiga-
tions into the consumption of coal on
behalf of the Ministry of Fuel and
Power, and the result was staggering.
It was found that Britain uses 60
million tons of coal a year for domes'
tic heating, and it was discovered that
the open fire commonly in use possess-
ed a notably low efficiency and that
simple stoves proved to be far more ef-
ficient.
Sir Edward said that Professor
Simonds—a leading authority—forth'
with declared that the immediate abo'
lition of open fires would be one of
the greatest steps towards economic
recovery and said he believed the
British Government could not spend
money more profitably than by in-
stalling stoves in houses.
Professor Simonds estimated that
such a move would save £3O million
worth of fuel a year,” the speaker
added.
“Scientists Perturbed.”
Sir Edward told his audience that
the Englishman’s desire to remain
“warm in front and arctic behind”
had hindered the introduction of the
scheme propounded by Professor Si'
monds.
“Not all problems in an executive
department can be solved on scientific
grounds,” Sir Edward remarked.
Striking a more serious note, the
speaker said that the scientist of today
was seriously perturbed regarding the
way his work had raised international
problems of a far-reaching nature.
In citing the explosion of the first
atom bomb as one of the several
reasons for such perturbation. Sir
Edward commented that the scientist
“cannot be expected to control the
outcome of his work.”

Registration For
N.S.W. Builders
Long Fight Ends in Victory.
The New South Wales Govern-
ment have decided to introduce
legislation to provide for the registra-
tion of builders, thus ending a long
fight which commenced in Sydney in
1909.
The legislation, which has been ap-
provd by Cabinet, is aimed at combat-
ing the activities of “unscrupulous
building contractors.”
Under it builders registering must
lodge a fidelity bond, and only regis-
tered builders will have the right to
■enter into contracts for erecting homes
or other buildings estimated to cost
more than .£5OO.
The Premier, Mr. Cahill, said the
legislation would not interfere with the
operations of owner-builders.
The Master Builders’ Association
and others had urged that builders be
required to register, the Premier con-
tinued.
Hitherto it had been thought that
undue hardship and additional costs
might be created for home-seekers if
builders were allowed to become a
close corporation as a registered body,
but it had become increasingly evident
that unscrupulous building contractors
had been defrauding home-seekers.
Mr. Cahill said Cabinet had agreed
with him that something should be
done to curb the activities of this type
of builder, and afford some protection
for people whose anxiety to get homes
made them vulnerable to exploitation
and who, even if successful in legal
action, might not be able to recover
money paid to dishonest contractors.
This view was endorsed by the
Local Government Association of
N.S.W., the Premier added.
First Mooted in 19Q9.
The question of Registration of
Builders was first mooted in 1909,
when the President of the Master
Builders’ Association of N.S.W., Mr.
H. J. Thompson, introduced the sub-
ject at the Tenth Interstate Conven-
tion of the Federated Master Builders’
Association of Australasia, which open-
ed in Sydney on October 19, 1909.
In presenting a short paper to the
Convention, Mr. Thompson said: “In
taking up the subject of Registration
of Builders, it is more with the idea
of showing that it would be better
for the people and the trade if builders
were registered.
“In dealing with this matter, I am
simply voicing my own opinion in this
paper, which is offered as. a suggestion
for discussion on a subject which is
well-worthy of careful consideration.”
After recounting the endeavours of
the N.S.W. architects to obtain regis-
tration, Mr. Thompson pointed out
that in Germany builders were regis-
tered, “and no man can practice as a
builder unless he has a licence.”
Builder's Point of View.
Mr. Thompson continued: “In deal-
ing with the question from the master
builders’ point of view. I would sug-
gest, first, a few selfish reasons why
we should endeavour to secure regis-
tration.
“In the first place, the builder’s
business is one of the most intricate.
He has to deal with materials and
men, both of which are always chang-
ing. He has, in many cases, a new
architect or clerk of works, and almost
always a new owner on every con-
tract; and he has to handle his mate-
rials and men to carry out works
which are never, under any circum-
stances, twice alike. In addition to
these, he may have to deal personally
with men of nine or ten different
trades, or some of them may be sub-
contractors, over whom he has little
control, but for whose conduct he has
plenty of responsibility . . .
“Beyond all this, he has to keep a
wary eye on the City Building Act,
on the building regulations of any one
of forty-one or more different munici-
palities, the Water and Sewerage
Board, Gas Company, traffic regula-
tions, the Scaffolds and Lifts Acts . . .
“He also has to work to a set of
drawings which are generally drawn
to a very small scale and leave a lot
to the imagination, and to a specifica-
tion which, at all times, leaves a great
deal to the practical knowledge of the
builder, and often does not match ‘on
all fours’ the plans, sections, and eleva-
tions. . . .
“All these troubles and trials a
builder puts up with cheerfully, and
having duly delivered his tender he
possesses his soul in patience until the
architect and the owner decide which
tender to accept, and then the poor
builder finds that he is cut out of the
job by a keener comnetitor than him-
self—possibly an ex-tram conductor or
some other outsider who has been
‘learning’ the trade by doing a little
‘spec’ building. . . .
Why Registration
Is Advisable.
“Under all these circumstances, it
would be small wonder if the builder
asked that some measure of protection
should be extended to him. so that at
least he should not have to suffer the
competition of persons outside the
trade, and that registration and licence
under proper test examination as to
knowledge of the trade should be
necessary to any person desiring to
act or trade as a builder.”
After citing specific instances of
“loopholes” for so'called builders to
do bad constructional work or put in
faulty materials. Mr. Thompson com
tinned:
“In these cases any man can call
himself a builder, borrow, beg, or
steal a plan (or even do without one)
and erect some kind of building in
which human beings will live or trails'
act their daily business, in many an in'
stance without any kind of supervision
whatsoever, and in a large number of
others with so little inspection that it
might just as well be left alone,

Act of Parliament
Necessary.
“In such circumstances the bona-
fide builder, for the sake of his business
reputation, will see to the stability of
his construction and the health, as far
as practicable, of the future inmates;
but what of the man who had no prac-
tical knowledge, no reputation to con-
serve, whose sole idea was to make a
profit?
“Even were he willing to do all that
is necessary for the safety of the
people, he has not the knowledge;
therefore, in the best interests of the
community there should be some sys-
tem of testing the practical knowledge
of every man desiring to call himself
a builder.
“Of course, it is absolutely neces-
sary that an Act of Parliament be
framed for the Registration of
Builders,” Mr. Thompson said, and
suggested that the Federation move
along the same lines as the N.S.W.
Institute of Architects in the matter
of Registration. He then moved:
“That the question of registration of
builders be referred to the committee
appointed to draft a set of model rules
for Builders’ Association, for the pur
pose of collecting information and for-
mulating a plan to secure same.” (Ap
plause.)
First Shot.
Mr. Thompson’s paper and motion
was the first shot in a long, hard fight
for registration. Year after year, inter-
state delegates reported to Convention
the almost unsurmountable difficulties
their Governments placed in the way
of Registration of Builders, and the
various Associations found themselves
thwarted at every turn. In Western
Australia a Registration of Builders
Act has already been passed, and it
will be an accomplished fact in N.S.W.
within the next few weeks.
Australian Master Builders owe
much to Mr. H. J. Thompson, who
first mooted Registration of Builders,
and to the protagonists who kept the
question to the forefront up to the
present day.
FASTER BUILDING IN U.K.
PAYS DIVIDENDS.
Bricklayers working on three-storey-
ed flats for Jarrow-on-Tyne Council,
England, have been laying up to 1500
bricks a day and earning more money
under a scheme that gives them a
share in the money saved by faster
building.
The scheme, started with union ap-
proval, is getting 18 homes built at
record speed. All the men work di-
rectly for the council.
The scheme is this; A section of
work is “priced” at normal labour
costs. If a job priced at £5O is done
for £4O, the men get £8 —or 80 per
cent, of the saving—to share as a
bonus. The other £2 represents a sav-
ing to the council.
The men have regularly been get-
ting a bonus of 25 to 30 per cent, on
top of their wage each week.
According to the Borough Engineer,
a fair average for a bricklayer is to
lay 500 bricks a day, but under the
new scheme the men have been laying
1500 each a day.
The bonus is shared out in propor-
tion to earnings, and has obtained
such excellent results for the council
that other bodies are planning to start
similar schemes.
Security Bonds By
Master Builders
By FLORENCE M. TAYLOR.
Desirable and all as Registration of
Builders has become, as practically the
only way of protecting the owner
against charlatan builders, there is one
thing that needs careful watching. It
is the effect that a one-sided fidelity
bond will have, seeing that a bond is
requested to be lodged by the build'
er, and not a bond of similar or any
amount by the owner.
In the past it was always the buildei
who was called upon to use all his
knowledge and to dip deeply into his
own pocket for money for wages and
materials whilst the owner ran no risk
until an architect’s certificate was pre-
sented for a “progress payment"
which the client must pay on demand
as the work proceeds.
On Government works of any mag-
nitude the builder registers himself
as a bona-fide tenderer, for which
privilege he lodges from £2/2/- to
£ 10/10/- e’re he receives the plans
and specification upon which to base
his prices, the making up of which in-
variably results in days, if not weeks
on major works, of running round to
find out where, and if, materials could
be made available and tradesmen could
be found to do the job.
These matters offered little diffi-
cultv before the war. Then the build-
er, burning the midnight oil, proceed-
ed to make up his bill of quantities
and this meant a prodigous effort on
the part of possibly 20 tenderers, all
engaged in the same process for the
same job.
Thus it will be seen that the builder
was called upon to give time and his
vast knowledge gratuitously and lodge
his money from £2l, or .£2lO for 20
builders at £lO/10/0.
The unsuccessful tenderers could
collect their money after a contract
had been let and the plans had been
returned. This procedure is calculated
to eliminate the number of “frivol-
ous” builders not capable of carrying
out the work.
Private Architects do not collect
any lodgment money from builders
tendering in their offices, but they, in
turn, lodge a small sum of money for
“conditions” under which architectural
competitions for designs for buildings
are called, when they desire to submit
a scheme. Thus capacity to carry out
the work is protected in a way by the
lodgment of a sum of money by those
tendering or competing.
The owner, upon whose property
the builder spends so much of his own

time and money does not lodge a fi'
delity bond. The Architect issues a
“progress payment” from time to
time, and if the owner cannot raise
the money to pay the builder —What
then?
There is always the law, of course.
But it seems that a safer way would
be for the owner to lodge a fidelity
bond, as well as the builder. Thus it
will be seen that here again the build'
er runs all the risk of losing his time,
exercising his knowledge, spending his
money in paying the wages and buy'
ing materials without any provision
for compensation, should the client
fail.
In the case of Building Companies
and quack builders the lodgment of a
sum of money before the work is
started is invariably insisted upon.
It is through quack builders exploit'
ing would'be home'owners and ab'
sconding with the money that the need
for the registration of the legitimate
builder has become so evident.
The Master Builder in the past,
though enquiring into the finances of
the client and assuring himself of his
capacity to pay, rarely makes a request
for the predodgment of a sum of
money. The client has had everything
to gain, with no further worry once
the work is in hand, for every brick
put on the owner’s land automatically
becomes his possession.
There is a lien law protecting the
builder to an extent, but an assurance
of cash previously lodged in the na-
ture of a bond would be more reas'
suring.
Estate Agents, Architects, Doctors,
Dentists, Solicitors, Plumbers, and
Electricians are all registered or licens'
ed, but none of these Professionals or
Tradesmen are called upon to put up
a fidelity bond. If they are recreant
they can be sued by the owner in a
court of law for damages.
The British Medical Association has
a fund, apart from its annual fees of
£7/7A a year, into which all members
pay £ll/11/0 per year, making a total
of £lB/18/0 a year. From this £ll/
11/0, subscriptions to both Federal
and State Medical journals are deduct'
ed and the balance goes into Lloyds
Insurance to hold in compensation for
cases where negligence, or other con'
tingencies, arise by any of their mem'
bers, or to protect their members
where claims by a client are erroneous.
Thus The British Medical Association
has control of its members and can
discipline or assist them where such
action is necessary.
Occasionally one hears of members
being “struck off the rolls” of the
Medical and Legal Professions where
the high standard of ethics insisted
upon by The British Medical Assocfi

ation or the Law Institute has not been
observed. They are very strict about
preserving these high standards. If
a lawyer uses, or absconds with, funds
belonging to his clients, he is sum-
marily dismissed, and not allowed to
practice at his calling again.
In the case of the Master Builders,
a fidelity bond (like the British Med-
ical Association’s Insurance) lodged
with a reputable Insurance Company
could be used to cover all their mem-
bers should they get into difficulties
at law, or conversely, it could be used
for the client suffering from the hands
of a member who may not have con-
formed to the high ethical code and
honorable professional standards in-
sisted upon by the Master Builders’
Association.
The Association thus would exist
for the highest protection of their
members on the one hand and equal
justice for any client, should a mem-
ber of the Master Builders’ Associa-
tion be at fault.
No doubt every Master Builder
who has been enjoying all the protec-
tion that the Master Builders’ Associ-
ation of N.S.W. have afforded them,
will now see the importance and jus-
tice of linking up with this organisa-
tion for their own protection.
Failing this the Bill could doubtless
include a provision whereby individuals
may provide their own fidelity bonds,
but it would be better in the interests
of all Master Builders if the Associa-
tion were made responsible for eve.,'
one.
Strangely, neither the members of
the British Medical Association nor
the Law Institute are called upon to
pay so little to their organisations as
the members of the Master Builders
pay to theirs.
A BOMBED CHURCH
RE-OPENS.
One of the world’s most beautiful
pure Gothic churches—St. Ethelred’s,
in Holburn, central London —has
been re-opened for full use, after re-
construction following bomb damage
nine years ago.
St. Ethelreda’s, dating back 700
years, was known to King Henry
VIII.. and to Sir Thomas More, and
after a chequered history is now Lon-
don’s only Pre-Reformation Church to
be returned to Catholic control.
This is the Church’s second recon-
struction. The first took place in 1874,
when considerable renovations were
done. Now, fully and carefully re-
stored to full religious use, it lacks
only the old great east window dedi-
cated to the English martyrs, which
was shattered when the Nazis blitzed
London in World War 11.
The window has been replaced by a
modern one.

so utterly unsanitary, so obvious a

so dangerous to the health and safety
of mankind, that even free men should
not be permitted to erect and to oc'
cupy it.”

AN APPROACH TO THE ART
OF LIGHTING.
The article appearing in your paper
in July, 1952, by Mr. W. Allen Smith
with the above title brings to the fore
the very old and much-debated ques-
tion of the proper training, classifica-
tion and outlook of those engaged in
that rather loose expression “The
Lighting Profession.” Much of what
Mr. Smith says is true, of course, but
what a confusing picture he paints! I
cannot let it pass without comment
because the wrong impression may in-
advertently be given to many of your
readers who are vitally interested in
this subject.
First of all there seems to be con-
fusion. as so often occurs, in the terms
Engineering, Lighting, Specialist,
7 Engineer and “the engineer-
>ect of lighting.” Mr, Smith
. bly means these to be taken
. r less synonymously, but re-
stricts the term “engineering” in
another part to “the prediction of re-
sults and the translation of theoretical
calculations into practical fact the
emphasis being on measurement and
calculation.” Surely this should in-
clude design of fittings. The design
of fittings is, of course, not restricted
to shape and outward appearance. An
Illuminating Engineering should be a
person capable of designing a lighting
fitting to give predictable lighting re-
sults and at the same time to be
constructed mechanically, electrically,
economically and aesthetically in an
approved and desirable manner. If he
is not actually engaged in such work,
he ought surely to be able at least to
appreciate the requirements of all these
aspects of design. Mr. Smith, while
deploring the lack of this appreciation,
implies, almost in the next breath, that
lighting engineers have it when he
says “those lighting engineers who
have to work with consistently bad
design should mutiny and insist on
standards in accordance with the best
principles of industrial design and
contemporary research.”
It is agreed that appearance
(elegance and simplicity) is sometimes
important but why set up another
Council or Institution to do what the
Illuminating Engineering Society has
been and is still striving to bring
about for over 20 years -- an appre-
ciation of the art and science of Illu-
minating Engineering in their proper
proportions. One must also consider
that, as yet, there is a good deal of
disagreement among those well-
qualified in the aesthetic side as iO
what are the best shapes and propor-
tions and colour combinations to em-
ploy in given surroundings.
The “Illumination” course at the
Sydney Technical College has. since
its inception in 1941, very definitely
included the principle that there must
be a combination of art and psycho-
logy with the basic physical considera-
tions in all successful lighting installa-
tions. The course may not be as com-
prehensive as would be desirable, and
it has never been claimed that the
successful students would, ipso facto,
be qualified Illuminating Engineers at
its conclusion. Even the additional
studies in basic architecture and art,
which Mr. Smith proposes, would not
accomplish this. One must be realistic
in this matter and, after all, the studem
takes a course of study to improve his
or her position. How many positions
are available for those trained as En-
gineers or Architects or Scientists or
Artists with a smattering of the other
subjects? The number of students for
such extended course would, in con-
sequence, be extremely few. Probably
not more than one for every hundred
who would take the first year lectures.
I do not agree that “lighting” is or
will ever be more of art than science,
but it is true that efficient and com-
fortable seeing in factories, offices and
schools covers a great deal more of
our activities than all the other appli-
cations which may be mentioned. Art
is only of greater importance in the
more intimate atmosphere of the home
and some other applications connected
with entertainment and living as op-
posed to working. Even in a large
proportion of these situations an
artistic design of the lighting fittings
or their arrangement is not absolutely
essential provided they are either of
pleasing appearance or unobstrusive.
We should accept the fact that there
are relatively few people who are
artistic, scientific and practical. This
is where I would heartily agree with
Mr. Smith, when he suggests that col-
laboration of all concerned is of the
greatest value. To stimulate inter-
change of ideas on the different aspects
so vital to our work and to encourage
collaboration and appreciation in that
regard from all concerned is the main
expressed purpose of the I.E.S. in
every Australian State, and through
the facilities they provide much more
can be done to improve the technique
and art of our calling.

A.C.T. BUILDING UNIONS’ DETERMINATION No. 5
CONCILIATION COMMISSIONER REFUSES VARIATIONS
MARGINAL RATES AND CONDITIONS TO STAND.
DECISION IMPORTANT TO BUILDING INDUSTRY.
On July 3 and 1 1, 1952, applica-
tions were filed at Canberra for varia-
tions of the Carpenters, Joiners and
Bricklayers’ (A.C.T.) Determination
No. 5 of 1946, in respect of increas-
ed marginal rates and conditions of
employment, before Mr. G. A. Find'
lay. Conciliation Com missioner
(“Construction,” July 30, p. 3).
Appearances.
Mr. J. }. Maloney appeared for the
four individual applicants, Mr. D. F.
Woodhouse for the A.S.C. and J.,
Mr. W. D. Ford for the M.B.A. of
A.C.T., Mr. A. R. Wingfield (Minis-
ter for Interior); Mr. K. M. Ralston
(Minister lui Works); Mr. M. L.
Kelly (Public Service Board), and Mr.
T. J. Black (A.C.T. Employers’ As-
sociation).
Two applications were filed by Pat-
rick Sheehy and M. J. Kent, carpent-
ers, and two by Phillip Sheedy and
F. Stretton, bricklayers, seeking a var-
iation of Determination No. 5 of
1946, as varied to date by increasing
the marginal rates to 15A per week
in the case of the carpenters and brick'
layers.
The A.S.C. and |. also sought an
increase of 15/- in the marginal rates
payable to carpenters and joiners as
specified by Determination No. 5.
Several other variations were also
sought regarding conditions of em-
ployment relating to overtime, meal
money, aged and infirm workers, pref'
erence, time records, posting of De-
termination and notices, and insurance
of tools.
Argument For and Against
Applications.
Considerable argument was advanc-
ed for and against all the applica-
tions, «nd the following questions
arose during the hearing:—
(1) Can a Determination made pur'
suant to the Industrial Board Ordin-
ance, 1936-1949, be varied by a Con'
ciliation Commissioner?
(2) Can individuals apply for a
variation of a Determination so made?
(3) Does the Industrial Board of
Ordinance, 1936'1949, confer a reg-
istration on the 8.W.1.U. of Austra'
lia in the A.C.T.?
(4) Can the Amalgamated Society
of Carpenters and Joiners of Austra-
lia apply for a variation of a Determ-
ination to which it was not a party
when the Determination was made?
Question One.
Dealing with question one in his
Decision, dated August 7, the Com-
missioner said that from May 19, 1949,
Determinations made pursuant to an
amending Ordinance in that year have
been varied from time to time because
of applications by one or other of

the parties in the same way as awards
of Conciliation Commissioners are
dealt with under the Federal Arbitra'
tion Act.
He said that parties to the Determ'
inations have never questioned the
right of Conciliation Commissioner to
vary Determinations made by the In'
dustrial Board, and until such time
as Determinations have been supersed'
ed by an Arbitration Court award, the
Determinations have been varied with'
out concern being expressed by one or
others of the parties.
The Commissioner said he took the
view that any Orders issued by him
since 1949 which had the effect of
varying Determinations must be re'
garded as awards made in accordance
with requirements of the Arbitration
Act ....
“In my opinion, therefore, a Con'
ciliation Commissioner dealing with in'
dustries in the A.C.T. is empowered
to alter a Determination made pur'
suant to the Industrial Board Ordin-
ance, as amended, and I deem it ad'
visable to state that if it is held that
any alterations to Determinations to
this date are ineffective because of a
minute technicality ways and means
may be found to put those alterations
in order," the Commissioner said.
Question Two.
The Decision continues:
“The second question is as to
whether or not individuals can seek
an alteration to a Determination which
applies a common rule in the A.C.T.
“After having heard the parties, I
have come to the conclusion that at
the most any Order arising out of such
applications must be restricted in its
effect to the individual making the ap-
plication, but having regard to the at'
titude of the Court in a recent case
were 1. C. Chandler made applica'
tion to vary an award on his own be'
half in respect of the basic wage in-
crease granted by the Court.
“I do not feel disposed to entertain
these applications made by employees
who are now suffering from the de-
registration of the 8.W.1.U. of Aus-
tralia.”
Question Three.
Dealing with the third question, the
Commissioner states that, in his opin-
ion, the amending Ordinance of 1949
which repealed Sections, including
Section 15, of the Industrial Board
Ordinance destroyed any claim that
the 8.W.1.U. Canberra Branch -
may have to any registration as dis-
tinct from the registration cancelled
by the Federal Arbitration Court in
1948.
Question Four.
In his Decision, the Commissioner
dealt at length with the submissions
of the various Advocates, stating that
Mr. Kelly of the Public Service Board
contended that any alteration arising
out of the application by the A.S.C.
and J. should be confined only to its
members “otherwise the objects of the
deregistration Order issued by the
Court in 1948 would be defeated."
On behalf of the A.S.C. and J.,
Mr. D. F. Woodhouse claimed mem'
bership within the A.C.T. to the ex'
tent of a small number of persons en'
gaged in the industry who had com-
pleted forms of membership. He also
claimed potential members who were
members of the cferegistered B.W.
LW.
“To accede to the claim by this
Union that the Determination should
be varied by increasing the marginal
rate payable to carpenters by 15/' a
week would, the Commissioner said,
extend to persons who were members
of the 8.W.1.W. benefits which the
Court deliberately intended should not
be extended to them. In addition,
bricklayers would be denied similar
benefits because there is no organisa'
tion registered in the Commonwealth
Court to which bricklayers can now
conveniently belong.
“It would be anomalous, therefore,
to confer any benefit on one section
of the de-registered organisation, and
deny the same benefit to others.
“The employers would not agree
that if any increase was granted to
carpenters the same increase should ap'
ply to bricklayers, mainly because the
purpose of the deregistration Order
by the Court would be defeated.
“On this point it is interesting to
note that by negotiation between the
deregistered 8.W.1.U. and Common'
wealth instrumentalities the basic wage
increase of 1950 granted by the Court
was conferred as a benefit to members
of the deregistered organisation not'
withstanding the refusal of the Court
in December, 1950, to vary the Fed-
eral Carpenters and loiners' Award.”
The Decision states that the B.W.
I.U. has also negotiated successfully
with the Department of Works in-
creases for leading-hand bricklayers
and the Department is now paying
over Determination rates . . . which,
in effect, means that members of a de-
registered organisation are privileged
as against all other tradesmen employ-
ed by the Department in the A.C.T..
by being paid rates in excess of those
prescribed by a Determination,

"In this matter Mr. Ralston (for
Minister for Works) makes no secret
of the fact that if any increase is
granted to carpenters because of the
application by the A.S.C. and J. his
department will negotiate with the
bricklayers on the matter of an in'
crease for those employees if they con'
sent to subcontracting.
“In Direct Conflict.”
"Notwithstanding the good indus'
trial record of the Canberra Branch,
8.W.1.U., the actions and statements
by representatives of the Minister of
State for Works are in direct conflict
with the deregistration Order of the
Federal Arbitration Court.”
The Commissioner concludes;
“Apart from all these considera-
tions, however, there is little doubt
that the A.S.C. and J. has no right to
be placed in the privileged position of
being able to take over completely
an established set of wages and condi-
tions which came into being at the in-
stance of some other organisation, and
it appears to me that the Determina-
tion as at present stands should not
be altered because of any of the ap-
plications now before me.”
THE AUSTRALIAN MOTOR
VEHICLE INDUSTRY.
Important Defence Potential.
The motor vehicle industry is now
soundly established in Australia and
has reached a high degree of organisa'
tion and efficiency, according to a
review of the industry prepared by the
Department of National Development.
Manufacturers and assemblers have
long'term plans to expand the pro'
duction of vehicles almost wholly
Australian'inade, and in view of the
wide variety of vehicles required in
Australia it is considered that the in'
dustry is assured of a market for many
years to cpme.
The most striking contribution
which the industry has made to
national production is that it has given
rise to a new high standard of pre'
cision in a large number of engineer'
ing plants and, as a result, has de'
veloped an important additional de-
fence potential.
Plans of the major companies in'
dude additional plant to increase pre'
sent output of engines, gear boxes and
transmission units, particularly those
for heavier cars and for trucks up to
five tons.
60,000 Vehicles a Year.
The four major companies now
manufacturing in Australia are pro'
ducing between them about 60,000
vehicles of substantially local origin a
year. The industry employs 30,000
persons directly, while another 50,000
are employed in associated industries.
Up to March this year, sales of new
vehicles in Australia were running at
the rate of about 200,000 a year; the
accumulated backlog of demand has
now been largely overcome and the
premium on the immediate re-sale of
new cars has in most cases disappeared.
Australia Highly Motorised.
Statistics included in the Review
show that Australia is now one of the
highly'motorised nations in the world,
with 5.5 persons per vehicle compared
with 2.9 persons in the United States,
5.4 persons in Canada and 4.8 persons
in New Zealand.
New South Wales has more vehicles
than any other State, with 34 per cent,
of the total; but South Australia, with
4.52 persons per vehicle, is the most
motorised State.
Victoria has 5.05, Queensland 5.34,
Western Australia 5.38, Tasmania
6.24, and New South Wales 6.35 per'
sons per vehicle.

New Building For
Cumberland Council
To Cost £100,000.
The Cumberland County Council
has approved of plans for a new office
building estimated to cost £lOO,OOO, at
the corner of York Street North and
Gloucester Street, near the Harbour
Bridge.
The new building will have two
and a half floors and a basement
with parking space.
It will be constructed of reinforced
concrete, with glazed terracotta fac'
ings.
A continuous line of windows on
each floor will give maximum natural
light.
The council’s architect, Mr. C. J.
Farrington, of Stafford, Moor & Far'
rington, is preparing specifications and
material quantities for the calling of
tenders.
It is considered that the building
should take from 12 to 14 months to
complete, where previously construe'
tion time would have been two years.
(At present the council’s head of-
fices are in Hyde park kiosk, which
the City Council has condemned. It
is believed that plans are in train to
restore or rebuild the kiosk as soon as
occupancy by the Council is obtain'
ed.)
BRITAIN’S GIFT TO UNITED
NATIONS HEADQUARTERS.
At the invitation of the Secretary'
General, Her Majesty’s Government is
to give to the permanent Headquarters
building of the United Nations the
panelling and furnishings for one of
the committee rooms. This gift was
shipped across the Atlantic for installa'
tion in New York.
The English oak panelling (natural
colour and wax polished) is designed
with horizontal bolection moulded
panels alternating with square fielded
panels, the latter bearing carved motifs
of British fauna and flora.
The furnishings include tables and
chairs in English oak and a green
close'fitted super'saxony Wilton carpet.
The tables consist of an elliptical dele'
gates’ table seating thirty Tour, a sec'
retariat table seating eight, and a con'
ference officers’ table. All the tables
are fitted with loud speakers and for
simultaneous interpretation. The ami'
chairs for the delegates and twenty'
eight small chairs for the Press and
public are covered in blue hide. The
small chairs are also fitted for simul-
taneous interpretation.
THE UMBRELLA HOUSE.
The steel umbrella-like ribs springing from

with red marbles in the cement joints. A
sign on the exterior says “We don’t like
your house cither”.

Architectural Competition
Announced.
It was announced by Mr. Eric
Hughes, F.R.A.1.A., President of the
Royal Victorian Institute of Architects,
at the last Quarterly Chapter Lun-
cheon held on June 25th at the
Trocadero, that an Architectural Com'
petition is to be held for the Olympic
Stadium and other buildings for the
1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne.
Mr. Hughes in characteristic
vigorous style outlined the various
negotiations that have gone on in the
past few weeks to achieve this desir-
able end. It was obvious that the
successful outcome of the campaign to
have the designing of these important
buildings the subject of a competition
were due to the great efforts of Mr.
Hughes and Mr. John Islip, Secretary
of the R.V.1.A., who was also, with
Mrs. Islip, present at the Luncheon.
Mr. Hughes, in outlining the negO'
tiations, said that he had made certain
undertakings on behalf of the profes'
sion and he wanted its whole-hearted
support. The most important factor
was time, and those who desired to
receive conditions were requested to
apply immediately.

Windows are provided with horizontal bands
of concrete which afford a measure of shade
by the depth of their projection. Each unit
has its own balcony and although these are
separated by simple divisions, the horizontal
lines formed by them imparts great character
to the design.

THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE
OF ARCHITECTS.
84th Convention in New York.
After a lapse of twenty'seven years
the American Institute of Architects
last month held its 84th Annual Con'
vention in New York.
The A.LA. was formed in 1857, the
first President being Richard Upjohn,
designer in 1841 of the famous Trinity
Church at the head of Wall Street.
The Institute’s first office and head'
quarters were in Trinity Building
nearby, also the work of Upjohn and
where he had his office at 111 Broad'
way. It was a five'Storey building and
was demolished in 1904.
BUILDING MAINTENANCE.
Rockefeller Centre Policy.
Nelson Rockefeller is quoted in a re'
cent article in “American Magazine”
as follows:
“My father always says it’s the last
five per cent, you put into something
that counts. When most building pro'
jects are finished, the architects are
through, and maintenance and altera'
tions are left to a superintendent.
This must lead to deterioration or a
lowering of standards, so we have a
first'line firm of architects on a re'
tainer. They pass on everything from
sign lettering to structural changes.”
POWER-OPERATED WHEELBARROW.
The Winget “Mechanical Moke” is designed
for effecting economies in concrete placing.
A third wheel surmounted by a motor-cycle
engine takes the place of the labourer but
the whole is controlled by a pedestrian with
much less physical effort. The body is sep-
arately tilted for dumping its contents.
DIESEL-DRIVEN TROLLEY.
This German-built machine, which can be
provided with alternative loading bodies, or
haul trailers carrying light loads, was ex-
hibited at the Leipzig Fair. It is powered
with a 5.6 h.p. diesel engine, and a special
drive may be supplied for working pumps,
winches or circular saws. Its special feature
is its compactness which enables narrow pas-
sages and factory doorways to be negotiated.
On the open road the maximum speed is
about 30 m.p.h. Grades of 8 to 10 per cent,
can be climbed.

SUNSHINE AT ALL COSTS.
It is useless for any architect to attempt to design a house for the 1952 family that doesn’t have a maximum of
window area, for it is the catchcry of the housewife that she must have “plenty of lovely big windows." This
can be achieved in different ways as we see in this series. It can be in the form of large fixed panels broken up
into squares as in the top and bottom left; in long continuous series of windows as in the top right or in lest
orthodox manner as in the bottom right where the panes are sloped inwards. No matter how it is achieved,
however, we must have “plenty of lovely big windows!"
