FOR PROTECTION
FOR PRESERVATION
FOR HIGH REFLECTIVITY
Almost every surface that is exposed to corrosion by salt atmos-
pheres, or the smoke and acidity of industrial regions, can be
protected and preserved by the superior resistant power of
"Alpaste” Aluminium Paint.
"Alpaste” is an aluminium paint pigment in paste form which,
whilst avoiding the drawbacks of powder pigment, retains such
desirable properties as "leafing” and high reflectivity. In addition,
"Alpaste” gives more complete opacity (a layer of only 1/2,000th
of an inch thick will completely obscure the underlying surface,
however dark and dreary). Moreover, "Alpaste” gives 10% to
20% greater coverage power.
"Alpaste” is recommended as a preservative for wood, brickworic,
concrete, aluminium, steel, magnesium, plaster, stucco and asphalt.
Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste”
Paint Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium which, when
mixed with a suitable medium, "leaf” and form an opaque and
"Alpaste’s” high reflectivity and
wherever it is used externally.
Top illustration: View of the plant where
"Alpaste” is produced, showing cyclones
into which atomised powder is drawn.
Lower illustration: This chimney at the
Nantgarrw Coke Ovens, South Wales,
has been finished with "Alpaste” paint
as a protection against fumes evolved in
the carbonisation of coal. Its bright
appearance, which matches perfectly the
asbestos of the conveyor housings, will
be retained for a long time. (Photograph

B.G.E. Lighting Design Centre and the design
staff of Messrs. Nock & Kirby Ltd.
The ceiling, constructed in timber, has 25 in.
square apertures as shown. The original ceiling,
above the timber, is painted dark blue to conceal
pipes and conduits, and is fitted with numerous
--point power outlets.
A special portable 24" square fitting was designed by
the B.G.E. housing 2 x 24" 201 V OSRAM fluorescent
tubes in each fitting and having a louvre fitted at the
base. When fitted to the ceiling the louvre is flush with
the underside of the ceiling grid. A total of 46 units is
installed, each one of which can be moved to any desired
position to suit display requirements.
The floor is surrounded by a pelmet illuminated with
OSRAM 4' 40W fluorescent tubes with B.G.E. fluorescent
auxiliary equipment. The stairs are illuminated at the top
by one B.G.E. 1E446/2L ceiling unit, and at the bottom
and entrance to the floor by two B.G.E. 1E426/2 recessed
units.
The area outside the lift entrance has an indirect cornice

The Australian Institute of Builders
NEW HEADQUARTERS TO BE BUILT IN SYDNEY.
The recently-formed Australian In-
stitute of Builders, with vigorous initi-
ative, has decided to build their own
headquarters building on an attractive
site in Alfred Street, Milsons Point,
overlooking Lavender Bay and con-
veniently situated in relation to Mil-
sons Point Station.
The building is to be a concrete-
framed structure with a lecture hall in
the basement, the main Institute offices
on the ground floor, offices on the
first floor and a caretaker’s flat on the
second floor.
The aim of the Institute has been
to obtain sufficient accommodation to
last them for many years in a building
that will require the minimum of
maintenance.
Piles Creek sandstone has been
chosen as the facing material. The
bronze windows are to be semi-revers-
ible and the spandrils between the
windows are to be faced with sage
green ceramic tiles with white artificial
stone surrounds.
The main entrance has been reces-
sed to follow the slope of the site
boundary and to provide more gener-
ous access. The recessed screen wall
and the entrance doors are to be of
satin finish stainless steel and plate
glass.
Hall To Seat 230.
The Institute offices comprise a large
library, board room. Secretary’s of-
fice, general office and strongroom.
As the site slopes from Alfred Street
to Cliff Street the lecture hall has been
built in the basement with access
fro:ci both streets. Also with com-
mendable initiative the Institute aims
to build a hall to seat about 230 for
professional and technical lectures. It
occupies the full length of the site
with a projection room at the rear and
will be mechanically ventilated and
treated acoustically.
Queensland Maple or Mahogany will
be used for the internal joinery with
terrazzo to lobby and stairs, and wood
parquet or cork tile floors.
The programme is to lav the foun-
dation stone on the 21st lune this
year and to complete the building
within twelve months. Eric W.
Andrew, Architect and Town Planner,
is designing the building.

The Rachel Forster Hospital For Women and Children
NEW OUTPATIENTS’ DEPARTMENT, REDFERN, SYDNEY.
On Wednesday. 16th December,
1953, the new Outpatients’ Depart-
ment of the Rachel Forster Hospital
was opened by The Right Hon. Sir
William McKcll, G.C.M.G., P.C.,
o.c.
The new Department is built on
the North side of the Hospital site
and connected to the main building by
the Administrative Block and has an
area of 25,628 sq. ft., which is ap-
proximately four times that of the
former department.
The building is planned with its
main staircase and lift at its junc-
tion with the Administrative Block in
the South-East corner. On the ground
floor are the main entrance, staircase
and lift lobby, milk bar, general wait-
ing area, the Department’s Adminis-
trative Offices, and Casualty Depart-
ment with ambulance entry.
The first floor for almost its whole
length has a central waiting area
opening from which on both sides
are examination and consulting rooms.
These rooms are connected by medi-
cal corridors to utility rooms. The
corridors are naturally lit and equip-
ped with scrub-ups and fitments, and
allow medical and nursing staff to at-
tend patients without entering the
waiting area. A patient entering an
examination room presses a button
and a visual indicator system indicates
to the staff the room is occupied.
Minor operating theatre, recovery
rooms, dental, eye and ear clinics are
also situated on this floor.
Lower ground floor comprises the
Orthopaedic Clinic, plaster rooms,
physio-therapy, gymnasium, special
clinics, and patients and staff changing
rooms. Air-conditioning and other
mechanical equipment are situated in
a service basement. A new dispen-
sary has been constructed in the low-
er ground floor of the existing path-
ology block across a grass courtyard
to the south of the new outpatients’
department.
Compact Planning.
The design of this new unit is of
particular interest on account of its
compact efficiency, for in a space of
some 200 feet by 45 feet, and three
storeys high, is provided practically
every kind of hospital diagnostic aad
treatment that is available for modern
use. It is designed for the use of
women alone, and the management is
in the care of women doctors.
The building is departmentalised
for many purposes. It contains a com-
plete set of operating and casualty
rooms together with their rooms for
sterilizing, and a place for patients
who may need to spend a little time
there during their recovery. There
are clinics for surgery and medicine,
another for eye treatments, and a
further one where the patients need-
ing it, may be given physical therapy
and heat treatment.
Strong Colours Used.
The pharmacy is, of course, an im-
portant adjunct to an outpatients’ de-
partment. In addition to having all
modern facilities it is a very pleasant
place finished in shades of primrose
and grey. And speaking of colour, this
is perhaps one of the most noticeable
features of the building. It is painted
throughout in very strong shades, this
being decided early in the design of
the building between the management
and the architects. To the reader this
may sound strange, but in fact the
combinations which have been used
by Miss Slade of the architects’ office,
are most satisfying.
The entrance hall is in primrose and
dark blue with trimmings of white.
Other parts of the building, including
the examining and treatment rooms,
are in mist green. The milk bar,
which is provided for those patients
who may have to wait, is in grey and
yellow with a row of cherry topped
seats.
The street front has a “brise-soleil”
which is in effect a series of vertical
and horizontal sun shades to help re-
duce the load on the air-conditioning
system with which the building is
equipped throughout. The effect is
novel and quite striking.
Between the shades, vitreous enam-
elled panels in biscuit and royal blue
—the hospital colours —are used on

the surfaces to eliminate the need for
constant repainting. It is an interest'
ing adjunct to an interesting hospital.
Construction.
The structure consists of a reinforc'
ed concrete frame and floors. To
Albert Street facing north, the build-
ing is faced with porcelain enamel
sheets in blue, cream, and maroon.
The windows are recessed back be-
tween concrete ribs for sun protec-
tion, and the space between the win-
dows, faced with the porcelain sheets,
forms a duct for service pipes and
controls. The remaining elevations
are of reddish brown brick. The in-
ternal partitions are of terracotta
block.
Internally waiting areas, corridors,
and other noisy spaces have sound-
absorbent ceilings. The main entrance
and lift lobbies have rubber floors in
blue and grey squares, and remaining
floors being covered in marbled lino-
leum; the staircases and service
rooms have terrazzo and granolithic
floors.
Extensive Air Conditioning.
The department is fully air-condi-
tioned. Fluorescent lighting is pro-
vided in waiting areas, gymnasium and
offices, and special lights are installed
in all examination rooms. In addition
to the passenger lift, a dumb-waiter
serves each floor for medical records
and supplies. Steam and hot water
are provided from the existing boiler
house.
Leighton Irwin and Company, of
Sydney and Melbourne, were the
architects, the Master Builders con-
nected with the work were H. W.
Thompson Pty. Ltd., builders; Otis
Elevator Co., lifts; Grace Bros., lino-
leum flooring.
ROYAL VISIT
COMMEMORATION BRICKS
MaDe in Victoria.
A simple thought by one of the
youngest members of the clay products
industry in Victoria was responsible
for what is believed to be a unique
innovation the production of a
‘‘Royal Brick.”
Barry Walters, son of Mr. A. M.
Walters, managing director of Glen
Iris Brick. Tile and Terra Cotta Co.
Pty. Ltd., decided that he would like
the company to do something special
to mark the visit of Queen Elizabeth
and the Duke of Edinburgh to Mel'
bourne.
He conceived the idea of the in'
elusion in the recessed side of the
brick of a Crown with the letters E.R.
on either side and the figures 1954.
The suggestion was immediately
adopted and during the period of the
Royal Visit the Thornbury, Temple'
stowe and Oakleigh plants of the com'
pany were each turning out 20,000
Royal Bricks a day.
Designing and manufacture of the
die were a rush job and were com'
pleted within a fortnight.
The innovation had surprising re'
suits, the office being inundated with
applications from people wishing to
add a Royal Brick to their stock of
souvenirs of the Queen’s presence.
The uses to which they were to be
put apparently were without limit and
they were wanted for incorporation
in walls of new buildings, for use
(polished) as book ends, door stops,
fireplace surrounds, and many other
purposes.

THE GEODOSIC DOME HOUSE.
Mr. Buckminster Fuller several years ago
caused great interest with his circular metal
house. He now has a new one known as
the Geodosic Dome House, which has a
framework of aluminium tubes and is covered
by a weatherproof plastic, transparent skin.

CRANBROOK’S WAR MEMORIAL BUILDING
MODERN ASSEMBLY HALL OPENED BY SIR LESLIE MORSHEAD.
The opening of the fine War Mem'
orial Building at Cranbrook School,
Sydney, marks the completion of one
of the first such blocks that are being
erected by Australian schools to com'
memorate former pupils who served
in World War 11.
It is hard to imagine a more fitting
memorial than this in which the ex'
ample of those who have gone before
lives on as an inspiration to those
who follow.
Opening and Dedication.
The hall was officially opened and
dedicated on Sunday, 30th November,
1953, by Lieutenant' General Sir
Leslie Morshead, K.C.8., K.8.E.,
C.M.G., D. 5.0., E.D., in the pres'
ence of the Most Reverend H. M. K.
Mowll, D.D., Lord Archbishop of
Sydney, the Hon. K. W. Street, Chief
Justice of N.S.W., President of the
School; members of the School Coum
cil and the School War Memorial
Fund Comittee; the President of the
Old Cranbrookians’ Association, Mr.
C. A. Ord; Lieut.'Cdr. J. Austin,
D. R.A.N., Lt.'Col. I. M. Hunt'
er,, M.8.E., Old Boy representatives
of the Navy and Army respectively;
His Worship the Mayor of Wool!'
ahra, Alderman C. W. Davies; and a
large gathering of parents, Old Boys
and friends of the school.
The President of the School, the
Hon. K. W. Street, said that the day
was a momentous occasion in the life
of Cranbrook. It marked the end
of a dream —the realisation of a long'
felt need. The Hall began as an
act of faith and that faith had been
fully justified. In paying a tribute
to all by whose gifts and work the
building of the Hall had been made
possible, he said that they had work'
ed for posterity as well as for the
present generation of Cranbrookians,
but that in itself was part of their
reward.
Greetings From England
and America.
The President then read messages
received one from the Head'
master of Cranbrook School, Kent,
England, and the other from the
Headmaster of Cranbrook School,
Michigan, U.S.A., conveying greet'
ings on the occasion of the com'
pletion of the building, and good
wishes for future prosperity and fame.
After unveiling the commemorative
tablet, before which members of the
Naval and Military Cadets had been
on guard, Sir Leslie Morshead said;
“On occasions such as this, when
we assemble to do honour to the
memory of those who gave their lives
for their country—the greatest com
tribution and the highest sacrifice any
man can make—we are filled with
feelings of heartfelt remembrance and
pride and with an awareness of our
own and of the nation’s debt to them.
This very fine Hall, which will serve
so many useful purposes and which
perpetuates the memory of those Old
Boys who gave their lives in the War
and commemorates the service of those
other Old Boys who served, is an im
finitely more appropriate memorial
than the finest sculpturing can fash'
ion. It is a memorial which those
who died would have approved . . .
“To the boys of the School I
should like to say this: When you
look round the tops of the walls and
see inscribed the names of the major
battles in which Old Cranbrookians
fought and also the world'wide areas
in which they operated, you will have
a continual reminder of the magni'
tude of the War in which they were
engaged. Those Old Cranbrookians
belonged to a truly great brother'

hood, membership of which demand-
cd courage, faithfulness, determina-
tion, loyalty, and discipline in its
truest sense not imposed but accept-
ed. All this brought about a team
spirit of the highest degree.
“Your School inculcates these qual-
ities that those Old Boys possessed,
and the more you practise them the
better and happier men you will be-
come. My experience in the field in
both Wars taught me to have the
utmost faith in my countrymen. In
the first War, 1914-18, the Austra-
lians covered themselves with glory.
The Second A.I.F. proved themselves
at least their equal, and the same
standard has been maintained in
Korea. If by any misfortune there
should be another conflict, the new
generation will fully emulate the deeds
of their fathers and grandfathers.
Every now and then, when occupying
this Hall, pause and recall what it
stands for.”
Motto on the Foundation Stone.
As part of the inscription on the
Foundation Stone of the War Mem-
orial Hall is a line from the Latin
poet Horace:
Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis
which may be rendered, “Gallant sons
spring from the gallant and the
good,” suggesting that gallantry and
strength is a tradition, growing from
blood and environment. This line
was chosen as a motto in the belief
that Cranbrook fosters a tradition of
service to the State and to humanity.
The Building Described.
The War Memorial building is the
major portion of the scheme as ap-
proved by the School Council and
the War Memorial Fund Committee
in January, 1952. The Assembly Hall,
82 feet by 36 feet, occupies the up-
per floor and will seat 500 persons.
The stage is seventeen feet deep, in
addition to a curved forestage project-
ing five feet in front of the proscen-
ium opening and a dais on either side
intended for a grand piano and lectern
respectively. These will lend them-
selves to open stage presentations of
Shakespearean plays and pageants.
In the lower ground floor are the
Art Studio, Music Room, a room for
the Director of Music, Music and Art
Library, Armoury, a small shower
room and storage space.
Spacious Terrace.
A feature of the building is the
north terrace, 75 feet by 12 feet,
overlooking the Hordern Oval. To
this and to the paved area on the
south side open the five large win-
dow-doors, through which overflow
audiences may be catered for.
The northern end of the building is
left unfinished for in the completed
scheme a curved wing will connect it
with the Gymnasium. This wing will
include, on the main floor, the Mem-
orial Vestibule, cloak rooms, and a
caretaker’s quarters; on the first floor,
the cinematographic projection room
and roof terrace; and on the lower
floor a kitchen (with a food lift to
the Hall), masters’ change room and
a games room. In the centre will be
an archway leading to a curved flight
of steps which will connect the upper
and lower levels on the line of the
principal pedestrian traffic route from
the main school buildings to the oval.
The Memorial Hall is therefore in
the “heart of the School,” with an
unrivalled view of the Harbour on
the one side and pleasant vistas of the
original buildings on the other. To
obtain this result on a steep and sandy

site considerable problems in planning
and construction were involved. Over
1,500 cubic yards of sand were exca-
vated from the side of the hill and ex-
tensive reinforced concrete retaining
walls were necessary.
The walls are of brick construction,
the major section being an 11-inch cav-
ity with a 2ft. Sin. by 9in. internal
piers. The face bricks are Northern
Suburbs light buff, built in English
bond with a recessed cream loint.
The main roof has bent rolled steel
joist principals and is covered with
Marseilles tiles of a colour which is
midway between the slates and tiles
of the buildings above and below. The
zinc sprayed steel windows and doors
are screwed to hardwood frames.
The Assembly Hall.
The walls of the Assembly Hall are
cement rendered with a sanded finish
coloured grey. The proscenium sur-
round, the panelling on either side,
and other joinery is in Queensland
maple. The rear wall above seven
feet is covered with acoustic tiles
backed with felt and finished with
ribs of Queensland maple, the large
central panels and shallow beam soffits
are of fibrous plaster, while the 3ft.
square panels of the sloping sections
are alternately Cane-ite and Cane-ite
acoustic tiles. The ceiling is coloured
in shades of terracotta and grey.
Principal Campaigns.
On the cornice are inscribed in gold
letters the names of the principal
campaigns and battles of the 1939-45
War. For the compilation of this
list, the School is indebted to the
Official War Historian, Mr. Gavin
Long. Of special decorative interest
are the richly coloured shields, which
are placed immediately below the
cornice. On the sides these bear the
coats-of-arms of the nations of the
British Commonwealth and of the al-
lied countries in the forces of which
Old Cranbrookians served. Above the
proscenium opening the badges of
Cranbrook School, Kent, and Cran-
brook School, Michigan, flank the
School badge and are linked by a gilt
scroll bearing the School motto; “Esse
Quam Videri.’’
These shields were painted by fif-
teen boys of the School in correct
heraldic colours to the designs of the
architect and under the direction of
Mr. Justin O’Brien. The design of
the six hexagonal light fittings is bas-
ed on those in the War Memorial
Room at Wellington College, England.
Colour Scheme.
The colour scheme is completed by
the metal chairs finished in smoky
blue and the plain velvet stage cur-
tains of the same colour. The Com-
memorative Tablet takes the form of
a panel of sandstone with lettering
incised and gilded with the badges of
the three services carved in low re'
lief. This occupies the position of
the future main doorway and will be
re-built into the opposite wall of the
vestibule when the latter is erected.
Although, on the grounds of econ-
omy, the paintwork is mostly water
paint and kalsomine, interesting colour
schemes have been obtained through-
out. In the lower ground floor there
have been used shades of grey, green,
yellow, cinnamon, with doors of coral
red and accents of grey-blue and char-
treuse. Mrs. Hall-Best assisted as hon-
orary colour consultant.
The building was designed by and
erected under the supervision of
Messrs. Fowell, Mansfield and Mac-
lurcan, FF./AA.R.1.8.A., architects.
The Master Builders were T. C.
Whittle Pty. Ltd. The professional
consultants were: Messrs. Woolacott,
Hale and Bond, Structural Engineers;
Mr. J. M. Dunningham, Quantity
Surveyor; and Mr. D. Wrigley,
acoustical consultant for the Assembly
Hall.

NEW P. & O. LINER "ARCADIA"
MAIDEN VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA.
The P. &? O. liner which was
launched on 14th May, 1953, and
was recently in Sydney on her maiden
voyage, was given the ‘"happy” name
of “Arcadia.”
Arcadia was, and still is a district
in Greece, and has come to stand for
an ideal region, far from crowded
towns, free from troubles and full of
peace and contentment —the perfect
name, in fact, for a passenger ship.
The vessel bears a resemblance in
main dimensions to the “Himalaya,”
which has since 1949 proved very
popular on the Company’s Australian
run. She has a service speed of 22
knots.
The main difference in the appear'
ance of the “Arcadia” is the installa'
tion of a special funnel of the “Clyde'
bank” type in order to obtain satis'
factory smoke clearance from the up-
per decks, and a mainmast in addition
to the foremast.
Impressive Dimensions.
Of approximately 29,734 tons, the
“Arcadia” is 718’ in overall length
and 90’ 6” in breadth, with a load
draft of 30’ 3”. She has accommoda'
tion for 670 first class passengers in
one, two and three'berth cabins, in'
eluding eight two'berth cabins'deduxe.
In the tourist class, 735 passengers are
carried in two, four and six'berth cab'
ins. The deadweight cargo capacity
will be approximately 6,150 tons, of
which 3,500 tons will be available for
the carriage of frozen cargo.
Stabilizers Fitted.
To minimize rolling in heavy seas,
the vessel is fitted with Denny'Brown
o
stabilizers of the type first used so sue'
cessfully on the P. 6? O. “Chusan.”
Single reduction turbines (except
H.P.’s which are double reduction) de'
veloping 42,500 S.H.P. maximum are
installed, also three Foster Wheeler
boilers each capable of 165,000 lb. of
steam per hour, and a comprehensive
distilling plant capable of producing
500 tons of fresh water per day.
There is an observation lounge on
the boat deck, but the majority of the
first class public rooms, comprising
the nursery and children's playground,
library, writing rooms, the lounge, the
verandah cafe and the swimming pool
cafe are on the promenade deck, to'
gether with the swimming pool itself.
There is also a dance floor, adaptable
when required for cinema shows.
Extensive Air-conditioning.
The “Arcadia” was built for the
P. 6? O. by Messrs. John Brown &
Co. (Clydebank) Ltd., at their Clyde'
bank shipyard, whilst a sister ship,
the “Iberia,” under construction at
Harland 6? Wolff’s yard at Queen’s
Island, Belfast, is expected to be ready
for launching shortly.
The “Arcadia” is the second vessel
of that name to be built for the P. 6?
O. Company, the first being one of the
famous “Jubilee” class of 1887/8:
with her sister ships, the “Victoria.”
‘"Britannia,” and “Oceana,” they were
“crack” vessels of those days, and
the “Arcadia” which was 6,600 tons
gross was well'known in Australian
waters and later in the East. She was
broken'up soon after the start of the
First World War. There must be
some who will remember travelling in
her.
Modem Furnishings and
Decorations.
The “Arcadia” has been furnished
and decorated by Messrs. A. Mclnnes
Gardner, of Glasgow, and the result is
colourful and attractive, but not ultra'
modern in style.
The public rooms —there are nine
in the first class and seven in the
tourist — have been planned with the
thought always in mind that they are
to be the passengers’ home for a
month, to be lived in and with, not
just seen for a day and then forgotten.
The result is a pleasant but in no way
discordant, combination of traditional
and contemporary design.
The first class public rooms consist
of an observation lounge on the boat
deck and the nursery, library, writing
rooms, lounge, verandah cafe and pool
cafe on the promenade deck.
The Observation Lounge.
The most interesting room, since it
is unique among vessels engaged in
the Australian trade, is the observation
lounge, which is situated at the for-
ward end of the boat deck, iramedi'
ately below the bridge. Large win'
dows have been set into the walls on
three sides of the room, and comfort'
able armchairs with footrests have
been placed looking outward through
them; on the fourth wall there is a
bar counter decorated on each side
with a representation of a figurehead

based on actual models of old wooden
sailing ships. There are two wall
panels on either side of the doorway
leading to the entrance hall, one de-
picting the company’s original little
ship “William Fawcett” accompanied
by the first vessel in the fleet to be
called “Arcadia,” and the other show*
ing the “Cutty Sark.” one of the
loveliest clipper ships. On a central
table are terrestial and celestial globes,
while the floor covering has been
carried out in a design featuring maps
of the two hemispheres.
The children’s nursery has been
placed well forward on the promenade
deck, and is interesting because it has
a central division to enable the hostess
to separate children of differing ages.
Walls are covered in plastic sheeting
and decorated with amusing motifs
by Margot Gilbert. There is a mini'
ature cottage in one part and toys
will include a chute, merry-go-rounds
and pedal cars, while the furniture,
which has been especially designed, is
covered in gay printed linens.
The library is centrally situated and
is open to the main foyer, a pillared
and balustrated barrier forming the
only division. The panelling is laid
horizontally on either side of the win-
dows, being faced with toned honey
sycamore enriched with bas-relief
carvings designed by Donald Gilbert.
Stripey Elm and ice Coral Birch are
used to relieve and accentuate the syc-
amore.
The Lounge.
Aft of the foyer wide entrance
doors open into the lounge. This is a
large high room with windows on
either side, including a central bay re-
cess. The central section of the ceil-
ing is circular in shape with a panelled
perimeter and the remaining parts of
the ceiling are divided into similar
panels, all arranged to carry concealed
lighting for general illumination. The
most exciting feature of the lounge is
in the form of a wide, deep mural by
Mr. Herach based on an American
scene and designed in a rythmic se-
quence from end to end in low colour
tones.
Panelling is carried out in Canad-
ian Mottled Maple contrasted with
Elm and Honey Sycamore, relieved
by feature work in ice Coral Birch,
cut mirrors and matt silver bronze.
The dance floor is immediately aft
of the lounge, and stretches the full
width of the ship. Aft, doors at
either side lead to the verandah
cafe, which serves the first class
as the main bar and smoking
room. The main panelling of the
room is in vertical figured Olive Ash
and Birds-eye Maple with teak trim.
Hardwood furniture is covered in three
colours of leather, and heavy curtains

at the rear of the showroom is a brick
structure with a concrete floor and
timber sawtooth roof, giving an even
and adequate light throughout the
whole day.
Reflectionless Windows.
The cantilevered awning over the
footpath right across the showroom
is constructed of reinforced concrete
and the glass show window slopes at
an angle to eliminate reflections of the
images of passing vehicles. In other
words a person sitting in a car and
travelling up or down the road who
wishes to look into the window is en-
abled to look straight through the
window at the goods instead of what is
usually the case, looking at himself
or an image of his car going along
the road. In addition it creates ar-
chitectural interest and catches the
eye of passers-by which causes them
to stop and look at the goods display-
ed.
The flooring in the showroom is of
tallow-wood parquetry in a herring-
bone pattern. The inside walls are
cement rendered and painted pastel
shades.
Provision has been made for the
stairs to lead up to the first storey,
and the main entrance to the stairs
will be off the road between the fac-
tory and the showroom on the west
side of the building. Also on the west
side of the showroom is a group of
four windows with hopper-type sashes
which are surrounded by a cement
rendered brick architrave forming a
frame and the whole is shaded by ver-
tical timber louvres to eliminate di-
rect westerly sun rays particularly in
the summer afternoons. All windows
throughout the factory are of a sim-
ilar hopper type timber frame.
At the moment the offices are situ-
ated on the west end of the show-
room. The partitions between the of-
fices are constructed of Queensland
Maple panelling, and are made in such
a manner as to enable easy dismantling
and reassembling on the future upper

THE NEW "ORSOVA"
ORIENT’S LATEST AND FASTEST.
Maiden Voyage to Australia.
The new Orient 29,000-ton liner
“Orsova” recently in Australian ports
on her maiden voyage, is the Com-
pany’s latest and fastest.
“Orsova” is the second Orient liner
to be so called and follows the Com-
pany’s practice of starting its ships'
names with the letters “OR,” and of
repeating the names of favourite earlier
vessels. “Orsova I” was built in 1909
and remained in service until 1936,
having completed 70 round voyages to
Australia.
Built by Messrs. Vickers-Armstrongs
Ltd., Barrow -on - Furness, the new
“Orsova” was launched on 14th May.
1953, by Lady Anderson, wife of Sir
Colin Anderson, a Director of the
Orient Line.
No Masts.
“Orsova” is the first ship of any
importance to have faced the fact that
the conventional mast is often nowa-
days something of an anachronism,
and she has no mast in the conven-
tional sense of the word.
The funnel, which has been rigged
to carry the wireless aerials and hal-
yards, like so many fashionable fun-
nels of to-day, has taken unto its top
a new form, which has the functional
purpose of dealing with smoke and
smuts so they will be as little noticed
as possible down below. If its name
is asked for, it has been called the
Welsh Hat. Some may lament the
disappearance of a formal mast and a
traditional funnel; they will hardly
cavil at the clean clipper-like lines of
bow and stern.
The added curve of her bow not
only gives additional grace, but it adds
deck space and gives improved sea*
keeping qualities.
Interior Design.
This is the fifth large passenger
liner for the Orient Line in which the
responsibility for the interior decora'
tion has been in the hands of E. Brian
O’Rorke, A.R.A., F.R.1.8.A. He has
been assisted by John Wright,
A.R.1.8.A., A.A.Dipl.Hons.
The aim of the design within has
been to go as far as possible towards
a practical interior design (from the
point of view of durability and general
seaworthiness), which, at the same

Photograph taken during her speed trials when over the measured mile, a speed of
26.068 knots was achieved, thus making her the fastest ship on the England-Australia
trade. The ship was built by Vickers-Armstrong Ltd. at Barrow-in-Furness.

time, secures, either by the use of
colours or of textures, that element of
“delight” which alone can change a
mere decorated area into a distinctive
room. It has not been the aim to
produce the kind of room which in
the past earned for all liners, apparent-
ly for the rest of time, the title
“Luxury Liner.” The keynote of
“Orsova” is the luxury of unfussiness,
of clean lines and suitable materials.
There are eight main decks available
for passengers, designated by letters
from “A” downwards.
Cost £A. ”500,000.
“Orsova” cost £A. 7,500,000, as com-
pared to £A.5,500,000 for the 28,000
tons (gross) “Oronsay.” Her size is
29,000 tons (gross) and 32,000 tons
(displacement). Engines are twin tur-
bine, 42,500 shaft horsepower, pro-
ducing a service speed of knots
with a maximum of 26.068 knots,
which makes her the fastest ship in
England/Australia trade.
The hull is all-welded, with a clipper
bow and a counter stern. Only 40,000
rivets are used in “Orsova” compared
to 2,000,000 in “Oronsay.”
Cargo capacity is 291,000 cubic feet
and for cargo handling samson pasts
that carry the derricks have been in-
creased in size to carry the topping
lifts inside. This means the only rig-
ging visible is the single wire span
from the top of a samson post to the
the tip of the derrick. The derricks
themselves are rigged by low-power
electric winches to save time in port.
The whole of one hold has been allot-
ted to baggage and is serviced by lifts
for speedy loading and unloading.
Accommodation ladders made of
light alloy can be lowered automatic-
ally to required position or angle and
then telescoped out automatically. In
addition, “Orsova” carries her own
light alloy pontoons, which can be
lowered over the side at cruising ports
of call and use das landing stages.
Eight of the nineteen boats are de-
signed to make the “Orsova” virtually
independent of shore facilities at cruis-
ing ports.
1498 Passengers.
Carrying capacity is: First class, 685;
Tourist “B” class, 813; total, 1498.
Air-conditioning is extensively used
in the public rooms, two swimming
pools and in the three sheltered games
areas in the first class.
The “Flat,” comprising sitting room,
double bedroom, pantry with refrigera-
tor, crockery and glassware storage
space, bathroom with separate shower
and drying room, toilet and box room,
is all air-conditioned.
There are eleven special staterooms.

CIVIL DEFENCE CENTRES.
Underground Buildings Constructed.
Considerable progress is being made
in the Home Office scheme for estab'
lishing a network of Civil Defence
report and control centres throughout
the highly'populated areas of Britain,
and of the hundreds of such buildings
scheduled for construction —there are
to be more than 100 in London alone
—a number are now completed and
fully equipped.
These underground buildings incor'
porate large control rooms, kitchens
and sleeping quarters, and each has a
plant room with stand-by generating
set or sets and switchboard, which
take over electricity supply in a case
of emergency.
Typical of these C.D. nerve centres
is the one at Paddington Green, West
London, which was opened recently
by the Home Secretary. Apart from
the entrance, only two concrete ven-
tilation shafts can be seen abov ground
level, but it occupies an underground
space equivalent to a three'bedroom
house.
In order to meet every possible con'
tingency, a comprehensive heating,
ventilation and emergency generator
plant has been installed, and two fans
are provided, each capable of deliver'
ing 1000 c.f.m.
Special Ventilation Fans.
One, for normal ventilation, draws
fresh air from a 30ft. high intake
shaft, with a throwaway type cotton
wool filter. The other is brought into
use in the event of gas attack and is
capable of handling the required air
volume against the greater resistance
of the gas filters. Each fan has dupli'
cate motors and starters.
Emergency Power Plant.
Mains electricity for heating, light'
ing, cooking, and driving the exhaust
fans is controlled from a switchgear
panel, but in the event of a break'
down, essential power is supplied by
a generating set. This comprises a
Lister FR2 diesel engine, developing
16 h.p. at 1500 r.p.m., direct'coupled
to a generator with an output of 8.5
k.W at 400 volts, three'phase, 50
cycles.
An interesting method of cooling
for the diesel engine is employed. In'
stead of the conventional radiator, a
special radiator is designed to fit into
a gaslight duct with an aerofoil fan,
drawing air from the intake shaft of
the building. Similarly, the exhaust
is led into the cooling air discharge
shaft.

ferro-concrete provides many
examples of improved lighting
facilities and more uninterrupt-
ed useful space through the
absence of internal supports.

of Builders
Inaugural Dinner of S.A. Chapter.
There was an attendance of 37 at
the Inaugural Dinner of the South
Australian Chapter, Australian Insti-
tute of Builders, which was held in
Adelaide on February 22.
The following official guests at-
tended:—
Messrs. J. S. Walker (Superinten-
dent of Technical Education), S. M.
Siddall (Architect-in-Chief, South Aus-
tralian Government), G. Walkley
(Head of the Architectural and Build'
ing School), W. J. Sedgley (Chief
Architect and Engineer, City of Ade-
laide), F. A. Haas (Secretary, Insti-
tute of Engineers), L. L. Ewens (Sec-
retary, S.A, Institute of Architects),
B. O. Galloway (Secretary, S.A.
Builders and Contractors’ Association),
and Mr. Jim Richards (Northern Ter-
ritory Master Builder).
Big Building Projects
The principal speaker was The Hon.
G. S. Hincks, M.P., Minister for
Lands for the State Government of
South Australia, who outlined the
necessity for a balanced economy in
our State and the part that the build-
ing industry played to support the
primary industries. He spoke of many
big projects in building which have
been carried out in the State of South
Australia and which have aided and
have been necessary for the primary
industries which are of so much im-
portance to our State economy. Some
of these were the building of roads,
bridges, power-houses, water pipelines
and, just lately, the constructing of the
largest sulphuric acid plant in Aus-
tralia for the purpose of manufactur-
ing superphosphate.
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook, the Federal
President, spoke on the aims and ob-
jects of the Institute of Builders and
stressed upon its members the respon-
sibility of membership in putting the
building industry on a sound footing
in technical and educational spheres,
Mr. Hornibrook also outlined the high-
lights of his recent trip abroad.
Unique Occasion.
Mr. W. T. Haslam, the President
of the S.A. Institute of Architects and
the Director of Works in South Aus-
tralia, congratulated the Institute on
its foundation and stated that it was a
long-wanted need in the building in-
dustry He considered this a unique
occasion as it was the Foundation Din-
ner of something which he hoped
would leave its mark in the industry
for years to come. Mr. Haslam also
congratulated the Institute on the
establishment of the Building Foremen
and Clerk of Works Course and the
Master Builder’s Certificate Course in
the S,A. School of Mines and Indus-
tries.
Mr. R. W. Parsons, the Principal of
the S.A. School of Mines, in respond-
ing to the toast of “Our Guests,” also
congratulated the Institute on the
establishment of the courses, and he
intimated that the enrolments for these
courses were very encouraging and the
S.A. School of Mines and Industries
were very happy that these had been
instituted and that his School would
do everything to foster it in the years
to come.
77 MILES OF CABLE.
British Columbia is installing 77
miles of 132 k.V gas-pressure type
cable to be laid across Georgia Strait
and to convey power from the main-
land to Vancouver Island. The cable
will be made by British Insulated Cal-
lender’s Cable Ltd. The route includes
continuous lengths of cables, each
about 17 miles, laid under water at
depths of 600 feet. Four single-core
cable (three for use, one for reserve)
will transmit approximately 150,000
horsepower. The weight of the cable
will be over 3000 tons.
SYDNEY NEWSLETTER
NEW CITY BUILDINGS.
Three New Office Blocks Planned.
The long-awaited impetus to office
building in Sydney appears to be at
hand, with details just announced of
three large city business blocks.
The total amount involved is over
£3,550,000.
The buildings proposed are:
Two blocks of Commonwealth
offices; one in Phillip Street, the
other in Yurong Street.
Counsel’s Chambers, Phillip Street,
for the N.S.W. Bar Association.
The Parliamentary Works Commit-
tee last week recommended that blocks
of Commonwealth offices should be
erected in Phillip Street, between Bent
and Hunter Streets, and also on the
site of the old Palladium building in
Yurong Street.
To Cost £3,050,000.
The Committee said the Phillip
Street site was the most favourable for
Commonwealth offices and recom-
mended that a building should be con-
structed with all speed to house the
maximum number of people possible
in relation to the flow space index.
The present intention is to build a
multi - storey, steel - framed structure
costing about £3050,000.
The Phillip Street site is at present
bounded by Bent, Phillip and Hunter
Streets, and on the western boundary
by other properties.
The City Council plans to extend
Elizabeth Street through to the junc-
tion of Phillip and Bent Streets. This
would make an additional area avail-
able to the Commonwealth. The total
area would then be about \\ acres.
Not Large Enough.
The Committee reported that the
Phillip Street site would not be large
enough to accommodate all the Com-
monwealth employees requiring office
space. It believes that additional land
near the Phillip Street site could be
obtained.
“Commonwealth Centre.”
The Committee said the Government
should endeavour to negotiate the pur'
•chase of a suitable property so that a
“Commonwealth Centre” could be
built between Hunter Street and Cir-
cular Quay.
To ease the immediate demand for
office space, the Committee suggested
that the Government should erect a
building on the site of the old Pah
ladium building, Yurong Street, to ac-
commodate some 1350 people. The
present Gommonwealth'owned building
is housing about 250 employees.
A new building on this site appeared
to be the quickest and most satisfac-
tory means of alleviating the present
position, the Committee said.
The Phillip Street project should be
completed by about 1960. The Pal-
ladium building will take about 2 \
years to erect.
Scattered Departments,
At present Commonwealth depart-
ments in Sydney are in 26 different
buildings, widely dispersed over the
city. Many of the buildings are leased
from private owners and are unsuitable
for offices.
Of the 8519 Commonwealth em-
ployees now working in Sydney, 4578
are in rented and Commonwealth
Bank premises ,and 3941 in Common-
wealth - owned buildings.
Counsels’ Chambers.
Sydney barristers have formed a
company to erect a £500,000 “Coun-
sels’ Chambers” in Phillip Street.
The building will be the biggest
office block to be erected in Sydney
since the war.
It will rise 13 storeys from a site
in Phillip Street, near King Street.

It will have professional chambers for
almost half the barristers in the city.
Included will be two law courts and
associated offices and a section of the
Attorney-General’s Department.
The building will have a 70ft.
frontage and a depth of 120 ft. Work
will begin this year and the block is
expected to be completed early in
1956.
The State Government has given
the Bar Association a 99-year lease on
the site from January 1 last.
Tenders will be called in June, and
excavation is expected to begin in
August.
The company is a co-operative or-
ganisation in which only barristers or
students intending to practise as bar-
risters may hold the ordinary capital.
Members of the Bar have already sub-
scribed the £150,000 required to com-
mence raising finance for the building,
total cost of which is estimated at
£500,000.
Nine of the structure’s 13 storeys
will be occupied by barristers. There
will also be a restaurant, car park,
common room, and library on the
basement.
The provision of two floors for
Court rooms and the Attorney-
General’s Department is part of the
agreement for the lease.
The remaining two floors may be
let for professional or commercial use.
The consulting architects will be
Rudder, Littlemore and Rudder.
Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey are
the consulting engineers.
QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
By F. O. NIXON.
Official statistics of Queensland
building operations for the year ended
31st December, 1953, disclose that
there were fewer new dwellings built
in that year than in any year since
1946, though the value of new build-
ings, other than dwellings, rose to
£11,113,000, the highest figure since
before the war. Although the cost of
the latter class of buildings in 1946
was “suffering a recovery” to the mild
extent of £1,677,000, six years hence
in 1952 the figure rose to
£8,905,000.
Despite the falling-off in the num-
ber of new dwellings, the monetary
value of all new buildings was £900,000
higher than in the previous year, the
comparative figures being £21,937,000
md £21,037,000. The peak year was
1951, when £24,550,000 was spent in
new buildings of all kinds.
Building in Brisbane seems to have
recovered from the seasonal variations
caused by holidays and wet weather,
so much so that the figures for the
month of March are well up to nor-
mal. Of the 700 permits issued by
the Brisbane City Council, while a
great number of dwellings are below
the £3OOO price, it is not surprising
when it is realised the long responsi-
bility this entails upon those who are
forced to borrow the money and to
repay it gradually over many years.
In the £3OOO to £4OOO class, there
were permits for 33 dwellings: nine to
cost from £4OOO to £7OOO, and one
each £7500 and £B5OO. There were
six flats buildings costing from £3500
to £5 500 each. Eight factories, from
£4500 upward, included one each to
cost £20,000 and £27,880 for addi-
tions; of eleven stores from £3OOO up-
ward, the highest cost was one each
at £9OO and £16,000 . Eight new pet-
rol service stations cost from £3OOO
to £lO,OOO, the last-named being so
superior in its class as to remind one
of a superior barber at a mining town
who called himself a “cranium manipu-
lator” and “shampoologist,” as superior
in his class, no doubt, as a “lubri-
torium” is in the company of “filling
stations.” Other new building opera-
tions included additions costing
£35,000 to an hotel and £4995 for a
church school.
A very larcge building programme
by the Brisbane City Council, includ-
ing a bridge across the Brisbane River,
is certain, and a recently approved
item in which is a new bridge over
Breakfast Creek to cost £282,000,
which includes £22,000 for some
straightening of land nearby. The
work is claimed as “urgent,” and ten-
ders are to be called at the earliest
date. This bridge skirts Newstead
Park, once the residence of the first
Government resident more than 100
years ago, carries a very large volume
of traffic from the main residential
suburbs of Clayfield, Ascot and Hamil-
ton, as well as transport traffic to the
Hamilton overseas wharves and three
racecourses, using Kingsford Smith
Drive. On many days this bridge is
greatly overtaxed, and the new bridge’s
60ft. roadway, plus two 9ft. footpaths,
taking the place of the present 39ft.,
can do no more than ameliorate the
crush at certain times. It is to be a
three-span bridge 245 ft. long to re-
place the present length one of 173 ft.
Another bridge which came up for
review is the Toombul overhead rail'
way bridge as it approaches Nundah,
the scene of twenty'five accidents up
to the end of 1953. Major alterations
a few years ago, costing £30,000, to
mitigate the danger of a hairpin bend
did not satisfactorily overcome the
trouble of a bridge which crosses the
railway at a bad angle.
The Brisbane City Council in a
praiseworthy admission that day
labour jobs had an inherent weakness
that private enterprise contracts did
not suffer have accepted the fresh
tender of M, R, Hornibrook Pty. Ltd.
at £268,250 subject to a “rise” and
fall” clause, and time of completion
is twenty months.
The day labour estimate of the same
job by the Brisbane City Council’s
planning and building department was
£19,278 more and the time four
months longer. Delays over this work,*
which need not have occurred, have
cost the people at least £lO,OOO, and
time, an important factor in this ten'
der which relates to an important sec'
tion of the electricity power-house at
Tennyson.
The sum of £25,000 is being spent
on a plant to control the natural
methane gas escaping from a bore at
a farm 44 miles west of Brisbane. In
U.S.A., natural gas is a major fuel
development and the value of this Mt.
Walker discovery has yet to be proved.
Some anxiety has been caused in
Queensland’s plywood industry by the
manufacture of plywood in New
Guinea by a company in which tht
Commonwealth - New Guinea Timber
Company has control. The possible
disrupting influence of competition,
surrounded by advantages, has been
the subject of Tariff Board examina-
tion.
The disposition of fire brigade
stations is to be changed to meet the
changed city conditions and develop-
ment.
The metropolitan head station, cen-
trally situated in Ann St., will be re-
placed by two new stations placed at
the respective northern and southern
centres of the main city area. The
decentralisation aims at bringing the
stations within five minutes’ travelling
time of any city fire that may occur,
a policy which is to be applied to all
suburban areas . In the country the
service is being brought up-to-date.
In at least nine towns new stations
were to be built, some of them al-

ready under way. The cost of the fire
service of Queensland for the year
1953-54 would be £549,500, towards
which contributions are received as
follows; Fire insurance companies,
£235,500; State Government and Local
Authorities, £157,000 each.
Plans are being prepared for a six-
Storey block of modern building for
the Queensland Radium Institute in
the grounds of the Brisbane General
Hospital to overcome the present con-
gestion of space. One item in the
new set-up is to be a super-voltage X-
ray machine, costing £62,900, being
made by Metropolitan Vickers in Eng-
land for the treatment of cancer. At
present the largest of the machines at
the Institute operates on 400,000 volts,
whereas the new machine is ten times
more powerful with its 4,000,000 vol-
tage to give greater depth dosage and
requires insulation of very thick con-
crete walls and ceiling. Last year the
Institute treated 2600 new patients for
malignant growths.
Public opinion is rising in condem-
nation of the length of time it is
taking to construct the high-level rail-
way bridge over the Burdekin River
south of Townsville. Every wet sea-
son transport is held up for several
weeks at a time, and the growing
populations of these northern places
are seriously affected. The shortage
of steel and cement in such vast quan-
tities as this long bridge requires can
be understood, but the examples we
had during the war of very large con-
structions being carried through with
expedition raises the question as to
why there cannot be acceleration in so
vital a link between South and North
Queensluand in peace time. The
Queensland Canegrowers’ Council at
its recent conference joined in the
agitation to press the Government to
have this bridge completed before the
next wet season—January to March.
In Warwick, on the Darling Downs,
the two public schools connected with
two churches are building new assem-
bly halls at a cost of £28,000 —one to
cost £20,000 and the other £BOOO.
The halls are to be memorials to col-
legiates who made the supreme sac-
rifice in World War 11.
At Southport, where land could be
bought for the proverbial song forty
to fifty years ago when it was just a
seaside holiday resort, a main street
allotment that was purchased for
£lO,OOO in 1949 is to have a £30,000
store erected upon it by Penneys Ltd.,

A portion of old Brisbane, at the

to reduce the congestion of traffic.
This involves the demolition of a very
old building that will cause no archi-

a severe slope that will call for very
strong foundations.
Real estate principals report an un-
usually large number of enquiries for
land on which to build factories,
storage rooms and offices from impor-
tant industrial establishments in the

been made and others are pending.
Enquirers are not being carried away
by boom-price offers and are interested
only in market values , Care should
be taken to acquire only land that is
placed above the flood levels reached
in 1893, which could occur again if
the rainfall of 78 inches in 72 hours
on the catchment of the Brisbane
River were to be repeated. Flood-
prevention schemes have yet to be
tested should the rainfall mentioned
be repeated, and the recent flooding
experience in Rockhampton and in the
Northern Rivers of N.S.W. calls for
the use of great engineering brains to
subvert calamities that increase with
the growth of the places subject to
disastrous flooding, even if the remedy
entails moving the towns beyond pos-
sible floodings.
Lismore could be removed to ad-

NEW WIND TUNNEL.
More than £lOO,OOO has been spent

when aircraft and guided missiles
travel at 2000 miles an hour. When
the 7700-horsepower motor is working
it will produce a wind velocity equiva-
lent to this speed, and although it will
be beyond the capacity of aircraft for
some time to come, designers will be
able to plan out changes in the exist-
ing forms of craft to be progressively
adopted.

Research and Modern Housing
FILMS FOR BUILDERS.
The Use of “No-Fines” Concrete.
That it is important for the practi-
cal man in the building industry to
know something of the methods used
by the research man and to have con-
fidence in the practical nature of his
objectives is the theme of a film “Re-
search and Modern Housing,” which
is shown by Mr. R. E. Banks, Head
of the Building Research Liaison Ser-
vice of the Department of Works. The
film depicts the work of the Building
Research Station in Great Britain
whose counterparts in Australia are the
Commonwealth Experimental Building
Station at Ryde, New South Wales,
and the Division of Building Research,
C.5.1.R.0., at Highett, Victoria.
“No-Fines” Concrete.
A film strip prepared by the Liaison
Service is also being shown on “No-
fines Concrete,” which has been wide-
ly used overseas and which is finding
increasing favour in Australia.
Economy is the main attraction of
no-fines concrete and compared with
dense concrete it is lighter and re-
quires lighter shuttering, has a smaller
drying shrinkage, requires no fine ag-
gregate, requires about 40% less
cement for the same total volume of
concrete.
It is claimed that a no-fines concrete
house is as comfortable as a brick
house and costs about the same.
THE RACHEL FORSTER
HOSPITAL.
Remarkable Progress From
Humble Beginning.
(See also page 20.)
With the opening of its £230,000
McKell Outpatients’ Department the
Rachel Forster Hospital for Women
and Children completes an historic
cycle.
Thirty-one years ago “Rachel”
(named after the wife of a former
Governor-General, Lord Forster) be'
gan life as an outpatients hospital in
an old Surry Hills house.
Now a fine modern metropolitan
hospital, “Rachel” further justifies the
faith and intuition of her six women
doctor founders by the opening of
this most up'to'the'minute outpatients’
department.
Waiting Eliminated.
Special features which should prove
a boon to patients include the break'
ing'up of the usual large hospital
waiting'rooms into small individual
rooms for each clinic and an efficient
“By Appointment only” system to
end the long, dreary waiting hours.
A buffet on the ground floor is also
welcome.
The success story of Rachel Forster
Hospital should bring a thrill of pride
in their sex to all women.
Six women doctors founded it, and
during the past three decades out'
standing women. medicos have learnt,
practised, and taught their profession
there.
Backing them has been loyal hos'
pital staff under Matron Inez Lee,
who has been matron for 26 years, and
thousands of non'professional women,
housewives, and single women who
work on auxiliaries to assist the hos'
pital.
The six women doctors who turned
that crumbling Surry Hills house in
1922 into a hospital wanted the chance
to practise their profession and to
break down some of the male pre'
judice which barred hospital appoint'
ments to them.
In their brave new venture, the
doctors —Lucy Gullett, Harriet Biffin,
Susie O’Reilly, Margaret Harper,
Emma Buckley, and Dame Constance
D’Arcy, Rachel now has 140 beds, a
modern nurses’ and staff block, to'
gether with the 23 beds of the Bexley

columns of “Building” magazine in
the 193 5'39 period, when both Sydney
and Melbourne were bristling with
new city buildings.
What has happened to Sydney, to
be lagging behind so badly?
LONG WELDED SPANS.
Mexico City Municipal auditorium claims the longest completely welded spans in
the world, 328 ft. and 294 ft. between supports. The building is sector, or wedge
shape with a front facing a circular arc. It has 8 rigid frame trusses radiating symmet-
rically to carry the load of the roof and balcony. Illustrated here (top) the trusses
are seen from the front of the building. Approximately 5000 tons of steel are used,
made up of locally produced I-beams, plates, angles and channels, welded to form
the structural sections required. Lower left picture shows the first radial truss being
erected with the aid of wooden tower supports. Lower right picture shows the
joining of the diagonals and chords to the upright members.

LAMINATED TIMBER
CONSTRUCTION.
The Market Hail, Utrecht, Holland, is of
laminated wood. The elliptical l-ribs
supporting the roof illustrate a new tech-
nique in building methods which is
adaptable to many forms of structural
assemblies, with straight or curved ele-
ments. The use of laminated wood as
shown here is one of the major building
developments of recent years.

Nuclear Science “In a Nutshell”
Professor Oliphant’s Address Before The Institute of Journalists.
Just twenty years ago, in 1934,
Professor C. N, Lewis, of California,
brought to the Cavendish Laboratory,
Cambridge, the first samples of con'
centrated heavy water to reach Eng'
land. Two drops of heavy water, each
sealed into a tiny glass tube, were pre'
sented by Professor Lewis to Lord
Rutherford, with whom I was working.
At that time we were interested in
the nuclear transformation produced
in light elements by bombarding them
with protons, which are the nuclei, or
kernels, of hydrogen atoms.
We were very excited to receive
these precious samples of the new
species of hydrogen and anxious to
try its nuclei as bombarding agents.
Dr. P, Hartek, our chemist colleague,
prepared heavy hydrogen (deuterium)
gas from one of these samples, and
within twenty Tour hours of the arrival
of Professor Lewis we had obtained
our first results. In a few days we
had established that the nuclei of
heavy hydrogen, later called deuterons,
produced a large variety of nuclear
transformations with great ease. In
particular, we found that deuterons
reacted with one another surprisingly
easily, releasing considerable energy
and producing a still heavier isotope
of hydrogen of mass 3 (tritium), a
new form of helium of mass 3, and
large numbers of neutrons.
These reactions between deuterium
nuclei were so easily brought about
that it occurred to me that they might
be initiated in an electric discharge
through the gas in such a way that
more energy was set free than was
needed to establish the reaction. How-
ever, the electrical energy at our dis'
posal was small and though we pro'
duced neutrons copiously there was no
sign that a chain reaction could be
initiated in deuterium by that method.
The successful explosion of hydrogen
bombs has shown that our ideas were
correct.
The essential conditions for produc'
ing a self'sustained deutrium reaction
are that the gas should be heated to
an extremely high temperature and be
subjected to very high pressure. The
temperature required is several millions
of degrees Centigrade, that is, 100 to
1000 times the temperature of the sur'
face of the sun. To heat even a very
small quantity of a substance to these
temperatures requires very great
energy.
So soon as experiment and calcula'
tion had shown that the uranium ‘fis'
sion’ bomb was practicable, in the
early years of the war, it seemed likely
that the great energy released at very
high temperature could be used to
heat heavy hydrogen to the tempera-
ture at which an explosive ‘fusion’
reaction would result. The possibility
was discussed with fascinated horror by
the nuclear scientists. After the suc-
cessful explosion of the first fission
bomb in New Mexico in 1945,- the
practicability of producing hydrogen
bombs was, in the opinion of many
of us, firmly established, but details of
the manner of initiating the detonation
remained to be worked out. The feasi-
bility of using the reaction between
deuterium and tritium as an interne-
diate boost for the leuterium fusion
reaction was established and it was
shown that suitable solid compounds
of deuterium could be used in place
of deuterium itself.
We do not know exactly how the
scientists in the United States have
achieved successful explosions. Re-
ports indicate that the original ideas
have been followed, in general, but
it is clear that many technological
problems of ‘know-how’ had to be
solved.
Although the experimental explo-
sions were a spectacular success, ex-
ceeding in efficiency the hopes of the
scientists, at no time was the explosion
‘out of control’.
In the meantime, the Soviet had
also produced a ‘fusion’ explosion. It
is probable that Klaus Fuchs had pass-
ed information about the possibility of
fusion reactions to Russian agents and
that this information shortened the
time required for Soviet scientists and
technicians to achieve success. How-
ever, it would be a grave mistake to
underestimate the ability of Russian
scientists to work these problems out
for themselves . An Austrian scientist,
Hans Thirring, published in 1946 sur-
prisingly accurate forecasts of the prac-
ticability of the hydrogen bomb, and
did this independently of Russian or
Allied knowledge.
Dr, Robert Oppenheimer, under
whose direction the first fission bombs
were produced at Los Alamos, was in
charge also of the early work on the
hydrogen bomb . This gifted, noble
and loyal American inspired the team
of scientists under his charge and con-
tributed more than any other single
person to the success of the colossal
American project. Whatever had been
his earlier political associations, he be-
haved magnificently in all things and
showed the liveliest appreciation of
the social and international problems
created by the existence of atomic
weapons. He inspired the plan of
control of atomic weapons submitted
to the United Nations on behalf of
THE ITALIAN OLIVETTI PLANT.

UrS.A. by Mr. Baruch. If he was not
in favour of the development of the
hydrogen bomb after its feasibility had
been established by his team, you can
be sure that this opinion was formed
after careful consideration of the mani-
fold problems which the new weapon
would create. After Mr. Truman
made the decision to go ahead he co-
operated fully and effectively. He is,
and will continue to be, a very great
and noble man, absolutely loyal to his
country and to humanity.
Let us survey for a moment the
revolution which atomic weapons have
made in warfare. The great fleets of
1000 bombers which devastated Ham-
burg and Berlin in the las war de-
livered 2000 to 3000 tons of high ex-
plosive. The industrial effort required
to make the aircraft and bombs, the
enormous organisation required to
maintain them, to provide crews and
ground-staff, to build airfields and to
provide fuel for the engines, strained
the resources of the Allies. A single
fission type atomic bomb is equivalent
to 20,000 or more tons of high ex-
plosive and can be delivered by a
single aircraft or guided missile.
The fission bomb is limited in size
because of the existence of a critical
size for a piece of fissionable material.
Amass of uranium 235 (or 233) ,or
of plutonium, is bound to explode if
is exceeds the critical size. This can
be achieved by bringing rapidly to-
gether two or more pieces of the
material, each of which is smaller than
the critical size, or by increasing the
density of a single piece by squeezing
it by detonation of ordinary explosive
surrounding it.
A hydrogen bomb is detonated with
a fission explosion and has no critical
size. The explosive power of a fusion
weapon is limited only by the weight
which can be carried in an aircraft,
guided missile, etc. Bombs equivalent
in power to the explosion of 5 to 20
million tons of T.N.T. have been de-
tonated by the Americans and Rus-
sians. These will destroy completely
an area of 100 square miles or more.
A single hydrogen bomb will eliminate
the largest cities or the biggest indus-
trial areas in the world.
The fission type of bomb is equiva-
lentlent to 1000 block-buster bombs
weighing 20 tons; the hydrogen
weapon can be made equivalent to
1000 fission type bombs or to
1,000,000 block-busters.
Even with all the resources of de-
fence science, it is impossible to de-
stroy more than a fraction of fast,
high-flying aircraft which may attack
a country, especially at night. No
known method exists for intercepting
super-sonic pilotless missiles. There is
no defence against atomic weapons in
modern war. It is clear that atomic
weapons have brough greater changes
in warfare than all previous develop-
ment of the art of war.
There is another side to this enor-
mous release of energy from uranium
and from heavy hydrogen. One pound
of uranium undergoing ‘fission’ is
equivalent as a source of energy to
1500 tons of good coal. One pound
of deuterium undergoing ‘fusion’ is
equivalent to more than 10,000 tons
of coal. Methods are available for the
controlled release of energy from
uranium to produce electric power for
industry. These are now being applied
in Great Britain and will soon make a
valuable contribution to her power re-
sources. Over the next twenty to
thirty years atomic energy from
the ‘fusion’ of heavy hydrogen are not
yet available, but I have little doubt
that these will be worked out in the
near future. If this is achieved,
atomic energy may be available to all,
for supplies of heavy hydrogen from
water are unlimited. Ordinary water
contains about 1 part in 700 of heavy
water and this can be separated by
repeated electrolysis and in other ways.
If used as industrial ‘fuel,’ one
pound of uranium would generate
about three million kilowatt hours of
electricity, or would drive a large elec-
trie locomotive at full power, con'
tinuously day and night, for over a
year. One pound of heavy hydrogen,
if it could be used as fuel, would gene'
rate about 30,000,000 kilowatt hours
of electricity or drive the same loco'
motive for ten years. I hope that
Australian scientists and technologists
will contribute towards the solution of
the outstanding problems of the gene-
ration of industrial power economical'
ly from both uranium and deuterium.
Mankind faces the most important
decision of all time. Push'button war'
fare with atomic weapons, impersonal,
immoral and inhuman, can destroy
civilization. Alternatively, atomic
energy can provide unlimited power
for use in industry and the home.
Man, despite the teachings of all
great religious leaders and moralists,
has not given up warfare. Perhaps,
now that he is faced with the certainty
that war means the complete devasta'
tion of the territories of both sides in
any world conflict, he will find some
alternative method for settling inter-
national quarrels.
Despite the gravity of the situation
I believe that some solution will be
found, perhaps by establishing a form
of limited world government, with an
adequate police force at its disposal.
This implies the renunciation of all
weapons of war in the hands of in-
dividual nations. To my mind it is

useless to say that such proposals are
idealistic and impracticable. I believe
that restricted world government will
come because all men will wish to save
their own lives, the lives and futures
of their children, and civilization it-
self.
There is much talk in some quarters
of a move to ban atomic weapons. I
do not believe that the most solemn
agreement to ban the use of atomic
weapons in war would be worth the
paper on which it was written. If
world war broke out and was fought
at first with conventional weapons, the
side which faced defeat or which felt
that continued war would ruin it,
would abandon all scruples and use
every weapon at its command which it
thought could stave off defeat. The
last war taught us. surely, that even
Christian morality is laid aside in all-
out warfare.
Gas was not used in the last war
because it is not a good weapon.
Atomic weapons are the supreme
weapons of aggresion and retaliation.
Horrible though they be to contem-
plate, bacteriological and gas warfare
are unlikely to be used. Compared
with atomic weapons they are of little
or no importance, and adequate de-
fences can be established. Therefore,
an international ban on their use is
likely to be effective, since neither
side would wish to use them except in
retaliation.
Use of cobalt bombs or of other
weapons designed to spread long-lived
radioactivity over the earth could be
contemplated only by a madman.
Only a devil would deliberately spread
sterility and impotence among man'
kind, his own side included, or store
up genetic monstrosities for the future.
But madmen and devils do exist, and
the last desperate act of a new iHtler
or Stalin could well be to attempt to
destroy humanity.
Paradoxically, these horrors which
face us are the greatest guarantees of
peace which the world has ever
possessed. I believe that men and
women all over the world will demand
of their leaders that at whatever cost
in national sovreignty and individual
power, an international authority, back'
ed by adequate policing strength, must
be established to impose peace upon
the world. This is no loss of freedom,
for a people whose leaders can begin
war have already lost all freedom. It
is the task of the newspapers and of
all organs of publicity to spread know'
ledge of the threat which faces
humanity and to help build a properly
thought out plan for preserving peace.
Patience is needed, but so is speed.
The hands of the clock point almost
to midnight. Only we ordinary people
and those who believe in the future
can ensure that the new day will dawn
and war become a lost and incompre-
hensible sin of the past.

BOOK REVIEW.
“Whither Britain?,” by R. G. W.
Mac Kay. 46 pp. Basil Black'
well, Oxford.
Since the Second World War, Great
Britain has faced a series of economic
crises which, basically, are due to an
alteration in her economic relationship
with the outside world.
The author postulates the question
“Is Commonwealth Development the
Answer?” and answers it with a num'
ber of arguments that it is not. He
considers that it is essential for Britain
to get into a larger area and puts for'
ward Western European federation as
the solution. Britain, he contends,
needs the peoples and the nations of
Western Europe just as much as, if not
more than, they need Britain. Such
a federation would create a political
authority such as is to be found in the
Soviet Union or in the United States
with a population of 280,000,000 and
very large resources.
He considers that this provides the
solution to the predicament in which
Britain tO'day finds herself.

give circulation just below ceiling
height, to expel stale air and recharge
the room with oxygen. It gives maxi-
mum protection with complete ventila-
tion and immunity from all insects and
other pests. The side-hung ventilator
operates under the screen by a speci-
ally designed mechanism (see illustra-
tion). A worm gear actuates on a
steel arm which moves outwards from
the fast window frame and is linked
to the ventilator in a steel channel
The mechanism is totally enclosed in a
die-cast zinc base box, and the worm
action ensures rigidity of the window
in any position, in any weather. A cam
action handle attached to the fast win-

Obituary
Mr. Stephen H. Muras.
The death occurred recently of Mr.
Stephen Henry Basser Muras, aged 65,
co-managing director and works mana'
ger of Luke Muras Ltd., Engineers,
Alexandria.
Mr. Muras, who was born in Syd'
ney, had been associated with his firm
for 50 years. He was a son of the
founder, the late Luke Readford
Muras, and a brother of Mr. Luke R.
Muras, his other co'director.
Regarded in Australian engineering
circles as a man of outstanding ability.
Mr. Stephen Muras was in charge of
all works activities at the large Alexan-
dria plant. He was a qualified mech'
anical and electrical engineer, and he
specialised with great success in these
fields.
The sympathy of his many friends
and business associates is coupled with
that of the Editor and staff of this
journal, and is tendered, with every
sincerity, to his widow, two daughters
and all relatives.
The funeral service was held at
Wood Coffills, George Street, and was
followed by cremation at the Northern
Suburbs Crematorium.
The Chapel was filled to overflow'
ing with relatives, friends, and repre'
sentatives of the State Parliament,
Australian structural, building, engim
eering and allied industries, merchants,
and members of the architectural pro'
fession.
A very large number of floral trib'
utes were sent as a last token of re'
spect and esteem.
The service at the Chapel and the
Crematorium was conducted by the
Rev. H. McKeown, of Randwick
Presbyterian Church.
In an eloquent tribute to the mem'
ory of the late Mr. Muras, the Rev.
McKeown said it would be a great
comfort to all who knew and respect'
ed Mr. Muras that he was a man of
many fine qualities, who had really
tried to make life worth while.
He had the very necessary qualities
of a successful businessman —upright
conduct, fairness, and efficiency.
These he combined with the quality
of bringing happiness to his homedife.
There was also his quality of being
friends with everyone, and he would
be long remembered for this.
“When a man’s life has held qual-
ities like those, we who remain must
also be grateful for his many good
works and actions whilst he walked

A NEW TAUBMAN’S COLOUR.
Taubman’s Colour Service recently
introduced Butex Enamelised Bur*
gundy to the trade and home'owners.
It is claimed that the deep rich
tones of Burgundy, allied to Enamel'
ised Ivory, Cream or Light Stone, are
eminently suitable for the old English'
style home, as well as dwellings which
feature medium coloured brick or are
slate'roofed.
An opportunity was missed in not
presenting this pamphlet about bcautb
ful burgundy colour, in Burgundy ton'
ed ink, instead of harsh black printing,
almost unrelieved by any other colour.
When colours are so vital a part of
Paint Manufacturers’ business, the
psychological effect of anything but
Colour leaves one with the feeling
that the case for colour has not been
as well presented as it should have
been. We are sure everyone would
like to see its effect. Perhaps the
firm has a “chaser” pamphlet in colour
“up its sleeve” to send out.
NEW DEPARTURES IN
MODERN CONSTRUCTION.
New materials and new techniques are
constantly being introduced. Aluminium
alloy is gaining ground, being light and
corrosion proof. The top illustration is
of a large aluminium corrugated sheet-
ing roof to an exhibition hall. The low-
er illustration shows long span pre-stress-
ed concrete beams, of comparatively
small section for a garage roof. These
give more head room and greater span
than would otherwise be obtainable.

"BUTTERFLY" SHELL AWNINGS.
Six new platforms of the Rotterdam
Central Station have a "Butterfly" shell-
type roof of unusual design, as shown

New Advances In Civil Engineering Plant
WIDE RANGE OF EQUIPMENT ON VIEW
AT BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR.
The truth of the saying that appe'
tite comes with eating has never been
better exemplified in the engineering
field than by the immense expansion,
during the past ten years in the pro'
duction of contractors’ plant. In
part, this expansion is a result of
World War 11., during which there
was great development in mechanical
digging and earth-moving equipment,
and in part it is traceable to economic
causes, such as the increasing cost of
labour.
Thus it has come about that the
manufacture of contractors’ plant—
which forms such an important sec'
tion of the British Industries Fair
(Earls Court and Olympia, London
and Castle Bromwich, Birmingham,
May 3 to 14) at Castle Bromwich,
Birmingham—has developed, in com'
paratively few years, into one of the
most important sections of Britain’s
heavy engineering industry.
It ranges from large power shovels,
draglines, scrapers, graders, and the
increasing family of dumpers and “doz'
ers” down to well-boring equipment,
portable air-compressors and the tools
that they operate, piledrivers, pumps
of many kinds, concrete mixers and
distributors, and appliances (power or
hand) for bending pipes and the
steel rods used in reinforced-concrete
construction.
Ditching and Trenching Machines.
Among the more specialised forms
of contractors’ plant to be seen at the
Fair are ditching and trenching ma-
chines. A few inventors were expert
menting with such machines 20 or
more years ago, but they did not then
attract a great following. In recent
years, however, possibly as a result
of the construction of numerous long
pipelines, laid under ground, there has
been a strong revival of interest in
them and they are now taking over
much of the work that was done form'
erly by back-acting shovels on crawler
tracks. They have the advantage of
continuous action, thus enabling the
pipe-laying also to become a contin-
uous insteadof a “batch” operation.
Another recent development is the
introduction of fork-lift trucks of
large size, mounted on big wheels with
tractor'type tyres which enable them
to operate Over rough ground and soft
surfaces. Hydraulic or pressure'oil
systems are now generally favoured for
actuating the lifting and other gear,
a trend which owes much to the in'
tensive study of such devices for air'
craft applications and the consequent
availability of numerous types of high
speed and high'pressure oil pumps
and “slave” motors.
THE "TIMBERWOLF"
Designed for the timber trade, the "Timberwolf" can handle heavy, bulky, lengthy
loads. Manufactured by the British Straddle Carrier Company Ltd., London, it
will be on view at the Castle Bromwich section of the British Industries Fair (Earls
Court and Olympia, London, and Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, May 3 to 14).
GIANT STADIUM AT BUDAPEST.

The prefabricated concrete construction
of this giant sports stadium provides ac-
commodation for 80,000 seated and

"ROCKEFELLER CENTRE"
IN CARACAS.
This magnificent project in Caracas,
Venezula (population 150,161) has been
aptly termed "Rockefeller Centre," after
New York's stately radio and entertain-
ment hub. This great building pro-
gramme in the heart of progressive Car-
acas involved the complicated re-rout-
ing of traffic and the construction of 24
ultra-modern buildings. Embodying the
latest architectural practices, the
"Centre" would do credit to a city a
dozen times its size. While Sydney
squabbles over the site of a proposed
Opera House, overseas cities of far
lesser size get on with the job of bring-
ing beauty, culture, and architectural
delight to their citizens.

NEW N.Z. HOTEL.
£100.000 Building At Taupo.
The construction of a new Lake
Hotel at Taupo, at a contract price of
£lOO,OOO, is in progress, the con-
tractors being Noel Cole Ltd.
The original Lake Hotel and Bun-
galow guest house were destroyed by
fire nearly four years ago and there has
been a serious shortage of accommo-
dation.
It was hoped to complete the new
building, which will provide thirty
guests with first-class accommodation,
in eighteen months to two years.
Noel Cole Ltd. have recently built
modern hotels at Matamata, Putaruru
and Tokoroa, rapidly developing towns
in the southern portion of Auckland
Province.
In its annual report the Tourist and
Publicity Department declared that
lack of first class hotel accommodation
was a serious obstacle to development
of the tourist business, which showed
a return of £1,600,000 last financial
year.
FLEXIBLE RESEARCH
LABORATORY.
A new flexible research laboratory
has been developed by 1.C.1. Ltd., the
main feature of which is the use of
standardised wall and roof sections,
laboratory equipment, plumbing and
lighting, so that any one of the three
floors may be entirely altered with a
minimum, of trouble. The research
worker can rearrange his part of the
laboratory to meet his own special
needs, using only a spanner and screw-
driver.
(Some housewives manage to en-
tirely rearrange their living quarters
without even a spanner.)
ROBBIALAC NOW IN SATIN
FINISH.
Jenson 6? Nicholson (Aust.) Pty.
Ltd. announce Robbialac Satin Finish
Enamel for all types of interior sur'
faces.
One of the leading advantages of
Robbialac Satin Finish is claimed to
be in its easy working properties on
large surfaces which makes for free'
dom of brushing and perfect joining
completely free from lap marks and
brushmarks. Coverage per gallon eas'
ily attains 800 sq. ft. per gallon. The
colour range will be exactly the same
as Robbialac Suede Wall Finish. This
permits colour schemes to be carried
through on walls and woodwork using
Suede for the body colour and Satin
Finish for the wood trim.
It dries dust free in approximately
four hours and is thoroughly hard
overnight, ready for the second coat.
CRYSTAL PALACE T.V.
STATION.
B.B. C. To Invite Tenders Shortly.
The 8.8. C. expect to invite tenders
shortly for the development of the
Crystal Palace site, where a new tele'
vision station is to be established to
take the place of the present Alexandra
Palace Station.
The first contract will be for the
transmitter building. This is to be
constructed underground, and will
measure 140 ft. by 90ft. Only the
section accommodating the ventilating
plant will be partly overground. At
a later stage tenders will be invited for
the erection of a selLsupporting steel

“Great George," one of the world’s
largest clocks stands 200 ft. from the
ground in the 300 ft. tower of the
Royal Lever Building, Liverpool, Eng-
land. Until the Coronation, Great
George was silent, owing to the great
weight of the bells necessary to strike
the hours and quarters. Science has
now given Great George a voice,
powerful in volume and mellow in
tone, worthy of the size and majesty
of the Clock Tower. The notes are
generated by an electric master clock,
striking special steel wires less than
a foot long, amplified many hundreds
of times. The four dials of this great
clock are 2^ft. long, 2|ft. larger than
those of Big Ben.
BRITISH PREFABS. ON DISPLAY
MANY TYPES AT BIG EXHIBITION.
Many U.K. firms will be showing
the most recent prefabrication dcvel-
opments at the British Industries Fair
(Earl’s Court and Olympia, and Castle
Bromwich, Birmingham, May 3 to
14).
The prefab, exhibits will mainly be
?t Earl’s Court, where a large area of
floor space has been allocated for dis-
plays.
Among the exhibits will be steel
portal-framed structures, many types of
houses, multi-storey buildings, and
others which use a variety of mater'
ials in their construction.
These buildings, the manufacturers
claim, are suitable for all climates and
conditions.
LARGE PREFABRICATED BUILDING.
With a span of 100 ft. and a superficial area of 25,000 sq. ft., this building was

Light Weight Concrete Replaces Wood
In Arctic Regions
BUILDING ACTIVITY IN FAR NORTH.
The latest addition to Swedish coiv
Crete factories and the most up'to'
date is the Skelleftehamn plant,
125 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
This factory was built not only in re-
sponse to the rising demand for
Siporex products in general, says Mr.
Bror bjogren, head of the Company,
but also to supply the need for new
building in the far north of Sweden.
Timber has traditionally been the pre'
dominant material in that area, but
present trends show that wood is im
creasingly required for more highly'
processed products. This development
is resulting in a shortage of timber for
housing, while prices are soaring.
The choice of the mouth of the
Skellefte River as the site of the new
plant was based on considerations both
of raw materials supply and of com'
munications with the proposed market-
mg area, making Siporex available at
lower prices, thanks to the saving in
transport. The cement is brought to
the factory by sea from Stora Vika,
south of Stockholm—one of the large
plants belonging to the Cementa Co.,
leading Swedish producers of cement
—in especially constructed self' dis'
on to a conve y° r , which carries
it to a large silo, having a capacity of
4000 tons ’ which is enou §h to keep
1700 tons, which are automatically urn
loaded in seven hours.
New Methods For Casting
and Cutting.
The other chief raw material, sand
is dredged from the bottom of the
Skellefte River. The sand is fed into
a mill for grinding and despatched to
a mixing station, from where the mix*
ture proceeds to the casting halls for
pouring into moulds. These are of an
entirely new type and the same refers

War Memorial Church, St. Joan of Arc, Haberfield
Tenders are now being called for the construction of the new church at Haberfield for
The Very Rev. Monsignor John McCooe, which will be dedicated to those of the parish
who paid the supreme sacrifice in the two Great Wars and In Korea. The new church,
which is designed to accommodate approximately 700 people, will be erected on an
elevated site at the corner of Dalhousie Street and Deakin Avenue and will be faced with
buff brick and rooted with green tiles. A bell tower approximately 60 feet high will be
a feature of the main front and will house the half-ton bell from the existing church
which is so well-known in the locality for its mellow tone. The lower portion of the main
front will be faced with Sydney sandstone around the three main entrance doors, and
the main interior walls of the church will also be finished in face brick. The reredos and
the high altar will be carried out in Wombeyan marble with appropriate carved symbols in
colour. The lighting throughout will be fluorescent. The planning provides tor large

ting both reinforced and non' rein'
forced products. After being cut, the
material is steam-cured in autoclaves,
a process that gives it strength and
durability.
The production comprises both re'
inforced and non' reinforced units,
which are supplied in varying densi'
ties depending upon the climatic and
other conditions at the place where it
is to be used. Non'reinforced Siporex
units consist primarily of building and
insulating blocks and slabs, which can
be obtained in thicknesses from 2in.
to 6in. The reinforced material is
intended for beams and roof and floor
slabs. A special feature of the Siporex
material in addition to its light
weight, insulating capacities and easy
working and handling is that it has
the same coefficient of thermal expan'
sion as steel. This entails many ad'
vantages and, inter alia, makes it pos'
sible to manufacture slabs reinforced
in the same way as ordinary concrete,
with lengths of up to 30 feet or more.
The main factory building contains
the milling department, mixing station
with hoppers, casting hall, reinforcing
and welding shops, autoclave depart'
ment, mould removing hall and steam
plant. Mechanical and electrical work'
shops, switching plant and laboratory
are housed in an adjoining building.
Stocks are kept and despatched from
a 700 ft. long building on the northern
side of the factory area.
The plant, which -has been in opera'
tion since the beginning of 1953, has
a present capacity of about 7000 cubic
feet per day.

POWER TRAFFIC LIGHTS
IN STEEL PLANT.
Electric furnace operations at New*
port Steel Company’s mills now use a
traffic light system to help make full
use of available power. When no sig'
nal lamp is showing the furnace opera'
tor can make use of as much power
as is needed. Green lights show the
approach of maximum plant demand,
yellow warns against further increase,
and red calls for a power reduction to
be made.
Three induction disc relays operate
the system, which has proved effective
in making full use of the power avail'
able without exceeding the time limit
set by the maximum demand indicated.

The Principles and Applications of Prestressed Concrete
By W. L. DAWSON, B.E., A.M.I.E.Aust.
Delivered before Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement
of Science Congress, Canberra, January, 1954.
INTRODUCTION.
The principle of prestressing is by
no means new though it is only with-
in the last twenty years that it has
been successfully applied to concrete
work. The cooper, when making a
barrel, consciously or unconsciously
uses the principle to ensure that a
number of wood staves stay in intim-
ate contact and prevent leakage of the
barrel’s contents. He pre-compresses
the staves by driving steel hoops over
the tapered sides of the barrel and
when the liquid is introduced expan-
sion of the dry staves increases the
prestress which must be overcome by
the pressure of the contents before
separation of the staves and >cakage of
the contents can occur.
The making of a wire spoked wheel
is another example of the use of pre-
stressing. The wire spoke, due to its
lack of rigidity, cannot carry compres-
sive loads and yet when subjected to
such leads from the rim of the wheel
no flexure occurs. The reason for this
is that an initial tension is placed ;n
all spokes so that when the wheel rim
is loaded the only effect is to reduce
the tension in some spokes and increase
the tension in others; at no time, un-
der normal or working loads, does the
spoke bend due to compression.
A person picking up a number of
books by compressing them between
the palms of the hands unwittingly uses
prestress to prevent them from falling.
By experience he knows that if the
hands are placed too high the stack
will buckle, so he places them fust
below the centre line of the books and
can thus support a beam made up of
individual units with no adhesion be-
tween them. The conditions existing
in this example of prestressing are sim-
ilar to those which exist in a pre-
stressed simple concrete beam.
THE PRINCIPLES OF
PRESTRESSING CONCRETE.
Why Prestress Concrete?
Though concrete can withstand
large compressive forces it is incap-
able of resisting tensile forces of any
worthwhile magnitude. To illustrate
this with figures, little difficulty is ex-
perienced in making concrete with an
ultimate compressive strength of 5,000
lb. per sq. in. but it is more difficult
to make a concrete with a modoulus of
rupture of more than 700 lb. per sq.
in. It is for this reason that concrete
members which are subject to bending
are reinforced with steel —the steel
supplies the tensile strength which
is lacking in the concrete.
The reinforcement of concrete with
un-prestressed steel, however, has one
major drawback—the strain capacity
of the concrete is very much less than
the strain capacity of the reinforcing
steel. This in effect means that be-
fore the permissible working load of
a simple concrete beam is reached,
cracks occur in the concrete surround-
ing the steel so that it is no longer
effective in resisting tensile stresses.
Figure 1(a) is an exaggerated repre-
sentation of the conditions existing
in an ordinary reinforced concrete
beam subjected to a bending load.
The shaded section of the beam is
the only part of the concrete in com-
pression and is virtually the only part
doing any work. The beam may there-
fore be reduced in principle to a flat
tied arch as shown in Figure 1(b).
Why then do we bother to include
the concrete in the tensile zone of the
beam? For two reasons —to protect
the reinforcement from fire and cor-
rosion and because it is easier and in
the case of small beams, more econ-
omical to make a beam of uniform
section than one in which the cross
section varies. The opening of cracks
in the lower part of the beam is also
assisted by the tensile stresses set up
by shrinkage of the concrete after it
has bonded to the steel.
Another disadvantage of this meth-
od of reinforcing is that the steel in
the unloaded beam has no potential
energy, therefore if any creep occurs
in either the concrete or the steel
when the beam is loaded is has no re-
serve of energy to restore the beam
to its original condition on removal
of the load. This means that there
will be some residual deflection and
cracks which have occurred will not
re-close completely.
What Is The Effect of
Prestressing Concrete?
Now let us look at a prestressed con-
crete beam and see how the short-
comings of the ordinary reinforced
beam are overcome. Consider a
simple beam of rectangular section
similar to the ordinary reinforced
beam. In Figure 2(a) the beam is
regarded as weightless and an external
force T is applied at its ends with a
certain eccentricity below the neutral
axis of the beam. Force T is a pre-
stressing force which causes stresses in
the concrete of the relative magnitude
and distribution shown in 2(a). The
stress is mainly compressive but due
to the eccentricity of the line of ac-
tion of T a small tensile force occurrs
in the top of the beam.
If we now consider the stresses due
to the dead weight ©f the beam we

obtain the distribution shown in Figure
2(b). However, since compressive
and tensile stresses are accompanied
by strains of the same sense, conditions
(a) and (b) cannot exist separately.
The occurrence of tensile strains in
the top of the beam and compressive
strains in the bottom cause a hogging
action and the moment the centre of
the beam commences to lift its dead
load becomes effective. The stress
distributed due to actions (a) and (b)
is shown in the next diagram. The
magnitude and line of action of T
may be chosen so that under the ac'
tion of the dead load and the prestress'
ing force no tensile stress occurs in
the beam. Figure 2(c) shows the
stress distribution in the weightless
beam due to the live load P with no
prestressing force acting.
The final diagram shows the stress
condition of the beam when all forces
are acting. The art of prestressed com
Crete design, therefore, is to choose
the shape and dimensions of the
beam, and the magnitude and line of
action of the prestressing force so
that a desired stress condition exists
in the beam under working loads. Urn
der certain circumstances a small ten'
sile stress may be permissible at
working loads.
So far the application of prestress
to simple beams only has been consid'
ered. When prestress is applied to
continuous concrete structures there
are secondary effects which must be
considered in the design. Consider
the beam shown in Figure 2 to have
an additional support under its
middle point. When loaded in this
position the stresses are statically inde'
terminate but when the prestressing
force T is applied a hogging action
will cause the beam to lift from the
centre support so that it now becomes
statically determinate. To retain the
continuous nature of the beam a re'
straint must be applied at the centre
support which will then introduce sec'
ondary bending moments which must
be taken into account in design cal'
culations.
Several methods are used to dimim
ate the secondary stresses in prestress'
ed continuous structures, the most ob'
vious being to make the prestressing
cable coincide with the neutral axis of
the beam. This has the disadvantage
that it is not in the best position to
resist bending moments. Another
method is to curve the cable so that
it lies as much above the neutral axis
as below. This is a better arrange'
ment as the cable can be placed in the
lower half of the beam where positive
bending moments occur and in the
upper half where negative moments
occur. It has one disadvantage, how'
ever, in that the waving of the cable
increases its friction on the cable duct
during prestressing. A similar effect
to waving the cable may be obtained
by keeping the cable straight and ah
tering the location of the neutral axis
by haunching the beam at the sup'
ports.
Secondary stresses may also be set
up when prestressing continuous
frame structures. These will not only
be due to the rotation of the ends of
the members during prestressing but
also due to their elastic shortening.
Complications due to secondary
stresses in prestressed continuous
structures may also be obviated by
prestressing the members in a stath
cally determinate condition then pro'
viding for continuity at a later stage.
For example, a continuous beam may
be made up of a number of simple
beams which are prestressed in this
condition then made continuous by
the use of cap cables or even ordin-
ary reinforcement over the supports.
In the case of portal frames temporary
hinges can be provided at the corners
until the horizontal member is pre'
stressed then the whole made rigid by
prestressing the columns and grouting
up the hinges.
How Does Prestressed Concrete
Differ in Behaviour From Ordinary
Reinforced Concrete?
A study of the diagrams in Figure
2 will best illustrate the difference in
behaviour between ordinary reinforc-
ed concrete and prestressed concrete.
As demonstrated by these diagrams
conditions may be adjusted in the pre'
stressed concrete beam so that no part
of the concrete is ever in a state of
tension. All concrete is therefore
playing an effective part in the sup'
port of the load. In the ordinary re-
inforced concrete beam the ability of
the concrete to resist tensile stresses
is so limited that cracking is almost
certain to occur in the tensile zone,
so that only the concrete in the com'
pressive zone is effective in support'
ing the load.
The difference in behaviour of the
two beams is most marked under over'
load conditions. When the ordinary
reinforced concrete beam is subjected
to a load in excess of the design
load several things are likely to occur.
Visible cracks will open in the lower
side of the beam and though they
may close to some extent on removal
of the lead they will not close com'
pletely. Several factors can contribute
to this condition depending on the
design of the beam; creep is likely
to occur in the concrete or steel
and slip may occur between the con'
Crete and steel. If the magnitude of
the overload is such that the yield
stress of the steel is exceeded or the
stress in the concrete goes beyond the
elastic range, sufficient permanent de'
flection may remain in the beam to
make it unserviceable. The load at
which visible cracks occur in the nor'
mal reinforced beam is found to be
about .42 of the ultimate load* but
it is certain that hair cracking occurs
long before this lead is reached. It
is therefore apparent that a factor of
safety of 2 in normal reinforced con'
Crete design will not give protection
against cracking occurring in the ten-
sile zone of a member.
In comparison, the prestressed com
Crete beam has a greater recuperative
power when an overload is removed.
The extent to which such a beam will
recover is shown in Figure 3. These
are load deflection curves obtained
during the testing of two precast pre'
stressed beams made at a Melbourne
concrete products factory. The beam
which was tested on an 18’ 6” span
and loaded at its third points, showed
no permanent deflection whilst elastic
strain was occurring. It was not until
the fifth loading, when the point
where visible cracking occurred was
exceeded, that there was residual de'
flection in the beam after removal of
the overload. The loading in this
case was almost twice the design load'
ing and yet the permanent deflection
left in the beam when the load was
removed was only .165”. After sev'
eral more loading cycles the beam was
loaded to failure on the Bth cycle.
Failure occurred at approximately
three times the design load by crush'
ing and yet the permanent deflection
of the beam.
The second beam was tested on a
shorter span and in this case visible
cracks did not occur until the loading
reached 1.4 times the design load;
failure occurred by shear in the con'
Crete at approximately two and a half
times the design load.
What are the Advantages of
Prestressed Concrete?
When it is advocated that a new
technique or material be used in
building or engineering construction,
architects and engineers require some
sound reasons why it should be used
in preference to techniques and ma-
terials already in vogue. Three fun'
damental questions must be answered
by the advocate:
Does Prestressing Make Better
Concrete Structures?
Let us consider the qualities of pre'
stressed concrete to determine whether
these are conducive to the better per-
formance of structures.

• Prestressing makes concrete flex-
ural members crack free within the
range of working loads thus reducing
their susceptibility to deterioration un-
der conditions of exposure to deleter'
ious materials.
• Prestressing makes possible the ef'
! ficient use of high strength concrete
with its correspondingly better dur-
ability.
• Prestressing enables us to use thin
web members of I or T section thus
obtaining the most effective distribu'
tion of material for resisting bending
moments.
• Prestressing reduces the depth of
beams and girders thus increasing
their under clearance and enables larg'
er distances to be spanned without in-
termediate supports thus increasing
the usable area in buildings.
• Prestressing in maximum rigidity
under working loads and maximum
flexibility under excessive overloads.
It appears from these attributes that
prestressed concrete can provide better
structures for many job conditions. It
should be made clear, however, that
there are still many jobs where pre-
stressed concrete would not have any
outstanding advantages.
The types of structures in which
maximum advantage can be obtained
from prestressing are those in which
it is imperative that even hair crack'
ing be prevented, such as in water-
containing structures, or where the
concrete is subject to severe exposure
conditions, in structures such as bridges
and buildings where maximum span
is required with a minimum depth of
beam, in piles driven into ground
containing waters which may be in-
jurious to the concrete, in pipes
where it is necessary to resist high
pressures with a minimum of wall
thickness, and in precast units where
it is necessary to combine strength
and lightness.
Is It Economical?
This question is probably of most
interest to prospective users of pre-
stressed concrete. It is a difficult one
to answer in a general manner as it
must be considered in relation to the
cost of materials, construction condi'
tions and, probably most important,
the price we are prepared to pay for
special qualities in the finished struc-
ture. For this reason we must have
at the back of our mind, when consid'
ering the economics of prestressing,
the use to which it is to be put and
the facilities we have available.
The only method of comparing the
strupetion is to draw up a specification
economics of two methods of con'
for a structure setting out the general
requirements then call tenders for de'
sign and construction in prestressed
concrete and alternative media. A
fair comparison cannot be obtained
if the structure is designed to be built
in one material then alternative tend'
ers called in prestressed concrete. To
be truly indicative of what prestressed
concrete can do the design of the
structure right from its inception must
take into account and make full use
of the characteristics which are pe'
culiar to this material. Even when
comparative tenders are obtained for
different forms of construction due
consideration must be given to such
factors as the useful life and mainten'
ance cost of the structures and the
speed with which they can be erected.
Prestressed concrete has proved
economical for the construction of rail'
way sleepers, bridges, and buildings
where a large expanse of floor space
uninterrupted by columns is required,
but in most of these cases there has
been a handicap on the chief competi'
tive material. Where prestressed con-
Crete sleepers are widely used suitable
timbers are unobtainable, and in the
case of bridges and buildings struct'
ural steel has been costly and not ah
way available. Where advantage can
be taken of the special qualities of
prestressed concrete there is seldom
any competition from ordinary rein-
forced concrete.
Prestressed concrete has also made
a rapid gain in popularity in America
during recent years. At first steel was
a fierce competitor in many fields,
but here again it received a han'
dicap when the Korean war made
such demands on American steel.
However, prestressed concrete has now
a foothold in that country and now
that hostilities have ceased we should
see a keen struggle between the two
materials.
Insufficient prestressed concrete jobs
have been completed in Australia so
far to permit an accurate assessment
of the type of work in which it can
be most economically used. However,
present indications are that it can com'
pete with alternative forms of construe'
tion in flat slab bridges up to 20 ft.
span and girder bridges (usually with
in situ concrete deck) up to 100 ft.
span particularly where precast pre-
tensioned units or precast units for
post'tensioning can be made at a con'
Crete products factory and transported
to the site. Precast prestressed con'
Crete floor beams and lintels are ah
ready proving to be time and money
savers and it will probably be found
that other building units can also be
economically made in this way.
Does It Conserve Vital Materials?
Steel is probably the most vital con'
struction material and it becomes even
more vital in time of war. Cement,
though not as vital in wartime, is,
nevertheless, a manufactured material
which makes a drain on our resources
of power, labour and minerals. By
using prestressed concrete considerable
saving can be effected in steel com'
pared with structural steel construction
and savings in both cement and con'
Crete can be effected compared with
ordinary reinforced concrete construe'
tion.
It has previously been unnecessary
and uneconomical to make concrete
with a compressive strength in excess
of about 3,000 lb. per sq. in. as the
size of flexural members was usually
controlled by the quantity of reinforc'
ing steel that had to be included
rather than the area of concrete re'
quired to resist compressive stresses.
Prestressing, on the other hand, uses
a smaller quantity of high tensile steel
which can be accommodated in a much
smaller section, consequently the con'
Crete strength becomes the limiting
factor.
It may be argued that since the
concrete must be of better quality
than that used in ordinary reinforced
concrete the total amount of cement
used may be the same. This is not
generally the case as the higher
strength is now obtained by better de'
sign of the mix. more rigid control
of its mixing and the use of mechani'
cal vibrators to compact it rather than
by increasing the cement content.
THE METHODS OF
PRESTRESSING CONCRETE.
There are many methods of apply'
ing prestress to concrete but these
can be classified in three main groups:
1. By transferring the stress from
stretched steel tendons to the
concrete.
2. By applying an external load to
the concrete.
3. By the use of a cement which
causes expansion of the concrete
against fixed abutments on set'
ting.
The first two methods are in general
use but the third has only been used
to a limited extent.
Use of Steel Tendons.
When a high tensile steel wire is
stretched, considerable energy is stot'
ed up within it in the form of stresses
tending to restore the wire to its or'
47

iginal length. If the wire can be an-
chored to the concrete in its stretched
condition this energy can be used to
induce a compressive prestress in the
concrete. The wire may be stretched
and the concrete cast around it so
that as it sets the wire is firmly held
within, or the concrete may be cast
with a hole in it so that when it has
gained sufficient strength the wire may
be passed through the hole, stretched
then anchored at the ends by mechan-
ical means. In the former case the
wire is said to be pretervsioned and in
the latter case it is post-tensioned.
In nearly all systems involving pre-
tensioning of the wire, reliance is
placed on the bond between the con-
crete and the wires to transfer stress
from one to the other, but post-tcn-
sioning systems may transfer stress by
end anchorage bond, or a combination
of both. For example, if the stretch-
ed wire passes through the centre of
a box girder or a cylindrical concrete
pole the only anchorage points will be
at the ends, if, as in the Rocla system
the wire is stretched through a pre-
formed hole in the concrete then
grouted in. transfer of stress will be
by bond, whereas in the case of the
Freyssinet and Magnel systems the
wires are anchored at their ends and
grouted into their ducts so that trans-
fer of stress is by both end anchorage
and bond with the concrete. It should
be made clear, however, that in the
latter systems bond is only an addition-
al means of transferring stress as full
anchorage is provided at the cable
ends.
High tensile alloy steel bars are also
used for the same purpose in the Lee-
McCall and certain German systems,
though the use of bars is confined to
post-tensioning systems using end an-
chorage.
Pre-tensioning; The pre-tensioning
method is most commonly used when
concrete units are precast either in in-
dividual moulds or on a long line pre-
tensioning bed. The wires must be
held in their stretched condition by
the moulds or tensioning heads until
the concrete has gained sufficient
strength and bond to carry the pre-
stress and prevent slip of the wires.
Only straight wires may be used so
that beams with large shearing stresses
require mild steel stirrups to resist the
tensile stresses from this cause. The
elastic shortening of the concrete mem-
ber when the pre-tensioned wires are
released and their stress transferred to
the concrete causes a certain loss of
prestress. Further loss of prestress is
caused in this system by shrinkage of
creep in the concrete and the steel is
common to all systems though its ex-
the concrete, oss of prestress due to
tent is affected to some degree by the
rate of stressing.
Post-tensioning: Whilst pre-ten-
sioning is mainly confined to wires,
post-tensioning can be applied to in-
dividual wires, groups of wires or
rods. Post-tensioning is mainly used
for on-the-job prestressing as the solid
formwork necessary to hold stretched
wires would be too expensive. Gird-
ers or columns may be cast in one
piece then prestressed by post-tension-
ing or cast in sections which are then
stressed into complete units either
before or after placing them in their
final position. Many of the losses of
prestress which occur in pre-tensioned
work are eliminated by post-tension-
ing. By applying the prestress to the
concrete after it has hardened very
little stress is lost due to shrinkage of
the concrete as the major part of this
takes place before stressing and since
the wires are jacked against the con-
crete elastic shortening of the mem-
ber takes place before the wires are
anchored, thus eliminating loss of pre-
stress from this cause. The only loss
of prestress to be contended with is
due to creep in the concrete and steel
and to a certain amount of deforma-
tion in the anchorage as the load is
transferred to it from the jack.
Ducts may be formed in the con-
crete as it is cast and the wires in the
form of cables or rods threaded
through these at a later stage or the
cables or rods may be cast in the con-
crete with a sheathing about them to
prevent bonding. Post-tensioning per-
mits curved cables to be used so that
prestressing counteracts tensile stresses
due to shear as well as those due to
bending.
Application of an External Load.
Concrete may also be prestressed by
compressing it between fixed abut-
ments with hydraulic or mechanical
jacks. Typical applications of this
method are for prestressing tunnel lin-
ings, dams, and pavements.
In tunnels the concrete is lacked
against the surrounding earth, dams
are jacked between the foundations
and the weight of the structure, and
pavements may be jacked against a
reinforced peripheral ring.
Use of Expanding Cement.
In France, M. .Henri Lossier has
carried out a great deal of research
on methods of making a cement which
will expand by controlled amounts on
hardening. Such a cement has been
used for underpinning work where its
qualities are extremely beneficial and
suggestions have been made that it
could be used to induce prestress in
concrete by causing it to expand
against fixed abutments or the an-
chorage of steel tendons. It appears
that more work needs to be done on
perfecting the cement before it can
be confidently used in prestressed
work.

There are few concrete structures in
which prestressing cannot be used in
some form or other, but it is not al-
ways economical or necessary to do so.
It cannot be stated definitely when
prestressing is a proposition or not as
this depends on the type of structure
being built, the facilities available for
building it and the conditions of ex-
posure it is likely to experience.
However, examples can be given of
its application to indicate the wide
range of structures in which prestress'
ing has proved successful from both
the economic and performance view-
point.
Precast Beams and Railway
Sleepers.
The simplest application of pre-
stressing is in the making of precast
prestressed concrete beams. The
maximum size of these is limited only
by the equipment available for tran-
sporting them and lifting them into
position. Beams of small cross sec-
tional area such as would be used as
lintels over window and door openings
are usually made rectangular in shape,
but larger beams are usually of I or
T section to obtain the most effective
distribution of concrete, reduce weight
and the cost of materials.
Concrete railway sleepers can be in-
cluded among those products which
lend themselves to precasting and pre-
stressing, particularly by the long line
system. A factory at Tallington, Lin-
colnshire, England, has a highly mech-
anised production line capable of mak-
ing 800 sleepers a day with a labour
requirement of two man hours per
sleeper. The pre-tensioning beds at
this factory are 450 ft. long and each
will accommodate 100 sleepers.
There is ample evidence in the Eng-
lish railways that the life of the con-
crete sleeper will exceed that of a tim-
ber sleeper and since the latter are
imported circumstances favour the
concrete sleeper. In many parts of
Australia timber sleepers now cost
about £2 each; it should be possible
to make a prestressed concrete sleeper
which contains about cu. ft. of
concrete and lb. of high tensile
steel for less than this price provided
that cement and suitable aggregates
are available.
Bridges.
Probably the biggest and certainly
the most spectacular field in which pre-
stressed concrete has so far been used
Tu* n construction of bridges.
This has been particularly so in Euro-
pean countries which were faced with
the problem of replacing war damaged
bridges in spite of the shortage of
structural steel.
It is not possible to say at precisely
what span one method of bridge con-
struction becomes unpractical and an-
other must be used, but taking a broad
view of the situation it is evident that
the methods vary with three general
classes of bridge: the short span, the
medium and long span, and the con-
tinuous span.
The Short Span Bridge. For bridges
up to about 30 ft. it is usually most
economical to precast and prestress the
beam units in a factory where the
methods of manufacture are most ef-
ficient. Precasting and post-tensioning
of bridge units on the site will not
show very much economy over normal
reinforced concrete until the span ex-
ceeds about 60 ft.
Spans in excess of about 30 ft. mav
be bridged with precast, post-tensioned
beams of I or T section laid with
their flanges in contact to form the
bridge deck or supporting a precast
or cast in situ deck. These beams
are usually prestressed laterally
through diaphragms placed at inter-
vals along their length.
The Medium and Long Span
Bridge. When the span of a bridge
exceeds about 30 ft. pre-tensioning be-
comes impractical and when the span
exceeds about 60 ft. the pre-casting of
the girders in one piece also becomes
impractical. Girders between 30 ft.
and 60 ft. long may be pre-cast in one
piece adjacent to the bridge site, pre-
stressed by post-tensioning the steel
tendons, then launched or lifted into
position on the abutments or piers.
The construction of the approaches
to the concrete arch bridges on the
Venezuelan highway from Caracas to
La Guaira is a good example of the
use of this method. The girders in
this case span 48 ft. and were precast
in one length at a yard near the
bridge site. The steel moulds used
had to be quite rigid to allow refuse
more than 100 times and withstand
vibration during the placing of the
concrete.
The bridges which M. Freyssinet de-
signed to span the Marne River in
France are notable examples of the
application of pre-casting and pre-
stressing to bridge construction. The
first of these constructed was the Luz-
ancy Bridge. In this case the prob-
lem was to provide a bridge between
existing abutments 180 ft. apart with-
in a depth of 4 ft. 3 in. between the
specified road level and the clearance
required by navigation. M. Freyssinet
provided a design for a two-hinged
shallow portal arch with a depth of
4 ft. 2 in. at the crown, approximate-
ly one-fortieth of the span.
The quality of concrete necessary in
this bridge was such that it was de-
cided to precast the arch girders in a
factory where better control of the
quality could be maintained. Each
section was about 8 ft. long and
weighed about 5 tons. These were
temporarily prestressed into longer
units and transported to the site where
they were set in place by lifting
cables. The complete girder was then
prestressed by Freyssinet cables and
jacks.

spans (the central one 36 ft. and the
outside ones 59 ft.) was constructed
over a railwav at NeufchateLen'Brav,
France. In this case all beams were
precast and prestressed on the ground,
then lifted into position to form a
three span simple beam bridge. Con'
tinuity was then obtained by stressing
nine additional cables placed in the
tops of the beams running between
the centre span and a point in the
outside beams 12 ft. beyond the sup'
ports.
The Selayn Bridge over the River
Meuse in Belgium is an example of a
two span continuous bridge in which
the prestressing cables have been kept
straight and the variation in bending
moments taken care of by adjusting
the moment of inertia of the section
and the location of the neutral axis.
The two main spans of this bridge
are 206 ft. long and consist of hollow
box girders with two longitudinal stiff'
ening diaphragms.
Buildings.
Probably the greatest advantages to
be obtained by prestressing concrete
in buildings are:
• Reduction in cross sectional area
of the structural members with a cor'
responding reduction in dead weight
and wasted space.
• Structural units can be precast in
a few moulds thus eliminating costly
formwork on the job which is also
an impedance to other operations.
• Continuity of a number of pre'
cast units can be obtained by post'
stressing.
• Larger areas can be covered with
the aid of fewer columns than are
necessary in normal reinforced con'
Crete work.
• Better performance of the build'
ing under working loads and wind
loads is obtained with less concrete
than would be used in normal rein'
forced construction.
• Hair cracking can be completely
eliminated thus reducing the likeli'
hood of deterioration of the concrete
due to deleterious materials that may
be processed or stored within the
building.
• The use of precast prestressed
units eliminates delays in construction
which are inevitable when ordinary
reinforced concrete is used.
Precast Prestressed Beams. The hang'
ar at London Airport is 900 ft. long,
110 ft. wide and 43 ft. high to the
underside of the roof beams—the
whole of the area is clear space unin'
terrupted by columns. Reinforced
concrete pylons along the front and
rear walls support the roof members
which are all precast and prestressed
either by pre'tensioning or post'ten'
sioning. The hangar door openings
which are 150 ft. wide are spanned
by a concrete hollow box girder 14
ft. deep by 5 ft. 3 in. wide with side
walls 4 in. thick, a 5-| in. thick bot'
tom slab and an 8 in. thick top slab.
The girder was cast in situ and pre'
stressed by post'tensioning, and is

Story of a Sprinkler
A
In 1882, American Frederick Grinnell
patented an automatic sprinkler sys-
tem. Other sprinklers had come and
gone. His proved so successful it was
soon putting an instant end to fires all
over America, England and Europe.
In 1889, Wormald Brothers began
large-scale installations of Grinnell
sprinklers in this country.
That first sprinkler head, efficient
though it was, has gone through suc-
cessive improvements right up to
the streamlined, split-second-action
sprinkler Wormald Brothers Industries
now instals.
Today, there are almost 2,000,000
Grinnell sprinklers protecting 2,600
buildings in Australia and New
Zealand. Each installation is tailored
to individual needs—experienced fire
protection engineers have world know-
ledge of Grinnell to draw upon.
Today, in Australia and New Zealand
alone there is over a billion pounds'
worth of property protected by
Grinnell.

vals. A total of forty-one 0.2 in.
diam. 12-wire cables was used in the
side walls and the bottom slab.
Shell Roofs With Pre-stressed
Edge Beams. The extensive applica-
tion of pre-stressed concrete to build-
ing construction in post-war years co-
incided with the application of thin
shell concrete roofs, and these forms
of construction have been combined
to good effect in structures such as
the Karachi Airport Hangar which
has a clear floor space of 396 ft. by
130 ft. The roof is supported on
columns at the rear and on two 190
ft. span beams over the door open-
ings at the front. The roof is a 2 in.
thick continuous concrete shell roof
with pre-stressed edge beams spanning
the 130 ft. width. The edge beams
were cast in situ and pre-stressed by
post-tensioning. The cables were en-
closed in a steel sheath to prevent
bend, and cast in the beam in a curv-
ed position. After tensioning and an-
choring the cables at the ends they
were grouted for protection.
A continuous cylindrical shell roof
with pre-stressed edge beams was also
used on the bus garage built for the
Bournemouth Corporation. The span
of the shells is 150 ft., the largest yet
constructed, and the length of the
building is 300 ft., giving an area of
45,000 sq. ft. of completely uninter-
rupted floor space.
Multi - Storey Continuous Frame
Buildings. The Telephone Manager’s
office at Kelburn, England, was the
first multi-storey building to be con-
structed in Britain in which continu-
ous frames made up of pre-stressed
beams has been used.
The frame of the five-storey build-
ing consists of cast in situ reinforced
concrete columns and cast in situ pre-
stressed concrete beams. The Magnel-
Blaten system of prestressing was
adopted and continuity between
beams and columns was obtairied by
passing the beam cables through the
columns and anchoring them on the
outside face.
The cables were so positioned in the
beams to prevent rotation of the beam
relative to the column during pre-
stressing. The beams on the first
three floors were 2ft. siin. deep, Ift.
3in. wide and spanned 45ft. 3in. Be-
tween these main beams which were
spaced at 12ft. centres were placed
secondary beams of inverted T section
which were pre-cast and pre-tensioned
on the long line system. An interest-
ing feature of this fob is that the
main beams were not pre-stressed until
most of the floor system had been
completed, and this enabled a beam

of smaller section to be used as the
tensile stresses due to pre-stressing the
unloaded beam had not to be contend-
ed with.
The Metropolitan Water, Sewerage
and Drainage Board, Sydney, has the
honour of having constructed the first
multi-storey building in which col-
umns as well as beams were pre-cast
and pre-stressed. This building,
which is 101 ft. high and 39ft. x 33ft.
in plan, houses the ice-making equip-
ment at the Board’s Warragamba Dam
constructipn site.
The columns and beams were pre-
cast on the ground. The columns,
which were 76 ft. long and weighed
13 tons, were pre-stressed on the
ground then lifted and placed in their
foundation sockets. The pre-cast
beams were then placed in position
and pre-stressed by tensioning cables
passing through them and the sup-
porting columns thus providing con-
tinuity between these members. The
Freyssinet system was used in the con-
struction of this building.
PAVEMENTS.
Pre-stressing is now being applied
to concrete pavement construction to
reduce the occurrence of cracking, in-
crease its load carrying capacity per
inch of thickness and to increase its
flexibility under high overloads.
Many ideas have been put forward
as to the means of pre-stressing con-
crete pavements but the most success-
ful so far used involve the post-ten-
sioning of high tensile steel wires
within the slab.
The runway pavement at Orly in
France illustrates the application of
pre-stressing in this field of construc-
tion. M. Freyssinet was responsible
for devising the method of prestress'
ing used in this case. The pavement
which is 1.380 ft. long and 200 ft.
wide is pre-cast concrete slabs 3’ 3”
square and 63:” thick laid on a sand
base. Diagonal roller joints divide the
pavement into large isosceles triangles
with their apexes alternately opposed.
Transverse pre-stressing cables laid
between each row of slabs and ten-
sioned to 69 tons per sq. in. induce a
longitudinal pre-stress in the pavement
by forcing it against pre-stressed abut-
ments at the ends of the runway. A
120 ft. wide taxiway at London air-
port was constructed in a similar
manner.
Experimental work has been carried
out by the Cement and Concrete As-
sociation, England, to determine the
best layout for pre-stressing cables in
road pavements and several sections of
pre-stressed pavement have actually
been laid on public roads; however,
there still seems to be some doubt as
to whether the best method of pre-
stressing pavements has yet been de-
veloped.
TANKS.
Probably the most obvious applica-
tion of prestressing is to the building
of liquid containing structures. By
ensuring that the walls of such struc-
tures always remain in compression,
hair-cracking, which causes leaks and
deterioration, can be avoided. The
use of highly stressed steel wires in-
stead of large quantities of mild steel
reinforcement also enables the wall
thickness, and consequently the quant-
ity of concrete required, to be reduc-
ed.
Several prestressing systems can be
applied to circular tank construction,
but most of them have one major han-
dicap—a considerable amount of pre-
stress is lost by friction between the
wires and the concrete. A system de-
veloped by the Preload Corporation,
an American company, overcomes this
trouble by winding the wires on the
outside of the tank under tension. A
thin wall of concrete is first construct-
ed then high tensile steel wire is
wound on to it after being drawn
through a reducing die mounted on a
trolley which drags itself around the
wall. The wire winding is then pro-
tected by a layer of gunite.
PIPES.
The first use made of prestressed
concrete in Australia was in pipe con-
struction and the techniques developed
by Rocla Pipes Ltd. are probably
better than those in use anywhere else
in the world. Two different methods
of prestressing are used by this firm
depending on the diameter of the pipe
being made.
Pipes up to about 30in. diameter
are prestressed by subjecting the re-
inforced pipe wall to an internal pres-
sure before the concrete has set. The
pressure is maintained until the con'
Crete has hardened sufficiently then
released so that the pipe wall is plac'
ed in compression by transfer of stress
from the steel to the concrete. Large
pipes are prestressed by a method
similar to the Preload process already
described.
TUNNELS.
Tunnels, which are merely a form
of piping, also benefit from pre-stress-
ing. They either carry liquids which
must be prevented from escaping or
dry traffic that must be protected from
inundation by surrounding ground
waters. To perform either of these
functions effectively the lining must
remain crack free under the action of
internal pressure and the stresses set
up in the concrete whilst hardening.
Pre'stressing also allows a thinner lin-
ing to be used thus requiring less ex'
cavation and less concrete for a given
tunnel capacity than would be neces'
sary for the normal reinforced lining.

ADELAIDE NEWSLETTER
Damage from the earthquake which
rocked Adelaide early this month is
still being assessed. Insurance com'
panies face a record pay'out, and con'
tracts for repair work are flooding into
architects’ and builders’ offices. The
total cost may not be far short of
£1,000,000. The Deputy'Director of
War Service Homes (Mr. J. F.
O’Callaghan) estimates it will take
£200,000 to repair 3000 damaged War
Service Homes in the metropolitan
area. He is calling immediate tenders
for 50 badly'hit dwellings—sections of
some will have to be pulled down.
Main repair items in the city were
fallen masonry and cracked walls, but
the spire of Maughan Church has had
to be completely demolished. Marion
Council is employing an architect to
advise householders in the area. In
Darlington, many homes have been
condemned and will ultimately have to
be pulled down.
Heavy inroads have been made into
plaster supplies, but the quantity on
hand is expected to be sufficient. The
President of the S.A. Institute of
Architects (Mr. W. T. Haslam) has
warned that the full extent of the
damage may not be known until after
the winter rains. Clay sub'soils were
particularly dry when the earthquake
occurred and, once rain falls, will exert
a strong upward force. Cracking of
foundations set into the clay will then
be fully apparent.
Jaywoth Tiles Ltd. will erect a Bes'
ser Vibrapac concrete block'making
machine at their Rosewater plant. It
will be the first installed in Australia.
Jaywoth’s managing director, Mr. John
Wotherspoon, expects the initial out'
put of concrete masonry units to be
the equivalent of 50,000 Adelaide'type
bricks a day—enough to ease Ade'
laide’s chronic materials shortage. It
should be in full production by
August. The Vibrapac, already in
Adelaide, is the latest in electronically
controlled block'making machinery de'
veloped by the Besser Manufacturing
Co. of Michigan (U.S.). About 800
are in use in America. Mr. Wother'
spoon returned late last year from a
six month tour, during which he
studied American and Canadian build'
ing methods. A new concept of build'
ing has grown up in America with the
use of , concrete masonry units for all
aspects of construction, he says.
Cracking has been eliminated by steam
curing—a process which his firm will
use from the outset of their concrete
block operations. Fully 80 per cent,
of concrete bricks made in Adelaide
are not steam cured.
All handling in connection with the
Vibrapac machine is done by forkdift
truck. Jaywoth Tiles has been pro'
ducing roofing tiles for the past seven
years. Large'scale expansion is plan'
ned. The factory buildings at Rose'
water will be enlarged this year. The
firm will also begin production of Jay'
woth Dry Aggregate, and ready-mixed
concrete.
A specially'designed rail siding will
be built east of Nairne and used to
tiansport pyrites to the £2,000,000 sub
phuric acid plant now under construe'
tion at Port Adelaide. Cost of the
siding, estimated at £65,000, will be
shared by the Government and Nairne
Pyrites Ltd. Plans will be prepared by
the Highways and Railways depart-
ments. The new plant at Port Ade'
laide —South Australia’s biggest single
industrial project since the war —is
scheduled for completion by the end
of the year. The principal contractors
are Simon'Carves (Australia) Pty. Ltd.
Construction is going ahead rapidly
and the skyline in this important in-
dustrial area changes almost daily.

THE IMPORTANCE OF
FENESTRATION.
The great importance of fenestration in
a building is well portrayed in this new

back from the facade, thus providing
deep reveals, mullions and heads. It
is the Montecstini Building in Milan and
it occupies a triangular site between
three streets.

being erected at the Port Adelaide
plant. Foundations and concrete super'
structural work are almost complete.
Above this, structural steelwork is
rising fast. Roasters, which will roast
pyrites from the Adelaide Hills, are
under construction. Bases 30 feet in
diameter and 30 feet high, for two of
the three roasters, have been set up.
Work on the third base will begin
shortly. The cylindrically shaped
roasters will be 60 feet high. Steel
columns, 75 feet long, fabricated in
Adelaide, have been erected to enclose
the 90 feet high roaster house. Four
steel fabricated towers to enclose lead
vessels for cooling and washing gases
from the roasters are now ready to
receive their lead shells. The acid
plant when finished will be the biggest
in the Southern Hemisphere and will
make Australia’s supply of super-
phosphate more secure.
It has provided a flood of orders for
local contractors. Subcontracts worth
more than £500,000 have been let in
Australia, of which more than half has
gone to South Australian engineering
firms.
More than £362,000 was spent on
improving South Australian hotels last
year. Only £270,000 was spent in
1952. The superintendent of licensed
premises, Mr. C. Eldridge, when de-
livering his annual report to the Mid-
land Licensing Court, said many new
and attractive bars had been built, and
beer gardens added, thus relieving the
pressure in overcrowded bars and
lounges. Nearly £215,000 had been
spent during the year on furniture,
plant and equipment. Some licensees
had been asked to enlarge their bars,
following complaints about drinking
on footpaths outside hotels, Mr.
Eldridge said.
The current flurry of hotel building
is continuing. A tender has been ac-
cepted for erection of the new Albion
Hotel in Churchill Road, Kilburn. The
contractors, Emmett & Sons Ltd., hope
the work will be finished by Christmas.
The building will be two-storeyed, with
saloon, public, and two cocktail bars,
and two lounges. Fourteen bedrooms
will be provided in a construction of
steel, concrete and cream brick. The
architects, Messrs. Caradoc Ashton,
Fisher, Woodhead & Beaumont Smith,
have provided for the hotel to be set
well back from the street alignment,
behind expansive lawns and gardens.
Car parking space has been allowed
for, and the building will be partially
central heated. The contract price is
undisclosed, but an earlier estimate of
construction costs was £60,000.
Nearing completion is the £50,000
job ot adding a new bar building to
the Loxton Club Hotel. Work has
been in progress since last July and
should be finished by June. The build'
ing—one of several major hotel con-
tracts since the war —will include an
island bar counter 185 feet long, the
longest in the State. The designs pro'
vide for a public bar, beer-receiving
platform, toilets and staff changerooms,
all in a total area of 5160 square feet.
A basement covering the whole of that
area will accommodate goods'delivery
and bottle'washing sections, coolroorn
and boiler room. The building is 108
feet by 40, with ceiling and wall sur-
faces acoustically treated and insulated.
Windows will comprise most of the
frontage. Architects for the job are
Philip R. Claridge & Gunn. Nuriootpa
builder C. O. Juncken has the contract.
The University of Adelaide this
month began a three-year concrete re'
search project. One of the aims is the
introduction to South Australia of a
new and lighter concrete. Professor F.
B. Bull, head of the University’s Civil
Engineering Department, is leading the
investigations. The properties of mate'
rials mixed with cement will be probed
and this may result in improved
quality of concrete already in use here.
Cement and quarrying companies,
architects and other interested parties
have raised £3OOO to back the research.
Professor Bull and his two assistants
hope to develop a simple way of
making high- quality concrete from
materials available in South Australia
for mixing with cement. Standard
European or U.S. works on concrete
making do not necessarily apply here
because of the different materials used.
The research will include a survey of
such local concreting materials as hills
quartzite and natural sands. As supply
of suitable concreting sands is limited,
the research will be based on the as'
sumption that it will eventually be
necessary to substitute crushed rock for
sand.
South Australian churches will spend
about £200,000 this year on homes
for pensioners and aged people of
limited means. The State Government
has offered a £ for £ subsidy up to
£300,000. Among church moves ex-
pected shortly are:—
® An application by the Baptist
Union for a retrospective subsidy of
£12,000. This will go toward the cost
of a new wing at the Baptist Home for
the Aged, Norwood, and help to pay
off the £24,000 debt incurred in the
extensions.
• The Church of England will
launch an appeal in April tor funds
to build a £20,000 women's wing at
St Laurence’s Home for the Aged,
Grange.
• An appeal for funds to build a
new block for women and married
couples at the Methodist Home, Mai-
vern.
• Discussions on the possibility of
extending the Congregational Church’s
home for the aged.
A new Catholic school is being built
at the corner of Swan Street and Mili-
tary Road, Semaphore. Cost is esti'
mated at £36,000. The construction
is two-storeyed, of red brick with a
corrugated asbestos roof. It will in'
elude a kindergarten, ten classrooms
and subsidiary rooms. Building will
take about ten months. The architect
is E. A. Keal. F. Fricker Ltd. is the

A cheap new building material has
been placed on the Adelaide market
by Fred. Ingham & Co., of Dudley
Park. Known as Gypseal wall board,
it was developed by the firm’s manag'
ing director, Mr. Gordon Ingham. He
claims Gypseal. used in an eleven'
storey building, would be £9OOO

BUILDING WITH WEST HANGING WALLS.
This unusual building includes two-s+orey offices and a single-storey research lab-
oratory for a cotton mill at Fort Mill in South Carolina, U.S.A. In order to shield
the interior from the direct rays of the sun, the windows slant outwards and upwards
at 45 degrees. This necessitated the cantilevering of each succeeding wall over
the continuous projecting window-heads, another four feet. The floor beams canti-
lever beyond their outer columns and the walls which are brick-faced with lime
stone trim are hung from the cantilevers.

cheaper than orthodox construction.
The new material was officially launch-
ed this month at a cocketail party held
in a two-storey building at Colley Ter-
race, Glenelg, which is being reno-
vated with Gypseal. About twenty ex-
perts, including State and Federal
Government officials, architects, and
builders, were shown over the struc-
ture. The sole ingredient of Gypseal
wall board is gypsum, made to a stan-
dard size of nine feet eight inches by
19 inches, with a thickness of 3|
inches. Both faces are ready for paint-
ing or tiling without further attention,
apart from stopping the nine-foot ver-
tical joint between adjoining slabs.
Gypseal is a solid lightweight material,
speedy, cheap, vermin-proof, and with
a hard finish.
In the Colley Terrace building it is
impossible to distinguish the Gypseal
walls from ordinary plastered brick.
Interesting features include the conceal-
men tof water pipes and electric wir-
ing in circular cavities running the
full length of the slab. The wall slabs
—area about 14 square feet —are easily
handled. Two men can fix them into
position in a matter of minutes. Mr.
Ingham has spent £lO,OOO developing
the material. His firm has only a low-
production pilot plant in operation
now, but the output will be quad-
rupled when new units under order
are installed. If reactions from the
trade are favourable, mass production
could be under way inside three
months.
1954 has been a slack year for the
Commonwealth Works Department.
One of the biggest jobs so far is the
building of a P.M.G. communications
block at Berri. The job—estimated to
cost about £30,000 —has gone to the
Adelaide Building Co. Work has al-
ready started and should be completed
within eight months. The structure
will be two-storey, of reinforced con-
crete and brick, with concrete floors
and roof. The design is orthodox,
very similar to that of the communica-
tions building now under construction
at Balaklava.
A number of medium-sized and
minor contracts have been let during
the past month. Among these was the
contract for erecting a Memorial Hall
at The Wilderness School, Medindie.
The builder, S. J. Weir, hopes to
finish the job in about six months, and
cost is estimated at £15,000 . Some-
thing new in school halls is the placing
of the stage, facing the breadth instead
of the length of the building. This
is intended to create a friendly atmos-
phere, as most performances will be by
children. The architects are Dean W.
Berry & Gilbert.
Work has begun on the new Murray
Bridge Soldiers Memorial Clubrooms
and Hall. It will include one main
room, three smaller rooms, and a kit-
chen. The £BOOO contract went io
J. McKechnie, of Murray Bridge. W.
L. Brune, of Adelaide, was the archi-
tect.
A factory, designed by Milne,
Dawkins, Boehm and Ellis, is being
built at St. Marys for Florover
Polishers Ltd. It will be constructed
mainly of brick, along clean, modern
lines. S. J. Weir is the contractor.
The contract is in the under £IO,OOU
bracket.
The Henley and Grange Council is
seeking more time to complete fore-
shore restoration work. Ihe Govern-
ment grant of more than £200,000 tor
beach repairs was conditional on the
work being completed by June 30.
Work is lagging at Henley, and the
Council is seeking a further grant to
complete the remaining section ot sea-
wall on the southern foreshore. At
Glenelg, reconstruction is nearly com-
pleted. A fisherman s ramp at Farrell
Street is already in use and a start has
been made on erection of dwarf wall-
ing along the western side of Colley
Reserve. The seawall opposite Mose-
ley Square and walling and steps along
Broadway have been completed.
The South Australian Homebuilders’
Club Secretary, Mr. E. Hargreaves,
has received a letter from a home-
builders’ club in New Zealand seeking
advice on organisation and methods.
The request is ironic, coming at a time
when all is not well with the local body.
. . . Membership has dropped to 22(J,
well below last year’s peak of nearly
300, and the building rate has fallen
off seriously. The record building pace
over the past eighteen months has re-
leased many experienced men from
their commitments and new members
are not coming forward. However,
the committee scoffs at suggestions that
private home-building on the club basis
may be on the way out and a drive
has been undertaken for new members.
Royal Visit.
South Australia’s Royal Visit was an
outstanding success, as has been the
case in other parts of Australia and
countries privileged in being visited by
our beloved royal couple.
Her Majesty The Queen and His
Royal Highness The Duke of Edin-
burgh were received enthusiastically
by cheering thousands throughout the
State.
Although Her Majesty did not visit
any industrial undertakings, one of the
highlights of the Duke of Edinburgh’s
visit was his officiating at the opening
of Edinburgh Airfield at Salisbury,
centre of the Long Range Weapons
Establishment activities, and his, fob
lowing visit to Woomera Rocket
Range.
At Woomera he inspected all stages
of guided missile warfare, including
the flight of South Australian-made
Jindivilc pilotless aircraft and the firing
of 17ft. rockets.
New Saw Mill At Mt. Gambler.
When the new £1,000,000 central
saw mill is completed at Mount Gam-
bier, the annual capacity of the main
south-east mills will be increased from
45,000,000 super, feet to 85,000,000
super, feet.
A Victorian construction firm has
been successful with a £lOO,OOO tender
for erection of steel-framed buildings
at the site. The buildings will include
log mill, planing mill, dry stock
storage, workshops, and mill store.
Employment in the central mill will
be provided for between three and four
hundred men.
Continued on page 65
RECORD FOR FLAT-BUILDING.
Victorian Housing Commission workmen
recently set a State record for flat-
building by erecting the walls of a four-
unit two-storey block in under four days.
When in full operation, one such four-
unit block will be completed each week.
All structural components are made in
the Commission's pre-fabricated concrete
house factory at Holmsglen. Huge
diesel floats cart the 4in. outer walls
and Bin. inner walls to the building site
in nine loads. Cranes swing the walls
into position (see illustration), carpent-
ers add the pre- fabricated roof and
floor frames by the end of the first
week, and the tiles, also made at
Holmsglen, are laid within 14 days. The
flats are finished, with all fittings, in 40
days.

Latest Developments In Civil
Engineering.
The University of Adelaide Professor
of Civil Engineering (Professor F. B.
Bull) said recently that a course deal-
ing with recent developments in struc-
tural engineering and other modern
aspects of civil engineering would com-
mence on April 6.
Each week throughout the Univer-
sity year a one-hour lecture would be
given. Enrolment is open to graduates
and any other interested persons.
United States Ambassador
Visits South Australia.
South Australia, which has been
without a resident United States Vice-
Consul, recently received a brief visit
from the United States Ambassador to
Australia, Mr. Amos Peaslee.
Mr. Peaslee’s main mission to South
Australia was to visit the State's main
uranium fields. Accompanied by the
Premier (Hon. Thomas Playford) and
Minister for Mines (Hon. A. Lyell
McEwin), Mr. Peaslee visited the new
field at Myponga and also the near-
completed, full-scale production field
at Radium Hill.
More Diesel-electric Locomotives
For South Australian Railways.
The South Australian Railways’ fleet
of ten 900-class diesel-electric locomo-
tives is to be increased to sixteen units.
Approval has been given to Railways
Department to purchase the further six
locomotives at an estimated cost of
<£Boo,ooo.
New Bridge Over River
Murray?
If efforts of Parliamentary and Local
Government representatives of the
River Murray districts, embracing
Loxton, Waikerie and Blanchetown,
are successful, road users who have
experienced delays at the Blanchetown
punt will at some future date witness
the erection of a high-level steel bridge
over the river at that point.

Plans and specifications of the

Approximate cost of the bridge is

Bitumen Costs Too High.
A suggestion has been made by an
Adelaide suburban mayor (Mr. O. H.
Atkinson) that metropolitan councils
in South Australia should combine to
buy bitumen'spraying equipment and
import bitumen in bulk from the
United States of America.
Only one oil company supplies hot
bitumen in South Australia, at a cost
of 3/2£ a gallon, which includes spray'
ing. Mr. Atkinson feels a substantial
saving could be gained by the councils
combining and purchasing their sup*
plies in bulk. Campbelltown Council,
of which Mr. Atkinson is Mayor,
spends about £5OOO annually on bitu'
menising roads.
Housing Trust Breaks Record.
Figures released recently by the
Premier (Hon. Thomas Playford)
gave indications of the progress made
by South Australian Housing Trust in
the twelve months ending 31st Decern'
ber, 1953.
A record number of houses were
built in the year, 3856 in all, plus 22
emergency dwellings. In the previous
year, 3196 houses and 683 emergency
dwellings were erected.
South Australia’s major housing
scheme authority has now been func'
tioning smoothly and satisfactorily
since 1937, and shortly the 20,000 th
house vvill be completed.
In the first thirteen years of existence
the Trust built 10,000 houses, the
second 10,000 have been built in three
years.
Rent receivable for the year ending
31st December, 1954, will total

Commonwealth Railways
To Increase Fleet.
The first of fourteen new 3ft. 6in.
gauge diesehelectric locomotives is ex'
pected to be delivered to the Com-
monwealth Railways in May.
For use on the Port Augusta' Alice
Springs (775 miles) and Darwin'
Birdun (400 miles) lines, the locomo'
tives are overdue in delivery by
eighteen months and were recently
stated by the Federal Transport Minis'
ter (Senator G. McLeay) to have
caused the Railways Department great
hardships due to the delay.
Built by the Birmingham Railway
Carriage and Waggon Company, Eng'
land, the locomotives are AIA'AIA
wheel arrangement.
Leading dimensions are 42ft. over'
head stocks, 9ft. 4in. width, 12ft. Sin.
high, and approximate weight with full
complement of fuel is tons.
The diesel power unit will be a
Sulzer 955 h.p. type 6LDA2B engine
with Sulzer turbine blower, both main
and auxiliary generators are supplied
by the engine.
A speed of 50 m.p.h. maximum will
be rigidly controlled by a warning de'

The State Housing Commission has
set up its own team of workmen to
erect blocks of two'Storey flats in con'
Crete which are being completed in
twelve weeks. The walls are precast
in the Holmsglen factory, following
the “Fowler” patent, which has been
used by the Commission for the erec*
tion of thousands of single unit dwell'
ings throughout the State.
The precast outer walls are four
inches thick and the internal walls
three inches.
Each wall is in one piece and is
locked at the corners. At the first
floor level a concrete slab is laid on
top of the ground floor walls. Each
slab interlocks with the other. On this
slab the walls for the first floor units
are then set up. The erection of the
walls and floor slab is being done in
two or three days, leaving the building
ready for the other trades to follow
through.
The stair between ground and first
floor is in precast concrete, sitting on
a concrete slab at ground floor and
resting on a beam at first floor level.
For the first floor unit a timber
floor is laid over the concrete slab.
In the planning a duct is placed be'
tween the units to carry all plumbing
lines and the stove flue. It also serves
as a ventilation shaft. A precast flue
is provided in each living room wall
for a gas fire.
An improvement has been made in
the pouring of the concrete walls; they
now come off with a clean, smooth
surface which only requires to be
painted or coloured. A texture finish
is given the outside surface of the
walls.
These buildings are being covered
with cement tiles which the Commis'
sion is now making in its own works.
The Commission is now using cop'
per pipes for all water plumbing and
for spouting. The use of this material,
it is claimed, will considerably reduce
maintenance costs.
Each block has a separate communal
laundry and each tenant has a small
store or workroom for his own use.
In recent weeks the Commission has
been completing one of these blocks
each week. This will shortly be in'
creased to two a week.
Buchan, Laird and Buchan, Archi'
tects, have planned a six'storey build'
for a vacant block on the north side

SKILLED CRAFTSMANSHIP.
This unique figure of Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II stands in the foyer
of the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage &
Drainage Board Building In Sydney, and
was the main feature of the Board's
elaborate Royal Tour decorations.
It is the work of Mr, Albert Angus,
who is the Acting Assistant Chief
Superintendent of House Services, Met-
ropolitan Water, Sewerage & Drainage
Board, Sydney.
The bust was bossed from one piece
of sheet lead, measuring 2ft. 3in. in
diameter and .08in. thick; no joins were
made and no moulds were used. The
work was hollow until the final details
were formed. However, to prevent
damage, the bust is now supported by a
steel rod and lined with cement.
Although the work is a hobby, it took
approximately 200 hours to complete,
spread over twelve months. A variety of
tools were used ranging from the normal
lead-working kit to a nail and a chisel.
This is the fifth bust that Mr. Angus
has completed, having previously created
busts of Voltaire, Sir Charles Kingsford
Smith. His late Majesty King George VI,
and Sir Winston Churchill, in each case
only working from a picture; the likeness
of the features is excellent.

the construction of the swimming pool
estimated to cost £300,000 at
Olympic Park.
At the site for the new Olympic
pool the Housing Commission erected
a six-room, precast concrete house,
ready for occupation by the caretaker,
in 15 days. Because of the poor foun-
dation on the site the house was built
on a concrete raft.
A new industry is to be established
in Victoria to manufacture wallboards
from wheaten straw. The boards will
be 4ft. wide and 2in. thick, sheeted
on each surface with kraft paper. It
is claimed that the boards can be used
for self-supporting walls for a house
without framing. The announcement
was made by Mr. Stoneham, Minister
for State Development.
The Public Works Department has
let a contract for £35,490 to G. A.
Winwood Pty. Ltd., Richmond, for a
two-storey police station at Fitzroy.
On the upper floor there will be 11
single bedrooms, lounge and dining
room for unmarried constables.
The first work on the Olympic Vil-
lage at Heidelberg has been authorised.
The Board of Works has been given
authority to construct the necessary
sewers, by day labour, at an estimated
cost of £125,000.
The Olympic Village will ultimately
become part of the Commission’s
Housing Estate and will comprise
single unit houses, “row” houses and
blocks of two-storey flats which, after
the Games, can be converted into or-
dinary residences. There will be some
temporary dining rooms and kitchens,
some of which, it is expected, will be
converted into halls for the use of the
housing community.
To improve the water supply to the
suburbs and end water restrictions the
Board of Works has approved a
scheme to cost about £3,650,000.
The first stages, to cost £630,000
and to be completed before next Sum-
mer, will bring an improved water sup-

never forget, and we ought never to
let them forget it either. fEd. —I

TERMINAL STATION
FOR GREYHOUND MOTOR
COACHES.
By F. O. NIXON.
The fine exterior and interior pic'
tures of the building erected for Grey'
hound Coaches Pty. Ltd. at Melbourne
Street, corner of Hope Street, South
Brisbane, that appeared on page 27
of your March issue of “Building:
Lighting: Engineering,” writes Mr. F.
O. Nixon, is an indication that railways
have not by any means a monopoly of
passenger transport to country centres
serviced by Greyhound motor coaches.
The City of Toowoomba, the first
hometown of the Company, is more
largely catered for than other towns.
Three coaches run each day, each
way, and they average about 240 pas'
sengers daily.
Both in distance and in time saved
by motor coaches, compared with pas'
senger trains, the former has distinct
advantages for busy people, although
to sightseers the railway journey over
the Main Range, where the fine views
and the display of outstanding railroad
engineering, has many advantages.
The railway distance, Brisbane to
Toowoomba, is 101 miles, and the
time taken is 4 hours 20 minutes. In
the last 19 miles below the range to
Toowoomba elevation, 1924 feet
the rise is 1128 feet from Murphy’s
Creek, the scene of a great railway
double disaster many years ago.
Much of the motor highway to
Toowoomba is picturesque. The time
taken by Greyhound Coaches for the
shorter road journey of 85 miles is
one hour less than the time taken by
trains, notwithstanding there are fifteen
stopping places, including one of fif'
teen minutes for refreshments. The
splendid new building, of brick and
concrete, does full justice to an efficient
coaching service.
The fact that the Minister for Trans'
port, Hon. J. E. Duggan, officially
opened the terminal station in com'
plimentary terms is evidence of the
broadminded attitude of railway heads
towards passenger ' trade collaboration
more truly than competition. The pro'
moter of this service, Mr. A. R.
Penfold, was quite sure of the need
for it, after some years of experience
of the Greyhound service from a less
convenient depot in Brisbane.
The new building, one storey with
an office mezzanine, is placed about
40ft. back from the street level so as
to allow for a porch or awning of

generous proportions. Rainfall is
taken care of by pipes built within
the four concrete pillars. It is very
centrally situated, nearly opposite the
South Brisbane Interstate Station and
close to the South Brisbane State rail'
way systems. It is also on the tram'
line.
As the building neared completion,
a dispute arose when the Brisbane City
Council took exception to the en'
trances across the footpath that were
being prepared. Aldermanic adaman'
tive objection was sealed by the Coun'
cil when it planted trees along the
footpath just where the company had
planned to have driveuns for their
coaches . As two of the vehicles are
often under the massive awning at
one time, the curtailment of entrance
and exit facilities planned was dis'
couraging. However, that appears to
have been overcome, and a line of
young trees and liberal loading and
unloading space prevail in harmonious
relationship.
The necessity for ample cloakroom
space arises from the fact that this ter'
minal is a feeder to, and is fed by,
other transport services . A newspaper
and magazine stall and the cafe at one
end of the building overcame the need
to go further afield when passengers

storing and registration facilities, as
well as amenities on the most com'
plete scale, providing for changing and
washing rooms, and for the male, shav-
ing, on a floor area of 172 ft. by 24ft.
Well-known builders, H. Sanham 6?
Sons, have succeeded, as usual, in
erecting a building that does this firm
credit. The terminal building of 190
feet in length and 62 feet deep pro'
vides an area of 11,780 square feet,
and the adjunct for reserve coaches a
further depth of 53 feet, which brings
the gross area to 21,850 square feet.
The brick and concrete construction
supports fourteen steel trusses each 60
feet long. Provision is made for gene'
rous lighting, as shown by the windows
displayed in the picture. These are
steel framed. More generous still are
they in the wall of the annexe build'
ing, reaching to 6ft. from floor level.
The exterior of the building, finished
in pastel shading, is enhanced in its
appearance by the generous facings of
Wombeyan marble of variegated russet
toning from P. J. Lowther 6? Son Pty.
Ltd. at their Bowen Bridge Road work'
shops.
Fibrous plaster ceilings throughout
were supplied by Healy Bros., and the
“Durabestos” roofing by Wunderlich
Ltd. Timber and joinery were sup'
plied by Arthur Foote Pty. Ltd.,
Ipswich. A good deal of “blonde”
toned timber is used in the booking
counters. Chromium'plated chairs and
tables are in use in the cafe, helping
to make the ensemble of this motor
coach terminal station a place which,
half a century ago before the advent
of motor cars, would have been a
curiosity.
REBUILDING LONDON.
Building Permits Slightly Relaxed.
It will take many years for even a
tithe of the war'torn City of London
to rise from the ashes of the Blitz
under the hampering influence of
Building Licences, although these have
recently been slightly liberalised to
about £1,000,000 a month, which is
still a drop in the bucket, having re'
gard for the huge rebuilding pro'
gramme that lies ahead.
Nevertheless, a start is being made
on a number of projects, including a
£1,250,000 office block (floor area
211,000 square feet), a sevemstorey
building for the Monotype Corpora'
tion Ltd., and a £500,000 scheme to
rebuild Sergeant's Inn in Fleet Street.
Buildings Under Construction.
The following buildings are among
the principal projects at present under
construction in the City:—
Bank of England; offices for The
Diamond Trading Go. Ltd.; Bank of
London and South America; Barclays
Bank; offices for London Assurance Co.
Ltd.; Lloyd’s building; the “Morning
Advertiser” building; offices for
Stephenson Clarke Ltd.; Offices for
Blue Star Line Ltd.; and the “Daily
Express” building.
The pay roll tax, now reaching near'
ly £50,000,000 a year was imposed
originally to provide a fund for child
endowment.
ARCHED SUSPENSION BRIDGE
The bridge at Pedra Branca, Aracaji,
Brazil, is in keeping with the modern lay-
out of a city of 80,000 Inhabitants. The
bridge design is also modern, with pre-
stressed concrete arches from which the
roadway is suspended, instead of the
familiar towers and catenary cables.
ITALIAN TRAIN SHED.
This unusual concrete train shed in Vincenza, Italy, is built of precast roof slabs and
cast-in-place concrete rigid frames. The 276 ft. x 48ft. roof is supported by the
frames on 23ft. centres. The shed was designed by Professor Luigi Stabilini, Milan.
The two outer rows of roof slabs are cantilevered out to support the centre row of
slabs, and the glazed centre strip has dish-like circular glass lights set in concrete.

Electricity Failures Still A Possibility
STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ELECTRICITY
COMMISSION OF N.S.W., Mr. H. G. CONDE.
An exceptional increase in demand
for electricity has followed the remov-
al of all restrictions on its use last
year.
Over the past twelve months de-
mand has increased by over 13 per
cent, as compared with the normal
rate of 8 per cent, per year.
This increase will mean that the
power stations of the Interconnected
System will be fully taxed to meet
electricity demand this winter. Pro'
vided, however, no major plant fail'
ure is experienced, supply should
match demand but, during the heavy
winter evening peaks, there will be
little or no reserve.
The generating output of the sys-
tern has been increased by 130,000
kWs last winter, when a maximum
generating output of 850,000 kWs
was achieved. Even in the present
fine weather, last year’s figure of
850.000 has already been equalled,
while demand will rise steeply in the
event of rain and in the coming win'
ter months, when it is expected to
reach a figure of approximately
965.000 kWs.
Plant is now coming back into ser'
vice from annual maintenance to meet
the demands of winter.
In addition, the following major
new units should be in service before
the end of the winter—Tallawarra,
30.000 kWs; the third of Pyrmont’s
50.000 kW units, and an additional
25.000 kWs at Balmain.
The commissioning of this plant
is most important as it will provide
the Commission with an essential and
urgently needed reserve. Without
that reserve, supply is still in danger
of interruption at times of peak de'
mand in the event of plant failure or
abnormal demand on the system.
ALUMINIUM TRANSFORMER
WINDINGS.
Westinghouse Electric Corporation
has built a number of oil'insulated pole
type transformers using aluminium
windings. The inert gas'shielded weld'
ing process was used on tappings and
connections. Also recently the Com'
pany has put aluminium into use over
100 dry'type power transformers in
ratings from 225 to 2500 kVA, as
well as others in small ratings, 3 to
15 kVA. The manufacture of these
units involved the use of glass fibre to
insulate the rectangular wire.
The Aluminium Company of Canada
installed a 2200'volt, 2000 kVA aim
minium wound transformer at its
Shipshaw Works, Quebec. It has
found that this transformer will with'
stand a substantial overload without
undue heating compared with other
transformers; efficiency and regulation
proved very satisfactory. Other trans'
formers of 2000 kVA at Peribonka,
Quebec (99,300/13,200'v01t, single
phase), are also in use.

FARM MECHANISATION IN BRITAIN
In the past few years, Britain has
witnessed a remarkable progress in
farm mechanisation, until today she
is using seven times as many tractors
as in 1938, and making 15 times as
many.
Many other items of farm machin-
ery are now listed in the biennial agri-
cultural equipment census, whereas 15
years ago, more than a third were
not in existence or had scarcely been
heard of.
In 1950 the agricultural-engineer-
ing industry produced machinery valu-
ed at nearly £85,000,000, while in
1938 the two industries, working al-
most independently of one another,
produced tractors and farm machines
worth iust over £3,000,000.
This enormous increase has been
brought about by the development of
the mounted implement: the imple-
ment that is mounted on, or closely
coupled to the tractor, instead of just
being pulled along by it.
Experts claim that this develop-
ment has made small-scale farm mech-
anisation practicable, not only in
Britain, but in all parts of the free
world.
BRUSH ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING COMPANY.
Brush Electrical Engineering Com-
pany's major equipment produced dur-
ing the past year include 60 MW
steam turbo generating plant, trans-
formers up to 45 MVA, high and low
tension switchgear, and motors of all
sizes from 1 to 3000 h.p. Diesel and
diesel-electric locomotives are also
manufactured by this company. A
tremendous performance.
GAS SERVICES EXPAND.
Point Lonsdale, Victoria, has now a
high-pressure gas main serving the
residences four miles from the works
at Queenscliff. A further three miles
of reticulation service mains now sup-
plies about 100 of the 240 houses in
the area. About half of the houses
are only occupied as week-end resi-
dences. Electricity is also available
from the S.E.C., Victoria.

MEXICO’S NEW UNIVERSITY
CITY.
Huge Colourful Murals.
The Eighth Pan'American Congress
of Architects was held in Mexico City
in December last.
Professor Walter Gropius, of Har'
vard University, expressed the essem
tial philosophy of the new develop'
ment when he reminded his colleagues
that “man is the most important factor
in architecture. Everything we do
must be made to serve him. And the
way to serve him is to give him room
in which to live and move around
freely.”
One of the most important ways of
achieving this goal, the Congress de'
cided, was to assure large'scale plan'
ning. A building by itself may be
handsome, functional, original, and em
tirely pleasing, but no one spends all
his time in a single building.
Aesthetically, the building must form
a harmonious part of the community
of buildings in which it lives.
Mexico’s nearly'completed Univer'
sity City, site of the Congress, was, to
Mr. Gropius, a good example of
broad'scale planning, for although the
buildings were each designed by dif-
ferent architects, they worked as a
team in arriving at unity without
monotony or repetition.
The situation of each building was
carefully calculated to give spacious'
ness, air and light, uninterrupted vistas
and lengthy strolls, without sacrificing
easy accessibility.
Liberal Use of Colour.

AMERICAN ELECTRICITY
USAGE.
The estimated electricity sales for
U.S.A. in 1954 are stated to be
382,000,000,000 k.Wh., an increase of
12 per cent, over 1953. Of this, 76
per cent, was from fuel generation and
24 per cent, from hydro'power. The
total plant power'capacity of the
United States at December 31, 1953,
was: Fuel stations, 69,095 M.W.: and
hydro stations. 21,800 M.W. For the
first time on record the “UseTactor"
of hydro stations fell below that of
fuel stations as droughts took toll of
water reserves.
QUEENSLAND ELECTRICITY

Queensland Electricity Commission
reports satisfactory progress in the
State. Two “package" 10 MW sets
have been put to work in Brisbane,
and in the far north Cairns is to have
another 5 MW of diesel plant. Cairns

satisfactory results. The estimated cost
of works in hand now tota 1 s
£53,317,000.
NUCLEAR ENERGY.
“Nuclear energy will overtake the
leeway caused by dwindling reserves of
British coal," said Sir John Cockcroft,
Britain's chief atomic scientist. It is
estimated that by 1965 Britain would
be short of 20,000,000 tons of coal.
To compensate for this, nuclear power
must produce 5000 mega watts (MW)
of electricity.
PETROGRAD - LENINGRAD.
On March 14, 1918, the site of
Government in Russia was transferred
from Petrograd to Moscow. By 1939
its population had risen to 4,137,018.
The Palace of the Soviets, which has
been described for the last 15 years
as “now nearing completion" will be
1,365 ft. high, the world's tallest

in height. Leningrad before the war
was St. Petersburg, named after Peter
the Great. Then it became Petrograd.
Then after Lenin’s death is became
Leningrad. It had a population by
1939 of 3,191,304. The iron curtain
could reveal later figures than these,
but they like to keep us guessing.

interested in the problems of
surface treatments on buildings,
new and old.
To-day throughout Australia
thousands of homes, factories,
offices, hospitals, banks and other
institutions have been colour
schemed by Mayfair, with results
that have always reflected credit
on the Contractor concerned.
The services of the Mayfair
Colour Centre are given com-
pletely without charge. Skilled
colour consultants prepare colour
schemes for smaller buildings and
carry out a complete pre-paint-
ing survey for larger projects
where paint and colour arc used
not only to beautify and protect,
but also to improve working
conditions, assist in traffic control,
help prevent accidents, increase
production efficiency and fulfil
numerous other functional tasks.

AUSTRIA’S HYDRO-ELECTRIC
SCHEME.
Austria is developing the hydro-
electric potential of her alps for the
purposes of a “power bank for the
continent” and for export to less
naturally endowed countries. The re-
cent completion of a new chain of
generating stations on the Enns River
is an illustration of this development.
The river is 158 miles long and has
a fall of over 1250 ft. to the Danube;
in under fifty miles.
At present five stations generate up'
wards of 185 MW and another eight
stations are projected which will about
double the potential of the river.

SIMPLE WROUGHT IRONWORK.
The simple concentric curves of this
wrought iron grille at the entrance to a
recent South American Convent group
is very affective with the cross incor-
porated as a central motif.

BRAZILIAN SEAMEN'S HOSPITAL
This magnificent structure—the Brazilian Seamen's Hospital, has been built in Rio
de Janeiro to plans prepared by architect F. F. Saldanha. Availing himself of a 6
declivity in the northern area of Rio, the architect has placed 12 of the 15 storeys
above the plateau on which the main entrance is situated. Built of steel and rein-
forced concrete, the hospital has the most modern surgical clinic, with four operating
theatres, occupying each of the twelve stories. The terrace is on the 13th floor.
The nine floors from the second to the Nth floor are occupied by various wards.
Laboratory and other facilities are on the remaining floors, for easy access.

A STUDY IN PROPORTIONS.
One of the most important aspects of architectural design is proportion and a thorough knowledge
and appreciation of this quality is vital to successful design. The four designs contain interesting
examples of how different proportions in solids and voids to walls and windows—can affect the result-
ant appearance. Windows in top right and bottom left are horizontal in character, that in the front
wing to the latter being so much so that it is almost like a ribbon. In sharp contrast is the large
vertical window to the bottom left, which serves the staircase through two floors. Again the narrow
windows to the dormers to the roof in the upper left give the impression of little eyes peering
forth on to the world.
