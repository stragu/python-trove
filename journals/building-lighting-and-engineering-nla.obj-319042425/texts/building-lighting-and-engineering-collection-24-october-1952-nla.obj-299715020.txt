You may say you’ve taken every precaution
against ordinary fire hazards. That you can
depend upon ‘fireproof’ construction.
Aren’t you over-confident? Human negli-
gence in one way or another continues to
be the greatest cause of fire. So-called ‘fire-
proof buildings continue to become furnaces
for inflammable contents.
What most people ignore is that,, regard-
less of the cause of fire, regardless of the
building construction, it is the proper control
of fire from the first spark that constitutes
full and adequate protection against fire.
Grinnell is on guard 24 hours a day. It
kills fire, automatically, at its source.
You’re paying for Grinnell Protection
even if you haven’t got it. Insurance com-
panies allow a rebate of up to 50% on Fire
and Loss of Profits premiums where buildings
are Grinnell protected.
Wormald Brothers’ long-experienced
engineers will help you plan fire protection
for your specific risk.

has yet used an alu-

for many industrial, commercial and domestic purposes.
The fiat pigment flakes of aluminium paint, when applied, lie in the form of
a continuous coat of metal on the surface of the paint film, thereby giving
protection against corrosive fumes, high humidity and sunlight.

THE CENTENARY OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY
TERMINATION OF COLOURFUL CEREMONIES OVER TWO-YEAR PERIOD.
On October Ist, 1850, His Excel-
lency the Governor of New South
Wales, Sir Charles Fitz Roy, gave his
assent to the Bill to incorporate the
University of Sydney.
This historic fact was commemorated
on October 6th, 1950, in a colourful
ceremony in the Great Hall.
Since then various other celebra-
tions have been held over the period
of approximately two years that inter-
vened between the passing of the Act
and the actual commencement of
classes one hundred years ago.
The final ceremony, which took the
form of the conferring of honorary
degrees upon outstanding Australian
and British leaders, took place last
month.
At the initial ceremony the Chan-
cellor paid tribute to William Charles
Wentworth and his colleagues, who
had been responsible for the concep-
tion and initiation of the University.
He recorded how a select committee
of the Legislative Council of N.S.W.
was formed to report on the institu-
tion of a University on September 6th,
1849. The personnel was as follows:
W. C. Wentworth, E. Deas-Thomson
(Colonial Secretary), J. H. Plunkett
(Attorney-General), C. Cowper, R.
Lowe (later Lord Sherbrooke), C.
Nicholson (Speaker), R. Nichols, J.
Macarthur, and it was as a result of
their work and energy in overcoming
the apathy and, in fact, opposition
that was encountered, that finally the
Act of Incorporation passed the Legis-
lature in the 1850 session and re-
ceived the Vice - Regal assent on,
October Ist, 1850.
Our University now embarks upon
its second century.

THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY.
(see opposite page)
There is no more impressive interior in Aus-
tralia than the Great Hall at the University
of Sydney, which has witnessed many colourful
ceremonies during the past two years while
the University Centenary has been celebrated.
Built to the designs of Edmund Blacket in
1859 it is inspired by Westminster Hall, Lon-
don. Entirely of sandstone it is 135 ft. by
45 ft., the walls being 45ft. high at the
springing of the great oak hammer beam roof
that rises to 70ft. at the apex. This view is
taken looking from the raised platform at the
Western end looking towards the main en-
trance over which is the great organ on either
side of the huge stained glass window.

PENRITH HIGH SCHOOL
LARGE NEW SCHOOL SERVES IMPORTANT DISTRICT.
Penrith is one of the oldest towns
in N.S.W. and it serves an important
district which is playing its part in
the modern policy of decentralisation.
During the war years, together with
St. Marys nearby, it became an im'
portant centre, and with the passing of
large sections of the munitions build'
ings to private peace-time production
it has received added stimulus.
It is appropriate, therefore, that it
should be the site of a fine new high
school that was completed towards the
end of last year.
The site that fronts the Great
Western Highway has an area of 14
acres and the new school, separate
from the old Public School adjacent,
stands on the elevated central area.
560 Pupils.
Accommodation is provided for 560
pupils and includes separate adminis-
trative offices located near the main
entrance.
As is appropriate for this spacious
country site, the planning is open and
the main buildings enclose an assem-
bly quadrangle, and are two storevs in
height for administrative and library
section, classroom unit, and science
wing, with a single'Storeyed structure
for the assembly'hall'gymnasium and
dressing rooms, and the manual train'
ing block.
An arcade gives covered access to
all sections of the school.
Simple Construction
and Materials.
The main buildings are of brick
with pitched roof covered with corru'
gated asbestos cement. Floors in the
lower storey are timber: those of the
upper storey being of reinforced com
Crete covered with parquetry.
The manual training block at the
rear is steel framed, with timber im
filling walls and skillion asbestos
cement roof. A feature of this build'
ing is the windows taking up almost
the whole length of each side wall,
thus permitting maximum light pene'
tration.
Walls and ceilings to the main build'
ings are finished in pastel shades,
woodwork and joinery blending with
the colour scheme in each unit.
Acoustic ceiling strips are provided in
access corridors, classrooms, science
room and hall in order to keep down
the noise level.
The school was designed and super'
vised by the Government Architect of
N.S.W.; Master Builders, Short Bros.

Plasterers’ (State)
Award
On September 3, 1952, Mr. Jus-
tice De Baun of the Industrial Com-
mission adjusted the components of
the Plasterers wage rate to accord with
recent increases in the Basic Wage.
The effect of the judgment is to
increase the rate by 3/9 per week of
40 hours, making it 8/0 21/40d. per
hour, as from the commencement of
the first pay period in August, 1952
(i.e., the date the August Basic Wage
was applied).
A claim by the Operative Plasterers
Union for an automatic formula sim-
ilar to the Carpenters and also an
adjustment for the May-August period
was rejected.
Novel Features in Compact House
CENTRAL UTILITY CORE.
A compact house, recently designed
by Mr. G. W. Brandhorst, Californian
architect, incorporates a number of
novel features. This house is the re-
sult of a request made by the “Ameri-
can Builder” for the design of a model
four-room dwelling of only 1200 sq.
ft. floor area.
The architect has turned to glass
blocks located strategically in various
sections of the house to obtain priv-
acy without sacrificing light, notably
to the bathroom which pays no regard
to outside ventilation which is a re-
quirement of Australian homes. The
house itself is built of light-weight
concrete blocks.
Built around a “family activity”
room that incorporates a built-in kitch-
en, the design revives the old-fashion-
ed parlour or sitting room as an ad-
junct to family gatherings, rather than
the main room into which it has de-
veloped in the more mode_rn home.
Together, the recreation centre and
parlour provided ample space for the
whole family to spread out comfort-
ably. There is also a sizeable porch
opening off the recreation centre.
Central Utility Core.
A central utility core includes a
bathroom, kitchen-fixture-wall, and
heating unit. On one side of this core
is the 12ft. x 15ft. parlour. On the
other side is the “activity room,”
which, including the kitchen, is 30ft.
x 12ft. in which a generous sized
“counter” takes the place of the
kitchen table.
An ingeniously contrived “second
storey” window of Sin. glass block
provides light for the inside combina-
tion bath and utility room through cor-
rugated plastic panels forming the
ceiling. Wood louvres give ample ven-
tilation.
House Appears Larger.
A cleverly arranged fireplace and
barbecue are built into one side of the
masonry wall of the cove with a single
flue serving both units. Abutting mas-
onry supports piers for the roof fram-
ing. Folding doors can be drawn to
close off the living room and child’s
bedroom from the activity room.
Insulux glass block, besides trans-
mitting daylight to the hallway, has
the insulating equivalent of an Sin,
brick wall, thus reducing internal heat
loss.
THE BICYCLE SHED.
Designed at the request of the magazine
American Builder, the compact house of only
1200 sq. ft. possesses a number of novel fea-
tures, built around an old-time kitchen-par-
lour, or “family activity room,” to give it
its modern nomenclature. The description of
the house says that the bathroom is lit by a
skylight window of glass blocks and ventilat-
ed by wood louvres. One doubts if the
Sydney Water Board, which demands a win-
dow with direct access to the outside air
would approve of this. Below is the eleva-
tion with slight variation in location and
projection of windows.
THE WOODWORKING AND COOKERY
CLASS ROOMS.
NOT THE BLACKSMITH’S
FORGE.
At first sight one could hardly
be blamed for thinking the
blacksmith’s forge had strayed
from beneath the spreading
chestnut tree to the centre of
the living room, but it’s just
another new fangled idea. It
has the advantage, certainly.
of enabling people to sit all
around, but it looks as though
most of the heat will go
straight up the flue. Perhaps

County Council Labour Costs
INCREASE 40.43% IN 1951.
Electricity Commission Takes Over Generation.
The appalling affect that continuous
increases in basic wage and other costs
have upon large organisations such as
the Sydney County Council is made
drastically clear by a study of the
annual report for the year 1951.
During 1951 the Basic Wage
rose from ,£B/5/0 to £lO/7/0
and this resulted in an increase
in labour costs of £1,311,254 and
although the staff employed in-
creased by 9.4%, labour costs rose
by 40.43%. Mechanical and electrical
plant maintenance increased from
£840,000 in 1950 to £1,232,000 in
1951 while expenditure on fuel, at
£4,555,722, increased by £952,242, due
to increases in cost of oil fuel, coal
and railway freights.
Generation figures for 1951 exceed-
ed 1950 by 4.1%, yet final costs ad-
vanced by 49.5%. Naturally all this
capacity of 300,000 kW at Lugarno
on Georges River. The project, being
endorsed by the Electricity Authority,
the Council proceeded to prepare
plans and specifications and tenders
were called for the supply of plant.
In December, 19.50, the Electricity
Commission directed the Council to
take no further action.
Power Prospects.
The report in finality says:
“Reviewing the power position in
so far as is concerned the Council at
the end of 1951, the indications are
that the first 50,000 kilowatt unit at
Pyrmont Power Station will be under
steam in March, 1952, and in com'
mercial operation in May. The second
50,000 kilowatt unit at Pyrmont and
the additional 50,000 kilowatt unit
at Bunnerong “B” Power Station
should both be in operation by the
end of 1952.
The installation of these three units
totalling 150,000 kilowatts, will in-
crease the present maximum output
obtainable from the stations by about
50 per cent.
The passing of the function of gen'
eration to the Electricity Commission,
is reflected in the heavy increases in
consumers’ electricity bills.
Electricity Commission Formed.
In May, 1950, the Electricity Com'
mission of N.S.W. was formed, the
principal function of which is to gen-
erate and supply electricity in bulk in
the areas at present supplied by the
Sydney County Council, Department
of Railways, Electric Light and Power
Supply Corporation and the Southern
Electricity Supply. On January 1,
1952, the whole of the assets within
the sites of the Bunnerong and Pyr'
mont Power Stations were transferred
to the Commission. Of the total num-
ber of 6137 employees, 2203 also
transferred.
Lugarno Scheme Abandoned.
In 1948, the Council renewed the
application for approval to build a
new power station with an ultimate

Although the Master Buildersi Fed-

the wages and hours case now before
the Arbitration Court, it was made
clear at the time that Master Builders’
Association could support it inde-
pendently, which would bring the
same result according to their individ-
ual determination to support it.
(The employers’ application, at
present being heard by the Court, is
for a reduction of about <£2/9/0 in
the basic wage and a reversion to a
44-hour week.
Four employers’ groups are direct-
ly associated with the application
They are the Metal Trades Employers’
Association, Motor Traders’ Associa

Commerce.)
The Federal President, Mr. C. R.
Hansen, announced that the Federa-
tion had decided not to participate
further in the basic wage and hours
case until it obtained “some clarifica-
tion of the position.’’
He said that at present master build-
ers are participating in the case
through the Employers’ Federation.
The building group employs about
200,000 workers and is the third 1?
est industrial group with unions affil-
iated with the A.C.T.U.
The move for non-participation in
the court case was put forward k
the Victorian delegation at a meetin -
of the Convention, from which the
Press were excluded.
The resolution also called for the
withdrawal of the representative of the
Victorian Master Builders’ Association
from the steering committee, which is
directing the employers’ case.
The decision means that although
the Federal body will not particip;
in the case, the way is still open for
the various State Associations to con-
tinue to support it.

WELKOM-THE NEW SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN
IS PLANNED IN “NEIGHBOURHOOD UNITS”—WILL SERVE GOLD MINES DEVELOPMENT.
(Condensed from an article in “Optima”, by W. O. Backhouse, M.A., Soc. P. 0., M.T.P.1.)
The town of Welkom, in the new
Orange Free State goldfields, has been
designed to incorporate, as far as pos-
sible, the best features of modern
town-planning practice. Mr. Back-
house, who is Town and Regional
Planning Consultant to Anglo Amer-
ican Corp. of South Africa, describes
the plan for the new town; he tells
how principles of town-planning have
been adapted to provide attractive ac-
commodation and amenities for em-
ployees of the six gold mines and an-
cillary industries served by Welkom.
Special interest attaches to the
planning of Welkom because limita-
tions of space did not cramp the in-
spiration and vision of those respon-
sible for its creation.
Features include planning in
“neighbourhood units,” in which
schools, shops, community centres, etc.,
can be reached without crossing main
traffic arteries; provision of green
wedges, or tree-planted and garden
tracts, leading from the built-up areas
to the open country; planning of the
commercial area with adequate park-
ing lanes, and many other modern
ideas that will add to the convenience
and pleasantness of the new town.
Planned Development.
Welkom is an exception to the gen-
eral rule of older towns in mining
areas, writes Mr. Backhouse. So of-
ten in the past, when success has at-
tended prospecting operations in p
new field, the inevitable prospectors’
camps have developed haphazardly in
mining camps; and out of those camps
has grown a town in which buildings
were erected to meet immediate needs
and without regard to any organised
or controlled plan of layout.
This happened in Johannesburg,
and it happened in many oversea
towns and cities. But it will not hap-
pen at Welkom, which has been de-
signed, from the beginning, as the
residential, commercial and industrial
centre of the new goldfields in the
Orange Free State.
When prospecting operations in the
Free State had proved the existence of
a potentially rich goldfield, capable of
supporting a number of large gold
mines, serious thought had to be given
to the problem of accommodating the
big population that would be attract-
ed to the area. Preparations began for
the establishment of 13 gold mines (of
which two are already in production):
and, in the absence of some plan, it
seemed probable that accommodation
for the mine employees would straggle
in a series of units stretching over the
30 nfiles, or so, covered by the line
of mines. With the possibility that
other mines would be established later
in the vicinity of the proved area, there
seemed every chance that the strag'
gling units of accommodation would
coalesce into one or two big, sprawl'
ing, unco'ordinated cities. Action was
therefore taken to prevent this unde-
sirable development.
In consultation with other public
authorities and, of course, the mining
companies concerned in the area, a
general scheme was drawn up for the
whole region. It was decided that
several average-sized towns should be
established, each separated from the
next by rural areas. The European
population of each town was set at a
maximum of 50,000.
Four Towns.
To serve the existing 13 mines in
the Free State, four towns are being
developed. In the north, Allanridge
is being laid out to provide accom-
modation for employees of two mines.
A few miles to the south is Oden-
daalsrus, which already existed as a
small village when the goldfields were
discovered. Twentyffive miles south
of Odendaalsrus is a group of three
mines to serve which a township. New
Virginia, is being developed.
In the geographical centre of the
mining area is a group of six mines
in a compact block and to serve the
six mines, Welkom is now being laid
out.
Since these mines provided the sole
reason for the establishment of the
town, the plan had to recognise the
needs of each. It had, for instance,
to exclude the areas needed for shaft'
sinking for mine buildings and for the
accommodation of slime dams; to sim'
plify the latter requirement, the mines
were so designed that the reduction
works and associated slime dams were
to be adjacent to the shafts sited
farthest from the proposed town.
Separate Areas.
Another limitation, not encountered
in many oversea towns, was the need
to provide separate areas for the ac'
commodation of Europeans and non
Europeans—a provision made as much
in the interests of the Native popula-
tion as in recognition of the establish-
ed practice in South Africa.
After solving many problems a
town-planning committee was estab-
lished to create Welkom —a particu-
larly happy choice of name (meaning,
in English, “Welcome”) which was
derived from one of the farms on
which the township is being laid out.
The committee’s instructions from Sir
Ernest Oppenheimer, chairman of An'
glo American Corporation of South
Africa, Limited were that they should
design a town in accordance with the
most modern principles of town-
planning as determined by practice
and experience in the world at larg.
It was to be more than a minim-
township: it was to combine the
aesthetic qualities of a garden city
with the utilitarian requirements of or
dinary commerce and industry.
The first step, then, was to analyse
the faults and the good points of exist'
ing towns, not only in South Africa,
but throughout Europe and the Amer'
icas. The analysis showed clearly some
of the chief defects of haphazard de'
velopment.
Many Faults.
One of the most important faults
was congestion at the town centre.
This was caused largely by too much
building on too little land; the in'
termingling of shops, offices, flats, ho'
tels, cinemas and industries; and. as
a result, unnecessary cross travel. Ag'
gravating this position was the use of
a rectangular street pattern, in which
all streets were through'streets, which
mixed the local and other types of
traffic passing through the town
centre.
Buildings were often too high, and
there was no relation between the floor
space and the amount of vehicular
traffic incidental to the buildings.
Congestion was increased still further
by the loading and off'loading of goods
to the shops and warehouses from the
fronting streets, the goods bein carried
across the footpaths.
There was a lack of wide roads con'
necting the town centre to the sub'
urbs; and in the suburbs themselves
the schools and parks were badly lo'
cated in relation to the population,
which meant that pedestrians—and
particularly school children were
forced to walk through streets that
carried a considerable amount of traf'
fic.
These faults affected not only the
safety and pleasure of the inhabitants
but also the economics of the towns.
(An enormous wastage of time and
money is caused by the lack of fore-
sight in the design of towns. An esti'
mate showed that, in wastage of time
alone, every minute’s delay on a road
carrying 6,000 vehicles per day cost
£7,500.)

Welkom was, therefore, planned to
avoid as many as possible of these
disadvantages of town development.
The basic plan was a design dividing
the area of the proposed township
(comprising about 9,300 acres) into
zones, each reserved for a specific type
of development.
Calculations based on experience on
the Witwatersrand indicated that
Welkom would have to house a mini-
mum population approaching 40,000
Europeans and nearly an equal num-
ber of non-Europeans, in addition to
the non-Europeans living in hostels
on the various mines.
Welkom was sited so that two mines
lay to the north of it, two to the
south, and one each to the east and
west. To house the European mine
employees as close as possible to the
mines on which they would be em-
ployed, it was, therefore, clearly de-
sirable to provide adjacent suburbs
(known as “neighbourhood units”).
The centre of the township was the
obvious place in which to provide fa-
cilities or shopping, recreation, public
administration and general commer-
cial, professional and office activity—
each suitably zoned. Industrial activ-
ity was confined in the plan to an
area east of the township, so that the
prevailing wind would carry ’smoke
and fumes away from the town. Ac-
commodation for the non-European
population was provided in a separ-
ate township, named “Thabong”
(meaning “Place of Joy”); this town-
ship was sited to the north-east, but
still within the municipal area of
Welkom.
The Master Plan.
The highway pattern is designed to
encourage traffic to converge quickly
to the fast traffic roads; the green
wedge park system radiating from the
town centre, is designed to enable
school children to walk to school, and
other pedestrians to walk to the town
centre, largely through safe and pleas-
ant parks.
There are two main arterial roads;
one runs north-south and abuts on,
but does not cut, the town centre;
the other runs east-west and passes
through the centre of the town. Each
of these roads is 140 feet wide, which
includes two 30-ft. carriage ways (sep-
arated by a 26ft. centre strip), cycle
tracks, footpaths and verges. Where
these inter-town roads have frontage
development, they are protected by
service roads, making the total width
220 feet.
Internal arterial roads —140 feet
wide —connect the town centre with
the suburbs, the various mines and
the industrial township. They are
planned to link with other roads on
the perimeter of each neighbourhood
unit to form a complete ring of roads,
140 feet wide, around each suburb.
In no part of the highway system will
pedestrians have to cross more than
30 feet of paved carriageway without
coming to a large safe refuge.
Civic Centre. —The central area of
the town comprises a spacious civic
centre, which occupies the northern
half of the area, and a shopping area,
occupying the southern half.. Be-
tween the two runs the main east-west
boulevard, known as “State Way”.
The civic centre takes the form of
a horseshoe, with an park in
the centre. In this park will stand
the town hall, library and museum:
it will also contain fountains, lawns.
trees and flowerbeds.
The park is surrounded by a road
100 feet wide. On the other side of
the road will be built government,
local government, administrative and
technical offices, banks, private offices
and law courts.
On the outer sides of the office
blocks is another road 140 feet wide.
The blocks are designed with internal
courtyards in which vehicles incident-
al to the buildings may be parked. Fu-
ture traffic requirements have been
calculated on the basis of one motor
vehicle to every 2.5 Europeans; on
that basis there should be no traffic
congestion in the civic centre.

THE NEW SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN OF WELKOM.
These perspectives, prepared by the Architectural Department of Anglo American Corporation
ot south Africa, Limited, give an impression of the future appearance of the town centre at
Welkom, in the Orange Free State, when construction is complete. Above is the northern
aspect, showing the Civic Centre; the southern aspect, illustrating the shopping centre is
shown below. These drawings illustrate only the general aim of the plan and actual construction
may be varied considerably in detail.

BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING
October 24, 1952.


Shopping Centre.—The shopping
centre forms the southern half of the
town centre. Like the civic centre,
it is horseshoe'shaped and contains a
large park (of 11 acres). Across the
north side of the park runs State Way.
Skirting the rest of the park area is
a road 140 feet wide; on the outer
rim of this road are being built shops
of harmonising design.
Instead of encountering the usual
town pattern of numerous intersecting
streets, shoppers will be presented with
a broad, unbroken sweep of shops.
As a short cut from one side of the
curve to the other, the shopper will be
able to walk across the central park.
Continuous canopies will protect ped'
estrians from rain and sun; and as the
road will be used by traffic connected
only with shopping, there will be
ample space for parking cars.
Loading access lanes, 50 feet wide,
at the back of the shops will elimin-
ate the need for loading and off'load'
ing goods at the public entrance to
the shops.
Theatres and Hotels. —Special areas
have been planned for theatres and
hotels, the sites for which are at least
two acres each. Large sites were pro-
vided in the plan so that the building
ings could be set back to a 50ft. build'
ing line; this will leave space for
parking vehicles and for tree-planting.
Neighbourhood Units.—ln laying out
the neighbourhood units, particular at'
tentionh as been given to the orienta'
tion of the houses. In South Africa,
a northern aspect is desirable, of
course, so that the sun may shine into
the main rooms during the winter; in
the summer the sun is almost directly
overhead. Most of the streets in the
residential areas, therefore, are planned
to run east'west to give the houses a
north'facing aspect. The street pattern
is pleasantly broken up by the radial
green wedges, running from the town
centre through the suburbs.
Within the suburbs the streets will
be 60 feet wide, and they are planned
to induce traffic to leave the suburbs
as soon as possible and travel on the
outer roads. To achieve this object,
the north'south connecting streets are
staggered, a design that contributes to
the appearance of the areas. p
The green wedges will lead to con-
veniently'sited nursery and primary
schools and to the town centre. Part'
ly to assist the older children to learn
to use the roads, the high schools are
located away from the park systems;
they are near minor internal arterial
roads, which are provided with cycle
tracks.
The high schools will stand in
Sprounds of 21 acres; the primary
schools in 10 acres; and the nursery
schools in one acre. Nursery and pri'
mary schools will be provided in the
ratio of one to every 400 to 500 farm
dies, and high schools in the ratio of
one to every 1,400 families.
Apart from providing safe and pleas'
ant routes for pedestrians, the green
wedges will be suitable places in which
to establish children s play parks, tennis
courts, bowling greens and other
sporting facilities within easy reach of
the houses. For national sports, a
central sports field of about 55 acres
—intended to be developed as a stad'
ium ground—is being provided to the
west of the civic centre. The pitches
will be laid with their long axes 15
degrees east of north, to provide the
most desirable conditions for the play'
ers.
Other sporting facilities include golf
courses, one of which has already
been laid out just outside the town
boundary; and three large stretches
of water will be used for boating and
various water sports.
Hospitals.—Thirty'six acres of land
have been set aside for the Provincial
European hospital, south'west of the
shopping centre.
A hospital for nomEuropean mine
employees is being erected on a 50-
acre site in the northeastern portion
of the town. This magnificent build'
ing—which will cost about £750,000
by the time it is complete—incorpor'
ates the latest ideas and equipment
from Europe and America. Within the
Native township, an area of 26 acres
is being set aside for a hospital to
cater for non'Europeans who are not
employed on the mines.
Industrial Area. —Surrounded by
green belts, to screen it from all resh
dential areas, will be the industrial
area to the east of the town. Con'
siderable activity is taking place in
this area, where several factories are
already established. The area, which
covers about 530 acres, is zoned for
different categories of industry; in
particular, wet and dry industries are
separated Jo permit of an economic
drainage system; and these industries
are subdivided into food and other
industries. No noxious industries will
be permitted within that industrial
area; provision will be made for them
adjacent to the town.
Roads and railways in the industrial
area are arranged to avoid level cross'
ings. This is achieved by laying out
the roads in the area as culs'de'sac
running from the outside roads to'
wards the centre; and the railway re'
serves are designed to run from the
centre outwards between the cul'de'
sac roads.
Native Township. Thabong is
planned to accommodate the non'
European domestic, business and in'
dustrial workers employed in the
town. It will be a selLcontained town
—though within the Welkom muni'
cipal area —designed to accommodate
a population of between 30,000 and
40,000 on residential plots, the mini'
mum size of which is 40 feet by 70
feet. Most of the houses will be de'
tached single'Storey houses, giving a
density far lower than the normal den'
sity of housing in Europe and Amen
ica.
The township comprises five neigh'
bourhood units, each containing a
central strip park. Adjoining these
parks will be schools, clinics, shops
and churches.
A large central sports area is plan'
ned, to the south of which will be
administrative and shopping centres,
market and theatres ites and a com'
munity hall. Provision is being made
for local light industries to be run
by non'Europeans, and industrial sites
have been planned in the township
for that purpose.
Growth Of The Town.
Rapid progress is being made in
putting the plan for Welkom into
practice. Little more than five years
ago, the Welkom area contained only
a few farmhouses and a mere hand'
ful of inhabitants. The surrounding
ground was bleak, bare veld.
By the end of last year the popula
tion had reached nearly 9,000 Euro-
peans and about 10,000 non'Europeans.
The rise in population was anticipat'
ed, of course, by concentrating on the
building of houses during the first few
years of construction. At the end of
1951 nearly 2,000 houses had been
completed and more than 100 were
under construction; more than 110
miles of roads had been formed and
graded; and one'sixth of the shopping
centre had been built or was under
construction. In the Native town-
ship, “Thabong”, 600 houses for
married Natives and 50 houses for
single Natives had been completed.
It is expected that, during the cur'
rent year, Welkom will become the
second largest town in the Orange
Free State.

IDEAL AUSTRALIAN HOME
GRACE BROS.’ FULL-SIZE HOUSE.
Grace Bros., with typical enterprise,
recently exhibited a . full-size home
within their store in Broadway,
Sydney.
The house, described as the ideal
Australian home, was officially opened
by the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of
Sydney, Alderman E. C. O’Dea,
M.L.C., in the presence of a large
gathering.
Supplied by George Hudson Pty.
Ltd. —the pioneers of “Ready-Cut”
homes in Australia, with the advant-
age of nearly 100 years’ experience
—the house was a substantial building
of exceptional quality throughout.
The design—one of many—the
“Roseville”, is spacious, airy, and of
ample size for a family.
Its standard specifications are; 4 x
2 oregon stud framing, ceiling joists
and rafters. 4” rusticated weather-
boards. Fibrous plaster lined and
ceiled internally. Tile pattern wall-
board to bathroom and shower recess,
asbestos cement to laundry, and
kitchen dado. Locally manufactured
semi-glazed terracotta tiles.
The specification includes all doors,
windows, skirtings, architraves, etc.,
and also includes all pier caps, door
and window flashing, valley iron, nails,
etc., and paint materials.
The house exhibited was complete-
ly furnished by Grace Bros, to present
a modern interior of charm and com-
fort, with New-Trend furniture and
excellent window treatments.
Welcoming the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress, Mr. A. E. Grace ex-
pressed the thanks of Grace Bros, for
the honour paid to his organisation
by the Mayoral party.
He also commended the effort of
George Hudson Pty. Ltd. in erecting
the home in five weeks in the show'
room, and said he felt sure that such
a home would attract wide attention.
“It is the only fully'fitted home of
its kind on show in Australia today,”
Mr. Grace added.
The Managing Director of George
Hudson Pty. Ltd., Mr. C. H. Hands,
in paying a tribute to Grace Bros.’
enterprise, said that his organisation
greatly appreciated the encouragement
given in presenting the ideal home to
the public.
He explained the difference be-
tween prefabricated houses and ready-
cut homes, and emphasised the infi'
nitely superior quality of materials used
in production of locally'made houses.
He deplored the fact that over
10,000 prefab, houses had been im-
ported by Commonwealth and State
Governments at a cost of between
£l5 to £2O million.
“Many which have arrived cannot
be assembled because the Govern'
ments lack money, and cannot be dis-
posed of,” Mr. Hands said.
“It is tragic that the building trade
has not been kept at full pressure,
and it would be a great help if the
young people received the same £3OO
subsidy as were provided by Govern-
ments for each prefab, house.
“That same subsidy would greatly
boost production of Australian-built
homes,” he added.
Following the presentation of a
bouquet of flowers to the Lady
Mayoress by Mrs. A. E. Grace, the
Lord Mayor, Aid. O’Dea said “he was
happy to be asked to open the house,
a model home in every way.”
He said there could be
more acceptable to a community than
comfortable homes, and he com'
mended George Hudson Pty. Ltd. for
having pionereed homes for the
people, and for having made it pos-
sible for young people to possess then
own houses for a reasonable outlay.
The Discoloration of
Window Glass
Storage Precautions To Be Taken.
From time to time complaints are
received at the Building Research
Station in Britain of the discoloration
of window glass. The defect is not
normally visible from the inside of the
house, but is apparent when looking
at the glass at an angle from the out'
side. The windows of a large number
of houses on several estates have been
found to be affected.
It is now recognised that the defect
is due to conditions to which the glass
has been exposed before being fixed
in the frames. When crates of glass
are exposed to rain, during eithei
transport or storage, a thin film of
moisture may become entrapped be'
tween adjacent sheets. This film of
water cannot dry easily. The moisture
leaches some of the soda from the
glass and the alkaline solution con'
tinues to attack the glass. It is this
action that causes the discoloration.
Once a pane of glass has become
affected in this way it would be quite
uneconomic to treat it in order to re'
move the discoloration. The action
cannot happen under normal condi'
tions of use provided the composition
of the glass conforms to that laid
down in British Standard 952 (Amend'
ment P.D. 320, 1944).
The transportation and storage of
glass is thus an important matter.
When glass is being moved from place
to place it should be adequately
covered by tarpaulins to prevent any
rain falling on the crates, and the
crates should be stored in dry build'
ings. Since the action can take place
fairly rapidly, i.e., within a period of
weeks, any glass received in a damp
condition should be removed from its
crate and the sheets should be sepa'
rated and allowed to dry.
Lutyens’ Drawings
80,000 Examined.
Mr. Robert Lutyens, son of the late
Sir Edwin Lutyens, recently gave the
R.1.8.A. some 80,000 drawings left
bv his father. Many original sketches
—plans and perspectives—have come
to light and the most valuable will be
preserved by the R.1.8.A. Library.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING
October 24, 1952.


£1,000,000 Factory Project at Rydalmere
CONSTRUCTION AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.
Unusual Features of Work and Layout.
“Building; Lighting: Engineering”
recently visited the new £1 million
factory for Rheem Australia Pty. Ltd.,
now being built at Rydalmere, and its
representative was greatly impressed
by the progress made to date.
The project includes a factory
block, an office block, an amenities
block, a canteen, and a first aid block.
Specifications call for a factory
building which will cover an area ap-
proximately 600 ft. by 500 ft., con-
structed in bays each 30 ft. long.
Columns and roof trusses will be of
steel and the saw tooth type roof cov-
ered with galvanised iron. A concrete
floor will be laid over the entire cov-
ered area of the factory.
The office block has been planned
as a “T” shaped double-storeyed struc-
ture, 160 ft. by 40 ft. one way, and
54 ft. by 40 ft. for the other wing.
The building will be steel framed,
faced with brick and roofed with terra
cotta tiles.
The first aid block will be 38 ft.
by 43 ft. and is being constructed of
brick, with an imported laminated
bow truss roof, covered with specially-
curved corrugated asbestos sheeting.
The amenities block measures 106
ft. by 38 ft. and the canteen 105 ft.
by 64 ft. This block will also have
an imported laminated bow truss roof,
finished with special curved sheeting.
Nearly a quarter million bricks will
be required in the factory and admin-
istrative blocks, whilst 6000 cubic yards
of concrete will be poured in floors
and columns, and approximately 100
tons of steel reinforcing will be re-
quired.
Messrs. Hutcherson Bros. Pty. Ltd.,
Master Builders, have contracted to
complete the buildings in 18 months.
To ensure that the schedule is main-
tained, the company is using an im-
pressive array of mechanical equip-
ment.
Mechanisation Plan.
In the mechanisation plan, Tutt
Bryant was early on the job, with a
Barber-Greene 44C Ditcher digging
the trenches for footings.
This diesel-powered machine dug
the required trenches well ahead of
schedule.
To greatly speed-up pouring the
vast area of concrete floors, and dump-
ing into forms, the builders are using
Whiteman Power Buggies, which are
exceedingly versatile machines.
With a speed range of from 2 to
16 miles .per hour forward and re-
verse, and the ability to travel up or
down ramps of up to 25 degree grad-
ient, the Buggies will carry a 200 lb.
or 13 cubic ft. load of anything that
can be dumped, piled, or shovelled
into its bucket.
Our representative watched these
agile three-wheelers shuttling busily
from mixer to dumping area, making
non-stop trips up ramps, across rough
ground, between columns and scaffold-
ing, with clockwork regularity.
In fact, the whole factory floor area
was put down in concrete before ac-
tual construction started.
Widely used overseas on multi-stor-
ied structures, Whiteman Power Bug-
gies travel up ramps from floor to
floor. Hutcherson Bros, are among
the first to adopt this time and money-
saving method in Australia.
Also extensively used on the job is
the Ramset fastening system, which
shoots nails into concrete or iron with
an explosive charge. This short-cuts
all need for drilling or plugging, and
permits a variety of fastenings., such
as steel to concrete, wood to concrete,
wood to steel, steel to steel, steel to
brick, and fabricated hard materials to
steel.
Another interesting piece of equip-
ment is a Concrete Surfacer, which is
a mechanical steel trowler, which elim-
inates hand trowling, and greatly
speeds up the work of surfacing.
The whole Rheem project is con-
sidered to be the most highly mech-
anised building construction job in
Australia at the present time.
Interesting Features.
Explaining details of the huge pro-
ject, the Clerk of Works, Mr. C. J.
Hanna, gave much interesting infor-
mation.
Mr. Hanna said that the buildings
have been planned in such a manner
that from the moment of enteric
the gates, everyone will be under
shelter. They will be under awnings
to every part of the factory, and will
be fully protected from the weather.
The factory is ideally situated. It is
adjacent to Rydalmere Station; there
will be a Park opposite the propertv.
with a river nearby and a creek at the
boundary. There will be a spacious
car park for vehicles, and a rail siding
will be included in the finished project.
The steel for the factory was fabri-
cated by Atkinsons Ltd., England, and
is being erected by Reynolds Ltd.
Mr. Hanna said the factory floor
was poured before the steel was erect-
ed “because it is quicker to erect
steel off concrete.”
Mechanical loaders are also being
used on the job to load sand and
metal into the concrete mixers, thus
giving considerably greater output of
concrete per day.
Bow Truss Laminated Arches.
The amenities and canteen blocks
are unique, inasmuch as they will have

M.B.A. & BUILDERS' EXCHANGE ANNUAL DINNER
MARKS IMPORTANT HISTORIC OCCASION
Plaques of Honor Awarded; 79th Anniversary of Founding Celebrated
The Joint Annual Dinner of the Master Builders’ Association of N.S.W. and The
Builders’ Exchange of N.S.W., held last Friday night at the Wentworth Hotel, was
—apart from being an outstanding social success, an historic occasion of great import-
ance. The large and enthusiastic assemblage of 175 official guests, Master Builders
and Building Exchange members witnessed the presentation, for the first time, of
the Florence M. Taylor Award for distinguished services to the building industry.
This Award of Honour, a metal
plaque symbolising Building in all its
phases, is to be awarded annually to
the person whom the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W. adjudge to have
rendered the most outstanding service
to the building industry in N.S.W.
during the year.
The Executive Committee of the
Master Builders’ Association this year
unanimously decided to make its first
Awards to Mrs. Florence M. Taylor,
0.8. E., A.R.A.1.A., A.R.1.8.A., AM.

Master Builder who has been long as-
sociated with the progress and growth
of the building industry.
Official Guests.
The President of the Master Build'
ers’ Association of N.S.W., Mr.
Charles E. Thompson, F.A.1.8., pre'
sided at the Dinner, and seated at the
Official Table were the guests of
honour, Mrs. Florence M. Taylor,
O. and Mr. C. F. Gage, F.A.1.8..

Hon. Secretary, Master Builders' Fed-
eration of Australia, Mr. T. j. Cav'
anagh.
The Master Builders' Association
Acting'Secretary, Mr. W. D. Ford,
was Master of Ceremonies.
Toasts and Speeches.
“The Queen”.
Following the Loyal Toast, propos'
ed by the Chairman, Mr. Charles E.
Thompson, and responded to with
musical honours, the Toast List was
commenced.
“Parliament”.
In proposing the Toast to Parlia'
ment, the M.B.A. Senior Vice'Presi'
dent, Mr. Percy Bottomley, welcomed
the two Parliamentary representatives
present in the persons of the Hon.
Clive Evatt, N.S.W. Minister for
Housing, and the Leader of the State
Opposition, the Hon. Vernon Treatt.
Mr. Bottomley said that Parliament,
or the system of government went
away back into history.
“Parliament is probably more lethal
in carrying out its ruling, but effective
and sufficient so long as one is on the
right side.”
Individuality seemed to be suppress'
ed by the party system, Mr. Bottom'
ley said, and referred to the proposed
Stamp Duties and the hunt for new
money.
“It is becoming harder and harder
to support Parliament in the style to
which it has become accustomed.
“We are told that if they don’t
living they do when we are
dead,” the speaker added.
Touching on the proposed registra'
tion of builders, the speaker said he
was pleased that the matter had been
again resurrected.
“Such registration can be good or
bad, Mr. Bottomley warned.
“We are in hopes that the process
of being again brought to light will
evolve something good for the com'
munity and the builder.
“Parliament will have to do its
part, now that Public Works and
Housing have been cut down.
“We are hopeful that the whole of
Parliament will be behind any em
deavour to keep these vitally import'
ant works alive, and to evolve a meth'
od to get us out of the chaos.
“These works have cost us millions
of pounds,” Mr. Bottomley added.
He said that there was very little
public works going on, and the Quay
Railway station job had also stopped.
“Parliament has the opportunity of
doing its best for all the community.
“As it has started works, surely it
can finish them.
“We as a nation have become
reconciled to matters of various assist'
ance that have come from the Gov'
ernment. The Government tries to
give something which must be event'
ually paid for by someone.”
Mr. Bottomley quoted the well'
known U.S. Labour leader, Mr. Sam
Gompers, who said:
“What the Government gives it can
take away, and when they start taking
they can take away more than they
give.
“The recipient in the first case,
however, is not always the one who
has given in the second case.”
The speaker gave an outline of im'
pressions gathered during his recent
tour of the U.K., and referred in
glowing terms to the courage and op-
timism of the British during the war,
and since, in their battle of recovery.
Mr. Bottomley concluded by ex'
pressing his confidence in Australia’s
future prospects for progress and ex'
pansion.
Replying to the Toast, the Hon.
Clive Evatt, Q.C., M.L.A., started off
in happy vein by saying that the only
man who went to Parliament with
good intentions was Guy Fawkes.
Mr. Evatt recalled that after the
last State elections two distinguished
visitors called on him.
“One was a Master Builder, and
the other was also a very wealthy
man,” he said, amid laughter.
“I would like to say that Parlia'
ment is only a reflection of the com'
munity,” Mr. Evatt went on.
“It is a cross'section of men and
women who live in this land, and after
it is not such a bad place to live
in.” (Applause.)
There is another thing Parliament'
29
BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING
October 24, 195"


arians never forget—that if the people
don’t like them they can throw them
out every three years”!
The keystone of democracy, Mr.
Evatt said, was being able to criticise
Parliament, yet being prepared to de-
fend it to the death.
He referred to the four great free-
doms contained in the Atlantic Char-
ter, subscribed to by two of the world’s
greatest Governments Freedom to
Worship, Freedom from Want, Free-
dom from Fear, and Freedom of
Speech. These tenets came from the
greatest Book of all time, Mr. Evatt
said.
“We must always work to retain
these great Freedoms,” he added.
“Might I digress and say a few
words appropriate to tonight?” Mr.
Evatt asked.
“We have here with us so dis-
tinguished an Australian as Florence
Taylor, architect, engineer, editor and
publisher, who has contributed in a
spectacular fashion to the advance-
ment of this nation.”
“Honour is being paid tonight to
two very great Australians, for we also
have with us Mr. Cobden Parkes, son
of Sir Henry Parkes.”
Continuing, Mr. Evatt said:
“May I express our gratitude to the
building industry on its performance
and wonderful achievement, which has
resulted in the erection of 120,000
permanent homes in N.S.W. since
World War 11.
“That took some building, and we
have as a result happily housed Aus-
tralian citizens of all ages.
“ Next Saturday in Fairfield,
the Rural Bank is handing over the
key to the new occupant of the
120,000 house to be built by the State.
“Your work and our work is really
something far transcending politics.”
Mr. Evatt said that there were such
tremendous social implications involv-
ed that once the housing problems
were solved, all other vital problems
would solve themselves.
“Surely we cannot afford to fail
our people regarding housing,” the
speaker continued.
“Money must be found at the earl-
iest possible moment, and made avail-
able to the building industry.
“I don’t care what ideology anyone
subscribes to.
“It is a disgrace to the State that
8000 families are seeking Housing
Commission homes.
“There are 40,000 houses in
Sydney, occupied by Australians that
have been condemned for human hab-
itation.
“They should be pulled down and
the people given proper homes to live
in.
“Slums in Sydney are the breeding
grounds of disease, child delinquency,
and breed social misfits,” Mr. Evatt
declared.
He said State home-building had
never been actuated by profit-making
motives, but to render to society a
permanent service.
Mr. Evatt said he took tremendous
pride in going out to the State hous-
ing projects and watching the lights
go on in the new homes sheltering
happy families.
“I don’t care if new houses are
built by the Housing Commission, the
Rural Bank, or by public enterprise,
as long as they house contented people.
“They represent milestones to an-
other community,” he added.
Mr. Evatt quoted Daniel Webster,
who in 1831 said of Alexander Ham-
ilton:
“He smote the rock of national re-
sources, and abundant streams of rev-
enue gushed out. He touched the
dead corpse of public credit, and it
sprang to its feet.”
“We want an Alexander Hamilton
in Australia today, and we want him
in the Federal Parliament.
“The time is now to start to fight;
to fight for something for Australia,
and something above all for our dem'
ocratic way of life,” Mr. Evatt con'
eluded.
Responding to the Toast of Par'
liament, the Leader of the State Oppo-
sition, the Hon. Vernon Treatt, Q.C.,
M.L.A., spoke of the pleasure it gave
him to be present on such an aus'
picious occasion.
Mr. Treatt recalled the previous
function at which Mrs. Taylor was
present, the inaugural dinner of the
Australian Institute of Builders two
years ago.
VShe is indeed a particularly gra-
cious representative of Australian
women,” he said.
“In regard to Parliament,” Mr.
Treatt continued, “it varied in differ*
ent parts of the world. Australian
Parliaments were exceptionally fine in-
stitutions,” he added.
Mr. Treatt commented that the
Leader of the Opposition not only
talks but has been able to trenchantly
criticise the Government.
“None have yet been executed for
so doing,” he said, amid laughter.
“The Toast of Parliament clearly
expressed the foundation of liberty,
the Magna Carta, and democracy, can
only exist and persist if the people
are vigilant.
“It is a possibility that through in*
advertance the will of the people may
not be represented on Parliament, and
this could happen in N.S.W.”, Mr.
Treatt pointed out.
“All pleasant references to Parlia-
ment may disappear if the will of the
people didn’t prevail.”
Mr. Treatt said that every true
democrat desired to see Australia pro-
gress.
He congratulated the builders on
the fine job they had done in the past,
and added that he realised to the full'
est the need for the co-operation of
people whose names were on the lists
of every aspiring politician.
“Like you, we want one thing: for
everybody to say: ‘yes, he was a great
builder’.”
Presentation of Plaques.
The President of the Master Build-
ers’ Association, C. E. Thompson, at
this juncture announced the presenta-
tion of the Florence M. Taylor Awards
for distinguished services to the build-
ing industry.
Mr. Thompson expressed the thanks
of the Master Builders’ Association to
Mrs. Taylor for making the Award
available annually.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


He said it would encourage every
builder to make endeavours in the
building industry which would be suit'
ably recognised.
Mr. Thompson traced the history
of the Award since Mrs. Taylor placed
a sum of money at the disposal of the
Master Builders’ Association, and it
was decided to make an annual Award
in the form of a handsome inscribed
bronze plaque.
On this occasion, the presentation
of the Award for 1952'53, it had been
agreed that Mrs. Taylor’s meritorious
and generous services to the building
industry should be suitably recognis'
ed by making her the recipient of the
first Award, coupled with a similar
award to Mr. Charles F. Gage, presi-
dent of the Australian Institute ol
Builders.
In enumerating the outstanding
achievements of Mrs. Florence M.
Taylor, Mr. Thompson said he desir-
ed to point out some of the highlights
of her long and useful career.
“Mrs. Florence Mary Taylor,
0.8. E., A.R.A.1.A., A.R.1.8.A., A.M.
Inst.S.E., London, was born in Eng-
land
“She was the first woman architect
and structural engineer in Australia,
and has followed her professions since
1899.
“Mrs. Taylor is editor of “Building:
Lighting: Engineering,” “The Austra-
lasian Engineer,” and “Construction”.
She has consistently followed the arts,
music, painting and literature. She is
President of the Women’s Section,
Australian-American Association, and
is a member of various cultural bodies
and now life member, Town Planning
Association.
“Her husband, the late Mr. G. A.
Taylor, was founder of the Aerial
League, the first Aeronautical organis-
ation in Australia.
“He was the first man in Australia
to make a flight in a heavier than air
engineless machine in 1909, and Mrs.
Taylor was the first woman in Austra-
lia to go aloft (at Narrabeen).
“It was a tiny, modest flight, the
glider was tethered, but a flight it
was,” Mr. Thompson said.
“Her attainments as a Town Planner
and architect are most unique, and in
the whole world there is no other
woman who has attained to life mem-
bership of 24 educational, constructive,
artistic and other associations, nor
does any other woman throughout the
world edit Architects’ and Builders’
magazines of such fine calibre as
“Building: Lighting: Engineering,” the
official organ of the Master Builders’
Federation of Australia, the monthlv
“The Australasian Engineer”, and
Construction,” a weekly publication,
all of which are accredited journals
representing scientific and learned so-
cieties in Australia.
“Mrs. Taylor edited and produced
many pamphlets on Town Planning
which are a memorable record of her
ability and foresight, and she was in'
eluded on the Advisory Board of the
Australian Home Panel of the Wem-
bley Exhibition in England in 1924.”
Continuing, Mr. Thompson said: “It
was while a student at Sydney Techni'
cal College that Florence Taylor met
Mr. George A. Taylor, who was a
guest lecturer. In 1907 they married.
For some time she practiced as an Ar'
chitect then decided to give Mr. Taylor
what help she could in the Publishing
business.
“Mr. Taylor founded the Institute
of Local Government Engineers (af-
terwards absorbed by the Institute of
Engineers). He was a splendid car'
toonist, a writer, a poet, a man with
a musical soul, whose memory is per'
petuated in the George A Taylor
Memorial Prize awarded annually. This
was founded by public subscription on
Mr. Taylor’s death in 1928 (adminis-
tered by the M.B.F. of Aust., and
some £2OOO was collected. The Local
Government Engineers Association
and the University of Sydney also
award prises annually from the Fund,”
Mr. Thompson added, amid prolonged
applause.
In accepting “this magnificent
Award, Mrs. Taylor, who regards it
as the crowning achievement of a life
devoted to the advancement of Arts,
Science, and the building and allied
industries, said:
“Words cannot express my happi-
ness or gratitude, and I thank you,
one and all.”
Mr. Thompson then made the
Award to Mr. Charles F. Gage, presi-
dent of the Australian Institute of
Builders, paid an eloquent tribute
to Mr. Gage’s outstanding qualities as
a Master Builder and a man.
Replying, Mr. Gage said:
“If I can guide the Australian In'
stitute of Builders through the tender
years of its establishment and put it
on a solid foundation, it will give me
great satisfaction to think that I have
deserved the confidence and earned
the esteem of you all,” Mr. Gage
added.
“Master Builders”.
Proposing the Toast of the Master
Builders’ Association of N.S.W., and
the Builders’ Exchange of N.S.W.,
Mr. Cobden Parkes, F.A.1.A., made a
happy speech, in which he congratU'
lated the organisers on the excellent
job they had done in arranging the
dinner.
He reminded the diners that there
must always be sincerity in their work
as builders; it was an indispensable
element, he said.
Mr. Parkes told his audience that
they were sitting on a historic spot,
for the sloping banks on which the
Wentworth stands is the place where
the first settlement in Sydney was
made.
“We have gone a long way since.
“The work, toil and energy of men
of your industry is responsible in a
large measure for the nation’s growth.”
The speaker said builders deserved
full praise for the contributions they
had made in creating cities and towns
and vast projects of all kinds.
Mr. Parkes traced the growth of
the Master Builders’ Association since
it was established in 1873, and the
expansion of both the Association and
the Builders’ Exchange.
He said he was confident that Aus-
tralia will soon be on a better keel
than ever before, “and the achieve'
ments of the past will be nothing to
the achievements of the future.”
Given the materials and money, and
riddance of all controls! and the evils
of cost plus, the spirit of service will
rise again and the industry will fill its
rightful place as the leaders of the
country.
“You must like what you do to be
a successful builder.
“I hope that in future the work of
the Association and the Builders’ Ex'
change will constantly expand as you
as members so richly deserve,” Mr.
Parkes concluded.
Supporting Mr. Coben Parkes in his
remarks, Mr. Eric Andrews, F.A.1.A.,
said the building industry spends the
greatest amount of money of any sec'
tion of the community. Australia
must realise to the full the importance
of the building industry to the nation.
“Architects and builders must pull
together as a team and solve present'
day problems,” Mr. Andrews declared.
He said that the Master Builders’
Association and the Institute of Ar'
chitects had not met together in the
last five years to examine problems
confronting the industry.
He advocated finding ways and
means whereby the two bodies can
combine to assist the community to
appreciate the value of scientific dis-
coveries in building methods.
The founding of the Institute of
Builders was seen by Mr. Andrews as
a forward step, and he said he was
pleased to see further steps being tak'
en to secure registration of builders.
The Institute of Architects support-
ed such registration, the speaker stat'
ed, and felt that registration should be
framed to the high gpal of protecting
all aspects of the public interest, and
not just part of it.
Responding on behalf of the Master
Builders’ Association of N.S.W., the
president, Mr. Charles E. Thompson,
said it was a great privilege to occupy
the Chair and thus be in a position to
reply to the Toast of the Association,

BUILDING; LIGHTING; ENGINEERING
October 24, 1952.


He desired to thank Mr. Cobden
Parkes and Mr. Eric Andrews for
their kindly remarks regarding build-
ers.
“Architects are vital to co-operate
with and put into possible execution
the findings of science to bring the
building industry up-to-date,” Mr.
Thompson said.
“We welcome anything which will
forward the industry,” he added.
“Regarding the Master Builders’ As-
sociation, the Association was formed
on October 21, 1873. The first meet-
ing was held in the Temperance Hall.
“There were good Scots then, and
there are still plenty in the building
industry,” Mr. Thompson said, amid
laughter.
“So, on October 21, the Master
Builders’ Association will achieve the
79th anniversary of its founding,” he
continued.
“In those days, suppliers were ad-
mitted as members of the Association,
and this practice continued until the
introduction of the Industrial Arbitra-
tion Act.
“It then became no longer possible
for suppliers to be members of the As-
sociation, so the Builders’ Exchange
was formed.
“Both organisations have worked in
close association ever since.”
Referring to the registration of
builders, Mr. Thompson said it was
for the public good.
“It is necessary that before being
registered, a builder should be capable
and competent by training and prac-
tice,” he declared.
Mr. Thompson said that since the
war too much work had been started,
leading to shortages of labour and ma-
terials, with the added burdens of the
40-hour week and the basic wage.
“I feel we can do as well as the
builders of the past, and overcome
our difficulties if we get together and
make a concerted effort,” Mr. Thomp'
son declared.
He quoted the Prime Minister, Mr.
Menzies, who once told the builders:
“Squeeze the water out of the in'
dustry, and I will pump money back.”
“If we get our shoulders to the
wheel, and get back to a system of
firm'price tendering and pull together
—builders and suppliers, subcontract'
ors, employers, and archi-
tects —it will create healthy competi'
tion and become a healthy industry,
free of the indigestion of work we are
suffering from.
Mr. Thompson said that there was
undoubtedly an enormous pent'up de'
mand for building work.
“Australia is developing greatly, and
it will be another U.S.A. within 50 or
60 years,” he concluded.
The president of the Builders’ Ex'
change, Mr. W. J. Hogan, supporting
Mr. Thompson, said that in the last
few years there had been the great
problem of too many jobs for the ma-
terials available.
The lifting of controls would help
to stimulate the industry in the com'
ing months.
Mr. Hogan expressed confidence in
the future of Australia, and in the
ability of the nation to surmount its
present difficulties.
“Kindred Associations and
Visitors”.
In proposing this Toast, the Vice-
President of the Builders’ Exchange
of N.S.W., Mr. M. Peake, warmly
welcomed “all visitors from kindred
Association, the Architects, and all
classes of suppliers.”
Mr. Peake said he felt sure that
the building industry, if given the op'
portunity and the money it can go a
long way.
“At present it has to go a lot of the
way with very little money.
“I hope we can soon get on with
the fob of giving the public service.
“I can assure you that the Builders’
Exchange will do its best to assist
the builders to get on with the all'
important tasks of construction,” Mr.
Peake added.
Replying to the Toast, the Presi-
dent of the Building Industry Com
gress, Mr. F. Wilson, 0.8. E., F.A.1.8.,
thanked all present for the manner in
which they had received the Toast.
“Although I am in my twelfth year
as Building Industry Congress presi'
dent, I can still respond on behalf
of kindred associations,” Mr. Wilson
said.
“The building industry as a whole
is the greatest secondary industry of
Australia, and it is a very good bar-
ometer of prosperity of the commun-
ity.”
Mr. Wilson said the Federal Gov-
AMERICA HOUSES HER PEOPLE.
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York, is probably one of the greatest builders
of all time, for it has planned, erected and operated huge housing schemes all over the United
States. One of the most recent to be completed is Parklabrea Towers and Garden Apartments
at Los Angeles, which consists of eighteen huge star-shaped tower apartment buildings each
of thirteen storeys. Architects were Schultz & Associates. The Architectural Digest," U.S.A.
We have, in Australia, many insurance companies rich enough to carry out a national work
of great magnitude. We just have to leave it to private enterprise to develop the country if it
is to be developed at all.

ernment has made a contribution
through building societies of £9O mil-
lions this financial year,
“We must agree that it has done a
really good job for the building in-
dustry, which otherwise would be in a
bad way.
“The Building Industry Congress
was responsible for getting another
£4B millions made available to keep
the industry going.
“We have been responsible for ob-
taining the removal of the iniquitous
Building Controls Act, and the State
Government has removed controls on
all building materials.
“The result is that it is now a buy-
ers’ market, and not a sellers’ market.
“Builders who take advantage of
this will do quite well,” Mr. Wilson
added.
“There was more damage done in
that period by small builders who did
not realise their responsibilities, but
bought on the black market.
Mr. Wilson said the Building In-
dustry Congress had endeavoured to
get stable conditions in the building
industry.
“There is not the slightest reason
why the industry cannot make a valu-
able and lasting contribution to the
community.
“I hope our friendship will con-
tinue for all time,” Mr. Wilson added.
In supporting Mr. Wilson, the
President, Council of Suburban Mast-
er Builders’ Association, Mr. Walter
J. Bryant, said it was a very great
honour to represent nine Suburban
Associations at the function.
“Might I congratulate the Master
Builders’ Association on the thought
which prompted them to make the
fine presentation to Mrs. Taylor?” Mr.
Bryant asked.
“May I also congratulate Mrs.
Taylor upon being the recipient of
the very fine plaque.
“It is a great honour, and one rich-
ly deserved.”
Mr. Bryant continued, saying he
would like to point out that each Sub-
urban Association controlled its own
affairs, and dealt with the problems
peculiar to the districts in which their
members reside.
“No one wanted to see the boom
period come back,” he continued.
“In regard to industrial matters, the
Master Builders’ Associations unites
as one body, and we feel that the
very keen personal interest shown by
president Charles Thompson and Act-
ing-Secretary Bill Ford will ensure a
continuance of that spirit of goodwill
which exists today.
“The welding together of these in-
paying members rich divi-
dends,” Mr. Bryant said.
He referred to the troublesome per-
tod which did not allow the building
industry to make full progress, and
spoke in optimistic manner of the
future.
Mr. Bryant dealt with the training
of future tradesmen, and quoted figures
to emphasise the need for a concrete
policy.
He appealed to everyone to encour-
age lads to enter the building industry.
“I feel that some general effort on
the part of the Suburban Associations
and the Master Builders’ Associations
to get together would be of very great
advantage to all concerned.
“May I appeal for unity, and the
finding of ways and means of getting
to know the executives of our indus-
try, so we can discuss the problems
peculiar to our calling?” Mr. Bryant
concluded.

BOOK REVIEW.
“House Drainage Practice,” by A.
J. McL. Munro. 68 pp. Index.
Illustrated. Angus Robert-
son Ltd., Sydney. Price, 21/-.
A thorough knowledge of the
modern theory and practice of house
drainage is a great asset to all con-
nected with the building industry; no,
more( it is really an essential attribute
if one is to profess to be master of
one’s calling.
This subject is usually taught and
dealt with in textbooks covering the
whole range of sanitation and hygiene,
which to-day, with the great advances
of heating, mechanical ventilation, air-
conditioning and the many other fac-
tors that go to make up the modern
building is a fairly wide subject.
Mr. Munro has confined his book to
the subject of house drainage, thus
providing a text and reference work
for the builder who is interested in
home-building rather than factory con-
struction or city buildings, although, of
course, the fundamental principles are
the same.
The initial chapter appropriately
deals with By-laws to be remembered,
then definitions are covered, and we
come to drainage fittings and appur-
tenances, excellent drawings illustrat-
ing the various apparatus and practice.
An essential chapter is that dealing
with septic tanks, so many of which
have been installed in recent years
owing to the continued outstripping
by building progress of sewerage re-
ticulation. Oil, like grease, is not al-
lowed to enter the Board’s sewers, so
a special chapter is devoted to this
problem and details of an oil recovery
pit as developed at ’bus transport
depots are included. Sewage ejectors
for use where sewage has to be re-
moved from basements that are below
the sewer are dealt with, also the very
practical problem of how to handle
and overcome chokages.
Altogether a useful book dealing
simply but comprehensively with a sub-
ject of importance to the community.

he hasn’t got six kids”

FiBROUS PLASTER INDUSTRY DINNER
Minister for Works Denounces Prevailing "Physiological Funk"
The Minister for the Interior and
Works The Hon. W. S. Kent Hughes,
M.V.0., 0.8. E., M.C., M.P., speak-
ing at the Federal Industry Dinner
given by the Associated Fibrous
Plaster Manufacturers of Australia held
at “Amory,” Ashfield, on Wednesday
October 15th., 1952, deplored the
prevailing state of what he described
as “physiological funk” which was pre-
vailing in some quarters and sapping
public confidence. There was no real
foundation or reason for this outlook,
which should not be allowed to con-
tinue.
He was responding to the toast of
Parliament that had been proposed by
Mr. Cobden Parkes, President of the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects.
The Federal Government, he said,
fully realised that the Building Indus-
try, which is second only to Agricul-
ture in magnitude and importance, was
a most reliable barometer of the pro-
gress and prosperity of the Nation.
When recently some falling-away was
observed in building figures every
effort was made to make the maximum
amount of money available for build-
ing and £60,000,000 was allocated for
housing of various kinds, State and
Federal, this financial year.
Since last July, it had been noted
that figures were beginning to steadily
improve and there was no reason -for
gloom. “Don’t think yourself into a
depression,” he said.
Unbalanced Building
Programme.
It was necessary, however, for the
Industry itself to achieve certain things
in order to restore prosperity, and the
first and most vital was the return to
the fixed contract and the complete
abandonment of the cost-plus system.
Since the war, as the result of the in-
tense concentration on homes to the
virtual exclusion of all other forms of
building, the development programme
had become unbalanced and there was
an immense amount of backlog to be
taken up in city commercial building
and other types of building.
No More Prefabs.
Other points of particular interest
that the Minister made in his speech
were:—
(1) The Federal Government ceased
ordering prefabs, at the end of
last year; earlier they had
served their purpose but were
becoming too expensive.
(2) Local Building Regulations were
out-of-date in many ways and
made no allowance for new
methods of construction and
building techniques. He hoped
that the Building Industry Con-
gress would endeavour to per-
suade Local Authorities to re-
view and revise their building
regulations from time to time.
(3) He would like to see the Com-
monwealth Experimental Build-
ing Station at Ryde taken over
by private industry—either with
or without Government sub-
sidy—for he felt the results
would be better for all con'
cerned.
(4) Standardised “modular” con'
struction is now being used in
the construction of all new
buildings for the Services and
he believed great benefits would
result and that the use of the
system could be expanded into
other avenues.
£6.000,000 For War Service
Homes.
Responding to the toast of “Our
Guests,” proposed by Mr. D. J. O’Dell,
Smale, Deputy'Director, War Service
Homes Division, said that last year in
N.S.W. £5,059,000 was made available
for the activities of his Department;
this year the allocation was over
£6,000,000. He was more than satis'
fied by the decision of his organisation
in insisting on supervision by regis-
tered architects of all its home projects.
Mr. Adrian Ashton, F.R.1.8.A., who
also responded on behalf of the guests,
said that it was obvious that building
costs had become too high up to
four times those of 1939 - and the
industry had tended to “price itself
out of the market.” Greater man-hour
productivity and more efficient or-
ganisation and management could assist
in this problem. In this respect the
Association, by its organisation of the
industry, the development of standard
specifications and the earnest desire to
produce good material and craftsman-
ship at the most reasonable price to
the industry was performing a most
important service.
More Mechanisation.
Mr. E. Knox, 8.C.E., M.I.E.
(Aust.), Director of Works, N.S.W.,
in proposing the toast of the Building
Industry traced the development of
building since the introduction of Port-
land cement in 1825. the use of steel
as a structural material and the intro-
duction of reinforced concrete, which
had revolutionised building practice in
the first half of the twentieth century.
The development of “off the site
work”—building boards, prefab, units,
etc. —had been a feature of the last
twenty years, but he predicted that
the next twenty years would see the
ever-increasing use of mechanisation
on the site.
The response to this toast was in the
hands of Mr. S. Scorer, of Newcastle,
representing Mr. Fred Wilson, 0.8. E..
President, Federal Council, Building
Industry Congress, who unfortunately

could not attend owing to ill-health.
Mr. Scorer in a vigorous speech
said that he considered that the devia-
tion from the contract system that had
occurred in recent years, had had
grievous results for the building indus-
try. He was, indeed, glad to see that
the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia had, at the recent Conference
in Perth, reaffirmed its belief in the
contract system. The major job facing
the Building Industry to-day was to
restore the confidence of the people
in it.
Personalities in the Industry.
In proposing the toast of the
Fibrous Plaster Industry, Mr. Stewart
Fraser, M.J.1., Federal Executive Sec-
retary, Building Industry Conference,
paid tribute to the personalities that
had built up the industry, which he
believed had advanced more rapidly
than other section of the building in-
dustry, He saluted the fine and wise
personalities who had led the industry
to its present splendid state of soli-
darity.
Mr. A. C. Mitchinson, Foundation
President, in his response said that the
Association was doing everything in
its power in the face of the enormous
increases of the raw materials—plaster,
fibre and timber —to reduce costs, and
were hopeful of importing sisal at a
considerably reduced price in the
future. He had every faith in the
product, the Association and Australia.
Mr. L. W. Cockshell, from Adelaide,
Immediate Past - President, supported
Mr. Mitchinson’s remarks.
The new President, Mr. D. J.
O’Dell, paid a warm and sincere
tribute to the great and efficient work
for the Association of its Secretary,
Mr. C. T. Jarman.
At the end of the long toast list,
Mr. Kent Hughes presented plaster
bas relief plaques to Past-Presidents
Alan Bamfield of Perth and Sid Cowley
of Hobart, and also a handsome tea
service to Mr. Mitchinson—universally
known as “Mitch” —as a token of
esteem for the great work that he had
carried out for the Fibrous Plaster
Industry over so many years, and
especially since he was elected the
initial Chairman of the Federal or-
ganisation in 1945.
During the evening a splendid pro-
gramme of harmony was provided by
George Brown (piano), Eric Creighton
(compere and siffleur), Ron Dowd
(tenor), and Syd Clarke (novelty
violinist). There were also many
humorous references by the Minister,
Stewart Fraser and Todd Jarman in
their various speeches to a mysterious
ancient brotherhood known as the
“Light Horse.”
Immense Future Of
Building Industry
J. O. Cramer’s Confidence.
Officially opening the Annual Con-
ference of the Associated Fibrous
Plaster Manufacturers of Australia at
Usher’s Hotel on October 14th, Mr.
J. O. Cramer, M.P., expressed com-
plete confidence in the “Immense Fu-
ture” of the Building Industry in Aus-
tralia, which he said in his opinion,
was greater than in any other country
in the world,
“Calamity Howlers” would have us
believe otherwise because of the pres-
ent lag, but,” Mr. Cramer continued,
“I believe there will be a considerable
uplift in the building industry within
the next three or four months.”
Of all the industries in Australia
building must go on and no part of
the industry must be allowed to lag;
those who believed in the great future
of the industry were not dismayed by
the present temporary stage but were
using it to plan for bigger and better
output. He believed they would bene-
fit by this foresight.
The Commonwealth Government
fully realised that the Building Indus-
try is a key industry and one that
creates national assets; this was re-
flected in the fact that it was making
available £28,000,000 for War Ser-
vice Homes and £30,000,000 for
Housing Commissions in four States.
Removal of Controls.
He welcomed the removal of Price
Control on building materials iust an-

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust.-N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building. 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday,
2nd October, 1952, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. E. L. Freedman,
warmly welcomed the 101 members
and visitors who were present.
He particularly welcomed the ladies
of the Society, also many older mem-
bers of the Society, who, though no
longer closely associated with lighting
matters, had come to receive the Mem-
bership Certificates. He also welcomed
the Presidents of the kindred organisa-
tions and the principals of some of the
Sustaining Members, who normally
delegated Society affairs to the mem-
bers of their lighting departments.
Minutes of General Meeting held
on the 4th September, 1952, were
taken as read and confirmed.
Visit to E.L.M.A. Works.
The President announced that 42
members and visitors would visit the
factory of Electric Lamp Manufacturers
(A’sia) Ltd. on Six Hour Day, Mon-
day, October 6th. (See separate re-
port.)
Membership.
The President reported that the
following had been admitted as Asso-
ciate Members: K. G. Pither, Wagga
Wagga; H. P. Crocker. 9 Stuart Ave.,
Manly.
Presentation of Certificates.
Mrs. D. C. 3. Maclurcan, the wife
of the President of National Council,
presented the Membership Certificates
to the Members of the Society. The
President stressed the importance of
this step through which the profes-
sional status of the Corporate Members
of the Society had been defined and
confirmed, and for the guidance of
members read Clause 12 and comment
thereto from the Code of Ethics,
which had been circulated to all mem-
hers early this year. Mr. Freedman
stated that it was particularly pleasing
to Members in this State to have on
their certificates the signatures of Mr.
D. C. B. Maclurcan and Mr. T. S.
Crouch as National President and Hon.
General Secretary, and he thanked
these two on behalf of the Society
for the great amount of work which
had gone into the preparing of the
presentation of certificates.
Presentation of Fellowship
Certificates to Mr, J. Knight.
The President reported with great
pleasure that Mr. John Knight, the
Immediate Past - President of the
Society, had been invited to become a
Fellow, and asked Mrs. Maclurcan to
present Mr. Knight with his certificate.
The President stressed the continuity
of service which the Society had re-
ceived from Mr. Knight since he join-
ed in 1939. He had held almost every
office of the Society, had read many
technical papers, and, since 1946, has
been the lecturer in Illumination I and
111 at the Sydney Technical College.
Next Meeting.
The President informed the meeting
that on November 6th at 7.30 p.m.
the monthly General Meeting of the
Society would take the form of an
Open Discussion Night, to which the
lecturers and students of the Depart-
ments of Architecture, Electrical En-
gineering and Optometry of the Syd-
ney University of Technology had
been invited. The opening speaker
will be Mr. Harry Seidler. A.R.A.1.A.,
the winner of this year’s Sulman
Award.
Better Light, Better Sight,
Better Health.
The subject for the evening was a
talk by Mr. S. Holman, 8.E.,
A.M.I.E. (Aust.), M.I.E.S. (Aust),
entitled “Better Light, Better Sight,
Better Health.” Mr. Holman was the
convenor of the special committee con'
vened for the preparation of the I.E.S.
Stand for the Health Week Exhibition
at the Sydney Town Hall in October,
1952. This Stand was on display at
the Society Hall.
Mr. Holman gave a brief report on
the history which had led up to the
the exhibition, and the committee
work which had gone into the design
and construction of the display. He
then demonstrated in detail the layout
of the Stand at the Town Hall and
illustrated this with a slide.
He explained that in essence the dis-
play comprises three essential elements,
a number of rather spectacular and
educational demonstrations to arrest
the attention of the passer-by, a re-
corded talk on principles of good
home lighting for those interested in
the subject, and finally, a leaflet giving
a test in the home together with some
practical hints for good home lighting.
Some of the demonstrations design-
ed to arrest attention were then shown
to the audience. These included the
effects of direct and indirect glare, a
grotesque bug with bulging lamps
(operated by a flasher) for eyes under
the caption “Glare is the Bug-Bear of
Good Lighting,” the change of colour
which takes place when identical dis-
play material is illuminated by different
light sources, and so on. Mr. Holman
also used a special light-testing box to
demonstrate the need for high values
of illumination for the performance of
close-seeing tasks, such as reading
newsprint. When asked to select the
most comfortable illuminations to suit
her needs, one of the ladies of his
audience chose a value of 90 foot
candles.
He finally enacted for his audience
the recorded talk which will be played
to the Town Hall public at intervals
of fifteen minutes. In this talk a de-
scription is given in clear and general-
ly acceptable terms of the principles
of light and sight as shown on the
background display. Lights are switch-
ed on and off and the answers to the
three questions:
How much can you read?
How fast can you see?
How much can you see?
become obvious: The first question re-
ferred to a card, one half of which
had been printed with letters of
ILLUMINATING ENGINEERS AT NEWCASTLE.
(From left to right) Messrs. B. H. Vandenberg, G. C. T. Brown, E. L. Freedman, and F. Cox.
36

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


diminishing size and the other half
with letters of constant size but with
a background of diminishing contrast.
The second question referred to a re'
volving disc on which had been paint'
ed the bold outlines of the spokes of
a wheel. When more light was
switched on, more lines on both
charts became legible. The third
question referred to a sketch on which
the message “glare reduces seeing”
had been printed around a light'fitting
showing a bare lamp. When a bare
lamp behind a hole in the sketch is
siwtched on the message_is obliterated
by the resulting glare. There was no
doubt left in his audience’s mind that
more light made for better sight.
Assisted by two of his committee'
men, Mr. B. H. Harwood and Mr. L.
S. Hyatt, he then showed the applica'
tions of these principles to the prob'
lems of lighting the home, and illus'
trated these with a series of cartoons,
drawings, and coloured photographs.
Mr. Holman concluded by express'
ing the hope that the display for the
Town Hall would be used many more
times in schools, for lectures to com'
merce and industry, and exhibitions in
other centres.
Vote of Thanks.
The vote of thanks to Mr. Holman
was proposed from the Chair. The
President stated that a different situa'
tion was faced than which is normally
prevalent at the close of the meetings
of the Society. He felt that Mr.
Holman was the exponent of a large
group of the Society members who
had contributed so much to the de'
velooment of the I.E.S. Stand. He
therefore suggested that the audience
at the meeting had been fortunate to
receive a firsthand report from Mr.
Holman, but that the thanks of the
whole of the Society were due to him
and his helpers. He gave a detailed
report of the personnel of the various
committees, all of whom had con'
tributed generously in the fields with
which they were most versed and suit'
ed. He told of the spontaneity of
the support which the Society had re'
ceived in this venture from its Sus'
taining Members, to whom also he ex'
pressed the thanks of the Society.
The President emphasised that the
heart and soul of many months of hard
work had been Mr. S. Holman, who
had spared no effort to make the I.E.S.
Stand a success at the Town Hall, and
who had assembled this Stand for the
preview at this meeting.
The vote of thanks to Mr. Holman
and to his team of helpers was carried
by the audience with great enthusiasm.

Expansion
Pitt Street Property To Be
Modernised.
Speaking at the annual meeting of
G. J. Coles 6? Co. Ltd., the Chairman,
Mr. G. J. Coles, said that thirty new
stores were acquired during the year,
bringing the total to 172; it was con'
sidered that a steady policy of expan'
sion is desirable and several sites have
been acquired in growing areas where
new stores would be established as
finance became available.
It was proposed to extend and
modernise the recently acquired
Stewart Dawson property in Pitt
Street, Sydney to take advantage of
the trade offering in that busy centre.

British School Construction
334 COMPLETED LAST YEAR.
Three hundred and thirty-four new
primary and secondary schools were
completed and put into operation in
Great Britain during 1951, according
to the Ministry of Education’s annual
report, “Education in 1951,” while at
the end of the year 1130 new schools
were under construction.
Thirty-seven new special schools for
handicapped children brought their
total to 634, and a start was made on
major projects for technical education
costing almost £7 million. Work
valued at £15,500,000 was in progress
at the end of the year,
Australia, in the building doldrums
for 12 years because of controls, has
nothing to compare with an activity
like this, though our population has
been increasing more rapidly.
THE AUSTRALIAN PLANNING
INSTITUTE.
PLANNING CONGRESS,
MELBOURNE, OCTOBER 21st-25th,
1952.
Comprehensive Programme.
A comprehensive programme was
arranged by The Australian Plan'
ning Institute for its first Congress
held in Melbourne from October
21st to 25th. This new organisation—
a Federal body—was formed at the
Planning Congress held at Canberra
last year.
The 1952 Congress will concentrate
on two principal themes, in the de-
velopment of which actual planning
work now proceeding will be the sub'
ject of papers by planning experts;
exhibitions and inspection tours.
One theme dealt with Regional
Development as illustrated by the vast
undertakings now growing in the
Latrobe Valley, Gippsland—Australia’s
largest sub'regional area to be the sub'
ject of planning.
The other considered the Master
Plan now being prepared, under Legis'
lative Authority, by the Melbourne
Metropolitan Board of Works, for the
future growth of Greater Melbourne,
and the correction of its many plan'
ning defects.
The Congress was opened on Oc'
tober 21st at which addresses were
given by Hon. P. C. Byrnes, M.L.C.,
Minister for Public Works and Minis'
ter in charge of Planning; Hon. Sir
Herbert Hyland, M.L.A., chairman,
Latrobe Valley Development Advisory
Committee, and Mr. C. G. Roberts,
Chief Engineer, Country Roads Board
and President of the Melbourne Divh
sion of the Institute.
Papers Delivered.
Hereunder in brief are some of the
papers delivered: —

NOTTINGHAM’S NEW TECHNICAL COLLEGE.
The irregular nature of the site in the centre of Nottingham has influenced the development of the
unusual plan for this important new British project which it is hoped will shortly be com-
menced. The models bv Cecil Howitt & Partners, as well as drawings were exhibited in the
architectural section of the 1952 Royal Academy. On the left is one of the two multi storey
blocks while on the right is a view of the model from above showing the planning in detail.

Illawarra Builders’
Exchange
Construction Commenced on
New Home.
Work was recently commenced on
the erection of the Builders’ Exchange
Building, Wollongong, for the Ilia'
warra Master Builders’ Association.
The foundations have now been
completed, and the building is sched'
uled to be ready within three months.
From all reports it will be a really
modern Exchange, with ample amen-
ities for members.
Plans call for a single'Storey build'
ing, and another storey will be added
as expansion warrants.
Mr. R. Rosten, Wollongong Master
Builder, is supervising construction,
and each builder is contributing one
day’s labour.
The Exchange is being financed by
.£2O interest'free debentures, and
builder'members are also credited
for work performed.
The building is estimated to cost
£6OOO, and already £2OO has been
saved on the foundations.
Ample Linseed In
Queensland
For the first time in Queensland’s
history, locally'grown linseed was
shipped to Sydney this year.
A Northgate firm, which put 110
acres of rustproof linseed under cub
tivation on the Darling Downs in
1947, now processes as well as grows
the seed.
The firm, Meggitts Ltd., now find
it unnecessary to import linseed from
overseas to meet Queensland’s re-
quirements.
Linseed oil is one of the most im-
portant ingredients used by the paint
and varnish industry, and the increase
in Queensland’s production will great'
ly help local manufacturers.

Introducing the Shower to Britain
“MORE ECONOMICAL THAN BATHS," SAYS EXPERT.
The economic advantages of the
shower, compared with the bath, form-
ed the main subject in a paper,
“Domestic Electric Water Heating,”
presented by Mr. C. Hubert Smith,
M.1.E.E., M.1.H.V.E., at the recent
British Electrical Power Convention.
“The time'honoured bath, requiring
anything from 20 to 60 gallons of
water, according to it size, is a very
inefficient means of taking a bath, not
only in regard to fuel consumption to
produce the necessary hot water, but
in water consumption. The shower
bath is a far more efficient method of
giving equally good results.”
The total consumption of mixed
water —hot plus cold —was three gab
lons for a three to six minutes’ shower,
and when the water was electrically
heated the consumption of electricity
was half a unit.
There was a wide application for
this equipment in factory and mine-
head ablution rooms, and there was
little doubt that when the prejudice
in favour of the bath had been over'
come it would become domestically
popular. Such an innovation, said the
speaker, would be welcomed by
departments as a means of
water consumption.
[As all visitors to England are
aware, it is most unusual to see a
shower in any bathroom.—Ed.}

STAR-SHAPED FLATS
This star-shaped plan is used extensively in Sweden on large housing projects. A typical block
will have three storeys and an attic each staircase, without exterior side lighting series three
flats on each floor and receives daylight through the roof. Top flats have the bedrooms in the
attic reached by a private staircase. A recent Swedish project, the Rosta Estate, contains some
1500 flats.

GLUED LAMINATED TIMBER CONSTRUCTION
REMARKABLE PROGRESS BEING MADE.
A few short years ago the glued
laminated timber arch was a novelty
to be admired or doubted according
to one’s outlook. To-day, this type of
construction has passed from the
realms of the novel and experimental
and is being used more and more ex-
tensively in many new and unusual
forms. Roof trusses, however, remain
a vital field and an interesting in-
stallation is that at present being car-
ried out at Granville for C.C. En-
gineering Industries Ltd. to the de-
signs of Mr. Malcolm Stanley, of
Stanley and Llewellyn, Structural En-
gineers, who was one of the Australian
pioneers in this field.
The “Stanley arches” in this installa-
tion have a span of no less than
130 ft., and with the pitched and
curved alternate panels introduce an
entirely new development.
In order to provide lighting, the
roof is sub-divided into alternate
panels—arch panels and skillion panels
—one span in each of the depressed
panels being glazed so that the ad-
vantages of saw-tooth lighting is ob-
tained without the disadvantages of
box gutters. Further, the problems of
rain water disposal are reduced to a
minimum, for the arch and skillion
panels both discharge into a common
eaves gutter. Elimination of box gut-
ters with the underground drainage
system and internal down-pipes is a
factor inherent in this type of design,
which gives great spans covering huge
areas efficient in natural lighting and
free from rain-water troubles.
Heavy corrugated asbestos is the
covering material to the skillion panels,
having a minimum slope of 10ft., while
the arched panels are also covered
with heavy corrugated asbestos mould-
ed to the curvature of the arch sup-
plied by local manufacturers.
Glued Laminated Oregon.
The arch ribs are constructed in
glued laminated Oregon, in this case
of 6ft. x |in. double dressed and
seasoned to a moisture content of 16%.
They are assembled on the site in
simple jigs or clamps which permit of
rapid assembly and cramping. The
130 ft. span arch ribs were completely
assembled in one and a quarter hours,
in other words a timber member ap-
proximating 150 feet in length is
“grown” at the rate of two feet a
minute. Incidentally, the glue is Aus-
tralian made.
The tie or tension rods are in this
case two steel flats, thus providing
adequate cross-sectional area and sim-
plicity of attachment to the essential
points. Observation over some years
on long-span laminated timber trusses
have not shown any sliding movement
at the truss seatings.
The form of truss shown is the re-
sult of individual research by Malcolm
Stanley, commencing with models of
30in. span and observing same under
load in conformity with routine en-
gineering procedure.
The trusses are popular because of
their (1) low cost, (2) high strength,
and (3) great lateral rigidity compared
with steel. The handling and lifting
of the trusses is much simplified be-
cause of the stiffness of the arch mem-
ber and “A” frame assembly. Eight
of the 130 ft. span trusses were lifted
in one day—a tribute to the works
foreman, Mr. J. Mason.
Fire Resistance.
Interesting debate arises as to the
comparative fire resistance between
trusses of steel and laminated timber
for the same spans. The consensus of
opinion appears to give fire laminated
timber the advantage. The dimension
of the arch rib is such that an intense
heat concentration for a considerable
length of time is necessary to either
disturb the load'carrying capacity or to
burn through the member. Steel sec-
tions for a truss of like span subjected
to the same heat-time range would
buckle and collapse. The glued lami-
nated rib is built up of laminate, like
the leaves of a book, the latter is diffi-
cult to burn, hence the analogy. Heat-
resisting paints are available and their
use adds to the resistance to flame.
The site manufacture of these
trusses has for the contractor many
advantages. Once the simple clamps
are set up production follows a routine
and is sandwiched in with other sec-
tions of the contract. Truss members
are rapidly “grown” to any size, length
and shape, this adaptability is a tre-
mendous factor to the designer, the
addition of one or two laminate in-
creases enormously the strength out of
all proportion to their cost. As a
structural material glued laminated
timber is a mighty contribution to
modern construction.
The photographs effectively illus-
trate Australian progress in the appli-
cation of this ancient building material
to the structures of to-day.

More Paint Used In
Queensland
According to experts, Queensland
houses require more paint and oil than
any houses in Australia.
The average amount of paint used
for Queensland homes is 24 gallons.
The weather is mainly responsible.
In Queensland the need for paint
protection is greater, as there are
periods of rain as well as continuous
heat in summer.
The average life of paint in
Queensland is given as five years.

M.B.A. WINS APPRENTICESHIP AWARD APPEAL
Variation Challenged and Set Aside
FULL TEXT OF JUDGMENT.
On October 8, judgment was given
in an appeal by the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W. against the
award of the Carpenters and Joiners
and Bricklayers’ Apprenticeship Coum
cil made on March 18, 1952.
In his Judgment, the Industrial
Commissioner, Mr. Justice Cantor,
said:
This is an appeal by the Master
Builders’ Association of New South
Wales from two awards fixing new
rates of pay, made by the Carpenters
and Joiners and Bricklayers’ (State)
Apprenticeship Council, one a varia'
tion of the Carpenters and Joiners’
(State) Apprenticeship Award and the
other a variation of the Bricklayers
and Tuckpointers (State) Apprentice'
ship Award. In each case the prim
cipal award was made as far back as
1934: the Carpenters and Joiners
principal award is published in 46 I.G.
836 and the Bricklayers and Tuck'
pointers Award in 46 I.G. 1121. Over
the years many variations of each of
these apprenticeship awards have been
made.
The variations now challenged were
made pursuant to an application made
by the Building Workers Industrial
Union of Australia, New South
Wales Branch, to the Apprenticeship
Council for increased rates of pay for
both indentured apprentices and
trainee apprentices in the said trades.
Insofar as carpenters and joiners are
concerned, at the time of the making
of the application to the Apprentice'
ship Council the rate of pay fixed by
the award were the rates established
by the Full Bench of the Commission
in 1948 (1948 A.R. 95), adjusted in
terms of changes in the basic wage.
The same level of rates were prescrib'
ed by the Apprenticeship Council for
bricklayer and tuckpointer apprentices
and trainee apprentices
Agreement Sought.
During consideration of the appli'
cation by the Apprenticeship Council
the Apprenticeship Commissioner,
who. pursuant to Section 28. sits with
members as assessors only, at an early
stage of the discussion intimated to
the parties that he believed that the
awards should not be dealt with in a
piecemeal way. He considered that
the issue of wages and conditions
should be considered by the Appren-
ticeship Council as a whole. The Ap-
prenticeship Commissioner made it
clear that, while reaching no final de'
cision on the point, he was disposed
to regard the application for varia
tion of the rates of pay only as one
that should be ruled against for this
reason.
However, on the 3rd March last
after some discussion it was agreed by
all the parties that they should confer
together in an endeavour to reach
agreement. At a further sitting of the
Council on the 18th March, when the
applicant Union and representing em'
ployers, the Metal Trades Employers’
Association, the Employers’ Federa'
tion, the Maritime Services Board, the
Public Service Board and the Master
Builders’ Association were present, it
was reported that conferences had
been held as arranged and that agree'
ment had been reached between the
Union and all those representing em'
ployers except the Master Builders’
Association. It was asked that the
agreement should be embodied in
awards of variation, but to this the
representative of the Master Builders’
Association objected.
M.B.A. Leadership.
The Master Builders’ Association is
a very important, if not the principal,
industrial union of employers in the
building trades, representing . large
numbers of master builders in the
State governed by the Awards. The
records of the Commission show that
for many years the Association has al-
ways taken a leading part in the set-
tlement by award and industrial agree-
ment of the industrial conditions of
employers and employed in the build-
ing trades.
To my mind, an agreement, with
such a representative body of employ'
ers as the Master Builders’ Associa'
tion outstanding—and indeed object'
ing—without further material before
the Council justifying its terms, should
not have been turned into an award
obligation binding upon all employers
and employees. In point of fact, the
agreement reached was that the rates
of pay contained in the awards
should be deleted and the rates pre'
scribed by the current Federal Metal
Trades Award substituted, with the
following results:—
Appeal Should Succeed.
However, with the incomplete
agreement the only material before it,
the awards of variation now challeng'
ed by the Master Builders’ Associa'
tion in this appeal were made.
Several grounds were argued by
Mr. Beattie of Counsel for the appeh
lant in support of the appeal, but as,
in my opinion, the appeal should sue'
ceed upon the ground that there was
nothing before the Apprenticeship
Council to justify the variations
made, it is unnecessary to deal with
any of the other points argued. In
my view the awards of variation must

By glazing the spandrels formed by the alternate bays of pitched and curved roof adequate
natural light is admitted to the interior. Box-gutters are eliminated and all roof water is

be set aside. I take the view, and
act upon it, that in the absence of
special circumstances an order on ap'
peal should not be given retrospective
effect, whether it increases or reduces
rates of pay.
There are no special circumstances
in this case, and I hold that the order
setting aside the variation should op'
erate in each employer’s establishment
from the commencement of the first
pay period after the 2nd October,
1952, the date of the announcement
of this decision. It remains further
to vary each award of variation be'
cause they do not accurately reflect
the agreement that was in fact reach'
ed. It is common ground that the
awards will conform to the agreement
made if with respect to indentured ap'
prentices there be added to the second
proviso following the wage rates the
following:—-
“And Provided further that the
application of. subsection (4) of
Section 6 IF. of the Industrial
Arbitration Act to the said rate
of £6.4.1 per week is hereby ex'
pressly excluded”
and with respect to trainee apprentices
there be added, after the first proviso
following the wage scale in each award
the following:—
“And Provided further that the
application of subsection (4) of
section 6IF. of the Industrial Ar'
bitration Act to the rate of
.£7.2.11 per week is hereby ex'
pressly excluded.”
The order or award embodying
these variations will take effect from
the date when the awards of variation
were themselves directed to take effect,
and will remain in operation so long
only as those awards of variation re'
main in operation pursuant to the
first order herein already announced.

Personalities
Since the Master Builders’ Federa'

and Mr. R. C. Brown, of Victoria, be'
came the first President, forty'one
gentlemen of outstanding calibre have
occupied the Presidential chair.
With the recent election of Mr. C.
R. Hansen, of Victoria, he becomes
the fortV'second President, and the
twelfth President to represent his
State.
Next comes N.S.W., who has had
nine Presidents, Queensland with
eight, followed by South Australia
(six). Western Australia (five), Tas'
mania (one), and Newcastle (one).
The Senior Past'President, Mr. M.
R. Hornibrook (Queensland), occu'
pied the Presidential Chair in 1925,
and Mr. W. Essery (South Australia)
who was elected Honorary Vice'Presi'
dent at the last Convention, was Fed'
eration President in 1950.
Mr. Hornibrook told “Construction”
that he is also the oldest living Past'
President, but that he expected to
round out many more years of useful
service to the Australian building in'
dustry.
Mr. Essery, who is one of the best
known Master Builders in his State,
said that he greatly enjoys the splendid
fellowship that exists between the
States, and added that he hopes to
be long spared to attend the Conven-
tions.

illustrate two examples of his skill as a delin-
eator (top) the Elizabeth Noble Apartment

British Construction Plant
WILL HELP TO MECHANISE BUILDING.
In answer to the cry for the mech-
anisation of building, British manu-
facturers have come to the fore as
producers of machines for the mod-
ern builder. These -machines are of
primary importance in the rehousing
of the over-crowded and homeless in
war-torn areas, but are also capable
in most instances of being used by
builders of homes anywhere.
Powered Barrows.
Outstanding among the develop-
ments in design and construction of
building equipment in the U.K. since
1945 is that of the wheelbarrow.
Without doubt, the barrow is one of
the most useful, simple machines ever
evolved by man. Through the ages
it has been propelled by hand, but
British ingenuity has now equipped
it with a power unit, ranging in
horsepower from 1 to 22.
Naturally, the advent of the pow-
ered barrow requires some adjustment
of procedure on the building site,
governed bv the machine’s overall
efficiency and performance.
Already, many different ways have
been found of using this machine to
good advantage, resulting in a great
saving of materials.
Hitherto, materials delivered to a
job were shot or stacked at the near-
est point to the foundations, result-
ing in heavy losses by breakage, bur-
ial and short distance re-cartage.
With a powered barrow, materials
are now conveniently placed in a cen-
tral storage space on the site at any
suitable distance and parcelled out to
the job as needed.
Some Features.
A feature in the design of powered
barrows is that their capacity is di-
rectly proportional to the mixed batch
capacities of the British Standard con-
crete mixers—one batch, one barrow
full.
A large number of U.K. firms are
now producing these barrows, and the
illustrations, 1-11, show some of the
results of their efforts.
These machines are at their best
on level or graded sites where there
is freedom of movement.
On hillside site or where the
ground is uneven, a crawler or track-
ed barrow is recommended. The pro-
ducts of Tutz-Tractors Ltd. (Nos. 4
and 11) are in this field. These track-
ed barrows or Skipdozers, are made in
two models, both fitted with skips and
dozers, one powered by an 8 h.p.
petrol engine, the other by a 10 h,
diesel engine.
Skip capacities are 10 cu. ft. and
14 cu. ft. respectively, to match up
with drum capacities of concrete mix-
ers, as in the case of powered bar-
rows; the larger of the two models
may be fitted with a 1/3 cu. yd.
shovel.
Still greater tractive power is given
by a similar outfit made by Mont-
gomerie Reid Engineering Co. (No.
8) having a 7 cu. ft. skip capacity,
mounted on a 22 h.p. British tractor.
It will be noticed that in all but one
of the powered barrows illustrated,
there is a seat for the driver. Perhaps
the simplest to operate is the Winget
(No. 1). It automatically stops when
the driver lets go the steering wheel,
and reverses when the engine is ro-
tated full circle about its vertical axis.
The Nash barrow (Fig. 3), which
has a light roller on its back axle, can
be driven at 18 m.p.h.
Another solution to the problem
of site transportation of materials is
by means of the Monorail Transporter
(Fig. 12). A driverless train of skips
may be set in motion by the mixer
operator, the train being brought to
a standstill by stops conveniently
placed in the rail.
This outfit has been used to good
advantage in interior works on large
buildings, as well as out of doors.

STATE TILEWORKS PASSES TO PRIVATE FIRM
New South Wales Government Relieved of Financial Burden
£800,000 INVESTED IN SORRY VENTURE
Another chapter in the sorry history of the N.S.W. State Tile-
works was written recently, when the Premier, Mr. Cahill, an-
nounced that the State Government would lease the management
of the Tileworks to private enterprise.
The firm, Porter and Galbraith Ltd., tile makers, of Blacktown,
will operate the works for seven years, with the option of another
seven years.
(The State Government has in-
vested £250,000 in the tileworks and
losses on experimental production
amounts to £800,000.)
111-Starred “Project”.
The curious agreement to hand over
the tileworks to a private company
on a profit-sharing basis writes finis
to another ill-starred, ill-advised State
Government “project”.
The tilemaking venture was fore-
doomed to failure from the start, and
has resulted in the loss of about a
cool million pounds of public funds.
The McGirr Government rushed
blindly into the tilemaking field, os-
tensibly to flood the market with
huge quantities of cheap tiles.
Work of establishing the factory
began in 1948, to produce tiles by
the extrusion process. The Govern-
ment completely ignored previous ex-
perience of Australian manufacturers,
who had found this method to be
unsuitable to local conditions.
By the middle of 1950 it was found
that very considerable alterations to
the works and equipment were essen-
tial before there could be any possi-
bility of satisfactory commercial pro-
duction. To date the process of con-
version is not yet completed, and the
output of tiles is only a little more
than one-third of the original target
figure of 100,000 a week.
The original estimate of cost was
£lBO,OOO, but by 1949, when the
works were in operation, it had been
increased to £297,000. Now, includ-
ing the amount of £230,000 lost on
experimental production, no less than
£BOO,OOO has been invested in the
greatest white elephant the State has
ever known.
Terms of Agreement.
Introducing the second reading of
State Tileworks (Amendment) Bill,
the Minister for Public Works, Mr.
Renshaw, said the Bill empowered the
Government to make the agreement
with Porter and Galbraith Ltd.
He said that the agreement includ-
ed:
• The Government will provide the
works; Porter and Galbraith Ltd. will
undertake the management and pro-
vide technical staff free of cost to the
Government.
• Working capital will be provided
by Porter and Galbraith and the com-
pany would bear any losses.
• Profits will be divided equally
between the Government and Porter
and Galbraith after setting aside re-
newal reserve to ensure Government
assets are protected.
• Porter and Galbraith covenant
for a minimum production at the rate
of 1 million tiles in the first year, in-
creasing later to 5 million tiles, or an
equivalent production of other clay
products.
• The accounts will be open to in-
spection by the Minister and the
Auditor-General.
• The agreement will operate for
seven years, with the option of a
further seven years provided annual
production is five million tiles at the
end of the fourth year.
• Directors of the subsidiary com-
pany will be identical with the di-
rectors of Porter and Galbraith, with
the Minister having the right to nom-
mate an additional director.
• The works are to be handed over
in good order, but labour is not to
be taken over.
£BOO,OOO Invested.
Mr. Renshaw described Porter and
Galbraith Ltd. as “a very successful
organisation.”
He said the Premier. Mr. Cahill,
had made it clear that the construc-
tion of the tile works was undertaken
in view of the then housing shortage
and the excessive cost of building
brought about by shortages. Private
enterprise had shown it could not or
would not expand production of tiles
sufficiently.
Unfortunately technical difficulties
arose at the State tileworks. Not-
withstanding the adoption of the ad-
vice of some of the best available
experts, it had not been possible to
solve these problems.
Then, due to the Commonwealth
Government’s credit restriction, the
output of houses must fall consider-
ably.
Mr. Renshaw said the State Gov-
ernment had invested £BOO,OOO in-
cluding a £230,000 loss on experi-
mental production—in the tileworks.
This had been an experience com-
mon to all new plant, whether Gov-
ernment, semi-government, or private.
A Derelict.
The leader of the Opposition, Mr.
Vernon Treatt, said the purpose of
the bill was to ask private enterprise
“to deal with a derelict”.
“The bill is the end product of
grotesque mismanagement by the
Government,” he said.
If, as the Minister claimed, house
building was likely to decline, it would
be better for the Government to cut
its losses and sell the tileworks, he
added.
The debate then adjourned.
“Challenge to a Duel.”
On resumption of the debate, Mr.
K. McCaw (Lane Cove) said that un-
der the bill the Government was mak-
ing a novel arrangement: “it is hand-
ing back to private enterprise an un-
dertaking that it had intended to op-
erate as a State-owned business. The

question under debate was first raised
in the policy speech of a former
Premier, the Hon. James McGirr, on
15th April, 1947, when he said that
if the Labour Party were returned to
office it would establish a State Tile-
works. That was a challenge to a
duel, and battle has proceeded in the
intervening five and a half years. No
other measure that has been brought
into this Chamber during that time
so clearly exemplifies as this one does
the dividing line between the Govern-
ment and the Opposition, between so-
cialism on the one hand and private
enterprise on the other. Round one
of the contest took place in this
Chamber in October, 1947, when,
pursuant to the promise made in April,
the then Deputy Premier and Minis-
ter for Public Works brought down
the original Bill that became the Tile
works Act of 1947,” Mr. McCaw con-
tinued.
“When the challenge was made in
a State-owned project and to the
State Brickworks—‘will materially ac-
celerate our home-building pro-
gramme.’ Thus was issued the chal-
lenge of socialism to private enter-
prise. The platform of the Opposi-
tion depends primarily upon individ-
ual initiative and enterprise as the
dynamic force in reconstruction and
progress. When the measure came
before Parliament the Opposition
warned the Government that it would
not succeed and similar warnings
came from outside Parliament, from
men of long experience in the tile in-
dustry. Those warnings were ignor-
ed. The Opposition did then what
it now seeks to do, to defer for a
month the second reading of the
measure. The Government rejected
the Opposition’s proposal and the bill
became law. During round one of the
contest the Deputy Premier said ‘pri-
vate enterprise had been reluctant
to relinquish out-dated methods.’
That was the mode of attack.”
Continuing the debate, Mr. Me-
to the backers of the Government
that when this business was estab-
lished as a State-controlled industry
it would quickly produce 100,000 ex-
truded tiles a week at a cost of £8 a
thousand, or one-third of the market
price of the orthodox or Marseilles
in particular now being suspended as
April, 1947, the then Premier said.
Caw said: “A promise was then made
‘These projects’—referring to the one
type of tile. The present Premier
who, as Minister for Public Works,
introduced the measure, said, ‘lf this
House agrees to allow the Govern-
ment to spend £lOO,OOO it is import-
ant to remember that the outlay will
be recouped within three years by the
difference in cost.’ The promise to
the backers of the Government —the
people of the State —was that tiles
would be going off the production
line at the rate of 100,000 a week,
that the capital required would be
100,000 and that it would be repaid
by the difference in cost within a
period of three years. The first round
went to socialism. The bill was pass-
ed notwithstanding outside objection
and the attitude of the Opposition in
this House, and the effect of winning
the first round for socialism was to
detract from the fighting capacity of
its opponent, private enterprise be-
cause to the extent that men and ma-
terials then in such short supply were
taken by the socialists, private enter-
prise was less capable of producing
the tiles required by a home-hungry
community.”
“Round Two.”
“Round two of the fight took place
on 21st October, 1949, two years after
round one had been won by social-
ism, and a beautiful souvenir pro-
gramme still exists of the occasion,
bearing the name of the Premier, the
Hon. James McGirr, and the then
Minister for Public Works and pres-
ent Premier, the Hon. J. J. Cahill.
The State Tileworks were opened at
Blacktown, where extruded type tiles
were to be produced. Socialism was
weakening and the second round did
not go so well as anticipated. Be-
fore the ceremony ended the present
Premier, as Minister for Public Works,
declared that instead of costing
£lOO,OOO the establishment would cost
£300,000, but added, ‘lt is still a
good investment and the undertaking
tiles, is a saving on tiles alone. The
additional cost of using extruded tiles
is increased still further by the extra
cost of heavier roof timbers to sup-
port them. In September, 1950, so-
cialism was dealt another blow in the
Auditor-General's Report, which con'
tained an intimation that the State
Tileworks was not at that date on a
trading basis. That report revealed
also that the outlay which was in the
first instance to have been £lOO,OOO,
and two years afterwards was £300,'
000, had, in fact, become, on the
Auditor'General’s figures, £341,878.
The estimated expenditure at Sep'
tember, 1950, was to be £371,500.
Those are miserable little figures when
compared with the figures which the
Minister gave to the House last
Thursday and which are borne out
will undersell its competitors.’ By
this time two of the three years dur'
ing which it was promised that the
outlay of £lOO,OOO would have been
repaid had gone and instead of costing
£lOO,OOO it was now to cost £300,'
000.”
Costs Compared.
Rounds three and four dealt at
length with technical faults of the tile'
works. The difference in manufac-
turing costs were unfavourably com-
pared to private enterprise tiles. Mr.
McCaw went on:
“The saving of £6/0/3 by the use
of Marseilles tiles as against extruded
by the Auditor-General’s latest Re-
port, but how fantastic they seem
when they are compared with the
promises of the socialist spokesmen in
October, 1947! By September,
1950, the ‘outdated’ methods of pri-
vate enterprise were being re-intro-
duced in this socialist industry. The
promise of 1947 had not been kept,
and the attack on private industry had
been shown to be unjustified.”

October 24, 1952.


“Round Five.”
“In round 5, which took place in
1951, we find the Auditor-General
reporting:
“‘For the financial year 1950-51
the value of sales was £25,990 as
against £4,505 in 1949-50, but the
greater part of this related to texture
bricks and earthenware pipes.’
“I do not criticise the Government
for having produced those very neces-
sary building materials. However, I
am concerned with the achievements
of this socialist industry, which set
out to produce tiles in competition
with private industry. I read further
from the Auditor-General’s Report
of that year:
“ ‘So far the undertaking has not
been placed on a trading basis.’
“He added that the cost to that
date ha'd been £460,543, and that the
total cost, including tile production
losses, was estimated to be £660,000.
The Government was at last begin-
ning to realise what it would have to
pay for its folly. Thus, in round 5,
socialism was clearly weakening, but
had not yet given up the fight, or
even admitted that its tactics were un-
sound. In the light of the Auditor-
General’s estimate that the total cost
would be £660,000, one may be par-
doned for recalling that on 14th Sep-
tember, 1950, the then Minister for
Public Works, the present Premier,
used almost strong language in de-
scribing those who claimed that this
enterprise would cost the State
£500,000. ‘lt is nowhere near
£500,000,’ he said.”
“Round Six.”
“In round 6 the fight returns to
the place where it began. The sur-
render of socialism has taken place
and the referee —the Parliament of
New South Wales —has announced
the result. Despite the fact that the
victory for free enterprise is apparent
to all, it will not be amiss if I give
details of the point score. The Gov-
ernment has now entered into an
arrangement for a lease, an agency
agreement or a partnership with pri-
vate enterprise for the conduct of the
State Tileworks. This, despite the fact
that the ‘failure’ of private enterprise
was cited as the main reason for the
introduction of the socialist measure
of 1947. The Minister in his second-
reading speech told us quite frankly
that the State Tileworks had cost the
people of New South Wales £BOO,OOO.
The Auditor-General, in the report
which reached hon. members to-day,
makes it quite clear that that esti-
mate is accurate. He says:
“ ‘Additional expenditure since the
close of the year increased the outlay
of £7/53,047 at 31st August, 1952,
while a further £61,607 for commit-
ments had then to be taken into ac-
count. Allowing for stocks on hand
and other items of set-off, the net cost
of the venture to that date might be
regarded as in the vicinity of
£800,000.’
“In round six it is worth consider-
ing that figure in the light of the
promise that the people of New South
Wales would be recouped to the ex-
tent of £lOO,OOO in three years by
receiving the benefit of the difference
in costs. The expenditure of £BOO,OOO
in the short, unhappy life of this so-
cialist enterprise represents an outlay
of £160,000 per annum, or more than
£3,000 a week. For a government
that claims it is being starved of fi-
nance, that is surely profligate spend-
ing.”
Tiles £26/5/0 a Thousand.
Mr. McCaw said that the actual
price of tiles was £26/5/0 a thousand,
instead of £8 a thousand, as had been
promised,
“More government tiles were need-
ed on the same roof area than was the
case with tiles produced by the ‘out-
dated’ methods of private enterprise
Further, the promise that the produc-
tion of the State Tileworks would
materially accelerate the home-build
ing programme rings very strangely ir
the ears of those who know what has
actually happened in the housing
field of this State. The Premier ha;
said that seventy roofs have been cov
ered with government tiles. Despite
the injury done to private enterprise
by the establishment of this ‘wonder
ful’ industry when labour, materials
and plant were scarce, private enter
prise was able, in the three years thal
followed, to increase its production b\
25 per cent, above the pre-war level.’
“Results Short of Expectations.”
“The current Auditor-General’s Re
port states further:
“ ‘By far the greater part of tile
production has not proved of first
class quality. So far, results of arti
ficial drying processes have fallen con
siderably short of expectations anc
losses of the order of 50 per cent, are
occurring in the course of drying
handling and burning.’
“Plainly, only a small volume ol
saleable output resulted. The Auditor
General points out further that the
services of the consultant to whom
£6,500 was paid for advising the Gov
ernment on the original designs—
which later had to be amended —anc
for superintending constructiona.
work at Blacktown and imparting ‘in-
struction’ in the use of these new pro
cesses, were dispensed with in June
1950. Soon after, Mr. Langer left
the works the officers of the Com-
monwealth Scientific and Industria
Research Organisation were asked tc
conduct an investigation. They re-
commended a reorganisation that ha;
resulted in a vastly greater amount ol
expenditure. The C.5.1.R.0. had
been in existence for eight or nine
years before June, 1951, and one
wonders why it was not consulted
earlier. The Hon. Member for Rand-
wick has told us that the bill before
us has resulted from an approach tc
the Government by Porter and Gal-
braith Ltd.”
Mr. McCaw concluded his speech
by saying that the question the public
will now be asking is: “Was anv
other approach made by or to the
Government and are any better terms
available than those of Porter and
Galbraith Ltd.”
Bill Passed.
The Bill passed through all stages
without amendment in the Legislative
Assembly.
THE OLD AND THE NEW.
This South American home seems to incorpor-
ate features that are both old and new. The
severe lines of the portico seem rather at
variance with the grace of the louvred shutters
to the windows, which, whilst providing a
measure of security and privacy at nightfall,
are such a boon to exclude the fierce glare
of the summer sun, a feature that appears
to be overlooked in “modern” work in
which the eaveless walls are all of glass.
The grille to the windows seen below and
which consists of a pattern in circles, combines
charm with safety.

bow truss laminated arches, fabricated
in the Netherlands by N. V. Nemaho-
Holland.
These arches, which arrived by sea
recently, have now been erected, and
are the first of their type to be im-
ported and erected in Australia (see
illustration, opposite page).
This section of the job was un-
usual, Mr. Hanna explained, as the
building was designed before the
trusses were made.
The working drawings and calcula
dons were supplied to the makers, N.
V. Neman©—Holland, by its Austra-

finger, a Dutch architect.
So perfect were the calculations
that everything fitted without hitch,
drilled holes lined up with bolts, face
plates slipped into place with ease.
With a team of five men, includin'’'
one crane driver, the trusses for both
the canteen and amenities buildings
were erected in one day.
Mr. Hanna expressed himself as
delighted with the perfect finish of the
laminated trusses. He said:
“This is far better work than we
have seen in Australia.
Australian building materials arc
finis hed in a slipshod manner, and it
is a pleasure to see something like
this finished properly.
“In these trusses the joins appear
to be part of the grain, and no detail
has been overlooked.
“Not one arch caused us an-
trouble. Made of Swedish firwood.
they are each treated with Xylanmon
to resist white ants and borer,” Mr.
Hanna said.
“By and large, I think these lam-
inated arches are an answer to many
problems in all types of construction,
and the Dutch firm has made a great
job of their first Australian order.
“I am satisfied they will receive
many more of all kinds,” Mr. Hanna
added.
nounced and said that Australia must
fight to preserve industry from controls
of any kind which were all too prone
to be imposed.
He issued a warning on costs and
said that man-hour production must
increase; he believed that there was
a tendency towards this as the result of
the present conditions but it must be
accelerated for if not the standard of
living must fall. Management must
also become more efficient. There
must also be more encouragement for
investment in building and many of
the iniquitous features of rent control
eliminated to bring this about.
He congratulated the Association
for coming together on a Federal basis
and thus tackling their problems at a
national level. The development of
the industry was strikingly emphasised
by the fact that in 1938-39, 7,500,000
sq. yds. of fibrous plaster was produced
whereas by 1951-52 this figure had in-
creased to 14,500,000 sq. yds.
An amendment moved by Mr.
Murray Robson (Lib., Vaucluse) to
have the actual agreement brought
before both Houses of Parliament was
defeated by 41 votes to 37.
Mr. Robson said the purpose of
his amendment was to ensure the pro-
tection of State assets.
“Fantastic Provision.”
He said the bill contained a “fan-
tastic provision” under which the Min-
ister for Public Works could enter in-
to an arrangement with a company
by which the Crown would actually be
paying its agent for salvaging this
miserable asset.”

The shortage to relieve.

(Ah, happy, crazy dream!)
For Sydney’s hungry, gaping roofs.
In never-ending stream.
With great ado, he “bravely” launched
His Tileworks to make tiles;
Result you know, was fiasco —
Production failed by miles!
Gone is the dream, the money, too.
Now mention greatly riles
The powers-that-be, who couldn’t see
The crash of State-made tiles!
Of all the sorry State projects,
This one is well the worst;
Eight - hundred - thousand down the

Just foredoomed from the first.
Foredoomed to failure like the rest,
This lesson they should learn—
That tiles are known, when “hot”

To fingers badly burn.
It seems to us, who fin’ly pay.
The Gov’ment should take care;
Lest it will smartly be accused.
That tiles are “loose” somewhere.

M.P.’s Appeal to Parliament.

An eloquent appeal for a national

Housing Agreement.
In pointing out that his housing
scheme was financially workable, Mr.
Cramer said that the Government
should start by creating a national
housing fund, which would be segre'
gated fro mall other forms of national
finance, and which would be water'
tight and sacrosanct from any finaiv
dal manipulation.
“The home ownership scheme can
be accomplished by the provision of
cheap money, which is the core of
home ownership.” Mr. Cramer said.

Agreement Detrimental.
Mr . Cramer said that the Common'
wea lth'State housing agreement was
detrimental to home ownership and
wa « building up a tenancy commun-
ity.
The Agreement frustrated private
enterprise from providing more homes,
which could have been provided with
the same physical resources which are
used under it.
Milson’s Point Flats.
Speaking: of the State Flats under
construction at Milson’s Point, Mr.
Cramer said that the New South
Wales Government was engaged in a
-‘'desperate’ ’endeavour to make North
Sydney a safe Labour Seat by build'
ing there a block of about 320 flats
to accommodate some 1000 people,
and costing £1,250,000.
He said political patronage was tak'
ing place. It had taken place in his
electorate, where his brother’s land,
on which a home had been built, had
been resumed six years ago and not
paid for yet.
The home had been let to Mr.
Jackie Ferguson, a big man in the
Labour Party. He was a tenant there,
despite the money he was now getting.
The amendment moved by the
Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr.
A. A. Caldwell, that the bill be with'
drawn and redrafted was defeated on
a party division by 48 votes to 35.
The bill was passed through all re'
maining stages on the voices.

ryPICAL APPLICATIONS
A colourful glazed Ceramic facing unit of a size in harmony with
modern design trends, 10" x 10" x I" Ceramic Wall Tile is easy to
apply to exterior and interior wall surfaces and partitions of brick,
concrete or stone, as well as to walls and floors of swimming pools!
It is surprisingly economical in initial cost-and requires virtually no
maintenance. Ceramic Wall Tile is particularly adaptable for use
where flat unbroken surfaces predominate. It is suggested for
commercial, industrial and public buildings—shops, hotels, theatres,
factories, store rooms, food processing plants, workrooms, canteens.'
shower and toilet rooms, schools, power stations, hospitals, etc.

Australian Institute of Builders
INAUGURAL MEETING OF N.S.W. CHAPTER.
Address by Mr. Cobden Parkes.
The New South Wales Chapter of
the Australian Institute of Builders
held its inaugural meeting at Science
House, Sydney, on September 29th.
This first meeting was the result of
many months of planning and or'
ganisation on the part of the Chapter
Committee.
With its nationwide structure taking
shape, the Australian Institute of
Builders is rapidly becoming an impor'
tant influence in Commonwealth build'
ing industry affairs.
The Chapter President, Mr. C. F.
Gage, F.A.1.8., presided, and he was
supported by the Vice'President, Mr.
A. W. Edwards, F.A.1.8.
The Federal President, Mr. Fred
Wilson, 0.8. E., F.A.1.8 , was also
present. He was accompanied by the
Federal Secretary, Mr. Murray Gosper.
The inaugural address was given by
the President of the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects, Mr. Cobden
Parkes, who chose for his subject the
“History of Academies, Societies, As'
sociations and Institutes; their evolii'
tion and importance.”
Prior to the address, the Chapter
President, Mr. Gage, warmly welcomed
Mr. Cobden Parkes.
“I have known our distinguished
guest'speaker for over 30 years,” Mr.
Gage said.
“I have always found him willing
to help and to give advice. He is a
good friend to have.
“I am very pleased to welcome Mr.
Parkes to the Chapter, and I am sure
his address will be of utmost interest
to us all,” Mr. Gage added.
Importance of Institutes.
Mr. Cobden Parkes said he was in'
deed privileped to be invited to ad'
dress Chapter members at their in'
augural meeting.
“The occasion is a very important
one, and I have given the subject of
my address considerable thought,” Mr.
Parkes said.
“I have sought the definition of the
word ‘lnstitute’ as the basis of my ad'
dress, as few people can see the dif'
ference between an Academy, a
Society, Association, or Institute.
“There are many Builders’ Associa-
tions in Sydney, of which the Master
Builders’ Association of N.S.W. is the
parent body.
“Prom it, through the years, many
suburban bodies have sprung,” Mr.
Parkes continued.
Housing Project at Helsinki
There is an unusual and rather haphazard accidental aftect about the layout of this housing project at Helsoinki, Finland, of which we see an
aerial perspective (top) (with very wiggly trees) and detail layout plans below. It looks as though the architect in designing this terrace was
determined to get as far away from “the street called straight” as possible. Whether this kind of terrace will be as purposeful as the straight
terrace house has yet to be proved. It would have one disadvantage and that is the distance to be negotiated in approaching the entrance.
It will be noted that the block is nowhere more than two rooms deen, stairwells being reversed from one side to the other as the block
bends around.

“The work they do, individually and
J jointly, is of utmost importance,” he
added.
The speaker then defined the mean'
ing of an Institute, and compared it
with the constitution and work of
Academies, Societies, and Associations.
He described in interesting detail
the important part these bodies had
played in the social structure of the
past, and their present'day importance.
Mr. Parkes explained the objects of
various societies, in the fields of litera'
ture, science, and art, and the great
benefits they brought to the public.
Addresses Gathering.
“Institutes are devoted to raising
standards by increasing the efficieicy of
‘ their members.
“Consequently, I felt it wise to seek
some historical background to the sub'
ject.
“My researches have proved par'
i ticularly interesting,” he added.
Guilds.
1 Mr. Parkes pointed out that the
English have always been “group'
minded,” and he recalled an invitation
| to the Fishmongers’ Guild, only one
of many guilds famous in English his'
tory.”
In interesting manner, the speaker
described the origin of the Guilds
movement, and how they promoted
matters of mutual interest among the
inhabitants of districts
“The early Guilds had some sent'
blance to present'day Friendly Societies
and were concerned with the advance'
ment of common interests of mem-
bers,” he said.
Mr. Parkes discussed the growth of
Merchant and Craft Guilds, “many of
which still exist in name only.”
He stressed the importance of
present'day Institutes in the life of the
community, and referred to the 20
Institutes in N.S.W.. their work and
influence in their various spheres.
Institutes give back to members
some of the advantages they have
gained from them.
There is no betert way of helping
others than by service to our fellows
through our Institutes,” Mr. Parkes
said.
Advantages to Public.
In the case of the Australian Insti'
tute of Builders, it would gain untold
advantages for all by advocating better
building laws and higher standards of
building, to the ultimate advantage of
the community.
The high ideals of the Institute
are worthy of the leaders of the build'
ing industry.
It is a high calling to encourage
the study of building and kindred mat'
ters, Mr. Parkes continued.
Your objects will gain for you the
confidence of the public and the ap'
probation of the nation, and your work
will prove of lasting benefit to the com'
munity.
“I congratulate you on your first
meeting and wish the Chapter well.
The Institute is for all members,
and its value to the community is
exactly what they make it,” Mr. Cob'
den Parkes concluded.
Vote of Thanks.
Proposing a vote of thanks to Mr.
Cobden Parkes, the Institute’s Federal
President, Mr. Fred Wilson, paid a
tribute to “a colleague of many years
standing.”
Mr. Wilson said he was delighted
with the progress of the Institute since
its inception, and its value would be
enhanced as the result of Mr. Parkes’
address.
“His researches must have been
enormous, and the address was tre-
mendously interesting to us all.
“We are delighted to have Mr.
Parkes with us, and he has inspired
members of the Institute to continue
their work.
“We are handing on a legacy to the
rising generation of builders to nur
ture. and to develop into something
of great benefit to the community,”
Mr. Wilson added.
He said arrangements would be
made to reproduce and circulate copies
of Mr. Cobden Parkes’ excellent ad'
dress to all members.

Why worry about the tile shortage? This is a roofing

MASTER BUILDERS’ FEDERATION OF AUSTRALIA
REPORTS OF AFFILIATED ASSOCIATIONS.
(continued from last issue)
The Master Builders'
Association of New
South Wales
It gives me great pleasure to pre'
sent this report on behalf of the
Master Builders’ Association of New
South Wales, and to extend greetings
to all present at this Convention. I
trust the proceedings will result in
benefit to the Industry, and that the
friendly and cooperative spirit which
has prevailed during the past twelve
months will continue.
This report covers matters which it
is felt will be of value to the Feder'
ation.
New South Wales Building Survey.
During the 1951/52 period, a re'
cord number of new buildings were
completed in New South Wales. In
the Sydney metropolitan area, the only
district where accurate figures are
available, 22% more buildings were
erected than in the previous 12
months; 15,205 new buildings being
completed at a cost of £41,762,928,
compared with 14,500 at a cost of
£34,166,648. The total number of
employees engaged in the industry was
45,564.
It is interesting to note that in the
housing field 20,379 houses were com'
pleted in New South Wales, 16,252
of these were built by private enter'
prise and only 4,127 by Government
instrumentalities.
The Federal Government's credit re<
strictions are taking effect rapidly and
the present trend shows a sharp de'
dine. However, as these restrictions
appear to be a genuine attempt to ar'
rest Australia’s inflationary spiral, it
is hoped that, though conditions may
be more difficult, they will not ser'
iously discourage earnest endeavour’
or curtail the operations of the Build'
ing Industry more than is necessary.
Membership.
During the current year, member'
ship in the Association increased by
4 3 -md a drive is being made to
further strengthen the number. We
have a direct membership of 543, and
an affiliated membership of 1,273; the
New South Wales Association being
the largest of the Master Builders’
Associations in the Commonwealth.
Registration of Builders,
We have been informed that Cab'
inet has decided to enact the long
sought Bill to provide for Registration
of Builders in New South Wales, and
negotiations are continuing with the
Minister for Local Government. At
present the Government is more in'
terested in protecting the home pur'
chaser, rather than establishing a
standard of competency, and strong
representations have been made in
this direction. The proposed law
would require all builders, and per'
sons handling work to the value of
£l,OOO or more, to register and pro'
vide a fidelity bond.
Industrial.
The year has been a very heavy
one from an Industrial point of view,
the most important item being the
Building Trades Review by the Full
Bench of the Industrial Commission
of New South Wales. This enquiry
dealt with all State Building Trades
Awards. The enquiry was completed
in November last, when a set of
standard conditions was laid down,
which removed a considerable number
of difficulties. The Court awarded in'
creased margins to all Trades, the
highest being that of 9A to Carpent'
ers.
A formula was also included,
whereby the various components to
the wage rate, such as sick leave, etc.,
are automatically adjusted to accord
with the rise or fall of the basic
wage.
Present rates are:
Per hour
Bricklayers 8 1
Carpenters and Joiners .... 8 3
Painters 7 10
Plasterers 7 11 2/5
Plumbers 8 0 3/5
Builders’ Labourers:
Ordinary 7 2F
Skilled 7 5
Conciliation proved to be a satis'
factory method of dealing with dis'
putes in cases connected with the ma'
jority of the Unions, the main ex'
ception being the Building Workers
Industrial Union, which has subse'
quently been refused registration by
the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.
(The 8.W.1.U. is still registered in
New South Wales.) This Union was
responsible for a considerable loss of
man'hours due to its participation in
unnecessary stoppages of work over
minor industrial differences. It is
significant to note that the majority
of stoppages occurred on works being
carried out on behalf of Government
instrumentalities. However, the As'
sociation’s alertness in referring all
these matters to the Court has con'
siderably lessened the trouble in the
last six months.
The Commonwealth Apprenticeship
enquiry was attended by representa-
tives of the Association, who express'
ed the opinion that it was an urgent
necessity that something be done to
encourage Apprentices to enter the
Industry. A scheme was presented
for training Adult Apprentices, in or'
der to overcome the shortage of skill'
ed tradesmen. In New South Wales
there is no difficulty in obtaining Ap'
prentices for Carpentry, but the Brick'
laying. Plastering and Plumbing
Trades do not attract the boys. It
was also suggested that a system of
Pre'Apprenticeship Training be re'
introduced at Secondary Schools, and
that consideration be given to the
need for subsidised post'school train'
mg, particularly in the Bricklaying,
Plastering and Plumbing Trades.
The enquiry is not yet completed
and the results are eagerly awaited.
The introduction by the New South
Wales Government of provision for
Long Service Leave in all State
Awards, has caused considerable diffi'
culties to arise. At present all em-
ployees who have served a period of
29 years with the one employer are
eligible for 3 months’ leave with pay.
After 10 years, in certain circum'
stances, proportionate payment in lieu
of leave, is provided.
When the Act was originally intro'
duced, test cases were taken before
the Full Bench of the Industrial Com'
mission of New South Wales. The
Court’s judgment was not satisfactory
to the Unions in some respects, and
without any impartial hearing, and
without taking into account the fact
that the judgment was not satisfact'
ory in some respects to the employ'
ers, the State Parliament passed

further amendments which were sub-
mitted late in March, 1952, to the
Legislative Assembly and were rushed
through before recess. Unfortunate-
ly, this Legislation has created a sim-
ilar position as that which arose in
connection with the 40-hour week,
and it is hoped that the Common-
wealth Arbitration Court will not be
unduly influenced by what has been
awarded by Legislation when it deals
with Long Service Leave on a Fed-
eral basis.
Since my last report the basic wage
has increased to an alarming degree,
now being £ll/15/0 in New South
Wales. This has constituted a severe
impact to Industry, and how long such
a state of affairs will be allowed to
continue is a matter for conjecture,
but it is heartening to note that ap-
plications for a review have been filed
in the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court.
Building Materials and Controls.
On 24th June, 1952, the Building
Operations and Building Materials
Act was relaxed to exempt all build-
ing operations from control. Al-
though the Act has not been repeal-
ed, the only materials now subject
to restricted use are galvanised iron,
water and gas piping and terracotta
tiles. Demolition work cannot be
carried out without permission.
During the year production of
building materials reached a record
high level, and I am of the opinion
that the time has come for the re-
moval of all controls on the Industry,
in order to allow private enterprise
to function effectively and proceed
with its main job of building.
Prices Barometer.
The compilation of a Prices Barom-
eter, which has engaged the attention
of the Association for some consider-
able time, reached a satisfactory con-
clusion, and in February of this year
arrangements were made with the pub-
lishers of -'Construction” to publish
a monthly Barometer of Prices in sup-
plement form. This has provided
invaluable service to members and I
extend my sincere appreciation to
Mrs. Florence Taylor, the Editor and
Proprietor of that publication, for
her generous co-operation.
Conclusion.
A notable absentee from this Con-
vention is Mr. L. G. Smith, who
passed away on 2nd May, 1952. Les.
Smith had been connected with the
Master Builders’ Association of New
South Wales since 1926, in the cap-
acity of Organiser and Industrial Of-
ficer, Assistant Secretary, and for the
past 5 years as Secretary. His death
came as a great shock to all members
of the Association and affiliated organ-
isations.
C. E. THOMPSON.

Master Builders'
Association of N.S.W.
Newcastle Branch
I have pleasure in presenting this
Annual Report of the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W. Newcastle
Branch, to the Annual Conference of
the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia at Perth, Western Australia,
in September, 1-952, and in doing so
I bring best wishes from the Members
of the Newcastle Association.
Membership.
The number of members on the
Register at the present is as follows:
Association Members 92
Sub-contractors 25
Country Association Members 19
Exchange Members 36
Country Exchange Members 1
Honorary Members 3
Life Members 2
178
This represents an increase of 7
members on that shown in our report
of last year.
Industrial—State of Trade.
In addition to the usual twelve
months’ figures showing the value of
new buildings and alterations for
which permits were sought from the
Newcastle City Council we now in-
clude figures applicable to the Lake
Macquarie Shire Council and Port
Stephens Shire as in both of these
Shires a great deal of work is done
by members of the Newcastle Asso-
ciation. To these figures we have
added estimates of the work done for
those authorities from which permis-
sions were not required, and which
we now set out as follows:
In our report to the Convention
last year we referred to certain trade
conditions which could lead to a reces-
sion in the Building Industry before
twelve months had expired.
It is our unhappy duty to report
that the effects of those conditions
are now being felt in the Building
Trade and a definite recession now ex-
ists. Less work is being done in the
Newcastle District, the Housing Com-
mission are not proceeding with new
projects and, in fact, have cancelled
projects already started. More men
are offering for work in the Building
trade and, of course, materials are now
readily available, in fact some indus-
tries manufacturing builders’ supplies
are now laying men off.
Although we are going through a
Building recession the anomaly exists
that costs are still going higher. In
N.S.W. the basic wage has increased
12/- per week as from the first com-
plete pay period in August, 1952, and
the basic wage now stands in N.S.W.
at £ll/15/0 for a working week of
40 hours.
Great pressure has been brought to
bear upon the Government to take
some action in alleviating these con-
ditions bv the easing of taxation and
providing incentives to produce.
Keen anticipation of some relief in
the Federal budget is anxiously await-
ed but at the time of writing this re-
port the Federal Treasurer has not yet
brought down the 1952 budget.
Existing conditions should make
both employers and employees keener
and consequently efficiency should be
exhibited. If this be the result of the
recession and the Federal Govern-
ment, by a balanced policy can di-
rect for buoyant conditions in the
future then the recession will have
not been in vain. It is the opinion
of the Newcastle Association that an
attack on the basic wage is not the
GLIMPSES AT THE FEDERATION CONVENTION.

outstanding knowledge of building problems, Mr. C. R. Hansen, a member of the big con-
structaon organisation of Hansen and Yuncken Pty. Ltd., Melbourne, will bring enery and
ability to his high position as Federation President. He told “Construction” that he was fully
conscious of his considerable responsibilities as President of the oldes t Employer Association
in Australia. A fluent speaker and man of great breadth of bision and acumen, Mr. Hansen
will, in this journal's opinion, worthily follow in the footsteps of his distinguished predecessor.

more efficient operation is the foun-
dation of cheaper prices and higher
standard of living.
Wages and Conditions.
The Association distributes from
time to time the Revised List of
Wages and Current Ready Reckoner
prepared by the parent body and the
effective rates of pay from the first
full pay period in August, 1952, are
as follows:
Quantity System.
The Quantity System which has
been in operation in Newcastle for
many years still operates and applies
over an area bounded by a radius of
15 miles from the Newcastle Post
Office.
In view of the quantities determin-
ations by the Federal Body during the
year, the Newcastle Association will
now possibly reconsider its Quantity
Rules, which exist by agreement with
the associated Architects of Newcastle
and District.
Registration of Builders.
This subject crops up every year
and receives bursts of activity from
time to time.
The latest move is for the Sydney,
Newcastle and Wollongong Associa-
tions to join forces in a deputation to
the Honorable J. B. Renshaw, Minis-
ter for Public Works and Assistant
Minister for Local Government in
N.S.W.
This Deputation was arranged
through the Wollongong Association
and the good offices of its Member of
Parliament, Mr. Rex Connors.
Latest reports are that the State
Cabinet has agreed to Registration of
Builders in N.S.W.
Theft Signs.
In an endeavour to meet the serious
matter of theft of building materials
from members’ jobs, the Association
has approved a standard noticeboard
with yellow background for sale .to
members. It offers a reward to any
person giving information leading to
the conviction of vandals or thieves.
Newcastle members responded very
well in the purchase of these boards.
Lectures.
The Association sponsored several
lectures to its members at the General
Meetings during the year. A lecture
was delivered by Mr. J. McCausland,
Architect, of Sydney, on the subject
“Kitchen Planning,” and later a lec-
ture on “Australian Forestry and Re-
afforestation” was delivered by Mr. D.
N. Cromer, Dip. For., Officer in
Charge of Division of Forestry Sour-
ces of the Forestry and Timber Bureau
Sydney. Both lectures were well re-
ceived by members.
Relationship With Kindred
Associations.
Our relationships with the Associat-
ed Architects of Newcastle and Dis-
trict, Timber Merchants Association,
Master Painters’ Association, and
Newcastle City Council continued to
be most cordial. Any matters of
common interest are discussed when
they arise and appropriate action
taken.
Federal Building Construction
Prize Examination.
The Examination will again be con-
ducted at the Newcastle Technical
College and we are advised that six
(6) candidates will be taking the
examination.
The Newcastle Association con-
tinues to support the work of the
Newcastle Technical College and again
donated prizes to the winners o!
Stages 1 to 5 of the Carpentry and
Joinery Course.
Miscellaneous.
The Social activities of the New-
castle Association are maintained and
this year included an Annual Picnic
to Lake Munmorah, a successful
Ladies’ Crazy Card Night, and a com-
petition for the A. E. Myers Billiard
Cue Trophy. Our Electric Light
Bowls competition was not held this
year owing to lighting restrictions.
In conclusion we take this oppor-
tunity of expressing the wish that the
deliberations of delegates to this Con-
vention will be both harmonious and
successful and that important deci-
sions will be made for the good of
the building industry in Australia.

Membership and Branches.
It is pleasing to record that mem'
bership is increasing each year, par'
ticularly with country builders who
are recognising the value of the As'
sociation.
The Association Membership Com'
mittee has been functioning for sev'
eral years, thus continuing a policy
of selectivity and ensuring a high
standard of membership.
The various Branches have contin-
ued to expand their membership, and
they have been assisted in this work
by the servicing of their members
from the parent Association.
State of Trade.
One beneficial effect of the Credit
inffinn'Tf .(tThn!^J* m '
ination or the unqualified builder.
This type of operator has been one
pf the many causes of increase
building costs, by bidding for labour
and materials regardless of cost.
The elimination of this type has
had the effect of easing supplies for
the legitimate builder, thus ensuring
a more rapid completion of contracts"
In order to rehabilitate the Build-
ing Industry in a proper and sound
manner, an infusion of credit from
the private financial institutions is ne-
cessary, and we look forward to the
period when this will be available
without having to depend upon Gov-
ernment sponsored monies.
Housing has been the main source
of activity, but since April last the
lack of finance and high cost of
building have had a tendency to slow
down operations in this field.
The above position is more marked
in country towns where the popula'
tion and demand for housing is not
as great as the metropolis.
,
Commercial construction has been
limited, permits beinc required for
this type of structure. It has been
noticeable in recent months that ow-
in £ to increased costs, several pro-
' ects for which permits were granted,
have either been cancelled or consid'
erably reduced in scale.

As a result of these overseas com-
mitments, the opportunities for local
builders are diminishing, and it is con-
sidered that in the interests of those
employed in the trade that there
should be a review of future options.
However, the total volume of build-
ing work approved in the March
quarter of 1952 was 78 per cent.
greater than the corresponding pre-
war amount.
Approvals of work on dwellings,
both for the erection of new build'
ings and for alterations and additions
to existing ones, exceeded twice their
1938 volume. A greater volume of
new buildings for industrial and social
purposes was approved than in 1938,
but alterations and additions to such
building, which had approached their
pre-war volume in the latter part of
1951 f e ii to u a if t u at i eve i ; n t k e

Early in j u [ y s tate Government
partially lifted building restrictions,
which had an i mme diate effect in the
seaside zones where the trade was be-
coming depressed owing to the re-
strifions operates in those areas

At the present time with the ex-
ception of the seaside zones any type
of building up to £20,000 can be
erected without a permit, and there
is no restrictions on the type of ma-
terials which may be used,
The erection of flats has been a
major concession as Government policy
since the war has been consistently
against this type of structure. In the
seaside areas, permission must be ob-

tained for the erection of any flats,
and restrictions still apply to the erec'
tion of holiday homes.
The lifting of the above restrictions
will provide an impetus to the indus'
try, and with the increasing develop'
ment of the State, allied to the gradual
growth in population, it is considered
that the future can be viewed with a
certain amount of optimism.
Supplies.
With the exception of cement, sup'
plies which are locally produced have
shown a marked improvement over
the past few months.
The supply of cement is being aug'
mented by a quota system of imported
cement, but as the demands of the
whole State have to be met by this
industry, it will be some considerable
time before any appreciable improve'
ment is evidenced.
Common bricks are stated to be
available but there is still a waiting
period of six months for face bricks.
Builders’ hardware is a scarce com-
modity, whilst steel is still as difficult
to obtain as previously.
Conference and Agreements
With Architects.
The Association has conferred with
the Local Chapter of Architects on
several occasions since the last Con'
vention, and the following agreements
have been adopted as standard prac'
tice.
Bills of Quantity, provision of
quantities for all works exceeding
£lO,OOO exclusive of private residem
ces, for which provision shall be op'
tional. Further provided, that where
two tenders only are invited, the fur'
nishing of quantities shall be option'
al on the part of the Architect.
Also agreed that in certain fobs
under this amount, if it was consid'
ered that quantities were required,
they would be recommended.
Re Clause in Specification “To Fu-
ture Detail.” Architects’ Association
prepared to advise members of the use
of the term “To Future Detail,” and
recommend the issue of sheets of de'
tails or an adequate description in the
specifications.
Guaranteeing of Levels. Architects
agreed to inform their members of
the desirability of having reasonable
and accurate levels on drawings.
Surcharge to Cover Extra Over-
head re Rise and Fall Clause. Agree'
ment on a 5% surcharge to offset
additional overhead caused through
the Rise and Fall Clause.
No agreement could be obtained
on sealed Bills of Quantity, but as
this matter has now been successfully
negotiated between both Federal As-
sociations, it is only a matter of time
when it becomes standard practice.

Percentage Formula Rise and
Fall Clause.
The Association per medium of a
sub-committee has given consideration
to the production of a formula which
would provide for a percentage ad-
justment of the Rise and Fall Clause.
Several schemes were investigated
including the example submitted by
the Federation Executive, and in ad-
dition, reports were obtained from
the Quantity Surveyors and a Cost-
Accountant.
At the time that a formula was
decided upon, a change of circum-
stances occurred in the industry, and
it was considered advisable to defer
the matter pending discussions on the
same subject to the present Conven-
tion.
The War Service Homes Depart-
ment submitted a formula which was
not acceptable to our members.
We desire the views of the Victor-
ian and New South Wales Associa-
tions on this formula, ao were in-
formed that it had been adopted by
them and was working satisfactorily.
Legislation.
The Scaffolding Act was amended
by bringing all types of structure
within the ambit of the Act, and leg-
islating for greater safety measures.
Industrial.
The industry has been free from
serious industrial disputes and with
the exception of Basic Wage increases
there have been no major changes
in wage rates.
Apprenticeship.
The Association has continued to
give practical co-operation to the
scheme, by indenturing apprentices to
the Association, and encouraging
members to employ their full quota,
thus ensuring a steady supply of fu-
ture tradesmen.
There has not been any lack of ap-
plications for apprenticeship to the
Carpentry trade, but other trades such
as Plastering are experiencing diffi-
culty in attracting boys.
At the present time, the Appren-
ticeship Committee in this State has
a claim from the Unions seeking sub-
stantial increases in the wage rates
of apprentices.
A similar claim as evidence was
placed by the unions before the Ap-
prenticeship Commission, which is at
present enquiring into Apprenticeship
matters throughout the Common-
wealth.
As the Commission was constituted
by the Commonwealth Government
and supported by the States, it is
considered that there should not be
any alteration to basic rates and con-
ditions until the findings of the Com-
mission are determined.
Conclusion.
The Association is gratified with
the work which has been accomplish-
ed by the Federation Executive, and
trusts that it will continue to approach
problems of National importance and
which affect all States.
During the present year the indus-
try has gone through a transition per-
iod, and taking a long view, it should
prove beneficial both to the industry
and its clients.
We feel that persistence with our
policy of publicity to sustain the con-
fidence of the people in the integrity
of the Nation and our industry will
bring its share of rewards.
In conclusion, Mr. President, I of-
fer to you sincere wishes from the
Queensland Association for a success-
ful conference, and trust that consid-
erable benefits will accrue from the
discussions.
T. PHILP,
President.
THE MASTER BUILDERS’
ASSOCIATION OF
VICTORIA.
In the absence abroad of Mr. T.
W. Morris, I am Acting President
and it gives me great pleasure to pre-
sent this report on behalf of my As-
sociation and its affiliates at Geelong,
Ballarat and Bendigo.
Obituary.
During the past year our Associa-
tion has lost four esteemed members:
Messrs. H. Bailey, Frank Horsfall,
Alex. M. Younger, and Roy F. Shill-
abeer.
Membership,
As at 31st July, 1952, our mem-
bership figures were:
Association Members .... 397
Provisional Members .... 127
524
Exchange Members 142
Applications for membership are
being closely screened to assure that
only those of merit and integrity are
admitted. Recent alterations to our
Articles of Association and By-Laws
following recommendations of a spec-
ial sub-committee were designed to
remove loopholes in this regard.
Industrial and Trade Conditions
Recession.
The change which was forecast in
our last review has taken place during
this year. Financial restrictions im-
posed by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment led to a serious deterioration in
building demands. Many industrial
and commercial organisations requir-
ing buildings found it impossible to
finance their projects, whilst many
home seekers found that lending
authorities were not able to make
available loans required to meet build-
ing costs. This has affected all mem-
bers from the biggest to the smallest.
On the other hand some immediate
benefits to the industry have come
through the easing of the labour po-
sition and the greater availability of
materials, which were in short supply.
There is also some evidence that in-
flation is being curbed, although not
sufficient to warrant undue optimism
in this regard.
When it was evident that a reces-
sion was beginning the Association
President and Secretary had discus-
sions with the Senior Banking Execu-
tive of Victoria on a confidential level
and it was ascertained that although
the Trading Banks realised that finan-
cial stringency must be experienced
for a period up to twelve months, it
was not anticipated that a more ser-
ious decline would occur. The rep-
resentations made by the Association
were effective in that they gave the

RECTANGLES AND SLOPES.
Simple geometric forms appear to dictate the shape of the buildings of today. Above we see
the Administrative Building of the new Research Centre recently completed at New Brunswick,
New Jersey, U.S.A. for Johnson & Johnson. At right the strange structure with the sloping
facade is the rear of stadium built in Mexico City and which will be used for recreational pur-
poses. This Olympic Stadium, which seats 110,000, employs native materials and forms
reminisdent of ancient Aztec structure. A feature will be a Diego Rivera mural around the
entire outside wall.

Trading Banks a good insight into
the difficulties confronting members
and at the same time allowed the
Banks to properly assess a policy which
might otherwise have been too re-
strictive for the industry generally.
The import restrictions further ac'
centuated the financial restrictions but
again our representations were favour-
ably considered. Certain items, par-
ticularly cement, were taken out of
their original prohibited category and
were placed in the administrative sec-
tion, thus allowing the proper de-
mands of industry to be met by im-
ports from abroad. The Association
obtained its own permit for a substan-
tial tonnage of cement thus assuring
that jobs would not be left high and
dry through the inability of local
sources to meet demands.
The serious curtailment, restriction
or cancellation of defence works and
public buildings such as hospitals and
major works for the State Electricity
Commission has served to prove how
dependent the industry has become on
these Governmental bodies for major
constructional contracts. It is safe to
say that the building recession in
Victoria is mainly due to the inability
of these Governmental bodies to main-
tain their existent commitments and
proceed with projected works. Had
there been a substantial volume of ma-
jor industrial construction in hand
from outside sources, the impact of
recession would have been less; but,
as we all know. Government policy
has restricted private industrial and
commercial building to an absurd de'
gree since the war, and although per'
mits for such works have recently been
obtained more freely the fact that con'
trols were still in existence prevented
many industrial and commercial pro'
jects from being planned, financed or
proceeded with. There was too much
uncertainty about it all.
If proof were needed of the great
fall off in demand for housing, figures
hereunder provide the answer. They
also show that despite the housing
fall off, applications for other new
building works have not increased;
but significantly, and addi-
tions —small repair works have
grown steadily since early 1950.
Building Controls—Abolition
Sought—Abolished sth August.
Efforts were made on many occa'
sions during the year to persuade the
Victorian Government to abolish con'
trols. The Association was warmly
supported by other bodies particularly
the Royal Victorian Institute of Ar-
chitects and Building Industry Con'
gress. Members of Parliament at'
tacked the Government on its policy
in retaining controls; and through
combined effort restrictions were great'
ly relaxed to the benefit of the indus'
try; but it was obvious that for uh
terior purposes some political groups
desired and retention of building con'
trols and only a determined fight
brought about their removal, alas, sev'
eral months too late to preserve any
semblance of balance.

Opposition to Housing Bill.
Determined opposition was organ' 1
ised and shown to the proposed enact'
ment of “A Bill to Amend the Hous'
ing Acts” which would not only have
given greatly extended powers to the
Victorian Housing Commission but
would also have provided a socialistic
weapon for any Government so mind'
ed to strike at our free enterprise
building system.
The Liberal Country Party manag'
cd to stave off the enactment by its
uncompromising attack in the Legis'
lative Council led by the Hon. A. G.
Warner.
Amendment to Transfer of Land Act:
As the result of strong representa'
tions made by the Association to the
Attorney General, the Transfer of
Land (Forgeries) Act was amended
to protect those people who, having
taken all proper legal precautions, sub'
sequently find that they are victims be'
cause of forged documents. The
matter arose through the unfortunate
experience of an Association mem'
ber.
Maintenance of Quantities
Agreement and Conditions.
It was evident during the year that
some architects and Government in'
strumentalities were seeking to avoid
the provision of Bills of Quantities
which are required in terms of the
agreement existing between the R.V.
LA. and the Association. With the
cooperation of the R.V.I.A. the
agreement has been maintained.
Following the discussions between
the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia and the Royal Australian In'
stitute of Architects as the result of
submissions from this Association, it
has now been agreed that priced Bills
of Quantities will remain the confi'
dential documents they were always
intended to be. In future priced Bills
when lodged will be under sealed
cover to be opened only with the con-
sent of and in the presence of the
builder for a specific purpose; and
when a contract is completed the
priced Bills are to be returned to the
contractor.
Efforts to produce a Standard Mode
of Measurement have proceeded and
the Victorian Institute of Quantity
Surveyors has prepared a draft Mode.
It is hoped that through the Federa'
tion some finality in the establishment
of Australian Standard Conditions can
be reached during this coming year.
Rise and Fall Agreement.
The agreement as existing between
the RAM.A. and the Association was
renewed for a further term to the
31st January, 1953, with the proviso
that any amendments agreed to dur'
ing the term could be effected. This
proviso was made because of discus'
sions then taking place with a view to
establishing a simplified method of
computation and also a percentage to
be added to compensate for the costs
of preparing and maintaining Rise
and Fall provisions.
Following discussions on a Com'
monwealth level between the Federa'
tion and the R.A.I.A. (and I con'
gratulate the Federation on their ef'
fort), it has been agreed as a prim
ciple that compensation should be
given to cover the costs occasioned by
the Rise and Fall agreement; but it
was left to the respective States to
fix the method of compensation or
the percentage to be added and there
is no finality in Victoria yet. It is
noted that Queensland has been the
first to agree on a percentage sur'
charge of 5%.
Apprenticeship Matters.
The Association is still seriously
perturbed regarding the shortage of
apprentices in certain trades notably
bricklaying and plastering. The dearth
of bricklayer apprentices has been
mainly due to the inability of Master
Builders to employ journeymen, the
general shortage having brought
about extensive subcontracting by
tradesmen; and these subcontractors
have shown a marked reluctance to
indenture boys to the trade. If no
other means are available the Associ'
ation will indenture a selected mini'
ber of lads as it is empowered to do
under the Act. Some good may
come from the joint Commonwealth'
State Apprenticeship Inquiry which is
currently taking place under the
Chairmanship of Mr. Justice S. W.
Right, of the Commonwealth Court
of Conciliation and Arbitration. EvL
dence was prepared for this Inquiry
and submitted by the Association Sec'
retary.
Support was again given to the
special Apprenticeship Week in May
and the Association contributed to
provide prizes for the best apprentices
in the carpentering and bricklaying
trades. The Apprenticeship Commis'
sion of Victoria is to be congratulated
on its efforts to publicize and promote
apprenticeship.
The Federal Building Construction
prize should be a stimulus to apprem
tices generally; and it is hoped that
this year there will be many entries
from Victoria for the competition.
My Association has views on this
competition which it will advance at
the Convention.
Co-operation With Other
Organisations.
There has been a marked spirit of
co'operation evident with other or'
ganisations notably the R.V.1.A.,
Chamber of Manufactures, Victorian
Employers’ Federation and kindred
trade bodies. Our representatives on
Building Industry Congress have done
valuable work and Congress itself is
to be congratulated on the success of
its efforts in having extensive amend'
ments made to uniform building reg'
ulations.
Association Insurance Scheme.
Our arrangements with Federation
Insurance Limited have proved most
successful and the volume of business
being transacted between the com'
pany and our members has consider'
ably increased. This has resulted in
substantial savings to members and a
useful contribution to Association
funds by way of overriding commis'
sion.
Tames Wall Cup—
4th to Bth February, 1952.
The rednstitution of these games
after the many years lapse proved most
enjoyable and worthwhile. My Asso-
ciation had the pleasure of being hosts
to teams from South Australia and
New South Wales; and although
South Australia won the Cup from
us after a close tussle, the games were
played in that fine spirit of friendly
rivalry which the game of bowls de'
.mands.
It was most pleasing to see the re-
newal of old friendships and the mak'
ing of new ones. We did not overdo
the social activities and I believe the
week was thoroughly enjoyed by all
who participated.
Our late beloved King, George VI,
died during that week; and although
his passing necessitated some schedule
changes and brought a subdued note
to proceedings, the quiet pleasure of
all was made evident.
We look forward to wresting the
Cup from South Australia during the
next series of games!
Master Builders’ Federation
of Australia;
During this past year the Federa'
tion has been most active and there
is no need for me to recapitulate the
matters which have been dealt with.
But I would express the appreciation
of my Association and members for
the efforts made and success achieved.
Visit of Mr. R. O. Lloyd,
0.8. E., F. 1.0.8.
Our distinguished guest provided
much ground for stimulating thought
during the few days he was with us.
His address to approximately 200
members at the Hotel Australia on
25th March was both informative and
provocative, and those Executive
members of the Association who had
the opportunity to discuss many of
the problems common to our industry
with him found his viewpoint and sug'
gestions very helpful. As a direct re'
suit of his visit close liaison has been
established with the National Federa'

Great Britain and the Association
President, Mr. T. -W. Morris, has re-
cently taken part in the National
Convention held in Britain under the
auspices of this body.
Olympic Games Preparations.
It is pleasing to record that with
the appointment of a Chairman of
high repute and an equally competent
organising secretary the Olympic
Games Committee has rapidly pro-
ceeded with the groundwork for the
1956 Games to be held in Melbourne.
A special Constructional Sub-Commit-
tee has been appointed on which the
Association is represented by its Past-
President, Mr. C. J. McDougall. A
site has been finally chosen and an
Architectural Competition is at present
being held. The Games will necessi-
tate a great constructional effort which
I feel will be forthcoming from the
Industry.
Affiliated Associations.
The Associations at Ballarat, Ben-
digo and Geelong continue to flour-
ish and the spirit of co-operation exist-
ing between their respective bodies
and the parent Association is on the
highest level. During the year num-
erous visits have been paid by our
representatives to the provincial cen-
tres and by officers of the affiliated
Association to Melbourne. My As-
sociation provides full industrial ser-
vice for the affiliated bodies.
“The Australian Builder.”
The Association journal has. in a
period of three years, gone from
forty-eight pages to seventy-two pages
with a supplement which is proving
invaluable to builders, architects. Gov-
ernment Departments and industry
generally.
The supplement contains official
wage rates, award summary and al-
lowances for all trades and apprentices
as well as a comprehensive and accur-
ate price list of materials as at the
fifteenth day of month of issue. All
contracting parties now seem to ac-
cept the supplement as an official
document for their contractural ad-
justments, thus obviating disputes and
administrational difficulties.
Wages and Awards.
Relevant rates of pay and loaded
labour costs are as shown in “The
Australian Builder Supplement” at-
tached as an appendix.
Building Statistics.
An appendix is attached.
Association Premises Completed.
During this year the rebuilding
work on the Association premises has
been completed and the official open-
ing took place on Friday, 27th June,
following a general meeting of mem-
bers in the presence of approximately
250 Association and Exchange Mem-
bers and visitors representing Mel-
bourne City Council, various kindred
Associations and official bodies.
The premises are undoubtedly a
credit to all those associated with the
initial thought in purchasing a pro-
perty away from the heart of the city,
the President of the R.V.1.A., Mr.
Eric Hughes, who planned the work,
and Messrs. McDougall & Ireland
Pty. Ltd., who have so capably car-
ried out the task of rebuilding.
Many of our Builder and Exchange
Members readily co-operated with sup-
plies of materials and sub-contracts.
In some cases by donation and in
others by expeditious work at reduc-
ed rates. Therefore it can be said
that the Master Builders' Association
of Victoria and Exchange has housed
itself for many years to come and
with a view to future extension of
activities in the interests of its mem-
bers and the community generally.
Conclusion.
I am happy to report that my As-
sociation has made considerable pro-
gress during the past year. Not only
have members been fully serviced but
the influence of the Association has
covered a wider ambit and I feel that
the prestige of the Association is high
and going higher.
Despite present economic difficulties
I cannot help but feel that our future
is assured and our worries only tem-
porary. The “Roman Holiday’’ is
finished, but if employers and employ-
ees are prepared to give as well as
take, our Commonwealth must ex-
pand and progress.
I feel that proposals to place the
Federation on a more active level are
to be commended. Future problems
will assume proportions outside the
confinements of State bounds, and it
is essential that machinery should be
in existence and working to copy
with them.
Much good can come out of this
1952 Convention and I believe it will.

SOUTH AUSTRALIAN BUILDERS
& CONTRACTORS’
ASSOCIATION INC.
South Australia sends its delega-
tion to this 46th Convention of the
Master Builders’ Federation of
tralia with goodwill and best wishes.
My co-delegates are Mr. George
H. Fricker, our Immediate Past Pres-
ident: Mr. Henry Wilckens, our
Vice-President; and Mr. Birk C. Mar-
tin, a member of our Council. We
are accompanied bv other members of
our Association who have accepted
the kind invitation of the Western
Australian Association; the Conven-
tion Hosts of the occasion.
In the exercise of its wisdom, the
Federal Executive has, in the past
year, decreed that all State Associa-
tion reports shall be circulated before
the Convention. This practice, whilst
saving considerably the time avail-
able for Convention sitting, somewhat
detracts from the personal atmosphere
of these reports and from the pleasure
afforded in the formal presentation to
the Federation by the individual.
AMERICAN DEVELOP-
MENT.
The American does not be-
lieve in standing still and is
always prepared to “give it a
go.” Consequently there is
always change and develop-
ment which means a great deal
of building activity. We il-
lustrate two recent develop-
ments. (Top) Elmwood Shop-
ping Centre, which is under
construction in East Patterson,
New Jersey, at a cost of
$3,900,000 ( £A1,733,000 ).
The centre, with parking space
for nearly 3000 cars, will in-
clude a super-market and cen-
tral offices for the Grand Un-
ion Company, a drug store, a
bank, and several large chain
stores on a site 760 by 163 ft.
Below is a new factory and general office building for the Powers Regulation Company at
Skokie, Illinois. The new plant will contain 130,000 sq. ft. and is 575 ft. long. It is
completely air-conditioned.

for the exhibition of personal atmos-

The arrangement between our As-
sociation and the S.A. Institute of
o Architects, last revised and affirmed
in October, 1945, continues we feel
with expanding success although it is
still found necessary to police the pro-
visions in the detection of breaches
by both Architects and Builders. The
following is the memorandum of ar-
rangement we have:

Powers of Committee.
4. The Committee constituted as*
aforesaid shall have power to decide
all questions arising upon the con'
struction of this arrangement and also
all questions and disputes arising as
to the administration of this working
basis whether such questions arise be'
tween the Institute and the Associa-
tion or between individual members
thereof or between individual mem'
bers and either or both of the said
bodies.
Bills of Quantities Required
in Public Tenders.
5. Where public tenders are called
for the architect shall cause quantities
to be taken out by a Quantity Sur-
veyor and a Bill of Quantities shall
be supplied to bona fide tenderers
with the plans and specifications pro'
vided that the preparation of a Bill
of Quantities shall be optional with
the architect where in the case of
houses the estimated cost does not ex'
ceed £7,000 with a margin of 10%,
or in the case of commercial or other
works the cost does not exceed
£lO,OOO with a margin of 10%.
Bills of Quantities Required
in Private Tenders.
6. Where private tenders are called
for from three or more builders the
architect shall cause Quantities to
be taken out by a Quantity Survey'
or and a Bill of Quantities shall be
supplied to bona fide tenderers with
the plans and specifications provided
that the preparation of a Bill of
Quantities shall be optional with the
architect where in the case of houses
the estimated cost does not exceed
£B,OOO with a margin of 10% or in
the case of commercial or other works
the estimated cost not to exceed
£ll,OOO with a margin of 10%.
Repetition Work.
7. Where tenders are called for a
group or groups of two or more
houses of similar design the estimated
cost of one house of the said group
or groups shall be the basis upon
which the minimum referred to in
Clause 5 and 6 herein shall be ap'
plicable.
Appeal to Committee.
8. If it should appear to anv build'
er that on taking off the works his
tender will exceed the amounts re'
ferred to in Clauses 5 and 6 herein
as the case mav be such builder may
report the matter to the Association
who may approach the architect who,
on being so approached, may submit
the plans and specifications to the
Committee for its ruling as to whether
a Bill of Quantities is required.
Plans Endorsed.
9. If the Committee shall decide
in relation to any proposed work that
a Bill of Quantities is not required
its ruling to that effect shall be em
dorsed on the plans and specifications.
Bills of Quantities Sealed
and Held by the Architect.
10. Forthwith upon a tender being
accepted the builder shall deliver to
the architect the Bill of Quantities
as priced by him for the purpose of
his tender and such Bill of Quant'
ities shall after perusal by the archb
tect be sealed and remain in the com
fidential custody of the architect. If
at any time the necessity arises the
Bill of Quantities may be opened by
the architect in the presence of the
builder and shall be resealed after
perusal, but the Bill of Quantities
shall only be opened at any time in
the presence of the builder. The
prices contained in the Bill of Quan
ities shall constitute schedule rates
for all variations ordered by the ar'
chitect in the contract works.
Fees of Quantity Surveyor.
11. The fees payable to Quantity
Surveyors for taking out, preparing
and supplying to the architect the Bill
of Quantities together with such extra
copies thereof as shall be required by
the architect shall be a fee of one
per centum (1%) computed as
follows:
(a) On the amount of the accept'
ed tender less the amount of
the Prime Cost or Provisional
Sums contained in the Condi'
tions of Contract upon which
the Quantity Surveyor shall
not have been required to take
out Quantities.
(b) Where the work is not pro'
ceeded with, on the architect’s
estimate or the lowest tender
received whichever is the low'
er, less Prime Cost and/or
Provisional Sums as aforesaid.
(c) In the case of alternative or
amended tenders, on the
amount of the higher tender
less the amount of Prime Cost
and/or Provisional Sums as
aforesaid.
(d) In the case of work carried
out by day labour or by means
other than a lump sum con'
tract the method of computinp
the fees and the manner and
time of payment of the Quan'
tity Surveyor shall be arrived
at by arrangement between the
architect and the Quantity
Surveyor.
Provided that where tenders
are called either private or by
public tender and a Bill of
Quantities is required under
Clauses 5 and 6 herein as the
case may be and the intended
works are of such a nature
that the cost of preparation of
a Bill of Quantities pursuant
to this arrangement is prohibu
tive or unwarranted the archh
tect shall be permitted to ar'
range with a Quantity Survey'
or for the provision of a Bill
of Quantities at an agreed
lump sum cost in which case
the so agreed fees payable
shall be fully set out in the
Bill of Quantities.
Quantity Surveyors Fees
Payable By.
12. The Quantity Surveyor’s fees
shall be included by the builder in his
tender and where the tender is ac'
cepted shall be payable by the build'
er to the Quantity Surveyor. In the
event of no tender being accepted
the Quantity Surveyor’s fee shall be
paid by the proprietor.
Method of Payment of Fees.
12. The Quantity Surveyor’s fee
shall be paid out of the amount pay'
able upon the first certificate and
shall be included therein and shall be
paid within fourteen days from the
issue of such certificate or before the
issue of the second certificate which'
ever shall first happen and shall be
payable upon production of an order
on the builder by the architect.
We desire at this Convention to
press for the establishment of an Aus'
tralia wide standard constitution for
the conduct and application of the
Quantity Surveying system and we de'
sire the institution of and adherence
to a standard method of measurement
in building quantity surveying
throughout Australia.
Insurance Covers.
We are of the opinion that a stand'
ard policy or policies of insurance
cover should be devised whereby the
intricate and most misleading covers
which are now available may be avoid'
ed. We believe that public risk in'
surance should have standard applica'
tion of cover in progress with the
potentials of risk and that, likewise,
fire, storm and tempest cover should
be given in accordance with the pro'
gressive potential damage that may oc'
cur. We would like to hear the views
of other State Associations on this
subject.
Rise and Fall.
There seems to be a complete lack
of uniformity in the application of
“rise and fall” provisions in contracts
and of the methods of computing,
not only the net increases or decreases
in costs occasioned by legislative auth'
orities, but in the percentage additions
to provide adequately, and not more
than adequately, for the incidence of
direct on'cost. The matter of
“amending Rise and Fall provisions
in contracts to provide for the addh
tion of a percentage to cover admin'
istrative and overhead costs occasion'
ed by cost fluctuations” was dealt with
at the last Convention and subsequent'
ly the Executive on 4th February,

“ STRATHKYLE,” 19/23 BLIGH STREET, SYDNEY
1952, upon which latter occasion re'
sponse to approach to the Royal Aus'
tralian Institute of Architects was con'
sidered. That response seemed to ex'
press the view that—“it does not feel
that the 10% surcharge is acceptable
to the building public
that the builder should not make any
profit on such items ...”
South Australia’s response to the
expressions of the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects, which expres'
sions were referred by the Executive
to the States, is: and I quote from
our letter of 27/2/52:
“This Association endorses the
Federation’s contention that 10%
shall be added to ‘rise and fall’
adjustments in contracts to pre'
serve the on'cost percentage in
the original and adjusted contract
amounts for administration and
overhead charges. It is recom'
mended that the Institute of Ar'
chitects be advised that added
profits from such ‘rise and fall’
adjustments are not sought.
“If this percentage in addition to
direct oncost percentage be not
received in the adjustments the
builder must suffer a direct loss,
through the original indirect ad'
ministration and overhead charges
percentages oncost being reduc'
ed progressively with the added
cost increases.
“The Federation’s claim for build'
ers is comparable with that of
the Institute’s whereby architects
charge and receive 6% on such
’rise and fall’ adjustments (the
latter advised by architects in
Adelaide).”
The Executive’s recognition of “the
principle that the builder is entitled
to recompense to cover expenses in
computing variations in the contract
sum resulting from the operation of
the rise and fall clause,” as report of
its meeting of 21st May, 1952, indi-
cates, coincides with South Australia’s
viewpoint in that it is reimbursement
of additional accounting costs which
are primarily sought but how such
reimbursement can be assessed by
means of a percentage of the money
amount involved evades us. I shall
enlarge upon these introductory re'
marks in due course.
The proposal for a formula to pro'
vide for rise and fall adjustments, as
considered by the Executive has re'
ceived our attention and I cannot
better describe our views otherwise
than by quoting the considered opin'
ion we conveyed to the Executive on
16th May, 1952; I quote:
“It is appreciated that if some
short cut method can be devised
which would eliminate the cleri'
cal work which is involved in the
present method of implementing
provisions of the rise and fall
clause a great service will be
rendered the industry.
“However, this Association consid'
ers that the proposed method is
not practicable of application in
South Australia and the existing
method of seeking and obtaining
variation in the contract in ac'
cordance with the actual rise
and/or fall as may occur is en-
dorsed.
“The Association considers that re'
imbursement of the net rise in
costs is inadequate, and endorses
the Federation’s resolution to per-
severe in obtaining an added per-
centage in the case of rises, and
an allowance in the case of falls,
to compensate for the cost of ac'
counting preparation ...”
I shall enlarge upon this matter
during the normal procedure of the
Convention.
Progress Certificates.
Our Association has endorsed the

Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modern school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and HJlcon lightweight precast reinforced
concrete Roof, Floor and Wall units.
All Presweld Components are permanently rust-
proofed by the hot dip galvanizing process.

SAW IS ANCIENT TOOL.
Ancient Greek historians ascribed
the invention of the saw to Daedalus,
Perdix and Talus, all three mytholog'
ical personages. But figures of saws
have been found on some of the old'
est Egyptian monuments which ante'
dated Greek civilisation by several
thousand years.
The early Chinese also used saws.
The saws of the early Greek carpent'
ers, it is interesting to observe, were
very much like those we use today.
But as to the name of the man who
first used a saw —nobody knows.

Parapets or Dormers is the choice in this foursome for the prospective home-builder. He can have a steeply
pitched roof (top right) into which, in the English manner, attic type rooms are contained and by this means
additional accommodation is secured at a cheaper cost than in a full two-storey house. The dormer windows
necessary to provide light and ventilation give it the picturesque character. .As a direct opposite the bottom
left design has a flat roof with a low parapet all around and heavy horizontal concrete canopies over the windows,
returning down the sides to the ground. Top left and bottom right are simplified variations of the gable type
house which has found considerable favour in Australia.

“Up They Go” is New York Slogan
Housing Projects Reach Skyward.
Incoming tenants of New York’s
Stuyvesant Town are each handed a
brochure.
“Take it easy,’’ they read. “Take it
easy . . . this is your home, but re'
member 26,000 other people live in
this housing project.’’
Stuyvesant Town’s population of
26,000 lives in 35 towering apartment
blocks, each 14 storeys high.
What is more, some 7,500,000 other
people live in the neighbourhood.
This mighty housing project was
launched in 1946, when the Metro'
politan Life Insurance Co. purchased
75 acres of down'at'heel slums in what
was known as the notorious “Gas
House district.’’
The new structures are built on less
than one'quarter of the 75 acres—the
rest is landscaped with lawns, gardens,
trees and children’s play areas.
Before the insurance company
bought the derelict acres, housing con'
ditions comparable with the world’s
worst abounded there. Only 3000
families lived within its 18 city blocks,
and there was no tree, bush, or blade
of grass to be seen anywhere.
By March, 1949, the huge task of
building and equipping Stuyvesant
Town was completed and 8755 fami'
lies were in residence.
This enormous housing development
is on Manhattan Island, the centre of
New York City.
Manhattan’s subway stations are urn
der five minutes’ walk from the pro'
ject. A mile away is one of New
York’s greatest power'generating sta'
tions. Half a mile away is one of the
city’s main telenhone exchanges.
Cost £A.SO Million.
The construction gangs came to
work by subway from nearby suburbs.
Permanent roads were laid throughout
the so the contractors’ trucks
didn’t get held up in wet weather.
Many miles of new water and sewerage
systems were linked up with mains
right alongside the blocks.
Stuyvesant Town cost the Metro'
politan Life Co. £A.SO million. That
works out at £11,160 for each apart'
ment.
Bearing in mind that a modest
house in New York costs £lO,OOO, and
the average yearly wage is £2OOO, the
average weekly rental of £9 in Stuy'
vesant Town conforms with the socio'
legist s contention that no man should
spend more than a week’s wages for a
month’s rent.
It is worth bearing in mind, too,
that in Stuyvesant Town and most
other housing projects the gas and
electricity is free, and in almost all
New York apartments the landlord
supplies the stove and refrigerator.
Huge Housing Projects.
When Metropolitan Life planned
the Town, the City Housing Authority
condemned all slums in the 18 city
block district.
The company then purchased the
slums, demolished them wholesale, and
when the new apartment blocks were
completed the city slashed rates and
taxes on them to enable rents to be
held sufficiently low.
Stuyvesant Town is the largest prh
vate enterprise housing project on
Manhattan Island. There are 40 other
housing projects close to the centre of
New York, and 30 of them are the
work of the New York City Housing
Authority.
Almost 40,000 families live in these
30 city'owned blocks. The biggest cf
them has room for ov~r 2000 families,
and most of the blocks are set aside
for low'income families. As soon as
tenants befrin to earn more than a set
income, around £l2OO per annum,
they must move out.
Each block is built close to existing
transport and other facilities. Subways
are close by, and shopping areas are
only half a block distant. For most
people the office is only 10 or 15
minutes downtown by subway.
In 80 public housing projects in all
districts of Metropolitan New York
500 million dollars (£A.22 3,2 50,000.)
of public money is invested. Federal,
State and City Governments each pro-
vide about one'third of that amount.
The city’s Housing Authority is per'
mitted to borrow up to 90 per cent,
of the money required for building
from the Federal Government. That
comes from Federal loans and taxes.
The Federal Government also pro'
vides a yearly subsidy to cover the dif'
ference between the blocks’ operating
costs and rent revenue.
Apartment Life Preferred.
The State and City Governments
also get building funds from loans and
taxes, and give similar subsidies for
the blocks they finance. The Federal
Government owns 34 projects, State
Government 26, the City of New York
24.
All projects, with the exception of
a few blocks, are built on land re'
claimed from slums. New York has
tenaciously stuck to the dual task of
ridding the city of noisome slums and
providing extra living space at the
same time by the expedient of erect'
ing new 14'Storeyed blocks where
hitherto slum buildings were at the
most three storeys high.
In New York, also, there is less
antipathy than in Australia toward
apartment life. The reasons behind it
are ethnic and economic.

NEW HOTEL FOR SAO PAULO.
This cleverly produced picture shows a scale
model of a new hotel to be built on Ipiranga
Avenue, Sao Paulo, Brazil, photographed
against the city background that it will
eventually occupy, the affect being so real-
istic that it is difficult to believe that the
building is not completed. The present
craze for erecting huge buildings “on stilts”
has been exploited to the full, for in this
case the upper portion, where the size of the
building sets back, is also similarly treated.

Remember that Continental Euro-
peans and their families form about
95 per cent, of New York’s popula-
tion. They worry far less about de-
tached homes and their own gardens
than Australians do.
While they are on lower-middle in-
comes they prefer the apartment life,
being by nature gregarious. But past
that income stage, convention and the
sake of appearance demand that they
move outside Manhattan to a suburban
residence.
As their income increases and their
fortunes improve, they move still fur-
ther out. Then, if and when they
“strike oil," they return again to the
very heart of New York—to a Park
Avenue apartment.
With typical American aptitude for
nomenclature, the suburban outskirts
of New York is termed “Chevrolet
country.” Further out is what’s called
“Buick country,’’ and finally one comes
to the “Cadillac country’’—which also
includes the fabulous Park Avenue.
In these aptly-named areas of plu-
tocracy, it is rare to find a young
couple building a home for them-
selves, as we do in the outlying areas
of an Australian city. And housing
projects for low-income families are
confined to the heart of New York,
where huge apartment blocks reach
skyward around Manhattan Island.
Should U.S. Contractors Be Licensed
Perennial Controversy Flares.
With registration of builders im-
minent in N.S.W., it is interesting to
examine the system used by some 18
American States, and gain an idea of
the overall picture.
In 18 States, the basic rule is: “Be-
fore a contractor gets a contract, he’d
better get a license.’’
In 1951, two more States, Florida
and Arizona, enacted contractors' li-
censing laws. Nearly 33 per cent, of
contractors doing more than $lOO,OOO
(£A.44,550) in volume last year work-
ed on projects in States with licensing
laws.
During 1951, these 18 States with
contractor licensing laws, accounted
for more than $4 billion (£A. 1,820,-
000,000) in contracts out of the $l3
billion (£A.5,921,500,000) all Ameri-
can total. This total is impressive as
few States in the New England, Middle
Atlantic, and Midwest regions have
started licensing.
Contractors licensing has been a
controversial issue ever since the
State of Maryland brought down a
law in 1916 requiring licensing of con-
tractors for highway work.
Some For, Some Against.
The Associated General Contractor
—at the national level —have not stat-
ed their position in the past, and arc
observing neutrality now.
The reason is that A.G.C. member:
who do a nation-wide business are gen-
erally opposed to licensing, while lo-
cal chapters of the A.G.C. and oth
contractors’ groups have been the
prime movers in getting these laws on
the books.
And in States which now have li-
censing laws, it is often the local con-
tractors’ group that seeks even tight-
er state regulations.
For instance, in Montana, two Chap-
ters of the A.G.C., the Montana
Building Chapter and the Montana
Contractors Association, have beer-
studying the laws of other States, in
an effort to draft a tougher contract-
ors’ law.
Under the present 10-day waiting
period required by law, Montana of-
ficials claim, there is not sufficient
time to check up on a contractors’
qualifications, and the State Equalisa-
tion Board does not do a complete

job of investigation before the license
is issued.
In almost every State, except four
in which licensing is primarily for
revenue, local contractors have pushed
these bills through legislatures, to re'
strict undesirable contractors.
There are other reasons, too. Ida*
ho, for example, passed a law in
1941 licensing contractors for public
works. This legislation came about
when some city contractors complain-
ed that they had been left “holding
the bag” for irresponsible contractors.
As a result, Idaho law now requires
proof of financial responsibility—and
financial statements by a certified pub-
lic accountant.
California’s Model Law.
California’s contracting law is gen-
erally considered a model. This law,
enacted in 1929, is a regulation pro-
posal advocated by the construction
industry as an aftermath of the roar'
ing 20’s when millions of dollars in
liens were filed against builders.
Since its enactment there have been
repeated amendments to the law
strengthening it.
Some Details.
• Qualification —The law provides
that every applicant for license must
be possessed of good character; it
defines that which constitutes lack of
character, applicable not only to the
individual applicant, but to each cor'
porate officer, each partner, and to a
responsible managing employee of an
applicant.
Possible bases for rejection are;
• That the applicant has committed
or done some act which if committed
or done by a licensee would be
grounds for the suspension or revoca'
tion of license.
• That the aplicant has done some
act involving dishonesty, fraud or de-
ceit wherein he has benefited or some
other person has been injured thereby.
• That the applicant bears a bad
reputation for honesty and integrity.
• That the applicant has been con'
victed of a felony.
• Classification —The law sets up
only two classifications of contractors
—general engineering and general
building, but the State Board has es'
tablished 31 other classifications.
A board rule says that one operat'
ing outside the scope of his classifica'
tion will be subjected to disciplinary
action —that is, he runs the risk of
suspension or revocation of his li'
cense. Courts in the state already
have deprived contractors from cob
lecting for services when acting out'
side their classification, just as those
who operate a license in the first in'
stance.
The Licensing Board has established
a rule requiring applicants to have
four years of experience, within the
last 10 years, as a journeyman or fore'
man or superintendent in the craft or
classification under which they seek
a license.
Applicants must set forth a detailed
record of experience on application
forms, which must be verified. Next
they are examined.
• Exams —Examinations are in two
parts:
• The first part deals with the var-
ious state laws the board feels a con'

U.M.I. WELCOMED TO N.S.W.
Party at Wentworth Hotel.
On Thursday last, October 23, a
Cocktail Party and Buffet Dinner was
held at the Wentworth Hotel to cele-
brate the launching of United Metal
Industries’ products in the N.S.W.
market.
In the Wentworth Ballroom around
which a wide range of the company’s
products was on display, a large gath-
ering representing all sections of the
home appliances trade were the guests
of the U.M.I. Organisation.
The Hon. F. J. Finnan, M.L.A.,
State Minister for Labour and Indus-
try, who attended representing the
Premier, welcomed U.M.I. to N.S.W.
and said that the introduction of these
products would further extend the
range and selection of household ap-
pliances for the home-builder and
housewife.
The letters U.M.I. are new to
N.S.W. though they are a household
word in Queensland where the or-
ganisation has been established for
nearly thirty years and the plant, which
is one of the most modern in Aus-
tralia, covers an area of 27 acres.
The company's winged symbol,
which is extensively used in their ad-
vertising, is prominent on the full
range of electric ranges, gas cookers,
fuel stoves, electric hotwater systems,
electric storage bath heaters, wash boil-
ers, stainless steel sinks and other appli-
ances for the home. The handy little
“Washmobile” Laundry Trolley which
is claimed to halve the work of wash-
ing, was utilised in wheeling savour-
ies and drinks around the hall.
Mr. K. A. Lavis, Managing Direct-
or, Mr. Neil Simpson, Sales Manager,
and Mr. John Deck, of John Deck &
Co., the N.S.W. agents of U.M.1..
spoke during the evening and outlin-
ed the company’s new policy of ex
pansion.
U.M.I. appliances will be on sale in
N.S.W. stores very shortly.
THE HON. F. J. FINNAN, M.L.A.,
Minister for Labour and Industry,
Speaking at the buffet dinner at the Wentworth
Ballroom to mark the introduction of U.M.I.
Products on the N.S.W. market.

tractor should have general knowledge
of, along with questions on business,
payroll computation and figuring a
general estimate which embraces all
of these items of overhead which are
so many times overlooked.
• The second part of the examina'
tion is of a craft or technical nature.
The questions for the craft part of the
examination are suggested by repre'
tentative persons of the craft involved
in the test.
About 33% fail at their first at'
tempt at the examination. Those who
would enter the vocation of contract'
ing can take but four examinations in
a year period, since a 90 day waiting
period is required between examina'
tions for those who fail. For every
five applications, only one becomes a
licensed contractor. The other four
fall out.
Some Variations.
In most other States licensing laws
are not as comprehensive or as com'
plicated as those in California.
Florida has a blanket state licens'
ing act that can be used by any
coynty or municipality. A license must
be obtained on each county in which
the contractor sets up headquarters or
a separate place of business.
In some other States, licensing of
contractors is for revenue only. In
Delaware, Maryland, Mississippi, and
Utah the contractor pays the fee rang'
ing from $5 (£2/5/0) to $l5 £A6/
15/0) minimum, and he gets the lb
cense, without any examination. In
addition, he pays a certain percentage
of either gross receipts or contract
value.
In Idaho and Montana only public
works contractors are covered by law,
and in Michigan, only residential build'
ers. In the other 15 States, all types
of contractors are regulated. In ad'
dition to the licensing, most of the
States also require pre'qualifications
of bidders. North Carolina is the only
State which requires contractors to
pre'qualify on all types of projects.
In 12 of the 18 States, all high'
wav contractors must pre-qualify. In
four States contractors must pre'quah
ify for all State public works. Dela'
ware requires no pre-qualification.
Alternatives.
If licensing of contractors is not
*he best solution, what is?” U.S. con'
tractors ask. Many believe that pre'
qualification of bidders or policing by
the industry itself is. But the consen
sus of opinion is that the strongest
alternative to contractor licensing ap
pears to be bonding.
U.S. surety underwriters have strong
opinions on the value of performance
bonds, and on the characters of com
tractors.
They feel that performance bonds,
which guarantee to an owner that a
job will be completed on schedule
and in accordance with plans and spec'
ifications, are a “ must” for buyers of
constructions.
Any contractor who successfully
passes the examinations the surety un-
derwriters require for a performance
bond is a good risk, the security com'
panics state.
If an S and an I and an O. and a U
and an X at the end spells Sue
And an E and a Y and an E spell I,
And then if an S and an I and a G
and an H E D spell side
Then the only thing that a speller
can do is to go and

VENEZUELA CHECKERS.
The unusual checker-board facade of this new
apartment building in Caracas, Venezuela, has
a practical purpose in that it promotes a nat-

72,521 Building Firms In Britain
41,815 General Builders.
Mr. J. C. Watson, A.M.1.C.E., in a
series of articles on “Factors Involved
in the Mechanisation of Building” in
the London “Contract Journal,” gave
details of the numbers of Building,
Contracting and allied firms operating
in the United Kingdom as at May,
1949, which were the latest figures
available. Details given below show
the number of registered firms making
returns to the Ministry of Works.
Australian Figures.
The Quarterly Bulletin of Building
Statistics issued by the Commonwealth
Bureau of Census and Statistics (for
the March Quarter, 1951) gives the
following table, which, however, deals
more with numbers of individuals em-
ployed than the number of firms.
Speedy Brickie
Comes to Aussie
When Ambrose Armstrong, a Brit'
ish bricklayers, laid bricks at full speed
other bricklayers refused to work with
him.
So he was given the fob of building
the shell of a pair of three'bedroom
council homes on his own —and he
did it in 169jr hours against an aver-
age of 500 man-hours.
But forty - three - year - old wondei
brickie Ambrose Armstrong will build
no more houses in Britain.
He has brought his talents to Aus-
tralia, where he thinks his wife, ten-
year-old son, and himself will have a
better chance, although he averaged
£23 a week for his lightning bricklay-
ing.
It will be interesting, however, to
see if Ambrose can overcome the
bricklaying darg of 200 bricks a day
in Australia, and establish some speed
records.
The nation needs men of his calibre
who are not afraid to work, but . . . !
THE CLASSIC INFLUENCE PERSISTS.
In the interior of a home at Beverley Hills,
California, it can be seen in the graceful
pilasters and the crowning cornice that the
classic influence, in spite of the inroads of
the contemporary style, still exerts a powerful
influence. The fluted motif used to the deep
barrel-vault in the centre, while effective, is
rather reminiscent of the corrugated iron
interior of a wartime Anderson shelter and
consequently would not find favour with any
Londoner.

MELBOURNE OLYMPIC
SWIMMING POOL.
Architectural Competition
Announced.
Following closely on the successful
result of the Melbourne Olympic Stad-
ium Competition it has just been am
nounced that an Architectural Compm
tition for the design of the Olympic
Pool for the Melbourne Games is to
be held.
The competition is open to all reg-
istered Architects in Australia, but as
time is very short those who desire
to compete should register their names
immediately with the Registrar, Mr.
John B. Islip, 53-55 Collins Place,
Melbourne, C.l, and they will receive
copies of the Conditions as soon as
they are available.
THE GIRAFFE.
Versatile New Grinding Machine.
Scaffolding, planks, and all similar impedi-
menta is unnecessary as a result of this new
machine, known as the giraffe, which over-
comes all the inconveniences associated with
the grinding of concrete ceilings. The fully
adjustable grinding head will not only remove
ribs, fins and board marks but with equal
ease will remove nails. The grinding discs
are direct-driven by a flexible 7ft. shaft.
The machines are made by Concrete Grind-
ing Corporation, Dept. R., 300 Straight
St., Paterson, N.J.

IMPROVING ST. PAUL’S
ACOUSTICS.
Scientific Experiments Carried Out.
A new speech reinforcement system
which has been designed by the
Building Research Station in Collabor-
ation with Pamphonic Reproducers,
Ltd., London, is under test in St.
Paul’s Cathedral, London.
The Cathedral is a particularly dif-
ficult building for speech because of
its very reverberant acoustics which
can make speech unintelligible. The
reverberation time (time taken for
sound to die away) is 12 seconds in
the empty Cathedral compared with
four seconds in the Royal Albert Hall
when empty, or seconds in the
Royal Festival Hall empty. The new
system makes use of two recent de-
velopments—the loudspeaker column
and the time delay.
The human voice, or the sound
from an ordinary loud-speaker, spreads
out more or less equally in all direc-
tions. This means that while some
of the sound goes straight to the lis-
tener, most of it, in an unusually re-
verberant place such as the Cathedral,
reaches him by reflection from the var-
ious surfaces after a considerable time
interval. Thus the returning sound
of one syllable interferes with the di-
rect sound from the next syllable, with
the result that it is impossible to hear
distinct words. If all, or nearly all,
the sound could be directed towards
the listener the reflected sound would
be negligible. This is achieved by the
loudspeaker column consisting of a
number of ordinary loudspeakers plac-
ed in a vertical line. By an interfer-
ence process this arrangement pro-
duces a beam of sound which spreads
out equally in all directions in the
horizontal plane but which in the ver-
tical plane is confined within a few
feet.
In the Cathedral, one such column
is placed next to the pulpit and the
sound from it is directed towards the
congregation in the dome area. There
is a limit to the distance that this one
column will cover, and so additional
columns are installed down the nave.
Time Delays.
A listener at the east end of the
nave may, for instance, be about 20
ft. from one of the loudspeaker col-
umns in the nave and 120 ft. from the
column next to the pulpit. With an
ordinary amplification system the
sound from the nave will reach him
about l/10th of a second before the
sound from the pulpit. Since it is the
sound which arrives first which main-
ly determines the apparent direction
of the source, the listener would
think that all the sound was coming
from the nave loudspeaker. If an
electrical delay is introduced into the
nave loudspeaker so that it is delayed
by this l/10th second, plus a little
more, the sound from the pulpit loud-
speaker will reach the listener first
and he will now think that all the
sound is coming from the pulpit, with
an obvious gain in realism. This has
been done in the Cathedral, and the
illusion that all the sound is com-
ing from the pulpit can be maintained
over the whole congregation area.
—“British Constructional Engineer.”

ENGLISH AND SPANISH INFLUENCE.
In these designs there is evidence of both a strong English and Spanish influence. Top right is conceived very
much on the lines of the lazy low- lying hacienda and it imparts all the colour and luxuriant shadow of that style.
England and the half -timber traditions on the other hand had. provided the direct inspiration for the lower left
-a type of home which while very popular in Sydney twenty years ago, is today eclipsed by the maximum-
window-space era. The other two designs are both in the modified English coţage aţic bedroom tradistion.
