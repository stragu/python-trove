Rose Bay, N.5.W., remodelled by
Architects Rogers and Hodge for
BOYCE BROS.,

Boyce Bros/ 200 employees enjoy greater working
comfort because of Cane-ite insulation on the walls.
And another important plus, the natural sound-
deadening qualities of Cane-ite proved effective in
shielding the front office and designing sections from
the noise of scores of machines in the busy workrooms.
You can put In a better remodelling fob

materials used being AA.3S sheet and
extruded mouldings. In both cases the
awnings have been left with the

obtained by roll forming the edges.
Aluminium Awnings give Old Buildings new look
With aluminium, you can forget maintenance expense. Aluminium will never rot,
rust or warp. Under normal conditions of exposure it will never need painting,
but is easily painted if desired. Fire-resistant and vermin-proof, aluminium will
give you years and years of trouble-free service. Consult your architect or
building contractor about aluminium —about aluminium doors, aluminium win-
dows and other aluminium building components —find out what they mean to
your business in terms of long range economy and customer appeal.

corrying Putlogt
Sometimes called the single
scaffold as against the inde-
pendent or double scaffold. In
this construction, one end of
the putlog is fixed between the
courses of the brickwork, the
other end to the standard by
90° clip or else to the ledger by
putlog clip. For normal work,
the standards are spaced at
approximately 7'6" intervals,
and the height of lifts kept to
4'6". A minimum amount of
bracing is required, as use is
made of the wall itself. The
scaffold can be rapidly erected
as the work progresses if pro-
vision is made for the putlogs
while the brickwork is green.
Approximate quantities of tube and fit-

Concord Plaster was used in the construction
of this ceiling at the new
AUSTRALIA HOTEL. SYDNEY
THE CHOICE OF MEN WHO KNOW FINE PLASTER
Leading manufacturers of fibrous plaster sheets
(used in the ceiling above) use Concord Plaster.
Architects and Builders choose the famous
Concord Hardwall Plaster for the marble-hard
finish it gives to wall surfaces that have to stand
up to particularly hard wear ... for public build-
ings, theatres, hospitals, schools, factory canteens
and for recreation rooms, kitchens and bath
rooms. This specially processed, superfine quality
plaster gives you outstandingly beautiful as
well as durable interiors. It trowels to a mirror-
smooth surface which provides a perfect base
for any type of decoration. It contains no alkali
to stain wall linings or papers, or to saponify the
oil in paints.
Craftsmen find Concord Hardwall
Plaster more flexible, easier to handle.
It mixes and works faster.

ROWCO pAstedcent FITTINGS
FIT INDUSTRIAL LIGHTING COST
In good lighting first costs are not the real costs!
Real costs are first costs plus installation, operation and maintenance
expenses for the entire life of the system.
With the ROWCO SV/IND/240 “V” Industrial Twin 40 fitting you
will frequently find that fewer units are needed, this means first
costs are lower, but the really big saving comes in lower electricity
consumption and lower maintenance figures.
The ROWCO SV/IND/240 has brought high praise from plant en-
gineers because of its greatly increased vertical light output and
fewer maintenance problems.
Suitable for flush or suspension mounting.
ROWCO lighting engineers are just as near as the telephone and through-
out Australia offer engineered lighting , not just fixtures.

PHILIPS Ballasts
The Philips Ballast is another essential component which
maintains the high standard of the Philips Fluorescent Lamp.
Starter Switch, and other auxiliaries. The ballast is used in
conjunction with the fluorescent lamp and is designed to operate
with low power loss and good waveform, which result in long
lamp life. The ballast is housed in an attractive metal container
and is provided with rubber insulated leads which pass through
bushed holes in the case. These leads are of sufficient length
to reach the lampholders. The following types are available:
Type 8099—40 W Lagging Ballast—suitable for use with one
only 40W fluorescent lamp or two only 20W fluorescent lamps
connected in series.
Type 8091—40 W Leading Ballast—suitable for use with one only
40W fluorescent lamp when used in conjunction with an adjoin-
ing 40W fluorescent lamp operating on a type 8099 ballast. This
operation results in stroboscopic correction.
Type 8115 —20W Lagging Ballast—suitable for use with one only
20W fluorescent lamp.
PL 22-54.
. . . its leadership
in the lighting field
is ensured by a
63 year old tradition
There is a growing consciousness in industry, in commerce, even in
domestic life, of the need for good lighting. It finds expression in
the growing acceptance of Fluorescent installations with their more
even distribution of light, more economical use of light.
Philips, leaders in the lighting field for over 60 years, maintains its
tradition in its full range of Fluorescent lamps and matched auxiliary
equipment.
To specify Philips is to facilitate efficient and economical lighting
arrangements adapted to the needs of the user. Apply to your

by Mr. Hornibrook and members of
the Executive. Mr. Hornibrook had
been delegated to convey the message
to her that she had, that morning,
been elected Honorary Member No. 2
of the Institute of Builders of
Australia.
It will be recalled that Mr. Men-
ses was elected Honorary Member
No. I at the Inaugural Dinner of the
organisation.
Mrs. Taylor expressed her great
pride in being thus honoured, and
because Mr. Hornibrook knew
George Taylor well, she added:
“Wouldn’t George be proud of this!”
President’s Address.
Guests assembled in a small park
in the shadow of the Harbour
Bridge’s northern approach, directly
across the road from the new head-
quarters construction of which is
well under way.
On his arrival, the Prime Minister
was received by the Institute’s Fede-
ral President, Mr. Manual R. Horni-
brook, F.A.1.8. (Q.), and the Fede-
ral Vice-President, Mr. G .A. Win-
wood, F.A.1.8. (Vic.).
In his address, Mr. Hornibrook
said: —
“The Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister,
Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen:
To-day is a most historic occasion, as
it marks the first stage in the estab-
lishment of the headquarters of the
Australian Institute of Builders.
“On this memorable occasion we
are honoured to have with us the
first citizen of Australia, the Rt. Hon.
R. G. Menzies, who has graciously
consented to set the foundation stone
for us.
“History In Making.”
“As history is in the making, may
I congratulate you. Sir, on behalf of
members, on your achievement of
holding the record of the longest
term of office as Prime Minister of
this country.” (Applause.)
“The Australian Institute of Build-
ers is an Institution somewhat on the
same lines as the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects, and the In-
stitution of Builders, London, and its
function is to educate and train
young men so that their qualifications
will enable them to take competent
charge of the building industry.”
Mr. Hornibrook said that in Lon-
don the Institute of Builders had
been established for about 140 years,
and it had done a remarkable job in
training personnel to construct build-
ings in Great Britain.
“A few of our Australian builders
became members of the London In-
stitute, but on account of distance it
was difficult to derive much benefit.
the Master Builders’
Federation of Australia saw the ne-
cessity of forming an Australian In-
stitute and gave authority to proceed
with its formation, with Chapters in
each State,” Mr. Hornibrook
continued.
“Each Chapter was to enrol suffi-
cient members to enable a start to be
made. Members realised that they had
nothing to gain for themselves; on
the contrary, they would be called
upon to give much.
“In 1951 the late Mr. Fred Wilson,
0.8. E., was elected first President,
but on account of ill-health was un-
able to continue after the first year,
and I followed him in 1952.
Headquarters Decision.
“We soon realised that to be effec-
tive it was essential that we establish
a Headquarters, and I am pleased to
say that the members throughout Aus-
tralia were unanimous that Sydney
should be its home.” (Applause.)
"We found it very difficult to
obtain suitable accommodation in
Sydney; therefore, it became neces-
sary to erect our own building and
after a long search for a suitable posi-
tion we were fortunate enough to
acquire the present site.
“In this connection, I wish to
thank the North Sydney Council for
the assistance it rendered.”
(Applause.)
Tenders Called.
“A building committee was formed,
under the leadership of Mr .Charles
F. Gage, with authority to have plans
and specifications prepared for the
calling of tenders. Mr. E. W. Andrew
was appointed architect, tenders were
called, and in June last the contract
was awarded to the lowest tenderers,
H. W. Thompson Pty. Ltd. A senior
member of the company. Mr. Charles
E. Thompson, is a Fellow of this
Institute.”
Appeal For Financial Aid.
Mr. Hornibrook said the total cost
of the building is estimated at
£65,000, plus cost of land and fur'
nishings. As the Institute is only in

its fourth year of existence, its bank-
ing account was quite inadequate to
finance such an undertaking, and
members were appealed to for finan-
cial aid.
“I take this opportunity of thank-
ing most sincerely all those members
and friends who responded, thus
making it possible for us to be here
to-day.
“During our canvass for funds,
some were critical and considered that
we were too ambitious in our plans
and that we should postpone our
building programme. As the success
of the Institute lies in its ability to
progress, we decided that no good
purpose could be served by post-
ponement,” Mr. Hornibrook declared.
No Government Assistance.
“We are very happy to say that we
have not called upon any Govern-
ment for assistance towards the con-
struction of our building, as we feel
it is the responsibility of the builders
of Australia to finance the Institute.”
(Applause.)
“On this occasion, on behalf of the
members, I thank the Mutual Life
and Citizens’ Assurance Company for
accommodating us by way of suffi-
cient loan to enable us to accomplish
our building programme,
“One of the main objectives of the
Institute is to provide facilities for
technical training, and we are most
grateful to the various State Govern-
ments for the assistance rendered in
this department by providing classes
in the technical colleges and Univer-
sities.
Technical Library.
“When students enrol, the Institute
takes an individual interest in them
until they become qualified to take
their part in the building industry.
“In this branch of our activities we
are establishing a technical library,
and we are deeply sensible of the
practical assistance Mrs. Florence M.
Taylor, 0.8. E., has rendered the In-
stitute by her gift of technical books,
which will form the nucleus of the
library.” (Applause.)
In thanking members and friends
for their support, Mr. Hornibrook
said he was particularly mindful of the
excellent work done by the Hon. Sec-
retaries of the Institute; firstly, by Mr.
T. J. Cavanagh, who was followed by
Mr. Murray Gosper.
“We all know the vital importance
of the secretarial work associated with
such an undertaking as this, and it is
evident to-dav that the work has been
well done,” the speaker declared.
“So I feel confident that the efforts
being made by the Institute to pro-
vide suitable management in the build-
ing industry will be appreciated and
enjoyed by the community generally
before many years.
“A Nation-Builder.”
“It is now my very pleasant duty to
introduce to you our No. 1 member.
Mr. R. G. Menzies, F.A.1.8., who
honoured us by accepting honorary
membership.” (Applause.)
“In every sense of the word, he is
a builder, being the greatest builder of
them all—a nation-builder!
“He is at all times prepared to help
and do good, and his interest in the
Institute is more than superficial.”
Mr. Hornibrook then invited the
Prime Minister to set the foundation
stone of the Institute Headquarters,
which he did before a battery of Press
cameras.
Prime Minister’s Speech.
In a breezy speech, delivered in his
own inimitable manner, the Prime
Minister, assured the gathering that
he had made sure that the foundation
stone in the Institute Headquarters
“was well and truly laid.”
“My function now is to do what
every politician is expected to do —to
say a few words.
“I am bound to say I feel com'
pletely at home here.
“One of my jobs in Melbourne is
annually to open the Canterbury Bowk
ing Green (Victoria), and conse'
quently no human interjector has the
slightest terror for me,” Mr. Menzies
declared, glancing down at a group
of small children conducting warfare
with water pistols on the lawn before
him.
Continuing, he said that Mr. Horni'
brook had been kind enough to refer
to his term of office.
“It is rather a double-edged busi-
ness, and is such a reminder that time
is running out. The longer I go on,
the shorter I have left to go.”
To be Prime Minister one needed
to be built of durable materials, Mr.
Menzies declaired.
He said he had a lot of friends
among the builders, who were tough
to get on with. However, he got on
well with them, enjoyed them, and
greatly admired them. (Applause.)
When a builder erected a great
building he wrote himself into it, and
it gave both the architect and the
builder a species of immortality-
“ But the poor politician is here to-
years later people are wondering who
he was.
“No matter what way he turned out
he had done nothing!” (Laughter.)
“But you can’t cancel a building or
a great bridge, except by pulling it
down. A builder has something to be
envied,” Mr. Menzies declared.
“The building industry in many
ways —indeed, in most ways—is the
key industry of Australia.
“The manufacturing and primary
industries, of course, are the great
foundations of national prosperity, but

if you want to measure the genuine
prosperity of the people you must look
at the building industry.”
Some Ups and Downs.
Mr. Menzies said that the industry
had experienced some ups and downs,
and this problem had engaged the
attention of politicians and the
Government.
Building was a measuring'stick
which could be applied to the
economy of Australia, and conse'
quently the building industry was of
the first importance to the nation.
Small fluctuations of labour and
materials had occurred over the last
few years, and it was possible to trace
out the effect more clearly in the
building industry than in any other.
“What is needed is a stabiliser in
these things. The position would be
undoubtedly improved by the effi'
ciency and techniques of the builder
himself.
“We must bow to the U.S. builders,
whom we now envy but ultimately
hope to copy,” Mr. Menzies declared.
“The Australian Institute of Build'
ers has been consciously designed to
lift the standard of skill and improve
the technical knowledge of the people
engaged in the industry.”
Stressing the importance of know'
ledge, Mr. Menzies said the tendency
was to “more and more increase the
technical ability of the builder and
thus tend to reduce building costs,
both matters of national importance.”
“In every walk of life, many people
work for themselves, but devote a
great deal of time working for other
people. The Australian Institute of
Builders is a splendid concept, dedi'
cated to working for the advancement
of the industry.”
Best Memorial.
Mr. Menzies declared that Australia
will have received enormous benefit
from the A. 1.8. when every builder is
a member.
“Their best memorial would be to
make some contribution to advance
the skill, character, and capacity of
the nation for our children and our
children’s children,” Mr. Menzies con'
eluded, amid applause.
Vote of Thanks.
In proposing a vote of thanks to
the Prime Minister, Mr. G. A. Win'
wood, F.A.1.8., struck a happy note
in keeping with the auspicious occa'
sion. He said:—
”ln the Melbourne suburb of
Canterbury where the famous
‘Memorial Hall’ is situated —the white'
wash boys have again been busy, and
it was most interesting to note that
somebody of, and with a different
colour, had deftly altered the ‘T’ of
‘Out’ to ‘R,’ thus changing the mes'
sage to read ‘Our Menzies.’ ”
(Applause.)
‘‘ln connection with the Institute,
we eschew politics, but we can uni'
versally subscribe to the sentiment of
the above message, for ‘Our Menzies,’
as you doubtless know, is No. 1 Hon'
orary Member of the Institute.
“In a slightly more serious vein,
we are very conscious of the honour
which our indefatigable Prime Minis'
ter has shown the Institute by making
time available from his multitudinous
tasks —and a wonderful Test Match —
to attend and perform the task of set'
ting the foundation stone of this
building of which we are so proud,”
Mr. Winwood said.

THE NEW “IBERIA’
P. & O’s. LATEST 30,000 TON LUXURY LINER.
Following closely on the “Arcadia,”
the P. O. “Iberia” was recently in
Sydney on her maiden voyage to
Australia.
With the “Arcadia” and the
“Himalays” she completes, for the
time being, the P. 6? O. building pro-
gramme to provide six fast ships for
the Australian service.
The keel was laid in January, 1952,
at Harland 6? Wolff’s yard at Belfast,
and was launched on January 21, 1954,
by Lady McGrigor, wife of the First
Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Rhoderick Mc-
Grigor, G.C.8., D.S.O.
The vessel has a tonnage of 29,164,
an overall length of 718 ft. 9in., a
breadth moulded 90ft. 6in., and a
service speed of twenty-two and a half
knots. She carries 674 first-class pas-
sengers, 73 3 tourist-class, and a crew
of 711, making a total complement
of 2118. The vessel has her name in
Neon lights just aft of the funnel,
being red on the port side and green
on the starboard side. Stabiliser fins,
cimilar to those in the ‘’'Arcadia,” are
fitted and they reduce rolling to a
bare minimum, thus giving a new
standard of comfort to passengers.
She is extensively air-conditioned and
has the new system of making fresh
water from sea water, successfully
tried out in her predecessors “Hima-
laya” and “Arcadia,” and the plant
is capable of distilling 550 tons per
day for domestic and boiler use.
The vessel also has a considerable
freight-carrying capacity of 304,930
cubic feet, including 147,750 cubic
feet of insulated space for refrigerated
goods.

Mclnnes Gardner and Partners, of
Glasgow. Miss Barbara Oakley was
in charge of colour schemes through-
out the ship.
Tapestry Panels.
The main features of the “Iberia’s”
spacious drawing room are two
tapestry panels. The larger and more
important one was made in Edin-
burgh by Ronald Cruifkshank, the
noted weaver, to a design by Dom
Robert, who is one of the world’s
leading artists in this field. Dom
Robert, was born in France in 1907
and, after compling his military ser-
vice, joined the Benedictine Order;
he has lived and worked at Buckfast
Abbey, in Devon, since 1948. His
tapestries, which feature animals,
birds and trees, are being woven in
the traditional manner, using twenty
colours. The designs, however, are as
modern as the liner which will house
them.
The fitted pile carpet for this room
was made by Templeton’s, of Glas-
gow, to a design by Ronald Grierson,
who is a member of the Society of
Industrial Artists and a member of
the Craft Centre of Great Britain.
Appealing in its simplicity, the carpet
has a dark green background with a
restrained pattern in lime and black.
For the observation lounge, situ-
ated immediately beneath the bridge
to allow passengers a Captain’s eye
view of their surroundings, Donald
Brothers, of Dundee, made a specially
designed weave for the chair cover-
ings. These are grouped in three
main colours, Mediterranean blue,
cherry red, and peppermint green. A
coarse thread of black and white in
the weft gives the smart material an
interesting sparkle.
The curtain fabric for the dimng
room is a delightful one, with a crow-
ing cock in lavender and aubergine
as the dominant feature against a
plain background of silver-green. This
colour scheme is picked up in the
floor coverings and the hide chairs.
Verandah Cabins.
In the verandah cabins the settees
and easy chairs have loose covers in
a print of blue, white and Venetian
red designed by Lucienne Day, well
known for her textile designs, and in
one of the cabins de luxe the curtains
are a print designed by “Scottie”
Wilson. He uses strange stylised
birds in gay colours on a grey ground,
set off by borders of deep indigo.
These curtains hang against walls of
Beech veneer the colour of a well-
baked biscuit, and the room has a
close-fitted forest green carpet made
by Stockwells.
These, then ,are the chief decora-
tions which the liner named after the
Spanish and Portuguese Peninsula,
owes to Scotland. It is certain that
they will divert the attention of the
average passenger—if there is such a
person - from the cargo nets, der-
ricks, or boilers, but it also seems
possible that when the weather is hot
and the Thermotank air-conditioning
plant is contributing to his comfort,
or when the sea is rough and the
Denny Brown stabilisers gently correct
a roll of 14° to one of only 2°, he
will learn to appreciate the technical
and engineering contributions of Scot'
land as well as the artistic.
The First “Iberia.”
It is nearly one hundred years since
there was an “Iberia” in the P. 6? O.
The first one was named after the
Iberian Peninsula of Spain and PortU'

“Iberia” was the first ship built to
the Company’s requirements, the
others having been purchased or
hired; she was built at Limehouse in
1836, and was the first P. & O. ship
towed by a Watkins tug, a connection
between the two companies which has
continued ever since.
The first “Iberia” was of 600 tons
and only 155 ft. long, and her side-
lever engines could drive her at a
speed of nine knots. She cost
£22,000. She carried, besides her
captain and three mates, twelve
stewards, three engineers, nine fire-
men and thirteen seamen. She was
sold in 1856 after a useful life spent
mainly in the Mediterranean.

The building comprises four floors,
with an electric lift, and frontage on
Elizabeth Street, running back to
Flinders Qourt. At present it is occu-
pied by Law Somner Pty. Ltd., and
was sold for £66,000.
This purchase is consistent with

All building above ground in this
colossal project has been completed in
little more than twelve months.
In -the Kwinana area, including the

Messrs. Krantz and Sheldon, the
architects who design most flats in
Perth and suburbs, are responsible for
three of the blocks, which have a
total of 81 flats costing £172,000.
The other block of flats has been
designed by Mr. Eric Leach, and will
cost about £45,000.
A three-storey block of nine flats is
to be built in Oturam Street, West
Perth. A tender for £21,440 was
accepted this month from Brine Con'
structions Pty. Ltd. The architects
are Messrs. Krantz and Sheldon.
Towering above the city on elevat'
ed land at the eastern approaches, the
Royal Perth Hospital is being ex'
panded by the addition of two more
eleven-storey wings.
During the construction, two build'
ing techniques have been pioneered.
Glass pipes made of £in.'thick glass
with a 2in. diameter have been used
for drains from sections of the labora'
tories using acids.
Various joints, Y'pieces, and other
sections were manufactured specially
for the job.
It is believed to be the first installa'
tion of its kind in Australia.
To install a lift in the section of
the hospital which is completed and
occupied, architects and builders were
faced with the problem of cutting out
a 10ft. by 14ft. square of concrete
over Ift, thick without making noise.
After experiments and with the
assistance of technicians from a gas'
manufacturing company, a method
was devised using an oxygen lance,
which successfully did the job .
By-Laws Hamper Building.
Architects and builders, hampered
by archaic bydaws differing in various
localities in accordance with the
whims of members of the local

Years ago a committee was ap'
pointed by the Government to draft
these regulations and the work was
finished some months ago, but the
Government has net yet seen fit to
introduce amending legislation.
The Parliamentary session finished

that architects and builders will re'

seven months, when a new session of
Parliament will begin.
Interior glass walls and a pool and

St. Brigid’s Church, Wollongong
Unusual Design and Construction.
This unusual new church built at
the new Wollongong suburb of
Gwynneville has several features of
interest.
It was the first Roman Catholic
church completed in Australia after
the war.
Structurally, the church is unique,
for it is built on a rigid steel frame,
the first time this principle has been
applied to Australian ecclesiastical
architecture.
The reason for this innovation was
that for seven years after the war
ended the N.S.W. Government pro-
hibited the use of common bricks for
churches, these bricks being reserved
for houses and “'priority” projects.
In an attempt to overcome the diffi-
culty, architect Sydney G. Hirst de-
cided to apply to the construction of
the church the rigid steel frame prin-
ciple commonly employed in commer-
cial architecture.
Steel beams, rising up from the
foundations, encased concrete
columns, curved upwards into the
roof in one continuous frame, no roof
trusses being employed. The result-
ant interior profile is unusual and at-
tractive. Externally, the building is
faced with apricot Bulli bricks.
It is of interest to note that St.
Brigid’s had its origin in a war-time
friendship belween Mr. Hirst and the
Rev. Father James Evans, then chap-
lain at 2/5 A.G.H.
It first began at Morotai, where
they collaborated in designing an
Army chapel; it continued after the
war at Wollongong when the grow-
ing South Coast popula'.ion called for
new churches.
U.S. HOUSING EFFORT.
Observers returning from the
U.S.A. say that America is making a
tremendous housing effort, which is
associated with slum clearance.
Many Americans own or are buying
their own homes, especially ex-service-
men. Once a man completes his
selective service he is entitled to hous-
ing assistance.
Near Pittsburgh, new four-room
costing about £A4BOO. Ex-servicemen
brick houses of 795 square feet are
may buy them, without a down pay-
ment for a weekly instalment of
£B/8/- over 25 years.
The houses have a basement, auto-
matic gas furnace and water heater,
copper plumbing, sewerage and ready-
made lawns.
There is also Federal housing on a
huge scale for low-income families.

ing is connected to the existing Col'
lege by an arcaded cloister which
leads directly into the large entrance
foyer and stair hall. From this en'
trance open the large lecture and
and assembly hall, reception parlours,
and the verandah leading to the
masters’ suites and secondary class'
rooms.
The lower ground floor in the
west wing is devoted entirely to stU'
dents’ recreational purposes, while the
three upper floors of the new build'
ing are subdivided to provide stU'
dents’ bedrooms, toilet and shower
blocks, linen rooms, and stair halls.
Hot and cold water services, and fluo'
rescent lighting are being provided
throughout the new building; an elec'
trie dumb water service is also
included.
Individual students’ rooms will each
be fitted with built'in wardrobe, book'
case, and desk units, and all joinery
is to be in polished Queensland maple.
The Australian Institute of Builders
QUEENSLAND CHAPTER.
Address By Mr. Colin O’Domnell.
At the last meeting of the Queens'
land Chapter of the Australian Insti'
tute of Builders, held on October 22,
1954, a guest speaker, Mr. Colin
O’Donnell, of O’Donnell Griffith &
Co. Pty. Ltd., addressed the mem'
bers on matters observed during his
recent visit overseas —in England, the
Continent, and the United States.
Amongst the items of most striking
interest to him as an electrical con'
tractor, and to building contractors,
was the newly'developed technique of
“Q'Floor wiring for electrical services
in large buildings.
Mr. O’Donnell saw this process
being applied during the construction
of the 42'Storey Prudential Assurance
Building in Chicago, which, inciden'
tally, is built over a railway cutting.
Q-Floor Wiring.
Q'Floor wiring consists of electri'
cal fittings and accessories needed to
utilise the cells of Robertson Q'Floors
as raceways for electric conductors.
Q'Floor is a-cellular steel floor forme
of rectangular corrugations which is
laid in interlocking units and welded
to the beams of steel frame build'
ings. They provide both the struc'
tural load'Carrying floor and as race'
ways for the electrical conductors.
Since all cells or rectangular tubes are
available as raceways for wiring, and
are on sixunch centres, outlets for
electrical connections can be installed
in any sixunch area on the floor’s
surface before the concrete is poured.
After that the connections are avail'
able at any time by the removal of a
cap flush with the floor surface.
Great advantages are claimed dur'
ing initial construction and wiring of
a building, and perpetual advantages
in accessibility of connections and
flexibility of future power service
possibilities.
OLD OAK FOR FURNITURE.
Old oak timber recovered from the
demolition of many stately homes of
Old England is being converted by
craftsmen into stately furniture. Some
of this is in demand in America,
where it will doubtless grace new
homes in New England.
(It is to be hoped that although
the timber is old, it will not be used
as an excuse for calling the furniture
“antique,” even though some of the
older skilled craftsmen who made it
might be so called.)

The Eariy Australian Architects
and Their Work
COMPREHENSIVE RECORD OF EARLY BUILDINGS.
Attractive New Book by Morton Herman.
“The Early Australian Architects and
Their Work,” by Morton Her-
man, B.Arch., F.R.A.I.A. 248
pages. Index. Copious references.
126 illustrations in line and
colour. Angus 6? Robertson,
Sydney. Price, £4/4/'.
“Great deference,” says Morton
Herman in his Foreword, “is now
paid to Australian Colonial Architec-
ture, but vague misconceptions of its
spirit ar|J nature have long been
prevalent.
“For lack of authoritative research,
the examples of Colonial buildings
which remain to us are generally
classed together, often wrongly, under
the general heading of ’Old Colonial,’
and only one architect’s name is
known to any appreciable number of
people.
“This book is designed in some
measure to correct this, and to show
not only the early Australian build-
ings themselves, but the background
of history against which they were
erected, the conditions of the people
who built and inhabited them and,
above all, something of the men who
designed them and brought them into
being.”
That the architect-author has suc-
ceeded in his purpose is borne out
by the interest —both human and
architectural—that is found in every
page. Thus a subject that could
reasonably be expected to be rather
specialised in its appeal has, on the
contrary, judging by the excellent
sales, thoroughly captured public
interest.
First Australian Building.
Commencing the cavalcade of
building in this continent, we find
that the first building of any conse-
quence was Government House,
which stood ?,t the corner of Phillip
Street and Bridge Street, Sydney, and
was designed in 1788 by James
Bloodsworth, and, being two-storied,
was a constant wonder to the abori-
ginals as a marvel “in which some
men could be inside and at the same
time be walking over other men’s
heads.”
Everyone appeared to have a very
good opinion of Bloodsworth, who
made the first bricks in the Colony
and carried out a good deal of build-
ing work, and when he died in 1804
he was given the equivalent of a
State funeral by Governor King.
Elizabeth Farm House, erected by
Captain John MacArthur near Parra-
matta in L 794, although altered five
times since, remains as the oldest Aus-
tralian building extant, and a charm-
ing example of a simple farm home-
stead of that time.
Yet another important building of
this period was the Commissiariat
Store on the west side of Sydney Cove,
designed by Lt.-Col. Foveaux, and
obviously built to last, for it was a
familiar landmark at Circular Quay,
till but a few years ago it had to go to
make way for the new Maritime Ser-
vices Building. Its plans in the
Mitchell Library are the oldest Aus-
tralian plans in existence.
Macquarie and Greenway.
Although in this careful analysis of
the development of Australian archi-
tecture a number of names appear, it
is soon obvious that there was no in-
fluence anywhere approaching that of
Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his
architectural protege, Francis Green-
way, for in every respect the contribu-
tion of this oddly-assorted pair was
outstanding and unique.
Macquarie was a remarkable man,
and in the short space of twelve
years by his vision and energy turned
a shoddy little settlement, to use his
own words, “barely emerging from in-
fantile imbecility,” into a young
nation. “It is a measure of his work,”
says the author, “that in all the annals
of the colonial period of the United
States of America, there is not one
man of the stature of Lachlan
Macquarie.”
To Macquarie, Australia was a
young nation in embryo; to his supe-
rior at the Colonial Office in London,
it was but a remote dump for un-
desirable “bodies.” To Macquarie, a
convict who had served his sentence,
and thus paid his debt to society, was
a free citizen of the new land; to the
military caste and the few free settlers,
he was for ever an “old lag” and to
be treated as such. Hence the Mac-
quarie regime was redolent of human
drama, but full of remarkable achieve-
ment.
In Francis Greenway, Macquarie
found the ideal medium to carry out
his developmental schemes, and he
was good and tolerant to this rather
complex but gifted individual. Green-
way, for his part, was indeed fortu-
nate to find such an enthusiastic em-
ployer and partner.,
Greenway, although a pastmaster
in the gentle art of making enemies,
was nevertheless an expert at his
craft, and speaking of one of his out-
standing buildings, St. Matthew’s,
Windsor, the author says that this
building, as does so much of his other
work, convinces one that he had that
touch of genius which would allow
him to work in any medium in any
age. His design has a timeless qual-
ity that is the essence of true beauty.
He was a most industrious worker,
and when one reads the list of
buildings de designed during the
■short space of six years from 1816-
1822, when he held the office of
Civil Architect, one is amazed at his
energy and productiveness, particu-
larly when one realises that to visit
scenes like Windsor, Liverpool and
Parramatta, far from hopping into a
car, he had to do it all on horseback.
One wonders how many present-day
architects would fare with their in-
spections under these conditions. It
seems not unlikely that the builders
may have received a few rough words
at the end of such a trek, as the
plans were, perhaps, perforce examined
on the unfinished mantelpiece.
That the author does not let
Greenway’s architectural skill blind
him to his human failings is obvious
when he says: “He also introduced
into Australia a very old architectural
sport: that of deriding the work of
others active in the same field as him-
self. Architects can admire other
architects’ work if it is at a distance,
but for some reason cannot see any
good in another man’s contributions
to anything with which they themselves
are concerned. Vitruvius, of Ancient
Rome, in his book on ‘Contempo-

rary Architectural Practice,’ showed
that this bad habit was prevalent
there, too.” Don’t put your daughter
on the stage, Mr. Herman!
Early Colonial.
Speaking on the development of
what is known as the Early Colonial
style, Mr. Herman says: “If there
had been only the Georgian influence
at work when the men who were to
become the early Australian architects
were receiving their training in Eng'
land, the story of early Australian
architecture would have been much
more simple, but that time —as it is
to'day—architecture was in a state of
flux.” The Georgian movement had
passed its pinnacle, and a reaction
was selling in, although the first
change was merely a modification
which became known as Regency, in
which Georgian forms continued, but
smooth white stucco shrouded the
glowing red beauty of the brickwork.
Hyde Park Barracks.
Hyde Park Barracks and St.
James’s Church are, perhaps, the
buildings best known to the general
public, and, indeed, many authorities
consider these, particularly the former,
the finest work that he produced.
Studying the plan of the original lay'

ST. MATTHEW'S CHURCH, WINDSOR.
Generally described as a Georgian Church, the author suggests that it would be safer
to classify its architecture as pure Greenway. It was opened for services on Decem-
ber 18, 1822. (This measured drawing was made by Mr. J. B. Sutter when a student at
the Sydney Technical College.)

out of the Barracks, one realises that
Greenway was also greatly skilled in
the planning of open space in relation
to his buildings, as well as in massing,
proportion, and the selection of
materials. What a magnificent oasis
of former days would have remained
for us had the Barracks, with its sur-
rounding 200 ft. by 300 ft. compound
and enclosing walls and buildings,
been maintained as it was planned
and built.
All true lovers of Greenway’s work
would like to see what still remains
of the Barracks, shorn of the shoddy
excrescences of the years between and
restored to its former dignity.
Greenway’s work is adequately
covered in description, drawings,
measured drawings, details and
coloured renderings, and although
these are drawn with skill and
artistry, the magnificent drawings pro-
duced by Hardy Wilson of many of
the Greenway buildings in his
monumental work in 1923 will prob-
ably always remain unsurpassed..
One cannot help feeling a touch of
sadness as we read of the passing of
Greenway on the Hunter River in
18377 apparently lonely and unsung.
The last words of the chapter deal-
ing with his work make a fine
epitaph, and one which all sincere
architects would envy: “He put in-
tegrity of design and building before
all human considerations, and by this
means inevitably created many
enemies—but many beautiful build-
ings. His enemies have gone; his
buildings remain.”
John Watts.
The next figure to emerge is John
Watts, who arrived in Sydney in 1814
as a Lieutenant in the 46th Regi-
ment, and was appointed aide-de-
camp to Governor Macquarie, and
lived at Government House. He had
been “apprenticed” to an architect in
Dublin and was sincerely interested in
this work, when his career was inter-
rupted by the Napoleonic wars and
he became a soldier, as did so many
young architects in 1939. The main
buildings he designed that are still
with us are at Parramatta—old Gov-
ernment House, the well-known twin
spires of St. John’s Church, and the
oldest existing military establishment
in Australia, the Lancer Barracks.
Lennox and His Bridges.
Although not an architect, David
Lennox, a dour Scot and a master
mason, has left a great contribution
to our ancient edifices in the beauti-
ful stone bridges that he designed
and built at Lapstone, Lansdowne,
Parramatta, and elsewhere. They knew
how to build and finance bridges in
those days—in marked contrast to to-
day. Lennox, described in the records
as Superintendent of Bridges, archi-
tect, engineer and builder, received the
THE "RUM HOSPITAL." MACQUARIE STREET. SYDNEY.
Governor Macquarie gave three enterprising businessmen the right to import a
vast quantity of liquor in return for the erection of a hospital for the Colony,
which finally cost the builders some £40,000 to erect. In 1816, as he was not satis-
fied with the progress and construction, Macquarie appointed a committee con-
sisting of Francis Greenway and Messrs. Bryan and Samuel Bradley to inspect and
report on the structure. Greenway found many faults and recommended lo the
Governor a penalty of £l0,000 for breaches of agreement, apart from £5000 for
expenditure on repairs and alterations. After many vicissitudes the building, which
used to be known as the Old Mint, is now the headquarters of the Housing
Commission of N.S.W.
THE MACQUARIE
TOWER AND
LIGHTHOUSE.
One of Greenway's
Masterpieces.
The Macquarie Tower and
Lighthouse, designed and
supervised by Francis
Greenway, was the source
of great delight to Gov-
ernor Lachlan Macquarie.
It was officially opened on
December 16, 1817, when
the Governor gave a party
at the building and on the
same day gave Mr. Green-
way his emancipation, "it
being delivered to him at
Macquarie Tower in the
morning before breakfast."
The original building was
replaced by the present
structure, which follows the
general lines of Green-
way's original design which
stood immediately on the
seaward side of the
present site.

princely salary of <£l2o a year. Lans'
downe Bridge, built in 1836, cost
£lOOO, and yet in its first two years
£l3OO was collected in tolls.
John Verge.
John Verge was an architect of
considerable importance, and the
records show that the list of his
clients reads like a Who’s Who in
the 1830’s, and even the great W. C.
Wentworth gave him commissions.
His Camden Park, built in 1831,
still remains to give us pleasure at
the manner in which it has been lived
in and enjoyed by the one family for
well over a century, which means
something in a land that was virgin
bush devoid of white men but a
hundred and sixty'six years ago.
Elizabeth Bay House was another
of Verge’s works, and its spacious
rooms and beautiful stone elliptical
stair being perhaps the best in Aus'
tralian Colonial architecture. It is
sad to see these fine interiors having
fallen so far from their original
dignity in recent years.
Mortimer Lewis.
Other names appear. Edward Hah
len (Sydney Grammar School), John
Bibb, student of John Verge (Pi t
Street Congregational Church), and
James Hume, but the dominant figure
was Mortimer Lewis, who has left
such buildings in the Classic style as
the Court House at Darlinghurst and
Har ley, and also designed similar
buildings ?t Parramatta, Raymond
Terrace and Newcastle, all of which
have passed away. That he was versa'
tile is evidenced by St. John’s Church,
Camden, which is perhaps the finest
single example of early Gothic Revival
in Australia. Lewis was the last of
the early Colonial architects of Aus'
tralia, the author setting down the
end of the period in the vicinity of
1840.
ELIZABETH BAY HOUSE.
The Splendid Elliptical Staircase.
Our illustration shows the splen-
did elliptical staircase at Eliza-
beth Bay House, Elizabeth Bay,
Sydney, which was designed by
John Verge in 1832. Some years
ago Elizabeth Bay House was
used for wedding receptions and
social functions, and it was quite
the vogue for brides to have
their photographs taken descend-
ing this beautiful staircase. To-
day, unfortunately, the fine old
home is divided Into small

The wealth of detail that has been
encompassed in the volume could
easily become tedious to all but the
avid architectural or historical enthu"
siast, but Herman writes well and
leavens his factual story with many
little touches of humour, such as
when he refers to S. L. Harris, who
succeeded Greenway as Civil Archi"
tect, and says that he was not lucky
in regard to his superior. Major
Ovens, the engineer, “who con"
sidered that the only thing lower
than an architect was a civilian, and
Harris was both.”
Senseless Mutilation.
Herman’s architectural zeal rises to
boiling point with righteous indigna"
tion over the treatment of the old
buildings of his study. ’“No archi"
tecture in the world has been so
maltreated, so senselessly pulled about
as the Colonial architecture of Aus"
tralia,” he rages. “Even the master"
pieces have been treated as though
they were disease-infected.”
He uses the word “mutilated” so
often and so vehemently to describe
this vandalism over the years that
one can well imagine him grinding
his teeth in futile rage to get his
bare hands upon the perpetrators if
he could but encounter them.
At the present time the stream of
architecture is yet again passing
through the whirlpool of change, and
many of the exponents of the new
thought, particularly amongst the
younger generation, can see only in
one direction and would throw over"
board the past entirely. Be this as it
may, some of the early Australian
buildings are fine architecture and as
such will continue to give pleasure
and profit to those who have the eyes
to see. —ADRIAN ASHTON.
BRITISH WAR DAMAGE
PAYMENTS.
£1,115,000,000 Paid.
The War Damage Commission in
Great Britain paid out £338,000,000
during 1953, compared with
£57,000,000 in 1952 and £72,000,000
in 1951. The average weekly rate of
payments in the last quarter of 1953
was £675,000.
The Commission paid 64,000 “cost
of works” claims for repairs during
the year, and made 15,000 payments
on account. The amount involved
was £32,500,000, of which about
£14,500,000 was for the repair and
rebuilding of houses. Other principal
items were: Commercial buildings,
£5,250,000; factories, £4,250,000;
churches, £2,750,000; shops,
£2,250,000. The average individual
payment during 1953 was £5OO, com"
pared with £4lO in 1952 and £342 in
1951. Value payments amounted to
nearly £5,500,000, of which
£1,500,000 related to houses. Greater
London’s share of the total was
£22,000,000.
Total war damage payments by the
Commission now amounts to
£1,115,000,000, in 4,600,000 separate
payments. Contributions by property
owners during and after the war
amounted to nearly £200,000,000,

BURDEKIN HOUSE, MACQUARIE STREET, SYDNEY.
Burdekin House, which was recorded to be one of the finest houses in the Regency style in N.S.W., although
not designed by James Hume, was supervised by him. It is thought that the design came from England. It
was built in 1841 and demolished In 1930, to the great regret of all lovers of our early buildings. It was,
however, supplanted by a church of great purity and charm that will grace Macquarie Street for 100 years.

Royal Visit Decorative
Lighting Award.
In January the Society announced
that an award would be given for the
best decorated and illuminated build'
ing during the Royal Visit. It was
decided to make a separate award for
illuminated arches. A Committee of
twenty'one, under the chairmanship
of Mr. H. G. Fallon, and including
eight prominent citizens who were not
members of the Society, was appoint'
ed. The voting was done by postal
ballot after four sub'eommittees had
selected one, two or three buildings
as the finalists in each section of the
city and suburbs. Another sub'
committee had selected the four best
illuminated arches out of the eleven
which were erected. In the building
section, Mark Foys Ltd., in Liverpool
Street, was awarded first place, with
Philips Electrical Industries Ltd.,
Clarence Street, a close second. Of
the arches, the one sponsored by the
Chamber of Manufacturers in Mac'
quarie Street, was placed first, and the
Commonwealth Bank Arch in Martin
Place second. The awards, illuminat'
ed certificates, were presented to the
winners by the Premier, the Hon. J.
J. Cahill, at a special luncheon held at
Mark Foys, on February 25, which
was attended by about 200 persons.
Press and radio publicity was excel'
lent, and the Society gained con'
siderable prestige by obtaining a
wider recognition in the community.
Much of the credit for the success of
this undertaking until the first week
only to the members of the panel of
judges, but also to other members of
the Society who were responsible for
the publicity and general enthusiasm
which the event provoked.
Lighting Exhibition.
In order to celebrate the 75th anni'
versary of the invention of the modern
incandescent lamp, the Society de'
cided to hold an Exhibition showing
the development of the incandescent
lamp and modern lighting fittings.
A meeting was called of all Sus'
taining Members to discuss this pro'
ject, and it was decided to engage
the services of Mr. Harry Seidler,
Architect, to plan a suitable layout.
This layout was submitted at a sub'
sequent meeting of the Sustaining
Members, and it was decided to hold
the Exhibition at the Sydney County
Council Showrooms from Ist to sth
November, 1954.
Sustaining Members were ap'
proached for financial support, and
this was promised by the majority of
members in a very enthusiastic
manner.
However, owing to the lack of
time properly to organise this Exhibi-
tion, it was finally decided to defer
this undertaking unti Ithe first week
in May, 1955.
At the time of this Annual Report,
material is being obtained from both
America and England for the Exhibi
tion.
Technical Education.
Two courses have been operating
in Illumination at the N.S.W. Univer'
sity of Technology during 1954.
Illumination I commenced the year
with about 30 students, of which 25
are still attending.
Illumination II has operated as fob
lows: There were no lectures in
Term 1. During Term 2, students
attended a course known as Labora'
tory Arts IV, covering the subjects of
Photometry and Colorimetry, which is
also taken by other students. It con'
sists of eight two'hour lectures and
four laboratory periods. Term 3 is
devoted to Vision (given by the
Optometry Department), and is a
special course. The group started
with 16 students (of whom about half
were also taking Illumination I con'
currently), and is now reduced to 11.
Arrangements are in hand for
courses in Illumination 111 to be
offered during 1955. With a view to
giving lectures to school children in
Lighting, script and lantern slides
have been obtained from England, as
has similar material from the U.S.A.
Standards 8C Codes.
The Convener of the Standards
and Codes Committee reports that
the Standards Association of Aus'
tralia, Draft Revision of A.S. No.
(E) CA.501, SAA Artificial Lighting
Code, has been under review in all
States for the past fifteen months and
that this review is now nearing com'
pletion.
With regard to enquiries received
from the Standards Association con'
cern ing the use of the word “lumi'
naire in lieu of “lighting fitting,”
it was decided that this Society would
raise no objection to such substitution,
and the Standards Association was so
advised.
Design Tables.
During the year 1953/54, work on
the Design Tables was continued in
accordance with the plan of 16 sec'
tions, as follows: Units and Funda'
mental Relationship; Light Sources;
Materials; Interior Lighting Practice;
Interior Lighting Design; Architects
ral Lighting; Display Lighting; Elec-
trie Signs; Natural Lighting; Flood'
lighting; Sports Lighting; Street
Lighting; Ultraviolet; Colour; Vision;
Mathematical.
Typing facilities were difficult to
obtain, but the majority of sections
have been completed, and at the
Meeting of Council on September 9,
1954, Sections 3,4, and 10 were
tabled. These sections are complete
and ready for printing. Other sections
are in the process of being typed.
Official Journal and
I.E.S. Lighting Review.
A full record of the activities of the
Society has appeared each month in
the official journal, “Building:
Lighting: Engineering,” and once
again your Council expresses its ap'
precialion to the Publishers for their
continued cooperation. The “I.E.S.
Lighting Review” has been published
bi'monthly, as usual, and several
articles have been submitted from
N.S.W.
Public Relations
and Publicity.
Your Public Relations and Publicity
Committee can again look back on a
year of considerable activity. This
Committee has maintained a constant
liaison with kindred bodies, editors of
trade journals, the daily Press, and
broadcasting stations.
During the year, the Committee
has kept in constant touch with mem'
bers through the Societies’ news'
sheet “Sidelights,” which is the com'
bined effort of all P.R. and P.
Committeemen.
Lectures have been arranged and
include a talk presented to the Cer'
tifi cates Electricians’ Association of
N.S.W. by Mr. W. A. Smith and
two radio interviews with Mr. H. G.
Fallon, one with the Macquarie
Roundsman, Mr. Bill Weir, over 2GB,
and one over the A.B.C. on Station
2BL in the session “New South Wales
Magazine.”
Articles, reports of meetings, and
the activities of the Society have been
regularly supplied to our Official Jour'

Membership and Social.
The most important function of
your Committee this year was the
arranging of the luncheon meeting at
which the 1954 Meritorious Lighting
Award was presented. At this func'
tion, which was linked with the visit
of Her Majesty the Queen to Syd'
ney, we were honoured by the pre'
sence of the N.S.W. Premier, and
other notable civic dignitaries. We
are grateful to Mark Foys for an ex'
cellent meeting.
Your CommiLtee has been fortu'
nate in obtaining permission to hold
our Annual General Meeting in the
Students’ Union, University of Syd'
ney, and our thanks are due to the
Students’ Council for this permission.
Our Annual Dinner which is being
held in the Sutherland Room of the
Union, is also due to the kindness of
the Students’ Council.
Our regular meetings have been
highly successful; we are particularly
grateful to see such a large number
of visitors at each meeting, and your
Committee is hopeful that some of
these visitors will become future
members of the Society. Two ladies’
nights have been held, both of which
were well attended.
Secretarial and Finance.
The Balance Sheet as at September
30, 1954, and the Revenue Accounts
for the year ended at that date are in
the usual form and are attached here'
to. A new item appears on each side
of the Balance Sheet in respect of
subscriptions received for the Light'
ing Exhibition. These moneys and
the expenses to be paid therefrom are
being kept entirely separate from the
ordinary funds of the Society. Owing
to the reduction in membership—to
which reference has already been
made the gross income from fees
was approximately .£4B less than for
the previous year. Expenses in aggre'
gate were £2l less than a year ago,
savings being effected under the
headings of “Socials and Suppers”
and “Annual Dinner.” However,
after writing off £46/0/5 for depre'
ciation on the Lighting Exhibit, the
nett deficit for the year amounted to
£l7/15/9. Accumulated Funds show
a total increase of £7/17/7, which is
made up as follows: —
Entrance Fees £9 9 0
Newcastle C h a p t e r
Surplus for Year .... £l6 4 4
£25 13 4
LESS: Deficit for Year £l7 15 9
£7 17 7
Papers.
The following papers were pre'
sented to members and visitors during
the year: —
October 1, 195 3: “The Role of
Lighting in Accident Prevention,
Mr. S. D. Lay (Member).
March 4, 1953: “Light and Crime
Detection,” Det.'Constable Merchant.
April 1, 1954: “Travelling Through

Library.
During the year 1953/54, no new
books were recommended to the
Municipal Library for purchase. Issues
of “Illuminating Engineering” and
(jther publications have not yet been
bound and placed on the shelves for
public use. Unfortunately, during the
year complaints have been received
from members because desired books,
known to be in the possession of the
library, were not available for loan.
The matter was taken up by tele'
phone, and shortage of staff was
given as the reason for the delay.
The same subject has been brought
up again, and, at the time of compib
ing this report, a further approach is
to be made to the Librarian.
Mrs. Florence M. Taylor kindly
offered to donate to the Society part
of her extensive library of text books.
The offer was accepted with thanks,
and the books were subsequently re'
ceived. They are now being re'
packed for forwarding to the Sydney
Municipal Library.
Committees.
All Committees functioned actively,
and the following personnel com'
prised the respective Standing Com'
mittees as at the end of the year: —
Executive and Finance Committee:
G. Y. Falk (Convener), G. C. T.
Brown, L. S. Hyatt, J. E. Cooper, T.
H. McCourt and A. E. Deegan.
Public Relations and Publicity Com'
mittee: M. Craker (Convener), T. H.
McCourt, P. J. Grundfest, A. E.
Deegan, F. C. Whiddon and E. L.
Freedman.
LINES AND SHAPES IN DECORATIVE EFFECTS.
Built-in decorations of walls and ceilings, by contrasting patterns worked Into the surface formation, are increasing in popu-
larity in Europe. The modern technique as applied to concrete construction, as well as aluminium sheathing, is illustrated
here in the contrasting and blending of lines, squares and circles as aids in illumination. Left: Square lighting recesses in an
otherwise plain wall and ceiling surface become sources of illumination in this large restaurant. Centre: Circles cut out of
plain aluminium panels may be used with hidden lights to form contrasting coloured light sources from the near side. Right.
Corrugated aluminium itself provides decorative effects with straight lines overhead, enhanced by light apertures in the
cornices and central fittings to relieve an otherwise too rigid formal appearance.

on record its appreciation of Mr.
Maclurcan’s service to the Society in
the many positions he occupied, both
as National Councillor and as a mem'
ber of the N.S.W. Council. It is
also recorded with regret that Mr. K.
A. Mainwaring will not be a candh
date for election to the 1954/55
Council.
In conclusion, your Council desires
to thank members for their support
and co'operation during the year. As
to the future, your Council believes
that the need for the Society is as
great as, if not greater than, ever.
The fullest possible support is asked
from every member to ensure the
success of the Lighting Exhibition to
be held in May, 1955.
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
By Mr. G. Y. FALK,
Retiring President, The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia, N.S.W.
Delivered at the Twenty-fourth Annual General Meeting Held at Union Hallj
University of Sydney, on November 11, 1954.
It has been my privilege and
pleasure to be ranked among the
members of this Society for the past
sixteen years and to know most of the
past leaders of the Society personally.
I recall many of the distinguished
names of your Past Presidents who
have brought the Society to the stand'
ing it now holds in the community.
With your first President, Mr.
Turnbull, are associated the names of
Williams, Fallon, Harmer and Forbes,
all of whom are still actively inter'
ested in the affairs of the Society,
twenty-four years after the inaugura'
tion of the i.E.S.
I am really staggered that so much
has been achieved in such a short
space of time. Some of the Society’s
highlights that come to my mind are
the incorporation of the Society as a
registered company in 1934, which
must have required an enormous
amount of work.
In 1938, valuable assistance was
given by the Society to the Sesqui'
Centenary Celebrations, and in that
year it erected a stand in the Radio
and Electrical Exhibition.
A year later the first lighting publi'
cation, “The Street Lighting Code,”
was produced after three years’ work,
the majority of that work being car'
ried out by I.E.S, members.
In 1941 the Illumination Course at
the Sydney Technical College was
commenced and after thirteen years
is still in operation.
The year 1942 saw the appearance
of th<jt famous publication, “The
S.A.A. Emergency Lighting Code for
the Interior Illumination of Build'
ings.”
Between 1942 and 1946, many
changes took place—the Queensland
Chapter was formed, later to become
a separate State Society; the sterling
services of Mr. Reg. Vickery were
obtained for the Society as its Secre-
tary, and the inaugural meeting of
the Federal Body the National
Council of the Illuminating Engineer'
ing Societies of Australia—was held.
In 1947 the advanced courses in
illumination were commenced at the
Sydney Technical College. I will
always remember the first complete
three'year course. Wi.h 56 students
in the first year, only four of this
original class were able successfully to
weather the perils of the annual
examinations. The students had to
face a team of nine lecturers in the
final year, each of whom was an
expert in his own particular field. I
am certain the instructors, many of
whom are here this evening, enjoyed
the experience, although I cannot say
exactly the same for those who had
to listen and learn. As a recommenda'
don to the examiners, I would sug'
gest that the lecturettes given by the
students in the final year should be
delivered at a general meeting of the
Society.
The year 1948 was the memorable
visit of Sir Clifford Patterson, and the
following year the Newcastle Chapter
was formed and classes commenced at
the Newcastle College.
1950—1 remember well the visit to
the “Orcades” and Hal Chadwick’s
momentous task in interesting the elec'
tricity undertakings in our work. The
twenty'first birthday of the I.E.S. was
celebrated in 1951, and was a year of
consolidation, with Jack Knight at
the helm.
With Ernest Freedman at the head
of an enthusiastic Council, 1952 was
a year of great activity. National
Council issued membership and feh
lowship certificates, the Health Week
Exhibition Stand was constructed and
exhibited, and the first I.E.S. Award
for Meritorious Lighting was awarded
to Telephone Electrical Industries
for an industrial installation.
George Brown was daring enough
to mix ‘’light with cosmetics” at the
Ladies’ Night in 1953 and was able
at the same time to convene the
Interior Illumination Code Review
Committee. The I.E.S. Award for
Meritorious Lighting was again held,
and the Society’s exhibit travelled to
Hawkesbury College.
To all these Presidents I owe a debt
of gratitude for the sound policy that
they had established to guide me in
the future.
I was indeed fortunate that I had

enthusiastic Councillors who never
failed to respond to any call, and those
wise advisors whom I relied on to
keep the ancient usages and customs
of the Society in proper perspective.
To all Councillors and Members, I
thank you for the support you have
given. To our Sustaining Members, a
special “thank you” for your financial
aid. The thanks of the Society are
due to our Secretary, Reg. Vickery,
whose sound grasp of the Society’s
role in the community has been of
great benefit to us all. The activities
of the Society during the past year
have been marked by some achieve'
ment. Firstly, it was a great year of
great gladness to us all, in that Her
Majesty the Queen was pleased to
visit our shores.
Our membership shows a total of
262. The decline of 12 Associates
during the past year has been due
mainly to lack of new Associates being
brought into the Society.
The Newcastle Chapter held eight
meetings during the year, and I was
pleased to visit the Chapter during
one of its meetings in July. Deep
concern, however, is felt at the fall-
ing off in membership and attendances
at meetings. As a recommendation to
the incoming Council, a roster of
Sydney members should be made so
that the Society would have a Sydney
member or Councillor in attendance
at all Chapter Meetings. This would
help to weave a closer bond between
the Society and the Chapter. A spe'
cial effort should be made to recharge
local enthusiasm in Newcastle with
specially'selected speakers and pro'
gramme.
Considerable prestige was gained
by the Society through the Royal
Visit Decorative Lighting Award, and
the Press and radio publicity placed
the name of the Society before a
wider public audience than ever
before.
A special luncheon at Mark Foys,
at which the Premier, Mr. J. J.
Cahill, presented the awards, was a
unique occasion in the Society’s
history.
It has been a personal disappoint'
ment to me that the I.E.S. Lighting
Exhibition has been postponed till
May next year. I must express the
thanks of the Society to all those Sus'
taining Members who have promised
liberal financial help, and to the Syd'
ney County Council for its offer of its
showrooms. Frequent correspondence
with the Societies of America and
Great Britain resulted in wonderful
co-operation from these bodies in
material and information. I am sure
that this Exhibition will be a mile'
stone in the history of the Society.
Everything is now in hand to com'
mence the lighting talks in the
schools. Excellent material has been
received from the United States of
America and Great Britain, and this
will be adapted to local conditions.
However great our progress has
been during the past 26 years, I
believe that the need for the Society
is greater to'day than ever before. We
find ourselves established in the com'
munity, friendly among companion
organisations, among architects, opto'
metrists, electrical contractors, and
others.
However, the objects of the Society
must be made more widely known to
the public and to our communal lead'
ers, and our code of ethics more firmly
fixed in the minds of our members.
Are we using our technical know-
ledge for the creation of better seeing
conditions and better lighting fittings,
or are we finding the easy way to
comply with the very minimum re'
quirements of the codes? Bright and
glaring chandeliers are still manufac'
tured in huge quantities that have no
rightful place in home, commerce or
industry. Many of our designs are
out of step with the tools at our dis'
posal. Are we to be satisfied with
any one type of fitting that can be
adapted “at a pinch” for any lighting
task? If the Society is to endure, its
members must continue to strive for
the ultimate in design and the applh
cation of our lighting knowledge.
The avoidance of petty commer
cialisms or any serious evasions of the
truth in all our undertakings will
keep our character high in the con'
fidence of our fellow'man.
Illuminating Engineering is a very
personal matter —it deals with people
and directly with one of their most
precious possessions, the gift of sight.
No other engineering profession has
this task. It means more than the
mere installation of fittings and the
control of lighting flux. It is the
direct study of all the complex and
difficult task of vision.
This is my concept of the aims and
objects of the Illuminating Engineer'
ing Society, and thus re'enthuse our
spirits so as to bring to our fellow'
man hope for the easement of to'
day’s mounting strains on vision.
The solution, better and still better
lighting.
Now having given you my views
on the Society and its aims and
objects as seen by me after my year s
Presidency, it is my pleasing duty to
hand over this office to our new
President. It has been a privilege to
have had the opportunity to fill this
position during the past year, and I
thank you for the trust you placed in
my guardianship. I would like to
thank each and every one of the
Councillors for their loyalty to me
during the year.
I once moved a resolution in Coun'
cil that the office of President should
be not less than two years. It was
soundly defeated by opposition of
some of the Past Presidents. My own
conviction in this regard, after
occupying the Chair for twelve
months, has been weakened con'
siderably.
The task for the President of this
Society is not an easy one, and re'
quires much personal sacrifice. How'
ever, I am certain that for sound
judgment, accurate engineering know'
ledge, and a profound insight into
the Society’s activities we have no
one to excel our new President, Len
Hyatt.
With Len Hyatt at the helm of
our ship in 195 5, he will steer a
course that will not only keep us
afloat, but will make good headway
and bring a brighter future to this
Society and the community in
general.
HOLIDAY LECTURES ON
ARCHITECTURE.
The New Coventry Cathedral.
Every year the R.1.8.A. has a
series of Christmas Holiday Lectures
for young girls and boys. This year,
two informal lectures will be given
during the Christmas holidays by Mr.
Basil Spence, 0.8. E., A.R.A.,
F.R.1.8.A., the subject of the lec'
tures being “Coventry Cathedral: The
Bir.h and Growth of the Idea.” They
will be illustrated by lantern slides
and followed by questions and
discussion.
The first lecture will show how the
planning of a modern cathedral is
really a matter of tradition and how
all our traditional buildings were
modern when they were first de'
signed. Durham and Gloucester with
its great east window, Ravenna and
Albi were all buildings of their own
time. The new Coventry Cathedral
conforms to this tradition of church
building and, like the old cathedrals,
is based on the temple plan.
The second lecture will explain in
detail the design of Coventry Cathe'
dral and point out the meaning of all
the different parts of the plan—the
Guild Chapel, the Chapel of Unity,
the great west screen, the stained
glass windows, and the tapestry rising
behind the altar.
A Perth, W.A., schoolmaster said
if he searched all his pupils he guessed
he would find £lOOO. Parents find it
easier to give money than companion'
ship to their children.

CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE
GLEN WAVERLEY, VICTORIA.
First Section To Cost £806,000.
The commencement of the erec-
tion of Corpus Christi College at
Glen Waverley, Victoria, is one of
the most extensive of its kind in
Victoria. [We illustrate a perspective
drawing of this ambitious project on
our cover.]
The present plans are for the erec-
tion of the Chapel and Tower and
the Administration Offices, in con-
junction with the wing to the left of
the Central Administration Block, for
a contract figure of approximately
£806,000.
The Seminary is destined for the
training of diocesan priests for the
Archdiocese of Melbourne and Hobart
and for the Dioceses of Ballarat,
Sandhurst and Sale.
At the setting of the foundation-
stone ceremony a parchment was en-
closed in a copper cylinder and
bedded under the foundation stone.
The following is an extract from the
historical data set out in the parch-
ment:
“The Ceremonial Blessing and Set-
ting of the Foundation Stone of this
Theological Seminary was
performed on Sunday afternoon of
the Twenty-eight of November 1954,
by His Grace the Most Rev. Daniel
Mannix, Archbishop of Melbourne.”
The plans and specifications of the
Seminary were prepared by Mr. Cyril
C. Kelly, A.R.1.8.A., A.R.A.1.A.,
Architect, and the construction of the
building was entrusted to Messrs. W.
C. Burne 6? Sons Pty. Ltd., Master
Builders.
W.A. OIL ERA.
A new era for Fremantle and
Western Australia will begin on
January 11, when a 16,000-ton tanker
will cut a flag-decked cord to open
Cockburn Sound.
The tanker will be the first to use
the access channel to the new
Kwinana refinery ietty. About 200
tankers are expected to use the chan-
nel in 1955.
LESS QUEENSLAND STATE
HOME-BUILDING.
Weather, Financial Restrictions
Blamed.
Fifteen per cent, fewer Queensland
State Housing Commission homes
were built in the last financial year
than in 1952-53.
In 1953-54, 2105 houses were built
and 1263 were in various building
stages at June 30.
In 19 5 2-5 3, 2307 houses were
built, and 2022 were being built at
June 30, 1953.
Reasons given in the annual report
were that abnormal wet weather and
financial restrictions had limited
operations.
The 1953-54 programme could not
be prepared until the finance became
available, the report said.
In 1953-54, tenders for 265 houses
had been accepted in the metropoli-
tan area, but only a small sum had
been spent on the houses.
At June 30, 2142 imported houses
had been completed, and 419 were
being built, the report added.

December 24, 1954.


BUILDING IN AMERICA
By Mr. G. A. WINWOOD. J.P., F.A.I.B., F.A.I.M.,
Federal Vice-President and Immediate Past President Victorian Chapter,
Belivered to the Victorian Chapter of the Australian Institute of Builders
on November 3, 1954.
(This meeting was the first of the Chapter’s late afternoon gatherings which
commenced at 4.45 p.m., and, after general business a buffet tea was served
at 5.30, and the meeting resumed at 6.30 for the Guest bpeaker.)
One cannot think of America with-
out immediately visualising tall build-
ings and taller buildings called sky-
scrapers. Passing from city to city one
cannot get away from the immensity
of the magnificently constructed and
beautifully proportioned buildings.
One is proud to be associated with an
industry which employs all sections
of labour —unskilled to the highly
skilled —as well as the architect and
the engineer, and these two profes-
sions in America, have, I think, made
the greatest contribution the revolu-
tionising of building design.
The method that has been evolved
in the U.S.A. supplies, in my judg-
ment, the answer to the search for an
efficient and economical method for all
types, large and small. I must at this
stage, digress and comment on the
lack of liaison and co-operation in our
country where so little is done to en-
sure an even, pre-arranged flow of
materials, and to a lesser extent, plan-
ning of the work of the sub-con-
tractors, with the result that it in-
variably finishes up in a scramble and
a muddle. In fairness, one must say
that it is not always the builder’s
fault, being mainly due to non-co-
operative suppliers.
To continue, American success lies
not in men and machinery but in or-
ganisation, control of sub-contractors
and supply of the right materials pre-
cisely when required.
Many times, I have preached co-
operation upon which the success of
any new project depends, and this in
U.S.A. is practiced very extensively.
To work out the completion of a large
building, a conference is held, attend-
ed by the owner, architect, engineer,
equipment engineer and the contractor.
Following this, the contractor gives an
approximate cost of the work and
then, the architect draws up the final
working drawings and details upon
which the builder submits his firm
estimate, along with a time and pro-
gress schedule, which schedule I will
explain later. My attention was par-
ticularly drawn to the fact that the
architect does not regard himself as
a superior factor in the finished job,
but is essentially one of the team.
Time and Progess Schedule.
The Time and Progress Schedule,
as used in America, does not I think,
contain anything new and there is no
mystery about it, but the method of
using it is on a very grand scale; gives
the whole of the building operation
and its many sub-trades and thus
enables the foreman to carry out the
job without delay.
Before the building is started, this
schedule is drawn up following the
series of conferences at which the
architect, builder, and owner have got
together and agreed upon all the de-
tails of the job and the attendant sub-
trades and have allotted a time and
date for completion. It is considered
that this is the only way to achieve
rapid development and economic
cost, and it also means that the opera-
tion of building the structure is
worked as a team.
Through this system of time and
progress scheduling, great savings are
made, and I envisage that the cost of
labour expended on a building similar
in type to one in Australia would
not be more in spite of the much
higher wages paid.
General.
When inspecting a large building
in Washington (then well on towards
completion), I was surprised to learn
that this building was working to
within a matter of hours of its initial
schedule; pre - mixed concrete was
flowing in as if on a production line
in a factory; just sufficient time to
clear No. 1 when No. 2 was ready
to discharge. Likewise, structural steel
deliveries were made on the time and
date scheduled for erection and were
immediately placed in position. Very
rarely did one see concrete or brick-
work being cut out for piping, etc.,
this work being always ahead of
construction.
Workmen get much more than
our men, the average wage for a
skilled tradesman being three dollars
twenty cents to four dollars per hour,
and from all appearances they do not
work harder than our men, and, per-
haps, in many cases are not as pro-
ficient, but, generally, are aided by
more mechanical tools and certainly a
far superior finish and quality of
materials with which to work.
In response to my comment on the
cleanliness of the job and the lack of
surplus material, I was informed that
this was a very necessary part of the
plant to run to schedule.
Large building is mainly a job of
assembly, and this is a vital factor in
reducing costs. Steel framing, plumb-
ing, general piping, heating and the
many components that can be made,
are made off the site and are de-
livered to the site as scheduled and
immediately fixed in position. This
calls for a competent overseer to
keep reports and to ‘ follow-up with
the many firms supplying the job.
Everything that can be done away
from the job is done. Each sub-
contractor, under his contract, has to
keep the building contractor informed
as to the progress of the work he has
in hand in accordance with the
schedules furnished and conferences
are held frequently between the archi-
tect, contractor and sub-contractor.
When the architect has accepted
the builder’s estimate for the work,
it become the builder’s responsibility
to engage all sub-contrac.ors, and
this the builder does after all avenues
have been explored in open competi-
tion, and this system, of course, keeps
the many trades associated with build-
ing on their toes.
There exists in America a vast
sys'.em of finance, bankers lending at
five per cent., insurance companies
at a slightly higher rate perhaps
five and a half per cent. brokers
underwriting first mortgage issues and
selling to the public, carrying an
average return of six per cent. These
financial institutions realise that build-
ing is a job vital to the prosperity of
the countrv.
My brief summing-up is as follows:
1. The skyscraper has set up a
standard of efficiency and economy
within the art of building that we
can afford to emulate.
2. If I were to try and summarise
all the lessons learnt during this visit
abroad, I feel that most builders
would be tempted to say there was a
place for me elsewhere. (You know
the one about jumping in the lake!)
3. It appears difficult to set up a
co-partnership scheme in Australia,
in the interests of building.
4. We must be courageous and
bold in our approach to the job in
hand and endeavour to abolish these
after-thoughts such as extras, varia-
tions, etc., which definitely retard pro-
gress and generally mean a loss of
revenue to the builder through the
inherent disorganisation they occasion.
5. Time and progress scheduling is
a “must.”
6. The building industry in
America receives a definite support
from Government and financial
bodies, and is not encumbered with a
lot of obsolete building laws. Build-
ing Acts and Regulations are amend-
ed to suit modern needs.
7. The building code in Australia
should be far more flexible and not
allowed to become stereotyped, as
this so seriously retards and obstructs
development.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


8. I advise, very the need
far a central building authority, en-
tirely divorced from any Government
or civic control, which could amend
and frame building laws to meet the
rapid changes we encounter to-day,
and thus assist in reducing building
costs ,
9. Standardisation in materials, pip-
ing and fittings as the means to
achieving efficiency and economy.
10. The “cost plus fixed fee” con-
tract is very much in evidence both
in England and America, particularly
for large works. It is found that
under such a scheme the construction
of the building and the purchasing
of the specialised items are not limit'
ed to the experience of the architect,
but also profit as a result of the con’
tractor’s vast purchasing organisa'
tion. In some cases, the amount
saved on the original estimate is
divided equally between the builder
and the owner, thus providing the
builder with the added incentive to
give his undivided attention to all
aspects and more rapid construction,
etc.
11. It was very noticeable that con'
struction is very much lighter than
ours. Lighter steel sections and of
fewer sizes, with the result that many
are interchangeable.
12. One thing that greatly im-
pressed me was the intensive competi-
tion between suppliers and between
sub - contractors, and that, generally,
there is no favoured firm. On the
whole, much more sub-contracting is
done than in Australia. Items such
as concrete formwork and the plac-
ing of the concrete and many other
such separate items in construction,
are sub-let.
Lobbying.
The principal building organisation
in New York is the Building Trades
Employers’ Association. The function
of this Association is public relations
and the education of members in re-
gard to all building problems, and
lobbying for their interest. Lobbying,
so-called, is a profession, and these
lobbyists are registered by the Govern-
ment.
“Feather Bedding.”
The problem that confronts build-
ers in America is that of “feather
bedding.” Various sub-trades keep a
representative on the job at all times,
whether required or not, during the
construction. These would include an
electrician, etc., and where a fair
amount of machinery is being used,
an experienced mechanic must be on
duty at all times. He appears to spend
most of his time sitting, waiting for a
call.
Large Buildings.
Before making any observations on
housing, I would like to give you a
few details of some of the largest
buildings in America (in the order
in which I visited them), all built to
a time and progress schedule:—
Empire State Building, New York:
The largest and greatest of sky-
scrapers, 1250 ft. high, 85 storeys,
36.000. cu. ft. in content. Com-
menced, April, 1930; finished, May,
1931. Everything that I have already
said about liaison was exemplified
here. As an example, I will give you
some idea of the materials used:—
58,000 tons of steel, 10,000,000
common bricks, 3,000,000 face bricks,
3.000. sq. ft. of steel mesh,
2.000. cu. ft. of limestone facing,
70,000 cu. yds. of concrete.
Rockefeller Centre, New York;
1250 ft. high, completed fourteen
months after excavation was taken
out, at a cost of 2/6 per cu. ft.
Chrysler Building, New York:
Second largest building in New York,
1030 ft. high. Magnificent pyramid of
stainless steel on top of tower.
The Woolworth Building: Is called
the cathedral of commerce, and work-
shop for 15,000 people. In the course
of one year, 12,000,000 people pass
through, and every week-day 150,000
pieces of mail are delivered to the
tenants. It is 792 ft. high, with 29
PITTSBURGH (U.S.A.) MILLION-DOLLAR AIRPORT HANGAR.
Twelve giant three-hinged steel trusses spanning 278 feet from the arched roof of
the new hangar at Greater Pittsburg Airport. The trusses are each four feet wide
and vary in depth from 8 to 14 feet. These were assembled on the ground, having
been previously fitted in the fabricating shop, and lifted into position by two jib
cranes. The twelve arches are covered with deep ribbed galvanised sheeting, with
fibreglass insulating board suspended on the underside.
Top: Side view of a completed truss lifted into position by the jib cranes. Below:
A near view of the arched roof over one-half of the hangar, formed by six trusses
with longitudinal bracing.

speed lifts and two express lifts from
the ground to the 54th storey, which
rise at 700 ft. per minute or at a
speed of eight m.p.h. It is like most
other modern skyscrapers of to'day,
built entirely of fi mate'
rials, and is supported on 60 oassions
100 ft. deep.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Build'
ing: 700 ft. high and 72ft. below
ground level; Singer Building; 612 ft.
high; Savoy Plaza Hotel; New York
Hospital; R.C.A. Building; N.Y.
Central Station; N.Y. Life Insurance
Building; Irving Trust Co. Building;
McGraw'Hill Building; Montreal:
Aldred Building, Sun Life Building;
Toronto: Royal Oak Hotel; Chicago:
Palnti'Olive Building, Tubine Build'
ing, “Daily News” Building, Marshall
Fields; Detroit: General Motors
Building, Union Trust Building; Los
Angeles; City Hall.
All the buildings have been exe'
cuted with the greatest speed and
economy by the medium of the time
and progress schedule. I would, at
this stage, like to mention one of the
most beautiful pieces of architecture
in the U.S.A., namely, the Baha’i
Temple in Illinois. This is
mainly a precast building of which
all the patterns were first cast in
plaster by sculptors, the final casting
being a mixture of white cement and
ground crystal quartz, and the result'
ing sections of casting were hung in
place. The work on the superstruc'
ture began in 1930 and was complet'
ed in 1952. It was built at a cost of
2,623,000 dollars, seating capacity
12,000, height 19lft„ and is support'
ed on cassions 120 ft. deep, its per'
forated dome being 30%, and the
nuiqiber of perforated sections 487.
Because the design is extremely un-
usual, people try to find a single term
for its architecture Egyptian,
Romanesque, Arabic, Renaissance,
etc., but this has not yet been done.
The architectural requirement in the
Baha’i’s teaching is that the temple
must have nine sides, nine being the
largest single number and symbolising
comprehensiveness and unity.
Housing.
To'day, we are paying the penalty
for inadequate and unsound planning
for a rapidly'growing population, re'
suiting in traffic congestion and con'
centration in business and industry.
Most cities in America have already
experienced this and are rapidly
remedying this chaotic condition.
At a conference held in Washing'
ton by the National Association of
Home Builders, a paper was submitted
by Walter E. Hoadley, economist,
and from this I quote; —
“For several years it has been
widely predicted that home building
and construction generally, would
lead the nation into economic reces-
sion, with the end of the post-war
building boom. Yet here, m the
spring of 1954, the building industry
is regarded on all sides as a major
bulwark to the national economy.
Satellite communities have devcl-
oped outside a number of cities with
the aid of the State and Federal
Authorities, and private enterprise.
Commercial and industrial establish'
ments have taken advantage of areas
adjacent, and these new developments
are not only conducive to better hV
ing conditions, but greatly add to the
contentment of the people by pro-
viding better family environment. A
survey and study of family incomes
was made to determine the class and
type of housing best suited. These
surveys were made in the neighbour'
hood of New York, particularly the
down-town end facing the Hudson
River, Brooklyn, Harlem, Wheaton
(Chicago), Buffalo. Niagara Falls,
and many other cities, and the New
York State pioneered the develop'
ment of. State-aided housing for its
many lowdncome people, to replace
its crowded slums. As its major prob-
lem was to house the people during
the period of building, temporary
accommodation was erected. The
whole scheme proved very successful,
but was costly. In some cities, the
public housing administration is per'
mitting the sale of single and duplex
homes to encourage home ownership,
but as there is a fear that these
multiple dwellings may deteriorate
into slums, they will always be con'
trolled by the authorities.
Without question, home building
in Australia qualifies as one of the
nation’s most promising “growths”
and is capable of expansion at least
until 1960. Therefore, tremendous
opportunities exist for private enter'
prise to enter this field of construe'
tion. Until such time as this happens,
there is little chance of the so much
talked of slum clearances and the ne'
cessary repairs to neglected dwellings
(which are rapidly falling into the
slum class) being undertaken.
What seems to be required is the
general adoption of a sound method
of long-term financing. Considerable
home building is being lost to-day
because of the inability of horrie-
seekers to arrange satisfactory long-
term loans.
At the present moment, I feel that
the builders should give a lead in
this direction, in conjunction with
some of our extremely wealthy Life
Comoanies. This would add vreatly
to their goodwill and allow their
policy-holders to enjoy some of the
benefit of a mutual benefit society.
I do not propose to pursue this
point any further at the present, but
will content myself by giving some
data on the activity and investment
of the Metropolitan Life Co. in
America, and to say how very much
impressed I am with their success.
This Company is one of the largest
private investors in home building,
having housed some 34,174 families
at an expenditure of 300,000,000 dob
lars in cities and surroundings or
New York, San Francisco, and Los
Angeles. The structures range from
two storeys to thirteen storeys in
height, the latter being necessary
owing to increasing costs.
The Duplex Suites, Colonial Style:
These have been attractively set out
with lawns, and suggest a private
house. The buildings are mostly m
pastel shades, conftructed of com
Crete or light'Coloured bricks; have
concrete floors with lightweight parti'
tions of metal lathing covered with
Vermiculite or Perlite aggregate
mixed with gypsum plaster.
The Peter Cooper Village and
Stuyvesant Centre in the Harlem
section is one of Manhattan’s most
attractive areas, completely disregard'
ing conventional city grid'iron pattern
in design, and has set the buildings
amid lawns, paths, trees, shrubbery
and play areas. In this section, rem
tals are as follows; One bedroom
apartment, 110 to 135 dollars per
month; two bedroom apartment, 145
to 170 dollars per month, with town
gas and electricity supplied free.
Parafairfax Development, Alexam
dria, N.Y., has folfowed the sum
plicity and informality of the general
plan of the duplex type, with a few
winding roads separating the irregular
blocks thus formed. Red and white
bricks, coloniabstyle structures (mostly
two'Storey) are environed by trees,
lawns, etc., as before. Rental of
apartments consisting of living'room,
dining'room, kitchen, and one bed'
room ranges from 68 to 90 dollars
per month; two bedroom suites, 82
to 100 dollars per month, and three
bedroom suites from 125 to 145 dob
lars per month.
To enable the Company to estab'
lish rentals at a moderate level, it
entered into a contract with the City
Corporation to the effect that all
charges in lespect of rates and taxes
would be based on the 1943 assessed
valuations of the area (land and old
buildings), and, as a consequence, the
city will only obtain annually, during
the next twenty'five years, the taxes
which the district yielded in 1943.
Since the contracts provide for
rentals scaled at moderate levels,
these sites are populated by families
in the lower' and moderatedncome
groups. There are many other sec'
tions, such as Riverston, Harlem,
etc., where the rentals for apartments
41

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


start at 44 to 59 dollars and 52 to 72
dollars per month.
The Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company has demonstrated that large-
scale housing for families in the
moderate- and lower-income groups
can be made a safe investment and
to satisfy the conservative require-
ments of a big financial institution.
This undertaking is yielding well over
6% on invested capital.
I have not touched on the many
other types of housing in the U.S.A.
(such as the Housing Authority of
U.S.A., Washington, the Housing
Authority of San Francisco and Los
Angeles, or the G.I. Housing
Authority activities), but would like
to add, in closing, that the problem
of housing is much the same in all
the countries through which I travelled
as it is in our own, and I was agree-
ably surprised to find that the plan-
ning general layout and construction
were so similar to those of our present
housing schemes here in Melbourne.
Finally, what can one learn from
a visit to countries outside Australia?
1. Much, from their methods of
construction.
2. Nothing but admiration for the
excellent personal co-operation and
friendly co-partnership and team-
work in all ranks.
3. Time and progress scheduling.
4. How Governments may help.
5. How banks and other financial
organisations can help.
6. How building regulations are
drastically adapted to modern needs.
7. Last, but not least, courage.
We have architects and engineers
and workmen equal to most other
countries, and, if we can work in
unison, we can achieve that rapidity
and economical efficiency so much in
evidence in that fantastic country,
the United States, and many others.
STEEL STRUCTURES CODE.
Use of Tubular Steel.
The Standards Association of Aus-
tralia announces the issue for public
critical review of a set of draft rules
(Doc. 283) extending S.A.A. Int.
351 to deal with the use of tubular
steel (issued as Document 283) in
building.
In the preparation of these pro-
visions for tubular steel, reference
has been made to the Addendum to
B.S. 449 on this same subject, and
the corresponding American and
German codes. Consideration is still
being given to a specification cover-
ing tubular steel for use in building
construction, the basis for this work
being B.S. 1775-1951.
Copies may be obtained from the
Headquarters of the Association,
Science House, Gloucester and Essex
Streets, Sydney. Comment should be
submitted by January 31, 1955.
Master Builders’Federation of Australia
REPORTS OF AFFILIATED ASSOCIATIONS PRESENTED AT THE
48th ANNUAL CONVENTION, HOBART.
(1) THE MASTER BUILDERS’
ASSOCIATION OF N.S.W.
The privilege of presenting this re-
port on the major activities of my
Association during the past year is
one from which I derive considerable
pleasure, and I take the opportunity
to convey to this Convention greet-
ings from the Master Builders of New
South Wales.
Building Survey.
The year opened with a promise of
stability and prosperity in the indus-
try, and although the pressure on the
industry has increased to a point
where material and labour shortages
are causing delays, we have not re-
turned to the unreal days of 1951,
although there is a definite tendency
for costs to increase.
During the year under review,
buildings to the value of £101,545,000
were completed in New South Wales,
of this amount £68,958,000 was spent
on housing. 26,513 dwellings were
completed as compared with 24,890
last year.
The volume of industrial work
which is taking place has been sub-
jected to criticism, and some contend
that this activity is detrimental to the
home building programme. To the
critics I say that all classes of con-
struction must be advanced hand in
hand as each is interdependent on the
other, and a survey of our members
shows that very few cottage builders
handle industrial work and vice versa.
The industry, both construction and
material manufacturers, is working to
top capacity and the only practical
method by which the potential of the
industry can be increased appears to
be an immigration policy which will
increase the labour force in vital in-
dustries.
It is useless to undertake vast hous-
ing programmes and neglect other es-
sential services. In New South Wales
we have inadequate transport facilities,
sewerage, over-crowded schools and
hospitals, and these are but a few of
the problems which confront the State
Government, arising from the rapid
increase in population of the State
generally and the Cities of Sydney and
Wollongong in particular, where vast
areas of outlying lands are developing
into busy suburbs.
During the past few months there
has been a gradual emphasis on recon-
struction in the City of Sydney and
contracts have been let for several
major projects.
Quantity Limit.
At last year s Convention there was
considerable discussion on what was
believed to be an agreement with the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects for the provision of quantities,
and I would refer to Page 3 of the
Federation’s Executive’s Report, which
says on this basis the following agree-
ment in relation to ouantities was
reached between the two bodies: (a)
The Federation and the R.A.I.A. ap-
prove of the principle that the pro-
vision of Quantities is of advantage to
all parties to a building contract; (b)
The Federation and the R.A.I.A.
agree to the adoption of the principle
that: (i) quantities should be provided
in respect of,” etc.
This agreement is more honoured
in the breach than in observance by
the architects, and their attitude is ex-
pressed in the following:
“9th August, 1954,
“Dear Sir,
“In answer to your letter of sth inst.,
I desire to point out that there is no
agreement between the Institute and
the Master Builders’ Association as to
the provision of Bills of Quantities.
It is correct that a scale was issued
for the guidance only of members.
“We are, therefore, unable and do
not desire to direct our Members" in
this matter.
“The attitude of my Institute is con-
tained in the following statement:
The provision or otherwise of
Bills of Ouantities in connection with
Contracts is entirely a matter for the
discretion of the Architect, having re-
gard to the circumstances under which
the work is to be carried out.’
“Yours faithfully,
“(Sgd.) J. D. STORRIE,
Secretary, Royal Australian
Institute of Architects.”
Industrial.
The freedom from quarterly basic
wage adjustments since August, 1953,
helped to arrest the ever upward trend
of prices, but, unfortunately, we are
prone to regard each industrial issue
as a matter completed, whilst the
Trade Union movement merely re-
gard each phase as a stepping stone
toward their ultimate goal, although
it is difficult to imagine now what it
is, what with reduced working hours,
long service leave, and so on. The
struggle for an increased basic wage
has been replaced by the marginal
claims, and whilst it cannot be denied
42

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


that there is some merit to these
claims, careful consideration must be
given to economic factors, for the con'
sumer will always have the final say,
and the majority of our consumers
purchase on credit.
With the return of full employ'
ment, the change of attitude on the
part of employees has been most
noticeable. Inducement advertising
has reappeared, although this Associa'
tion’s members are bound by policy
to advertise their names and also to
refrain from advertising wage rates and
inducements.
We are particularly disturbed at the
lack of bricklayers, plumbers and plas'
terers. For the year ended 30th June
last 821 carpenters and joiners com'
menced apprenticeship compared with
331 plumbers and 46 plasterers. The
figure for bricklayers is included in
that of the carpenters figure, but is so
small as to be almost negligible.
Sixteen serious industrial disputes
were notified to the Arbitration Courts
and in most cases the Building
Workers' Industrial Union was in'
volved. Following a major stoppage
involving 400 carpenters on the Caltex
Oil Refinery at Kurnell for increased
marginal rates (a site allowance of
.£2/10/0 per week was already being
paid), the Association moved for the
deregistration of the Union in Feb'
ruary. Following a lengthy hearing,
the Full Court reserved its decision,
and we are still awaiting judgment, but
in the meantime the strength of our
case has had a salutary effect on the
Union’s activities.
Arbitration by legislation has con'
tinned to be a serious problem to em'
plovers in New South Wales. Firstly,
long service leave “improvements
were gazetted which gave all em'
ployees under State Awards the right
to proportionate payment on ter'
mination aof employment for any
reason, after ten years’ continuous em'
ployment, and also an additional six
weeks’ leave for each period of ten
years served after the normal three
months for 20 years. Another iniqui'
tous piece of legislation was absolute
preference to Unionists (better known
as compulsory unionism). This gave
all employees twenty'eight days to
join a union or obtain an exemption
on conscientious grounds at the same
price as a year’s union dues (this
exemption is renewable each year).
This matter is being tested in the High
Court.
Claims for increased marginal rates
have been lodged by all Building
Trades Unions, and we h°ve had dis'
cussions with the Building Trades
Group of the Trades and Labour
Council. Whilst we have expressed
sympathy to these claims we have re-
fused steadfastly to negotiate any
agreement. My Association believes
that anv interference with the funC'
tions of the Court in the matter of
margins is not within its prerogative,
and we reaffirm our adherence to the
principles of Arbitration.
Preliminary claims for a new award
based on weekly hire were made by
the Builders’ Labourers’ Federation,
and this matter was referred to the
Federation.
The President quickly arranged a
conference of the States most affected,
and although no final decisions were
reached at that meeting, it established
a precedent which might well be fob
lowed in the industrial future of this
Federation.
A draft award is nearing completion
which will be circulated to all States
for comment. The draft has been pat'
terned on Queensland Awards. We
feel that weekly hire, with suitable
safeguards, may be a means of stabilise
ing our work force and attracting a
better class of employee to the indus-
try.
Both the Bridge and Wharf Carpem
ters’ Union and the Australian Work'
ers’ Union have filed claims for
awards to cover foremen in New South
Wales. With the advent of compub
sory unionism we could be in danger
of losing control of our iobs 'com
pletely, and both claims will be op'
posed vigorously. There are numerous
precedents in the Commonwealth
Courts, but this is the first approach to
the Industrial Commission of New
South Wales, although this Court has
on a number of occasions issued state'
ments which are of benefit to our case.
Added to items mentioned earlier,
the Association has been busy hand'
ling demarcation issues and various
prosecutions have been launched
against our members. Apart from ap'
pearances before Magistrates. w<> have
handled 64 matters before the Indus'
trial Courts since our last report to
you.
We have also formed an Employers
Council with five other employer
bodies to discuss industrial matters
affecting the building industry, and
whilst it is early yet to talk of the
efforts of this Council, the co'opera'
tion which exists is very heatening for
the future. May I also urge a greater
exchange of information between the
States. Could not each Association be
regarded as a member of the other
and all names added to membership
mailing lists? I feel this would be for
the good of the industry.
We have recently issued a Monthly
Bulletin to our members to keep them
informed of many happenings which
may not warrant the issue of a full
circular. This paper is being forward'
ed to you, and we would welcome your
comments. There is always room for
improvement in services to members,
and we are willing to exchange our
ideas.
Affiliation with Suburban
Master Builders’ Associations.
In Tune, 1953, eight of the nine
Suburban Associations were affiliated
with the Master Builders’ Association
of New South Wales, and although
one of these has since withdrawn its
affiliation, the remainder of the Subur-
ban Associations report that they are
well satisfied with the arrangement.
The added support of our Affiliated
Branches to the General Committee
and General Meetings has greatly
stimulated discussions and has given
great assistance in the formulation of
policy. Many representatives have
served on various committees, and Mr.
H. N. Barton of St. George and
Sutherland Branch, with the Secretary,
Mr. W. D. Ford, represented the As
sociation in an admirable manner be-
fore the Oregon Tariff Inquiry in Mel-
bourne recently.
Mrs. Florence M. Taylor, 0.8. E.
I would be failing in my duty if I
did not pay tribute to the greatest
friend the Association has known.
This champion of the Building Indus-
try is not content to further the in-
terests of the industry at all times
through her journals, but this year has
donated to the Association hundreds
of books from her magnificent library,
in order to provide the foundations of
an Association Library, which, with
her consent, will be known as the
“Florence M. Taylor Technical Lib-
rary.” Many of the books are price-
less, and, we believe, the only copies
in the Commonwealth. The Associa-
tion extends a since thank-you to a
worthy lady. “Construction has con-
tinued to serve a valuable purpose in
keeping members informed of trade
happenings, both at home and abroad.
I would also express my appreciation
to Mr. Reay Wilson of Mrs. Taylors
staff for his valued co-operation to the
Association.
General.
The main social event of the year
was New South Wales winning the
fames all Bowls Cup from South
Australia. On this occasion we had
the privilege of being host Association,
and were very pleased to be able to
save South Australia from the trouble
of carrying the Cup back home.
The year has seen considerable
activity commenced with the Associa-
tion, and whilst much has yet to be
completed the efforts of my Associa-
tion have been well extended. The
paper used runs to half a million
sheets, whilst inward ’phone calls have
averaged almost 100 a day and postage
£6OO per annum.
At the last Convention we reported
on our plans to decentralise the As-
sociation’s offices, but the proposed
purchase of the property at Drum-
moyne was aborted by legal obstruc-

tions. We have now entered into a
contract to purchase property in King
Street, Newtown, a location which has
many advantages that the Drummoyne
property did not possess.
Lack of space in our present build'
ing prevents us from increasing our
existing staff, and limits the extension
of new services to members. With
the additional space available in the
new premises, we intend to set up a
library devoted to the interests of the
Building Industry, where Mrs. Tay'
lor’s gift will be available for the
benefit of all.
K. C. McGregor, President.
(2) NEWCASTLE BRANCH.
I have pleasure in presenting this
Annual Report of the Master Builders’
Association of New South Wales—
Newcastle Branch to the Annual Con'
ference of the Master Builders’ Federa'
tion of Australia to be held in Hobart,
Tasmania, in Novermber, 1954, and
in doing so I bring best wishes from
the members of the Newcastle Associa'
tion.
Membership.
The numbers of members on the
register at present is as follows:
Association members 96
Sub'Contractors 25
Country Association members .. 23
Exchange members 35
Country Exchange member .... 1
Honorary Members 4
Life Member 1

This represent an increase of one
member to that shown on our last re'
port.
Obituary.
It is with deep regret that we record
the passing of the late H. Banks, a
past president and past trustee of the
Association, the late R. P. Rich and
the late H. Mclnerney.
Industrial—State of Trade.
In accordance with the usual prac'
tice we attach statistics showing the
value of new buildings and alterations
for which permits were sought during
the year. The figures include returns
from the Newcastle City Council, Lake
Macquarie Shire Council and Port
Stephens Shire Council, to these we
have added estimates of the work done
for those authorities from which per'
missions were not required and which
we now set out as follows:

Grand Total £7,723,965.
The building industry in Newcastle
has made a pronounced recovery of
activity. More commercial buildings
are in progress than for many years
and many large buildings are in con'
templation. Material shortages are
again becoming apparent. Apart from
certain building materials, including a
number of steel products, we are now
better served with fuel power and
materials than during the period of
overstrain some three years ago. There
is no widespread coal shortage and
electric power appears to be in suffT
cient supply to meet demands.
Wages and Conditions.
The Association distributes from
time to time a revised list of wages
and current ready reckoner.
These are more stable than they
have been since the war.
As the rates of pay are identical
with those of the New South Wales
Association we will not repeat the
schedule in this report.
Quantity System.
The Newcastle builders are abiding
by the Quantity limits agreed by the
Master Builders’ Federation of Austra'
lia and the Royal Australian Institute
of Architects. Certain oppositiori has
been engendered from the local Archh
tects as to the Quantity limits which
they declare are too low. The New'
castle Association will only adhere to
limits fixed in the Federal sphere.
Federal Building Construction
Prize Examination.
This Examination was again con'
ducted at the Newcastle Technical
College and one of our candidates,
Mr. C. Dries, has been placed second
for the prize.
Theft Signs.
The theft signs provided by the As'
sociation for members in 1952 are still
being used.
Lectures.
The Association was favoured by
several lectures during the year, all of
which proved both instructive and
entertaining. Mr. N. A. Feron and
• Mr. G. MacDonald presented films
entitled:
(a) ‘Mono'Rail Transporter,”
(b) Caldwell Overhead Loader,”
(c) “Griffin Front End Loader.”
Mr. J. Grinham, Lecturer in Quam
tity Surveying at the Sydney Techni-
cal College, delivered an address em
titled “Quantity Surveying.”
Relationship with
Kindred Associations.
The Association continued amicable
relationships with the Newcastle City
Council, Electricity Supply Depart'
ment, the Newcastle Architects, The
Master Plumbers’ Association, Master
Painters’ Association and the New'
castle Timber Merchants’ Association.
Newcastle Technical College.
The Association continued support
to the Newcastle Technical College
and prizes to successful students in
stages 1 to 5 of the Carpentry and
Joinery courses were made.
Productivity Team to U.S.A.,
The Continent and England.
At the instance of the Building In'
dustry Congress of Victoria nomina'
tions were invited from Master
Builders who would be prepared to
join the Building Industry Produc'
tivity Team to visit the United States
and Europe in 1954 and Messrs. W.
H. Hudson, B. Compton and N.
Compton of the Newcastle Associa'
tion were included in that team.
These members have now returned
and already we have been favoured
with two addresses on their experi'
ences gained whilst abroad.
Miscellaneous.
The social activities of the Associa'
tion were maintained and again this
year we featured the Annual Picnic
and Annual Dinner.
The latter occasion was also joined
in a testimonial given to Mr. C. G.
Davis, retiring Treasurer of the As'
sociation, after being 51 years a mem'
ber and 43 years in Executive office.
Acquisition of Land.
The Association has acquired a
parcel of land in Darby Street, New'
castle, which may be used in future
for the erection of an Exchange
Room facing Civic Park—a most cem
tral position in the city.
In conclusion we take this oppor'
tunity of expressing the wish that the
deliberations of delegates to the Con'
vention will be both harmonious and
successful and that important decisions
will be made for the good of the
industry throughout Australia.
F. E. Anderson,
President.

AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE
OF BUILDERS
QUEENSLAND CHAPTER.
Happy Christmas Function.
At a cocktail party and buffet held
at the Belle Vue Hotel, Brisbane, on
Tuesday evening, December 14, mem'
bers of the Queensland Chapter of
the Australian Institute of Builders,
and guests, met to exchange Christ'
mas greetings and foregather inform'
ally at the end of a busy and satisfy'
ing year. Host was Mr. D. S.
Cousins, dynamic President of the
Queensland Chapter, ably assisted by
Mr. G. W. Wiley, Hon. Treasurer
in the absence, in another State, of
Mr. G. O. Boulton, Secretary.
Five Presidents.
Present were no less than five Presi'
dents of professional bodies and asso'
ciations belonging to the building in'
dustry. They were: Messrs. M. R.
Hornibrook, President of the Austra'
lian Institute of Builders; G. H. Day,
President of the Master Builders
Federation of Australia; M. L. Con'
rad, President of the Queensland
Chapter of the Royal Australian Insti'
tute of Architects; C. P. Hormck,
President of the Queensland Master
Builders’ Association, and D. S.
Cousins, President of the Queensland
Chapter, Australian Institute of
Builders. Also present were Mr. I. C.
Mathison, Chairman of the Brisbane
Division of the Institution of Em
gineers, Australia, and Mr. J. F. Me'
Grath. Principal of the Central Tech'
nical College, Queensland.
Metropolitan members were epe'
dally glad to welcome to Brisbane
members Les. Smith, from Wondai,
Clive Kynaston, from Cairns (with
his son Rod.), and President. G. S.
Cousins, himself from Rockhampton.
Mr. Cousins welcomed all members
and guests, and expressed his pleasure
at the opportunity this occasion gave
him personally to meet again in
friendly and informal circumstances
the metropolitan members and repre'
sentatives of allied organisations. He
congratulated Mr. G. H. Day on his
recent elevation to the position of
President of the Master Builders’
Federation of Australia. To all mem'
bers of the Australian Institute of
Builders and visitors present, he
wished a Happy Christmas and Pros'
perous New Year. He invited the
President of the Institute, Mr. M. R
Hornibrook, to say a few words.
Mr. Hornibrook expressed his
pleasure at being present and at
meeting members and guests on this
occasion. He briefly mentioned that
this was the fourth year of the Aus'
tralian Institute of Builders, which
now had Chapters in every State in
Australia. Technical courses had been
established by the Institute in New
South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia, and it was hoped there
would soon be one in Queensland.
There was some difficulty in achieving
a uniform system of training, but it
was expected that this problem could
be solved satisfactorily.
It had been decided that the Insth
tute should have a “home” of its
own, and arrangements made to
bring this into existence were briefly
recounted by Mr. Hornibrook. He
stated that on Friday, December 17,
the foundation stone of the new
building, which had been begun at
North Sydney, would be set by the
Prime Minister, Mr. R. G. Menzies,
who, incidentally, had recently been
made an Honorary Member of the In'
stitute. The cost of the building,
without furniture or the cost of the
land, would be £65,000. Very satis'
factory arrangements had already
been made to let part of the building
as a commercial office, which would
materially aid in the financing.
Mr. Hornibrook concluded by ex'
tending to all present his best wishes
for a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year.
On behalf of members and guests,
Mr. W. G. Grigg, Immediate Past
President of the Queensland Chapter,
responded, and extended the Compli'
ments of the Season to Messrs.
Hornibrook and Cousins.
MR. D. S. COUSINS
President of the Queensland Chapter of
the Australian Institute of Builders.

hand corner. Vertical louvres are used extensively to solve the afternoon sun problem in Cords Ring Distributor store build-
ing, Adelaide, for which the architect was E. A. Keal. Below is another design in which projection from the sun Is secured
by aluminium louvres in a vertical plane and are designed as an intrinsic part of the building. Bottom left is yet another
installation showing overhanging louvres performing the same function. Bottom right is the proposed new building to be
erected at the southern approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, at a cost of £1,000,000. The lower floors are devoted to

Big New Airport Ready by June.
Work on Singapore’s great new
international airport at Paya Lebar is
making excellent progress and the air'
port should be ready for use by next
June, the superintending engineer,
Mr. J. J. Bryan, reports. What will be
one of the colony’s largest buildings
in floor space area is now being
erected. It will consist of four hangars
and adjoining workshops. The shell
of the structure is expected to be
finished by the end of the year. A
wide variety of American and British
equipment is being used at the air'
port. Earth ' movers. International
Harvester tractors, Barber'Greene dig'
gers, and concrete mixers have been
supplied, as well as other machinery
in abundance.
Better Bearing Pullers.
Lindeteves (Malaya) Ltd. announce,
as agents, that J. F. Sykes, St.
Leonards Road, St. Annes'on'Sea,
Lancashire, have for over a year been
testing prototypes of bearing pullers,
a range of which will now go on to
the market.
To Double Water Supplies.
A report on a scheme to double
water supplies to the Ipoh region, at
a cost of £1,250,000, has been sub'
mitted to the Government by Mr. W.
R. Plunkett, Senior Executive Em
gineer, Waterworks, Perak, Malaya.
This scheme, which would improve
supplies to Chemor, Tanjong Rambu'
tan, Pusing, Batu Gajah and Tronoh,
is the biggest on a lis tof 28 water
projects for Perak, the total cost of
which is expected to be £3,725,000.
The number of people affected would
be 700,000, and the Ipoh area would
get 17,500,000 gallons a day. Then it
is hoped that water will be provided
for a sewerage scheme which has yet
to be introduced.
Turbines For Penang.
Negotiations have been completed
by The English Electnc Co. Ltd. with
Preece, Cardew and Rider, Consulting
Engineers, Queei-i Anne’s Gate, Lon'
don, S.W.I, for the supply of two
10,000 k.W., 11 k.V. turbo'alternator
sets designed to operate at 400 p.s.i.,
800°F., with condensers and feed
heating equipment. These sets are for
the new power station to be con'
structed on Penang Island. This will
replace the municipality’s old station
at Prai, on the mainland.
Equipment For New
Telephone System.
More than £60,000 worth of equip'
ment has been bought for the pro'
posed pay'by'the'call telephone system
to be introduced in the Federation of
Malaya early in 195 5. Mr. J. M.
Brander, Secretary to the Members
for Posts and Telecommunications,
said this in a letter to the Associated
Chinese Chambers of Commerce,
which protested against the new idea.
The letter said that the new rates may
prove cheaper than the Chambers of
Commerce expected.
Work on £875,000 Reservoir
Delayed.
Building of the proposed Pierce
Reservoir Dam, now estimated to cost
about £875,000. is not expected to
begin for about another year, said Mr.
F. S. Wicks, the Acting Singapore
City Water Engineer. The scheme
calls for a main dam and a number of
sudsidiary dams. The main dam will
be able to impound water in the
catchment area to a depth of 70ft.
Its length will be about 700 ft. The
capacity of the reservoir wid be in*
creased from 900,000,000 gallons to
3,500,000,000 gallons.
Weaving Factory Planned.
Malayan Textile Mills Ltd., of
Singapore, are to build a factory to
cost £125,000 and produce cloth for
local and foreign markets.
Wood Waste Experiment.
Following experiments in Britain,
samples have arrived in Malaya of
building board that can be made from
local wood waste, including rubber
wood. These specimens have been
handed over to the Department of
Forestry, and it is hoped that eventu'
ally private enterprise will be induced
to set up plants to manufacture the
board.
Hong Kong Trade Fair
For Singapore.
Hong Kong manufacturers will
hold an exhibition of their products
in Singapore early in 1955. It will
be the third and by far the biggest
show of its kind.
£3,000,000 Fort Plan
Takes Shape.
Giant concrete cylinders have been
lowered 60ft. underwater to test the
sealed strength of the North Klang
Straits. The tests are part of the pre'
liminary work on a £3,000,000
scheme to expand waterfront facilities
at Port Swettenham, Malaya. Mar'
shalling yards have already been ex'
panded to cone with the increasing
tonnage of cargo being handled. The
new wharves in the northern straits
will probably take about three years
to build.
Australia’s “Know-How”
Up-to-Date.
Things are now different from the
days when there was a tendency for
buyers to regard Australian goods
with a lack of confidence, said Mr.
Cedric Godden, representative of
President Industries and the deputy
leader of the Australian trade mis'
don, when visiting Singapore. The
lack of confidence stemmed from dis'
ruption immediately after the war, he
oaid, but today production, “know'
how,” and tools are right up'tO'date.
“We arc following America in its
methods of mass production. There
is a constant stream of executives to
and from the United States,” he said.
His company produces about 20 per
cent, of Australian refrigerators. Last
year. 250,000 Australiammade re'
frigerators were sold in the domestic
market.

£1,200,000 Housing
Project.
The Federal Housing Trust in
Malaya is to build 1000 homes early
next year, at an estimated cost of
£1,200,000, said the Trust Manager,
Mr. V. Z. Newcombe, in Kuala
Lumpur. Sites had been found and
and preliminary plans completed.
The houses will be put up in Kuala
Lumpur, Penang, Johore Bahru,
Kuala Trenagganu, Alor Star, and
Seremban.
Self-Sterilising Water Filter
For Malaya.
With the introduction of the self'
sterilising Katadyn filter, water from
swamps and rivers can now be used
safely for drinking and cooking in
Malaya. This will eliminate germs
such as those causing typhoid, cholera
and dysentery. The filter is reported
to have passed tests at the Institute of
Hygiene, University of Basle, Har'
vard University Division of Applied
Science, Massachusetts, and by the
United States Testing Co., Inc.,
Hoboken.
Housing Society
Seeks £370,000.
The Forlong Housing Society,
Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, is seeking a
£370,000 loan from the Employers’
Provident Fund Board to finance a
4Lacre “garden city” of over 400
homes which it plans to build at Seta'
pak, three miles from Kuala Lumpur.

A new company, Aokam Tin Ltd.,
will mine tin off the coast of Siam.
It has been incorporated in Malaya,
with an authorised capital of
£860,000. Mr. E. V. Pearce, Chair'
man of Kramat Pulai Ltd., which has
a share in the new company, said that
the Siamese Government had notified
its intention to exercise its right to
subscribe 45 per cent, of the capital.
The balance would be subscribed by
the companies constituting the
Tronoh'Malayan group in proportion
to their holdings in Tromal Prospect'

of the Cameron Highlands. It is
estimated that its ultimate capacity of
120,000 kilowatts will produce about
700,000,000 units of electricity a year.
An underground power rtation may
be built inside the mountains. Several
miles of tunnels will be bored through
hills from a dam to take water to the
station. Further stations will be
established at lower levels.

Singapore Loan.
The City Council in Singapore has
announced a £3,500,000 loan to
finance its electricity and water expan-
sion programme. The loan, redeem-
able at par in 1977, will bear interest
at four per cent, per annum and a
discount of two and a half per cent.
Interest will be three-quarters per
cent, less than for a similar loan
floated last year and over-subscribed
by £700,000. Mr. J. T. Rea, Acting
City President, Singapore, said that
the Council has so far spent about
£13,000,000 on extension programmes,
which would ultimately cost
£25,000,000.
Big Sewerage Scheme.
Mr. J. H. Shakesnear, Municipal
Sewerage Engineer, Kuala Lumpur,

FIRST OIL WELL.
World’s First Oil Well, 96 Years
Ago: On a sweltering Saturday after-
noon, 96 years ago, a dark green
liquid surged to the surface of a
primitive drill hole in the ground at
Titusville, Pennsylvania. It flowed from
a depth of only 96Mt. This was
“Drake’s Folly,” but it made history.
Primitive derricks sprang up and
many mushroom towns appeared in
many parts of the country. The
population of oil-seekers grew from
hundreds to several thousands in a
few months. That was the beginning
of the world’s oil industry in 1858.
New Homes From Old Houses
LONDON EXHIBITION SHOWS HOW.
An unusual exhibition wsa recently
held in London called “New Homes
from Old Houses.” Briefly, it showed
how Britain could produce new
dwellings from older houses by con-
verting them into convenient flats, or
otherwise modernising them.
For purposes of the exhibition,
replicas of a group of 19th-Century
houses were specially built on a blitzed
site near Oxford Circus (see photo).
Britain has many houses of that
era, and most border on the sub-
standard.
Living Standards Contrasted.
The first of the replicas was left in
its original state, before conversion,
and shows the cumulative effect of
age. both outside and in.
The middle two houses have been
converted horizontally into three self'
contained flats on ground, first, and
second floors . This shows how three
families could live comfortably where
two had previously lived uncom'
fortably.
(Cost of this conversion in the
London area was about £785 per
flat. Every dwelling improved can
qualify for a grant of up to £4OO from
the Local Authorities. Thus a large
house converted intp three flats can
get three quotas.)
The homes—old and new —were
furnished according to the 19th or
20th Century, with domestic equip'
ment, both primitive and ultra-
modern, to contrast the rise of living
standards over the decades.
NEW DEAL FOR BRITAIN'S OLD DWELLINGS.
These houses are exact replicas of part of a 19th-Century London terrace. They
were built tor the "New Homes from Old Houses" Exhibition near Oxford Circus.
On the left is an old, grimy, uncomfortable dwelling; the others have been
modernised and converted into comfortable flats.

painters’ art.
World’s Oldest
Builders’
Organisation
High Ideals Still Handed Down.
As far back as 1773, a group of
building craftsmen formed a society
to protect their interests in the West'
moreland Lake District, England.
The members of the guilds then in
existence were master craftsmen, em-
ploying and training apprentices who
in later life became master craftsmen
and guild members.
The Kendal Society must have been
one of the very first friendly societies
to be formed, and in one of the few
existing Rule Books—or “orders,” as
they were quaintly termed—it is
piously hoped that “the names of the
12 founders will never be erased, as
a mark of our respect for them.”
The Society’s motto was, “In the
Lord is all our trust,” and some
people believe Romney designed the
bold Coat of Arms.
(Romney, the son of a builder at
Dalton'in-Furness, began life as a
cabinetmaker . He made a violin, de-
veloped a taste for music and paint'
ing, and became apprenticed to Steele,
an itinerant portrait painter of
Kendal.)
At the time the Kendal builders
were founding their Society, wages in
London for bricklayers, masons and
carpenters were 2s. 6d., and plumbers
3s. a day. In fact, just 90 years ago,
bricklayers worked from 6 a.m. to 6
p.m., with half'hour for breakfast and
one hour for dinner. Work ceased
on Saturdays at 4 p.m. Wages were
only £l a week, or 3s. 4d. per day.
But all wages were relative, and so
also were expenses. One could travel
on a stage coach to the other ends
of the earth for Is. In Ireland, only
twenty years ago, one could travel on
a tram as far as one wished to go for
£d. In Sydney at present we can
travel in a tram from the Quay to
Park Street for 6d. Incomes and ex'
penses advance together.
SEA-WATER CONVERSION.
The new steam electric generating
plant of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.,
now under construction at Morro
Bay, California, will use two sets of
sea'water evaporation to produce
fresh water for boiler operations. It
is believed that this is the first indus'
trial application of ocean water, other
than for ship requirements and for
the requirements of soldiers during
the war, who had to convert their
sea water to drinking water.
Each of the two 300,000 K.W.
power boilers will be served by one
set of evaporators. They will be
horizontally mounted cyclinders, 17ft.
long, 6ft, in diameter, with a capacity
of 72,000 gallons per day.
—“Engineering News Record.”
PRIMARY SOURCES OF ENERGY.
At a World Power Conference held
at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this year,
the importance of a high degree of
electrical development was stressed.
Various sources of energy, other than
the use of fuels, were discussed in a
paper which described a plant of
7000 K.W. to use the thermal energy
of the ocean, which France is build'
ing in Abidjan.
Wind'power plants in conjunction
with hydro'electric systems are being
tried out in Algeria.
Several speakers dealt with the use
of solar energy. Comparatively high
heat conversion efficiencies are pos'
sible in selected tropical areas, but
they are limited in their location and
in their size by physical limitations.

ts the reason why
GAS COSTS LESS
Gas is the efficient willing servant in 400,000 Sydney homes. In Bathrooms, Lounges, Kitchens,
Laundries—and in every room where gas can be used—it does a better, cheaper job. Gas gives
you hot water all the time for your bath, shower, shave, dish washing, cleaning and clothes
washing. Gas warms your rooms, does all your cooking, and gives you perfect, trouble-free
refrigeration. The price of gas here is amongst the lowest in the world for manufactured gas.
Despite increased costs in all commodities, your gas company's modem planning and production
methods have kept the price down.

Housing Commission Orders Concrete
Block Homes
COMPLETE SATISFACTION EXPRESSED BY CHAIRMAN.
Recent weeks witnessed a new in-
novation in homes being built for the
N.S.W. Housing Commission at
Berkeley, near Wollongong.
An eight - square, two - bedroom
house was completed and handed over
to Mr. F. C. Gallop, Commission
chairman, by Dura - Crete Products
Pty. Ltd., Unanderra, N.S.W.
It was the first all-concrete block
home built for the Commission —a
further 20 have since been sanctioned
—and represented a step forward to
the goal and durable and low main-
tenance dwellings for small outlay.
Embodying all the advantages and
comfortable living of conventional
brick construction, this concrete block
home costs very little more than a
fibro of similar size and design.
Several features contributed to this
result. They are:
• Concrete raft foundations where
floor is cast direct on the ground
as a 4:2:1 air-entrained con-
crete raft, reinforced and thick-
ended at the edges to minimise
moisture changes in the under-
lying foundation soil.
• Embodied in floor is a water-
proof membrane which insulates
the surface from moisture and
thermal changes.
• This type of foundation, suitable
for nearly flat sites, eliminates
carpentry work below floor-level,
reduces exterior wall height, en-
hances the architectural appear-
ance, prevents harbourage of
rodents and white ants.
• Use of machine moulded, high-
frequency vibrated, Dura-Crete
high-strength hollow blocks, 6f
inches wide in single skin ex-
terior walls.
• These concrete blocks are treat-
ed on outside with two coats of
Portland cement paint, provid-
ing a thinner, completely water-
proof wall that decreases size of
foundation and roof for a given
living space with considerable
cost savings.
• Partitions are made with 3fin.
wide lightweight blocks. All in-
ternal walls are cement rendered.
• Aluminium framed windows are
built into vrooves in the con-
crete block iambs. Polished with
steel wool, they require no initial
painting, are maintenance free,
and their glazing bars and mul-
Hons of economic sections pro-
vide maximum vision and light-
ing for a given wall opening.
• Electrical conduit and water
pipes are run in hollow cavities
of exterior wall blocks, which
eliminates cost of chasing brick-
work and unsightly pipes on ex-
terior walls.
Finally, the roof is covered with
attractive blue/grey Dura-Crete tiles
made in their Adams-Powell automatic
tile machine. These tiles are extruded
under pressure to precision units that
fit closely, giving a roof impervious to
moisture-penetration and lighter than
conventional clay tiles.
New Class of Home.
These factors, plus correct building
techniques, result in a new type of
home, low in initial cost but with all
the permanency and low maintenance
of conventional brickwork.
This development here, experts
state, could lead to the conditions
existing in the U.S. to-day, where
80% of all masonry walls are con-
structed in machine-moulded concrete
blocks.
In America, over two billion blocks
are produced each year, and leading
authorities predict an increase to six
billion blocks within the next five to
ten years.
Productivity Team’s Findings.
This trend has already been recog-
nised by members of the Australian
Building Productivity Team which
made a world tour earlier this year.
Partly as a result of their findings
published to date, the South Aus-
tralian Housing Trust has placed an
order for 150 concrete block homes.
“Construction” understands that pri-
vate building contractors are also
showing keen interest in this type of
construction, and Dura-Crete sales
manager Colin Stone believes that the
small beginning at Berkeley could be
the forerunner of what he terms “a
new deal in building permanent homes
for the people.”
Data of Dura-Crete House.
The Type 200 Dura-Crete house
built for the Housing Commission has
an area of 804 square feet (building,
776 sq. ft.; roofed porch, 28 sq. ft.).
Tender price was £2OOO complete
with paths, fences, lattice screens, etc.,
but excluding land and P.C. items sup-
plied by Commission.
CABRIL POWER STATION,
PORTUGAL.
The Cabril Hydro-electric Power
Station recently commissioned in
Portugal, on the River Lezere, is the
second largest in that territory, with
two turbines of 74,800 h.p. at a head
of 397 ft, The Cabril Dam is 44
miles upstream from Castelo do Bode,
so that the water used in this plant
can be stored in the Castelo do Bode
Reservoir and used again in another
plant.
The dam is of the cupola arch
type with a double curvature. It is
43 3ft. high and has a storage of
567 000 acre-feet of water.
Electricity generated at the plant is
transmitted at 165 K.V. in the system
network for Portugal.

CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH OF WOLLONGONiG.
Representative Gathering At Official Opening.
“Lindsay Park,” near Wollongong, is the name given to the estate which
has been purchased by Sir Lindsay Parkinson (A/asia) Pty. Ltd. for the purpose
of subdivision and the building of homes for the people.
The estate will accommodate over
400 houses with provision for a school,
shopping centre, and open parks.
Two' and three'bedroom homes are
to be constructed to attractive designs
incorporating many modern features
and providing amenities and domestic
facilities which are not generally avail'
able in homes of similar size.
The dwellings are equipped with
hot water service and indoor sanita'
tion in addition to other modern
features and fittings which go a long
way to meet present'day standards of
comfort and living.
Development In Stages.
Development of the estate is plan'
ned in stages so that public demand
may be ascertained and so that ar'
rangements may be made, as far as
possible, to cater for any preferences
shown by this demand for varying
types of design and construction.
Overall, the company aims to pro'
vide attractive homes in pleasant sur'
roundings with adequate, welLplanned
services, and to develop a housing
estate of which the community may
feel justifiably proud.
Opening Ceremony.
At the opening ceremony recently,
guests were invited to inspect the first
two completed cottages, which were
officially opened by the Mayor of
Wollongong.
These homes are typical of the first
40 the company proposes to erect, and
which will be offered for sale complete
with the land which they occupy at
a price within the range of £2950 to
£3290.
Welcoming the Mayor of Wollon-
gong (Alderman J. Kelly), the Lady
Mayoress, M’sP., Aldermen, the ladies
and guests, the Managing Director of
Sir Lindsay Parkinson (A/asia) Pty.
Ltd., Mr. L W, G. Freeman, said that
when one launched a or cele*
brated a great occasion, one’s friends
were invited to partake of the tradb
tional hospitality.
“This is just such an occasion, when
we celebrate, in a small way, the
humble beginnings of what hope
will become a big enterprise,” Mr.
Freeman declared.
He hoped that at some not-far*
distant date the guests would again
gather on the top of the nearby hill
and see streets of happy homes, each
owned by people with a stake in the
beautiful countryside.
Mr. Freeman expressed the wish
that the Mayor and Aldermen were
feeling satisfied with their share in the
project.
He thanked the Mayor for con'
senting to formally open the two com'
pleted cottages of the enterprise, and
said he could envisage the 400 finished
homes on the magnificent 100'acre
site.
It was hoped to complete two
homes a week from now on.

the world, and paying his annual visit
to Australia, before returning to
Britain, via U.S.A.
The Mayor of Wollongong declared
the occasion was a Ted'letter day for
his city, and extended a hearty web
come to Mr. A. E. Parkinson and
distinguished visitors.
He said Mr. Parkinson must be
very thrilled to see one of his projects
making such headway, and he looked
forward to seeing the first 40 homes
finished and occupied.
Any organisation endeavouring to
overcome the housing shortage de'
served the greatest encouragement and
praise, and the fact that it was placing
homes within the reach of all in the
best area of Wollongong was a mag'
nificent achievement.
The Wollongong district, the Mayor
added, was progressing faster than any
other area in Australia, and possibly
anywhere else in the world.
He then officially opened the rst
two homes, and led guests on a tour
of inspection. . .
In returning thanks, the Chairman,
Mr. A. E. Parkinson, expressed com
fidence in the future of Australia, and
regretted that the parent company s
managing director, Mr. T. E \ arker
had to leave Sydney on Monday night
for India.
He promised that his company
would give all assistance possible in
helping to overcome housing problems
in the Commonwealth.
Rural Bank Warns On Housing Finance
SIGNS OF TIGHTENING SEEN.
Commencements Decline In March Quarter.
The current issue of “Trends,” the Rural Bank quarter publication, makes
many trenchant comments on home-building finance.
It declares that too much finance for home-building would react against
home builders as equally as would a continuing shortage of building, materials
and labour.
Unless the building industry labour
force was expanded and more mate'
rials made available, liberal home'
building finance could lead to an in'
crease in the commencement rate of
homes and a decrease in completed
dwellings.
This, in turn, would reflect in the
cost of homes being built, the article
warned.
Steep Rise in Costs.
Over the years, home builders had
been able to seek some refuge from
high costs by using alternative mate'
rials or reducing the size of their
homes. However, there was a limit
to these costs costs'saving alternatives.
The article gave these figures;—
• Since 1946, over 155,000 homes,
worth about £300,000,000, had
been built in N.S.W.
• During the period costs rose
steeply. There was a 170 per
cent, rise in the total of homes
completed in 1953 (25,600) com'
pared with 1946 (9500). Over the
same period the estimated values
of homes built rose by 515 per
cent.
• The average value of houses begun
in N.S.W. in the 1946 September
quarter rose from £ll6l per
house to a peak of £2601 in the
1953 September quarter.
By the March quarter this year
the average value of homes begun
had declined to £2412, the article
stated .
The variation of values, it con-
tinued, was not strictly comparable
because of the variation in the rela'
tive number of brick, fibro and tim'
ber homes which were started in each
quarter.
• In the December, 195 3, quarter
52 per cent, of the 7394 homes
completed were fibro, 22 per cent,
bride, and 22 per cent, timber,
• In the September, 1946, quarter
57 per cent, of the 2700 homes
completed were fibro, 30 per cent,
brick, and 22 per cent, timber.
Timber Scores.
“Fibro has only slipped slightly in
popularity, brick considerably, while
the proportionate doubling in tim'
ber means, in view of the rise in
completions, that the actual number
being built to'day is about five times
as great as just after the war,” the
article adds.
Availability of Finance.
The sharp rise in building costs
had resulted in the virtual disap'
pearance of private investment in
new housing for rental purposes.
“Only Government intervention,
through the Housing Commission,
has prevented the complete disloca'
tion of the supply of homes available
for rent, but even this has been unable
to satisfy the demand,” the article said.
(There is a fantastic total of
29,525 people still in ballots for
homes in the metropolitan area at
June 30. There are thousands more
in provincial cities, towns, and coun'
try areas. An unofficial estimate
places the total at about 95,000.
From these figures, it is obvious that
the Commission has far from satisfied
the demand!)
The availability of finance had
caused variations in the commencement
rate of housebuilding. Some indica'
tions of a restriction of finance
towards the latter half of 1951 had
caused a sharp fall in total starts.
This fall, the article said, probably
reached its lowest point in the early
months of 1952 “and then recovered
slowly as finance for new housing
became more readily available.
“Signs of Tightening."
“At present there are some signs
of a tightening of housing finance
which may be accompanied by a con'
tinuation of the decline in com'
mencements observed in the March
quarter of this year,” the article
added.
PARTITION CRACKING IN
MULTI STOREY STRUCTURES.
The trend towards larger glass
areas, unobstructed ceilings and fewer
partitions is causing many structural
engineers to look more closely into
the basic bracing of their structures.
It is becoming increasingly obvious
that unless adequate bracing against
lateral movement is provided, partition
cracking may cost more for main'
tenance than would have been the
case if additional strengthening had
been provided in the first place.
Studies of building sway caused
according to locality, by wind, earth
movements, and contraction or ex'
pansion of joints show that while
they are not necessarily dangerous,
the resultant cracking hastens deterio'
ration and, to say the least, it is un'
sightly.
An example of the problems indb
cated is the Chicago Apartment Build'
ing, a tall, narrowTramed building.
Its thick, flat plate floor
system (17 stories) is supported on
square concrete columns longitudin'
ally at about 13ft. centres. Trans'
versely there are two bays, each 12ft.
wide, on both sides of a 6ft. corridor.
Sheer walls have been placed at the
third column from each end on some
floors, on others at every fourth, giv'
ing a 50ft. spacing. Some, but not all,
of these sheer walls are carried to the
full height, and the result has been
obvious in savings made on the
structure.

“We can subscribe to that sentiment

Addressing the Prime Minister, Mr.
Winwood said:—
“We are very proud of what you
have done, and we are sure you will
endeavour to assist the Institute whet'
ever possible.
“It is our fervent wish you will be
able to continue the good work for

“We know that you appreciate the

who have assisted in the construction
of some of the finest structures in the

The Mayor of North Sydney, Aid.

congratulations to the Institute, said
there was a municipal angle he would
like to refer to.
“The first application for a building
permit was turned down, but the posh
tion changed later in regard to Town
Planning, and the Headquarters be'
came ‘a place of assembly.’ Then the
Council had very much pleasure in
granting the Institute permission to
erect a worthy edifice.
"■I hope the products of the InstL

building industry. There are a lot of
badly'constructed buildings in exist'

Reception at University.
Official guests, members and visitors
later assembled at a reception in the
Sutherland Room, The Union, Syd'
ney University, where they were re'
ceived and welcomed by the Federal
President, Mr. M. R. Hornibrook, and
Mrs. Hornibrook.
They were also afforded an oppor'
tunity of informally meeting the Prime
Minister, Mr. Menzies.
Some 200 attended this function,
which brought to a close a red'letter
day in the history of the Australian
Institute of Builders.
“The Daily News” property, ex'
tending from 75 to 77 St. Georges
Terrace and 18 The Esplanade, was
sold for more than £106,000 at public
auction.
Passed in at £61,500, the St.
George’s Terrace frontage was sold
later for an undisclosed figure to the
National Mutual Life Association of
Australia.
The Esplanade frontage, overlook'
ing the Swan River, was sold for
£45,000 to the West Australian Club,
which proposes to erect a multbstorev
building on the site for use as club
rooms and offices.
New premises for the Italian Club
in Fitzgerald Street, Perth, which
were opened on December 11, have
two beer gardens one for Summer
and one for Winter.
Costing about £12,500, the club is
built on a block sloping to the rear.
The ground floor at street level
carries through to the rear to form
the roof of an enclosed Winter beer
garden.
Walls are extended upwards 4ft.
beyond the flat roof to form an out'
door Summer beer garden.
A Perth artist, Mr. R. Juniper, has
been commissioned to paint a mural
frieze around the public space of the
banking chamber of the National
Bank branch in the new Prudential
Building, St. George’s Terrace.
To serve the rich hinterland of the
southern port of Albany, the Albany
Superphosphate Co. Pty. Ltd. factory
costing £1,350,000 was opened last
month.
Started in March, 1950, the works
were finished a year ahead of
schedule.
Road accidents are causing an eco'
nomic loss to Australia of £25,000,000
a year.
There is a road death every 4f
hours, a casualty every 12 minutes,
and an accident every minutes.
Seventy per cent, of road fatalities
are “suicides” who are primarily re'
sponsible for their own deaths; 23
per cent, are caused by another road'
user; seven per cent, are due to bad
roads, vehicle defects, weather, or
straying animals.

Building Permits.
Though there were 833 permits to
build issued by the Brisbane City
Council during November, there ap-
pears to be a tendency to build a
larger proportion of dwellings costing
less than £3OOO, and a decrease pro-
portion of 33 1/3% of the £3OOO to
£4OOO type, compared with the pre-
ceding month.
There is reason to believe hesitant
financial accommodation is not lessen-
ing—rather to the contrary. There
were 32 of this range in November,
compared with 48 in October. There
were 13 costing over £4OOO, the
highest being, respectively, £7500,
£6034, £6OOO, and £5398, £5400 and
£5OOO.
The interest on capital expenditure
alone, represents quite a large rental
on any one of these half-dozen homes.
Public Buildings.
The “Mater” Hospital is spending
£90,000 on a section to be used as a
medical school. A medical clinic is
spending £17,000 on doctors’ rooms.
A religious order is building at a
cost of £20,000 suburban park
buildings.
A building for sealed unit services
is to cost £37,585. The remodelling
of Lysaght’s warehouse will cost
£25,000.
At a cost of £5714, a new church
is being built.
A passenger elevator costing £6OOO
is to be installed at a Queen Street
emporium; and £7OOO is to be spent
on alterations to a shop front. There
does not appear to be stagnation in
any class of building, however,
utilitarian or otherwise, since £6OOO
spent on racing stables and £9OOO on
club amenities permit culture to keep
its head up with an expenditure of
£16,000 on classrooms at one second-
ary school, £6OOO at another, and a
£4OOO hall.
Industrial advancement is indicated
by brick kilns and offices costing
£13,500; workshops to cost, respec-
tively, £16,750, £20,000, £BOOO,
£4000; and six shops or blocks of
shops cost £35,000 in all.
Additions to a city block of offices
will cost £lO,OOO, and to a hotel
£12,000. New or enlarged petrol ser-
vice stations continue, with one each
at £3OOO, £3500, £3BOO, and a ware-
house with office £5OOO.
At least four owners are undaunted
by a magistrate’s dictum, in effect,
that people who build flats for letting
are “crazy,” since £ 17,000 in all was
spent on two new blocks and two
rejuvenations.
Plans for a co-operative hotel at
Broadbeach—near Surfers’ Paradise—
to cost £300,000 are being considered,
a beginning having already been
made in a building that will fit into
the larger scheme when it eventuates
in this rapidly-advancing centre.
Criticism of the Brisbane City
Council’s apparent lack of encourage-
ment to the defining of industrial sub-
urbs has brought about approvals for
at least six large areas for industrial
establishments that will cost more
than £1,000,000. The larger areas
made available in new suburbs will en-
able the new owners to provide lawns,
trees and shrubs and other amenities
in keeping with the new outlook.
At a cost of £190,000, a palatial
hotel—claimed to be the best country
hotel in Australia—has risen from
the ashes of the burnt-out North
Gregory Hotel at Winton, Central
Queensland, 400 miles west of Towns-
ville. It has been built for the Winton
Shire Council, whose revenue in rates
comes from graziers (97%) and
townspeople (3%).

:critics who made a joke of Queens-
.land’s ‘‘potentialities” when referred
:to by political representatives, since
Bso many of them are “coming good.”
lln useful minerals —as distinct from
ggold— such as uranium, copper, lead,
szinc and some rarer ones, continue to
:be disclosed in an increasing number
3of places.
Reference to the newer metals
cbeing mined in Queensland should
mot overlook the beach mining for
irutile and zircon now taking shape in
Ea larger way on Stradbroke Island,
which extends from Southport to the
end of Moreton Island, sepa-
irated by the narrow south passage.
’The present transporting of concen-
trates over a distance of twenty miles
sialong the beach and the rugged coun-
try to the western side of the island
iis to be superseded by a seven-mile
flropeway fro meast to west of it. It
tis intended to spend £500,000 on
rthis oroject, which is to be complet-
») ed in about twelve months’ time,
rwhen Titanium and Zirconium In-
dustries Pty. Ltd. will become the
t largest Australian producer of these
t metals, so much in demand in U.S.A.
As an offshoot of Consolidated
! Zinc Pty. Ltd., this mining industry,
i rather than a “venture,” has been
» operating under leases on Stradbroke
’! Island since 1947. The plan to re-
cover the metals involves the use of
: a suction dredge and concentrator,
»i operating on a large floating unit on
Mthe ocean side of the island. It will
meed 90 steel lattice towers in vary-
[ ing heights of 15ft. to 100 ft. to
i carry the ropeway over the big sand
m dunes. The buckets would carry a
• (constant stream of concentrates at
t the rate of 30 tons per hour. With
r reserves of at least 20 years in sight,
; a village would be erected half a
t mile from the dredging operations,
; and a new diesel power station of
1500 kilowatt capacity would be in-
! stalled at Dunwick, a one-time institu-
( tion for the aged on the western side
•of the island. The ropeway would
pass over a swamp for a distance of
1200 vards. The “blue lagoon” holds
;an abundance of fresh water. An
• amended Land Tax Act has now
, absolved from land tax the value of
metals, minerals, and coal in the land.
Forestry.
To overcome in time the inevitable
i shortage of timber in Queensland, the
’ Forestry Department has rJanned for
t the expenditure of £1,343,000 during
i the financial year 1954-55 to bring
this State’s forests of softwoods to
70,000 acres—the objective is 200,000
acres if conditions were satisfactory
| for new plantings. Further, areas
amounting to 38,000 acres of natural
j hardwood and Cypress pine stands
( would be “treated” to promote better
growth of trees regarded as suitable
I for future lumber.
Water Conservation.
Large-scale water conservation pro-
jects are developing towards ultimate
bounteous production of foods.
Townsville’s new water supply from
Mt Speck has been completed, at a
cost of £900,000.
Economies to the extent of at least
sixpence per gallon follow the instal-
lation of £150,000 worth of contain-
ers of petrol, kerosene and oil sin
tanks at Mackay’s man-made harbour,
three miles from this sugarapolis.
Another more important city fur-
ther south could, with advantage,
give attention to the pros and cons of
a deep-water port in the bay, in lieu
of a 45-mile journey up a tortuous,
muddy river which periodically floods
the city on its banks.
At Gatton Agricultural College, 60
miles from Brisbane, an Olympic
standard swjmming pool has been
completed, at a cost of £40,000, in
addition to the value of excavating
largely carried out by the pupils at
the College.
At Gladstone, between Rockhamp-
ton and Brisbane, reclamation to im-
prove this fine natural port, together
with port installations and improve-
ments, has cost £500,000.
It will surprise many people
throughout Australia to learn that
the amount of water that the Snowy
River scheme will ultimately impound.

will :be much less than the Burdekin
River scheme in North Queensland
will provide at a cost of .£70,000,000,
an infinitely smaller sum than the
estimated cost of Snowy River.
In addition to the Burdekin River,
another scheme under way the
Mareeba-Dimbulah scheme for irriga-
tion works also —is to cost <£20,000,000.
The great demand for labour on
sugar plantations, and in the crushing
plants, makes it difficult to keep up
the needs for labour on the irrigation
projects. The “wet season” in Janu-
ary and February causes a great
slowing-down also.
Home For the Aged.
At a cost of £44,000, a building of
three wings was added in December
to the structures at Chermside Gar-
den Settlement, about six miles from
the Brisbane G.P.O. Although Com-
monwealth monetary assistance is now
available for such purposes, several
liberal bequests and donations have
enabled this home for aged people
with “means” in some cases, and no
more than the retiring allowance un-
suitably termed the “old-age pension”
in others. Separate cottages are made
available to aged couples still able to

If engineers could gauge more
accurately the strength of a proposed
building, building costs could be re-
duced, Professor Francis, Dean of the
Faculty of Engineering, Melbourne
University, told members of the
Royal Victorian Institute of Architects
at their December General Meeting.
While great strides had been made in
recent years in assessing the strength
of constructions, there was still a
long way to go before complete
accuracy could be obtained, he said.
If owners of buildings were given
the right of stipulating the load their
buildings should carry—as were ship-
owners construction could be much
more economical.
This would avoid buildings being
erected capable of carrying two or
three times the load they would prob'
ably carry.
Experiments were constantly being
made by engineers with new building
methods which would reduce costs
without sacrificing safety, he added.
The Landlord and Tenant Act,
with its restrictions on owners obtain-
ing possession of their properties
when they want to rebuild, has been
again coming under fire from many
quarters. The Lord Mayor (Cr.
Sillick) told architects at the general
meeting that the development of the
city was being blighted because of its
operations. It would take politicians
who placed the good of the nation
before the safety of their seats to
alter the Act. (It is known that the
erection of several large buildings is
being held up because some tenants
will not give up possession.)
When an amending Bill to the
Landlord and Tenant Act was before
Parliament this month, it was urged
that owners should be allowed to
“buy a tenant out” so that possession
could be gained.
After many long years, Melbourne
has at last a planning authority,
the master plan is safe. The State
Parliament this month passed the ne'
cessary Bill to constitute the Mel'
bourne and Metropolitan Board of
Works as the planning authority, to
establish a Compensation Fund, and
to provide finance for the carrying
out of major works. The Minister in
charge of the Bill in the House said
its only fault was that it was 50 years
late, but “better late than never.”
The Royal Victorian Institute of
Architects has revived the annual
award of its Street Architeure Medal.
The 1954 award has been announced
and the winners are Grounds Rom'
berg and Boyd for a block of apart'
ments and two dwellings at 24 Hill
Street, Toorak.
The Prahran City Council has de'
cided to create a slum clearance fund
by allocating a penny from the gene'
ral rate of 2/2 in the £.
Mr. Eric Hughes, former President
of the R.V.1.A., has been elected to
fill the vacancy on the Architects
Registration Board caused by the re'
signation of Mr. A. S. Eggleston.
It is reported that the Prudential
Assurance Co. Ltd. will shortly de'
molish the old building, Salisbury
Chambers, which it owns, on the
southeast corner of Bourke and
Queen Street, to make way for its
new office building.
A large modern factory is to be
erected by Cerebos (Australia) Pty.
Ltd. on the Princes Highway, Clayton
North, near Dandenong.
Mclrwraith Industries Ltd. is an'
other business moving into the Dan'
denong area. The company has pur'
chased a site at the corner of Clow
and Thomas Streets.
The State Rivers and Water Supply
Commission has called tenders for a
rather unsuual job. A bid is asked
for the removal of 29 timber houses
and a hall from Tallangalla to the
new township of Bolga. The present
town of Tallangalla will later be sub'
merged, in a big water storage
scheme.
Few permits have been issued in
recent months for the erection of
blocks of flats in Melbourne suburbs.
The Prahran Council, however, has
issued permits for the erection of two
blocks, each of twelve units, in
Toorak.
Two old'style wards at the Austin
Hospital, Heidelberg, are to be con'
verted into modern units at an esti'
mated cost of £58,500.
The borrowing power of the
Country Roads Board was increased
by £6,000,000 in a Bill recently passed
by the State Parliament.
The Latrobe Valley Water and
Sewerage Board, which has a big
undertaking before it, has accepted
the tender of W. R. Hume Pty. Ltd.,
of Glenroy, for £405,000 for the
supply of 100,000 lin. ft. of R.C.
steel and other pressure pipes. An'
other contract for £199,870 has been
awarded to Etudes et Eterprises, 46
Elizabeth Street, for the construction
of a I,ooo,ooo'gallon storage basin.
Stephenson and Turner, Architects,
have accepted the tender of Lewis

to Leighton Pty. Ltd., Ash Street,
Sunshine, for the erection of a timber'
framed primary school building at
Norlane, Geelong.

rapidly. One growing need is office
accommodation and a public hall.
Keilor Shire, which adjoins the
Essendon Airport, has plans under
consideration for a new hall, offices,
and infant welfare centre.
A contract for £35,300 has been
awarded' to C. S. Ludbrook and Son,
Peel Street, Ballarat, for the erection
of the first section of a new high
school building in timber at Ballarat
East. The tender of G. A. Winwood
Pty. Ltd. for £19,476, for the erec'
tion of classrooms at Broadmeadows
East, has also been accepted.
Work is expected to start early in
the New Year on the erection of the
new College of Pharmacy in Royal
Parade, Parkville. The State Gov'
ernment bas undertaken to meet part
of the cost of the building, which is
estimated at about £300,000.
The Pharmaceutical Society of Vic'
toria purchased the site for the
building at a cost of £26,500 some
time ago.
The Government is to acquire the
building at present used as a college
at 360 Swanston Street, which has
been valued at £103,000. This will
probably be added to the Royal Mel'
bourne Technical College adjoining
at the rear.
The new building will provide ac'
commodation for 200 students and
will be a two'Storey steel and con'
Crete structure.
Preliminary plans were prepared by
Cowper Murphy Co., but these
have been taken over by the Public
Works Department, which will carry
out the work.
The surprise of the closing session
of the State Parliament was the re'
fusal of the Legislative Council to
pass the Bill - previously passed by
the Assembly—to continue control on
cement and iron and to prohibit the
demolition of dwellings without per'
mission. The refusal of the Council
to pass the Bill was not expected by
the Government.
Dandenong, the mushroom d ike
growing city on the fringe of the
metropolitan area, issued permits for
1503 new buildings to the value of
£2,416,534 for the year ended Sep'
tember 30. In the previous year the
figures were 1294 permits, value
£1,704,746.
The Royal Agricultural Society
and the Trotting Control Board will
spend about £300,000 on new stands
and buildings at the Show Grounds.
The plans provide for undercover
seating for 8500, with dancing halls,
clubrooms, liquor and snack bars, and
administrative offices for both the
Board and the Society. It is expected
the new building will be completed
in time for the Royal Show in
September.
Mr. Donald Ward, architect for
Myer Emporium Ltd., has prepared

The foundation stone has been laid
of the new Corpus Christi College of
the Regional Seminary at Glen
Waverley, for the Roman Catholic
Church. The Church has a 70acre
site at the junction of Waverley and
Watson’s Roads, in this quickly'
developing new residential district.
A large group of buildings has
been planned, comprising chapel, ad'
ministrative block, south wing, north
wing, and convent. The north wing
and convent will be built later. The
administrative block will be five

Great Importance To National

Nowadays Governments no longer

He was speaking at the new
£500,000 Lewis Berger paint factory
at Coburg, a Melbourne suburb. It
will produce 1,000,000 gallons of paint
a year.
Mr. Menzies said projects like the
Berger plant were of the greatest im'
portance to the Australian economy.
The superb importance in Aus'
tralia of manufacturing and industrial
development was now fully recognised,
and the nation today was one of the
most industrialised countries in the
world, Mr. Menzies added.

Adelaide News letter
Two oil companies have sought
land at Port Adelaide as sites for oil
refineries. Establishment of huge re'
fineries near Adelaide is regarded as
certain for the near future and would
provide some of South Australia’s
biggest post-war engineering and con'
struotion contracts. The names of the
interested companies have not been
specified, but Government circles state
that one firm has asked for 300 acres
and another for 200 acres.
Work on major additions, estimated
to cost about *200,000, has begun at
Kelvinator Australia Ltd.’s plant in
Finsbury. When completed, the fac'
tory will be among the most modern
in Australia. The present scheme,
part of a five'year expansion project,
will add 85,000 square feet to factory
floor space and allow a 20 per cent,
increase in production. The extern
sions were designed by Kelvinator s
engineering staff, in conjunction with
Messrs. Woods, Bagot, Laybourne'
Smith and Irwin. The contractors,
Wilckens and Burnside Ltd., expect
to finish the job within ten months.
The design provides for an orthodox
steel'framed construction, with galva'
nised iron covering.
Plans for another new city build'
ing, to be erected for the London
and Lancashire Insurance Co, Ltd.,
have been announced. The firm has
bought a site in Currie Street, and
will raise a three'Storey building
there. The new premises will pro'
vide modern office accommodation for
the company and allow substantial
letting space. Large areas of heat'
resisting glass will be included in the
25ft. facade. The architect, Mr. W.
C. B. Butt, is calling tenders, and
work is expected to start by the end
of January.
A method of foundation testing
which is new to South Australia is
being used for a new elevemstorey
city building. This block is to be
erected on the north'west corner of
Victoria Square for the Mutual Life
and Citizens’ Assurance Co. Ltd.
The new method will furnish data on
the low carrying capabilities of the
ground beneath the site. Previous
building design practice was to accept
a maximum loading of three tons per
square foot, as laid down in the
Building Act, or carry out actual soil'
loading tests. The latest method per'
mits concise and accurate data to be
obtained from laboratory tests of soil
samples. The new building, estimated
to cost *560,000, will be completed
about the end of next year. It was
designed by Bates, Smart & Me'
Cutcheon, of Melbourne, with Law'
son, Cheesman and Doley, of Ade'
laide, as associate architects. The
demolition of Morialta Chambers —
which previously occupied the site —
has been completed by the contrac'
tors, the S.A. Salvage Co., and con'
struclion work will begin almost
immediately.
A £500,000 building programme at
the Abattoirs has been announced by
the Minister of Agriculture (Mr.
Christian). Speaking in the House of
Assembly recently, he estimated that
the programme would take four or
five years. Arrangements were almost
completed for the letting of contracts
worth about £107,000, he said. The
building programme is connected
with a plan to develop and expand
the S.A. beef industry.
Metiers Ltd. will build a £150,000
factory in Manchester Street, Mile
End. It is designed to allow further
extensions in the future. The archi'
tect, Mr. Gordon C. Brown, has
called tenders, and work will start
soon. The factory, 3300 ft. by 166 ft.,
constructed mainly of concrete, will
be used as an assembly shop.
Work on the £45,000 Hotel
Seaton, at Seaton Park, will start
within the next eight weeks, and it
should be open for business by Christ'
mas, 195 5. The new hotel —on Tap'
ley’s Hill Road, nearly opposite the
Royal Adelaide Golf Club— will be
two'Storey, including twelve bed'
rooms, public and saloon bars, bottle
dept., lounge, dining room, beer
garden and car park. Lucas and
Parker are the architects.
Jaywoth' Besser Ltd.’s £lOO,OOO
brickmaking plant at Rosewater was
officially opened early in December,
and is now in production. The use
of an American Besser Vibrapac con'
crete blockmaking machine —the first
in S.A. —igives the new plant a poten'
tial output equal to a million bricks a
week.
Tenders are being called for con'
struction of a two'Storey building in
Gray Street, City, to house Alma
Shoes Ltd. A modern factory layout
is planned to enable a 25 per cent,
step'up in production. The cost will
be between £20,000 and £20,000.
The architects, Garlick, Jackman and
Gooden, hope that work will be
under way within eight weeks.
Detailed plans for the new nine'
storey Myer Emporium building in
Rundle Street have just been an'
nounced by the architect, Mr. Donald
Ward, of Melbourne. He said tenders
would be called in April, and the job
would take five years. There were
two tentative plans for the store —an
all'glass front, or a windowless store.
Adelaide City Council regulations at
present prevent complete adoption of
either plan, but Mr. Ward thinks that
a favourable decision will eventually
be given. Both plans will be submit'
ted to the Council. The building will

Erection of the new Roseworthy
Hotel, in Marin North Street, Rose'
worthy, has been completed. Saloon

cost upwards of £9OOO, is now
finished, apart from a few minor de-
tails. The architects were F. Kenneth

May has been fixed as the month
when production will start at the
Port Adelaide sulphuric acid plant.
The announcement has just been
made by Mr. N. B. Walker, manager
of Sulphuric Acid Ltd., who has just
returned from a five-month world in-
spection tour. The plant, which will
cost about £3,000,000, is expected to
produce 100,000 tons of sulphuric
acid a year —enough to make 300,000
tons of superphosphate. Principal
contractors for the job are Simon-
Carves (Australia) Pty. Ltd.
The new memorial hall at The
Wilderness School, Menindie, is near-
ing completion. The design, by Dean
W. Berry and Gilbert, includes several
unusual features. Something new in
school halls is the placing of the
stage, facing the breadth, instead of
the length of the building. This is
intended to create a “friendly” atmo-
sphere, as the stage will be used
mainly for child performances. Cost
of the job is about £15,000.
The first batch of homes at the
new satellite town near Salisbury will
be finished by Christmas. Eventually
the project will include hundreds of
houses built to Housing Trust de-
signs. Three contracting firms—Orlit,
M. and D. Richardson, and Elsdon

many others. The dwellings are
double-unit types, similar to those
erected in the Salisbury North Hous-
ing Trust area.
The building of a new civic centre
at Kingscote, a new series of houses
on soldier settlement blocks, a church
at Parndana, and enlargement of the
Parndana school, are among plans
for the future development of Kanga-
roo Island. Work is expected to start
soon on the civic centre, which in-
corporates the council offices, the dis-
Tfict hall, a supper room, women’s
test room, and two shops. Volunteer
labour will quarry and cart stone
needed for the proposed erection of
a new 90-seat church at Parndana,
and the Education Dept, is expected
to add two classrooms to the present
four-roomed Parndana school. The
batch of new houses to go up on
soldier settlement blocks will be five-
roomed.
A group of Port Lincoln tradesmen
and businessmen have registered a
private building company to operate
on Eyre Peninsula. They aim to pro-
vide a complete home-building ser-
vice, including help in planning and
layout of new homes, finding a block,
and, if required, laying out and plant-
ing a garden. All the main building
trades are represented in the firm, and
local materials will be used where
possible.
Plans and estimates for repairs to
St. Andrew’s Anglican Church,
Walkerville, will be placed before a
meeting of parishioners soon. The
church was severely damaged during
the March earthquake. The plans
are being prepared by Mr. Louis Wil-
liams, of Melbourne, in conjunction
with Adelaide architect Dean W.
Berry, who is a leading S.A. expert
on soil formation.
Tenders for erection of the new
Christian Science Church in North
Terrace will be called soon. The
architects, Woods, Bagot, Laybourne-
Smith and Irwin, are putting finishing
touches to the plans. The church, of
stone and brick construction, will be
built at the corner of Tavistock
Street. It will include a 350-seat
auditorium, reading and book sale
rooms, creche, church offices, and
Sunday School.
A novel method is being used to
add a fourth floor to Eddys Ltd.’s
warehouse in Currie Street, City.
The roof has been jacked up as a
whole, and the walls are being built
up to meet it. Eight independent
jacks are used in the process, which
has not been used in Adelaide before.
The contractors are McEntee and
Williams.
Another official hint has been
given of Government plans to develop
Port Pirie as a deep-sea port. The
Minister of Marine (Mr. Mclntosh),
in a letter to Mr. Davis, M.P., gays
that S.A. Harbours Board engineers
are now preparing plans for deepen-
ing the harbour and approaches, and
reconstruction of wharves. Each pro-
ject will cost “more than £30,000,”
and will have to be submitted for
approval to the Public Works Stand-
ing Committee, the letter says. The
Minister gave no indication of when
the project would be started.
Meanwhile, at Cowell, the contrac-
tor, Mr. Ern Riches, has started work
on the town’s foreshore improvement
programme. Foundations have been
laid for a building to serve the beach
caravan park, and construction work
is under way. Next on the list is a
playground for children.
Hundreds of applications have
been received for the Housing Trust’s
latest batch of design. The Trust
now has a range of more than 25 dif-
ferent designs. Two are two-storied,
and prices range from £3OOO to
£4235.
The South Australian Contempor-
ary Architects’ Group has just pub-
lished a brochure on modern home
building. The Group states its object
as, “to further the interests of sound,
sane architecture to meet to-day’s
home - building conditions.” The
brochure lists 22 homes and flats in
the metropolitan area which the
Group considers to be the answer to
present-day home-building problems.

ing industry, aggravated by shortages
of material, high costs, and industrial
strife, is getting worse.
Many builders believe that if condi-
tions continue to deteriorate, a crisis
may be reached early next year.
Latest move in the State’s building
mess was a deputation sent by cix
building trades unions to the Premier
(Mr. Playford) this month. The
deputation, led by the Secretary of
the Building Trades Federation (Mr.
E. H. Thorp) asked that:—
• A committee of enquiry be set up
to investigate the industry.
• Materials in short supply should
receive priority for home-building.
• Master builders and building
workers be registered.
The Premier, in rejecting the sug-
gestions, had the backing of most
Adelaide contractors, but disquiet
remains.
The plain fact is, if supplies of
building materials do not improve
rapidly, and if costs do not come
down, the rate of building may
slacken to a dangerous degree.
Already, several major city building
jobs have been postponed in the
hope that costs, now almost prohibi-
tive, will fall.
SYDNEY NEWSLETTER
Some 250 members of the N.S.W.
building industry, guests and Asso-
ciates, attended the Building Industry
Dinner in Sydney at the end of
November.
Veteran Newcastle Master Builder
Charles G. Davis received the 1954
Florence M. Taylor Award for out-
standing and meritorious service to
the Australian building industry. This
Award was received last year by Mr.
Charles F. Gage, of Sydney.
Millions of super feet of timber —
which constituted an alhtime record —
were being discharged or awaiting un'
loading at Sydney in early December,
following the waterfront strike.
Building, both domestic and com'
mercial. maintained its upward trend.
The N.S.W. Housing Commission
completed over 1100 more houses in
1954 than in the previous record year
of 1953. The Commission built 5690
homes in 1954, compared with 4585
in 1953.
Official figures show that 3100
homes had been completed since
July 1 last—easily the best rate of
construction ever achieved by the
Commission, which has now built
3 3,630 houses, providing accommoda'
tion for over 140,000 people.
The N.S.W. Housing Commission
recently took over its first alhconcrete
block home, built by Dura'Crete Pro'
ducts Pty. Ltd. at Unanderra, and
sanctioned a further 20 dwellings of
this construction.
An estate which will accommodate
over 400 homes, a school, shopping
centre, and open parks, was opened
near Wollongong.
Development of the estate is
planned in stages to provide attrac'
tive, moderately'priced homes. The
enterprise having been promoted by
Sir Lindsay Parkinson (A/asia) Pty.
Ltd., the estate was named “Lindsay
Park.’’
A recent amendment to the Land'
lord and Tenant Act exempts new
dwellings and also houses which had
not, either whole or in part, been the
subject of a lease at any time before
the commencement of the Act.
A new Sydney building for John
Fairfax and Sons Pty. Ltd., news'
paper proprietors, will cost
£2,000,000.
Additions to the Waverley Brewery,
Sydney, are estimated at £25,000,
and a new office and factory building
for Wright, Stephenson Pty. Ltd. at
Alexandria will cost £24,000,
The advent of 10 p.m. closing has
given hotel construction and renova'
tion a decided impetus. A new hotel
at Randwick will cost £60,000, and
alterations to another in the same
area will involve £32,800 expenditure.
Many other suburban and country
hotels are to be extensively altered
and renovated.
Griffs (S.A.) Ltd., of Adelaide, re'
cently purchased a Pitt Street'
Castlereagh Street property from
John Danks and Son Pty. Ltd. for
£270,000. Premises will become a
retail furnishing store.
A large Sydney building contract
involves an expenditure of £350,000.
Extensions to factory and showrooms
for Jones Bros. Pty, Ltd., Campbell
Street, will be done in two stages.
The Prime Minister, Mr. Mensies,/
set the foundation stone of the Aus'
tralian Institute of Builders’ £65,000
headquarters at North Sydney, in the
presence of a large gathering.
The N.S.W. Premier, Mr. Cahill,
announced that the 140'year'dd
S'.ate Parliament House in Macquarie
Street is to be demolished, and a new
building erected.
The move has been taken 112
years after designs were first invited
for a State Parliament House.
Besides the new wing being built
at Barker College, Hornsby, at a cost
of £52,524, an additional Memorial
Wing, to cost £72,000, will also be
erected.
The Y.W.C.A. plans an early start
on a £40,000 hostel at Wollongong,
Although the N.S.W. building in'
dustry is still handicapped by irksome
restrictions and labour and material
shortages, it staged a remarkable come-
back in the last half of 1954. The
housing section of the industry is
almost fully engaged on construction
of all types of homes, and increased
efficiency , and greater output have
kept prices down.
The commercial and industrial sec-
tion of the industry is in great de-
mand for erection of shops, fac-
tories, and commercial buildings of all
kinds. Present indications are for a
continuation of this work for some
time to come.
The industry has successfully com-
bated inflationary trends, and has
generally held down prices to within
economic limits.
Given ample materials and skilled
labour, plus the necessary finance,
1955 should attain a new high in
prosperity.
