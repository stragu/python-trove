When you stop-over at Eagle Farm 1A.N.A.1, particularly note
the beautifully decorated walls. They are of insulating Cane-ite
with colorful murals, such as this map of the world. You can feel
the coolness—even in Brisbane summer heat. Cane-ite INSULATES
as well as decorates. The atmosphere is always refreshingly cool in
the Eagle Farm lounge.

Air Line Terminals get that smart
ultra-modern look at little cost—with
C.S.R. BUILDING MATERIALS
Next time you travel by air look
around you in the Air Terminals.
Whether you travel hy A.N.A, or
T.A.A. you’ll see the latest ideas
in building materials —low cost
building materials put to the
most modern use. At Eagle Farm
(A.N.A.), Cane-ite is used for
the walls —and this is where it’s
really brought home to you that
Cane-ite insulates as well as
decorates. Even in a Brisbane
summer the atmosphere is cool
inside this terminal because of
the Cane-ite walls which are
beautifully decorated with murals.
600 miles away in Sydney you
will see the smartness of C.S.R.
Floor Tiles in the T.A.A. termi-
nal. Thousands of air travellers
walk backwards and forwards
over this floor almost every hour
hour of the day. Yet the tiles
always look fresh and gleaming
it takes only one polisher
three-quarters of an hour in the
small hours of the morning to
keep them looking so smart.
Then hack at Eagle Farm
again look up at the Cane-ite
Acousti-Tile Ceiling in the dining
room which absorbs two-thirds of
all noise. That explains why,
with all the noise of arriving and
departing planes and buses and
messages over the public address
svstem, there is still an atmos-
phere of calm.
All modern airport terminals
give you the impression of being
surrounded by efficiency and
streamlined comfort. You can
introduce this same efficiency,
smartness and insulated comfort
into your own business, factory
premises or home. For lower
tenders always ask for quotations
which include C.S.R. Building
Materials.

Dine at Eagle Farm and you dine in
calm, restful quiet, with most of the busy
airport's noisiness EXCLUDED. That's
because the Cane-ite Acousti-Tile ceilina
absorbs two-thirds of all noise.
Walk into the Sydney A.N.A. City
Terminal and the smartness of C.S.R.
floor tiles takes your eye. Even after the
busiest day this floor looks fresh and
smiling. Requires minimum attention.

These attractive, inexpensive, light and easy
to erect aluminium houses have been developed to
meet the special requirements of tropical regions
and are proving to be the answer to the many
building problems of to-day.
The Kingstrand aluminium house is highly
resistant to industrial and marine atmospheres, is
unaffected by heat, damp, vermin and insects,
whilst its surface reflecting the sun’s rays keeps
interiors considerably cooler than in other types of
constructions.

THE H.C.S. THERMOSTAT GIVES
★ Temperature Control
★ Pre-Heat Control
★ Griller Control
Sotchwell H.C.S. design makes installation
easy; its smart appearance helps build sales
for retailers, and its automatic control of
pre-heat, oven temperature and griller control
(all by one knob) delights the housewife.
''H.C.S/' are hydraulically controlled and
particularly suitable for ovens where the
element arrangement demands flexibility
between the thermally sensitive element and
the external control knob.
Relative positions of the Satchwell "H.C.S."
phial and knob are limited only by the length
of the capillary tube.
Pilot lamps indicate when elements are carry-
ing current and when oven has reached desired
temperature, after initial heating. Oven
thermometer is unnecessary.
Temperature range of the four "H.C.S."
thermostats is 200/600 c F. The control knobs
are marked 200/550°F. Additional control
switch is unnecessary, as in the "off" position,
the contacts will not close no matter how low
the ambient temperature.
FOUR TYPES OF “HC.S.” THERMOSTATS
1. A single-stage instrument suitable for side and
bottom heat cookers.
2. A two-stage instrument for high loaded side and
bottom heat cookers, having high loadings for quick
pre-heating.
3. A three-stage instrument for top and bottom heat
cookers wherein the top elements are used for grilling
(broiling) and also quick pre-heating.
4. Three-stage instrument similar to 3 above but with
provision for additional control by time switch.

LYSAGHT Zincanneal eliminates lire risks, gives any type of
construction the strength and rigidity of steel, and can be
quickly and easily erected at low cost! More important still,
because its protective zinc coating is actually annealed to the
base sheet, it offers an exceptionally high degree of resistance
to atmospheric and other forms of corrosion. Cuts painting costs,
too, because its matte surface takes paint perfectly, without
primers. Available in both plain and corrugated sheets; all

GENERAL MOTORS - HOLDEN'S LTD.
£11,000,000 EXPANSION PROGRAMME.
SYDNEY, MELBOURNE, ADELAIDE.
An £11,000,000 expansion programme to raise the output of Holden cars
and utilities to 200 a day, or 50,000 a year, was recently announced by the managing
director General Motors'Holdens Ltd., Mr. H. E. Bettle.
He said the company was exploring the possibility of exporting Holdens to
New Zealand, Hong Kong, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
The expansion programme alfects mainly the Sydney, Melbourne, and
Adelaide manufacturing plants, which will be enlarged by one million square feet,
making the company s total floor space 3,535,017 square feet, or 81 acres.
Mechanised Foundry to be Doubled-
At Fisherman’s Bend, Victoria, the total floor area of buildings will be mcreas'
ed from 833,322 to 1,118,672 sq. ft. The mechanised grey iron foundry will be
doubled in size and the programme will include not only expansion of the present
machine shops but an entirely new 133,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant housing a
training centre, plant services, and an additional canteen to seat 800.
At Woodville, in South Australia, the body building and metal stamping
plant is being increased to give a total floor area of 1,546,740 sq. ft., while the
installation of 69 additional presses, costing £654,576, will increase to 202 the
number of presses in use.
At Pagewood, in New South Wales, the floor area of the vehicle assembly
and Fngidaire refrigerator manufacturing divisions will be increased from 283,000
to 447,745 sq. ft. to make possible the assembly of bodies from sheet metal pressings.
Mr. Bettle said the programme would increase the funds employed in the
business to £32,000,000. Much of the machine tools and equipment, which would
cost £7,611,000, had already been delivered from Australian and overseas sources.
In Melbourne, the engine, transmission, and gear sections w'ould be enlarged,
and an additional machine shop would be provided for the manufacture of steering
and front and rear axle assemblies.
Mr. Bettle said the company had put back into the business 80.2 per cent, of
all postwar profits- There were now 10,300 employees and 3,000 suppliers.
I would like, he said, to stress that the Australian public has helped make
this development possible by the support they have given in the purchase of our
products. We should also like to record the fact that we are grateful for the
support whicn has been given us by the Federal and State Governments.”
The present expansion does not include any plans for the 152'acre site at
Dandenong, Victoria, bought late in 1951 as a protection against future develop'
mental needs, though consideration was being given to projects which might be
undertaken at that site at a later date.

This new modern office building
which was recently completed and
occupied, is of reinforced concrete
construction with brick infills, the
whole of the external walls being
cement rendered.
The ground floor contains the order
office, general office, secretary’s office
and staff amenities; on the first floor
is the board room and executive
offices, while on the flat roof are two
staff lunch-rooms with access to a
large flat roof area for staff activities.
A special feature is the parquet
block flooring in which is used most
available N.S.W. hardwoods, including
tallow-wood, mahogany, pink ash and
Tasmanian oak. The parquetry is laid
in a series of patterns in order to
illustrate the various patterns common-

How Can We Be
So Silly?
When a report was required about
English Bomb Shelters —a matter of
life and death to us in Australia when
the laps, were almost here, as it was
to the British people when the Ger-
mans were flying over England, the
Australian Government sent solicitors
to England to advise them on airraid
shelters. We had plenty of Archi-
tects and Builders fitted in knowledge
and experience to make this investi'
gation, who were not given an op-
portunity.
Something sillier than that is hap-
penmg once more in political circles
right now. The Government has ap'
pointed Mr. C. E. Martin, former
Attorney-General, who knows how to
appoint judges, to be Minister for
Transport. Usually before anyone
knows “a from a bull’s foot about a
subject, they devote years of study
and application to that subject. The
question is asked what does Mr.
Martin know about the control of
trains, trams and buses?

An Epoch - Making Railway Train
QUEENSLAND'S NEW “INLANDER.”
By F. O. NIXON.
On Sunday, Ist February, 1953
Brisbane had its first introduction to
its first complete Diesel-Electric power-
ed train. It was an epoch-making oc-
casion when 120 invited guests of the
Transport Minister (Mr. J. E. Duggan)
and the Railway Commissioner (Mr.
G. V. Moriarty) made the 200-mile
journey to Toowoomba and back.
The general opinion was that there
was no better train in Australia and
very few in America that could be
regarded as being better, notwithstand-
ing the comparatively narrower track
gauge of 3ft. 6in. in Queensland.
Despite this narrowness, the width
of the air-conditioned car body, 55ft.
6in. in length, is 9ft. 0-3/16th inch.
The first of these trains to be com-
pleted, named the “Inlander,” cost
£400,000, and, being one of nine
trains that will be completed from
time to time in the near" future, the
total cost needs no stressing. It takes
up the challenge of the growing trade
in air travel, and railway fares are not
expected to be increased by travelling
in the new trains. The decentralisa-
tion of population, urged by Professor
Titterton as a safeguard should atomic
destruction on big cities ever come to
pass, will be assisted in no small
degree by the provision of air-
conditioned, grit - free trains. And
those with a love for the beautiful
will find no lack in the colour schemes
of the carriages meticulously developed
by Professor R. F, Cummings, Dean
of the Faculty of Architecture at the
Queensland University, in association
with Mr. Athol K. Bretnall, who is
Lecturer in Interior Decoration and
Colour at the same place of learning.
In a consultative capacity these
gentlemen worked in Association with
the Railway Department’s engineers
and the Commonwealth Engineering
(Q’land) Pty. Ltd., the builders of
these trains. While the traditional
dark walls and upholstery may have
an appeal to those who shudder at the
base treatment by the public of public
conveyances in light shades of colour-
ing, the step has been taken to recog-
nise the psychology of colour in its
relation to harmonies that create a
pleasant atmosphere of unobtrusive-
ness. Two distinctive patterns of
specially-woven super wilton carpets
for the exclusive use of these Queens-
land trains and laid on a specially im-
ported linoleum are in perfect har-
mony with the interior scheme.
In all there are ten separate colour
schemes for sleeping compartments,
two for sitting cars, two for corridors,
and one for the dining car. The
predominating colour of ceilings is an
“almost white,” chosen for its light'
reflective qualities arising from the
base covering throughout of P.V.C.
(poli' vinyl chloride) plastic fabric.
Similar material with a different grain
is used for upholstery.
The seating and sitting accommoda'
tion of the train provides for 203
persons placed in the following order
of the eleven vehicles from the loco'
motive.
With the exception of the trans'
Australian Railway, Queensland is the
only State with 2nd-class sleeping cars.
Overall length (excluding locomo'
tive), 625 ft. sin. (with Diesel-Electric
locomotive, 681 ft. 6in.). The exter-
nal colour of the train is soft dove
grey, appropriately broken with bord'
ers of contrasting shades of colour.
This new train marks a very dis-
tinct departure from Queensland’s
beautifully ' timbered carriages. The
“Inlander” and its family are all steel,
and with aluminium sheeted with auto'
made couplers designed as a safety
factor against telescoping and shatter'
ing in the event of a collision. Rub'
ber mountings of parts liable to create
vibration are used wherever they can
be used to advantage. Air condition'
ing in all carriages provides for a
relative humidity of between 50 and
70 per cent, maximum and minimum
in cars of 80 degrees F. and 70 degrees
F. respectively.
Winter will have no more terrors
than Summer in future long'distance
travelling. Sound deadening is pro'
vided for in “Rubbatox,” a rubber
base compound heavily loaded with
granulated cork, and the roof and
sides are given attention by similar
means. Having encompassed the
horror of heat in railway travelling in

NEW BITUMINOUS PAVING PLANT AT PROSPECT
LARGEST, MOST MODERN BELOW EQUATOR
Scientific Control in All Processes
The new premixed bituminous con-
crete paving plant which is about to
commence production at Prospect, is
the largest and most modern of its
kind in the Southern Hemisphere.
The company responsible for its
establishment. Bituminous Pavements
Pty. Ltd., is a new, virile member of
the N.S.W. Associated Blue Metal
quarries Group. The plant has been
built near Greystanes Park, adjacent
to the long'established Prospect
Quarry.
Bituminous Pavements Pty. Ltd.
with the aid of trained technicians,
under the direction of the Works
Manager, Mr. Gordon Lake, will pro'
duce 400 tons of Premixed bituminous
asphaltic paving material a day.
This material will be delivered to
public bodies and Councils, and the
company will also hire out the latest
Barber'Greene Olding Asphalt Finish'
er, which is capable of laying and
finishing from 3000 to 4000 lineal feet
of hot mix each eight hours.
This unique machine is the latest
of six in use in N.S.W., the others
are operated by the Department of
Works (1), Main Roads Department
(1), Sydney City Council (2), and
one other pnvately'owned machine.
With auxiliary roadmaking and
other plant available from the com'
pany, a speeding-up in paving is now
expected.
Gravity Used.
The Premixed Paving plant, de'
signed under the direction of the
Works Manager, Gordon Lake, is sit'
uated on sloping land in such a
manner that the very fullest advantage
is taken of gravity.
The aggregates, blue metal and
sand, are unloaded on to conveyor
belts at the highest point of the
plant, situated on the slope of the
hill. The material is then transferred
by 240 ft. x 24 in. Goodyear con'
veyor belt to five circular bins, each
of three'ton capacity. Here the ag'
gregates are thoroughly mixed.
Air-Controls.
The batch is then weighed into bins
of six different sizes.
It is here that an ingenious solution
to many problems becomes apparent,
as the result of a great deal of study
and work by Mr. Lake.
At all stages, each machinery and
plant control is operated by air, com'
pletely eliminating the old'type man-
ual controls. The safety factor is ex-
cellent, and the controls work with the
utmost efficiency and smoothness.
The batches of aggregates are
weighed with scales of the greatest ac'
curacy, and only when the right mix-
ture has entered the bins, can the
doors be operated by the air controls.
All that is required is a console
of seven levers, controlled by two
trained men.
In fact, the whole plant is operated
by seven men and a foreman, with
the aid of this ingenious air-control
system.
After leaving the mixing bins, the
aggregates pass to two 240 ft. x IBin.
conveyors, to the Blending Section,
where manufacture of the various mix-
tures is completed.
These products are;
• Asphaltic Concrete;
• General Hot Mix Material;
• Cold Mix.
Mr. Lake told a “Construction" re'
porter that it was proposed to estab'
lish a laboratory in the near future
to ensure the fullest technical control
of all stages of manufacture.
Blending Section.
In this section, as in all others in'
spected, great ingenuity is evident.
The bitumen is mixed in two 230'
gallon tanks, heated to 250'350 deg.
Fahrenheit. These drums, 18ft. x 4ft.,
are driven by two 25 H.P. electric
motors.
The material is then weighed into
two 25 cwt. mixers for processing in
its final stages.
From a 10'ton capacity bin, it is
batch'weighed into a Parker Pug'Mill
(also air'operated), and finally the
completed mix enters the seven-ton
receiving hopper for delivery.
Mr. Lake pointed out that as the
result of scientific control at each
stage, the bitumen mix arrives hot
from the Prospect plant at the cor'
rect temperature ready for paving.
He said his company has spared no
possible expanse to introduce the lat'
est manufacturing practices to Aus'
tralia, and he was confident that the
products would give the ultimate in
service.
Qualified technical control ensured
this, Mr. Lake declared.
Manufacturing processes will con'
form to the Department of Main
Roads standards, he added.
Simplicity of Operation.
“Construction" was impressed great'
ly by the simplicity of operation at
each stage of manufacture, and the
THE RECEIVING BOOT.
Work proceeding on the Receiving Boot. This view shows clearly how full advantage has been
taken of the sloping hillside to use gravity as much as possible in every operation. In the
far distance is Greystanes Park, the scene of the recent Scouts’ Jamboree.

vast amount of planning entailed in
the layout of the plant.
As pointed out earlier, full use of
gravity has been made throughout
the plant except the conveyors. This
has been made possible by the choice
of an excellent sloping plant, close
by the Prospect quarry. Special roads
were graded into the property, to en-
sure quick delivery of materials, and
prompt despatch of the mixes.
All the bitumen kettles are elec'
tncally heated, and are lagged with
six inches of slagwool inside a nine'
inch brick building, reducing the loss
of temperature to about 5 degrees per
hour.
The 5000'gallon tanks are equip'
ped with three-element electric heat'
ers, and are controlled by time clocks
and thermostats.
A substation, which breaks down
electricity from 11,000 volts to 415
volts or 240 volts, is erected adjacent
to the plant.
Many other modern devices and
equipment, too numerous to mention,
are incorporated into the design and
layout of this modern bituminous pav-
ing plant.
Amenities.
And in the planning for efficient
production, the management has erect-
ed a spacious amenities block for the
employees, a main office built on bun-
galow lines, stores, workshops, and a
laboratory.
There is also a comfortable care'
taker s cottage, and other cottages
will later be erected for the plant per'
sonnel.
[Footnote; It is interesting to note
that one of Sydney’s oldest asphalt
firms, the N.S.W. Asphalt Co., Glebe,
has built up again to lay the hot-mix
for any public body or contractor or
7
private firm.
Mr. Morris Black, until recently
Technical Engineer with Emoleum
(Australia) Ltd., will be in charge of
the companys' operations.
He is the son of Mr. Robert Black,
whose wide experience in road build'
ing is well known throughout the
State.]

Christ Church
Sh Ives, Sydney
Architect: N. W. McPherson.
The master plan takes into consid-
eration the shape of the site and the
approaches to it, the natural fall of
the land, the question of orientation,
and the presence of existing building.
The main floor is roughly level with
the present floor. The plan shows the
present building extended to form the
hall, this being linked by a covered
way to the new church with its side
aisles, nave, chancel, sanctuary and
baptistry. The architecture is simple,
using modern materials in logical ways.
Its effect depends on its proportions,
and the harmonious use of colour.
Materials are influenced to some ex-
tent by the existing work, as it is in'
tended to use face brick with a tile
roof externally, with suitable tonings.
The tower constitutes an essential
focal point, drawing together the low*
er spreading shapes and housing the
stair linking lower floor, main floor
and organist’s loft, while the upper sec-
tion would permit the use of bells.
COST OF REPAIRS IN BRITAIN
Nearly Three Times Pre-war Figure.
The Incubus of Rent Control.
In a report published last year, The
Royal Institution of Chartered Sur-
veyors in Britain made proposals for
short-term amendment of the Rent
Restrictions Acts which would allow
increases in controlled rents to cover
the increased cost of repairs. These
proposals have received strong support
in many quarters as a fair and prac-
deal scheme for arresting the de-
terioration of houses and for securing
their adequate maintenance and repair.
In their report, the Institution pub'
lished a detailed analysis of repair
costs which showed that, in March,
1951, costs were 275 per cent, of the
pre-war (1939) figures. The Institu-
tion has recently made a further
analysis which shows that, in Novem-
ber, 1952, repair costs had risen to
293 per cent, of the 1939 figures.
The same problem, of course, exists
here, and not only is rent control
forcing property-owners to allow their
houses and buildings to deteriorate for
want of paint and repairs but it has
also prevented private enterprise from
building houses, flats and office build-
ings for lack of a reasonable return
on their investment.
How long can this unfair, un-
balanced and crippling situation be
tolerated?
Without building there can be no
progress.

from Mona Vale Road.
THE MASTER PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT.
Walls in solid black represent existing work; those in outline the first stages, and th ose
hatched the later developmental stages. It is proposed, first of all, to extend the present
building by enlarging the vestry section to a full bay and adding a further bay and basement.
The building will then consist of four bays—two comprising the church and the other two
the hall (When the new church is built, the four bays will become the full hall.) The
basement will be the Kindergarten. Later, a kitchen will be added and the basement will
be extended underneath it.

NEW WONDER CHEMICAL
Checks Erosion and Increases Fertility.
“Krilium,” a new chemical de'
veloped by Monsanto Chemical Com'
pany in the United States of America,
is expected to play an important part
in preventing soil erosion and in im'
proving the natural fertility of the soil
by making it watet'permeable.
Tests are to be carried out for the
State Electricity Commission of Vic-
toria, the Soil Conservation Authority
and the Department of Agriculture
by officers of Monsanto Chemicals
(Aust.) Ltd. when experimental quan-
tides of the chemical arrive from
America in September.
Krilium is a plastic in powdered
form. Its use establishes a water'
permeable crumb structure on the soil,
giving a stabilised surface which assists
ready germination of seed.
Extensive tests carried out in
America and Canada have shown that
Krilium is an effective and, when pro'
duced on a commercial scale, economi'
cal agent for controlling rain erosion
—a problem encountered on major
earth' moving construction, housing
projects, in the construction and main'
tenance of camp installations, tennis
courts, sporting fields and in similar
areas subjected to heavy surface wear.

EXTERIOR PERSPECTIVE FINAL STAGE
ST. JAMES’ CHURCH, CARLTON, SYDNEY.
Architect: N. W. McPherson. Master Builder: C. F. Gage & Sons.
The first stage of this new suburban Church is at present being built. External face bricks
are from “Austral,” while the internal walls are fawn shades of “Chromatex” featuring special
moulded bricks to piers and windows. The Sanctuary, Chancel and the crossing of nave are
being provided at this stage together with the clergy vestry over which is the organ loft.
Until a pipe organ is provided this loft will be used for additional seating. A covered way
will connect to the parish hall in which the choir will robe. Later stages will add the transept,
western end of nave and the tower. (Blocks courtesy Rector, St. James’, Carlton.)

RENOLD CHAINS (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD.
NEW PLANT AT BENALLA, VICTORIA.
During 1949 Renold Chains ac-
quired a seventeen-acre site at Benalla,
Victoria, for the manufacture of pre-
cision - made chains.
At that period, building restrictions
and the acquisition of materials being
difficult, it was decided to purchase an
ex-wartime structure, then available at
the Tocumwal Aerodrome.
This structure was a timber-framed
workshop 336 ft. long x 62ft. wide
with no natural lighting. It was de-
molished at Tocumwal, moved to
Benalla site and the framework re-
erected on a new reinforced concrete
base. The side walls were re-designed
with continuous adjustable louvred
windows and the company success-
fully planned the orientation of their
working plant and equipment to the
confines of the remodelled workshop.
The east end of the workshop was
planned for offices, and as these ex-
tended beyond the basic structure
enabled the architects to design a
modern entrance front to the building
facing Tatong Road.
A feature of this projected front is
a staff refreshment room with the glass
outer wall overlooking the surround'
ing landscape. The offices have
asphalt floor tiles and colourful walls
and ceilings.
Heat Treatment Section.
The Heat Treatment Section is in
a separate building adjacent to the
main factory. This building is 75ft. x
67ft. x a height up to 30ft., where
the furnaces are installed on a steel
mezzanine floor. This building is
framed in reinforced concrete and the
walls constructed of cement - sand
bricks. Inside the building there is an
enclosed chemical testing laboratory.
The employees’ amenities block,
constructed of cement-sand bricks, is
adequately planned with separate male
and female wash- rooms, showers,
lockers, toilets and a first-aid room.
Wash bowls are circular type with
centre control spray for hot and cold
water; showers are tiled.
The cement-sand bricks were all
made on the site by the builders, who
organised installation of machines,
moulds and a team of local men who
quickly and efficiently turned out
many thousands of first-class bricks.
The employees lunch in a new
modern and colourful timber and cor*
rugated asbestos room.
A home for the works manager was
constructed at the south end of the
site and situated in an attractive rural
setting. This home is spacious and
liberally fitted with in-built furniture.
Architect was Stuart P. Calder and
Associate; Consulting Engineer, C. J.
E. Hudspeth, and Builder, A. A.

Home for Elderly
Is Splendid Concept
On Saturday last the Chief Justice,
the Hon. K. W. Street, opened a
£55,000 home which, when complet'
ed, will accommodate 65 elderly wo'
men who have nowhere to live.
The home, called “Yallambi” from
an aboriginal word meaning “dwelling
place,” has been erected by the Bap'
tist Homes Trust. To date a total
of £25,000, raised entirely through
subscriptions, has been spent on the
building.
Yallambi occupies a beautiful posh
tion facing the Pennant Hills Road,
and its huge lounge'room windows
command a magnificent vista of the
Dundas Valley and a considerable
area of Sydney, and as far as the
Gib at Bowral.
Later Additions.
The architects, Messrs. E. B. WiL
shire and H. R. Hodges, of Sydney,
have designed what the Baptist Home
Trust describes as the most modern
home of its kind in Australia.
At present the building consists of
27 single and four double bedrooms.
The administrative block, matron’s
and staff quarters, and all communal
rooms, including four spacious
lounges, a dining room, kitchen, and
bathroom are ready for occupation.
A further block still to be built
will contain 30 bedrooms.
As construction progresses, six
semi'detached “cottagettes” to house
elderly couples will be erected in the
landscaped six'acre grounds.
Bright colour schemes make the
home a cheery, happy place. Bed'
rooms have stained floors, haze green
walls, and primrose ceilings, corridors,
koala grey walls and primrose ceilings.
The dining room, where tables will
each seat six guests, has a combustion
stove set in sandstone, a cream ceiling,
and old ivory walls.
The entire layout of the garden
and grounds was carried out under
the direction of the curator of the
Botanic Gardens, Mr. R. H. Ander'
son.
MASONITE FIRMS’
CONVENTION.
About 100 Masonite distributors
From all States will visit Newcastle
an March 16 for a convention.
Two days of the convention will
be devoted to a tour of the Masonite

„ A visit to Shoal Bay, Port
Stephens, has also been arranged.
Miranda Building
Achievement
15 Homes Erected in
Three Months.
Just twelve weeks after building
started, fifteen new houses at Miranda
were ready for occupancy.
The houses are 11'square three'bed'
room brick cottages, and have been
sold for £3775 each.
The contractors, Taylor Woodrow
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of a
British construction and engineering
company, opened a prototype home
for inspection last October. The com'
pany gave an undertaking that the
houses would be ready to live in with'
in three months.
According to a company spokes'
man, “the whole secret is in keeping
up the supply of materials and hav'
the labour organised.
Organisation meant that the work
was always kept up to the gangs, and
there was not much waste time on the
job, he added.
Before the houses were finished a
few days ago, civil engineering gangs
were busy on street construction and
layout of another 18 houses in an ad'
joining street.
Preliminary work has also com'
menced, with a view to future devel-
opment, on another estate at Wool'
ooware, near Miranda. Besides com'
pleting the Miranda homes, the con'
tractors have also formed gardens and
planted flowers and shrubs on the
street verges as well as in the proper'
ties.
The houses were built on a basic
plan, but external variations in roof
shapes, window sizes, and the position
chimneys P rovl( le the appearance

Australia Gives
Technical Advice
Under the Colombo Plan.
It is of interest to note in the
Annual Report of the Division of
Building Research, C.5.1.R.0., that
under the auspices of the Colombo
Plan the Australian Government made
available to the Ceylon Government at
their request the services of the
Officer'in'Charge of Masonry Investi'
gations for four months. He studied
the clays, the local brick and tile in'
dustries and the use of traditional
building materials on the island and
recommended the action to be taken
to improve the local cottage indus'
tries, to set up modern factories for
the manufacture of bricks, roofing and
floor tiles and sewer and drainage
pipes. He recommended also the
establishment of ceramic and building
research laboratories as a necessary
prerequisite for the prosperity of the
Ceylon ceramic and building indus'
tries and suggested ways in which
Australia could help.
He paid a short visit to India also,
where he visited the Central Glass and
Ceramic Research Institute in Calcutta
and numerous brick and tile plants in
southern India.

Festival Hall Acoustics Perfect
ARCHITECT S. G. THORP RETURNS FROM OVERSEAS.
British Builders Stress Research.
Mr. S. G. Thorp, of the well'known
Sydney architectural firm of Peddle,
Thorp & Walker, returned to Aus'
tralia just before Christmas after a
seven months’ tour of Great Britain
and the Continent.
Although it was primarily a holiday
trip, after many years of intensive
work, and he was accompanied by
Mrs. Thorp, like most architects un'
der similar circumstances, there was a
big element of “busman’s holiday,”
and he inspected many new industrial
projects in Britain.
But his professional interests were
alloyed with the avidity of the tourist
seeing the beauty and history of the
Motherland for the first time and
65(X' miles of touring by car through
the United Kingdom and a month in
Lon ion “doing the shows” was a
joyo is and never'to-be'forgotten ex'
peri nee.
Rov~l Festival Hall—
Perfect Acoustics.
o*-e of the most lasting impressions
of h»6 trip was the Royal Festival
Hall, London, where he revelled in
the serene beauty of Beethoven’s Fifth
Symphony. “The acoustics of the
great hall are perfect,” he said, “and
it is not just a cold, hard scientific
perfection, but there is a warmth of
tone and a trueness of note that make
it one of the select few places in the
world where beautiful music can be
enjoyed to the full.” It also proves
that acoustics to'day has joined the
ranks of the exact sciences, for the
design was evolved by experts of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research after painstaking experiments
on the site, for not only did the in'
trinsic acoustics of the hall itself have
to be correct but a high level of extra'
neous noise emanating from the nearby
Hungerford Railway Bridge had to be
excluded and eliminated. He was not
impressed by the internal design and
treatment of the auditorium, feeling
that a lot of the finish looked flimsy
and like plywood, giving a cheap and
unconvincing effect, while the boxes
jutting out so starkly along both sides
of the auditorium looked like “open
drawers in a kitchen dresser.”
The various restaurants and dining'
rooms overlooking the Thames were
comfortable and satisfying in their
simple treatment.
Rome Railway Station.
Another building that impressed
him greatly was the new Rome Rail-
way Station, which in planning and
conception was outstanding. The fine
handling of the spacious interior of
the great concourse and booking hall,
the grace of the glass infilling to the
walls and the undulating ceiling treat'
ment were a tribute to the designers,
being logical and modern without any
recourse to structural acrobatics or
functionalistic cliches.
Other contemporary Italian work
was virile and interesting.
British Industrial Work.
As Mr. Thorp’s firm is responsible
for a considerable amount of industrial
work, it was only natural that he
should devote some of his time to
studying recent British industrial de'
velopment, and here again he was
struck by the many vast new under'
takings that have been built.
He was greatly impressed by the
breadth of vision of British think'
ing and planning in the field of
Industry and also by the great size,
scope and efficiency of many of the
major British building and construe'
tion companies who were equipped to
carry out projects no matter how ex'
tensive —a <£1,000,000 job was chicken
feed—anywhere in the world. The
emphasis on research that is a feature
of industry at the present time was
also an eye'opener, this factor also
being very evident in the big building
firms, nearly all of which had well'
equipped and staffed laboratories for
testing, developing and using new
techniques, methods and materials in
their work. “There is nothing static
about the Building Industry in
Britain,” he said.
He particularly noted the great
strides that are being made in the
development and use of pre'stressed
concrete in many forms, some of
which embraced terracotta blocks by
which means expensive and scarce tim-
ber formwork was eliminated. He
visited the new Austin car assembly
plant at Longridge, Birmingham,
which is said to be the most modern
of its type in the world including
America and was greatly impressed
not only by the plant and methods
but by the efficiency and keenness of
the management.
Another unforgettable impression
was the new Wedgewood Potteries

Recently completed at Longridge, near
Birmingham.

that have been rebuilt and are all-
electric. “It is hard to describe the
contrast between this immaculate
new plant with its own housing estate
set in green countryside with the
belching smoke and grime of the
traditional potteries at Stoke -on -
Trent,” he said.
No “Titters” in Britain.
“There is no ‘jitters’ in Britain,”
said Mr. Thorp. “There is a quiet
confidence—call it fatalism if you like,
for they know that if the atom bombs
start falling they will, as last time,
catch it first and often—but the atti-
tude, which with British reserve is not
expressed in words but demonstrated
by example, is expressed in the war-
time challenge of their great leader,
‘Let’s get on with the job’.”

Omission Of
Boundary Traps
New Water Board Ruling.
Advice has been received from the
Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and
Drainage Board, Sydney, that on 17th
September, 1952. the Board approved
the omission of boundary traps from
sewerage service installations gener-
ally, in—
(a) All newly-constructed sewerage
reticulation areas, irrespective
of whether draining to high
level or low level systems, to
treatment works, or ocean out-
falls.
(b) All minor sewer extensions
connecting with sewers already
approved for the omission of
boundary traps.
(c) Minor sewer extensions serving
ten or more properties in areas
where boundary traps are in
use.
Provided that—
(l) Where gas conditions in the
existing sewers are bad or
doubtful the use of boundary
traps be insisted upon unless
the new sewer can be isolated
from the existing sewer by a
suitable gas check.
(2) In well defined industrial areas,
or in the case of minor exten-
sions involving less than ten
properties in areas where
boundary traps are already in
use, boundary traps be requir-
ed on all sewerage service con-
nections.
Copper
Installations
Available
For Hot and Cold Water.
Difficulties of procurability and
high cost have been two factors that
have mitigated against many home
builders using copper pipes for the
cold water installations, in spite of
its appeal of lifetime service.
Noyes Bros. (Sydney) Ltd. advise
that as distributors of Kembla copper
tubing, tested light gauge copper cap-
illary tubing finished to close limits
for use with capillary fittings is now
being manufactured in Australia which
will enable copper installations to be
made at prices within the range of
all home builders.
Cost Savings.
The saving in cost is obtained in
two ways:—
(a) The usage of light gauge cop-
per tubing shows a saving of
50% by weight for cold water
installation and 25% for hot
water installation.
(b) Usage of capillary fittings
which eliminates screwing as
with heavy gauge copper tub-
ing, shows an important sav-
ing in installation time.
Light gauge copper tubing and cap-
illary fittings have been approved by
the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage
and Drainage Board of Sydney for
high pressure cold water installations
for usage both underground, above
the ground and within buildings.
A useful pamphlet setting out com-
parative cost savings at today’s prices
and describing the jointing technique
with capillary fittings may be obtain-

WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES CAN DO
WHY DO WE LAG BEHIND?
THE RIO SPORTS CENTRE.
The monumental project for a sports centre in the heart of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, enters the second stage of
construction with the completion of its enormous 150,000-person-capacity stadium, and the beginning of founda-
tion work for the second largest unit, an enclosed gymnasium which will hold 35,000 people. The stadium in
practice has fully justified the research and calculation that went into its development and it has been found that
every one of the 150,000 spectators has good visibility and the exit ramps are wide enough to allow the stadium
to empty in fifteen minutes. The roof around the upper periphery that provides shade is cantilevered 98 feet.
THE RIO SPORTS CENTRE GYMNASIUM.
Second unit in the Rio de Janeiro Sports Centre is the Gymnasium to accommodate 35,000 people, which is now
under construction. From the elevation and section illustration it will be seen that the light sectioned dome is
balanced on arched, ribs and encircled by horizontal passageways and ramps, which have a maximum slope of 10
per cent. A heavy monolithic affect was avoided by piercing the dome with utilitarian louvres for natural
ventilation and with glass inserts for daylighting.

THE 1952 AIR BEEF SEASON
4,000,000 lb. of Freight in Eighteen Weeks.
Air Beef’s fourth season of opera'
tions ended on September 8 last, when
the “Bristol” Freighter engaged on
the scheme returned to Melbourne
after flying 100,324 miles in 724
hours flying time and carrying nearly
4,000,000 lb. of freight in the eighteen
weeks’ season.
Despite the severe drought, the Air
Beef centre at Glenroy this year
slaughtered 1100 cattle more than last
year.
The total of over 3,900,000 lb. of
cargo handled by the single “Bristol”
aircraft operating from Glenroy in'
eluded 2,756,504 lb. of chilled export
beef, 202,577 lb. of hides, and 4117
lb. of pork. Backloads of supplies
and machinery for stations around
Glenroy amounted to 964,972 lb.
Two boring plants flown to one pro'
perty saved the lives of hundreds of
cattle faced with death because of lack
of water.
Mr. I. H. Grabowsky, Planning and
Development Manager of A.N.A. and
a director of Air Beef Pty. Ltd., said
that it was hoped to set up a second
killing station at Hall’s Creek, about
140 miles from Glenroy, in 1954.
I hope that eventually the whole
of the inland will be served this way,”
he said, “for this is the only way to
develop the northern Australian cattle
industry.
“The aeroplane is just another form
of transport, he said. “The outback
needs more aircraft first. Roads and
railways should follow.”

HUGE EXPANSION PROGRAMME UNDER WAY
£229,000,000 Construction Projects for Basic Industry;
£100,000,000 for Small, Medium Size Manufactures
The actual construction work on industrial expansion projects this
year will be the most intensive and far-reaching ever achieved in
Australia, National Development Minister Spooner announced last
week.
The value of known projects being
put into effect to expand manufactur-
ing capacity totalled £229,000,000, he
said.
This was for major projects in,
basic industry only. Probably a
further £100,000,000 was involved in
the development of small and med-
ium size manufactures.
Senator Spooner declared that
never before had Australia experienc-
ed anything like the current level of
oversea investment in the expansion
of the manufacturing industry.
Whereas from 1945 to 1951 invest-
ment in Australia by firms with sub-
stantial overseas links totalled about
£100,000,000, at least another
£130,000,000 of investment had been
added in the past 18 months.
Signs For Prosperous Year.
This extraordinary heavy support
was being given by businesses closely
linked with large enterprises in U.K.,
U.S.A., and elsewhere, the Minister
continued.
“Big industrial enterprises do not
spend money thoughtlessly, and it is
reasonable to assume that they are
pressing on vigorously with their plans
because they anticipated healthy com-
mercial conditions in the immediate
and forseeable future.
“The greatly increased output of
basic materials was undeniable evi-
dence of a much improved output per
manhour and of a better attitude gen-
erally between employers and em-
ployees.”
All the signs indicated a prosperous
year ahead.
Senator Spooner called for a de-
termined drive to reduce costs of pro-
duction, saying:
“If in conjunction with all this we
aim at saving some portion of our
earnings or profits and invest them,
we will be taking practical steps to
provide capital funds for the perm-
anent development of Australia.
Construction Programme.
Dealing with the construction pro-
gramme, which would take years to
complete, the Minister said it could
now proceed on a new high level be-
cause the shortage of basic materials
had been eliminated and there was no
shortage of labour.
The most spectacular expansion
would be in petroleum refining pro-
jects, which involved an investment
of £83,000,000, and would lift Aus-
tralia’s capacity tenfold in a few years.
Post-war development in the steel
industry, already costing £40,000,000,
had been only the beginning of mas-
sive projects which required several
more years to complete. These pro-
vided a basis for a 40% increase in
the output of steel products relative
to steel production.
Engineering Metal Trades Plans.
Engineering and metal trades plans
costing £40,000,000 already were well
under way for the production of cars,
trucks, tractors, earthmoving equip-
ment, wire, stationary engines, and
automotive spare parts, the Minister’s
statement continued.
The capacity of the chemicals in-
dustry had already been increased by
the expenditure of £10,000,000 since
1945, and a further £8,000,000 had
been announced for major pro-
grammes since June, 1951.
In the paper industry a £10,000,000
expansion programme already had be-
gun, while food processing and tex-
tiles developmental programmes in-
volving more than £5,000,000 in each
industry are proceeding.
Materials Available.
The fact that manufacturers are
taking advantage of the availability of
materials to go ahead with high level
development demonstrated the sound-
ness of the Australian economy.
It was important to encourage this
trend, because more factories meant
more employment, and a more self-re-
liant Australia, the statement proceed-
ed.
Construction Faster Now.
Because of the greatly increased
output of basic materials, the rate at
which factory construction could take
place was faster now than in any year
since the war.
Coal production was running at an
annual rate of nearly four million tons
greater than 18 months ago. (In
1950-51, it was 16,424,000 tons of
black coal.) Steel production also
was 25% higher. Production of
coke, bricks, cement, tiles, timber,
and many metal products had increas-
ed substantially.
Vast Works Programme.
Senator Spooner said that never
before in Australia’s history had in-
dustry committed itself forward to so
much investment on so many develop-
CRAZIER AND CRAZIER.
In many architectural styles of the past the staircase has been one of the most impressive fea-
tures of the interior, and many magnificent conceptions come to mind. In the hands of con-
temporary designers the process of elimination of even fundamental requirements such as a
handrail is apparent in their early efforts seen to be reaching a stage of absurdity and soon
there will be nothing left at all: first risers went, then strings, then newels and handrails
until in the right example all that remains is a tread supported on light steel rod sections,
variations on this theme being shown in the other two examples. The next step would appear
to be a Jacob’s ladder and after that, blissful oblivion.

mental projects, nor had the indus-
trial development programme ever in-
cluded so many vast projects. Among
these were:
• Shell Company’s new refinery,
expected to begin production this
year.
• Vacuum Oil was spending
£13,000,000 at Altona, Victoria.
• Caltex will build a £25,000,000
enterprise at Kurnell, near Sydney.
• Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. has begun
a £40,000,000 project near Perth.
• Further expenditure of £50,000,-
000 spread over many parts of Aus-
tralia by 8.H.P., Australian Iron and
Steel Ltd.. Lysaghts, and Rylands.
Positive, Tangible Proof.
Great Expansion was also planned
for the chemicals industry; nearly
£6,000,000 already had been spent in
converting sulphuric plants to use lo-
cal sulphides; and four million
pounds would be spent on new plant
to produce 55,000 tons of ammonia
sulphate annually.
All the facts enumerated above
gave positive and tangible proof that
the economic policies introduced by
the Government to deal with the
twin problems of inflation and under-
production were now starting to pay
off handsomely. Senator Spooner con-
cluded.
Melbourne’s Power
Station Taking
Shape
Melbourne’s highest smoke stack,
which will carry gases 370 feet above
central Melbourne from a 60,000
kW plant, is the most spectacular part

Death of Frederick
Trenchard Smith
Architect For Builders’ Exchange.
The death on January 28 last of
Frederick Trenchard Smith at the
great age of 86 removes a well-known
personality from the earlier years of
architectural practice in Sydney.
Born in 1867 he was educated at
Sydney Grammar School. He
entered his articles with Mansfield
Brothers, eminent architects of the
period—G. Allen Mansfield was the
first President of the Institute of Ar-
chitects of N.S.W. in 1871, and in due
time was appointed chief clerk-of-
works for the firm.
During the 1890 depression, the
bottom having fallen out of archi-
tectural practice, Mr. Trenchard
Smith was for a time, secretary of
the Builders’ Exchange, which had,
together with the Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W., been found-
ed in 1873. He also valued and as-
sessed fire damage incurred in the
disastrous Moore St. fire of 1892 for
the firm who represented the Insur-
ance companies.
Later, as things improved, he start-
ed in practice on his own account at
76 Pitt St, and built up an extensive
all-round practice, some of his earlier
work including the Manly Cottage
Hospital and The Builders’ Exchange
Building at 12 Castlereagh Street. It
is interesting—and devastating —to
note that when erected in 1907, this
building, which had a frontage of
forty feet and was of five storeys and
included lift and office fittings, cost
£9000! The Master Builder was
that outstanding character George
Parker Jones [who left his life story
in book form, to act as a guide to all
others treading along his track in the
building world. The book was en-
titled “The Road I Came” and ap-
peared in serial form in “Building
Magazine”].
In 1928 Mr. S. R. Maisey was
taken into partnership and under the
name of Trenchard Smith fe? Maisey
the practice continued until 1932
when, at the age of 65, he retired
from active participation and interest
in the practice.
He lived in Manly all his life and
as one of its leading citizens over a
long period was President of the
Manly Cottage Hospital and of the
School of Arts for many years.
His death occurred suddenly while
he was visiting his daughter in Mel-
bourne and although the cremation
was held there his ashes are to be in-
terred at his native Manly.
ANOTHER LARGE OFFICE BUILDING
FOR NEW YORK.
Another 28-storey office building to rise
shortly on the New York City skyline is this
air-conditioned structure that will replace a
dozen old brownstone buildings on Third
Avenue at 44th to 45th Streets. The build-
ing will have horizontal and vertical fins to
rule out the solar rays in summer and let
them in during winter. Resultant contrast in
appearance of the two facades is striking.

ALTERNATIVE ELEVATIONS.
These two houses shown as alternative ele-
vations for the same plan, contain everything
desired of a six-room bungalow. So wisely
have these homes been planned that they adapt
themselves to several types of lots. On a
corner the living porch will face one street
and the entrance the other. On a narrow
lot the porch is turned to the street and the
entrance approached over the terrace. Finally,
on a wide lot the entrance can be made to
face the street. Tones recommended are
roof from red to pink and slightly into green
and stucco light grey or white with trimmings

THE VALIANT DUTCH
HOLLAND’S NEVER-ENDING BATTLE WITH THE SEA,
The Recent Disaster.
British children of several genera'
tions know the story of the courageous
little Dutch boy who, seeing a small
leak in the dyke thrust his finger in
it to stem the flood that otherwise
would have developed. He symbol'
ises the motive courage and dogged
perseverance of the Netherlands in
their two thousand year old battle with
the sea.
The latest disaster is but another
blow that the hardy Hollanders have
to overcome, for be it foreign foe or
Old Man Sea they love their native
soil with a fervent passion—every
grain of it —and they will accept this
latest challenge and carry on as they
have for centuries.
The Sudden Tragedy.
Overnight, on the first of February
last, Holland was suddenly struck by
flood disaster on a scale that has not
been witnessed for centuries. It was
caused by the highest tides ever
known since water levels were first
regularly recorded. Greatest damage
has been suffered alongside the banks

of the big rivers and the sea arms of
the Province of South Holland, the
Province of Zealand and the west'
ern part of the Province of North
Brabant.
Roughly 10% of the Netherlands,
including the highest valued agricub
tural land, has been flooded and
overnight has been made unproduc'
tive for at least one to two years.
Tens of thousands of the population
have now become homeless and many
metal factories, brickworks and indus'
tries alongside the banks of the big
rivers and also the shoe factories in
North Brabant have suffered enornv
ous damage.
This flood disaster means a serious
blow to Dutch economy at the
very moment when complete recovery
from war damage was so near, and
when, for the first time since the end
of World War 11., the Netherlands
was in a position to do without dollar
aid.
“I Fight and Conquer.”
Dr. Drees, Netherlands Prime Min'
ister, speaking of the disaster, referred
to the motto of the Province of Zea'
land, “Luctor et emergo” (I fight
and conquer), which he said would
be brought into practice again;
already some of the 50 gaps in the
80 miles of dykes which protect Hob
land against the sea are being repair'
ed though it will take many months
before most of the gans in the dykes
are closed. In the meantime the un'
protected areas will remain open to
high tides and winter storms, which
will add unpredictable damage to the
destruction already caused.
It was gratifying to all real Aus'
tralians to learn that the Common'
wealth Government had immediately
made a gift of £50,000 to Holland
in her hour of need.
A similar gift was also given to our
suffering kinsfolk on the East Coast
of England who are enduring similar
hardships and loss to the Dutch across
the North Sea.

ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION IN AUSTRALIA
GOOD PROGRESS AT BELL BAY, TASMANIA.
The year 1952 saw good progress
in the establishment of the Aluminium
Ingot Production plant at Bell Bay,
Tasmania, despite extremely wet
weather and frustrating delays in the
supplies of plant and materials.
Importance of Aluminium
in Modem Industry.
Aluminium is now second only to
steel in its importance to modern in'
dustry, and to keep pace with over'
seas industrial developments it is essen'
tial that Australia should have a local
source of supply of this widely'used
light metal. By agreement between
the Commonwealth and Tasmanian
State Governments, which together
formed the Australian Aluminium Pro'
Auction Commission, this object will
be achieved in 1954.
The aluminium works now taking
advanced shape at Bell Bay, Tasmania,
near the mouth of the Tamar Estuary,
is the only one in the Southern Hemis'
phere and one of the very few in the
British Commonwealth combining the
production of alumina and aluminium
metal in the one centre. The standard
Bayer'Hall process will be used.
The designed output of the plant
is 13,000 tons of ingot per year,
which, though small in comparison
with the production of the major
plants in U.S.A. and Canada, is higher
than the present Australian demand.
As the demand rises, local production
will also be increased.
All aluminium ingot now used in
Australia is imported, almost entirely
from dollar sources. The output of
the Tasmanian plant will therefore
eliminate expenditure of some millions
of dollars annually as well as assuring
a local supply of metal for Defence
equipment and civilian manufactures.
The Bell Bay plant is an integrated
alumina production and metal' reduc'
tion works. Cargoes of bauxite will
be brought to the Commission’s wharf,
on which bulk'handling facilities are
being provided, and it is the Commis'
sion’s intention to commence opera'
tions using overseas bauxite of known
characteristics to enable production to
commence with a minimum of operat'
ing difficulties. The plant is, how'
ever, flexible enough to treat a wide
range of overseas and Australian
bauxite, and, when the plant is run'
ning smoothly, increasing quantities
of Australian ore will be blended urn
til the plant is proved capable of
operating exclusively on domestic
material, so satisfying the Defence
requirements of self ' containment.
Thereafter the Commission will use
whatever bauxite proves to be the
most economic.
Australian Bauxite
Deposits.
The deposits of Tasmanian bauxite
held by the Commission will be re'
garded mainly as emergency reserves,
to be exploited at times when the
importation of ore from overseas or
mainland sources becomes difficult.
The Commission controls in N.S.W.
approximately 7,000,000 tons of
bauxite of economic grade, but a more
important source of ore may prove to
be the Wessel Islands Group off the
Northern Territory coastline. An ex'
tensive survey is to be made of this
area in order to evaluate recently'
discovered deposits, from which sam'
pies have been analysed to show a
higher percentage of alumina than has
hitherto been found in Australia ex'
cept in small and isolated instances.
Plant Covers Forty Acres.
The works are impressive in mag'
nitude as they rise from deep water
frontage on Bell Bay and extend over
forty acres of land cleared from the
bush. The driving of 80ft. concrete
piles for a concrete wharf 500 ft. long
has reached past the halTway
and completion of the decking is keep'
ing pace. The wharf will carry two
300 tons per hour portal type jib
cranes for speedy unloading of bulk
shipments of bauxite and other raw
materials.
The construction camp on the rise
above the river, now housing over 600
men, will disappear in the course of
time. Meanwhile, it is welhequipped
with full canteen and kitchen facilities,
laundry, hot water, electric light and
THE BELL BAY PLANT TAKES SHAPE.
After many difficulties culminating in a record wet winter the new plant of the Aluminium Production Commission at Bell Bay, Tasmania,
is begining to take shape as is apparent from this panoramic view taken op October 31, .1952. The other detail progress photo of various
sections of the plant were taken at the same time.

general amenities, including a licensed
working-men’s club. Power both for
the camp and construction purposes
is generated by diesel units, and an
adequate water supply is maintained
from three dams constructed by the
Commission on its property.
Permanent Workshops.
Beyond the camp the main build-
ings of the works are prominent. The
permanent mechanical and electrical
workshops were erected early and are
being used actively during the con-
struction programme. Carpenters’ and
joiners’ shops, plumbing and black-
smithing sections are working busily.
In other workshops fabrication of
steelwork for buildings and for the
many steel vessels required in the
chemical section of the plant is going
on.
Elsewhere on the site prefabricated
steel-framed structures to house the
extensive alumina plant, the steam
boiler house, carbon paste factory and
filter house are partly-erected, and
covering in is proceeding. As is ap-
propriate for an aluminium plant, ex-
tensive use is being made of aluminium
roofing, sheeting, guttering, down-
piping, etc.
The very substantial structures
which will house the rectifier section
and the reduction furnaces are in
reinforced concrete, the concrete being
produced in a batching plant which
onerates continuously, using sand and
gravel from the site.
The Rectifier Building.
The tall rectifier building will con-
tain the largest rectifier installation in
Australia; in it the A.C. power trans*
mitted from the Hydro-Electric Com*
mission Trevallyn Development, over
be rectified for use as D.C. current in
the reduction furnaces.
The large sub-station and switch-
yard contains among a host of electri-
cals two 40 M.V.A. English Electric
transformers, each weighing 68 tons—
themselves a major transport hand-
ling problem. These will step down
the 110 K.V. high-tension current as
received in the sub-station to voltages
suitable for use in the works. The
plant will consume in all 42,500 h.p.
per year.
The Reduction Building.
The reduction building itself is an
impressive structure in three bays,
each 600 ft. long, each bay containing
fifty furnaces. The design of the
foundations necessary to support the
furnace structures was a major prob-
lem, as difficulties of heat transfer be-
low the furnaces, and shrinkage of
clay, had to be overcome. The solid
concrete piers for the. furnaces were
finally carried to rock, some to a depth
of twenty feet.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING

The extent of the installations is
evident from such features as the bulk
alumina silos, the heavy concrete
foundations of the huge thickener
tanks, and the mass of steel founda-
tions required to support the series of
decomposer tanks, over 20ft. in
diameter and 60ft. in height. The
rotating kilns for calcining of alumina,
250 ft. in length, are also a massive
piece of equipment.
Supply of Electric Power.
The operation of the aluminium plant
requires completion by the Tasmanian
State Government of schemes for
the provision of electric power and
water supplies. The hydro-electric
development at Trevallyn. approxi-
mately thirty-five miles from Bell Bay,
is in progress, the station being plan-
ned to provide the Commission initial-
ly with 35,000 h.p. per annum. While
this development and also the North
Esk Regional Supply Scheme have
been delayed by factors outifide the
State Government’s control, assurances
have been given that the services will
be available by the time the aluminium
works are ready.
In view of the extreme difficulty
which the fabricating mills of Aus-
tralia are experiencing in obtaining
adequate supplies of ingot, the assur-
ance of light metal supplies from a
local plant is looked forward to with
keen interest by the trade, it being
evident that aluminium consumption
in Australia is capable of very large
development once the handicaps of
supply shortages and dollar restric-
tions are removed.
Government Finance.
This project is financed by a Gov-
ernment fund of £7,250,000, and the
need for expenditure on this scale is
evident from the volume of the work
now proceeding. When completed,
the aluminium works will embody the
best of modern British, Continental
and American techniques, and will
prove a valuable addition to Australia’s
technical development.
How Aluminium Is Made.
The technique used in making
aluminium to-day is. in many ways,
similar to that employed when the
industry was launched in Canada half
a century ago. Though methods have
been improved, the process still begins
with the separation of alumina from
the bauxite. The reddish-brown ore
is washed and then treated in a soda
solution to yield a chalky-white powder
containing a high concentration of
aluminium. This material, alumina,
is fed into a reduction furnace, or
“pot,” where it dissolves in a bath of
molten cryolite to which aluminium
fluoride has been added. The reduc-
tion furnace (about 10ft. wide by 16ft.

long, and usually made of steel) is
lined with a paste of coke which is
baked until hard. Electricity enters
the furnace by travelling through the
transmission lines and busbar to
another carbon block which is sus'
nended in the molten cryolite. As the
electricity flows from the carbon block
through the cryolite to the carbon on
the outside of the furnace it provides
the necessary action to separate the
alumina into aluminium and oxygen,
and the molten hot metal sinks to the
bottom of the pot. The metal is then
drained out of the pot and poured
into solid, rectangular ingots, normal'
ly about 50 pounds each in weight.
TACKLING THE PARKING PROBLEM
BUILDING OVER ELECTRIC TRAIN TRACKS.
The weeks, months, and years flit
by, thousands and thousands more
cars go on the road and still nothing
whatsoever of a practical nature
emerges from the babel of talk to ease
the parking problem. The only offT
cial action is more and more restrictive
measures to push the motor vehicle
further and further from the city
where its legitimate business lies.
Many architects, engineers and
builders have thought about this
problem and a number of schemes
have been put forward, one of the
latest coming from a firm of young
architects at Goulburn, Messrs. Brown
& Brewer.
They suggest that a station to ac'
commodate 650 cars could be built
over the electric train lines on an area
bounded by Elizabeth, Campbell, Cas'
tlereagh and Goulburn Streets.
The scheme is not new and was em
he planned the City Railway; it was
reported on by an engineer of the
City Council in 1946, while even earl'
ier a firm of city architects prepared
sketches for a car park in this area.
The proposers of the present
scheme state that foundations have in
fact, been built to take a multistorey
building and the parking station could
be constructed on these foundations.
Advantages Over Belmore Park.
Advantages claimed over the pro-
posed Belmore Park scheme are as
follows:
(1) No interference with public
parks (Belmore Park would be out of
commission for at least two years).
(2) Cost—cheaper to build up in
the air than into the ground.
(3) Maintenance—no mechanical
ventilation required, electric light only
after dark, no risk of flooding and
(4) Site closer to the heart of the
city.
(5) Discharging cars into Goulburn
Street which has less traffic than the
surrounding streets of Belmore Park,
(6) Hiding the unsightly railway
tracks and overhead gear with a new
building.

PORT KEMBLA PLANT OPENED BY PREMIER.
The new plant of British-Australian
Power Cables Pty. Ltd. at Port Kern-
bla, N.S.W., was officially opened by
the Premier of N.S.W.. the Hon. J.
J. Cahill, M.L.A on November 21st
1952
Mr Cahill in his speech said that
the establishment of the new plant
marked a new departure for Australian
cable manufacture and completed the
range of cable making
“Its establishment will place Aus-
tralia within sight of self-sufficiency
as far as the electrical cable-making
industry is concerned”
Remarkable Progress of
Wollongong-Port Kembla District
The Premier stressed that money
must be provided for the full develop-
ment of Australia for what did it mat-
ter whether they were in debt or
credit if someone came in and took
the country
Mr Cahill spoke of the amazing de-
velopment of this area, which, he said,
was already a keen rival of Newcastle
as the second city of the State.
Progress here has been truly re-
markable and the present population
of 80,000 is expected to reach
250.000 by 1990,
“This figure will be obtained if the
present rate of progress is maintained,
for its population is increasing at the
rate of 7-8 per cent, compared with
less than 3 per cent, over the rest of
the State,” he said.
A New Industry.
The Chairman of Directors in his
remarks said that “this is not only a
new factory, but it represents the
commencement of a new industry in
Australia. This company, British-
Australian Power Cables Pty. Limited,
is the first company to undertake the
manufacture of lead-sheathed power
cables in Australia. It is equipped to
produce paper-insulated cable for the
transmission of electric power up to
22.000 vol‘s initially, but later the
range of cables can and will be ex-
tended to include higher voltages.

The establishment of the company
and the erection and equipping of the
factory are the result of a long, happy
and successful association between
two outstanding organisations, one
Australian and one British. The
Australian company is Metal Manu-
factures Limited, whose main works
are adjacent. The British company,
represented here by Mr. F. G.
Edwards, is British Insulated Callen-
der’s Cables Limited, the largest cable'
manufacturing organisation in Britain
—and, I believe, in the world—with
experience in cable manufacture ex'
tending back over some eighty years.
The capital investment in British'
Australian Power Cables Pty. Ltd. is
£1,000,000. The majority sharehold'
ing in the company is represented by
Australian capital. Associated with
British Insulated Callender’s Cables
Limited in their shareholding in the
company are several other renowned
British cable manufacturers: Pirelli'
General, Siemens, Johnson Phillips,
Connollys and W. T. Glover & Com-
pany. So there is behind this new
Australian enterprise a wealth of ex'
perience and technique which will en*
sure that the quality of the products
manufactured in Australia is fully
equivalent to that of the products of
the British companies I have men-
tioned. In other words, British'

a joint British-Australian enterprise,
combining the best in both countries.
Tribute to Metal
Manufactures.
“How did this enterprise come into
being? The policy of Metal Manu-
factures Limited over the years has
been a very interesting one and is a
credit to some very wise men, one of
whom I am impelled to mention by
name. Sir Alex. Stewart, Chairman of
Metal Manufactures and one of Aus-
tralia’s leading industrialists. To know
Sir Alex. Stewart is to admire him.
To work for him is a privilege and a
pleasure. He it was who selected the
site of Metal Manufactures at Port
Kembla, and what exists there to-day
is only one of many monuments to
his far-seeing vision. The policy of
Metal Manufactures has always been,
and still is, to study the new indus-
trial needs of Australia in the non-
ferrous metal fabricating field, and
where a need exists to set out to
satisfy that need if no one else will.
In this respect Metal Manufactures
continues to exemplify the true Aus-
tralian pioneering spirit, and in so
doing to develop new industries neces-
sary for the security of the Nation
and to make Australia industrially
strong. Metal Manufactures, at the
request of the Government of the day,
was first to fabricate copper and cop-
per alloy wire here; first to manufac-
ture copper and copper alloy tubing;
first, in association with British com-
panies, to produce paper - insulated
lead-covered telephone cable; first, in
association with British companies, to
produce rubber-covered cables and
wires ;and now, again in association
with British companies, first to estab-
lish the manufacture of lead-sheathed
power cables. That is evidence ’of the
policy of Metal Manufactures; and in
this new company there is a further
example of the practical application
of that policy.
“I would like to express our thanks
to the contractors and sub-contractors
who erected the factory and manufac-
tured and installed the plant. Most
of the plant and equipment in the
factory is highly specialised and came
from England. Those items that could
be manufactured in Australia were
manufactured here; and a good job
was done by all. I take the oppor-
tunity of expressing our deep thanks
to all concerned, with a particular
word of praise for Mr, Robertson,
Chief Engineer, Metal Manufactures
Limited, and his hard-working team.”
The new building was constructed
by Eldweld’s Ltd. and all steel fab-
rication was carried out by Thirlwell
& McKenzie Ltd.
Messrs. W. Davies, M.H.R., R.
Connor, M.L.A., the Mayor of Wol-
longong, Aid. J. J. Kelly, Mr. M.
Ketteridge. manager of the new fac-
tory, and Mr. K. J. Kirkpatrick,
manager of the M.M. Ltd., were
present.
Cable produced by British-Australian
Power Cables will be of the type used
for taking power from the under-
ground power stations on the Snowy
and Kiewa schemes.
A senior executive of the firm
pointed out that their product was
unique in that all the materials used
in its manufacture came from the
earth and immediately it was convert-
ed was re-buried.
“The greatest difficulty we have is
that our product lasts too long.
“Cables which were laid under the
Sydnev Flarbour in the 1890’s are still
in use,” he said.
Main uses for the cable will be:
• Underground city and suburban
distribution;
• Generating and power station
outlets;
• River and harbour crossings, and
• For high-tension supply to aero-
dromes and other areas where
poles are a hazard.
The product of British-Australian
Power Cables Pty. Ltd. is paper-
insulated cables.
Paper-insulated Cables.
This comes from the extensive use
of paper as a di-electric or, in effect,
insulator in the cables.
The cables are built up from cores
or copper wire, bunched to form from
7 to 127 strand conductors lapped
with paper tapes to the required thick-
ness, which is determined by the vol-
tage of the cable.
The cores are then laid up or
grouped in the patterns or sequences
required and bound together.
Following this binding, the cables
are put under vacuum and dried and
then impregnated with the cable com-
pound, a type of oil.
At this stage of manufacture the
lead press extrudes a solid lead sheath
around the core. This gives an her-
metically, almost everlasting seal. '
Final application is a layer of steel
wire or tape around the lead sheath to
form an armour which, in turn, is pro-
tected against corrosion with jute or
hessian tapes.
When it reaches the engineer on
the job the cable is wound on drums
and whitewashed to prevent adhesion
during removal.
500 Miles a Year,
Production of the plant will cover
a range of many hundreds of sizes and
types of cables essential to extension
of electricity supply lines in Australia.
Each year the total production will
be nearly 500 miles of cable.
With the exception of some copper,
virtually all materials used in the
manufacturing will be Australian.
The factory will employ 200, with a
nucleus of British technicians.

3ft. Sin. in level, forcing water
through the last remaining gap—the
reluctant sea’s last unsuccessful effort
to maintain its hold over the affairs
of central Holland.
The completion of this mighty land'
link through the wild sea'waves her'
aided the commencement of one of
the world’s most ambitious reclama'
tion projects—the “impoldering” of a
broad area of the bed of the Zuyder
Zee, now tamed, and confined to a
peaceful landlocked lake—the Yssel
Lake.
Here are a few facts and figures
about the Zuyder Zee Dyke:
Total length: 20 miles.
Breadth: at road level, 190 ft.,
and at water level, 285 ft.
Height: 44 ft.
Total volume: min. cu. yds.
Construction materials used: 30 min
cu. yds. of clay, 17£ min cu. yds. of
sand, min cargo-tons of stone,
11,300 cu. yds. of concrete blocks,
23 min bundles of brushwood, 2.8
tons of straw. The average labour
force employed in the construction
work totalled 3,100.
Construction period: January, 1927
till May 28, 1932.
Total cost: 200 million guilders
(£A23,530,000).
Maximum difference between and and
low water at the dyke: About sft.
7in.
BLOCKED ROTTERDAM
HARBOUR OPENED AGAIN.
On 11th November divers located
the wreck of the 6000'ton Panamanian
steamer “Faustus,” which was sunk in
a severe gale on Friday, 7th Novem-
her, 1952, in front of the New Water-
way, and was swept over the Noor-
derpier (Northern Jetty) near the
Hook van Holland, thus blocking the
entrance to Rotterdam Harbour.
Port authorities now allow ships up
to a certain maximum draught to go
in and out again.
Efforts are being made to explode
the wreck of the “Faustus” with chain
layers of dynamite, but the great dif-
ference between high and low tide
leaves only l£ hours each day to work.
Even these l£ hours can be used only
under favourable weather conditions.
It is expected that removal of the
“Faustus” and repairs to the Noor-
derpier will cost millions of guilders,
involving intricate international legal
proceedings. The entrance to Rotter-
dam Harbour being blocked caused
the “New Amsterdam,” 36,000 - ton
crack liner of the Holland-America
Line, for the first time in its career
to be diverted to IJmuiden, the sea-
port of Amsterdam, to disembark its
passengers and discharge its cargo.
Significance of Rotterdam—
Main Port of European
Continent.
During the first half of 1952,
7413 ocean-going vessels, totalling
12,585,692 nett registered tons, ar-
rived in Rotterdam against 6441 ves-
sels, totalling 10,580,386 nett register-
ed tons, in the same period of 1951.
During the first six months of 1938
7328 vessals, totalling 11,853,378 nett
registered tons, arrived in Rotterdam.
These figures show that shipping in
Rotterdam has outstripped the pre-
war traffic.
Capacity: 103 quay side berths, 120
berths on dolphins and buoys.
Cargo: Discharging and loading rate
(in tons of 1000 kilos.) —Grain, 600-
1000 tons/hour; ore, 600-1200 tons/
hour; coal, 600-800 tons/hour; general
merchandise, 250-400 tons/hour.
Tugs: 125 tugs of 75-450 i.h.p.;
12 salvage vessels up to 4200 i.h.p..
with an operating radius of 15-20,000
miles.
Marine Repair Facilities: Dry docks:
Six floating docks, lifting power up to
6.000 tons; two floating docks, lifting
power up to 8,000 tons; one floating

BRITISH ARCHITECTS PLAN
LUXURY HAREM
To Cost £400,000.
An eighty-eight-room harem and a
thirty-room palace, planned by British
architects, is to be built by a British
firm for the Emir Abdullah, brother
of King Ibn Saud, of Saudi Arabia.
Foreman and specialist workers will
travel to Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia, to take charge of the work,
which will cost £400,000 and take two
years.
All materials steel, cement, and
rich furnishings for the palace and
the harem will be exported from Great
Britain.
In the palace, forbidden to all
women, the Emir will have a private
suite, a large resting room, and an
ornate reception chamber, 60ft. by
30ft.
Shaded garden paths will lead
through the grounds to the separately
walled-in harem, which will have forty
bedrooms, arranged in eight suites.
Modern reinforced concrete will be
used in the buildings, which will cover
75,000 square feet on two floors. For
centuries only mud brick or local
stone has been used.
The contract to build the palace and
harem was obtained by the London
firm of Braithwaite and Co., Engineers
Ltd. Work the firm is doing for the
King of Saudi Arabia, his family and
the Saudi Arabian Government totals
about £3,000,000.
With Thomas Ward Ltd., of Shef-
field, the firm is also building a new
£2,000,000 road, and petrol and fuel
installations in Mecca.
Glacial rock, 550,000,000 to
600,000,000 years old, have been dis-
covered in the Macdonnel Ranges,

Portland Cement Research
NEW BRITISH LABORATORIES OPENED.
To meet the ever-increasing pro-
gramme of research work, Associated
Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd.
have built new laboratories at Stone,
Greenhithe, Kent, England.
In designing the laboratories, the
architects, Westwood, Sons and
Harrison, were required to provide a
building accommodating chemical and
physical testing laboratories and an-
cillary facilities, an administrative block
and a staff caneten, together with a
subsidiary building for machinery and
storage.
Siting and Layout.
The accommodation required falls
naturally into three main groups: (1)
Administrative Offices, which are
placed in a block running east and
west at right-angles to the approach
drive; (2) Chemical Laboratories,
form a single-storey wing projecting
southward from the east end of the
Administrative Block and obtaining its
main daylight from the east, and (3)
Physical Testing Laboratories forming
a similar single-storey wing to the
west.
Structure and Materials.
Suspended floors and roofs through-
out are of reinforced concrete. Exter-
nal walls generally are of cavity con-
struction, the outer skin being 4|;in.
hollow clinker concrete blocks and the
inner skin is 4jin. hollow foamed slag
concrete blocks. Basement walls are
solid, consisting of of reinforced
concrete with 4£in. hollow foamed
slag concrete blocks forming a per-
manent shuttering on the inner face,
the concrete being bush hammered to
expose the aggregate where above
ground level.
The walls above ground floor level
are finished externally with oyster pink
“Cullainix” Tyrolean texture except
on the Library, over the main en-
trance, where cast Portland Stone
facing slabs have been applied. A bas
relief symbolising chemical research
forms a decorative motif on the north
wall of the Library.
Cast Portland Stone was also used
for window surrounds, sills, jambs and
heads, the latter being cast in situ as
an integral part of the beam casings.
Concrete bricks were used to give re-
lief in places between windows. The
cornices and door hoods are of rein-
forced concrete with a surface direct
from wrought shuttering.
Floors are finished with thermo-
plastic resin-bonded tiles in offices,
canteen and in laboratories not sub-
ject to heavy wear or damage by
chemicals. Granolithic paving has
been used in the main Physical Test-
ing Laboratory and other heavy duty
rooms and in all lavatories and cloak-
rooms.
Throughout the Chemical Labora-
tory wing hardwood (Missanda) blocks
have been selected for chemical re-
sistant qualities. In the Library, cork
tiles are used for quietness. In the
canteen kitchen the flooring is a
special grease-resistant coloured con-
crete tile.
Window frames generally are in
aluminium alloy
Heating and Ventilation.
In the Physical Testing Division
three rooms, the Hot Room, Humid
Room and Curing Room, have thermo-
statically controlled electrical heaters
in order to secure the constant tem-
perature required. The Humid Room
has, in addition, a refrigerating plant,
which is automatically brought into
play when the temperature rises, and
a misting system to secure the neces-
sary humidity.
Services.
A special problem was presented by
the large number of services required
in the building. As far as possible
these have been concealed, but at the
same time kept easily accessible, by
the provision of ducts with removable
covers, or by running them behind
benches with removable back panels.
In the Physical Testing Laboratories
services have largely been run on the
surface in order to have flexibility as
regards type and position of apparatus.
Research Work.
Although each of the twenty-six
works within the Portland Cement
Group has its own laboratory in which
day and night control tests are carried
out at every stage of manufacture,
there have, in addition, for many
vears been separate laboratories where
new types of cement or cement-based
products have been created and de-
veloped, and where the processes of
manufacture have been studied and
improved.
A feature of the activities of the
Research Department is the provision
of special facilities for the training of
personnel in cement technology. This
aspect of the Department’s work is
considered of primary importance as
it ensures the practical application of
new methods in providing the
specialised training for those engaged
in cement production.
The Research Department is pro-
vided with the most modern equip-
ment for investigating problems aris-
ing in the cement industry, and its
work is carried out by a number of
divisions that act in close collabora-
tion.

Monier Reduces
Brick, Tile Prices
The Monier Brick Co. Ptv. Ltd.
announces reductions in the prices of
their bricks and tiles “not as a tem'
porarv measure, but as a long-term
price policy.”
The company states that “the only
wav impetus can be regained in the
building industry is by bringing to-
day’s inflated prices down to a level
to suit the buying power of the pub-
lic.”
The price reductions have been
made possible by the easing of labour
problems, and the increase of output
per man per day.
New machinery installed a year ago
has exceeded the stated output of the
English manufacturers by over a
million bricks a year.
The new prices, now operative,
are: Blue Commons, £9/10/0 per
1000 at works; Grey Commons,
£lO/5/0; Brown Commons, £11;
Coloured Face, £l5/10/0.
Monier English Pattern Tiles,
£4/5/0 per square at works. Fixing

In Sydney
Proposed
£200,000 Olympic
Pool
Project Planned for Victoria Park.
Proposals for a £200,000 Olympic
freshwater swimming pool for Vic'
toria Park, near Sydney University,
have been outlined by the Lord
Mayor, Alderman P. D. Hills.
Council officers have been working
on plans which were inspected last
Friday at a meeting of the health and
recreations committee.
The plans include:
• The Olympic Pool, 165 feet by
55 feet.
• Wading Pool for children.
• Dressing pavilions with “sun
openings’’ in their roofs.
• Water purification plant which
will treat 80,000 gallons of water an
hour.
The pool is to be situated in the
angle of Victoria Park between City
Road and Parramatta Road, where
there is a natural sump at present, so
to that extent it will not be taking
away from the parkland area.
It will be handy for people living
in Camperdown, Glebe, Newtown,
Surry Hills, and Redfern.
The proposed pool will accommo'
date about 1000 spectators. There
will be no special diving portion, as
divers take up too much room.
Both the Olympic pool and the
children’s pool will be tiled, and the
Olympic pool will have eight racing
lanes and underwater lighting.
Plans provide for a concourse
around the pool for sunbathing, and
beach umbrellas will furnish a con'
tinental atmosphere.
The swimming area will have a
wire'mesh fence around it so that
people using Victoria Park will be
able to watch the bathers.
Plans include a cafe and an ambu'
lance station between the men’s and
women’s dressing pavilions, and the
buildings are designed to cause the
least possible obstruction in the park.
The planners are attempting to in'
corporate the buildings in a hillside.
According to a City Council officer,
the water purification plant would
provide the pool with water “equal
to or better than drinking water.’’
The Lord Mayor said the pool was
one project he wanted to get well urn
der way during his term of office as
it was very badly needed.
At its meeting on Monday the City
Council Health and Recreations Com'
mittee decided to call tenders for the
construction of the Olympic Pool.
The City Building Surveyor, Mr.
I. Rankin, submitted plans and sped'
fications of the proposed Pool to the
committee.
He advised that these had been
amended since they were first prepay
ed to bring cost estimates up to date.
And in Melbourne
Olympic Pool Will
Be “World’s
Finest”
£350,000 Project For Melbourne.
With the approval last week of plans
for Melbourne’s Olympic Pool, the
way is now open for that city to have
the best Olympic Games swimming
pool in the world.
The pool, which will be built in
Fawkner Park, will cost about
£350,000.
It will comprise a design that
should arouse world'wide interest, and
it will rival that at Madison Square
Gardens, New York, according to ex'
perts.
The architects are Messrs. Borland,
Murphy and Mclntyre, who submit'
ted the winning design.
Working plans are expected to be
ready in about four months, and tend'
ers will then be called as quickly as
possible.
The pool will be sunken beneath
the floor, so that the building can be
used for other purposes. It will have
a permanent seating capacity of at
least 6000.
Additional Sports Areas.
Outside the main area, but within
the stadium, there will be an area of
13,200 sq. ft., which can be used for
basketball courts, gymnasiums, danc'
ing, etc.
This building will be the first struc'
ture of any magnitude erected in many
years in Melbourne for amateur sport,
and it will be, it is claimed, an archi'
tectural monument to the city.
There is now a monthly average of
61,291,000 Americans in jobs, total'
ling 97.3% of the worker in a pop'
ulation of 158.400.000.

CHILDREN’S PLAY HOUSES
GIFT BY TIMBER DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION.
On the 23rd December last, the
Timber Development Association of
Australia (N.S.W. Branch) handed
over a Children’s Play House to the
Royal Alexandra Hospital Convales-
cent Home for Crippled Children at
Collaroy. The ceremony was perform-
ed by the President of the Association,
Mr. N. K. Wallis, who presented the
key to a little girl patient. The
handing of the key to her signified
that the play house, named “Pixie
Cottage,” was to be the property of
the children. When the door was
opened, the fairy spirit of the cottage
(Pamela Tronier) was released to
dance a Pixie Ballet on the lawn in
front of it.
Present at the ceremony were Ma-
tron E. Yeuman, who is in charge of
the Home; Dr. Lindsay Dey, Presi-
dent, Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children; Dr. Fulton, Medical Sup-
erintendent, Royal Alexandra Hospi-
tal for Children; Mr. G. S. Warburt-
on. President, Collaroy Hospital Aux-
iliary; Mr. K. F. Coles, President,
Crippled Children’s Association; Mr.
C. D. Chapman, Public Relations Of-
ficer, Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children, and Mrs. C. D. Chapman,
Mr. and Mrs. f. W. Forsyth. Apart
from the President, representatives of
the Timber Development Association
included its Director, Mr. C. Lembke,
accompanied by Mrs. C. Lembke; Mr.
and Mrs. A. Houghton: Mr. W.
Mitchell (Whitakers Ltd.): Mr. H.
Hayman; Mr. and Mrs. G. A. Dun-
can; Mr. W. L. Wearne; Mr. and
Mrs. P. Tronier; Mr. and Mrs. C.
C. Chamberlain, and Mr. C. Lembke,
Inr.
The architect of the play house is
Mr. A. N. Baldwinson, and the build-
er, Mr. C. C. Chamberlain. It has an
overall size of 12’ x 8’ with a ceiling
height of 4’ 6”. In its construction
Canadian red cedar shingles for the
roof, weatherboards of Island Walnut
from the Solomon Islands, frame of
N.S.W. hardwoods, gable ends in
Parana pine, window shutters in Aus-
tralian 5-ply pine, doors in 5-ply fac-
ed with ramin from Sarawak, mould-
ings in kauri from New Hebrides,
floor in Baltic timber from Sweden,
window boxes in taun from New
Guinea, and furniture in Pacific
maple from Borneo.
Weatherboards, shingles, etc., are
moulded in miniature, with weather
are a great variety of timbers repre-
senting practically every source of
Australian timber supply, such as
boards finished with clear dulux, and
the doors, shutters and exterior fit-
tings in primrose colour. Floor boards
are painted a deep grey. The furni-
ture consists of miniature tables and
chairs lacquered in various pastel
colours.
The shutters are ornamented with
Donald Duck characters, and the in-
terior lining, finished in blue-grey,
has a surrounding frieze depicting
scenes from fairy tales. The curtains
are likewise patterned with nursery
characters. There is a dummy chim-
ney and perched on the roof are two
quaint birds, whilst a black cat with
a huge red bow sits jauntily on one
of the window sills.
The play house, or cottagette, is
surrounded by a miniature fence fitted
with a little gate. The fence is so
designed as to be movable and ad-
justable to any slope.
The materials for the construction
of the play house and fence were
donated by members of the timber
industry, and the cost of construction
is borne by the T.D.A.
Two further play houses, one to
lohn Williams’ Memorial Polio Hos-
pital at Wahroonga, and the other to
the main Children’s Hospital at Cam-
perdown, will be handed over in the
near future.
The Timber Development Associa-
tion of N.S.W. muse be congratulated
on the happy thought in providing
this pleasure for the children.
LIGHT-WEIGHT AGGREGATES
FOR CONCRETE.
Experiments by C.S.I.R.O. Building
Research Division.
The C.S.I.R.O. Division of Build-
ing Research announces the develop-
ment of bloated or -expanded aggre-
gates for light-weight concrete from
local clays.
Light-weight concrete made with
expanded clay reduces the weight of
structures and increases the ease of
handling precast units such as blocks
and slabs. It also improves the ther-
mal insulating value of the concrete.
Overseas there is a wide choice of
natural and manufactured light-weight
aggregates for concrete, the most com-
mon being pumice, expanded clay and
shale, perlite, and foamed slag. In
Australia, sufficient suitable light-
weight aggregates are not available,
but C.S.I.R.O. investigations have
shown that there are large deposits of
clays and shales in the Melbourne and
Sydney metropolitan areas which can
be expanded to make satisfactory light-
weight aggregate.
Expanded clay aggregate is made by
heating pellets of suitable clay to a
high temperature. The gases evolved
cause the material to swell and become
light and cellular . The clay is heated
in a rotary kiln or on a sinter grate.

Many British Landlords “Flit”
TOO MANY ACTS AND HARSH REGULATIONS
With Australia Following in England’s Wake.
A great deal of concern has re'
cently been expressed in Britain over
the strange disappearance of many
landlords, who “flit” and leave the ten'
ants in possession of houses, rentfree.
In Salford, Lancashire (population
180,000), 600 landlords have vanish'
ed. This strange state of affairs is ad'
tersely affecting property ownership
ind tenancy throughout the U.K.
Many Acts.
In Britain in the reign of Queen
/ictoria, landlords drew rents from
lum property but no laws existed that
:ou!d compel them to repair leaky
oofs or rotted floors, defective drains
ir dangerous walls. They often grew
ich while tenants suffered deplorable
onditions.
To remedy this evil, a number of
were passed. Some imposed on
he landlord the duty of carrying out
ertain necessary repairs, others forced
im to remedy, unsanitary conditions,
thers again, restricted rents.
Landlordism Diminished.
All these were successive reforms
nd doubtless applied to the more rap'
cious, which were a very few in com'
arisen to the millions of landlords
i England, but the incidence of these
.ws penalised the lot when only the
uilty ones should have been cited,
faturally, they resented the scandal
id inconvenience of being hauled be-
>re a court, particularly the gentry
ho may have allowed an old build'
ig to be used for nothing by a poor
mily upon whom they may have
ken pity, when the buildings should
ive been pulled down. Sometimes
ie landlords looked after them, giv'
g them food and clothing but they
mid not undertake repairs on an old
irn of a place for them. But the
w compelled them to make repairs.
mdlords Were Dignified.
The Landlords of England up to
at time were very dignified persons
id held their heads high in honour,
o have their pride belittled and their
putations presented to the world as
ough they were “ignominious mon-
;rs” was more than they could take,
hen they were, in fact (and those
maining still are) the greatest bene'
ctors of mankind.
To provide a roof over the heads
the masses, who could never have
lilt a home of their own, must sure'
ly rank with the efforts of farmers
and graziers who provide them with
food or merchants or businessmen who
provide them with clothes, transport
and even entertainment. All these
concern themselves with producing the
most, the latest, the finest or best —
with a profit motive as the spur for'
ward, in a builuup civilisation that
recognises these commodities as
something to be paid for.
Why Rentals Soared.
Why then, should property owners
be singled out to be treated with ig'
nominy? Rentals, like costs for wool,
wheat, fish and meat were competitive,
cheap and plentiful until legislation
was imposed, after which landlords
withdrew from the market and, with'
out competition, houses became scare'
er and scarcer and rentals soared.
There was no necessity for property
owners to remain in a field where
they would be insulted or belittled or
treated as criminals fleecing the un'
wary and all the people knew what
rentals they would be called upon to
pay before they moved in.
In addition, landlords were so leg'
islated against that investment rates
were too low and offered no induce'
ment for people who had to invest
wisely.
Now Governments as Landlords.
So the laws of England produced
the voluntary abolition of many pri'
vate landlords who formerly built
houses for the masses.
The shortages that followed soon
became acute and thus the laws creat'
ed the very conditions of slumland
that they were designed to remedy—
the same as they have in Australia.
Two world wars, a depression and a
recession have added to the home
shortage until we find such a condi'
tion of affairs that Governments in
England and Australia have to step
into the breach and provide millions
of homes (that landlords formerly
built) by dipping into the pockets of
the taxpayers for money to finance
them, and to make matters worse the
rentals are dearer now and the houses
just a bit smaller and much worse than
they were in the days when “faithfully
built individualistic houses” appealed
to the purchaser. Now, the home'
less will take anything, a stock'pat'
terned, prefabricated imported house,
s garage, an old tram car or a caravan
and feel lucky if they have a roof
over their heads.
People’s Money Used Instead
Of Loans.
Again, what is worse still, and this
is a highly unprincipled, if not a dis'
honourable thing, the politicians, who
are taxing people excessively, see noth'
ing iniquitous in the fact that they
are taxing those who have in the
past “sweated blood” in years of hard
toil (that no worker of tO'day would
do) and by their diligence, “burning
the midnight oil,” cheeseparing and
self'denial, they have saved enough
to build a home of their own. Some
more enterprising have gone further
and built “the house next door” from
the rentals of which they had hoped to
provide an independence in their old
ages.
This rental is now called “unearned
increment” and is more heavily taxed.
In addition to having their rentals
taxed they have their present earnings
taxed away from them in order to
provide at public expense, a home for
those care Tree people who would
never bother to own a home of their
own.
And again, to make matters still
more iniquitous, politicians are com'
pelling us all to pay up to the hilt
right now. for the entire building
being built this year, whilst calling
upon the recipients to amortise their
capital in 20 year’s time. This taxa'
tion is wrongly extracted from the
pockets of the people, for obviously
if amortisation can be extended for
twenty years to the purchaser, why
cannot the collection of the money be
spread over 20 years? In other words,
why should this generation be crip'
pled with excessive taxation to pro'
vide in one year all the money that is
being spent on houses and works
(continued on page 53)
USING HEAT FROM THE SUN.
This shows the principle of one simple sys-
tem of using the sun’s heat, as Sir Ernest
Fisk once advocated for Australia. The sun’s
rays heat water in pipes in a glass-covered,
black lined box. The hot water rises into the
storage tank and cool water flows in at the
bottom. This hot-water service requires a
climate of ample hot sunshine. In cold weath-
er the two vertical pipes leading down the
side of the house are used to heat the water
at a range, fireplace, or furnace. For indus-
trial purposes, the chief problem of harness-
ing power generated by the sun’s heat is
storage.

when it should all come from loan
money and be gradually amortised.
Competition, Not Controls,
Is The Solution.
In Australia we would urge the
abolition of laws and Fair Rents Courts
that restrict landlordism by their in*
cidence; also laws and boards that
strangle people on the land, fishermen,
poultrymen and even slaughtermen
themselves are now to be slaughtered,
though they have rendered a faithful
service to the public. It is time we got
down to the good, fresh (referring to
meat, fish and eggs particularly, which
are far from being fresh under con*
trols) wholesome and competitive
ways of trading which will bring about
a reduction of costs and incidentally
will tremendously lessen taxation.
Remember that every dozen of eggs
sold has to bear the burden of nine*
pence a dozen to keep an egg-market*
ing board going.
England’s Rent Fixing.
In 1920, the first legislation against
landlords was passed in England by
fixing rents on certain classes of
house property. There are at present
eight million houses in the U.K.
with rents fixed either at 1914 levels
or those of 1939.
Ownership A Liability.
On the other hand, the cost of re*
pairs, rates and insurance charges have
increased over 200 per cent., even
since 1939. Thus, instead of being
a source of revenue, the ownership of
property has become a liability.
A tenant need not spend a penny
or lift a finger to do urgently needed
repairs. This is the landlord’s liabil*
ity. The tenant pays a rent which is
often the equivalent of no rent at all,
and he has security for life as long
as he pays it.
A house, once considered one of the
best forms of investment for the
thrifty small man, has become in thous'
ands of cases a liability to be shed
at all costs.
Landlords Run Away.
In Britain this shake*off of a burden*
some legal liability is being worked in
various ways. Some landlords just
lose themselves as far as local Autho'
rities are concerned. They run away
from their property. In Manchester
alone more than 100 owners of house
property cannot be traced.
In other cases, landlords try to per*
suade their tenants to accept their oc*
cupied houses or take them at a norni*
nal price, sometimes a matter of £l.
But tenants are too canny to accept
such “bargains.” As tenants they can
invoke the local Authority to make
the landlord do essential repairs, but
as owner'occupiers they would have to
shoulder that liability themselves.
Curious Position.
Britain to'day faces a curious posh
tion. On one hand, the Nation is
pressing on with a housing pro*
gramme; on the other hand, more
houses than are being built are becom*
ing derelict. Some 200,000 houses
are becoming obsolete every year.
Some of the derelict houses are taken
over by squatters, who pay no rent.
If they are told to go they simply
demand alternative accommodation
a Council house.
Property owners unable to give their
property away form limited liability
companies and go into liquidation as
soon as their capital is spent on re*
pairs.
Another method is the refusal of
rent. Other landlords apply for de'
molition orders.
One Remedy.
The only remedy for this deplor*
able state of things, according to most
U.K. Authorities, is the reversion of
the Rent Restrictions Act.
Owners protest that, although the
accommodation of the new Council
houses is no bigger than that of old
cottages and small houses with com

trolled rents, the Council houses rent
at up to 30/- a week, while the old
cottages may be controlled at as little

To-day, property owners are finding
their investments transformed by legis-
lation into a crushing liability, both in
Britain and in Australia.
As long as present conditions last,
the housing problem can never be

an old house crumbles into ruins, is
condemned, or is demolished. It is
like walking up an escalator the wrong

Earthmoving and

Standard Names.
The Standards Association of Aus-

“A Glossary of Names for Earthmov-

glossary defines the wide range of
names commonly used in connection
with earthmoving machinery and con-
structional plant in order to establish
a standard nomenclature for Australia.
It was undertaken at the request of
the Conference of State Road Auth-
orities of Australia mainly as a result
of the confusion since the Second
World War because of the variety of
names adopted for similar machinery
or equipment.

April, 1953. There will be daytime
and evening sessions dealing with
technical and economic aspects of re-
frigeration, and inspections of refrige-
ration plant and research laboratories.
A reception. Conference dinner and
harbour cruise will provide oppor-

New Sydney Chapel and Monastery
ARCHITECTS OVERCOME UNUSUAL DIFFICULTIES.
Work has commenced on the con'
version of a former furniture store
and warehouse in George Street, Hay'
market, for the purposes of a R.C.
Chapel.
The premises, when alterations are
completed, will be used as the first
chapel and monastery of the Blessed
Sacrament Fathers in Sydney.
Because of the proximity of com-
mercial buildings to the proposed
chapel, the architects, D. T. Gordon
and Morrow, were confronted with
unusual difficulties which they over-
came after careful study.
Based on functional requirements,
their design is in harmony with the
latest overseas trends in church archi-
tecture, particularly in the Americas
and Scandinavian countries (see illus-
tration).
Besides being a R.C. Shrine the
chapel—and later a church to be erect-
ed on the adjoining site —will be a
memorial to the men and women of
N.S.W. who died for their country
during the two World Wars.
Features.
The chapel will be 72ft. deep and
32ft. wide. Its frontage will be of
sandstone with a granite base.
A feature will be large windows 28
ft. high and 23 ft. wide and an 18
ft. high Crucifix with a bronze corpus.
A tower-like effect is to be given
to the background area of the Cruci-
fix by the use of narrow verticular
stonework in contrast with the squares
under the windows.
Inside the chapel the gallery and
main body of the building will ac-
commodate 350 people.
In addition to the main altar of
marble there will be a side altar and
four shrines.
A small Lady Chapel is being plac-
ed in the existing stone building to
the left of the main chapel.
The entrance to the monastery,
which will be in Sussex Street, will be
between these two chapels.
The property now undergoing com
version housed a modern furniture
store with a three-storey frontage to
George Street and four storeys to
Sussex Street, together with two old'
er buildings adjoining.
When the proposed church is event'
ually built to the left of the chapel
its design will be fully in keeping
with that of the chapel.

Broken Hill Silver City of the West
“OUT OF THIS WORLD,” SAY ITS CITIZENS.
A first'tripper to Broken Hill recent'
ly returned breathless to Sydney—he
had used all his superlatives on the
journey trying to describe Australia’s
greatest boom'town.
He had found the Silver City a
fabulous, fantastic place, with a
wealthy, contented, civic'proud, sen'
siblydiving population of 34,000
people.
He had found that Broken Hill
was, above all, a Sovereign State in
itself.
Hardy travellers, inured to the pri'
vations of living in Sydney, report
that Broken Hill certainly does not
regard itself as part of N.S.W. ah
though it is geographically . and offi'
dally.
Here are three points to prove
their contention:
• Broken Hill put its clocks back
to coincide with South Australian
time.
• The Post Office mail boxes are
listed as follows: “Local Letters,”
“South Australian Letters,” “Victorian
Letters,” and “Other Places.”
The N.S.W. mail is posted, of
course, in the “Other Places” box.
• Broken Hill has its own ideas
about hotel closing hours, as you may
have read recently. The 39 hotels
in the city stay open until 10.30 at
night. These hotels are the last
word in hygiene and cleanliness—the
all'powerful Barrier Industrial Council
insists on that! There are also nine
clubs to cater for various sections of
the community.
Splendid Clubs.
Most of the clubs are resplendent
beyond the fondest dreams of most
Sydney organisations and associations.
The recently'Opened R.S.L. Club
is, they say, right up in the Holly'
wood class. It is a magnificent struc'
ture of brick and concrete, immense
bars, masses of glass, and decorative
red morocco furnishings that would
grace a Sultan’s palace.
The main bar is as big as an aver'
age-sized town hall, with huge bill'
iards, cards, and sports rooms adjoin'
ing. The building includes a library
and a special lounge (with bar) for
the ladies.
The R.S.L. paid £78,000 spot cash
on its premises, and the new business'
men’s club is to cost £80,000!
Another club is being remodelled
at a cost of £40,000.
Only a fabulous city like Broken
Hill with its just on £1,000,000 a fort'
night payroll could afford such amen'
ities.
8.1. C. All-Powerful.
Dominating the whole scene is the
all'powerful Barrier Industrial Coum
cil, comprising representatives of the
mining unions and other unions in
the district.
From an industrial viewpoint, at
least, the 8.1. C. is the whole law.
Here are a few facts:
• You can’t get a job on the mines
without the O.K. of the 8.1. C.
• There are two groupings regard'
ing mines’ employment:
• A group: Those who have
lived in Broken Hill for a minimum
period of seven years;
• B group: Those who have lived
within a 30Omile radius of Broken
Hill, or marry a Broken Hill girl.
• But the A groupers have prefer'
ence in employment, when it’s a case
of someone being retrenched.
Further Facts.
The further one delves into the
story of Broken Hilt, the more one
is amazed at the enormous progress
the city has made against great odds.
A milestone in the history of the
city was passed in the middle of last
year when the city water supply was
assured for all time by the completion
of the pipeline to Menindie, linking
the city supply with a Darling River.
Broken Hill’s silver, lead and zinc
mines alone consume 750,000,000 gab
lons of water a year. Until last Aug'
ust, the city had suffered from a ser'
ious shortage of water which preclud'
ed any large'scale beautification
scheme.
The linking of the town water sup'
ply with the Darling River at Menim
die was carried out jointly by the
Broken Hill Water Board, the N.S.W.
Public Works Dept., and the mining
companies.
The scheme makes an additional
4,000,000 gallons of water a week
available.
Huge sums of money have been
spent by the mining companies to pro'
vide amenities for the mining popula'
tion to compensate for the natural
disadvantage of drought, heat, flies,
sandstorms and isolation.
Nowadays, the “Silver City” is
linked to Sydney and Adelaide by fast
rail services and a network of airlines.
Nearly every member of the com'
munity owns his own motor car (the
city s 34,000 citizens had registered
over 11,000 motor vehicles at the lo'
cal traffic office as at October 30
last). This despite the fact that roads
beyond the city area are still in a woe'
ful state.
There are parks and playgrounds in
the city, and within the mining com'
panics’ holdings, for children; also
good schools, excellent libraries, an
Olympic swimming pool, N.S.W.’s
most up'to'date hospital, and splendid
sporting facilities.
A tree'planting scheme envisages
encircling the entire city with a
“green belt” half a mile wide.
Trees already planted have helped
halt the sand drift from the west.
Modern Homes.
The minimum £3O a week wages on
the mines (including an average £l5
lead bonus, has enabled most Broken
Hill miners to own their own homes,
and equip them with every possible
“labor'saver” and amenity.
Refrigeration, deep ' freeze, hot
water, electricity, washing machines,
electric ironers, the latest radios, are
all installed in the new homes.
Eighty per cent, of the homes are
owner'built and designed. (Each
month “Construction” prints full de-
tails of Broken Hill building returns.)
Finishes peculiar to the area are iron
with brick and concrete facings; iron
with timber exterior facing, and fibrous
plaster walls.
Roof insulation is becoming popular,
but tiles are rapidly replacing the
once universally'used iron.
Through the medium of cO'Opera'
tive housing societies, the mining com'
panics have assisted miners to build
many hundreds of houses (some 800
alone in the year ended September
30, 1952).
The roots of those who live in
Broken Hill grow deep into the rich
earth of the area, and people, once
established there, are reluctant to
leave.
As the city expands, it is taking on
an air of permanency.
The rich mineral deposits, which
have made the “Silver City,” are ex'
pected to continue to yield riches in
sufficient supply to support a city of
some 34,000 inhabitants on a scale
far more luxurious than that experi'
enced by residents in any other Aus'
tralian city or town .
Fantastic fabulous? yes, and
its out of this world, as its citizens
say!
A reader of a weekly paper wrote
to the Editor asking when it was
proper for a gentleman to remove his
hat. The Editor replied that it should
be done when mopping the brow,
when taking a bath, when eating,
when going to bed, when taking up a
collection, when having the hair trim'
med, when being shampooed, when
standing on his head.

Investigation of “Pigeonhole” Car Parks
Sydney City Council Makes Move.
In an effort to solve Sydney’s park-
ing problems, the City Council is in-
vestigating the possibilities of “pigeon-
hole” car parks, as successfully oper-
ated in the U.S.A.
The Lord Mayor, Aid. P. Hills,
said last week that the City Engineer,
Mr. A. H. Garnsey, had reported most
favourably on the American system.
“Pigeon-hole” parking is an open-
deck three to five-storey steel struc-
ture containing rows of cubicles in
which mobile lifts “pigeon-holes” cars
for a day.
Instead of using ramps or conven-
tional type lifts to give access to the
open car park decks, electrically-oper-
ated fork lift trucks are used.
Any vehicle can be returned to
the ground in 60 seconds.
Not Costly.
The Lord Mayor said that car
parks of this type had neither walls
nor roof, and were not costly to
build.
The heaviest cost would be the pur-
chase of electrically controlled lifting
equipment from the U.S.
Preliminary plans had been drawn
up, Alderman Hills said, but their im-
plementation would depend on the
outcome of negotiations with the State
Government for the transfer of auth-
ority of car parking.
“The City Engineer believes that,
providing the fork lifting equipment
is available, one station can be oper-
ating in 12 months.
“Dollars will have to be made avail-
able, otherwise the suppliers will have
to try to arrange for the equipment
to be manufactured here.
“Cars could be parked for the small
charge of 3/- a day,” the Lord Mayor
added.
(Sydney motorists pay an average
of about 6/- a day in private car
parks in the city.)
Transfer of Powers.
The Lord Mayor said that the
State Government had agreed in prin-
ciple to transferring its powers on city
parking to the City Council.
“The City Council is now consid-
ering draft legislation prepared by the
Government.
“As the law stands the Council has
power to resume lands, but not to
conduct a business like ’pigeon-hole’
parking.
“We have looked at three sites
near the citv which might be suitable
for ’pigeon-hole’ car parks, but until
the law is amended we can take no
action.”
In the past few months the City
Council has discussed two other pro-
posals to meet the parking problem,
but has arrived at no decision. The
proposals were:
• Parking meters in city streets;
# “Fringe” parking on the city’s
outskirts.
The council’s planning committee
is at present examining a proposal for
an underground car park at Belmore
Park, opposite Central Station. Here
one could drive in at Eddy Avenue
and out at Hay Street. An under-
pinning system such as those used in
mines to support the superstructure
could possibly be carried out without
disturbing the soil, trees, flowers and
grass in the park, though seepage
would require to be guarded against.
The park with all the facilities it of-
fers, like Hyde Park with entrances
in Park Street, is iust waiting to be
used for such a purpose. It has taken
a long while to train some of Sydney’s
aldermen to think along lines for the
development and improvement of this
city. It is to be hoped that Alderman
Hills will become a pace-maker in hav-
ing the city’s urgent problems solved.
CASTING A CONCRETE
COLUMN.
Supersedes Foundation Stone.
The ceremonial casting of a rein'
forced concrete column was substituted
for the traditional —but to-day largely
anachromatic —foundation stone laying
at the Plashet County Secondary
School at East Ham, Britain.
Chairman of the Education Commit-
tee with a “gang” of three Councillors
of the Corporation mixed, placed and
tamped the concrete for one of the
main columns of the building. Stain-
less steel tamping rods took the place
of the traditional trowel and were
presented to members of the gang by
the contractor, Mr. Bernard Sunley.
The architect, Mr. George Whitby,
then inspected and approved the work,
whereupon the Chairman of the
Education Committee declared the
column “well and truly cast.” The
column will be free-standing in the
entrance hall and will carry a bronze
plaque commemorating the ceremony.
(Right) “PIGEON-HOLE” CAR PARK. An American system favourably reported upon by Mr. A. H.
Garnsey City Engineer. (Left) “A FORK LIFT” finds no trouble at all to lift three cars ( Packed “ cases) in
one operation. The spreading area of the lifting plarform for a car (not packed in a owe)
lighter than the three cars shown, would offer no difficulties, if scientifically countcrweighted on the ground level.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA FIGHTS TUBERCULOSIS
The West Australian Health De-

the State is meeting with a large meas-
ure of success.
As well as the saving of lives, the
aim is to conserve to the nation the
millions of “man-hours” which until
now have been dissipated through the
progressive ill-health and inefficiency
of the thousands of people the dis-
ease attacks annually.
At the chest clinic in Murray St.,
Perth, an extensive investigation and
X-ray examination programme is be-
ing conducted.
For the care of infants, whose par-
ents are tubercular, a preventorium
has been established. A system of
visiting nurses and social workers has
been organised. Extensions and im'
provements have been made to the
Wooroloo Sanitorium.
Next steps considered urgent will
be a start on the construction of the
proposed new Chest Hospital (as pic-
tured), estimated to cost £1,700,000,
and the enlargement of the headquart-
ers in Murray Street at a cost of
£175,000.

Robbialac Suede
Wall Finish
New Product Immediate Success.
Some interesting Trade reports
have been received by Jenson &
Nicholson respecting Robbialac Suede
Wall Finish recently introduced by
them, which would indicate that this
new product answers the tradesman’s
search over many years for such a
general purpose flat paint.
The following extracts are of inter-
est to builders:
Report No. 1.
Surface painted was fibrous plaster
ceiling, fairly old, which had been
last coloured with a casein bound
water paint. It was not flaking but
was very discoloured. However, two
coats were found to be ample for per-
fect coverage and the darkest of marks
covered easily. No sealer was used.
It dried a dead matt finish with no
visible brushmarks and no “flaking.”
The paint was applied liberally and
coverage was approximately 700 sq. ft.
per gallon on this surface.
Report No. 2.
I recently tried out your new pro-
duct on the exterior of cement rend-
ered walls. For this job I had to use
ladders, and it was very awkward to
move on each stretch. I found I had
no lap marks, in all it flowed on
beautifully. I covered approximately
400 sq. ft. on cement covered walls
and find the brushware easy to wash
after.
Report No. 3.
It does all that is claimed of it and
more. It can be applied over Kalso-
mine providing it is in good condi-
tion, and not too thick. It is also an
excellent means of eliminating water
stains on a ceiling or wall.
I have also found that one can ob-
tain really deep colours by the addi-
tion of oil stainers without any sign
of “sheariness.”
Report No. 4.
No trouble was experienced with
keeping the wet edge on a wall with
the sun shining hard at it around mid-
day. The final coat was broken half-
way down the wall and resumed after
lunch. This wall dried out without
showing any sign of scuffing where
the work was picked up again. Also,
as a further test, a patch of approxi-
mately 3 square feet was painted over
the final coat in the afternoon and
the most critical eye could not find
the patch the following morning.
As an exterior flat it is by far the
best that has come under our notice
in 25 years’ association with the trade.
Since its introduction only a few
short weeks ago, Suede already is
stocked in the full range of tints and
colours by most representative distrib-
utors and stores throughout the Sydney
Metropolitan area.
Spheroidal Graphite
Cast Iron
The Mond Nickel Company’s British
Patent No. 630,070 covering the pro-
duction of spheroidal graphite cast
iron by the magnesium process has
now been granted. This grant is the
culmination of long proceedings before
the Patent Office and the Patents
Appeal Tribunal.
The process provides a range of cast
irons with double the strength of all
previous known types and eliminates
the brittleness normally associated with
iron castings. These irons are proving
of the greatest possible importance to
designers in all branches of engineer-
ing.
The application for this patent was
made in March, 1947. and in May,
1948, the first public disclosure of the
process was made simultaneously in
Great Britain and the U.S.A.
In October, 1949, the Application
was accepted by the British Patent
Office, and published. Opposition to
grant of the patent was lodged by
The Meehanite Metal Corporation on
the grounds that the invention had
been disclosed in certain nrior publica-
tions, and that the nature of the in-
vention and the manner in which it is
performed was not sufficiently and fair-
ly described in the specification.
In June, 1952, after protracted pro-
ceedings, the Patent Office gave its
decision agreeing to seal the patent.
Appeal against the decision was made
to the Patents Appeal Tribunal and
the hearing before this Tribunal took
place on November 10-12, 1952, when
Mr. Justice Lloyd-Jacob directed that
the patent should be granted.
This final decision clarifying the
Patent position will be particularly
welcome to the numerous licensees of
The Mond Nickel Company who are
actively engaged in the manufacture
of spheroidal graphite cast iron by the
magnesium process. Similarly, for en-
gineers it will remove all doubts about
the sources of supply of this important
and valuable material.

TO-DAY.
Let me to-day do something that shall
take
A little sadness from the world's
vast store,
And mav I be so favoured as to make
Of joy’s too scanty sum a little
more.
Let me not hurt by any selfish deed,
Or thoughtless word, the heart of
foe or friend.
Nor would I pass, unseeing, worthy
need,
Or sin by silence where I should
defend.
However meagre be my worldly
wealth,
Let me give something that shall
aid my kind—
A word of courage, or a thought of
health,
Dropped as I pass for troubled
hearts to find.
Let me to-night look back across the
span
'Twixt dawn and dark, and to my
conscience say:
“Because of some good act to beast
or man
The world is better that I lived to
day.”

Sawdust as a Soil Improver
MEANS OF UTILIZATION.
By W. M. McKENZIE.
Can great volumes of sawdust be
saved from the rotting heap or the
destructor to the profit of both saw'
miller and the primary producer?
More work on both technical and
economical aspects is necessary before
a complete answer can be given, but
meanwhile it can be said that where
sawdust is on the spot it can be used
to improve the soil.
Possible Methods of Using
Sawdust as a Soil Improver.
Mixed raw with soil;
In compost heaps;
As a mulch;
Chemically treated, then mixed with
soil.
Use of Raw Sawdust.
Attempts to use straight sawdust
mixed with the soil in cropping have
usually failed. Experiments have
shown that such failures are due to
nitrogen deficiency. This is caused by
the greatly increased activity of bac'
teria which break down the wood sub'
stance. Any organic material, such as
straw, grass, or animal manure, has
this effect to greater or lesser degree.
The bacteria compete with plants for
the nitrogen available in the soil, and
if this is not sufficient for both, both
suffer. Thus nitrogen must be added
with the sawdust. It may be in the
form of animal waste (e.<*., absorbed
in sawdust bedding in cowyard or fowl'
yard) or of ammonium sulphate or
potassium nitrate. Estimates of the
necessary amount vary.
Sawdust definitely improves th e
structure of a soil. It loosens a heavy
soil and improves the water and fer'
tiliser holding properties of a light
soil. The problem is how to obtain
these benefits while avoiding its bad
effects.
Mulching.
Some of the beneficial effects of
sawdust water absorption and pre'
vention of crusting are obtained by
using it as a mulch. A layer several
inches thick is desirable. Since the
nitrogen depression is less on some
soils with low demand or perennial
crops, the harmful effects are not
evident. In other cases a small amount
of added nitrogen, about 50 lb. am'
monium sulphate to the ton of saw'
dust, may be sufficient to relieve any
deficiency.
Composting.
Sawdust may be used in the same
way as garden rubbish to build com'
post heaps, adding animal manure,
blood and bone or ammonium sub
phate to provide nitrogen to supply
to the plants. The period of decom'
position is about twice as long as that
for straw or garden waste.
Chemical Decomposition.
Some quicker, cheaper way of
breaking down sawdust seems desir'
able. Hydrolysing by acid treatment
would appear to offer one method.
Some claim good results with sawdust
heated with acid at temperatures above
212 degrees Fahrenheit, neutralised
and restored to 15 per cent, moisture
content. If the latter tests were to be
confirmed, this would offer the best
possibilities. Nitrogen and other fer'
tilisers could be added to improve the
nutriment value. Some such treatment
may be possible at the sawmill, or at
a group of sawmills.
Thus promising outlets for sawdust
as a soil improver seem to be as fob
lows: —
(1) As a mulch for low'demand or
perennial crops, pastures and
orchards. Small amounts of
nitrogen and other fertilisers
may be necessary.
(2) With large amounts of added
nitrogen (2 per cent.) if to be
mixed with soil. This is a
good proposition where sawdust
can be readily obtained for
cowyard or fowlyard bedding.
(3) After composting, with lesser
amounts of nitrogen added,
and perhaps “accelerators” to
shorten the period.
(4) After hydrolysing at or above
212 degrees Fahrenheit with a
cheap acid, neutralising, and
adding other fertilisers to ex'
tend the nutriment value.

IDLEWILD AIRPORT.
America’s Largest Civil Airport.
Idlewild, America’s largest civil air'
port and one of the most important
in the world, recently came nearer to
completion by the construction of the
control tower, which is 150 ft. high.
This seems ridiculous by our stan'
dards for an airport control tower
when it is the same height as our
tallest buildings, but compared with
New York’s adjacent skyscrapers it is
comparatively near the ground.
Area of Idlewild is 4900 acres;
Mascot is 400, and when the develop'
ment scheme is finished it will be 1500
acres.
THE PROBLEM OF TRANSPORT.
The “Pentagon” Stampede.
Speaking at the Eighth Pan'
American Congress of Architects held
in Mexico City in December last.
Professor Walter Gropius, of Harvard
University, said:
A warning to take to heart in
modern planning and development is
the literally frightening traffic problem
of the Defence Department’s Pentagon
buildin? in Washington, D.C., which
provides enough office space for
40,000 persons but leaves them help'
less as stampeded cattle when they try
to get in and out.
KENYA’S ROYAL LODGE.
The Royal Lodge in Kenya where the Queen, as Princess Elizabeth stayed, during her sojourn
in Africa prior to coming to Australia, which latter was so tragically prevented by the death
of the King. The site is carefully chosen at the end of a little-frequented road cut though
virgin country and Commanding magnificent views of the Sagana River and Mount Kenya.

CAPACITIES OF PLUMBING
STACKS.
New American Study.
The problem of the capacity of a
vertical plumbing drainage stack in a
buildine has never been solved satis-
factorily.
The “Capacities of Plumbing Stacks
in Buildings,” by Robert S. Wyly and
Herbert N. Eaton, of the U.S.
National Bureau of Standards Building
Materials and Structures reports an
attempt to ascertain the maximum load
that can be brought into the stack
from a horizontal branch when water
is being discharged down the stack
from fixtures on higher floors—one of
the more complicated problems of
stack capacities. A theoretical ap-
proach to the problem resulted in a
formula, which was then tested by
experiment.
Obviously no building drainage sys-
tem can be designed economically un-
less the minimum sizes of pipes to be
used can be predicted. This first phase
of a projected complete investigation
is concentrated on the drainage stack
and its horizontal branches, which
comprise most of the larger pipes used
in .the system.
The report summarises previous re-
search on stack capacities and gives
an account of attempts to define stack
capacity. It outlines the problem of
stack capacity, describes tests to de-
termine terminal velocities and ter'
minal lengths in stacks and tests on
stacks and drains, and analyses hydrau'
lie and pneumatic conditions in a
stack in a multistorey building. It
also suggests applications of the re'
suits of the investigation and lists
references to relevant literature.

Building Research Report
MANY PROBLEMS UNDER INVESTIGATION.
[Extracts from the Eighth Annual Report for the year ending 30th June, 1952,
of the Division of Building Research, C.5.1.R.0., Melbourne,}
That the services of Building Re-
search is being utilised is borne out
by the fact that during the twelve
months 2500 enquiries were received.
These were made up as follows:
Commonwealth Departments, 15%;
State Denartments, 10%; Municipali-
ties, 1%; architects, 6%; engineers,
2%; manufacturers, 25%; trade asso-
ciations, 5%; builders, 9%; private
individuals, 26%; miscellaneous, 1%.
That enquiries from private people
predominates is probably due to the
high pronortion of owner-builders in
this country, for about 45% of the
estimated total of 80,000 dwelling;
begun during 1951/52 were being
built by their prospective occupiers.
Reinforced Gypsum Plaster.
Precast load-bearing reinforced plas-
ter walls are being increasingly used in
houses in south-east Australia. How-
ever, there is little or no basic infor-
mation about the durability and
strength of reinforced plaster and an
investigation has been started on these
properties.
There has been some unsightly rust
staining on.the surfaces of the walls
immediately above the reinforcement.
To determine whether this is accom-
panied by a reduction in strength and
whether it can be avoided by the
addition of small amounts of lime to
the plaster, specimens of reinforced
and unreinforced plaster and of plaster
and lime have been exposed to the
weather for twelve months. So far
there has been no reduction in strength
associated with the stains. It appears
that they can be avoided by the ad-
dition of the lime with only a slight
resultant reduction in strength.
Technical Advice to Lime
Industry,
At the request of the Planning
Section of the Australian Aluminium
Production Commission, the plans for
the Commission’s lime - burning and
sorting plant at Bell Bay, Tasmania,
were studied and discussed and several
alterations mainly concerning equip-
ment for screening and for transport-
ing and storing the burnt products
were suggested.
Sand-Lime Bricks.
With the opening at Traralgon of
a second works the sand-lime brick
industry appears soundly established
in Victoria. From its inception this
works has been in close contact with
the Division, and a detailed labora-
tory study, now almost complete, of
the properties of the bricks being pro-
duced confirms their good quality as
shown by previous tests.
A method for producing coloured
sand-lime bricks, making use of the
natural colour of the sand rather than
pigment, has been introduced by one
of the works and consists of surface
treatment of the bricks with acid fol-
lowed by washing. Laboratory tests
show that the acid affects only a very
thin surface layer and has no dele-
terious effect on the bricks, and
weathering tests show that the colour
is stable and that the bricks do not
darken as untreated bricks tend to do.
The treatment can be applied to walls
already erected.
Clays and Clay Products.
During the year Professor Ralph E.
Grim, Research Professor of Geology
in the University of Illinois, U.S.A.,
and a world authority on clays, visited
Australia for three months, arrange-
ments for his visit being made by the
Division, and officers accompanied him
while he was in New South Wales,
Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania.
N.S.W. Kaolinite Deposit.
A most promising deposit of kaolin
from New South Wales has recently
been studied. The material is a mix-
ture of kaolinite (about 70%) and
illite, about 30%). It is very low in
iron and burns off-white. Its plastic
and slip-forming properties make it
eminently suitable for pottery and
stoneware and it could be used in
artificial bonding sands. Because of its
nearly white colour and high content
(85%) of fine particles (less than 5/*),
it could be used as a filler for paper,
rubber and other industrial products.
The Wianamatta shale from the
Sydney area also is being thoroughly
investigated, and it has been shown
that by controlling the firing condi-
tions attractive bricks with a red-
brown or orange colour, instead of the
usual olive-drab of common bricks in
Sydney, can be easily ob.ained.
Caulking Compounds.
The study of jointing compounds
suitable for use in concrete water
channels of the State Electricity Com-
mission and of the State Rivers and
Water Supply Commission of Vic-
toria has continued and has related
mainly to the provision of flow data
unon which the design of continuous
extrusion equipment may be based.
On a visit abroad the officer super-
vising the work paid special attention
to overseas practice regarding the seal-
ing of joints in water-retaining struc-
tures. In the United States of America

often used for caulking large canals, a
delivery of up to 10,000 pounds of
mastic per day being possible by this
means. Although this is in excess of
Australian requirements the technique
is -robably the most suited to local
needs. In the United States the pre-
ferred jointing materias for canal work
are the two-part, cold-set-up mastics
preferably containing rubber. Details
of these were obtained with a view to
manufacture and testing under Aus-
tralian conditions.
Concrete Floor Surfaces.
Experiments on the effect of dif-
ferent floor surfaces on the tempera-
ture of the shod feet of fifteen sub-
jects sitting in a controlled-temperature
room have confirmed that there does
not appear to be any physical basis
for the popular opinion that concrete
floors even when dry are uncomfort-
ably cold for shod feet.
In addition to these laboratory ex-
periments a survey has been made
from published data of the extent to
which concrete floors are used in the
United States of America. Figures
published by the U.S. Housing and
Home Finance Agency showed that
22% of all single-unit dwellings be-
gun in 1950 had concrete slab floors,
whereas there were practically no such
floors in 1940. The popularity of
concrete floors in America is even
more strikingly illustrated by the fact
that 62% of the better-class custom-
built homes described in recent lead-
ing American architectural journals
have such floors of which nearly half
have some kind of hard finish. It is
apparent that in America concrete
floors with or without ‘resilient sur-
faces are not considered too hard for
comfort.
Flat Rcof Construction.
There is now ample confirmation of
earlier tentative conclusions that the
success of flat roofing depends very
largely on the adequacy of the design
and execution of the work generally
and of flashing and joints in particular.
The conclusion has been reached that
the high reputation and performance
of flat roofing in certain overseas
countries compared with Australia de-
pend more on these factors than on
any inferiority of Australian materials
or stringencies of Australian climatic
conditions.
In the United Kingdom especially,
high standards of roofing are ensured
bv detailed consideration, in advance,
of the general layout and of the treat-
ment of roof details. Here the archi-
tect has the assistance of the excellent
technical service sections attached to
the contracts departments of the major
roofing firms, and also he may discuss
his problems independently with the
staff of the British Felt Roofing Gon-
tractors Advisory Board.
The differing circumstances of the
roofing industry in Australia make it
unlikely that these desiderata could be
introduced here, but it is believed pos-
sible and highly desirable that flat
roof construction should be planned
and specified in greater detail than is
normally done at present.
Although the foregoing remarks ap-
ply chiefly to bituminous felt or “built-
up” roofing, some of them apply also
to mastic asphalt roof membranes. In
England mastic asphalt is deservedly
popular and its success seems to de-
pend very largely on the traditional
and highly developed craftsmanship of
English asphalters.

INTERIM CODES FOR STEEL
STRUCTURES.
Steel Working Stresses Increased
10 Per Cent.
The Standards Association of Aus'
tralia announces the publication of
three new S.A.A. codes relating to
building construction. Their imme'
diate issue in the S.A.A. interim series
follows from a conference held in
December, 1951, to consider a request
from the Prime Minister of Australia
that existing codes be examined to
provide maximum economy in the use
of structural steel.
Minimum Design Loads.
The Interim Specification S.A.A.
fnt. 350 deals with minimum design
oads, ’including dead loads, floor live
oads, dynamic loads arising from the
effects of machinery and the like, and
vind loading. The code is intended
o provide a realistic assessment of
oads and makes provision for maxi'
num economy in design consistent
hth safety. The section on wind
oading has been sought by designers
or a considerable time and should
lake nossible a Inore intelligent and
:ientific provision for such loads than
as been the case hitherto,
tiuctural Steel in Buildings.
Interim Specification S.A.A. Int.
51, “Use of Structural Steel in Build'
igs,” is a revision of Australian
tandard No. CA.M939, and is
ised largely on the more up'to'date
ritish Standard 449'1948. Signify
int features of the new code are the
xognition of working stresses some
higher than those in the present
A.S. No. CA. 1, and the provisions
for design methods based on semi'
rigid or fully'rigid designs.
Manual Metallic Arc
Welding.
The other new code, S.A.A. Int.
352, deals with the use of manual
metallic arc welding in building con-
struc ion and supersedes A.S. No.
CA.8'1939 so far as manual welding
in building construction is concerned,
h was felt that the issue of a more
up'to'date code would encourage the
use of welded construction and pro'
mote the economies which welding
makes possible. The code now pub'
(ished was drafted by the Australian
Welding Institute (Inc.), who drew
largely on the American Welding
Society’s Code for Arc and Gas Weld'
ing in Building Construction. It is
extensively illustrated by diagrams of
ihe various types of weld and an ap'
Pendix contains examples of calcula-
tions based on the code.
As pointed out earlier, these three
codes have been issued in the interim
series to enable their immediate use by
the building construction industry in
the interests of economy. It is in'
tended in each case that the codes as
now issued should be subject to early
review in the light of experience in
•«**", a PP^ ca^on ) and the Association
will be pleased to receive constructive
comment on them.
Copies of the three codes are avail'
able from the Headquarters of the
Association, Science House, Glouces'
rer 6? Essex Streets, Sydney, and from
branch offices in capital cities and at
Newcastle. The price of each is 5/'.
BUSINESS RESPECTS TRADITION.
New American Office in Colonial Style
[?]en the Jenney Manufacturing Company, probebly the oldest oil firm in America, decided
build a new office structure alongside the Worcester Turnpike in Newton, Massachusetts, it
at to colonial lines in keeping with its close links with colonial history. By increasing the
mal sizes of the windows, the architects achieved a measure of modern, natural lighting
[?]out actually using contemporary picture wondows. At the same time. the building main-
[?]s a businesslike dignity that is characteristic of the entire Jenney system. Tailored to a
[?]ctly New England organisation, the new office building stringently akheres to the New
England tradition. Many companiews are following the move into the suburbs.

CHURCH LIGHTING
AS A MEMORIAL
In Port Sunlight Church.
Christ Church, Port Sunlight, has
dose associations with the Leverhulme
amily and now contains a memorial
0 the second Viscount Leverhulme in
he form of a stained glass window
md a new lighting scheme in the nave
md chancel.
This church, a personal gift of the
irst Viscount Leverhulme to the viL
aee of Port Sunlight, is a cruciform
luilding of local red sandstone; the
oof is timbered with unstained and
nvarnished pitchpine. The floor is
atterned in black and white Italian
larble.
After some consideration, a light'
ig scheme employing silvered mirror
Sectors was decided upon, these
eing mounted at the angle formed
y the walls and cross beams. In
rder to increase the diffusion of the
E[ht and to improve the appearance
f the fittings when viewed from the
ist end, it was decided to mount the
Ivered reflectors within a special fit'
ig having frosted glass. The top of
ie fitting is glazed with clear glass,
► that the timbered roof receives
ime illumination.
A total of sixteen of these specially
signed fittings mounted in the nave,
id a further four in the chancel, pro'
de very even and satisfactory light'
g. Each fitting contains one 200'
att and three 60'watt lamps. Extra
umination on the altar is provided
r four silvered mirror reflectors suit'
•Ie for 150/200'watt lamps.
The fittings, manufactured by The
eneral Electric Co. Ltd., were based
1 a design suggested by Lever
■others. Port Sunlight, Ltd., whose
iff also carried out the installation.

MERCURY LIGHTING IN A
GASWORKS retort house.
In the past little specialised attem
>n has been given to the provision
adequate lighting in gasworks re'
rt houses, but the construction of a
)dern horizontal retort installation
s now presented the opportunity of
oviding lighting conditions of the
?hest efficiency. The effect of light'
’ in a retort house, however, de'
nds partly on the quality as well as
i quantity of light; experience has
own that the blue'green light of
.rcury lamps minimises the obscurity
used by smoke and steam when a
:ort is discharged.
For this reason it was decided to
install mercury lamps in the new re'
tort house at the Watford Works of
the Eastern Gas Board, which came
into service recently. The installation,
carried out by the Board’s staff, was
planned by The General Electric Co.
Ltd., and comprises seventeen Osram
250'watt mercury lamps in I4in. vit'
reous enamel reflector fittings with
dust-proof front glasses. The fittings
have heavy'duty Saaflux tops, which
are resistant to corrosive atmospheres.
Six fittings are attached to stan'
chions at both sides of the building to
illuminate the charging and discharg'
ing floors of the retort house. The
mounting height is 15ft., and the fit'
tings are at a spacing of 20ft. A
sheet steel box containing the choke
and capacitor necessary for operating
the lamp is attached to the same stan-
chion as each fitting. The new in'
stallation has considerably improved
working conditions, and maintenance
of machinery can now be carried out
in many cases without using local
lighting.

STEEL FRAMEWORK
Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modern school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and Hilcon lightweight precast reinforced
concrete Roof, Floor and Wall units.
AH Presweld Components are permanently rust
proofed by the hot dip galvanizing process.

FIRE TESTS ON GUNITE SLABS
AND PARTITIONS.
Sawdust Prevents Spalling,
“Fire Tests of Gunite Slabs and Par-
titions,’’ by Nolan D. Mitchell, of the
U.S. National Bureau of Standards
Building Materials and Structures (Re-
port BMS131), describes tests made
to investigate the properties of gunite
in slabs and partitions when subjected
to standard fire exposures. Gunite,
extensively used to line flumes, con-
duits, sewers, and reservoirs, is also
utilised as a fire-protective covering
on structural members and for readily
applied coatings, such as stucco, on
buildings. This type of concrete has
been suggested as suitable for use in
the construction of fire-resistant cur-
tain walls to prevent or to reduce the
spread of fire among flammable mate-
rials.
In addition to reporting the fire
endurance limits of gunite of 1:4
conventional cement and sand mix,
the publication presents a means of
improving the fire resistance of the
concrete bv modifying the aggregate.
N.B.S. conducted fire - endurance
tests on eight slabs and four partitions
made of gunite concrete with welded-
wire fabric reinforcement. The con-
crete aggregate for two partitions was
sand, and a third had a minor amount
of asbestos added. The aggregate of
the fourth consisted of equal volumes
of sand and sawdust. Inclusion of
sawdust in the concrete increases the
porosity, permitting the escape of
moisture, and lowers the thermal con-
ductivity. It also prevents spalling
and thus delays failure.

MINERAL RESOURCES OF N.T.
Two mineral fields discovered in
the Northern Territory have revealed
the promise of big tin deposits.
They might make Australia inde-
pendent of imported tin, according
to Mr. Latham Withall, director of
the Associated Chambers of Manu-
factures.
He said the Mineral Resources
Board had also uncovered a deposit
of ore in the centre of Arnheim Land
Reserve containing up to 40 per cent,
zinc.
Another deposit about 300 miles
south-east, in the McArthur River dis-
trict, was being investigated by the
Zinc Corporation.
Mr. Withall said a detailed geolog-
ical survey of Arnheim Land which
would take years to complete, was
under way, and encouraging results
already had been achieved.

Mineral surveys in Australia were

He added that in the last 18 months
U.S. enterprises had announced plans
to spend about £50,000,000 on pro-

further investment were far from ex'
hausted.
Russians Build
“Floating Town”
The official Soviet Communist Party
journal, “Pravda,” recently described
a “floating town” built on platforms
over the Caspian Sea.
In 1949 oil of high octane content
was struck near a group of reefs
known locally as oily stones, many
miles off the coast of the inland sea
near Baku.
A base was needed for other boring
stations so platforms were built over
the reefs at suitable positions.
The platforms were then connected
by bridges. Prefabricated houses were
erected on the platforms and “Pravda”
now describes the place as a proper
town with streets and squares floating
on the sea.
GARDFN RESTAURANT.
Circular struts set at slight angle and sup-
porting the heavy cantilever to the roof gives
a nautical atmosphere to this German garden
restaurant. It is not quite clear just what
is the strange pattern in the ceiling near the
top of the struts. It must be regarded as
successful, as everyone who sees it will ask
“what’s that in aid of?” and thus it will
have created the interest intended.

A PIONEER ARCHITECT
AND JOURNALIST.
Francis Nixon.
In “Background to Beechworth
(Vic.), 1852 ' 1952," will be found
some interesting references to this
mining town’s first architect and later
journalist. It is noteworthy how often
these two professions are embraced by
one and the same person.
A young English architect, a recent
arrival as a passenger in a sailing ship
to Melbourne, was appointed Govern'
ment Architect early in 1853, and was
sent to Beechworth, then being open'
ed up as a rich gold'mining centre
near Buffalo in the Victorian Alps.
The brochure states: “The warden was
followed in June (1853) by Francis
Nixon, Government Architect.
Nixon’s first duties were to have erect'
ed a wooden post office near the site
of the present office; also a footbridge
over Spring Creek. . . .’’ And “Later
in the year Mr. Nixon, Government
Architect, drew up plans for a more
suitably equipped post office. . . .”
And “Mr. Nixon, Government Archi'
tect. shortly after his arrival in the
early ’fifties, erected the first bridge
to span the creek.” Also “In 185 3
the Government Architect, Mr. Nixon,
arrived on the scene and one of his
duties was to supervise the erection
of suitable prisoners’ quarters. These
took the form of five or six long
wooden buildings with shingle roofs,
the whole being enclosed by a stockade
of Bft. slabs topped with spikes.”
For a young man of 22, journalism
had more appeal, and in January,
1855, he became editor of the first
newspaper called “The Orens and
Murray Advertiser,” still extant, and
rated as the 6d. country journal pub'
lished in Victoria.
At this time, R. O’Hara Burke, of
Burke and Wills fame, was chief of
the Police Force and is mentioned as
being present in 1855 at a concert in
Beechworth.
Later on. Mr. Nixon gave up his
editorial post to run a paper of his
own, as the brochure quotes: “ ‘The
Constitution and Mining Intelligence.’
This newspaper was established by Mr.
F. Nixon . , . and the first copy was
printed on August 13th, 1856. That
same year it became a daily. . .
Copies of “The Orens 6? Murray
Advertiser,” in the hands of his son
~F. O. Nixon— contain in*lBs3 issues
the controversy on the claims of the
Goulburn and Murray Rivers for
priority of river transport.

BIG WINDOWS AND LITTLE WINDOWS.
The whole gamut of window sizes is run in these four plans. Bottom left features the interior of the lounge,
which although 20 feet long in the perspective sketch looks at least fifty and rather like a waiting room at a
badly patronised airport. All one side is taken up by plate glass windows, presumably sliding. The other side
of the picture is persented in the bottom left design in which the windows on one side of lounge and dining room
are narrow slits or peepholes respectively. The upper two elevations are of the hard, four-square unsympathetic
type which seem to lack that atmosphere of "home."

House Built
In 3½ Hours
In Santa Rosa, California, a team
of men built a house in 3 hours 30
minutes 10 seconds. The house had
two bedrooms, a yard, a garden, and
all conveniences.
The men’s foreman started them
with a whistle and they were timed
with a stop-watch. All materials were
ready in advance and cut to design.
The same team of 200 men pre-
viously built a house in six and a
half hours.
In Britain, in 1926, a Christchurch
(Hants) bricklayer, Jobie Dean, erect-
ed the skeleton of a detached house in
eight days. In one day he laid 1500
bricks. Over eight days he laid 9000
bricks unaided.
(U.S.A. now has a bricklaying ma-
chine that can lay 20 times as many
bricks a day as is now possible by
hand labour.)
Latin America Wants
12,000,000 Houses
To House Its 154,000,000.
At the recent eighth Pan-American
Congress of Architects held at Mexico
City the dominant problem discussed
was the problem of housing large
populations.
Such comparative fripperies as the
merits of picture windows and tex-
tured walls were disregarded in the
face of the urgent report that Latin
America lacked exactly 11,722,168
dwelling places to house its 154,000,000
inhabitants with minimum decency.
Architect Luis Vera of Chile cal'
culated that 25,000,000 Latin Amen-
cans live in hovels under conditions
that wre described as sub-human.
It would take an investment of
1,500,000,000 dollars a year to build
the needed 1,400,000 housing units a
year, he said. He urged concerted
action to launch both public and pri-
vate campaigns to tackle the problem.
One after another, architects from
each country rose to echo the demand
for more vigorous and active efforts
throughout the hemisphere to take a
minimum decent shelter out of the
category of luxury and place it where
it belongs, on the list of human
necessities.
Money, of course, was conceded as
the greatest obstacle.
tn Praise Of Brick
The National Federation of Clay
Industries, London, has enterprise
and faith in their brick material. The
organisation has taken advertising
space in the leading technical journals
under the heading “Brick is so Ver-
satile,” to point out its charms.
No one can belittle the lasting qual-
ities of brick which stand alone, but
many have assailed its colour blend'
ings and artistic effects. The visiting
Dr. Burchard from U.S.A. assailed
the colour of our bricks when in
Sydney, as reported in the American
press and circulated by the Institute
of Architects in Sydney. Its bald ap-
plication, which the Editor of this
journal would like to assail, seeing
that it has such artistic possibilities,
was not even noticed by the Critic.
We print herewith the application
of Brick which brings out its beauty,
though some of us may find no charm
in the design of the circular, ended ex'
ample, or delight in the sculptured
panel where the limbs are out of
scale with the rest of the anatomy.
The feet, for instance, are as long as
the calf of the legs and longer than
the thighs. The bent elbow is as
thick through as the waist and the
hand hanging down is broader than
the neck. However, all this is the
fault of the artist and not of the
brickwork itself. The design and tex'
ture in the other examples are charm'
ing and show that the scope afforded
by this material has been fully ap
preciated. The effective balustrading
into which brick has been woven in
the lower right picture shows what
one can do with a little imagination
and a few bricks.
We are looking forward to the
time when we shall see, used in our
buildings, a finish to brickwork such
as these examples show.
It is a beautiful material if we
would only use it to advantage.
THE BEAUTY OF BRICK.
(Top) “Raked joints"help to give character
to this building, which has been provided
with a permanent flower box topped with
“Soldier Bricks”, to enhance the approach.
(Centre) Here emphasis has been laid on
proper brick bonding which epitomises
strength. The receding arches with rubbed
brick voissoirs distinguish the entrance
door. Emphasis is given to the corner by a
series of set-backs. (Bottom) Brick without
bonding introduces another variety employed
where something out of the ordinary is pre-
ferred. There is no end to the variety and
effects that can be introduced into brickwork
by imaginative minds and skilful hands.
VARIETY IN BRICK.
(Left) A with strin g corners and corbelled top, is just a little more
difficult than usual to effect, but it shows what can be done. The centre carving in brick-
work is startling. With a better understanding of anatomy and its proper proportions, this
could have been most effective. (Right) The acme of refinement is here seen. Everything
that could be woven into brick design hes been achieved with distinction. The balustrading is
most effective.

The British Building Industry
ACHIEVEMENTS IN WORLD WAR II.
History of the Second Warld War:
“Works and Buildings,” by C. M.
Kohan, 0.8. E., M.A. [price, 32/6d.;
publishers: H.M. Stationery Office and
i Longmans, Green and Co., London],
which is one of the series of Civil
Histories, tells the story of the war
; effort of the building and civil en-
gineering industries and their co-
operation with the Government
brought about by the demands of war.
The narrative is not a detailed tech-
nical description of works done but a
general review of the whole pro-
gramme, and the manner in which
building for first the rearmament pro-
gramme and then the special works
necessitated by war conditions were
brought under the direction of the
Government.
Consciousness on the need for co-
operation between the building indus-
try and the Government was voiced
as far back as 1936, when the rearma-
ment building programme laid before
Parliament in March of that year
focused attention on the huge de-
mands which the programme would
make on the industry.
The National Federation of Building
Trades Employers, speaking for the
industry as a whole, laid before the
Minister for Co-ordination of Defence
their views on the co-operation of
Government and industry in the build-
ing programme, and while expressing
their readiness to co-operate, they
made it clear that the building indus-
try was still acutely conscious of the
mistakes of the first world war and
the economic instability of the follow-
ing years which brought great diffi-
culties to the industry and much hard-
ship to its operatives.
The industry, therefore, took the
view that its present and future well-
being should be the concern of the
Government, and sought safeguards
against arbitrary and unco-ordinated
demands of Government departments
which might lead to a recurrence of
hese troubles. The tendency had
been for the Government to make its
demands upon the industry without
consideration of the effects of these
demands upon the industry as a whole,
and in the face of the new rearma-
ment building programme the Gov-
ernment showed itself unwilling to
embark hastily on a more co-operative
enterprise with industry. This was no
ioubt in part due to the fact that the
role of the building industry in war
:ould not be properly appreciated un-
too much Government control in pre'
war days might well be invidious.
There was also the strong individualism
of Government departments, many of
which had their own building pro'
gramme, and in pre'war days there
was little co'ordination of these
various programmes.
80,000 Separate Firms.
The peculiar nature of the building
industry had also to be reckoned with.
Of all the great industries it is urn
doubtedly the least organised and
stable, consisting as it does of up-
wards of 80,000 separate firms of
greatly varying capacity covering all
spheres of building activity and de'
pending, to a large extent, on urn
skilled labour.
It is, therefore, not altogether sur-
prising that it required five years of
trial and error before effective control
of the building programme was
achieved in 1942, by which time a
substantial part of the programme had
already been carried out.
A fact of great importance in the
development of the wartime building
effort was the creation of the Ministry
of Works, which eventually assumed
responsibility for co-ordinating the
whole of the building programme,
both civil and military, and included
amongst its many activities the con-
of materials and labour, in which
the Sixth Floor Organisation” play-
ed a prominent part. This organisa-
tion at maturity comprised a series of
directorates and divisions each respon-
se to the Director-General and
charged with the task of achieving
proper balance of supply and demand,
fair distribution of all materials and
labour, and of ensuring that technical
staffs of the Ministry and other Gov-
ernment dej artments were given all
information requisite to the most
economical and efficient use of all
budding materials. This latter aspect
of the Organisation’s work entailed
much research and the appointment of
scientists, engineers and architects of
the highest reputation, and for some
years during and immediately follow'
ing the war the Ministry took the
lead in laying down acceptable stan-
dards of design and construction and
the carrying out and collation of re'
search.
£2,250,000,000 Work Executed.
An idea of the prodigious output of
the building industry can be gathered
from the figures quoted (from the
Statistical Digest of the war which
show that the cost of building
work from 1940 to 1945 totalled
£2,250,000,000. Nevertheless, the
author considers it fair to estimate
that from 1938 to 1947 the produc'
live efficiency of the building industry
declined by about one'third, but Mr.
Kohan is at pains to make it clear
that he is in no doubt as to the value
of the war effort of the building in'
dustry, more particularly in the period
1940 onwards, and will not be a party
to irresponsible criticism.
There are occasionally public ex'
pressions of dissatisfaction at the pro'
ductivity of the building operative,
but the public does not really under'
stand what is happening. . . . No in'
dustry has ever been faced with such
a variety of tasks as has the building
industry during the war. Our men
have responded to every change of
practice within the industry. And
again, men moved in their thousands
from place to place. Little prepara'
tion was made for their reception, and
welfare arrangements were non ' exis'
tent. The accommodation for receiv'
ing the men was totally inadequate:
men tramped miles and miles hope'
lessly seeking accommodation.
Whatever might be the ultimate
statistical assessment of the part play-
ed by the building industry in the
war effort, in terms of endeavour the
building workers’ contribution to vie'
tory stands high in the record of
achievement. Too little has perhaps
yet been said of the vast enterprise of
the rank and file of the building in'
dustry in the aid it gave to the armed
forces.

ROTTERDAM—THE LARGEST
SEAPORT OF THE CONTINENT
Expansion After Rehabilitation.
The busy picture that the harbour of
Rotterdam presents to'day and the
scene of desolation at the end of the
war in 1945 is very striking. At that
time a large proportion of the harbour
equipment had disappeared (the Ger'
mans tipped the cranes into the
water), but now the stir and bustle
which have characrerised the pore of
Rotterdam from time immemorial again
holds sway.
Unceasing activity prevails in the
shipyards and in the twenty dry'docks.
Besides building new vessels for com'
nanies in all parts of the world, the
Rotterdam shipbuilding industry at'
tends to innumerable repairs to ves'
sels, thirteen loading bridges and 255
shore cranes are hard at work along
the twelve miles of quays for the
oceangoing vessels, while upstream —-
where a considerable share of the car-
"oes entering and leaving the port of
Rotterdam is handled —85 floating
cranes and 26 floating grain elevators
are ceaselessly busy with the loading,
unloading and transhipment of goods.
War Damage Made Good.
The war damage has been more
than made good. To mention one
important example: The tanks in the
petroleum docks can hold nearly
2,000,000 tons of oil, while an iim
nortant induslry has grown up there
which attends to the refining and fur-
her processing of the crude oil im'
ported, and only recently a new crack'
plant increased the capacity of the
existing installations.
Factories for the manufacture of
scan, of base materials for the plastics
industry and of a large number of
other products present a picture in the
Rotterdam petroleum docks which is
hardly to be equalled in any other

port. Indeed, with its handling of
11,500,000 tons in 1951—as against
2.000. tons in 1936 Rotterdam
is the largest petroleum harbour on
he mainland of Europe.
How has all this, and a great deal
'lore, been brought about in these few
years?
Without allowing time for com-
plaint, Rotterdam set to work again
immediately after the war, and civic
authorities and officials, trade and in-
dustry, shipowners and seamen, the
labourers on the quays and in the
harbour exerted themselves to regain
for Rotterdam its old renown.
An International Harbour.
And they succeeded! Rotterdam is
once more the largest seaport on the
continent of Europe.
It is true that in 1951 the seaborne
trade —estimated at 37,000,000 tons —
was still below that of the record year
1938 42,000,000 tons but it was
nevertheless greater than that of any
other port on the Continnent.
Rotterdam is indeed an international
harbour. In 1951, 13,709 ocean-
going vessels, with a carrying capacity
of 23.2 million nett register tons, en-
tered the port. Of this number, 8672
vessels, with a carrying capacity of
17.6 million nett register tons, sailed
under foreign flags, representing no
fewer than 37 different nationalities.
[Sydney Harbour's record year was
1937-38, when 7755 ships entered
and 20,326,104 tons of cargo were
handled.]
Bulk and General Cargo.
Though Rotterdam is known first
and foremost as a harbour for bulk
cargoes, such as mineral oils, coal,
ores, grain, etc., the general cargoes
constitute no less than a good one-
fifth of the total seaborne trade, viz.,
in 1951 7,500,000 tons of the
37.000. tons referred to above.
This is quite understandable when it
is borne in mind that Rotterdam is
the principal harbour for the national
imports and exports of the Nether-
lands. In addition, Rotterdam is an
extremely important harbour for the
international and inter - continental
lines, and some 200 regular lines,
many of them with several sailings per
vmonth, connect Rotterdam with prac-
tically every part of the world.
The Rotterdam Ocean-going
Fleet.
As an old and important world
harbour, Rotterdam has at its disposal
a large sea-going fleet registered in
this port ,and the volume of shipping
for which Rotterdam is the home port
can be estimated at 2,000,000 nett
register tons.
The Rotterdam fleet is not restrict-
ed to the transport of goods. Not
only are cargo vessels being increas-

ingly provided with good passenger
accommodation, but the Rotterdam
shipping companies also play a lead-
ing p ar t in the passenger trade itself.
Companies such as the Royal Dutch
Llovd and the Holland America Line,
to name only two of the principal
ones, are known all over the world.
Their flagships, the “Willem Ruys”
and the “New Amsterdam,” are rep-
resentative of Rotterdam’s fleet of
passenger vessels.
Sea and Rhine Harbour.
Rotterdam has two fronts. One is
towards the North Sea, the other to-
wards the busiest European river, the
Rhine.
Rotterdam is connected with the
North Sea, and thereby with the
whole overseas world, by the nineteen
mile long New Waterway. At ebb
tide this connection is thirty-six feet
deep, at high tide normally five and
a half feet more. This Rhine estuary
has neither locks nor bridges, so that
it is possible for vessels coming from
sea to reach their berths in the har-
bour within an hour and a half. The
Rotterdam docks are not hampered
with locks either and are so large that
they impose no limits on the size of
the vessels entering them. One of
these docks, the Waalhaven, with its
water area of 740 acres, is the largest
sinple dock in the world. In the
Rhine, which is not hampered with
locks either, Rotterdam has a connec-
tion with the economically most high-
ly developed areas of the Continent.
The open river, which is navigable
throughout the year, gives access to
the extensive hinterland, which in-
cludes Western Germany, Eastern
France. Switzerland, Austria, and the
other Danube States. The latter will
be still easier to reach from Rotterdam
as soon as the new connection by
between the Main and the
Danube is completed.
In the first nine months of 1951
upwards of 14,000,000 tons of goods
were landed and despatched with these
inland navigation vessels.
Finally, all the quays, wharves and
storage warehouses in the harbour
area are connected up with the inter-
national rail and road routes, while a
special customs system makes Rotter-
dam “freer than a free port.”
Concentration
and Rationalisation.
Since 1949 the war damage to
Rotterdam has ceased to have any
nractical significance. In that year the
rehabilitation stage was completed and
that of deliberate expansion was com*
menced. This implies that the har-
bour has not only been rejuvenated
and renewed, but also extended and

rationalised. The right bank of the
river has now been almost entirely
reserved for the handling of general
cargo, while the bulk cargoes are dealt
with largely on the left bank. Within
the framework of this reorganisation
the operations in the Waalhaven are
mainly concerned with the loading
and unloading of ore and coal, those
in the Maashaven with grain, etc.
The rational organisation, the up-
to-date equipment, the ability and ex-
perience of the dockers are a guaran-
tee to those who make use of the
harbour that ships and cargoes will be
dealt with safely and expeditiously.
Apart from all technical and econo-
mic efficiency, the expansion of the
harbour depends after all in the first
place on the confidence of the Rotter-
dammers in the future of the port.
Thus even though the rank of
“Largest harbour of the Continent”
has once more been attained, Rotter-
dam is going ahead with energy and
enterprise which will ensure the fulfil-
ment of the city’s motto “Stronger
through Struggle.”

AUSTRALIA’S PRIZE CATTLE
TRAVEL BY AIR.
Time and Condition Saved.
In 1948 an Australian breeder made
headlines by sending three cattle to
the Royal Easter Show at Sydney in a
Dakota aircraft of Australian National
Airways. To'day, A.N.A., using
“Bristol” Freighters, has made air
transport of nedigree stock almost a
commonplace.
That first flight was soon followed
by others, and in 1949 A.N.A. made
its first cattle flights from Tasmania
to the mainland. Until then, transport
of Tasmanian stud stock had been a
difficult business, for sea transport
caused a severe loss of conditions.
Because of the breeders’ interest,
A.N.A. had special equipment design-
ed in 1951 for use with the “Bristol”
aircraft. The pens are, in effect, built
around the cattle. The beasts are led
into the hold and placed three abreast,
facing forward with longitudinal sec-
tions between them. Cross-sections,
secured to the fuselage wall by bayonet
secured to the fuselage wall by
bayonet-type clips and by feet fitting
into the floor, are placed across the
hold, providing pens for six to nine
cattle.
One of the great advantages of the
“Bristol” is that trucks can be backed
right up to those wide-nose doors and
cattle transferred without need of lead'
in? them to ground level first.
In August, 1951, a Freighter set up
a new livestock record for A.N.A. by
carrying eight bulls, weighing between
1000 and 1500 lb. each, to Queens-
land’s Royal Show. Twenty-three
cattle travelled from Victorian studs to
Brisbane for the Show. More than
£lOOO was paid to air-freight a total
of twenty-three head, but the money
spent paid dividends in stock con-
dition.”
A.N.A. have also developed the use
of air transport to take stud cattle to
remote stations in the outback. One
instance would have involved an over-
land journey of more than 1200 miles
and a time that would have been hard
to calculate. An Air Beef Freighter
cut the distance to 366 miles and the
time to well under three hours. After-
wards the manager of the cattle station
said that the cost of £lB per head was
actually less than it would have cost
to send the cattle overland.

UNUSUAL PLAN SITING.
It seems to be almost Traditional to plan our house and cottages with the sides parallel with the boundaries of
the block of land. Architects often envy their American colleagues when studying some of the beautiful homes
illustrated in the American fournals in that there always seems so much space available with not a fence to be
see and tha ţhere is complete freedom in Pacing the house on the site. It is realised, of course that these
are only the homes of the wealthy and that for small houses the same problems obtain as for ourselves Our
desing in the upper lert plan has tried to depart from this stereotyped approach and has placed the house at an
angle with the alignment. Bottom left is a useful one-bedroom plan, while the other two each have two bedrooms.
