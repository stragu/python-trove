Away back in 1912
"United" Paint was first manufac-
tured under this brand at Port Adelaide.
Ever since that date the "United" brand has stood for
every good guality that is required in paint. Its popularity with
both trade and consumer is directly due to the "United" policy
which simply is. The best materials and the best manufacturing
methods." "Un ted" is truly the "Pre-tested" Paint. That is why
this paint has, over four decades, won a reputation surely
befitting its position as a foundation member of Australia's Paint
Industry!

Lysaght Ztncanneal is
an outstanding Lysaght

the protective zinc coating
to the base metal a zinc-iron
alloy is formed that has re-
markable rust-resisting proper-
ties that adds extensively to the
life span of the finished sheet.
For roofing and walling particularly in coastal areas where
sea air can be highly corrosive specify and use Lysaght
Zincanneal! Fully approved for water catchment, its protective
zinc coating is actually annealed to the steel sheet, making
it highly rust resistant and less liable to flake, chip or peel
when used for working up purposes. Takes paint, too,

Air Line Terminals get that smart
ultra-modern look at little cost—with
C.S.R. BUILDING MATERIALS
Next time you travel by air look
around you in the Air Terminals.
Whether you travel by A.N.A. or
T.A.A. you’ll see the latest ideas
in building materials —low cost
building materials put to the
most modern use. At Eagle Farm
(A.N.A.), Cane-ite is used for
the walls—and this is where it’s
really brought home to you that
Cane-ite insulates as well as
decorates. Even in a Brisbane
summer the atmosphere is cool
inside this terminal because of
the Cane-ite walls which are
beautifully decorated with murals.
600 miles away in Sydney you
will see the smartness of C.S.R.
Floor Tiles in the T.A.A. termi-
nal. Thousands of air travellers
walk backwards and forwards
over this floor almost every hour
hour of the day. Yet the tiles
always look fresh and gleaming
it takes only one polisher
three-quarters of an hour in the
small hours of the morning to
keep them looking so smart.
Then back at Eagle Farm
again look up at the Cane-ite
Acousti-Tile Ceiling in the dining
room which absorbs two-thirds of
all noise. That explains why,
with all the noise of arriving and
departing planes and buses and
messages over the public address
system, there is still an atmos-
phere of calm.
All modern airport terminals
give you the impression of being
surrounded by efficiency and
streamlined comfort. You can
introduce this same efficiency,
smartness and insulated comfort
into your own business, factory
premises or home. For lower
tenders always ask for quotations
which include C.S.R. Building
Materials.
Dine at Eagle Farm and you dine in
calm, restful quiet, with most of the busy
airport's noisiness EXCLUDED. That's
because the Cane-ite Acousti-Tile ceilina
absorbs two-thirds of all noise.
Walk' into the Sydney A.N.A. City
Terminal and the smartness of C.S.R.
floor tiles takes your eye. Even after the
busiest day this floor looks fresh and
smiling. Requires minimum attention.

test at the right! It will prove to you
all doubt that Masonite Tempered
Presdwood is 100% satisfactory for external
building applications. Not only is Tempered
Presdwood strongly moisture-resistant—it is far
more adaptable to your ideas of construction and
finish than any other board. You can bend Masonite,
punch it, saw it, plane it. Masonite is hard, smooth and
trainless, with great structural strength and dimen-
ional stability. It takes and holds any applied finish.
BEFORE
Take a piece of
Masonite Tempered
Presdwood (write
for a sample if you
wish). Leave it in
a container of water
for as many days—or
months —or years—
as you like. Remove
the Tempered Presd-

and check it against
a dry sample. You
will find tint size,

pletely unaffected b>

save hours on
every wiring installation!
Speed Wire is new—and news! Specially
developed and designed to cut down
electrical installation time, this new-
type semi-divided rubber-sheathed cable
avoids the need for removing the sheath
. . . eliminates taping and sleeving of
cores . . . and enables full continuity of
tough rubber sheathing right up to the
point of terminal entry. This means
hours saved on every wiring job . . . and
a neater, faster, better installation
both electrically and mechanically! No
restrictions on supplies, so plan now to
use Speed Wire on all your future wiring
contracts!
Note tough
rubber sheathing
that only needs
a pull to divide
easily and
avoids need for

allows quick

nection with full

Preparing old-type cables for terminal connections takes up time . . . and time
means money these days! Speed Wire has been specially designed to
overcome this problem because it enables the cable to be run right up to
the point of entry without removing the sheathing, and avoids taping or
sleeving of cores! Independent tests have proved that hours of time can
be saved by electricians using Speed Wire!

SKYLINE OF A CITY
THE TOWERS AND SPIRES OF SYDNEY.
The skyline of a town and city has altered greatly
over the centuries. In feudal times a few humble cot-
tages clustered at the feet of the great castle; in mediaeval
days it was the cathedral that dominated the scene as
the houses of the people gathered for protection at the
feet of the powerful churchmen-soldiers of the period.
As trade and commerce developed, the towns gained in
importance and grew in size and their skyline was punc-
tuated by the spires of churches and the towers of com-
mercialism. As the buildings grew in size the church
steeples were engulfed, as is so strikingly seen in the
well-known view of Trinity Church surrounded by the
commercial canyons of Wall Street in New York.
Sydney, with its height limit of 150 ft. for the habitable
sections of a building, is still able to enjoy a skyline of
character and, viewed from the Harbour, it presents a
fascinating picture of spires, towers, radio masts and
massive tower-like buildings. We illustrate two well-
known landmarks.
THE T. & G. TOWER, SYDNEY.
The tower that dominates the T. & G.
Building at the corner of Park and Eliz
abeth Streets, Sydney, is a conspicuous
landmark, particularly approaching the
city from William Street.

An interesting Reconstruction Project
CONRICK TOMALIN PTY. LTD.,
YORK STREET, SYDNEY.
A REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION.
Robertson Marks, architects,
are to be congratulated upon the
remarkable transformation that
they have effected in the recon'
struction of old premises at 36
York Street, Sydney.
The original building when
built one would assume before
the turn of the century, must
have been a source of great pride
to its Victorian progeniters for
it is difficult to imagine a more
elaborate facade which embraced
in addition to the gamut of em
tablatures, consoles, swags of
fruit, cherubs (in toto and heads
only), curved headed windows,
square headed ones of incredible
narrowness, the piece de resist'
ance being a cantilever semi'dr'
cular oriel window at first floor
level wherein no doubt the stately
head of the firm could stand and
sweep the street in both direc'
tions with a fearsome eye to see
if any of his minions should be
so remiss in their duty to be a
few seconds late. In spite of all
this external ornamental beauty,
which certainly did its plastering
craftsmen credit, it was internally
badly planned and wretchedly
lit, a factor that was exaggerated
by the fact that the frontage was
only 25ft. in width and the site
102 ft. deep (see plan on p. 22).
The old building had brick
bearing walls and timber floors
and consisted of basement, ground
and three upper floors, the fourth
floor being within a mansard roof.
The Problem.
The problem with which the
architects were confronted was to
alter the building to provide max'
mum light, space and facilities
for storage, display and handling
of goods by owners, importers and
wholesalers of soft goods, furnish'
ings and floor coverings.
After careful investigation and
analysis it was decided to con'
struct a reinforced concrete frame
within the original brick walls, to

Dry Rot is British
Menace
Before the war dry rot cost Brit'
ain £1,000,000 a year. Today it
costs £20,000,000 a year, and the stag'
gering increase may continue unless
drastic steps are taken to check its
spread.
The dry rot which menaces the his-
toric homes and buildings is of almost
epidemic proportions. This “cancer
of houses and buildings,” as it has
been called, can often be traced to in'
effectual firsUaid repairs during the
war years. Furniture was one of the
commonest methods by which dry rot
was conveyed from building to build'
ing, for during the war furniture was
often stored in unsuitable places.
Few people realise that every case
of dry rot is as dangerous a source
of infection to existing and new build'
ings as a field infested with foot and
mouth disease is to neighbouring
herds. There is practically no limit
to the distance infecting spores can
be carried.
The various fungi which cause dry
rot consist of branching hollow,
thread'like tubes which grow in all
kinds of weird shapes. Often the
tubes weave themselves into bodies
which assume forms varying from
that of a mushroom to that of a pan'
cake.
Gravest of all kinds of dry rot
fungi grow on the surface of wood
and resemble strawberry plants which
creep over the wood, sending out
shoots at intervals.
It has been found that when the
moisture content of timber is below
20 per cent., dry rot cannot develop.
The moisture content in a welhcon'
structed building should never be
more than 18 per cent, even on the
most humid day.
Dry rot often starts beneath wood'
en floors, behind skirting boards,
where it sometimes goes on for years
before detection. It has been known
to spread from a house cellar to the
attic.
Mass Building of
Homes Galled
“Tragic”
Opinion in Holland.
Fifty years ago the Netherlands
Parliament adopted the Housing. Act.
At a meeting held under the auspices
of the Netherlands Institute for Hous'
ing and Town Building, it was stated
that mass building, necessary after the
war, had put the social task of the
Housing Act in second place, as for
economic reasons improvement of the
quality of the houses had to be re'
stricted. “It is deplorable and tragic,”
stated one speaker, “that more than
100,000 houses have had to be built
in a very short time, whilst economic
reasons prevented our building them
as we should have liked. It is neces'
sary that everything possible should
be done to satisfy the higher demands
for more modern and better homes.”
Footnote: The building of 24,100
houses during the first half of 1952,
968 of them duplex, provided accorm
modation for 25,068 families in the
Netherlands. Altogether, 220,473
houses, of which 11,983 were duplex,
were built between Liberation Day in
May, 1945, and 30th June, 1952, thus
accommodating 232,456 families.
ELECTRICAL UNITS.
The watt is the unit expressing
electrical power as horsepower (h.p.)
represents power in mechanics, it is
equal to the product of the volts (pres-
sure) times amperes frate of flow).
Thus, 2 volts times 2 amperes would
give in a direct current circuit 4 watts.
Electrical energy is sold at so much
per watt hour, or more generally at
a given amount per kilowatt hour— —
which means 1000 watt hours. This
may represent 1 watt for 1000 hours
or 1000 watts for 1 hour. 746 watts
are equal to one horsepower, or in'
versely 1 kilowatt (kW.) is equal to
about I'l/3 horsepower.
(The horsepower represents the
power required to lift a weight of
33,000 pounds 1 foot in 1 minute, or
550 pounds 1 foot in 1 second.)
The ohm is the unit of electrical
resistance and represents the physical
property of a conductor which offers
a resistance to the flow of electricity,
permitting just 1 ampers to flow at 1
volt of pressure.

DEVELOPMENT IN QUEEN STREET
BRISBANE’S MAIN STREET GLAMOURISED.
By F. O. NIXON
EDMENTS LTD.,
Queen Street.
The rigorous controls over new
building construction of any descrip'
tion other than houses were relaxed- —
prior to the recent decontrolling of all
restrictions —in quite a number of in'
stances to permit the remodelling of
outmoded business establishments. In
some cases, the remodelling involved
the use of more building artisans and
more materials than would be employ'
ed in the rebuilding de novo, after
the complete demolition of the old
structure.
Such an instance can be said to
apply to the “remodelling” of the
Queen Street building for Edments
Limited by Architects Messrs. Ford,
Hutton £s? Newell, Brisbane.
Originally known as Powers Build'
ing, in the business heart of Queen
Street, a warehouse built 75 years ago,
with a collection of poor'dass shops
and offices on its three floors and
basement, the new structure, of which
the ornate frontage is shown here, is
now pleasing building which does
credit to not only the ability of the
Architects and Builders, but to their
forbearance, or rather to their em
durance, over a long building pro'
gramme of two years of disrupted
business of numerous tenants in a
daily changing scene.
Probably a demolition and a new
building could have been built in less
time, at a lesser cost, if the veto on
new warehouses had not to be ap'
peased. Beginning with a stone'walled
basement, the remainder of the walls
are of brick; the floors are of timber,
with main timber beam down the
centre of the building supported on
trussed ironbark columns. The lift,
which was originally 20ft. back from
the front alignment and in the centre
of the building, has been moved.
Main stairs are in front of the lift
A new cantilever awning replaces
the original post and rafter one. In
the main, the remodelling entailed the
clearing from the basement and
ground floor of all walls, the lift and
existing stairs to the first floor.
New brick stairs and liftwell built
on right'hand side of building.
Stairs are of reinforced concrete
and stair well sheeted with terrazzo
slabs made and fixed by P. J. Lowther
6? Son Pty. Ltd., Brisbane.
Lift made by Otis Elevator Co. Pty.

Co., Melbourne.
Air'conditioning of basement and
ground floor by Carrier Air Com
ditioning Co. Floor coverings in
G.S.R. Asphalt tiles. At the back of
the first floor is a mezzanine floor to
accommodate the office staff.
Ground floor ceiling is fibrous plas'
ter.
The combination of fluorescent and
incandescent lighting is most efficient
in helping to create the transformation
of a building that belonged to last
century to one embodying the best in
modernity a credit to all concerned,
the builders being Summers and
Unthank.

New Shop Front and Awning
for Queen Street Premises.
The works carried out comprise re-
construction of shop windows and

frontage of the property, involving
foundations sunk 35ft. below street
level for future development and de'
molition of old windows installed
about twenty years ago, together with
false fronts installed for A.R.P. pur*
poses during the early war years.
The fronts have struck a simple and
dignified modern note in architectural

gone a remodelling entailing reinforced
concrete columns, beams and floor
built in place of those existing, and
the new floor was ramped and graded
to eliminate steps from Queen Street
footpath.
Entrance floor is in buff terrazzo,
divided with brass strips, and has inset
carborundum strips. The name
“Woolworths” is inserted in two places
in the floor, the terrazzo forming the
letters being red outlined with brass.
Piers and stallboards are covered
with polished terrazzo buff colour.
Exposed woodwork of shopfront is
Queensland Maple, French polished
natural colour.
Entrance doors are side sliding.
Column in centre of entrance has a
polished terrazzo base matching stall'
boards, and above this is encased in
satin finish stainless steel circular in
shape.
Tophamper is of plate'glass, sand'
blastered and coloured, and letters on
this are cast aluminium finished with
gold leaf.
Lighting of show windows is by hot
cathode Fluorescent tubes and incan'
descent lamps in “Gecoray” reflectors.
This long expanse of bright light'
ing from street to street is very strik'

FINNEY ISLES LTD.
The large building built for the
“Courier” newspaper some years ago,
and purchased by Finney Isles & Co.
Ltd. as an additional retail warehouse,
has undergone considerable remodel'
ling, as will be seen in the picture of
the Queen Street and Edward Street
frontages.
The ground floor of the “Courier
Building comprised a number of small
shops, and extensive alterations have
since been carried out to make it a
most modern store.
On the extreme right'hand end of
the Queen Street frontage is a milk
bar. It is ultramodern in having
marble and gold bar front, behind
which is a black bar treated with mir'
rors and metal menus. The ceiling
has been painted black and incandes'
cent lighting dropped from it. The
floor of this section has Semtex Tiles
laid by Dunlop Rubber Co. in a most
attractive colour scheme.
The shop front windows are the
modern pictureTrame type, with a
Travertine mould approximately 3in.
wide and extending approximately
inches over the main line completely
around the display windows. Here the
full shop floor is visible, there being
no window backs to these windows.
The stalls and top hamper are all
treated in Travertine.
Each entrance has been treated with
three Travertine moulds running up
both sides and across the vestibule
ceiling. Provision has been made for
an egg crate lighting to be installed
in the ceiling.
There are four doors to each em
trance. Door frames are out of 4in. x
3in. Maple and the doors framed in
Maple and glazed with £in. plate glass.
Doors are furnished with modern
type chrome-plated brass door pulls
and kick plates. The entrance floors
have also been treated with Semtex
Tiles.
*Over three entrances appears the
name FINNEY ISLES 6? CO. LTD.
in an Bin. cast letter C.P. on brass
with a Torquoise Blue line throughout.
Over the entrance to the milk bar the
words MILK BAR have been cut out
of Masonite in a script and lacquered
Torquoise Blue also.
Below this floor, accessible from
both Queen and Edward Streets, is a
most modern and efficiently run food
hall in the form of a Cafetaria, Snack
Bar. Cake Section and Cut Luncheon
Service. All panelling, display case
counters and bar have been treated in
bleached Maple and polished a golden
colour.

Queer Facts
Some people will sign anything.
Recently, as a test, representatives of
a New jersey (U.S.A.) newspaper
asked 99 people to sign' a petition.
Thirty'three did so without noticing
that it asked that the mayor and city
council “be shot at sunrise on any
Tuesday morning in any leap year.”
A Paris publisher has begun to
print books that can be read in the
dark. He uses luminous ink on black
paper, and claims that the result is
“perfect visibility and no eyestrain. ’’
An estimate of £lOO was submitted
by a contractor in Virginia, U.S.A.,
for removing the roof of his cottage
porch and stacking the wood in the
garden. But before the work could
be started a storm blew up. The
roof was lifted right off the cottage
porch and the wood, though not neat'
ly piled, landed in the exact spot to
which the contractor had offered to
take it.
Pedestrians—don’t walk yourselves
to death,” is a safety slogan display'
ed on Merthvr'Tydfil (U.K.) buses.
Another safety slogan—Better to be
a patient pedestrian than a pedestrian
patient.
There are 60,000 men and women
in Britain—undischarged bankrupts—
who break the law if they carry more

BEHR-MANNING (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD.
NYRANG STREET, LIDCOMBE, SYDNEY.
Important Extensions Opened.
When the large extension to the
Behr'Manning (Australia) Pty. Ltd.
factory at Lidcombe (N.S.W.) was
officially opened by the Hon. W. H.
Spooner, M.M., Minister for National
Development, on Ist October, 1952,
it set in motion the only plant in the
Southern Hemisphere for the manu'
facture of coated abrasives from raw
materials to the finished article.
At the mere press of a button
Senator Spooner started in motion the
huge machine which, the only one of
its kind in the Southern Hemisphere,
is capable of turning out all the coat'
ed abrasives Australia needs, plus a
surplus for export.
American Capital.
Senator Spooner said: “This enter'
prise represents an investment in build'
ings and plant of about £500,000.
It is an investment made by American
manufacturing interests and as such
presents a typical example of the way
in which commercial concerns from
the United States are showing them'
selves ready to invest in Australia s
future.
“Never before in Australia’s history
have such large amounts of American
capital been committed for investment
in this country as in the past fifteen
months.
“Since June, 1951, new investments
totalling nearly £5O million have been
announced by American companies
either extending their present interests
in Australia or setting up entirely new
enterprises.”
In the tour of inspection that fob
low the official opening each guest
was presented with a complimentary
roll of the company’s cellulose “Bear
Tape” and a packet of emery boards,
which was perhaps the only personal
momento that could be devised to
symbolise the numerous grades of
abrasives which this vast undertaking
will produce.
Among the guests entertained by
Mr. H. C. Campfield and directors of
Behr'Manning were: Hon. J. J. Shiels,
Deputy'Director, Ministry of National
Development; Colonel J. Knight,
A.D.0.5., Eastern Command Head'
quarters; ' Mr. H. R. Hungerford,
American Consulate; Commander C.
H. T. Palmer, Charles Palmer ST Co.,
Auckland, N.Z.; Mr. C. R. Hall,
Chamber of Manufacturers; Mr. E. T.
Pysden, Australian Institute of Man'
agement; Professor T. P. Baxter,
0.8. E., N.S.W. University of Tech'
nology; Mr. W. R. Miller; Mr. J. H.
Stephenson; Mr. D. Hunt, Riddell
C., N.Z.; and Aid. F. Chadwick,
Mayor of Auburn.
Some fifty distributors of Behr'
Manning products in all States of
Australia and New Zealand followed
the official onening by a two'day con'
ference held at the Oceanic Hotel,
Coogee.
First Established
During War.
This company was first established
in Australia during the war period,
when, as Australian Durex Products
Pty. Ltd., it was invited by the
Director'General of Munitions, Mr.
Essington Lewis, to market tropic'
proofing materials and moisture'
resistant adhesive tapes for the pro'
tection of stores and equipment so
urgently ijeeded in the Pacific War
Zone, and also to supply coated
abrasives which, at that time, were in
World-Wide short supply.
The present site of six and a'half
acres was secured at Lidcombe, and
from the factory thereon erected came
the supplies until, at war’s end, the
urgent need of proofing materials
abated. The company then developed
the market for their pressure'sensitive
tapes, adhesives and “underkote” dur*
ing the time they were preparing for
building extensions and installing of
the most modern machinery for the
complete manufacture of coated abra'
sives for the first time in Australia.
Up to the present all coated abra'
sives, so essential to every phase of
industry, have had to be imported,
mainly from dollar countries, in finish'
ed form or semi'finished “jumbos”
and cut to the required sizes here.
The manufacturing of this all' impor'
tant commodity in Australia will now
mean a saving of thousands of dob
lars; moreover, the Lidcombe plant
will be capable of producing sufficient
supplies for export.
With the disbanding of the Durex
Corporation of America in 195051,
the Australian unit was taken over by
Behr'Mannin? Corporation, a division
of the Nortom Company of America.
Together, these concerns are the
world’s largest manufacturers of
grinding wheels, abrasive grains and
coated abrasives. They are also the
holders of several very valuable patents
which are available under licence to
the Australian company, as are also
the facilities of their vast research
laboratories in Worcester, Mass., and
Troy, N.Y.
120,000 Square Feet
of Floor Area.
The additions to the factory bring
the total floor area to 120,000 square
feet and cover three floor levels to
house the highly technical machinery
and ovens. Patterned on that used by
the parent company, some components
of the machines were secured from
the United States, some from the
United Kingdom, but most of them
were made in Australia from the
American design and were assembled
and installed by the company’s own
engineering department under Chief
Engineer Mr. George McCarthy, who
spent some months of study in the
American plant.
Every facility and co'operation has
been extended by the Commonwealth
Government to encourage this indus'
try, so valuable to the furtherance of
BEHR-MANNING (AUST.) PTY. LTD.

Australian production and so vital in
the event of any national emergency,
when such materials would be difficult
to procure on world markets, let alone
import.
The Construction.
Construction of the extension is
steel-framed, with reinforced concrete
floors and brick walls. Flat concrete
roofs completely cover the first four
bays on the north, the remainder of
the roof being of saw-tooth construc-
tion covered with corrugated asbestos
cement. More than 30,000 cubic yards
of clay and shale were excavated for
the construction of the 32,000 sq. ft.
basement and the future Administra-
tive Building.
The west wall of the factory is
temporary (timber - framed, asbestos
cement-sheeted) to allow for future
extensions. As in the original build-
ing, columns are set out to form
panels 29ft. x 20ft., and to ensure
dry conditions at all times there is an
extensive system of seepage and storm-
water drains under and about the
buildings. A large lift of 11,200 lb.
capacity serves the- three floors. Above
the lift motor room within the tower
is a 10,000-gallon sprinkler storage
tank. Owing to the highly inflam-
mable nature of some of the materials
used, the whole of the factory, in-
cluding loading docks, is sprinklered,
and in addition certain areas are
equipped with an automatic CO2 Gas
system for added safety, as fire pre-
cautions are of major importance.

LONDON TUNNEL LIGHTING.
Difficulties Overcome.
When Blackwall Tunnel, London,
was constructed in 1897, the electric
lighting was designed for slow-moving
horse traffic. Electricity came from a
small power station situated at the
tunnel.
With the advent of motor traffic, in
creases in lighting and the installation
of power-driven ventilating equipment
made it necessary to change over to
the public electricity supply. The last
important revision of lighting was
made in 1930.
When horse-drawn vehicles were
wholly banned in 1939, the increased
average speed of traffic made better
illumination necessary. Experiments
were made with different types of
lighting, with the result that the L.C.C.
decided to completely relight the tun-
nel at an estimated cost of £30,000.
The first section, at the Poplar end, is
now completed.
Difficulties.
Tunnel lighting presents certain dif-
ficulties not met with in street illu-
mination. Drivers plunging from
bright sunshine to comparative gloom
find their eyes require a few seconds
to adopt themselves visually.
It was not necessary to illuminate
the tunnel to daylight intensity, but
the new lighting has been arranged so
that it is more intense at the entrance
and tapers off gradually.
A further difficulty in a narrow tun'
nel in continuous use is the matter of
maintenance. The existing lights are
in the crown of the tunnel and require
the use of a tower waggon in the
centre of the road. This can only be
done at night, and even so causes
some interruption of traffic.
The new lights are now being
placed at the sides of the tunnel at a
height which gives accessibility, effec-
tive lighting and clearance between the
posts and passing vehicles. In this
lowered position it was important to
see that no glare fell in the eyes of
the drivers.
Special Fitting.
To meet these conditions the L.C.C.
Chief Engineer’s Department designed
a special lighting fitting, and 120 of
these have been installed at the Poplar
end of the tunnel. Each contains an
80-watt fluorescent tube together with
a set of louvres and its control ap-
paratus. Although not open to the
sky, they have to be waterproofed as
the tunnel is hosed regularly. They
are mounted on the tunnel walls, Bft.
6in. above the pavement. Normal
spacing between fittings is 30ft., but
at the entrance they are considerably
closer to give the increased lighting
already mentioned.
Each lamp is connected to the mains
by a “fused” plug similar to that now
in wide use in the wiring of houses.
It is believed that this is the first time
that this system has been used for
such an extensive lighting installation.
Its use has resulted in considerable
simplification and economy in wiring.

An American Looks at Australian Architecture
and Thinks We Can Do Much Better
Dr. J. E, Burchard’s Survey
(with bracketed comments by Florence M. Taylor).
Dr. J. E. Burchard, who recently visited Australia, made a comprehensive
Report. This was published in “Architectural Record” in America. He has
a lot to say on what he saw and what he thinks. Generally speaking he show's
a keen insight into the Australian character and the Australian scene and, ah
though he realises the problems facing Australian architecture, he thinks we
can, and should, do better. He feels that its general mediocrity is to some extent
a product of the Australian attitude towards work and life.
We consider it extremely kind of Dr. Burchard to give so much thought
to our present failings.
We should, at all times, welcome sincere criticism of this nature that,
unless we are all dumb, should rouse us to activity and keep us from going
backward, which we are so rapidly doing through our great reluctance to work
long and hard, as may be evidenced by the pickle we are now in. There is a
dearth of buildings of all descriptions to house our city activities. Near'to-the'
city Flats should be built rapidly so that people may be within walking distance
of their jobs. Flats have as much claim upon our bricks and mortar as cottage
homes that sprawl all over the landscape and thereby clutter up transport, for
the homes are too far away and there are too many of them for the transport
that is available to service their needs.
Waiting long periods of time between the services, not only uses up our
energies and exhausts our patience but strap hanging in trams and buses for
sometimes an hour after a day’s work is not only inconsiderate but decidedly
cruel.
Then again we are slipping so rapidly that we are called upon to use
mediocre fittings in most things. The high grade qualities and countless var-
ieties which once carried the impress of the individual craftsman, who took
pride in his task, are no more. We want to aspire to higher and better things
—who wants to be standardised, to become niggardly and shabby as all our
buildings are so rapidly becoming through lack of a coat of paint.
We publish herewith extracts from Dr. Burchard’s comprehensive report:
The State of Architecture In Australia
REPORT BY DR. J. L. BURCHARD.
Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and the Social Sciences,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
who recently visited Australia to report on its Architecture.
You would think that Australians
who love their beautiful landscape
would try to bring it into their houses
through proper windows. But this
has not seemed important to most of
them.
[Dr. Burchard is not aware of the
effects from the glare of the Sun in
Australia. It will rot and destroy
curtains, fade and shabby tapestries
and carpets in a twinkling, whilst its
effects on the eyes will e’re long call
for optical treatment by a specialist.
Living within huge walls of glass such
as is the in-coming vogue in other
countries would not make for happy
or comfortable living in Australia.!
You would think too that they
would not like to affront this land'
scape with ugly red bricks, red or
blue corrugated iron, mottled roof tiles
or a stone with too busy veins. But
they do not seem to mind.
fDr. Burchard again is not aware
that the colour of the bricks in this
country records the fashion of the
day when they were built. The
colour simply dates the building. We
have had our periods of black or
dark blue bricks, cream bricks, yellow
bricks, chrome bricks, red bricks, and
lastly, textured bricks. The corrugat'
ed iron roof, in nine cases out of ten
provides the household water supply.
Mottled roof tiles in harmony with
their surroundings and the colour
treatment of the building, help to re'
lieve the monotony, when every one
uses the same toned tiles as they did
at Mosman 50 years ago, whilst our
stonework enriched with veining, like
our decorative timber and everything
else that Nature provides like flowers
in a garden, helps to beautify the sur-
roundings.]
It was not always thus. There are
some fine colonial homesteads in quiet'
er chroma. Australians had beautiful
brick when they built the town hall
of little Castlemaine, a gold'rush town
of the seventies. They cut handsome
timbers which could serve for some'
thing besides rafters, and have on oc'
casion (but not often of late).
(This is quite true. Even silky
oak and cedar have been used for
stair treads, when that kind of timber
chanced to be more accessible than
structural timbers.!
Anyone acquainted with the white
wood tradition of the Pacific Coast
wonders why there is not more fine
wooden architecture in Australia.
When one asks, he gets the wrong
answer. He may be told that there
is not enough timber and that it is too
hard to work or that it is too vulner'
able to termites. Neither rationalisa'
tion will hold water. The plain fact
is that for Australians, wood as a ma-
terial has less prestige than brick.
The wood may be beautiful, the brick
ugly, but the brick has the prestige
anyway. This is partly because of
cost, partly because of habit and Brit'

ish tradition, partly because a set of
restrictive fire laws stretch into the
suburbs. Anyway, what contemporary
Californian architects might have been
able to make with Australian woods
on Australian hills can be seen only
in the mind’s eye.
fDr. Burchard is right in mention'
ing the fire menace, but not restric'
tive laws. The fire hazard in the past
has been, and still is, enormous, for
we have no near-by water storage sys-
terns to draw upon to put out fires
excepting only in the metropolitan
areas surrounding the cities.]
If you show Australian architects
the General Motors Laboratories by
Saarinen, they will admire the build'
ing and then say, “But where could
we get bricks like that?” At first you
think this shows lack of imagination
and energy and think that you, an
American, would not long put up
with such nonsense. Then you begin
to come across the skeletons of people
who have tried to be expediters in
Australia. There is no doubt that a
heavy hand is laid by what is accept'
able, by what can be permitted in the
“crisis”, by legislation, and by custom.
Then Australian brickmakers and
bricklayers are simply unwilling to
make something different. All this
limits the materials which an Austra-
lian Architect can use.
[Evidently Dr. Burchard did not
pay a visit to Wunderlichs or some of
our other high-class brick-makers or he
would say that we can turn out any-
thing as fine as can be found in any
t'art of the world. I say this with-
out fear of contradiction for I have
travelled far and wide and often, with
my full sight and faculties about me
embracing structural requirements and
a love of the beautiful.]
But the basic ones are still there.
There is handsome stone. There is
plaster. There is steel. There are
brick and tile (and paint to cover
them with). It is not material re-
sources which hold Australian archi-
tecture back. There are more mater-
ials now in Australia than Australia s
best architect, Francis Greenway, had
to use in 1810.
Traditional English Influence.
It is significant that few people
sought Australia for any freedom save
economic. It is still more significant
that Australians rather like being Col-
onials. Fourth and fifth generation
Australians who have never left their
country still talk of England as
“home.” English ways of preparing
food, English tea habits, English tra-
ditions of building and of taste, or
lack of it, are clearly dominant. Aus-
tralian aesthetic, developed on an en-
tirely different terrain, in an entirely
different climate from that of the
homeland, remains a diluted version
of what is acceptable at home.
[Dr. Burchard could not pay us a
higher compliment than to say we
like our English Traditions, partial'
larly their charming homes in rural
settings and quaint gardens, and their
table manners, the nicest in the
world, and their home customs. De'
spite this great desideration we have
not developed English homes and
gardens as our model. Far from it.
One could traverse England from end
to end and never see a building like
those in outback Australia which were
all designed for our climate. These,
unhappily, include our roof catch'
ment of galvanised iron, which invar'
iably supplies the entire water require'
ments of the home.]
Australians are different from Eng'
lishmen who stayed at home. They
are more reckless, they are freer in
speech and dress and in a few ideas,
but intellectually are more conserva-
tive and far less imaginative. They
like to think of themselves as being
more like Americans and in a few re'
spects they are. American culture
has left some impress, too. But not
enough—and not the right impress.
It is our get'up'and'go they should
emulate, and not what we have done
by getting up and going.
The Australian Outlook.
There is an important way in
which Australians are different from
the other English'speaking peoples.
More than any of the rest of us they
like their outdoors and their surf'
drowned beaches and their glowing
sun.
[ln which they bask two full days
a week (Saturdays and Sundays) like
sluggards until the brain and body
becomes atrophied through want of
activity and the more delicate skins
develop skin cancer; but they would
rather waste time this way than work
for which they get paid handsomely.]
They want the physical goods of
modern technology but they are not
prepared to live in a grubby despera-
tion, in a rat race of effort, to achieve
these physical goods. Free time has
a value for them. They want to live
now and not hundreds of years hence;
themselves, not vicariously through
their grandchildren. So though they
have developed one of the highest
phsyical standards of living in the
world, they will pay only so much
for it. Then they go and play on the
beach. We call this lazy. It may be
sensible. But their conflict of desires
is real and unresolved. They are
neither Fijians nor Babbitts.
It is entirely possible that, for a
people like this, architecture is not
the most important thing in the world.
Buildings may take on less importance
from their point of view.
The general architectural taste of
Australia is best described by saying
it is lower-middle-class British suburb'
an. Up and down the city hills they
march, the little semi'detached villas,
each with a hedge clipped assiduously
into an extraordinary shape. En
masse they are plainly ugly but they
are never squalid. And hardly any'
one worries at all about the ugliness.
Mediterranean people, building a
Lisbon or a hill town of Italy, on an
equally disorganised principle, never
affront the landscape with their in'
dividualism. English'speaking peoples
usually fail the same test. The back'
sides of San Francisco or Chicago are
no more elegant, probably worse than
the backsides of Sydney or Mel'
bourne, but the big moments of the
American cities are finer; the range
from marvellous to awful is longer at
both ends. This is probably because
we have simmered in the melting pot
about which Australians are still du'
bious.
And when Australians set out dejib'
erately to make beauty they sometimes
come out very badly. Countryside
they understand. Every city has a
large botanical garden of magnificent
scale and effect. They are conscien'
tious and intelligent gardeners and,
abetted by a benign climate, grow
magnificent flowers. But when they
arrange them the results are likely
to be stiff and banal, like tfcose of a
late nineteenth'century British still'
life painting.
[Evidently Dr. Burchard has not
visited in the better class homes and
hotels where I have nearly always

seen flower-arrangement that would
eclipse anything met with in Japan
where flower-arrangement is a special
school study. Perhaps our flowers are
better and we can do more with them
than the Japanese, with their meagre
supply, but we definitely have the art
of flower arrangement—and a pen-
chant for beauty.]
Their recent buildings have come
off rather better when they have not
sought too hard to be fine.
The result of this is as follows.
There is no city in Australia which
would permit its streets to be so dese-
crated by hustings and neon as Pic-
cadilly Circus or that greatest honky-
tonk in the world, mid-town Broad-
way.
fit may be a child-like simplicity
on our part, but we like our coloured
lights and our jumping skysigns, as
though the city was illuminated for
some great festival. It is one of our
greatest joys to drive home at night
through William Street to see all the
coloured lights, and the car-display
windows inside illuminated with fluor-
escent lights. We would not like to
have this displaced with “dim-relig-
ious” lights and drabness.]
There is no city in Australia whose
in-town beaches will not be free of
commercial concessions, neat and clean
and fundamentally attractive, in con-
trast to their opposite numbers here.
But by the same token the outlying
beaches are no more distinguished
than the in-town ones. The continu-
ously stretching suburbs become more
and more alike, whether they run over
the plains of Colonel Light’s Adelaide
or up and down the hills of Sydney
and Hobart. Both of these magnifi-
cent natural surroundings are rapidly
being run over by the plasmodium of
indifferent architecture.
fOf which the much-beloved “in-
dividual home” all too frequently of
poor architectural design is the great'
est offender. In this I agree in the
older types but on the other hand we
have whole streets of most individual-
istic and charming cottages.]
There are not many landmarks in
Australian architectural tradition but
the few are significant. The first was

set at the beginning of the colony. It
is almost allegorical.
Nine hundred people landed in
Sydney Cove a year before Washing'
ton was elected President of the Unit'
ed States. Seven hundred of these
were transported convicts, two hun-
dred guardian marines under Captain
Phillip. The convicts were an ilhas'
sorted lot. Many were aged or in'
firm; there were six men to every
woman; there were no agriculturists,
no teachers, few carpenters; some
jvere idiots.
On unpromising land and with
these unpromising workers progress
was at first very slow. Lime could
be had only by burning seashells.
Other building materials were as hard
to get. At the end of a year -four
wooden huts had been put together
for the officers and a wooden house
for the Governor “in the Italian style
with a colonnade”. Yet Captain
Phillip was already making a town
plan, visualising a near day when
streets would be two hundred feet
wide, lots would be amply zoned,
there would be no mean and airless ah
leys, the structures would be of stone.
fWide streets would have been im'
possible to maintain in those days
with little water to keep the dust down
and but few workers to lay proper
cobblestones, for wood'blocking of
streets which served so well in the
next period, had not then been de'
vised. In the early days streets 200
feet wide would have meant com'
plete isolation for those on the oppo'
site side of the street. 1
The allegory is that the plan was
never realised. Food supplies and
other imports from Britain ran short.
Faced with starvation and drought, the
settlers found the grand plan noth'
ing but academic. Existing huts could
not be torn down to make room for
the new boulevards since there were
not enough roofs as it was. So the
street layout grew irregularly, and
Sydney never again found order for
its growth.
Brief Moment of Architectural
Grandeur.
Australia’s first plan was not execut'
ed because of a crisis in housing.
Nearly two centuries later, a crisis in
housing is still preventing any nobih
ity of architectural development.
Crisis may be chronic in Australia.
Then, beginning in 1814, there was
a brief moment of architectural grand'
eur, created by the genius of Francis
Greenway under the sponsorship of
Governor Lachlan Macquarie.
Greenway was characteristic of his
age. He was an architect of moder-
ate fame in an England which had a
noble Georgian tradition. Engaged
in litigation over a fee, he presented
a letter purporting to bear his client’s
ST. JAMES’ CHURCH. SYDNEY.
Designed by Francis Greenway.
Built in 1820 to the designs of Francis Greenway. The Eastern Gallery in the foreground was
added in 1834, while the elaborate patterning of the copper sheathing of the steeple and the
broaches which support it date from 1897. It was erected by Wunderlich Ltd after the former
spire began to topple. The height to the top of the steeple is 171 feet.
THE MACQUARIE
TOWER AND
LIGHTHOUSE.
One of Greenway’s
Masterpieces.
The Macquarie Tower and
Lighthouse, designed and
supervised by Francis Green
way, was the source of great
delight to Governor Lachlan
Macquarie. It was officially
opened on December 16th.,
1817, when the Governor
gave a party at the build
ing and on the same day
gave Mr. Greenway his
emancipation, “it being
delivered to him at Macquarie
Tower in the morning before
breakfast.” To-day. 135
years later, the Lighthouse
still faithfully serves its pur
pose and presents a pleasing
and dignified spectacle.

signature. The court found it a forg-
ery. Some say that this was at the
behest of the Governor, some say by
accident. Anyway, the Governor ap-
pointed him Government Architect at
a salary of three shillings a day. He
was emancipated in 1817. The hand
of Greenwav was everywhere. He
worked on proposals for squares,
houses, parks, churches, law courts.
Of these he realised but few, yet the
Hyde Park Barracks, the Macquarie
Tower and Lighthouse, St. fames’
Church in Sydney (built on the foun-
dations that were intended for the
Law Courts adjoining) and St. Mat-
thew’s in Windsor offer the finest ar-
chitecture in Australia. They are
reasonably compared, with Bulfinch’s
work in America.
“Everything he touches is simple,
stately and good. His architecture,
now called ‘Colonial’, is a transition
from the Georgian architecture devel-
oped in England with modifications
so suit the Australian climate. Ver-
andahs supported on light wooden
posts are added to provide an out-
door escape from stuffy interiors, to
shade the walls from the hot sun in
the summer months and as protection
against sudden rains. The economy
of materials, caused by circumstances,
enforces a simplicity and a depend-
ence on good proportion and design
which becomes a characteristic of the
style. It is an architecture of fine
craftsmanship; the beauty of brick
and stone in shade and shadow, of
spacious open settings amid trees and
sunlight.”
This could not last for long. A
commissioner was sent out from Eng-
land to find out why such fine build-
ings should be created in an “in-
secure” colony. The commissioner,
like many public servants since, stop-
ped work on the town hall, rejected
most of the architect’s proposals, said
that “common sheds on pillars of wood
are quite good enough for a Colony
like this.” This was the beginning
of the end. Macquarie was recalled
for his extravagance; Greenway had
no more commissions and died in
oblivion. Several of his buildings re-
main to be admired in old Sydney.
Anonymous and indigenous dwel-
ling houses have since been evolving
out of the Colonial tradition appropri-
ately modified for the climate. In
wet and chilly Tasmania, houses, still
without central heating, were built
without verandahs for there is little
need for sun shade there. Farther
north in Sydney verandahs were add-
ed to the traditional Georgian on the
sunny side. Some shaded area with
a breeze was needed for the summer.
The verandah soon passed into tradi-
tion and then was widely used with-
out regard to its function and simply
as the proper facade of a respectable
house regardless of its orientation.
fThe verandah and balcony now
mostly used as a sleep-out or kitchen-
ette or laundry or drying yard and
later glassed in or filled with canvas
blinds, constitute the greatest blot of
all on Sydney’s terrace-house-type of
architecture that abounds before one
embarks upon the suburban sprawl.
This treatment turns every building
into a shambles.]
Still farther north, in Queensland,
where it was really hot, the verandah
was carried around three and some-
times all four sides and the houses
were raised on stilts. These verandahs
were not for sitting out but to shade
the walls. The stilts provided good
air circulation underneath, kept the
house from being flooded in the
spring, brought the termite tunnels
out in the open where they could be
destroyed, and in a blizzard-free coun-
try offered inexpensive storage space.
All this was a good and indigenous
architecture but Australia has always
looked too much outside her borders
for inspiration. In a tragic moment
in the thirties, subdividers discovered
the Central European curved corner,
the corner window and the cantilever-
ed sun shade. The standard contem-
porary house has forgotten its tradi-
tion although its plan is unchanged.
For this still sensible tradition the
builders have substituted an outmoded
European fad designed for a different
climate. This fad makes no sense at
all. Save for a few examples like
those in the portfolio the various
movements of modern architecture,
much diluted by English restraint,
have washed aimlessly over Australia
with no advantage to anybody.
Burley Griffin and Canberra.
Only two other milestones need to
be mentioned. At the turn of the
century the several states of Australia
became a nation with a new national
capital at Canberra, in the highlands
of New South Wales. In 1911 a
great international competition was
held for the planning of the new city.
This competition was boycotted by
the official British architectural organ-
isations and was won by the Ameri-
can Walter Burley Griffin in a close
race with Eliel Saarinen.
Griffin is little remembered in
America but has a firm hold on the
architectural memory of Australia. A
disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright, he
produced a city plan which would need
an article to describe. The plan still
controls the development of Can-
berra.
(Which leaves the maze, developed
as an oddity in English Gardens, well
behind in the race for idiosyncrasy.
Practically every newcomer gets lost
as he goes round in circles.]
But he also built houses and New-
man College at the University of Mel-
bourne and a magnificent plaster ex-
travaganza of a theatre, the Capitol,
(continued overleaf)
THE “RUM HOSPITAL,” MACQUARIE STREET, SYDNEY.
Governor Macquarie gave three enterprising businessmen the right to import a vast quantity
of liquor in return for the erection of a hospital for the Colony, which finally cost the builders
some £40,000 to erect. In 1816, as he was not satisfied with the progress and construction
Macquarie appointed a committee consisting of Francis Greenway and Messrs. Bryan and
Samuel Bradley to inspect and report on the structure. Greenway found many faults and
recommended to the Governor a . Penalty of £l0,000 for breaches of agreement, apart from
£5,000 for expenditure on repairs and alterations. After many vicissitudes the building
which used to be known as the Old Mint, is now the headquarters of the Housing Commission
of N.S.W,


in Melbourne (described as kerosene
tin decoration). In Sydney his
houses of Castlecrag might have influ-
enced Australian architecture enorm-
ously but in fact it did not. Like
those of many another pioneer, his
roofs were said to leak. That the
roofs of unimaginative architects also
leak never seems to be remembered.
[Here I must protest, for in 999
cases out of 1000, or possibly 9999
out of 10,000, our roofs do not leak.]
Finally, what did the Australians
do with their brave new capital? They
immediately set about building Houses
of Parliament, Patents Offices, a hotel
or two, some shops and a good deal
of housing. But the official buildings
were not to be the fine ones which
would appear some day “when the
crisis was over’’. Australian budget
makers do not like to call their build-
ings temporary. This sounds too
cheap. So they call them “provision-
al”. This is really worse since a pro-
visional building need be no better
than a temporary one but will last
longer. Only an inadequate and triv-
ial library building and a large Na-
tional War Memorial are permanent
buildings in Canberra —those and the
United States Embassy. And here
hangs the final tale.
The United States has an eminent
site for its Australian Embassy. There
we have built an expensive house. It
sits in the middle of the beautiful and
special Australian climate and land-
scape, up on a hill for all to see.
Here we had a chance to show Aus-
tralians what building for their cli-
mate could be like today. Any one
of a dozen Pacific Coast architects
could have made this demonstration.
Instead of that, ten thousand miles
west, five thousand miles south and
two thousand feet higher above sea
level, not on the misty plains but on
the dry Australian Veldt, we present'
ed to Australia a modest imitation of
Williamsburg. The worst of it is that
lots of them like it.
f As a matter of fact we all love it.
It follows our own English Adam style.
Its planning provides for ample space,
good sequence and fine relationship
of one room to another. We like its
proportions and its restraint, for there
is not a vestige of fulsomeness in the
entire structure. In other words it
provided a nearer approach to the
English standard of dignity than any
private home erected in Canberra.]
What of the present? After a fast
start in the thirties there has been
very little modern architecture in Aus-
tralia. The portfolio shows what it is
like. Every Australian city of any
size has one or more hospitals of
the first class measured by any archi'
tectural standard, buildings which
dominate the towns just as cathedrals
did in the days of yore.
The other distinguished architecture
is to be found in institutions as small
as the hospitals are large. Pre-prim-
ary schools are apparently not import'
ant enough for administrators to inter-
fere with their healthy growth. They
are not important enough to need
brick.
The main reasons for the present
architectural sterility have been im-
plied in what has already been said.
But superimposed upon this is an'
other crisis—a double crisis really,
one of fear and one of full employ'
ment.
Full employment is a technical term
meaning that everyone who wants a
job has one and usually that he can
quit and get another one if you look
crosseyed at him. And in Australia
he will do precisely that. But it does
not mean that those fully employed
are working fully.
Building Productivity
Unforgiveably Low.
The Australian work week is tech'
nically forty hours. There are breaks
for morning tea and for lunch and
for afternoon tea at least and not any
great pace in between the breaks.
There is real fear among Australian
labourers that they will work them'
ves out of a job as they have before.
However much the lawmakers may
feel world pressure, the workman does
not. Building productivity is unfor-
giveably low. Standards of building
craftsmanship are third'dass.
{"Only twenty years ago our crafts-
ment compared favourably with the
world’s best but that was before the
days of go-slow-ism. One cannot ac-
quire an equivalent craftsmanship to
theirs without putting the long hours

: and enthusiastic work into it. Work
:is anthema to the present generation
r which is why, to get anything beauti'
fully done, one has to look to the
i over'middle aged craftsmen to do it.]
There are not enough people to
build houses fast enough so the gov'
i ernment makes contracts with foreign
[firms, Dutch, French and Spanish.
These firms bring labor, equipment
; and materials, build the houses, and
go home again. Australia is paying
for all this off the backs of her hum
dred million merino sheep during an
extremely favourable time for wool
sellers. Even so the favourable trade
balances are declining and the day of
reckoning cannot be far off. Mean'
while Australian architecture is further
debased by dreary, exotic foreign iim
ports.
In the meantime, too, Robin Boyd
may wait six months for a sheet of
plate glass to close in his client’s other'
wise finished house; Roy Grounds
may not be allowed a verandah on a
house because of the space limitations;
(and Florence Taylor cannot build
two extra bathrooms on to her home
at Vaucluse. One bathroom is ex'
pected to do service for 4 bedrooms];
Brian Lewis has to be reconciled to
the fact that his high'priority National
University buildings will take three
years or more to build—perhaps five.
In this sense architectural time stands
still in Australia.
Housing and Politics.
And by the same token there can
be no majestic new buildings, or ah
most none. If schools are falling
down, new ones may be built but
there must be no nonsense about them.
There must be no nonsense about the
National University, either. In an eg'
alitarian'minded society, the effects are
far'reaching. When the pressure for
housing is real and everybody under'
stands housing and anyone without a
house is a potential political foe, when
the contentment with low standards of
performance and small quantities of
performance produces a shortage of
simple things, the results are not hard
to predict. There will not be enough
materials, there will be criticism of
those who are wasteful or bold, there
will be regulations to prevent waste
or boldness. In a politically hyper'
conscious country which fears its new
national government, there will be
pressure on such a government to
build only things which are politically
Safe to build. The only safe thing
to build is housing and yet more
housing, for ever and ever. The thing
which is unsafe to build is a great
national capital or any other large
monument of distinction (except per'
haps a War Memorial).
(Even though the Sydney Houses
of Parliament are tumbling dowr*
which they are, in spots, there would
be a terrific outcry if someone sug'
gested we should build a new one.]
Yet this was not the way that the
Parthenon came about, or Chartres,
or the Great London which Austra'
lians so much admire, or Rockefeller
Centre or the square of Bendigo.
Australia’s “crisis” seems to be as I
have said, interminable and while it
persists there will not be any new
peaks on the rapidly levelling plain
of Australian culture, peaks which,
from her past, stand out in such high
relief and which in her present are
so conspicuously absent.
When, if ever, Australia senses a
relaxation of this pressure she may
then find that her landscape is so
cluttered with the mediocre that only
atomic demolition could ever make
it right again.
But there may be some hope. There
are signs of skill and of striving:
Yallourn’s browmcoal power plant,
the new steel town of Whyalla, the
Snowy River hydraulic projects, the
idea of a University of Technology
in New South Wales, or a National
University in Canberra.
In the architectural schools are a
great many restless young men.
Whether they are restless enough is
a fair question. One of their trag'
edies is that the sterling bloc keeps
them from getting dollars to visit the
country where they could learn for
sure that high productivity and flexn
bility of design and construction are
not a myth. Perhaps they are a little
too well disciplined, a little too ready
to criticise their land without doing
anything about it, a little too easily
discouraged.
But in a way they have reason for
discouragement. The primary ex'
ample, Australia being what it is,
must be set in the national capital.
Until the statesmen of Australia, sit'
ting in Canberra, have the courage to
risk their political lives on some brill'
iant engineering and architectural
achievements which will cost money
and which may not be approved by
the electorate, things are likely to re'
main in crisis until it has become too
late. Given this leadership, Australia
might have another Renaissance. She
needs another Lachlan Macquarie.
[We believe we have one in Mr.
Mensies, who has stabilised our
financed—an heroic task that brought
much unpopularity to Mr. Menzies
but a full sense of recovery to a top'
pling nation.l
But if this courage does not come
from the top, nothing can be expected
save continuing architectural medio'
crity which unfortunately a people
can accept as inevitable with the pas'
sage of but a few generations.
This is too sad a fate for the fine
Australian people.
INSULATION WITH
ALUMINIUM FOIL.
In the period since 1930 aluminium
foil has been widely used overseas for
thermal insulation of buildings, both
to prevent heat loss to the outside air
and to exclude solar heat from the
inside of buildings. It is used as a
vapour barrier and water - proofing
material for walls, roofs, inside and
outside basement walls and, recently,
as the chief component of buildup
roofing with the exposed surface of
the top layer having some insulation
value.
Aluminium foil is also used for the
insulation of refrigeration equipment,
railroad refrigerator cars, and other
types of refrigerated transport. It is
also being successfully employed for
boiler and steam installations, steam
pines, turbines, kilns and ovens.
The light weight of aluminium foil
insulation is one of its greatest advam
tages. It is one of the lightest insulat'
ing materials known and adds only a
negligible amount to the weight of the
structure. Its application is very
simple and may be applied in prac'
tically all cases with relative ease as
compared to insulating with other
materials. Aluminium foil does not
disintegrate on handling as with other
types of insulation and. therefore, no
irritating particles are present to irri'
tate the skin. Another important
factor of aluminium foil insulation is
its proof against attack by vermin or
insects.

GLASS BRICK FACADES.
Glass bricks are extensively used in the
facade of this French chemists’ shop, and forms
stallhoard beneath the display windows, the
freize above, and casing for the dividing
pier. A glass circle is formed within each
square glass brick, which catches and high
lights glass as a building material that has
never before been exploited and turns it into
a thing of beauty.

AMERICA'S LARGEST PARKING BUILDING COMPLETED
CAPACITY: 1600 CARS ON FIVE LEVELS.
What is probably the largest multi'
storey parking building in the United
States has just been completed. Focal
point of The Hecht Company’s new
suburban shopping centre at Aling'
ton, the building can accommodate
1600 cars on its five parking levels.
Noteworthy is the structure’s un'
usual design. On all four sides, two'
way flat'slab floors cantilevers a half'
bay beyond the outer columns. This
is one of the first instances where can'
tilevers of such great length (15 and
have been used in flat'slab con'
struction.
In plan, the shopping centre, named
“Parkington,” resembles a futuristic
airplane. The 570 ft. x 216 ft. parking
building can be likened to the fuse'
lage. Attached to one end is the
300,000 sq. ft. Hecht department
store, four storeys high, which repre-
sents the nose, and one-storey and
basement neighbouring stories form
the swept'back “wings.”
The entire project will cost
15,000,000 dollars about 3,000,000
dollars is for the garage and 6,000,000
dollars for the main store.
How Large a Parking
Building?
Initial planning revolved around
the basic requirement to secure ade'
quate parking. Area relationships
were used. Hecht figured that a
300.000 sq. ft. main store was needed
to serve the surrounding and growing
community of 300,000 people. Neigh'
bouring stores would contain about
100.000 sq. ft.
A ratio of 2 sq. ft. of parking
space per sq. ft. of gross building
area was employed. Since 160,000
sq. ft. of surface parking space ac'
commodating 355 cars was available
around the 18'acre site, a parking
building containing 640,000 sq. ft.
was required.
R H. Tatlow, President of Abbott,
Merkt & Co., who was the engineer,
comments that a ratio of 3 to 1 is
normally more desirable. But because
many of the Parkington shoppers
come on foot or by public transit, a
2 to 1 ratio suffices. The ratio of
parking space to actual selling area is
2.8 to 1.
Why Cantilevers?
It was clear that the most economh
cal design of the garage called for
two-way flat slabs with drop panels.
Cantilevers a half'bay long were em-
ployed on all four sides for three
reasons: The second, third and roof
levels were to tie into the main store,
while a 45ft. wide arcade adjacent to
the main store substitutes for the first
floor there; display windows in the
Hecht store would be obstructed if
exterior columns were flush against
them, but with cantilevers these
columns are 15 ft. away. Second,
columns adjacent to neighbouring
stores could be eliminated; and finally,
this construction allows a row of
diagonally-parked automobiles between
the exterior column line and edge of
the cantilever. Quicker parking is
said to result if cars can turn off both
sides of driveways. Had normal flat'
slab design been used, the outermost
driveways would have had to be right
next to the exterior walls.
Final Design.
The completed building has rein-
forced concrete columns spaced 30ft.
on centres along the east'west 570 ft.
dimension and 27ft. on centres along
AMERICA DOES SOMETHING ABOUT PARKING.
The parking problem is world-wide and while Sydney fiddles and does nothing or worse still takes the absolutely
negative action of banning parking in the city area which is cutting off the life-giving stream from the economic
body of the city—America ‘‘gets cracking” at the problem. We illustrate the largest parking building yet erected
in US A at the Hecht Shopping Centre at Arlington, which accommodates 1600 cars on its five levels.
illustration shows the building in plan and section and indicates how by utilising flat slab cantilevers of half-bay
width on all four sides cars can turn off both sides of the outermost driveways.

the 216 ft. width. Cantilevers are 15ft.
at each end and 13ft. 6in. on each
side.
Floor'to'floor heights are 10ft.
Shoppers can enter the main store
from all levels of the parking build'
ing. The second level is flush with a
main'Store floor (floors are spaced
15ft. apart thereafter). Customers
wishing to enter from the third and
roof levels walk only sft. up or down.
Slab Details.
The two'way slab is thick and
is broom - finished. Drop panels
measure x x deep.
Column capitals are in diameter.
Carrying a load of 1007 kips, the
largest column is ,34in. in diameter.
A 2500 p.s.i. concrete mix was used
for the floor slab, while column mixes
varied from 2500 p.s.i. (at top floor
columns) to 3750 p.s.i. used for first
floor supports.
Except on the second floor over
the arcade and neighbouring stores
where the load is 266 p.s.f., the flat
slabs were designed for a total load
of 222 p.s.f. It breaks down as fob
lows; Live load, 80 p.s.f,; slab, 132
p.s.f.; drop panel, 10 p.s.f. The
second floor portion has an additional
44 p.s.f. due to a thickness of
protective concrete. The ground floor
consists of an asphalt macadam wear'
ing surface laid right on the ground.
Sides and one end of the building
are open except for a 3ft. high
thick parapet wall at the ends of can'
tilevers.
Twodnch expansion joints at all
levels separate the parking building
from the main store. A rubber'based
material with copper chips is used.
Another 2in. expansion joint has been
placed crosswise 255 ft. from the main
store. Onednch joints have been eim
ployed where the garage abuts neigh'
bouring stores.
Parking Diagonal.
Parking in the building is on a
diagonal of 68 degrees, stalls are Bft.
Sin. wide, while aisles are wide.
After a customer narks his own car,
he walks an average of less than 300 ft.
to the main store.
If he wants to go to one of the
neighbouring stores, he uses an eleva'
tor housed in a 27ft. x 30ft. core
running through the entire building.
Express Ramps.
Extremely swift movement of cars
in and out of the garage is made pos'
sible by a uniquely'designed system
of ramps. Two of these, one on each
side, provide direct entrance to every
parking level. The other soutlvside
ramps are of direct exit from each
level.
All ramps are sloped at 11.1%
(10ft. in 90ft.). They are composed
of 6in. reinforced concrete slabs top'
ped with a lin. wearing surface. Top
ramps on both sides have a lin.
waterproofin'* layer in addition. Rail'
ings for the south side ramps are
slin. deep, with thicknesses varying
from 12in. to 16in. The between'
floor ramps have 36in. deep, Sin.
thick railings.

Hub of the Hecht company’s new 18-acre shopping centre at Arlington, Virginia, is the 570 ft.

BOLD ARCHITECTURAL TREATMENT
FOR NEW LONDON FLATS.
New and distinctive architectural treatment has
been given to the design of a block of flats
now being erected at the Paddington Borough
Council’s new housing scheme at Hallfield
estate, London. The first 10-storey structure
has been completed and occupied. It
contains 80 flats and occupies the north-eastern
edge of a 17-acre site, on which there will
eventually be six more blocks of the same
design and eight six-storey blocks, grouped round
a sequence of large courtyards. When the
whole scheme is completed it will provide
656 flats in all. {Not so long ago people
selected a place for their abode because of its
artistic appearance, quite apart from its
accommodation. Nowadays the only things
governing their requirements are whether the
flat has all the labour saving devices, and is
it central? Transport is almost an insur
mountable problem. Nobody care-"' whether
the building has an appearance or not.}

Factories By The Package
PREFABRICATED INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER, New York.
Prefabricated industrial buildings are
still relatively new. They are the
natural development of the pre-war
“tin” garage and the war-time Quon-
set hut. Before the war. a few com-
panies made metal or wood garages
and sheds that were bought by the
package.
The war brought along a demand
for quick construction of bigger, more
varied buildings. To-day, pre-designed,
permanent, steel-frame structures made
from standardised units are shipped to
location as a single package. There is
a choice of more than twenty firms
that will deliver the components of
the projected building shell in two to
sixteen weeks. In another few weeks
it will be assembled and ready for
occupancy.
Streamlined Method
of Construction.
All that is required at the building
site are a crane, bolts, wrenches, a set
of erection instruction and a construc-
tion crew. Users of this streamlined
method of construction include sprawl-
ing industrial giants in need of new
plants as well as the small jobber in
quest of extra storage space. When
a short while ago a large-scale shift of
air flights had to be made from the
closed Newark Airport to the New
York International Airport at Idle-
wild, two general purpose buildings,
each with 20,000 square feet of floor
space, were rushed to Idlewild by the
Luria Engineering Corporation, Beth-
lehem, Pennsylvania, and completed in
a few weeks.
Industrial prefab, dollar volume is
still only 2% or 3% of total indus-
trial and commercial construction, but
its growth is remarkable. “Engineer-
ing News-Record” made a comparison
between 1947 and this year. One
prefabricator produced 700,000 square
feet of industrial buildings in 1946
and 3,000,000 square feet last year.
One builder who turned out 20,000
square feet of buildings in 1950 raised
his output to 110,000 square feet in
1951. In this kind of growth, prefab,
builders see acceptance of their claims
of faster construction, lower cost, great
flexibility and portability.
“Business Week,” in a study on the
advantages of prefabricated industrial
buildings, mentions also some possible
disadvantages. The buyer gets only a
shell of a building; he still has to hire
a contractor to build foundations, in-
stall floors, plumbing, heating, wiring.
Many companies going into building
projects prefer specialists who design
a production line and tailor a plant to
the individual problem. There is also
so much standardisation of components
that some customers see little advan-
tage in the,.prefab. buildings. The idea
is still so new that some potential
buyers have not thought about it.
The prefab, makers are trying hard
to overcome such objections. One of
their strong points, the “Engineering
News-Record” survey shows, is the
fact that prices still range from 1 dol-
lar to 2.50 dollars a square foot, just
as they did five years ago. Mean-
while, building costs as a whole have
risen about 35 per cent. Increasing
volume and improved efficiency of
production have enabled prefab, com-
panies to hold prices down.
The erection method follows a pre-
determined pa 11 er n regardless of
whether the constructing firm or a
local contractor does the erecting. All
the elements required to put up the
structure are shipped to the site, in-
cluding the bolts, nuts and screws.
Types of Prefab. Industrial
Buildings.
There are two main types of prefab,
industrial buildings: (1) with load'
bearing walls; (2) with skeleton frame.
You can buy in a bearing-wall design
buildings in lengths that are a multiple
of 2ft., 4ft., 6ft. or Bft. In skeleton-
frame construction, the multiple is
usually 10ft„ 12ft.. 16ft. or 20ft.
Widths vary similarly, with clear spans
available up to 200 ft. Clear heights
range from 6ft. to 30ft.
There is an eminent variety of sizes.
Luria Engineering Corporation has
finished a 130,000 square feet factory
at Allantown, Pennsylvania —520 ft.
long and 250 ft. wide. At Omaha,
Behlen Manufacturing Company of
Columbus, Nebraska, supplied a 522 ft.
by 100 ft. frameless warehouse which
was put together in 48 days. A cus-
tomer can choose any type of roofing
and siding material —corrugated steel,
aluminium, asbestos-cement, brick, con-
crete, etc. —;and there is a wide selec-
tion of standardised sashes and doors.
The Luria concern offers three dif-
ferent types of standardised steel build-
ings, with the units lending themselves
to many combinations for specific pur-
poses. One type is of rigid “A” frame
design, with clear spans of 32 to 100
feet. This type is for general purpose
structures, where maximum, unob-
PREFABRICATING STEEL BUILDINGS.
Steel-framed industrial buildings of the gabled
rigid frame type, with ridged roof, offer
structural economies resulting from their
simplicity of design. Standardised factory buildings
of this type are being prefabricated in a
large way by American engineering firms.
The upper picture shows the stocks of steel
beam sections carried by one firm engaged in
this business. In the lower picture gusset
plates, cut obliquely from beam sections are
being welded on the ends of the roof
members, while on the right flange plates have
been welded in position ready for bolting
to the flanges and capping pieces of the
column members o f the frames.
PREFABRICATED STEEL FRAME
NEARS COMPLETION.
This standardised industrial building of a
type now finding frequent sales in the U.S.A.
The steel frames consist of two column and
two roof members with prefabricated bolted
connections at crown and hip joints where
welded gussets arc provided. Three wall girts
of inverted channel section will receive the
corrugated iron siding and the steel beam
purlins are also ready for the roof covering.
Designs of this type call for a minimum of
shipwork and the erection procedure is simple.

structed floor areas and head'room are
desired.
The second type is a centre'column
building that meets the requirement of
a general' purpose structure where
large, clear spans are not needed and
where centre columns can be employ-
ed to advantage. The third type is a
crane building equipped with rails and
supports for overhead travelling cranes
of 5 to 10'ton capacity. The standard
rail heights are 15ft. and 25ft., but
intermediate and higher rail heights
can be supplied.
The buyer has to have the founda-
tion built and, after the shell is assem-
bled, he has to have floors installed,
as well as plumbing, heating and
wiring.
“HASTE WITHOUT WASTE”.
U.K. Homes Rise Faster.
Houses are being built faster —
“Haste without waste” —Mr. Harold
Macmillan, Minister for Housing and
Local Government, said recently.
There was hope the improvement
would continue, he added.
The Minister said that more than
20 per cent, of the brick houses com'
pleted last June had been built in
seven months, against 13 per cent, a
year earlier.
The 110,964 houses completed in
the first half of this year showed a 21
per cent, increase on the 92,086 in
lanuary-June last year.
Design Standards and Planning Problems
BRISBANE CITY COUNCIL ANNUAL REPORT, 1950-51.
The Annual Report of the Brisbane
City Council for the period 19 50'51
(which was not received until Septem'
ber, 1952) in the manner of govern'
mental and semi'governmental reports,
while it contains many facts of general
and statistical interest, can naturally
not be regarded as revealing in its em
tirety an accurate picture of affairs as
at present for nowadays events move
much more quickly than annual re-
ports and conditions change very
rapidly.
Since the production of this report,
which is adorned with a full-page pic'
ture of the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor
of Brisbane, Aid. J. B. Chandler, there
have been sweeping changes in the
personnel of the Council in which a
number of sweeping dismissals have
been made amongst the heads of some
of the technical departments, particu'
larly in the Planning and Building
Sections. This seems regrettable, par'
ticularly when one reads in the report
that five new members of the Plan'
ning staff had recently arrived from
London to assist in the completion of
the City Plan “within the next year.”
Whatever the views of those in charge
of the ‘ development of any modern
major city, there must be planned de-
velopment or ever-increasing chaos.
It is recorded that the total number
of building applications in respect of
private building activities received dur'
ing the period was 11,175, as against
the figure of 9,913 the previous
year. 10,761 were approved, includ'
ing 6818 dwellings, 17 multiple dwell'
ings, and 1588 industrial, commercial
and miscellaneous buildings! Total
value of new work approved was
£12,847,293 and £1,135,268 for altera'
tions.
Standards of Design.
Report of the Building Surveyor’s
Section on the subject of Standards
of Designs says: “Efforts are consis'
tently made through interviews with
prospective owners of domestic and
commercial buildings to obtain an im'
provement in design. It is a difficult
task which demands much time and
patience, and in some cases has little
or no results, but in other cases has
produced results which have been ad'
mantageous both to the applicant and
the City generally, for well-designed
buildings are a civic asset.”
Planning Problems.
The Town Planning Section at the
end of its report refers to the follow'
ing problems that have been con'
sidered but which have not reached
finality:—
A Land Use Survey of the entire
City area;
Proposals to alleviate the Car Park'
ing problem in the City centre;
Investigations into Density propo-
sals within the City, with particu'
lar relation to flat buildings;
Revision of the minimum require'
ment for areas and frontages for
allotments in Urban, Rural, and
Green Belt areas.
A further aerial survey of the city
area is also being conducted.
PREFABRICATED STEEL FRAME
BUILDINGS.
Prefabrication to standard designs is making
headway in the United States for industrial
buildings that are required urgently. A
construction crew, with mobile crane provides
speeedy erection, all fastenings being sup
plied with the “packaged” building. The
upper picture shows a building of the steel
beam rigid-frame type with large stiffened
gusset members at the hip joints. In the

type, used by a railway company as an
engine shed, is shown complete with roof
covering and wall siding.

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust.-N.S.W.
REPORT OF GENERAL MEETING OF THE ILLUMINATING ENGINEERING SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA
Held at the G.U.0.0.F. Hall, 147 Castlereagh St., Sydney, on 6th November, 1952, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. E. L. Freedman,
and 38 members and visitors were
present.
The President extended a hearty
welcome to the visitors, and partial'
larly to the many lady members pres'
ent.
Subject of the Evening.
The meeting took the form of an
“Open Discussion Night.”
Mr. Harry Seidler, A.R.A.1.A., be'
gan the meeting with a richly illus'
trated talk on “Design.” He showed
how design concepts had changed in
all fields, how the modern eye had
accepted transparency where previous'
ly it looked for solidity; how we
now designed for contrast where pre'
viously we tried to match; that we
were quite prepared to enjoy non'
symmetrical lines where earlier we
had gone to great lengths to be sym-
metrical, to the extent even of “make'
believe”. He mainly illustrated his
case with examples from his own pro'
fession-—Architecture—but also from
a great number of other subjects of
industrial design, and, of course,
showed also a number of typical mod'
ern lighting work.
Mr. E. L. Freedman opened the dis'
cussion by asking: “What can we as
lighting engineers do in our own field
to match these new concepts of de'
sign?” He suggested that lighting in'
stallations and light fittings must fulfill
three main conditions: They must be
aesthetically acceptable in their own
right, they must be aesthetically ac'
ceptable in the environment in which
they are placed, and they must, above
all, produce a valid lighting solution
for a given seeing task. He empha'
sised that lighting is always a means
to an end, and never the end in itself,
Mr. W. A. Smith stated that it is
our duty to be interested in all
matters of design and not treat light'
ing and its problems without relation
to the other parts of the problem,
Lighting implied a frame of mind,
and if we ourselves are too conserva'
tive this conservative frame of mind
must impress itself on our lighting
work. He thought that at the mo'
ment we in Australia could only pro'
duce photographs of new designs,
but hoped that we would gradually
evolve our own design technique,
Mr. G. Beecher, who had just re'
turned from an eight months’ trip
through England and the Continent,
brought greetings to the Society from
Mr. F. 1. Phillips, Vice-Chairman of
Philips Industries Limited, Eindhoven,
Holland, who had been in Australia
earlier this year. He reported that
great strides had been made overseas
in the development of new lighting
fixtures. He thought that the deveh
opment was most advanced in SwitZ'
erland and England, and he hoped
that many of these new designs could
be adapted to our own climatic con'
ditions. He suggested that with the
advance of new types of light fittings
of all kinds the old types would grad'
ually disappear and make room for
more aesthetic and more modern
equipment.
Mrs. A. W. Smith supported the
trend for modern fixtures of “clean”
design, and stressed the importance
of simplicity from the housewife’s
point of view, namely, the greater
ease of keeping light fittings as clean
as the other parts of the house.
Mr. G. Macauley doubted whether
the new type of building structures
would not be more costly than the
conventional type, but was sufficiently
assured on this point by Mr. Seidler.
He raised the problem whether the
use of glass facades was acceptable
in colder climates, and Mr. Seidler
could assure him on this point too
that through double glazing and other
methods of insulation, and with the
judicious use of radiant heating, glass
facades had become quite acceptable
in other climates.
Mr. Macauley doubted also the
structural strength of the new build'
ing methods, and Mr. Seidler could
tell him that the new buildings were
designed and engineered to withstand
great feasible stresses, and that he at
least had yet to hear of a new build'
ing which had lost its roof in a
storm.
Mr. T. W. Fitzgerald warned that
one should not think that concealed
fittings were always dust'proof, and
that they should be included in the
cleaning schedule for the home.
Mr. R. O. Phillips stated that glass
areas in cold but sunny climates were
often quite economical in fuel cost
because of the selection transmission
of the glass, which acts here similarjy
as in a greenhouse.
Mr. Harry Seidler in winding up
the discussion stated that new design
methods always brought about new
problems of detail and construction,
and he was certain that the future
would accept the designs which are
new to'day just as the past had accept'
ed those designs to which we have
now become accustomed.
FLUORESCENT LIGHTING AT FILM STUDIOS.
The great increase in the use of fluorescent tubular lighting in English theatres was illustrated
in a recent issue of General Electric Company’s publication (in Australia represented by The
British General Electric Co. Ltd.). We show four examples: (Top left) Decorative cold cath-
ode lighting in the restaurent at the Elstree Film Studios. (Bottom left) Concealed cold cathode

Mr. John Knight then gave a talk
based on a chart published in the
I.E.S. Lighting Review, April, 1952,
in which A. A. Kunithof relates norm
inal colour temperatures of sources
to illumination in footcandles.
He pointed out that at high levels
of illumination colours seldom ap'
peared unnatural, but that at low
levels of 2 and 5 foot'candles, the
chart recommended the use of light
sources of no more than 2200°K.
What should we do in our homes?
Use Candles? Coloured Lights? The
latter seems to be the accepted light
source in at least all those types of
restaurants and nightclubs which rely
on low levels of illumination to create
their particular atmosphere.
Mr. B. H. Harwood stated that the
principles embodied in the graph had
been substantiated by tests carried out
recently in Great Britain. Their ob'
ject had been to determine the order
of preference for a number of differ-
ent colour sources when used in a
variety of installations, and over a
wide range of illumination values.
Mr. Harwood emphasised that not
only the colour of the light made the
atmosphere of a room, but also the
choice of colours and textures used
for walls, ceilings, and furnishings.
Mr. Harwood recommended the use
of fluorescent tubes of the warmest
available tints, and if that was not
sufficient, to use the paint brush iu-
diciously.
Mr. F. de Courcy Gribble submitted
that particularly the distortion of
make-up seemed objectionable to
women when using light sources of
colder colours.
Mr. L. S. Hyatt suggested that one
could often achieve good results by
using methods which were theoreti-
cally not as correct, as long as one
realised that the human eye judges
colours subjectively and not objective-
ly as does the meter.
Mr. P. J. Grundfest suggested that
many apparent failures of the early
fluorescent lighting installations could
be traced to the facts contained in
the graph. The appearance of incan-
descent and fluorescent installations
of the same illumination was of such
marked difference in favour of the
incandescent source of lower colour
temperature that one had to install
often a multiple of the old illumina-
tion value to achieve the same visual
results with sources of high colour
temperatures.
Vote of Thanks.
Mr. G. C. T. Brown proposed and
'p<ut the "vote of thanks to the two
opening speakers and all the others
who had contributed to the evening's
discussion. He warmly recommend-
ed greater inclusion of the light fit-
ting in the architectural design and
suggested that a great number of
sources and fixtures were now avail-
able for incorporation in the room
design as “architectural lighting’’.
This could be practicable and econ-
omical. With regard to low levels
of illumination he suggested the use
of coloured lights and of large panels
of contrasting colours with which to
match the new concepts of architect-
ural designs with the means of the
illuminating engineering profession.
He expressed his own personal satis-
faction on the friendly spirit and
the high level of competence with
which the meeting had discussed the
problems raised, and hoped that man’
more “Open Nights" would be held
in future years.
Long Bridge
Completed
The Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
The third longest “water bridge’’ in
the world, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge,
is now open.
This bridge stretches four and a
half miles over water. Its approaches
are three miles long. It cost more
than £14,250,000 and was completed
in 42 months.
Ordinary motor cars pay a toll of
12/6d. to cross the bridge and another
2/' per passenger, excluding the
driver.
The bridge provides a quick route
to Washington from the north. Its
most striking features are twin suspen-
sion towers, which carry the span 1600
feet across the main navigation chan'
nel to Baltimore at a height of 193
feet above the water.
Drift From Timber
Industry
7000 in Nine Months.
According to the Senior Vice-Presi-
dent of the Timber Workers’ Union,
Mr. I. Weir, more than 7000 workers
have left the timber industry in the
past nine months.
Reports made by State secretaries
to the unions’ recent Federal confer'
ence in Sydney revealed this drift,
Mr. Weir said.
It had occurred in all States except
South Australia.
Reports also revealed that at least
30 N.S.W. sawmills and 15 in Vk'
toria had closed down, while produc'
tion at the eight N.S.W. plywood
factories had practically stopped.
Millions of super feet of timber was
lying at grass because of the slacken'
ing of sales at present.
London psychiatist received a
post-card from a patient on holiday.
It read: “Having a wonderful time.
Wish I knew why."
THE NEW VOGUE.
This model of a house in the new style em-
phasises the desire to form heavy and con-
trasting patterns in various materials; thus
there is the random rubble wall, the roof
spandrels of concrete pierced with a series of
circles, contrasting with the vertical fin-
like motif of the louvres below. The “butter-
fly” roof which brings all the water to the
centre is a vulnerable feature in excessively
stormy weather.

Wormald Bros.
Industries Ltd.
Celebrate Sixty-Third Anniversary.
In order to commemorate the fact
that 1952 marks the 63rd anniversary
of the founding of the business that is
now known as Wormald Bros. Indus-
tries Ltd., the organisation have pro-
duced an attractive brochure which, in
the words of Mr. G. Gordon Russell,
the Chairman of Directors, “will en-
able our friends to appreciate just
what we do and where we are estab-
lished to give service.”
Early History.
The company has a continuous his-
tory since March 23, 1889, when it
was established as a partnership by
Stanley G. Russell and Joseph D.
Wormald under the name of Russell
& Wormald, with an office in No. 3
Bond St., Sydney, and a store in the
basement of the Queen Victoria Mark-
ets. In 1900 the firm became Wormald
Bros., and in 1911 a limited com-
pany with a nominal capital of
£25,000. The first works at Waterloo
with about 20,000 ft. of floor space,
were built the following year. The
continual growth and increased decen-
tralisation since the war, caused com-
plete reorganisation of the capital
structure and separate companies—
Steelbilt Ltd., Kirsch Company (Aust.)
Ltd., Wormald Brothers (East) Ltd.,
and Wormald Brothers (South) Ltd.,
were formed in 1947. The undertak-
ing .became a public company in May,
1949.
Details of Products.
Comprehensive details of the com-
pany’s many products—Fire Protec-
tion, Firedoors, etc., Steelbilt equip-
ment of all types, and Kirsch Venetian
blinds, are set out, while illustrations
of the organisation’s premises at the
various Australian and New Zealand
centres are included.
The cover bears an illustration in
colour of a Mural in the Board Room
of the Head Office in Sydney which
“suggests” the primitive fire-fighting
methods employed in the Great Fire
of London in 1666.
Canada’s “Trend
House”
HAS MANY HOME-BUILDING
LESSONS
Designed To Promote Sale
of Timber.
With a typical Canadian eye for
business, British Columbian timber in-
terests are capitalising on the growing
tendency in Western home architec-
ture and at the same time stimulating
the sale of British Columbian soft-
woods in the Ontario market.
One of the most significant Canadian
developments in the home-architecture
field in recent years has been the evolu-
tion of a distinctive Western school of
home design.
Utilising the natural beauty and
wide variety of forms and finishes
offered by British Columbia’s prime
softwoods, leading Western Canadian
architects have pioneered a new trend
in casually informal yet vigorously
modern home styles.
Early this year- the B.C. lumber in-
dustry launched its most ambitious
promotional campaign, built around
an all-timber, small home completed
last May in Toronto, Ontario, and
aptly named the “Trend House.”
This Trend House, located in
Thorncrest Village, Toronto, was open
to the public from June to October,
and attracted thousands of visitors and
created a whole new body of timber
home enthusiasts in Ontario.
British Columbia’s three major
building softwoods -- Western Red
Cedar, B.C. Douglas Fir, and Pacific
Coast Hemlock were used in many
different and interesting forms
throughout the Trend House to de-
monstrate the amazing versatility of
these species. and Pacific Coast
Cypress, or Yellow Cedar, also figured
decoratively in the striking ceiling grid
design.
Measuring 50 feet by 24 feet, the
house is framed on Douglas Fir posts
and beams cantilevered over a con-
crete block basement. Western Red
Cedar was used for studding, sheath-
ing, wall strapping and roof decking,
and the exterior was finished in verti-
cal Red Cedar reverse boards and bat-
tens, and roofed with Red Cedar
shingles.
Footnote: Some of the largest cut
timber to leave British Columbia for
25 years is part of the cargo of the
Greek ship “Kehrea,” now berthed at
Newcastle. The timber is more than
50ft. long and over 4ft. in diameter.
It was cut at the Frazer Mills, B.C.
The mills are the second largest in
the world. It is believed that the
timber will be used for large construc-
tional work. It will not be unloaded
in Newcastle.
HOME COMFORT
NOW AND 80 YEARS AGO.
(Top) New luxury, 19-storey apartment house
overlooking the East River, New York.
(Centre) Built 80 years ago as a model farm-
house, this sturdily-build home still stands.
It is described as “mellowed, landscaped, and
difficult to heat.” (Bottom) This little house
is no eye-catcher, but it is full of conveni-
ences. Built as a model farmhouse, it is a
highly efficient living unit.
THE “TREND HOUSE”.
Recently completed in Toronto, Canada, the
aptly-named “Trend House,” built entirely
of British Columbia softwoods combines com-
fort, economy, and style.

Water Board Report
Activity During 1951.
The fact that departmental reports
are always some eighteen months out
of date does not augment the useful-
ness from the topical point of view,
though it is, of course, realised that
they have other statistical record pur-
poses. The difficulty of compilation
and printing to ensure earlier release
is also appreciated.
We have just received the 63rd
Annual Report of the Metropolitan
Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board
for the year ending June, 1951, and
thus it is natural that no factors of the
present period of financial difficulty
come within its orbit; rather, the em-
phasis is on scarcity of labour and
material.
It is recorded that the maximum
storage during the year in all dams
was 122,183,000,000 gallons, the mini-
mum being 115,574,000,000; total
quantity of water delivered during the
period was 50,689,000,000 gallons,
which is a daily average of 138.9 mil-
lion gallons or 73.1 gallons per head
of population as at December 31st,
1950.
The W.irragamba Dam.
The Warragamba Dam is the major
construction work now in hand and is
designed to provide for a population
several times larger than that at pre-
sent served by the Board. It will con-
sist of a straight gravity type mass-
concrete wall, constructed by pouring
concrete into 50ft. x 50ft. columns
which will be grouted together sub-
sequently to form a monolith. Its
overall length will be approximately
1300 ft. at crest and it will have an
overshot spillway at the central 300 ft.
of the wall. The maximum flood has
been estimated at 500,000 cubic feet
per second, which will involve a 48ft.
depth of water over the crest of the
gap. The energy of this will be dis-
sipated by hydraulic jump or other
suitable means yet to be determined by
hydraulic model tests. More than
million cubic yards of concrete will
need to be placed in constructing the
dam.
During the year under review, work
at the dam site continued on the varied
works prerequisite to construction of
the dam itself. In the township, estab-
lished to provide accommodation and
all necessary facilities for the Board’s
employees, 430 cottages have been
completed, and a further 72 are in
course of construction. These are of
a comfortable two- and three-bedroom
type of pleasing appearance, and as
far as possible regard has been paid in
their design to the aspect of ready
demountability, with a view to re-
moval and erection elsewhere when
the dam has been completed. Work-
men’s barracks have been provided for
the accommodation of 741 single men.
Import of Materials.
The Board has endeavoured to al-
leviate the long-standing shortage of
materials for new construction by im-
portation from overseas at consider-
able additional cost of substantial quan-
tities of cast iron pipes and fittings,
steel plate for pipe manufacture, re-
inforcing steel, and stop valves for re-
ticulation purposes. All the cast iron
pipes purchased by the Board from
local sources are supplied internally
cement lined for protection against
corrosion. Those available from over-
seas are unlined; it has therefore been
necessary to arrange for their lining
locally after delivery. Further orders
placed during the year included 273
miles of 4in, cast iron pipes together
with necessary fittings, valves, etc.
Bondi Ocean Outfall
System.
As the Outfall Treatment Works
will be situated right at the outfall,
and consequently deep in a sandstone
cliff, a large proportion of the work
to be done in their preparation con-
sists of the excavation of some 65,000
cubic yards of rock. About 85% has
already been removed, of which 6500
cubic yards were taken out during the
year under review and a start was
made on the concreting of No. 1
Sedimentation Tank.
The total length of sewers was
2951 miles. Expenditure on water,
sewerage and drainage work was
£4,993,104. Total staff and employees
was 6873.
A Private Research
Organisation
Benefits The Whole Wide World.
A Swedish shipping firm has been
able to reduce its running time be'
tween Denmark and Sweden by 30
minutes, after having coated the ship’s
bottoms with a new paint to prevent
barnacles and other marine growths.
This performance formerly entailed
periodic docking.
The Battelle Memorial Research In-
stitute in America was responsible for
the anti-fouling paint used by the
Swedish firm. It has been experi-
menting for 23 years and has spent
$50,000,000 (£A.23,000,000) on its
researches for the benefit of chemists,
physicists and ceramists. Their oper-
ations cover 12 miles of laboratories.
It has a staff of 1,800.
Some of its achievements embrace
welding aluminium to prevent leak-
age from steam valves at high tem-
peratures; improved tips for nylon
paint brush bristles; a better surgical
heart pump: a coal stove that burns
its own smoke; extracting bromine
from sea water used in anti-knock
gasoline and magnesium (a metal
lighter than aluminium).
Researches in ultrasonics include
sound waves pitched higher than the
human ear can hear; inspecting ma-
terials for internal flaws and captur-
ing smoke particles from exhaust gases
to control air pollution.
These are but a few of the activi-
ties covered by this organisation
whose benefits are legion and their
compass world-wide.
FLUORESCENT LIGHTING
PLANT.
A plant which will make Britain
self-supporting in her demands for
fluorescent lighting tubing has been
opened at Firhill, Glasgow. This
Velio tubing plant is a <£750,000
dollar-earning and dollar-saving pro-
ject. Up to now, not enough tubes
for fluorescent lighting have been pro-
duced in the U.K., and supplies had
to be imported.
Although most of the original de-
signs for the process machinery were
American, they have been adopted by
the engineering staff, who also de-
signed the furnace which makes the
glass. All the machinery was made
by U.K. firms.
AN UNUSUAL CHURCH.
This most unusual structure is a model of a Roman Catholic Church, planned by Zurich (Ger-
many) architect A. Slider. As is the custom with most continental churches, this project in-
cludes community rooms, lecture rooms, and priests’ presbytery. All sections of the church
are connected by covered walkways, and our illustration shows, left, presbytery, centre,
church, with modernistic tower and sawtooth roof to form triangular clerestory windows and
(right) lecture rooms. The community is in the basement of the church, and is entered
from the rear.

Bank Credits v.
Human Energy
“The recent announcement that
bank credit controls are to be lifted
so as to make funds again available
for building projects comes as most
welcome news, for it means that the
industry can now seize the opportun-
ity of putting into effect plans that
may have been formulated during
the period of marking time,” said Mr.
Cobden Parkes, N.S.W. Government
Architect, when referring to the Archi'
tectural Convention in Brisbane.
It seems, however, that we want
more than money to build houses and
city buildings. We want an honest'
to'goodness effort on the part of
workmen to work every hour and
every minute of the time they are
paid to work, and less “leaning on
their shovels” and standing around in
two’s and three's gossiping.
Lots of workers would a thousand
times rather work than listen to the
unedifying prattle of their lesser'
brained co-workers, but unions, we
are told, everywhere have advised
their members to go slow, so as not
to work themselves out of a job. This
was expressed to the writer by a War'
ragamba Dam worker, who said when
asked when the job would be finished:
“It is supposed to take 4 years, but
it will take 8 years if we know any'
thing about it. We are not going
to work ourselves out of a job."
This means the Warragamba job
will cost twice as much and that the
men will price themselves out of jobs
to follow, no matter when that may
be, for though the country may flow
with “milk and honey" as this great
country promises to do, people, gov'
ernment and semi'government author'
ities will not release money for build'
ing purposes unless they can get a
quid pro quo of value. The banks
are bursting with money and people
are longing to build, if only labour
will play the game and put energy
into their tasks. This country is sag'
ging from lack of effort with too
many workmen, tired of doing noth'
ing and leaning aimlessly on their
shovels.
Development of
Canadian Outposts
Industrial Progress Works Wonders.!
Canadian frontiers are being rapidly
pushed back, as the Nation rides on
the crest of its biggest industrial and
mineral boom on record.
Remote places, and yesterday urn
known, are tO'day key-points in the
national expansion. Tomorrow they
may well be thriving towns of great
importance.
This is just what has happened to
Kitimat, on the Alaska'Canada high'
way, a lonely place it paid one to
avoid before the highway was built
during the war. For Kitimat offered
little or nothing to the prospector or
the trapper. Now it is the centre of
many industries.
It has become the heart of Alcan’s
(The Aluminium Co. of Canada) huge
West Coast hydro'electric power and
aluminium development.
The first industrial plant to be built
at Kitimat will be an oxygen and
acetylene plant for the Canadian
Liquid Air Co. (See illustration.)
With a large number of “firsts" to
its credit in developing areas of British
Columbia and east of the Lakehead,
Liquid Air Co. has been closely asso'
ciated with the industrial development
of the West Coast and Canada gene'
rally for over 40 years
During that time the company has
pioneered the building and operation
of oxygen plants.
Kitimat will make the 18th plant in
a network stretching through all the
principal industrial centres from Van'
couver to Newfoundland.
Creche And Amenities Centre
SYDNEY CITY COUNCIL PROJECT NEARS COMPLETION.
Work is proceeding apace with
construction of the Sydney City
Council’s Creche and Women’s Amen'
ities Centre at the Hyde Park corner
of Elizabeth and Park Streets.
The Centre will provide, in addi'
tion to a creche and nursery, a meet'
ing place for women with lounge and
refreshment rooms.
There will be showers, bathrooms,
foot'baths, and dressing rooms.
Included also in the plans is a
chemist shop, and the building will
include a playroom, kitchen and toy
store.

Wharf Labourers and
the Shipping Industry
Unions Have “Killed the Goose”
The Commonwealth Government
proposes to sell Lithgow coal at Bni'
main Wharf at £9 a ton “to help the
coal and shipping industry.
There never should have been need
for any such consideration if workers
unions had not used the strike weapon
to send up wages or enforce some gain
or other for themselves, which have
only succeeded in sending up prices
all round and placing all commodities
beyond the economic limit Their
demands granted at first became so
fantastic that they could not be coped
with at all. Fancy a pilot taking a
ship to Brisbane getting £25 for this
task, added to his normal pay, which
would then total £95 for the job.
High prices and go'slow tactics have
combined to slow down our trading
with other countries and turn business
away from Australia. In other words,
unions have simply “killed the goose
that laid for them the golden eggs,”
for now the wharflabourers are not
faring nearly as well as men who are
in steady jobs in any other calling.
There is in the Wharflabourers’
Union a vigilance committee known
as “the deadly seven” who have
power to punish and fine their men
for every trivial union offence urn
til the men ask themselves “are we
working for our own living or to
swell the union funds?” They are
fined £2 if they leave a job, and go up
to £6 or £7 for other offences. The
men have their work so organised for
them that one man can stay away and
his absence will be sufficient to close
they could be punished or fined, or
a ship down. Thus they are not tak'
ing part in an illegal strike for which
their unions could be fined and struck
off the register.
The men are not known by names,
merely by numbers as though they
were jail birds.
“Who are the deadly seven”? I
asked.
Their names were reeled off with
much gusto and intense hatred.
I thought what a shame it was for
men to come under the whip of their
task masters —the union bosses, who
were not even their employers. Surely
no employer was ever hated like their
union bosses who wield the big stick
over them. The same applies to most
unionists.
Altering the Navigation Act.
To cope with shortage of men con-
sidered necessary to man a ship, now
so numerous that they practically
tumble over each other, the Govern-
ment has proposed a new Navigation
Act which will enable a ship to go
to sea with only four-fifths of its
specified crew —providing the ship
owners satisfy port authorities that
“all reasonable efforts” to obtain a
crew have been made. The same dis-
cretion is granted if only four-fifths
of the prescribed number of officers
is available. Other sections in the
proposed Act give port superintend-
ents wide powers in engaging, or re-
fusing to engage, seamen and other
crew members.
Many English shipping companies
are thinking twice before releasing
their ships for the Australian run
where their ships are fust as likely as
not to be tied up to the wharves, or
stay in midstream, for months on end.
Reverting to the coal problem.
Now that Victoria and South Austra'
lia buy Indian Coal for gas which
N.S.W. cannot, but India can, supply
in large quantities, there is an outcry.
In the 12 months to June 30 last
Victoria imported 1,398,280 tons of
coal from N.S.W. The railways took
268,536 tons, the State Electricity
Commission 152,644 tons, gas under'
takings 657,244 tons, and hospitals
and industry 319,956 tons. Imports
from India totalled 180,066 tons, of
which the gas works took 78,999 tons,
railways 75,907 tons, industry 13,894
tons and the State Electricity Cemunis'
sion 11,266 tons. The State Electricity
Commission took all the 104,438 tons
from Callide and 7,108,402 tons of
brown coal from Yallourn.
“High Prices
Frightening Home
Builders”
Warning to Building Industry.
In his annual report, tabled in the
House of Representatives, the War-
Service Homes Director, Mr. S.
Lucas, warned that high prices were
frightening off prospective home'
builders.
In the interest of the building in'
dustry, it was most important that re'
sponsible builders should fully appre'
ciate the attitude of prospective clients
to high building prices.
Reporting “negligible” group build'
ing, Mr. Lucas said that many build'
ers had asked for group contracts,
but most had submitted prices in ex'
cess of those for individual homes of
the same types.
During 1951'52, 15,388. War Ser'
vice Homes —including 4205 new
buildings—were provided.
These figures were a record, the
report said, despite the fact that dur'
ing the year applications for the pur'
chase of secondhand homes had to
be deferred.
Since the scheme began. 37,232
homes had been built.
A total of 41,344 had been pur'
chased, and mortgages discharged in
12,327 others.
SUICIDE STAIRS.
There appears to be a most peculiar complex
in the minds of some of the most extreme
“modern” architects to play around with the
humble, utilitarian staircase and by a series
of eliminations reduce it until it hardly exists
at all. No risers, no strings, no handrails,
no support ... no stairs! The small
mezzanine floor from a house in Brazil seen
in the lower view also seems to, like Mo-
homet’s coffin, hover ’twixt earth and sky.

there was a large gathering of inter-
ested spectators at Fairfield on Sep-
tember 27th, when the 120,000 th per-
manent home built in N.S.W. since
the war was handed over to its own-
ers, Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Haste.
The ceremony was arranged by the
Rural Bank of N.S.W. as being “proud
to be one of those instrumental in fos-
tering, in a practical manner, this
priceless democratic ideal of home
ownership.”
The Fairfield Housing Project, spon-
sored by the Rural Bank, is symbolic
of the Bank’s desire to assist salary
and wage earners to acquire a home,
with a modest deposit.
The Hon. Clive R. Evatt, Q.C.,
M.L.A., Minister for Housing, repre-
sented the N.S.W. Government at the
ceremony, and others present in the
official party included the Mayor of
Fairfield, Aid. P. Ryan, Mr. J. S. Free-
man, ML.A., the President, Rural
Bank, Mr. C. R. McKerihan, Mr.
Commissioner Fletcher, and the Execu-
tive Director, Building Industry Con-
gress, Mr. D. Stewart Fraser.
The ceremony commenced at 10.15
a.m. with the Rural Bank President,
Mr. McKerihan, extending a sincere
welcome to all present.
He was followed by the Mayor of
Fairfield, who joined in the welcome
and spoke of his pride in the rapid
growth of his municipality.
He stressed the urgent need for de-
cent homes for the people, and offered
the fullest support of his council in
all housing undertakings.
Mr. ]. S. Freeman, M.L.A., also
spoke briefly on the housing problem,
and pledged his support in an all-out
drive to obtain homes for all who
need them.
Bank’s Work in Housing.
The Rural Bank President, Mr. Mc-
Kerihan, said it was his pleasing duty
to ask the Minister for Housing, Mr.
Clive Evatt, to perform the ceremony
of opening the 120,000 th house to
be built in N.S.W. since the war.
He asked Mr. Evatt to present an
Album to the owners, Mr. and Mrs.
R. W. Haste, as a lasting memento of
“this great occasion.”
Mr. McKerihan referred to the fact
that during Mr. Evatt’s term as Min-
ister for Housing, from 1949, 60,000
homes have been built in N.S.W.
The speaker congratulated the Min-
ister on his achievement, and assured
him of the Rural Bank’s support in
all matters concerning the develop-
ment of the State.
The Minister, replying, said it gave
him very great pleasure to be present
on such an important occasion.
Mr. Evatt pointed out that housing
was the greatest social problem we
have, and that good housing will make
the greatest contribution to the hap-
piness of the people.
The construction of 120,000 perm-
anent homes in N.S.W. since the war
was a grand achievement, and the cere-
mony of handing over the 120,000 th
house would let the people know
what has been done.
“Efforts Derided”.
Mr. Evatt said that a morning paper
“has today derided what we have
done.
“In a sense we have not done
enough, and there is still much more
to be done.
“What has been done was in the
face of tremendous difficulties—some
almost insurmountable,” Mr. Evatt
said. _
“During the war, there was no
house building, and we had all the
trouble about building materials.
“During that period there was no
building materials but plenty of money.
“Now the situation is reversed!
“It is wrong and scandalous.
Brickyards are closed down and men
are out of work, and the bricks can'
not be sold.”
“House Every Six Minutes.”
Mr. Evatt said that just under three
years ago—in 1949 —60,000 homes
had been built since the war ended.
Since then a further 60,000 homes
had been erected.
“That is 20,000 homes a year.
400 homes a week, each working
week; each working day 80 homes
are completed; 80 welhbuilt, perman-
ent homes.
“That is ten an hour, and every
six working minutes another house is
ready, another family housed, and
another problem solved.
“We should throw our hats in the
air and be proud of this achievement,
Mr. Evatt added.
He appealed for everyone to work
together. Local Government authors
ties and all political parties. Such
teamwork would solve the misery anci
suffering associated with bad housing.
Mr. Evatt paid a tribute to the
Rural Bank, in which he had been
supported by Mr. Freeman.
The work of the Homes Division
of the Rural Bank was “a remarkable
achievement, both in the number and
the quality of the homes.”
Mr. Evatt said he wanted the people
of N.S.W. to know that the Govern'
ment was determined to solve and
overcome the housing problem.
He wanted to see credit flowing
again.
“We don’t want statements made
that credit is going to flow and then
we find it isn’t flowing.”
Mr. Evatt paid a tribute to the
work of the Co-operative Building So-
cieties and the Housing Commission,
“who had done a great job.”
He said the Federal authorities must
realise that N.S.W. “must have lots
and lots of money.”
“I will build houses if I get the
money.
DECORATION TEXTURE.
By the simple expedient of projecting a
“header” brick every alternate course and
staggering them in their courses a most in-
teresting pattern is formed in the walling
and gives an interesting contrast to the glass
and timber walls. It is part of a block of
flats at Twickenham, Middlesex.

“I am entitled to the money by the
law of the country, and I demand it
under the Commonwealth'State Hous'
ing Agreement,” Mr. Evatt declared.
In presenting an Album to Mr.
Haste, and a sheaf of flowers to Mrs.
Haste, Mr. Evatt wished them long,
happy years of home-ownership.
Mr. Commissioner Fletcher, in pro-
posing a vote of thanks to Mr. Evatt,
thanked him for his “very considerable
help.
“During Mr. Evatt’s term of office
there had been the greatest activity
ever in housing.
“Much has been accomplished, but
much still remains to be done.
“Mr. Evatt will do all he can to
see it through.
“During his term he has carried on
the work of slum clearance, and sub-
standard homes have been replaced
with fine structures for people to live
in,” Mr. Fletcher added.
Speaking in support, Mr. D.
Stewart Fraser said that the Rural
Bank “must get a great deal of satis-
faction out of bringing people’s dream
castles down to Mother Earth,”
Mr. Fraser referred to the “build-
your-own-home” movement, and point-
ed out the many pitfalls awaiting those
without experience or sufficient fin-
ance.
“They get the job half finished,
then they bring the tangled mess to
the 8.1. C. doorstep.
“That can’t happen under the
Rural Bank’s system of finance.”
Mr. Fraser congratulated Mr. and
Mrs. Haste on becoming the owners
of such a fine home, and paid a trib-
ute to the Bank for “the services
rendered our great nation.
“The building industry regards the
Rural Bank as the peoples’ friend.
“The industry needs a yardstick,
which is the Bank, and its guidance is
of importance to the building
industry,” Mr. Fraser added.
Record Housing
Figures
A record of 20,109 new houses
were completed in Australia during
the quarter ended June 30, according
to the Acting Commonwealth Statis'
tician.
This brings the year’s total to a re'
cord of 77,415, a rise of nearly 10,000
on the previous year.
They are worth £171,000,000 —an
increase of £56,000,000.
At the end of June there were
81,980 houses under construction
throughout Australia compared with
80,101 a year earlier.
However, there was a steady de'
dine during the year in the number
of new houses begun.

SETTING FOR SLEEP.
“Blessings on him that first invented sleep,”
Don Quixote is quoted as saying. One could
also say “blessings on him who gives sleep
such delightful settings as depicted in these
two photos. The top photo shows a glimpse
of a bedroom in “The Home of Tomorrow,”
in Los Angeles, Cal., where the true spirit
of restfulness is reflected in behind-the-bed
drapes, deep carpets, and luxurious twin beds.
The bottom of a bedroom in a resi-
dence at Tarzana, Cal. Note the twin beds
connected at the head only by an upholstered
headpiece. Note also the heavy drapings to
control sound and light. AH furniture is up-
holstered in the same fabric as the headpiece
and coverlets. Taste and dignity combine in
these two bedrooms to give their occupants
deep and restful slumber in ideal surroundings.

BOOK REVIEW:
“Asphaite In Modern
Building
Construction”
By G. J. HANCOCK.
230 pp. 165 Figs. Index.
George Newnes Ltd., Lond*n.
English Price, 30/-.
A popular couplet of some years
ago said:
“To talk of architecture is but a joke,
’Till you can build a fireplace that
won’t smoke.”
It could also be said:
“An architect’s knowledge is very
weak,
’Till he’s sure his buildings will not
leak.”
And this thought very naturally
brings us to the subject Asphalte in
Building. We hear a lot today of
new methods of construction and new
techniques but there is nothing new
nor is there any effective substitute
for mastic asphalte in building foi
Man’s many needs. The frontispiece
in this new book is an aerial view
of the roofs of the great pile of
the University of London which is
described as “a modern example of
the flat roof, surfaced throughout
with standardised natural asphalte
mastic.” The fact that asphalte
has served man for so many cen-
turies is emphasised by a drawing
of the reconstruction of the huge As-
syrian Ziggurat (Circa 538 8.C.) as
explored by Sir Leonard Woolley in
1923 in which a composition very
similar to mastic asphalte was exten-
sively employed in its construction,
as an external rendering and as mor-
tar for brickwork, for pavings and
for damp-proofing storage chambers.
It will thus be evident that the prim'
ary use of mastic asphaltes from the
earliest times was as a durable, water'
proof membrane in connection with
roofing, dampeourse and foundation
work. With development and research
over the past fifty years, mastic as-
phalte has been applied successfully
in many other ways and today it is
used as a flooring and as a lining for
tanks for many industrial purposes
which necessitate special heavy duty
materials and acid-resisting products.
An Important Industry*
The Asphalte Industry is of con-
siderable siz;e and importance. Apart
from the owning and working of the
sources of supply of the raw material,
most firms have the dual operation of
manufacturing the mastic and its ap-
plication on the site. The latter is re-
cognised as a sub-contracting trade
within the Building Industry and em-
ploys skilled operatives who are train-
ed by a system of indentured appren-
ticeship, which includes attendance
at technical courses under a system
of day release. The actual prepara-
tion of this book was initiated by the
call for a short text book suitable for
the use of apprentices and of trainees
coming into the industry under the
Government post-war Training
schemes, though during preparation it
developed into its present form, in
which it will serve a much wider field.
The work is divided into nine sec-
tions as follows: The nature, compo-
sition and varieties of asphalte; The
uses of mastic asphalte; Asphalting
in large scale construction: The tech-
nique of asphalting; the manufacture
of mastic asphalte; the testing and
analysis of asphalte and its compon-
ents; Raw materials: Details of par-
ticular interest to the asphalte con-
tractor, the architect and engineer;
the measurement and specification of
asphalte work. In addition to a clear
and concise text, the diagrams show-
ing the application of the asphalte in
the various parts of building construe'
tion are excellent.
A book that should be on the refer'
ence shelf of every architect, master
builder and engineer—particularly to*
day in view of the increase in the use
of flat roofs.

WAR MEMORIAL AT RUNNYMEDE.
Work is in progress at Cooper’s Hill, Runnymede, England, on a War Memorial for Airmen
of the Commonwealth who gave their lives in the cause of freedom during World War 11.
There will be 52 small chapels in the cloisters on both sites of the memorial and their names
will be recorded therein, while the badges of their squadrons will be engraved on the chapel
ceilings. On the left is an aerial view and on the right the view from the Severn bank.
CONCRETE IN HOUSE
CONSTRUCTION.
The Ministry of Housing of the British
Government is encouraging non-traditional
methods of building construction in order to
speed up housing progress while still main-
taining full production in other forms of in-
dustry. The top illustration shows the stand-
ardised steel forms used for the Wimpey
“no-fines” system of concrete-in-situ walls.
A crawler-mounted crane places and removes
the forms. This system was developed be-
tween the two world wars, as also was the
Laing “Easiform” system illustrated in the
second picture. This forms a continuous
2-inch cavity. Concrete is placed in 2ft. lifts
and consolidated. The third picture shows a
mechanised concrete cart, the one-yard Ave-
ling-Barford dumper, mounted on large, pneu-
matic-tyred wheels. This dumper, like the
wheelbarrow, is equally serviceable for
handling excavated earth.

Master Builders’Federation of Australia
REPORTS OF AFFILIATED ASSOCIATIONS
Presented at the Perth Convention
(continued from previous issue)
MASTER BUILDERS AND
CONTRACTORS’ ASSOCIATION
OF NORTHERN TERRITORY.
It is desired to present to you,
this, the Fourth Annual Report of
the Master Builders and Contractors’
Association of the Northern Territory
for your perusal and to endeavour to
present to you some picture of its
activities in this area and those items
which may occasion some influence on
its future advancement.
As you are all aware considerable
attention has been focussed on the
development of the Uranium Field
at Rum Jungle and the mineral leases
taken up by the Broken Hill Pty.
Ltd.
These particular projects, although
they may not have apparent direct
influence in the building trades at
present, must do so as their activities
increase, even though it may be due
to the increased trade through ship-
ping and supply lines via Darwin
which must expand to meet those de-
mands. For example it has even been
proposed that a new wharf be built,
this to cover the requirements of in-
ward and outward shipping for the
mines.
Shipping.
This item presents one of the major
problems to all types of commercial
interests in the Northern Territory
not only through increasing costs,
but also through the uncertainty of
date of supply due to a wide range
of circumstances varying from strikes
in Southern ports, to change in cli-
matic conditions through South Aus-
tralia, Queensland and Northern Ter-
ritory.
Tenure of Land.
This has been one of the major
problems in this area since the Gov-
ernment acquisition Act came into be-
ing after the war and has been the
cause of considerable lack of activity
on behalf of the pre-war resident as
each and every one of them has been
awaiting Government decision re-
garding the fate of their dwellings.
During the past 12 months most
short term leases have expired and
longer leases have been offered to
business houses. In most instances
within the main town area, these leases
are of 25 years duration and require
the repurchase of the acquired build-
ing and providing satisfactory settle-
ment can be reached on the value of
said buildings, so tenders for private
contracts must increase considerably.
Apprenticeship Board.
This Board is a new innovation to
the Northern Territory but gentlemen
as you can well appreciate, one very
vital to the interests of the future of
the building trade functions. At pres-
ent members of the Board are as
follows:
(a) Chairman appointed by the
Administrator.
(b) Commonwealth Officer ap-
pointed by the Administrator.
(c) One member appointed from
nominations of the Master
Builders and Contractors’ As-
sociation and the other by the
Chamber of Commerce.
(d) One employee from the
Amalgamated Engineering Un-
ion.
(e) One employee from the North
Australian Workers’ Union.
Membership.
Total number of members is now
20 comprising;
Master Builders 7
Allied Trades 13
Contracts for Govern-
ment Departments .... £425,000
Day Labour for Gov-
ernments Depts £BO,OOO
Rehabilitation, Repair
and General Main-
tenance of Buildings £150,000
No. of houses erected
for Government Depts. 40
Private Dwellings 25
Value of Private Con-
tacts £60,000
Railways.
As a result of the recent visit of
the politicians a standard gauge rail
is to be made to Alice Springs and
eventually to Darwin. This will de-
velop to a very great extent the Ter-
ritory.
In conclusion Mr. President, I offer
you sincere wishes from the North-
ern Territory Association and I am
fully confident that this Convention
will be as successful as those held in
previous years.
L. G. HINCH,
President.

Your Son
Making the right
decision
r question of your son’s first job is a vital
one. Is it going to give him the start he
wants? Does it hold real opportunities?
On the answers largely depends the success of
your boy’s career. In Australia’s fast-growing
iron and steel industry he will find the opening
he wants, plus every chance to make the most
of his abilities.
Under The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.’s
Staff Training Scheme, he will receive the
all-round, on-the-job experience which will help
him qualify for promotion, as well as financial
assistance in gaining necessary professional
qualifications, whether commercial or technical.
Furthermore, promotion is from within the
organisation.
Applicants for appointment as commercial
trainees must hold the Leaving Certificate or
equivalent. If your son wants to follow a
technical career, he will need to be qualified to
undertake a Technical College diploma course
in engineering or metallurgy.

boys to apprenticeship. Results are
difficult to observe but there were
definite instances where our efforts
had proved successful. The Associa'
tion also tendered comprehensive evi'
dence to the Commonwealth/State
Inquiry into Apprenticeship, when
particular emphasis was given to the
cost of employing apprentices under
present conditions.
WAGE RATES.
Operative from the first pay period
in July, 1952, the State Wages Board
granted increases in skill margins to
all building tradesmen, and increased
the rates for excess fares and travelling
time. Margins were increased by
thirty (30) per cent, and the rates for
fares were doubled.
Naturally, our Association protested
bitterly at these unnecessary increases
and condemned the present constitu'
tion of the State Wages Board under
which the Chairman’s casting vote
makes employer representation quite
futile.
HOUSING.
During the quarter ended 31st
March, 1952, 705 new houses were
completed in Tasmania. This repre'
sents a decrease of 631 or 47 per cent.,
compared with the quarter ended 31st
December, 1951, and is the lowest
number of completions recorded since
the last quarter of 1949,
The number of new houses com'
menced during the March quarter
1952 was 787. This is 229 or 22 per
cent, fewer than in the December
quarter, 1951, and is the lowest num-
ber of commencements recorded since
December quarter, 1948,
Since July, 1945, a total of 18,556
new houses has been placed under
construction in Tasmania, of which
15,258 have been completed.
During the March quarter, 1952,
the value of new buildings (other
than houses) commenced was £468,'
000, or £124,000 less than during the
December quarter, 1951, and £261,'
000 less than during the correspond'
ing period in 1951.
An interesting feature of our hous'
ing statistics is that of the 787 new
houses commenced in the March
quarter of this year, 267 were com'
menced by building contractors, 81
by Government day labour, and 439
by owner builders.
MATERIALS.
The materials position in Tas'
mania has eased considerably follow'
ing the imposition of credit restric'
tions. During the year the Associa'
tion agitated for an inquiry into the
timber industry which was duly held;
the report of the Committee has only
recently been published, but due to
the lack of cooperation from interest'
ed bodies giving evidence, and the
subsequent availability of timber fob
lowing credit restrictions, the Inquiry
has not really been of benefit to the
building industry.
GENERAL.
Building activities in Tasmania
have been greatly curtailed as a result
of considerable restriction on Govern'
ment and semi'Government works.
Many works in course of construction
in the early part of the year were
stopped completely due to shortage
of funds. Several resumed at the be'
ginning of the new financial year, and
it remains to be seen when these will
continue, or will again be stopped
through financial difficulty.
Despite this very important prob'
lem, we in Tasmania are convinced
that the future holds a lot for the in'
dustry, and are viewing the economic
changes in an optimistic manner. We
are convinced that the change is a
beneficial one which will have the
effect of stabilizing our industry.
It is pleasing for me to record the
introduction during the year of the
new monthly trade journal “Tasman
ian Architecture and Building”; the
journal is the official organ of the
building industry in Tasmania and
has been received very favourably by
all associated with the industry. On
present indications it is anticipated
that the journal will soon be enlarg'
ed to provide a really comprehensive
coverage of the building industry.
Our close liaison with the two af'
filiated associations in the North of
the State still continues and during
the year representatives of all three
associations have met as required to
discuss items of importance, with re-
sultant benefit to the industry.
In concluding this report Mr. Presi'
dent and gentlemen, I desire to ex
press the thanks of members in Tas-
mania to the Federation and its offi'
cers, and all Associations for their
grand cooperation during the past
year. I especially thank the State
Secretaries for the very valuable help
and advice received by our associa'
tion. We look forward to the next
year with optimism, quite confident
that our combined efforts will result
in mutual benefit to all members.

Olympic Stadium
Competition
Won by Melbourne Architect.
The result of the Architectural Com'
petition for the design of the main
Stadium for the 1956 Melbourne
Olympic Games was announced on
Monday, October 20, by Mr. A.
W. Coles, chairman of the Games Con'
trol Committee.
First prise, which is the commis'
sion of erecting the Stadium, went to
Mr. Frank Heath, 44'year'old Mel'
bourne Architect and Town Planner,
from these six selected the winner.
The judges picked from the 115
entries, six designs that they consider'
ed to be the most meritorious and
The remaining five, each of which re'
ceive a premium of £5OO, were as
follows:
Keith W. Payne Bruce Shaw, of
Sydney.
Stephenson & Turner (Sydney
Office).
Stephenson 6? Turner (Melbourne
Office).
Bates, Smart 6? McCutcheon, of
Melbourne.
John G. Barton, of Melbourne.
The Stadium, which will be situat'
ed at the Carlton football ground,
about two miles from the city, will
cost £1,100,000 and accommodate
125,000 people, of which 50,000 will
be seated and 30,000 under cover.
Provision is made in the scheme for
restaurants, cafeterias, first aid and
doctors’ rooms and the many other
facilities required for Olympic compe'
tition.
The oval is 615 ft long and 490 ft.
wide and will accommodate 4000 com'
petitors in the opening parade and
space for 200 athletes to compete.
Mr. Heath said that the design was
a victory for teamwork for about fif'
teen men—the oldest aged 46 —have
worked day and night for three
months to produce the winning
scheme.
A LONDON CLOAK ROOM.
This cloak room, with its staggered layout
of counters, was designed by a London firm
of architects for the Royal Festival Hall at
the recent South Bank Exhibition in London.
It is interesting that the dark wood selected
for the counters and screens is Australian wal-
nut, the lighter trims being of beechwood
which also forms the counter tops. The
grilles in the counter fronts are of pressed
steel with a painted finish. It should be
noted also that the counter fronts are several
inches clear of the floor.

A Master (Piece)
Specification
Or Pity The Poor Contractor.
Interpretation.
The plans and specifications are to
be taken together, anything shown on
the plans and not mentioned in the
specifications, and anything mentioned
in the specifications and not shown
on the plans is to be considered as
both shown and specified, and any-
thing wanted by the owner or any of
his friends, or by anybody else (ex-
cept the contractor) shall be consid-
ered as shown, specified and required,
and shall be provided by the con-
tractor without expense to anybody
but himself. If the work has been
done without expense to the contract-
or, the work shall be taken down and
done over again until the expense is
satisfactory to the owner. Coinci-
dence between the plans and executed
work shall not be considered a claim
for extra compensation. The archi-
tect is not to be held responsible for
any such coincidence.
Anything that is right on the plans
is to be considered right. Anything
that is wrong on the plans shall be
discovered by the contractor and shall
be made right by the contractor with-
out telling the architect or indicating
it in the bills. Anything that is for-
gotten or left out of the plans and
specifications, but which is necessary
and required for the comfort and con-
venience of the owner whether he
thought of it before or after the
execution of the contract, shall be pro-
vided by the contractor to the satis-
faction of everybody.
Rules and Regulations.
The work throughout shall comply
with all rules, regulations, caprices
and whims of all City, County, Nation
and International Departments, Bur-
eaus and officials, having, or not hav-
ing proper jurisdiction.
Materials.
All materials shall be of the best of
their several kinds, and the contractor
is expected to know and provide the
best, irrespective of what is specified
in detail.
Further, the architect reserves the
right to change his mind about what
is best. Any changes necessary to
make the work and material fit, to the
mind of the architect, shall be made
by the Contractor without extra cost.
Arbiter.
In case of any dispute arising as to
the nature or character of the work,
specified or implied, the matter shall
be decided by referendum or recall'
ing after which the decision may be
reversed by the architect.
Payments.
Payments, if any, shall be made on
the architect’s certificate. Architect’s
certificates shall not be considered ne-
gotiable, nor are they legal tender.
When once issued, the architect as-
sumes no responsibility for their use-
fulness.
Partial payments may be made as
the work progresses in the amount of
eighty'five per cent, of the value of
the work done as judged by the ar-
chitect. The final payment (if any)
shall be due but not payable when
every whim of the owner and/or archi-
tect has been fulfilled and any evi-
dence of satisfaction on the part of
the contractor shall be sufficient
grounds for the withholding of the
final certificate sine die.

Has Britain’s
Building Plan Gone
Wrong ?
In Britain today fourteen brand new
towns are being built in an endeavour
to stem the spread of existing cities
Here, by planning, factories and
houses form a pleasing contrast to the
wholesale despoiling of the green
countryside by the growth of Britain s
cities.
For the nation’s town planners
claim that Britain’s big cities represent
a tragic misuse of land and an insane
use of transport.
(Perhaps there is a lesson in what
follows for Australia.)
Since 1943, Lord Beveridge, 73-
year-old author of the famous Report
on Social Insurance, has wholeheart-
edly advocated the necessity and value
of new towns.
In his latest book “New Towns
and the Case for Them,” he discloses
that all is not going to plan.
Lord Beveridge claims that the main
trouble is that the building industry
has been slow getting on with the
job, and experts feel that he should
know.
For the author is chairman of a cor-
poration building a new town at New-
ton Aycliffe, near Durham.
Productivity in the building indus-
try per man hour in 1949 —the lat-
est figures quoted by Lord Beveridge
—was still 20 per cent, lower than
before the war.
Weekly earnings, however, were
twice as high, while overheads and pro-
fits fared even better —they climbed
by 195 per cent.
So, Beveridge writes, “one after
another ambitious schemes for mak-
ing the perfect town fall by the way
or are delayed.”
What the industry should do is to
“get as many bricks as possible laid
each day, not as few as possible.” For
the building slow-down, and local dif-
ficulties have made progress sadly
slow at some new towns.
“Adjustment Needed.”
At Bracknell, in Berks, only 44 new
houses were occupied by March 31,
1952. At Cwmbran, Monmouthshire,
only eight, and at Hatfield, Herts, 80.
At Peterlee, County Durham, there
was “considerable delay” in commenc-
ing being on partly worked coal seams
under almost all the site.
Writes Lord Beveridge: “The
building programme above ground
has to be adjusted to the mining pro-
gramme below ground.”
Further troubles described in the
book are:
• At Basildon, Essex, there are dif-
ficulties caused by the chemical nature
of the soil.
• At Hermel Hempstead, Herts,
“proper development requires the re-
moval of an existing branch railway
that runs through the middle of the
area.”
• The Harlow (Essex) Corpora-
tion claims that the new towns had
“too many masters,” and that the ad-
ministrative machinery is “cumbrous
beyond belief.”
• “Rents are too high in the new
towns.” Lord Beveridge pays £2/11/-
a week plus rates for his four-bed-
roomed house in Newton Aycliffe.
• Slow builders, high interest rates,
heavy development expenses for
roads, sewers and water, are forcing
the corporation to charge higher rents
than first planned.
Yet, despite all the flaws, Beveridge
still backs the new towns, saying:
“They can set an example and a
standard of happy, healthy living,
close to one’s work, and yet close to
natural beauty. They can be an in-
spiration.”
(Last August, the Housing Minis-
ter. Mr. Harold Macmillan, asked Lord
Beveridge to relinquish his chairman-
ship of the Newton Aycliffe Devel-
opment Corporation in a year’s time.
Mr. Macmillan decided on this action
in view of Lord Beveridge’s age. He
is 73.)
It Pays to Advertise
The day Isaac Reckitt wrote to the
Emperor of Russia he started some-
thing. Some 15 months later he re-
ceived a reply which set the seal ol
success on a commodity now world-
famous.
Over 100 years ago Isaac Reckitt —
who had twice failed in business be-
fore—set up as a starch-maker in Hull
on a £B2O loan.
A fervent Quaker and an eager bus-
iness man, his faith in the quality of
his product was coupled with imagin-
ation.
He grasped the chance to let all
England share his conviction. The
chance came through advertising his
products, after his son George plead-
ed:
. . .We shall be the first in the
field, and I trust that a few years of
these direct appeals will gain us some
portion of the public on our side.”
So late in 1849 systematic advertis-
ing commenced; in newspapers, by
showcards, and by handbills.
It was early the next year that
Isaac sent a sample of starch to Em-
perior Nicholas of Russia. Fifteen
months later he and his sons received
a message saying that the starch had
been tested in His Imperial Majesty s
household and found “highly satis-
factory”.
Within a month the firm was ad-
vertising to all Britain that Reckitt’s
Patent Soluble Starch was “as sup-
plied to the Imperial Laundry of
H.M. the Emperor of Russia.”
The firm never stopped advertising,
and the £B2O company has developed
into the £6 million combine of Reckitt
and Colman.
Yes, it pays to advertise! Novel
ideas, novel methods pay large divi-
dends! But don’t be “starchy” in
your outlook. Let our experts advise
and assist you!
No Flowers
By Request!
Latest State Government move is
the suspended work on the Circular
Quay Railway Station and the Eastern
Suburbs Railway. This £1? million
white elephant has now died a natural
death, as has most other N.S.W. Gov-
ernment projects.
Lack of finance is the major reason
given for the wholesale shutting down
of many important jobs.
There’s sorrow in Macquarie Street,
And tears flow unashamed—
The money’s spent, they’re badly bent.
Of course we know who’s blamed.
“Cough up some money,” is the cry;
“We must have L.S.D.
“If you can’t, the coffers empty,
“We ll just shut down the Quay”!
It’s sad but true that State works died;
But no flowers, by request—
May all their projects rest in peace.
Forget how they’ve been messed!
Mourn not for those who muddle
through.
Who bungle worse each day—
But wait till later time to let
The public have their say!
loin not the cortege of high hopes.
Send no flowers, by request—
Weep not for all the public works.
Launched with such verve and zest.
Erect a tombstone, if you may
Engrave -hereon this phrase—
“So much attempted, little done
Here lies the hopes they raise.’’
Hopes for a bigger, better State,
So wisely, sanely run.
With bustling towns, and thriving, and
Enough for every one!
Instead they’ve failed us dismally.
With fumbling manifest.
The State is dead, long live the State;
And no flowers, by request!
—R.W.

“A Challenge to
Management”
(Address delivered by Mr. James F.
Lincoln, President of The Lincoln
Electric Company, Cleveland, Ohio,
before a meeting of the Australian
Institute of Management, Sydney
Branch, on Tuesday, September 23,
1952.)
As a starting point in my talk to'
night, I want to state what the prob'
lem is that is facing industry today.
It is rather a hard thing for us to
recognise how far away we are from
reality. Therefore, I am going to
start out on this with the idea that
the man from Mars, who knows noth'
ing at all about the system here on
earth, is sent by the Martian people
to find out about our system—to find
out what it is that makes industry
tick, and what it is that has made it
the great thing that it is.
Well, he comes * over here and
makes a very thorough examination,
and goes back to Mars to make his
report. His first words are: “They
are all crazy. Can you imagine, first
of all, that all the people on earth
want to have a house, but when it
comes to building that house, the
people who do the building do every'
thing they can to build as few houses
as possible—and yet everybody wants
a house! You have a man who is lay'
ing bricks, for the sake of argument:
it costs about five times as much for
him to put a brick into the wall as
it does to make the brick and deliver
it to him. You have also the var'
ious trades that do the other work on
the house—the electricians, the plast-
erers, the painters, the carpenters and
the plumbers, each of whom is per'
forming a separate function—and you
find that it is impossible for one man
to do anything that interferes with
the work of the other, and that if a
plumber has to drive a nail, he can'
not even do that—he must call in a
carpenter. Therefore, the amount of
time that it takes to build the house
is tremendously lengthened and the
number of houses which can be built
is cut down to a very small minimum.
Therefore, relatively few people can
own a house because of the fact that
the price is too high, and also the
fact that there are not enough houses.
Now, all these earth people also want
automobiles, but when it comes to
building automobiles they have, first
of all, a primary arrangement where-
by the amount of building of auto-
mobiles that a man can do is very defi-
nitely limited. Therefore, it is im-
possible for him to do as much work
as he would like to do because the
amount he is allowed to do is cut
down by the rules of the governir
unions. Not only that, every so often
they go out on strikes and won’t do
anything at all, yet everybody wants
an automobile!
Then you occasionally have a situ'
ation in which a Nation will make a
large number of a particular product,
such as the Swiss, who make a very
large number of watches. Everybody
wants a watch and wants a good one,
but then when the Swiss want to sell
the watches, we will say to the Amer-
icans, the Government steps in and
says: ‘No, you can’t do that. If you
are going to have watches sold over
here, they have to be sold at two to
three times as high a price as you
would like to sell them for.’ There'
fore, the number of watches that
people can have is cut down by those
rules.
Also, we have the situation where
the Union Leader will say that any
scheme which will increase this out'
put of the various manufacturers is
bad; that it is called sweating; and
anybody who is put under the pres',
sure that would cause him to sweat
will only live a short time —he will
work himself to death. Therefore,
we must limit it —we cannot allow
any sweating. But these same people
will go out and play a football game
or some other kind of a game and
they will work to the extreme of their
vitality, and nobody seems to kick
about that. Talk about sweating!
They carry it to the extreme; but
nobody objects. And, again, you
have the mother of a family who.
perhaps, will have to work, at certain
times, the best part of 24 hours a
day. Nobody objects to that, and yet
it would seem to me that that would
be sweating carried to the limit.
Then you also have the situation
where, because of the jealousies which
are engendered by this limitation of
the exchange of goods between Na-
tions, you have a lot of wars, and
those wars cost so much that the
people on earth could buy these
houses and automobiles and every'
thing else with out the slightest diffi-
culty if they had not spent the money
for the war; but they go on having
wars and therefore eliminate the pos'
sibility of their having these things.
‘So,’ he says, ‘they are all crazy’.’’
I wonder —I am through with this
Martian now—l wonder if we ought
not to take a very careful new look
on this whole matter of Labour/Man-
agement relationships, and, most of
all, the responsibility that we all owe
to the economy.
Remember that we are under obli'
gations, it would seem to me, to do
the same thing that previous genera'
tions have doxie in advancing the ease
of life of man. We could not live
if we should go back to the situa'
tion as it existed 500 years ago. Even
a generation ago no one had an auto'
mobile. Two generations ago no one
had a telephone. Three generations
ago no one had modern medicine,
which has made all the difference in
the world in our length of life and
has eliminated most contagious dis'
eases. Four generations ago no one
had running water in his house or
bath'tub. Five generations ago no
one had freedom. Five generations
have done that for us, and have made
this world a paradise compared to
what they had.
Do we not have an obligation to
the oncoming generations to make
some contribution ourselves, to make
it a better place to live in, compared
to what it was when we came into it.
I wonder if we think of industry mere'
ly as something out of which we are to
make a profit. Profit is obviously es'
sential, but the real end of industry
is to build a better product, to be
sold at a lower price, to more people
that is what the preceding genera'
lions have done for us and we cer'
tainly cannot run out on our respon'
sibility to them.
This is not theory, this is fact.
When all want to work together for
the common end of building a better
product to be sold at a lower price,
what happens? In one case that I
can speak of with a certain amount
of authority, in the last eighteen years
they have reduced the number of
man'hours to produce a unit of pro-
duct by more than 90% —that means
that the same number of people can

{Here, at least, Moscow now takes a lead
over us, for no Australian city has ever
aspired to any building as ambitious as this,
nor have we seen a single city structure erected
and completed in the last 12 years.}

turn out more than ten times as much
of the same product in the length of
time. Therefore, it is obvious that
it is a better product sold for a lower
price.
By this change of attitude, the ne-
cessity for much of the overhead
costs, and a great many foremen, in-
spectors and people of that kind, is
eliminated; therefore, the amount of
product turned out is enormously in-
creased. Wages, that is the income
of the men who are involved in this
activity, would be more than doubled
The dividends to the company would
be continuous.
If all industry should adopt this
same responsibility to the consumer,
it is safe to say that the standard of
living for every man, woman and
child in the country or in the world,
who would be affected by it, would
be increased by more than four
In the first place, the income of the
worker is doubled. The price of the
product has been more than cut in
two. Therefore, the wages would buv
more than four times the amount of
product.
Now let us take the other advant
ages which fall from it. The first
is the satisfaction of the people in-
volved. Instead of there being a con-
tinuous war between so-called Labour
and so'called Management, there is a
feeling of accomplishment, the feeh
ing of doing something worthwhile,
the feeling of a job well done and
the feeling of ability in doing that
iob which all can respect, including
themselves.
If your job is one in which you
hate what you are doing, you have no
desire to perfect yourself in it.
If you set a goal and force your'
self to it, you will develop abilities far
bevond anything that you had before.
We have a great many Russians in
the United States who, in many cases,
have become outstanding citizens. If
they had remained at home with the
limitations on them that are inherent
in the Governments there, you know
perfectly well they could not have
risen. It is only because of the fact
that those people came to a land where
opportunity and challenge were pres'
ent that they became the individuals
they are.
After all, we in the United States
are a nation of displaced people; the
only real Americans there are the In'
dians. The rest of the people, or
most of them, came from Europe,
settled in the United States, and made
the colony there which has been out'
standing. But remember, their broth'
ers, their uncles, their cousins, all
those people remained in the old
country and did not rise. Now you
can’t tell me that it was the differ'
ence in the individuals themselves—
it was the difference in the opportun'
ity and the challenge.
Therefore, you have facing you
these problems:—What is going to
be the result on the people them'
selves? What is going to be the
result if work, on which we must de-
pend for the progress that the Nation
is to make, is going to be held in
light esteem, as something to be escap'
ed from, to do as little of as possible?
I cannot believe that anyone can view
the future, under those conditions, ex-
cept with a great deal of fear.
You here, we in the United States
—and it is true, I think, of most Na-
tions —are facing, at the present time,
a problem which will determine the
history of the world over the next
number of generations. That is, what
is to be the position of the individ'
ual? Is he to be a free man, or is
he to be a Government servant? Is
he to be somebody who is merely
looked at by Government as one of
those people that they take care of,
or is he going to be a person who
will be of outstanding importance in
his own right?
I think that we in the United
States, with the present Labour/Man-
agement friction which has been a
58
November 24, 1952.
BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


continually increasing factor, will have
to make a vital decision on this ques-
tion of the individual and his posi-
tion in relation to Government. Is
Government made for man, or is man
made for Government?
The one thing which is bringing
it to a head, at the present time, is this
continual friction that has been built
up to a greater and greater tempo, so
that we have, at the present time in
the United States, a half a dozen
people who, at their order, could
cause starvation inside of a week.
Now you know, and I know, that that
sort of thing cannot go on. The
people will not stand for leadership
which will condemn them to that
sort of a programme. There are two
ways that will answer the question.
One or the other must be chosen.
One of those ways is for Labour and
Management to accept the responsibil-
ity which seems to me to be so ob-
vious in the minds of everyone, that
is of building a better product, to be
sold at a lower price to more people:
doing it because they wish to work
together—they wish to get the advant-
ages which that will give them—they
wish to give those advantages to the
economy generally. And the other
answer is the one which we see illus-
trated pretty well in the totalitarian
countries in which the individual is
merely a Government servant who has
no power of his own, and no deci-
sion, and who, because of the domin-
ation of Government, will never de-
velop to the stature to which he could
develop if he were a free man with
the incentives which are inherent in
freedom.
We must go one way or the other.
We cannot stay where we are—which
shall it be?
The future waits with bated breath.
New Sarawak
Cathedral
A new cathedral is to be erected
at Kuching, principal town of Sara-
wak, North Borneo.
The structure, of English pattern,
will be built in reinforced concrete
with granite facing, and it will incor-
porate several attractive Eastern char-
acteristics in its elevations. It is
planned that the cathedral will re-
place the present building, badly dam-
aged during the fapanese occupation.
The new cathedral was designed by
Capt. C. W. Garton, partner in a
Liverpool firm of chartered architects.
Capt. Garton, whose firm has under-
taken much ecclesiastical structural
work in Liverpool, spent some time
in Borneo during the war when at-
tached to the Australian Forces.

Survey of Structure and Capacity.
“The Structure and Capacity of
Australian Manufacturing Industries,”
prepared by the Division of Industrial
Development in the Department of
National Development (500 foolscap
pages with index, suitably bound in
one volume. Price approximately
60/-. Available at Angus 6? Robert-
son.), endeavours to £oVer the whole
range of Australian manufacturing in-
dustries, seeking to establish a syste-
matic body of information embracing
firstly the organisation and interrelation
of enterprises and, secondly, the ade-
quacy of Australian production to meet
the market. It is presented under 17
broad industrial groups, each in turn
broken down to individual manufac-
turing activities.
The terrific expansion in Australian
basic industries now being undertaken
and which will be completed within
the next few years is detailed. The
doubling of capacity to win brown
coal, the 50 per cent, increase in capa-
city to win black coal, the 45 per cent,
increase in iron-making capacity, two-
thirds of which is almost completed,
the 100 per cent, and more increase in
copper production, the doubling of
paper and paper-board making capa-
city, the 25 per cent, increase in lead
and zinc capacity, the 50 per cent,
increase in cement - making capacity,
the doubling of electrical generating
capacity, and the doubling of capacity
to produce alkalis are cases in point.
Aluminium is to be produced in Aus-
tralia shortly in quantities commen-
surate with local requirements. The
sevenfold increase proposed in petro-
leum refining, the likely manufacture
of crawler tractors, the manufacture of
rayon yarn, the programmes of the
motor vehicle companies and the pro-
gress in the manufacture of heavy
transport, construction and excavating
equipment, in shipbuilding and aircraft
production, are notable. These de-
velopments will make a major contri-
bution to production, give a broader
base to the economy and assist in our
balance of payments problems.
The latest available statistics are
given in some profusion and generally
the market situation is assessed as at
mid-19 52.
The publication should be a valu-
able reference for those interested in
secondary industry, either as manufac-
turers or investors, particularly with
regard to the possibilities of extending
established, or commencing new, manu-
facture.
Four apnendices have been included
in the study, giving brief comment on
the services available to manufacture
in Australia, the methods of govern-
mental encouragement of industry, a
statistical summary. A detailed index,
including more than 10,000 references
to products, processes and manufacture
ing activities, is provided.
Masonite Presdwood
Attractive New Brochure.
The Masonite Corporation (Austra-
lia) Ltd. have produced an attractive
new brochure entitled “Masonite To-
day and Tomorrow”, which in com-
prehensive form has been designed to
serve as a permanent reference guide
for the proper method of installation
and the correct type of Presdwoods to
use. The publication which contains
24 pages, stresses in its many illustra
tions the multifarious uses of Mason-
ite: homes —inside and outside —bath-
rooms, bar and table tops, furniture,
caravans, motor bodies, display, con-
crete formwork, and numberless other
uses.
Special sections deal with its man-
ufacture, methods of painting and
finishing and the scientific re-afforesta-
tion policy that is being implemented
by the Corporation from their modern
plant at Raymond Terrace, N.S.W.
Those requiring copies of this use-
ful brochure should apply to The

CONCRETE HUTS WITHSTAND ATOM
BLAST.
Results of atom tests carried out last year
at Eniwetok Atoll are now being made avail-
able in respect of buildings erected to test
blast resistance. This type of pre-cast semi-
circular structure made of thin-shell ribbed
panels either welded or bolted together in
the shape of arches, domes, or gables, were
the most successful. When covered with
two feet of earth it is said that they may
be used as personnel shelters, safe from
blast and radiation at half a mile from ground
zero assuming a Japanese-type atomic explo-
sion.

Los Angeles Attacks
Parking Problem
41 Huge Garages Are Planned.
Revived interest in underground
parking stations for Sydney as a solu'
tion to the city’s many and major traf'
fic problems may lead to our city
fathers finally coming to their senses
and realising that progress must be
advanced and not retarded.
Other cities, plagued by growing
downtown parking problems, had re'
placed words by actions, and plati'
tudes by sensible planning.
Los Angeles, for example, has em-
barked on the construction of 41 mum
nicipal parking buildings, each four
storeys high.
Altogether they will provide off
street parking for 10,000 cars and
trucks at once.
The reason is the city’s £223 mil'
lion auto speedway system is boom'
eranging. Instead of relieving badly
congested inner city streets, it has
helped to accentuate the problem.
One underground garage is already
in operation, and the other 40 will
be above street level.
Each structure will be of four
storeys. The largest will cover a full
block and will take 2000 cars.
The first of the city'owned and op-
erated garages is the underground
parking station under Pershing Square,
an outdoor recreation park in mid'
town Los Angeles (approximately in
the same position as Wynyard Park
in Sydney). This has been in service
many years.
Trees, shrubs and statues —and over
100 birds —were removed from the
four'acre park to enable construction
to proceed. When the £22-J million
job was finished, all trees, shrubs, the
doves and the mocking birds, were
replaced.
Two traffie'eaused crises forced the
city parking project.
Major movement in and out of
downtown Los Angeles had slowed
painfully. It took over 40 minutes to
travel three or four miles. Business'
men felt the pinch, and shoppers, irk-
ed by delays, high traffic prices (and
very high traffic fines!) refused to
visit the city'centre stores.
Harassed beyond measure, they
went increasingly to shopping islands
that mushroomed in the suburbs, with
ample free parking. Downtown
merchants demanded a cure for the
city’s traffic ills, so Los Angeles and
the State of California jointly built
six, eight and 12dane speedways and
support speedways. Over these, the
first of which are completed, motor'
ists flash in and out of midtown with'
out loss of time.
But instead of alleviating traffic, it
has worsened in the city’s mile'square
shopping district. Thousands of
would'be shoppers, tired of trying to
park, kept out of the area. Others
were angered at dollar parking fees
charged during rush hours. The muni'
cipal garage plan is the city’s answer
to the problem.
The 40 garages will be mostly of
steel and concrete. Although simple
in design, they will not be eyesores,
but will conform to the city’s general
scheme of civic beautification. Pastel
colours will embellish their exteriors.
Highspeed elevators will whisk cars
to all floors. Most garages will be
open round the clock, except Sun'
days and holidays.
Footnote. —Proposal for a 3000 to
4000 car garage under Hyde Park
will be revived soon, Mr. Albert Wat'
son, managing director. Parking Fa-
cilities Ltd., Sydney, said in San Fran'
cisco recently that after an inspection
of underground parking in U.S.A. he
was convinced that the scheme was
commercially practicable.
Among the underground garages
Mr. Watson inspected was the new fa-
cility at Pershing Square, Los An'
geles, described in the above article.

Canada recently placed an order,
valued at £150,000 with the U.K.

ley) Ltd., Leeds, for the supply

and in northern Canadian goldfields
and the British Columbia timber
trade.
NEW METHOD OF FENCE-PAINTING.
Painters at the New Kensington works of the
Aluminium Co. of America cover a fence with
aluminium paint by pouring instead of
brushing. Panels fitted closely on each side
guide the paint down the wire as it is poured
while a moveable gutter at the bottom catches
the surplus paint.

High Building Costs
Contractor Cannot Solve Problem
Alone.
[The following remarks on high
building costs and excessive taxation
by the head of one of Britain’s larg'
est building contractors may well have
been addressed to conditions obtain'
ing in Australia today. In view of
its interest it is published herewith.
—Ed.J
In his statement presented at the
forty'ninth annual general meeting of
the company held recently, Mr. E. B.
Beck, chairman, John Mowlem and
Co. Ltd., referred to the serious ef'
fects of rising costs. He said the con'
tractor could not solve the problem
alone. It was a matter for the whole
industry, and one which had to be
considered by the trade unions and
the manufacturers and merchants who
supplied materials to the industry.
Rising costs was a factor which re-
quired serious notice for indications
were appearing that they might be
reaching a level at which the owner
was seriously concerned with the
economic wisdom of proceeding with
schemes of capital renewals or extern
sions.
“With the highly competitive prices
for work today, there is no margin
so far as the contractor is concerned,
for him to bear the rises in costs,
and he is therefore obliged to pass
them on to those employing him,”
said Mr. Beck.
“If this trend in prices is not ar-
rested, it must eventually result in a
reduction of the work available to all
engaged in civil engineering and build'
ing.
Taxation and Prices.
“The inflationary movement in all
prices which this country has expert
enced and is still experiencing is obvi'
ously closely linked with excessive tax'
ation, which is mainly used by th -
Government to meet day'tO'day rev'
enue expenditure. On the other hand,
taxation is levied on industry before
allowing proper provision for the re'
placement of assets and on the indi'
vidual in the form of very high
death duties, a direct tax on capital.”

Points About
Concreting
Sand, Aggregate, Water, Formwork.
By JAMES GREEN.
Nowadays concrete is a very com'
tmonly used material—in fact, it is so
tfamiliar to all builders that many do
mot realise how many snags there are
sin its mixing and placing, so simple
:and usual does it seem to be.
Cements to'day are of good quality,
;and generally give results superior to
Ithe conditions laid down by the
[British Standard specifications, so
Ithere is very little danger of cement
(giving trouble if it is properly stored
rprior to use.
Cement absorbs moisture very easily
[from the atmosphere, so it must be
(stored in a dry place, preferably on
[raised boards if there is any chance
•of damp rising from the floor.
•Cement should be examined before
fuse to see if there are any hard lumps
•of set material. Bags in which these
;are found should be rejected.
Sand should be quite clean, coarse
land welhgraded. The main thing in
;a good concrete is a proper bond be'
Itween the component parts, and this
•cannot happen if the sand is dirty—
•or, for that matter, if the larger ag'
gregate is dirty.
It is quite easy to see whether sand
iis dirty. Just rub it between the
hands, and if it stains it is dirty. A
(better idea is to put some in a glass
with water and see how much cloudy
[material, clay or loam, settles out.
This should be very small compared
with the sand.
The sand shoud be coarse for two
reasons: Firstly, if it is fine, more
cement will be needed to cover it;
;and, secondly, if it is fine, it will take
longer to mix properly. Good sand
for concreting is quite different from
[good building sand in this question
iof coarseness.
Grading is very important. In
concrete a solid mass can only be
obtained by using materials of diT
ferent sizes. The coarse aggregate,
or chippings, when lying together,
leave open spaces which must be par'
Itially filled by coarse sand.
The coarse sand, in turn, leaves
spaces or voids, which must be filled
with fine sand. Thus the sand must
consist of particles of all sizes, but the
coarse should predominate for the
reasons above.
When all the particles fit in with
each other like this, they leave little
space to be filled by cement.
Many people say that a good sand
for concreting should be “sharp”—
or that the particles of which it is
composed should have sharp corners
and not be round. However, it has
been found that concrete made with
sand which is round is just as strong
as that which is made with “sharp”
particles.
In point of fact it is very difficult
to obtain sand which has not been
rounded to a certain extent by the
action of erosion.
“Concrete cannot be stronger than
its coarse aggregate” is a common
saying, and it indicates the truth that
cement is primarily used to bind to'
gether and not to give strength.
There are many different kinds:
granite, sandstone, limestone; flint
gravel from a pit; shingle from the
sea'shore or a river, usually referred
to as ballast. Granite is always safe,
but some sandstones and limestones
are not reliable, especially those of
more recent geological age.
Good Aggregate.
A good aggregate must, like a good
sand, be clean and welhgraded.
3'l6in. is a usual minimum size for
coarse aggregate, the maximum size
depending on the type of work.
Broken bricks are frequently used
as aggregate, in some cases with sue-
cess, but care should be taken to
watch certain points. All plaster
should be carefully removed, and the
bricks should be soaked in water prior
to use to prevent water being absorb'
ed from the concrete which is re'
quired to complete the setting of the
cement.
A good idea is to make enquiries
to see whether a particular type of
brick has been successfully used, since
some bricks contain chemical com'
pounds which are injurious to con'
crete, and without a proper analysis
it is impossible to determine their
constitution.
Broken stones, such as granite or
gravel, are always safe provided they
are clean and welhgraded.
If the materials are all right, the
next point to watch is the mixing.
The keynote of success in this is
thoroughness. It is best to mix dry
first of all until a uniform colour is
obtained, and then add water after'
wards.
The water should not be thrown on
all at once, but should be added
gradually from a watering'can with a
rosehead. The whole mix must be
turned over and over until a uniform
mix is obtained.
Concrete may be mixed either by
hand or in a machine. If done by
hand and a clean level floor is not
available, it is advisable to make a
mixing board from tongue and groove
flooring and 4in. x 2in. battens.
It is most essential to keep away
from the mix all foreign materials,
and this, incidentally, should apply to
the sand and gravel, which should be
stored on clean ground.
The materials are best measured in
wooden measuring boxes for small
jobs, but in larger jobs the fact that
a wheelbarrow has a capacity of 2i
cubic feet is sufficient to proportion
materials. A bag of cement has a
volume of cubic feet; thus one
bag of cement to one barrow of sand
and two of gravel would be a 1 : 2 :
4 mix measured by volume.
Not all concrete works are proper'
tioned by volume. Proportioning by
weight is more accurate than by
volume. One reason for this is that
a very slight increase in the amount
of moisture in sand is sufficient to in'
crease its volume, or “bulk,” by as
much as 30 per cent.
Thus, if proportioned by volume,
less sand would be contained in the
mix than is specified; whereas if pro'
portioned by weight, the error would
not occur since the slight increase in
moisture would produce little change
in weight.

A strange fact about this increase
in the volume of a given weight of
sand is that when completely covered
with water sand occupies practically
the same volume as it does when it is
bone dry.
A very important point in the pro'
portions of a mix is the amount of
water added, or the water/cement
ratio. If the water/cement ratio is
as 1.0 by weight, it means that 11.2
gallons of water, or 1121 b., are to be
used with lewt. of cement. Water/
cement ratios of from .5 to .7 are
usual.
Generally speaking, the lower the
water/cement ratio, the stronger the
concrete, provided it can be properly
placed in all cavities without leaving
any spaces.
Another way of expressing this
ratio is by the number of gallons of
water per cwt. of cement. If it is
found that a mix cannot be placed so
that it will fill all cavities, it is better
to increase the sand content, rather
than increase the water/cement ratio.
The water must be reasonably pure
to ensure good concrete. Many
authorities insist that the water shall
be fit for drinking. This is a wise
precaution, since it automatically rules
out any possibility of dangerous sub'
stances.
Provided the mixing is carried out
thoroughly in the right proportions
and with good material, the next
stage which may cause trouble is the
placing. Concrete must always be
thoroughly tamped down so that all
the spaces in the formwork are filled
and the concrete itself is without air
spaces.
To achieve this, when any great
thickness is being laid, it is essential
to tamp small depths at a time. It
is no use putting in about a foot of
concrete at a time and then tamping;
six inches at the very most should be
placed, and then tamped. A good
tamper is formed by a 6in. x 6in.
piece of timber.
Concrete should be placed as soon
as it has been mixed, for several
reasons, the chief being that the
chemical action of hardening is thus
interfered with as little as possible.
It also gives the maximum amount
of time for tamping since, after its
initial set, which occurs about thirty
minutes after mixing, concrete should
not be moved at all. If concrete is
left lying about in barrows or skips
after mixing it tends to harden and
be difficult to work.
If concreting is being continued on
top of old work this must be
thoroughly hacked, brushed, watered,
and then grouted before the new
concrete is placed. This will ensure
a good key.
Where a joint is horizontal, it is a
good plan to place a piece of wood
half'sunk in the old concrete w’hich
is removed after setting, and when
the next stage is placed there is a
key already formed to assist in making
a sound joint. This is particularly
useful where there is a horizontal
flow of water.
Formwork.
Good formwork is another essem
tial part of good concreting. The
usual material, timber, is, of course,
very hard to get hold of, and often
it is necessary to make out with old
wood, which is not really good
enough. However, time spent on
making good solid formwork is time
well spent, especially if it can be
used again.
In large projects it is often pos'
sible to economise in timber by de'
signing standard pieces of formwork
which can be struck repeatedly, and
if rapid'hardening Portland cement is
used, this process of reusing form'
work is facilitated.
Aluminium sheeting is one method
of getting a smooth finish if rough
timber has to be used.
After the placing in position, the
next point which needs great care is
proper covering. For concrete to dc'
velop to its full strength it must be
kept wet during the period of setting
and hardening.
This is especially important in hot
weather, when there is a lot of sun'
shine, or whenever there is a drying
wind. Concrete is best protected by
hessian, waterproof covers, earth or
sand, or by waterproof paper. It is
advisable to spray the shuttering with
water in very dry weather, since a lot !
of water can escape in this way.
Provided the precautions mentioned
above are carried out, good concrete
may reasonably be expected as a re'
suit.

More Licenses For
U.K. Homes
Britons who want to build their
own homes, may now go ahead, if
labour is available where they want
to build.
This is part of the U.K.’s “build'
more'homes” drive, and Housing Min'
ister Macmillan has asked local auth'
orities for the number of extra licenses
—above their quotas —applied for.
The principal regional officers, who
know what building labour is avail'
able in the areas will, on that basis,
inform the local authorities how many
extra licenses they can have this year.
These extra licenses will not affect
the quotas of local authorities, as
there are builders and building work'
ers free in many districts to build
these homes.
Mr. Macmillan is anxious that their
services should not be unused through
lack of licenses.
CURVES AND ANGLES.
The contemporary style is certainly not static;
it will try anything once. The upper design
is for an airfield building and with the ex-
cept on of the connecting access corridor there
is literally nothing straight in it, the sinuous
curve being the dominant motif. Below, on
the contrary, harsh angularity is the order
of design. A harsh contrast is made be-
tween the honeycomb infilling to the garage
which is carried right up to the corner
where it has been cut off like a piece of
cheese holes notwithstanding and the large
scale vertical louvres in the other section of
the structure, the front portion of which in-
dulges in the wold present-day delight in
cantilevering as much as possible.

Housing Lists
Need For Pruning Seen.
Five London Boroughs recently ap'
pointed an advisory committee to make
a survey of how their housing
schemes are run.
These London councils control
89,300 properties, with 115,000 fam'
ilies on their waiting lists.
The report stresses that these wait'
ing lists are so large that only a
small proportion of the applicants can
be housed in the forseeable future.
The clerical work involved in main'
taining these lists is costing some
councils between £5OOO and £lO,OOO
a year.
And the report adds: “There ap'
pears little justification for all the
clerical work required to maintain
office records for a large proportion
of the average waiting list.
The advisory committee spent four
months on the survey, and found
that:
• Only one'third of applicants had
urgent need of new accommodation;
another third have some case; the
balance have no real need.
• Homes are usually allotted on a
points system, with a large number
awarded for overcrowding.
• A larae proportion of applicants
therefore don’t qualify. Unless their
circumstances change, they will, in
fact, never be rehoused.
Two Suggestions.
Among two suggestions for cutting
administrative costs made by the sur'
vey are:
• Fortnightly rent collections on
“selected estates” despite the dislikes
of weekly wage'earners.
• “Rent'free” weeks over Christmas
and August Bank Holiday weeks,
with a small increase for the remain'
ing 50 weeks of the year.

The New Lebanon
Airport
Lebanon, with its 1,250,000 inhab'
itants, has been busy on its new
airport. It has just spent over £ls,'
000,000 on making it one of the finest
in the world. The other five exceed'
ing it are Orly (Paris), Heathrow
(London), Schithol (Amsterdam),
Kloten (Zurich), and the Internation'
al Airport at New York.
In March, 1952, twenty'Six airlines
made 1548 flights to Lebanon carry'
ing 14,783 passengers from France,
Brazil, Japan, S. Africa, Australia,
Iraq and other countries.
Each runway is 7,845 feet. The
concrete is 12 inches thick. Parking
area covers 1,100,000 square feet.
The Air Terminal Building will be
660 feet long by 99 feet wide.
The airport is equipped with the
most modern system of lighting, radio
communications including I.L.S. (In'
strument Landing System), and radar.
During the Second World War it
was the lot of the Australian Army
Engineers to build the coastal rail'

Britain’s New Schools
Important Contribution to
Contemporary Architecture.
Professor R. P. Cummings, Profes-
sor of Architecture at the University
of Queensland, who is at present
abroad on six months study, writes
enthusiastically about the new British
Schools, which he says, besides fulfill'
ing an urgent educational need, make
an important contemporary architect'
ural contribution in their variety,
freshness and good appearance.
The British Education Act of 1944
has resulted in the implementation of
a huge post-war school building pro'
gramme.
The urgent need for housing de'
layed the full commencement of the
programme until the end of 1946, but
during the last six and a half years
a large number of schools of all types
have been completed in different parts
of the country and at present there
are some hundreds of schools in
course of construction.
The size of the programme is due
to the raising of the school leaving
age to 15, war damage, and an in'
crease in the birth-rate.
Hot Mid-day Meals.
Also, the decision to provide hot
mid-day meals in all new schools
meant the addition of large rooms for
dining and for cooking and prepara-
tion.
The actual designing and erection
of British schools is mainly vested in
the architectural departments of the
various county councils. The stand-
ards of accommodation for the num-
ber of different rooms, and spaces
which combine to make a complete
school are laid down by the central
Ministry of Education.
The exigencies of space in the more
densely populated areas of London
have called for multi-storeyed build-
ings.
In the less densely populated coun-
ties such as Hertfordshire, ample open
sites are not difficult to find. The
result is that most schools in these
places, especially those for primary
school children, are rightly planned
on one floor level.
A number of private architects are
also employed. The architectural sec-
tion of the Ministry of Education is
building a limited number of special
experimental schools.
Great Variety of Design.

STEEL FRAMEWORK
Presweld is suitable for most types of buildings
and, in addition, offers considerable economies in
material, money and man-hour erection time. The
FLEXIBILITY of this system is particularly evi-
dent in modem school construction, where Presweld
Components are being extensively used. Based
on the 8’ 3” grid, buildings of almost any size
and number of storeys can be plotted from standard
parts. In conjunction with the framework, Hills
also supply metal window and door frames, gutters,
fascias and Hilcon lightweight precast reinforced

ed from a study of these new schools
is the great variety of design in evi'
dence and the degree of change which
has taken place during the period in
which the scheme has been in opera'
tion.
The introduction of new materials
and of new building methods which
differ greatly from those traditionally
employed has changed the expression
and appearance of many new schools.
Standardised Units.
The Hertfordshire County Council
is building schools based on construe'
tion systems composed of standardised
units, which go together in a number
of ways. It is a flexible system, hav"
ing a light steel frame, made up in
the factory and fitting together on the
site somewhat like a huge meccano
set. The walls, floors, and roofs are
in panels of concrete or other suitable
materials which are prepared away
from the site and are readily fixed to
the steel frame.
Free Use of Colour.
Much experimentation has gone on
in its use both internally and extern-
ally.
On first acquaintance some of the
colours used appear rather startling,
but one quickly becomes accustomed
to them.
Under new school contracts, allow-
ance is made for the expenditure of a
limited amount of money on good
mural decorations while some scuh
pture is also used,
Natural lighting is scientifically cah
culated to give the best possible dis-

that Bleyer and Co. were sacking men

They arranged to produce five tons
of blue annealed mouse'trap steel for

U.K. HOMES “PRIMITIVE
IN THE EXTREME”.
What The Census Reveals.
The British Registrar'General’s
sample analysis of census forms filled
in last year, gives illuminating side'
lights on life in Britain today.
It reveals that thousands of homes
are “primitive in the extreme.”
Last year’s census sought, for the
first time, to make a survey of what
may be called the working equipment
of British homes. It reveals that the
women in 945,000 British households
have to share the sink with others,
while the women in 905,000 other
homes have no sink at all.
Many people today think of the old
zinc bath by the kitchen stove as a
relic of the distant past, but out of
14.481.000 British households 5,436,'
000, or 37? per cent., still have no
fixed bath. Over 1 million other
homes share a bath.
Figures also disclose that 791,000
households still share a stove, and
3 34,000 houses have no stove at all.
There are also 810,000 homes with'
out piped water, 1,639,000 sharing it;
1.114.000 with no water'doset, 2,'
179.000 with sharing arrangements.

The city of Casablanca gained importance dur-

rapidly. We illustrate the new airport build-
ing that is very modern in conception, par-
ticularly the very unusual control tower. Be-
low is the facade of a new apartment house in
this city in which the horizontal members
form a “brisc-soleil” or sun-break to protect
the verandahs behind.

METHODS OF SUN PROTECTION.
Two methods of protecting the interior of
buildings from the direct rays of the sun
are illustrated in these two photographs.
Above the desired result is achieved by slop-
ing vertical concrete fins supporting horizontal
members at appropriate heights to afford shelt-
er from the sun as desired according to the
period of the year. Below is an internal
view of a huge “brise-soleil” a sun visor
consisting of metal adjustable louvres in a
building in Morocco. Whilst other nations
take shelter from the burning rays of the
sun, we, in Australia, go “bald headed for
it” on the beaches and elsewhere irrespective
of whether it gives us skin cancers or not
or affects our sight, though a few have the
good sense to wear glare glasses.

TIMBER AND STONE.
The appropriate choice of materials for a house and the use of different materials in relation to each other is
where experience and taste is a vital quality. The use of stone laid in random rubble in the simple timber
cottage in the bottom left is particularly appealing, just as the wide clapboards in the one above seem to be par-
ticularly American in feeling. Timber again is utilised in the more pretentious two-storey house—rather severe
and Georgian in the bottom right, while stuccoed brickwork with colourful tiles on the roof provide the appeal
of the top right example.

STARVE FOR FOOD OR
HOUSES?
Britain Faces Strange Dilemma.
One of the most fantastic dilemmas
which any nation has ever faced con'
fronts Britain from two vital points—
food and housing.
To satisfy Britain’s home'hungry
population, something like 2,000,000
more houses are needed. But Britons
must eat as well, and consequently the
nation can only spend portion of its
time and energy building houses.
The rate at which the British Gov'
ernment is building homes —110,964
were completed in 12 months up to
June 30 of this year—has raised ser'
ious possibilities in some quarters.
Some authorities believe that if the
building rate is stepped up to
300,000 a year Britain may face a
crisis.
According to reliable reports, it is
difficult for experts to work out, pre'
cisely, just how much of British time
and money can safely be devoted to
house building, without interfering
with food production and the export
drive.
Professor Stephenson, Professor of
Civic Design at Liverpool University,
claims that 200,000 houses a year is
all the nation can afford.
That is a higher rate of building
than Belgium and Holland have been
able to afford since the war.
Logically, if a man is working on
house construction he can’t be build'
ing anything else, such as schools,
shops, or factories where goods for
export can be manufactured.
Timber Stocks Decrease.
To achieve the 300,000'houses'per'
year target calls for an extra
£18,000,000 worth of timber imports.
The U.K. Board of Trade, aware
that Britain cannot possibly increase
its exports this year, has advised that
all imports should be cut to the bone.
Consequently, house construction
will suffer, in common with other in'
dustries.
The spectacular spurt in housing
has made great inroads into existing
timber stocks, and will increase the
British import bill in 1953.
An economist at the Hull Univers'
ity College, Professor Bowen, describes
the prospect as “dangerous”.
Other imports and exports are aT
fected. More pulp, scrap, plaster'
board, linseed oil and carbon black
are needed. Less paint, cement, stoves
and prefabs can be exported for the
dollars Britain urgently requires.
Conflict of Views.
To enable houses to be built, other
types of building have been slowed
down. This has led to a conflict
of views between the Ministry of
Housing and the Ministry of Works.
• On the one hand, the Ministry
of Housing is reported as saying that
its policy is not to take labour and
materials which are needed for indus'
trial construction.
• On the other hand, the Minis'
try of Works claims that the present
reduction in factory building is due,
at least partly, to the priority that
had been given to houses.
• The houses now being built are
economical in material, being smaller
than those built by the Atlee Gov'
ernment. They need fewer bricks.
Danger Seen.
But building experts say there is
grave danger in this economy.
• Instead of lead or zinc being
used for roof and window flushing
felt is now being used extensively.
• This felt, it is claimed, remains
damp'proof for from 10 years to 20
years—no longer.

• Such an economy may make
Britain’s housing replacement problem
continuous for many years to come.
Flats, Smaller Houses.
To meet the crisis in materials and
manpower experts advise that old
buildings should be split into small
flats on a vaster scale than has been
hitherto attempted.
They also say that new houses under
construction should be built in proper*
tion to family sizes.
Proof of this need was found in
last year’s British Census, economists
and statisticians say.
The Census disclosed that the exist*
ing houses in the U.K. are hopelessly
under*inhabited. For instance:
• Too many single people have
four rooms to themselves;
• Too many old couples live alone
in great, rambling Victorian houses.
• Many owners of huge homes
would gladly move into more com*
pact houses.
• Childless couples prefer flats to
houses.
Thus housing authorities are hav*
ing this inevitable conclusion thrust

HUGE AIR VENTS.
On the right is one of the huge concrete air-
vents that dominate the top of the enormous
block of flats just being completed at Mar-
seilles to the design of M. Le Corbusier.
The building is raised on huge concrete but-
tress-like legs one storey off the ground and
the ventilation forms are located on the un-
derside of the first floor and two great air
ducts run through the entire height of the
centre of the building, to expel the vitiated
air through these great vents carried high
above the roof.
NEW WELDED ROOF TYPES.
In the upper illustration we see the world’s
largest saucer-type dome, which is on the
Jordan Marsh store near Boston, U.S.A. It
has a diameter of 225 ft. and is formed by
36 welded steel ribs each 110 ft. long. The
erection time of this dome was 12 weeks.
Ring girders 36in. deep and weighing 300
lb. per sq. ft. were installed round the base
of the building to support the big steel ribs
which meet at the top of the dome in a 14ft.
hub. A 60ft. tower was erected to raise the
ribs and weld them to the hub at the centre.
A BRAZILIAN FACTORY.
An arched roof has been made from welded
trusses made from reinforcing rods bent to
shape. It will be noted that the arch-mem-
bers are triangular in section and joined in
pairs.

OTIS
The building and its function must deter-
mine the type and design of vertical
transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Otis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators —because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in
vertical transportation.

LIGHT FROM THE ATOM.
A U.S. scientist has managed to
“freeze” light, stopping it as it sped
away from the camera at a speed of
186,000 miles a second.
The scientist used a special camera
with the incredibly fast speed of one
hundred'millionth of a second. The
shutter speed of an ordinary box'
camera is l/25th of a second.
The photograph of light produced
showed a discontinuous series of lunv
inous points which are the actual
units of radiant energy of which light
is made up.
Light is one of the most important
things in our lives, but only recently
has the process by which it is gener'
ated been discovered.
Origin of Light.
It is what scientists call an electro'
magnetic radiation. In order to pro'
duce such a radiation electricity must
oscillate, that is, move to and fro like
the swing of a pendulum or the vi'
bration of a spring.
These oscillations derive from
atoms. An atom consists of minute
particles called electrons bearing a
charge of negative electricity. These
circle round a positively charged
centre or nucleus like the planets
round the sun.
When the atom receives energy,
as may happen, for instance, when it
collides with another atom, an elec'
tron will be pushed out of its orbit
and become farther away from the
nucleus, only to return to its original
place a fraction of an instant later. In
other words, it oscillates, and this
movement inside the atom is now
known to be the origin of light waves.
Greatest marvel of light is its speed.
A light beam can travel round the
earth in less time than a car going
at 60 m.p.h. can move in its own
length.
SOMETHING WRONG
SOMEWHERE?
Who won the war? German muni'
tiommaker Alfred Krupp has had his
name placed on a £30,000,000
cheque. Thousands of young men
have had their names placed on war
memorials as a result of Herr Krupp’s
munitions. Germany is now selling
food to England.
NEW DAM FOR HONG KONG.
Before the year ends, work will be'
gin on a new 1000 ft. long and 150
ft. high concrete dam, the most im'
portant part’ of the Hong Kong Gov*
ernment’s new waterworks project in
the Tai Lam Chung Valley in the
New Territories.
This structure will dam 1150 mil'
lion gallons of accumulated water
when the new Tai Lam Chung reser'
voir is full, will take an estimated
three years to build and will contain
200 thousand cubic yards of concrete.
It will be faced with pre'cast concrete
blocks and be filled with mass con'
Crete.
Tenders closed in October for this
main dam—and a subsidiary dam an'
ciliary works.
PRESERVING KENT'S
WINDMILLS.
Historic and Architectural Value.
Kent County Council has now
made orders for the preservation of
eleven windmills because they are con-
sidered to be of special architectural
interest. They are at Ash, Berham,
Charing, Cranbrook, Goodnestone,
Herne, Keston, Meopham, West
Kingsdown, Willesborough and Wit'
tersham. Another windmill at Wood'
church is already protected by the
Ministry of Works as an ancient mom
ument.

Tin Mining In Malaya
A new channel for the Kinta River,
Malaya, which meanders through an
alluvial valley containing the richest
deposits of tin in the world, is to be
cut by interested tin mining compan-
ies. Hitherto a wide reserve had to
be kept free from mining on each
side of the river bed in order to pre'
vent damage to the main drainage
channel.
The new channel, 17 miles long,
able to carry 10,000 cubic feet of
flood waters per second, will enable
a strip of 44 yards along either bank
to be made available for mining.
This will be equal to the old river
bed and provides an area of 1,240
acres containing approximately 20,000
tons of metallic tin.
Does your husband live up to his
promise in courtship days?
Yes: He then said he was not good
enough for me and he’s been proving
it ever since.
ROOF AND BUILDING SERVICE
PTY. LTD.
The flat roof to the remodelled
premises of Conrick Tomalin Pty.
Ltd. in York Street and featured in
this issue on pages 20 and 21 was
executed by Roof and Building Ser'
vice Pty. Ltd. of 70 King St., Sydney
(phone BX 1431).
The cellconcrete is' poured in situ
and serves the dual purpose of grad'
ing and insulating the roof in one
operation.
PLANTS AND PIPES.
The two dominant motives in this modern
interior are the continuous flower-boxes sunk
level with the floor and the unduly spindly
pipe framework to the couch and table screen,
so as not to blot out the view of the
garden which arrangement separates one sec-
tion of the interior from the other. The
floor appears to be on a raised dais floating,
as it were, in a garden—all encompassed with-
in the outer walls of glass.

THE CHARM OF THE ATTIC
There is undoubtedly something about an attic; the sloping roof and the quaint dormer windows seem to engender
a feeling of smugness and intimacy that is lacking in the full-size room. In the decade prior to World War II.
many fine houses built around Sydney employed the principle with distinct success and there are fine examples
on the lines shown in these three to be seen amongst the foliage of the North Shore line. It will be noticed that
the upper right example is entirely of timber construction and this style lends itself admirably to this material; the
bottom right on the other hand confines itself to timber gables only, while upper left is all in brick. Bottom left
is a useful little plan on the L-shape in the angle of which is entrapped morning and Northern sunshine.
