Away back in 1912
"United" Paint was first manufac-
tured under this brand at Port Adelaide.
Ever since that date the "United" brand has stood for
every good quality that is required in paint. Its popularity with ?
both trade and consumer is directly due to the "United" policy
which simply is. The best materials and the best manufacturing
methods." "United" is truly the "Pre-tested" Paint. That is why
this paint has, over four decades, won a reputation surely

It seems odd to bracket
something “as big as a

thing as a nail or a wood
screw. But without these

to “call a home his own”

EXTRACT FROM OFFICIAL REPORT:
"Tests carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, Division of Economic Entomology, towards the end of
1947, proved that Masonite Presdwood. containing a minimum of
0.5% w/w. of Pentachlorophenol, was termite-resistant. These tests
employed Eutermes exitiousus and Coptotermes lacteus, typical
representatives of two of the most destructive groups of termites
in Australia.
"Treated Masonite was found to be superior to cypress pine
(Callitris glauca) in its resistance to termite attack. (Cypress pine
is commonly regarded as being termite-proof.) Samples of mountain
ash (Eucalyptus regnans) tested under similar conditions were
completely destroyed by the termites."

The thin armour plating of a fish’s
scales is the best protection that
nature can offer for the purpose. It
is effective because of its smooth
surface and overlapping of its tiny
scales. A similar arrangement is found
in “Alpaste,” the aluminium paint pig-
ment, whereby minute flat particles of
pure aluminium overlap to form a
metallic film with protective and durable
qualities. This “leafing” property of the
pigment gives aluminium paint much of
its durability, moisture resisting qualities,
opacity, power4o reflect light and heat and
resistance to smoke and fumes.
“Alpaste” paint pigment is widely used
for the protection of weather exposed
surfaces of all types —industrial, commercial
or for the home. Bridges, transport vehicles,
ships and factories are also benefiting
owing to the unique properties of aluminium
paint.

BRONZE MEMORIAL DOORS TO DAVID SCOTT MITCHELL, DONATED BY THE LATE
SIR WILLIAM DIXSON.
The subject of the centre pair of doors illustrated above is the discovery and exploration of Australia by land and
sea. The surface is divided into panels, eight smaller ones on either side of the doors and a larger one beneath
each group of eight. On the left hand, side the smaller panels bear portraits of the Spanish, Dutch and English
Navigators who first chartered our coasts, while on the right are portraits of those who explored the interior of
the continent. The lowest panel on the left represents the ships Adventure and Resolution, with which Captain
James Cook sailed on his second voyage to the South Seas. The lowest panel on the right hand side represents
Tasman’s ships Heemskerck and Zeehaan, with which he made his historic voyage in 1642-43, discovering Tasmania
and New Zealand. Sculptor was Dr. Fleischman. The smaller doors on both sides of this central unit arc also
divided into panels each representing scenes of Australian aboriginal life.

ident, Mr. J. B. Hawkins, took the
opportunity of warmly welcoming all
delegates to Perth.
Mr. Hawkins voiced the sincere
wish that both delegates and their
womenfolk would spend a happy and
memorable week in enjoying to the
full the beauties of the West.
Upon arrival of the Minister, Mr.
Hawkins spoke of the pleasure it gave
him to welcome Mr. Wild “who is
well known to the people of W.A.
for his work in providing homes for
them.”
Mr. Wild had faced up to the great
social problem of building homes for
the people, Mr. Hawkins continued.
“I will say this for the Minister:
The men in charge of Building Ma-
terials Controls Act are fair, and give
every consideration to builders.
“We are very satisfied with the
Government which represents the

people here in W.A.", Mr. Hawkins
added.
In opening the Convention, the
Housing Minister, Mr. Wild, apologis-
ed for the absence of the Premier Mr.
McLarty.
“Monday is Cabinet Day, and it
was impossible for the Premier to get
away,” Mr. Wild said.
“May I say at the outset that I
am more than pleased to have the op-
portunity of performing this func-
tion," he continued.
“Since being Housing Minister I
have lived with the housing problem
night and day, and half the time I
don’t sleep wondering how we can
build more houses than at present,"
said Mr. Wild.
He paid a tribute to the “terrific
job that Master Builders have done
throughout Australia, and their ap-
proach to post-war problems."
In W.A., he pointed out, the co-
operation of builders, merchants, and
trade unions had put the State in an
“exalted position, and had done a
magnificent job."
He referred to the fine service rend-
ered by Mr. j. B. Hawkins as repre-
senting the M.B.A. on the State Hous-
ing Commission, adding that he al-
ways gave a sound, reasoned opinion
on all building matters.
Mr. Wild said he noticed on the
agenda reference to ways and means
of speeding home-building.
He said that W.A. pre-war had
built approximately 2000 homes a
year, with a peak year total of 2500,
Last year just over 6000 homes were
built.
“In the last financial year 6570
homes were built, and in the year
ending June 30, 7600 houses were un-
der construction," he added.
Mr. Wild said he advocated adop-
tion of a balanced building pro-
gramme. He pointed out that in
W.A. controls had been gradually eas-
ed into industry, and permits were
now being granted for big city build-
ings.
The Act now before Parliament
would give a small measure of control
over very large buildings but all hous-
ing was completely free, the Minister
said.
“It was considered wise to keep a
little hold over construction of very
large buildings,” he added.
W.A. was mainly short of cement,
Mr. Wild told the Convention. There
was a desperate shortage of this com-
modity, and it was necessary to im-
port supplies from overseas to main-
tain the status quo—about 50 per cent,
of cement requirements have to come
from outside the State.
“Thus it is necessary to retain a
little grip on construction through
the Building Materials Control Act,”
he said.
Regarding population growth, the
Minister told delegates that there had
been a great build up of population
in W.A. in the last two years.
“It amounted to 2.7 per 1000;
even japan could only boast a popu-
lation increase of 1.7 per 1000," Mr.
Wild pointed out.
To speed up the turn-round of ship-
ping and to get in extra trips, the
Commonwealth Government has dis-
gorged a tremendous flow of migrants
into the State.
“Twenty-one thousand migrants
have come to a big State with a
small population," he said.
“The increase is now something
over 5 per cent., and the building in-
dustry had something to face up to,”
Mr. Wild added.
He said he felt the occasion was
fitting to- throw something into the
ring constructively which would ap-
ply to everyone.
“In 1952 we have reached a stage
where we face a real challenge to
private enterprise.
“Some overseas countries are show-
ing a tendency to turn left, and there
appears a tendency for the building
industry to turn in the same direc-
tion.
“There is a tendency to rely more
and more on Government enterprise
to the exclusion of private enterprise,
which was the only way in which Aus-
tralia was made great." (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Wild said that since 1827,
W.A. had been built up “by guts and
courage of the pioneers, with their
spirit, courage and grit.
“Only they made it possible for us
to be here to-day," he added.
Speaking of the tendency of all
countries to turn slightly left, the
Minister deplored the Australian ten'
dency to do as little as possible for as
much money as possible.
He appealed to the Convention to
endeavour to keep costs down, and
devise means to inculcate in each em-
ployee the need for greater product-
ivity.
"If we are to survive we must go
with the stream a little and then edge
off."
But, he warned, Australia will not
get back to where it was before.
“The spirit that made Australia
great is greatly needed today.
“The answer is Productivity—in-
creased production, with a levelling—-
out of costs.
“Everybody says today what he
would do with less taxation, more
hours in the week," Mr. Wild said.
“But employers should strive to
instil into the working men of Aus-
tralia the need for greater productiv-
ity, by their working harder and
speeding up production of all essen-
tials," the Minister concluded, amid
applause.
After the president, Mr. Hawkins,
thanked the Minister for his very in-
spiring address, the Senior Vice-Pres-
ident, Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic.), mov-
ed a vote of thanks on behalf of all
delegates.
He paid a tribute to the high esteem
in which the W.A. Government is
held by all the citizens of the State,
adding that builders were very con-
scious of the fact that productivity was
not as great as it should be.
He appealed for a return of the
traditional British freedom of private
enterprise, pointing out that the
building industry wanted to do some-
thing for all Australians.
Civic Reception.
At noon delegates and their wives
were tendered a Civic Reception by
the Lord Mayor of Perth, the Rt.
Hon. J. Totterdell, M.L.A.
This occasion was unique, because
the Lord Mayor, besides being a
Master Builder, was also president of
the Master Builders’ Federation in
1935.
The Lord Mayor referred to this
in his address of welcome, and he
spoke of the very great pleasure it
gave him to welcome in the civic
manner such prominent Australian
master builders.
He showed the assemblage the
gavel he received when Federation
president, and spoke of his great pride
in its ownership.
He referred to the spiralling costs
in building, and suggested that an
overhaul was long overdue. He
thought that “the idea of Cost Plus
was the worst thing ever introduced
to retard building progress in Aus-
tralia.
PERTH TOWN HALL.
The Town Hall, Perth, opened in 1870,
it is a unique city landmark.

BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


“The more builders paid the more
it cost, and the only solution was to
get back to competitive tendering,
which would give better results, with
more work for less money.”
The Lord Mayor related some hu'
mourous stories of his visit to Eng'
land while Federation president, add'
ing that it was “really wonderful to
have the builders’ Convention in
Perth, with such old pals as Manuel
Hornibrook, Charlie Davis and Mr.
Jack Emmett, present in health and
strength.”
He concluded with the hope that
the day would come when building
would again get fully under way. He
hoped that the Convention would be
both beneficial and fruitful to all build'
ers.
Councillor Fletcher also spoke on
behalf of the Perth City Council, sup'
ported in his remarks by the Minister
for Housing, Mr. Wild.
Mr. C. R. Hansen responded to the
Lord Mayor’s toast of “The Visitors”,
and Mr. I. B. Hawkins moved a vote
of thanks to the City Council for the
Civic Reception.
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
The president, Mr. J. B. Hawkins,
in his presidential address, said:
Since the establishment of our Fed-
eration in the year 1890 it has served
as a medium through which we might
meet from time to time, exchange
ideas, and, as a result, take the neces-
sary action for our common good.
We have now arrived at the stage,
however, when I believe that our Fed-
eration must mean something more to
us than fust that, so it is my hope
that the Conference in which we are
about to engage will be responsible
for leaving its mark in the history of
the Federation, alongside other not-
able Conferences which have taken
place in bygone years.
Frequent Meetings.
Recently it has been the policy of
the Executive to meet more frequent-
ly, and the results achieved last year
have already been made known to
your Affiliated Associations, and no
doubt will be further reported upon
in greater detail during the progress
of this Conference.
At the last Conference held in Ad-
elaide you did me the honour of elect-
ing me your president, and as a result
of my occupancy of that office I have
become a firm believer in the Federa-
tion as an organisation capable of
making great contributions to the
building progress in Australia; that
is. of course, if we, as individuals
through our Affiliated Associations, de-
cide to make it work.
The State Associations are the au-
tonomous bodies of the Industry and
must remain such, as they are the
life blood of the Federation which
must perish without the full support
of the States.
Strong Federal Voice.
The development of Australia is
along lines such as make it imperative
that the Building Industry must be
able to speak with a strong voice, or
should I say that the State Associa'
tions must be able to speak with a
strong Federal voice through FeHera-
tion.
Our friends the Architects are
building up a strong Federal Institute
and I have observed a change in their
policies in that matters which they
considered formerly to be for State
consideration only, are now being de'
cided at a Federal level. Quantities,
which you will be asked to consider,
is an example.
It became evident to your Execu'
tive during the year, that the Prime
Minister and such departments as the
Commonwealth Department of Works
would welcome guidance from us, and
I am happy to say that when we were
called into consultation by the Co-
ordinator General of Works, we were
able to offer advice to him which he
has accepted and which, I believe, will
result in the establishment of liaison
which will not only be valuable to us,
but also to the Government itself.
The liaison to us is obvious; we
must believe in our Federation and
we must support it up to the hilt.
Review of the Building Industry.
The past year has seen great changes
in the Building Industry of Australia.
The National Economy has undergone
a great change: credit restrictions have
had their effect; we are being com'
pelled to reverse our import policy
because of the contraction of the
value of our exports; but above all,
prices are increasing progressively as
the result of our meeting increased
living costs by automatic wage in'
creases.
Building has ever been regarded as
the index of National economic trends,
and so we see a type of recession be-
cause it is one that has developed in
the face of a great, and in many cases,
unprecedented demand for goods. In
many ways it is artificial in character.
There are those of us who blame credit
restrictions, others talk of import re'
stnctions, but the plain unadulterated
truth of the matter is that the nation
is pricing itself out of work.
The basic wage has more than
doubled itself since the war, but that
is not all. Despite this wage increase,
when we should have been working
harder to keep value in the pound,
we began to work a 40hour week,
and so in terms of work, the wage
has risen much more than the actual
money figures expressed. On the
basis of a weekly rate the wage has
risen, since 1938, on an average
throughout Australia of 188 per cent.
But. on an hourly rate, if we assume
that the working week has dropped
from 48 hours as it has in most
States, the percentage increase is
something in the order of 250 per
cent. Is it any wonder that Employ'
er and some Employee Organisations
have become disturbed at the position,
a position which calls for urgent re-
tracing of our footsteps?
Action which this Federation sup-
ports is being taken in the Federal
Arbitration Court to halt the ever'
increasing wage spiral, but I believe
that we require more than that. We
must first achieve stability of our
prices on a level that bears a relation'
ship to world markets. We can only
do that by engineering a new outlook,
an outlook I suggest, that was com'
mended to you by our recent dis'
tinguished visitor. R. O. Lloyd, when
he told you of the approach to pro'
duction problems of the American
worker, one of militancy, consistently
making demands not only on his own
efficiency but also on that of the In'
dustry itself, but at the same time
taking great care not to price himself
out of work by expecting the Indus'
try to pay a price that it cannot af'
ford. His job is to see that Industry
can afford to pay a high price for his
labour by giving high production.
Blame For High Costs.
Let me not, however, lay the blame
for high costs entirely on the worker
as he only forms part of the Industry.
He must be given wise direction for
THE C.M.L. BUILDING.
Perth possesses many fine public buildings
and institutions. The stately C.M.L. build-
ing stands as an example of West Australian
architectural and construction knowledge and
skill.
21

one cannot expect him to give of his
best when he knows that the organis-
ation or individual for whom he is
working is not efficient and is merely
conducting business on a get-rich-quick
basis.
It is with reluctance that I have to
admit the very nature of our calling,
together with the demands and short-
ages, has encouraged the develop-
ment of this type of builder. Small
though he may be in number he is
doing untold damage to our Indus-
try, and if any recession has the effect
of putting him out of business, it will
in the long run have served Australia
well in this regard.
Sub-contractors also, who have al-
ways been an integral part of the
Building Industry, must accept their
full responsibility for the criticism
which is becoming prevalent today.
Owing to the same reasons as men-
tioned previously for the builder, sub-
contractors have found that they can
obtain sufficient work direct from the
Architects, Government Departments
and the public generally and so have,
in the main, departed from competi-
tive tendering through the Builder,
and reverted to a vicious system of
Association Prices.
Conclusion.
In conclusion, gentlemen, let me
urge all sections of our great Indus-
try —Builder, Sub-contractor and Ma-
terial Supplier, to get back to what
we all know as the Custom of the
Trade: —-
(a) Builder and Sub - contractor
competitive tendering;
(b) Supplier to supply the requisite
materials in the quality, quant-
ity and size specified by the
Architect for the work, and on
which the Builder and Sub-con-
tractor must base their Tender.
I give you these thoughts in the
hope that they may stimulate discus-
sion, for it is from conferences such
as this that the Governments and In-
dustry look for guidance. I hope
that our discussions and resolutions
will be of such a nature as to provide
that guidance, for if this as achieved,
then the time you have given in com-
ing to Western Australia will have
been well worthwhile.
Receipt of the Report was moved
by Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic., and sec-
onded by Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy
(N.S.W.) and carried.
Following the reading and receipt
of the address, the Hon. Secretary’s
report was received and adopted.
TREASURER’S REPORT.
The Hon. Treasurer’s Report and
Balance Sheet were received and
adopted.
The Convention decided that the
Federal Fund be responsible for meet-
ing expenses of printing and station-
ery, the Federal Building Construc-
tion Prize and the George A. Taylor
Prize.
REPORTS OF AFFILIATED
ASSOCIATIONS.
The Presidents of the eight Master
Builders’ Associations affiliated with
the Federation then presented their
Annual Reports. These were as fol-
lows; — Queensland, N.S.W., New-
castle, Victoria, Tasmania, South Aus-
tralia. Northern Territory, and West-
ern Australia.
(The A.C.T. was not represented
on this occasion.)
These reports will appear in this
and subsequent issues of “Construc-
tion.”
ADOPTION OF REPORTS.
'Moving the adoption of the re-
ports, Mr. W. G. Longmuir (Vic.),
spoke of the great value of the An-
nual Reports and the excellence of
their contents.
He aded that there were a number
of very important matters to be dis-
cussed, such as basic wages, working
hours, and the conservation of ma-
terials.
DISCUSSION OF REPORTS.
Each report was discussed at length
in the order of presentation to the
Convention.
The President of the Master Build-
ers’ Association of W.A., Mr. L. F.
Sandwell, speaking of the ever-spir-
alling increases imposed by sub-con-
tractors, said that the position was
causing grave anxiety.
He said sub-contractors in the
plumbing and painting trades in W.A.
“practically fixed the price on State
housing.”
“Architects mostly want Prime Cost
items, and I feel we must come back
to a system of open tender and fixed
prices,” Mr. Sandwell added.
Mr. D. R. Tait (Tas.), referring
to building conditions in Tasmania,
said that they should endeavour to
have as many trades as possible on
their payrolls.
Tasmanian builders did their best
to employ as many men as they
could in the industry.
“Some men just stroll about, doing
nothing, though getting large sums for
it.
“Plumbers are the aristocrats of the
building industry!” Mr. Tait comment-
ed.
“We in Tasmania employ as many
of our own tradesmen as possible, and
cut out sub-contractors,” he added.
Mr. C. I. McDougall (Vic.), said
the situation regarding sub-contract-
ing in Victoria was “more sinister
than evident at first glance.”
“The position is acute,” he con-
tinued.
“The plumbers had conferred di-
rect with the architects’ organisations,
and had told them that the conditions
of contract were not mandatory at
all, and could be varied.
“Plumbers as an organisation had
refused to give builders any prices but
were dealing direct with the architect
or Commonwealth department.
“It will eventually come about that
builders will be nothing more than
co-ordinating officers.” Mr. McDougall
remarked.
Explaining the position in W.A.,
the Federation President, Mr. J. B.
Hawkins (W.A.), said the question of
sub-contractors would be fully dis-
cussed later on in the proceedings.
He mentioned that sub-contractors
in W.A. “wisely or unwisely after the
war agreed on a base price, took out
quantities, and reached an agreement
with the Government that each build-
er could work out costs.
“Prices were thus averaged for each
trade, and this served a useful pur-
pose.
“Then the sub-contractors ignored
the builders, and went to the Gov-
ernment and demanded more money,”
Mr. Hawkins continued.
The Master Builders’ Association
asked that they get together and find
out how the prices were made up,
but the Sub-contractors’ Association
refused to confer, or take any respon-
sibility.
“Builders should get the Conditions
of Contract when they sign up and
let the contractor take some responsi-
bility.
“This position had nothing to do
with our agreement with the archi-
tects, but only the sub-contractors in
the building industry,” Mr. Hawkins
concluded.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.),
spoke of the position in N.S.W. re-
garding P.C. items and provisional
sums, and made special reference to
such items as heating, electrical in-
stallation, H.W. services, etc.
Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic.), said
builders should be builders, and not
agents for sub-contractors.
“We should try to expand and be-
come real builders and employ real
business methods,” he said.
“Architects were too lazy to specify
what they wanted, and got other firms
to do it for them.
“That’s how we get provisional
sums,” he commented.
“It is purely a matter for builders
to be real builders with proper plans
and specifications, and to get the best
price he can,” Mr. Hansen concluded.
Mr. D. R. Tait (Tas.) remarked
22
September 24, 1952.
BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


that P.C. items were fully defined
years ago and had never been altered.
Mr. W. L Bryant (N.S.W.) sug-
gested that it would be better to defer
the discussion on sub-contractors un-
til item eight on the Agenda.
This suggestion was agreed to.
Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic.) made ref-
erence to the paragraph in the N.S.W.
report regarding Long Service Leave.
He said it was apparent that new
builders did not have to pay this,
while long-established builders were
saddled with long service leave pay-
ments.
“It will eventually creep into the
Awards of every State,” he warned.
Mr. Hansen congratulated N.S.W.
on the absence of any serious indus-
trial trouble during the year.
He said he was pleased to note the
great success from conciliation in
N.S.W. and suggested that efforts
should be made to expand this meth-
od of dealing with industrial disputes.
Commenting on credit restrictions,
Mr. Hansen outlined the effect it had
on the building industry.
“It may prove of great use in the
long run in helping us put our house
in order and assisting us to get back
to the contract system.”
Speaking of apprenticeship, Mr.
Hansen said reports from the States
revealed an absence of lads entering
specialised trades.
This was a question which virtually
affected the building industry, and
must eventually be faced up to.
Mr. Hansen referred to the ques-
tion of Insurance Covers raised by
S.A. and outlined the fire, windstorm,
and tempest insurances.
There existed more chances of dam-
age from windstorm and tempest than
from fire, he pointed out.
“We will want this included in con-
tracts and the Federal Executive will
take up the matter with the under-
writers.”
Mr. Hansen concluded his remarks
by saying it was pleasing to learn that
the building industry in Australia was
now relatively free of government con-
trols.
“We can now go forward freely
without being hampered as we have
been,” he added.
Mr. J. Riordan (Q.), in congratu-
lating the States on their comprehen-
sive reports, said that there was much
valuable matter contained therein.
He commented that if marginal in-
creases became a fact throughout Aus-
tralia costs would go by the board.
“On every side we hear the cry
that building costs must be reduced,
but nobody tells us how.
“Materials and labour are now more
readily available, competition has be-
come keener, and employer and em-
ployee must work harder to survive,”
Mr. Riordan said.
“Increasing costs caused by basic
wage rises and materials can be offset
by the availability of building mater-
ials, and the harder work of boss and
workman.’
Mr. Riordan warned that the pub-
lic mind must not be disturbed by
the impression that houses can be
built cheaper.
He said Queensland was committed
to the purchase of foreign prefab,
houses, and thus there was not the
money available for building homes
through ordinary channels.
Consequently Queensland was get-
ting homes of inferior material and
higher cost, and local building trades-
men were not enjoying the advantages
of employment on these jobs.
“The present cost of building was
beyond the control of builders, and
the public should know this,” Mr.
Riordan remarked.
“The public should also know that
the basic wage increases will drive
building costs still higher.”
Referring to Long Service Leave,
Mr. Riordan said it had been in op-
eration in Queensland during the past
12 months, and a Bill was before Par-
liament to liberalise the Act.
“We can eventually expect it
throughout Australia,” he added.
Dealing with apprenticeship matters
Mr. Riordan said the position of ap-
prentices for all trades, except plas-
tering, was very good.
Concerning construction of War
Service Homes, the speaker said that

the Commission had a Rise and Fall
clause operating successfully in
N.S.W. and Victoria.
“But as the result of an arrange-
ment in Queensland between the
Commission and members of some
other associations, they had agreed to
make lump sum tenders.”
Mr. Riordan warned that this ac-
tion by one of the Queensland Mast-
er Builders' Associations “will effect
the whole of the Associations through-
out Australia.”
“There is a grave danger when As-
sociations enter into private arrant
ments with the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment.
“It is a serious matter with costs
increasing and the possibilitv of marg-
inal increases in the future.”
Mr. Riordan suggested that some
action should be taken bv the Federa-
tion to inform the War Service
homes Commission that it was foolish
to build homes without a rise and
fall clause.
Mr. W. R. Longmuir (Vic.) de-
nied that Victoria had any arrange-
ment with the War Service Homes
Commission, adding that his associa-
tion had advised members not to
tender except on rise and fall.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.) said
it was news to him that any agree-
ment existed in N.S.W. with the War
Service Homes. The Commission was
not in favour of a rise and fall clause.
“It would be a good thing when
we all get back on a firm price basis,”
Mr. Thompson commented.
“The War Service Homes is not in
favour of the rise and fall clause, but
wants all tenders called on a firm price
basis.
“We realise the danger but we are
builders and are used to taking risks
all our lives.
“Surely we can make a start tak-
ing on lump sum jobs which are not
going to extend over too long a per-
iod,” he added.
Mr. Thompson explained the Long
Service Leave Act, and said it was
difficult to assess the liability of em-
ployers.
He said it was a most iniquitous
Act, and suggested that there should
be some method of payroll tax, and
after a certain time any payments
should he made out of the fund.
Mr. Thompson said he felt that
lump sum jobs would have a steady
influence on building homes, and
quoted Prime Minister Menzies' state-
ment that it was necessary “to squeeze
the Wwter out of the building indus-
try.”
Mr. Thompson went on to explain
the proposed N.S.W. Building Act.
and “Construction’s” part in research-
ing the history of action taken over
the years regarding registration.
“The Government is going to bring
the Bill down, and it has made up its
mind what it is going to give us,”
he continued.
“What they want to give us is just
registration, as the Minister feels that
N.S.W. is too big to police a com-
Act.
“He also feared that country build-
ers may be prevented from tendering
for jobs to build woolsheds.
“We are endeavouring to keep the
W.A. Act before their notice,” Mr.
Thompson added.
Prefabs.
At this juncture Mr. W. G. Long'
muir (Vic.) moved the following res'
olution:
“That this conference of the
Master Builders 1 Federation of Austra'
lia deplores the actions of Common'
wealth and State Governments respon'
sible for importing and firmly order'
ing prefabricated buildings of all kinds
from abroad which are mostly of in-
ferior standard and which invariably
have greater completion costs than lo-
cally produced units.
“That in view of the large number
of suspended contracts and in some
cases the considerable sums of money
owing to Australian builders in re-
spect of contractural obligations, all
Governments should honour their
Australian obligations before the ful-
fillment of overseas commitments for
prefabricated buildings.”
This motion was seconded by Mr.
C. I. McDougall (Vic.).
Speaking to his motion, Mr. Long-
muir said that, given the opportunity,
Australian builders could provide
better, cheaper prefabs, if they were
allowed a lower standard.
It was unfair competition when
overseas houses entered Australia in
considerably cheaper specifications than
local makers were permitted.
“Prefab, imports have done tre-
mendous damage to the building in-
dustry, and have prevented ships
from coming with urgent cargoes,”
Mr. Longmuir added.
Considerable discussion ensued re-
garding prefabrication imports, and
all delegates outlined the experiences
of individual States in this matter.
Mr. K. Stewart (N.T.) read a por-
tion of a recent speech in the Federal
Parliament by Mr. Caldwell, regarding
housing conditions in the Northern
Territory. He said:
“We are under a heavy obligation
to try to clean up the humpies and
huts in which aborigines are living in
Darwin. In fact, many white men
are living in these awful structures,
which are wurlies.
“They are a source of disease and
degradation. How can people, either
native or white, buy houses in Dar-
win under present conditions?
“A prefabricated house that costs
£1920 in England, costs £6500 to
£7OOO when it is erected at Darwin.
“Perhaps such prohibitive costs
should be laid at the door of racket'
eering contractors in the Territory . . .
Mr. Stewart said that not one
builder had erected a prefab, house
in Darwin.
“Builders are building better tvpes
of workmen’s cottages there for
£3500”, he added.
He requested that the Convention
should take steps to deny Mr. Cald'
well’s statement.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.)
said:
“We should take ourselves back two
years when builders were short of la-
hour and were unable to produce
homes for Australia.
“Timber merchants raised no ob'
jection to the imports of timber for
prefabs.
“The view at that time was that
the sooner we got some presentable
homes for the people the better, but
few of us realised the recession would
set in so quickly.
“We should ask the Federal Gov'
ernment not to allow any more pre'
fabs into Australia.
“Small prefab, houses were being
erected in Canberra at a cost of
£2BOO to £3OOO, but were no better
than local productions,” Mr. Kennedy
added.
Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic.) said that
various State Governments had can'
celled a huge amount ol local orders.
“It is better that local builders
should receive orders than foreigners
overseas.
“The Government should cancel all
orders and give them to our own
firms,” he remarked.
Mr. M. Hornibrook (Q.) said that
Australia must not break its contracts
overseas. Every contract should be
honoured for the sake of Australia’s
good name.
“Australian builders are well cap'
able of looking after themselves,”
he added.
Mr. A. W. Edwards (N.S.W.) re'
lated the history of school contract
cancellations in N.S.W. stating that
contracts for the import of prefabri'
cated schools were firm contracts,
while contracts given locally contained
conditional clauses.
Mr. J. B. Hawkins (W.A.) said
the industry must get rid of the build-
ers who are prostituting the trade.
“We must get back to a system
of firm tenders and get value back
into the £, as industry must get costs
down.
“There are certain things in our
industry that builders must clean up
themselves.

BUILDING; LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


“In W.A. there was a 20 per cent,
wastage of labour and materials,” Mr.
Hawkins commented.
“Builders take the kick all the
time, but they should hop in and put
the industry back on a firm footing.”
Mr. f. C. Pickles (Newcastle) point'
ed out that building societies in his
area said there was no shortage of
money.
“In fact they found more money
for homes in Newcastle than in any
other part of Australia.”
“He was bitter regarding rise and
fall,” Mr. Pickles continued.
“It had come to a bad state of ah
fairs when an owner faced a bill of
<£6oo or so over and above estimated
costs.
“Builders had priced themselves out
of business with rise and fall.
“They should revise prices and
stand a little bit of the rise them'
selves,” he added.
Mr. J. Riordan (0) said there was
considerable argument in his State re'
garding reduction of costs.
“Labour costs are still rising. In
fact, 80 per cent, of the costs of
building goes back to labour.
"Before the war men were working
44 hours a week, and being paid for
it at £5O a square.
“Since the war prices have leapt to
£2OO a square.
“But the owner won’t deny himself
anything that credit can buy,” Mr.
Riordan added.
“You can’t get building costs down
with wages rising, and if wages rise,
materials must also rise.”
Mr. D. R. Tait (Tas.) said that
building materials in Tasmania were
in good supply.
Timber was available for building,
but one of the big factors in the nV
ing price of building in Tasmania was
price control.
He recalled the “good old days”
when a builder knew all his costs.
Now he must pay rise and fall.
Mr. Tait said he hoped the Fed'
eration would strongly protest against
cutting out rise and fall clauses, so
that the industry can get down to bus'
iness on a decent basis.
Following further discussion, the
Victorian resolution was carried.
FORGERY TAX.
In answer to a question by Mr. C.
E. Thompson (N.S.W.), the Secre'
tary of the Master Builders’ Associa'
tion of Victoria, Mr. E. Elliott, ex-
plained the Victorian Forgery Tax.
Mr. Elliott said there was a fund
in Victoria which is actually establish'
ed to receive monies paid on transfer
of titles.
The fund virtually reimburses those
who may purchase land, but fall into
the hands of unscrupulous agents,
solicitors, etc.
This fund was established under the
Crown Law Lands Transfer Act, and
now fully reimburses persons for loss
of titles.
LONG SERVICE LEAVE.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.)
pointed out that Long Service Leave
is now operating in N.S.W., and a
number of building tradesmen are ah
ready on it.
“If old hands took their leave at
once, builders could be up against
huge payments of thousands of
pounds,” he said.
TRADE TRAINING.
Continuing, Mr. Kennedy said
that the final results of the C.R.T.S.
training up to .1950 was estimated at
32.00 trainees.
There were 18,000 being trained,
and 14,000 were still wanted.
Out of a total of 6340 men train'
ed 450 were plumbers, 267 were solid
wall plasterers (1000 were needed),
3129 were carpenters.
At present 260 bricklayers were in
training, 164 plasterers, and 1196
plumbers.
With the recession as the result of
the curtailment of building operations,
the Press and Unions complained of
the number of men out of work, Mr
Kennedy said.
He pointed out that they were not
actual tradesmen but unskilled labour.
Builders were now getting 15 to 20
per cent, more work per man than a
year ago, he added.
Mr. Kennedy said it was pleasing to
note that there were so many trainees,
but with an estimated deficiency of
14,000, plus the huge construction
programme, it was obvious that
tradesmen must be obtained for the
industry.
“We might find ourselves back to
the position of six months ago and
fabulous wages will be again paid in
the builders’ market for labour and
home builders.”
“In my opinion in the next three
years a reasonable amount of capital
release will create a demand for
15.000 extra tradesmen, making a total
of 61,000, against a present approxh
mate total of 46,000 trainees.
“If we can get sufficient building
THE CITY
OF PERTH.
Perth—the capital city of Western
Australia. Founded 1829, the city is
encircled by well-laid-out suburbs, and
is noted for its many impressive
buildings and institutions, including
what is claimed to be the finest Post
Office in Australia.

tradesmen we can keep costs down,
Mr. Kennedy added.
Mr. Kennedy raised the question of
the 1956 Olympic Qames in Mel-
bourne, and said it was the greatest
thing that had ever happened to Aus-
tralia, except the Royal Tour.
“The nation is fortunate to have
the Games coming here, and we
should view it as citizens of Australia
and not from a parochial angle,” Mr.
Kennedy remarked.
“The construction programme
should be carried through as Austra-
lians,” he added.
The Convention resolved to for-
ward a resolution to the Games Com-
mittee offering its wholehearted sup-
port in the construction programme,
and to let the world know that the
whole of Australia is behind the
Committee on its task of staging the
Games.
RISE AND FALL.
Mr. C. J. McDougall (Vic.) moved
the following resolution:
“That the Master Builders’ Feder-
ation of Australia urges the Minister
for War Service Homes (Social Ser-
vices) to restore the Rise and Fall
provisions to War Service Homes so
that ex-servicemen may gain the ad-
vantage of keen lump-sum tenders
from reputable and experienced build-
ers who can complete contracts expe-
ditiously, economically, and faithfully.
“Further —this Federation expresses
its conviction that the elimination of
the Rise and Fall provisions has dis-
advantaged ex-servicemen and is ill-
advised until our national economy
has become stabilised.”
The motion was carried unanimous-
ly.
APPRENTICESHIP.
Mr. W. J. Bryant (N.S.W.) spoke
of the apprenticeship position in most
States.
He personally thought the short-
age in the trades had arisen because
of piecework and the sub-contract sys-
tem.
There was no incentive for bring-
ing apprentices in, especially in the
bricklaying trade.
Mr. Bryant said he was vitally con-
cerned with the progress of the Syd-
ney Suburban Master Builders’ Asso-
ciations.
Of the 800 members, not more than
100 were in a position to employ
their own tradesmen, but relied on
sub-contractors.
He hoped some definite programme
would be decided on to enable steps
to be taken to increase apprentices in
these trades, otherwise there would be
a definite danger to the building in-
dustry.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.)
said an Apprenticeship Commission
was investigating the position, and
had asked for suggestions.
He thought that a first-year lad
should receive the second-year scale
of wages to enaable him to live better.
Mr. J. Riordan (Q.) said the Com-
mission had already taken evidence
in his State.
He said fibrous plaster apprentices
were the only shortage in Queens-
land.
For over 20 years the Queensland
Master Builders’ Association has in-
dentured lads as carpentry and brick-
laying apprentices direct to the Asso-
ciation.
The boys were allotted to builders
and the system had worked success-
fully over the last 20 years.
QUANTITIES.
The Secretary reported that the
Federal Executive believed that the
outcome of discussions with the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects re-
garding quantities were satisfactory.
There was considerable discussion
on this matter, all States taking an
active part in placing their views be-
fore the Convention.
The debate recalled that there was
no uniformity of measurement
throughout Australia.
It was decided to leave the matter
in the hands of the Executive for
further action.
RISE AND FALL FORMULA.
The Secretary said this item had
been placed on the Agenda mainly
because the Department of Works had
asked if it were possible to devise a
formula to provide against the varia-
tion of wages and costs of materials.
He said it was not proposed to get
out a formula at this juncture; he
thought the Federation should go
quietly irr this matter.
Mr. W. G. Longmuir (Vic.) said
Victoria had no agreement, nor had
it seen any formula from the archi-
tects.
His Association had been forced
into the situation of investigating a
formula with two cost accountants,
one acting for the builders and one
for the architects.
The only way to clear the matter
up was to get cost accountants to
work it out, but it must be satisfact-
ory to the builders, and included the
added costs of preparing the papers
The formula was not operating with
the War Service Homes, who had re-
fused to have anything to do with it.
Mr. McDougall (Vic.) suggested
that a fair amount of care should be
put into the formula, on a Federal
basis.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
spoke of the possibility of a fall which
may occur soon and any formula
should provide for a rest period before
prices go down.
’■'’When wages start to turn down,
a normal fall will follow behind wages
some three months later.
Considerable discussion ensued upon
these points.
It was finally agreed that the Feder-
ation agree in principle to the ques-
tion of a formula to regulate the rise
and fall of building contracts.
CONDITIONS OF CONTRACTS.
Under this heading, the question
of sub-contractors was also introduced,
and all delegates presented at length
the views and experiences of the var-
ious States.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
moved as follows:
‘■‘The tonic effect on the building
industry resulting from the Federal
Government’s financial policy is en-
abling contractors to complete their
projects with much greater efficiency
than hitherto.
“But this Convention deplores the
consequent tendency of Government
Instrumentalities to revert to day la-
bour methods.
“Although it is recognised that the
more rapid completion of works by
contractors places a heavier demand
on the financial capacity of various
authorities, it is obvious that anybody
professing to abhor the cost-plus sys-
tem to be consistent, must abandon
the day-labour principle and encour-
’ age free enterprise.”
It was decided to forward the above
resolution to the Prime Minister.
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION
PRIZE.
Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic.), in open-
ing the discussion, said that there
existed some confusion regarding the
Prize, owing to the different standards
of apprenticeship in various States.
He said the Federal Executive had
decided that the examination paper
be set in the State in which the Fed-
eration President resides, and be ex-
amined in the State in which the Im-
mediate Past-President resides.
Mr. Hansen advocated equality of
education in all States. To extend
that equality it was necessary to give
apprentices further technical aid.
The higher standards of education
obtaining in N.S.W. suits some of
the candidates, whereas W.A. boys
find the paper too hard. Thus N.S.W.
always wins the prize.
Mr. Hansen added that some action
should be taken to recommend to var-
ious interested bodies an equable ex-
amination paper, or alternatively,
26
September 24, 1952.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


N.S.W. may have to lower its stand-
ards.
The Secretarv said the problem was
a very real one, and the Executive
had given it considerable thought.
The question of standards went far
beyond the Prize. The first and sec-
ond year building construction course
at Sydney Technical College was the
present standard, he said.
The Prize was now competed for
by trainees in the building trade ap-
proved of by the Federation.
There was considerable discussion,
during which Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy
(N.S.W.) said the question should be
permeated throughout the Common-
wealth.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.)
questioned the possibility of a candi-
date winning the Prize on more than
one occasion, and suggested elimina-
tion of successful candidates from
further examinations.
Mr. W. G. Longmuir (Vic.) said a
levelling of standards was needed. He
could see no reason why a standard
could not be arrived at throughout
Australia.
Mr. K. McGregor (N.S.W.) sug-
gested that the system of examination
be altered in the future to arrange
for the marking of papers by the
people who set the papers.
Mr. R. J. Nurse (S.A.) said that
the Executive should examine the el-
igibility of each candidate, and that
they be certified by each Master
Builder Association.
The Secretary pointed out that there
is an age limit of 23 years for candi-
dates, which is the governing factor.
He said it was a question whether
a boy doing a diploma course under a
builder and then does two years un-
der indenture, is eligible if he sits
before he enters an indenture.
Mr. W. J. Bryant (N.S.W.) said
every apprentice at Svdney Techni-
cal College will do a four-year course
from now on, followed by the Clerk
of Works and diploma course.
It was resolved that full-time stud-
ents will not be eligible candidates
for the Federal Building Construction
Prize.
CLOSING STAGES.
When the Convention resumed on
Friday morning it entered the closing
stages.
Most of the deliberations were do-
mestic, and were discussed in Com-
mittee.
On resuming open meeting, the
Secretary reported on the Civil En-
gineering and Public Works Industrial
Committee, which is to meet not
earlier than next March.
He explained the question of the
1.L.0., and said it was the first oc-
casion on which it had directly ap-
proached the Federation as a body
which can advise the Government.
The work of the Committee very
vitally concerns the building indus-
try, he added.
The matter was left in the hands of
the Federal Executive to report back
to the States for comment.
DAY LABOUR.
Mr. K. McGregor (N.S.W.) spoke
of a return to day labour to conserve
funds.
“As the Federation is propounding
the return of free enterprise, steps
should be taken to submit a resolu-
tion to the Prime Minister,” he said.
MATERIALS CONSERVATION.
On the motion of Mr. W. G. Long-
muir (Vic.) it was resolved that a
paper prepared by Mr. lan Langlands
on Conservation of Materials be cir-
culated among the States, and that
all Associations give thought to ma-
terials conservation and adopt uniform
standards on a Commonwealth basis.
REPRESENTATIVES ON
EXECUTIVE.
As every affiliated Association has
a representative on the Federal Execu-
tive, it was decided that State Asso-
ciations should nominate a represent-
ative in the event of absence,
through sickness or for other reasons,
of the elected representative.
LOG OF CLAIMS.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.)
said that the Master Builders’ Asso-
ciation of N.S.W. had been served
with a log of claims by a new Car-
penters’ Union.
He sought guidance regarding pos-
sible policy and advice and experience
from the State in which the Union
already exists.
Mr. W. G. Longmuir (Vic.) said
his Association much prefers the new
Union to the other Union which was
completely Communistic.
The business of the Agenda was
then concluded.
ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
The retiring president, Mr. J. B.
Hawkins (W.A.) then relinquished
his seat to the incoming president,
Mr. C. R. Hansen (Vic.) and officers
and delegates were elected for 1952-
1953.
Mr. J. B. Hawkins nominated Mr.
W. Essery (S.A.) as Hon. Vice-Presi-
dent, and spoke warmly of the high
regard in which he was held, and
his unremitting work in putting the
Federation where it is today.
Mr. Essery, replying, said that his
interests would ever remain with the
Federation.
“I greatly enjoy the splendid fellow-
ship that exists between the States,
and hope to be long spared to attend
the Conventions. (Applause.)
Mr. T. J. Cavanagh (N.S.W.) was
re-elected Hon. Secretary, unopposed.
In paying a tribute to Mr.
Cavanagh’s sterling qualities and abil-
ity, Mr. H. Doust (W.A.) said the
Federation received the utmost loyalty
and help from its capable, tireless
secretarv. who had every interest of
the building industry at heart.
Replying, Mr. Cavanagh mention-
ed that this was the 25th consecutive
Convention he had attended.
“It is my privilege to serve the
Federation to the limits of my ability,
and its interests are paramount,” he
added.
PRESENTATION OF GAVEL.
The Senior Past-President, Mr. M.
Hornibrook, said he had a pleasing
duty to perform in presenting an in-
scribed gavel to the Immediate Past-
President, Mr. J. B. Hawkins.
Mr. Hornibrook spoke at length
upon the very capable manner in
which Mr. Hawkins had discharged
his duties as Federation president,
and of his devotion to the advance-
ment of the Australian building in-
dustry.
“Men of Mr. Hawkins’ calibre are
a tower of strength to the Federation,
especially during such times as we are
passing through,” Mr. Hornibrook
said.
He enjoined all present to work un-
remittingly to ensure the progress of
the industry.
Replying, Mr. Hawkins returned
his very sincere thanks to Mr. Horni-
brook for his kind remarks.
He had done his best for the Fed-
eration, and any success was due to
the splendid team-work of the Execu-
tive.
Mr. Hawkins expressed his grati-
tude for the support he had received
from Western Australian builders, and
from the Association’s Secretary, Mr.
S. Wedderburn.
He thanked one and all for their
help and encouragement. (Applause.)
PRESIDENTIAL THANKS.
The newly-elected Federation Presi-
dent, Mr. C. E. Hansen (Vic.) said:
“On behalf of all who have come
to Perth from other places to attend
this Convention, I desire to give my
warmest gratitude to all who have
made our visit so memorable.
“To our Immediate Past-President,
Mr. J. B. Flawkins, to the W.A. As-
sociation president, Mr. L. F. Sand-
well, to his wife and daughter, and to
every member, I must say ‘Thank you

for your lovely courtesy.’
“We visitors have lacked nothing
during our stay in the West.
“Mr. Hawkins has done everything
he could to cater for our personal
wants, and he has also conducted
this Convention in an admirable
manner.” (Applause.)
1953 CONVENTION.
Mr. Hansen later announced that
the 47th Annual Convention of the
Master Builders’ Federation of Aus'
tralia will be held at Melbourne,
commencing October 5, 1953.

In the first instance may I take this
opportunity of extending to all our
visitors a very sincere and warm web

Membership.
As at 30th Tune, 1952, our total

Buildine Controls.
During the year controls have pro'
gressively been relaxed by the State
Government resulting in the eventual
freeing of all house construction from
restrictions. It is earnestly hoped
that time is not far distant when the
remaining restrictions on Commercial
and Industrial work will also be lifted
so that a start can be made to over'
take the accumulated projects that
have had to be shelved over the past
years.
Credit Restrictions.
The full impact of this has. as yet,
not been fully evident in this State
though there are signs that those de'
sirous of commencing building are
not subject to the long delays that
were so common some little time ago.
Industrial.
As at date the current State Basic
Wage is £ll/3/10 and it is perhaps
interesting to note that when World
War 11. began in 1939 the ruling
rate was £4/2/2. During the six
years of war the increases totalled
17/11 whilst from 1945 to 1952 the
rise has been £6/3/9 per week.
Tradesmen’s wages in Metropolitan
area are:
Carpenters and Plumbers £ls 0 5
Bricklayers and Plasterers £l4 18 11
Painters and Signwriters £l4 17 11
Stonemasons £l4 17 5
The old Award having expired the
Trade Unions have served new logs
seeking among other concessions a
rate for skill of 50% of Basic Wage
and Long Service Leave, and the As'
sociation is opposing these most
strenuously, assisted by the Employ'
ers’ Federation.
It is pleasing to record that during
the year no disputes have disrupted
the Trade and that good relations
with all the Unions has continued.
Conditions of Contract.
Cost Plus and Fixed Fee.
Satisfaction is expressed that agree'
ment has been reached with the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects on
this question and we are hopeful of
soon operating under the revised con'
ditions.
Materials.
Whilst the supply position is, in
some respects, showing signs of slight
recovery, the major items of bricks,
cement, tiles, piping and timber still
are the cause of much concern and
importation has had to be relied on.
The future position is rather obscure
but it seems evident that the Import
Restrictions now imposed will have
serious effects on the building industry.
This Association has been greatly
perturbed at the decreasing quality of
many of the materials presented for
use and the subject has called for a
considerable amount of deliberation.
In association with the local Chapter
of the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects a statement was issued to
the press drawing attention to the
inferior quality of timber being sup'
plied to the Trade, which in many in'
stances did not conform with the re'
quirements laid down by the Stand'
ards Association.
Sub-Contractors.
The ever'spiralling increases im'
posed by Subcontractors has been a
further cause of grave concern to the
Executive, particularly as the State
Housing Commission referred to this
body the matter for consideration and
recommendation. The Master Plumb'
ers and Electrical Contractors’ Associ'
ations have consistently refused to re'
veal the basis on which their charges
are levied, so that builders engaged on
Base Price work are placed at a de'
cided disadvantage in obtaining re'
coup from the State Housing Com'
mission of amounts paid out over what
is considered a reasonable cost. We
have consistently maintained that the
Master Builders’ Association is ex'
tremely opposed to the fixation of any
minimum prices by subcontractors
and that all such work should, and
must, be done on a competitive basis.
State Housing Commission.
With the resignation of Mr. W. L.
Brine from the Commission, Mr. J.
B. Hawkins was selected by the Cab'
inet to represent the Building Trade
thereon, and the wisdom of the ap'
pointment has been amply demon'
strated.
Building Advisory Panel.
Consequent upon Mr. Hawkins’ ap'
pointment to the State Housing Com'
mission his seat became vacant on the
Panel and Mr. W. Fairweather, Jnr.,
was selected to succeed him.
Kwinana Oil Refinery.
The announcement that the Anglo'
Iranian Oil Co. Ltd. would erect their
Refinery in this State was accepted
as an augury of future development
of industrial projects in this State and
already other proposed industries have
indicated their intention of establish'
ing themselves here. The Associa'
<tion is watching the interests of its
members in this regard.
Federal Building Construction
Prize.
This State submitted 29 candidates
for the Examination and Mr. A. ].
Lyndhurst gained third prize and thus
became the winner of the State Prize.
Mr. J. B. Hawkins’ Memorial Prize.
Awarded annually to the best
Fourth Year Apprentice, the winner
this year was Mr. |. Miles.
Conclusion.
Western Australia is very proud
that this year’s Convention will be
under the Presidency of one of its
own Members in Mr. j. B. Hawkins
and we believe his year of office has
been marked by that same high de'
gree of efficiency and endeavour as
has marked his service to his local
Association.
We extend to you, Mr. President
and all Delegates our cordial greet'
L. F. SANDWELL,
President.

President’s Dinner
Distinguished Gathering.
On Thursday evening, the Presi-
dent of the Master Builders’ Federa-
tion, Mr. J. B. Hawkins, entertained
the Executive and visiting delegates
to dinner at the Adelphi Hotel.
It has been a long-established cus-
tom for the President to thus enter-
tain civic and parliamentary dignitaries
and prominent members of the build-
ing and allied industries, with the Fed-
eral Executive and Delegates as
Guests of Honour,
Among the distinguished guests on
this occasion were: The Deputy Di-
rector of Works (Commonwealth),
Mr. L. C. Lucas, A.R.1.A., West
Australian Minister for Housing, Hon.
G. P. Wild, M.L.A., Mr. M. R. Hor-
nibrook, F.A.1.8., the Acting Lord
Mayor, Councillor I. Murray, the
President, W.A. Chapter, R.A.1.A.,
Mr. W. T. Leighton, F.R.A.1.A., and
Mr. C. R. Hansen, F.A.1.8.
Following the Toast of “Her
Majesty the Queen,” with Musical
Honours, the Toastmaster, Mr. H. A.
Doust, F.A.1.8., called upon the Fed-
eration Senior Vice-President, Mr. C.
R. Hansen, to propose the Toast of
“The Commonwealth of Australia.”
Mr. Hansen said:
“We have just this moment shown
our loyalty and esteem for our
Monarch; which is the loyalty and
esteem shown by all Her subjects
throughout the British Commonwealth.
“Tonight, as members of the Com-
monwealth of Australia we express
our loyalty to the British Crown, and
are indeed proud to be counted
ainongst the peoples of the British
Commonwealth of Nations.
“Australia, this vast land of ours,
would be nothing without its people.
“Let us glance back to the days
of the pioneers, who have created
great cities and developed our States.
“They have left us a great and
proud heritage, which we must make
ourselves truly worthy of.
“Here in Perth the people possess
a fair and prosperous city, and their
progressive W.A. Government is ex-
ploiting the potentialities of this vast
‘State.
“There is a great future here for all
who are prepared to work,” Mr. Han-
sen said.
“In Adelaide you find the same
true friendship and hospitality such as
the West is famous for. South Aus-
tralia has entered upon a fabulous era
of prosperity through the discovery
of uranium.
“In our little ‘pocket-handkerchief’
called Victoria we are extremely
grateful to the people of N.S.W. who
cut us adrift.
“It is now the premier State of
Australia (applause and laughter).
“Then there is Tasmania —the
Apple Isle. There are no better, more
hospitable people anywhere, or people
more ready with the hand of friend-
ship,” Mr. Hansen continued.
“And, of course, we must appreci-
ate the wonderful foresight of the
people who built the Sydney Har-
bour Bridge; trademark of a won-
derful city, which is Capital of a won-
derful State.
“Sydney is one of the biggest cities
in the world, jewel of the great lands
of N.S.W. that fade into the mists of
the desert.
“Here in Australia there is great
wealth for you and me, and the Brit-
ish people as well.
“Then there is Queensland with its
wonderful tropical potentialities, which
will some day bring the north of Aus-
tralia to full development.
“The people who live in the vast
Northern Territory, and who pioneer-
ed the State, have much indeed to be
proud of.
“And speaking of pioneers, we
.must not forget the warriors of 1914-
1918 and of 1939-1945 who have
estalished Australia’s fame in all the
far-flung corners of the world.
“We must keep away from our
shores the enemy which threatens us,
those communistic-activated people,
more than six million strong who are
at our very doors.
“We must also stamp out those
amongst us who are imbued with com-
munistic doctrines, and thus keep our
fair land free and clean,” Mr. Hansen
said.
“In conclusion, may I give you a
thought, before we drink this Toast?
“Breathes there a man with soul so
dead.
Who never to himself hath said:
‘This is my own, my native land’!”
Responding, the Deputy Director
of Works (Commonwealth), Mr. L.
C. Lucas, A.R.1.A., said that Mr.
Hansen had covered the ground so
well that there was little he could add
except to remark that “the Common-
wealth elongs to all of us, and the
whole of us is far greater than the
part.”
“Each State becomes a little paro-
chial sometimes, but it is still part of
the whole, and everyone today is
quite happy about it.
“So happy, in fact, are the people
of Australia today about the Com-
monwealth, that the whole is very
definitely greater than the part,” Mr.
Lucas added.
“Building Industry of Australia.”
In proposing this Toast, the W.A.
Housing Minister, Mr. G. P. Wild,
spoke of the pleasure he felt in being
privileged to say something about the
Australian building industry.
“When one looks back over 160
years of life in Australia—today a na-
tion of only eight million people—
one must take his hat off to the build-
ers for their achievements.
“They have built every type of
building universities, hospitals,
churches, huge industrial plants—all
the product of the hard-working pion-
eers of the Australian building indus-
try,” Mr. Wild said.
“One could speak at length of the
great builders of this country.
“We would fail in our duty if we
did not mention Ernest Loveridge,
(continued overleaf)
RAISING HUGE REINFORCED CONCRETE SLABS.
One of the most interesting methods of construction developed recently is the Youtz-Slick lift-
slab method. By this method reinforced concrete slabs arc formed on the ground then lifted
into position by jacks located at the top of the supporting pipe columns. When the slabs
are In position the castings are welded to the columns.

now 100 years old, who came to Aus'
tralia with Thomas, Alfred and Walter,
and who built portion of the Sydney
G.P.0., St. Marys Cathedral, the
Museum, and many other fine struc-
tures.
“Thomas Loveridge joined up with
Mr. Hudson and in partnership they
built one of the finest buildings in
Australia, the Equitable Building in
George Street, Sydney, with its 46
ft. archway.
“Loveridge and family were the
pioneers of a very great building in'
dustry.
Speaking of W.A., Mr. Wild said
the State was large, the population
small, and he paid tribute to many
who rendered outstanding service.
Mr. Wild referred to the Public
Works Building in Perth which is one
of the finest buildings yet erected in
the State.
“It cost £2610 to build in those
days. Next to it they are building
a small timberTrame building which
will cost many thousands of pounds,”
he said.
“You Master Builders can team
yourselves with the men who went
before you with grit and stamina.
“Through them we are here this
evening,” he concluded.
Responding, the Federation Presi'
dent, Mr. I, B. Hawkins, said he
was very conscious of the fact that
a great deal was owed to the pioneer
builders of Australia.
Mr. Hawkins paid a tribute to the
sterling personal qualities of such out'
standing Master Builders as Mr. M.
R. Hornibrook (Queensland), Mr. C.
]. Davis (Newcastle), and Mr. J. G.
Emmett.
“We as a Federation realise a duty
to the various State Governments,
and that our Convention does sup'
port, and has a duty to Australia,”
Mr. Hawkins said.
“Building is considered one of the
greatest industries in Australia to'
day,” he continued.
“We have got to get back to free
enterprise, and the Federation, in
unanimous support of the platform of
Free Enterprise, is facing up to its
duty to the people.
“We take pride in our past achieve'
ments, and will work together as a
team tc enhance our prestige and rep'
utation,” Mr. Hawkins concluded.
The Visitors.
Proposing this Toast, Mr. M. R.
Hornibrook said that the Deputy Dfi
rector of Works, Mr. Lucas, “is do'
ing a mighty good job for Australia
and he deserved the congratulations
of the Federation for the good work
he has performed.”
He welcomed Councillor 1- Murray,
a Master Builder, who is Acting Lord
Mayor in the absence of the Lord
Mayor, Mr. L Totterdell, who was
Federation president in 1935.
“The Lord Mayor has done a
splendid job for Perth,” Mr. Horni'
brook said.
“Regarding the Housing Minister,
Mr. Wild, I would like to take him
back to Queensland.” (Laughter.)
“He has done a remarkably good
job in W.A., and he will retain his
portfolio because of the good work
he has done in housing for his State.
(Applause.)
Replying, the Acting Lord Mayor,
Councillor J. Murray, spoke of the
great disappointment the Lord Mayor
felt at being unable to attend, owing
to an accident.
“We are both builders, and are now
both retired, but we retain our affec'
tion for the industry.
“There are five builders serving on
the Perth City Council, and the build'
ing industry of W.A. is very proud
of this record. (Applause.)
The president of the W.A. Chap'
ter, R.A.1.A., Mr. W. T. Leighton,
F.R.A.1.A., also spoke.

Convention Sidelights
• Oldest delegate to the Convention
was sprightly Newcastle building
identity, Mr. Charles G. Davis. He
has been in business as a builder for
51 years, and started his trade 62
years ago, at the age of 14. Mr.
Davis has spent all his years at New'
castle.
He was born at Gloucester, Eng'
land, and came to Adelaide on the
“Oakland,” a Tea Clipper, as a small
child. His father commenced build'
ing in Adelaide, thence to Melbourne,
finally working on the Sydney'New'
castle railway.
Mr. Davis was Federation president
in 1949, and for many years he has
been very active in Newcastle Master
Builders’ Association affairs.
His organisation has built many fine
buildings in Newcastle, notably the
splendid Town Hall, and a number of
large hotels. He is now erecting a
wool processing factory near the city.
Mr. Davis has been a prominent
member of the Masonic fraternity for
45 years, and has been active in bowl'
ing circles almost as long.
A man of deep understanding and
a love of humanity, his good deeds
have brought great happiness to many
less fortunate people.
• The delegate who travelled the
greatest distance to the Convention
was Darwin Master Builder, Ken
Stewart, Northern Territory Master
Builders’ Association vice'president.
A Sydneysider by birth, he is now
a Territorian by adoption. He will
’be remembered as construction man'
ager for J. W. Cooper Pty. Ltd.,
Rhodes.
He was in the Territory all during
the war, and returned there in 1948.
He is now busily engaged in general
construction work, and enthusiastically
claims a great future for the N.T.
His son, Mr. D. Stewart, is doing
an Architectural Course in Sydney.
• On Monday the visiting ladies
enjoyed a half'day motor tour of
Perth and environs, in company with
the wives of Association members.
• An all'day bus tour on Tuesday
took delegates, their wives, and Asso'
ciation and Federation officials on a
memorable sightseeing trip.
Leaving Perth at 9.30 a.m., morn'
ing tea was served at Mundaring
Weir, lunch at Ye Old Narrogin Inn,
and afternoon tea at the Young Aus'
tralian League camp at Araluen.
The excursionists arrived back in
Perth, tired and happy, at 5.30 p.m.

ing at the Adelphi Hotel.
They were later joined by the gen-
tlemen at the termination of the Presi-
dent’s Dinner.
• Farewelling East-bound air pas-
sengers at Guildford on Friday night
were Mr. J, B. Hawkins and several
Association members, who went to
the airbase to speed the departing
Convention visitors.
• N.S.W. Master Builders’ Associa-
tion President, Mr. C. E. Thompson,
told “Building: Lighting: Engineer-
ing” the long journey from Sydney
was more than compensated for by the
wonderful generosity and hospitality
of W.A. builders.
Mr. Thompson was greatly impress-
ed with what he saw of the progress
of the State, especially in the build-
ing and construction field.
• The Newcastle delegation tra-
velled to Perth in the “Manoora,” in
company with the Tasmanian delega-
tion.
Newcastle Master Builders’ Associa-
tion secretary, Sam Scorer, proved a
tower of strength and energy on the
Sports Committee, and his account-
ancy experience was a great help in
balancing the Sports Fund.
Newcastle delegate F. E. Anderson
won a second prize in the Mad Hat-
ters’ Ball for a cleverly-made headgear.
• Walter J. Bryant, president of
the Council of Branches, and Master
Builders’ Association executive mem-
er, was attending his first Convention.
He was greatly impressed with Perth,
and particularly by the fact that almost
50 per cent, of houses are being built
by owner-builders. “A colossal fig-
ure,” he commented.
Besides proving a tiger in debate,
Walter proved to be quite a lion so-
cially.
• Ken McGregor, Master Builders’
Association of N.S.W., vice-president,
got two imoprtant resolutions passed
at Convention. A keen debater and
a particularly lucid thinker, Ken is
expected to go places in Master Build-
ers’ Association and Federation affairs.
• Manuel Hornibrook, of Queens-
land, the Federation’s Senior Past
President, filled the Presidential Chair
in 1925. An eloquent speaker with a
fine turn of phrase, Mr. Hornibrook
brings a wealth of wisdom and experi-
ence to the Conventions.
• The W.A. Housing Minister,
when opening the Convention, said
that W.A. was fairly well off for most
building materials, except cement.
The Housing Commission’s No. 1
priority was housing, but it had re-
cently eased restrictions on permits
for industrial projects and large build-
ings.
There was not one church in the
State awaiting a permit, he added.
• Mr, K. Stewart, of Darwin, men-
tioned a proposal to build a new
wharf at Darwin.
Trade and shipping through Dar-
win need to expand to meet the de-
mands of the Rum Jungle uranium
field.
He said that building work valued
at £715,000 had been done in the past
year, including £425,000 worth of
Government contracts.
• With a population increase of
5 per cent, during the last two years,
the W.A. building industry had had
something to face up to. Housing
Minister Wild told delegates.
In the post-war years the State
would have had a very difficult time,
had it not been for the co-operation
of builders, merchants, and trade
unions.
They had done a truly magnificent
job, he said.
• Perth City Council must be
unique in the Commonwealth. Its
Lord Mayor. Mr. J. Totterdell, M.P.,
is a Master Builder, and was Federa-
tion president in 1935. The acting
Lord Mayqr, Councillor Murray, is a
Master Builder, and four other Mast-
er Builders are also serving as Coun-
cillors. The work these men have
done as a team has developed Perth
into a well-planned, progressive city.
The Galvanised Iron
Position
Statement From Association.
The manufacturers of galvanised
iron, Messrs. John Lysaght (Aust.)
Pty. Ltd., together with the members
of the New South Wales Galvanised
Iron Association who distribute this
material throughout the State, feel
that, with the lifting or easing of con-
trols in various States of the Com-
monwealth, customers, both retailer
and ultimate user, may get a wrong
impression of the availability of this
material and in consequence be dis-
appointed that some time lag may still
occur between the placing of an order
and its delivery.
In order, therefore, to make the
position as clear as possible they deem
it advisable to set out the position as
it obtains at present.
They state that while it is true that
official controls are being eased in
various States, the output of gal-
vanised iron has not increased to any
appreciable extent, and, although there
are prospects of production being step-
ped up to some degree, present de-
mand exceeds output.
In New South Wales, for instance,
releases of galvanised iron made by
the Department prior to its closing
down will have first call on the com-
pany’s production and should be more
than sufficient to cover the output of
galvanised iron to .the end of the year.
From then on, if production is main-
tained, some improvement might
reasonably be expected, but for some
months at least there will be no mate-
rial change in the availability of gal-
vanised iron.

NEW HORLICK FACTORY
£500,000 MILK-PROCESSING PLANT, BOMADERRY, N.S.W.
The four-storey completely media-
nised factory erected by Horlicks Pty.
Ltd. at Bomaderry, on the South Coast,
was officially opened on June 17th
last by a grand-daughter of Sir James
Horlick, who first produced this world-
famous product in 1873.
The new plant, which is the most
modern of its kind in the world,
will, when at full capacity, produce
9,000,000 lb. of milk products a year,
which will require 90,000 gallons of
raw milk a week The factory will
stimulate milk production in this im-
portant dairying district as it will pro-
vide an assured market for all surplus
milk.
Sir EaYle Page, speaking at the open-
ing, paid tribute to the company for
this magnificent evidence of its con-
fidence in Australia and the Nowra
district. It was such progressive moves
of this type that would stimulate the
languishing dairy industry, for which
he had been fighting all his life
ne had Been ngntmg ms me.
Mrs. John Coats, cousin of the late
Sir Ernest Horlick, in performing the
opening ceremony, said that Horlicks
was a family concern making a product
vital to the building-up of the young
that go to make a family.
Most Modem Plant.
The imposing four-storey building
and installations, costing nearly
£500,000, represents the accumulated
experience gained during more than
seventy-five years of manufacturing
and incorporates the latest ideas from
Horlicks’ factories in England and
America ,and it is one of the most
modern milk food processing plants in
the world.
P r oP°sal was to erect a
m f dern factory which would eliminate
wherever possible human handling of
product, during processing, so as
to ensure complete purity.
Messrs. D. T. Morrow ii Gordon

try and the milk'producing capacity of
the South Coast area. During the war
and in the post'war years, the Aus'
tralian Company demonstrated its
value by stepping into the breach and
taking over the supply of export
markets normally supplied from the
factory in England, and the major part
of the expanded output is destined for
manv of Horlicks extensive export
markets. Already shipments are made
to New Guinea and the Pacific Islands;
Malaya and the Far East; India, Burma,
Ceylon, the Middle East, and even as
far afield as Africa.
The increased capacity will enable
this volume of exports to be made in
addition to meeting the demands of an
expanding domestic market.
Importance to Dairy Industry.
In addition to its important contrh
bution to Australian exports, the fac*
tory will be able to absorb surplus
milk and, by providing farmers with
an assured market, give added incen'
tives to milk production. It will thus
help materially the Dairy Industry in
the Nowra area and the important
milk - producing districts which sur*
round it.
Both male and female labour will
be employed and this will be drawn
from local labour pools, so that the
factory generally represents another
step forward in the progress of the
Shoalhaven districts and in the policy
of the decentralisation of industry.
Capacity Increased
Threefold.
Production capacity of the new fac'
tory is three times greater than the
existing plant at Bomaderry and in'
corporates many of the latest English
and American ideas, including a very
high degree’ of mechanisation.
All processes are carried out under
the one roof, and follow a scientifically
designed flow plan from the reception
of raw materials to the emergence of
Horlicks packed ready for despatch.
During no part of the process is the
product touched by hand.
Of particular interest is the filling
station, which is carried out in a
special air ' conditioned chamber in
which temperature and humidity are
maintained at a constant level through'
out the year, summer and winter.
New Products Planned.
The factory has a fully'equipped
laboratory and selTcontained experi'
mental plant which includes a small
scale* version of the production unit.
It is anticipated that in addition to
the production of Horlicks, the two
Australian factories will be producing
new products which the Horlicks or'
ganisation is developing, and Australia
may well become the testing'ground
for new products intended for world'
wide distribution.

Rapid Fabrication and Erection
of Heavy Structural Steelwork.
The steel frames for the Factory and
Boiler House to the new Horlicks
factory at Bomaderry, were fabricated
and erected by Thirlwell U McKenzie
Engineering Pty. Ltd. of Wollongong
Road. Port Kembla, N.S.W., who are
general engineers specialising in the
manufacture of large steel ' framed
buildings, overhead cranes, well' drill'
ing machinery, mine cars and asso'
ciated equipment.
This firm made complete working
drawings from outline diagrams and
specifications supplied by Messrs.
Morrison and Little, Consulting Em
gineers on behalf of the Architects,
Messrs. D. T. Morrow and Gordon,
and nearly one hundred large'Size
drawings were required to fully detail
the 460 tons of structural steel in'
volved. The steelwork was fabricated
in the firm’s modern workshops and
transported by road some 50 miles to
the site. Special permits were re'
quired for the transport of some of
the building columns which were up
to 67ft. long.
The frames were assembled on the
site by a squad of the Firm's erectors
who were billeted on the ground for
the duration of the job. The actual
erection was entirely handled by
mobile cranes and this is interesting to
note, for the top of the Boiler House
is some 70ft. from ground level. A
ten'ton “General” crane with a 75ft.
jib handled most of the work in con'
junction with three'ton short jib
mobiles.
The frames were generally of alb
welded design with bolted field com
nections as required and some 100,000
feet of electrodes were required for
the job.
Delivery of the steelwork was made
on a progressive basis to coordinate
with erection schedules of the main
building contractors, Messrs. Elweld
Pty. Limited, and the other sub'
contractors.

The New Interstate Railway
looking Hail
AT CENTRAL STATION, SYDNEY.
The new booking hall at Central
Railway Station is nothing short of
exciting. For the past twelve years
we have been robbed of our birth'
right to develop our country along
natural lines, and build “to the high
heavens” if called upon to do so.
In the past decade we had to con'
fine our activities, by law, to building
only the smallest of cottages, thereby
rendering it necessary for our big
builders to call a halt and allowing
all our craftsmen to languor for the
want of employment. To put high'
grade stonemasons used to preparing
city blocks of granite or trachyte,
wood'earvers used to carving church
furniture, or our highest grade carpent'
ers, ioiners, bricklayers* metalwork'
ers, and plasterers who are capable of
splendid achievements, to works of
small significance though the mone'
tary gain may be equal, does not
bode well for the progress of the
younger generation. They should
have been apprenticed to these trades
long since.
Therefore, we welcome the entry
of the applied arts as well as the
crafts and sciences in this new deveL
opcent.
The Hall is “arresting” insofar as
drabness, to which we have become
accustomed in railway buildings, is
replaced by artistry and taste.
The Official Opening.
The Premier (Mr. J. J. Cahill) in
opening the hall on Bth September,
said he believed that the comforts
provided and the aesthetic appeal of
the surroundings will attract business
to the railways.
“It is inevitable,” he said, “that air
competition will attract some business
to the airlines, but there is no reason
why train travel should not regain
the better part of the interstate pas'
senger trade by being made more com'
fortable and attractive. We should be
able to compete with other forms of
transport. If competitors provide
good services, we must provide better
ones.
“There is an unfortunate tendency
these days to tolerate the makeshift
and the temporary. In some cases,
this is unavoidable but many of our
best public buildings have suffered as
a result of temporary additions becom'
ing permanent eyesores.
“People should remember that dig'
nified government buildings are the
property and, should be, the pride of
the people. Good, bad or indifferent,
they remain a reflection on a Gov'
ernment’s initiative.
“If N.S.W. is to prosper, if its re'
sources are to be exploited to capac'
ity, if our industries are to be ex'
panded and the potential of the coum
try districts realised, then we must
plan our railway services to meet that
development.
“My Government is confident that
its railways will meet’ all future de'
mands on their carrying capacity.
“Last financial year one'third of all
loan expenditure was allotted to rail'
ways, because of the pressing neces'
sity to develop their services and to
purchase up'to'date rolling stock.”
The Railway Commissioner (Mr. R.
Winsor) said the Railway revenue for
August was £650,000 below estimate,
but he was not dismayed. He intend'
ed to chase after business, because in
the railway, as with refrigerators or
anything else, we must give of our
best if we wish public support.
Referring to the size of the present
structure Mr. Winsor said that when
the railways were built, the originator
was held up to public ridicule, yet,
look at the growth now. New av'
enues will have to be found some'
where in this city to accommodate
increasing development.
He proposed to conduct the rail'
ways as a private undertaking would
be conducted.
A tribute was paid by Mr. Winsor
to Melocco Bros, for the fine work
turned out by this firm.
A small gathering representative
mostly of Government interests, at'
tended the historic occasion.
These included: The Minister for
Transport, Hon. W. F. Sheahan; the
Minister for Lands. Hon. H. Hawkins;
the Chief Secretary, the Hon. G.
Kelly: the Minister for Mines, the

of transport existing prior to 1787, to
the latest type of Garrat Locomotive
engine iust recently put into opera-
tion. This frieze also shows the var-
ious industries served by the Railways
and the activities of the Department.
The background of this frieze is dec-
orated with replicas of authentic ab-
original ornament and carving care-
fully selected from examples obtained
all over Australia, and which illustrates
the life and legends of the Australian
aboriginal. Australia can be proud of
the artistic sense of these primitive
people, which is reflected in the har-
mony of their simple designs and the
sincerity of expression; their art
lends itself to incorporation in Aus-
tralian Architecture.
Over the Booking Counter the
frieze is pierced by panels based on
carvings from the Dubbo area. These
have been cleverly contrived to form
the outlets for the mechanical ventil-
ation and also the speakers for the
public address system.
The 9’ 6” high walls at the rear
of the 62’ 0” long counter and the
two offices at the eastern end of the
public space are faced with camphor-
wood veneer 9’ 6” high, and of plv-
wood sheets 24’ 0” long. This ven-
eer was specially selected from the
root of a camphor-laurel tree approx-
imately 22’ 0” circumference and
weighing llj tons.
The ceiling of the area at the rear
of the counter and in the offices is
of acoustic tiles.
The Country and Ticket Stock cup-
boards are the latest in overseas meth-
ods for the issue of rail tickets, and
are constructed of polished Quondong
with timber roller shutters covering
the ticket racks. The top of. the coun-
ter is finished with mottled green rub-
ber with aluminium edging, while the
glass and green anodized aluminium
screen is attractively decorated by ab-
original Ornament etched on the glass.
The office partitions and the entrance
doors are of polished quondong with
aluminium furniture.
The tables in the main offices are
of specially selected camphor-wood
veneer, while the chairs are of quon-
dong upholstered in maroon coloured
hide. The floor of the two offices
are covered with green carpet which
is in harmony with the aboriginal
motif.
The fluorescent lighting is a feature
of this new Booking Office, the fittings
being kept flush with the ceiling and
sheeted with ground perspex. A
modern telephone system has been in-
stalled to each desk.
Aboriginal Motifs Employed.
In depicting the progress of tran-
sport in Australia as shown in the
scagliola frieze, an endeavour has been
made to associate this with the life
and primitive culture of the native
population of Australia, of their tra-
ditions and legends, many of which
date back to untold generations, tales
of which have been brought down
verbally in an unbroken line.
Aboriginal religion perpetuates the
eternal power of life emanating from
the spiritual ancestors, seeks to stim-
ulate nature to sustain her periodic
harvests of food, game and water,
and induces in the individual a firm
conviction in the principle of know'
ing and doing right and avoiding all
wrong-doing in accordance wdth tribal
traditions and standards, which, after
all, is the basis of all true civilization,
whether advanced or primitive.
The means of expressing sentiment
by legend through the medium of art
has been well known to most of prim-
itive races throughout the world but
few have excelled the Australian ab-
original who goes to endless effort in
preparing for his ceremonial observ-
ances even when these are for a short
duration, using in most cases simple
but quite decorative design expressing
the deep significance which each rep-
resents.
Practically all the various designs
in the frieze were taken from original
decorations, and most of them have
some definite significance well under-
stood by the native population of the
various tribes from where they were
obtained.
The First Fleet and After.
The illustration of progress of
progress of transport starts as tran-
sport existed prior to and in 1787,
the year before the arrival of the First
Fleet, and shows that the native knew
no other form of land transport than
that of carrying by the human being.
The second scene, which forms a
unit with the first, shows that upon
the arrival of the First Fleet under
the command of Captain Phillip, the
unloading of the ships and storing of
the goods at the head of Sydney Cove
was done also entirely by human ef-
fort.
The next dual group depicts, on
tfie first half, that land transport for
some time was limited to the bullock
and dray, which followed the timber
cutter as the clearing proceeded and
tilling of the soil that followed. The
second part of this tableau shows

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust. -N.S.W,
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday,
4th September, 1952, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. E. L. Freedman,
and 74 members and visitors were
present, while several apologies for
non-attendance were received.
Welcome to Visitors.
The President warmly welcomed
Mr. A. E. Stafford, F.R.A.1.A., the
President of the N.S.W. Chapter of
the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects, and drew the attention of
the meeting to the fact that this was
a joint meeting of the two professions.
He expressed the hope that the close
co-operation between the two profes'
sions would be maintained in the
future.
The President also welcomed Mr.
O. Huxley, the Chairman of the
Society’s Newcastle Chapter.
Minutes of General Meeting held on
7th August, 1952, were taken as read
and confirmed.
President Elect for 1952-1953.
The President announced that Mr.
G. C. T. Brown was the President
elect for 1952-1953.
Invitation to E.L.M.A.,
Newcastle.
He also advised that the Society
had been invited to visit the E.L.M.A
factory at Newcastle on Monday,
October 6th. Detailed arrangements
would he promulgated through “Side-
lights.”
Use of Letters M.I.E.S.
(Aust.).
The President announced that ap-
proval had been received from the
National Council for members who
were qualified to use the letters
M.I.E.S. (Aust.). Members would be
notified in writing on this matter as
soon as possible, and it was hoped that
certificates would be available for pre'
sentation at the next General Meeting.
Council Nominations
for 1952-1953 Council.
The President stated that the Coun'
cil’s nominations for the 1952-53
Council would be posted to members
shortly. He reminded members of
their right to make one additional
nomination each for the new Council.
Such nomination must be in writing
accompanied by the written consent of
the person nominated, and must reach
the Secretary between the 20th
October and the 6th November, 1952.
The ballot for the new Council will be
taken at the Annual General Meeting
to be held on the 20th November,
1952.
Next Meeting.
Mr. S. Holman, under the heading
of “Better Light, Better Sight, Better
Health,” will give a report on the
work carried out in designing and con'
structing the I.E.S. Stand. He will
demonstrate the various parts of the
Exhibit and produce a recorded talk
designed for use at the Town Hall.
Subject for the Evening.
Mr. Walter R. Bunning, F.R.A.1.A.,
A.R.1.8.A., representing the N.S.W.
Chapter of the Royal Australian In-
stitute of Architects, read a paper on
“Dramatic Changes in Store Design.”
He outlined in great detail the changes
which had taken place in Australia*
and abroad, with regard to the concept
tion of the modern store. With a
great number of illustrations he. show"
ed the influence which this had had
on the design of the store, with re'
gard to the store’s facade and win'
dow treatment, as well as its interior
layout. He concluded by formulating
trends for future development.
Discussion.
An animated discussion took place,
centred mainly round the lighting as'
pects of store design. The problems
of window design were discussed, and
the merits and de-merits of open type
shop fronts. Suggestions were made
to combat external reflections on the
show window proper.
The flexibility of the store and the
role of lighting to assist in rapid
changes of store functions were dis-
cussed.
A number of city stores were men'
tioned as examples of modern lighting
treatment.
Vote of Thanks.
Mr. D. C. B. Maclurcan, in moving*
and Mr. G. Y. Falk in seconding a
vote of thanks, stressed the impofeance
of close co-operation between the de'
signing architect and the lighting en-
gineer. Whilst light by itself could
not solve any of the problems of store
design, it played a major role in as'
sisting the architect in achieving his
design objects.
The great value of joint meetings of
the two professions had been again
proved by the success of this meeting.
DRAMATIC CHANGES IN STORE DESIGN
By WALTER RUNNING, A.R.I.B.A.
A Paper read to a Combined Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society
of Australia and the N.S.W. Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.
No other field of architectural de-
sign has been so profoundly changed
in these post-war years as store design.
These changes have been due to: —
1. Changes in transport condi-
tions.
2. A change in income distnbu-
tion.
3. New technological develop-
ments.
1. Changes in Transport.
The emergence of the motor car age
in Australia has brought extreme dif-
ficulties to the centre of cities, traffic
snarls, parking problems, etc. High
costs of public transport tend to keep
people in the suburbs and this focuses
new attention on the decentralised
store. The automobile has made it
easy for large numbers of people to
go to outlying suburban shopping
centres.
Directors of city stores are appre-
hensive about the future of the large
central department store, as high taxes
on city nroperties, transport difficulties
and high fares make them vulnerable
to changes in economic conditions.
The trend in America is for decen-
tralisation of the central store to the
suburbs of the metropolis and to other
towns. In Sydney such growing cen-
tres as Bondi Junction, Parramatta,
Hurstville, Chatswood, and Crow’s"
Nest appear likely to become even
larger centres of retail marketing.
They are the focal points for a large
section of the city’s population.
I n America this trend has become
so obvious that the down-town retailer
has been forced to modernise his store
as never before in order to hold his
own in the fight for the shopping dol-
lar. The result has been an increasing
awareness of the part which original
and creative architectural design can
play in the business of merchandising,
No other country in the world has
40

become so conscious of the value of
good display.
2. Change in Income
Distribution.
Over-riding fact about store plan-
ning to-day is that more people have
more money to spend for more things
than ever before.
The post-war redistribution of in-
come has brought profound changes
in retailing methods. The once clear-
cut distinction between mass merchan-
dising and luxury selling is no longer
quite so clear: the “mass” seems to
have moved up from the basement and
into the fashion - conscious - specialty
store, while the tax-ridden “luxury”
market occasionally can be seen at the
bargain counters.
Fashion itself, once the prerogative
of the luxury market, is now demand-
ed by all buying groups, and this re-
quirement has spread from apparel to
•almost all merchandise groups. Cus-
tomers like to be associated with the
smart, up-to-date store.
However, while the customer has
more money he also has less time.
This is due to: —
1. The large numbers that gather
in shopping areas, resulting in a
sheer fight for service, with con-
sequent delays;
2. A current preference for spend-
ing leisure on the beach or in
one’s garden in lieu of that once
pre-eminent diversion of “shop-
ping.” In other words, it is no
longer “fun” to shop—it is, in-
deed, quite a grim business.
With this change has come a de-
mand which makes impossible the
good old-fashioned personalised shop-
ping service and substitutes quality
merchandise which mass production
has made widely available.
It is now possible to buy a national-
ly famous brand of trousers at Coona-
barabran as easily as at Googee or
Crow’s Nest.
3. Technological Developments.
Air' conditioning has redesigned
every building element in the modern
store from the exterior appearance to
the display fixtures themselves. With
the disappearance of upper-floor win'
dows for natural ventilation, as well as
natural lighting, the department store
exterior has become a series of large
unbroken wall surfaces which present
a magnificent opportunity for exciting
display. In Macy’s new store in Kansas
City the store front has been covered
for the whole height with porcelain
enamel panels in a pleasant colour and
the name in ouite small lettering gives
the whole building a most sophisticated
and attractive appearance. In essence
the front is a key to the simplicity and
restraint evident throughout the whole
store.
Modern lighting, low cost acoustic
materials, lightweight curtain walls,
flexible ceilings and partitioning have
all rendered the 1940 store obsolete.
THE 1952 STORE.
Now let us look at the up-and-
coming store. It was more people with
more money and less time which took
the wall off the street front of the
store and produced the well-known
“open-front.” And it is the same
factor which also produced the “great
vanishing act” in store design. The
traditional elements of the store in-
terior have literally been made to dis-
appear in favour of the merchandise
itself.
The building line has vanished into
the recessed store front, the sales
counters have shrunk into hook strips
in the wall, island fixtures are reduced
to skeleton forms clothed in merchan-
disc, the lighting fixtures are recessed
into the ceiling, the ceiling and walls
have begun to be replaced by easily
movable, dry-built panels.
The object is to put as little obstruc-
tion between the customer and the
merchandise as possible. Most retailers
have found that the new expertly-
lighted (“self-selection” counters and
racks enabled them to sell twice as
much with half the number of assis-
tants.
Rise of the Specialty Store.
Many of the big improvements in
store design have been contributed by
the specialty store, which was an early
answer to the problem of congestion
in the big department store. For a
long time shop-keepers believed that
only the rich could afford the greater
ease of shopping in a smaller store
where considerable pre-selection of
lines has already been made. They
concentrated on luxury sales methods
as well as specialised merchandise
lines. However, as the sharp division
between income groups has tended to
disappear, specialty stores have learnt
new methods of making the best of
both worlds by putting the very
highest price merchandise out where
the customer could see and feel it.
Self'selection has moved out of the
bargain-basement into the most elegant
Market Street shops. Designers are
showing that cost-cutting self'selection
methods can be accomplished without
sacrifice of the ease and elegance de'
manded by the old luxury store. The
skill of modern design has substituted
the luxury of a controlled physical en-
vironment for the luxury of service in
yesterday’s store to suit practically all
income groups.
The specialty stores have forced a
change in the big department store in
their creation of a “store within a
store” to offer their customers the
same advantages.
Another trend noticeable in America,
but noticeably absent in Sydney, is the
provision of facilities for off-street
parking. Apart from Grace Bros, in
the Haymarket no other Sydney store
provides parking space for their cus'
tomers.
In America this problem is so serious
that, for example, Milliron’s in Los
Angeles have converted the roof of
the building into a parking lot with
a ramp round the building and an
entrance for their customers from the
roof in escalator form.

Former Gestapo H.Q.
During the war the headquarters building of
the Danish Shell Company in Copenhagen
was taken over by the Gestapo and was the
subject of a well-aimed pin-point attack by
R.A.F. Mosquitoes. The upper timber floors
were destroyed, leaving only the reinforced
concrete frame of the ground floor more or
less intact. It has now been completely re-
built to the designs of architect Vilhelm
Lauritzen, using the old foundations and base-
ments and part of the ground floor frame.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING
September 24, 1952.


(continued from previous page)
The Los Angeles store of Sears,
Roebuck and Xkunpany has a roof
parking space for 475 cars accessible
by ramp where customers leave their
cars with an attendant and descend to
any one of the three attractive, air'
conditioned, artificially lighted and
windowless sales floors. This adds
enormously to the ease of shopping by
eliminating the constant and dreary
struggle to find a parking space.
Another store has been designed by
the store specialist architectural firm,
Ketchum, Gina and Sharp, in which
the whole building is raised up on stilts
to allow car parking underneath. The
customers enter from underneath by
escalators and the goods lifts are the
only obstructions to the clear space on
ground level.
The Vanishing Store Front.
Unlike the large department store,
the smaller shops cannot afford to buy
large volumes of radio and newspaper
advertising space to bring customers
into their shops. They start selling
right on the street by converting the
whole store into a giant show case.
By omitting the usual ton hamper and
carrying the glass from awning to
floor level, the open front is carried
to its limit. Small movable display
cases brilliantly lit are placed against
the large windows. The skilful archi-
tect disposes these cases with consider'
able care so that they do not interfere
with the general view of the store.
Screens or drapes are often pro'
vided for completely closing'in the
open front for occasional display varia-
tion.
The recessed front, as for example
in Turner’s Men’s Store in Pitt Street,
has the following advantages:—
1. It has brought the pavement
right into the store.
2. It has given the shopper some'
where to stand without blocking
the traffic.
3. It has provided more display
space than the old'fashioned
front.
4. It has proved economic for the
typical small store building site,
a narrow section with length
usually in bad proportion to
depth.
5. It has caught the pedestrian’s
eye better than windows parallel
with the street.
The open front presents a major
problem in counteracting glare and
reflection. Reflected sky brightness
will render anything inside these glass
fronts invisible. Various devices
window lighting, awnings, canvas
blinds, slanting glass are used to
assist. It has been estimated that de'
structive glare is reached when reflect'
ed glare is more than three times the
brightness of the window interior. In
an average street reflected brightness
can easily be from 10 to 30 times what
can be economically created by store
window lighting.
The open front also presents a
problem in lighting the store interior
to which few architects pay enough
attention. Inside the level of illumina'
tion must be stepped up to offset the
front daydighting.
Sales Counters.
In place of the glass cases and solid
counters the trend is to expose the
merchandise as much as possible. The
wall cases are now being supplanted by
open shelving cantilevered on brackets.
The solid counter base, which carried
the forward stock, is replaced by
island fixtures on light legs, thereby
adding to the openness of the store.
These units are frequently placed
against the wall where both customer
and assistant can circulate freely
around them. In the new Wallach
Store in Jamaica, glass has been em
tirely eliminated from the wall and
island cases in order to remove even
further the barrier between customer
and merchandise.
Flexibility.
The keynote of modern store design
is flexibility. In the old uninteresting
square layout plan, with fixed coum
ters, on ofTdays the busy atmosphere,
which is an essential to selling, is de-
stroyed. The movable island counter
plan enables the changes in seasonal
demand for various goods to be quick'
ly met by expanding some departments
and contracting others with the mini'
mum of difficulty.
These fluctuations must be* met by
changes in floor plan, sales counters,
lighting and partitioning.
Another new factor influencing the
floor layout is the trend to do away
with reserve stock. Stores now try and
place as much reserve stock as possible
right next to the sales space, either
by peripheral storage or by introducing
small stock magazines.
The Flexible Ceiling.
To'day the aim is to incorporate
all mechanical services as integral part
of the store building instead of at'
tacking them later. The most revolu'
tionary change in store design is the
dry'built, flexible ceiling, which em
ables a complete change in floor plan
overnight.
With a plaster ceiling, light fixtures
were usually installed in an overall pat'
tern. This illuminated everything to
the same degree; both sales fixtures
and floors were being illuminated to
the same extent as the merchandise it'
self. With flexible lighting, no light
need be wasted on floors and furniture.
The sales counter can be placed where
needed and the lights concentrated on
the merchandise.
Flexible ceilings are of two main
types: —
1. The overall louvre or egg'crate
ceiling, with lighting, air ' con'
ditioning, sprinklers hung above
the louvres.
2. The dry panel ceiling with
opaque panels (acoustic tile, ply'
UNUSUAL CONSTRUCTION.
To say the least the construction depicted in these two examples is rather extraordinary. The
lefthand view is a corner of an American Service Station in which the roof is supported by a
series of sloping pipes that have a very nautical affect. That on the right is an unusual
Florida house in which the architect, Igor B. Polevitzky, has developed large but inexpensive,
semi-tropical living areas. It is stated that the Douglas Fir frame was designed to withstand
hurricane winds of 150 miles per hour and is anchored in reinforced concrete footings.
In Florida owners who do not effect repairs after the last hurricane are fined if the next
hurricane comes along before such repairs have been effected. When the writer was there a
few years ago, one hotel proprietor was find £5OOO for this offence. The hurricane from the
year before had rendered the upper part of his hotel unfit for occupation and he had failed to
re-build it in time to offer resistance to the next hurricane.

wood, building board, etc.), ah
ternating with lighting panels
into which incandescent lighting
fixtures are built as required by
the sales layout.
It appears that Macy’s standard prac'
tice is to alternate 4 feet by 4 feet
dry panels with lighting squares to
give a pattern to the lighting arrange'
ment,
Messrs. Ketchum, Gina and Sharp
have worked out a flexible ceiling
which makes it possible to direct light
precisely where needed. In this sys'
tern, panels equipped with light are
spotted above the sales fixtures. Panels
above aisles do not have built'in light'
ing equipment.
One standard adopted by the light'
ing specialist is to make the merchan'
dise itself at least three times as bright
as any surrounding surface. This is
accomplished by direct illumination
from shielded or recessed sources, sup'
plemented by some indirect or diffused
lighting.
Where merchandise lighting is in'
stalled in the ceiling, overspill from
this direct source can be counted on
to illuminate aisle space. This direct
downlighting is usually supplemented
by perimeter lighting to illuminate wall
surfaces and by some indirect or up'
lifting to illuminate lightless portions
of the ceiling.
My own preference in lighting is
for a combination of both incandes'
cent and fluorescent light. The direc'
tional incandescent creates highlight
and shadows to bring out form and
texture; the diffused fluorescent illu'
minates detail in the shadows and pre'
vents too great a brightness contrast
between merchandise and surrounding
area.
In any consideration of interior
store design it seems apparent that the
trend must be towards the combined
attack by the architect and the light'
ing specialist in consultation. Failure
in the past has been largely due to
the completion of the building without
prior thought of the lighting effects.
The structure under such circumstances
imposes problems which cannot be
satisfactorily overcome when the light'
ing specialist comes to do his work.
In America the consultation between
specialists takes place in the most
initial stage of the designing.
DISCUSSION.
Many subjects vital to store de'
signers were raised in the discussion.
Most questions were hinged around
the need for flexibility in store light'
ing. The dry built ceiling, with its
removable panels, was one successful
solution to this problem. Even the
louvred ceiling could be used for
flexibility by the use of a welhdesigned
switching system . The advantages of
false ceilings in remodelling old shops
were enthusiastically discussed.
The vanishing shop'front was also
the subject of several suggestions—
tilting the glass to prevent reflections
from outside, increasing the illumina'
tion in the window, and continuing
the awning ceiling through to the
ceiling of tlie shop were all mentioned,
some original slants on old ideas being
presented.
In the inevitable comparison be'
tween Australian developments and
those from overseas. Mr. Bunning said
that in the whole field of display
Americans were more adventurous
than Australians. It was agreed that
many ideas accepted overseas were
slow in being adopted here. The
opinion was expressed that, if we were
to create sufficient demand for such
things as suspended ceilings using
acoustic tiles, the demand would be
met by Australian industry at reason'
able cost.
Mr. Stafford, speaking on behalf of
the visiting Institute, commented that
many of the questions put to Mr.
Bunning, an architect, were those that
architects usually ask illuminating en'
gineers.

interchange of two of their branch
engineers. The engineers affected and
their new positions are set out as fob

Mr. A. B. Robertson, B.E. (Adel.),
formerly of Brisbane Branch, becomes
engineer for South Australia.
Mr. B. G. Wregg, formerly of
Adelaide Branch, becomes engineer
for Queensland.
These two engineers will be respom
sible to the Chief Engineer for the
electrical and mechanical engineering
activities of the company in their re'
spective States.
ATOM-BOMB AND ART.
The Americans—like the Romans—are great builders and they no sooner decide to erect a
new structure than they are right on the job. The building is the new structure for
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at the Walter Reed Medical Centre, Washington. It
is an eight-storey building of reinforced concrete designed to resist A-bomb blast. Building
below—believe it or not —is the new Layton School of Art at Milwaukee. The building is
70ft. x 100 ft. in plan, and has but two rows of columns along the long axis 22ft. apart and
supporting cantilevered spans of 24ft. on either side.

Floor Sanding for the
Master Builder
Various Types of Finish.
By DOUGLAS McPHERSON.
Floor sanding is the last operation
to be performed prior to the comple'
tion of a building job. Undoubtedly
the dustiest and noisiest workmen are
the sanders while they are operating,
but their finished job is not the least
spectacular. Whether it is merely a
“rough'off” or a “sand and polish
right through” the floors will be trans'
formed as all traces of the comings
and goings of other trades disappear
in a haze of dust.
The builder for whom the work is
being performed should be aware of
what is required in the light of the
ultimate the owner. Time and
again private individuals require floors
sanded and polished, explaining that
of course, this will not entail much
work as the floors were previously
rough'Sanded by the builder prior to
occupation! This statement indicates
lack of proper liaison and waste of
money. The previous sanding has
been for nought, for it is of no ad'
vantage to the next sander that some'
body else has rough sanded the floors
already. If anything the job is more
expensive, as differing techniques are
used for rough and fine sanding. A
better way would have been for build'
er and owner to have got together
and obtained a quote from sanding
contractors specifying a proportion for
rough sanding (the builder’s share of
the expense) and the additional sand'
ing and polishing. This, of course, is
often done, but less often than desir'
able from the point of view of the
private house buyer.
Unless the builder’s client can afford
wall to wall carpet throughout the
new house, polishing all floors except
the kitchen is the only practical ah
ternative. The taste for linos has
waned, and comparative prices show
that even the toughest hardwood will
sand and polish for less than one'third
the cost of lino and for one'tenth the
cost of carpet.
STRUCTURAL DETAILS OF SILO BUILDING IN INDIA.
This building for the storage of ammonium sulphate at Sindri, India, measures 660 feet in length, 143ft. 9in. in floor width and 81ft. in height.
The length is divided into 22 sections of 30 feet each and each section is stiffened by four external arch ribs as shown in the plan view at the
right, which also shows a section through the elevator shaft at the northern end. The roof slab is 6in. thick throughout except for the in-
creases to 24in. at crown and springings. The ribs are 4ft. 6in. deep. The end walls, as in the south end at lower right, are independent
structures of columns and sin. walls. Entrance to the silo floor is by three air locks on one side. Suspended from the arch crown is a steel
framing carrying the filling conveyor belt. Below the centre of the floor is the tunnel accommodating the discharge conveyor belt. Toe
quasi-parabolic vault profile is obtained by three circular arcs of 130 ft., 40ft. 6in. and 130ft. radii.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


In any case it is desirable that a
more exact knowledge of what the
builder requires from the operator
and what the operator can do for the
builder will prove of advantage.
Rough Sanding.
The building is a contract job and
the builder is required to have the
floors rough sanded. What he requires
is sanding which will leave the floors
clean from the many spots, stains and
marks which have gone into them
and at the same time knock down the
bumps and ridges where boards are
uneven.
The operator, having been asked
merely for a rough sand, will come
on to the fob with a plentiful supply
of his coarsest and quickest cutting
paper and will go right through the
house across the boards. Having done
so he will disc'sand the edges, sweep
up and dust down and move off. His
outlay in the most expensive grades
of paper will be countered by the
relatively short time he has been
obliged to spend; it is a large house
which one man cannot do in a day.
The kitchen has taken a little more
of his time than the other rooms as
he has assumed it is to be for lino,
and so has made sure it' is perfectly
level. But unless the floor through'
out is a particularly good one the
sanding which has taken place has
not levelled it sufficiently for many
things but underfelted materials.
A Level Sand.
So if a level sand is required it will
be at the cost of more time and more
sandpaper. Each floor must be worked
on until it levels down to the lowest
depth. Not only cross cutting (the
quickest way of cleaning a floor) but
diagonal cutting will be necessary as
well, and the sanding contractor will
probably quote the job by the square
rather than by the day (or by the full
house) as for rough sanding. So, if
the client insists on laying-linos only
.level sanding should be specified to
the sanding contractor.
Smooth Sanding.
There is an intermediate degree of
floor sanding which appeals to the
builder whose job is for resale. With
his prospective buyer the first impres-
sion when he opens the front door
will count for much, and the floors
must impress him no less than the
rest of the finished house. What this
builder requires is smooth sanding, a
compromise between rough sanding
(which takes the dirt away but leaves
cross marks from the coarse paper')
and polishing, which, in this partk'
ular case perhaps, is a little further
than he wishes to go. To make a
smooth sand the machinist cleans the
floors with a right angular cut, but
as appearance is the major considera'
tion swings his sander around so that
the finish is with the boards, remov-
ing most of the scour marks left from
the cutting action of the coarse paper.
In the case of most hardwoods such
action wil leven impart a dull lustre
to the boards, making in all a pleas'
ing appearance.
Fine Sanding.
Fine sanding without polishing is
not to be recommended from most
practical points of view. When it is
asked for it is generally required by
some owner'builder who will try any'
thing once and is certain that h~ will
save himself pounds and get the same
first class fob. In practice the only
work which the sander operator has
not put into such a job is the sealing
and the waxing. Before a floor can
be called ready for surfacing all edges
and corners have to be hand scraped
(a laborious task) and nail hples and
faults filled. The application of a
few shillings worth of wax is not the
deciding factor between a good and a
bad fob, but the degree of patient
care which have preceded.
Unless this waxing is done within
twentv'four hours the chances are that
the fine surface will be spoilt, and the
work and the. money expended for
nought. Better to go the rest of the
way and have the fob completely
finished.
To summarise then, floor sanding
comes in any of five categories:
1. Rough Sanding: Cleaning the
floors and cutting down the rough
edges; the usual minimum require'
ment. It is done across the grain, and
the finished job is. except on excel'
lent floors, only suitable for carpet
laving.
2. Level Sanding: Diagonal cutting
to ensure that each surface is smooth
and no ridges or hollows are present'
ed to show through the rubber or
lino which eventually will be laid.
3. Smooth Sanding: A combination
of 1 and 2 above, with the cross
marks removed for appearance sake.
For further effect a coat of floor seal'
er can be applied.
4. Fine Sanding: A surface good
enough for polishing,’ with filling of
nail holes requisite, though not neces'
sarily done bv the sander'operator.
Unless wax is applied such an elab'
orate surface serves no good purpose.
5. Sanding and Polishing: Finished
floors which, with proper care, will
last for the life of the building with'
out further outlay.
VAULT-ROOFED SILO BUILDING IN INDIA.
The upper view shows a completed building at Sindri, India, for the storage of ammonium
sulphate. It is 660 feet long in 30ft. sections. The lower view illustrates the method of con-
structing the vault slab and external stiffening ribs at 10ft. intervals. There are two complete
30ft. wide arch centres, lined with galvanised iron on timber sheeting and supported on eight
towers and pairs of bogies running on rails on the concrete floor. In the travelling position
there is a gap of 4 inches all round. 32 jacks of 5-ton capacity raise the arch centres. Work
is carried on from an exterior arched gantry of steel framing which moves the rib forms forward
to a new. section and also the rib reinforcement cages previously assembled on a completed
section. The rib forms also hold the exterior shutters which are raised with each day’s shift.
The rib forms are bolted to the arch centres through spacer blocks. Concrete is poured uni-
formly from both sides of the arch (see opposite).

WONDERFUL WESTMINSTER
The Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Com-
mons, Brigadier Sir Charles Alfred Howard,
Q.C.V.0., has the task of maintaining de-
corum in the Chamber an dseeing that strang-
ers observe the regulations. Sir Alfred, seen
about to precede the Speaker into the House
with the mace, has held office since 1935.
He was formerly in the King’s Royal Rifles.
It is the Sergeant-at-Arms who has to observe
the custom of slamming the door in the face
of Black Rod. He re-opens the door after
looking through the peephole to see that no
armed force from the King is with Black Rod,
as happened in Charles I.’s reign.
Big Ben’s four clock faces each measure 22
feet 6 inches in diameter and each minute is
a foot square. Glass in this face was shat-
tered during the air raid that destroyed the
nearby House of Commons. The tower gets
its name from the largest bell named Big
Ben, which in turn was named after Sir
Benjamin Hall, Chief Works Commissioner
at the time the bell was Hung. The clock
faces can be seen from far off, also the light
which shines when parliament is in night
session, but through the B.B.C. Big Ben’s
chimes regularly reach listeners in all Con-
tinents. The chimes reached us by wireless
during the war in all outposts of Empire
and we were satisfied that at least “Big Ben"
remained intact. Long after the war had
ended we were informed that the chimes we
had heard came from Bristol, and that every-
thing of value had been dismantled and placed
out of harm’s way.

Westminster-The Seat Of Government
CRADLE OF DEMOCRACY AT THE FOOT OF BIG BEN.
Unlike much of London which has
changed character many times during
the centuries, Westminster has had
only one role for 1,000 years—the seat
of Government. This was the cradle
in which the Anglo-Saxon conception
of democracy was nurtured.
Although to-day the surroundings
are very different from the Thames
marshes which flanked King Canute’s
first Palace of Westminster, it remains
the administrative and legislative centre
of England, also of the United King'
dom and the Colonies. Here the
voice of the people has made itself
heard, growing in strength through
the evolution of Parliamentary democ'
racy.
Revered National Shrine.
As silent witnesses of the steady
progress of this democracy into the
middle of the 20th Century stand
Westminster Abbey, Britain’s most re'
vered national shrine, and a few hum
dred yards away the older parts of the
Palace of Westminster particularly
Westminster Hall which have sur-
vived successive disasters. Along this
way have come all England’s monarchs
in their respective reigns, and the
solemn, austere figure of Oliver Crom'
well is there in bronze as a reminder
of the days when democratic govern'
ment in Britain went through its test'
ing time.
To'day, amid the shrines and
memorials of Britain’s past, her
Government is carried on. In busy
Whitehall the pilgrims who come as
tourists mingle with the more formally'
dressed officials of the Government
offices which dominate this part of
London. In contrast to the staid
lines of the Whitehall offices, secreted
in a cul'de'sac that must be one of
the busiest in the world for its size,
is the simple officediome of the Prime
Minister, Downing Street’s “Number
Ten,’’ in which so many momentous
decisions have been made.
Heart of the Commonwealth.
The routine work of Government
cannot dull a scene that is also the
backcloth to the ceremonial and
pageantry so beloved by Londoners
and visitors alike. Any day the two
silent Guardsmen mounted in White'
hall attract their little knot of spec'
tators, but on the great days of State
Openings of Parliament, Coronations
and Royal Weddings the streets are
crammed with those who come to
watch the age'old ceremonies and the
members of the Royal Family who
play the leading roles.
Disastrous fires, wars, blitzes and
flying bombs have left their mark on
this still very active, throbbing heart
of the Commonwealth, but it has
always kept beating.
Now, with the new House of Com'
mons taking the place of the old,
bombed and burnt'out Chamber at the
foot of Big Ben’s 316'foot tower,
Westminster is back to normal again,
ready to provide the setting for what'
ever may be ahead.

HUGE PROJECT NEARS COMPLETION.
The huge building project which
British Paints (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. em-
barked upon some time ago in Gow
Street, Padstow, N.S.W., is now near-
ing completion, and the firm expects
to be in full occupation in December.
Set in six acres, the main' buildings
cost £250,000, and will become units
of one of Australia’s most modern
paint factories.
The buildings were erected under
the firm’s own Clerk of Works, with
the assistance of several subcontract'
ors.
Planned on the most modern pro'
duction lines, the buildings comprise
the administration block, laboratory
block, amenities section and main fac'
tory, with varnish room, synthetic res'
ins building and raw materials storage
building, in addition to colour works.
Twelve staff cottages are also in course
of erection.
When the project is fully complet'
ed, 200 persons will be employed,
operating the latest equipment, some
imported, and some Australian'made.
The company is at present in pro-
duction in Paddington and operates
a branch factory in Adelaide, with
branch offices in Melbourne and BnV
bane and representatives throughout
the other States. The company manu'
factures well known brands of Brit'
ish, Taylors, Buffalo, Torpedo and
facksons Paint Products.
The parent company is British

Death of Great National Benefactor
—Sir William Dixson.
(continued from page 18)
and joined the family business of
Dixson & Sons Ltd., Tobacco Merch'
ants, later becoming a director of the
British Australian Tobacco Co. Ltd.,
into which Dixson & Sons merged.
In his zest as a collector over near'
ly fifty years he followed in the foot'
steps of his father, Sir Hugh Dixson.
Historic Portraits.
The Dixson Gallery of the Public
Library, opened in 1925, includes the
most important portraits of such men
as Cook, Banks, Sydnev, Macquarie,
Macarthur. Bourke, and hundreds of
pictures of early Australia.
In addition to the pictures, his
books and manuscripts, which were
being transferred from his home to
the Library at the time of his death,
are an unrivalled collection of mater'
ial of national and international inter'
est.
The Hodges portrait of Captain
Cook, which is in the Dixson collec'
tion, is considered to be the finest
and most accurate in existence.
Dr. H. V. Evatt. President of the
Trustees of the Public Library of
N.S.W., in paying tribute to Sir
William said:
“The Australian nation has been
fortunate in the big'minded and gen'
erous men who have collected the ma'
terials of its history, made them avail'
able for students and to the people
generally, and provided endowments
for additions to them. There has
been no greater name than that of
Mitchell in this respect, and Sir
William’s will rank with his.”
In addition to many gifts in the
past Sir William had ©illy last year
donated £15,000 more to the Public
Library for additions to the Dixson
Wing; until these are carried out the
interest on this sum will be used to
acquire early portraits and other ma-
terial.
When the important additions to
the Library were being built in 1939
Sir William gave the Chaucer windows
in the main Reading Room and the
bronze Entrance Doors, which are a
memorial to his great predecessor as a
benefactor to the Library, David Scott
Mitchell.
He was also interested in Armidale
University College and gave £2500
for a Library. Like Mr. Howard
Hinton, who gave the magnificent
collection of pictures that are at the
same establishment at Armidale, Sir
William was a and their col'
lections became their major interest
in life, though both were also prom-
inent business men.
It is men like these who “plough
back” in the cultural sense what they
have received from the land of their
birth that establish and enhance its
cultural heritage. Australia requires—
and deserves —many more. —A.A.

Designing Steel
Awnings To Limit
Attacks Of Corrosion
Specially written by J. Murray*
Problem of Corrosion
in Awnings.
Ever since the dawn of time man
has been faced with the problem of
decay and disintegration of materials.
The engineer, the architect, the
builder and the property-owner use a
number of measures designed to re'
duce. inhibit, resist or even prevent
the onslaught of corrosion. These
measures may be the use of certain
corrosion-resistant metals as copper or
zronze; metallic coatings as zinc gal-
vanising, “rust-proofing of steel by one
of several phosphate treatments and,
of course, painting.
A new approach is that of tackling
the problem of rusting and corrosion
on the drawing board, and it is an
approach that has already met with
considerable success in structural steel
awning work.
Hitherto structural steel awnings,
whether of the suspended or cantilever
type, have followed an almost stan-
dardised fabricated design being built
up of mild steel plate, bars, angles
and strips either riveted or bolted to-
gether to form the awning fascia.
Corrosion of such awning fascias is
readily noticeable even soon after
painting by the presence of rust
streaks from bolt and rivet heads and
from bars and strips forming the con-
ventional awning fascia.
In the coastal areas, and particularly
along the surfing beaches, the main-
tenance and painting necessary on
laminated type steel awnings is one of
considerable expense.
Every lamination, every bolt or rivet
head provides a point of lodgement
for films of rain water and moisture.
Whether or not these films are charged
with salt, they are still highly active
chemically, for they contain dissolved
oxygen and CO2 as well as dissolved
waste gases in the industrial areas.
The onset of corrosion by such films
of moisture, reposing in the lamina-
tions, is further promoted by the im-
purities common to all structural
grades of steel.
Absent in “Clearline”
Awnings.
The realisation of this weakness of
the laminated, riveted awning fascia
has resulted in the “Clearline” awning
by J. Murray Steel Works Pty. Ltd.,
an awning fascia without exterior bars,
strips, rivets or bolts, or any points of
lodgement for collection and seepage
of moisture films. Furthermore, the
“Clearline” design of awning costs no
more than the old, conventional fab'
ricated type.
This new design of awning fascia
presents to the weather the smooth,
unbroken, one'piece surface of a press'
ing. The steel employed is a special
flanging steel metallurgically of the
right structure and analysis for form'
mg by cold pressing, which is per'
formed m one operation on a 1500'ton
hydraulic press. The resultant “mould'
ed section presents not only an em
hanced appearance from an architec'
tural standpoint over the usual riveted
fascia, but is a stronger, more rigid
fascia plate.
Full Protection from Weather.
In erection, all attachments and con'
nections of the fascia to the trusses
and rafters, as well as connections of
abutting ends of fascia, are made be'
hind the fascia and are thus protected
rom the weather

superimposed or live load tests, ex'
ceeds the requirements of the Stan'
dards Association and the Council of
ty t j l 110 ?’ and ,^ s muc h as
50% overload has been added without
further deflection.
Cl earline awnings can be of any
length, presenting a run of fascia with
no places tor rain and moisture to lie
and start corrosion. The design in'
corporates smgle'piece steps for chang'
mg awn in" height, and round or angle
corners tor change of direction and for
tascia returns. The illustration shows

"Houses Hard
To Sell"
Treasurer Points to Present
Difficulties,
In presenting his Budget the Treas'
urer , Sir Arthur Fadden, specifically
referred to building and cited some
of its problems.
After mentioning that industries
which expanded too rapidly are now
finding that, with a levelling off in
monetary demand, their products are
increasingly hard to sell. Sir Arthur
continued.
“The same is true of industries in
which costs have risen faster and
further than in other industries,”
Building An Outstanding Example,
“Building is probably the outstand'
ing example of this difficulty. Such
good progress was made with housing
that the number of dwellings being
completed passed the late of 80,000
a year. At the same time, however,
costs have been forced up inordinately,
so that the purchase of a home has
ri sen beyond the reach of more and
more people. As a result there is a
strong tendency for people to hold off
purchasing homes in the hope that a
reduction in costs will make it more
financially practicable for them to do
so. In consequence the number of
commencements of new houses began
to fall. In the March quarter of this
year 18,800 new houses were com'
menced throughout Australia, com-

pared with 20,700 in the preceding
quarter.
“This fall in housing commence'
ments has not been due to bank ad'
vance policy or to any diminution in
the provision of housing finance by
Commonwealth authorities. Last year
the Commonwealth Government and
its agencies made available some £7o,'
000,000 for housing finance. This year
it will provide approximately £Bo,'
000,000.
Heavy Strains on Economy.
These factors threw many unexpect'
ed and heavy strains on the economy,
but at the same time removed many
elements in the wave of accidental
prosperity which in 1950'51 bade fair
to engulf us. They assisted also to
lessen the extreme inflationary pres'
sure from which Australia was suffer'
ing.
Pointing to signs that the basic posh
tion was far sounder than it was a
year ago. Sir Arthur Fadden said that.
in the first six months of this year out'
out of black coal was almost 25 per
cent, greater than in the correspond'
mg period of 1951. Output of basic
steel products had increased substam
dally.
Labour shortages had disappeared in
most districts and industries, while
most of the basic industries had gain'
ed more labour.
The railways were now moving
more goods traffic, the turn round of
ships at ports was faster, and conges'
tion at the wharves had eased.
Is there Something
“Screwy”
With Legislation
“Gallows for Darwin” made head'
line news with 8” of space devoted
to the morbid subject in one of the
Dailies. It was built for two for-
eigners who killed a taxi driver. They
were quietly hanged during the week.
Most people will agree that any'
one who will be so craven as to kill
a taxi driver is unworthy of breathing
the same air as good people going
honourably about their simple, daily
duties, but, the question arises, will the
gallows be used for the newcomers to
Australia, whilst the older Australians
escape capital punishment? Many taxi
drivers have been killed. Murderers
receive a life sentence. Many crimin'
als are put in jail for a period, and
then get let out to practice their foul
deeds on others?
We have read of homes that have
been broken into, women and child'
ren who have been accosted, brutally
handled and raped by depraved crim'
inals who after serving only a part of
their sentences for similar misdeeds,
have been let loose to do them again.
The existing law does provide the
death sentence for those guilty of
murder, and it should be applied to
one and all or abolished for one and
all.
Human nature in the individual is
not altered by a sentence. As in the
animal kingdom a deer is always gentle
because it is his nature, whilst snakes,
lions and tigers are to be feared and
put permanently behind bars or killed
are to live in peace.
GREAT LAKES CAUSE FLOOD
DAMAGE.
$61,250,000 Involved.
N.S.W. is not the only part of the
world that is having flood damage,
for a recent issue of “Engineering
News'Record” shows that extraordin'
ary high levels in the Great Lakes
have caused a total of $61,250,000
(£A.27,443,000) along the shore
lines during the past twelve months.
Wave action caused the majority of
the damage, while inundation was re'
sponsible for the rest.
Damage to Lake Michigan was the
worst at $30,640,000, which equalled
$18,700 per mile of shore line, but
the other lakes all suffered as follows;
Lake Superior ($4,360,000), Lake
Ontario ($7,350,000), Lake Huan
($2,740,000), and Lake St. Clair
($4,240,000).
Long range study of the causes arc
recommended by Col. Wendell P.
Trower, of the Corps of Engineers.
One hardly associates “Glorious
Devon” with devastating floods yet
the world was horrified to read of the
terrible catastrophe at Lynmouth when
the raging river engulfed the town
and drowned some thirty people in'
eluding two Australian girl hikers.
Nature is patient, but from time to
time shows her terrifying power.

Book Review
Mastic Asphalte Work.
By F. E. Drury and
A. W. Gittins.
183 pp. Index. Illustrated.
Crosby Lockwood & Sons Ltd.,
London. English price, 10/6.
It is no exaggeration to state that
the most important aspect of building
construction, next to structural sta-
bility, is ensuring that there is no
penetration of moisture into a build-
ing from any source.
In the performing of this important
task natural asphalte clays a vital role.
It is to ensure that those that are
handling this material are properly
trained in its application to achieve the
best results that this book has been
prepared.
That the authors are particularly
well qualified to produce this work is
evidenced by the fact that Mr. Drury
is a Master of Science and a Member
of the Institution of Structural En-
gineers and Mr. Gittins a member of
the National Joint Council for the
Mastic Asphalt Industry and chairman
of the London Joint Apprenticeship
Committee.
In the Preface they state: “If cor-
rectly specified and properly prepared,
mastic asphalte is very durable, but
the importance of good and reliable
workmanship in spreading, lapping and
jointing cannot be over-estimated.
Given a clear understanding of pur-
pose and method in the application of
asphalte and equipped with a know-
ledge of the nature and qualities of the
asphalte mixtures available, the crafts-
man is well prepared to undertake the
responsibility of producing clean, well
laid, reliable and durable coverings for
any required purpose.”
With the increasing use of the flat
roof in contemporary work, the im-
portance of reliable workmanship in
this sphere becomes vital.
This book on British practice should
be of value to all connected with this
section of the building industry.

MECHANICAL INSTALLATION OF HOSPITALS
AS SEEN BY AN ARCHITECT.
Extracts from a paper by Robert S. Demaine, F.R.1.8.A., F.R.A.I.A.
Delivered before the A.N.Z.A.A.S. Congress, Sydney, on August 27, 1952.
This subject is not so vast as it is
intricate in detail, so one cannot hope
in a paper of this kind to cover all
the detailed consideration of the sub-
ject, or for that matter to cover the
different kinds of hospitals, each of
which can produce an entirely differ-
ent set of circumstances for the Mech-
anical Installation.
The modern hospital is by far the
most complex mixture of building and
science known to our profession. The
mechanical and electrical installations
of a moderate to large size hospital
cost approximately one-third of the
total cost of the construction of the
unit. These services when installed in
a building must be available for var-
ious uses throughout the length and
breadth of the structure and yet be in-
conspicuous as far as the patient and
visitor to the hospital is concerned,
principally because one of the main
objects of careful design in a modern
hospital is to eliminate as far as pos-
sible the institutional appearance of
the building.
Availability of Steam.
One aspect of the different set of
circumstances can be briefly discussed
if consideration is given to extreme
cases such as a city or district hospi-
tal as compared with a small country
hospital. The former have all services,
mostly all fully available for 24 hours
every day, whilst the latter has reduc-
ed services which may be only in op-
eration during daylight hours. In.
both cases there is throughout the 24
hours of each day the possibility of
service requirements in case of med-
ical emergency. The main part of
this paper, however, deals with the
larger type of hospital.
In all hospital construction some
general principles are involved not
the least of which is economics. The
problem has been faced on numerous
occasions where a three-shift of boiler
attendants each 24 hours has been
out of the question economically for
the amount of service required by a
small hospital. Nevertheless there is
always the likelihood of an emergency
some time during the night when full
steam service is not available.
I know of cases in the late 20’s
where a wood fired boiler of a coun-
try hospital has been banked at about
4 p.m. and although calorifiers are
large and hot water supply will last
until the morning, the steam supply
in case of emergency—such as cas-
ualty, operation or a maternity case
—is non-existent, so the hospital en-
gineer is telephoned and he reports
for duty, stokes the furnace and duly
the steam pressure is restored. None
of us can consider this satisfactory. I
am emphasising the economics of
closing down the boilers as compared
with the availability of steam in an
emergency.
In the last few months a Victorian
country hospital with bed accommo-
dation for 145 patients has been ah
tered and the whole of the mechanh
cal services changed from electricity
to steam. The main boiler is fired
with brown coal and is steaming from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m. but is then banked
for the night. The stand-by is an oil-
fired coiled type boiler which starting
from cold will produce 100 lb. per sq.
inch in a few minutes. It is automatic
in operation and does not require the
full time services of a boiler attend-
ant. Although steam could be made
available in a short period from either
source I recommend to the hospital
board that the best way to overcome
the night emergency is to have on
hand additional set-ups of sterile in-
struments.
When consideration is given to a
medium sized acute hospital with a
bed capacity of between 200 and 300
beds, because of its size we shall not
have the problem of “no steam” load
during the night, and there will be a
boiler attendant on duty throughout
the 24 hours of the day.
The Architect and Hospital Design.
Let us examine the build up of the
scheme starting from the beginning
as an Architect sees it, but with par-
ticular reference to the mechanical in-
stallation.
The function of an Architect is to
design the hospital so as to fulfil the
medical requirements in the best and
most effective and economical manner,
consistant with fulfilment of the pur-
pose to be served. For production of
a well conceived scheme, the closest
collaboration of medical, nursing and
administrative, architectural and en-
gineering advisors should be obtained
before the site is selected. This col-
laboration should continue through-
out all the subsequent stages of plan-
ning (using the word “planning” in
its widest sense). To ensure a suc-
cessful scheme a complete set of doc-
uments must be prepared to show
every detail of the building and the
installation of the services and equip-
ment.
Teamwork is essential in working
out the scheme in detail. The Archi-
tect must have the advice of the hos'
pital committee or State authority who
will determine requirements, and from
the earliest stages he must bring in
the constructional engineer, the heat'
ing and ventilating engineer and other
specialists as they are required during
the course of the development of the
plan. Public demand for hospitaliza-
tion has greatly increased in recent
years, not because disease has increased
but because of the discoveries of mod'
ern medical science and the means and
resources of effective treatment have
greatly expanded. Surgical progress
is such that surgical design in equip'
ment is continually growing to keep
pace, with modern requirements. The
advancement in medical treatment
joins with surgical progress in de'
manding for hospital patients that full
use be made of new techniques in
Builders' Hoist of Steel
Scaffolding
A Minnesota, U.S.A., manufacturer of sec-
tional steel scaffolding units has developed
this type of hoisting tower from the standard
interlocking units. 'Either one or two hoisting
wells may be included in the tower. Each
well has a loading capacity of 1000 lb. The
firm also supplies standardised hoisting equip-
ment, including cathead pulleys, wire ropes,
cages, slow-up brake for the descending cage,
emergency brake and also the mount for the
driving motor or petrol engine.

(continued from page 55)
planning the construction of hospitals.
During the last few years the increas'
ed modern hospital efficiency together
with contemporary treatment methods
has reduced the length of stay in hos'
pitals by more than one half. In
order to limit or reduce the rising cost
of hospital care and to meet the de'
mand for the more advanced medical
technique, the contemporary hospital
must not only comply with present
requirements, but owing to the num'
ber of years which its usefulness will
serve, be constructed with vision and
allow for adaptation to meet the pro'
gress of science. The mechanical ser'
vices and equipment within the fram'
ed structure of contemporary design
is the keynote of modernity as applied
to a hospital. This last statement can
be verified by numerous examples—a
hospital completed only a few years
ago would probably require consider'
able expansion in one or another De'
partment. For instance let us consider
the Pharmacy—the manufacture of sa'
line and intrawenous solutions has
lately greatly increased with the con'
sequent requirement of mechanical
equipment to assist in this process.
Again, throughout the Commonwealth
the vast majority of sterilizing for in'
struments and utensils is carried out
by boiling water sterilizers whilst the
investigation of efficiency in sterilizing
indicates that higher temperatures are
necessary to kill all the spores likely
to be encountered in a hospital. The
change over to high pressure steam
sterilizers in a hospital has a consid'
erable impact on the steam installation
practically throughout the building.
This is a day of specialization, and
suppose the question were put to all
branches of the medical profession I
feel sure that the majority of those
interested in special departments would
refer to the inadequacy of the facili'
ties in present'day hospitals or else
express the probable expansion re'
quirements in the immediate future.
What are Architects and Engineers
going to do about it? This is a chah
lenge to our professions. I cannot
give you a complete answer to this
problem, but I can submit for your
consideration the way in which many
of these problems are being faced up
to now, with a few probable solutions
of this problem.
Room for Expansion.
In planning a hospital it is essential
to plan for the ultimate development
of either the community requirements
and those of the site, or both—and
it is desirable always to have a little
“up the sleeve”. I am referring just
as much to the mechanical services as
I am to space requirements. Allow'
ance for additional boiler capacity,
equipment rooms and duct space is
desirable, so is the spare space which
may be planned in conjunction with
all departments, but in advocating this
I am not unmindful of economics.
There is a big question regarding the
economics of extra space and median'
ical allowances, and the problem of
having to make alterations to provide
for these at a later date should the
future medical practice require such
additions.
In the case of an expanding com'
munity the problem arises as to what
extent the hospital services can ecom
omically be expanded, and I would
suggest that for a “rule of thumb”
calculation that a 25% increase is a
maximum; the situation must be fac'
ed, that, if the original building pro'
gramme allows for a greater extension
than 25%, the services are too big for
an unknown period of development.
The authority controlling the develop'
ment would be much better advised
to provide another hospital unit at a
later date, and in the meantime to
serve the district by an adequate am-
bulance service.
Hospital Development in the
Latrobe Valley.
Perhaps there are few places in
Australia where such development has
taken place, and a short description
of hospitalisation in the Latrobe
Valley of Victoria will illustrate a wise
handling of this problem by the
Hospitals and Charities Commission
of Victoria.
The main District Hospitals are
proposed for Traralgon and Moe, the
former one being under construction.
These towns are on the outskirts of
open-cut mining and briquette factor'
ies at Morwell and Yallourn. A
Health Centre has been planned for
Morwell with substantial Out'Pat'
ients and Casualty Departments, and
those patients requiring hospitalization
will be admitted to the District Hos'
pitals by Ambulance Service. In the
meantime the Yallourn Hospital,
which had the largest administrative
and medical services in the area has
been extended to double the bed cap'
acity.
It has been the practice to construct
a multiple storey hospital so that the
external walls and floors and certain
structures, such as lift wells remain
permanent, and the partition walls can
be demolished, altered and replaced
to meet requirements. This all sounds
very easy and is possible of achieve'
ment, but so far, the Architect has
not found the suitable partition which
is easily moved, and the Engineer has
not found the flexible pipe work, ven'
tilating ducts, etc. One cannot pro'
phesy that anything is likely to come
of these demountable adjuncts in gen'
eral practice, but serious consideration
should be given to them for use in
special cases. Engineers are familiar
with the line up of electrical equip'
ment in factories by the use of bus'
bars—new machines can be installed
and positions of others altered with'
out the necessity of running new con'
duits. Can engineers economically de'
velop something similar for the instal'
lation of equipment, perhaps in a
sterilizing room or in a kitchen or
laundry?
Complete Aesepsis and Sterilization.
Modern surgery is now carried out
with the idea of complete aesepsis of
everything that comes in contact with,
or even close to the patient. Although
great care is taken at the present time
to obtain complete aesepsis, there is
ever present the fear of infection in
connection with surgery. If our pres'
ent equipment is not capable of at'
taining this ideal under certain condi'
tions, it is necessary for us to review
the present equipment and if neces'
sary build and instal new equipment
that will fully meet the requirements.
The Hospitals and Charities Commis'
sion, which is the statutory body for
hospitals and institutions in Victoria,
feel that the overseas trends are to de'
part from “Boiling Water” sterilisers,,
which is the most used type of sterih
izer at present in Australian institU'
tions.
It is proposed to form a Technical
Committee to advise what standards
are required, and preliminary work on
this matter is at present in hand at
the Melbourne University. This Sub'
Committee could then prepare a spec'

ification to meet the standard require-
ments. I submit for your considera-
tion that there is a strong consensus
of opinion that a change in sterilizing
technique is taking place which neces-
sitates the close study of the equip-
ment, which is used for this purpose.
For many years the accepted prin-
ciples throughout the world provided
for the washing of instruments and
utensils by hand and then boiling
them in water for 20 minutes, and
most hospitals have this equipment
installed for the purpose. Surgical
dressings, surgeons’ gowns, etc., are
sterilised in a steam pressure sterilizer
commonly known as an Autoclave.
If hospitals have been equipped for
many years with this type of equip-
ment then it is not to them that we
should look for any change in the
methods of sterilizing. Some hospital
administrators may be quite satisfied
with the sterilizing equipment and
technique because it has been gener-
ally successful—some few infections
from surgery or otherwise have been
blamed on to other causes —perhaps
the sutures used—but on the other
hand some hospitals or only ward
units in a hospital have not been so
fortunate.
Great difficulty has sometimes been
experienced in locating and eradicat-
ing the trouble. I know of cases where
the hospital staff have for years gone
through the process of using an Auto-
clave. hut when their autoclaves were
scientifically tested it was found that
insufficient heat was entering the
drums in which the dressing were plac-
ed to kill many spores which are quite
likely to have been present. If we aim
at complete aesepsis this state of af-
fairs cannot be allowed to continue.
The autoclaves must be equipped with
instruments which automatically regis-
ter the maintenance of sufficient heat
within the chamber for the required
duration of the sterilizing period.
Reverting to the boiling water ster-
ilizer it is a fact that temperature of
boiling water at sea level 212°F. is
insufficient to kill many spores that we
are likely to find present. Pathologists
and other laboratory workers, who
have made a particular studv of cer-
tain diseases or infections (such as tet-
anus) find that temperatures as low as
230°F. working for 15 minutes are
not as efficient as temperatures of
250°F. for a much shorter period; a
temperature of 273° for 3 minutes is
a sufficient heat to kill all resistant
spores.
The autoclave as we have known
it is double jacketed, and is now in
general use for sterilizing dressings.
It should be operated on a 20 lb.
steam pressure with a vacuum of not
less than 10”. The double-jacket has
a purpose of keeping the inner con-
tainer warm and reducing the time
taken to obtain the high temperature
necessary in the inner jacket. The
double-jacket also assists with drying
the dressings. As previously mention-
ed the modern autoclave must have
instruments capable of measuring the
heat within the inner chamber, and
determining that the heat is maintain-
ed for the required length of time
to kill all spores. If this is not so
the action of placing dressings through
the autoclave could become more than
a mockery.
The high speed pressure sterilizer
is really a small autoclave without a
vacuum and is a very useful piece of
equipment to have adjacent to sur-
gical departments. These sterilizers
are double-jacketed so that the inner
jacket is constantly warm. With a
steam pressure at 30 lb. per square
inch the temperature is equal to 273°
F. The reason for installing this ster-
ilizer is that if an unsteralized instru-
ment is required during an operation
it can be placed in the emergency
high speed sterilizer and in min-
utes will be perfectly safe for the sur-
geon’s use.
After an operation instruments and
utensils can be placed just as they
are in a tray made to fit the purpose
inside the instrument washer and ster-
ilizer. The total time required for
washing, sterilizing and drying of

these instruments is 14 minutes.
Hours of time are thus saved by the
operating room or central sterilizing
room staff because the hand cleaning
of instruments takes a considerable
time. This method of cleaning is also
much better for the preservation of
cutting edges on the instruments them-
selves. The sterilizing at a high tem-
perature, as already indicated, is more
efficient than the present method usu-
ally employed, viz., boiling water ster-
ilizers.
I am of the opinion that there are
sound reasons for a re-consideration
of the equipping of our hospitals to
comply with the arguments raised in
this talk. If this is accepted the mod-
ern hospitals should use high pressure
sterilizers for all purposes in a central
service and that operating suites should
have a group of high pressure ster-
ilizers adjacent to operating rooms.
Mobile Steam Plant.
Whilst listening to the A.B.C. News
I was attentive to a report from the
Director General of Medical Services
who appeals to the men and women of
Australia to train and be available to
cope with possible large scale casual-
ties in the event of war. He stated
that the capital cities of all States may
be vulnerable to submarine attack us-
ing guided missiles and maybe atomic
bombs—such a calamity would cause
casualties which would greatly exceed
the capacity of our hospital accommo-
dation. Perhaps also some of our hos-
pitals would be put out of action or
the mechanical services interrupted, in
which case the Director General states
that we should be prepared to use
municipal offices for the nursing of
casualties.
There is a solution to this problem,
viz., of mobile plant, each unit cap-
able of providing sufficient mechanical
services for these temporary hospitals.
The size of the plant and the attach-
ed equipment would have to be the
subject of investigation and would be
limited by the available accommoda-
tion in existing municipal buildings.
I inspected both Australian and Amer-
ican Mobile Laundry Units built for
the Army during the last war and by
comparison the proposal to build small
hospital mechanical units for hot
water supply and sterilizing would be
a reasonable proposition.
Australia is planning a defence of
the country by armed forces, and it
is most important to plan for our
civil defence. I now advocate the
Commonwealth Government be urged
to authorise the construction of a pro-
totype unit, and at the same time in-
stitute an Investigating Committee for
the development of emergency hospi-
tal equipment for defence purposes in
each of the capital cities of the Com-
monwealth.
The National Physical Laboratory
ACCURACY IN MEASUREMENT.
Book To Mark Jubilee.
Reviewed by Adrian Ashton.
The Jubilee Book of The National
Physical Laboratory, London, by John
Langdon-Davies has just been re-
ceived. It is an interesting and well-
produced little volume of 104 pages
tracing the growth over the last fifty
years of this organisation which to-day
plays such a vital part in the life of
Great Britain.
How It Began.
Nineteenth-century Britain took for
granted that the leadership of the
world in commerce and industry was,
and would remain, securely in her
hands. The English manufacturer was,
on the whole, slow to read the writing
on the wall, though it was easily
legible to those who were watching
the new Germany that began to take
form after the Franco-Prussian War.
If England was losing her supremacy
in manufactures and in commerce, it
was because of the English failure to
utilise to the fullest extent the lessons
of science; while Germany, once the
country of dreamers and theorists, had
now become entirely practical.
Counter-action began to be taken by
a few far-sighted men, particularly
by leaders of the Royal Society and
of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, and Sir
Oliver Lodge in 1891 in an address
urged the inauguration of a Physical
Observatory precisely comparable to
the Greenwich Observatory and aim-
ing at the very highest quantitative
work in all departments of physical
science . . . accuracy should be the
one great end.
With typical government indif-
ference nothing was done, and it was
not until later that, as the result of
a committee under Lord Rayleigh
was established in 1898, the govern-
ment provided £4OOO a year for five
years and £12,000 for buildings. In
comparison, the German Reichsanstalt
buildings and equipment cost £195,000
with an annual expenditure of £15,000,
and the American Bureau of Standards
had allotted £115,000 and an annual
grant of £19,000.
First Executive Appointed.
On May 4th, 1899, the first Execu-
tive Committee was appointed, includ-
ing Lord Lister, Lord Rayleigh, Sir
Arthur Rucker, Sir John Wolfe Barry,
Mr. A. Siemens, Sir William Roberts-
Austin, Sir George Beilby, Sir Oliver
Lodge, Sir Andrew Noble, Sir Arthur
Schuster, Sir J. J. Thomson and Sir
Edward Thorpe, and it would have
been hard to assemble a more dis-
tinguished group of scientists at any
time in our history.
It was laid down that the President
of the Royal Society, the Permanent
Secretary of the Board of Trade and
representatives of Kew Observatory
should always be members. Represen-
tatives of the Institutions of Civil En-
gineers, Mechanical Engineers, Elec-
trical Engineers, The Iron and Steel
Institute, The Society of Chemical
Industry and The Institution of Naval
Architects were also permanent ap-
pointees.
Mr. (later Sir Richard) Glazebrook
was appointed the first Director, and
on March 19th, 1902, the National
Physical Laboratory was formally open-
ed in Bushy House, near Hampton
Court, bv the future King George V
and Queen Mary, then the Prince and
Princess of Wales.
When it started in 1902 the staff
numbered 26 and Glazebrook had
close contact with everyone, but when
he retired it exceeded five hundred and
the work had expanded to be beyond
the surveillance of any one man.
The securing of equipment and
buildings to undertake the various in-
vestigations was severely hampered by
the inadequate grant, and a glance at
the early days of the N.P.L. will in-
spire great admiration for the small
handful of enthusiasts who overcame
the inertia of their time and forced
upon the community, with very little
to help them beyond their own vision,
an essential organ of modern material
civilisation.

People everywhere are appreciating the eye-soothing softness of
"Opalux”—its evenly-spread, glare-free lighting. The secret of
"Opalux” is the coating of silicate powder on the inside of the bulb.
By the astute application of this new process, "Opalux” has raised

Impact of War.
With the founding of the Ministry
of Munitions at the outbreak of
World War I, the Laboratory was call-
ed upon for important advisory and
administrative tasks and its Director
became scientific adviser on physical
questions to the Ministry. Apart from
its work in aerodynamics, the most im-
portant war work was probably that
done on gauges which, more than any
other one factor, made mass produc-
tion possible.
By the end of the War N.P.L.
had grown to occupy a national
position altogether greater than in
earlier years, and as a result financial
control was transferred to the recently-
formed Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research. The Royal
Society, however, continued its close
relationship with the scientific adminis-
tration of the Laboratory.
The aftermath of war also meant
that for the N.P.L. whole branches of
science had been added to its pro-
gramme X-rays, radioactivity, wire-
less, new advances in illumination and
electricity in general, building acoustics
and noise which resulted in the
building of new equipment and labora-
tories.
Sir Joseph Pentavel became Director
at the end of the war and carried on
till 1936. and it fell to the lot of Sir
Charles Darwin to be Director from
1938 to 1949 and to guide the Labora-
tory through the Second World War,
during which science, and therefore
the N.P.L. itself, became of paramount
importance to the Nation’s survival.
Sir Charles was succeeded by Dr. E.
C. Bullard, who took up his duties on
January Ist, 1950, exactly fifty years
after Glazebrook had assumed office as
the first Director of the N.P.L.
Annual expenditure has risen from
£204,507 in 1920 to £751,984 in 1950,
and it is also interesting to record that
income from industry and other
sources for testing and research over
the same period has risen from
£45,848 to £236,850.
The Maintenance of Standards.
The matters with which physical
science is concerned are capable of
clear definition only in so far as they
can be measured, and all measure-
ments are concerned with one or more
of the three fundamental quantities —
length, mass and time.
Length, mass and time are quantities
which can only be measured on the
assumption that there exists an ultimate
criterion which shall be universally ac-
cepted as a standard.
In the case of length, these standards
are the Imperial Standard Yard and
the International Prototype Metre: the
former is with the Board of Trade in
London and the latter with the Bureau
International des Poids et Mesures at
Sevres, near Paris.
Wave Length as Linear
Standard.
There are great difficulties in main-
taining the extreme accuracy necessary
for determining these basic standards,
and it was found in 1942 that the
standard bars of nickel had gradually
shortened during the past 52 years by
nearly two parts in a million. This
caused the physicists to believe that
the ideal standard could be found by
choosing light of a suitable wave-
length and of spectrometric charac-
teristics.
In 1927 the Seventh General Con-
ference of Weights and Measures ac-
cepted measurements in wave-lengths
as equivalent to measurements in
terms of the international metre, on
the provisional basis of one metre
equals 1.553 164 13 wave-lengths of
the red line of cadmium in dry air at
15 degrees Centigrade under a pres-
sure of 760 mm. of mercury. Later,
in 1933 the value of the metre was
determined by this method to be

(continued from previous page)
39.370138 inches, which differed from
the previous measurement by the
older method by less than 1 part in
4 millions.
From the primary linear standards,
both line and end, a large range of
secondary standards are constructed,
one of the most important being the
standard tapes used for testing the ac-
curacy of surveying tapes.
Electrical Standards.
To-day, N.P.L. is also the custodian
of the three British legal electrical stan-
dards representing the ampere, the
volt and the ohm. In 1936 measure-
ments were completed on at
the acceleration due to gravity “g”
which was found to be 981.183
cm/sec 2 or 32.1911 ft./sec 2 .
Research.
The selection of a subject for long-
term research may be due to any of a
number of reasons. In some instances
the research covers a wide field which
at the beginning of the Laboratory’s
history obviously needed a systematic
treatment. An example of this is the
nature of alloying in metallurgy.
Other long-term research began with
a specific problem hitherto not sub-
jected to scientific analysis, out of
which the need for a new type of
fundamental investigation was seen to
grow. Thus the problems of indus-
trial fatigue and street lighting accele-
rated the investigation of the human
eye as an optical instrument.
A third stimulus to long-term re-
search has been provided by new
scientific discoveries of practical ap-
plication radium, the aeroplane,
piezo-electricity.
All these forms of research have
one factor in common: they may con-
sume tbe work of years without the
certainty that this work will prove to
possess practical value.
It is certain, however, that the
nation that dispenses with long-term
research will be found unprepared
sooner or later to take advantage of
some new specific scientific oppor-
tunity. It is estimated that about fifty
per cent, of N.P.L. s annual budget
goes to long-term fundamental re-
search.
Safeguards for the Atomic
Age.
In 1912 Britain acquired a National
Radium Standard in the form of 21.1
milligrammes of radium chloride,
which was entrusted to N.P.L. and
which marked the beginning of the
Radiology Section. As a result of the
Radioactive Substances Act 1948 in
connection with which the Laboratory
was most active, it is probable that
radiation workers will be subjected to
continuous radiation monitoring tests
and to periodical medical and haemato-
logical examinations. The radiation
assessment is made by means of small
photographic films carried on the per-
son during working hours. The pre-
sent indication is that the dose re-
ceived by the total population is about
1% only of that received naturally
from cosmic rays, so that the present
risk of deleterious genetic effects is
negligible both to individuals and to
the race. However, in view of the
unpredictable expansion of the uses
and abuses of atomic energy, the tech-
nical experience being gained at the
Laboratory is of the utmost impor-
tance.
Screw Threads.
The Metrology Division, in co-
operation with the British Standards-
Institution, has carried out continuous
research on screw-threads ever since
the Laboratory was started, the em-
phasis in the earlier years being the
best means of measuring screws.
Events often move too rapidly for
scientific research, especially in its ap-
plied and industrial forms, and so
World War II broke before any suc-
cess had been achieved in tackling the
most important of all screw problems
—the establishment of an international
form of thread.
During two wars co-operation be-
tween Britain and the U.S.A. was
hampered by the fact that British
screws have a Whitworth thread angle
of 55 degrees, while American screws
have one of 60 degrees After Anglo-
American - Canadian conferences in
1945 and 1946, and the subsequent
publication of a specification for the
Unified Screw-thread by the British
Standards Institution, this special in-
vestigation reached a successful end.
The Future.
Judging from the first fifty years of
its history it will be one function of
the Laboratory to nurture branches of
applied science which are as yet un-
born. In 1901 there was no reason
to suppose that the aeroplane would
develop into a dominant factor in
everyday life. Though the mysterious
Hertzian waves intrigued physicists,
the future of radio was quite unsus-
pected. The thermionic valve was not
thought of; radium was a curiosity
only.
One of the clearest indications of
the future is provided by the number
of vigorous new scientific develop-
ments which are still in their infancy-
The fact that industry to-day has ac-
cepted the implications of science, and
many of the older forms of applied
science, is largely the fruit of the
N.P.L.’s work in past years. It should,
however, be remembered that much
that is now a commonplace of indus-
trial practice seemed remote from
general usefulness fifty years ago as
some of the new researches may seem
to-day.
It will require the same persistent
attention to the practical side of
mathematical and electronic techniques
to familiarise industry with their value,
as was needed in the past with matters
which are now very familiar. And the
National Physical Laboratory will con-
tinue, in the future as in the past, to
be the champion of accuracy in
measurement.
THE LOUVRE AGE.
The early catch-cry of the modern architect
of twenty-five years ago was walls of glass
to let a maximum of sunshine into the in-
terior. Today particularly in South America
and the semi-tropical areas of America and
the Carribean great ingenuity is being shown
in the introduction of continuous canopies
and vertical fins and moveable vertical louvres
to keep the unwanted sun and glare from the
interior. That the new development of
Brazilian origin is having a most striking af-
fect on current architectural design is instanc-
ed by these two examples, the upper a new
insurance building in New Orleans, and be-
low, a combined architects’ office and home
in Havana, Cuba.

Special Clothing For
Korean War
The British Army is supplying
specially designed winter clothing for
the troops fighting in the bitter cold
of Korea.
The new equipment, it is officially
stated, compares very favourably with
what American troops are using.
The basis of the new outfit is spec'
ial underwear, which includes the
string vests now generally accepted
for very cold conditions. On top of
this goes a shirt, a heavy jersey, and
a pair of trousers made of blanketing.
The next layer consists of a combat
smock coming down to the thighs
made of double gabardine, windproof
and water repellant, and trousers of
the same material. With it goes a
hood worn on top of a ski cap, and
above all goes a parka (see left and
centre illustrations) of gabardine,
which buttons between the legs and
rises into a cowl that projects well in
front of the face.
This cowl is stiffened round the
outside with piano wire, so that the
direction in which it gives protection
from the wind can be varied at will.
Displayed in the photo (right) are
mokluks, a high canvas boot for dry
cold conditions, and a boot with a
stout, deeply serrated rubber sole for
dry weather.
EXPRESSION IN MODERN
ARCHITECTURE.
Frederick Gibberd, in his opening
remarks when delivering an address
at the R.1.8.A. earlier this year, said:
“When I was sounded about giving
this lecture, a title was suggested to
me which I did not understand.
However, I gathered the title didn’t
matter much providing I talked about
modern architecture and about aes'
thetics. It was expected that there
would be young members here to'
night, because the prizes were being
announced; and there’s nothing
younger members like better than
criticising buildings. When you’re
older, other things begin to get im-
pirtant—like the scale of charges for
State'aided housing schemes.”

The Houses We Live In
INTERESTING LECTURE BY Mr. ROY GROUNDS.
Guest speaker at the N.S.W. Chap-
ter, R.A.1.A., August General Meet-
ing was Mr. Roy Grounds, of Mel-
bourne, who is well known in the
Profession, both as a practicing archi-
tect and as a lecturer at Melbourne
University.
This proved to be the most suc-
cessful and certainly the liveliest
meeting the Chapter has had for some
years, and not only did architects at-
tend in large numbers, but the build-
ing industry and the general public
were also well represented. This was
due largely to Mr. Grounds’ cunning-
ly conceived title, “The Houses We
Live In,” which had a piquant topi-
cality in view of the recent Sulman
award. [He freely admitted this was
a device “to get the people in”; and
it was certainly successful.}
Mr. Grounds sees housing as the
neglected child of Australian archi-
tecture. Architects, he said, must
agree that they had failed badly in
this field. There were many reasons
for this, notably that so much thought,
time, and money had been devoted
to other aspects of building.
The problem was made more diffi-
cult still by the overwhelming indi-
vidualism of Australian people, which
made them want individual houses
and to reject the idea of community
living as practised, for instance, by
the Danes, Swedes, and other Euro-
peans.
Emphasising his remarks with care-
fully chosen illustrations, Mr. Grounds
proceeded to show that a house is
something meant to be lived in and
not merely looked at, and that an ar-
chitect should not build a house simp-
ly for the purpose of illustrating an at-
titude or demonstrating his technique.

showed the Farnsworth House by Mies
van der Rohe (“the last modern
house”), Philip Tohnston’s glass house
at New Caanen and the equally well
known house by Sarrinen and Fames.
All these, he said, had five things
in common: all were designed by ar-
chitects of recognised ability, all rep-
resent individual solutions for individ-
uals living alone, all are infinitely and
immaculately beautiful, hopelessly ex-
pensive, and utterly useless. “These,”
said Mr. Grounds, “are houses we
look at. In the way of comfortable
living they offer nothing whatever.”
Students’ Designs.
Several plans by Melbourne stud-
ents were shown next. These were
carried out as part of an exercise to
“design a house of reasonable econ-
omy for a man, his wife, and two
children.” A notable feature of all
was the large space allotted for the
children’s accommodation and recrea-
tion, indicating a sensibly realistic
approach, since children are an im-
portant part of the “living” that goes
on in the house. The fact that these
designs aroused great public interest
when displayed in Melbourne would
suggest that such planning was in line
with the house building public’s trend
of thought and requirements.
Three Current Victorian Houses.
Three houses of unusual shapes cur-
rently being erected in Victoria were
used to make the next point. One
was triangular in plan, one circular,
and the third square shaped with a
circular central courtyard. All these
again were individual solutions for in-
dividual clients building on individual
sites. “They are,” declared Mr.
Grounds, “quite possible to live in,
but almost impossible to look at.” It
was significant, he said, that all were
built in more or less traditional ma-
terials, and that the further they broke
away from the traditional, the more
expensive they became.
A Warning to the Building Industry.
“Twenty-five years ago,” said Mr.
Grounds, “certain groups of architects
(as typified, for instance, by the Bau'
haus) made a clear statement of the
functional approach to house building.
The Farnsworth house represents this
approach carried to its irrational
limit.”
We saw in this, he continued, the
high promise of that theory reduced
to what was merely decorative form,
whose plain, clean lines were by some
mistakenly supposed in themselves to
imply and impart efficiency.
A building owner is much less inter'
ested in what his building looks like
than in whether it works well and par'
ticularly in whether it is economic. In
1951, 70% of house building in Vic'
toria was done by owners, without
builders and without architects. This
indicated as plainly as possible that
the building industry was pricing it'
self out of the market.
It had been shown that individual
designs carried out merely to demon-
strate an attitude or a philosophy be'
came more expensive and useless the
more closely they approached to that
objective. Architects should concern
trate rather on establishing a principle
that could be readily adopted by the
industry, home-owner, and materials
supplier alike.
This did not necessarily mean that
prefabrication was the answer to the
problem. Prefabrication in America
had not proved less costly than tra-
ditional building methods. The point
was that there must be the closest co-
operation between the architectural
profession, the building industry, and
the merchants.
Conclusion.
“The science of architecture,” said
Mr. Grounds in conclusion, “has by-
passed the house; and the art of ar-
chitecture has been running riot under
the guise of functionalism and the
mere appearance of efficiency. There
is too much of the “new aesthetic”
masquerading as logic and invention.
The architect is becoming a decorator
rather than a constructor. He must
realise that it is for him to provide
comfort and convenience at a price
people can pay. It is time to shake
ourselves out of the magnolia trees
and come down to earth on the econ-
omic and social level.”
Thanking the speaker for his ad-
dress the President, Mr. A. E. Stafford,
said that we are all agreed that Mr.
Grounds can design buildings; now
we know that he is equally adept at
designing a lecture. This has been a
most illuminating and careful study,
bringing home to us what a living

WELDED STEEL LIFTING TOWER.
This steel tower of welded portal frame
design, is used in “untanking” the nine
30.000 kVA transformers at the new
Bothell sub-station in Seattle, U.S.A. With
its hoisting mechanism it is seen assisting in
the movement of one of the nine transformers
into position. The station transforms four
230.000 volt transmission lines, from Skagit
Dam and power station, down to 115,000
volts. A connection with Bonneville Dam is
also a possibility.

thing architecture is. We have had
the facts impartially set before us and
we are left to draw our own conclu-
sions about the part we have to play
in housing Australians.
Professor H. Ingham Ashworth,
Dean of the Faculty of Architecture,
Sydney University, in his remarks said
Mr. Grounds is an educationalist who
is also a practitioner and who obvious-
ly has both feet firmly on the floor.
This is most heartening, and I am
grateful for the bit of gentle debunk-
ing he has done, as I feel this should
be especially beneficial to some of my
students, who show a tendency to
bring out their prayer rugs at the
mere mention of some of the Ameri-
can houses illustrated tonight.
It is difficult for us to say what we
should do in the matter of housing,
but it is clear that there is nothing to
be gained by adopting one philosophy
and saying: “This is the way!” Obvi-
ously, every approach must be exam-
ined and judged on its merits.”

plored and various take'off and land-

noise will be made on the site, and
in and around buildings nearby.
Florida Home Has
“Planned Economy”
The modified ranch'type house
which Mr. and Mrs. Harold Obst
planned to build in Florida, has many
ideas hitherto not used in home plan'
ning.
For the Obst couple are qualified ar'
chitects, and they seized the opportun-
ity to design a “planned'economy”
home.
Thus their home uses ceilings of
pressed wood and mineral fibre two
inches thick with acoustical and insul-
ating qualities. It thus serves as a
structural and finished product by elim-
inating the use of sheathing. It can
be painted any colour.
It also has exposed concrete block
walls that serve as inside as well as
the outside of the house, eliminating
the need for plaster, although some
plaster has been used in interior walls
for effect.
They have used with clever effect
two screen walls of corrugated asbestos
cement, one wall screening the car
port and the other providing a pri-
vate garden.
Divided Bath “Dual” Bathroom.
For planned economy two toilets,
one leading from the master bedroom
and one from the hall, give access to
the one bath which provides for this
family of four, which includes a very
young girl and a boy.
The dividing wall between kitchen
and living room houses a fireplace on
the living'room side and a range that
backs up to the brickwork. Along'
side of the range and at work height
is an oven built into the wall.
Floors throughout are of terrazzo,
which need less care than wood, and
are termite'proof though not as kind
to the feet.
Awning windows eliminate the need
for closing windows when raining, and
a flat roof, gravel-covered, reflects the
heat.
£4,000,000 Canberra
Offices
“White Elephant,*’ Says Minister.
The new block of Government
offices being built in Canberra is the
most expensive “white elephant” he
had ever seen, said the Minister for
the Interior, Mr. Kent Hughes, re'
cently, in the House of Representa'
tives.
It was being built on a cost'plus
contract at an estimated cost of
“somewhere about four million”, and
until quite recently nobody seemed
to have had any interest in getting
the building finished.
He was replying to a question from
Mr. Fraser (Lab., A.C.T.) who asked
whether instructions had been given
to the contractor. Concrete Con'
structions Ltd., that work was to be
limited to one of the three sections
of the building; this would mean
that 300 men would lose their fobs.
Mr. Kent Hughes said the object
of confining work to one section was
to get that and the rest of the build'
ing to a stage at which the Govern'
ment could call for tenders for the
completion of the building on a firm
price basis instead of cost'plus.

ida conditions. Floor plan features a con-

Builders’ Registration
Eagerly Awaited
The building industry is awaiting
with keen interest the pending regis'
tration of builders Act. Wherever
builders meet the Bill is the major
topic of conversation, for it will mark
the culmination of long vears of stren'
uous fighting by a succession of far'
sighted industry leaders.
Like Father, Like Son.
The question of builders’ registra'
tion was first introduced in 1910, by
the late Mr. H. J. Thompson, who
was then president of the M.B.A. of
N.S.W.
It is a remarkable coincidence that
registration will become an accorm
plished fact during the term of office
of his son, Mr. Charles E. Thompson,
who is now M.B.A. president for his
second term.
The Thompson family, three gener'
ations of them, have contributed much
to the progress of N.S.W. since Mr.
H. I. Thompson founded the firm
in 1885.
As the vears passed, the organisa'
tion expanded, and a son, the late Mr.
H. W. Thompson, became a partner,
the firm being known as H. W.
Thompson Pty. Ltd.
Mr. Charles E. Thompson became
managing director in 1946, and he has
for many years been active in the
building world.
Like his father and his brother, Mr.
Thompson has devoted his activities
to the advancement of the construe'
tion industry, and like his father, he
has been a staunch and forthright ad'
vocate of registration for competent
builders.
The result of his efforts can be
seen in the legislation now pending
in the State Parliament.
New Brick.
A firm believer in the progress of
building and the need for new and
adaptable materials to speed up con'
struction, Mr. Thompson recently
helped two of his leading employees
to perfect a radically'different general
purpose bullnose brick. This is now
in production at the State Brick'
works, and he told “Construction”
last week that many other brickworks
are showing a great interest in it.
He said that there are no strings
attached to its manufacture; no roy'
alties or patent rights to pay, and
that nobody wanted to get rich out of
“It was evolved to meet the re'
quirements of the building industry,
and I am only concerned with the pro'
gress of builders.
“I would like to see many brick'
yards making this brick, to the ulti'
mate benefit of the industries,” Mr.
Thompson added.
The third generation of the
Thompson family, in the person of
Mr. F. H. C. Thompson, is now rep'
resented in the firm, thus rounding off
a proud record of 67 years of build'
ing activity in N.S.W.
Brisbane Shows the
Way
New £200,000 Hotel Block.
A new 11'Storied block is to be
added in Ann Street to the Hotel Can'
berra, Brisbane, the temperance ho'
tel, at a cost of £200,000.
The architects are Job, Collin and
Fulton.
Bathroom to all Bedrooms.
The new fireproof building will be
the same height as the present struc'
ture. It will accommodate 200
guests. Every bedroom would have
its own private bathroom and toilet.
The Canberra when completed will
be a good deal larger than any licens'
ed hotel in Australia for the present
hotel has a capacity of 500.
Another 50 bedrooms will be added
to The Hotel Canberra at Toowoom'
ba.

Building Progress Around Australia
NEW CITY BUILDINGS AND HOTELS.
Overseas Investments in Australia.
Britain and the United States had
invested £95,000,000 in Australia since
last year, said the Minister for Devel-
opment (Senator Spooner) in a re-
cent statement.
“I predict more to come,” he con-
tinued. “There is no lack of confi-
dence in Australia’s future.”
Overseas manufacturers had put a
greater volume of capital into Austra-
lia in 1951-52 than in any other year
[and everyone will forget to say
“thanks” to Mr. Menzies for stabilis-
ing the country’s finances].
Britain’s total planning involved
£48,000,000 and American projects
more than £45,000,000.
QUEENSLAND.
That building is booming in
Queensland is very evident from the
major projects that are being announc-
ed following the recent lifting of
building restrictions.
Another item of major interest is
the news that a fifty-year-old dream
is to be realised by the erection of a
new Post Office for Brisbane.
In 1900 Brisbane people had three
major ambitions: a new City Hall,
a new bridge over the river, and a
new Post Office. Objective number
one was realised in 1930; number two
in 1932 and 1940 with the Grey St.
and Storey Bridges, and now it looks
as if the third and final ambition is
on the way.
The present G.P.O. was opened in
1872 and cost £BOOO, the city at that
time having a population of 20,000
(and the whole State 120,000).
The new Post Office is estimated to
cost £ 1,000,000.
Telephone service expansion plans
in Queensland totalling £292,000 be-
ing undertaken by the Commonwealth
Department of Works, include a
three-storeyed automatic telephone ex-
change at Woolloongabba to accom-
modate 9600 lines; contractor is C.
P. Hornick.
Hotels Have to Rebuild.
Hotel improvements to cost millions
are being ordered by the Queensland
State Licensing Commission and first
notices are going out to owners of
temporary bars. This move follows
the removal of building restric-
tions, for during the ten years
that these have been in force thirty
hotels have either been destroyed by
fire or demolished by order, and the
owners allowed to carry on with tern'
porary premises.
The Attorney General, Mr. Power,
said the commission had the task of
making Queensland hotels generally
more attractive externally and intern-
ally.
It would consider both tourist re-
quirements and the need for addi-
tional accommodation in country
centres.
Where owners did not meet the
rebuilding orders, the commission
might have to remove licences to
new sites.
A 15-bedroom hotel was the Com-
mission’s minimum requirement and
present-day estimates of hotel con-
struction in first-class materials ranged
from <£lBoo to £2200 a bedroom.
On this basis, the building of all
hotels now operating with temporary
bars would cost about <£l million.

New Toowoomba Hospital.
Special trains were run from Bris'
bane for the opening of the new
St. Vincents Maternity Hospital at
Toowoomba, by the Roman Catholic
Bishop of Toowoomba, Dr. Roper.
The hospital, which is conducted
by the Sisters of Charity, is three
storeys, contains 51 beds, and cost
£200,000. Six thousand people at'
tended the opening ceremony and
£3500 was collected towards the cost
of the building.
£250,000 Spent on Ipswich Hospital.
New buildings provided by the
State Government at the Ipswich Hos'
pital had cost in excess of £250,000,
said the Health Minister, Mr. Moore,
in response to criticisms of the hosph
tal by Sir Earle Page, Federal Health
Minister.
The new maternity hospital, mod'
ern nurses’ quarters, and laundry ad'
ditions had been built and boiler
plant and machinery provided.
Work was now in progress on a
new block for administration, out'pa'
tient departments, dental clinic, and
impatient accommodation.
A programme of new buildings in'
eluded new staff quarters for which
plans were complete.
£5,000,000 for Sugar Bulk Handling.
It is proposed to provide bulk'ham
dling facilities for sugar in Queens'
land at an estimated cost of £5,000,'
000; projected locations are Mackay,
Lucinda Point, and Cairns. The
Agriculture Minister, Mr. Collins, said
that the bulk handling of sugar would
involve setting up a new commission
at Lucinda Point.
£600,000 Bridge Opened.
The Premier of Queensland, Mr.
Gair, last week opened the new
£600,000 bridge over the Fitzroy
River at Rockhampton. It is 1219
feet long with a width of 42 ft. plus
a 5 ft. footway on both sides. It re'
places the old bridge that was built
in 1881.
The Premier also opened the new
power house constructed at a cost of
£2,500,000. It will have an immedi'
ate capacity of 22,500 kW., while a
further 15,000 kW. plant was on
order.
New Taxation Building.
Major projects announced which in'
elude a 14'Storey building to be
erected at the corner of Adelaide
and Wharf Streets, Brisbane, at an
estimated cost of £1,687,000 is under
discussion between State and Federal
construction authorities. The Com'
monwealth Parliament’s Standing Com'
mittee on Public Works has been ask'
ed to advise the Government on the
erection of the building.
Plans prepared by the State Works
Department provided for 150,000 sq.
ft. of office space, 24,150 sq. ft. of
storage space and provision for park'
ing 150 cars in the basement.
Wharf Street frontage is 210 ft.
and Adelaide Street 135 ft.
Provision for protection against
atomic bomb attack will be included
in the structural design.
SYDNEY.
Important new building projects
have been announced or commenced
in Sydney.
Mr. W. G. Robson, Managing DL
rector of Otis Elevator Co. Pty. Ltd.,
has stated that his company will call
tenders later this year for new prem'
ises to be erected at Bankstown at a
cost of £250,000.
Work has commenced on a new six'
storey building at the corner of Miller
and Blue Streets, North Sydney, for
the A.M.P. Society that will provide
87,000 sq. ft. of floor space. Con'
crete Constructions Pty. Ltd. are the
builders.
Nuffield (Australia) Pty. Ltd. plan
to spend £500,000 on extensions to
its plant at Victoria Park Race-
course to provide an additional 180,000
sq. ft. of floor space.
Hastings Deering Pty. Ltd. have
also stated that a start will soon be
made on a new factory with an area
of 100,000 sq. ft. at Homebush at a
cost of £130,000.
In the retail trade, Grace Bros. Pty.
Ltd. are proposing to entirely remodel
its Bondi store, while G. J. Coles &
Co. Ltd. are planning to spend
£1,000,000 in capital development
within the next three years. The
N.S.W. programme includes new
stores at Manly, Casino and Cronulla,
and the modernisation of the Pitt St.
and Liverpool St. stores.
City building projects include Mor-
ley House, at present under way in
Elizabeth Street, costing £250,000,
and the proposed building to be erect'
ed by the N.S.W. Bar Association in
Phillip Street. The Salvation Army
are also planning to build a new wo'
men’s hostel in Elizabeth Street, near
Central Station, on the site of the
existing hostel.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
New Factory Opened.
The Attorney'General, Mr. Abbott,
opened the new factory of Bramac
Ltd., Kenilworth, which has been
erected at a cost of £25,000 for the
production of waterproof garments of
all types.
A steel frame building with a brick
office block, the new unit was erected
in nine months; it will employ 70
and in addition to supplying large re'
quirements, will develop export mark'
ets.
New Brick Kilns.
The first section of the new State
pressed brickworks at Armadale, W.A.,
is to be officially opened by the Prem'
ier, Mr. McLarty, on October 17
next.
The plant, which is considered to
be the most modern in the Southern
Hemisphere, when completed will
have an output of 380,000 bricks a
week, making a total of 500,000 with
the production from the adjacent wire'
cut works.
The new works were designed by
the Public Works Department.
Proposed New Broadcasting
Buildings.
Speaking at a reception recently
tendered to visiting members of the
Australian Broadcasting Commission,
by the Lord Mayor, Mr. J. Totter'
dell. Commission Chairman R. J. F.
Boyer, expressed the hope that the
A.B.C. in Perth would soon have a
permanent home. New buildings
were one reason that he and Mr. E.
R. Dawes and Sir John Medley were
in Perth. Mr. Totterdell said that it
was hoped that next year Perth would
have an orchestral shell which would
be available for A.B.C. use; a site
had been selected and plans and sped'
fications were being prepared.
New Churches.
The Anglican Archbishop of Perth,
Dr. Moline, is launching an appeal
to raise £lOO,OOO for new churches.
He emphasised, however, that it
was a spiritual enterprise, for as much
as the Church needed the money he
was looking for far greater results
from the campaign than anything
that could be measured in pounds,
shillings and pence.
Guildford Grammar School, Perth,
has been sold by the Anglican Dio'
cesan Council to Guildford C.O.E.
Grammar School Inc. for £40,000, in'
eluding five acres behind the chapel
upon which it is planned to build a
science block.
Houses Cheaper at Boulder.
Wood and asbestos houses were be'
ing built on the Goldfields more
cheaply than they were in the metro'
politan area of Perth, according to
Mr. Moir, speaking in the Legislative
Assembly.
These homes were being erected
by mining companies in Boulder for
£650, but in Perth similar houses
were priced at £l,OOO or £2,000, said
Mr. Moir.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
New Bottling Plant Opened.
The large new plant erected by
Austral Bottling Ltd. for the produc'
tion of Coca'Cola on the Port Road,
Adelaide, and one of the most modern
in the Southern Hemisphere, was
opened last week by the Premier, Mr.
Flats and Office to be Permitted.

Railway Freight and Plaster Supplies.
Speaking last week. Mr. Stewart
Fraser, Executive Director of the
Building Industry Congress of N.S.W..
issued a warning that N.S.W. plaster
millers might be forced to transfer
their complete activities to Stenhouse
Bay in South Australia unless the
N.S.W. State Government took action
to reduce the existing excessive rail-
way freight rates on gypsum which
had already made it economically im-
possible for the plaster industry to
draw their supplies from leases in
N.S.W.
There were no major mining or
production problems in S.A., and
shipping companies were able to offer
a continuity of space for the ship-
ment of gypsum to N.S.W.
It was possible to ship, land and
transport gypsum from S.A. to the
millyard at Camellia, near Sydney,
for £2/1/0 a ton less than freighting
gypsum from Conoble-Ivanhoe in
N.S.W.
—One for Mr. Winsor to solve!
400 Kitchenettes for Hostel.
The S.A. Government was prepar-
ed to authorise the Housing Trust to
construct 400 kitchenettes at the
Gepps Cross migrant centre provid-
ing the cost was reimbursed by the
Commonwealth, said the Premier, Mr.
Playford.
“Experience with our own emer-
gency houses,” he said, “has empha-
sised the desirability of having families
living under the more natural condi-
tions of home life.”
Estimated cost would be about £2OO
per unit.
NORTHERN TERRITORY.
The Queensland Government has
announced its support of the pro-
posal to construct a “Beef Railway”
running from Queensland into the
Northern Territory and Queensland
Federal Members—Liberal, Labour
and Country Party—all of whom are

GLASS DORMITORY.
The model of a new dormitory for the Kiskiminetas Springs School at Saltsburg, U.S.A., reveals
it to look rather like a super-aviary on stilts. The stark walls are of glass, the frame of steel,
the floors of radiant heated concrete. It docs not look like a college building to Australian
eyes. Also the present-day desire of eliminating a ground floor with all its conveniences of
direct access is very hard to understand except in tropical climates when it has the practical
value of allowing air to circulate all around the building.

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT INFLUENCE.
The heavy horizontal eaves that is such a
dominant feature of the design of the houses
depicted in the two lower views would seem
to indicate that the influence of Frank Lloyd
Wright is still strong for this was a feature
that he employed extensively in his earlier
work. The sturdy brick unbroken walling in
the centre illustration was also a favourite,
though far from beautiful, treatment of Frank
Lloyd Wright. A series of large glass panels,
some opening, some fixed, constitute the whole
of the walls in the bottom examples. The
top picture features some very simple Amer-
ican furniture, the drawers having a continual
chromium rod that serves both pull and dec-
oration.

THEY ARE ALL HOUSES.
One could perhaps be pardoned, looking at the two bottom designs, if one thought that they were two entirely
different structures; yet they are, in fact, both houses, one in the traditional manner and the other a product of
what, for want of a better term we call the “Modern” style. Just why the upper storey providing larger floors has
to bulge over the lower is hard to say, when there is plenty of ground area, likewise the running of the weather-
boarding in opposite ways in the two storeys seems to have no purpose but to induce restlessness; perhaps that is
to be in keeping with the times. The two upper examples have as their prototype the English Cotswold cottage
(left) and the Spanish hacienda (right).

SPACIOUS TERRACES.
All these designs have one factor in common—that of a spacious terrace to take advantage of the sun or view, or
both. Top left, which occupies a steep site, has achieved the terrace only by constructing it in reinforced concrete
partly cantilevered and partly supported on massive piers. Bottom left is built up solid, top right is incorporated
by setting back the upper storey over the garage in the basement, while bottom right, which has a flat site, lends
itself to terrace running the full length of the lounge on the North East side.

transport many years later, leading
into the interior of the newly-opened
district over the Blue Mountains.
This is the well-known horse-drawn
' stage coach period which served for
J many years in carrying passengers,
f mail and goods to the early settlers.
The First Railway.
The progressive section of the pop-
ulation, however, decided that the
time had come to follow the example
jof the rest of the world where the
new mode of transport by steam was
opening up new lands and developin'
! he means of communication into tPi
older countries so that in 1850 a great
ceremony took place in the Cleveland
paddocks at Redfern by the turning of
the first sod for the construction of
a railway by the daughter of the
Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy. The
work of constructing the first section
was then started, but interruptions in
its progress took place due to the fact
that most of the labour so engaged
left their work to follow the gold rush
which had just started. However, in
spite of all these difficulties the first
section of the railway was opened
and the first train from Sydney to
Granville ran in 1855.
From then on the mileage of rail-
road grew apace with the passing of
time and with the growing popula-
tion and the development of the in-
terior of the country.
The needs of the people required
constant vigilance, not only for the
expansion of the hinterland, but the
needs of the population of the metro-
politan area had to be provided for
and speedy transport became impera-
tive, and not only the immediate
needs but the needs of the distant
future had to be taken into consider-
ation, hence in 1927 the new under-
ground railway in Sydney was put
into operation, and with the opening
of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, pro-
vided speedy transport within the
Sydney Metropolitan area.
The tableau depicts an underground
station as is at present operating in
the Sydney area.
Other panels show the railways
serving sea and transport and industry
and also the general advancement with
the proposed electrification of as much
of the system as possible by including
the Wangi Powerhouse in Lake Mac-
quarie District for the electrification
of railways which is now under con-
struction. The last of these tableaus
takes up most of the western end wall
and presents almost as a triumphant
note the one hundred years of railway
progress from the turning of the first
sod in the Cleveland paddock to the
crossing of the Hawkesbury River
Bridge by the Newcastle Flyer (an
engine and train equal to anything in
any part of the world) crossing over
an engineering feat of which Austra-
lia can justly be proud.

The University of
California
The World’s Largest.
43,600 Students.
The University of California is the
largest university in the world with
a total number of 43,600 full-time
students. These are distributed
among the following eight campuses
(or University establishments) which
are scattered throughout California.
In the north are the Berkeley cam'
pus (the mother campus), the College
of Agriculture at Davis, the fine arts,
law and medical schools at San Fran'
cisco and the Lick Observatory at
Mt. Hamilton. Further south are the
college at the beautiful coastal town
of Santa Barbara, the citrus experi-
mental station at Riverside and the
Scripps Institution of Oceanographv
at La folia (near San Diego).
Among the courses offered at the
Los Angeles campus near Hollwood,
is that of Theatre Arts, where movie
technique is taught by a former pro-
ducer of RKO, Fox and Paramount
films.
1000 Student Classes.
The size of U.C. (University of
California) necessarily means a mass
approach to education where under-
grad. classes may have as many as
1,000 students. This, of course, re-
sults in lack of direct guidance and a
ment is fabulous and educational op-
portunities are boundless.
U.C. is a State University, and by
the student and teacher. The respon-
sibility is thrown on to the student
himself. On the other hand, and
especially important for graduate stud-
ents, is the fact that the University
can afford the best teachers, equip-
minimum of personal contact between
law must admit, free, any Californian
who can qualify with a high school B
average. Any foreigners, by law,
must maintain a B average (equivalent
to 2nd or 3rd class honours), or for-
feit his student visa and return to his
own country. However, by maintain-
ing an A average, the foreigner, also
receives his education free. Students,
therefore come from all countries of
the world and are of every colour,
rich and poor. The coloured shoe-
shine boy, working his way through
College, may sit next in class to the
executive’s son who drive “to school”
each day in his own convertible Cad-
illac. It follows, that there are many
types of residential quarters offered
to the student who must, or desires to.

from the most exclusive fraternities
(for boys) and sororities (for girl,
to the “Co-op.” Houses —hostels
where the students do their own house'
work, cook their own food and in
return pay a minimum to cover the
cost of room and board.
Many of the present'day students
are war veterans (Returned Service-
men) and where married, both hus-
band and wife may accompany ea n
other to “school” every day, or the
wife may work to help “put her hus-
band through College.”
The University year is divided into
two semesters (terms) —Spring anc
Fall, with a Summer School from
June to September.
8 O’clock Lectures.
Lectures at hourly intervals begin
at 8 o’clock in the morning and run
continuously throughout the day, with
no official break for lunch. The
greatest advantage to graduate stud-
ents, apart from the equipment avail-
able and first-class instruction, is the
chance of meeting and listening to
visiting lecturers, each one a top man
in his or her field of science law,
economics or what-have-you. Semin-
ars, or discussion groups of graduate
students under professional guidance,
are stimulating and extremely bene-
ficial.
If the University of California is a
fair example of American education
today, and if the American youth
avail themselves fully of the oppor-
tunities presented to them, then it
augurs well for the future of the Unit-
ed States and for the search for Truth
generally throughout the world.

A LITTLE LEVITY.
A country vicar, driving into the
nearest town on market day, overtook
a girl whom he recognised as being
the maid in the house of one of his
parishioners. He stopped his car and
offered her a lift.
When they reached their destina-
tion the girl was most profuse in her
thanks.
“Don’t mention it,” said the vicar.
“Oh, all right: if you’d rather
not,” said the girl promptly. “People
do talk so, don’t they.”

ODOURLESS PAINTS
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER.
By Dr. W. SCHWEISHEIMER,
One trouble with painting is the
smell the paint gives off as it dries.
Manufacturers have worked for
years on that problem. Some of
them add deodorants or perfumes to
mask the smell. Another idea is to
eliminate odour by developing non'
odourous components for the paint.
Who Wants Odourless
Paints?
Freedom from unpleasant fumes of
ordinary paint has already led to wide'
spread acceptance of odourless paints
by householders, hospital and store
owners. Advantage of the new odour'
less paints are that painting can be
done on a year'round basis which is
important for hospitals; windows
needn’t be onened. There is no dis'
comfort for people like invalids in
old'age homes and hospitals who must
remain in the room being repainted.
Hotels, hospitals, theatres have less
“down'time.”
Householders are happy if fumes
from the paint job will not linger in
the home for weeks. Store owners can
paint without fear that products in
open storage or in opemtop freezers
will have a taste of linseed oil, paint
and turpentine.
Sales figures on odourless paints are
not available, and it is hard to predict
how common their use will be. Ac'
cording to a survey in “Chemical
Week,” at least two firms are offering
complete lines—flats, semi'glosses, and
glosses—of odourless paints; two coni'
panics plan to start manufacture of the
odourless solvents, and one firm is
now marketing an odourffree vehicle.
Odourless vehicles enable the for'
mulator who has not developed
necessary techniques for cooking his
filmTormers or who cannot get odour'
less solvents which are in tight sup'
ply to get in the new field. To
produce an odourless paint, formula'
tors must dispose of both the solvent
and the filmTormer (often linseed or
soya oil) odour.
Some new solvents have been found
that don’t have the objectionable
smell. During the last war, we see in
Chemical Week, isoparaffinnics in the
Cl I'Cl4 range were found to have
odourless properties. No trace of
naphthalenic or benzenic odours could
be noted in these compounds. Flat
paints, with high pigment content in
relation to the vehicle content, were
the first to be offered as odourless.
Semi'glosses, with more vehicle and
less pigment, were developed a short
time later. Odourless enamels, which
have an even smaller percentage of
New York.
pigment, are still in the research stage
for many companies. Some that are
on the market might better be term'
ed free from “paint type odours”
rather than odourless.
Sensitive to Odours.
There are people who are highly
sensitive to the volatile substances in
paints. Paint consists essentially of a
suspension of a pigment in a drying
oil. To this are added compounds of
lead, manganese, or cobalt to accele'
rate the drying, and turpentine or tur'
pentine substitutes to thin the paint
and make its application easier.
Thinners are volatile substances
which are added to paints to permit
easier application as well as to hold
in solution the oils and resins which
the paint contains. After the paint is
applied, the volatile solvents evaporate
and leave only the solid constituents
of the paint.
The evaporation is inhaled by
people in the room with the air. That
is the reason why we avoid sleeping
in a freshly'painted room until the
paint has dried. Many of the volatile
solvents are irritating to the respiratory
organs, they may produce cough and
asthma. The odour of paints is web
come to some people, but most people
do not like it and avoid rooms which
have just been painted.
Painters themselves are nt excluded

from sensitivity to odour and certain
parts of the paint. It is characteristic
for some forms of “painter’s asthma”
that a short stay in the paint shop,
even an exposure of a few minutes,
produces severe and long'lasting at'
tacks of sneezing and a running nose,
while the typical asthma attack occurs
later by night.
Painter’s asthma is produced by a
body' foreign protein, contained in
paint or varnish, to which the body is
sensitive. Odourless paints, therefore,
could cause such asthma attacks as
well, but the initial irritation is de'
cidedly smaller.
Mostly, the foreign protein is being
inhaled in the form of fumes or dust;
it irritates the bronchi by direct con'
tact. After the paint has dried on the
surface—after the fumes have ceased
to emanate from the fresh paint—
there is no danger of irritation to the
inmates of the room or to the painter,
except in rare cases.
Odours in Manufacturing
Paints.
Paints and varnish plants may dis'
charge irritating substances such as
acrolein, other aldehydes, and fatty
acids from their processes —all of them
with a most unpleasant odour. Many
plants use wet scrubbers to reduce
odours. Vapours which are driven off
in varnish or oil'boiling kettles are re'
moved by an aspiration system which
discharges into the water stream.
L. C. McCabe has stated that in'
cineration of paint and varnish cooker
discharge is the surest and most
efficient method of reducing the offen-
sive odours which they produce. In'
cineration is usually more expensive
than scrubbing, but complete combus'
tion will convert the most objection'
able odours into carbon dioxide and
water.
Paints Against Odour.
Paints have another connection
with odours as well: they destroy bad
odours. Some paints, particularly
odourless paints, are well-suited to
banish unpleasant odour of a room
and in this way will render it habitable
for sensitive people.
Such odour develops by the effects
of mould on the walls and ceilings,
especially in damp, dark rooms. Mould
odour is irritating to the mucous mem-
branes of nose, throat, windpipe and
bronchi, and may even produce an
attack of asthma.
All these respiratory troubles and
discomforts will disappear as though
by magio as soon as the room has been
freshly painted.
Perfumed Paint.
Though odourless paint is the covet'
ed goal in the paint industry to-day,
there may be opportunities for using
odour in paint—perfumed paint. A
perfumed lacquer has been constructed
which may be used on any unpainted
wooden surface.
It is easy to apply. The perfume'
painter takes an ordinary paint brush
and paints a strip about an inch wide
around the inside edges of the desk
drawers, for instance. Its long-lasting
fragrance will permeate everything
contained in those drawers.
Another method is to use it in linen
closets. The perfumed lacquer will
be used underneath the shelves so
that sheets, towels, pillow cases and
handkerchiefs will always be faintly
perfumed in the scent desired. It can
be used also underneath hat and shoe
shelves or beneath the window sills.
Such lacquer dries in half an hour
and will not chip. If the owner of
the room wants to change to another
fragrance, all he or she has to do is
to wash the old perfumed lacquer with
soap and water. After airing and dry'
ing, a new scent is then applied.
Several fragrances are used in these
ready'made perfumed lacquers.
OUR COVER
Before World War 11. architects with
imagination were designing strikingly
modern, completely functional blocks
of flats in Australia, and especially in
Sydney. (Top) “Franconia” Flats, Ma-
cleay Street, Darlinghurst, is a splendid
example of co-operation between private
enterprise, architects, and builders,
which is so sadly lacking today.
(Bottom) This main entrance to Ken-
dal Lodge apartments, Eastbourne
Avenue, Double Bay, is a further
example of the Apartment Architecture
which was becoming widely recog-
nised in Australia before the war.
2.000,000 POPULATION FOR
SYDNEY NEXT YEAR.
216,000 Increase Since 1947.
The latest figures just made avail'
able by the State Statistician record
striking increases in population in the
County of Cumberland and show that
on December 31st, 1951, the popula'
tion of the County was 1,918,000,
which is an increase of some 216,000
since the census in June, 1947. New
South Wales population has risen from
2,984,838 to 3,358,760; that of Aus-
tralia has risen from 7,679,358 to
8.538,736.
There is little doubt that the popu'
lation of the County of Cumberland
will reach two million next year. This
represents 57% of the population of
the State, a percentage that is virtually
unchanged since 1945, so that the
population of the metropolis is grow*
ing in exactly the same proportion as
that of the State. While there is satis-
faction in the rapid growth of Aus-
tralia s population, there are grounds
for deep concern in its distribution,
for in N.S.W. no less than two-thirds
of the great increase in population has
been absorbed by the great industrial
and commercial centres of Sydney,
Newcastle and Wollongong, and the
country districts have not benefited as
was hoped and is so necessary.
Two nursemaids were wheeling
their infant charges when one asked
the other, “Are you going to the
dance tomorrow night?”
“I’m afraid not.”
“What!” exclaimed the other. “And
you so fond of dancing!”
“I d love to go,” explained the
conscientious maid, “but to tell you
the truth, I am afraid to leave the
baby with its mother.”

£7,200,000 Pipeline Brings
Water 42 Miles.
Work is being pressed forward on
the new pipeline to bring water from
Mannum on the River Murray to
augment the seriously overtaxed Ade'
laide water supply.
The 4ft. lOin. diameter pipeline,
when completed, will bring Adelaide
more than 11,000 million gallons of
Murray water a year. This is only
about 2,000 million gallons less than
both Adelaide’s present annual con'
sumption and its present total reset'
voir capacity (allowing for evaporation
loss).
300 on Job.
Altogether, about 300 men are em'
ployed on the pipeline job, which has
already cost more than £2,000,000.
Much of the preparatory work at
Mannum for erection of the river in'
take and the adjoining No. 1 pump'
ing station has been completed.
When a coffer dam already built in
the river at Mannum is pumped dry,
chambers to screen debris from the
pipelines intake will be built.
BRAZIL FORGES AHEAD.
Brazil of recent years has become ah import-

there been a great volume of building work
executed but the designs are new and unusual,
a feature being the placing of the buildings on

sun-deflectors of various types that play a
dominant part in the elevational treatment.

Prevention and Treatment of Borers and
Termite
PREVENTION IN NEW HOMES.
By P. HADLINGTON.
Are you thinking of building a new
home? Have you a new home in the
process of erection, or have you only
recently completed your home? If
you can answer yes to any of these
queries, you will be interested in some
aspects of this article.
Lyctus, the Powder Post Beetle, is
often encountered in hardwood frame'
works, sometimes in the flooring,
joinery or mouldings, of a new home.
But please remember that this pest
attacks only the sapwood of certain
timber species. Remember, too, that
legislation has been introduced to
make the use of such sapwood illegal
in some circumstances. (The Timber
Marketing Act has been in force in
New South Wales since April, 1946.)
This article will also refer to Ano'
bium, the Furniture Beetle, which nor-
mally confines its attacks to timber
which has been in service for not less
:han fifteen years. Australian hard'
woods can be considered immune to
those attacks; hence, it is a sheer
waste of time and materials to carry
out treatment intended to prevent at'
tack in such timber by this insect.
It should be remembered that, ah
though prevention of borer attack is
better than cure, there are many so'
called preventative treatments which
have not the slightest value. Don’t
be stampeded into carrying out treat'
ment which may be both costly and
unwarranted.
1. BORER PREVENTION.
(a) Hardwood Frame Works.
The use of timber species immune
to attack by Lyctus would appear to
be an obvious solution to this prob'
lem. However, such a course, apart
from severely limiting choice, would
unjustly condemn the majority of our
most famous building timbers.
It was stated earlier that Lyctus at'
tacks are confined to sapwood. Tim'
ber of any species cut free from sap'
wood is therefore immune. In a
number of hardwood timbers, the sap'
wood, being distinctly lighter in colour
than the true'wood, is easily detected.
There is little or no colour variation
between sapwood and truewood in
other species, however, and the prob'
lem of separation is not quite so
simple.
Sapwood containing starch (gener*
ally speaking, this means sapwood sus'
ceptible to Lyctus attack) may be de'
tected by the use of a testing solution
made up by dissolving half an ounce
of potassium iodide crystals in about
one'fifth of a cupful of water; a
quarter of an ounce of iodine crystals
is added, with constant stirring, until
all are dissolved, and the solution is
then made up to one quart with clean
water. When applied to wood con'
taining starch, a greenish to dark blue-
black reaction will be seen within two
or three minutes. If the test is carried
out on the end of a log or plank, a
positive reaction may be greatly exag'
gerated, but will still give a reliable
indication of susceptibility.
The alternative to removal of sus'
ceptible sapwood is its preservative
treatment by an approved process to
render it immune to attack by Lyctus,
but, so far as hardwood framing tinv
bers are concerned, such immunisation
is neither practicable nor necessary.
Further, it would be an unsound econ-
omic proposition in view of the rela'
tively small amount of sapwood, norm'
ally present in hardwoods. This does
not apply, of course, in the case of
tiling and ceiling battens, which, more
often than not, are cut from sapwood
edgings.
It is important to keep in mind the
vast difference between the terms “ap'
proved preservative treatment" (im'
munisation) and surface chemical
treatment. An “approved preservative
treatment" has been approved and
registered by the N.S.W. Forestry
Commission in accordance with the
Regulations to the Timber Marketing
Act, and the method of treatment is
such as to guarantee that a sufficient
concentration of approved preserva'
tive will have penetrated to the core
of every treated piece of timber to
ensure Lyctus immunity. Thus, the
exposure of new surfaces during man'
ufacturing operations, etc., will present
no fresh danger of infestation. Ap'
provals of such preservative treatments
are granted to companies or individ'
uals only on condition that all material
treated will comply with this require'
ment. Borax and Boric (boracic) acid
are the preservatives most frequently
approved.
Surface chemical treatment, on the
other hand, is not recommended as a
method of preventing Lyctus attack.
To be effective, the preservative or
chemical used must completely seal
88
September 24, 1952.
BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


the timber before Lyctus attack has
commenced. Otherwise, a surface
treatment will be merely a film of
chemical through which borers may
emerge. Creosote or pentachlor'
phenol, to name two common sub'
stances, are equally impotent where
complete penetration is not achieved.
(b) Joinery Timbers, Flooring, etc.
The position in regard to manufac'
tured articles, such as flooring, mould'
ings, or various forms of joinery, is
affected by the terms of the Timber
Marketing Act, which prohibit the use
of Lyctus susceptible timber in the
manufacture of articles for sale. Man-
ufacturers are therefore offered the ah
ternatives of selecting immune species,
using immunised timber or removing
starch'bearing sapwood from suscept'
ible species.

“The rung of a ladder was never
meant to rest upon, but only to hold
a man’s foot long enough to enable
him to put the other somewhere high'
er.”—Thomas Huxley.
“RISK CAPITAL” IN SUB ZERO
SEARCH FOR OIL.
A little group of oilmen has been
perched during the past American
winter on a snow'covered mountain
9,000 feet above sea level, in Western
Wyoming, and the wildcat oil well
they are drilling is in a section where
the mercury sometimes needs a step'
ladder to reach zero.
After the General Petroleum Cor'
poration—an affiliate of the Vacuum
Oil Company Pty. Ltd. —discovered oil
at Tip Top last Spring, its geologists
took another look at their hole card
and decided the next well should be
drilled eight miles north'west of Tip
Top and 1,000 feet higher up the
mountain. This new drilling site, at
Lakeridge, is on a rocky, pine'covered
ridge with a lake at its base.
It’s a one ' and ' a ' half ' hour flight
from the company’s Rocky Mountain
Division headquarters at Casper to the
town of Big Piney; then a 25'mile
drive along a climbing twisting road
that seems to cling precariously to the
mountain'side, to get to the drilling
site.
20 Below Zero.
Strangely enough as altitude is gain'
ed, the temperature also rises. This
is a freak of nature. Big Piney is of'
ten called the “ice'box of the nation”
and most of the time it is the coldest
spot in the country. Thirty'five de'
grees below is not unusual and the
thermometer may hover between 10
and 20 below for a week or more at
a time.
At the drilling site a rig capable
of drilling 15,000 feet is being used.
At the 6,6oo'feet level the 106th bit
had been “chewed up”, which meant
that each drilling bit averaged 62 feet.
These bits cost an average of £72 each,
which meant nearly £7,700 had ah
ready been spent for bits alone —with
a lot more still to come.
Even before the actual drilling be'
gan, this well already bore a price tag
of about £150,000 —consumed by seiV
mograph shooting, securing leases,
field mapping by geologists, building
roads and air strips, levelling off the
mountainside location and building
the required housing for the men.
The drilling cost will run to some'
where around £238,000 to bring the
total outlay to about £388,000.
%
Whether this money has been well
spent or merely spent on a well won’t
be known until the drill either finds
oil or hits “suitcase sand”—the point
where the drillers call it quits and pack
their suitcases.
If it finds oil. Vacuum affiliates’
crude oil reserves will have another
producing field. If not, then it will
be just another dry hole —and there’s
no market for dry holes.
Changes of Success.
Nearly one and a half million wells
were drilled in the United States up
to the end of 1950. Of these, only
one out of every nine wildcats drilled
in unproved territory was productive.
One in 44 wildcats discovered a field
with an estimated ultimate recovery
of more than a million barrels; and
only one in 967 discovered a field with
ultimate recovery of fifty million bar'
rels.
Set the Lakeridge wildcat well be'
ing drilled by the Vacuum Oil Com'
pany’s affiliate in this perspective and
it can be easily seen that the Oil In'
dustry’s phrase “risk capital” means
just what it says {and this is what pri'
vate enterprise has done since the be'
ginning of time and is still doing.
Everyone capable of thinking what
progress means will say “I’m all for
it”].
FLOATING DUTCH SCHOOL.
The City of Utrecht will get the
first floating school in The Nether'
lands. It will be a ship with a length
of 70 feet and a width of 18 feet.
AMERICAN SUBURBAN THEATRE.
Glued laminated wood arches, exposed to the
interior, are employed in this small (seats
300) informal suburban picture theatre at
Monte Vista village, Monterey, U.S.A. In-
ternal finish on top of the arches is wood
sheathing, the exterior being surfaced with
oiled redwood siding.
-"The Architectural Record,” U.S.A.
GOOD THEATRE PLANNING.
The planning of the side walls of the aud-
itorium of this new picture theatre in the
reconstruction of Cologne is of special inter-
est, giving, as it does, safe and rapid exits
from six points along both sides instead of the
usual one or two. Raking away from the eye
and facing the stage the effect inside the
auditorium is one of a series of receding
planes.

ELECTRIC POWER FOR A CEMENT WORKS.
The new cement works near Shoreham, Sussex, England, for Associated Portland Cement
Manufacturers Ltd., is one of the largest in Europe and employs the most up-to-date plant and
processes for cement making from chalk slurry. The capacity is 350,000 tons of cement per
year Power is received from the national grid at 33 kV and transformed to 3 kV for internal
distribution, supplying all motors above 100 h.p. at this voltage. Smaller motors operate at
415v. 3-phase. Total installed capacity is between 9,000 and 10,000 h.p. for which the expect-
ed maximum demand is 5,100 kVA. The left hand picture shows the two rotary kilns 350
feet long, driven by 150 h.p. motors. Their diameters are 10ft. at the barrel and lift. 6in
at the burning zone. The right hand picture is of the Henley main and pilot cables in the
tunnel leading to the main substation.

STEEP OR NOT SO STEEP.
The tendency today is for roofs of houses to be much flatter in pitch (seldom more than 30 deg.) than, for in-
stance, twenty years ago. when the attic type of house was extremely popular. This panel of four designs by
a coincidence, contains two that employ the greater roof pitch to embrace additional bedroom accommodation in
the roof space, lighting being in the gable ends amplified by dormers. There still seems a case for the design
with the simple boarded gable ends (top left), though the Tudor half-timber as seen in top right and bottom
lett has gone out of favour and comes in for considerable criticism as being entirely anachronistic. The bottom
right plan is a straightforward timber design with the garage linked to the house in the American fashion by a
“breezeway.”
