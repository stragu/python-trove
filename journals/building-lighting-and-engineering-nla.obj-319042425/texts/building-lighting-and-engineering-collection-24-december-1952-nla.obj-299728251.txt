LIGHTING FITTINGS
There’s a Philips fluorescent lighting
fitting for every application. The units
themselves are designed not only for
efficient light distribution but to lend
themselves aesthetically to all types of
architectural designs, to minimise instal-
lation problems in old as well as new
buildings and to keep maintenance costs
down to a minimum. The units are
beautifully finished and all metal fittings
are coated with infra-baked lacquer to
ensure durability.
... a complete range for ail commercial, industrial and domestic applications
TYPE 8043
An attractive unit eminently
suitable for "in line" mounting
to provide custom-built light-
ing installations. Typical appli-
cations are strip lighting in dis-
play windows, show-cases, etc.;
continuous bare-lamp direct
lighting for large interiors;
decorative lighting for pelmets,
low-level ceiling panels, arti-
ficial fenestration, etc. Also
available as a single lamp fit-
ting (type 8042).
TYPE 8028
This unit is designed so that
lamps and glass strips can easily
be arranged for 2, 3 or 4 x 40
watt lamp operation. It is
primarily intended for ceiling
mounting in locations requiring
high efficiency and low main-
tenance costs; these include all
commercial interiors offices,
retail stores, hotels, cafes, etc.
Light distribution is such that
the ceiling is adequately illumin-
ated, whether the fitting is
surface mounted or suspended.
TYPE 8109
Here is one of the most modern
and efficient versions of the
totally-enclosed general diffusing
fluorescent lighting fitting. It
combines excellent appearance
with light weight and outstand-
ing performance. The design is
essentially simple and can be
adapted to almost any type of
interior, including executive
offices, better-class retail stores
and the more prominent places
of public assembly.
TYPE 80048
(not illustrated)
This is a self-contained dispersive type lighting
unit for all forms of industrial interiors, ware-
houses, storerooms, factories, machine shops,
garages, etc. Type 80008 for a single 40-watt

For roofing and walling particularly in coastal areas where

Zincahneal! Fully approved for water catchment, its protective
zinc coating is actually annealed to the steel sheet, making
it highly rust resistant and less liable to flake, chip or peel
when used for working up purposes. Takes paint, too,
without primer and available both corrugated and flat,

The thin armour plating of a fish’s
scales is the best protection that
nature can offer for the purpose. It
is effective because of its smooth
surface and overlapping of its tiny
scales. A similar arrangement is found
in “Alpaste,” the aluminium paint pig-
ment, whereby minute flat particles of
pure aluminium overlap to form a
metallic film with protective and durable
qualities. This “leafing” property of the
pigment gives aluminium paint much of
its durability, moisture resisting qualities,
opacity, power to reflect light and heat and
resistance to smoke and fumes.
“Alpaste” paint pigment is widely used
for the protection of weather exposed
surfaces of all types —industrial, commercial
or for the home. Bridges, transport vehicles,
ships and factories are also benefiting
owing to the unique properties of aluminium
paint.

Christmas Greetings
“W hen it's Christmas man is bigger and is better in his part;
He is \eener for the service that is prompted by the heart.
All the petty thoughts and narrow seem to vanish for a while,
And the true reward he's seeding is the glory of a smile.
Then for others he is toiling and somehow it seems to me
That at Christmas he is almost what God wanted him to be.”
Once more the Christmas season is
coming round again. To busy folk,
such as the readers of this journal, the
years slip by as new matters of interest
cross our paths in unending succes-
men.
Yet the Christmas season will al-
wavs be something special although to
a degree dependent on the individual's
age and family associations.
For is not this, above all, the season
Edgar Guest.
of goodwill that brings us a regular
reminder that there are others more
deserving of our thoughts than our
own selves. It is the time too, for
opening our hearts to those less for'
tunately placed.
This is the time of peace on earth
to men of goodwill. As we take a look
around the world we find peace in
those countries where the people de'
sire to live on friendly terms with their
neighbours.
Although there are still wars in
Asia that it seems impossible to bring
to an end, the great majority of the
nations of the world are striving for
peace and the opportunity to build
rather than to destroy.
We have our share of this building
work to be done in Australia, using
the term in its widest sense. In this,
too, we can build something for the
rest of the world as well as for our*
selves.
According as we make the best and
fullest use of those abundant resources
that Nature has granted us, of the
scientific knowledge that other work'
ers have handed on to us, and also of
such individual talents as we may be
endowed with, so we may count on
contributing our share to peace on
earth. Thus we may, as a nation,
merit the Divine blessing and be as'
sured always of a Happy Christmas.

CONFIDENCE AND THE FUTURE
1953 IN PROSPECT.
The year 1952 draws to a close. Many will not be sorry to see it go. It has
been a difficult year: a year of change and transition; the boom bubble burst and
inevitable readjustment came in its train with sharp reactions in the sensitive economic
structure of the Nation. Drastic Government action—politically courageous action —
was taken and the inflation spiral was blunted. Another depression that was on the
way through extraordinarily lavish spending has been arrested. The shock of some
of the economic decisions and their repercussions were felt throughout the land and
there was many a long face and pessimistic utterance: it was splendid material with
which to play politics, and it was played up properly.
The months passed, and calamity howlers have wondered since why they became
so agitated. Gradually some, who had been most vocal, had second thoughts and
began to see some good in what had been done. Already we are no longer a debtor
nation: we have more money in the banks than we have ever had, despite the fact
that the transitional unemployed have been compelled to draw out and live upon
their bank savings.
To-day, everyone admits that business is on the up. An excellent Christmas is
assured, desipte the fact that transport problems have frustrated normal shopping
arrangements.
Thus, 1953 is definitely being faced with confidence.
And so it should be!
Mr. C. R. McKerihan, one of our leading bankers and one who has never been
a Jeremiah, recently took out some figures on Australia’s development over the past
hundred years and he found that despite depressions and wars, in every decade since
1840 we have increased in production and population.*
Notwithstanding World War 11, 1950 was better than 1940, and there is no
doubt that the story will be the same in 1960.
The greatest ingredient for prosperity is confidence. It is useless, Mr. McKerihan
said, having huge credits available to the people in their accounts if they lack con-
fide nee. Every time a business transaction is effected by the drawing out of money
it probably makes a chain affecting six or seven others, which each in turn benefit
before the money returns to the bank structure.
And so we can most hopefully look to 1953 if we ourselves display that quality
of buoyancy that is in the offing.

The Olvmpic Stadium for the 1956 Games in Melbourne
£1,000,000 STRUCTURE FOR MELBOURNE.
The result of the Architectural Competition for the design of the stadium
for the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne was announced on October 20 by the
Chairman of the Games Control Committee, Mr- A. W. Coles.
First Prize went to Mr. Frank Heath, Melbourne architect, who obtains the
commission to build this great structure that is estimated to cost in excess of
£1,000,000.
Five other designs received a premium of £5OO each: Keith Payne and
Bruce Shaw, Sydney; Stephenson 6? Turner (Melbourne Office); Stephenson &
Turner (Sydney Office); Bates, Smart and McCutcheon, Melbourne; John G.
Barton, Melbourne.
The stadium will have a total capacity of 125,000 spectators, including
50.000 persons seated, of whom 26,000 will be under cover and the remaining
75.000 persons standing. Accommodation for spectators has been provided in
two tiers. A basic requirement was public circulation, with the object of emptying
the stadium in a maximum of ten minutes.
The main structure will be partly reinforced concrete and partly
concrete, while the roof will be of steel construction.
The stadium is 1038 ft. long on its major axis and 918 ft. on the minor; the
structure is approximately 212 ft. wide, leaving an oval of 615 ft. by 495 ft. The
arena is to be excavated below ground level further to increase visibility.
Ample concourses have been provided and throughout there will be services
such as restaurants, first aid, telephones, cafeteria, bar, toilets, etc. A one-man
control scoreboard will be installed.

SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HE LIKES TO BUILD
(Told by R.W.)
Boy craftsman, home builder, builder of many splendid structures,
finally the first Master Builder to be awarded the Master Builders’
Association Plaque of Honour for Distinguished Services to the
Building Industry. Enough for one lifetime but Charles F. Gage
still devotes his energies to the advancement of his beloved In-
dustry.
“Because I like to build,” was his
simple answer to the question: “To
what do your contribute your sue-
cess?
I was talking to a successful Mast-
er Builder, Charles F. Gage, a married
man with sons also in the building
industry, and I knew that what he
said would have sound reasoning be-
hind it.
Isn’t it true that the more a man
loves his work, the harder he will
work at it? And the harder he works,
all things being equal, the more suc-
cessful he will be?
There is no doubt but that he is
upright and honest, because everybody
he has built for and dealt with will
swear to his squareness.
“There is a strange fascination for
me in using wood and steel, brick and
cement, in making buildings and
homes. The actual construction has
always meant more to me than to
most people,” said Mr. Gage, in talk-
ing of his work as a builder, which
began as a boy in London and lured
him on, until he became a master
builder honoured by his own select
fraternity throughout Australia.
The story of this interesting man
who has crowded so much of achieve-
ment into the sixty-seven years of his
life is the story of creative work,
coupled with great effort.
As he talked in his quiet pleasant
way Mr. Gage expressed his recipe
for Success: When a man finds
the thing that brings him happiness
in doing it and has the strength and
willingness to work, he just naturally
achieves the measure of Success of
which he is capable.
“Good Work Brings Own Reward”.
Like many prominent master build-
ers in the Commonwealth today, Mr.
Gage was born in England. Like
.u•.i i i i .
em, in is you . e
Australia as a land of great oppor
tunity, and like many of them, he
found his “pot of gold” under the
, , c .
beckoning Southern Cross.
But many long years of hard work,
of ups and downs and setbacks were
to be faced by young Charles Gage
before he finally achieved his goal.
Today he can sit back in his com'
fortable office and reflect: “Good
work brings its own reward. ’
That is a philosophy that pays div'
idends, Mr. Gage told me last week.
And after inspecting many of the fine
buildings he has erected, I realised just
how right he was.
Charles Gage was educated at West'
bourne Church of England School,
London. For some time he studied
accountancy, and then because of his
love of making things, he became a
carpenter and joiner. He came to
Australia in 1912.
In that year he entered into the
employ of J. I. Green and Sons,
Queensland Master Builders, and for
five years studied Building Construe-
tion and Quantity Surveying at Bris-
bane Technical College, and obtained
an Honours Pass in 1919 for Build-
ing Estimating.
1914 saw Mr. Gage started on his
own account as a builder, and in that
year he became an active member of
the Queensland Master Builders’ As-
sociation.
In 1919 he came to Sydney and
took up a position as Inspector of
Works for the War Service Homes
Commission.
Mr. Gage successfully carried out
these duties until 1923, when he re-
signed and resumed business on his
own account, trading as C. F. Gage
and Sons.
Principal Jobs.

• Civic Service.
Mr. Gage’s record of unstinting
•public service reads like a Who’s
Who.
“Because I was a practical builder
it was my duty to do all I could, to
advance the building industry,” he
said.
The manner in which he discharg-
ed these, and other important duties
recently received unique recognition
from his fellow Master Builders in
N.S.W.
In 1939. Mr. Gage became a mem-
ber of the Sub-Committee, Sydney
Technical College; 1940-41, mem-
ber, Sydney Technical College Ad-
visory Council and District Council
until 1950; 1942, member. Com-
monwealth Treasury Building Advis-
ory Committee.
From 1936 to 1948, he was a
member of the Sydney Corporation
Building Advisory Committee, and as-
sisted in drafting various by-laws gov-
erning building regulations in Sydney.
Services to Builders.
Mr. Gage has also rendered long
and meritorious service to the build-
ing industry generally and to build-
ers in particular, and he has occupied
the highest offices within the Austra-
lian builders’ organisations.
In 1924-26 he was President,
St. George Branch, Master Builders’
Association; 1940-41, President,
Master Builders’ Association of
N.S.W.; 1944-45, President. Master
Builders’ Federation of Australia, and
this year he is first President of the
N.S.W. Chapter, Australian Institute
of Builders.
Master Builders’ Association Award.
At the recent Master Builders’ As-
sedation of N.S.W. Annual Dinner,
Mr. Charles F. Gage and Mrs.
Florence M. Taylor, 0.8. E., were
jointly presented with the first Awards
of Honour to be given by the Associ-
ation.
With a typically fraternal gesture,
the Master Builders’ Association de-
cided to recognise jointly the services
of these two stalwarts who have rend-
ered the building industry such out-
standing service in their respective
fields of construction and trade journ-
alism.
The Award, in Mr. Gage’s opinion,
is proof positive of his maxim that
“Good work brings its own reward.”
Confidence in Future.
I asked Mr. Gage to express his
personal opinion of Australia’s future
He replied:
“I saw Australia weather one de-
pression, and I have every confidence
that the country will successfully pass
through this temporary recession.
“Australia will undoubtedly recov-
er very rapidly from her present
troubles. In fact, there are very defi-
nite signs that things are again on
the up-grade.
“But there is no easy way,” Mr.
Gage warned.
SYDNEY CHEVRA KADISHA.
Erected for the Jewish Holy Brotherhood by Master Builders C. F. Gage & Sons. The building was commenced
in 1949 but the building permit allowed construction to be carried in stages covering three periods of approxi-
mately nine months each. Architects: Lipson and Kaad.

“We must build a bond of sound
understanding of the economic forces
with which Australia is faced,” he
added.
Recently returned from an eight
months overseas tour, Mr. Gage said
he was more and more convinced of
Australia’s ultimate place in the sun.
“But we want to proclaim our
achievements to the skies, and let the
world know what we have done, and
can do,” he declared.
Now, at sixty-seven, Mr. Gage has
just completed the construction of
the Sydney Chevra Kadisha, an im-
posing Jewish funeral home,
Mr. Gage is justly proud of this
splendid building. That same instinct
which led him as a boy to make things
has led him to build this structure
which expresses as best he can the art
and pride of the master builder.
And Chevra Kadisha, and all the
many other fine buildings which have
risen under the skilled hand of Mr.
Charles Gage, each bear mute witness
to his mapim; “Good work brings
its own reward.”
This metal plaque, similar in every
detail to the plaque presented to Mr.
Charles F. Gage was presented to
Mrs. Florence Taylor by the Master
Builders of N.S.W. as a token of
appreciation.
The plaque records:
“1952. This Plaque of Honor,
presented to Florence M. Taylor,
0.8. E., for distinguished services to
the science and practice of construe'
tion in Australia. She has applied
her brilliant talents to the welfare
and advancement of the avocation she
adorns.
“This plaque to be known in future
as the Florence M. Taylor award will
be presented to those whom it is de-
sired to reward for Distinguished
Service to our industry.”
Signed C. E. Thompson. President.
Mr. Thompson mentioned her quah
ifications and said Mrs. Taylor s
achievements as a Town Planner are
most, unique, and in the whole world
there is no other woman who has at'
tained to life membership of 24 edu'
cational, constructive, artistic and
other associations, nor does any other
woman throughout the world edit
Architects’ and Builders’ magazines
such as she produces, the three of
which are accredited journals, repre'
senting scientific and learned societies
in Australia, and Master Builders’
Organisations. •
“Mrs. Taylor edited and produced
many pamphlets on Town Planning
which are a memorable record of her
ability and foresight.”
Lightweight Timber
Roof For Small
Buildings
Saving of Timber.
To assist the Australian building
industry, the Commonwealth Experi'
mental Building Station has prepared
designs for roof trusses, using Aus'
tralian hardwoods of Strength Group
”G” and has built and severely tested
trusses made to these designs. Since
they were first introduced early in
1949, hundreds of trusses have been'
made and successfully used in the
southern States of Australia.
The C.E.B.S. designs include
trusses for clear spans of 16ft., 20ft.,
24ft., and 28ft., and a truss spacing
of 3ft. is adequate for a tiled roof
and of up to 4ft. 6in. spacing for a
sheeted roof. Intermediate ceiling
joists are, of course, required to sup'
port the ceiling lining. Roofs con'
structed in this way show savings of
up to 40% in the roof timbers and
also require less skilled labour for
making and erection than is needed
for setting out, cutting and erecting
the usual type of roof framing. The
trusses are most suitable for use with
gable ended roofs over rectangular
buildings.
As the internal partitions are not
needed to support the roof, they can
be of nondoad bearing construction
built on to the floor without founda'
tions. However, if they are required
as bracing between the external walls,
normal building procedure must be
followed.
In developing hardwood trusses,
the Station’s engineers gave special at'
tention to the design of the joints
with the object of using small fasten-
ing units so as to minimize the risk
of the timber splitting during shrink'
age. Two types of trusses have been
evolved —one with nailed joints and
the other with rivetted joints. Nailed
trusses require overlapping joints and
slightly larger timber sizes than are
needed for rivetted trusses, in which
the joints are strengthened with sheet
metal gusset plates. Thus, the rivetted
truss is tse more economical in timber
but is best made in a workshop, while ,
the nailed truss lends itself to pro'
duction on the site.

SYDNEY DESIGNER RETURNS FROM OVERSEAS
NEW IDEAS AND INNOVATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL USE
When he returned recently from
an extensive overseas tour, Mr.
George Watkins, designer-in-chief at
Frank O’Brien Pty. Ltd., Sydney, ar-
rived back with portfolios of new and
brilliant ideas, innovations, plans and
designs gleaned in many countries.
Mr. Watkins is hopeful that most
of these ideas will be later incorpor-
ated in the planning of new stores,
restaurants, hotels, salons, theatres,
and office layouts in the Common-
wealth.
“There is a world of opportunity
here to develop new interior design
ideas to bring our business places up
to world standard,” Mr. Watkins said.
“I am personally very keen on
adapting overseas ideas to Sydney re-
quirements. We have the material to
work with, the craftsmen to do the
jobs, and the premises crying out
for renovation,” he added.
Overseas Impressions.
Mr. Watkins left Australia for Eng-
land in the middle of 1950. On ar-
rival in London he took the oppor-
tunity of doing interior designing as
a means of widening his practical
knowledge of the profession, and to
further his experience in company
with Britain’s leading designers.
Mr. Watkins was particularly im-
pressed at the high standard of mod-
ern design attained by British design-
ers, and especially in connection with
the recent Festival of Britain.
After spending a year in England,
he went to France and Italy, and spent
his time painting, making notes, and
filling many sketch books with mod-
ern —almost revolutionary—ideas.
Mr. Watkins found that very exten-
sive use was made of glass on the Con-
tinent, in conjunction with many mod-
ern materials.
In Italy, especially, he found very
modern shops, well-designed, and con-
siderably advanced in conception and
construction, to elsewhere.
In the lighting field, too, an im-
mense advancement was evident, with
great emphasis placed on using the
correct light with the correct colour.
In Paris, for instance, neon lights
were of pale pastels, and blues, pinks,
and whites, with a complete absence
of harsh colours.
The trend in modern store design
is to bring the light down to the cus-
tomers, with well-lit stocks,” Mr.
Watkins said.

Mr. Watkins thus had the oppor-
tun,tv of working on the desrgnmg of
the latest restaurant in Toronto (see
... . , , , • . i
illustration), and he also painted a
dozen abstract oil paintings as part of
the decoration.
He found that in Canada contem-
porary design in equipment, appoint-
ments, lighting and decoration was up-
to-the-minute in every way, and Can-
adians fastidious to a degree both in
their home and community life.
“ ‘Nothing but the best is good
enough’, is undoubtedly the national
slogan,” Mr. Watkins commented.
Through U.S.A.
Mr. Watkins also travelled through
the United States, gathering impres-
sions, making sketches, studying the
means and methods whereby the
Americans obtain such wonderful ef-
fects with design, materials, and light-
ing.
He spent a great deal of time in-
specting some of the world’s most out-
standing stores in the U.S.A., and
Mr. Watkins has returned to Austra-
lia with a wealth of knowledge and
experience to incorporate in the de-
sign of many of Australia’s show-
rooms, restaurants, and business prem-
ises of the future.
U.N.E.S.C.O’s PARIS
HEADQUARTERS.
Plans Prepared by French
and American Architects.
Plans for new U.N.E.S.C.O. build'
ings in Paris have been approved by
an international panel of five archi'
tects and will be submitted for ap'
proval to the General Conference of
U.N.E.S.C.O. The plans were drawn
up by two architects, Mr. Bernard
Zehrfuss (France) and Mr. Marcel
Breuer (United States), and one en-
gineer, M. Pier Nervi (Italy).
The site chosen for the new
U.N.E.S.C.O. Headquarters is in the
western part of Paris, bordering the
Bois de Boulogne between the Porte
Dauphine and the Porte Maillot. It
measures approximately 2200 ft. by
280 ft.
Three Buildings.
There will be three buildings a
16'Storey Office Building; a central
Conference Building; and an Audi'
torium for General Conference
plenary sessions with the amphi-
theatre. The form of the Office
Building will be that of an elongated
rectangle in harmony with the basic
plan of Paris. It will be about 200 ft.
high, 305 ft. long, and 55ft. wide.
I their report, the architects point
out that, despite its proposed height,
the 16-story building will be lower
than the principal monuments along
the great transverse axis of Paris;
Louvre—Tuileries—Place de la Con-
corde Champs Elysees Etoile
Porte Maillot Porte de Nouilly
Rond Point de la Defense. For in-
stance, it will be 3 sft. lower than the
Arc de Triomphe at the Etoile.
The Central Building will include
rooms for conferences and for the
Executive Board, the Conference Sec-
retariat, and Press, radio and tele-
vision facilities. It will be about 30ft.
high, 220 ft. wide, and 370 ft. long.
Finally, the Auditorium has been
conceived to serve as a meeting room
adaptable for presentation of concerts

Architectural Problems.
In their report, the architects state
that it was necessary to conceive the
building not only as a utilitarian struc'
ture but also as the architectural cm-
bodiment of a great idea.
The tradition of Paris, a city in
which every monument bears witness
to each period’s artistic expression, re'
quires that the U.N.E.S.C.O. building
should also be an expression of con'
temporary living art.
This idea will be reflected in the
visual effect created by the contrast of
the vertical and horizontal elements
of the two main buildings. The
architects have also sought to achieve
this aesthetic impact by simplicity and
by avoiding any form of expression
which might quickly become out'ob
date.
Construction of the buildings is ex'
pected to take two years. It is estb
mated that the cost of construction
will be 7,678,00 Odollars (£A. 3,443,'
000) or 2,687,300,000 French francs.
Duplex Buildings
Still Flats
No Relaxation Approved.
The Local Government and Shires
Association advise in their latest Bub
letin (4/1952) that following the dis'
cussion between the Executive and the
Minister a further careful examination
was made of the case put forward by
the Association that the definition of
residential flat building should not in'
elude a duplex building.
The Minister, however, is still of
opinion that no amendment of the
Local Government Act, 1919, should
be made.
A New Brick
A British inventor has just invested
£lO,OOO in world patent rights for a
brick which, it is claimed, will halve
the time required to build a house.
The inventor is a goldsmith. Mr.
T. Leyshon. He has devised a brick
with two large perpendicular holes.
With these bricks a wall is built in
layers of four or five bricks.
Into the holes of the top brick in
each set liquid cement is poured, thus
forming columns of cement down the
building, with the result that a brick'
layer who can lay 1000 bricks a day
by the old method could lay 8000 this
way.

Problems of Illuminating Engineering
FLUORESCENT LIGHT AND THE EYE.
At the opening meeting of the new
session of The Illuminating Engineer-
ing Society held at the Royal Institu-
tion, London, Dr. W. J. Wellwood
Ferguson, the new President, dealt
with some of the many aspects of
lighting which require co-operation
between widely differing interests.
Lighting problems, said Dr.
Ferguson, are full of complexity; satis-
factory lighting must be efficient, com-
fortable. harmless, economic and give
a certain degree of aesthetic satisfac-
tion. The problems must, therefore.
be approached along several distinct
and separate lines —amongst them the
physical, physiological and psycho-
logical.
In recent years the problems of
illuminating engineering have been in-
creased by the widespread introduc-
tion of fluorescent lighting and tele-
vision. The application of fluorescent
lighting to special industries such as
coal mining, weaving or steel produc-
tion and the aesthetic problems raised
by its effect on such things as food,
decorations or the female complexion
all call for special consideration.
Lighting and “Eyestrain.”
There are many and varied forms
of expression of visual fatigue, fre-
quently called “eyestrain.” The assess-
ment of such fatigue is no simple task.
It is difficult, for example, to deter-
mine how much of the so-called
fatigue is associated with the visual
task itself, and how much is due to
other factors.
The question of pathological effects
from fluorescent lighting is one that
has been raised from time to time,
more especially on the Continent. The
eye is adapted to receive and perceive
the visible waves, but many of the
invisible waves enter the eye to a
greater or lesser depth and, while not
perceived, may cause pathological
effects due to the destruction of tissue.
Under ordinary conditions no organic
lesion of the eye as a result of ex-
posure to visible rays has been estab-
lished, and again under ordinary con-
ditions. the retina would appear to be
immune from fatigue thereby.
So far as the retina is concerned
there is no evidence of any lesion
being produced by ultra-violet waves.
In any case only about 3 per cent, of
the shorter waves reach the retina and
it is, therefore, extremely unlikely that
any pathological effect in the deeper
tissues could occur. The emission of
ultra - violet light from fluorescent
lamps is confined to the longer wave
lengths and is in fact less in intensity
than that present in daylight in a
clear atmosphere. It would seem that
the chances of harmful effects from
ultra-violet radiation from fluorescent
lamps, except under extraordinary con-
ditions, are minimal in the extreme.
How far retinal disorders resulting
from exposure to the sun’s radiation
are due to the shorter wavelength as
opposed to the visible and ultra-
violet wavelengths has not so far been
precisely determined.

The Development of the Snowy Mountains Potential
By Mr. W. M. SHELLSHEAR*, A.M.I.E. (Aust.)
SUMMARY.
The constitution of the Snowy
Mountains Hydroelectric Authority
by Act of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment in July, 1949, not only rep'
resented a most important contribu'
tion to the Nation’s future economic
security but in addition marked the
commencement of what must be re'
gardec as one of the most signifi'
cant :hapters in the history of civil
enginsering in Australia.
THs article outlines briefly the
evens leading up to the creation of
the irganisation set up to undertake
this work, describes the general con'
cepton and salient features of the
scheme and details the progress which
has already taken place in the achieve-
mert of the objective.
INTRODUCTION.
The mainland of Australia lies be-
ween the tropics and the wet temper-
ite zone and, with the exception of
the eastern coast of the continent, re-
ceives relatively low annual rainfall.
The coastal rain, as might be expect
ed, fall generally to the east of the
Great Dividing Range and are in the
greater part wasted to the Pacific
Ocean.
The Nation’s water resources are
accordingly limited, and, with the
possible exception of the south eastern
part of the continent, do not lend
themselves readily to economic devel-
opment.
The most extensive irrigation devel-
opments of Australia lie along the
Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers
which flow inland from the Great
Dividing Range. Diversion of water
inland from the eastern side of the
range is essential if the irrigation po-
tential of these great river valleys is
to be fully developed. In the Mur-
rumbidgee valley alone it has been
estimated that diversion of water in-
land from the Snowy River and its
tributaries will not only ensure an
adequate flow of water under all con-
ditions, but will make available suffi-
cient water to irrigate an additional
200,000 acres and give a domestic
and stock water supply to lands with-
in holdings totalling two million acres.
The Snowy River rises in the high-
est part of the Southern Alps, re-
ceives its run-off from the mountain
snowsheds and regions of relatively
high annual precipitation in the south
eastern corner of the continent, and
discharges finally into the Pacific
Ocean.
Inland diversion of this water and
its utilisation is the principal objec'
tive of the Snowy Mountains Hydro'
Electric Authority.
The entire development is design'
ed to furnish peak power load with
steam aeneration furnishing the base
load. The ultimate development will
provide several independent series of
power stations, each with a large stor-
age reservoir and independent water
supply. Large storage reservoirs in
the lower inland valleys will re'regu'
late the flow of the diverted water to
meet irrigation requirements.
BRIEF HISTORY.
Since 1884 many proposals have
been advanced for the utilisation of
the water resources of the Snowy
Mountains Area. Although the earlier
schemes were concerned primarily
with irrigation, a survey was carried
out between 1915 and 1918 by the
N.S.W. Government with a view to
harnessing the power potential of the
Snowy River. These proposals, which
involved the generation of 250,000
kilowatts, were reviewed in 1937 and
again in 1944, when a special com'
mittee was set up by the N.S.W. Gov'
ernment to investigate the proposal
with emphasis on the need for diver'
sion inland to the Murrumbidgee
River.
Effective action was taken for the
first time in 1946 when, as a result
of a conference between Ministers of
the Commonwealth and the States
of N.S.W. and Victoria, it was agreed
that an investigation should be made
to determine the practicability of a
proposal to divert the Snowy waters
into the Murray valley. A Technical
Committee consisting of experts of
the two States and the Commonwealth
under the’very capable chairmanship
of Dr. L. F. Loder, then carried out
a thorough investigation of the exist'
ing proposals and, in a final report
submitted to the Conference of Min'
isters representing the Commonwealth
and States concerned, recommended
a broader approach to the develop'
ment of the area than had been con'
templated in any of the earlier
schemes, and put forward a firm pro'
posal for the diversion of the Snowy
River waters and their utilisation in
combination with the waters of the
upper Murrumbidgee, Tumut and
upper Murray Rivers with their trib'
utaries.
The Conference of Ministers, in
July, 1949, agreed to the recommend'
ations and legislation was enacted for
the establishment of a hydro'electric
authority to implement the proposals.
THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS
HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER
ACT.
The Snowy Mountains Hydro'Elec'
trie Power Act No. 25 of 1949 receiv'
ed Royal assent on 7th July, 1949.
Under the provisions of the Act
the Authority has power to construct,
maintain, operate and control works
for the collection, diversion and stor-
age of waters in the Snowy Mourn
tains Area, and for the generation of
electricity in that area.
The Authority is constituted by a
Commissioner, assisted by two Asso'
ciate Commissioners, each being ap'
pointed by the Governor-General.
With the appointment of the present
Commissioner on the Ist August,
1949, the Authority became formally
constituted.
PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT.
The magnitude and importance of
the proposed works, coupled with the
conviction that the country’s econ-
omy was such that any delay in the
achievement of the Authority’s objec'
tives could not be tolerated, moved
the Authority to determine a plan of
attack which was both orthodox and
courageous in its conception.
This plan, which has been pursued
vigorously since the Authority’s incep'
tion, provided in effect, for the im-
mediate recruitment of field construe'
tion forces to enable field work to
commence at the earliest possible mo'
ment.
Whilst it was realised that such a
procedure must inevitably result in
some phases of the work proceeding
at times in advance of the receipt of
completed investigations and designs,
the Authority placed the fullest pos'
sible confidence in the technical ex'
cellence of the preliminary investiga'
tions carried out by the Technical
Committee led by Dr. Loder, to which
reference has already been made.
The serious world food shortage
which is now becoming apparent, to'
gether with the emphasis being fo'
cussed on the necessity for the wisest
possible use of Australia's limited
natural resources, has further justified
the step taken.
Pursuant to this policy, it has prov-

ed possible to place an overseas con-
tract for the design and construction
of the Guthega works, which will be
described later, at a much earlier date
than would otherwise have been pos-
sible.
To enable the Authority’s pro-
gramme to proceed as rapidly as pos-
sible, it was decided to embark on an
overseas recruitment programme. An
Associate Commissioner of the Auth-
ority visited New Zealand, the Unit-
ed Kingdom, Norway and Sweden,
where he interviewed and selected ap-
plicants who had responded to the
Authority’s advertisements in those
countries. By June, 1951, over 100
professional staff, mostly engineers,
had been recruited overseas. In ad-
dition, 60 professional men who had
found their own way from overseas,
were engaged in Australia.
This recruitment programme has
had threefold advantages. It has in-
creased the Authority’s ability to press
on with the work at a more rapid
rate than would otherwise have been
possible; it has made a substantial ad-
dition to Australia’s pool of technical
men, and it has reduced to a mini-
mum the drawing of technical staff
from other Australian engineering or-
ganisations.
Similar action was taken to satisfy
from overseas the Authority’s labour
requirements, the result of which is
that over half of the Authority’s wages
employees are immigrants.
The shortage of skilled tradesmen is
even more acute than that of profes-
sional men. Accordingly, steps were
taken to engage 650 tradesmen from
western Germany. By 30th June,
1951, nearly 400 Germans had arriv-
ed in Australia and were at work in
various parts of the Snowy Mountains
area.
Their selection was carried out by
an Officer of the Authority and an
Officer of the N.S.W. Department of
Technical Education who went to
western Germany in January for the
purpose. Trade tests were conducted
for the building tradesmen before se-
lection, and all applicants were sub-
jected to normal security screening
and other migration formalities.
By the 30th June, 1952, the Auth-
ority’s staff totalled 893 Officers and
2034 wages employees.
THE SNOWY-MURRAY
PROPOSALS.
It will be apparent from the ac-
companying diagrammatic plan that
the many individual components of
the scheme, each in itself a self-con-
tained project of no small magnitude,
may be considered under two main
geographical groupings: the Snowy-
Murray, and the Eucumbene-Tooma-
Tumut proposals.
Both of these developments are de-
signed to operate conjointly and in
conjunction with other power devel-
opments in N.S.W. and Victoria.
The Snowy-Murray diversion works
will comprise three major develop-
ments from which the nett gain, in
water for irrigation by diversion and
regulation, will amount to 700,000
acre feet per annum. Ten power sta-
tions, having a total installed capacity
of 1,700,000 kW are to be provided.
The principal works of the Snowy-
Murray development involve the diver-
sion of the Snowy River by means
of an earth fill dam, approx. 260
feet high at Jindabyne, and a trans-
mountain tunnel to the headwaters of
the Murray River, approximately 30
miles in length and varying in diam-
eter from 25 feet to 44 feet.
The two secondary project group'
ings consist of the development of
the power potential of the Upper
Snowy River, and the development
of the Geehi River potential. Both
these secondary developments feed
into the main tunnel by means of ver-
tical shafts.
Extensive use of surface racelines is
also planned to augment the storages
provided. The largest of these, over

100 miles in length, extends well into
Victoria.
Power station M 6 on the main tun-
nel, with its surge tank and pressure
shaft, is to be located near the point
where the main tunnel will surface
at Bogong Creek. As the water in
the Bogong Creek near the discharge
from station M 6 is approximately 1450
feet above the Swampy Plains River,
it is proposed to provide a weir on
Bogong Creek to pick up the dis-
charge from station M 6 and divert it
into a further section of tunnel having
a cross section of 1500 sq. ft. and
feeding station M 7 located under-
ground at approximately 2 miles from
the final discharge from the main
tunnel.
It is proposed also to construct a
weir on the Geehi River with top
water level above the maximum level
in the Jindabyne storage so that sur-
plus flood water in the Geehi might
be conserved in the main Jindabyne
storage, the planned capacity of which
is 1,100,000 acre feet.
Of the works associated with the
Upper Snowy proposals, the major
storage will consist of a dam at Spen-
cers Creek having a capacity of about
15,000 acre feet, which will discharge
through power station MIA into the
Guthega pond where a small concrete
dam is now being constructed. From
the Guthega storage water will be led
through a tunnel and penstocks to
power station MlB which will dis-
charge into the Munyang storage.
Finally, water is fed from Munyang
through station M2H into the Islam
Bend pondage from whence the flow
of water into the main tunnel, by
means of the vertical shaft and sta-
tions M2L and M 3, will be control!'
ed by a weir.
The main work for the development
of power from the upper Geehi is to
consist of a small dam on Wind--
Creek (a tributary of the Geehi) to
divert the stream through a pressure
shaft to power station M 4, approxh
mately 1200 feet below the pondage.
The discharge from station M 4 will
be picked up by a small intake pond
below the power station and conveyed
by a canal to a further pondage above
the Geehi River. From this point
water will be conveyed by a pressure
shaft to station MSH.
On the east and west sides of the
Geehi catchment, collecting races are
to be provided to augment the stor'
ages.
Table 1 sets out details of the ten
power stations included in the Snowy-
Murray development.
THE EUCUMBENE-TOOMA-
TUMUT PROPOSALS.
As with the Snowy-Murray propos-
als, the diversion works founded on
the northern catchments may also be
considered as being made up of three
major developments.
The principle development is asso-
dated with the combination of the
waters of the upper Tumut, Tooma
and Eucumbene Rivers, their regula-
tion by a major storage on the Eucum-
bene River, near Adaminaby, and
the development of power in the two
major stations, T 1 and T 2, near
Tumut Pond.
The two secondary project groups
are those associated with the deveh
opment of the power potential of the
upper Murrumbidgee River and the
development of power in the lower
reaches of the Tumut valley.
The main works to be undertaken in
the Eucumbene-Tooma-Tumut deveh
opment consist of a dam on the Eu-
cumbene River having a capacity of
3,500,000 acre feet; a diversion tun'
nel of 3,000 cusecs nominal capacity
carrying water to a regulating reser'
void of 36,000 acre feet capacity on
the Tumut River, and a tunnel ap'
proximately 4 miles long through
which the waters of the upper Tooma
River will be diverted into the Tumut
River storage.
From the Tumut Pond storage,
where a concrete arch dam 700 feet

long and 290 feet high is to be erect'
ed, a tunnel will be driven to a surge
tank serving power station Tl. The
tunnel will have a diameter of ap'
proximately 25 feet and a length to
the surge tank, pressure shaft and
station of about 2 miles. A tailwater
tunnel from station Tl will discharge
into a pond formed by a weir on the
Tumut River from whence the water
will pass through a further tunnel
of approximately the same cross sec'
tion and about 8 miles in length to a
surge tank, pressure shaft and power
station at T 2.
The estimated irrigation benefit to
the Murrumbidgee valley from the Eu-
cumbene'Tooma diversion will amount
to approximately 565,000 acre feet per
annum. Seven generating stations,
having a total installed capacity of ap'
proximately 1,360,000 kW are in'
eluded in the northern proposals.
A significant feature of the Eucum'
bene'Tooma'Tumut diversion is the
requirement that provision is to be
made for reversing the flow in the
main tunnel so that surplus flood flows
in the upper Tumut and Tooma Rivers
can be stored in the Adaminaby res'
ervoir until required for power de'
velopment and irrigation inland. Con'
trol of the flow in the tunnel will be
by means of suitable regulating gates
at the inlet and exit.
The main work associated with the
development of power from the upper
Murrumbidgee River will be a dam
on the river at Tantangara, the
height of which will be approximately
150 feet, providing a gross storage of
over 350,0.00 acre feet. From this a
tunnel will run under the Dividing
Range to a surge tank, pressure shaft
and underground power station T 3 on
the Tumut side of the mountain. This
will have a length of about 8 miles
and a sectional area of about 300
square feet. The tailwater tunnel
from station T 3 will discharge into a
small pond formed by a weir on the
Yarrangobilly River. A further tun'
nel, about 5 miles long and 450 feet
in cross sectional area, will carry the
flow from this point to the surge tank
and underground power station T 4,
the discharge from which is led into
the Tumut River at Lobs Hole.
The works required for the deveh
opment of power in the lower Tumut
valley will include a dam on the
Tumut River at Lobs Hole which will
provide a storage of approximately
100,000 acre ft. The main purpose
of the dam is to create head for
power generation as only the top part
of the storage will be used to regu'
late the flow of the Yarrangobilly
River and the discharges from the
power stations T 2 and T 4. Power
station T 5 at the foot of the dam will
operate with a head of about 160
feet and will discharge to a regulating
pond formed by a weir on the Tumut
lver ‘
Alternative schemes for the further
development of the lower reaches of
the Tumut River between Lobs Hole
•and Talbingo are still under consid'
eration. However, the earlier propos-
als provided for a canal from the reg'
ulating pond at power station T 5 to
a forebay pond near station T 6.
Power station T 6 is planned to oper'
ate at a head of about 370 feet and
to discharge into the Blowering stor'
age. The latter, with a dam height
of about 280 feet, will have a full stor'
age capacity of approxim ate 1 y
846,000 acre feet.
Although the Blowering dam will
function primarily as a regulating
storage to control water from the
Tumut valley for irrigational require'
ments electricity will be generated at
the dam outlets in power station T 7.
The flow through the turbines, being
governed by irrigation requirements,
cannot be counted on to furnish any
firm power demand figure, and would
be used for energy production only.
It is expected that the Blowering dam
will take up to 8 years to complete.

It must be appreciated that the cap-
acities and other details given in these
tables are subject to final confirmation
following the completion of detailed
investigations at present being under-

INVESTIGATIONS AND
PRELIMINARY WORKS.
In their final report dated May,
1949, the Technical Committee whose
i _ _• i j . .i . l
early investigations led to the estab-
lishment of the Snowy Mountains
Hydro-Electric Authority, made it
clear that, although they had fulfilled
their mission of establishing the best
use, in general terms, for the waters
of the Snowy River and had indicat-
ed comprehensive schemes for power
development, they had been able to
carry out only preliminary work and
to submit a general plan for develop-
ment. They stressed that all the
work done by them must be extended
and amplified, possibly the proposals
varied to some extent and their ap-
proximations brought to a higher
state of accuracy before detailed de-
sign work could begin.
At the commencement of opera-
tions, therefore, the Authority placed
the highest priority on the task of
developing in detail the early inves-
tigations carried out by the Techni-
cal Committee.
Every effort has accordingly been
made to collect basic data on the
water resources of the area, particu-
larly in those parts scheduled for early
development and to this end approx-
imately 35 stream gauging stations
have already been established. The
establishment of new gauging stations
has necessitated the cutting of access
tracks into very rough country and
considerable effort has been expended
in this direction and in improving

The operation of the project as a
whole and the correlation of the op-
eration of each unit has been studied
f n detail and is being revised where
necessary as more definite information
j s obtained from field studies. This
important work, involving complicat-
ed anc j tedious computations and
studies, has revealed that the total
power capacity of the scheme can be
increased considerably and more water
can b e made available for irrigation
than had been previously planned,
To provide basic data for these
studies a large force of surveyors, the
majority of whom were recruited over-
seas, has been engaged in the area,
Owing to the rugged nature of the
country, surveying presents many dif-
Acuities. Consequently, aerial phofo-
graphy has been used extensively in
conjunction with ground surveys to
produce general maps of the terrain
required for the investigation of ah
ternative developments, the determine
ation of approximate capacities of
storages and the location of ancillary
works such as roads and camps. De'
tailed ground surveys of proposed
works areas, including racelines and
transmission lines, have been well ad'
vanced. In addition, a survey grid
system has been established covering
the whole of the Snowy Mountains
Area.
General geological mapping of the
area and detailed geological examina'
tion of foundation conditions at var'
ious alternative sites for dams and as'
sociated structures scheduled for early
commencement has been carried out.
Diamond and percussion drilling facih
ities have been used both for contract
and by day labour. The services of
the Bureau of Mineral Resources and
the Department of National Develop'
ment has been sought where difficult
foundation conditions have necessitat'
ed the use of refraction seismic meth'
ods. Further extensive refraction
seismic surveys are contemplated.
Having regard to the vastness of
the project and the importance of the
basic investigations now being carried
out, senior Officers of the Authority
have visited New Zealand, the
U.S.A., Great Britain, and the Con'
tinent to study engineering advance'
ments and modern practice in those
countries.
Apart from such field operations as
surveying, river gauging, diamond drill'
ing, shaft sinking and tunnelling, all
of which are required to provide data
for engineering investigations, work
in the field has been directed towards
the provision of acommodation, work'
shops, stores and access roads to
working points, mainly in preparation
for the placing of contracts for major
sections of the work. Much work
has been carried out at the headquart'
ers township of Cooma where cottages,
hostels, messes, offices and other town'
ship buildings have already been erect'
ed. A large stores, workshop and
transport depot with its own railway
siding has been developed.
Similar work has been carried out
at Jindabyne where the present vil-
lage is to be submerged by the Jin-
dabyne dam. The new works town-
ship now under construction will take
the place of the present village when
the works are completed. In addi'
tion, a considerable amount of inves-
tigatory work has been carried out at
the three possible alternative sites for
the Jindabyne dam.
An active programme on the con-
struction of preliminary works in the
upper Snowy region has been pursued
in order to ensure an early start be-

ing made on the contract for the
Guthega project. Construction camps
have been set up at Munyang, Smig'
gin Holes, Perisher and Guthega and
a large proportion of the Authority s
construction force and plant has been
concentrated in this area. Despite ad'
verse weather conditions these prelim'
inary works were completed in time
for the contractor to commence oper'
ations in September, 1951.
At Island Bend, the principal centre
for all works in the upper Snowy
region, a large works township has
already been built up with staff cot'
tages, barracks, workshops and stores
buildings. A diesel power station hav'
ing an installed capacity of 3,000
kW, has also been set up at Island
Bend to meet construction require'
ments in the region. Power is con'
veyed to Munyang and Guthega by
an 11 kV transmission line.
Over £2m. worth of construction
plant and equipment has been con'
centrated at the principal work cem
tres. Due to the shortage of suitable
plant in general and of earth moving
equipment in particular, difficulties
were experienced by the Authority in
these early stages in arranging for
equipment to be laid off for overhaul
as frequently as would have been de-
sired. However, with the fulfilment
of outstanding orders and the im'
provement of workshop facilities most
of these difficulties have been over'
come. The difficult road conditions,
especially in winter, has also placed
a great strain on the transport ser'
vices and the performance of adequate
repairs and maintenance has been dif'
ficult.
Reliable communications to provide
proper control of the Authority’s ac'
tivities and to link the many scattered
centres of the Authority’s works have
been provided. A frequency modu'
lated radio network links Cooma, Jin-
dabyne. Island Bend and Tumut Pond:
and several motor vehicles, including
ambulances, are fitted with this equip'
ment. High frequency base radio sta'
tions have been set up at regional
centres to provide communication
with survey and other mobile parties.
Private telephone exchanges and ser'
vices have been installed at Cooma
and regional centres to provide com-
munication with survey and other mo-
bile parties. Private telephone ex'
changes and services have been in'
stalled at Cooma and regional centres
and a teleprinter service links Cooma
with the Authority’s offices in Sydney
and Canberra.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
UPPER SNOWY RESOURCES.
In accordance with the Authority's
policy to execute its major works by
contract, tenders were advertised
throughout the world in February,
1951, closing on 21st May, 1951, for
the schemes first hydro'electric project
which has become known as the Guth'
ega project. Tenders were received
from Britain, Norway, Germany,
Italy and the United States of Amer
ica.
To reduce the drain on Australian
resources, the contract specification
stipulated that the contractor must pro'
vide from overseas sources all of his
own construction equipment, at least
90 per cent, of his staff and labour
requirements, and all material in short
supply. However, to assist the con'
tractor in making an early start on
his work, steps mere taken in advance
of the letting of the contract to pro'
cure electric and diesel locomotives,
compressors, tunnelling machinery and
some plant for surface work which
have since been made available to
the contractor.
In July, 1951, the tender of a Nor'
wegian Company, Ingenior F. Selmer
A/s was accepted for the Guthega Pro'
ject, and operations were commenced
by the contractor in the Spring of
that year. A separate contract has
been awarded to the English Electric
Co. Limited for the manufacture,
supply and delivery of two 30,000 kW
turbo generators valued at £500,000
which will be installed in the MlB
power station.
The contract covers the design and
construction of a concrete gravitv
section dam 100 feet high and 350
feet long on the Snowy River im'
mediately below its junction with the
Guthega River; a pressure tunnel 3t
miles long and approximately 19 feet
in diameter with an intake portal and
control works at the upstream end; a
surge tank at the downstream end of
the tunnel to incorporate a raceline
inlet thus providing for the raceline
to discharge directly into the surge
tank; a conduit from the downstream
end of the tunnel to the power station,
complete with necessary fittings to
serve two main turbines and an aux'
iliary power unit, with provision for
the future installation of a supply
line to a third turbine; a power house
to accommodate three 30,000 kW
Francis turbines and an auxiliary unit;
a tailrace and weir, and finally, ac'
cess roads and bridges to provide ac'
cess to the works when completed.
The following operation require'
ments were laid down:
(i) Spillway level at
Guthega Dam .. RL 5190
(ii) Min. operational
level in Guthega
pondage RL 5155
(iii) Min. tailwater
level at power
house (no dis'
charge) RL 4335
(iv) Min. tailwater
level at power
house with three
turbines discharg'
ing a total of
1750 cusecs RL 4341.5
(v) Normal max.
tailwater levt at
power ho u
with threi tu.
bines discharging
a total of 1750
cusecs RL
(vi) Max. discharg*
through each
turbine foi
purpose of re-
sign of civil
works (general'
ing 30MW per
turbine) 583 cusecs
(vii) Max. head loss
between Guth'
ega pondage and
the main valves
at the turbines
for simultaneous
discharge
through each
turbine of 583
cusecs 72 ft.
The Guthega dam will have a spill'
way, without flood gates, capable of
discharging flood flow of 25,000
cusecs with appropriate freeboard on
the remainder of the structure, and

(continued from previous page)
capable of discharging a flood flow
of 50,000 cusecs without overtopping
the dam. The reservoir outlets are
to be capable of passing not less than
600 cusecs down the Snowy River
with a water level in the reservoir at
or below the sill of the tunnel portal.
The spillway energy dissipator is to
be capable of handling discharges of
up to 50,000 cusecs and will be the
subject of model tests at the contract-
or’s headquarters in Norway.
The surge tank will provide for the
sudden and simultaneous rejection by
the power house of full load of
90,000 kW and will be designed to
receive a discharge from the raceline
of 200 cusecs.
To avoid possible delays in the
manufacture of the steel penstocks
the Authority placed orders on the
Continent for the supply of the steel
plate required before the contract was
awarded. This material is now com-
ing to hand in sufficient quantities to
enable a start to be made with the
manufacture of the penstocks and a
tender has now been accepted from
a large pipe manufacturing organisa-
tion in N.S.W. for the fabrication
of the pipes. The contract provides
for the work to be completed by Sep-
tember, 1953.
Good progress has been maintained
by the Guthega contractors as will be
seen from the accompanying photo-
graphs. Work on the upstream cof-
fer-dam is nearing completion and
progress on the diversion tunnel, de-
spite early checks due to unsound
rock, has been satisfactory. Excava-
tion for the dam itself has revealed
rather disappointing foundation con-
ditions and has necessitated additional
work before designs can be prepared.
Naturally occurring deposits of
concrete aggregate materials have also
been disappointing and have necessi-
tated a much more comprehensive trial
mix programme than was anticipated.
In this regard the Authority has been
able to assist the contractor by mak-
ing available laboratory facilities at
Island Bend.
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
COMMONWEALTH AND THE
U.S.A.
An agreement entered into between
the Commonwealth of Australia and
the United States of America on 16th
November, 1951, provided in part
that the Bureau of Reclamation of the
United States Department of the In-
terior is to give technical training in
the United States to selected Austra-
lian Engineers and will give technical
co-operation and assistance, as the
Bureau’s programme permits, in de-
sign and construction on various
works, as requested by the Common-
wealth Government.
Pursuant to this agreement the
Commonwealth requested that the
Bureau of Reclamation prepare de-
signs and technical portions of con-
tract specifications for certain features
of the Spiowy Mountains Hydro-Elec-
tric Authority developments. The
specific features involved in this re-
quest were; the Adaminaby-Tumut
tunnel, with appurtenant shafts, in-
take and control works; the Tumut
Pond dam, and the power tunnel from
Tumut Pond to, and including the
surge tank.
Under this agreement, not only
will the Authority gain the benefit
of the extensive experience of the
Bureau’s great organisation, but also
by handing over the design of a sec-
tion of the work, the Authority’s
staff will be able to put in hand other
work which otherwise could not have
been undertaken at this stage.
Following the ratification of the
above agreement, a Board of Bureau
of Reclamation technical advisors visit-
ed Australia in February, 1952, to dis-
cuss and review the Snowy Mountains
programme and the Eucumbene-
Tumut diversion proposals in partic-
ular.
The Bureau of Reclamation subse-
quently submitted a detailed report to
the Authority containing the follow'
ing recommendations which were lat'
eY adopted by the Authority as the
basis for the preparation of detailed
designs:
(a) The Adaminaby'Tumut Pond
and T 1 power tunnels are to
be concrete lined throughout.
(b) A shaft, whose capacity is to
be determined by the Author-
ity at an early date from
studies now in progress, is to
be provided above the main
tunnel at the junction of the
Tumut River and Happy
Jack’s Creek for the intake of
water.
(c) The Tumut Pond dam is to
be designed as a concrete arch
dam at the dam site furthest
downstream of four sites in-
vestigated by the Authority.
(d) An unlined construction adit
is to be provided at the Tumut
Pond end of the main tunnel
for access and to provide for
much disposal downstream of
the dam.
(e) The Tooma diversion works are
to be deferred for the time
being.
(f) A major programme of inves-
tigation into the suitability of
naturally occurring concrete ag-
gregates is to be undertaken
at high priority.
In anticipation of an early start on
the northern diversion proposals, con-
siderable developmental work had al-
ready been carried out by the Auth-
ority’s construction forces. Not only
were survey and geological investiga-
tions well advanced, but 50 diamond
drill borings had already been put
down to prove the suitability of the
main tunnel line and considerable ef-
fort had been devoted to opening up
access into the Tumut valley where
access has proved particularly difficult.
In addition, a regional centre has
been established at Tumut Pond where
barracks accommodation for over 300
staff and workmen has been provid-
ed. Office accommodation, plant
workshops and stores buildings have
also been erected.
The Authority has already com-
menced the driving of an exploratory
tunnel to the site of the Tl under-
ground power station. This tunnel
will be approximately 1,000 feet in
length and will have a cross section
of 8’ x B’, its location being such
that it will eventually become part of
the wash tunnel from Tl station.
The early completion of the explor-
atory tunnel is considered essential in
RUGGED EQUIPMENT.
Some of the equipment in use on the Snowy
Mountains project. (1) Bulldozers in opera-
tion on the access road to Guthega. (2) The
snowplough clearing the road at Spencer’s
Creek. (3) Diamond drilling operation at
the Jindabyne dam site.

order to provide basic information
which will enable designs of the Tl
proposals to be completed on time.
Work is also proceeding at high
priority on investigations into the
suitability of the locally occurring
concrete aggregates in this region. A
concrete research laboratory has been
established at Cooma and samples of
the more suitable materials from the
area stockpiled for laboratory experi'
mentation. Crusher and trial mix
experiments have already begun and
promising results obtained.
Present plans provide for the instah
lation and operation of the first gen'
erator in the Tl power station by
June of 1958 and for the third gen'
erator to be functioning by the fob
lowing year. The first two generators
will be put into operation before
the completion of the Adaminaby-
Tumut Pond tunnel. The fourth and
final generator for the Tl station
should be operating by December,
1959, and will be commissioned be'
fore the completion of the Adamim
aby dam.
To obtain the maximum benefit
from the Tumut River proposals
therefore, the Blowering dam should
be completed by 1958.
ASSISTANCE BY OTHER
GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENT-
ALITIES.
Because of the magnitude of the
undertaking and its national import'
ance, the Authority has availed itself
of the assistance offered by other
Government instrumentalities. The
design and construction of the Adam'
inaby dam is to be undertaken by the
Department of Public Works, N.S.W.,
and the Blowering dam by the N.S.W.
Water Conservation and Irrigation
Commission. In addition, consider'
able assistance is being given by the
Department of Main Roads, N.S.W.,
in undertaking the main road diver-
sions and other road work necessitated
by the Authority’s activities.
The Snowy River Shire, the For-
estry Commissions of N.S.W. and Vic-
toria, the Lands Department of
N.S.W., and other Commonwealth
and State bodies have also given vah
uable assistance, each in its own par-
ticular sphere.
CONCLUSION.
The Snowy Mountains scheme is
one which will provide Australia with
the two essentials needed most for its
future development; power and water.
Nature could have located these
resources more favourably—mid-way
between the load centres of Sydney
and Melbourne and at the headwaters
of the main irrigation rivers.
The scheme, construction of which
is now gaining momentum, is the
largest public work ever undertaken
in Australia, and is one of the world’s
largest hydroelectric developments.
In magnitude, it can be compared
with the great T.V.A. project of the
United States of America. It in'
volves the construction of 7 major
dams, over 85 miles of large diameter
tunnel, 17 power stations, and some
hundreds of miles of racelines along
the mountain ranges to intercept
streams and lead their waters to the
tunnels and storages.
The work is not just a long term
project. The first power will be pro'
duced in less than three years, and as
the work proceeds, project by pro'
ject, increasing quantities of water and
electricity will become available. The
ultimate development will provide a
generating capacity of approximate
3,000,000 kW which exceeds the total
capacity of all generating stations op-
erating in Australia today. It will
also supply over 2,000,000 acre feet
of water per annum for irrigation in
the Murray and Murrumbidgee vah
leys, a quantity almost five times the
present average annual water deliver'
ies to the whole of the Murrumbidgee
irrigation system.
Most developmental works are re'
garded as financially sound by virtue
of the indirect gain the community
derives from them. The Snowy
scheme differs. It is financially sound
on the score of electricity production
alone, even ignoring the fact that on
completion it will mean the conserva'
tion of over 4,000,000 tons of black
coal annually and will provide water
for irrigation free of cost to the states
of N.S.W. and Victoria.
The Technical Committee’s esti'
mate, prepared in July, 1949, of the
cost of the work, including transmis'
sion lines, was £225,000,000. The
Committee also estimated that the
cost of production of power, includ'
ing transmission, would be £9,400,000
per annum less than the cost of a
similar amount of power produced by
the most modern type of thermal sta-
tions.
The Technical Committee’s figures
must be regarded with reservation in
view of the increases which have taken
place since July, 1949, in salaries and
wages and in the cost of materials.
Any consequent adjustment to the
Committee's estimates, however, would
not alter the relative order of the cost
per annum of power production com'
pared with thermal generation.
To Australia, which has very low
total water resources compared with
some other countries, the potential re-
sources of the Snowy Mountains Area
are of the greatest importance for both
industrial and agricultural develop'
ment.
TOWBOAT FOR THE MISSISSIPPI.
The inland waterway system of the United
States comprising the Mississippi River and
its tributaries, some of which have been im-
proved by clamming and locking, continues to
offer economical transport. The “Aetria-
Louisville” is the latest design of river craft.
It is regularly engaged in pushing a train of
eight barges lashed two abreast on the Ohio
and Mississippi Rivers. These barges will
carry up to 25,500 tons of crude oil at maxi-
mum draught or more than many ocean-going
tankers, the round trip covering 3274 miles
in 20 days. The three stacks cover three
General Motors diesel engines each of 1600
b.h.p. at 750 r.p.m., and driving three 8ft.
diameter propellers through reduction gearing
at about 225 r.p.m. There are nine rudders
some being used for going astern. The high
superstructure serves the radar-equipped navi-
gation bridge, under which are quarters for
tourists as well as for officers and crew.

I.E.S. AWARD
FOR MERITORIOUS LIGHTING
INSTALLATION.
Winner Announced.
At the Annual Meeting, the winner
of the Award for Meritorious Lighting
Installation, which this Society inaugu'
rated during 1952, was announced.
The Award, which this year is for
installations in the Industrial field, is
intended to recognise and acknow'
ledge high quality of lighting design
in the solution of a particular seeing
problem.
The Award'winning installation for
1952 is an installation at the Meadow'
bank works of Telephone and Elec'
trical Industries Pty. Limited (see
illustrations on pages 43 and 44). The
seeing problem consisted of the ex'
amination of relays by various methods
including tension of contacts under
various currents impressed and adjust-
ing these contacts to operate accu-
rately.
The lighting solution offered com-
prised the entire field of view. At
the back of the critical task a suitably
coloured screen and canopy were
erected. The light of the room was
provided by large incandescent lamps
with deep bowl dispersive reflectors,
and in contrast hereto the actual task
was lighted by fluorescent tubes of a
character similar to daylight.
The management of Telephone
Electrical Industries was particularly
aware of the difficulty of the problem
and made every effort to find a satis-
factory solution. The design was
therefore carried out in close col-
laboration with all parties concerned:
namelv, Lighting Engineers of the
suppliers and manufacturers of the
eouipment in consultation with the
Lighting Advisory Bureau of the Syd-
ney County Council.

National Council.
The outstanding achievement of the
year was the completion of the sur'
veys in regard to Fellows and Mem'
bers and the subsequent authorisation
by National Council of the use of the
letters F.I.E.S. (Aust.) and M..1.E.5.
(Aust.). It is felt that the standing
of the Societies in Australia and their
qualified Members has been greatly
enhanced by this action. Appropriate
certificates to both grades have now
been issued. The National Council'
lors from N.S.W. were Messrs. D. C.
B. Maclurcan, H. G. Fallon and H.
A. Sopp, whilst the position of Hon.
General Secretary who is not a
National Councillor has been filled
by Mr. T. Crouch. The Society is
looking forward with pleasure to being
the hosts at the forthcoming meeting
of National Council to be held in
Sydney from 19th to 21st November
next.

There has been an overall increase
in membership during the year. A
comparison of membership (including
the Newcastle Chapter) in the various
grades at the beginning and the end
of the year shows the following:—
Newcastle Chapter.
Your Council again takes pleasure
in reporting on the increased activity
and widening prominence of the New-
castle Chapter during the year. There
was an overall increase of seven mem-
bers, bringing the membership to
three sustaining members, three full
members and twenty-three associate
It is with regret that your Council
again reports that a number of mem-
bers are in arrears in their subscrip-
tions. All members are urged to pay
their fees promptly and so lighten the
clerical work of the Society.
The thanks of the Society are again
due to all Sustaining Members—who
are listed below—for their continued
support, and particular reference is
made to special financial contributions
subsequently in this report.

Competitions.
The Competitions Committee or-
ganised an “I.E.S. Award for Meri-
torious Lighting Installations” during
this year, the subject being “Indus-
trial Lighting,” for which nine nomi-
nations were received. Council wishes
to thank members of the Jury who

nition of quality in design, will be-
come a permanent feature of this
Society’s activities and that increasing
numbers of lighting installations will
be subjects of the competition in fol-
lowing years
Official Journal and I.E.S.

from “Building and Engineering” to
“Building: Lighting; Engineering.”
Council desires to express its appre-
ciation to the Management of the
Journal for the sentiments shown by
this action and for their continuous
co-operation in publishing each month
a full report of the Society’s activities.

Review were received during 1952,
containing a large amount of topical
material from the five State Societies
and from overseas. Your Publications
Committee has contributed regularly
and a number of articles from N.S.W.
have appeared during the year. The
Committee has maintained through-
out the year a close liaison with the
Victorian editors of the Review and
some valuable matter from N.S.W. is
awaiting publication during the en-
suing year.
Public Relations
and Publicity.
Your Public Relations and Pub-
licity Committee can again review a
year of great activity. During the
year, the committeemen kept in con-
stant touch with the members of the
Society and undertook a great portion
of the w'ork in securing finance for the
Health Week Exhiibtion. It is also
due, in no small measure, to the
activities of this Committee that a
notable increase in the attendances at
our monthly meetings could be re-
corded during the year. The Com-
mittee contributed regularly to the
Society’s Newsheet, “Sidelights,” and
maintained liaison with the kindred
organisations and with the Sydney
Scientific Film Society. They also

kept in touch with the editors of trade
journals and supplied a number of
articles and topical information for
publication in the various journals of
the Electrical Trade and the Press.
During the year, Mr. H. G. Fallon
was guest speaker to the Certificated
Electricians’ Association of N.S.W.,
.his subject being “The Production
and Use of Light for Human Tasks.”
Health Week
Exhibition, 1952.
The Society accepted an invitation
by the Council of the City of Sydney
to stage an exhibit at the Health
Week Exhibition at the Sydney Town
Hall in October, 1952, and the Society
went before the public with an arrest'
ing and instructive display designed
around the slogan; “Better Light, Bet'
ter Sight, Better Health.”
Council wishes to thank whole'
heartedly the Society’s sustaining
members for the generous way in
which they made possible the finance
of this venture. Our thanks are also
due to Mr. S. Holman and his large
team of enthusiastic helpers who who
were primarily responsible for all
phases from the design and develop'
ment to the demonstration of the
equipment.
Membership and Social.
The Membership and Social Com'
mittee has been most active during
the year and has inaugurated many
new features in respect of the general
meetings. •
The establishment of the pre'
meeting dinner at Cahill’s restaurant
has been continued, and provides a
convenient rendezvous before the
monthly meetings. The innovation of
serving sherry before the meeting has
been appreciated both by members
and visitors.
The wearing by Councillors of an
identification disc at the monthly
meeting is now a permanent feature,
enabling visitors as well as members
to acquaint themselves with the office'
bearers.
Secretarial and Finance.
The Balance Sheet as at 30th Sep'
tember, 1952, and the Revenue Ac'
counts for the year ended at that date
are in the usual form.
Newcastle Chapter again shows a
surplus for the year amounting to
£l3/17/10, which, together with the
surplus of this Society, results in an
overall increase in accumulated funds
of £lB6/13/9, the reasons for which
are noted below.
The Revenue Accounts show An'
nual Subscriptions and Entrance Fees
at £lOlB, which represents an in'
crease of £309 over that of the pre-
vious year. This increase is primarily
due to the very generous financial
support given the Society by the Sus-
taining Members during the year in
their acceptance of the reviewed rates
of membership fees. The expenses for
the year, having regard to the fact
that no commitments in respect of
prizemoney were entailed, showed a
marked increase over those of the pre'
vious year. This increase is principal'
ly due to the rising trend of costs as
evidenced by the higher secretarial
and office expenses.
Papers.
The following papers were present'
ed to members and visitors during the
year:—

It should be noted that during the
year two of the Society’s General
Meetings were held in conjunction
with those of other professional bodies.
The Society was host to The Institute
of Optometrists of N.S.W. at the July
meeting and The Royal Australian
Institute of Architects, N.S.W. Chap'
ter, at the September meeting.
At the June meeting a large num'
ber of members of the Retail T/aders’
Association and the College of' Retail'
ing accepted the Society’s invitation
to be present.
Council feels that the exchange of
ideas with kindred organisations is an
integral part of the I.E.S. Activities
and expresses its thanks to the Fresh
dents of these two Institutes for their
cooperation in organising the meet'
ings.
During the year the Society was
invited to inspect the factories of
Crown Crystal Glass Pty. Limited, and
Electric Lamp Manufacturers (A/asia)
Ltd. Council wishes to thank the
managements of these two organisa'
tions for their invitations, which were
accepted by a large number of mem'
hers and their guests.

CONFERENCE OF NATIONAL COUNCIL
ILLUMINATING ENGINEERING SOCIETIES OF AUSTRALIA.
The 7th Conference of the National
Council of The Illuminating Em
gineering Societies of Australia was
held in Sydney this year from 19th to
21st November,
In the absence of the President,
Mr. D. C. B. Maclurcan (N.S.W.),
the chair was occupied by Mr. D. R.
Schumann (S.A.), who was elected
President for the ensuing year.
Delegates from all States attended.
The Conference covered a great
amount of ground; many subjects,
both technical and administrative,
were discussed, and plans laid for
future work of a national character.
The State Society had arranged for
a number of functions to welcome and
entertain its interstate visitors.
The National Councillors, on their
first day in Sydney, were received at
a Civic Reception at the Town Hall
by the Lord Mayor, Aid. E. C. O’Dea.
Later in the day, they were the guests
of the State President, Mr. E. L.
Freedman, at a dinner held at the
Millions Club; and during the even'
ing. a sightseeing coach took them on
a tour of “The Lights of Sydney,’’
with explanations and comment from
Mr. G, Y. Falk. A supper and floor'
show at one of the city’s nightclubs
rounded off a long day for the visitors.
The Annual General Meeting and
Buffet Dinner of the N.S.W. Society
on November 20th had been post'
poned this year to become part of the
social functions of the Conference.
The interstate delegates were warmly
welcomed by the incoming State
President, Mr. G. C. T. Brown, and
presented with a souvenir ashtray in'
scribed with the N.S.W.'I.E.S. Crest.
The buffet Dinner, with an attend'
ance of over 100 members and visitors,
was again, as in past years, the high'
light of the Society’s activities. It
gave members the opportunity to em
tertain the many friends of the
Society, the Presidents of the kindred
organisations, the editors of its jour'
nals, the guest speakers at last year’s
meetings, the winners of the Society’s
Award, and provided for the interstate
visitors a picture of activeness and
vitality which they only too readily
acknowledged.
The Conference closed on the 21st
November with a small ceremony in
which the President, Mr. D. R.
Schumann, thanked the N.S.W.
Society for the hospitality it had ex-
tended to its interstate visitors and
invited the National Councillors to
next year’s Conference in Adelaide in
his home State, South Australia.

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
By E. L. FREEDMAN, M.I.E.S.(Aust.),
Delivered at the Twenty-second Annual General Meeting of the Illuminating
Engineering Society of Australia (N.S.W.) on November 20, 1952.
“To me, as your President, the past
year has brought considerable joy and
great personal richness. I have rep-
resented you on numerous occasions
and have enjoyed many privileges of
standing and prestige. I have always
been conscious of the honour of this
high office of the Society and have at
all times endeavoured to justify the
confidence which you had placed in
me.
“Throughout the past year I have
received the most generous and loyal
support from all members of the
Society a‘nd, at the end of this year,
this is now my opportunity to express
my thanks to you.
“I wish to thank the outgoing office-
bearers and councillors for the amount
of time, thought and energy which
they have given to the administration
of the affairs of the Society; also the
many members who, on standing and
on special committees, have taken an
active part in the running of the
Society, and the Sustaining members
who were so generous with their con-
tributions of finance, goods and ser-
vices. I particularly wish to thank
the Secretary, Mr. M. R. F. (Reg.)
Vickery, whose personal counsel was
time and again invaluable to me and
who, together with a staff of efficient
and invariably helpful assistants, has
managed the secretarial affairs of the
Society with greatest competence.
“Last, by no means least, my thanks
are to you, the members of the
Society, for the support which you
have given us throughout the past
year. It was gratifying indeed to see
the considerable increase in the attend-
ances of our meetings; to find that, by
participating in the regular and extra-
regular functions of the Society, you
were endorsing our plans and policy
of administration; to see that one
single call from the chair was sufficient
to rally forty individual members to
sacrifice their time in the service of the
Society as attendants at the Health
Week Exhibition; for all this, and for
the honour and privileges of the past
year, I now say ’thank you’ to you all.
“You have read the Annual Report,
and will agree with me that again, as
in past years, progress has been noted
in the affairs of the Society. As your
retiring President, it is my privilege,
and pleasure, to review the past
year in somewhat greater detail, to
rationalise the events of the year, and
to endeavour to bring these into per-
spective with those of years gone by
and years to come.
A Year of Change.
“If, however, we asked ourselves
which was the most significant event
of the year we would not find the
answer in the Annual Report. It is
that, during the past year, we have
witnessed the profoundest change in
the whole of the Australian economy,
and with it, in the foundations of our
private lives and of our professional
activities.
“A year ago, the post-war boom
had reached its highest peak; money
was plentiful: labour and materials
were scarce; those who had something
to offer—be it their goods or their
services—held back for an even higher
price; a seller’s market; the economic
law of supply and demand had proved
and excelled itself. In this scene,
our own profession could not help but
be buoyant and prosperous; lighting
equipment of all kind was at a pre-
mium,- and the services of the quali-
fied Illuminating Engineer were re-
quired everywhere.
“Compare this situation with to-day:
a buyer’s market; money is short and
our stores are crowded: building activi-
ties in industry and commerce are
nearly at a standstill, and private and
governmental home building and plan-
ning is reduced to a bare minimum.
“What does this mean to us Light-
ing Engineers? We must face this
question squarely, because, whether
we deplore this development or re-
cognise its necessity and hope for
ultimately future benefits, each one of
us will have to re-organise his own
thoughts and activities in accordance
with the new economic conditions.
“During this turning period of our
economic world, the I.E.S. has again
proved and confirmed its position of
leadership in the lighting profession
and lighting industry.
Membership Certificates
Issued.
“However, it is interesting to note
that the most significant achievement
of the year took place not on a tech-
nical but on a general plane: after
years of preparation, National Coun-
cil gave authority, and the State
Societies issued Membership Certifi-
cates to the Corporate Members of
our Societies, thus giving outward
recognition to the qualified Illuminat-
ing Engineers of this country.
“But let us not commit the fallacy,
which I have frequently heard ex-
pounded during the year, that all these
Illuminating Engineers should be of a
sameness of professional training,
knowledge, and experience. Just as
behind the title of Doctor we expect
to find General Practitioners and
Specialists in many fields, all members
of their professional organisation, the
B.M.A.—so does membership of The
Illuminating Engineering Society of
Australia include men of widely dif-
ferent experience and calling.
“There are the Ophthalmologists
who state the problems of Light and
Sight; and the Physicists who set the
Standards and test the Equipment: the
Industrial Designers who co-ordinate
Purpose and Form, and the Manufac-
turers of Sources and Fixtures. There
are the Illuminating Engineers who
direct and control the Radiation of
Light, and the Architects who deal
with the problems of Room and Space
Integration. There are the Electrical
Engineers who concern themselves

with Installation and Maintenance,
and the Interior Decorators who use
Light and Colours and Textures to
create the atmosphere they aspire.
“All these and many allied talents
and vocations can be found behind
these letters of F.I.E.S. and M.1.E.5.;
they make up the membership of the
Society like the sectors of a circle
radiating from a centre reading I.E.S.
Recognition
and Responsibility.
“But, when we received outward
recognition, we had to accept also
outward responsibilities. In no sphere
of our lives, on no plane of our
standing, at no time of our develop'
ment, can we afford waste. If we
want to avoid waste, if we are to work
‘towards the advancement of the art
and science of illumination,’ then we
must assume responsibility in all
fields of our actiivties.
“(1) We must see that the Light'
ing Industry, of which we are part,
produces and offers only the best
quality of lighting materials of all
kind.
“(2) We must see that the Light'
ing Profession, which we represent,
employs these in only the best quality
of Lighting application techniques of
all kind.
“(3) But we must also see that the
community is made aware of the need
for quality of lighting materials and
lighting techniques.
“(4) And lastly, we must see that
quality of materials and design are
recognised and acknowledged in the
community.
“The first two could be termed the
individual or personal responsibilities
of I.E.S. membership. They include
the problems with which we are deal'
ing mainly during the discharge of
our professional duties in the commer'
cial field, and the Society’s task is to
instruct and to guide its members
through lectures and papers, classes
and demonstrations, and factory or
laboratory visits.
“The second two responsibilities are
those which transcend our individual
professional work and which are
being shouldered by the Society as a
whole. They include problems of
education and leadership, and could
be termed our civic duties which we
discharge through membership and as
members of our Societies.
“It is indeed gratifying to record
that, in all four fields, this Society has
creditably discharged its obligations
during the past year.

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


“A considerable amount of the
Society’s thoughts were directed to-
wards the problems of quality of light
sources and of lighting equipment.
As the year moved on it became
more and more apparent, and it was
interesting to note the vast gulf which
seems to exist in the degree of per-
fection reached in these two so closely
related fields, that of light source de-
velopment and that of lighting fixture
design.
Future of the Incandescent
Lamp.
“At our first meeting of the year
in March we heard Dr. Dresler discuss
the future of the incandescent lamp,
and at the August meeting of our
Newcastle Chapter he reported on the
development and future of the fluores-
cent lamp. If there is one conclusion
which seems unavoidable after hearing
Dr. Dresler, and later in the year,
after visiting the E.L.M.A. factory at
Newcastle, it is that the progress which
can be expected in the development
of these two sources will be of detail
rather than of principle. There seems
little doubt that the curve of progress
and improvement of performances and
efficiencies of the sources of to'day is
flattening out at the top.
“Compare this situation with the
position with regard to fixture design.
Let me remind you of the remarks of
Mr. W, H. Brown when moving the
vote of thanks to Mr. Aubrey Forbes
and his team of Lighting Engineers at
the end of the June meeting dealing
with ‘Lighting the Retail Store.’ ‘We
storemen,’ he said, ‘would quickly im-
prove our lighting systems if you, the
lighting men, would supply us with
acceptable lighting fixtures of pleasant
design.’
“This matter of fixture design has
been with us throughout the past year.
It was discussed at the September
meeting by Mr. Walter Running un-
der the heading ‘Dramatic Changes of
Store Design,’ and by Messsrs. Stan
Jeffery, Alan Smith and Paul
Grundfest at the August meeting deaL
ing with ‘Lighting Progress Abroad.’
It was aired extensively at our Open
Night in November when Messrs.
Harry Seidler and John Knight led
the discussion, and it was dealt with
by a number of original articles in the
T.E.S. Lighting Review’ and in
‘Building: Lighting: Engineering.’
When we visited the works of the
Crown Crystal Glass Company and
saw how much skill went into the
making of lighting glassware, we
could not help but wonder why,
during the past years, the progress in
the design of lighting fixtures had
fallen so far behind the development
of the light sources which they em-
ploy.
Need for Progress
in Fixture Design.
“I personally think that our two
problems, the high standard of source
development and the immense need
for further progress in fixture design,
will gradually resolve themselves into
one. It seems illogical and wasteful
to me that we should persevere to
produce light sources from which we
wrestle the last lumen per watt, only
to enclose these near'perfect sources
in fixtures of all kind of nondescript
performances.
“We developed already, and we use
constantly, mirror - backed reflector
spots and reflector floods, indirect
lamps and a host of other combination
source-fixtures for specialised lighting
tasks. If their initial costs are often
considerably higher than the costs of
conventional equipment of the same
wattage, to use my own favourite ter-
minology: their higher economic
efficiencies make them compare favour-
ably with the conventional equipment.
“On similar terms we might one
day produce fluorescent tubes of lower
current densities and therefore lower
surface brightness which we need not
diffuse again - and hide behind costly
and unmanageable pieces of glassware

or louvres, but which can be made an
integral part of the fixture design. In
the incandescent field, too, the still
new silica ' coated, inside ' white lamp
might one day be produced with
larger and pleasantly'shaped bulbs for
small wattages —de luxe lamps, if you
wish, for use in a great number of
commercial and domestic lighting
situations.
“It is always difficult and hazardous
to interpret trends, but I feel that we
will gradually witness some amalgama'
tion of source and fixture design; and
give a new lease of life to the now
rightly'despised bare lamp.
“As was to be expected, when we
talked of sources and fixtures, we dis'
cussed also their application: installa'
tion design and the problems of the
utilisation of light were before us
almost every time we met. Two oc'
casions, however, seem to stand out in
my mind.
Lighting Research.
“At our May meeting, Mr. Ralph
Phillips gave a most instructive report
on the ‘Lighting Research at the
Commonwealth Experimental Building
Station at North Ryde’; and it is
pleasing to think that it was at a meet'
ing of the 1.E.5., which only too rare'
ly concerns itself with the problems of
daylight, that justice was done to the
excellent work which the events of the
last year have unfortunately interrupt'
ed, if not altogether ended.
“Then, at our July meeting, we
heard a most provocative paper from
Mr. Joe Lederer on ‘Visual Per'
formance.’
“For some time now we have been
going through a rather difficult phase
of application engineering: we are
gradually passing from non' dimen'
sional (Point source) design, through
one'dimensional (tubular) and two'
dimensional (luminous surface) de'
sign, into a stage of three'dimensional
designing whereby we include the
whole cube of our field of vision into
the sphere of our interest, and we
might conclude that our concepts of
Illuminating Engineering and of
Brightness Engineering might one
day become parts of a larger concept
of Vision Engineering in which ef'
ficiencies will not only be quoted in
terms of Lumens per Watt but also,
and more significantly, in terms of
Sight and Light.
“As Vision Engineers we will urn
derstand why the Illumination Em
gineer is but one in the Society’s team
of men and professions, and we will
realise that not greater specialisation
is the call of the day, but greater
universalisation; not still more techni'
cal detail information, but greater
humane understanding, greater wis'
dom.
“Wisdom and understanding will
have to stand us to good stead in the
pursuit of our educational work, if we
want to raise the standard of lighting
conditions in the community and re'
ceive recognition for quality of light'
ing design.
The I.E.S. Award for Meritorious
Lighting Installations, which we
originated this year, is primarily de'
signed to acknowledge quality of light'
ing design. I sincerely hope that the
Award will become a permanent in'
stitution of the Society and that it
will ultimately fulfil an even greater
purpose to provide a stimulus for
quality of design in the earliest de'
sign stages, thus raising the general
standard of lighting design to the
benefit of the whole community.
Health Week
Exhibition.
“The Society’s effort in bringing
before the people the need for Better
Light and Better Sight, the Health
Week Exhibition and our appeal to
the people of this State are still fresh
in all our minds. It is to be hoped
that our plans for the future will be
realised, that this exhibit with its
flexibility of adaption and purpose,
representing so much of our know'
ledge and experience, will be used
many times again to tell the story of
‘Better Light, Better Sight, Better
Health.’
“The interest which our stand has
created at the Town Hall, the many
questions which have been asked from
our men during the week and from
people from all walks of life prompts
me again to ask:
“Where are the Lighting Engineers
in the showrooms of our city stores?
Where are the Lady Investigators of
this country whose sisters are doing
such great work as researchers and
advisers overseas?
“Our lighting men seem to find it
quite in order to submit plans and
specifications for the lighting of a
small executive office in the city or of
a suburban car park or milk bar.
Why, then, do they persist in passing
by the homes of their fellow'men?
Are they less deserving of the
specialised knowledge and experience
which is ours? Surely not; and I feel
that the days are not far when our
large city retailers will join the ranks
of our Sustaining Members, when we
will see the certificates of our Em
gineers displayed on the walls of the
city showrooms, and when the public
will seek and receive valid advice on
the seeing problems of the home
where, before pretty fixtures had been
bought and sold, on appearance only,
and without aim or purpose.
“It is from this direction that I
expect the most significant develop'
ments to come, developments which
in importance and magnitude can
match and counteract the impact of
that economic transformation which
we have seen taking place during the
year.
“As long as we have mainly to rely
on new buildings or renovations of
old buildings to provide us with an

outlook for the future could become
rather grim indeed. But, ask your'
selves: how many of all the seeing
tasks performed by the people of this
community, at home or at work, how
many are performed under adequate
lighting conditions? 100%?, 10%?,
or even less? Here lies our oppor'
tunity. In a field which has been
ours all the time but which we
neglected because of the scope of the
new work offering in those years of
expansion and prosperity.
Let Us Keep
The Initiative.
“Let us then keep the initiative;
let us create the demand from the
principles of our own science; let us
face our problems and our respom
sibilities; let us work and act accord'
mg to our Code and our Society
will continue to prosper and, with it,
will the resources of our Industry and
the skill of our professional men be
valued highly for years to come.
“There could be no better guardian
of the future of the Society than
your new President, Mr. George
Brown. There are two qualities for
which I like and admire men; they
are loyalty and enthusiasm; and dur'
ing the many years of service to this
Society George Brown has convincing'
ly displayed both. As Councillor and
Committeeman, as a friend to whom
we have gone with our bigger and
lesser problems and who has never
denied himself to us, George Brown
has shown us this untiring energy and
enthusiasm for which we all respect
him so much.”
The Late
Mr. G. G. J. Richard
The many friends of Mr. George
Richard in the engineering world,
learned with regret of his death on
December 2, from heart failure, at his
Killara home, after a short illness.
His demise removed the last mem'
her of the old Board of Directors,
who for very many years controlled
the destinies of Chubb’s Australian
Co. Ltd.
Predeceased last year by his brother
Albert, they originally traded in
Newtown as Art Metalworkers, and
became incorporated with Chubb’s
when the latter firm founded its Wat'
erloo works in 1921.
Mr. Richards is survived by his
widow and four sons, the eldest of
whom, Rob, is the present Managing
Director of Chubb’s.

Fabulous
New York
GREAT VIRILITY, IMMENSE ACTIVITY,
TEEMING MILLIONS.
Statistics can be appallingly boring:
they can also be fascinating and illu-
minating. Some on New York cer-
tainly come within the latter category.
Here are a few:—
Population (December, 1951),
7,960,000; 237,000 business establish-
ments, including 42,000 manufacturing
plants in operation in five boroughs in
1951 and employment given to
3.200.000, who receive a payroll of
12.000. dollars a year. Gross
value of 1951 industrial output,
14.000. dollars. City's leading in-
dustry: manufacture of clothes: annual
production, 4,000,000,000 dollars. In
522 efficiently - staffed hotels salaries
and wages average 8000 dollars a
year, and the hotels spend 43,000,000
dollars on wages alone.
Fires: Everything in a big way.
Loss in April, 1952, 51,000,000 dol-
lars: Total for year, 676,000,000 dol-
lars. There are 10,000 firemen to
cope with fires, which occur every 20
minutes —1,700 false alarms.
There are 36,000 school teachers
in New York.
St. John the Divine Cathedral has
seating for 15,000 and standing room
for 40,000.
Public Library is visited by 4,000,000
persons a year or 11,000 daily.
There are 12 picture theatres in one
short street that stay open till 4 a.m.
There are 2,768,587 telephones and
83 different languages are spoken.
New York Mayor’s Committee of
Mana g e m ent is asking for
$5,000,000,000 to improve transporta-
tion to meet traffic conditions.
SKYSCRAPER GRACE AND BEAUTY.
The slender east facade of the R.C.A. Building shimmers in flood-
light. To completely floodlight a building of this great height is
surely an outstanding achievement.
THE “EL” HAS GONE.
The antiquated structure of the Sixth Avenue “El” (elevated rail-
way) made an eccentric framework for the soaring skyscrapers.
The elevated has gone and Sixth Avenue is now the Avenue of
the Americas.

What Can Be Done
Two Houses Built in 46 j Hours.
Working for an incentive bonus, 22
men built two three'bedroom houses
in 46j hours for Belper Council, near
Derby, England, at a cost of £l4OO
each. The houses are of brick, and
five days from the time the founda*
tions were laid they were ready for
papering.
In 1935, fifty Aberdeen (Scotland)
workmen completed two
semi' detached houses, which were
ready for permanent residence in 50
hours. They were of brick, finished
with rough'cast cement, and each cost
£420, which gives some idea of pre'
war prices.
To do jobs like this, there must be
some incentive. In Belgium there is
an ancient law which stipulates that
if a man could build a house in a
single night so that it was habitable
and the chimney smoking in the morn'
ing, he could own it and 25 acres as
well. Such a house now stands in the
town of Vollezeele.
CHRISTMAS IN “THE CHANNEL”.
The area leading from Fifth Avenue to the Rockefeller Plaza is known as “The Channel”, and
every Christmas its gardens are decorated in some appropriate manner. On this occasion the
Yuletide spirit is engendered by golden organ pipes. At the end of the vista, on the Plaza,
is the huge illuminated pine tree that is an annual feature.
THE NATIONAL BROADCASTING STUDIOS.
Nation-wide “hook-ups” are directed from the master control room (top left) at N.B.C. Visitors to the N.B.C. Studios have a memorable
experience behind the scenes of both broadcasting and television when being conducted over the huge building; starting point is in this
modern hall. Unusual shapes are a feature of the various studios (bottom left) consists of a dramatic row of metallic cylinders which absorb
sound reverberations; (bottom right) the wall surfaces are broken up with a series of “warts to prevent the sound from "bouncing" around
the room.

AUSTRALIA’S PRESENT FINANCIAL ENTANGLEMENTS
A BANKER VIEWS THE SITUATION WITH CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN THE FUTURE.
Address by Mr. C. R. McKerihan to the Royal Empire Society.
“There has been much confusion
about the financial situation in the
minds of the public of late. In the
last six months we have all suffered
the strain, and any ordinary citizen
would be justifiably entitled to ask
where we were heading and what we
were possibly in for,” said Mr. Roy
McKerihan in a luncheon address be-
fore The Royal Empire Society on
28th November last.
Mr. C. R. McKerihan is the Presi-
dent of the Rural Bank and there-
fore speaks with much authority on
rural production, which has ever been
regarded as the backbone of Australia,
as well as on financial matters.
“As I was abroad last year,” said
Mr. McKerihan, “it enabled me to see
the picture from two angles. England
was all out on an export drive. In
the latter half of last year, America
and Canada started to close down on
English imports. England, being de-
sirous of continuing her export drive,
naturally looked through her order
book to see what outstanding orders
she had. Australian importers had
ordered goods, but in the ordinary
course it would have taken several
years for their orders to have been
fulfilled. This was, up to that stage,
the ordinary expectation, but England
fulfilled these orders to Australia in
the one year, which was both unex-
pected and unprecedented. It meant
that we had an avalanche of goods and
had to pay for imports approximating
£400,000,000 more than was antici-
pated. In the same year, the Federal
Government had imposed virtually
double taxation on the primary pro-
ducers, they being called upon to pay
a provisional tax to bring them up-to-
date with taxation as well as ordinary
tax. This coming in the same year
as the unprecedented supply of goods
naturally strained our financial re-
sources. Banks and all concerned won-
dered how we would weather the
storm.
“A review indicated that every year
since the war we have had a favour-
able trade balance. This contrasted
with pre-war years when, for example,
we had an adverse trade balance of
£25,000,000 m 1938-39. Our favour-
able trade balances since the war en-
abled us to build up credits in London
until in June of last year our sterling
credit balance amounted to the colos-
sal sum of £843,000,000. This, of
course, was a wonderful reserve, but
the query in the minds of all was:
‘Will it be sufficient to tide us over
this peculiar year?’
“Well, as we now survey the situa-
tion we find that it not only tided us
over but we still to-day have a favour-
able credit balance in London of ap-
proximately £400,000,000. What a
wonderful situation in which to find
ourselves! How fortunate were we to
have such valuable reserves that we
were able to pay for goods in the one
year amounting to £400,000,000 more
than we anticipated and in the same
year to meet unprecedented demands
for taxation payments made by the
primary producers. The last six
months was therefore a very difficult
period.
“However, having weathered the
storm, we can now ask ourselves:
‘What of the future?’ Well, anyone
practised in finance knows that there
is practically no in-flow of capital into
Australia between the months of May
and September. All income flows in
between October and April. We
therefore have entered a fresh year
commencing on the Ist July with a
reserve of £400,000,000 in sterling
balance in London and the prospect
of a wonderful export year due, prin-
cipally, owing to the fact that this has
been one of the best climatic years
from the point of production we could
experience.
“I therefore have no hesitation in
saying that we are going to have a
very big favourable trade balance this
year. Our exports are undeniably
going to be the second highest on
record and our imports are going to
be particularly low, because of the
enormous influx last year. For the first
four months of last year we had an
adverse trade balance of £167,000,000.
For the first four months of this year
we had a favourable trade balance of
£63,000,000. In other words we are,
at the end of last month, £230,000,000
better off when compared to the same
date twelve months ago. Wool is our
chief export item. Our wool is better
in quality this year than last year. It
is much greater in quantity and the
price being obtained is higher. The
avefage price of wool in June last was
72d. It is now 78d.—a very payable
price. Our export of mutton and
lamb this year will show an enormous
increase over last year. At the pre-
sent time we have 118,000,000 sheep.
That is about our total carrying capa-
city. Through the drought years of
1944, 1945 and 1946 we reduced our
sheep population to 96,000,000. Since
then we have been able to build it up
until at the present time we have now
reached full carrying capacity. We
therefore have arrived at the stage
where producers must cull their stock
and sell their surplus sheep as well as
their lambs. They cannot wisely carry
any more sheep and this must neces-
sarily be their normal function. We,
therefore, for the first time since the
war have arrived at the situation
where we have mutton and lamb for
sale.
“Our dairying figures this year show
a phenomenal increase. It is a little
too early to finally determine the posi-
tion respecting wheat but at least
there is no indication of a decline in
the total wheat yield. In this regard,
it is interesting to note that the com'
munity at large feels that our wheat
production has gone down, judged on
pre-war standards. This is not so.
Our average wheat production for 5
year sending 1939 was 154,000,000
bushels per annum. The average pro-
duction for the five years ended June
last was 194,000,000 bushels, an in-
crease of 40,000,000 bushels per an-
num. This is entirely contrary to the
impression created regarding a decrease
in wheat production. Though our acre-
age of wheat has constantly decreased
our production has increased. This
has been due to changed methods.

Like any new building the modern hospital is a
functional structure that is designed to meet to-day’s
need for a complete efficient medical service. One of
the most important factors that promote the effective
use of essential medical facilities is the lift service,
and it is significant that in almost every post-war
hospital the lifts have been by Otis. In Melbourne’s
Alfred Hospital there are a total of eight Otis Lifts
located in the various wings of the hospital.

(continued from page 51)
wheat districts were growing wheat
only, prior to the war. Now they are
growing wheat and running sheep.
We have many instances of farmers,
who were sowing say, e.g., 1,000 acres
of wheat and who are now content to
sow 300 acres of wheat and run 1,000
sheep and are getting a greater finan'
dal return from this method of farm'
ing than they would by producing
wheat alone. Is there any reason why
we should complain about this? Does
it matter to us whether the farmer
gets his maximum production from
wheat and wool, as against wheat only,
so long as we are producing sufficient
wheat for our own requirements and
still leaving ourselves a goodly sur'
plus for export.
“Our production of cheese is just
about 100% more than in pre'war
years. Our production of processed
milk is 24% greater; barley is 110%
greater; oats is 70% greater; sorg'
ham is 440% greater; rice 43% great'
er and potatoes 36% more. Our tot'
al meat production is 7% greater. Our
production of wool is 9% greater and
so I could go on, giving figures of
this type but these will indicate that
we have not been standing still.
“However, I prefer to direct my re'
marks more on the general financial
aspect and, in this regard, I point out
that I feel our financial standing gen'
erally is much better than in pre'war
years. For example, we went off the
gold standard in 1931 and we went
on to sterling as the basis for our cur'
rency. Up to the outbreak of war,
we never held at any stage more than
£56,000,000 in sterling balance, as the
base for our currency. In June of
last year, as previously stated, we were
up to £843,000,000 and today even
after traversing this most difficult
year, we still have £400,000,000. Our
note issue is therefore well covered.
It is unfortunate that Australia has
used the term ’inflation’ which has
created a wrong impression in the
minds of the outer world, so much so
that last year when travelling abroad,
whenever it became known that I was
an Australian, folk would remark:—
‘Oh, that is where you have a housing
shortage or ‘That is where you have
inflation’. Now my comparison with
the outer world, we had neither a
housing shortage nor inflation. The
outer world regarded inflation as the
printing of notes for which you have
no basic security, or in having credit
in the community without sufficient
goods for purchase.
“We have ample security, and by
the influx of goods no one could sug'
gest that we are suffering from a
shortage of goods. The only other
aspect to be examined is as to whether
there is sufficient credit in the com'
munity. In this connection, if we
take notes held by the public, the
credit accounts in the Savings Banks
and the credit accounts in the trad'
ing banks, we find that at 30th June
last the people had available to them
from these three sources over
£1,900,000,000 more than they had
in 1939. That is, the members of the
community could tomorrow draw out
of their accounts and keep in their
pockets over £1,900,000,000 more
than they had in 1939. Taking these
three particular aspects into account,
we must correctly conclude that we
are not suffering from inflation, as in'
flation is generally known in the
financial world.
“We then could survey the banking
situation, which illustrates to us* that
the 10 years ending 1939, the banks
advanced 88% of their deposits, thus
maintaining a reserve of 12%. On
the 30th June last, the banks had ad'
vanced only 62% of their deposits,
thus maintaining a reserve of 38%. A
fair proportion of this, however, was
retained by the Commonwealth Bank
in the Special Deposits Accounts.
This position, however, is being
changed, as the trading banks are now
not being restricted in their method
of advancing and there seems to be
every indication that, as required,
these deposits will be made available
to them for lending in the commun'
iLy.
“If, before the war, therefore, we
were satisfied with a sterling reserve
of a maximum of £56,000,000 to cover
our note issue and we now have
£400,000,000 and if we were satisfied
with a margin of 12% of our bank
deposits, should we not be very happy
with the overall general financial posh
tion, when we know today that we
have a margin of over 30%.
“I have been very interested in
taking out the statistics of Australia
by decades and I find that in every
decade, we have increased in produc-
tion and population. These statistics
indicate that we had a depression in
1840, another in 1893 and again in
1930, and under the law of averages,
we should not have another before
1970. However, if we do encounter
one, our financial structures could
now deal with it, whereas we were
unfitted to do so in 1930. Practh
cally all countries of the world have
set up central banks to control the
total volume of credit and should
there be real signs of a depression,
the structures now available would
cope with the position and we would
not have the disastrous effects experi'
enced in 1930.
“Despite the three depressions I
mentioned, on investigation we find
that we have improved our position
both in population and production in
every decade since statistics have
been kept. Thus, for example, in
1850 our position was considerably
better than 1840 in spite of the de*
pression in that decade. Similarly, in
1900 we were much better off than
1890 in spite of the 1893 depression.
1920 was much better than 1910, 1930
better than 1920 and despite the de-
pression of the 1930’5, 1940 was
better than 1930. Notwithstanding
World War 11., 1950 was better than
1940 and I have no doubt that 1960
will reveal a continuation of this spiral

STRIKING BRAZILIAN HOTEL PROJECT.
Building activity in South America has been remarkable in the post-war years and their design
is at once unusual and exciting. This project, upon which the Brazilian architect, Oscar Niem-
eyer, and the American architects, Holabird & Root & Burger, appear to be collaborating, is to
be executed for Pan American Hotels. Entire walls of glass would take a terrific amount of
cleaning and would be difficult to live behind, if they were transparent. A feature is the raising
of all the units on stilts so that the whole ground floor area is open. Photographing the
models against the existing city background is cleverly carried out.

and show better figures in population
and production than was the case in
1950.
“Taking a long range view, there'
fore, one concludes that in the words
of the text ‘the things we worry about
most never happen’. No one will
deny that our population by 1960
will be greater than at present; in
fact, it has been estimated that our
minimum population will then be 10J
million and I have no doubt that our
production by then will be infinitely
greater than it was in 1950.
Finally let me say that I see one
major weakness only in Australia and
that is the lack of provision for water
conservation. When we overcome
that, there is no reason why we should
not carry an enormous population in
this country. It is not that we are a
low'rainfall country. The rainfall of
Sydney, for example, is more than
twice the rainfall of Paris, London
or Berlin and two and a half times
more than the rainfall of Moscow.
If we want to get the low rainfall
of London, we must go at least 250
miles inland. If we take Southern
California, for example, we find that
it grows more per acre than possibly
any other white man country in the
world, yet we would need to go as far
inland as Bourke to get as low a rain'
fall as Southern California. The fact
is that that country and other com'
parable countries have harnessed the
water that falls and they have spent
more on one dam than we spent in the
whole of our history of water conser'
vation. I think it is a shame, in the
midst of the enormous prosperity of
this country, to retard in any way the
programme for the harnessing of our
water resources. When we have ca»
ried out these programmes and har'
nessed our resources, the possibilities
for production will be enormous and
we will be insuring ourselves against
dry times which periodically come to
us. Let me just, by way of illustra'
tion, say this. We have no dead heart
in N.S.W. The further west you go,
the better the soil in this State. We
have a wonderful river in the Dari'
ing without one lock in it. Into
N.S.W. you could put England, Ire'
land, Scotland, Norway, Holland, Beh
gium and Denmark and you would
still have 27,000 square miles over.
Those countries have populations of
over 80,000,000 and we have
3,000,000. Let us visualise the time
when we will have in this State alone,
at least 20,000,000 and from a point
of view of production and resources,
there is no reason why we could not
carry such a population and I feel
that it will come eventually when we
have overcome that chief weakness of
lack of water conservation.
“I have given you a summary of
our financial position, which indicates
that our basic structure is positively
sound. However, one ingredient is
essential for prosperity and that is
confidence. It is useless having the
huge credits available to the people
in their accounts if they lack confi'
dence. If these balances remain stag'
nant, the community suffers because
people refrain from drawing from
their accounts to carry out what would
be a normal requirement and, in con'
sequence, all business suffers. Every
time a business transaction is effected
by the drawing out of money from an
account, it probably makes a chain
affecting six or seven others which
each, in turn, benefit before the money
finds itself back into the banking
structure. I therefore suggest that
you can all help in creating prosperity
in this country by promulgating the
ideal of confidence and a faith in our
future.”
GOODWIN “QUADS" MAKE
DEBUT.
At a Christening Party held at the
Coronet, George St., last Wednesday
evening, A. E. Goodwin Sales Co.
presented their new “Quads” to a
large gathering of clients and friends.
The Quads, lined up on the stage,
turned out to be four additions to the
lengthy list of Goodwin products
already enjoying popularity on the
Australian market.
They are the Firemaster, Mantelator,
New Wonderheat, and a new type
Incinerator.
Following the introduction of these
new products, guests were entertained
by the management of the company
to buffet refreshments.
THE TRACK OF TRIBULATION
Per Circular Quay!
The overhead railway at Circular
Quay has suffered yet another relapse,
and work has ceased for the umpteenth
time since the first tunnel was com'
pleted and was proudly decorated with
the digits 1918.
This time in the centre there are
several bays of the heavy concrete
work, that is to carry the super'
imposed railway and the super-super-
imposed roadway, completed.
One bay has been stripped of the
forest of beautifully'executed Oregon
formwork that looked massive
enough to support the Great Pyramid
or the Empire State Building and
ferry travellers to Mosman, Cremorne
and Neutral Bay have the privilege of
walking beneath this gaunt and silent
skeleton to their wharf beyond instead
of having to make a wide detour,
which was often just enough to miss
the boat.
Such official thoughtfulness augurs
ill for the future, for it would seem
to indicate a lengthy cessation of aC'
tivity; fluorescent lights are also being
installed.
Venice has its Bridge of Sighs,
Jerusalem its Wailing Wall, Paris its
Arc de Triomphe, but Sydney has its

Britain will not be able to profiteer
by selling quickly at an inflated price,
according to conditions recently laid
down by Mr. Macmillan, Housing
Minister.
Any buyer wishing to re-sell with'
in five years must first offer the house
back to the Council concerned at the
price he paid for it.
(Houses concerned have been erect'
ed by local Councils under various
building schemes, but there is no com'
pulsion for them to sell.)
A council can sell a house built
before May 8, 1945, for not less than
twenty times the annual rent exclusive
of rates. A house built after that
must be sold at the price it cost to
build.
On this basis, the tenant of a 10/'
a week pre'l94s house could, if his
Council were willing, buy his house
for £520.

Aesthetic Considerations in the Design of Structures
By Professor F. E. A. TOWNDROW,* F.R.I.B.A., F.R.A.I.A., F.T.C.P.I.
Paper delivered before the Australian dC New Zealand Association for the
Advancement of Science on 22nd August, 1952, at the Peter Nicol Russell
School of Engineering, University of Sydney.
1. —THE DANGERS
OF SPECIALISATION.
In the production of buildings and
similar structures we have made cer'
tain divisions in the diverse labours
involved. We have apportioned re'
sponsibilities and functions as between
persons whom we have labelled archi'
tects, builders, civil engineers and
several others. This division of work
within the functional whole, has be'
come an unfortunate necessity, not a
virtue. There was a time when these
varied activities were all encompassed
within an individual who was architect,
builder, civil engineer and more be'
sides, as were Leonardo da Vinci, Sir
Christopher Wren, San Micheli, Henri
Labrouste, and the builders of the
finest structures yet known to man—
the great Gothic cathedrals.
In the 19th Century, specialisation
became compartmentalism —which is a
very different thing, and, with the
emergence of the separate profes-
sionalised types, the foolish notion
arose almost unconsciously that the
different professions were serving dif'
ferent ends. Architects were not in
fact content with being just architects
—one of a team —they had to have a
special cult called Architecture —as dis'
tinct from building—to go with it.
Builders formed a separate camp of
their own with a strong commercial
bias, and forgot how to build beautiful'
ly or intelligently (as they did up to
the end of the 18th Century). And
so it came about that in the family of
fine building the son with sensibility
and imagination went off and called
himself an architect (a calling which
seemed more gentlemanly if not so
lucrative as that of master builder),
•and the son with scientific curiosity
and rational inventiveness went off and
called himself an engineer; and, having
done that, began to develop the notion
that civil engineering was a separate
cult from architecture. The result has
been most unfortunate, not only for
the thing produced, but for those who
try to produce it. It might be better
if one were personally responsible for
all the processes in the production of
fine building; that is, design, construe'
tion, and erection, like Auguste Ferret,
the famous Frenchman, and Sir Owen
Williams in England, who have always
insisted on the right to call them'
selves architect'engineers, or architect'
constructors, or just master builders if
they wished, just as the Adam Brothers
at the end of the 18th Century and
the Burtons at the beginning of the
19th Century combined the functions
of architects, town-planners and master
builders, and John Nash, the builder
of the old Regent Street, London, and
the noble Regents Park Terraces, was
cheerfully architect, town - planner,
Crown Surveyor, master builder, en-
trepreneur and the engineer of canals
and ingenious cast-iron bridges.
Now, as I have said, in this schism
between architecture and technology
architecture became unrelated to the
tremendous changes that were taking
place in the engineering field, and
civil engineering* concentrating almost
entirely upon its new problems in new
materials and new structural tech'
niques, even forgot the high aesthetic
mission of great engineering, Thus
the type of structure such as bridges,
power stations and large industrial
plants, which were alleged to be more
the concern or the engineer than the
architect, became completely soul-less
creations, characterised by ugliness
and, curiously enough, very often by
bad engineering. I will deal with this
latter point later.
When the structure was of public
importance it was customary to bring
in an architect as a consultant lo
“beautify it.” The notion was that
the architect would provide a sugary
coating upon this bitter pill of struc-
tural engineering so as to make it
palatable to the public. There have
been hundreds of lamentable instances
of this, right from the Tower Bridge,
London, up to our own day in the
new Waterloo Bridge, London—-which,
whatever its merits, has not the same
integrated quality as the old bridge
designed by Rennie. In the old bridge
the structure was granite, clearly
granite; in the new it is reinforced
concrete pretending to be stone, wfah
the result that its form does not be'
long to either method of construction.
In addition to its own weight and the
weight of traffic upon it, the bridge
has to carry the tremendous weight
of the stone facing, with the result that
the form has become too ponderous at
the crowns of the arches. It is neither
one thing nor the other; and it lacks
the sweetness of line which an honest
and scientific structure should give.
To come nearer home, we have the
instance upon our own doorstep of the
Circular Quay Viaduct and Railway
Station. This misbegotten child, con'
ceived by the Devil out of civic
apathy, in addition to its other mis'
fortunes, has got itself born in the
wrong place. That place happens to
be the most historic spot in the whole
of the vast continent of Australia; the
very place where our Australian
civilisation began one hundred and
sixty Tour years ago: hallowed by the
blood and tears of that early struggle
to survive. It should be a sacred spot
to us who have reaped the rewards
of that Herculean victory. Instead, we
have decided to clutter it up with a
railway.
I am not saying that a railway
viaduct cannot be beautiful. I am
simply saying that this one has been
put in the wrong place. But this is
more a matter of town'planning or
politics than structural design and is
outside our discussion at the moment.
The point I want to make is that it
offers another instance of trying to
beautify what is alleged to be an urn
sightly structure: another instance of
bringing in the architects to sugar-
coat the pill. If we must have some-
thing cutting right across a public
open space we want it to be as light
and as transparent as possible: in
other words we want the finest en-
gineering which becomes fine ar-

SYMPTOMATIC OF ITS PURPOSE.
The new Administration and Receiving Build-
ings for the State Hospital at Hastings, Minne-
sota, have recently been completed and we
illustrate the entrance to the former. It is
cynically suggested that it looks as unbalanc-
ed as the poor inmates who pass through
its portals. The feeling of scale and the
inter-relation of adjacent masses which in the
past were the guiding principles in archi-
tectural design appear to be a thing of the
past and the desire today is to shock by the
unusual and unorthodox.

chitecture; we do not want clumsy
engineering plus a lot of decorative
material which is called architecture.
It must not be thought here that
I want to disparage collaboration be-
tween architects and engineers in prob-
lems of this sort: far from it: there
are many instances where such col-
laboration is necessary because modern
planning and structural problems are
so complex and so diverse that it is
impossible for any one man to solve
all of them. But they must approach
the problem if not necessarily from
the same standpoint, then certainly
with the same ultimate goal in view—
which is the finest possible structure
conceivable by man.
2.—ORGANIC DESIGN.
What is the finest possible structure
conceivable by man? I start first with
the proposition that great architecture
and great engineering are one. Archi-
tecture at its highest becomes great
engineering to wit, Gloucester
Cathedral and King’s College Chapel,
Cambridge and engineering at its
highest becomes great architecture —to
wit, the Pont du Card Nimes, and the
Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco. I
would like to discuss this proposition
at some length—with many illustra-
tions —but there is not time. I hope
vou will accept it as self-evident, or at
least accept the proposition that the
basic requirements in architectural de-
sign and civil engineering design are
the same for all structures which have
a visual entity.
For the creation of fine engineering
and of fine architecture there are three
basic essentials; functional planning,
scientific structure, and aesthetic
modality. As you may know, these
three were put by Sir Henry Wotton
at the time of Shakespeare as “com-
modity,” “firmness” and “delight.” In
the language of psychology these three
essentials in the processes of design
may be called “motivations” or
“drives”: they are inescapable, they
are ever present in the sensitive de-
signer’s mind. I say “sensitive de-
signer” because many designers are
not sensitive; they work by rules—not
only slide rules—and by formulae
which they take to be immutable. In
this they are hardly to be censured
because it is a mode of behaviour that
has come to be accepted for structural
designers.
Functional P la n n i n g. Scientific
Structure, Aesthetic Modality. These
three concepts in the approach to de-
sign are of course three aspects of one
thing, a trinity which is really in-
divisible; but it is easier to consider
them separately, even though they
should be three lines of approach
which proceed concurrently in the de-
signer s mind and rapidly converge
into an organic unity. In fact, they
are complementary to one another;
they reinforce one another, clarify and
amend one another.
It is obvious when you come to
think of it that the need for organic
unity between function, structure and
beauty should prevail in all the pro-
cesses of creation whether by man or
nature. It is obvious enough in
nature, where by the survival of the
fittest there is no real redundancy of
structure. The same holds good for
those structures of man such as aero-
planes and ships, which are the nett
resultant of resistance to powerful
forces —forces that will punish severely
if there is redundancy or insufficiency.
Here we have weight versus efficiency.
In these the designer is forced to
work within a narrow tolerance and
the result is beauty—as it is in nature,
as it is with the human body—before
it puts on too much weight. In archi-
tecture and engineering we can gene-
rally be wasteful without being
punished. With the aeroplane it would
be a criminal offence.
But here it must be said that there
are many structural and architectural
pioneers working in our time towards
a new ideal of perfect organic con-
tinuity in structures. We are entering
a new nhase. As Eric Mendelsohn
ancient static principle, and BUT-
TRESS AND VAULT—the mediae-
val dynamic principle, are being super-
seded by the elastic principle of con-
tinuity of our time.
“Both the static and dynamic prin-
ciple resulted in structures invented by
man, whereas the principle of Elasticity
is dictated by Nature. Upon it Nature
works in all her organisms; in her
material, vegetable and animal king-
doms; in man, plan and atom. This
is the structural meaning of ‘organic’
architecture.”
The biological process applies to
the works of man just as it does to
nature; man is a part of nature sub-
ject to the same laws and in the sur-
vival of the species, looking at it from
a biological point of view—function,
fitness and form are one,
I quote from a statement by Karel
Honzik, called “A Note on Biotech-
nics,” which appears in the interest-
ing book “Circle” published just be-
fore the war.
Speaking of the revealing structure
of the leaf of the Victoria Regia water-
lily he says: “Few will realise that
those thin leaves can support a large
dog or a young child as on a raft.
But the engineer who examines their
undersides is astonished to find that
they might serve as scale models of
reinforced concrete roof-spans. For
here the monolithic systems of columns
supporting radiating beams with slab-
decking between them was fully em-
bodied aeons before Francois Hen-
nibique first worked it out. In the
same way parts of these leaf-beams
where the tension is most pronounced
are reinforced with haunches to in-
crease their shear value.”
He recounts how Paxton, the de-
signer of the great Crystal Palace for
the Exhibition of 1851, in explaining
his designs to the Fine Arts Society,
held up a leaf of the Victoria Regia
and pointed to the 2in. deep ribs
radiating from its centre like bottom-
flanged cantilevers, and the delicate
system of cross-bracing fibres that pre-
vents the webbed membranes between
them from buckling. Paxton modestly
remarked: “Nature was the engineer,
providing the leaf with longitudinal
and transverse girders and supports
that I, borrowing from it, have adopt-
ed in this building.”
“It is therefore rather tempting to
presume that every problem on which

AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL.
That the modern functional style of archi-
tectural design is being applied to new schools
in the United States is amply demonstrated
by this view of the Portola Junior High
School which, located on top of a sloping
site gives a rather dramatic affect with its
main wing supported on great concrete stilts
which seem to be very much a la mode at
present. Construction is reinforced concrete.
Exterior walls are painted above the brick-
veneered basement. Interior walls are plaster,
with tile in toilets and corridors. Floors
are asphalt tile; ceilings, acoustic tile; fen-
estration, projecting sash with metal sun-
shades and glass block; heating, radiant floor
panels in classroom building, warm air in
gymnasium and shops. Lighting is incan-
descent in classrooms, fluorescent in shops.

an engineer or architect may be em
gaged has its solution in natural laws
which inexorably inform his invention,
and even his calculations and draw'
ings. A whole series of phenomena
corroborates the assumption that the
interplay of certain natural forces with
various kinds of matter finds its equi'
poise in constantly recurring forms.
It is a shaping by natural forces. Man
arrives at them by intuition, experi'
ence and calculation: a plant by its
own tropism.
“Nature seeks that ideal state of
equilibrium, or rest, in the balance of
these forces, and the moment she sue-
ceeds in this she ceases to be formless
and assumes a characteristic shape as
in flowers, crystals and other organisms
that are the expression of the forces
that mould them. We are told that
everything on earth is changing and
so moving, but an equally universal
law governs their movement, which is
the seeking of a state of rest or har'
mony, crystallisation or maturity. The
shape in which matter finds its balance
of strength is its perfection: a solution
of its own problem in terms of such
consummate economy that there is no
superfluity, nothing left over. If we
add to, or take something from, that
perfection, the shape loses its equi'
poise, its characteristic appearance, and
has to start in quest of both afresh.”
3. —THE VISUAL CRITERION.
In so many things knowledge can-
not take us the whole way; we need
insight to refresh and enlarge our
knowledge. The scientist needs the
eye of the artist if he is to be a great
scientist; the engineer needs the eye
of the architect if he is to be a great
engineer, and, conversely, the architect
cannot produce great architecture with'
out the rationale of the scientist and
the engineer.
May I quote a great engineer and
scientist, Sir Humphrey Davy, Presi'
dent of the Royal Society of over a
hundred years ago. He said: “The
contemplation of the laws of the
Universe is connected with an imme'
diate tranquil exultation of mind and
pure enjoyment and the perception of
truth is almost as simple a feeling as
the perception of beauty. Imagination,
as well as reason, is necessary for per-
fection in the philosophical mind.
A rapidity of combination, a power of
perceiving analogies and of comparing
them by facts, is the creative source of
discovery. Discrimination and deli'
cacy of sensation, so important in
physical research, are other words for
taste.”
In fact, we might define aesthetic
modality as the visual criterion, some'
thing that must modulate our design,
just as if it were in fact a part of
scientific laws or formulae. The fact
that we cannot work out the rules of
aesthetic compositions on a slide rule
does not mean that they are not inv
portant. Whether we like it or not,
aesthetic selection plays a vital part,
maybe unconsciously, in all that we
do. By means of a visual criterion we
apprehend through the appearance to
the real nature of things. Any osten-
sible form does, to a large extent,
show what has gone to make it. We
apprehend good planning by the sense
of welbbeing which it gives us. We
apprehend good structure by a sense
of security which it gives us. The
process may be intuitive, but it is
real.
4.—THE SEARCH FOR PLEASING
FORMS.
Insofar as it is possible to separate
these aesthetic reactions, what are the
main precepts to keep in mind in
evoking this sense of satisfaction or
pleasure in beholding the visible design
of structure?
Having satisfied to the best of our
ability the planning and structural
necessities —the biotechnics of the job
the aesthetic considerations are
broadly:
(a) biological and psychological,
(b) philosophical and spiritual.
58
December 24, 1952.
BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


In the realm of aesthetics they are not
separate considerations, they merge
into one another and subsist in one
another. The psychological considera'
tions are susceptible to analysis and
explanation, the spiritual are rather in
the realm of philosophic speculation.
Aesthetics to-day are as much a
branch of psychology as of philosophy,
and the more we know about the inner
workings of the mind, the more we
says: “Both POST AND BEAM—the
realise that for mental health and
therefore for survival the sensitive
human being requires certain things in
his visual environment.
He requires on biological or psycho*
logical grounds those very things
which in philosophic discussions un'
fortunately get relegated to the realm
of art. For instance, the desire for
order and all that it implies, order as
opposed to chaos, the sense of unity
in a composition, cohesion and har*
mony, the sense of repose, security
and equilibrium, are all conducive to
our mental health —and are nearly all
explicable—l venture to say—in terms
of psychology.
For instance, what do we mean
when we say things are tidy or un'
tidy? The things themselves are in'
trinsically the same, no matter whether
they are arranged or not arranged, but
when they are arranged in an orderly
pattern they take on a new significance.
The act of all creation is to bring
order out of chaos. There is an eter'
nal desire for symmetry; not only sym'
metry in the geometric sense but also
in the sense of the tiger’s awednspiring
symmetry —to paraphrase the famous
line of William Blake’s, and maybe
that is its only real purpose. I have
often thought that perhaps the only
real purpose of the flower, the crystal,
the snowflake and the atom is just to
be a beautiful pattern. It is a fascinat'
ing thought, but I cannot pursue it
here.
Perhaps it is an awareness of an
inner order of things, a sense of
equilibrium and pattern in the uni'
verse, that modulates our design. I
am not sure how far this is rooted in
our biological growth and can be ex'
plained in scientific terms. But there
it is, and we can’t get away from it.
One or two of these manifestations
can certainly be explained in psycho'
logy—for instance, the fact that shapes
must be decided in their form relates
to the desire for decision in the human
mind; an object that is neither one
thing nor the other is offensive a
rectangle that is nearly a square but
not quite is offensive—a curve that is
not clearly a curve, straight lines that
somehow have got themselves slightly
bent in parts—like the streets of Syd'
ney—a building that seems to divide
itself into two equal parts which vie
with one another, a schizophrenic con'
dition, where the eye wanders distract'
edly over the whole and cannot focus
upon any point; these and many more
instances in bad design convey a sense
of weakness or hesitation, a lack of
decision which is always disturbing to
the mind.
Another instance of psychological
evidence is in colour. Like so many
things which with the growth of
knowledge move from the realm of
aesthetic apprehension to the realm of
scientific knowledge, colour in its effect
upon human beings is almost measur'
able. Whilst the artist and the archi'
tect developed convictions about
colour by the processes of aesthetic
apprehension no one took any notice
of them; now that the scientists have
taken up the matter, colour has be'
come respectable and a worthy subject
for research.
There is also the psychological
theory enunciated by Theodore Lipps
called Empathy, which postulates that
when we look at such things as build'
ings our aesthetic pleasure or dis'
pleasure is derived from the fact that
identify ourselves with what we
see and what the object seen is doing.
For instance, if we look at. a steel
column we feel we are that column
or at least in sympathy with it, and
our happiness or unhappiness is con'
ditioned by apprehension of the stress
which we feel the column is under'
going. Perhaps out of this engineers
unconsciously formulated the device of
the slenderness ratio. What we feel
when we identify ourselves with some
contemporary cantilevered s Ifa b s I
tremble to think. I once tried to put
myself in place of Sydney Harbour
Bridge, but I gave it up because of the
strain —or was it the stress?
It seems to me that this notion of
empathy is based upon the idea that
structural techniques do not change,
that we are always looking at familiar
things. My own experience is that an
unfamiliar structure or element in a
structure may at first appear unstable
and therefore displeasing, but when I
have satisfied myself by scientific en'
quiry or experience that it is indeed
stable, then my displeasure often turns
to pleasure. The contemporary use
of the cantilevered slab is a good
illustration of this; it is exciting, it
has the element of adventure which is
•an important quality in many struc'
tures.
This brings me to my next point,
which is a consideration of what, for
the want of a better word. I call the
spiritual content in the design of
structures. Where there is no spirit
the people perish, and this is true of
structure as it is of humanity. There
are certain super-rational qualities of
impulse that drive us and inform us.
One of these is the admiration of ad'
venture and courage, another is the
search for truth and our delight in
recognising truth when we [see it.
And there are other elements in this
visual pleasure that are related almost
entirely to form and proportion and
pattern. These are especially the
concern of the architect in his studies
of the theory of architectural design.
I only just mention them at the end
of this paper.
The Element of Adventure
and Courage.
This is something which is more
evident in large structures such as
great exhibition halls and airplane
hangars. It is also seen in the great
Gothic Cathedrals, and in the great
domed churches of the Renaissance.

AMERICA BUILDS.
There seems little doubt that when, a thous-
and years hence, the history of the twentieth
century is written, that America, like Rome,
will be recorded as a great nation of build-
ers. Not only do they build well but they
build with the greatest speed possible so that
the benefits may accrue as quickly as possible.
We illustrate (above) the aluminium skin
that is fast enclosing the Alcoa building in
Pittsburgh and (below) the Statler Centre in
downtown Los Angeles which consists of a 14-
storey office building and a 1275-room hotel.

(continued from page 59)
Here, Man has taken courage in both
hands and has soared. He has over'
come the obdurate ponderability of
weight. His spirit has uplifted theo'
retical knowledge into the realm of
sure experience. That is what I mean
by spirit. When we see this we are
thrilled.
This pleasure in recognising courage
does not only arise with large or lofty
structures; we can get it in small ones
when we see that the designer has ad'
vanced knowledge beyond its cus'
tomary bounds by his inventiveness
or originality or even by the carefully
calculated risks he has taken. We can
feel this with the smallest bridges of
Maillart just as we can feel it with
the seemingly impossible Golden Gate
suspension bridge of San Francisco.
The Next Is the Element
of Truth.
No structure can find favour in the
long run if it is dishonest, if it is pre'
tending to be what it is not, such as
a reinforced concrete bridge that is
dolled up to look like a masonry
bridge or a steel framed structure that
is pretending that its panel walls are
load'bearing. After a time people dis'
cover this dishonesty and lose interest
in that type of structure or, rather,
more efficient and, more honest types
come into existence and the older ones
become discredited . A structure in its
outward appearance should reveal its
planning and its structure.
The next is the ostensible efficiency
of the structure and its fitness for its
purpose. This is as much a matter
of planning as of structural design,
but the discerning eye can see through
the appearance whether the mind that
designed it has really grasped the
nature of the problem and dealt with
it adequately. Most buildings fail
dismally in this respect, especially
public buildings. Compare Central
Railway Station, Sydney (or almost
any railway station in Australia for
that matter), with the new Amstel
Railway Station, Amsterdam, which is
not only a masterpiece in planning for
goods and passenger traffic but in its
architectural effect is like a modern
locomotive itself —designed clearly for
a particular purpose and belonging to
that purpose and no other purpose.
The next is Economy —which is re'
lated to Truth. There are occasions
when extravagance almost for the
sake of extravagance —gives pleasure.
The occasional monumental splash has
its place in human affairs to shake us
out of niggardlyness, but it does not
lead to the finest building. That is
the occasion to bring in the sculptor
and the artist and the fine craftsman.
Generally with structural form,
which is also architectural form, re'
dundancy in structure is bad; not
only is it bad in the sense that it is
a serious waste of human labour and
therefore waste of money, it is bad
because it looks bad. Many struc-
tures are clumsy, oafish things which
hurt the spectator not only through
his eyes, but also through his pocket,
when he realises that he is paying
good money in taxes for the ignorance
and timidity of the designer. The
fact that we plead that statutory codes
and building regulations will not per'
mit us to be rational does not excuse
us because we make so little concerted
effort to change them or circumvent
them. We cheerfully say that the
factor of safety is the factor of ignor'
ance, but what are we doing about the
ignorance?
The next are Workmanship,
Craftsmanship and Finish; not only as
obvious contributing factors towards
efficiency in the structure but also as
a pleasurable revelation of thorough'
ness: a delight in seeing a job well
done, down to its tiniest details.
S.—BAD ENGINEERING.
This brings me to my main point,
which is that in my opinion nearly all
ugly engineering is not just bad
aesthetics, it is bad engineering a
failure to understand the finer aspects
of engineering—partly ignorance but
mostly timidity.
May I quote here, very much
abridged, Maillart, the Swiss genius,
who was also engineer in every sense,
designer, constructor and contractor of
the finest reinforced concrete bridges
we have yet seen. He is saying what
I am saying, but with much greater
authority. (The italics are mine.)
“Reinforced concrete ... is most
easily compared with cast'iron as a
material cast in forms, and perhaps we
can learn something directly from the
slowly discovered cast'iron forms re'
garding the avoidance of rigidity in
form by a fluid continuity between
the members that serve different func'
tions. The condition of this beautiful
continuity is the conception of the
structure as a whole. The automobile
and aircraft constructors have attained
this in the highest degree, while it is
an exception for the reinforced con-
Crete constructors to perceive this. It
is not only the feeling for beauty
which makes desirable the conception
of the whole primary to that of the
single elements. Seeing the structure
as a whole nearly aways brings econo-
mical advantage as well. . . .
“. . . The bridge presents another
example. ... It is known from nume-
rous experiments that the most exact
calculations for the design of the arch
no longer prove to be correct, and
because the stresses occurring in the
arch are smaller than designed for, one
is satisfied without further investiga'
tion that this overestimation corres'
ponds to the increased loading of the
superstructure.
“The engineer should then free
himself from the forms dictated by the
tradition of the older building mate'
rials, so that in complete freedom and
by conceiving the problem as a whole
it would be possible to use the mate'
rial to its ultimate. Perhaps then we
would also arrive at a new style as in
automobile and aircraft construction,
as beautiful, and in the same way de'
termined by the nature of the material.
Then perhaps taste will begin to be
rectified, so that the public before long
will ridicule traditional forms in rein'
forced concrete bridges in the same
way as they ridiculed the automobiles
of the turn of the century whose pro'
totype was still the horse'drawn car'
riage.”
And here Maillart, on the calcula'
tion of reinforced concrete says: “The
calculation of external forces occurring
in reinforced concrete structures is not

THE FASCINATION OF THE BIZAIRE.
Man is undoubtedly a funny fellow! His curiosity is great and in his desire to pursue things
to their extreme he sometimes entirely loses his sense of proportion. Take the most “advanc-
ed” architects and interior decorators. In their facile hands and tortuous minds simple shapes
and forms have no rest at all. Take for instance the strange ceiling to a picture theatre in
Italy (left) which in its zigs and zags makes the famous kerosene-tin extravaganza of the Capital
Theatre in Melbourne look flat and stereotyped. And again on the right is a wavy wall which
makes one feel sure that one’s glasses need changing.

deficient in methods, but it is often
hard to find the most suitable method
and to judge of its conclusiveness.
Therefore experiments and the measure
ing of deflection in existing buildings
are of the greatest importance. Fur-
ther, they heighten the sensibility of
the constructor, and, without groping
in the darkness for long, he is led in
the right direction. For dimensioning,
a method of calculation has become
customary that is justly criticised by
many specialists to-day. This question
will only be treated here as limited to
the bending in a beam of rectangular
section.
“The present customary means of
calculation employ Hooke's Law, a so-
called 'constant quantity’ n’ (which,
however, becomes a variable after a
certain point), and the so-called ‘per-
mitted stresses’ that represent the safe-
ty region before the ultimate strength
of the concrete is reached. This is dis-
proved by the fact that breaking does
not generally occur on reaching the
prescribed multiple of the ‘permitted
stress.’ The present-day method of
calculation is then inadequate and in
addition undesirable in education, be-
cause it mediates false ideas of the true
behaviour of a rectangular section un-
der bending stress.
“A new procedure must be based on
its true behaviour, and must eliminate
the illusory ‘constant quantity’ and
‘permitted stresses’. Simplicity is there-
fore more worth striving after than
the greatest precision, which is natural-
ly unobtainable; in any case precision
is impossible due to the very rough
estimate of the safety factor. . . .’’
And in another place Maillart says:
“The notion certainly very often pre-
vails that the calculations should clear-
ly and concisely determine the dimen-
sioning. In view of the impossibility
of taking all the secondary conditions
into account, any calculation can only
provide a basis for constructoin upon
which to set the secondary’ conditions.
Accordingly the calculation results can
either undergo direct application or,
on the other hand, modification, and
the latter will be the case when not
a calculator but when a constructor is
at work. ..
6.—FORMAL COMPOSITION
AND GRAMMAR OF DESIGN.
The foregoing are mostly generalisa-
tions upon the design as a whole.
When we come to the form, qua form,
of the building the following seem to
be the main precepts in the grammar
of formal composition.
As I have suggested previously, this
grammar is to some extent based upon
inherited or subconscious experience
and to some extent upon an aesthetic

apprehension of the inner nature of
things; perhaps an intuitive feeling
that there is some pattern in the uni'
verse, perhaps that there are certain
fundamental laws of force or motion
in the relationship of one thing with
another —basic rhythms —and that we
get visual pleasure in beholding things
in which these laws are expressed or
symbolised. And, as we are a part of
the universe—subject to its is
essential for our well'being that we
should recognise these laws by an in'
tuitive process until such time as
they become proven by rationalistic
processes. As an illustration of this
it is interesting to note that the form
of the now familiar rolled steel joist,
the I beam, was first conceived in'
tuitively by James Watt, the engineer,
in 1801, many years in advance of the
calculations which would prove it to
be the most efficient shape.
Perhaps it is more than just coin'
cidence that contemporary abstract art
in painting and sculpture is producing
forms which are akin to those arising
in modern architecture and engineer'
ing.
Here, in this Theory of architec'
tural composition, I hope that the
architect members of my audience will
forgive me if I touch upon matters
which are common knowledge to them.
Unity. The first of these formal re'
quirements is the appearance of unity.
Organic unity is an essential charac'
teristic of animal and vegetable life,
and it is pleasing when we see it in
the works of Man. Unity here may
be described as the appearance of one'
ness, cohesion, the opposite of disin'
tegration. With unity all the elements
are integrated to make a living whole
—like the human body—where there
is no impression of fission or duality—
no dividing itself into parts which
compete with one another and thus
disturb the mind. In short, with unity
one gets the impression that one can'
not add anything or take away any'
thing without disturbing the aesthetic
impact of the whole—again like the
human body.
Unity is the fundamental law of all
aesthetic composition and the corollary
of this is the avoidance of duality.
Where, for planning reasons, there
are two equal or nearly equal masses
in juxtaposition—or two storeys equal
in height—the sensitive designer will
try to tie them together in such a way
that they do not vie with one another.
Sometimes it may mean the introduc-
tion of a third element (like a tower
in the centre) called by architects a
‘■’'dominant” —which will dominate the
scene or at least act as a focal point
upon which the eye can rest. A good
illustration of this is King’s Cross
Station, London, where the engineer'
designer, disturbed aesthetically by the
juxtaposition of two equal semicircular
arches (which front the ends of the
two great arches of the station) has
put a feature in the centre between
them to act as a focal point. Duality
cah also arise in the composition of
any even number of equal masses if
they appear to split up into separate
groups.
Duality does not so easily arise in
the composition of three —or any odd
number—of equal masses, that is, if
thev are arranged symmetrically, be'
cause the eye can then focus upon a
central mass or feature. Such an ar'
rangement will be unified even though
it may be monotonous. In asymmet'
deal compositions (which is more
often our mode in contemporary de'
sign), where the spaces and masses
are dimensioned and disposed accord'
ing to strict functional necessity, then
the law of unity still holds good.
Many senseless designers seem to have
thrown it overboard when they threw
overboard the classical fashion of synv
metry and the vestments of Greece
and Rome. A sense of unity should
prevail in all composition, and in
asymmetrical groupings it is generally
obtained by knitting the various ele'
ments together in some way (such as

(continued from page 63)
the consistent repetition of a line or
motif throughout the composition)
and by emphasising the importance of
one major element so that it becomes
a “dominant.” If this “dominant” is
sufficiently strong it need not be in
the centre of the picture, and it need
not be a matter of size: it is often a
matter of contrast such as decisive
verticality as compared with the de'
cisive horizontality of the attendant
masses.
There is a great deal more one can
say about asymmetrical compositions.
Their modulation is often a subtle
business of contrasting accents of size,
shape and direction (like the work of
the Dutch architect, Dudok) or some'
times of colour, like the qualities of a
modern abstract painting. But this
does not mean that the plan and the
structure have to be “pushed around”
(in the colloquial sense) to arrive at
a satisfactory aesthetic solution. As I
have said previously, perfect planning
and perfect structure are likely to give
rise to beauty. If they do not, and
you are absolutely certain that you
have perfect planning and perfect
structure —which would be a dangerous
assumption anyway, then you should
not falsify the planning and the struc'
ture for the sake of any aesthetic
notions you may have. The wrong
aesthetic notions can easily ruin good
planning and good structure. At first
the appearance may look pleasant be'
cause it is fashionable. But after a
few years truth will out; and without
truth there is no lasting beauty.
In my experience I find that when
I am designing and I see that the ap'
pearance is not likely to be satisfac'
tory, then I have a hunch that I am
simply beinp told by my sixth sense
that my planning or my construction,
or both, are also “punk.” I start again
and, out of the blue, comes an idea,
something of practical advantage or
necessity, which I ought to have
thought of earlier, which not only im'
proves the planning but also improves
the appearance.
7.—EQUILIBRIUM. HARMONY
AND VARIETY.
To continue with our precepts in
formal composition, the next con'
siderations are those of Balance and
Equilibrium. To obtain the general
effect of repose and indirectly of
stability the composition from
various points of view should not ap'
pear to be top'heavy or lopsided.
But the sense of equilibrium in pure
structural design is perhaps more subtle
than ponderable balance. It is an in'
stinctive appreciation of the finely
calculated balance of forces —in the
engineering sense.
So much for the composition of
the main masses or framework. When
we come closer to the details of de'
sign—from the aesthetic point of vjew
—we find that two important com'
ponents of unity are harmony and
variety. These two components can in
fact be opposed to each, but in a good
design they are complementary, as
they are in music -- as they are in
rhythm. Harmony may be roughly
described as an agreeable consonance,
a consistency, a family likeness be'
tween all parts of the composition.
We speak of harmony in massing
when the masses seem to agree with
one another, and in more detail we
sneak of harmony of line, of shapes,
of proportion, of character, of colour
and texture, and of scale.
I will try to define each one of
these.
Harmony of line occurs where the
horizontal or vertical lines —generally
the edges or arrises of planes or open'
ings—continue and repeat consistently
throughout the composition; thus the
regular repetition of a window has this
effect.
Harmonv of shapes. Harmony in
shapes, in solid and void, is related
to line, proportion, and scale. It is
the consistent repetition of one or
two shapes—not too many—through'
out a composition: for instance, a de'
sign that consistently employs only
one or two shapes for its windows and
its window panes. Two shapes are
often carefully alternated in a modu'
lated sequence. Regularity and power'
ful repetition are the keymotes of
many noble compositions in architec'
ture and engineering*—as they are in
music. We see this in the Rue de
Rivoli, Paris, and in the Pitti Palace,
Florence. It bespeaks* great strength
of mind in the designer.
Harmony of Proportions. This is
an ambiguous expression. It some'
times means the relation of length of
breadth or height to width (a mystic
matter upon which there have always
been such fine speculations), or it
sometimes means a matter of volume
or mass or scale such as when we say
that a very small front door would be
out of proportion with a large house
when we really mean that it is out of
scale. Here in harmony of proper'
tions I consider the relationship of
length to breadth and height to width.
Some designers, such as Corbusier,
have a particular liking for certain
mathematical relationships and use a
consistent system of proportion
throughout a design. The best known
of these is the so'Called “golden sec*
tion” in which the ratio of the longer
side of a rectangle to the shorter is
1.618 to one. A diagonal through the
rectangle provides the complementary
angles of 58-2- degrees and degrees.
To quote from a recent article on the
subject, it is claimed that “this rela'
tionship or number has many signifi'
cant implications in plane geometry, in
musical harmony and in the rate of
biological growth. Adopted as a law
of the Universe by Pythagoreans and
used as a means of architectural pro'
portion by the Egyptian, the Greek,
the Roman, the Mediaeval and the
Renaissance architects, it does seem to
lend a significant unity to the objects
that it governs.”
The scientific study of similarities
in mathematical relationships through'
out the observable universe seems to
me a worthy subject for research: it
is something about which we should
know more, and not only for its iim
plications in aesthetics. In a recent
book by Eric Newton called “The
Meaning of Beauty” he says:
“Beauty, I submit, can be described
as law'abiding behaviour, and the re'
sponse to beauty an instinctive recog'
nition of the existence of law behind
behaviour. There is no need to for'
mulate the laws: all that is necessary is
a conviction that law exists, and that
since it exists it must manifest itself

in some kind of pattern, and that in
the ultimate analysis every pattern can
• be expressed in terms of mathematics.
The origin of beauty is only to be
found in a study of God’s Geometry.
“. . . Beauty in Nature is a product
of the mathematical behaviour of
Nature, which in its turn is a product
of function; whereas beauty in art is
a product of Man’s love of, based on
his intiutive understanding of, the
mathejnatics of Nature.”
Harmony of Character is like har-
mony of style. It simply means that
there shall be a consistency of charac-
ter throughout the design. To make
the mistake of designing one part in
a Gothic style and another part in a
Classic style would nowadays be un-
likely because we have given up the
reproduction of historic styles or
features, but one can easily make the
mistake of jumping unnecessarily from
one material or mode to another
throughout a composition. A struc-
ture that was partly reinforced con-
crete, partly steel, partly brick, and
partly stone would want most careful
handling, otherwise it would look a
hotch-potch.
This brings me to Harmony of
Colour and 1 Texture. There are two
forms of colour, both important: the
natural colour of the materials, and ap-
plied colours—paints, etc. Generally
where one material is used throughout
for the exterior of a building there
will be harmony of colour. In thif
respect some materials are more agree-
able than others—for instance, stone
as compared with concrete. But no
material is intrinsically beautiful in it-
self. One has to select carefully and
obtain good colour, workmanship and
finish. Thus bad stone and bad
bricks of crude colouring badly put
together will look worse than first-class
concrete where there is first-class work-
manship and finish. Strong colours
should always be avoided—except just
here and there—where accents are re-
quired. And this is especially true
with applied colours. It is safer to
work on a colour range of two only.
One soft, pale or mellow colour for
ninety-five per cent, of the surface, and
one bright colour for accents only—if
accents are needed.
Harmony of Scale. Scale is con-
cerned with size. The size of the
whole and sizes of the parts should be
appropriate to the importance of the
building. Where the building is a
large one its major elements and de-
tails should be correspondingly large.
Smallness of scale is the common fault:
rarely, very rarely, is the mistake made
where the scale is too large. One of
the few instances is St. Peter’s, Rome.
Correct scale is also related to an
association of ideas where certain ele-
ments by tradition are associated with
large size—such as a dome, or a clas-
sical column, or a porte cochere. If
these are reproduced to a size smaller
than customary they look ridiculous or
unpleasant. A familiar instance of this
around Sydney is the use of imitation
classical columns —a few feet high and
generally made of concrete on the
fronts of bungalows.
Contrast and Variety. With the
foregoing precepts in mind it would
be possible, I think, to design a build'
ing that had unity and harmony; but
would it necessarily give delight? Per'
haps not. In compositions of any size
we need contrast and variety to re-
lieve monotony. I leave this point
until last, not because it is not impor'
tant, but because it is something that
comes better at the end of our think-
ing rather than at the beginning. Bad
design generally has too much variety
and contrast. Variety is the spice of
life, and, like spice in the cooking, it
is introduced to heighten the flavour,
not kill it. A little spice goes a very
long way. Unity is the fundamental
law, and contrast and variety should
only be sparingly introduced to
heighten and not diminish the sense of
unity. In overall massing there should
be a decided and dominant vertically
or horizontally and a contrasting mass
or lines could make this more obvious
as well as providing dramatic interest.
Variety in detail is no more than
variation upon a repeating theme
like the alternating pattern of wide
and narrow windows, but all of the
same height and in the same scale and
character. Variety in a composition
can so easily degenerate into a con'
fusion of worrying shapes and colours.
My last precept is Expression, and
on this I can say very little except
that if the building is well'designed it
will naturally express its purpose, its
plan, its structure, its epoch and, to
some extent, the personality of its de'
signer.
B.—CONCLUSION.
And here in conclusion I want to
say the obvious, and it is that the
simpler a design is the better. It
generally requires great ability and
strength of mind to produce a design
that is down to bedrock in simplicity.
Anyone can produce a design in the
name of originality that is full of urn
necessary and meretricious tricks. The
true artist approaches perfection by
elimination, and it often requires a
designer of great courage to whittle
everything down to that sinuous grace-
fulness which is near the truth of
things.
I finish on another quotation from
Karel Henzik which seems most ap-
propriate. He says; “A man who is
able to foresee all the various forces
which a given building will be ex-
posed to should be able to attain per-
fection, because, by the nature of
things, he is likely to avoid all tran-
sient and merely fashionable influences/
But such an achievement, being a rare
exception, belongs to the highest order
of creative work. Perfection is far
more often approached by groping
after it generation by generation; by
virtue of intuition; or by the combined
experience and reasoning of hundreds
of different men. It is for this reason
that the masterpieces of architecture
are the expression and achievement of
whole nations, certain epochs or phases
of societv; and that their purely per'
sonal significance fades into the back'
ground.”
Governor Opens New

Entrance to the Oatlands Golf Club
in Beddington Road, Dundas.
This very fine Entrance, designed

Kennedy, has been completed by mem'
bers of the Club in memory of those
who served in both World Wars.
Geoff’s father, Mr. S. D. C. Ken-
nedy. Immediate Past President of
the Club, and a R.S.L. member well'
known in League circles, has long de'
voted his energies to the causes near'

It was no surprise, therefore, to
learn that within the membership of
Oatlands Golf Club there is a keen
ex'servicemen’s group, known ofii-
cially as the Oatlands Servicemen’s
Association, who have made ex'ser'
vice activities an important part of the
Club’s aims and objects.
In addition to fostering and giving
financial support to Legacy and sev'
eral other ex'service activities, the As'

STREET LIGHTING AND ROAD SAFETY
BETTER LIGHTING PREVENTS ACCIDENTS.
British Associations of Public Lighting Engineers.
“Without doubt, one of the most
urgent problems of to'day is that of
road safety, and for this reason I make
no excuse for stressing once again the
important part that the public, it
properly organised on a national basis,
could play "in helping to reduce the
increasing number of accidents on the
roads,” said Mr. E. Howard, F.1.E.5.,
lighting engineer, City of Notting'
ham, in his "presidential address at the
Harrogate Conference of The Asso'
ciation of Public Lighting Engineers^
He stated that the alarmingly high
figure of accidents during the hours of
darkness appeared to be a clear in'
dication that public lighting of the
standard laid down in the Code of
Practice for Traffic Routes would
make a valuable contribution towards
greater safety on our highways.
“In considering this important prob'
lem, let us review some of the facts
with which we are faced. Since the
introduction of the motor vehicle some
fifty years ago, there have been about
7,000,000 road casualties in Great
Britain approximately one in seven
of the present population. The num'
ber of motor vehicles has increased
f rom 144,000 in 1910 to 4,500,000 in
1951. Whilst the total mileage of
road throughout the country has only
increased by five per cent, during the
same period, the population has in'
creased by 20 per cent., and the num'
ber of vehicles by 3000 per cent.
“Owing to economic and other
conditions, lighting authorities have
not been in the position to provide
the necessary street lighting which is
essential for this large increase in road
traffic.
“The national accident figures tor
1951 show a total of 216,493, an in'
crease of about ei?ht per cent, on
those for 1950. Of this number,
5250 were killed. 52,369 seriously in'
jured and 158,874 slightly injured.
Dazzling Headlights.
“Those with experience of night
driving will agree that a large number
of these accidents are caused through
drivers being dazzled by the head'
lights of oncoming vehicles. The
standard of street lighting recommend'
ed in the recently published Code of
Practice for Traffic Routes provides an
ample margin of safety for all road
users without the use of headlights.
A headlight survey test was made in
Nottingham under the worst condi'
tions on a night when it was raining
between 11 p.m. and midnight, when
it is usually found that a large num'
her of drivers continue with their
head lamps fully lighted.
“Observations were made at a posh
tion approximately a quarter of a
mile inside a stretch of road on which
an improved lighting scheme had re'
cently been installed. An examina'
tion of the results showed that only
six per cent, of the vehicles pass'
ing the observer had headlights fully
on, nine per cent, had dipped head'
lights, and the remaining 85 per cent,
used sidelights only. It was also noted
that on entering the improved light'
ing scheme the majority of drivers
using their headlights switched them
off, and the reverse action was taken
when leaving the newly-lighted seC'
tion.

MANWARING DAM, W.A.
During Federation Convention Week of the Master Builders’ Federation of Australia, opportunity was afforded
visitors to view a number of W.A. beauty spots. Among them was Manwaring Dam, a colossa structure which
is part of Perth’s water supply system. Water is also piped from here to Kalgoorlie, 375 miles away. Our

Canadian and American
Experience.
“In Canada, the Street and Safety
Lighting Bureau obtained from a hum
dred towns of various sizes information
on modern street lighting in relation
to road accidents. In some of the
municipalities the reduction in acci'
dents after improved lighting had
been installed was as high as 75 per
cent., the minimum was 20 per cent.,
whilst the average reduction in all
towns concerned was 45 per cent.
In America, a recent study of the
main traffic routes in six Connecticut
cities was made to determine to what
extent- the new street lighting had
contributed to road safety. The in-
vestigation showed that adequate street
lighting can and does assist materially
in f he reduction of road accidents at
night.
£8,000,000 Expenditure
Required.
“The average annual cos': for public
lighting for the 515 local authorities
in England and Wales is 6s. Id. per
head of population, and we can as'
sume, therefore, that the total cost in
Great Britain is over £12,000,000 per
annum. The onlv financial assistance
lighting authorities receive by the
way of a direct national grant is for
the lighting of trunk roads, which this
year is estimated to cost £85,000, or
less than one per cent, of the total
cost borne by lighting authorities.
“The Ministry of Transport Depart'
mental Committee on Street Lighting
in their final report in 1937 estimated
that the annual cost of providing light'
ing to the appropriate standard on all
classified roads in county boroughs
and 20 per cent .of classified roads in
counties would be approximately
.£3,500,000. At current prices and
income levels this would be increased
to approximately £8,000,000 per an'
num. Bearing in mind our present
economic position and accepting, of
course, # the necessity for the rearma'
ment programme, I suggest that if we
can spend upwards of £20,000,000 on
one aircraft-carrier surely £8,000,000
is but a small insurance premium to-
wards helping to save the 216,493
road casualties which, it is estimated,
have cost this country £146,000,000
last year.”
[The President of the National
Council of the Illuminating Engineer'
ing Societies of Australia, Mr. D. R.
Schumann, at the Conference held in
Sydney last month stressed the need
for improved street lighting in Aus'
tralia to assist in road safety.—Ed.}
FLUORESCENT LIGHTING
IN HOSPITAL WARDS.
Fluorescent lighting, which gives the
hospital patient the benefit of even
illumination and the hospital author!'
ties the advantage of, economic current
consumption, is being increasingly
adopted for hospital ward installations.
A recent example is Southlands Hos'
pital, Shoreham-by-Sea, where The
General Electric Co. Ltd., in collabora'
tion with the hospital authorities, have
completed a lighting scheme for
eleven wards.

louvre system which cuts off direct
light below the fitting at an angle of
45 degrees in the downward direction
and ensures that recumbent patients
receive no direct light. At the same
time the open top of each fitting per-
mits good reflected light from the ceil'
ing and promotes a cheerful atmos'
phere. Provision is made in each fit'
ting for two blue 15'watt Osram
pygmv lamps, one of which may be
used for night lighting and the other
for emergency lighting.

Royal Navy’s Largest Aircraft Carrier
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT IN H.M.S. “EAGLE”.
No addition to the Fleet in recent
years has attracted more general in-
terest than the 36,800-ton aircraft-
carrier H.M.S. “Eagle,” the largest
carrier in the Royal Navy. Details
made public by the Admiralty show
that the ship is able to fly off and land
the heaviest and fastest aircraft in the
Fleet Air Arm, including jet
Extensive electrical installations of
many kinds play an essential part in
the operational functions of the ship
and in the daily life, work and leisure
of the crew.
Fluorescent lighting has been adopt-
ed on a much larger scale in
"Eagle” than in any other ship of the
Royal Navy up to the present time.
Some 3000 fluorescent fittings have
been installed in living spaces, offices,
workshops and elsewhere as a major
contribution towards the high stan-
dards of efficiency and convenience
•of living and working conditions that
characterise the ship.
A standard design of fluorescent fit-
ting has been adopted and the whole
number has been supplied by three
companies working in collaboration,
namely, The British Thomson-Houston
Co. Ltd., The General Electric Co.
Ltd. and Siemens Electric Lamps &
Supplies Ltd. In addition, Mazda,
Osram and Siemens fluorescent lamps
are used throughout the ship.
The fluorescent lighting in all
spaces except in the wireless rooms,
where A.C. is available, operates on
the ship’s 220-volt D.C. mains. Each
fitting contains two 2ft. 20-watt natural
colour lamps connected in series. A
ballast resistance in a protective casing,
perforated for ventilation, is mounted
on top of the fitting.
Because of the D.C. supply, periodi-
cal reversal of polarity is necessary to
ensure the highest performance. It
was a requirement of the design and
circuit that the lamps should re-strike
immediately after the momentary in-
terruption of current during reversal.
A conventional thermal starter ar-
rangement was therefore unsuitable
because of the time required for the
heater to cool sufficiently to allow the
contacts to close ready for the re-
start. A similar delay would be un-
desirable after a brief interruption of
the supply for any other reason.
Another consideration was the possi-
bility of low-voltage conditions caus-
ing the starter contacts to chatter due
to the cooling of the heater, thus
causing the lamps to flicker. These
difficulties have been overcome by
means of a circuit incorporating relay
and thermal starter elements embodied
in a plug-in relay developed and
manufactured for all fittings by
Siemens Electric Lamps and Supplies
Ltd and their associated organisation
Alfred Graham & Co. Ltd. The relay
which effects starting of the lamps
operates after the thermal element has
provided the required time-delay for
the heating of the lamp cathodes. A
voltage -sufficient to cause the lamps
to strike is induced by breaking the
circuit through the relay coil and no
choke is reouired in the circuit. When
the relay has operated, the heater coil
and contacts of the thermal element
are out of circuit, so that the contacts
reclose without short - circuiting the
lamps, and are ready for restarting
immediately an interruption of supply
de-energises the relay. The same ar-
rangements prevent flickering of the
lamps under low-voltage conditions,
and stable operation is maintained.
The opal “Perspex'” lamp enclosure
is secured by two knurled nuts. When
removed, access is given to the lamps
and the relay unit so that both items
can be replaced from below the fitting.

tings were subjected to severe shock
tests with the lamps alight before
being approved by the Admiralty.
Each fitting is equipped with two
standard Admiralty pait e r n “C”
brackets for attachment to the deck'
head or to suspension rods. The
method of mounting varies in different
parts of the ship according to local
circumstances. In the living spaces
the layout of fitingts has had to be
planned to clear the hammock bars.
When fittings are installed in spaces
where hammocks are slung, individual
switches are supported from the deck'
head on brackets at a convenient
height for occupants of hammocks to
control the lights closest to them.
Switching from deck level controls
the fittings in groups. Separate
polarity reversal switches are installed
in all spaces where D.C. fluorescent
lighting is used, and are reversed once
every 24 hours.
Operating theatre lighting is by two
special fittings designed by Messrs.
Siemens, each containing three SOwatt
fluorescent lamps with special dim'
ming control gear.
Illumination levels vary slightly in
different parts of the ship, but average
15 lumens per sq. ft. Lighting sup'

BOOK REVIEW.
Physical Aspects of Colour,” by
Dr. P. J. Bouma. Philips Tech'
nical Library.
It is explained in the preface to
the English translation that Dr
Bouma, of Philips Research Labora'
tory, Eindhoven. Holland, was only
able to com pie e this work shortly be'
fore his death, which followed the
progressive paralysis of his powers of
sneech and writing, a nervous malady
that dated from the fateful year 1940.
The subject colour is approached
from the standpoint of physics and
illuminating engineering, although it
also touches on chemistry and physio'
logy, to say nothing of art and
aesthetics. The book is, therefore,
designed to cover the theory of color'
metry and its application to practical
problems in many branches of indus-
try.
The introduction covers the history
ot the physical theory of colour since
the pioneering work of Newton
Colours can thus be distinguished by
their wavelengths. The reflecting pro-
perties of the object also play an
essential part, while a third factor is
the physiology of the eye.
There are three other causes of
variation of colour sensation the
hue, the saturation, and the apparent
brightness. The number three
appears in the basic law that any
given colour sensation can be matched
by mixing three selected colours.
Chapter II treats of the subject of
brightness, an idea that presents dif-
Acuities in its exact definition, as it
may be “apparent” or “subjective” as
well as measurable by physical means.
The three-dimensional colour law
previously mentioned is expounded
fully in the next chapter, which is en-
titled The Colour Triangle.” This
leads in turn to a discussion on colour
space in its simplest form and then to
a chapter on the co-ordinate system of
the International Commission of Illu-
mination.
Chapter VI develops colour calcula-
tions on this system (the C.I.E. after
its French name) and derives the
monochromatic co-ordinates from the
tri-chromatic co-ordinates.
Next some special light sources and
colours are discussed, beginning with
black body” radiation and going on
to the boundary colours or fringes
along the dividing lines of light and
shade and to the theory of “ideal”
colours and “characteristic” colours.
“Objective Colormetry” is the title
of Chapter VIII, which measures the
spectral distribution of energy. Three
photo-electric cells may be substituted
for the human eye where colour in-
dications are required.
Subjective colormetry introduces
the prism and measuring instruments
based on its principle. These are the
tri-chromatic colormeters.
Defective colour vision is discussed
in Chapter X, and this is succeeded
by chapters on the historical develop-
ment of colour science, discrimination,
and the character of colour sensations.
The concluding chapter describes
some practical applications of colour
theory including illuminating engineer-
ing problems.
“Aloha” conveys a wish for hap'
piness, joy, peace, kindness and good'
will to the Hawaiian people. “Hello”
conveys a cheerful, glad'to'see'you ex'
pression. Which would you rather
have?

Housing Commission
Difficulties
3842 Dwellings Completed in 1951-52.
The N.S.W. Housing Commission
completed 3842 permanent dwellings
in the year ended June 30, the larg-
est number in one year.
Completions under the Commis-
sion's sponsored programme totalled
1870.
The Minister for Housing, Mr.
Clive Evatt, recently tabled the Com'
mission’s report for 1951'52 in the
Legislative Assembly.
The report stated the provision of
only £8,514,000 for the year for a
programme under the Commonwealth
State housing agreement estimated to
cost about £14,000,000, and represent'
ed in the main by contracts let or in
hand, had had widespread repercus'
sions.
Immediate Result.
The immediate result was the vet'
tual cessation from November, 1951,
of the letting of building contracts,
the cancellation of contracts for homes,
the termination of negotiations for fa'
vourable contracts for large numbers
of houses, the drastic curtailment of
day labour housing works, and the
inability to honour obligations to firms
established' locally.
The report said that the bad effect
of restrictions on finance were de'
monstrated in the one illustration that
of about 8000 overseas houses that
would have been obtained in the State
to augment local building it was un-
likely that 851 would be built.
The Commission is continuing its
operation on a continually reducing
basis, and no new projects are being
undertaken in replacement of those
that are completed.
“Another disturbing feature is the
continued increase in building costs,
attributable to higher wages and ma-
terial costs,” the report said.
New Homes.
To June 30, 1952, a total of 20,907
permanent homes have been complet-
ed since 1945, consisting of 14,924
in Sydney, 1344 in. Newcastle, 1601
in the Central and South Coast areas
and 3038 in other country areas.
In September this year, because of
an increase in housing allocation for
1952-53, a total of 5073 homes were
under construction or in contracts
on which work was to proceed.
Of these 2656 were in Sydney, 163
in Newcastle, 435 in the Central and
South Coast, and 1819 in other coun-
try areas.
NOVEL IDEA IN LAMPS.
New portable American lamps, to
brighten rooms with sparse modern
furnishings, are being made of white,
yellow, red, blue or green plastic
panels, fitted into wire frames to hide
the electric globe.
The lamps are intended for soft
illumination in dark corners not for
reading.
Their designer, George Nelson, com
siders them best placed on the floor,
below eye level, or hanging on the
wall, above eye level.
He makes them in octagonals, circles,
squares and rectangles. The wire
frame, painted white or black, is seen
between each latex panel and gives
the modern sculptured look.
They admirably suit rooms with
huge, low coffee tables, day beds or
oblong couches.
GERMANY PLANS £4,000,000
BUILDING.
A 450 ft. 30-storey building costing
about £4,160,000, will be built in
Dusseldorf by the House of Fashion
Industry Company.
The building will have a fashion
theatre, mannequin training school,
decorators’ school, shops, hotels, res-
taurants, and beauty salons.
On the roof will be a huge bath
with artificial waves and a beach
where bathing fashions will be shown.

THE CURSE OF THE FLY.
The shocking menace of the common house fly is revealed in all its dread-and unexaggerated-
aspects in this series of drawings. It would be impossible to estimate the damage caused every
year by the fly in terms of sickness, disease and death, yet a little thought and observance of a
few simple precautions can do so much. Read and study this and be careful for your own
sake and that of those dear to you.

ON THE SQUARE—OR OFF IT.
We have become accustomed within the period of recorded history, at any rate, of living “on the square” in
respect of our places of domicile—if perhaps we except the Eskimos and their icy igloos. Today, however, with
the influence of free planning and the flat roof there is no limit to the shape that the floor plan may be for
solid geometry—as expressed in the out-of-square roof. It no longer imposes any restrictions. Such a design is
seen in the upper right example where the side wall of the living room seems at an obtuse angle, incidently much
more so in the perspective sketch than in plan. Traditional respect for the right angle is a feature of the other
designs although two of them have flat roofs.

The Royal Australian Institute of Architects
Annual Convention in Brisbane.
For six days and nights in No-
vember, the City Hall, Brisabne, was
the venue of the annual gathering
of Architects from all States of the
Commonwealth.
As the recurrence in any of the
State capitals covers an interval of
not less than five years, the local archi-
tects, who worked to exhaustion
around the clock, upon the fitting up
and the exhibition of almost every
conceivable phase of the architects’
art, will appreciate the breathing
space of the longer inter-State inter-
vals.
The Convention was regarded as
a pronounced success, from both the
practical and the theoretical messages
they succeeded in conveying. In the
main hall, capable of seating 2500
people, visitors inspected the illustra-
tions, and the exhibits in a kind of
maze, which led them onwards to a
complete inspection of all the fare
that had been provided—which en-
hanced not only building planning but
the furniture and furnishings that col-
laborated towards the perfect ensem-
ble.
The maze led one through a lab-
rinth of walks with reminders of town
planning, educational, recreation, in-
dustrial and commercial, hospital, ec-
clesiastical, traditional, modern hous-
ing, research, civic, and materials for
interiors and exteriors.
Many Addresses.
During the three sessions at each
full day and night of the week, ad-
dresses on appropriate subjects were
given, and discussed, the first after-
noon session concluding with the
Lord Mayoral reception by Alderman
Frank Roberts, M.L.A. The Exhibi-
tion theatrette was availed of freely
for projections of films on a variety
of appropriate subjects.
Of course, full justice was done to
the social side, by indoor and outdoor
parties to view, respectively (a) each
other; and (b) the Cornucopia of
nature’s ideal place for a city—even
as a very early explorer used the
same words—as Brisbane is, with its
dales and hills under the eye of Mt.
Cootha, the handy piece de resistance,
looking down from its 990 feet of
forest, upon the city, and suburbs,
the Pacific, the Brisbane River and
the neighbouring State 70 miles dis-
tant, with Mt. Warning, just as Capt.
James Cook viewed it 164 years ago
from another angle. The rock gard-
ens there, framed in Brisbane’s colour-
ful porphyry, are an unusually beauti-
ful attraction.
A lesson to be learned from the
Convention is, that a numerous body
of cultured professional men, can
strain at the leach of necessary, and
often unnecessary, official restraints,
without breaking; feeling that the time
is approaching when the overtaking
demand for dwelling houses will usher
in a resumption of the pre-war years,
with every city reverberating with
the growth of great buildings to min-
ister to every need in progressive com-
munities. It is when we compare this
comparative building stagnation with
the years, when nations were not at
war with each other, that the scourge
of war is realised in its relation to
Architecture, with its directive cap-
acities collaborating with the practical
master builders and craftsmen, as well
as the makers and fabricators of build'
ing materials.
The Queensland House.
These movable conventions alterna-
ting from the tropical, to the temper-
ate States, have much in common;
and yet, much that is not common
to each latitude. Tropical Queensland
with its vast inheritance of building
timbers had—yes, the past tense is
not inappropriate—achieved during
its first century a type of house just
eminently suited to the needs of
people living in Australia’s warmest
climate, and in the vast majority of
cases, with monetary resources strictly
limited. Facing up to these inescap-
able problems, Queensland achieved
a type of timber dwelling that provid'
ed a greater ratio of population, than
did the other States, with homes of
their own, at a lower average cost
than prevailed elsewhere. Nor did
this cheapness connote the usual nas-
tiness so often allied to that quality.
One outstanding reason was, that the
predominating house was of two
storeys in which the ground floor was
generally unfinished or partly so.
Critics from other States have been
wont to jeer at Queensland’s “houses
on stilts”—but it has many compen-
sating advantages. This extra storey
in Queensland houses has been achiev-
ed at the mere extra cost of longer
house blocks and steps. Generally
speaking, it may not be as ornate as
houses built near the ground level.
The advantages, however, of houses
built on blocks, say 6ft. to 7ft. high,
outweigh the doubtful loss in appear-
ance. Termites can be easily dealt
with should they appear in the
ground blocks and plates; the addi-
tional height makes for coolness, pro-
vides lumber storage, car parking,
laundry, clothes drying area in rainy
weather and so on, and are items on
the credit side.
The greatest blow given to the
standard Queensland house, was the
restriction of building area which (as a
slight concession, overhangs became
common) perforce, eliminated veran-
dahs. In tropical Queensland, these
verandahs meant everything to the
comfort and economy of its dwellings.
The elimination of the protection ol
timber walls from heat, and deprecia-
tion of paint surfaces, has been a cab
amity that future years will confirm.
The comfort of sleeping on verandah
beds removes entirely the need of pass'
ing hot summer nights in bedrooms,
whether properly ventilated—as they
rarely are —or not. It is unfortunate
the influence of Canberra with its
very temperate climate has become in'
dissoluable with its fatherly provision
of monetary help. It suggests the in'
junction remembered from boyhood
days, “Don’t teach grandmother how
to suck eggs . Whether time with
its experience of the need for veram
dahs will dictate a vast programme
of additions to the new verandahless
types, is something to contemplate,
if, and when, the price of roofing
recedes.
With adjurations to “populate or
perish” ringing in our ears, one’s
mind cannot help but contemplate
the present trend in house designing.
There is a compromise, however,
not unworthy of consideration. It is
this: When parents in their old age
are left with homes on high blocks
with too many steps, and too many
rooms to care for, exchanges might
be made with young couples, who
have growing families to rear, and
agility to make the mounting of steps
no toil.

MILDEW DISCOLOURS
HOUSE PAINT.
Mildew—not dirt—is the major
cause of discoloured paint on two of
every three American houses, accord'
ing to the Nuodex Products Com-
pany, of Memphis, Tennessee.
By taking samples of more than
600 homes throughout the U.S. and
analysing them by new techniques,
the company found that 68% of the
discoloured looking houses were the
victims of mildew.
Where mildew is the major factor
in paint discolouration, it seldom can
be removed by washing, it was found.
However, there are paints on the
U.S. market protected with a patent'
ed fungiside that keeps the surfaces
clean for a considerably longer per'
iod.
The new techniques involved in the
study enable paint experts to differem
tiate between dirt and the presence of
fungi which speeds mildew. A spec'
ial type of microscope, long used in
studying the surface of metals, is
now used for the first time in diagnos'
ing the presence of mildew in paint.

The Atom In Peace Time
The atomic weapon explosion on
the Monte Bello Islands is already list-
ed among the nine-day wonders. It
sounded, nevertheless, a warning that
Australia should be up and doing
with its own organisation for nuclear
research.
A typical response to this call has
come from the Federal Government
which is setting up a committee to
“control” the whole of the Common-
wealth Government’s ufanium devel-
opment progress.
The word “control” is more than
a little ominous though perhaps its
use at this juncture is the result of
thoughtlessness. There was no talk
of Government control when the late
Sir Ernest Rutherford and other scien-
tific enthusiasts initiated their experi-
ments into the structure of disintegrat-
ing atoms and if scientific discovery is
to continue to flourish—and much
more of it is needed in this field —
then scientific workers should be en-
couraged to go their own way. In-
spiration comes to individuals and not
to committees of officials.
Possibly an organisation like that
at Harwell, in Britain, is planned for
Australia. If so it will be welcomed.
The United States Government farrm
ed out its atom problems and projects
to private organisations possessing
their own research departments. Such
a method may not be possible here.
Yet there are other ways in which
nuclear research can be encouraged in
Australia. Already the National Uni'
versity at Canberra has a machine of
cyclotron type. Rapid developments
in this field make it difficult for laymen
to keep up to date with its growing
nomenclature.
By way of contrast the Physics De-
partment at Sydney University has
been so short of financial means for
years that, until quite recently, it was
unable to attract a suitable applicant
for a full professorship. There are
now signs of improvement in this
respect but much more could be done,
even for the training of more nuclear
physicists to meet the obvious needs of
tomorrow. Such physicists need vital
research work of their own to gain the
right enthusiasm otherwise they will
drift away to more congenial scientific
climates.
Talk of atom bombs obscures the
work of lasting value being done in
several countries on the use of arti-
ficially'produced radioactive materials.
These first found use in medical
practice but are now being employed
HOME OF ATOMIC RESEARCH IN BRITAIN.
Britain’s Atomic Energy Research Establishment was set up in 1946 at a former Royal Air
Force Station at Harwell. This picture shows the front gate leading to the laboratory. The
first atomic pile, or nuclear reactor, was constructed in 1947 and was named Gleep. It was
followed by another known as Bepo. These reactors produce the radio-active isotopes that
are now transported by air to countries from Finland to South Africa and from New Zealand
to the Argentine. In association with Harwell is the Atomic Production Organisation at Risley,
in Lancashire.

reactor, known as Bepo, surrounded

equipment. Beside it are seen par-

search. This apparatus will gener-

the synchro-cyclotron, one of the
largest machines at Harwell and the
largest of its kind so fat operating
in Europe. A powerful magnetic
field is produced between the 110-
inch diameter horizontal circular pole
pieces. This machine will produce
particles with energies of several
hundred thousand volts. The last
photograph is a close-up view of
Bepo. The dark squares are the
opened holes through which neutron
beams may be allowed to emerge to
be finally absorbed in the beam traps
which are concrete blocks placed in
position.

in many industries for testing purposes.
A British engineer-geologist carrying
out important survey work in Egypt’s
western desert area was able to trace
the course of a water soakage by using
radio-active isotopes, flown out from
Britain for the purpose. Such pro-
ducts from Britain’s Harwell Station,
now form a considerable export busi-
ness to foreign countries, aircraft be-
ing specially fitted to carry them in
their wings.
One field for the use of nuclear
fission in a large way seems to have
been overlooked although it was once
rumoured that the Russians had used
an atomic explosion in excavating a
canal in Central Asia.
The Chinese invented gunpowder
and used it in crackers to scare away
evil spirits. In Europe it was first ap-
plied in weapons of war and in sap-
ping under fortifications before it
found uses in construction work.
The Swedish engineer-chemist, Al-
fred Nobel, was so dismayed at the use
of his invention of dynamite for war
purposes that he left his large fortune
to found prizes for benefactors of
mankind.
Should we not, then, be thinking of
atomic explosions in carrying out
large engineering works, a field that
makes a steady demand for the pro-
ducts of high explosive factories.
In particular there is one class of
work that is needed in this country
but which cannot be financed under
present cost conditions. This is the
provision of flood control dams on the
headwaters of our rivers. Dams of
this type do not require a high de-
gree of watertightness
It should not be difficult to con-
ceive of flood control dams being con-
structed by blowing down opposite
hillsides to fill a valley in our many
square miles of sparsely occupied
mountain country. Such work would,
of course, need to be preceded by the
construction of outlet works, tunnell-
ed through the hillsides, clear of the
explosion area or laid in the river
bed and adequately blanketed with
rock and earth filling.
An atomic explosion or chain re-
action requires a certain minimum
tmount of material. This will prob-
bly mean a minimum size explosion
iob to make it worth consideration
but its possibilities should not be over-
looked and Australia- with its own
uranium resources might lead the wav
in applying atomic explosions to civil
engineering works or for the uncov-
ering of mineral deposits in remote
places.
It has been estimated that if the
electrical charge in the red-blood cells
of a man could be collected and sent
through a 25-watt light bulb, enough
to read by, it would burn for five
minutes.

BOOK REVIEW.
“Economical Domestic Heating,”
by H. G. Goddard. M.A.,
F.R.1.8.A. 150 pp. Index.
Illustrated. E. &F. N. Spon
Ltd., London. English price,
21/'.
The question of domestic heating
is a very vital one in Britain and any
lessening of its economic burden is
indeed welcome. Many regard Aus'
tralia as a second California, where
warm sunshine is the prevailing con'
dition; yet flattering as this may be to
our climate, the fact is that we do in
most Australian cities experience quite
cold and wet conditions in the winter
months, when the question of the pro'
vision of reliable and economical heat
becomes a vital need. Hence the
local interest in Mr. Goddard’s new
book.
The provision of homes in the post'
war years has been -a task of vital
national consideration and every effort
has been made to raise the standards
of comfort without imposing an ex-
cessive fuel bill on the tenants, or load
on the national economy, by way of
increased coal consumption. To
achieve this a great deal of research,
both in Britain and elsewhere, has
(continued overleaf)
PRODUCTION OF RADIO-
ISOTOPES AT HARWELL.
Britain’s Atomic Energy Re-
search Establishment at Harwell
is already famous for its produc-
tion of radio-active isotopes for
medical purposes. In the upper
picture a plastic surgeon is us-
ing a sodium isotope to find out
whether the patient’s blood is
circulating in a skin graft. The
second picture illustrates the use
of isotopes, in this case gold
198, for industrial purposes.
The picture was obtained in re-
search work on a telephone set.
The Harwell Establishment’s
Isotope Division offers an advis-
ory service for industry and also
a newly-opened Isotope School
for providing training courses for
the users of radio-active isotopes.

been undertaken, and it is the object
of this book, says the author in his
preface, to gather this knowledge and,
together with recent practical ex-
perience, to assess the value of various
ideas in terms of capital and running
costs.
First the physiological requirements
for comfort are dealt with, followed
by types of fuel and methods of using
them, augmented by the important sub-
ject of insulation.
Importance of Insulation.
The author’s opinion of the im-
portance of this aspect of the heating
problem is well summed-up in the
opening paragraph to this chapter:
“Perhaps the most profitable invest-
ment that can be made in connection
with heating is not in the apparatus
itself, but in insulation. Whatever the
class of building, insulation is bound
to pay a large dividend by way of fuel
savings; in some cases, it may even
show a capital saving, for the cost of
the insulation may be less than the
difference in price between the heat-
ing plant required for the uninsulated
and the insulated building. Certainly,
in the case of domestic buildings, good
insulation can lead to comfortable con-
ditions with comparatively simple and
cheap heating apparatus which would
prove quite unsatisfactory in a less
well-insulated building.’’
District Heating.
Although the number of district
heating schemes at present in opera-
tion in Britain is comparatively small,
there has been renewed interest in the
means of tackling the problem. Al-
though no panacea for the heating
and hot water supply problems of
new housing schemes, it possesses ad-
vantages of its own which must make
it worthy of more than passing con-
sideration.
Radiant Heating.
Discussing radiant heating, Mr.
Goddard sounds certain notes of warn-
ing. Some individuals, he says, are
more sensitive than others to radiant
heating from the ceiling, particularly
if they are as low as eight feet; also
excessively hot floors can produce un-
pleasant effects and can be very tiring
to those who have to stand for long.
A temperature of 75 degrees Fahren-
heit should not ordinarily be exceed-
ed, though 85 degrees Fahrenheit is
used for floor heating in America.
The cracking of floor and ceiling sur-
faces can be overcome by the use of
proper materials and construction.
The Heat Pump.
The final chapter is devoted to the
heat pump, an experimental installa-
tion of which was used to heat the
Royal Festival Hall at the recent Fes-
tival of Britain.
The author says: “Possibly the most
ingenious application of science to
heating is the heat pump. Although
the capital cost of the equipment in
the smaller sizes is likely to prevent its
use for a long time to come, never-
theless, to take a long view, it may
well come into its own—the refrigera-
tor is very closely allied to it, and who
would have thought thirty years ago
that practically every new house would
be equipped with refrigeration.’’
An excellent up-to-date work at a
reasonable price.
AUTOMATIC TURNSTILES
ON HOBART WHARVES.
The Hobart ferry wharves will
soon be equipped with automatic
turnstiles similar to those used in Syd-
ney. Australian General Electric Pty.
Ltd. are supplying the six electrically
operated turnstiles to be used at the
Hobart ferry terminal. Four of the
turnstiles will provide for sixpences
and the other two will be arranged
to take threepenny bits. By using
these six Hobart turnstiles the Tran-
sport Commission of Tasmania expects
to effect savings in manpower and
avoid delaying passengers.
ATOMIC PLANES FOR K.L.M.
ROYAL DUTCH AIRLINES.
The managing director of K.L.M
Royal Dutch Airlines, Dr. Plesman,
stated that he was convinced that
atomic aeroplanes would be put into
service by K.L.M. before the end of
1975. -j •
Atomic planes will have an un-
restricted action radius and a speed of
900 miles at an altitude of 55,000 feet.
It is estimated that the approximate
cost of an atomic aeroplane will be
.£1,900,000, and in view of the high
cost involved, it will be necessary to
raise the company’s capital from <£ls
million to £5O million. Although the
cost of aeroplanes is continually rising,
their flying capacity is becoming
greater. Against a period of 300 hours
in the past, it is estimated that atomic
planes can be used for at least 5000
flying hours.
U.S. Housing Market
Revives
But Building Costs Climb.
Recent signs which pointed to a
levelling off of American prosperity
and activity have now disappeared, and
economists believe business will rival
the record levels attained in the winter
of 1950-51.
The housing market has revived
considerably as a result of recent Gov-
ernment action relaxing restrictions
on loans and mortgages for private
houses.
Close on 7,000,000 new dwelling
units (houses, flats and apartments)
have been built since the war, and
at least one-sixth of the entire U.S.A.
population now live in houses and
flats of comparatively recent construc-
tion.
But this astronomical number of
new dwelling units has by no means
solved the housing problem.
A recent survey disclosed that there
are 95,000 families in New York city
alone who need rehousing—quite
apart from the families of 10,000 ex-
servicemen who are still living in
converted army huts.
Restrictions.
Following the outbreak of the Kor-
ean war the U.S. Government set
about conserving scarce materials and
halting inflation by imposing severe
restrictions on the terms on which a
mortgage could be obtained for pur-
chasing a house.
Since nearly 90% of Americans
obtain their homes on the instalment
plan, this was an effective method of
limiting the number of houses built.
A considerate Congress this year
extended control only on condition

MURALO Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. Port Adelaide Melbourne Sydney
that the monthly average of houses
started did not fall below 1,200,000
a vear.
However, as the building industry
ran below this figure between June
and October, the credit controls have
automatically to be relaxed.
Costs Up.
Despite a levelling off of costs of
building materials in the last two
years, the cost of the American
Standard house is now fabulously
high.
Costs have climbed, although the
rearmament programme has enforced
the use of some cheaper substitute
materials, such as plastic instead of
copper, for cold water pipes.
In suburban Washington, a “Ramb'
ler” bungalow of three bedrooms, two
bathrooms and a living room (no sep'
arate dining room) costs $36,000
(£A. 12,800); the cheapest two'bed'
roomed house costs about $14,000
(£A.5,000).
The ancient shot tower in Knox
Place, Melbourne, is the city’s most
unique landmark. It was erected
nearly 100 years ago. Foundations
of the tower are 40 ft. deep, the
walls are over 3 ft. thick, and it is
200 ft. high. Besides being used for
making shot, organ pipes and lead
pipes, many other lead products are
manufactured at the old tower.
THE A. E. GOODWIN
SCHOLARSHIPS.
Established As A Memorial.
Two scholarships worth £l9O will
be a memorial to the late Mr. A. E.
Goodwin, founder of the firm of A.
E. Goodwin Ltd., manufacturing em
gineers.
With his wife, Mr. Goodwin, in a
single engine Auster plane, disappear'
ed on a flight from Goff’s Harbour
to Sydney in 1950 and are believed
to have crashed into the sea.
The establishment of the A. E.
Goodwin memorial scholarships has
been announced by the Director of
the N.S.W. University of TechnoL
ogy and the Department of Technical
Education (Mr. A. Denning), and the
Managing Director of A. E. Good'
win Ltd., Mr. T. G. Edgar, said that
the scholarships would be a fitting
memorial to a man who had pioneer'
ed one of the largest manufacturing
engineering organisations in Australia.
“Each year these scholarships will
give two young men an opportunity
to acquire the high qualifications need'
ed for top jobs in the engineering
industry,” said Mr. Edgar.
“Growing tension throughout the
world has made this industry of vital
importance to Australia, because it is
the backbone of our defence produc-
tion.
“My firm feels that even if the
scholarships produce only one engim
eer of the calibre of the late Mr.
Goodwin, they will have fulfilled their
purpose, because few men have con'
tributed more than he did to the
engineering industry.”
When the firm of A. E. Goodwin
Ltd. was founded by Mr. Goodwin
in 1926, it had a staff of only five
men in a smal Ifactory at Lidcombe.
Today the firm has more than 1000
employees. It has a factory covering
10 acres at St. Marys, shipyards at
Port Kembla, and a wholesale mer
chandising division in Goodwin
House, Bathurst Street, and manufac'
ture goods ranging from wheelbarrows
to railway rolling stock.
One scholarship will be tenable in
the management diploma course of
the Department of Technical Educa'
tion; its total value would be <£loo,
payable in four annual amounts of
£25. The other scholarship will be
in the mechanical engineering degree
course of the N.S.W. University of
Technology. Its total value being <£9o,
payment in three annual amounts of
<£3o.
The first awards will be made in
1953. Full particulars are obtainable
from the Secretary, Department of
Technical Education, or the Registrar,
N.S.W. University of Technology.

A HEADACHE FOR THE BUILDER
Setting out the oviform house as seen in the top right example in which all the rooms are oval in shape but of
different dimensions would certainly provide a headache for the unfortunate builder, while, in preparing the plans,
one would expect a naval architect to be much more at heme than his land-locked colleague. Even our designer
seems to have flinched from drawing up the elevations and has compronised with an interior sketch. A lounge in
which a large part of one external wall is of gless, is a feature of the top left scheme, while the vertical louvres
in the bottom right give rather a harem like appearance to this four-square design. The kitchen in the bottom
left shows how the modern kitchen is planned in every particular to ensure comfort to the housewife and to
provide maximum storage space.
