OTIS
The building and its function must deter-
mine the type and design of vertical
transportation whether it’s a department
store, railway terminal, office block or an
industrial plant. That’s why it is so im-
portant to use the expert knowledge of Utis
when planning any new project that in-
cludes lifts or escalators —because the Otis
approach to any problem is basic and prac-
tical, backed by extensive experience, com-
plete facilities and a world-wide reputation
for making and installing the best in
vertical transportation.

STEEL SPEEDS
PROGRESS
OEHIND most of the developments which make this land of
ours a better place in which to live and work, stand the
furnaces and mills of the steel industry, for steel is man s most
versatile metal . . . the tool and material of progress.
Without iron and steel, the achievements of modern
industry, agriculture and transport would be virtually impossible.
Helping speed Australia’s development are the 23,500 men and
women of the B.H.P. organisation, supplying the nation with
iron and steel, and building for the future.
The industry’s steel-making capacity is being expanded by
more than one third, and new plant installed . . . more steel

ANSWER special problems arise about the type of surface and kind of
* ’ environment where "Alpaste” Paint can be used most effectively, the
advice of Aluminium Union Limited is freely available. The answers given
to questions will be based on our long experience as suppliers of "Alpaste”
and will be supported by the results of constant research in the Laboratory
and elsewhere.
To-day, many trades and industries are concerned with problems arising
from the damaging and deleterious effects of such agents as moisture, the
sun’s heat, corrosive fumes, sea water and rust. Sometimes these problems
are sharpened by reason of defects normally shielded from view, or where
the damaged surfaces are placed in inaccessible spots. For these, and similar
difficult conditions, the durability of "Alpaste” Pigmented Paint affords full
protection for long periods.
Made by a patented process in a convenient paste form, "Alpaste” Paint
Pigment is composed of thin flakes of aluminium, which, when mixed with
a suitable medium, "leaf” and form an opaque and durable metallic shield.
Moreover, "Alpaste’s” high reflectivity and low heat absorption charac-
teristics help to maintain a temperate interior wherever it is used externally.
'THE luxury vessel "Ocean Monarchlike many other well-known ships (including the "Queen Mary"),
is painted keel to lightline with an Alpaste-containing primer manufactured by British Paints Limited .

The Great Melbourne Fire left only one
building intact in a whole city block
GRINNELL SPRINKLERS SAVED ITS
In 1897 the city of Melbourne
suffered the fire that is still known as
“The Great Melbourne Fire/’
From Flinders Street to Flinders
Lane, from Elizabeth to Swanston
Street, warehouses were reduced to
smoking shells. Yet right in the
middle of the area the Mutual Store
stood intact.
As the Melbourne Argus of
November 22, 1897, writes —“None
of the buildings was more fiercely
attacked than the Mutual Store and,
while the others were gutted with
phenomenal speed, the store stoutly
and successfully resisted.”
The Argus continues, “The test
which the Grinnell Sprinklers (which
protect the building in all areas)
received, served to show that they
could be relied upon to come into
play where the heat was allowed to
rise to the necessary temperature.
Wherever the fire encroached to any
extent the sprinklers operated.”
Today, over 50 years later, the
block around the Mutual Store has
been rebuilt and almost without
exception the buildings are fitted with
Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler systems.

Restoring incentive
For Building
Investment
In the past five years Australia has
undergone an economic convulsion
unparalleled in its history. Costs
naturally rose during the war, but not
tragically; it has only been in the
period of galloping inflation through
which we have just struggled that the
real damage has been done. The Basic
Wage went up: prices followed, in
most cases with the tardy blessing of
the Price Control authorities. Before
the war Builders erected the majority
of houses and flats for the people of
Australia and sold them subject to a
fair profit to themselves. As a result,
investment in “bricks and mortar” was
regarded as the most reliable to be
had, while it was at the same time
fulfilling a basic need to this young
and developing nation.
Compare the position tO'day: Build'
ing costs, together with all others, have
risen greatly, but unlike others, the
selling cost of houses—the rent —has
been held down at those obtaining a
decade ago, and so a ridiculous posh
-ion has arisen. The investing public
have of necessity had to withdraw
from this vital field.
Mr. J. O. Cramer, M.H.R., who is
in eminent authority on real estate,
spoke vehemently on this subject at
:he recent Annual Meeting of the
Building Industry Congress of N.S.W.
‘Congress must, in the interests of the
industry and for the good of Australia,
persevere with its efforts to restore
ncentive for building investment. It
s a tragic thing for Australia that
ivents since 1939 have effectively de'
itroyed the incentive or even the will
° private investment in Australia.
We have accumulated something in
he vicinity of a thousand million
rounds in the savings bank and ap'
iroximately eight hundred million
lounds in the trading banks.
“If the rent factor had increased in
iccordance with other costs and
:harges there would be room in exist'
ng houses for 10,000 more people.
f six people occupied a tenancy in
f 939 and only one is left in 1953, that
me person sticks to the tenancy in
nost cases and no one is allowed to
:ome in. In the fourteen years from
1939 there is hardly a family in Aus'
ralia which has not been injuriously
iffected by the operation of tenancy
:ontro!s. There is a deep freeze of
listing properties; we have reached a
rucial stage when only Governments
:an build investment property and this
is a very serious matter for the Build'
ing Industry.”
Mr. D. Stewart Fraser, M.L.A., in
his recent Maiden Speech in the
Addressdn'Reply, also referred to the
section of His Excellency’s speech that
Parliament “will be asked to consider
further amendments to the Landlord
and Tenant Act.”
“I do hope,” he said, “that this
sentence holds promise of amendments
which will restore incentives to invest'
ment building by removing rent con'
trol from all new buildings. It would
also be a grand service to the homeless
if the control were also removed from
all buildings which have not previous'
ly been rent controlled.”
The Building Industry will fervently
share this hope.
Exhibition Building Passes To Wreckers
Demolition Now Under Way.
Late in 1869, the Municipal Coum
cil or Sydney decided to erect a build'
ing in Prince Alfred Park, in which
the Agricultural Society of N.S.W.
could hold their annual shows, and
for other public purposes.
T .
In January, 1870, specifications and
plans for this building (see illustra'
tion) were prepared by the City Em
gineer, Mr. Ed. Bell, and on February
10, 1870, Mr. John Youne siened a
contract to erect the structure at a
cost of £17,475.
On March 9, 1870, the Mavor
Alderman W. Renny, laid the founda’
tion stone. The building was com'
great Inter'Col'

ernor Belmore on August 30 of the
same year.
The main building had a floor area
of 198 ft. by 130 ft. Through the

mam building with its semi'cylindrical
roof springing at 42ft. from the
ground with a clear span of 60ft., the

This very worthy project was
conceived by the N.S.W. Baptist
Homes Trust to fill a muclvneeded
want in the community. It is non'
denominational and non' profit'
making in character; the test for
admittance being primarily old age
and need.
The Home stands in six acres
of ground, and the building just
completed is only part of an ulti'
mate larger scheme. This first
unit contains 24 single rooms, four
double rooms, toilet block and a
sick bay, a Matron’s suite contain'
ing bed'sitting room, bathroom and

designed to serve the needs of the
ultimate enlarged project, which
will house 100 guests. The sick
bay is fully fitted out to take care
of any. of the guests who may
become ill.
“Dwelling Home.”
The name “Yallambi 11 is an
aboriginal word meaning “dwell'
ing place,” and the Architects have
endeavoured to give this building
the character of a dignified
“Home 11 as distinct from an insti'
tution; it is modern in every sense
without being ostentatious.
Materials used in construction
have been selected with a view to
permanence and minimum' of main'
tenance, the external walling is of

The present chapel is 72 ft. deep
and 32ft. wide, and the exterior is
faced with sandstone with a cruci'
fix 18ft. high, the cross being of
granite and the figure of bronze.
The latter is modelled on the one
evolved by an eminent French
doctor and sculptor after an extern
sive study of the Holy Shroud of
Turin. Below the crucifix will be
the crests of the Navy, Army and
Air Force, cast in bronze.
A towerdike effect is given to
the background area of the crucifix
by the use of narrow verticular
stonework in contrast with the
squares under the windows.
A feature of the facade are the
large windows, 28ft. high and 23ft.
wide.
Inside the chapel the gallery and
main body of the building accom'
modate 350 people; a small Lady
Chapel has been placed in the
existing stone building to the left
of the main chapel. In addition
to the main altar of marble, there
is a side altar and four shrines.
Because of the proximity of
commercial buildings to the pro'
posed chapel, the architects were
confronted with unusual difficuh
ties, which they have overcome
most effectively after careful study.
Based on functional require'
ments, their design is in harmony
with the latest overseas trends in
church architecture, particularly in
the Americas and Scandinavian
countries, and the main facade is a
most interesting addition to the
architecture of Sydney.

Delegates Welcomed.
Prior to the arrival of the Premier,
the Federal President, Mr. C. R.
Hansen, said he was very pleased to
see the delegates assembled in such
strength. He then called on the
State President, Mr. T. W. Morris,
to adress delegates.
Mr. Morris, on behalf of the M.B.
A, of Victoria, said he was indeed
happy to extend the hand of welcome
to delegates and visitors.
He expressed the earnest wish that
their stay in Melbourne would be a
memorable one. The members of his
Association would do everything pos-

sible to make the Convention an in'
dustrial and social success.
Mr. Morris concluded by voicing the
hope that the Federal President, Mr.
Hansen, would have a very successful
Convention.
“We are very proud to see Mr.
Hansen in his office of President, and
we are also proud of the splendid job
he has done during his term,” Mr.
Morris added.
Opening Ceremony.
In welcoming the Premier, Mr.
John Cain, the Federal President, Mr.
C. R. Hansen, paid a tribute to his
personal integrity, bothh as a poli'
tician and a man.
“Mr. Cain has been a great friend
to the building industry, especially in
the post'war years,” Mr. Hansen said.
“The industry in Victoria has re'
ceived a great deal of help from Mr.
Cain in the past. It was he who com'
bined with the Victorian builders to
frame the building industry of the
time,” Mr. Hansen added.
The Premier prefaced his remarks
by saying that he was very proud to
know Mr. Hansen, who had rendered
the Government a great deal of as'
sistance in advancing solutions to var'
ious urgent problems.
Mr. Cain said the building industry
was of vital importance to Australia,
and that builders had done a great job,
both during and after the war.
He compared Britain and Austra'
lian home building schemes, and com'
mented that Germany, in particular,
had concentrated on factory construe'
tion.
It was difficult to decide what was
the right thing to do in that regard,”
Mr. Cain declared.
“All countries were suffering from
the restrictive Landlord and Tenant
Acts, and rents in Britain were the
same as they were in 1930.
“If a Conservative Government was
not game to repeal the Act, can you
expect a Labour Government to do
so?” (Laughter.)
Continuing, Mr. Cain said Victoria
faced a tremendous problem in hous'
ing.
“We are tackling it, right or wrong,
and we hope that soon chaos will give
way to efficient building methods, and
a difficult position will be resolved.
“We must try to get uniform build'
mg regulations and evolve a plan to
solve our problems,” Mr. Cain de'
dared.
The speaker paid a tribute to the
Master Builders of Victoria for their
loyal co'operation with the Govern-
ment. They en deavoured to give
everyone satisfaction in every way.
Welcoming delegates and visitors
from other States, Mr. Cain said he
hoped their stay would be enjoyable,
the weather kind, and that they would
see as much as possible of the metro'
poll’s.
Speaking in a serious note, the
Premier warned that solution of build'
ing problems “was not easy.” It was
necessary to closely examine building
regulations throughout Australia and
evolve a master plan.
He asked builders not to lower the
standard of building, but to endeavour
to stabilise the industry.
“My Government is prepared to
listen to such a plan,” Mr. Cain de'
dared.
“It is not an easy job; it is a very
difficult job, and one which must be
tackled wholeheartedly.
“Mr. Cain said his Government was
having no difficulty in getting con'
tracts on a firm basis.
“We no longer have Rise and Fall
contracts; we signed the last one the
other day. From now on all contracts
will be firm ones.
“The position was greatly difficult
and than two or three years
ago,” Mr. Cain commented.
“We are getting a lot of work in
the £50,000 to £60,000 class complet'
ed quickly.
“The building trade seems better
than ever before in this respect from
our knowledge of the position,
“We have not got the solution of
your problem yet, but the Victorian
Government is determined to bring
about a better standard of construe-
tion; one that will stand the test of
time,” Mr. Cain concluded.
Vote of Thanks.
In moving a vote of thanks to the
Premier, the State President, Mr, T.
W. Morris, said the Federation and
Association was grateful to Mr. Cain
for performing the opening ceremony.
“We in Victoria have a very high
regard for Mr. John Cain. We might
not agree with him on political mat'
ters, but the whole population is firm'
ly convinced that in John Cain they
have an intensely honest gentleman.
“We as a body are particularly
anxious to have closer cooperation
between the building industry and the
State. We feel there is much room
for far closer cooperation,” Mr.
Morris declared.
He said the Premier seemed very
pleased at the advent of firm price
contracts in Victoria.
It was the M.B.A. of Victoria that
advocated abolition of rise and fall
contracts, so the public would get a
good job at the right price, Mr.
Morris continued.
“The Association got into consulta*
tion with the architects, and thus fix'
ed price contracts came about as a di'
rect move from the builders to the
State,” he added.
Regarding uniform building regula'
tions Mr. Morris pleaded that build'
ing standards should not be lowered.
“No one is more anxious than my
Association that existing standards
should be maintained,” he added.
Mr. Morris commented upon the
high standards of building in Austra-
lia compared with those he had seen
in other parts of the world, during a
recent overseas tour.
“I saw no part of the world that
would compare with the whole metro'
polis of Victoria.
“It is our task to maintain that on
a sensible basis.
“We must give the public a good
article in a sensible fashion. In fact,
good sense must come to the party,”
Mr. Morris added.
He said he was anxious to have
more say about building than in the
past, and he asked the Government
and all concerned to cooperate more
closely than before.
Mr. Morris said he would like to
propound a scheme that greatly im'
pressed him while in Madrid, Spain.
The results of the housing drive were
“staggering.”
“I saw five sets of blocks with
1000 flats in each and 8 blocks of 600
flats each, and 28'Storeyed buildings
and hotels.
“The Franco Government had abol'
ished housing poverty, by realising
that taxes cost more to collect and
loans cost more to administer, than
the money they returned.
“The results is that all rents are
now tax free, and that suddenly made

property ownership the finest possible

“In Spain today, millions of pounds
are being spent by private enterprise
on housing, while the Government
concentrates on erecting public build-
ings.”
Mr. Morris commended such a plan
for consideration by the Federal and
State Governments as something
worthy of Australia.
Replying, Mr. Cain promised to
give any plan submitted the fullest
consideration. (Applause.)
Civic Welcome.
Following the Premier’s visit, dele-
gates made an official call on the Lord
Mayor of Melbourns, Cr. R. H. Solly.
The Lord Maqor said it was a great
privilege to welcome leaders of the
building industry to Melbourne.
He recalled his 40 years connection
with the industry, and said his long
association with builders had been a
very happy one.
There was no finer body of men in
Australia than the builders, who had
raised mighty cities throughout the
length of the land.
It was unfortunate that all Austra-
lian capital cities suffered from the
restrictive effects of the Landlord and
Tenant Act, building controls, and
rent controls, the Lord Mayor said.
All capital cities faced the same
problems, and unless they were tackled
and solved, unemployment would fol-
low, and the progress of the Com-
monwealth would suffer severely,” the
Lord Mayor added.
Supporting the Lord Mayor’s re-
marks, Sir George Wales congratulat-
ed Melbourne on being the venue of
the 47th Federation Convention.
Building prosperity was the clearest
barometer of the prosperity of Aus-
tralia, and any slump in building auto-
matically brought about a depression,”
Sir George declared.
Few realised the vital influence the
industry had upon the welfare and
economy of the nation.
At the present time there was very
real interference—Government inter-
ference—with building, and great
frustration was evident in every State.
“The progress of Australia must be
placed higher than votes by all brands
of Government,” Sir George declar-
ed.
“The builders must fight harsh leg-
islation and thus become builders of
Australia,” he added.
Replying, the Federal President,
Mr. C. R. Hansen, thanked the Lord
Mayor for his cordial remarks, and
paid a tribute to his great work for
the building industry, and for Mel-
bourne.
“We well know that our Lord
Mayor and Sir George Wales have
walked along the wide highways of
the building industry, and they have
done a tremendous amount of work
upon our behalf,” Mr. Hansen added.
The Federal Senior Vice-President,
Mr. T. M. Lipscombe, briefly support-
ed Mr. Hansen’s comments, and add-
ed that the yearly gathering of Mast-
er Builders to discuss their problems
was of vital importance to the build-
ing industry of Australia.
The M.B.A. of N.S.W. President,
Mr. P. Bottomley, and Mr. Lilleyman
(W.A.), also spoke briefly.
President's Report.
The annual report of the Federal
President of the M.B. Federation of
Australia, Mr. C. R. Hansen, said:
It is my privilege today to address
you as your President. I accept this
privilege with a good deal of pleasure,
because it does give me an opportunity
of expressing my appreciation of the
trust that you have reposed in me
during the past twelve months.
Last year we took stock of our Fed-
eration, and we decided that the time
had arrived for it to take a more ac-
tive and virile part in national affairs,
particularly as they relate to the build-
ing industry. I hope that the account
that you will receive of the steward-
ship of your Executive during the year
will meet with your approval, and that
you will, in fact, be satisfied that we
have endeavoured at least to fulfil the
task allotted to us at our last Conven-
tion.
Over the years the Federation has
meant much to the building industry
of Australia, and in this connection I
am reminded of the Presidential Ad-
dress delivered by the first President of
this Association, Mr. R. C. Browne, in
1890; coincidentally, in our city of
Melbourne. Mr. Browne, after dwel-
ling upon the reasons which actuated
the builders of New South Wales,
Queensland, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia in forming the Federation, said:
“If the organisation gets no further
than an annual interchange of ideas
and experiences between the various
Australasian colonies on matters gen-
erally affecting the interests of the
trade, it shall have accomplished
enough to repay us for the time taken
up and the expense incurred; and,
should a crisis arise when we are wide-
ly separated necessitating united ac-
tion, we shall be better prepared for
having met and learned each other’s
views previously.” Continuing, Mr.
Browne said that it was “not intend-
ed to make hard and fast rules to bind
associations. Resolutions which would
be passed must be taken as advice
which, embodying the wisdom of the
trusted men of the associations repre-
sented, no doubt will command the
respectful attention of builders gen'
erally, and, in most instances, be fob
lowed.” Continuing in this theme,
he further said: “In this age of or'
ganisation it is our duty and our priv'
ilege to associate, and it would be
even suicidal on the part of the fob
lowers of any calling not to combine;
but apart from loyalty to vital prim
ciples, the greatest latitude to mem'
bers should be allowed. It should
never be forgotten that we associate
for our personal advantage, and that
if laws are passed without considera-
tion of the injurious effects they may
have on the individual welfare of
members they are likely to have no
hold on the weaker members whom
they are perhaps designed to help,
and will have the effect of causing
those who possess sufficient strength
and tact to hold their own in the con'
tests of life to question whether they
are not paying too high a price for
the privileges of membership by so
often being bound to follow a course
which they regard as conflicting with
their own interests. This Federated
Association will rather lighten our
burdens of this kind than increase
them. It aims at securing uniformity
of action among builders throughout
the colonies, and such action as shall
conduce to their interest without in'
terference with the rights of others.”
These were words of wisdom in'
deed, laying down a basis on which
the Federation has prospered. We
have seen how, over the years, the
meeting together annually for the ex'
change of the views of which Mr.
Browne spoke has stood the builders
of Australia in good stead when
crises arose and necessitated united ac'
tion; even though the headquarters
of affiliated associations were widely
flung over three million square miles
of continent.
Even at that early conference. Con'
ditions of Contract were discussed;
and, as an example of the state of
affairs which existed before we be'
came federated, let me quote one
clause from the Conditions of Con'
tract then existing in Victoria, and to
which reference was made at one of
those early meetings:
“Should there be any variance or
discrepancy between the drawings and
specifications, the architect may use
either to interpret the other, and the
work shall be executed in accordance
with such interpretation without any
additional charge to the proprietor;
and should there be any doubt as to
the intended manner of executing any
part of the works, the contractor shall
be held to have calculated for the work
being done in the best manner, and
shall perform the same in such manner
and of such material as the architect

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


may direct. The contract price is to
be taken to include everything which
in the opinion of the architect is ne-
cessary for the thorough completion
and stability of the works.”
Nowadays, as the result of the ef-
forts of our Federation, we have a
uniform set of Conditions of Con-
tract, not only in respect of general
tendering but for Cost Plus work,
which I believe is generally equitable
in protecting the interests of the
Master Builder, the Architect, and his
client. Not only are those Conditions
in existence but they axe universally
used throughout the Commonwealth
for the purpose of private building.
We have made no claim that their
use be confined to the members of
our respective bodies. That, I sug-
gest, is in a measure our service to
the national interest.
To meet changing circumstances
and conditions, these Conditions are
sufficiently flexible to permit of alter-
ation in consultation with our friends
the members of tffie Royal Australian
Institute of Architects, and, in fact,
I understand that there will be certain
proposals put before this meeting cal-
culated to improve them.
The first real crisis came in the
early part of the century, when the
famous builders’ labourers’ case called
for united action on the part of the
builders of Australia; that case is now
history but it did serve to prove the
value of federation, because the build-
ers of Australia were able on a united
basis to take their case to the Privy
Council and win—and at that time,
and for many years subsequently, the
winning of that case meant a great
deal to the industry.
Many other examples could be quot-
ed of federation working in the inter-
ests of the builder, and, I suggest, in
the national interest. Many of you
will remember how during the last
war builders were being called upon
to give of their best to the nation in
varying States under varying condi-
tions, which led only to confusion. As
a result of the efforts of the Federa-
tion, a uniform set of Conditions,
which operated throughout Australia,
were adopted for the carrying out of
this type of work under the now fa-
mous Allied Works Council.
There have been instances where,
in the industrial field, the Federation,
whilst not registered as an industrial
union of employers in the Common-
wealth Arbitration Court (although
we have amended our constitution to
provide for this, should we consider
it desirable) has provided a channel
for the interchange of views and ideas,
so that the interested affiliated associa-
tions could make a united approach
to the Court. Not always have the
views on industrial matters been in
agreement among various affiliated as-
sociations; but always have conflict-
ing opinions been resolved in a spirit
of conciliation, based on the under-
standing of the other fellow’s problem.
This has been possible, I suggest to
you, because goodwill established by
this Federation among the various
builders’ associations throughout Aus-
tralia is continually present in the
background.
I come now to a further theme in
Mr. Browne’s original Presidential Ad-
dress, and that concerns the liberty
of the individual. I believe that the
words of wisdom that he spoke then
still hold true today, not only in re-
gard to associations but to individ-
uals. It is with the maintenance of
principles that we are concerned; but
in the maintenance of those principles,
and in the protection of the other
fellow’s interests, we must be careful
not to destroy the liberty of the indi-
vidual. Some of the rules of our Fed-
eration and Associations must of ne-
cessity become basic, and all who are
members of our Federation must of
necessity subscribe to them; there is no
place in our various organisations for
the renegade who would break down
all those principles for which the giants
of the past have fought so successfully;
but at the same time we must be care-
ful, I believe, not to make our rules
and the obligations that we impose on
our members too restrictive. The bus-
iness of building is a highly competi-
tive one, and the spirit of adventure
calculated to take reasonable risk per-
meates it to a greater extent than any
other of which I have knowledge.
Competition is our strength, and we
must always endeavour to preserve it
to the fullest extent consistent with
equity and justice to all concerned.
It is not good, however, that we
should dwell too much in the past, for
over the last sixty years great changes
have taken place. When this Federa-
tion was formed there was no Federal
Arbitration Court; there were no
State industrial enterprises, nor to any
great extent was that money-wasting
policy known as Day Labour in gen-
eral practice. At the genesis of this
Federation every State of the Com-
monwealth was under a Liberal Gov-
ernment. Today, not only have we a
Federal Arbitration Court but each
State has its own Industrial Tribunals,
and we have Governments almost uni-
versally espousing Day Labour, with
all the costiliness and inefficiency that
it breeds. And may I say here that
even the Parliamentary Committee
that was set up recently to investigate
Public Accounts were apparently
shocked at the wastefulness of public
funds brought about by the purchase
of plant and equipment, and in the
conduct of public works by Day La-
bour.
During the past year, I believe that
we improved, or should I say enhanc-
ed, the good relations that we have
with our fellows the members of the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects. We met them in Canberra in
MELBOURNE HEADQUARTERS OF THE M.B.A. OF VICTORIA.
The modern new premises of the M.B.A. of Victoria, in Clarendon Street, East Mel-
bourne, where the Coronation Convention was held. With every facility for mem-
bers, and spacious meeting rooms and offices out of the inner city area, these prem-
ises offer a new standard of service for Victorian Master Builders and Exchange
members.

a spirit of goodwill and conciliation,
and discussed several common prob-
lems, and, arising out of those dis-
cussions, we reached conclusions which
I believe will find common accept-
ance throughout Australia, and make
for the more amicable working of our
industry, with consequent advantage
to the person whom we must never
forget—the building owner —who in
the final analysis must always find the
money which permits us to build.
One important principle that we did
enunciate concerning agreements, and
which previously had given rise to
misunderstanding, was that all agree-
ments between our respective organis-
ations constitute a joint recommenda-
tion by our respective bodies to the
building owner, as indicating to him
the best, fairest and most economical
way of carrying out a building con-
tract. That, I believe, is a sound
principle, which in no way impairs
the right of either the architects or
the builders to consider their posi-
tions should the client reject their
joint advice. It had been contended
that architects could not commit a
future and an unknown client to con-
ditions which had been contrived by
two other parties. To this argument
there was some substance; but it must
always be remembered that the build-
ing public looks to such organisations
as this Federation and the Royal Aus-
tralian Institute of Architects for lead-
ership. Failure to accept that leader-
ship would amount to failure in our
duty.
We have reasonable Conditions of
Contract; we have evolved a Quant-
ity Agreement with the R.A.1.A.,
wjiich must be given a fair trial; and
the industry is well organised indus-
trially; what then of the future? The
most important problem, I suggest,
that confronts us is that of building
costs and the stabilisation thereof. The
past twelve months have seen some at-
tempts at stabilisation, aM it is hoped
that the recent decision oi the Federal
Arbitration Court in regard to the
basic wage will do much to bring
about that measure of stabilisation that
will enable us to get back to firm lump
sum tendering which was the life
blood of our industry for so .many
years, making for keen costing and en-
gendering good workmanship. Unfor-
tunately, however, I do not believe
that costs have as yet become sufficient-
ly stable to enable us to engage in firm
lump sum tendering in respect of jobs
which would extend over a long per-
iod. So it was that during the year
your Executive enunciated the prin-
ciple that a Rise and Fall clause be
incorporated in all contracts, with the
proviso that such clause be not ap-
plied in the event of the contract
time being fixed at six months or less.
It is my earnest hope that conditions
in our industry will return to the
stability that would warrant our dis-
pensing with a Rise and Fall clause
as soon as possible.
Tools at our disposal and the de-
velopment of new forms of construc-
tion demand that the builder, no
matter how successful he may be, must
always remain a student, in that he
must keep abreast of new methods of
construction to enable him to com-
pete with his fellows, and to keep the
cost structure within economical
bounds. Today we have available to
us earth-moving equipment, mechani-
cal tools, prefabrication, and new
forms of construction such as pre-
stressed concrete, which we must learn
to assess and apply. It is true that
even these new developments may,
under certain circumstances, be less
economical than older methods and
older forms; but to dismiss them gen-
erally as not being applicable in Aus-
tralia for this reason or that reason
is born of smugness and inertia inhib-
iting the march of progress. Such an
approach eventually must engulf those
who do not keep in step with it.
We must study industrial conditions
and co-operate with our Governments
in helping them to guide the destinies
of the nation and the industry. To
that end I believe that our Federation
has taken a step forward during the
past two years, if only for the reason
that we have won greater recognition
from Commonwealth Departments in
being consulted concerning the prob-
lems which they have to solve. As
one example during the past twelve
months, let me quote the action of
the Department of Labour and Na-
tional Service in seeking the opinion
of our Federation in commenting upon
proposals concerning a number of im-
portant items, including guaranteed
wages in the building industry, which
will be discussed at the 4th session
of the Building, Civil Engineering and
Public Works Committee of the In-
ternational Labour Organisation to be
held in Geneva within a few weeks.
It has also asked the Federation for
advice upon the selection of a repre-
sentative of private construction in-
dustry at this session, and I am pleas-
ed to say that the nomination of Mr.
Manuel R. Hornibrook, our distin-
guished Past President, has been ac-
cepted by the Government. I am
sure that no better representative of
the Australian building industry could
be found. Sometimes we are apt to
dismiss these international conferences
as being gatherings held in Europe
which do not concern Australia direct-
ly because-of our isolation, and which
provide trips for some lucky Austra-
lian. That, I suggest to you, is dang-
erous thinking, for I can assure you
that our friends our employees follow
the discussions and the recommenda-
tions of those conferences very close-
ly. They see to it that Australia from
the employees’ point of view is ade-
quately represented, and if we trace
the genesis of many costly privileges
that have become part of our awards
we find that they are in the recom-
mendations of these international meet-
ings, to which employers have sub-
scribed by default.
It is our duty to the nation to think
internationally in these matters, in or-
der that we may combat those of the
proposals which we do not consider
to be in the best interests of our in-
dustry.
We, together with our good friends
the Royal Australian Institute of Ar-
chitects are banded together in Fed-
eral organisations, which are fully rep-
resentative of our callings throughout
the length and breadth of this great
Commonwealth. Not all employers’
organisations have been able to estab-
lish so representative in character of
the whole of their industries as have
we builders. Great then is our respon-
sibility in preserving and cherishing
this Federation, which our forebears
built on such solid foundations, in or-
der that we and our children may
reap the benefit.
C. R. HANSEN,
President.
Adoption of Report.
Moving the adoption of the Presi-
dent’s Report, the Senior Vice-Presi-
dent, Mr. T. R. Lipscombe (Tas.),
said it was amazing to learn that build-
ers in 1890 were ahead of builders of
today in political thought by banding
together before the advent of Austra-
lia’s own Federation in 1900.
Mr. Lipscombe declared that the
time had come when the M.B.F. of
A. must go before the Courts as an
authoritative body and formulate Fed-
eral awards, which all States must
come under “for their common good.’’
He said that 10 different tribunals
were setting up different standards
and awards for the Commonwealth.
“While this goes on, there will be
a certain amount of chaos in the
building industry,” Mr. Lipscombe
added.
He commended the Federal Presi-
dent, Mr. C. R. Hansen, for having
done a “great job” on behalf of the
Australian building industry. (Ap-
lause.)
Following the reading and receipt
of the President’s address, the Secre-
tary’s report was received and adopt-
ed.
The Treasurer’s Report disclosed
that the Federation finances were
“very healthy,” and the Assistant
Treasurer, Mr. R. J. Nurse (S.A.),
was warmly commended for the pre-
paration and presentation of the re-
port.

Executive Report.
In presenting the Report of the
Federal Executive for 1952-53, the
Federal President, Mr. C. R. Hansen,
said:
During the past year your Executive
met on two occasions and discussed
matters of considerable importance to
the industry, and as the outcome of
one of these meetings certain agree-
ments were reached with the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects
which it is hoped will be reflected in
improved relationship with the Royal
Australian Institute and in the better-
ment of working conditions for master
builders.
Finance.
At the first of its meetings held in
Melbourne in February last, your
Executive gave consideration to the
question of finance, and decided that
in future a budget would be prepared
prior to each Convention, and an as-
sessment of fees circulated to affiliated
associations to permit of consideration
being given to proposals during the
ensuing Convention. This has been
done this year, and it is hoped later
in the Convention that this matter
will be considered in the light of any
discussion that has already taken place
among affiliated associations on the
Executive proposals.
Executive Officers.
During the year certain proposals
were put forward by the Master Build-
ers’ Association of N.S.W. concerning
the alteration of the Constitution, but,
after giving full consideration to the
proposals of the N.S.W. Association,
the Executive suggested that the
N.S.W. Association should frame a
suitable resolution embodying their
ideas for consideration at this Con-
vention. This resolution has been
placed upon the Agenda for consid-
eration.
Quantities.
Whilst the foregoing matters con-
cerned the internal working of the
Federation, the matter of quantities
loomed large in your Executive’s con-
sideration, particularly as some diffi-
culty had arisen following a letter
that the Federation had received from
the Royal Australian Institute of Ar-
chitects enunciating as a principle that
no architect could bind a future client
to terms and conditions under which
he might desire to erect a building.
This principle affected the whole

question of agreements between ar'
chitects and builders, and all matters
considered at the joint conference be'
tween the Federation Executive and
Mr. Lewis Burne, has played in the
the Council of the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects were related to
this principle. The .matter, it is be'
lieved, was successfully resolved by
both bodies subscribing to the prin'
ciple that all agreements between the
respective organisations be on the
basis that they constitute a joint re-
commendation to the building public
as the most equitable and economical
manner of entering into a building
contract.
On this basis the following agree'
ment in relation to Quantities was
reached between the two bodies:
(a) The Federation and the R.A.
LA. approve of the principle that the
provision of Quantities is of advantage
to all parties to a building contract.
(b) The Federation and the R.A.
LA. agree to the adoption of the
principle that:
(1) Quantities should be provided
in respect of all residential work for
all jobs in excess of £IO,OOO in value,
for which there are more than 6 tend'
erers or for which public tenders are
called.
(2) Quantities should be provided
for all work in excess of £15,000
where there are more than 6 tenderers.
(3) Quantities should be provided
for work, other than residential, in
excess of £12,000, where there are
more than four tenderers or for which
public tenders are called.
(4) Quantities should be provided
for work other than residential of
more than £20,000 in value, where
there are more than four tenderers.
(5) Quantities for work of a repeti'
tive character in excess of the limit
be a matter for negotiation between
the State Chapters of the R.A.I.A.
and the Associations affiliated with the
Federation where doubts arise.
Cost Plus and Rise and Fall
Adjustment Formula.
During the year agreement was
reached between the M.B.A. of Vic'
toria and Royal Victorian Institute of
Architects upon a formula which those
respective bodies decided to recom-
mend to their members for the assess'
ment of Rises and Falls in a contract
where the Rise and Fall clause ap'
plied. Your Executive considered this
formula at one of its meetings, and
following discussion with the Council
of the R.A.I.A. the latter body agreed
to draw the attention of its members
to the formula for their information.
It was obvious at the joint confer'
ence that the Federal Architects were
not prepared to reach final agreement
on the adoption of the formula for re'
commendation to their members, the
matter being left to their discretion
for adoption or otherwise.
In considering the formula, the view
was expressed by Mr. C. E. Thomp'
son (N.S.W.) that it was capable of
simplification, and it was suggested
by your Executive that in the ratifi'
cation of the formula by the Conven'
tion the simplifications by Mr.
Thompson be considered and embod'
ied.
The simplifications were placed be'
fore the President of the R.A.1.A.,
but he preferred that the formula as
agreed between the Victorian archi'
tects and builders should be allowed
to stand.
Both the original formula and Mr.
Thompson’s suggestion for its sim'
plification have been circulated to af'
filiated associations, and it is sug'
gested that the Conference may give
some further thought to the matter.
Coloured Plans.
The Executive also gave considera'
tion to a request from the M.B.A. of
N.S.W. for assistance in placing be'
fore the Council of the R.A.I.A. a
refusal by the N.S.W. Chapter of that
body to an Association request for
the supply of coloured drawings for
at least one week, and uncoloured
helios to replace those coloured draw'
ings in the preparation of tenders
for contracts in excess of £IOO,OOO.
The R.A.I.A. Council agreed to sug'
gest to the N.S.W. Chapter that the
matter be reopened with the M.B.A.
of N.S.W. It is understood that since
then the matter has been successfully
resolved.
International Labour Office.
During the year the Federation was
requested by the Department of La'
hour and National Service to com'
ment upon a reply prepared by the
Department for the International La'
hour Office on the question of guar'
anteed wages in Australia. The Fed'
eration suggested certain amendments
to the prepared statement which were
subsequently embodied by the De'
partment.
It is with some gratification also that
your Executive has to report that the
Department has requested the Fed'
eration to confer with the Federal
Council of Building Industry Con'
gresses with a view to making a nom-
ination of a delegate to attend the
4th Session of the Building, Civil
Engineering and Public Works Com'
mittee 0f‘1.L.0., and to that end your
Executive has put forward the name
of Mr. Manuel R. Hornibrook, a Past
President of the Federation and of the
Queensland Master Builders’ Associ-
ation.
It is also with gratification that your
Executive has noted the prominent
part that one of its Past Presidents,
Mr. Lewis Burne, has played in the
Councils of the governing body of
1.L.0. as an Australian representative.
Mr. Burne is, in fact, at this moment
attending the Asian Conference of
1.L.0. in Ceylon.
Federal Building Construction Prize
and George A. Taylor Memorial
Prize.
The Federal Building Construction
Prize and the George A. Taylor c Mem'
orial Prize for 1953 were awarded to
Mr. Keith Woodcock, of Newcastle,
to whom the congratulations of the
Federation were offered.
This year the examination will be
held on October 14 and 15, and the
papers have been set and will be ex'
amined under the auspices of the
M.B.A. of Victoria, in pursuance of
the resolution carried at the last Con'
vention.
Obituary.
It is with profound regret that your
Executive has to record the death
during the year of Mr. Fred. Wilson,
0.8. E., F. 1.0.8., F.1.A.8., a Past
President of the Federation, and for
many years its Honorary Secretary.
No passing reference to the death of
Mr. Wilson would suffice in this re'
port, because his contributions to the
welfare of the industry over many
years were so outstanding. They war'
rant the special appreciation of the
Industry throughout Australia.

Reports of Affiliated Associations.
The Presidents of the seven Master
Builders’ Associations attending the
Convention then presented their An-
nual Reports. These were: N.S.W.,
South Australia, Queensland, Victoria,
Tasmania, Western Australia, and
Newcastle.
(The Northern Territory and the
A.C.T. were not represented on this
occasion.)
These reports will appear in subse'
quent issues of this journal.
Adoption of Reports.
Moving the adoption of the reports,
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.) said
that all reports tabled at the Convem
tion disclosed that the building indus'
try was in a virile position and doing
fairly well. The reports proved that
it could look after itself “if it does
not get overridden by bad legisla'
tion.”
Late Mr. Fred. Wilson.
Prior to the discussion of the re'
ports, the Federal President, Mr. C.
R. Hansen, made feeling reference to
the late Mr. Fred. Wilson, who was
President of the Master Builders’
Federation of Australia in 1938.
“Fred. Wilson was a friend of all,
and in his lifetime did wonderful work
for the building industry,” Mr. Hansen
said.
“Particularly I refer to Fred
Wilson’s contribution toward the ad'
vance of technical education for build'
ing apprentices in N.S.W.
“This State is far ahead of any
other in Australia, largely owing to
Mr. Wilson’s efforts, and young men
can now obtain a high standard of
technical education.
“Over the years Fred Wilson prov'
ed a tower of strength to successive
presidents of the Federation, and I
am particularly grateful to him for the
support and assistance he gave me,”
Mr. Hansen added.
The Executive and Delegates then
stood in silence as a tribute to the
memory of the late Mr. Wilson.
Discussion of Reports.
The delegates discussed each report
at length, with a view to framing reso-
lutions on matters of importance to
the building industry.
Quantities.
Introducing the question of Quant-
ities, Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.)
suggested that a small committee be
set up to clarify the position with the
Federal Chapter of Architects.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.) said many
builders were taking off quantities for
larger amounts than set down by the
Federation. A serious view should be
taken of this matter, and there was
much room for improvement.
The Victorian M.B.A. had tried to
draw up a formula which would be
satisfactory to all parties.
His Association desired to be loyal
to the Federation, but it believed the
amounts for Quantities should be con'
fiderably increased.
The President, Mr. Hansen, said
the architects had published in their
year book findings and recommenda'
tions regarding quantities to members
of the R.A.I.A.
He felt builders wanted to retain
the system of quantities, and did not
want to jeopardise the principle es'
tablished 30 to 40 years ago. Care
was needed to define the line of deim
arcation, without compromising the
architects as well, Mr. Hansen declar'
ed.
He warned delegates not to jeo-
pardise the position if they wanted to
retain the system of quantities.
Mr. J. B. Hawkins (W.A.) said
the Federation represented all master
builders—big and small —in Austra'
lia, and it must therefore watch their
interests.
Mr. P. Bottomley (N.S.W.) said
there had been a system of quantities
as long as he could remember.
He thought Victoria’s attitude was
quite in keeping with what builders
had been fighting for, during many
years. He suggested that a slight ah
teration in the amounts for quantities
would suit all sections of the build'
ing industry.
Mr. W. J. Bryant (N.S.W.) said
that it was necessary to look at the
question from the public’s point of
view. The time spent taking off
quantities had to be charged to some
job. If it were possible to reduce
overhead costs, it would ultimately
help the tenderers.
He considered that limiting tenders
to four was handicapping the man
who was just starting out in business.
It was in the interests of all build'
ers that quantities be called for all
jobs, so everyone could get an equal
share of all work available.
Mr. R. J. Nurse (S.A.) comment'
ed that quantities were an essential
part of the building industry. He
thought the whole question should be
reframed.
Mr. G. H. Day (Q.) said the Fed'
eration must not leave the gate open
for the various State Associations to
go their own way in the matter of
quantities. All Associations should be
expected to adhere to any decision ar-
rived at.
Mr. D. R. Tait (Tas.) said Tas-
mania had no idea of adhering to re-
commended quantities. His State
could not be bound because architects
there had no setup.
At least 50% of the decent jobs
were the subject of tenders, Mr. Tait
added.
The President, Mr. Hansen, com'
mented that continued pressure would
bring about a change in Tasmania.
Mr. C. F. Gage (N.S.W.) said his
State had always endeavoured to em
sure that quantities were provided for
all tenders.
The interests of the public was
better served by providing quantities
for tenders.
He agreed with the President that
it was necessary to preserve the quam
tides system as the most valuable thing
possible for builders.
The Federation should do every'
thing in its power to preserve quant'
ities and not let it get out of hand and
the amounts increased.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
pointed out that in N.S.W\ a number
of builders spent up to £7OOO a year
tendering for work. This was money
wasted, he declared.
More economy was required in the
building industry.
He felt that the amount of £12,000
or £15,000 was not important in re'
gard to quantities, as long as a prin'
ciple was establishment and abided by.
The matter was then formally clos'
ed by the President.
Cement in Victoria.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.) report'
ed that the cement position in Victoria
had been rectified since the last Com
vention.
Owner-Builders.

BUILDING; LIGHTING; ENGINEERING
October 24, 1953.


introducing the subject of owner-
builders, said the position in N.S.W.
was causing great concern. Owner-
builders about to erect a home read-
ily received loans from various lend-
ing bodies. These bodies should keep
a strict watch on the position, or re-
duce the number of loans to owner-
builders, who did most of the build-
ing themselves.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.), said that
owner-builders in Victoria took on a
different character. According to the
Government Statist, 73% of homes
being constructed in Australia were
being erected by owner-builders, with
the week-end assistance of tradesmen.
It had been agreed by employers
that the week-end period was to be
a rest period, but an alarming number
of tradesmen were doing week-end
work for owner-builders.
These people, Mr. Morris continu-
ed, engaged carpenters to put up their
houses and paid them up to £5/10/0
per day each, and bricklayers were
getting £l6 a thousand to lay bricks
at week-ends.
This had a very bad effect on the
building industry. Owner-builders
were actually paying twice as much to
build their homes as a master builder
would charge them.
This was a grave disservice to the
building industry, as 73% of the
houses were being built at fancy
prices, and the real builder was ex-
cluded, Mr. Morris declared.
He strongly advocated registration
of builders. Architects, electricians,
and plumbers were all registered, but
anyone could act as a builder.
“The effect of this is more far-
reaching than you realise,” Mr.
Morris told delegates.
Sub-Contractors.
Introducing this matter, Mr. G. H.
Fricker (S.A.) asked if the Federation
had decided anything uniform regard-
ing Rise and Fall.
A definite stand should be taken
that the whole rise and fall should be
applicable to all sub-contractors.
Mr. F. E. Anderson (Newcastle)
said serious notice should be taken of
the question of Rise and Fall and sub-
contractors.
In N.S.W. particularly, sub-con-
tractors had been a source of worry
to builders, and he hoped the Con-
vention would reach some finality re-
garding the position.
Mr. Anderson praised the Victorian
report. He had been greatly impress-
ed by the great work Mr. T. W,
Morris had been doing for the Fed-
eration and the building industry.
Regarding owner-builders, Mr. An-
derson said the position was wrapped
up to a great extent by co-op. build-
ing societies advancing money for
home building at 3|%.
With the Australian Gas Light Co.
offering 5%, and Sewerage Board
loans at 4§%, one wondered how
money could be borrowed at 3|%?
In fact, building for co-operative
societies had practically come to an
end in N.S.W., Mr. Anderson de-
dared.
The future of building was definite-
ly tied up in the question of home-
building finance and costs, he added.
Mr. D. R. Tait (Tas.) said he
would welcome the co-operation of
the Federation to obtain a uniform
system for all States.
Firm quotes were necessary for all
work, and he hoped the Federation
would ask that sub-contractors be
brought into line on conditions that
builders are now tendering under.
Master builders had to fall into line
with the Federal Government in the
matter of firm prices; sub-contractors
should be made to do likewise, Mr.
Tait said.
Regarding Long Service Leave, he
declared that it was a source of con-
stant worry, and a costly business.
Every M.B.A. had a great respon-
sibility to keep building costs on a
reasonable basis.
If costs became too high, the build-
ing industry would be considerably re-
tarded, Mr. Tait added.
He said N.S.W. suffered under the
burden of Long Service Leave, and
he hoped some forceful speaker
would place before the Governments
and the Press the need to try to re-
tard costs.
Long Service Leave would be un-
fair to Tasmania, which already has a
23A margin above Victoria, Mr. Tait
said.
He hoped the Federation would get
some stabilisation of the building in-
dustry, and particularly in regard to
Long Service Leave.
Daylight Training.
Mr. W. J. Bryant (N.S.W.) said
the Queensland report made mention
of daylight training for apprentices.
He was personally strongly in favour
of that, and declared he would do
everything in his power to raise the
standards of training for building ap-
prentices.
Mr. Bryant said he felt that day-
light training for lads would eventu-
ally greatly benefit the whole industry.
Australian workers were equal, if
not better, than workmen in any other
country.
“It is'up to us to encourage them,”
Mr. Bryant added.
Mr. J. Riordan (Q.) said that the
Unions had abolished evening classes,
and apprentices would not do any in
their own time. All Technical train-
ing was thus done in daytime.
Builders claimed that apprentices
were being trained on the job, but
the unions insisted on daylight train'
ing.
Mr. Riordan warned that agitation
may be started in other States for the
abolition of evening apprenticeship
training.
Mr. W. Fairweather (W.A.) ex'
plained that Technical College night
classes, once compulsory, were now
voluntary in his State.
He was wholeheartedly in favour of
daylight training, but he felt that by
attending night classes the boys gave
some of their own time besides their
employers’ time.
Mr. Fairweather said the industry
in W.A. was suffering from an in'
crease in timber prices caused by rail
freights being increased 7 A a 100
super ft. This had hit the builder
hard.
He asked the Federation to en'
deavour to have an agreement with
the merchants which would cover
builders for any increase in the price
of materials.
Mr. Fairweather said the matter of
Long Service Leave was of “very
great importance” to W.A, His As'
sociation sought information from
other States.
Introduction of Long Service Leave
to W.A. would cause a very big in'
crease in costs to the building industry.
With home'building loans in
W.A. limited to £1750, it was imper'
ative that builders should reduce costs.
Increasing loans from £1750 to
£2500 would help qualified builders
to take on legitimate jobs and thus
eliminate owner'builders, Mr. Fair'
weather added.
Mr. F. E. Anderson (Newcastle)
said Technical training in his city was
similar to that of Sydney—B hours
training each 14 days.
He disagreed with Mr. Riordan
(0 ) that apprentices got full practi'
cal training on the job. Some reoeiv'
ed little or no real training, he said.
“But through technical colleges they
get practical training on overall build'
ing construction.
“In N.Z. an apprentice receives one
week’s training every six months, and
the lad leaves his employer to do it
at the nearest technical college.
“This is not satisfactory, for if the
boy is ill, he loses his week’s training.
“The N.S.W. training scheme
works very well,” Mr. Anderson add'
ed.
Explaining owner' builder draw'
backs in S.A., Mr. G. F. Brimble'
combe (S.A.) said that a Home Build'
ers’ Club in his State was very active
building homes at weekends.
Owner' builders who have already
completed their houses assist others in
the Club to erect homes.
This had proved to be of great det'

riment to building standards. An own-
er with no experience would employ
tradesmen to do a very poor class of
work.
Although the position was now on
the decline it was still causing a great
deal of concern, Mr. Brimblecombe
added.
Mr. H. F. Sarah (S.A.) spoke of
the apprenticeship position in his
State, and said that 8 hours per fort-
night or four hours per week even-
ing training was compulsory.
Apprentices received an extra 2/6d.
per week on producing a school at-
tendance certificate and an extra 2/6d
a week after passing classes.
Mr. Sarah congratulated all States
on their reports “which show optim-
ism in regard to the future of the in-
dustry.”
Mr. W. ]. Bryant (N.S.W.) said
he viewed with alarm the information
that the Queensland Unions had
worked to have night training abol-
ished.
“It would be tragic if the people
of Australia just learn while the em-
ployer pays them,” Mr. Bryant de-
clared.
He said that in N.S.W. the builder
pays all technical training fees. If the
boy won’t bother to learn the em-
ployer still has to pay his fee for five
years.
“Unfortunately, there is no penalty
for the boy not being industrious,”
Mr. Bryant commented.
Regarding owner-builders, he said
owner- builders were a very big prob-
lem in N.S.W. where they received en-
couragement from the Labour Gov-
ernment.
“Some months ago the N.S.W.
Government set up a Homes Advis-
ory Bureau under the Housing Com-
mission where people could go to re-
ceive alleged advice on home build-
ing,” Mr. Bryant said.
Building societies who once lent
money were now reluctant to do so,
for in many cases owner-builders had
sold their homes a few months after
they had completed them, contrary to
their agreements, he added.
Mr. G. Dell (Tas.) said the Ap-
prenticeship Commission made trainees
attend school for 8 hours a fortnight.
Reports were given as to attendance,
diligence, etc., of the lad, and the
Commission can terminate his appren-
ticeship if necessary.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.)
congratulated the States on the num-
ber of apprentices. He felt the in-
crease was a step in the right direc-
tion.
Mr. Kennedy said he had long tak-
en an active interest in matters of ap-
prenticeship, and he had interviewed
officials at Australia House, London,
regarding prospects of obtaining
building tradesmen for Australia.
He was informed that families
would come if suitable premises were
available.
However, England had a very big
building programme and was not anx-
ious to send tradesmen to Australia.
The Commonwealth should concen-
trate on training its own tradesmen,
Mr. Kennedy added.
The President, Mr. Hansen, com-
mented that it was obvious daylight
training should operate throughout
Australia. However, it would be de-
plorable if boys failed to give their
employers something in return.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.)
said he thought it desirable that his
State should retain the status quo in
regard to the training of building ap-
prentices. N.S.W. would fight to re-
tain both daylight and evening classes,
he added.
Mr. J. Riordan (Q.) supported Mr.
Thompson in regard to night train-
ing, and said he was strongly opposed
to the whole training being done in
the employers’ time.
A motion on these lines was
carried.
Rise and Fall.
There was considerable discussion
regarding rise and fall clauses in con-
tracts, and Mr. Tait (Tas.) asked the
President if the recent conference be-
tween the Federation and architects
had decided upon a six or 12 months
period being included in all contracts,
Queensland delegates supported a
six months period being included in
all contracts, as being long enough to
go without rise and fall.
“We will support the Federation on
a six months basis,” Mr. J. A. J.
Dredge (Q.) said.
The delegates agreed with the steps
already taken by the Federation re*
garding rise and fall.
Amendment of Constitution.
Consideration was given a notice
of motion for the amendment of the
Constitution submitted by the M.B.A.
of N.S.W.
“That Clause 11 of the Constitution
of the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia be deleted and the following
new clause be inserted:
“The Executive of the Federation
shall consist of one representative
nominated by each of the six recog'
nised State Associations affiliated with
the Federation, provided that at all
times such nominated representatives
shall be mutually acceptable to the
Federation and the affiliated State As'
sociation responsible for his nomin'
ation. From among these nominated
representatives there shall be elected at
each Convention a President, two
Vice-Presidents, a Treasurer, an As-
sistant Treasurer, whilst the immedi-
ate Past President of the Federation
shall remain an ex officio member of
the Executive and the ex officio rep-
resentative on the Executive of the
Federation of the affiliated Associa-
tion of which he is a member. Any
three members of the Executive at
any meeting shall form a quorum, and
the senior officer present shall act
as Chairman.”
Discussion on the procedure for
amending the Constution resulted in
the matter being referred to the Reso-
lutions Committee.
Smoko Periods.
Mr. J. Riordan (Q.) said that
smoko periods resulted in the loss of
30 minutes a day.
He moved that builders resist any
move to give employees extra time to
put their tools of trade away.
This was carried on the voices.
War Service Homes.
Mr. J. A. J. Dredge (0 ) intro-
duced the question of War Service
Homes Warranty Clause and asked for
a discussion.
This was a Federal matter, and the
Convention should deal with it on a
Federal basis, he said.
The clause was long-standing and
there had been nothing done about it
over the years, Mr. Dredge added.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.) said the
Victorian M.B.A. would come in
“thick and heavy” to back Queens-
land regarding the warranty clause.
“There is no doubt that it is being
misused. It was never meant for pur-
poses of maintenance work,” Mr,
Morris declared.
He said that if there was any item
of maintenance outstanding, the Divi-
sion claimed the right to have it done

of Australia, 1953-54.

after the expiry of the 13 weeks’
maintenance period.
Further, it claimed the right to or'
der work done even after 12 months.
The quality referred to in the clause
was the quality of goods used during
construction, Mr. Morris continued.
The Division was making dishonest
use of the Warranty Clause for the
purpose of holding up payments to
builders.
Mr. Morris related his personal ex-
periences with the War Service Homes
Division, and he said he spoke for
all builders when he claimed they did
not seek special privileges.
They did not want to do shoddy
work; neither did they want work on
shoddy conditions. The Victorian As'
sociation was prepared to go to Court
and fight the Commonwealth on the
business of withholding payments for
work done.
Mr. Morris declared that it was time
the W.S.H. Division was taught a
lesson on straightforward dealing,
without trickery.
“The M.B.A. of Victoria views with
grave concern the way Conditions of
Contract are being interpreted by the
Division,” Mr. Morris said.
He added that the Division de'
manded that work should be done
long after the 13 weeks maintenance
period had expired. An emphatic
protest should be made to the Depart'
ment on this matter.
It should be informed that builders
expect to do their work correctly, and
having done that work correctly, the
builder should be paid for it.
Mr. Morris pointed out that several
cases of bankruptcy in Victoria had
been caused by the W.S.H. Division
not paying promptly.
The Convention should take up
the question with the Minister for So'
cial Services, and if necessary, with
the Prime Minister. (Applause.)
Mr. Morris said he undertook to
build 150 War Service Homes to heln
out the housing shortage. He had
felt obliged to do this as his duty
to Australia.
But so far he had not received a
fair deal for his efforts, from the Dh
vision.
Mr F. E. Anderson (Newcastle)
said his Association fully supported
Victoria. He related an experience of
a co'op. building society bringing an
inspector from Sydney to look at
jobs two years after completion.
His Association agreed that some'
thing should be done to bring matters
to a head, even if it meant taking
proceedings in a Court of Law.
Otherwise the Government would
hold builders responsible for jobs
for ever, Mr. Anderson added.
In West Australia, builders were
gradually getting out of building
War Service Homes, Mr. W. Fair'
weather (W.A.) said.
His Association would strongly sup'
port Queensland and Victoria on
their efforts to get a better deal for
builders.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.) said
.his Association would also lend its
support.
Mr. W. J. Bryant (N.S.W.) ex'
plained the general position with the
W.S.H. Division in N.S.W.
There was a reasonably good liaison
between the Department and builders,
and relations were on a reasonable
basis, he said.
Mr. G. H. Fricker (S.A.) said his
Association would support all other
States in their drive for a better deal,
and Mr. J. B. Hawkins (W.A.) also
supported the previous speakers.
(The question of War Service
Homes was reopened later in the
Convention.)
Conditions of Contract.
The M.B.A. of N.S.W. sought dis'
cussion by delegates on certain
clauses in the form of Contract E 2,
which have proved either inadequate
or unfair to the builder.
The N.S.W. submissions said:
Clause 15 (a) —Insurance.
During the period of inflation (and
no one can be certain that this prob'
lem has reached its peak), the condi'
tions set out in this Clause were gross'
ly unfair to builders. We recommend
that this clause should be deleted and
that Clause 10 of the Cost Plus
Agreement (Edition Cl, Ist January,
1952) be substituted.
Clause 21 (1) (b) —Nominated
Sub-contractors.
In the event of the proprietor fail'
ing to meet his obligations, under
this Clause, the nominated sub'con'
tractor can, and frequently has, re'
ceived his claim at Law against the
builder, and this position is further
aggravated by Clause 21 (1) (h) and
21 (2), wherein, for the doubtful re'
muneration of of the accounts,
the proprietor can impose on the
builder or extend the contract in this
direction without limit, with disastrous

results to the builder should the pro-
prietor be unable to meet his obliga-
tions.
We desire to recommend that
Clause 21 (1) (b), by substituting the
words “7 days of receiving payment
for the proprietor of any sub-contract-
or’s account, included in a certificate
from the Architect approving the
value of such work, materials or goods
less only in retention money which
the builder may be entitled to deduct,
in lieu of the last two lines of the sub-
clause commencing “14 days of re-
ceiving from the architect, etc.
Clause 21 (1) (d).
On the fourth line after the word
“payment” the words “subject to
Clause 21 (1) (b)” should be added.
Should these suggestions be unac-
ceptable to the Royal Australian In-
stitute of Architects, we feel that it
may be necessary to ask for the elim-
ination of Clauses 21 (1) (h) and
21 (2) from this Contract Form and
these matters could then be negotiated
as a separate contract.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.)
moved that negotiations take place
between the Federal Executive and the
Council of the R.A.I.A. with a view
to having Clause 15(a) in Conditions
of Contract altered to ensure that the
builder is covered for the total
amount. (Carried.)
Long Service Leave.
Mr. K. C. McGregor (N.S.W.)
suggested that the State Presidents
and the Federation Executive should
comprise a committee to further in-
vestigate the question of Long Ser-
vice Leave.
Guaranteed Trust.
Mr. T. W. Morris (Vic.) outlined
a proposal for a Trust Guarantee
Group to guarantee to architects and
owners that work will be completed
to the satisfaction of an independent
tribunal.
Should a builder be unable to com-
plete the work the contract will be
completed by the M.B.A. of Victoria,
which in turn will be backed by an in-
surance company.
Mr. Morris said that Victoria’s in-
dependent move to form a Guaranteed
Trust Group would protect all parties
in building.
Mr. K. McGregor (N.S.W.) said
the Federation should give the very
strongest support to any move to sub-
stitute performance bonds for security
bonds or deposits.
Speaking in support of Mr. Me-
gregor, Mr. P. Bottomley (N.S.W.)
said that the matter was of vital in-
terest to all Associations, and the ques-
tion of performance bonds was quite
a good one.
He was pleased to know that Vic-
toria was supporting a recommenda-
tion to the Federation.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W.)
said a scheme such as the one present'
ed by the M.B.A. of Victoria would
raise that Association to such a status
that it would set the seal on all good
work.
“I feel that the scheme will achieve
as much as would registration of build'
ers by any Government.
“I heartily endorse the plan,” Mr.
Thompson added.
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook (Q.), said
that many years ago it was customary
for architects in Queensland to ask
for deposits for work.
Delegates should see that such did
not happen in their own States.
There should not be deposits de'
manded when builders tendered for
private work, Mr. Hornibrook added.
Mr. Morris said he realised that
when he introduced the Guaranteed
Trust for full investigation by the Fed'
eration, that valuable oipinions would
be given as to its merits.
He gave an assurance that Victoria
would keep other Associations fully
informed on developments.
Such a plan could well be the fore'
runner of registration of builders in
the industry, as Mr. Thompson said.
A great deal also depended upon
the cooperation of the architects as
well, Mr. Morris added.
War Service Homes.
The discussion on War Service
Homes was re'opened when Mr.
Morris read a letter he had just re-
ceived from the Division.
The letter said that inquiries had
failed to disclose where contractors
were dissatisfied with the conduct of
the Division.
The writer said the special mainten'
ance period of 13 weeks was often ex'
ceeded because the contractor had fail'
ed to do the work before the period
expired.
In the future the penalty clause
would be strictly enforced, the letter
added.
Mr. Morris commented that the
letter was not true to fact.
“If you read between the lines it is
clear that a lot of the complaints from
builders are correct and well-founded.
“Is there any reason why the main-
tenance period cannot be closed off?
“The Division holds back the money
to force the builder to do mainten-
ance,” Mr. Morris declared.
He said one War Service Home oc-
cupier lodged a complaint about a
dripping tap two years after the house
was built! (Laughter.)
“That gives you some idea of the
silly complaints lodged by tenants.
“We are prepared to give them a
fair deal, but we expect the W.S.H.
Division to give us a fair deal in re-
turn,” Mr. Morris added.
He suggested that the Federation
seek a discussion with the authorities
on a Federal basis.
Mr. C. E. Thompson (N.S.W)
suggested that the whole question be
taken up with the Federal Minister
for Social Services.
Mr. J. Riordan (0 ) said the Fed'
eration should take the matter up on
a Federal basis.
It was decided that Victoria, in its
reply to the Division, will advise that
the Federation will take up the whole
question of War Service Homes on a
Federal basis, and will seek discussions
with the Minister and Director.
Quantities.
There was considerable discussion on
the question of Quantities, which the
Federation and the R.A.I.A. recently
conferred upon, and agreed to the
principle that:
Quantities should be provided ac'
cording to the class of work and tend'
ers called from £ 10,000 upwards and
work of a repetitive character by ne'
gotiation with the R.A.I.A.
Some amendments which were sug'
gested by various delegates were re'
ferred to the Resolutions Committee
for consideration.
Incentive Scheme.
Mr. S. D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.),
spoke upon the subject of an Incen-
tive scheme for Australia, and especi'
ally for the building industry.
He said he saw such a scheme in
operation with the well-known Eng'
lish Master Builder, Mr. R. O. Lloyd,
and he was greatly impressed with its
possibilities for Australia.
Mr. Kennedy said that the Federa'
tion should consider it in the near
future.
During their visits to England,
Messrs. Percy Bottomley, T. M. Lips'
combe, and T. W. Morris had met Mr.
Lloyd and saw at first hand the extern
sive building work he does.
Mr. Kennedy said the scheme was
very successful in the north of Eng'
land and on the Continent.
The trade unions of England, to'
gether with the employers and em-
ployees, were most cooperative and
the whole scheme is producing excel'
lent results in housing people more
quickly and economically.
I feel the building industry should
consider it.
I believe this incentive payment
scheme would work very well in Aus'
tralia, and I will make a full report
next February,” Mr. Kennedy added.
Rise and Fall.
Following further discussion on this
matter, delegates agreed to adopt the
Victorian formula.
The M.B.A. of Victoria and the
Royal Victorian Institute of Archi-
tects made an agreement in relation
to Costs Adjustments on Fixed Sum
Contracts. The agreement provides

Resolutions.
Resolutions passed on the closing
day of the Convention dealt with:
• War Service Homes. It was
decided to point out the unfair treat-
ment received by builders and to ask
for speedy payment. The Department
will be asked to issue instructions that
the Warranty Clause be interpreted
correctly.
• Wages and Conditions. The Fed-
eration will recommend that each af-
filiated Association will observe in
their entirety the existing work hour
wages and conditions.
• Long Service Leave. The Fed-
eral Executive will consider this ques-
tion, and information will be inter-
changed regarding the operation of
the Act in various States.
• Technical Training. The Federa-
tion desires to retain evening training
for all building training apprentices.
Delegate to Geneva.
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook has been ask-
ed by the Federal Government to
attend the 4th Session of the Build-
ing, Civil Engineering and Public
Works Committee of 1.L.0. in Gen-
eva.
Mr. Hornibrook thanked the Fed-
eration for selecting him to represent
Australia “in the capacity of private
mterprise.”
I want to thank the Federation
,nd the Federal Council of the 8.1. C.
or the very great honour conferred
oon me,” he said.
T assure you that I will do the
best I can for my brother builders
in Australia.” (Applause.)
Amendment to Constitution,
The Resolutions Committee was
unanimous in leaving the matter as
it was, as its present form gives a
faithful interpretation of what is in'
tended.
Clause 11 is to be deleted.
The business of the Agenda was
then concluded.
Election of Officers.
The retiring President, Mr. C. R.
Hansen (Vic.) then relinquished his
seat to the incoming President, Mr.
T. R. Lipscombe (Tas.).
Returning thanks for the honour
conferred upon him, Mr. Lipscombe
said he would spare no effort during
the next 12 months to serve the build'
ing industry faithfully, loyally, and
well.
“By this time next year you will be
able to judge whether or not I have
done a good job.
“I have a full appreciation of my
duties and my responsibilities on be'
half of 3500 Master Builders in six
States.
“I realise the necessity of co'ord'
inating the aims and objects of all
master builders throughout Austra'
lia, and safeguard the Australian pub'
lie,” Mr. Lipscombe added.
Mr. Hansen extended his congratu'
lations to Mr. Lipscombe.
“I hope your year of office is as
happy as mine has been. In fact, it
has been a dashed good one,” he
added.
The Senior Vice'President, Mr. G.
H. Day (Q.) thanked delegates for
his election, and offered his warmest
congratulations to Mr. Lipscombe.
The Junior Vice-president, Mr. S.
D. C. Kennedy (N.S.W.) said he
would strive mightily to serve the
Federation and the industry.
He expressed the warm apprecia-
tion of delegates to Mrs. Hansen and
Mrs. Morris for the hospitality they
had extended to all during a very
memorable visit. (Applause.)
The Treasurer, Mr. R. J. Nurse
(S.A.) and the Assistant-Treasurer,
Mr. W. Fairweather (W.A.) also add'
ed their congratulations to the Execu-
tive and their personal thanks for
their election.
Presentation of Gavel.
The Honorary Vice-President, Mr.
J. B. Hawkins (W.A.) said it was his
pleasing duty to present an inscribed
gavel to the Immediate Past-president,
Mr. C. R. Hansen.
He congratulated Mr. Hansen upon
the meritorious manner in which he
had carried out his duties as Presi-
dent, and said he had added im-
measurably to the stature and stand-
ing of the Federation. (Applause.)
Replying, Mr. Hansen said he had
done his upmost to advance the aims,
objects, and aspirations of the Feder-
ation.
His task had been made easier and
infinitely more pleasant by the loyal
help he had received from the Fed-
eral Executive.
He thanked everyone for their loy-
alty and encouragement. (Applause.)
He extended his personal thanks to
Mr. Tom Morris and Mrs. Morris for
THE LATEST—DOUBLE STILTS.
The use of "stilts" for their buildings has gained great favour in Brazil where it
has become, together with the striking "waffle" facades resulting from the heavily
recessed sun protection treatment, as one of its distinctive features. This new hotel
at Sao Paulo—The Imperator-goes one better and has two storeys of stilts. It is
comparable in scope with Rockefeller Centre, New York, and is typical of a num-
ber of projects on a very large scale which Oscar Niemeyer is currently designing.

their wonderful hospitality during the
Convention.
Replying on behalf of the M.B.A.
of Victoria, Mr. Morris said he had
received a great help from his mem-
bers.
“They are a wonderful band of
fellows, and both builders and Ex-
change members have pulled their
weight to make the Convention a suc-
cess.
“I hope your stay in Victoria will
be one you will long remember,” Mr.
Morris added.

THE PRESIDENT’S DINNER.
Fitting Finale to Coronation
Convention.
The Federal President of the Mast-
:r Builders’ Federation of Australia,
vlr. C. R. Hansen, F.A.1.8., tendered
he Executive, Convention delegates
md visitors a Dinner at Menzies Ho-
el last Thursday night.
Guests of honour included Senator
V. J. Spicer, Q.C., the Lord Mayor
of Melbourne, Councillor R. H. Solly,
the President, R.A.1.A., Mr. R. F.
Demaine, Dr. L. F. Loder, Sir George
Wales, and Messrs. M. R. Hornibrook
(Q.), J. B. Hawkins (W.A.), T. W.
Morris (Vic.), and T. M. Lipscombe
(Tas.).
The attendance at the dinner tot-
allel 120, and the occasion was one
which Mr. Hansen will recall, with
great pride, for many years.
As a fitting finale to a remarkably
successful Coronation Convention, the
dinner was on such a lavish scale
that it can best be described as a
banquet.
In keeping with the Coronation
theme, the beautifully designed menu
had a coloured frontispiece of Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth, and the
whole production reflected the highest
standards of the printer’s art.
Toast List.
The Loyal Toast, with Musical
Honours, was proposed by the Presi-
dent, who made appropriate reference
to the youth, the beauty, and the
charm of our beloved Queen.
The Commonwealth of
Australia.
Mr. M. R. Hornibrook, F.A.1.8.,
in proposing this Toast, paid eloquent
tribute to our great land of sweeping
distances and thriving cities, built by
men of vision, energy and courage.
“The Commonwealth Government
is doing an excellent job today, and
I hope we see it returned to power at
the next elections.” (Applause.)
The speaker welcomed Senator
Spicer, Government Leader in the
Senate, and said the builders were in-
deed honoured by his presence at the
function.
Continuing, Mr. Hornibrook said:
“May I remind you that our Prime
Minister is Number One man in the
Australian Institute of Builders, and
he is veiy proud of his membership.”
(Applause.)
We had hoped he would have
been here to-night, but he was pre-
vented by a bereavement.
We wish Mr. Menzies and his Gov- ,
ernment well.
“They are doing a grand job in
Australia for the people.
“We want men of Mr. Menzies’
calibre in public life to get things
done,” Mr. Hornibrook added.
Responding, Senator Spicer apolo-
gised for the unavoidable absence of
the Prime Minister. He had been
asked to deputise for him on this oc-
casion.
It is somewhat of a memorable oc-
casion, too, for me,” the Senator add-
ed.
“It is the first time in my life that
I ever got anything from a Master
Builder for nothing!” (Laughter.)
In serious vein, Senator Spicer said
he would like to suggest, for mature
consideration, the fact that during the
last three or four years Australia had
passed through a very difficult period.
No one knew better than builders
that the period was one of extreme"
economic instability, which was not
created by any Government.
There had never been a previous
period in Australia’s history in which
it suffered a fall in export income
such as it faced in 1952.
“It was a catastrophic fall in ex-
ports,’’ he declared.
“In 1890 and again in 1930 we
suffered depressions, and in 1930 par-
ticularly we learned a lot about the
business of economic management.
“It is not sufficient to learn the
lessons. It is necessary for the Gov-
ernment to apply them.
“By doing so we have escaped con-
sequences such as befell the people in
1890 and 1930, ’ the Senator said.
“Because the Government applied
the remedy at the proper time it can
now present a Budget you welcome
and enable you to make a lasting con-
tribution to Australia.’’ (Applause.)
The Senator paid a tribute to build-
ers from other States for the wonder-
ful work they have done in their cities
and towns.
The hey-day of building in Mel-
bourne, he said, was 1870-1890, dur-
ing which time the major public build-
ings of the city were built by men
of great vision.
In this our day we need to re-
capture some of that spirit,’’ the Sen-
ator declared.
“I believe we are on the edge of a
great future for building, and you
men will make a valuable contribution
through your skill and knowledge.
You are the bulwark of civilisa-
tion in this part of the world,” the
Senator concluded.
The M.B. Federation.
In proposing this Toast, the Lord
Mayor of Melbourne, Councillor R.
H- Solly, recalled his long association
with the building industry.
His admiration for the work of the
Federation went back many years, and
the work of the Victorian Master
Builders was something the city and
State could well be proud of.
The Federation was 63 years old
and it had a long history of wonder-
ful endeavour in the interests of build-
ers and the nation.
The Lord Mayor concluded by con-
gratulating the President on his pro-
gressive year of office.
“Mr. Hansen belongs to a firm
whose founders I knew well.
“They were master craftsmen who
left a reputation for ability and integ-
rity.

“Mr. Hansen is carrying on that
tradition in a truly remarkable
manner.” (Applause.)
Responding, Mr. Hansen said the
Lord Mayor had been a good friend
to builders for many years. (Ap'
plause.)
The Federation was founded in
Melbourne in 1890 when builders
from the four States banded together.
Today the results of their vision
was evident in a national Federation,
speaking with a common voice, and
working in harmony for the benefit
of all.
Mr. Hansen stressed the need of
loyalty between members, and to pre'
serve unity of thought and action.
There was the need to co-operate
with one another to bring the build'
ing industry to its proper place in
the nation’s industrial and commercial
life.
“This the Federation is striving to
do, and with the support of all build-
ers it will achieve its aims,” Mr. Han-
sen added.
The Guests.
The Senior Vice-President, Mr. T.
M. Lipscombe, F.A.1.8., in proposing
this Toast, said it was pleasing to see
such a cross-section of the Community
present,
“The building industry must give
service to the nation, and it is thus of
great importance to Australia,” Mr.
Lipscombe said.
“Over the years it has had the co-
operation of trades and professions,
and I hope it will continue its alii'
ance with industry.
“I feel that if the Government will
come into consultation with us we can
cooperate in building what they want,
where they want it,” Mr. Lipscombe
added.
Responding the President of the
R.A.1.A., Mr. R. F. Demaine, said
that, although cooperation between
architects and builders had increased
in recent years, there was still room
for a closer association between archi'
tects and the building industry.
Mr. Demaine said he had had the
pleasure of meeting Master Builders
in Conference in several capital cities,
and he had the greatest admiration
for their forthrightness and integrity
(Applause.)
Mr. J. W. Chalmers, F.A.1.8., prov'
ed an excellent Toastmaster.
During the evening items were given
by Allan Eddy (baritone), Frank Rich
(entertainer), Eric Fox (piano), and
the Dennis Farrington Trio.
MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
STEPHEN H. WATSON,
PHILIPS ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES
PTY, LTD.
Dark haired, slim Stephen H. Watson,
Senior Engineer and Technical Commer-
cial Officer of the Lamp Department of
Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd., has
recently returned to Sydney from a
round-the-world trip, during which he
made an all-embracing study of every
angle of modern developments in light-
ing.
At Eindhoven, in Holland, Mr. Watson
saw something of the amazing progress
being made and he extended his tour
to compare these advances in lighting
progress with those of his great firm.
He went all over Europe, studied in the
United Kingdom and in America.
Many of the ideas gleaned on the
other side of the world by this know-
ledgable young man will be incorporat-
ed here and these would be in evidence
in the near future he said.
He is personally interested in modern
architectural development and the ap-
plication of the latest trends in this de-
partment—especially in lighting, are evi-
dent in his own home.
THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE
OF BUILDERS.
Its Foundation and Purpose.
Speaking at the recent Annual Gen'
eral Meeting of the Building Indus'
try Congress of N.S.W., where he
was Guest of Honour, Mr. Manuel
Hornibrook, Managing Director of
Hornibrook, McKenzie Clark Pty.
Ltd., made reference to the newly'
formed Australian Institute of Builders
of which he is President;
“The Australian Institute is an off'
shoot of the London Institute of
Builders. The London Institute was
formed primarily to look after the ed'
ucation of the younger people who
had to carry on and serve the public;
few Australians had the privilege of
joining it —I was one of them. We
are so far away from headquarters that
there was not a great deal achieved
so the Institute in London thought it
was time that a kindred body be form'
ed in Australia. Our late friend, Fred.
Wilson, was also a Fellow of the Lon'
don Institute and our first President.
We have been operating only two
years but Chapters have been formed
in each State. The Chapters have
the responsibility of looking after the
technical education of the young
people so that they can qualify to join
the Institute in the future. Technical
education is absolutely essential now
that construction practice is on a scien'
tific plane. Prestressed concrete is a
case in point, a comparatively recentj
innovation, it is already in fairly com'
mon use and I think it is here to
stay.
Our Australian Institute of Builders
is young and energetic and we expect
to progress more quickly when we
have a building of our own. We are
now choosing a site and having plans
drawn up; we shall soon be in a posL
tion to call tenders for a home of our
own.”
INDUSTRIAL RUBBER DOOR.
Above is illustrated a rubber swing
door (produced by Wm. Newman &
Sons, Birmingham) suitable for hospitals
or industrial establishments. The door
sheets swing either way, is self-closing,
and permits the passage of a trolley or
tractor. It has the advantage of being
silent in operation and can take greater
punishment than a rigid door without
damage to itself.

BUILDING: LIGHTING; ENGINEERING


G.S.I.R.O. Building Research Division
Ninth Annual Report.
During the year greater emphasis
was given to the work on lightweight
aggregates and the use of plaster of
paris as a structural material, states the
9th annual report for the year ended
June 30.
Inquiries received number 2700,
mostly from private individuals and
manufacturers, though there was a
marked increase from architects and
engineers.
Courses of lectures were at the
University of Melbourne and the Mel-
bourne Technical College.
No officers went abroad during
1952/53, but, at the invitation of the
Building Research Advisory Board of
che United States National Research
Council, the officer-in-charge of Or-
ganic Materials Investigations con-
tributed a paper to a Conference, held
in Washington, on Housing and Build-
ing in Hot - humid and Hot - dry
Climates.
Good Progress.
During the year research work on
lightweight aggregates (bloated clays,
perlite, vermiculite) and on gypsum
plaster as a structural material was in'
tensified to reduce the cost of building.
Substantial economies in commercial
and industrial buildings can be made
by using, in place of the orthodox
heavy concrete, lightweight aggregate
concrete for structural purposes and
low'density plaster as fire protection
for structural steelwork. Clays and
shales suitable for bloating are found
in and near the centres of population
in the eastern States, and excellent
perlite can be made from the large
deposits of volcanic glass in southern
Queensland. Large precast gypsum
plaster wall slabs used in house con'
struction in South Australia and Vic-
toria are resulting in marked savings,
the cost being often less than half
that of brick or timber walls (see
photo). Plaster walls appear promis-
ing for use in industrial and commer-
cial construction also.
The chief cause of the unsightly
purplish-brown staining on decorated
fibrous plaster was found to result
from the combined use of lead - con-
taining compounds and proteinaceous
water paints.
Expanded or Bloated
Clays.
Tests on clays and shales from Mel-
bourne, country areas of Victoria,
Queensland and New South Wales
proved that good lightweight aggre-
gates can be made from some of these
with or without bloating agents such
as haematite or calcium carbonate. A
clav of basaltic origin from the Merri
Creek, Melbourne, bloats well without
an agent, but the addition of small
amounts of haematite enables even
lighter aggregate to be produced.
Certain shales from Sydney require
either haematite or calcium carbonate
to give satisfactory results.
Concrete made with expanded clay
aggregate shows that such concrete
with a density between 80 and 100
Ib/cu. ft. (compared with 145 Ib./cu.
ft. for dense concrete) may have a
compressive strength and a shrinkage

Wool Pooling and Classing Building
By F. O. NIXON.
Architect: Frank Cullen.
Builders: M. R. Homibrook (Pty.) Limited.
The closing'down some years ago
of the long'established brick and pot'
tery works of James Campbell and
Sons Pty. Ltd. at Albion (Brisbane),
even to the demolition of the huge
chimney stack, has made available
three acres of land now much more
conveniently situated to the fast'
developing city of Brisbane than it
was when these cliffs at Albion were
first drawn upon for stone and clay.
The land, having been acquired by
Grazcos Cooperative Limited, has now
been built upon to the extent of
86,000 square feet, exclusive of a
covered loading driveway 24ft. wide
running the full length of the ground
floor and the western side, and con'
nected by a concrete'surfaced private
roadway to Crosby Road and Lever
Street on the southern and northern
boundaries of the site. Obviously,
there remains a good area of land for
future expansion and for layout of
the surrounding land with approaches
and lawns which mean so much in
associating aetheticism with industry
no matter how drab the nature of the
latter may be. One encounters so
many examples of this pleasing feature
in modern industrial life that its prime
movers deserve well of present and
future generations.
It is noteworthy that less than two
generations ago the Mayor of one of
Brisbane’s suburban town councils was
dubbed “crazy” when he created in
the face of much opposition a tree'
line plot called “the folly” in his
suburb’s main street.)
The Premier of Queensland, The
Hon. V. C. Gair, M.L.A., is to offi'
dally opened this new Wool Pooling
and Classing Store on 21st October.
The brick'faced two'Storeyed build'
ing of which a photograph appears
hereunder, is of reinforced concrete
frame construction. Both floors are in
this medium, the ground floor provid'
ing the bulk wood store, the office, staff
amenities rooms consisting of dining
and recreation room, first'aid room,
dressing and locker room, shower and
wash room, toilet block these staff
amenities occupying 5000 square feet
along the full eastern frontage of the
building.
The whole of the first floor is given
over to the pooling and classing of
wool. Just how important and scien'
itfic is the classing of wool is evL
denced by the fact that the schedule
contains 1200 basic types, sometimes
subdivided, though these were modi'
fied during the last war to a lesser
number.
There is too much wealth covered
by the great wool industry of Aus'
tralia to allow the marketing of it to
be subject to haphazard method—or
want of method —in being “true to
label.” The best of lighting being a
sine qua non, the wool pooling and
classing floor is so adequately lighted
as to be termed “an arc of daylight.”
The four walls are generously pro'
vided with almost continuous panels
of steel'frame windows, operated by
gear to ensure the maximum degree
of ventilation. This lighting is accem
tuated by the “saw tooth” roof. Roof
trusses are of steel angle and pipe'
frame construction spanning 25ft. bays
and supported by parallel chord tresses
of similar construction. These parallel
chord trusses span up to 75ft., so that
the whole first floor is completely urn
interrupted but for two rows of 12in.
square reinforced concrete columns.
The elevation of this floor takes
advantage of gravity through what are
called “gravity drops” in returning
the rebaled wool to the ground floor
loading platform for delivery direct
to transport trucks.
To have reached the first floor eleva'
tion an electrically-operated conveyor
will have pdaced the baled wood in
position to be pooled, classed and re'
baled.
It is appropriate that the State of
Queensland, carried so largely though
not completely on the back of the
sheep, should not, through any ad'
junct, “spoil the ship for a h’apworth
of tar.” This fine building by
Hornibrooks leaves nothing to be de'
sired.

A 10-STOREY GARAGE IN TEXAS
FOR THE SOUTH TEXAS
NATIONAL BANK.
The scheme provides for 450 cars to be
housed at one time. The Bank will pro-
vide "drive-in banking windows" and al-
lot certain parking space to patrons
who desire to do banking in the main
building. A tunnel provides another en-
try to bank customers who may desire
to enter from the other side of the
street. Cars will be served by four
elevators using a patented system in
which the elevators move vertically and
horizontally to park their cars in the
slots.

More British Power
Riant for Turkey
An order has been received by
Metropolitan - Vickers Electrical Co.
Ltd. for extending the capacity of
Catalagzi Power Station, Turkey, by
60,000 kW. This will double the
size of the original power station
which Metropolitan - Vickers as main
contractors built and equipped after
the war.
The value of the new order is about
£3,500,000 and the preliminary con-
tract document was signed in Ankara
on August 6th. The contract covers
the supply of three 20,000 kW. turbo-
generator sets, three boilers, and the
necessary switchgear, transformers, and
auxiliaries together with the complete
extensions to the buildings. Main
sub-contractors are Babcock and
Wilcox Ltd. for boilerhouse equipment
and Braithwaite and Co. Engineers
Ltd. for civil engineering work: the
steelwork for the buildings will be
supplied by Dorman Long and Co.
Ltd. as sub-contractors to Metropoli-
tan - Vickers.
Catalagzi Power Station, which has
been running for nearly four years,
supplies power to the coalfields at
Zonguldak on the Black Sea. and it is
also Jinked by a 200-mile transmission
line to Istanbul. The new extensions
are believed to be required to deal
with the increased demand for elec-
tricity in Ankara.
Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Co.
Ltd. is represented in Australia by
Australian General Electric Proprietary
Limited.
Increase in Electricity Generation
200,000 kW ADDED SINCE 1952.
The Chairman of the Electricity
Commission of New South Wales, Mr.
H. G. Conde, in a recent statement
said that on June 30, 1953, 220,000
kW have been added to the output
of the Electricity Commission’s gene-
rating stations since mid-winter of
1952. This means fruition over the
past twelve months of the Commis-
sion’s emergency plans to meet the
drastic shortage in electricity supply
which existed when it was first con-
stituted three years ago and of the
steps taken to expedite its general con-
struction programme with which those
emergency plans were integrated.
These additions have permitted the
virtual abolition of all restrictions on
the use of electricity.
In 1950 supply fell short of an esti-
mated demand of 700,000 kW by some
200,000 kW. The figure of 700,000
kW was, of course, necessarily an esti-
mate, for there was no possibility of
meeting that demand. Severe restric-
tions were in force and blackouts wide-
spread and, by reason of their extent,
disorderly.
This year, although all restrictions
on the use of electricity, except for
limitation in the case of arc furnaces,
were removed on 25th May, load shed-
ding has only occurred on a modest
scale while unrestricted demand in ex-
cess of 840,000 kW has been made
and met.
To go back only a year: in May,
1952, although restrictions were still in
force, load shedding was necessary to
the extent of 4,270,000 units of elec-
tricity. The maximum demand met
was 648,000 kW. Compared with this,
in June of this year, the first month
since the relaxation of restrictions, a
demand of 540,000 kW has been met,
while load shedding has been reduced
to a total of 213,000 units.
Two Pyrmont Units.
Generating plant added to the inter-
connected system between July, 1952,
and June, 1953, included the first two
of Pyrmont’s four 50,000 kW units,
additions of 25,000 and 10,000 kW at
Balmain and Lithgow, respectively,
while of the four package power
stations, each comprising four 6500
kW units, the complete 25,000 kW
stations are now operating at Penrith
and Port Kembla and the first units at
Liverpool and Maitland, this last
coming on to the line only last month.
Further elements of the emergency
programme, made up of plant readily
available and capable of speedy erec-
tion, which were commissioned during
the year are to be found in the 4500
kW diesel plants at Brookvale and
Kempsey and the 5000 kW plant at
Canberra and the State Dockyard,
Newcastle. In addition, two of the
four units to be installed at Parkes are
operating.

THE INSTITUTE OF QUANTITY
SURVEYORS (AUSTRALIA).
The Institute of Quantity Surveyors
(Aust.) was formed recently by the
State Institutes of N.S.W., Queens-
land, Victoria, South Australia and
Western Australia, and the Inaugural
Convention was held in Brisbane late
in September. The office-bearers
elected for 1953-54 are as follows:-
President: Mr. J. A. Wood
(N.S.W.); Vice-President; Mr. D. K.
Hamilton (Vic.); Hon. Secretary: Mr.
J. W. Miller (N.S.W.); Hon. Trea-

Side by side with additions to plant,
the Commission has effected substam
tial extension and strengthening of the
main transmission lines of the inter'
connected system. In that regard, too,
strategic siting of the package power
stations and diesel plant has reduced
demands on the transmission system
which had become severely taxed as
output caught up with demand. As
in the case of generating plant, emer
gency and long' range transmission
plans have been coordinated so as to
achieve maximum immediate use of
lines which will play an even greater
part in the future.
Still further plant is to be installed
before the end of the year, totalling
90,000 kW and comprising the balance
of the Liverpool and Maitland package
stations and that of the o diesel station
at Parkes, while a further major addh
tion will be made at Bunnerong, where
a fourth 50,000 kW unit is in course
of construction.
Reserve Plant Inadequate.
Reserve plant is still inadequate, and
any serious breakdown must reflect in
load shedding while, in this connec'
tion, it must be remembered that there
is a very high proportion of plant in
commission long overdue for retire'
ment. Provided, however, no such
breakdown occurs, the present position
should be maintained over the winter,
that is to say, load shedding, if urn
avoidable in peak periods, should be
confined to the rostered zone and to
no more than part of an hour, while,,
after the winter, further plant coming
into service should make load shedding
a thing of the past.
At the same time, it must be remem'
bered that demand is steadily increas'
ing. The Commission’s further con'
struction programme—which includes
the completion of Pyrmont power
station to 200,000 kW, a further
50,000 kW unit at White Bay, substan-
tial additions to Balmain and Lithgow,
and the new major power stations at
Tallawarra, Lake Macquarie and Wal'
lerawang—together with its associated
transmission line construction are de-
signed to meet that future demand.

SALES MANAGER
J. T. WHEELER.
John was born in London within
sound of Bow Bells.
Arriving in Sydney in July, 1913,.
with a total capital of sovereigns
he commenced employment with
B.G.E. After spending a brief per'
iod in the offices he graduated as a
knight of the road, his first sale was
OSRAM lamps the first installation
of gas filled lamps in Sydney. He
found his old friends, Ted De Launey,
Bert Martin (Noyes), and Reg Wyatt,,
now B.G.E. Brisbane Branch Man'
ager, tough competitors.
With the outbreak of war John em
listed and on the 17th August, 1914,
marched out of Victoria Barracks with
the 2nd Battalion. He sailed in the
“Suffolk” for Egypt, served at Lone
Pine, and after four months was in'
valided to England, returning to Aus'
tralia in September, 1916.
On returning to B.G.E. he rejoin'
ed the Sales Department and in 1926
was appointed Branch Manager, Ad'
elaide Branch. The opening of the
Branch was postponed so John remain'
ed in Sydney. He managed various
departments in B.G.E., Sydney, and
was appointed Assistant Sales Manager
in the early 1930’s and Sales Manager
in 1936.
Today at almost 60 years of age,
at the B.G.E. Board of Directors’
Presentation Lunch to him (see illus'
tration, page 45) on completion of
40 years service with B.G.E., he said
he felt he was celebrating his fortieth
birthday.
He came to Australia to seek his
fortune and found it in his wife,
Betty. Their two sons, John and
Tony, flew with the Air Force during
the last war.
John’s philosophy of life is “Count
your blessings every morning, there
are so many so much worse off.”

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust. -N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street. Sydney, on Thursday,
Ist October, 1953, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. G. C, T. Brown,
and 26 members and visitors were
present. The President extended a
cordial welcome to visitors present,
especially the two interstate visitors,
Mr. S. Lay, of South Australia, and
Mr. G. Brentwood, of Victoria.
Minutes of General Meeting held
on the 3rd September, 195 3, were
taken as read and confirmed.
Report from Council.
The President reported that Council
had elected Mr. G. Y. Falk as Presi'
dent for the year 1953'54.
The President also advised that
members would shortly be receiving
particulars of Council nominations for
the 1953'54 Council, and reminded
members of their right to each nomi'
nate one person for Council should
they so desire.
The President further informed
members that the next meeting of the
Society would be the Annual General
Meeting and Social, which would be
held on Thursday, the 19th Novem'
ber, 1953, at the Millions Club. Fur-
ther particulars of this meeting would
be sent to members in due course.
The President reminded members
that the I.E.S. would again be repre'
sented at the Health Week Exhibition
during October and would require
volunteers to assist the demonstration.
The 1953 National Conference
would be held at Adelaide during the
early part of November, and it was
anticipated that the three N.S.W. rep'
resentatives would attend.
Subject for the Evening.
“The Role of Lighting in Accident
Prevention.” Speaker: S. D. Lay,
F.R.S.A.. F.I.E.S. (London), Lighting
Engineer in Department of Labour
and National Service (Sth. Australia).
At the conclusion of the discussion,
the President moved the vote of thanks
to Mr. Lay for his most interesting
naper. The vote of thanks was car'
ried with acclamation.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Falk asked Mr. Lay if any at'
tempt had been mdae to produce a
flameproof lighting unit of a sealed
type with an internal pressure greater
than atmospheric pressure. He sug'
gested that with such a unit the in'
ternal pressure would prevent the in'
gress of inflammable gas in the event
of some fault developing in the unit.
Mr. Lay said that some lighting units
using a higher internal pressure had
been manufactured for operation in
conjunction with a continuous supply
of compressed air. Such units incor-
porated automatic cut' off switches
which interrupted the current supply
in the event of a reduction of the in-
ternal air pressure. At the same time
it was not considered practicable to
use a separate sealed unit as suggested
by Mr. Falk owing to the difficulty of
ensuring that the unit was repressurised
after maintenance and relamping.
Mr. Stewart referred to the recent
legislation by certain States directed
towards the improvement of lighting,
and asked Mr. Lay whether he con'
sidered such legislation to be directed
towards the prevention of accidents or
whether it was directed to improve
the general welfare of the community.
He also asked if any consideration had
been given to the question of em
forcing the provision of additional
lighting for hazardous locations.
Mr. Lay said that any concern for
general welfare must include the pre'
vention of accidents and vice'versa.
In general, the provision of extra
lighting was not applicable to hazar'
dous locations except where proctec'
tive screens or goggles interfered with
the vision. In such cases the extra
light was necessary for the performance
of the task involved.
Mr. G. Brown, referring to the pre'
vious question, suggested that the
hazardous locations mentioned referred
rather to hazardous positions or areas
than to hazardous operations. He
mentioned as an example the open
vats at chemical works.
Mr. Lay said that in his experience
he had found that most hazardous
positions of the type suggested by Mr.
Brown were caused by the failure to
carry out good lighting practice. It
was better, therefore, to remove the
hazard altogether or erect some physh
cal barrier to prevent the possibility
of accidents.
Mr. Falk asked Mr. Lay if the flame'
proof fitting was designed to exclude
explosive gases or whether the gas did
eventually get inside the fitting?
Mr. Lay said that the principle of
design of both the flameproof lighting
unit and the flameproof conduit fit'
tings was not to exclude the explosive
gases but tf) contain any eventual ex-
plosion inside the unit, and at the
same time to cool any flame or gas
passing out of the unit to such an
extent that it would not ignite the
surrounding atmosphere. Each unit
had a complete specification stamped
on it stating the group of gases with
which it could be used and the maxi'
mum lamp size with which it could be
fitted.
Mr. Barron referred to the impor'
tance of colour as applied to guards
and screens on machinery, and men'
tioned the standard colour system
evolved overseas for indicating various
hazards and controls. He asked if
Mr. Lay had any comment on such
systems. He also mentioned the dif'
ficulty of convincing industrial cus'
tomers of the need for flameproof
units in view of the previous laxness
in this direction.
Mr. Lay said that the question of
colour schemes for the identification
of hazards was a debatable one. As
he had previously mentioned, the first
thing to do is surely to remove the
hazard and the last resort is to high'
light it. Care was essential in the use
of such colour schemes lest by over'
use they become ineffective. Such
schemes should therefore be kept as
the last resort for such cases as permit'
ted no other solution. And if kept
as a last resort why bother to stan'
dardise on one particular scheme?
With reference to the flameproof
units, Mr. Lay said that the greatest
factor in promoting their use was the
effect of accidents which had occurred
in the past. Mr. Lay quoted several
examples of accidents which had oc'
curred in Australia during the last few
years due to the failure to use certified
flameproof lighting units.

BAUXITE MINING IN BRITISH GUIANA
SCENE OF PRESENT POLITICAL UNREST.
British Guiana is the Common'
wealth’s largest source of bauxite.
Unlike gold and diamonds, the his-
tory of the industry dates back to the
comparatively short period of thirty
years. It is the second in importance,
after sugar, in the economy of the
Colony and its contribution to the
revenue of the local government now
exceeds that of the sugar industry.
It is largely confined to two com'
panics, both externally owned, with
the older-established Demerara Bauxite
Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the
Aluminium Company of Canada, hold'
ing exclusive permissions and mining
leases covering an area of some
900.000 acres sprawling across the
Demerara'Berbice divide.
The company’s plant is located at
MacKenzie City, 64 miles up the
Demerara River, where it employs at
present 2500 mine and factory workers,
whose annual wage bill amounts to
an estimated 3,000,000 dollars. It is
one of the world’s large producers of
bauxite ore, the raw material used in
making aluminium, the twentieth cem
tury metal used for a multiplicity of
purposes ranging from the building
of bombers and cargO'carrying planes
to simple every'day household utilities.
The industry received its biggest
boost with the outbreak of World
War 11, when production was pushed
to a record level. Production reached
its peak in 1943, when it totalled
some 1,800,000 tons. The current
year’s exports are expected to reach
1.800.000 tons of dried bauxite, in
addition to which about 160,000 tons
of calcined bauxite will be shipped.
This is a comparatively recent de'

velopment rapidly growing in impor-
tance; calcined bauxite is used by the
abrasive and refractory industries. For
the first four years of the war, 1940
to 1943 inclusive, the company pro-
duced a total of 5,300,000 tons of
washed and dried ore.
It was during this period that the
company undertook large-scale expan-
sion of its plant and mining opera-
tions. Three new 190 ft. rotary kilns,
each with a capacity of 55 tons per
hour, were added to augment the
capacity of the three older oil-fired
kilns. Other improvements were made.
1951 was the start of another period
of expansion. One new drying kiln
was completed in August and. a new
calcining kiln, so far the largest
bauxite kiln in the world, went into
production in February, 1952. Con-
struction of a still larger kiln (No.
9), which will be used for the pro-
duction of refractory grade super-
calcined bauxite, has began. This kiln,
which will be 300 ft. long, is expected
to start operating the beginning of
1953.
British Guiana has been in the news
recently on account of the Communist
unrest and the speedy British counter-
measures that were taken.

“Formatubes” for Concrete Formwork
PRODUCT OF TEXTILE CONES & TUBES PTY. LTD.
Formatubes are being loaded on the
“Taiping” at No. 11 Wharf, Wool-
loomooloo, for shipment to Messrs.
Haut Sing and Company, Bangkok.
These paper forms, by Textile Cones
& Tubes Pty. Ltd., provide a quick
and economical method of providing
concrete forms. The cost of freight
to Bangkok is the equivalent to the
cost of the Formatubes themselves.
Nevertheless, they effect so many
economies in the saving of high cost
of labour and wasteful time, compared
with any other type of form providing
similar results, that this expense would
be considered well worth-while.
Formatubes are light and easy to
handle and are ready for immediate
use when they arrive on the job, and
although the tubes are manufactured
to required lengths, they can be easily
trimmed to any desired length by the
use of a carpenter’s saw.
Speedily erected, they have proved
satisfactory for all types of reinforced
concrete work requiring columns. The
concrete can be poured direct into
them from the mixer, and they are
narticularlv suited for those “hard-to-
get-at” places which, with other
methods, cause so much delay and
annoyance to workmen.
By the use of two tubes of dif-
ferent diameters, one placed inside the
other in a vertical position, concrete
pipes may be cast.
Formatubes consist of a specially'
treated paper tube with inside diameters

COMPETITION “LIFE OF
TRADE.”
Manuel Homibrook’s Views.
Speaking at the recent Annual Meet-
ing of the Building Industry Congress
of N.S.W., where he was Guest of
Honour, Mr. Manuel Hornibrook said:
“This is a stiffening-up time for
builders and we have just got to take
it. Competition is the life of trade
and we must give of our best and not
ask too much for our services—just a
fair margin of profit. It is the in-
dustry’s responsibility to keep the price
of building down, and this cannot be
done if we submit meekly to extrava-
gant demands of the workers v ”
Mr. Hornibrook is Managing Direc-
tor of Hornibrook, McKenzie Clark
Pty. Ltd. and President of the newly-
formed Australian Institute of Builders.
Amphitheatre to Have
“Umbrella Roof”
A novel amphitheatre, to the de-
sign of the noted U.S. architects,
Mitchell and Ritchey, is to be built
in a natural glade in Schlenley Park,
in the lovely civic centre of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
This is about 15 minutes away from
the centre of the city’s congested
commercial and business centre, and
is accessible by bus and tram from all
parts of the city.
(Its position would be approximate'
ly that of Centennial Park in
Sydney.)
But could we imagine a theatre like
this in Centennial Park, or even in the
Domain? We cater for open air
sports and other recreation irrespective
of the behaviour of the weather, but
deny sports to people who like to be
protected against inclement weather.
Some of our laws are outdated. They
were framed or fashioned when man’s
requirements were tiny and did not
stretch to such dimensions as they
now reach.
“Umbrella Roof.”
The new and revolutionary amphi-
theatre will have an “umbrella roof”
made of a plastic fabric supported in
the centre by a cantilever steel truss
and mounted on tracks around the
circumference of the bowl.
During fine weather this will fold
up to the rear of the audience. In
case of rain it will open fanwise and
cover the entire audience within two
minutes.
The theatre, designed for the Pitts-
burgh Civic Light Opera Association
of the U.S. will have a 10,000 seating
capacity.
The stage will have a proscenium
opening of 100 ft., and a depth of
100 ft., providing ample stage space
for the most lavish spectacles conceiv-
able.
There will be a double revolving
platform on the stage to enable quick
scenery changes.
The front curtain will take the
form of giant shutters, which will
move on specially constructed tracks.
The stage will be equipped with
the latest in lighting equipment, and
the spotlights will be directed from
a booth suspended from the centre
cantilever truss over the heads of the
audience.
The design includes ample dressing
rooms, workshops, three large re-
hearsal halls, refreshment area, first-
aid rooms, box-offices and executive
offices.
Parking space will be provided for
5,000 cars, conveniently situated in
the area.
FORMATUBES AS CONCRETE FORMWORK PIPES.
Like their clay or steel prototypes, pipes are now made from specially treated
paper. They are used as formwork for casting concrete columns. This load is

in the range ordinarily considered
satisfactory for dense concrete.
Concrete Investigations.
The report deals at length with the
mechanism of failure of concrete un-
der loads, and of experiments which
were carried out to investigate the
stresses, including non-destructive test-
ing methods.
Foamed Concrete.
Work has been done also on cellu-
lar calcium silicate—a potential mate-
rial for structural units. This is made
by autoclaving a prefoamed mix of
lime and silica flour. The amount of
lime needed depends on the specific
surface of the silica, that is, it is greater
the finer the sand.
A compressive strength/density ratio
of 60 has been obtained with den-
sities of about 60 Ib./cu. ft. This
ratio is about four times that of or-
dinary concrete and is up to 50%
higher than that of high strength con-
crete such as is used in pre-stressing.
Reinforced Gypsum Plaster.
Bond Strength. —-The bond strength
between steel reinforcing bars and
gypsum plaster was found to decrease
with increasing length of embedment
and with increasing bar diameter. The
addition of either lime or sand had no
significant effect, but together they
affected the strength in an erratic and
unexplained away.
Wall Units. —Small panels of rein-
forced gypsum walls were tested under
centric and eccentric concentrated and
distributed loads. Panels tested after
being dried to constant weight were
much stronger than those tested wet.
Weatherproofing of Plaster
Slab Walls.
Tests to make plaster slab walls
weatherproof by casting them on
sheets of asbestos cement showed that
adequate bond could be obtained in
small specimens. Large specimens
failed because of differential movement
of the two materials during drying.
Specimens in which plaster had been
gauged with a bitumen emulsion were
an exception, however, and tests on
these are continuing.
Gypsum Plasters.
The report details at length the re-
sult of experiments to determine
various setting times of gypsum plas-
ters, the density and structure of this
material, and the decoration of fibrous
plaster.
It surveys fully the Australian lime
industry, and then goes on to survey
the nation’s heavy clay industry from
a geological and technical aspect.
Bituminous Roofing
Materials.
During the year work had continued
on problems relating to the perform-
ance of bituminous roofing, while
special attention was given to prac'
tical aspects of roof construction.
Sections under which this work
came were as follows:
Roof Surface Temperatures.
Analysis of data from roof surface
temperatures was completed with the
■aid of Hollerith punched card equip-
ment. Frequency distributions which
summarise the hourly temperature re-
cords over a twelve-month period are
now available.
Bituminous Adhesives for Built-up
Roof Construction. —In the choice of
bitumens for built-up roof construction
current Australian practice differs from
the standard practices of some over-
seas countries, and experiments have
been undertaken for comparing mate-
rials. These experiments incorporate
both laboratory tests and pilot-scale
application trials from which estimates
can be made of the “pourability” and
spreading rates of bitumens over a
range of temperatures ,and also of the
toughness of the bitumen bond.
Small variations in temperature of
the bitumen markedly affect the rate
of application. Prolonged heating at
high temperatures causes embrittle'
ment. Stringent steps should be
taken to maintain the bitumen as near
as possible to the optimum tempera'
ture.
Experimental Roof Membrance.
Detailed inspections have been made
of laid roof membranes over the past
five years. Asbestos fibre felts and
those coated with a single application
of bitumen and aluminium paint have
been consistently good and markedly
better than the corresponding (satu'
rated) rag felt membranes which have
shown extensive puckering. The con'
ventional coated rag felt membranes
are in general in good condition. No
corrosion is apparent in the aluminium
foil membranes.
Field Investigations on Flat Roofing
Problems. —Frequent inquiries on flat
roofing problems continue to be re'
ceived. On inquiry related to leaks
in a paved membrane of one of the
Organisation’s own buildings and flood'
ing tests were carried out to locate
these leaks (see photo). The defects
were shown to be due in part at least
to inadequate parapet flashing.
Evidence has come to hand on the
defects of high purity lead as a flash'
ing material: failures by fatigue and
occasionally corrosion by cement mor
tar being the usual troubles. It is
believed that wider use of low alloy
leads would reduce the frequency of
fatigue failures, the report adds.
Other Investigations.
Among the other investigations car'
ried out during the year were tests of
thermal conductivity, adhesives for
polystyrene wall tiles, efflorescence,
and strength of Portland cement
plasters.
Architectural Acoustics.
The Division did much develop'
mental work during the year to find
a method of measuring acoustic ab'
sorption, and laboratory studies were
made by adding artificial echoes to
sounds recorded with little or no echo.
The Division was asked for assis'
tance with the speech reinforcement
system at the evening sessions of the
195 3 Melbourne Film Festival, held at
the Exhibition Building.
Two speaker systems were installed:
(a) one column of speakers (see
photo) at the right hand of the screen
to direct sound to the whole audience,
and (b) a column at the screen and
a second column half-way down the
hall and fed with a delayed signal.
Both systems gave good results, the
report adds.

LIVING ROOM HEART OF HOUSE.
The present-day tendency for the living room to be the hub or heart of the house is featured in all
these four designs, more particularly perhaps, in the bottom left or top right. Today the living room
lives up to its name and it is lived in by all the family all the time. In the top right design the
fireplace is centrally located so as to heat the whole house, though items stored in the box-room at
the rear would most certainly get very hot. Large room in the bottom left which is all glass on
the north side and has no other windows would suffer badly from lack of through ventilation.

Reducing Building
Costs
Amendment of Building Regulations.
No one connected with the Build-
ing industry will deny that building
costs are too high. Looking back,
even to 1939, the increase that has
taken place is incredible; anyone in
those immediate pre-war years who
had said that building costs would
by 1953 be four times what they were
then would have been given a chair
and told quietly to keep in out of the
noonday sun. Yet that is what has
actually occurred!
As with costs generally the end of
the war saw heavy increases—that was
inevitable and but one of the price
slugs paid by all for the foolishness
of modern warfare, but it has been
in the past three or four years that
galloping inflation had its head and the
sky was the limit, till the bubble burst
about twelve months ago. The build-
ing public had “had it” and their will
and means and desire to meet further
absurdities in cost was finished. Came
the reaction with hardship and soul-
searching; then the reward of some
measure of stabilisation.
But high costs still remain and with
a Basic Wage of £l2/3/0, a forty-
hour week, and materials costs reflect-
ing these two factors, it must continue
to be so. What then can the industry
do?
There is the avenue of a reduction
in costs by means of relaxation of cer-
tain aspects of existing Building Reg-
ulations and the more general applica-
tion of some improved methods of
construction that save labour, material,
or both.
This approach is not, of course,
new. Architects and Builders—par-
ticularly those who have been abroad
and are able to technically compare
our regulations with those obtaining
in other countries —have been ham-
mering away in this direction for years
and even two weeks ago Mr. D.
Stewart Fraser, M.L.A., made special
reference to this factor in his maiden
speech in the House.
Ceiling heights can be reduced to
8’ 6” or 8’ 0” for small homes with-
out hardship in any respect; laun-
dries can be modified in the light of
modern washing machine technique;
internal wall thickness can be reduced
from to 3”, and many other re-
forms could be effected whereby
homes no whit less comfortable or
well-built could be produced and ap-
preciable savings in material and ef-
fort made.
The degree of modification and con-
sequent saving is subject to debate
but there is very definite agreement
that there are ample grounds for some
modifications and consequently some
economy.
The latest building figures made
available by the Commonwealth Stat'
istician show that for the twelve
months ending June 30, 1952, there
were 77,898 houses valued at
£172,342,000 completed.
If only a hundred pounds each were
saved, the resultant economy through'
out Australia would be nearly £8,000,'
000, and it shouldn’t be too much to
even double that figure. If computed
for New South Wales alone, where
25,937 houses and flats were com-
pleted in 1952, the savings would be
over two and a half millions at £lOO
per house, or 900 more houses at
£3OOO a unit could be built for the
same expenditure. Some of these
modifications—“-notably the lower ceil'

State Budget’s
Spending
Loan Expenditure £55 Million
For Year.
The total loan expenditure this fi'
nancial year in N.S.W. would be
£55,276,000, the Premier, Mr. Cahill,
said recently.
Introducing the loan estimates in
the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Cahill
said it was proposed to complete
works in progress.
Major items of expenditure includ'
ed £13,000,000 for the Railways De'
partment.
£16,500,000 was provided for elec'
tricity undertakings, and £5,050,000
for education, including universities.
Mr. Cahill said the Government’s
policy in all fields of activity was to
concentrate on the completion of
works already under way.
He estimated that N.S.W. would
receive £52,250,000 for public works
for £1953'54 from the Common'
wealth.
N.S.W. would also receive
£12,450,000 for housing under the
Commonwealth'State housing agree'
ment.
Public hospitals expenditure will be
£4,000,000, lands £3,000,000, and the
Transport Department will receive
£1,100,000 of loan funds. Of this
£392,000 will be expended on tram'
way services and £708,000 on bus
services.
£400,000 will be spent on develop'
ing State coalmines, and works on
harbours and rivers will require an
outlay of £725,000.
The expenditure of £5,050,000 on
education, technical education and uni'
versities will allow current contracts
to proceed without restriction.
It will also enable a further pro'
gramme in timber and aluminium con'
struction to be undertaken.
Most of the money will be spent on
building works in progress at New'
castle, Cessnock, Sydney, and Banks'

Excessive Noise in Industry
HOW IT CAN BE MINIMISED.
It is the general philosophy of plant
management that a metalworking plant
is supposed to be noisy, and that
workers in industry expect to work in
a noisy plant. From a psychological
viewpoint, noise creates a feeling that
the plant is busy and that the worker’s
job is secure. It has been demon*
strated, however, that an engineering
approach to the problem of excessive
noise can bring about a substantial
decrease in such din. After they have
become used to the change, workers
are pleased with their new working
conditions, and the management is
pleased with the savings that accom*
pany the reduced noise.
When steel meets steel, noise is in*
evitable. The big question is: how
much noise? When does the hum of
productivity begin to carry overtones
of inefficiency? It takes energy to
produce noise, and an unusually high
noise level means that energy is being
expended for other than a useful pur*
pose. Excessive noise from a machine
indicates that it is working too hard,
or that it needs maintenance.
A subsidiary of the New York Gen*
tral which produces freight cars was
confronted with claims of deafness
totalling more than 1,000,000 dollars;
but this case is, of course, extreme.
It is true that few studies have been
made that measure the effect of noise
on either personnel or production;
hence, the benefits of noise control
cannot be expressed in dollars and
cents. Noise, or absence of the same,
is an indication of how well the plant
operates. Investigation and control of
noise can open many avenues of im*
provement in plant operation, because
so many factors contribute to the noise
level.
The greatest noise producer in
metalworking is impact force. The
extraordinary force required for press
operations produces excessive noise
and causes rapid deterioration of dies.
Noise and die wear on punch presses
can be reduced by varying the angle
of the punch. Where all shearing
action occurs simultaneously, a large
force is involved. When the lower
face of the punch is inclined slightly,
the plate is sheared gradually. The
reduction in impact force corresponds
to the angle on the punch, and the
duration of the force is increased pro*
portionately.
Where several holes are punched at
one stroke of the press, a reduction
of noise will result if speed punches
are used that punch holes progressive*
lv. Noise from punching and blanket*
ing operations performed on multi*
stage dies can be minimised by equalis*
ing work between stages, having one
stage precede the other.
In metalworking, hardness or yield
strength of material is a primary factor
in the noise generated. Harder mate*
rial needs greater force, which causes
higher noise levels. Operations- on
mild steel are quieter than on stainless
steel; brass and aluminium are least
noisy; thin*material working is more
annoying to personnel than similar
operations on thick material, because
the natural frequencies of the former
are higher. High frequency noise
may be more annoying than noise of
greater intensity but lower frequency.
Much noise results from improper*

3y adjusted machines . Gears, clutches,
bearings and automatic feeds are noisy
if clearances become excessive. Double
impact makes many presses noisy: one
impact resulting when the punch hits
the work, the second occurring in the
clutch mechanism an instant later as
the flywheel catches up with the crank.
Noise often results from the hand'
ling of materials in an operation such
as shearing, where the material falls
several feet to a concrete floor or on
to an accumulation of similar mate'
rial. Air'injection nozzles cause steady
noise of considerable intensity. Over'
loaded machinery is excessively noisy
because machine structures are easily
excited to vibration by the metal'
working forces. The job should be
done on a larger machine.
A shield around a machine prevents
direct radiation of noise. These shields
should be Jieavy, since lighter ones
might also vibrate and radiate noise.
The shield should be lined with light,
porous'textured acoustical material.
Gears, clutches, etc., which do not
have to be observed or manipulated
may be shielded. Acoustical treatment
of ceiling and/or walls curbs noise re'
verberation. In a low'ceilinged room,
it is necessary to treat only the ceil'
ing in the immediate vicinity of the
machine. If the ceiling is high, 50%
of the wall area should be treated —
preferably in patches alternated on
opposing walls. Acousticallv treated
baffles, suspended in the path of
severe sound radiation, are helpful. A
jewellery concern installed such baffles
over a battery of drop hammers, with
a marked reduction in noise.
Isolators under machines are effec'
live in decreasing transmission of noise
to a room below, but floor construe'
tion often limits their effectiveness.
Machinery mounted on concrete floors
is welhadapted to isolators, but isola'
tion is difficult if the machinery rests
on a wooden floor. Securing the
machine to a massive concrete block
mounted on isolators is the most effec'
tive method. This installation adds
stability, because the inertia of the
block reduces the motion of the
machine.
Rigid conduits, pipes, and ducts are
often a source of noise. A short
length of rubber or flexible hose in a
pipe or conduit tends to reduce the
transmission of noise, while a canvas
joint in a ventilation duct serves the
same purpose. Forces are sometimes
transmitted through the soil in an urn
predictable manner, and impact noise
can frequently appear at remote and
unexpected locations. Combating these
conditions involves a large and expen'
sive installation. It is best to mount
the heavy machine on a concrete block
resting on the soil or on piles.
Often the noise emanates from the
floor above, because of walking, truck'
ing, and dragging objects over the
floor, as well as normal machinery
sounds. The use of double floor con'
struction or a cushioned upper surface
on the floor reduces the noise radiated
to spaces below the floor.
In a building in which impact noises
will occur, the ceiling should not be
rigidly connected to the floor joists.
The use of a subfioor, a false ceiling,
and an cibsorptive blanket between will
save noise. Any means of introducing
resilience between the floor and the
source of impacts is useful.

Development of Roofing Material
MANY TYPES OF ROOF COVERINGS THROUGH AGES.
Away back in the dawn of history,
Palaeolithic man lived —
“Like little ants in sunless recesses
of caves.”
Man, at that stage had not yet be'
come a builder. When he did start
to provide himself with an artificial
shelter, it was a very primitive affair,
made of boughs. Of this type were
the huts of the Ainos in Japan—a
half savage aboriginal race. In fact,
this form of dwelling still survives
among half savage races in many parts
of the world.
The ancient civilisation of Egypt
showed considerable progress, the early
Egyptian houses being built of sun'
dried brick and wood. In Assyria we
find gorgeous palaces and temples
built of bituminous bricks, cemented
with bituminous clay, and casings of
enamelled tile. Cypress and cedar wood
played an important part, for the
roofs were composed of huge beams,
carrying layers of earth or stamped
clay.
Roofed With Stone Slabs.
The early Egyptian temples and
tombs were of massive stone masonry,
many of them still standing, in whole
or in part. These structures were
roofed with stone, the tombs being
often simple arches or vaults. The
temple roofs were usually flat and
many of these massive slabs of stone
are still in place, as in the Temple of
Edfu, built under Ptolemy Euergertes,
247-222 B.C. Excavations in Greece,
near Palaikastron, Crete, showed that
houses were roofed, in the early his'
tory of that region, with clay laid
upon reeds, which formed the ceiling,
and which was rendered watertight by
seaweed in the upper layers.
The Romans were the first to use
domes of brick or concrete, covered
with cement, lead'sheathed for water'
tightness. On elaborate structures, the
roofs were covered with tiles or with
bronze plates. The roofs of Athens,
in the 4th and sth century, were cov'
ered with tile.
Earliest Type of Roof.
The flat roof was, apparently, the
earliest type of roof. The house of
Circe, referred to in the Homeric
poems, must have been flat, as Eh
phenor slept on it. Practically all of
the houses of which we read in Bible
history had flat roofs and it was the
custom to sleep upon the house-top
in the cool night air. In fact, the
earliest building code of which we
have a record —the Mosaic —provid'
ed that walls should be carried above
the roof level, to prevent people fall'
ing off and suffering injury.
In the New Testament, there is an
account of a crowded gathering on
one of the houses listening to the
teachings of the Great Nazarene. A
sick man was brought on his bed but
the bearers could not get inside for
the crowd, so they went up on the
roof and lowered the bed through
the tiling, so the man might be heal'
ed.
Mediaeval, Middle Age Roofs.
Where there is much rain or snow,
as in northern countries, the sloping
roof is in more general use. In the
mediaeval cathedrals of Eurpose, the
roofs, which invariably had a steep
pitch were, for the first time in his'
tory, sheathed with boards, then cov'
ered with slate tiles, sheet copper or
lead.
England in the Middle Ages, used
for roofing lead, oak shingles, red tiles,
straw or reed thatch and stone slates.
The slates were thicker and less uni'
form than the machine cut slates of to'
day.
Modern Roofing.
Under modern standards of living,
a good roof is essential —one that is
watertight and preferably tight against
wind and cold. Under such a shelter,
a warm, cheerful, comfortable home is
possible in any climate.
Excepting builders and architects,
few people realise that the roof is
called on to withstand more severe at'
tacks of the elements than any other
portion of the house. The sun, wind
and rain beat upon it and it is ex'
posed to the assaults of hurricanes and
storms in greater degree than other
parts of the structure. It is the su-
preme point of wear.
There are many types of roofing in
general use in Australia today and
each has its special field and useful'
ness.
In this respect, Australian manufac'
turers have been well to the fore in the
production of roofing materials, and
their technical advice and know'how,
allied to years of research into roof'
ing problems, is always available to all
sections of the building industry.
SUB STANDARD HOMES
IN VICTORIA.
A total of 8949 Victorian homes
had been declared unfit for occupa-
tion, Mr. Hayes, Housing Minister,
said in Melbourne last week.
Demolition orders had been issued
in 3936 cases and repair orders on
5013 homes, he said.
Up to September 29 this year 644
houses had been demolished and 839
owners had complied with repair
orders.
Mr. Hayes said that none of the
£500,000 set aside to subsidise the
Housing Commission’s slum recreation
project had been used.
The Government had not yet de-
cided how this money would be used.
Last financial year the Housing
Commission had spent £32,470 of its
own funds on slum work.
The Government is still considering
what amount of loan money would be
available this financial year for slum
reclamation, Mr. Hayes added.
WOOMERAH COST.
The Long Range weapons project
has cost Australia £30,000,000 to June
30, 1953, and building operations dur'
ing the current year will probably ex*
ceed £2,600,000 more. A labour force
of about 1000 are at present employ'
ed in the area.
RESTFUL SYDNEY OASIS.
A restful and pleasant oasis in the heart of Sydney is Sandringham Garden, in
Hyde Park, at the corner of Park and College Streets. The City Council built the
Garden as a memorial to the late King George VI., and it was opened by the then
Lord Mayor of Sydney, AId. O’Dea, on November 19 last.

Industrial Italy
Builds Big
Clever Planning to Encourage
Production.
One of the most remarkable features
of postwar Italy is its tremendous in'
dustrial and commercial expansion.
The commercial expansion, facili-
tated an extensive seaboard and good
harbours and railway communication,
has kept even pace with manufactur'
ing developments, until today, Italy
is producing and exporting to world
markets goods ranging from cameras
to typewriters.
In the latter industry, the most re-
markable progress has been made by
the Olivetti Company, at Ivrea. This
organisation is considered leading cor'
poration in the western world in the
field of design.
As part of its social programme,
the company commissioned a remark'
able factory building (see illustration).
The north side of this huge factory
is sheathed in a double wall of glass
350 ft. long enclosing a series of ver'
tical louvres in an insulating space
about a foot deep. The concrete
skeleton shows through it more clear-
ly than this photograph indicates.
Although there are Olivetti plants
in Turin, Apuania, Barcelona and
Glasgow, and Olivetti stores in Milan,
Rome, Paris, London, Mexico, Buenos
Aires, Johannesburg, and Australia,
it is the “town within the town” that
Olivetti has created at Ivrea, a ro'
man site some 50 miles north of Turin,
which best expresses the Olivetti
idiom.
This enormous factory, modern low'
cost houses, a kindergarten, and edu'
cational and recreational facilities for
employees are contained in an inde'
pendent community functioning in
harmony with the native villagers.
Two of Italy’s foremost architects,
Luigi Figini and Gino Pollini were
commissioned to design a factory
“suitable for human beings as well
as machines, appearing hospitable and
colourful,, both in its facade and in'
terior.”
Later this team were concerned with
solving such employee problems as
low'cost housing, day nurseries,
clinics, and recreational facilities.
St. Joseph’s Cathedral, Buffalo,
New York, is believed to be the only
church in the world with its steeple
in the basement. It was removed many
years ago when strong winds threat'
ened to topple it.
OLIVETTI'S FACTORY AT
IVREA. ITALY.
This concrete building, 60ft. high, has
enormous glass facades—one of them is
350 ft. long. These glass walls illuminate
an interior carefully planned to expedite
production without sacrificing the com-
fort of workers.

FAVOURABLE TRADE BALANCE.
Ever since Mr. Memies reversed the
country’s downhill finances, a favour'
able trade balance has been in evh
dence. In August this year, however,
an unfavourable trade balance was
shown of £1,575,000 compared to a
profit of £28,000,000 the previous
month.
HEAT FROM COLD.
Heat from cold may seem a little fan-
tastic, but it is based on the heat-pump
principle and has sound theory behind
it. It is the principle on which the
homely domestic refrigerator works, but
in reverse. An office building in Austin,
Texas, U.S.A., is heated in winter and
cooled in summer by the heat extracted
in the one case, or returned to a near-
by lake, on the other. Water from the
lake at 55 degrees F. is pumped into a
heat exchanger and returned at 35 de-
grees having parted with its heat to
warm the building in the winter. In
the summer the process works in reverse,
extracting the heat from the building
and delivering it to the lake. The pro-
cess is automatic and operates under all-
the-year-round conditions without human
aid. The building is maintained at a
constant temperature level of 76 de-
grees. The actual electrical energy used
to operate the heat-cycle is about half
that amount that would be required If
the heat imparted or extracted was di-
rectly applied as kilowatt-hours from the
supply mains.

DRILLING BARGE TOWED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.
The photograph shows the launching at Port Glasgow, with most of its equipment
already installed, of a self-contained drilling barge of 2,545 tons displacement for
delivery to the Shell Oil Company at Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela. The barge
measures 158 ft. by 80ft., with a draft of 7ft. 6in. It will be used to transport all
drilling equipment and piping for oil-well drilling at selected points on the lake
where drilling platforms will be set up. The equipment is capable of drilling to
a depth of 15,000 feet. The main power plant consists of four 12-cylinder Diesel
engines of vee-formation, operating at 650 r.p.m., and direct-coupled to 450 kW
D.C. generators. The engines have a continuous rating of 698 b.h.p. under con-
ditions at the site.

Botany Bay As
Freight Port
Architects’ Proposal.
The N.S.W. Chapter of the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects has
made a proposal for the development
of Botany Bay as a freight port for
a large part of the State.
The suggestion forms part of an in'
stitute report on the City of Sydney
planning scheme.
“The present congested conditions
of Port Jackson cannot continue to
cope with freight as the city’s popu'
lation expands,” the report declared,
“Heavy freight could be handled
more quickly by facilities built in the
flat areas around Botany Bay.
“The position is so serious that the
Institute feels an investigation should
be made into the possibility of devel'
oping Botany Bay as a port.”
Decentralisation.
The time is overdue for a regional
plan covering New South Wales, the
report continues.
It recommends that decentralisation,
communications and land usage should
be considered on a land basis, and
adds:
“The County of Cumberland and
similar planning schemes elsewhere
Seal with only a small portion of the
area of the State.
“In some areas, the existing land
uses and present building develop'
ment indicate that designing proposed
in the scheme is quite unreal.”
The report criticises the present
business and commercial areas of the
city as “unduly restricted,” and says
the plan will not achieve anything
worthwhile.
“In fact, it will very likely prove
to be detrimental to proper city de'
velopment,” it adds.
[Ed. —Recommending Botany Bay
as a seaport would be equivalent to
having one in the Bay of Biscay.
Nothing of this kind should be at'
tempted unless the advice of a hy
drographical engineer is sought, other'
wise the time will come when ships
will be tossed about at the behest
of an animated bombora. A hydro'
graphical engineer would be able to
recommend whether breakwaters
should be installed and where they
should go.
Canberra Building
Criticised
Review of General Plan Urged.
Parliament House, Canberra, was
like a Scotsman’s change—“right, but
only just,” Senator McCallum (Liberal,
N.S.W.) declared during the Senate
debate on the Estimates.
He urged a more imaginative ap'
proach to the development of the
capital, and said the only building in
Canberra tO'day that came anywhere
near the planners’ idea was the war
memorial.
Parliament House was dignified, but
the Federal Government deserved
something finer, Senator McCallum
added.
He attacked the policy of building
temporary huts and cheap prefabri'
cated cottages in some Canberra
suburbs.
“Instead of having the city of
palaces that was envisaged by the plan'
ners, we are going to get a city of
hut.s and other odds and ends,” he
said.
Senator McCallum urged:
o A review of the general plan of
Canberra, which at present was just a
“series of spider webs linked together
somehow.”
• Employment of the best types of
architecture.
• A form of city government in
which the people of Canberra could
have an effective voice.
• Coordination of the activities of
the various departments.
Aga Khan Builds Fabulous Palace
HOLIDAY HOME BY INDIAN OCEAN.
The Aga Khan has turned architect
to design a fabulous palace for him'
self in Dar'es-Salaam, on the Tan'
ganyika coast, seven degrees olf the
equator, and overlooking the Indian
Ocean.
The palace, a stream'
lined holiday home, is built to defy
the weather—the kind of thing a man
can do when he is worth
£600,000,000.
Because of its proximity to the
equator, the palace has a “built'in
breeze.” It is constructed so that it
can catch the cool winds and delay
them through the house. The living
room and reception rooms are sur'
rounded by sweet'water channels.
All Mod. Cons.
To defy the gales that arrive with
the regularity of express trains, fold'
ing glass doors and ingenious concrete
grilles have been constructed on one
side of the house. There are a
sheltered swimming pool, changing
cabins, and a spacious tea terrace over'
looking Oyster Bay. A lift takes the
occupants to the first floor.
The palace is built on land donat'
ed to the Aga Khan by the Tangam
yika Government, and he plans to
use it as a holiday home for two
months of the year “to enable his
many followers in Tanganyika to see
him.”

home for two months of the year.

QUEENSLAND NEWSLETTER
By F. O. NIXON.
There is no abatement in the tempo
of post-war building construction of
essential housing and industrial pre-
mises in Brisbane and in nearby towns.
Throughout Queensland, the commit-
ments for major construction are list-
ed at approximately £60,000,000. At
Mt. Isa, £3,000,000 is being spent on
a new copper smelter designed to
double the production of copper in
Australia. Also, £750,000 will be
spent on the largest air-conditioning
plant in Australia for underground
working.
These two items are additional to
the normal expansion which involves
large capital expenditure at the mine.
The rise of this great mine and town
within so short a period, delving into
metals that represent real wealth, must
be a on a more durable foundation
than the mining of gold to minister
to a fiction that the world had better
not known but for its temporary lure
of population.
Geological opinion holds that this
North Queensland Eldorado will dis-
close uranium and other metals for
which the advance of science finds a
need.
In the middle of October, the City
of Gympie. from whose deep shafts
4,000,000 ounces of gold was obtain-
ed, celebrated its 86th birthday. All
of its mining glories that remained
were rottng poppet heads and small
mountains of tailings. Since the gold-
bearing one petered out, there came a
period when Gympie was a compara-
tive picture of desolation until its real
resources of wealth in timber, tropical
fruit-growing, grazing and dairying
were tapped.
Just how great has been this de-
velopment can be estimated from the
fact that Nestles Food Specialities
(Australia) Limited have now under
way a .£BOO,OOO factory to produce
powder milk—claimed to be the most
modern in Australia.
The cooperative butter factory is
one of the largest in Australia, also,
and this picturesque city of hills and
dales is on the most solid foundation
of any place—the foundation of food
supplies. Within the past few years
£30,000,000 has been spent on sugar
mill development of the 31 active
sugar mills in the State. The duplica-
tion of one mill at Ingham—the Vic'
toria —is costing the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. Ltd. no less than
£3,000,000.
As water conservation is so essen-
tial for the progress of Queensland,
the proposed expenditure of
£11,250,000 on the Tully Falls in
Western Queensland in a hydro-electric
undertaking is heartening. A contract

Before the end of this year, Bitumen
Oil Refineries (Australia) Ltd. will
begin to enclose a 40-acre site at
Hamilton, on which it is intended to
build a £500,000 refinery. Eighteen
months is estimated as the time it will
take to complete this building in
which 100 employees will be absorbed.
The Government is fortunate to be
in possession of the large riverside
reclaimed land between Hamilton and
Jinkenba devoted to industrial opera'
tions, the starting of which gets a lot
of governmental encouragement

sisting of the Main Roads Commis'

It would appear that cleanliness,
that was once next to godliness, is a
priority with the Mines Minister in
Queensland, Mr. Riordan. At Collins'
ville, near Bowen in North Queens-
land, a bathroom to minsiter to nearly
300 miners is under construction at a
cost of £34,500. Hot and cold
showers and baths will be provided in
this 107 ft. x 73ft. bathroom, to enter
which the miners will have to pass
through an ambulance centre where
any injuries will receive attention. A

AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF BUILDERS
Annual Meeting of Victorian Chapter.
The annual general meeting of the
Victorian Chapter of the Australian
Institute of Builders was held in Mel-
bourne on August 24.
(This Chapter comprises members
resident in Victoria and Tasmania.)
The election of office-bearers for
1953-5‘4 resulted as follows:
President: G. A. Winwood; ‘Vice-
President: A. V. Jennings; Hon. Sec-
retary: C. E. Hocking; Hon. Treasurer:
T. W. Morris.
Committee: C. E. Daw and D. R.
R. Lart (representing Tasmanian resi-
dents); J. W. Chalmers, W. R. G.
Longmuir, J. A. Taylor (representing
Victorian residents).
Second Annual Report.
In presenting its second annual re-
port, the Committee said:
As the Victorian Chapter (and, in
fact, the whole Institute) is still in
the formative stages, progress during
the year has been somewhat slow.
Engagements.
During the year, we held six Com-
mittee meetings (at which the average
attendance has been five) and three
General meetings (at which we have
averaged an attendance of twenty-five
members and ten visitors). On each
occasion, a guest speaker has been in
attendance, the first of whom was Mr.
E. V. Johnston, who spoke on the
subject of ‘Pre'stressed Concrete’ and
presented a most thoughtfully prepared
address, illustrated by graphs and some
excellent photographs.
The second guest speaker was Mr.
Eric Hughes, President of the Vic-
torian Chapter of the Institute of
Architects. Mr. Hughes is well-known
for his eloquence, and in his talk on
‘The Advantages of an Institute’ was
able to instance several cases from his
own very active participation in the
affairs of the Institute of Architects
to prove his many well - presented
points.
The third of our guests was Mr. lan
Langlands, of the Building Research
Division of the C.5.1.R.0. Mr.
Langlands spoke on the subject of
‘The Builder and the Scientist’ and in
so doing he traced the developments
in Australia and other countries and
pointed out that building costs in
Australia were 30% higher than in
America, but was able to suggest
methods, particularly by the complete
acceptance of the junior partner in
our industry (the scientist), whereby
costs might be reduced.
The third of these general meetings
was the first held at lunch time, and
the considerably increased attendance
confirmed the wisdom of the change
of time.
Membership.
During the year, the membership of
the Chapter increased by the admis-
sion of six Fellows, twelve Associates,
three Licentiates and three Students—
the total of all grades now being fifty.
Several additional applications for
membership are being considered and
application papers are in the hands of
several possible student members. In
this connection, we wish to record our
appreciation of the continued interest
and support given by Mr. Harry
Winbush, of the Melbourne Technical
College, School of Architecture.
Institute Annual General
Meeting.
The Victorian Chapter was well
represented at the Institute Annual
General Meeting held in May last.
Included in the many important items
of business dealt with was the adop*
tion of a set of By-Laws for the
governing of Chapter activities.
Much of the progress which the
Institute as a whole has made during
the past year is due to the enthusiasm
of the Federal President, Mr. M. R.
Hornibrook. Mr. Hornibrook has also
been largely responsible for the activity
which has brought to fruition the

New S.A. Cement
Product Company
A company which plans to make
cement rofing tiles, prefab, cement
houses and schools, and cement
bricks, has bought the South Austra-
lian Portland Cement Company’s
buildings and 40 acres of land at
Seacliff.
The new company, Concrete Indus'
tries (S.A.) Pty. Ltd., will be operat-
ing within a month, when it will be
producing cement tiles at a rate suf-
ficient to roof 1000 houses a year.
Within a few years it would be em-
ploying between 300 and 400 men,
the managing director, Mr. C. H.
Shaddock, of Sydney, announced re'
cently in Adelaide.
Mr. Shaddock said his company
had been operating in S.A. for 20
years, lining water mains with cement.
It was now entering the manufacturing

TUNNEL TO LONDON AIRPORT.
The problem of taking traffic to and from the administrative centre of a huge and
busy airport has been solved at London Airport by this great tunnel now nearing
completion. It is 60ft. wide, 17ft. Bin. high and 2026 ft long. Greater London,
comprising the City and Metropolitan districts had a population (provisional census
1951) of 8,346,137. The area of the City of Lodon is 675 acres, the County of
London 74,850 acres, Greater London 443,455 acres. This immensely congested
metropolis has solved the problems of access to its modern airport in spectacular
manner, whereby traffic (foot and vehicular) goes direct by tunnel to the heart
of the administrative area. Sydney metropolitan area, with an area of 154,664
acres, and a population of 1,750,000 and the city proper of earlier establishment
with an area of 3,220 acres, has failed to solve its problems in a similar manner.
Access to Mascot (now an airport of international status) is slow, difficult and often
dangerous. Any future plans for expansion should certainly include one or more
traffic tunnels, on similar lines to that of London Airport, or the latest New York
airport which cannot be reached by any other way than by tunnel systems which
converge to the centre of the airport from all directions. A tunnel system from
the Quay to the Railway would take a lot of traffic off the road and perhaps enable
the city to progress, which it cannot do at present because congestion of traffic
has been used as a reason for curtailing building development in the city. The
idea of these restrictions is that "if nobody uses the city, there will be no traffic
problems." How long it will remain a city without service is no concern of the
authorities that frame our laws. They couldn't care less.

Good news for office-starved profes-
sional people in Adelaide has come
with the registration of Elizabeth
House Ltd., early this month. The
company is to build a six-storey build-
ing in North Terrace, next to the
Electricity Trust building, on a vacant
section once earmarked for the con-
struction of the luxury Statler Hotel.
Plans provide for between 40 and 50
professional suites of offices, and many
enquiries for office space have already
been received.
Construction work will be done by
F. Fricker Ltd., of which Mr. F. T. T.
Fricker, a director of Elizabeth House
Ltd., is managing director. E. A.
Keal is the architect. The company
has been registered with a capital of
.£120,000.
Plans are expected to be ready soon,
and construction, which is expected
to take about 18 months, is scheduled
to begin at the end of this year or
early next year.
Some earlier relief in office space
may be expected from the new build-
ing erected by the Commercial Bank-
ing Co. of Sydney on the site of
the burnt-out Covent Garden building
in King William Street. The lower

faced with red Murray Bridge granite,
and the banking chamber and vestibule
are lined with green-flecked crystalline

J. Weir is the builder. The building
is expected to be ready for occupation
at the end of this year or early next
year, and a rush of applications for
offices on the second, third and fifth
floors already exceeds the available
space.
With the development of new sub-
urbs and industrial areas, many small-
er banking premises are under wav in
the city and suburbs, and plans for
several others are being prepared. Re-
cent contracts let in this field include
one to Emmett & Sons for remodel-
ling bank premises in Waymouth St.
(Woods, Bagot, Laybourne Smith and
Irwin, architects) and to 1. lenkins
& Sons for conversion of premises
in Grote Street to banking premises

modelling has increased with the ap-
proaching Royal Visit, and many old'
er buildings along the route of the
Royal Progress, notably in Grote St.
and Hindley St., are providing jobs
small in themselves, but totalling many
thousands of pounds in the aggregate.
Other parts of the city are being
renovated as well, the latest being
the 50'year-old Fruit and Produce Ex-
change building at the East End Mark-
et. Smith & Wilson have the con-

ing, is the architect.
Tenders have just closed with Cara-
doc Ashton and Fisher for the remod'
elling of the Union Insurance of Can-

ter alterations to the face of the build'
ing and remodelling of the interior,
it will be renamed Union Building in
accordance with the company’s other
buildings elsewhere.
Hansen 6? Yuncken this month se-
cured a contract for the construction
of a grandstand at the Norwood Oval,
which is expected to cost about
£20,000. The stand, which will seat
about 1,300, will be concrete framed
and floored, with cantilever steel roof
giving an uninterrupted view, and will
include lavatory and dressing-room ac-
commodation, a canteen and a mayor’s
parlor. Milne, Dawkins, Boehm and
Ellis are the architects.
Private school extensions are bring'
ing some major jobs in and around
the city. Tenders have just closed for

rooms to be built at King’s College
oval as a war memorial. Tenders for
two modern classrooms to be erected
at the school are in the hands of the
school board. L. G. and M. K. Gold'
ing are the architects.
Gordon C. Brown is calling tenders
for a college chapel, lecture rooms,
administrative block and 30-bed dorm-
itory for Wesley College. The work,

and is in two-storey brick and concrete
construction class, is expected to total
about £30,000.
Evans & Bruer, Philpott and Part'
ners are calling tenders for two major
hotel renovation jobs. Work at the
Northern Hotel, Enfield, comprises a
new bar, lounge, beer garden and five-
bedroom wing, and at the Hapstead
Hotel tenders are being called for a
new public bar, bottle department and
five-bedroom wing. Early acceptance
is expected of tenders for the new six-
bedroom Roseworthy Hotel, which is
estimated to cost about £20,000. Walk-
ley and Welbourn are the architects.
Factory extension work continues
with some new jobs, and several tend'
ers being called. Wilckens and Burn'
side have the contract for an extension
of the egg pulping section of the S.A.
Farmers’ Union factory at Mile End.
The work involves interior installation,
including a large insulated cool room

Fisher are calling tenders for a wool
store at Hindmarsh for Wilcox, MoF
flin Ltd. The building, brick fronted,
with asbestos sawtooth roof, concrete
floors and columns, faced at sides and
rear with galvanised iron, is expected
to cost about £12,000.
A. J. Claridge is calling tenders for
a 7,000 sq. ft. addition to the Wood'
ville plant of A. Hannaford G? Co.
The new area will include factory and
office space, and fireproof construction

by Simon Carves (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
Gibb 6? Miller have the contract for
the erection of four 750'ton, 40ft. dfi
ameter acid tanks, and will also build
two 45ft. long 9ft. diameter acid pump-
ing tanks. Millar and Turrell have
the contract for lead work on 24 acid
•coolers, using about 200 tons of lead.
Work on aerodromes at West Beach
and in the country has brought the
biggest Commonwealth Works Depart'
ment contracts of the month. Green'
Fill Quarries secured a £19,062 con'
tract for the supply of crushed rock
for Adelaide airport, West Beach, and
Quarry Industries a <£15,250 contract
for supplying 20,000 tons of in.
metal. A similar contract for 36,000
tons of fine crushed rock for Para'
field airfield went to Quarry Industries
at £34,200.
Tenders have just closed for the
construction of a second hangar at
West Beach. The value of the build'
ing work alone is estimated at between
£50,000 and £60,000.
F. Fricker Ltd. secured the tender,
at £12,285, for the dismantling and re'
erection of the steel hangar at the
new Whyalla airport site a few miles
from the town. The hangar now
stands on the old site in Whyalla.
Erection of a new terminal building
at the new airport is expected before
long.
The contractors, N. Mellor Ltd.,
have recommenced work, held up by
bad weather, on sealing runways at
the new Port Lincoln airport. Con-
struction of the new terminal building
is about half completed, and the air'
port is expected to be ready for use
during the Royal Visit to S.A. in
March next year.
Other major Works Department
contracts include one of £10,190, for
construction of a steel framed build'
ing at Woomera, let to Hansen and
Yuncken, conversion of a building
into an officers’ mess at Salisbury
£9,852), let to Elsdon Brothers, and
installation of a mechanical ventilating
system at Salisbury (£9,494), let to
Adelaide Air Conditioning and Do'

The company formed in 1947 to as-
sist in the building of the Woomera
Rocket Range project—Contractors
Consolidated Ltd. —has been wound
up this month, with the end of the
need for its existence. Formed by
Adelaide builders and contractors, it
organised the local building industry
to contract and subcontract for the
large jobs on range construction work.
It had more than 30 subcontractors
and 3.000 tradesmen working on the
range at the peak of its activity, and
handled jobs running into many hum
dreds of thousands of pounds. There
was precedent for its organisation in
the similar system used when Smith'
field and Salisbury munitions plants
were built during the war.
In State Government work, a tend'
er has been let to Wilckens and Burn-
side for the new 12classroom school
at Morphetville Park, and work has
already begun. So many tenderers
were interest that an extension of time
was grantd on the lOclassroom school
at Hampstead, and tenders have just
closed. This school is expected to
cost almost as much as the larger Mor'
phettville Park structure, because of
the greater amount of foundation
work.

called tenders, which closed to Oct.
16, for an R.S.L. hall at Keith. The
building, of cut Mt. Gambier stone,
with tiled roof, will be of about 3,500
;sq. ft., and has been kept domestic
jn character to keep down cost. A
feature is an octagonal entrance hall
in which a roll of honor will be dis'
played. The building also includes
billiards room, assembly hall, kitchen,
store and bar.
More storm damage construction
jobs in city and country are foreshad'
owed in additional grants of money to
councils, made this month, by the
storm damage advisory committee.
Brighton Council has been granted an'
other .£24,000, making a total of
.£50,000. Most of the money is ear'
marked for building up foreshore
roads and metalling banks, but more
than £5,000 is allocated for reinstate'
ment of amenities such as dressing
sheds and shelter sheds.
At Henley, £4,500 is available for
reinstatement of conveniences at Hen'
ley South, and at Glenelg £12,600 for
reinstatement of ambulance sheds and
dressing rooms, the contract for which
has already been let to Emmett and
Sons. In the country, £3,000 has
been granted for seawall repairs at
Moonta Bay. More than half of the
£200,000 allocated by Parliament for
storm damage repair remains to be ah
located, and claims and details of work
have not yet been submitted by WaL
laroo, Port Noarlunga, St. Kilda, Port
Broughton, Port Germein and Robe.
After seven months of freedom from
restrictions, there is still no sign of
easing in the cement supply in S.A.,
although local production is double
last year’s. Distributors seem to be
able to make no headway against the
backlog of orders. One major firm is
six months behind, and another has
8.000 tons of orders still in hand,
some dating back to 1949. A small
ratio of cancelled orders indicates that
duplication with several firms has little
to do with the apparent demand.
Production rate of the two kilns
operating by two companies is over
200.000 tons a year, but demand in
S.A. seems to be of the order of
250.000 tons a year, or at the rate of
about seven bags a head. Regarding
this as abnormal, as it is about two
bags above the Australian average,
cement authorities think the demand
may collapse quite suddenly. Like a
hungry man over'eating, the cement
consuming section of the community
is believed to have a few bags stowed
away because of its scarcity value.
Removal of the Brighton kiln to
the S.A. Portland Cement Company’s
new works at Angaston began early
this month. When it comes into op'
eration alongside the new 80,000'ton

A new move on high building costs
was made at the end of last month,
when the S.A. Institute of Architects
formed a committee to examine build'
ing costs in conjunction with similar
committees in other States. Special
emphasis will be given to finding ways
of reducing labor costs and improving
productivity and building practice,
especially with new materials and
methods, and general architectural
practice.
HOBART POLICE COURT.
This architect's design for the proposed

Committee. The new building, of two
storeys and a basement, will be erected

FOUR COTTAGE TYPES.
The group of sketch plans shows four variations on the theme of the small cottage with living room
and two bedrooms plus kitchen, bathroom and laundry. All have low-pitched roofs, three gabled
and the fourth (lower right) hipped. The upper right example is an attractive plan with the living
room free-standing as a separate wing with windows on one side and doors on the other, which
enables sun to be gained no matter which way the site is located in relation to the points of the
compass.
