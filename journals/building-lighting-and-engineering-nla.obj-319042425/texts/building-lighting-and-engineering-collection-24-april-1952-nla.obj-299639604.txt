Ever since that date the "United" brand has stood for
every good quality that is required in paint. Its popularity with
both trade and consumer is directly due to the "United" policy
which simply is, "The best materials and the best manufacturing

HOME BUILT FOR GRACEFUL LIVING
THE TUDOR STYLE.
An Attractive Home.
In spite of the many condemnations that are heard today of the anachronism of
building in an outmoded style, such as the Tudor, there is no doubt that it still has
many admirers both here and in the country of its origin. This large home at
Darling Point, Sydney, was erected in 1935, Architects being Peddle, Thorp &
Walker, and the Master Builder, J. Pettigrew.

NORTH SYDNEY MOTOR SHOWROOM.
The old Union de-luxe picture theatre. Miller Street, North Sydney, was burnt out some
years ago and for some time stood a gaunt roofless shell. It was recently reconstructed —the
brick walls were mainly sound—and has been remodelled as a motor showroom and service

Masonite Demonstrates Practical Means of Establishing and
Maintaining Good Industrial Relations
The rapid success of the Masonite
Industry in Australia has often been
referred to as a romance of industry,
mainly due to the excellence of its
product, its spontaneous reception by
the Australian user and to the financial
success of this new Australian industry.
As most people know, Masonite
Corporation commenced building its
works at Raymond Terrace, seventeen
miles north of Newcastle, N.S.W., in
1938. In 1939 the industry was in
commercial operation and, incidentally,
paid its first dividend of 8% in the
second year of its operation. The first
year the company produced ten million
feet of Masonite. Since then the pro-
duction graph shows an angle of ap-
proximately 45 degrees, output climb-
ing to last year’s record of eight-five
millions. [Concurrently, dividend rate
rose until it maintained a steady level
of 109 c with 2\ c /o bonus.]
Obviously these results could not be
achieved without firstly efficient man-
agement and second!’ 7 efficient and
harmonious workers' relations with the
management. Both have been ensured
by the energy and enthusiasm of the
original general manager of the com-
pany, Mr H. W. Morgan, who from
the very earliest stages encouraged the
establishment of the Masonite Workers’
Welfare Committee. From very small
beginnings this Committee now exer-
cises considerable and beneficial in-
fluence throughout the whole of the
Industry, which has never suffered any
strike or industrial disturbance—a re-
markable record when one considers
the location of the plant.
The Masonite Workers’
Welfare Committee
The Masonite Workers’ Welfare
Committee comprises representatives
drawn from all departments, and its
members comprise those from many
different unions. Over the years it
has evolved practical constitution and
regulations and elects its officers and
members every year.
For the first few years of its activi-
ties the Committee mainly concen-
trated on the raising of funds for the
purpose of taking care of such cases
of hardship as may occur mongst its
members and not covered by other
provisions. Its activities, however, soon
expanded to include a yearly Club,
whereby a cash distribution was made
back to members of subscriptions over
the vear. The Committee took care
of the endless round of subscription
lists common to other works. A star.''
dardised form of a farewell presenta-
tion to workers upon leaving the Indus- 1
try has proved very satisfactory, and
the provision of wreaths and other
similar activities are taken care of by
the Welfare Committee’s funds.
The Masonite Welfare Committee
early instituted the Masonite Annual
Ball, which from small beginnings in
the local hall has grown to a social
event in the city of Newcaste of con-
siderable attraction.
Ballot on Sporting
Amenities.
On the cessation of war-time con-
ditions, the Committee approached the
Masonite management regarding the
provision of sporting amenities. In
close co-operation, it was decided that
a ballot should be held amongst all
workers as to their preference as to
the type and order of such amenities.
This resulted in favour in the follow-
ing order: 1, swimming pool; 2, gym-
nasium; 3, tennis courts; 4, canteen;
5, social and recreational hall.
The preference for the swimming
pool was no doubt influenced by the
fact that although on the Hunter
River there were no swimming ameni-

ties in the township of Raymond Ter'
race, which at times suffers extreme
heat during the summer period.
In due course the proposals were
placed before the Board of Directors
and in 1949 an amount of £lO,OOO
was allocated for the purpose. Since
then other similar amounts have been
allocated from year to year, with the
result that the first half of the whole
programme is now established.
Swimming Pool Opened.
On sth March, 1950 —and marking
the holding of the first Australia'wide
Masonite Sales Convention —the swim'
ming pool and amenities block was
opened by the Chairman of Directors
of Masonite Corporation, Mr. E. S.
Wolfenden, to which the President of
the Masonite Welfare Committee, Mr.
W. Wood, and other officials suitably
responded.
The design of the swimming pool,
which although small is regarded as
being one of the finest in the State,
was carried out by Messrs. Pitt Pitt,
Newcastle architects to the company,
and the building was by Messrs. W.
Stronach Pty. Ltd. The pool itself is
55ft. long by 25ft. wide and is hand'
somely tiled with Australian' made
Redondo tiles in blue pastel shade. A
spacious sun piazza adjoins the pool
for sunbaking, from which leads the
ladies and gentlemen’s change'rooms.
A rather unusual feature of the pool
is the fact that the water used therein
is not in any way wasted or consumed,
for drawn originally from the sand'
bearing strata on which the Works is
situated, the water is suitably purified
and pumped into the pool, from which
it constantly overflows for further
treatment as boiler water. In this way
the swimming pool acts as a reservoir
and therefore no water is wasted.
The Gymnasium.
Adjoining the pool is a completely
fitted gymnasium with boxing ring and
wrestling mats and all kinds of weight'
lifting and gymnastic equipment. Un-
der the capable and experienced guid'
ance of a full-time physical instructor
employed by the Company, weight'
lifting, boxing, wrestling and other
classes find ready and constant sup-
port.
The whole of the area adjoining the
pool is beautifully lawned and land'
scaped, while nearby the Company
established a double set of tennis courts
complete with lighting for night play.
At the moment a suitable small tennis
clubhouse is being built.
Children’s Playground.
Still within the landscaped area, the
Company has recently established a
beautiful children’s playground. This
comprises a larve circular area filled
with beach sand and surrounded by a
coping. Within the sand area are
gaily-painted swings, see-saws, slippery
dips and other devices, all providing
constant pleasure and delight to the
children. The idea underlying the
provision of this area is that the
workers and their wives and children
can enjoy almost any recreation they
desire either during the week, after
shift hours, or during the weekend.
Identification cards are provided by
the Company and the enjoyment of
these amenities is confined tp the
workers within the Industry, their
wives and children and one friend in
the case of men and women employees
respectively.
Recreational Hall
To Be Built.
The second half of the programme
will, at a later date, comprise the estab'
lishment of a recreational hall suitable
for socials, dances and films— a small
canteen already having been establish'
ed.
All these amenities are provided en-
tirely free of charge, together with the
expert and qualified full'time physical
instructor. Asked whether or not these
amenities were found to be of practical
value, the General Manager, Mr. H.
W. Morgan, drew attention to the
daily attendance book, which showed
that an average of thirty to forty per'
sons were using some portion of the
amenities every day. Although not
long established, several social gather'
ings and physical culture displays have
been most successful and will undoubt'
edly maintain the interest in the
arious sports available.
Three Shifts Worked.
The Masonite Industry works all
the clock round on three eight'hour
shifts, but notwithstanding this, Mr.
Morgan said he was surprised to see
how many of both workers and staff
slipped over to the swimming pool or
gymnasium during their lunch hours
or, with the advent of the spring and
summer weather, immediately after the
knock-off of the 4 p.m. shift.'
Asked whether he felt the provision
of such amenities were of any real
practical value to industry, Mr. Morgan
stated that in his opinion the provision

of such amenities did much to bring
the workers and staff in the Industry
—who by reason of their varying work
in different departments might rarely
meet socially otherwise —together on a
social and sporting basis. In that way
he felt that the provision of such
amenitise tended to maintain and em
courage the team spirit which charac'
terised the Masonite Industry. He
felt, too, that the allocation of profits
for the provision of this type of
amenity showed practical consideration
of the workers in the Industry and he
felt, therefore, must be of considerable
psychological value.
A rather unusual aspect of the whole
matter was the interest displayed by
the women workers in the Industry,
several of whom were maintaining
regular interest and attendance in the
classes for eurythmics and other suit'
able physical culture.
And so, side by side with industrial
and financial growth in the Masonite
Industry, we see the growth of the
Welfare Club, which in this particular
industry at least is exerting a beneficial
influence.
And what a pleasant story it makes
in this world of bickering and strife.
Masonite is indeed making a many'
sided contribution to Australia’s de-
velopmcnt.
Modern Maternity Hospital
at Hornsby
WILL BE ASSET TO DISTRICT.
The British Centre, which was erect'
ed in Hyde Park, Sydney, during the
war at a cost of about £56,000, is
now being re-erected, and extended
to serve Hornsby district as a modern
maternity hospital.
The cost, when completed, will be
somewhere about £120,000.
The history of this project is inter'
esting.
At the end of the war the British
Centre (which had rendered out'
standing service) was no longer need'
ed, and Cr. S. R. Storey, M.L.A., of
Hornsby, commenced negotiations to
purchase the buildings for re'erection
in Hornsby near the District Hospi-
tal.
It was originally planned to use
the structure as a Convalescent Hos'
pital for patients from Parramatta,
Ryde, North Shore and Hornsby hos'
pitals.
The purchase price was to be one
pound, and the cost of removal and
re'erection was then estimated to be
in the neighbourhood of £202,000.
The building was finally acquired
in November, 1946, and its demoli-
tion and removal to Hornsby cost
over £50,000.
At that time the Minister would
not make available funds for its re-
erection, and consequently much val-
uable material and timbers were de-
stroyed.
Plans Changed.
As time went by, it was decided to
alter the purpose of the building to
a Maternity Hospital, and the plans
were considerably amended before re*
construction started in September,
1949.
The amended plans provided for a
larger building by creating an open
area between the front and rear sec-
tions of the old building and provide
ing for a light well and two new wings
for nursery and administration on the
ground floor and nurses’ rooms and
amenities on the second floor.
The new hospital will accommodate
fifty patients on the ground floor, and
the second floor will be occupied by
nurses and staff, totalling about seventy'
five in all.
Job Progressing.
After three years, considerable pro'
gress has been made on the job, and
the framework, walls and roofing are
all in position.
However, much still remains to be
done before the hospital is ready to
serve the district.
In the fifty new rooms provided for
nurses and staff some 50 cases of
masonite will be used, and these quart'
ers, along with other rooms, annexes,
etc., will need 200 new doors.
Kitchens, washrooms, etc., will re'
quire 35 stainless steel sinks.
The new building has already be'
come a district landmark, and when
completed the Maternity Hospital
will be a monument to a group of
citizens who had the courage to tackle
a mighty task and the tenacity to see
it through.
BOXING AND TENNIS.

ing and wrestling rings where tuition is

instructor. (Bottom) The two well-equipped
tennis courts.
FUNCTIONALISM IN PRACTICE.
This large administrative block to a British production plant recently completed is an excellent
example of functionalism—without extremism—in architectural design. A maximum of window
area provides the basic need of ample natural light to the interior for the office workers, while
the flat roof and simple fenestration reflect the straight forwardness of the reinforced concrete
design

BUILDING EXPERTS
EVOLVE NEW BRICK
MULTI-PURPOSE BRICK SOLVES MANY
PROBLEMS—AND EARNS GREAT PRAISE
There is only one material today
which after going through a complete
process of manufacture, and compris-
ing a mass of material averaging
seven lbs., will give a thousand years’
service and which costs less than 2|d.
each. That material is the common
brick, and it is well to bear this in
mind when one hears a question as
to the present cost of building.
We are satisfied if most of the
things we buy give only a small frac-
tion of the service that bricks will
give.
To this day there are great mounds
of brick marking the spot where the
ancient city of Babylon used to stand,
the bricks being the only vestige that
is left of that ancient city.
The history of civilisation may be
said to be written in brick.
Common brick has been bound up
with the history and progress of the
humm race since the first dawn of
civilisation. Khammurabbi, the great
lawgiver of Babylon, mentioned in
the book of Genesis as Amraphel and
who lived about 2350 8.C., was prob-
ably the first common brick manufac-
turer to trademark his brick.
King Nebuchadnezza also put his
own stamps on the bricks he made.
That he made a good product is
proved by the fact that many bricks
bearing his mark are in the walls of
many buildings in actual use today.
Partner of Good Construction.
Although many substitutes have
been devised to take its place, noth'
ing has proved so practical and sat'
isfactory in every way as brick. Its
strength, durability, fire-resistiveness
and dryness make it worthy to be
called “the partner of good construe-
tion.”
Brick is a material of such generally
accepted excellence that it still re-
mains the most widely used and most
durable unit for building construction.
In fact, it is the builders’ Raw Ma-
terial No. 1.
Through the ages the shape of the
little block of baked clay measuring
9 in. by 4\ in. by 3 in. has changed
little, if at all, and it has remained
for Australian inventiveness, plus
Australian “Know-How,” to bring
about a radical, revolutionary change
in its design.
In fact, two practical, knowledgable
Australians have invented a new
brick, known as the General Purpose
Bullnose Brick (vide diagram No. 1).
Great Achievement.
To invent and develop a new type
of building brick, amazingly versatile
and withall structurally strong, is a
great achievement, and a very inter-
esting story lays behind the whole
project.
One may say the story started
many years ago, as far back as 1914.
when Mr. H. Garvan became Chief
Instructor in Building Construction
at the Sydney Technical College.
As can be imagined, many pupils
passed through Mr. Garvan’s classes
during the years between (he retired
early this year), and many of those
pupils are today prominent in the
Australian building industry.
Among the pupils was Mr. Norman
Shortus, now General Foreman for
the H. W. Thompson Pty. Ltd., Syd-
ney Master Builders, and it was while
Mr. Garvan was recently visiting his
ex-pupil, Mr. Shortus, on one of the
Thompson organisations’ Housing
Commission jobs, that the idea for
the new brick was born.
First of Kind.
At that time, H. W. Thompson
Ptv Ltd. was erecting the first star'
shaped flats to be built in Australia,
in Devonshire Street, Surry Hills,
with Mr. Shortus in charge of gen'
eral construction.
For many years Mr. Garvan had
kept in touch with his ex'pupils by
visiting them on the job and discussing
with them at firsthand the problems
posed by the jobs they were working
on.
The Devonshire Street job, being
the first of its kind —a star-shaped
block of 45 flats —with 120 degree
squint corners, it was only natural
that the whys and wherefores of the
brickwork would come up for discus'
sion, among other things.
The sum total of Mr. Garvan’s
visits was this: why not design a spec'
ial brick for this particular job, Mr.
Shortus suggested.
“That’s quite an idea,’’ replied
Mr. Garvan. “I’ll give the matter
some thought.”
Like a good builder, who is never
finished wrestling with construction
problems, Mr. Garvan mulled the
idea over, and the more he thought
about it, the more certain he became
that there was an easy way to do a
difficult job.
Mr. Shortus, too, was thinking the
problem out, and the two men fre'
quently met and pooled their ideas,
“thrashing it hard,” as Mr. Shortus
said.
Idea Comes.
Then the idea came, as ideas do,
when Mr. Garvan remarked that “no
orthodox brick would do the job as
quickly as a special brick could.”
That’s it, he said, we must design
a special brick to do a special job.
Putting their heads and their ideas
together, the teacher and his ex'pupil

evolved a multi-purpose bullnose
brick, which can be used for any
angle at all; which has already solv-
ed many building problems, and the
use of which will greatly enhance the
architectural features of all buildings,
as can be seen from a study of the
accompanying diagrams.
Now In Production.
The new General Purpose Bullnose
Bricks are now in full production at
the N.S.W. State Brickworks, and are
available to builders at no greater
cost than orthodox bricks.
The State Brickworks manager, Mr.
P. H. Thomson, told “Construction”
that he knows of no other brick which
can be used in so many ways.
“This brick is manufactured no-
where else in the world, and I con-
sider it will prove of the utmost ser-
vice to the building industry,” Mr.
Thomson said.
He explained that one of its great
features, from a manufacturers’ point
of view, was that no new machinery
was required to produce it.
All that was called for was an al-
teration in the mould.
The bricks, now in production, are
being supplied to H. W. Thompson
Pty. Ltd., who are proceeding with
the erection of a further number of
star-shaped blocks of 45 flats each in
Devonshire Street for the N.S.W.
Housing Commission.
Master Builders’ Views.
Mr. C. E. Thompson, president of
the N.S.W. Master Builders’ Associa-
tion, and managing director of H. W.
Thompson Pty. Ltd., is very enthus-
iastic about the new brick.
“It has solved a multitude of prob-
lems for us in the erection of these
Surry Hills flats,” Mr. Thompson told
“Construction.”
“It is interesting to note that in
the lifetime of present-day builders
no new brick has previously been
designed. We have all had to make
do with orthodox designs cut to suit
various conditions.”
Both Mr. Shortus and Mr. Garvan
are generous in their praise for Mr.
C. E. Thompson who, they said, gave
them every possible advice, encour-
agement, and help during the time
the design for the brick was being
evolved, and since.
“A large measure of our success
belongs to Mr. Thompson,” Mr.
Shortus said.
“He realised the great importance
of designing a versatile multi-purpose
brick.
“Both Mr. Garvan and I are proud
that H. W. Thompson’s are the first
master builders to use it,” Mr.
Shortus added.

Favourable comment regarding the
new brick has been made by the ar-
chitects responsible for the big Hous-
ing Commission project at Devonshire
Street.
Messrs. D. T. Morrow and Gordon,
and Mr. J. Aubrey Kerr, architects in
association, are reported to be very
pleased with the finish achieved with
the brick, and speak highly of its
many uses in construction.
NEW SWEDISH WINDOW.
The famous Swedish architect, Eric
Sigfrid Person, known as the invent-
or of the full-view window, has re-
cently invented a new type window.
Constructed of aluminium-coated
metal, the window frames have built-
in Venetian blinds, invisible when
hoisted, and with rounded lower corn-
ers for dusting. This window, known
as the Elumin, is the result of seven
years of experimenting and 10,000
blueprints before it was perfected.
The first church service held on
Victorian soil was conducted by Rev.
R. Knopwood, near Sorrento, in
1803.
HARNESSING WINDS TO
GENERATE ELECTRICITY.
The British Electricity Authority
plans to harness the winds to gener-
ate electrical power, using a chain of
giant windmills 250 ft. high capable
of producing 1000 kilowatts and ex-
tending from the Orkneys in the
north, through the Hebrides and
West Scotland to West Wales and
then down to Cornwall in the south.
Government consent has been given
to this project.
Designed by Enfield Cables the
propellers of the wind driven genera-
tors are not connected by gearing to
the turbine. The blades of the pro-
peller are hollow and have airholes
at their tip. When the propeller
revolves, the air is driven out from
these holes by centrifugal force and
this causes suction in a hollow tower
on which the propeller is mounted.
Air is then drawn in through aper-
tures at the base of the tower and
the force it generates in the mounting
tower drives a turbine.
THE PLASTIC DESIGN
OF TWO-PINNED MILD
STEEL ARCH RIBS.
An article under the above heading
in “Civil Engineering and Public
Works Review,” by Arnold W.
Hendry, reveals the growing interest
amongst structural engineers in the
plastic theory of design when applied
to structures fabricated from mild steel.
Mr. Hendry develops this method for
arch bridge design from previous in-
vestigations in connection with the
application of the plastic theory to the
design of welded bridge girders and
portal frames. He points out that, in
general, a two-pinned arch will fail
when the plastic moment has been
reached at two sections in the rib,
i.e., when plastic hinges are formed at
a sufficient number of points to make
the structure a mechanism.
In Britain the Steel Structures Re-
search Committee has been engaged
since 1929 in studying the behaviour
of steel structures under stress. It was
concluded that the ordinary elastic
theory of design was too complicated
to form a rational design method for
redundant steel structures.
Much pioneering work on the ap-
plication of the plastic design method
has been carried out by Professor J.
F. Baker and his associate workers.
Cold working within the plastic
range is commonly carried out in
forming steel members of structures.
The plastic theory recognises that
plastic deformations may take place at
points of stress concentration in a steel
structure without necessarily impairing
the strength of the structure as a
whole.
Under the elastic theory of bending,
the stress decreases from that at the
extreme fibre towards the neutral axis.
The cannon stress-strain diagram
for mild steel shows a nearly horizon-
tal line following the yield point, un-
til a degree of strain-hardening takes
place, when the curve again rises.
From this it may be deduced that
once the extreme fibre of a bent steel
member passes the yield point no fur-
ther stress increase takes place in it,
while the inner fibre layers are being
stressed in succession up to the yield
point.
It may be deduced from this fact
that the theoretical maximum moment
of resistance is 1.5 times that obtained
by the elastic theory in the case of a
rectangular section. In other cases the
ratio depends on the “shape factor. ’
For most ordinary steel beam sections
the ratio is approximately 1.15 to 1.

SNOW LAND OR TROPICAL SUNSHINE
AUSTRALIA'S MAGNIFICENT SNOW COUNTRY
THE CHALET,
CHARLOTTE PASS, KOSCIUSKO.
Completed in June, 1939 to replace the former small chalet that was
burnt down, the Chalet at Charlotte Pass, Mt. Kosciusko, in its gay checked
walls and general design captures some of the gaiety of the hotels and
chalets that serve the skiers in Switzerland and Australia. Now the old
hotel further down the mountains has been destroyed by fire and so the
ever-increasing number of young snow enthusiasts with only the Chalet’s
limited accommodation to rely upon have to be disappointed in their en-
deavour to enjoy an exhilarating holiday amongst the snow. One hears of
various grandiose schemes for new hotels, alpine villages, etc., but the
years go by and material shortages and high costs play their respective parts
in defeating this very desirable expansion. Australia’s snowlands compare
with the world’s best and it is a national asset that should be exploited to
the full. Winter again approaches and many eyes look to Kosciusko for
relaxation and healthy pleasure on the roof of Australia. Every effort
should be made for them to gratify this desire.

AUSTRALIA'S HOLIDAY OFFERINGS
SUNSHINE AND SURF IN QUEENSLAND
THE SURFERS’ PARADISE HOTEL,
SURFERS’ PARADISE, QUEENSLAND.
Situated some fifty miles from Brisbane Surfers ’ Paradise owes its existence
and popularity throughout Australia to Mr. Jim Cavill, who built this hotel
in 1938 and never ceased until his recent death at the great age of ninety
in praising and enlarging the virtues of this beach and climate. He intro-
duced as an adjunct to the hotel, log cabins which have proved most popu-
lar and have since been utilised in other projects such as the Royal Hayman
Hotel and are, of course, extremely popular in American holiday resorts
in Florida and California. Australia is a huge Continent and can provide
snow sports or tropical sunshine for the holiday seeker but the stumbling
block has always been appropriate hotel accommodation and over the past
decade there has hardly been a new building of this type —with the notable
exception of the Royal Hayman—erected. Although there are many
problems besetting the country at present surely the time is past when some
effort should be made to build new hotels and holiday resorts for our ever
expanding population. To talk of a tourist industry otherwise is a farce.


New Roman Catholic Church,
Earlwood, Sydney
Architect, L. P. Burns. Master Builder, A. W. Edwards Pty, Ltd.
This large new church has been de-
signed in a Mediterranean style of
architecture to match existing build-
ings on the site.
The church consists of nave, tran-
septs, sanctuary and side aisles, while
in addition there are seven chapels,
which will be dedicated to various
purposes, one of which will be a
memorial to soldiers of the two wars.
There is a dome rising to 85ft. over
the crossing and a campanile on the
south-west corner which is 132 ft. high.
The main axis of the church is east
and west, with the sanctuary at the
eastern end, and the main entrances
are placed at the western end of the
nave and the northern transept.
The seating accommodation of the
church will be approximately 850.
Owing to the fall in the ground, it
was possible to obtain a parish hall in
: the basement under the church, equal
in floor area to the church itself, with
a ceiling height of 12ft. under the
beams, and this will accommodate a
similar number to the church above.
The structure generally will consist
of a steel frame supported by a rein-
forced concrete base with 4£in. screen
walls forming the inside and outside
surfaces, with a cavity 2ft. wide in
between brick walls, through which
the steel frame will rise. The tower
will be similarly constructed with a
steel frame, lined on both sides with
brickwork.
The church will be finished with a
face brick base externally and stuccoed
walls above, with an aluminium dome
over the crossing. The main roofing
material will be Marseilles tiles. Door
and window trims will be in synthe;ic
sandstone, and internallv the walls
will be finished in cement render with
a coffered plaster ceiling suitably en-
riched over the sanctuary.
Work on the project was com'
menced about eighteen months ago,
and it is hoped that the job will be
completed in about eighteen months
from now.
WINDSOR CASTLE BELFRY
IN DANGER.
Massive oak timbers, nearly five
centuries old, of the belfry in the
Curfew Tower at Windsor Castle are
in danger of collapse owing to rot,
and the Dean and Chapter of St.
George s Chapel, who are responsible
for the Curfew Tower, have ordered
immediate repairs.
Vibration and the full circular
swing of the bells, which weigh nine
tons, might cause them to fall, so
they are not to be rung until repair
work has been completed. The
muffled peal, which would normally
have been rung at the death of the
King, was omitted on that occasion.
The belfry was built in 1478 when
work on the building of St. George’s
Chapel had begun. It has not been
materially altered since.
THE PERSPECTIVE.
THE PLAN.
AN AGE OF SLATS.
Modern designers are very fond of louvres—
both horizontal and vertical, and set at all
angles, as appurtenances to their structures.
Some applications serve a useful purpose as
sun deflectors, others are purely decorative
(sic). It is not clear which role is fulfilled
by the upper example. The thin tubular sup-
ports to the heavy concrete cantilever porch
slab-studded with what are apparently glass
rosettes —is a variation to the usual severe
single uprights.

Coventry Cathedral
STRIKING MODERN DESIGN FOR NEW CATHEDRAL.
The concentrated German hate that
was hurled from the skies upon the
great British motor centre of Coven'
try created a new and dreadful word
in our language: “coventrate” which
means to saturate with destruction.
Along with the houses of the people
the House of God suffered under the
barbarians’ rain of bombs and the fine
Gothic Cathedral was destroyed, all
save its graceful tower and enclosing
walls.
At the end of the war as they look'
ed around at their wounds the people
of Coventry gave immediate thought
to the rebuilding of their Cathedral
and Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the de'
signer of the great Liverpool Gath'
ederal, produced an unusual design for
a new edifice, embracing what re'
mained of the old Cathedral. Certain
differences of ideas arose and Sir Giles
withdrew and in due course an ar'
chitectural competition was held for
the design of the new Cathedral. This
was adjudicated towards the end of
last year and was won by 44'year'old
Basil Spence, 0.8. E., F.R.1.8.A., the
adjudicators being Sir Percy Thomas,
Mr. Edward Maufe and Mr. Howard
Robertson. The first premium was
.£2OOO.
The design is most unusual and is
best described in the assessors’ report:
“In selecting this design we not
only feel that it is the best design sub'
mitted, but that it is one which shows
that the author has qualities of spirit
and imagination of the highest order.
He lets the conditions grow under
his hand to produce a splendid cath'
edral, and as the conditions are un-
usual, the resulting conception is urn
usual, revealing the author’s ability
to solve the problem of designing a
cathedral in terms of contemporary
architecture.
“The author in his report stresses
the beauty of the existing destroyed
cathedral as an eloquent memorial to
the courage of the people of Coven'
try, and states it as his opinion that
the major part of it should be allow'
ed to stand as a Garden of Rest,
treating it as an atrium to the new
cathedral which ‘should grow out of
the old cathedral and be incomplete
without it’.”
The slope and outline of the new
Cathedral is impressively simple and
the shallow vault roof will be of rein'
forced shell concrete approximately
thick covered with copper. The
internal columns will be tall and ele'
gant of steel encased in concrete,

Seating capacity in the Nave is 1374
the whole being planned on top of
heated floor slabs. All the windows in
the staggered side walls shine towards
the altar and away from the eyes of
the congregation. Behind the altar
there is to be a huge modern tapestry
while the altar will be surmounted by
the charred cross from the old Cath'
edral.
Great importance is given to the
stained glass windows; with the ex'
ception of the bapistery windows and
those lights over the entrance to the
Chapel of Unity, all windows shine
towards the altar. Behind the font
the glass is very pale, almost white,
with a slight tint of rose and pale
blue, and moving towards the altar,
the next windows are composed in
tones of green and yellow represent'
ing youth. The next pink and red,
representing puberty, the next —the
age of experience—are multicoloured,
then the age of wisdom —the windows
are deep blue and purple—and, fin'
ally, the altar windows of golden glass.
As in life, the colour of the win'
dows is revealed only as you reach
each stage—the past is known, the
future is not. Only when the altar
is reached the whole range of colour
is seen for the first time.

Report on St, Michael’s Agricultural
College, Goulburn
Architect: Louis P. Burns.
(see illustrations on opposite page)
Some eighteen months ago, the
Roman Catholic authorities in Goul-
burn purchased a property of many
acres of sheep country on which is
situated a fairly large house of some
eighty years’ standing. The property
was purchased for the purpose of
making it into an agricultural college
where students of school age would be
trained in agricultural science and the
various trades associated with these
activities.
It was intended that the premises
would provide for the accommodation
of 100 students and about 30 teachers.
The existing house was capable of
accommodating some 30 persons and
provision had to be made for additional
accommodation for the rest, at the
same time providing all the necessary
amenities which will be required in the
new establishment.
Various additional wings have been
planned to contain dormitory and
lavatory blocks and private accommo'
dation for the teachers,
In addition, a new chapel is con'
tained in a wing by itself with the
necessary offices attached,
Owing to the fall of the ground, it
has been possible to achieve a gym'
nasium, an armoury, garages, etc., un-
derneath the main dormitory wings,
Another wing provides for the din-
ing room, which will be used on
occasions as an assembly hall. At the
same time, the kitchen and laundry
have been enlarged and provided with
all modern equipment to fulfil their
proper functions.
Adjoining the main house and some
hundred yards or so to the east there
was in existence a two-storey brick
building previously used as stables and
garages. It is intended to convert this
FINE NEW BRITISH FACTORY
building, by raising the floors and prO'
viding normal ceiling height, into the
school section of the project. This will
contain a wool'dassing section, a wood'
working section, metal working section
and a welbequipped laboratory in ad'
dition to five lecture rooms.
Practical work, in the way of re'
pairs to farm machinery, will be car'
ried on in another section of the pro'
perty, for which provision is being
made.
In addition to these buildings, addi'
tional facilities are being provided in
the way of a model dairy planned upon
the most advanced lines, a piggery and
fowl runs, whilst an adequate area of
land is being set aside for the produc'
tion of vegetables, fruit and various
fodder crops.
The project generally should pro'
vide for the utmost in teaching facili'
ties for boys who are anxious to make
the land their livelihood.
Work has already progressed very
well on the project, and it is hoped
to open the college on the first term
of 1953.
It is anticipated that the cost of the
project will be in the neighbourhood
of £200,000.
This new building recently completed is typical of the fine type of industrial units that are
being erected in Great Britain today. It is the new Research and Development building of
The Simon Engineering Group at Cheadle Heath. Simplicity of massing and silhouette com-
bined with ample window area are the salient features.

The Construction Industries Fair and
Convention
£ 1,000,000 CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ON DISPLAY.
“I am convinced,” said the Prem-
ier of N.S.W., Hon. 1. J. Cahill, in
officially opening the Construction In-
dustry Fair on April 8, “that Austra-
lia has the ability to build a better
world in this great Continent of
ours.”
To look around this most compre-
hensive and interesting Fair, which
shows an amazing variety of huge
machines to perform all manner of
herculean tasks —nearly all of which
are made in Australia- and to see
in the displays by the various Gov-
ernment construction authorities the
great developmental schemes in which
these giants are to pit their strength
against Nature, is also to share the
Premier’s confidence and conviction.
In appealing for the national unity
necessary to achieve this development
Mr. Cahill said that “the things that
unite us arc greater than those which
divide us.”
Excellent Layout.
The Fair is located adjacent to the
R.A.S. Showgrounds in Grand Drive,
Moore Park, and was granted to the
organisers by the City Council when
the Fair was originally planned to
coincide with the Royal Visit, it being
the first time that this area has been
granted for such purpose. The area
is large and narrow and has been well
laid out with the various company’s
exhibits to the front separated by large
marquees towards the rear, having the
displays brought together by the var-
ious Government and semi-Govern-
ment constructing authorities, each of
which is denoted by a hanging sign
bearing its emblem, adjacent to the
broad promenade.
Amazing Equipment.
The manner in which earth-mov-
ing and allied equipment from very
humble beginnings a little over a de-
cade ago, has gone forward in Aus-
tralia is little short of miraculous
when one views the great display of
massive equipment of all types which
dwarf mere man with their great size
and strength, but which still answer
to his every wish by the pressure of a
switch or the throwing of a lever from
the control cabins. It was not very
long ago that a bulldozer was an
American novelty; today there is an
ever-growing family of the special
units developed to perform specific
tasks: angle-dozers, carry-all scrapers,
rippers and rooters, logging winches
and arches .... crawler tractors have
doubled their drawbar pull in the last
ten years and Australian equipment
manufacturers have been quick to see
to it that their machines match them
in strength and capacity.
Departmental Displays.
The Departmental displays include
Works and Housing, Main Roads,
Forestry Commission, Railways, Mari'
time Services. Snowy Mountains
Authority, Public Works, and Water
and Sewerage Board.
The Snowy Mountains Hydro'Elec'
trie Authority display endeavours to
impart some idea of the great scope
and ramifications of this huge concep'
tion and looking at the photographs
of the rugged terrain in which tunnels
and dams have to be made one more
than realises the need for the great
size and strength of the plant re'
splendent in its paint of many hues
that stand impatiently by. A large
model shows the various lakes and
dams in the mountainous Southern
Alps and the manner in which they
are to be inter-connected by tunnels
to utilise their great head to generate
electricity.
The Department of Public Works
also exhibits another model of the
Adaminaby Dam. Models of the
Warragamba Dam in the Water
Board Exhibit and of the new Power
House at Lake Macquarie in the Rail-
way's display all serve to emphasise
the many great national projects that
are under way.
This Fair, which is the first of its
kind to be staged in Australia, has
been modelled on the Annual Road
Show and Convention of the Ameri-
can Road Builders' Association,
which for some fifty years has brought
together the designers and users of
such equipment and which it is con-
sidered has played an important part
in the great progressiveness of this
industry in the United States.

start new ones.
At the present time the credit re'

The Use of Machines on Building and Construction Projects
By M. R. HORNIBROOK, F.A.I.B.
Managing Director, M. R. Hornibrook Pty. Ltd., and Vice-President, Australian
Institute of Builders.
Delivered before the Construction Industries Convention on April 9, 1952.
The use of machines in building
and construction projects can be best
illustrated, I consider, by briefly com-
paring the work performed by
machines wi.h that done by hand
methods before the mechanical age,
and in doing this I will only deal with
machines with which I have had ex-
perience.
Could James Watt, who patented his
steam engine in 1769, see the indus-
trial field as presented by this “Con-
struction Industries Fair” he would be
astounded by the modern machines
energised by steam, electricity, com-
pressed air and internal combustion
which we accept as part and parcel of
daily living. However, arriving at
this standard has not been simple, as
prejudice and conservatism —that atti-
tude of “what was for father is
good enough for his son” —has often
been a stumbling block to progress, as
I shall illustrate throughout this paper.
As human nature does not change, I
expect this attitude will be encounter-
ed all along the line, but fortunately
there are always folk with vision and
enterprise who are willing to try in-
novation and so progress in industry
cannot be thwarted.
Building and construction covers a
wide field from domestic dwellings,
commercial buildings, industrial plants
to large civil engineering projects,
such as bridges, tunnels, hydro-electric
and water conservation schemes, in-
cluding vast dams and the reticulation
of water through miles of pipeline.
Timber Logging.
Throughout, whatever the structure,
the use of timber is essential, and here
we make our first comparison. Over
the past two decades there has been a
revolutionary change in the snigging
and hauling of logs from the forest to
the mill by tractor which has replaced
the bullock teams of years gone by.
The machine, unlike the bullocks, is
not limited and so to-day we do not
hear that it is too wet to work the
bullocks or that on account of dry
times there is no grass for them and
they cannot work.
The con ribution which the tractor
is making to the building industry has
been fully demonstrated during the
drought period in Queensland recently,
and no doubt in other parts of the
Commonwealth, too, when loggers
were able to reach timber which was
inaccessible in ordinary seasonal times
on account of boggy tracks and creeks
having dried out.
The felling of the trees by power-
driven chain saws has been a boon to
the timber-getter and the pit sawyer,
for cutting logs has given way entirely
to the power-driven circular and band
saws.
The introduction of the Fork Lift
into the industry for the purpose of
picking up logs and stacks of sawn tim-
ber also has increased output appre-
ciably.
Excavation and Earth Moving.
The first job in a building contract
is the excavation for the basement and
foundations, and for that one must
have an air compressor, and I shall
deal separately with this unit later.
Prior to pneumatic drills for the
drilling of blast holes and pneumatic
picks for excavating hard material this
was a laborious lob when done by
hand.
The invention of high carbon steels
has greatly facilitated drilling, and the
speed and volume of output so over-
shadows the old hand methods that
the up-to-date contractor considers
these pneumatic tools indispensable.
In this phase of the work the in-
troduction of power shovels, excava-
tors, rippers, bulldozers, tractors, earth
scoops and tipping trucks has made
possible giant undertakings which
would be prohibitive if the old
methods performed by horse-drawn
ploughs, scoops and tip-drays were em-
ployed.
The power shovel is a mighty piece
of machinery and is the master of all
excavators as it will cope with all
classes of material and on large jobs
will handle excavation cheaper than
any other type of standard machine.
The bulldozer is one of the most
popular ma.chines for excavation and
its introduction has been the means
of cheapening the cost of earthworks
more than any other machine. When
it first arrived here it was capable of
doing work for l/6d. per cubic yard
which was costing 4/6d. to 5/-d. by
other methods.
On medium-sized jobs, where rock
is not encoun ered and the l p ad is
short, it can do work more cheaply
than all other types of excavators, and
being mobile and inexpensive to trans'
port it has that advantage over the
heavy mechanical shovel.
Shovels and drag-scoops have been
in use for many years and the skim'
mer and back'hoe have proved worthy
attachments to these units.
Where the ground is suitable and
conditions favourable, the trench dig'
ger is a machine of great value for
pipe lines, cable-laying, etc.
Tractor front-end loaders, although
only a few years ago were regarded
as useless, to-day, owing to improve'
ments by the makers, are a good piece
of equipment for a contractor as they
do their particular class of work
efficiently and are mobile and easy to
manoeuvre.
Big progress has been made in
power graders for levelling areas and
grading roads and these are an indis-
pensible unit for the road builder.
An extremely useful little machine
which I must not forget to mention is
the post'hole digger. It is a boon to
the man on the land as it bores the
holes in the ground and bores the
posts for the wires, thus simplifying
the fencing problem.
Types of Pumps.
Every construction man will agree
with me that the de-watering of foun-
dations, shaf:s, etc., is a job which can
be most exasperating if unsuitable
pumps are used, for the water is most-
ly dirty and polluted by the excava-
tion work in progress. There is a
large variety of pumps and I propose
to deal with only the most suitable for
this work.
I consider the best type available for
shaft-sinking is the air-lift sump pump
driven by compressed air, as it will
pump very dirty water and is easily
handled in a shaft, requiring only a
hose pipe to supply compressed air
and a canvas hose to take the water
away. These pumps can be worked
in tandem to cope with high heads..
As the grit in the wa’er is severe on
the impellers, naturally there is a
great deal of wear. However, in
spite of that, this new invention is a
valuable piece of equipment to the
shaft-sinker.
Another pump, not so new, is the
pulsome er, which is worked by steam
and capable of pumping very muddy
34

water; in fact, it will pump water
carrying as much as 33% of mud.
These pumps are supplied in sizes to
take from 2in. to 6in. pipes. As the
name suggests, its action, which forms
a vacuum, sucks and expels alternate'
ly. It will move a large volume of
water and requires little steam.
The diaphragm pump is also another
excellent type for the pumping of
muddy water and when mounted on a
trolley and powered with an internal
combustion engine can be moved
easily. Despite the wear and tear on
the diaphragms, which have to be re'
placed regularly, this is a most useful
pump.
The self'priming centrifugal pump
is a newcomer and has been much ap'
preciated, as we all know how aggra'
vating it can be when a pump refuses
to pick up the water.
For de'watering very deep shafts
the Deep Well pump is most suitable.
This pump is in the centrifugal class
and is fitted with a vertical type of
motor placed on the top of the shaft.
The pipe leading to the bottom is used
to carry the shafting which drives the
impellers at the bottom as well as
acting as a pipeline to carry the water
to the surface.
The feature of this pump is that all
of the impellers are mounted on a
common shaft at the base and for
every 20ft. in depth one impeller is
added (or five for every 100 ft.).
This pump is capable of pumping a
big volume of water and does not
need priming to start.
Flooding of the well or shaft does
not affect the pump because the im'
pellors are submerged and the motor
is on the surface. Two of these pumps
are in use on the construction of the
Brisbane River tunnel pumping water
from shafts 220 ft. deep.
The airdift ejector has proved its
usefulness in removing excavation from
flooded positions, such as deep shafts,
pier foundations, etc. These ejectors
can be made in sizes from 3in. to
12in. and are worked by compressed
air and water. They require a big
supply of air and the water taken out
of the shaft must be replaced. The
nearer the water to the surface or point
of delivery the better it operates. The
material being excavated must be
loosened to allow it to be picked up
bv suction.
Scaffolding and Formwork
and Reinforcement.
Although not a machine, scaffolding
plays a very important part in build'
ing construction. Since the war, great
advancement has been made in the
building trade by the use of steel
scaffolding replacing wooden poles and
sawn timber.
In the old days we had to re'bind
the Doles with rope after a certain
period of use as the rope deteriorated.
However, with the introduction of
steel clamps this is eliminated.
Also, steel props, clamps, steel shut'
tering and various other means are
fast taking the place of sawn timber
for concrete forms and we can look
forward to great changes in the near
future.
For the purpose of preparing rein'
forcing sleel, the contractor, in keep'
ing with modern development, should
install in his workshop power'driven
machines for cropping and bending
steel, and an electric butt'welder. This
latter unit eliminates waste, as the rods
are welded together to make a con'
tinuous length of steel. The welds are
dependable and the rods can be crop'
ped to any length.
Concrete Mixing
and Handling.
The vital part that concrete plays
in construction is obvious, and the
concrete mixer is one of the essentials
in the contractor's equipment.
Much prejudice was shown towards
its introduction, and I can remember
38 years ago some architects objecting
to concrete being mixed by a machine,
and on one occasion I had to turn the
dry components over twice before
being permitted to put them into the
mixer.
Readynnixed concrete has now en'
tered the field, and the objections to
its use are being rapidly overcome,
as it must be conceded it provides
some great advantages; chief of which,
perhaps, is the saving of storage of
concrete materials on jobs where space
is limited.
Another development in this phase
of the industry is the installation of
bulk cement plants on jobs. To give
you some idea of their economic ad'
vantage, my firm is installing two
plants in Brisbane on power house
jobs, and by handling the cement in
this way the purchases will be ap'
proximalely £l per ton less than in
bags. Cartage contractors are also pro'
viding special equipment to deliver
bulk cement.
The conveying of concrete from
point of mixing to position of placing
on the job has gone through various
phases, from the hauling of it in
buckets with a rope and gin wheel;
lifting it in barrow loads with a winch;
lifting it by a horse to take the place
of a winch; taking it up in a concrete
tower aond delivering in chutes; lift'
ing by crane in special bottonvdump
buckets to pumping it through pipes
with the aid of a concrete pump. All
these methods are in practice to'day,
depending on the size and class of the
job. I do not propose to elaborate
on them as they are welhknown with
the exception of pumping of concrete.
This system has not been adopted
in Australia to any great extent, pos'
sibly on account of the original high
cos; of such plant, but where a job is
large enough and lends itself to this
method consideration should be given
to its use.
Concrete can be pumped horizon'
tally for 1200 feet or vertically 150
feet. It can be deposited in position
by moving of the pipeline at point of
delivery or pumped into a hopper for
removal by barrows or concrete carts.
The plant consists of one or two con'
Crete mixers, concrete pump, piping
and air compressor; the pump and
piping being the only special items.
The pump is a complicated piece of
mechanism and requires expert atteiv
tion, otherwise it can be most trouble'
some and easily put out of commission.
However, in spi.e of its bad habits,
which can be overcome, the value de'
rived from the plant is well worth'
while.
A concrete pumping plant is high'
ly advantageous in tunnelling and
sewerage work, and recently we placed
concrete in position by pumping it
down shafts 70ft. deep and 1000 ft.
along the invert . Three and a half
hours was the time taken to place
32ft. of sft. 3in. diameter barrel with
12in. concrete walls, and in some
places as much as 75% extra concrete
for overbreak was required. This
method had the advantage of packing
the concrete tightly against the crown
of the tunnel with the help of an air
slugger (which is compressed air added
to the pipe line near the point of
delivery). This sewer was cast in one
pour having no horizontal joints and
the barrel was formed by using a
patent steel form. The vertical joints
were approximately 32ft. centres. The
concrete pump on this job gave very

good service and was a big saving on
the old methods, giving a much better
concrete job. It is worthy of note that
the pump is capable of pumping low
slump as well as high slump concrete.
Cement gunite plants are little
known in Australia, although they
have been in use for the past 25 years.
This machine has a remarkable range
of uses, being excellent for plaster on
steelwork, such as bunkers and steel
girders, concrete surfaces, waterproof-
ing tanks and reservoirs, concrete pipe
manufacture, repairing concrete piers
and retaining walls, lining tunnels to
prevent falling rock, grouting stone
pitched walls, etc. On account of its
versatility it should be more frequently
seen in contractors’ equipment.
Pressure cement grouting by the use
of a force pump has many uses, such
as the grouting of foundations for
dams, tunnels, grouting under concrete
floors and roads, and a variety of other
jobs. It will lift a sunken concrete
floor or road slab.
Air Compressors.
I cannot stress too much the im-
portance of this unit for it is an essen-
tial and the builder and construction
man cannot afford to be without it.
In addition to its application to drills
and picks it can be used for pumps,
winches, concrete breakers, air ham-
mers, air-locks, riveters, forge heating,
air saws, cleaning out concrete forms
before concreting, paint spraying and
a number of other uses.
Cranes and Lifting Gear.
In this field the progress has quite
outstripped hand me.hods and com-
parisons would be ridiculous.
By the number of portable cranes in
use in Australia it is obvious what an
important part they play in building
and construction. Some of them are
capable of lifting heavy loads up to
as much as 40 tons. There are two
types: the crawler with steel pads as
a truck and the cruiser or truck mount-
ed type on rubber tyres. Being
mobile and having the convenience of
being able to move them from one
position to another at will, thus taking
the place of a number of cranes on a
job, their economic advantage is ob-
vious. We have used one of these
cranes with 125 ft. jib to place loads
as high as 115 ft. from the ground.
For high city buildings the stiff leg
derrick crane is most suitable as it can
be mounted on a gantry or placed on
the steel framework of the building.
A recent feature in some stiff leg
cranes is that the jib has its own motor
and the power is transmitted through
a worm-driven reduction gear. It is
also fitted with a solenoid brake,
making it impossible to drop the jib
except by the breaking of the wire
rope. All new stiff leg cranes manu-
factured for my firm are now fitted
that way.
A type of crane which has not been
received with enthusiasm here is the
guyed mast. It is most popular in
the United States for steel erection for
buildings as it can traverse the full
circle by the shifting of guy ropes.
Bull-wheel Cranes.
The bull wheel type of stiff leg
crane is also very common in America,
where it first made its appearance, but
so far it is not used here very much.
It is most suitable for heavy con-
struction work, and on the Story
Bridge, Brisbane, four of these cranes,
each with a capacity of 50 tons, were
used. They are easily removed from
position to position as the power unit
used is a winch of two or three drums.
For grab bucket work they do a par-
ticularly good job and will stand up
to heavy use. The winches can be
driven by steam, compressed air, inter-
nal combustion or electricity.
Bull-wheel cranes were also used on
the Mackay Outer Harbour Pier for
the handling of 90ft. concrete piles
which weighed 20 tons. Two of these
cranes were mounted on a large travel-
ler. They had command of the 135 ft.
width of pier and as the pier was com-
pleted the traveller moved forward.
These cranes were fitted with two load
lines and a special swivel sheave head
to allow the piles to be taken from the
jinker horizontally then hoisted into a
vertical position and placed in the pile
frame without damage to the piles.
The cranes did a good job and were
most suited for the class of construc-
tion.
The transporting of these long piles
over a mile of rough country was
solved by the construction of a special
rubber-tyred jinker which supported
the piles at four points and at the same
time kept the pile in a perfectly
straight position even though the
wheels travelled into pot-holes and
over mounds, and no piles were
damaged in transit.
Pile-driving Plant
and Practice.
Whilst in Egypt in 1924 I saw piles
being driven by hand methods. A
large gang of men was employed to
pull on a rope to hoist the drop ham-
mer, the work being done to the
rhythm of a chant which they sang.
The common practice here is the
driving of piles by a friction winch
and drop hammer. The most popular
method throughout the world is by
steam or air. Hammers range from
one ton to ten tons, and obviously
the larger sizes require a large volume
of air or steam. Our latest addition
is a 10-tonner which has a ram of
10,000 lb., giving 65 blows per minute
with 100 pound head of steam. This
is a mighty hammer and capable of
driving large-sized concrete steel or
wooden piles.
On the Townsville Power House
job one of these steam hammers drove
up to 50 wooden "iles, 40 to 45 feet
long in a 10-hour day, the average for
the whole job of 2055 piles being 32
per day, including stoppages and
breakdowns.
The plant consisted of two pile
frames, one steam hammer, one
crawler type crane, steam boiler and
one tractor.
In 1938 on the Mackay Outer Har-
hour Pier my Company found that the
90ft. long concrete piles weighing 20
tons (previously mentioned in this
paper) could not be driven into the
hard sea bed by the steam or air ham-
mers then available and so after a
fortnight’s trial the method was aban-
doned. Consequently, we invented and
patented a 15-ton hammer to suit the
job, A hammer of that weight could
not be lifted from the head of a pile
frame as it would soon wreck the
frame, so it was arranged to sit on the
head of the pile in a frame construct-
ed within the hammer. The striking
ram weighed 12 tons and was made
in three sections of four tons each.
Four round guide posts kept the ram
in place and it was lifted with a stiff-
leg derrick crane un.il it became en-
gaged in a tripper hook, the hook
being released by a whip line on the
same crane. By the adjustment of this
hook the height of the drop could be
regulated within a range of 6in. to 6ft.
The first lime we used this hammer
we gave it a 4ft. drop and the pile
penetrated l£in. There were 1001
concrete piles in the job. Driving was
at the rate of eight piles per day, six
days per week. There were no set
hours for a day’s work, but the eight
piles were driven on an average of
nine hours per day. It is worthy of
note that not one pile was damaged
through driving and less than 100 were
chipped at the head.
Interesting cylinder driving opera-
tions are now in progress on a large
power house project in Brisbane
where 4ft. 6in. and 3ft. 6in. diameter
steel cylinders are being driven to a
depth of 125 ft .to sandstone by means
of a special rig and hammer of the
same dimensions as just quoted.
At the 80ft. level there is a stratum
of tough clay into which the cylinders
are embedded, thus sealing off the
water. At this point driving ceases
temporarily and the shafts are ex-
cavated to a depth of approximately
78ft., generally by means of an orange-
peel grab bucket, but where hard
material is encountered air tools and
buckets are employed for the removal
36

of the spoil. When excavation is
completed to this point a further
length of cylinder is welded on and
driving is continued. Driving is at the
rate of approximately fin. to four
blows until the 90ft. level is reached,
where a 16ft. seam of large-sized hard
gravel set with an ironstone and sand
sedementary mixture is encountered
giving only fin. penetration to four
blows. Taking into consideration that
the hammer has a driving force of
1000 tons per blow it can be realised
the exceptional hardness of this mate-
rial.
After the gravel is penetrated, driv-
ing improves, and finally the cylinders
are embedded in sandstone. In nearly
all cases the water is sealed off and
the shafts are continued and belled out
to about 10ft. diameter at the bottom
to distribute the load. All shafts are
bottomed at approximately 130 ft, In
cases where the steel shell does not
successfully cut off the water, air-locks
have to be installed to complete ex-
cavation and the cylinders concreted.
An air pressure of 54 lbs. to the square
inch is required to keep the water out.
Shafts are heavily reinforced with
round rods and a high grade of con-
crete is placed in the cylinders. The
driven steel shells are left in position.
As well as the cylinders, about 5000
wooden piles are also being driven in
the foundations of this job by the use
of a steam hammer. Pile lengths range
from 60 to 90 feet. Piles over 70ft.
are in two lengths joined with a steel
sleeve.
Airlocks, Plant
and Precautions.
An airlock is a piece of equipment
used to displace water by air pressure
in places where work has to be carried
out below water or in ground where
it cannot be de-watered sufficiently to
allow the work to be executed. The
most common use is on bridge foun-
dations.
It is a steel chamber usually sft.
diameter and 9ft. long fitted with
doors at top and bottom, both open-
ing downwards, and is attached to the
cylinders or caissons. The Jock is ar-
ranged to hold the air at a pressure
sufficient to keep the water out of the
workings, pressure required being 1 lb.
of air to every 2ft. 3in. of water depth.
Only one of these doors must be open-
ed at a time, otherwise the pressurised
air will escape.
Men and materials enter the lock
from the top door, which must be
closed after entering and the lock filled
with air taken from the working cham-
ber before the bottom door can be
opened to allow men and material to
go below. When returning, the bot-
tom door must be closed before the
air in the lock is reduced to atmos-
pheric pressure, when the top door
can be opened. In short, to open the
bottom door the air in the lock must
be balanced with the air in the work-
ing chamber, and to open the top
door the air in the lock must be at
atmospheric pressure.
By the introduction of fast operat-
ing pneumatic doors a big improve-
ment has been made to material locks
in latter years, making it possible to
place concrete at the bottom of large
caissons at the rate of 16 cubic yards
per hour.
It is most difficult to fit airlocks on
to small caissons as only one access
shaft can be provided for men and
materials. This type of airlock is in
operation at Gibson Island, Brisbane.
The shafts are 4ft. 6in. and 3ft. 6in.
diameter and 130 ft. deep and require
an air pressure of 54 lbs. to the square
inch. At that pressure men can work
only hours at the race so a shift has
to go in every hours. The time
taken to go in and come out is
hours, so two man locks have to be
provided as well as a material lock.
These three locks had to be joined
together to handle the job. This ar-
rangement is called a combination lock,
but cannot be regarded as fast operas
ing as the three locks have to use the
one shaft and men have to travel from
top to bottom by material bucket and
return the same way.
Airlocks, although simple to operate
when thoroughly understood, should
not be operated by the unskilled as
the lives of men are at stake. To
provide the utmost protection the
Standards Association of Australia has
published a Code known as the
“S.A.A. Compressed Air Code" to
which all airlock work must conform.
All men are not fitted to do airlock
work and careful screening is required,
hence it is necessary for them to urn

Leura has always been one of the most popular places in the Mountairs, and of recent years
development has been very great. We illustrate a few of the attractive cottages that have

dergo a medical examination by a
doctor at regular intervals. Men can
take compression at a fast rate (say,
50 lbs. pressure in 10 minutes), but
to decompress after two hours’ work it
requires 112 minutes. Strict adherence
to the compression and decompression
table provided in the Code is highly
necessary otherwise “bends,” the com-
mon name for caisson sickness, will
appear. This complaint is caused by
the nitrogen not being eliminated
from the bloodsteam during decom-
pression. The only known method of
dealing with the disease is for the
patient to be put into an airlock hos-
pital, usually situated on the job, and
compress the sufferer to a pressure a
little in excess of what he has been
working in, holding the pressure for
about twenty minutes. The pressure
is then reduced according to the table
provided for such hospital cases. In
most instances the patient responds to
the treatment after being admitted co
the hospital lock. However, should
the condition recur, the treatment is
repeated as often as is necessary.
It is worthy of mention here that
during the 25 years my firm has been
using airlocks we have not had a fatal
case. In that period we have worked
in pressure up to 57 lbs. per square
inch. This was on the foundations of
the Story Bridge, Brisbane, where the
caissons were sunk 128 ft. below high
water. The caissons, rectangular in
shape, had six locks installed, four for
men and two for material. We work-
ed teams of 12 men and one foreman
for an hour at the face, taking 11
minutes to go in and 103 minu-es to
come out. Twenty-four shifts a day
and six days a week were worked.
Electricity used in airlocks must be
reduced to 32 volts.
Plant required to work an airlock is
one or two large compressors to sup-
ply air to the lock; compressor for
high pressure air at 100 lbs. per square
inch above lock pressure to supply air
tools as the air in the lock forms a
back pressure; crane or winch for each
material lock; one or two man locks,
according to the working pressure; one
material lock and one hospital lock and
a compressor for it.
Care and Maintenance.
As the wear and tear on construc-
tion machinery is unusually heavy,
serious attention should be given to
its care and maintenance.
In the first place, private enterprise
to be competitive must conserve its
assets, therefore if the full advantage
is taken of depreciation one should
have sufficient in reserve to go a long
way towards purchasing a new
machine, when the time comes it is
not economical to keep the old one.
Fullest consideration should be given
to taking the maximum amount of
allowable depreciation, as it, together
with the cost of repairs, renewals and
maintenance are full deductions from
income tax.
Well-kept machinery is an incentive
to workmen to take a pride in their
jobs and do better work.
For larger items of plant, service
charts should be kept showing all the
points requiring oiling and greasing,
radiator and battery service, and the
number of hours the machine works.
Greasing of wire ropes should also be
recorded on the chart. After servicing,
the chart should be returned to the
office for checking. The keeping of
such a chart is not a big job and when
once the system is working it becomes
a matter of routine and the record is
valuable for reference.
Where grease does not run through
a bearing it should be attended to im-
mediately and not postponed to a more
convenient time for, in many instances,
it is forgotten to the detriment of the
machine.
Most oil companies have a special
department to assist the construction
man to solve his oiling and greasing
problems and are most willing to help.
In conclusion, I would say: I have
given you an indication of the func-
tioning of machines in building and
construction and shown how the
balancing of equipment teams can be
used to effectively improve output and
the economic importance of care and
maintenance of plant in an organisa-
tion. However, there is one element
which is vitally necessary to combine
all of these and that is the will to work.
DEATH OF COL. WELLS.
Former Government Architect.
The death occurred last month of
Col. R. M. S. Wells at the age of 86.
Born at Orange he commenced in
practice in 1881 and subsequently be-
came Government Architect, which
position he occupied when the Board
of Architects of N.S.W. was con-
structed in 1923 and of which he be-
came a member.
He was a foundation member of
the N.S.W. Chapter of the R.A.I.A.
with which he continued to be associ-
ated as a Retired Fellow.
It is not generally known that as
an artist Col. Wells wielded “a pretty
brush” with speed and vigour. On
one occasion when a number of Town
Planners toured the South Coast they
all came back with a fair-sised water
colour of scenes they had visited
painted by him on the spot. Col.
Wells had a great eye for beauty.
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE
FOR YOUNG ARCHITECTS.
British Builders Co-operate.
In the recent Annual Report of the
British National Federation of Building
Trade Employers the President, Mr.
Stenhen Hudson, said that considera-
tion is now being given by the archi-
tects to the desirability of giving pros-
pective architects an opportunity to
obtain first-hand experience on build-
ing sites by spending in the employ-
ment of building contractors some or
all of the year’s practical training
before admission to the Register of
Architects. The Federation Council
has agreed to recommend members to
co-operate fully in any scheme which
may be prepared for enabling archi-
tectural students to obtain such ex-
perience.
PERSONAL.
Mr. N. Bromberger advises that he
has now left Taubmans (N.S.W.)
Pty. Limited and has been appointed
General Manager of Keystone (Aus-
tralia) Pty. Limited as from Ist
April, 1952.
EXPERIMENTAL WINDMILLS.
Britain is to extend research into
the possibility of generating electric
power by means of windmills.
A giant windmill with propellers
60 to 80 ft. in diameter is to be built
at Mynydd Annelog, in Wales.
ONE OF THE KNIGHTS OF
YUGOSLAVIA.
This is one of the Knights of Yugoslavia
and is but one of thousands of tombs and
slabs built in the 13th and 14th centuries
that are found throughout the country, espec-
ially in Serbia and Macedonia. Artists cannot
agree whether the sculptural relief represents
an artistic revolution or a synthesis of sur-
vivals from the ancient days of slavery. Its
almost weird and ugly enough to find pride
of place with the “moderns.”

“Building, Lighting,
Engineering,”
The President reported that, from
February, 1952, the journal “Building
6? Engineering” would be known as
Building, Lighting, Engineering.”
The President expressed his own and
all members’ gra ification of this de'
velopment, and, on the motion of Mr.
G. C. T. Brown, seconded by Mr. T.
H. McCourt, it was unanimously re'
solved that the editors of the Journal
be thanked for the inclusion of the
word “Lighting” in the title of the
Journal, and that they were to be
assured of the support of the Society
for the Journal, which had been the
Official Organ of the I.E.S. since its
inception.
Competition for 1932.
An I.E.S. Award for meritorious
lighting will be held this year for
Installations of Industrial Lighting
situated in New South Wales, and full
details of this Award may be obtained
from Mr. Maclurcan, the Convenor of
the Competitions Committee, but gene'
ralN the installation must have been
made during the last five years, should
be nominated by any member of the
Society, and the closing date is the
31st July, 1952.

Station.”
Visits to Crown Crystal
Glass Co.
The Papers & Meetings Committee
has arranged for visits to the Crown
Crystal Glass Company on May Bth
and May 15th. Since only a limited
number of members and vsiitors can
be accommodated at the one time,
members are requested to inform the
Committee as early as possible if they
wish to attend.
Visit to A.W.A. Television
Exhibition.
Members were invited to visit an
exhibition of television equipment and
other electronic machinery at the
A. office at York Street, Sydney.
The exhibition was to be open during
the Royal Easter Show, and the best
viewing times were from 7 to 9 p.m.
Lecture on Television.
An address by Mr. G. A. Warner,
B. on Television was received with
great interest. It is published on this
page, j
Mr. T. S. Crouch in moving apd
Mr. L. S. Hyatt in seconding a vote
of thanks expressed the feeling of all
members that the lecturer had given
an excellent picture of the general and
technical problems of this subject, and,
in answering the large number of ques'
tions, had clarified many of the special
problems which the new technical de'
velopment had placed before em
gineers in so many fields of design and
research.

Discussion.
Thanks to Illumination Engineers
you can unfortunately see me now.
Sometime in the future television en'
gineers will make it possible for a
lecturer to be seen by an audience
outside this hall—l am grateful to the
Government for making that impos'
sible at this moment.
I think we should first have a look
at television as it exists outside Aus'
tralia. America made an allocation of
frequencies which they thought would
accommodate 400 stations. Three years
ago they had erected 107 stations, but
due to interference which was starting
to set in they put a “freeze” on
which, in effect, limited the number of
stations to those already built. There
is at present a waiting list of over 300
applications to erect television stations.
By opening up a higher frequency
band they hope to accommodate 1000
extra television stations.
Whether the distribution of tele'
vision stations should be on a popula'
tion or geographic basis gives rise to
political arguments.
In 1950, America produced 7 mil'
lion television receivers. The begin'
ning of 1951 looked even better, and
America produced for the first 3
months 2.2 million television sets, but
the beginning of 1951 was no indica'
tion, because they struck a slump due
to reasons which I will mention
shortly.
Most of the television sets in
America are connected by micro'wave
links. This makes it possible to con'
nect the stations in a network and
help to distribute the cost of produc'
tion. Programmes produced in New
York can be seen in San Francisco,
3000 miles away, even though the
effective range of a television station
is not more than about 50 miles.
When television stations are first
erected they do not pay because of the
small number of viewers. You have
possibly heard of the saying “Crime
does not pay—therefore it should be
a Government Department.” Working
on this principle, the English Govern'
men" put television under Government
control, and the 8.8. C. has a complete
monopoly in this field. They do not
have any crowding problems they
have more planning and less pro'
grammes. It must not be felt, how'
ever, that nothing is happening in
England. They have three of the
most powerful television stations in the
world, which cover about 50 per cent,
of the population of England, even if

there are only five hours’ program'
ming per day.
It is the policy of the 8.8. C. that
there shall be only one programme
until such time as the whole of Eng'
land can receive that programme.
They are producing in England ap'
proximately 1 million receivers per
year. I have no figures for other
countries, but there is television in
France, Canada, Belgium, Holland,
Italy, Spain and, I believe, Germany
and Japan. There is as yet no inter'
national television, and it is not likely
for many years to come for political
and economic reasons.
Television in Australia.
Shortly after the war engineers were
sent from Australia to study the latest
developments in television. Both Mr.
Chifley and Mr. Menzies have called
tenders for television stations. None
of the quotes submitted have been
accepted, and just recently it was an'
nounced that television has been post'
poned indefinitely.
The possible reasons for this de'
cision are: Firstly, economic; we do
have credit restrictions and import re-
strictions, and if television is to be
regarded as a luxury then possibly we
can do without it. If we are pre'
nared to place our standard of living
below that of Germany and Japan,
the defeated nations, in order to ob'
tain our economic objectives, then no
doubt this is a good reason. We can
draw some consolation from the fact
that the natives in Africa do not have
television.
Secondly, it can be argued that
effort put into television would detract
from our war effort. I hope to prove
how wrong this second reason is later
on in my address.
So far as business is concerned,
television is far more seasonal than
radio. People watch television more
during the Winter. This may not be so
in Australia, where we do not get such
severe Winters as they get in England
and Northern United States.
The advertisers realise that more
people view during the Winter and
therefore put on their best pro'
grammes during this season, which
further tends to accentuate the fact
that people do most of their viewing
during the Winter months.
As a matter of interest, people liv'
ing in “fringe” areas a long way from
a television station sometimes get bet'
ter television during the Winter in
the Northern Hemisphere because the
leaves drop off the trees surrounding
the receiving aerials, which sometimes
enables them to receive a better
picture.
Television is big business in the
United States—they call it a “2£ bib
lion dollar business.” Television in
the United States has been a rapidly
expanding business. In the first three
months of 1951 R.C.A’s gross income
rose 46 per cent. —Philco’s gross in'
come rose 30 per cent. —and other
companies rose accordingly.
As I have stated before, around
May, 1951, there was a slump in the
television business. The reasons for
this slump were as follows:
The market was approaching satu'
ration because of the television freeze,
and therefore the first seasonal slump
was felt. Credit regulations were in'
troduced which brought into force a
minimum down payment. There was
a 10 per cent, excise tax, correspond'
ing to our sales tax, introduced, which
the Americans felt was dreadful. The
price of television sets was rising.
There was fear among the public that
colour television would be introduced
and obsolete their sets. The manufac'
turers had urged the retailers to in'
crease their stocks against a possible
shortage caused by the Korean war.
This shortage never came, but these
stocks accentuated the slump when the
business recession arrived.
So far as the economics of television
are concerned, a television station,
both initially and to run, costs 4or
5 times more than a radio station,
which accounts for the fact that tele'
vision stations initially lose money, but
once the big advertisers realise what a
good sales medium television is they
gradually become a paying proposition.
It has been estimated that it will
need 1000 television stations to cover
the whole of the United States. It
has also been worked out that for the
same cost 33 stations could cover the
whole of the Uni.ed States if they
were carried aloft in aircraft flying at
25,000 feet, that is, the saving in the
number of stations would make it
economical for the petrol and main'
tenance of the aircraft involved. This
pronosition has, however, not been
given very serious consideration, ab
though some initial tests of strato
vision were made.
Before discussing the programmes
we are likely to see when television
comes, I would like to show you five
slides indicating the quality of picture
we are likely to receive. Those seat'
ed near the front of the hall may be
just close enough to distinguish the
line structure caused by the scanning
process.
The television broadcast session may
consist, for instance, of the announcer
having his breakfast, in which case he
can do a little subtle advertising by
merely placing the packet from which
he is eating in full view of the
audience, without necessity to make
any reference to it. Later on in the
session there will be possibly lessons
in dressmaking, cooking; again with
the same sort of advertising. The
afternoon sessions usually cover any
sporting activity which is going on,
tele-news reels, and later on in the
afternoon the children’s programmes.
Appeal to Children.
The art of puppetry, which had
nearly died out before the advent of
television because of the small num-
ber of people who could view the pup'
pets, has been revived by television,
and puppets are extensively used in the
children’s programmes. You have
possiblv seen in the news that the
favourite puppet of the 8.8. C. “Mub
fin the Mule” is at present in Australia.
In America, the counterpart of “Mub
fin the Mule,” “Howdedode,” nearly
drives the children crazy. Where I
lived in America it was not uncommon
for children to knock on the door and
ask if they could come in and view
“Howdedode.”
In the evening, when the viewing
audience is at a maximum, the best
programmes of the day are put on,
i.e., the pictures which cost the most
money to produce, which consist of
plays, vaudeville, light variety shows,
and in order to give some idea of the
LONDON TUNNEL LIGHTING.
New Fluorescent Installation.
The Blackwall Tunnel, London, constructed
in 1817, has recently had a completely new
lighting installation. The new units situated
at the side instead of at the crown as former-
ly, consist of an 80 watt fluorescent tube with
a set of louvrfes and control apparatus. They
are set 8’ 6” above the pavement and 30ft.
apart, though close together at the entrance
to achieve the gradual transition from the
natural light so as to allow the eyes of
drivers to adjust themselves. The installation
was designed by the London County Council’s
'Engineers’ Department.

complexity of putting on these broad-
casts I will show you some more slides
showing the number of people in-
volved.
It should be remembered that most
television programmes of this nature
are rehearsed, and therefore all these
people have to be employed for more
than twice the time it takes to present
the programme over the air. The
programme director, the lighting en-
gineer, sound engineer, cameramen,
stage director, and artists, have to
work as a team if the programme is to
be a success. Such incidents as the
man moving the microphone beam
blundering across the stage must not
occur.
So far as the lighting is concerned,
fluorescent lamps make excellent flood
lighting as they do not tend to cast
the shadow of the microphone boom.
Incandescent lamps make good spot
lights because of their ease of control
of focus and intensity. Mercury
lamps or incandescent lamps are
as footlights or back lighting, some-'
times called “halo” lights.
It is possible to perform tricks with
television cameras. The programme
director, who normally sits with two
or three pictures in front of him from
two or three different cameras, and
selects which picture is to be trans-
mitted to the public, can, by working
the different switches, superimpose
two pictures on top of one another.
This can be used as a “ghostly effect,
as ghosts can effectively walk through
walls or into other people’s bodies, or
it can be used as a comedy trick be-
cause by taking one man at a long
distance so that he looks small and one
man as a close up so that he appears
large it is possible by superimposing
one picture on top of another to make
it appear as if the small man is sitting
in the large man’s lap, and they can
of course carry on a conversation with
one another.
Comedians can pretend to clean the
inside of your viewing screen, and
they can clean off from the screen the
caption which in', reduces the pro-
gramme.
I said earlier that it was a false move
to delay television because of our de-
fence effort. The introduction of tele-
vision would create productive capa-
ci:y without Government expenditure,
which could, in time of war, be quick-
ly switched to defence projects. We
do not in Australia, at the present
moment, have the productive capacity
in the electronic field necessary to
effective production should war start.
It would train technicians in tech-
niques which are used in defence
equipment, especially in radar. Whilst
entertainment television has no direct
use in war, television does have several
direct uses.
When the submarine “Affray” sank
in the English Channel, it was found
by means of lowering a television
camera, with a headlight attached, over
the side of a ship whilst the ship
patrolled up and down the Channel.
The camera was at a depth greater
than that to which a diver can descend,
and it was possible to read the names
of most of the ships which had been
sunk in the area.
Industrial T.V. Units.
Industrial television units, which
cost about £I,OOO, have many uses in
industry associated with the war effort.
Atomic piles and the products of the
piles are extremely dangerous to
human beings, and these operations
can only be watched by means of mir-
rors, telescopes, or television. Work
■ on explosives or processes which give
off poisonous gases or intense heat can
also be conveniently watched by tele-
vision. In fact, any processes which
have to be viewed at a distance is
most conveniently done by television.
It is possible by placing television
cameras on tops of hills along a coast-
line for a person at H.Q. to look
through any camera in turn and thus
watch those stretches of coastline with
the minimum of man-power. This
consideration should be given serious
thought in a country which has such a
large coastline as we have.
Guided missiles and bombs were de-
veloped during the closing stages of
the last war with television camera
tubes in the head, which transmitted a
picture of the target back to base or,
in the case of a bomb, back to the air-
craft which dropped it. It was found
possible to stear the bomb by means
of radio right on to the target. The
missiles were extremely expensive, but
in certain instances the results obtain-
ed were well worth the trouble.
T.V. and The Battle of Britain.
It is doubtful if England would have
won the “Battle of Britain” if the
8.8. C. had not introduced television
in 1936, as the techniques were then
available for radar, which was possibly
responsible for the outcome of the
battle.
Television camera tubes can be made
sensitive to ultra-violet or infra-red
radiations which are normally invisible
to the human eye.
Infra-red sensitive tubes were de-
veloped in a very much simplified
form of equipment which it was pos-
sible for man to carry, and were known
as “snooperscopes.” These were used
by the American forces by night, both
in vehicles and for snipers, who had
very much improved night vision as a
result of this development.
Television has medical uses so far
as the training of students is concern-
ed. A television camera attached to a
microscope makes a single slide of
some special specimen available to a
whole class of students as they watch
the microbes or other materials on
television screens. It is impossible for
medical students to get a good view
of operations, but with a television
camera suspended above the operating
table many students can get a good
close-up view.
Colour Television.
Colour television is ideally suited
for this type of work, and in England
a Pye colour television unit has been
extensively used in the instruction of
medical students.
We now come to the more tech'
nical aspects of the subject. When
you pick up the newspaper in the
morning and see a picture taken over'
seas, possibly the day before, you
probably give little thought as to how
it got into your newspaper. It came
by radio, and the techniques used
were the forerunner of television. It
is possible to transmit a picture by
telephone. In order to do this, you
could place a piece of transparent
numbered squared paper over the pic'
ture and if the person at the other
end had a similar piece of squared
paper you could tell him how dark to
fill in each square. Confucius is once
said to have remarked that “one pic'
ture is worth a thousand words.” On
this basis he would probably be right.
It is obviously necessary to have a
mechanical means of transmitting the
information contained in each square,
and a mechanical means for recording
the information received at the re'
ceiving end. This is, in effect, how
the picture came to your morning
newspaper. It is obvious that the more
squares the better the quality of the
picture. In a single television picture
there are a quarter of a million picture
elements.
In order to transmit a moving pic'
ture it is necessary to have 25 to 30
still pictures per square, i.e., five mil'
lion squares per second. Because of
the impossibility of developing any
mechanical means which will work fast
enough, at present television is all elec'
tronic.
Television Receiving Tube.
I have here on the desk in front of
me a television receiving tube. It
consists of a fluorescent screen which
will light up under the action of an
electron beam fired from the gun end.
The beam scans the tube in lines
starting at the left-hand top corner
and continuing down in a similar man-
ner to the way we wri e on a piece of
paper. It ends up at the bottom
right-hand corner. The beam is inter-
rupted according to the picture infor-
malion received and the dark patches
appear which constitute the picture.
You will notice that the phosphor is
white, and because there can be no
means of making the phosphor any
blacker, there is only means of making
(continued overleaf)

the phosphor light up and not get
dark; this does, to some extent, limit
the contrast ratio which is, in a tele-
vision set, around 20 to 1.
When television first started the
camera pick-up tubes in the studio
were very insensitive, as in the early
days photographic film was insensitive,
and would only work in bright sun-
light. Due to developments which
have taken place over the years, it is
now possible to transmit a picture with
the light of a single candle. Whilst it
is possible to do this, the quality of the
picture is not very good, and it is
generally regarded that a light level of
10 to 20 feet candles is the minimum
required for a high-quality picture.
Because of the heat produced in main-
taining high light levels in a studio,
it is desirable to have a good air-
conditioning system for the comfort
of the actors.
You will probably notice on the re-
ceiving tube in front of me the re-
flection of several lamps in this room.
The fact of the tube is a spherical
shape, and no matter where people
are seated if there is an intense light
source in front of a television receiver
a reflection will be shown in the pic-
ture tube face. This is extremely an-
noying to the viewer.
Viewing by Dark.
It is desirable both from the point
of view of eye-strain and from the
point of view of the rest of (he family
who do not wish to watch television
that the viewing should not be done
in the dark. The lighting should
therefore preferably be indirect if it is
in front of the television set, or stan'
dard lamps or other lights should be
used if they are behind the television
set. There are other means of over'
coming reflections from lights and
Venetian blinds. One of the best ways
of doing this is to place a flat dark
piece of glass in front of the television
tube. Light which has to be reflected
from the face of the picture tube then
has to go through the dark screen
twice, once on the way in and once
on the way out, whereas the light
which originates on the face of the
tube only has to come through the
dark screen once.
The dark screen can be angled
slightly towards the floor so that any
reflections which take place from the
dark screen itself are directed at the
floor and are not visible.
The pictures appearing on a tele'
vision screen are, in general, much
brighter than those commonly used in
picture theatres, and can therefore be
viewed with much higher ambient
lighting. The limitation on the screen
brightness of a television set is the
flicker rate, or number of pictures per
second. You can turn up the brightness
of a television screen until such time as
you can see flicker, and it is not pos'
sible to turn it up any further without
eye-strain.
The Americans can have a picture
six times brighter than the English
television can produce, because in
America they use 30 pictures per
second and in England 25.
The number of hours of sunlight
per day is, on an average, smaller in
England than in America, and also the
intensity of sunlight in England is on
an average less than the intensity of
sunlight in America, so that this
limitation is not severaly felt.
The choice of the number of pic-
tures per second is of course connected
with the power line frequency. In
Australia, where the 25 pictures per
second standard has been set, it may
be necessary on very bright days in
homes which have very large windows
to dim the room somewhat for com'
fortable television viewing.
Films and Television.
Films are to television what records
are to radio. If it is necessary to re'
cord a television programme, or to put
on a television programme without
having the cast present, it is necessary
to put the programme on film, and
Hollywood in America produces a lot
of films especially for television. The
contrast ratio and gamma of these
films is preferably made to suit tele'
vision work.
The picture industry is the industry
most effected by the introduction of
television, but people still go out to
eat and people will still go to the
pictures if the picture is a good one.
Finally, I think we might trace the
signal from the studio to the home.
When the signal leaves the camera
it can either go directly to the trans'
mitter, or if the transmitter happens
to be at a distant point, which would
be the case if the camera were at a
sportsground or if the studio was
situated in the heart of a city and the
transmitter was situated on the top of
a hill, then it is necessary to pipe the
signal by means of cable or rnicro'wave
link. A microwave link consists of a
small repeater station every 30 miles
which takes up the signal from the
preceding station and transmits to the
next repeater station. Micro'wave
links extend right across America from
New York to San Francisco, and from
London to Scotland.
When not in use for transmitting a
television signal, these micro ' wave
links can be put to use by the tele'
phone authorities because each link
can carry 30 telephone conversations
at the one time.
When the signal arrives at the tele'
vision station, it is transmitted from
the aerial and the waves travel in
straight lines. It is the fact that tele'
vision waves travel in straight lines
which limits the range to approximate'
ly 50 miles, because the curvature of
the earth prohibits them from going
any further.
The aerial (receiving) is preferably
high and is normally affixed -to the
chimney and a special lead'in wire car'

is well portrayed in these two
diverse examples of a towering

aper pattern in the brickwork

ties the signal down to the receiver.
Television is definitely in the world
to stay. No Government can stand in
the way too long.
We will find sooner or later that
our lives, society, sport, culture, and
every facet of our civilisation will be
revolutionised by this thing called
television.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. McCourt: What is the basic
difference between television standards
in Britain and the United States?
Mr. Warner: The main difference
between the television standards of the
different countries is the number of
lines per picture, in the number of
pictures per second, and in the fre'
quencies used for transmitting the sig'
nal. In Britain the picture is trans'
mitted with 405 lines- —in the United
States with 525 lines: in France the
figure is as hiph as 819. British prac'
tice is to use 25 pictures per second,
whilst in the United States 30 pictures
per second.
Increasing the number of lines in'
creases the vertical definition of the
picture, but if the band width is not
increased, increasing the number of
lines decreases the horizontal resolution
of the picture. It also affects the sig'
nal to noise ratio if the band width is
altered —the wider the band width, the
greater the susceptibility to noise. In
fringe areas it is often necessary to
decrease the band width and de'
teriorate the picture for the sake of
keeping out noise. In this way the
number of lines can affect the ultimate
range of a weak transmitter.
With the limitations placed on us
by present'day equipment and econo'
mic considerations, it is my opinion
that the television picture in the
average home is slightly better in
England than in America, despite the
fact that the American standards are
capable of transmitting a better pic'
ture.
Mr. Pashley: In the Audio channel,
is A.M. (audio modulation) or F.M.
(frequency modulation) used?
Mr. Warner: In Great Britain A.M.
is used quite successfully. In the
United States F.M. is used. This en'
ables television receivers to be made
with inter'earrier sound, which means
that the sound signal is made to beat
with the picture signal, which gives a
very constant I.F. frequency. This is,
in my opinion, one of the few applica'
tions in which F.M. justifies itself.
Mr. Wilcox: Is it true that F.M.
would make it easier to synchronise
the sound of the picture?
Mr. Warner: It makes no difference
what type of modulation is used—
there is a separate channel for sound
and vision.
Mr. McCauley: I was confused by
the two statements —one, that television
could be used with a central viewing
screen for military coast watching, and
two, that T.V. stations have a range
of only 50 miles.
Mr. Warner: There are three ways
of transmitting television signal from
one place to another. One is by
means of coaxial cables; another by
means of micro'wave links, and the
third method is a high'powered trans'
mitter normally used for broadcast
stations. A television transmitting
station has a range of approximately
50 miles. Coaxial cables and micro'
wave links, which consist of repeater
stations every 30 miles, do not have
this limitation of range, and it is micro'
wave link or cable which would be
used in this military application.
Mr. Phillips said he was one who
hoped that T.V. would not come. In
the United States television had revo'
lutionised social life. Is Mr. Warner
in accord?
Mr. Warner: There are no doubt
many things that could be said about
the detrimental effects of this new
medium it would be a surprising
thing if this were not so. It is pos'
sible that the speaker is thinking main'
ly of the effects of television upon
children. It is my opinion that in
many instances the education which
children derive from a television is
greater than the education that they
receive from their parents. It is much
more easily remembered than that
which we hear. Television does cause
people to read less; go to the pictures
less, but as soon as the novelty has
worn off people do not sit glued to
the television set for hours on end,
but do partake of the normal recrea'
tional activities.
Special educational programmes are
shown and programmes such as opera,
orchestral concerts are televised and
are seen by people who would not
normally go to what many people re'
fer to as “high'brow” entertainment.
T.V. has brought with it a tremeiv
dous amount of good.
Mr. McCourt remembered that many
years ago his own parents decided not
to buy a radio because they feared
the moral effect on the children.
However, we seem little worse off for
radio.
Mr. Pashley: What standards for
T.V. had been adopted in Australia?
Mr. Warner: 625 lines is to be the
standard. F.M. is proposed by the
P.M.G. for the audio channel.
Mr, Jeffery: How do the U.S.A.
and U.K. programmes compare?
Mr. Warner: There are only three
hours of high'quality programming
from the 8.8. C. per day. It is my
belief that these three hours have bet'
ter entertainment value than any three
hours from any one American tele'
vision station, but I do not think that
the higher quality of this single British
programme makes up for the fact that
in the large cities the Americans have
seven programmes to choose from,
that is, people are more likely to strike
the type of programme they want in
a selection from the seven available
than they are from the single one
available in England.
In the United States more sporting
programmes are shown than in Eng'
land, possibly due no doubt to the
fact that the stations have more money
to spend in paying for the privilege of
televising.
One disadvantage of having too
many interesting programmes is that
one’s sox do not get darned, as you
cannot give your full attention ,o any'
thing else whilst watching television.
Mr. Zinnader: What are the upkeep
costs of a television set compared with
radio?
Mr. Warner: A television set costs
five or six times as much as a radio
set in the initial purchase, and it will
wear out in the same time. One'third
of the initial cost of a television set is
in the picture tube, and whilst the life
specified by the manufacturer is 1,000
hours, they do work out to four or
five thousand hours, which means that
two or three tubes will be needed dur'
ing the life of the set, taken as, say,
ten years. A television picture tube
in England costs jEI per inch, i.e., a
12in. tube .£l2. Taken over the long
period television is not expensive en'
tertainment.
Mr. Austin: Is there any unification
in television of a colour system, and
can an adaptor be added to a normal
set for colour viewing?
Mr. Warner: There is no unification
of a colour system. Many systems
exist, the best'known being the
mechanical fiber wheel and the simub
taneous system.
It does seem probable that the
second system mentioned will be
adopted.
With the first system, that is, the
mechanical filter wheel, it is possible
to add the colour wheel to an existing
black and white receiver and receive
pictures in colour if some minor modi'
fications are done to the set itself.
People with unmodified black and
white sets would, however, not be able
to see this type of transmission at all.
Wi h the second simultaneous sys-
tern, it is not practicable to convert a
black and white receiver to receive
colour television, but the black and
white receiver will continue to receive
black and white pictures from the
colour signal, i.e., the system is com'
patible. It is necessary to buy a colour
television receiver to receive colour.
The mechanical system, in my
opinion, is very much inferior.
Mr. Phillips: How does the colour

picture appear on the screen—are dif-
ferent phosphors used?
Mr. Warner: Different phosphors are
used with the simultaneous dot sequen-
tial system. The different coloured
phosphors are applied as dots to the
screen of the C.R.T. by a photo-
engraving process. When the colour
wheel is used in the frame sequential
system, a white phosphor is used and
different coloured discs are sequentially
placed in front of the tube.
Mr. Deigan: Will we have to pay a
fee for the use of a T.V. set the same
as for a radio receiver?
Mr. Warner: In the U.S. there is
no fee as in radio, the cost being
borne by the sponsors of programmes.
United Kingdom charge is £1 for
radio licence and £2 for T.V. licence.
In Australia, legislation passed by the
Chifley Government is still on the
Statute Book. This legislation, if it
remains in force, will make television
a Government monopoly. Whether
television is Government or commer-
cially run in Australia there will prob-
ably be a licence fee similar to radio.
Mr. Cork: How can we overcome
H.T. interference? Has the choice of
25 frames any relation to the supply
frequency of 50c/s? Is it to avoid
stroboscopic effect?
Mr. Warner: Television sets are
subject to interference motor cars
being the worst offenders. It is very
difficult to effect a cure at the set, but
legislation is in eixstence to enable the
P.M.G. Department to make people
suppress electrical noise arising from
machinery. Legislation is being
brought in in England to make it com-
pulsory to affix suppressors to cars.
One manufacturing group is already
doing this.
In answer to the second part of the
question, 25 frames per second was
chosen because of our 50 c/s power
supply. If the picture is synchronised
to the mains frequency any distortion
in the picture will not “crawl” through
the picture. Distortion is not nearly
as annoying if it appears still. Dis-
tortion is very annoying if it does
crawl through the picture.
Stroboscopic effect can only take
place at the transmitter. There is no
stroboscopic effect noticeable between
the picture and home lighting. Strobo-
scopic effect on fluorescent lighting at
the transmitter can be eliminated by
connecting the fluorescent lamps to
the three different phases of a three-
phase supply. This minimises any
flicker which may be present.
Mr. Gribble: What is the power
consumption of a television set in com-
parison to a radio set?
Mr. Warner: They consume power
in proportion to the number of valves,
i.e., about four or five times the
amount of power consumed by a nor-
mal radio receiver.
Death of H. E. White
WELL-KNOWN THEATRE ARCHITECT.
The death occurred last month of
Henry E. White at the age of 75.
H. E. White twenty years ago had
one of the largest practices in Aus-
traha and specialised in the design of
picture theatres, being responsible for
about 120 of them, a large number
of which were in the capital cities of
Australia and New Zealand.
The St. James Theatre, of greatly
restrained detail, was built for the late
Sir Benjamin Fuller and John Fuller
at a cost of £750,000. This was
originally designed as two theatres, one
above the other a daring project.
Only one theatre was proceeded with
and the balance of the building was
turned into offices known as the St.
James Building.
The State Theatre, of more profuse
though exquisite detail and much en-
richment, was also one of Henry
White’s large projects. It embraces a
huge shopping centre. He also recon-
structed the Theatre Royal and the
Mayfair.
The period in which he built many
of these theatres was the lush pros-
perous late ’twenties, when the word
depression” was only associated with
meteorological reports, and each film
company vied with each other in the
size and extravagance of their erec-
tions. It was this era and outlook that
produced the State and Capitol
Theatres with their “atmospheric” in-
teriors with blue skies, twinkling stars,
Roman temples, doves, gilded females,
sculptured busts of Roman emperors,
Greek philosophers, Shakespeare.
H. E. White was a shrewd business-
man, had an excellent engineering
mind, and at one stage had probably
the biggest staff in Sydney. It was
nothing unusual to put two football
teams or two cricket teams of drafts-
men in the field at the same time to

THE STATE THEATRE, SYDNEY.
THE GRAND ASSEMBLY.
Described in the elaborate brochure that was produced in connection with the official opening
of the State Theatre, Sydney, on June 7, 1929, by the Acting Premier, Hon. E. A. Buttenshaw,
M.L.A., in the extravagant language of the period as “the magnificent and splendid jewel-piece
set in the mighty coronet of the State”. The brochure also describes the State Shopping
Block as “nearing its Gothic grandeur, a veritable symphony of steel and stone.” The State
Beauty Ballet were also described in fruitful language as “Australian Peaches plucked from an
Enchanted Orchard.” Certainly a Gala Night in the Fabulous Twenties!

PAY-ROLL TAX
A Capital Charge On Building.
By JOHE O'KEEFFE,
Executive Director of Building
Industry Congress of Victoria.
Pay-roll tax was designed to pro-
vide the main part of the money re-
quired for child-endowment. It has
become a capital load on building.
In 1929, it was generally agreed
that any scheme which would increase
the charges upon industry would be
unwise at that time. Since 1942 —
the year of the first return under the
new scheme —pay-roll tax has increas-
ed from £9 million to <£4o million
(est. for the current year) or 346
per cent.
There are sounder grounds now for
the removal of this form of tax, be-
cause it is a charge upon industry and
passed on as cost in building. We
realise the Government will not forego
the revenue derived from pay-roll tax,
but it should be spread over the com-
munity more equitably.
Since it is a deductible item of ex-
pense for income tax purposes, its
removal would not represent a loss
of revenue to the Government equal
to the present total amount collected.
Increased taxable company income
would compensate for some of the
loss, whilst the difference should be a
tax on personal exertion.
A conservative estimate of the
amount which pay-roll tax adds to
constructional costs throughout Aus-
tralia is £4 million. If we take into
consideration the amount collected by
this tax from manufacturers of build'
ing materials and accessories, the
building industry would account for
half of the total payments, because
it takes approximately four men on
the production side to keep a man
employed on-site.
MODERN HOUSING.
All over the world to-day the problem of housing the people
is being met in various ways and in England and most Con-
tinental countries this takes the form of large blocks of apart-
ment buildings of which we illustrate an example. Ample
open space is provided between the blocks. Below is a
Swiss Church in the modern manner.

“Modern
Architecture”
In Japan
The rise and development of “mod'
ern architecture” in Japan began at
the beginning of the Taisho Era —
1912-1926.
It was, largely brought about by
the introduction of new building ma-
terials and construction technique,
with which vpun.g Japanese architects
were much influenced by the impact
of modern architecture in Austria and
Germany.
From about 1920, buildings of mod-
ern style first began to be built in
Japan by these young architects. As
at that time, chiefly in Germany and
Austria, expressimist architecture was
vigorous, the* influence of continental
architects was distinctly disceriied in
the work of modern Japanese archi-
tects.
At about this same period, another
style was introduced by American ar-
chitect, Frank Lloyd Wright, who
built many buildings in Japan as well
as the Imperial Hotel, Tokio, an
earthquake resisting building which
was so strong that it also resisted
the impact of the atom bomb which
reduced many surrounding buildings
to a shambles. Afterwards this pe'
culiar style of Wright more or less
affected some of the young Japanese
architects, and even today quite a
number of buildings showing his in'
fluence can be seen in Tokio and
other parts.
The great earthquake of ,1923 in
Tokio and Yokohama enforced many
serious problems on Japanese archi'
tecture, and the problem of earth'
quake'proof construction became a
serious subject of study.
From about 1925, the new archi'
tectural movement, which is usually
called “International Style,” began tc
revolutionise the ideas of the Japajv
ese architects.
In post'war Japan, the housing
problem is one of the biggest nation'
al headaches, and architects are en-
deavouring to bring about an entire'
ly new type of Japanese constructional
technique, with comfort, sanitation,
brightness and simplicity as the key-
points.
In the typically “joo-ryu” or hour'
geis Japanese homes the major stress
is laid on simplicity, but it also in'
eludes the clever use of various species
of wood, which has always been the
chief material for Japanese architec'
ture; the unique features of the roofs,
the large projection of the eaves; the
deceptively simple ceilings, windows
and sliding doors, and the large decor'
ative and practical value of bamboo.

High Cost of Building
Denounced By British Builders' President
“WILL PRICE THEMSELVES OUT OF MARKET”
A warning to builders that unless
they increased output and kept costs
down they would price themselves out
of the market was given by Mr.
Stephen Hudson, retiring President of
the National Federation of Building
Trade Employers in Great Britain,
when in February he introduced the
annual report of the Council.
“That our product is already too
■expensive for many building owners
is clear from the increasing number
who are carrying out building work
themselves,” he said. “The writing is
on the wall: we shall ignore it at our
peril.”
Dealing with the current economic
situation, the report states: In such a
delicately poised political and econo-
mic situation, it was scarcely surpns-
ing that the new Government decided
that urgent steps must be taken to
make the country solvent; or that it
was unable immediately to take the
risks involved in meeting the views
of those who claim that industrial en-
terprise will never flourish until con-
fidence is restored by the abolition of
all government restrictions on indus-
try. While such a move may be im-
practical in present conditions, there
is on the other hand a danger that
the continuance of the system of con'
trols, which has now been in force
over 12 years, will come to be regard'
ed as part of the inevitable order of
things, and that the coming generation
of industrial leaders may have difficulty
in adjusting themselves to a free
economy. The new Government has
already given proof of its intention to
reduce, in some measure, the burden
of control by removing or modifying
some of the existing regulations, for
example, in the fields of housing and
timber purchasing. The moves so far
made in this direction, however, are
unlikely in themselves to have any
immediate major effect.
Building Activity.
The report quotes figures issued by
the Ministry of Works to show that
building output in 1950 averaged £llO
million a month, and increased, in the
first nine months of 1951, to an
average of almost £l2O million a
month. “These figures,” the report
comments, “suggest that, even allow'
ing for the increase in building costs,
the industry has carried out as much
work in 1951 as in 1950”. This
assumption is supported by the fact
. that deliveries to the home market of
practically all the chief building mate'
rials have been at a higher rate in
1951 than in 1950.
Material Shortages.
The inadequacy of the supply of
materials remains the crux of the
building programme. The efforts of
building contractors to achieve greater
efficiency and lower costs, the com'
pletion of jobs on time, the more
widespread introduction of payment'
by'results schemes, the training of ap-
prentices and the general attitude of
the building operative to his job, all
depend to a large extent on materials
arriving on the sites at the right time,
in the right quantities and in the right
sizes. At no time since the war have
materials been so plentiful as to permit
industry to approach its task with con'
fidence.
Steel. -The introduction of the new
allocation scheme will not, of course,
result in more steel for building.
Nevertheless, the scheme will do all
that can be expected of it, if it results
in such steel as is available being
directed to the most urgent and im-
portant jobs.

French architects were designing
and building a series of fine school
buildings throughout the country.
We illustrate a few examples.

Bricks. The brick industry can
claim a record of steady post-war ex'
pansion, even if the average monthly
output of 650 million in 1958 has not
yet been reached.
Cement. —-The acute general short'
age of cement which builders ex'
perienced in 1950 has not been re'
peated, although temporary dilliculties
have been experienced in certain areas
which rely for their supplies on
coastal shipping. In general, however,
such difficulties as have occurred have
arisen from the shortage of bags;
cement was available for delivery in
bulk, but builders have difficulty in
storing it in this condition. In view
of this situation, great interest has
been displayed in a method, based on
: Swedish practice, which has been de'
veloped by a member of the Yorkshire
Federation for handling cement in
bulk. If the shortage of cement bags
can be met in this way, there is good
reason to believe that supplies to build'
ing sites in 1952 will be at least as
good as they were in 1951.
Timber. —In 1951 the timber trade
had partial freedom to the extent that
the purchase of timber from the Baltic
and certain soft currency areas has
been in private hands. The results
have been encouraging and have fully
justified the confidence reposed in
private as compared with public trad'
ing.
Building Costs.
A disturbing feature of 1951 has
been the substantial increase in costs.
Following the trend of raw material
prices generally, building material
prices rose steepily, particularly in the
early part of the year, and by Septenv
ber the general level of prices was
about 20 per cent, above that pre'
vailing at the end of 1950. The cost
of building labour has also risen. It
is probable that, taking into account
the degree to which increases in
material costs and wage rates were off'
set by higher output, building costs
rose by some 15 per cent, in the first
10 months of 1951. Related to the
total output of the building and civil
engineering industries, this is the
equivalent to an addition of almost
£2OO million a year, sufficient to pay
for about 130,000 new three'bedroom
houses.
There seems little prospect, more'
over, that this upward trend will be
arrested in the near future. The
various schemes for the collaboration
of individuals in building their own
homes which have recently been pub'
licised and the increasing tendency of
householders to carry out all their
own decoration and much of their
maintenance work are indications that
the cost of building has now reached
a level which the average private con-
sumer is becoming unwilling or un-
able to pay. The effect of this con-
sumer-resistance on the activity of the
industry is to a large extent concealed
by the large amount of work being
carried out by public bodies.
These unfavourable trends under-
line the importance of further efforts
to promote efficiency and economy in
the execution of building works of ail
types. Both independently and in col-
laboration with the other national or-
ganisations in the industry, the Fede-
ration has continued during the year
to press forward with the implementa-
tion of those recommendations of the
Working Party and the American
Productivity Team, which are the
direct responsibility of building trades
employers. But it must be emphasised
that the function of the Federation,
and indeed of the Government also,
is primarily to provide the framework
within which the industry can operate
flexibly and efficiently; to the extent
that external factors permit, the final
responsibility foar better and cheaper
building depends upon the determina-
tion of the individual architect, con-
tractor, sub-contractor and operative
on the job to secure good results and,
above all, upon the effectiveness of the
collaboration between them.

£50,000 Catholic
College Extensions
Opened at Lismore.
The new storey at St. John’s Col-
lege, Woodlawns, Lismore, was opened
recently by the R.C. Bishop of Lis-
more.
Cost of the extensions to the col-
lege exceeds £50,000. They consist
of a fourth storey to the original flat-
topped building erected in 1930.
Architect in charge of the exten-
sions was Mr. Frank Cullen, of Bris-
bane. The contract was carried out
by Mr. J. Starkey, Lismore, with Mr.
Frank Bennett as chief sub-contractor.
Work on the new storey began just
before Christmas, 1950,
The floor has an area of 19,000
sq. ft. It comprises five spacious
dormitories, four priests’ rooms, three
stair wells and a balcony running
the length of the building.
A large attic space was provided
for storage, and extra classrooms were
formed from existing dormitories.
A new sick bay has been built and
the dining room floor area has been
doubled, the chapel and science block
enlarged, while a new theatre and
gymnasium have yet to be completed
Kitchen and servery and hot and
cold water systems have been mod'
ernised, and the entire electric sys-
tem has been brought up to date.
Features of Work.
The college is now one of the
major buildings between Newcastle
and Brisbane.
In the additions to the college,
rodded steel was used for the first
time on the North Coast.
The 36 tons of steel are supporting
60 tons of timber and 26,000 tiles.
The red and blue tinted tiles of
the roof and the cream plaster of
the new storey have enhanced the
appearance of the existing structure.
Further distinction is gained by the
four great terra-cotta crosses on the
gables, and the elaborate centre-front,
which is ornamented by an enormous
coloured metal badge of the school.
The new bathrooms have cream
tiled walls (set off by a red strip),
chrome fittings, terrazzo shower divi-
sions, and non-slip tile floors.

Prefab. Import
Stopped
Boost For Local Manufacturers.
The Minister for Works and Hous-
ing, Mr. Kent Hughes, announced in
Melbourne recently that the Federal
Government would not be importing
any more prefabricated houses.
In future houses would be supplied
by local manufacturers, he said.
The Minister was replying to com-
plaints by two Sydney manufacturers
of prefabs, that the Government al-
lowed imports of the houses although
the local product was 25 per cent,
cheaper.
As a result, plants were lying idle.
One firm, Vandyke Bros. Pty. Ltd.,
has a weekly output of 30 prefabri-
cated houses, but are down to 10
houses a week, and 130 men out of
a staff of 350 in the prefabricated di-
vision have been dismissed.
F. R. Wolstenholme Pty. Ltd. has
also cut its staff by half, and are only
producing three prefabricated homes
a week instead of from six to 10.
Both these organisations, and a
number of lesser ones, have suffered
heavily by State Government cancel-
lation of all future contracts.
The Minister said yesterday that
no orders had been placed overseas
for six months and the prefabricated
houses arriving now had been on order
for a long time.
The Minister for National Develop-
ment, Senator Spooner, stated that
importation of houses was only a tem-
porary expedient, and there had been
no intention to prejudice local building
industry.
The State and Commonwealth Gov-
ernments had only ordered 20,000
prefabricated houses overseas, he
added.
This Journal has been consistent-
ly advocating full encouragement of
builders to build homes for Australians,
with full freedom from restrictions and
controls.
If this had happened right after
the war (as experts claimed it should)
the cost of the 20,000 prefabricated
homes could have gone back into the
Australian economy.

Convector Fire Conserves Fuel.
In an endeavour to eliminate fuel
wastes, the U.K. Coal Utilisation
Joint Council has been seriously
grappling with the problems of pro-
moting efficient use of solid fuel.
It has been calculated by Council
experts in pre-war chimneys only ten
to fifteen per cent, of heat from coal
enters the room. In 1939, with coal
at £2/16/6 a ton in England, roughly
six to eight shillingsworth of heat
was gained and something like
.£2/8/' to £2/10/0 was wasted up the
chimney.
With British coal prices now aver'
aging £5/4A a ton, a fireplace costs
£4/10/' in waste to receive 14/' of
warmth.
Advances Made.
Modern designers have made con'
siderable advances, and those regis'
tered by the Council guarantee to
project into the room a minimum of
25 per cent, of the total heat from
the fuel.
These fires can generally be fitted
easily into existing fireplaces, and
prices range from under £5. Install'
ing one of these cuts waste by 10/'
to 15/' in the ton.
A practical benefit results in ob-
taining the same amount of heat as
before from less coal, or in burning
coal at the same rate and making a
room twice as warm. Most models
possess draught control in some form
so that the fire can be adjusted to
changing temperatures, and there again
effect economy.
The most wasteful part of a fire is
the lighting, and probably as much
coal is used in getting a fire going
as in two hours of constant burning;
and obviously much less coal is need-
ed in raising the temperature of a
warm room a few degrees than that
required to bring a cold room to the
same temperature.
Most Efficient Model.
By far the most efficient model of
open fire is a Convector fire (sec il-
lustration), which guarantees to give
at least 40 per cent, of heat from the
fuel.
This open fire, in addition to pro-
viding direct radiant heat, circulates
currents of warm air throughout the
room.
In most models, clean air has been
taken into the fire through a duct
under the floor, is warmed in a
chamber at the back of the fire, and
then emitted through a grille into the
room.
Heated air can also be conveyed
through ducts to one or two bed'
rooms, where they will provide a
background warmth of about 50 de'
grees. This is by far the cheapest
form of central heating.
In Britain an average size Con'
vector open fire costs about <£l2. plus
installation costs.

Glass is Important
In Modern Homes
The increased use of glass in homes
is a modern building development.
Not only larger window spaces are
planned in homes but large glazed
areas, in many instances extending over
the complete side of an external wall,
are no longer regarded as unusual.
In modern homes glass is being
used for structural, functional and dec'
orative purposes to an increasing ex'
tent, and is used to transmit light,
control ventilation, sunlight penetra'
tion and heat, and for its physiologi'
cal and psychlogoical effects.
Heat.
Control of heat and glare is one of
our main problems in summer, and
this can be achieved by means of over'
hanging eaves, slats, louvres, blinds,
and the use of heat absorbing glass
and double glazing. The latter is a
modern means of heat control.
The fading of materials and carp'
ets can also be reasonably controlled
by such methods.
Certain types of glass reduce glare,
and this is especially necessary for
good working conditions.
Many types of glass can be used in
the interior of homes. Vitrolite for
bathrooms and kitchens, for instance,
gives a clear colourful finish which is
easily kept clean.
Glass screens can also be used for
decorative purposes in the lounge or
for a bathroom shower recess.
Fittings.
Glass fittings for illumination can
give brilliance or diffusion. Glass
bricks which give light and at the
same time form an integral part of the
decorative scheme are being used in
building to an increasing extent.
The choice of louvres is usually a
matter of selecting suitable glass to
fill special requirements.
If a clear vision is required, sheet
or plate glass will give every satisfac'
tion.
For partial diffusion a suitable fig'
ured glass is readily available, and
glass merchants are always happy to
give advice and assistance in such
matters.
Mirrors are frequently used now-
adays by interior decorators, and their
use gives added light and an effect of
spaciousness. They -make a small
room appear larger and give a sense
of “aliveness” and brilliance.
They reflect light and can even
change the appearance of a room,
while colour can be imparted by us'
ing tinted mirrors—so popular over'
seas —to give a feeling of warmth,
coolness or brilliance according to
their shades.
Now It’s Everything
To Match
Gone are the days when cards were
played for the game’s sake. Now
players have to endure furniture up'
bolstered to match, in patterns of fut'
uristic Kings, Queens, lacks, Aces,
Jokers, and so on.
In this brief glimpse of an Italian
Cards Club we have modestly refrain'
ed from showing readers photos of
the curtains to match, and the enorm'
ous murals of highly'coloured playing
cards.
Looking at the furniture, the cur'
tains, and the murals, one could not
possibly mistake the room for any'
thing but a Cards Club. But, who
said a card room had to look refined?
Once upon a time wallpapers, too,
were designed only to cover four sides
of a room with modesty so that they
did not “out'do” the three'piece suite.
Nowadays, interior decorators use
papers boldly, but economically, on a
single wall. One strip, usually meas'
uring twenty'one inches by twelve
yards, is enough to transform a room.
The new bold papers, all of them
machine printed in Britain, cost 12/6
on an average (in U.K.) so that it is
not too expensive to revolutionise a
room every six months, or overnight
if the sight of it were too appalling.
Perhaps wallpaper manufacturers may"
like the idea of rebelling souls. It is
time they showed a little bit of spirit,
rather than go on living with things
that are dingy, old or not in good
taste.
One motif now on sale, goes one
better than the Italian playing cards
design. It has a background of chess
boards, with the chessmen prominent'
ly displayed thereon, with playing
cards scatered in profusion, without
semblance of design, around the length
and breadth of the wallpaper. Hand'
fuls of dominos have also been added,
and the paper, needless to say, is
printed in gay colours.
Another “decorating”hint, given re'
cently in an English periodical, says
that “two pieces of tartan paper, at a
total cost of 25/8 strike a warm note
on the northern walls of a room that
has other walls distempered ofTwhite”,
adding, “but be careful not to run riot
with the designs or you will have a
mock'tartan living'room guaranteed to
set every Highlander’s teeth on edge.
London “Punch” had a cartoon of
a lady calling upon a newly'wed,
whose tartan wallpaper was the “last
word” in decoration. But the lady
caller wore a dress of the same tartan
and they both almost fainted.
PLANS FOR N.Z. TIMBER.
A further stage in the utilisation
of New Zealand’s rapidly growing
timber is the cooperation of the
Government and private industry in a
new company to develop timber,
newsprint and pulp industries based
on the Kaingaroa State Forest, North
Island.
The scheme will provide the largest
single industrial plant in the Domin'
ion and is expected to take about
three years to construct.
Local production will also relieve
N.Z. and the Empire of important
dollar expenditure, and earn substam
tial export income.
PRE-STRESSED CONCRETE
IS STEEL-SAVER.
The use of “pre'stressed” concrete
in major constructions is widely env
ployed on the Continent. This pro'
cess minimises the use of steel and
combines great strength with light'
ness.
Recognising this, wideawake Aus'
tralian companies are showing great
interest in this new technique, and
this new method of construction
could well be the answer to Austra'
lia’s steel shortage.
PLAYING CARD DECORATION.
Portion of a Cards Club designed by Italian
architect Geo. Ponti. The playing-cards
motif seen on the couch and chair has been
repeated ad infinitum throughout the Club, on
the curtains, in the murals, and practically
everywhere there was space to fit this not-
original design.

Britain to Reward
Fastest Builders
“Build Quickly; Get More to
Build”
To everyone concerned with the
building of homes in Britain local
authorities, contractors and workers
Mr. Harold Macmillan, Minister for
Housing, recently gave this slogan:
“The quicker you build the more you
will get to build.”
The new “speed-up-the-houses”
drive will, in Mr. Macmillan’s words,
keep the order book full.
“There will be no arbitrary limita-
tion.” he promised.
“There is no restriction, no arti-
ficial limit. In future, local perform-
ances will d’ecide the local pro-
gramme.
“The greatest thing at this moment
is to build- in eight months if pos-
sible —what now takes 12 or 14
months,” he added.
The Minister said that the extra
houses he was hoping for would have
to be built out of the same amount
of materials as now —and to help to
that end designs of “save space”
houses wbuld be made available.
He hoped that the “People’s
House” will play a real part in the
more rapid housing of the people.
(The first two have since been
built at Market Bosworth. See story
“£970 ‘Miracle’ Houses”.)
Standards High.
The Minister said that the standards
conform to all requirements. The
cost is at least £l5O less per house
and there is an equivalent saving in
materials.
As part of the speed-up drive reg-
ional housing production boards are
being set up.
These boards will consist mainly of
offices of the Ministries concerned-
Works, Housing, Labour—assisted by
representatives of employers and
unions. Their job will be to cut red
tape, break bottlenecks and over-
come shortages.
Private builders will be given block
licenses for building groups of houses
so they can make their plans to build
more cheaply and speedily.
Mr. Macmillan added that he hop-
ed this introduction of a competitive
element would attract back to house-
building many of the smaller builders.
£970 “MIRACLE” HOUSES.
For £97o—little above the cost of
a pre-fab.—the Market Bosworth
(Leicestershire, U.K.) housing com'
mittee is building full-sized semi-de-
tached houses.
Councils throughout Britain confess
themselves as being astonished at
what they term “a miracle” in the
building of the first under £lOOO
house since the war.
The secret of the houses, confesses
Mr. Beckett,, chairman of the Market
Bosworth housing committee, lies in
two golden rules:
Rule Orie—Make sure that materials
in short supply are there when they
are needed.
Rule Two.—No large contracts.
Mr. Beckett asks for tenders for
two or three pairs of houses at a
time, ,which, he says, puts the con-
tractor on his mettle to do a good,
quick job so that he can tender for
another contract.
These methods have made it pos-
sible for Market Bosworth to build
600 three- and four-bedroom type
houses since the war and let them all
at an inclusive charge of under £1
a week.

Prefabs. Are
“Laughing Stock”
In Trieste recently a ship was load-
ed with 450 prefabricated timber
houses for the State Housing Com-
mission for Western Australia. It is
reliably stated that the moisture con-
tent in them is 30 per cent, although
for Australian conditions it should
not exceed 10 to 15 per cent.
If these dwellings were erected in
cold, moist areas like Austria, where
they originate, they would serve their
purpose fairly well, but in Australia
their erection is just a waste of public
money.
Private enterprise, with a wide
knowledge of timber, would not order
houses without specifications to mois-
ture content.
One authority suggests that the
West Australian Government should
immediately sell these houses (if it
can) in Europe and cut its loss, rather
than waste money erecting them with
the resultant terrific cost and upkeep
that will be necessary to put them in
order.
Undeniably the large orders and
foolishly high prices paid for prefab-
ricated houses by the various State
Housing Commissions has been one
of the greatest items in the expendi-
ture of Australian overseas funds.
The contracts were given, willy-
nilly, to any firm, established or other-
wise, who could promise delivery of
any sort of timber house.
Most of them are a disgrace to the
country of their origin, and are re-
ported to be the laughing stock of
the timber trade of Europe, especially
when it is common knowledge that
as many as five profits were made in
some deals before final delivery to
Australia.
There seems little doubt that Aus-
tralia has got a shabby deal, but most-
ly because European prefab, manufac-
turers have outsmarted our buyers at
every point.
The moral that emerges is this: Cut
our losses, if possible, and encourage
our own building industry to build
houses for the people as they have al-
ways done and the same as builders
are doing in Britain at the present
time. We have a “know-how” that
has been acquired and tested out
through the ages of time, which new-
comers could never hope to acquire.
Whether foreigners overseas or the
novice (public servant or politician)
in our midst, unless they have gone
through the same training as build-
ers have been through. We only ask
for the shackles of controls to be re-
moved —materials and finance —-to en-
able us to forge ahead and supply
every type of home and every type
of building too.

Swiss Invents New Veneer Process
FOR BUILDING OF FURNITURE.
A revolutionary process invented by
a 39'year'old man named Paul Hard'
er, of Wil, Switzerland, will turn straw
into beautifully veneered furniture in
a single operation.
Peat, sawdust, wood shavings—any
kind of vegetable waste —react just as
well as straw.
Harder claims he can make all types
of furniture from sideboards to bed'
steads, radio and cocktail cabinets,
room and house doors, building ele-
ments, parquet flooring, with a sav-
ing of 50 per cent, in the cost of raw
materials, 95 per cent, in the amount
of timber required, and 90 per cent,
in labour.
One of Harder’s first contracts was
an order for 2000 handsomely pro-
filed room doors, delivered to a build'
ing contractor at one-ninth the cost
of ordinary doors.
They are guaranteed not to warp,
shrink, nor expand in any tempera-
ture or degree of atmospheric humid-
ity, that they are fire-resistant, im-
mune to worm and dry-rot, that they
will take nails and screws just like
ordinary timber.
Simple Process.
In an unbelievably simple process.
Harder takes a quantity of sawdust,
peat, straw, or whatever material is
most easily available, adds as a binder
a small quantity of synthetic resin
(not more than 1 per cent.) and
some dry chemicals —the exact recipe
is the inventor’s secret —puts the in-
gredients through a rotary mixer and
fills it into a wooden or aluminium
mould.
The bottom of this die or mould is
lined with glued veneer, and around
its edges are four thin strips of hard-
wood, mortised at the corners.
High Frequency Treatment.
The filled mould is now placed in
a press to make the fililng more com-
pact. After a few minutes pressing
it is removed, and the top of the
“cake” is covered with a sheet of
veneer on which glue has been spread.
On this comes a die whose under
side bears the contour in negative
of the sideboard door or other panel
which is being manufactured. The
“cake” is now returned to the press,
put under 10 atmospheres pressure,
and high frequency current is switch-
ed on. From three to five minutes’
H.F. treatment is required, according
to the material used.
Afterwards the panels are allowed
to harden and cool under pressure.
The results are perfect panels or
doors which only require trimming at
the edge and polishing. The filling
has become invisible, covered top
and bottom by the veneer, at the edges
by the hardwood strips.
In his small, primitively'equipped
factory near the East Swiss town of
Wils, Harder, with only five workers
and a single press, L turning out 2000
profiled sideboard doors a month in
his completely unmechanised work'
shop.
By enlarging his factory, installing
more presses and engaging more
hands, he claims he could increase
production indefinitely for he is be'
ing swamped with orders.
Overseas Rights.
Harder has already sold the manu'
factoring rights for his process in
France and the French colonies, in
Canada, the U.S.A., and Latin Amer-
ica, and enquiries have been received
from Australia and japan. The
French licensees are about to com-
mence mass-producing stylised furni-
ture in a new plant at Pontarlier, near
the Swiss'French border.
The Canadian Flush Door Company
plant went into production near
Montreal in November last. Using
the Harder process, the company plans
to manufacture 2000 room doors a
day, thus turning into use some of
the 90,000 tons of sawdust and shav'
ings which hitherto they have been
forced to incinerate at great cost.
A newly'formed U.S. syndicate has
the rights for the U.S.A. and Latin
America, and intends erecting four
plants, including one in Cuba for the
utilisation of sugar'cane waste.
With ample waste material—saw'
dust, straw, sugar cane, etc. —avail'
able in Australia, there appears a
grand opportunity to introduce the
Harder process into the Common'
wealth.

Queensland Master Builders’
Association
ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1951.
In presenting the 69th Annual Re-
port of the General Committee of
the Queensland Master Builders’ As-
sociation the President, Mr. L. Dun-
stan, said:
Each year we have expressed our
concern at the continual rise in costs,
which have accelerated since 1949,
and which have been caused by the
large and frequent variations to the
basic wage.
Any increase in the basic wage aut-
omatically affects indirect expenditure
such as Holiday Pay, Statutory Holi-
days, Travelling Time, Workers’
Compensation, Pay Roll Tax, etc.,
consequently the effective rise in costs
is always greater than the actual wage
increase.
In very many cases when an in-
crease takes place, this indirect ex-
penditure is overlooked both by the
general public and the businessman
in endeavouring to assess Building
Costs.
In an endeavour to curb the infla-
tionary spiral, the Federal Govern-
ment introduced a credit restriction
policy.
In one respect this has had a bene-
ficial effect on the Building Industry,
in that it is eliminating the specula-
tive builder, who in the past has been
one of the many causes of increasing
building costs, by his bidding for la-
bour and materials regardless of price.
The gradual elimination of this type
of operator is having the effect of
easing supplies which are vital to the
economic completion of a job.
It is pointed out, however, that
this policy should be administered
judicially, for should the financial leg-
islation result in the restriction of ad-
vances for home building, Govern-
ment instrumentalities will become the
sole financiers for this purpose, and
all such building will become Gov-
ernment building.
In addition, there were several
other increases, making a total in-
crease in the effective wage of 18 pe
cent.
Materials rose accordingly, making
an estimated increase in housing
costs for the year of 16.4 per cent.
The Government Statistician states
that the average cost of a dwelling
approved in Brisbane in November,
1951, was £1,852, this being £251
higher than the corresponding aver-
age for the eleven months ended
30th November, 1950. The increase
represents 15.6 per cent.
During the year the Minister for
Lands stated that roads under con'
struction would open up more than
1230 million super feet of timber,
three times the present annual produc'
tion of Queensland sawmills.
When this becomes a reality it
should have some effect upon lessen'
ing the cost of future homes.
Building Supplies.
During the early months of the
year, wet weather prevented the dc'
livery of logs to mills, causing a tern-
porary shortage and the usual
scramble for timber.
This period was followed by a
drought, which is still with us, and
towards the end of the year there
was a distinct easing in timber sup'
plies, and also joinery.
The production of terracotta tiles
has increased, and roofing is not a
major problem.
Drainage pipes are extremely
scarce, causing a hold up in some
jobs. Quantities have had to be im'
ported, and this is one instance where
the Building Industry is saddled with
increased costs through lack of pro'
duction of basic materials in our own
country.
Brick supplies deteriorated to such
an extent that Builders discontinued
this type of construction, even to
brick bases in dwellings.
Builders are now approaching the
position where the supply is catch'
ing up with the demand, and this is
being accentuated by the high cost
of building.
The report said that builders in
country areas are concerned with this
trend, and in common with all Build'
ers are vitally interested in the future
prospects of adequate finance being
made available to prospective home
builders.
Timber has always been the pre'
dominant building material in Queens'
land, and during the past year th c
type of construction has increased
through lack of brick supplies.
Prefabs.
In the metropolitan area of Bris'
bane the State Government has em-
barked on several projects of prefab-
ricated, or, more correctly, pre-cut.
homes.
Contacts for these dwellings have
been let to overseas contractors, and
the houses are built to the design of
the State Housing Commission.
As members were unable to cope
with the housing demands, the Asso-
ciation raised no objection to the
scheme provided all labour and mater'
ials were imported.
Unfortunately, on projects some lo-
cal labour is being used to the detri-
ment of private builders, together with
a considerable quantity of local ma'
terial such as cement and builders’
hardware, which have been in short
supply for a considerable period.
Housing Costs.
Regarding housing costs, last year’s
report predicted a substantial rise in
costs owing to the £1 a week in'
crease in the basic wage affecting 1951
building costs.
In our last report it was stated that
the reorganisation of present facilities
in this Industry would be the speed'
iest method of increasing supplies.
It is understood that this procedure
is being put into effect and it is hop'
ed that beneficial results will be at'
tained.
A new factory was opened in De'
cember for the manufacture of cement
silica bricks, and it is estimated that
four to five million bricks will be
produced annually.
Cement supplies have been spas'
modic, and this item is again in
short supply.
Imported cement is costly, a major
item in this cost being shipping
freights and insurance, which amount
to double the cost of the manufactur'
ed article, so that imported cement
is three times the price of the local
manufacture.
After dealing with matters of a
domestic nature, including the Fresh
dent’s report on the proceedings of
the last Master Builders’ Federation
of Australia Convention at Adelaide,
the report continues:

Industrial Matters.
The Building Industry in the State
has been free from serious industrial
disputes for several years.
This position evidences the fact
that harmonious relations exist be'
tween employers and employees, and
credit is due to our Industrial Arbi'
tration Court, which has always made
itself available to determine disputes.
The Building Trades Group made
several applications for variations of
the Award, and also applied for an
increase in the basic wage.
The Association in each instance
appeared on behalf of the Building
Industry, and in the case of the basic
wage cooperated with other employ'
er organisations.
Following the increase in Tool Ah
lowance to Building employees, the
Tool Allowance of Bridge Carpenters
under the Bridge, Wharf and Pier
Award was increased accordingly.
Apprenticeship.
Mr. H. D. Noyes was appointed
Chairman of the Apprenticeship Com'
mittee upon the death of the previous
Chairman, Mr. R. Leggat.
In addition to basic wage increases,
apprentices received substantial in-
creases in wage rates in April, 1951.
These increases were the result of
voluntary increases granted in South
Australia for the purpose of attract'
ing apprentices to the Building Trade.
The Association has continued to
give practical cooperation to the
scheme by indenturing apprentices,
and encouraging members to employ
their full quota, thus ensuring a steady
supply of future tradesmen.
Membership.
At the 31st December, 1951, the
register of members was as follows:
Association Members 205
Exchange Members 39
Country Members 49
Honorary Members
300
Membership is increasing each
year, and the applications from Coum
try Builders evidences the fact that
they recognise the value of the As'
sociation.
Branch Associations.
The Association has endeavoured to
maintain close relations with Coun'
try Branches and to assist them where'
ever possible.
The Mackay Branch is now well es'
tablished and expanding in member'
ship.
The Toowoomba Executive paid a
visit to our Executive in May, and
during September a Branch Confer'
ence of delegates from all Associations
was held in Mackay.
Conferences have enabled the As'
sociation to obtain a better insight
into conditions operating in the coun-
try, and they have also established a
closer contact between the various
Executives.
The membership of affiliated
Branches is as follows:
Rockhampton 36
Toowoomba 39
T ownsville 53
Mackay 25
153
Finance.
A perusal of the balance sheet will
show that the capital of the Associa'
tion has been augmented, and the
finances generally have been care'
fully husbanded, the report states.
Conclusion.
From the above report you will re'
alise that your Executive Officers and
Committee have been particularly

busy during the past year, and I
would like to express my own per-
sonal thanks and appreciation for
their constant help and devotion to
duties during my term of office.
I feel confident that your new Pres-
ident will also have his duties con-
siderably lightened by the help that
will be given him by the Committee
to be elected.
During the past twelve months I
have realised that the President is
unable to accomplish much unless he
has the full co-operation of his Com-
mittee, as too many decisions must
be made without mistakes for the re-
sponsibility to be placed on the
shoulders of one individual.
I wish to extend my appreciation
to our Immediate Past President, Mr.
Day, who has been constantly at my
right hand, advising and assisting
with his valued experience.
L. DUNSTAN, President.
Invitation to Church
One of the most colourful and
striking billboard posters to be seen
in Sydney stands at the corner of Eliz-
abeth and Hunter Streets. Sponsored
by the Outdoor Advertising Associa-
tion of Australia in conjunction with
the Australian Council of Churches,
the poster shows a congregation en-
tering a neat red brick church against
an azure background. The message
reads: “Come to Church. Every life
needs an altar and faith for testing
time.”
Demand For Local
Prefabs
Call For Tenders.
The Federal Government’s decision
to stop importation of overseas pre'
fabricated homes will not benefit lo'
cal constructors for at least a year, ac-
cording to a leading Sydney pre'eut
homes manufacturer.
He claims that there are 20,000
prefabricated houses in transit and
paid for from overseas, and the Com-
monwealth decision regarding the im'
port curb will show no advantage to
local prefabricators for 12 months at
least.
The hoped'for boost for local build-
ers in the prefab, field may be on its
way, however, in the light of a cur-
rent Works and Housing advertise-
ment (see particulars in our Tenders
section).
Contractors who have existing or-
ganisation, workshops, plant and
equipment to undertake the manufac-
ture, supply and erection of prefabri-
cated or precut hutments for Army
Establishments are invited to contact
the Department of Works and Hous-
ing with regard to submitting tenders.
This qualifies an announcement
made some weeks ago by Works and
Housing Minister, Kent Hughes.
THE DIFFERENCE.
A new definition of the difference
between business and profesional
men.
It used to be that one lived above
his shop, and the other lived above
his income. Now it is that one earns
his expenses out of his income, and
the other earns his income out of his
expenses.
American Planning
and Civic Annual
The 1951 issue of this Annual,
which is received by all members of
the American Planning and Civic As'
sociation, is an interesting publication
setting forth the latest ideas, ideals,
achievements and developments in
these spheres in the American scene.
The contents is subdivided as follows:
(1) The Nation, Conservation of Nat'
ural Resources, and The Federal City.
(2) In the States. Roadsides and
State Parks. (3) Metropolitan Plan'
ning. (4) In the Cities and Towns.
Transportation, the future of “down-
town” districts; new towns and sub'
divisions: slum clearance and hous-
ing; community action.
Roadside Protection.
Apparently in America the same
problems of State versus Local re'
sponsibility in respect of the main'
tenance and improvement of roadsides.
That the problem is being energeti'
cally and systematically attacked is
evidenced by the fact that a number
of States have initiated state roadside
surveys. Civic minded citizens in
Pennsylvania have been particularly
active in this work and have formed
a Roadside Council who demand that
“highway polluters” must be restrain'
ed by law.
The articles on the maintenance of
State Parks and the special steps taken
to train personnel for them is of par'
ticular interest.
“Fresh Meadows”.
An article is contributed by the
New York Life Insurance Co. on
“Fresh Meadows”, their remarkable
housing development which covers
174 acres, houses 11,000 people in
3000 apartments. It is pointed out
that this project is an example of “in'
vestment building” as opposed to
“speculative building”.
Altogether a publication of interest
to all town planners and local gov-
ernment engineers. Copies can be
obtained for $3 from the American

SMILES BEHIND THE
CURTAIN.
Stalin, so the story goes, was feel'
ing very well-pleased with life and,
alone in his room, he looked at a
portrait of Lenin on the wall, smiled
at it, and said: “How far will we
get? What will become of us?’' The
portrait smiled back and said sweetly:
“I shall be taken down and you will
hang.”
ARCHITECTURAL ACOUSTICS.
This illustration was employed to illustrate an article in a recent edition of “The Architectural
Record’’ on Architectural Acoustics in which the essentials for good hearing for music and
other entertainment were discussed. The simple lines of the proscenium opening and the
concealed lighting in the stepped flanks bear striking contrast to the concert halls and auditoria
of former days.

Planning and Building in Australia
BRITISH EXPERT’S OBSERVATIONS.
SIR THOMAS BENNETT, O.B.E., F.R.I.B.A., F.S.A.
[Sir Thomas Bennett visited Aus'
tralia last year at the combined invita'
tion of the Commonwealth Govern'
ment and the Royal Australian Insti'
tute of Architects and attended the
Australian Architectural Convention in
Melbourne in November. He visited
every capital city and travelled in each
State. As an outstanding British
architect and planner and chairman of
the two new British satellite towns of
Stevenage and Crawley, this report on
his observations and recommendations
is published in full, for it contains
much food for thought for all charged
with the development of Australia. —
Ed.}
The Australian Outlook.
No one visiting Australia could fail
to be impressed by the sense of
bouyancy pervading the whole coun-
try.
This is reflected in the approach of
people whom I met in all walks of
life, and is in marked contrast to the
background of the majority of people
in the United Kingdom and Europe,
where the events of the past half'
century have tended to deprive in'
dividuals of their confidence that
achievement is, the automatic result of
hard work.
The vast size of Australia, compared
with the size of its population, the
ease with which it can feed this popu'
lation, and the rich natural resources
which encourage the manufacture
within itself of the majority of the
requirements of the ordinary man has,
up to now, led to development which
reflects the outlook of the settlers of
the wide open spaces, faced by few
of the planning and legislative prob'
lems which confront those dwelling in
more congested countries.
This background, I consider, colours
a great many of the things I saw and
discussed with Members of Parliament,
Lord Mayors, architects, planners and
businessmen of the country.
Planning Background.
The planning background of several
of the cities of Australia is of a very
high standard, considering the date on
which it was conceived and developed.
The mile square centre of the city
of Adelaide, and the fact that its in-
habitants have maintained a green belt
for a century have left it a model of
a city of moderate size, conceived in
1836 on lines which would be regard'
ed as a high standard in 1952.
The foresight of Forrest in purchas'
ing a thousand acres of parkland on
part of the boundary of Perth, with its
fine views of the Swan River a
unique feature of the city have
produced a wonderful background.
Modern planning would have to reach
a high standard were a city developed
throughout with equal effectiveness.
In Melbourne the fine streets in the
centre form the basis of accommoda'
tion for its large volume of traffic;
notwithstanding the present abuse of
these streets by excessive single, double
and occasionally treble lines of car
parking. In St. Kilda Avenue and
Frennington Drive this central plan'
ning is reflected in fine roads which
stretch into the distance.
Throughout the States of Australia
which I visited I found the planning
of University buildings and their sur'
rounds, of hospital construction and
design, to be of a high standard and
most impressive.
Population Expansion.
Against this background the country
is, I understand, politically committed
to endeavouring to double the size of
its population in the next 15-20 years,
and therefore is on the verge of a
fundamental change from the position
of a land of unlimited resources coni'
pared with the demands of its people,
to a land in which capital expenditure,
running costs of towns, amenities of
life in general insofar as they are
dictated by planning and people -
will be subject to the standards of the
more densely'developed countries of
Europe, instead of those of the hither'
to lightly-covered spaces of Australia.
Fundamental Change Necessary.
I formed the opinion that this funda'
mental change, which will so vitally
affect all planning and construction, is
only now commencing to be vaguely
realised by those responsible for de'
velopment.
The large scale of immigration and
a high speed of development render
action in connection with the planning
of capital cities a matter of the greatest
urgency, and allied to this is the equal'
ly vital question of the distribution of
the population in secondary towns.
The United Kingdom and all Euro'
pean countries, including advanced
countries like Switzerland and Sweden,
have been forced to house the bulk of
their population by the economic and
considered use of land; not merely be'
cause land in these countries is rela'
tively scarce, but because otherwise
communities would be unable to carry
the capital cost of the installation of
roads and services, and the mainten'
ance of such essentials as the Fire Ser'
vice, Police Force and Postal Service
necessary within a rating charge which
the population are able to bear.
Careful planning and considered de-
velopment is, therefore, dictated not
bv the amount of land available, but
by the essential economics of large
communities.
I am told that Sydney, with a popu'
lation of approximately 1| millions,
occupies an area larger than that under
the jurisdiction of the London County
Council, which houses approximately
million people.
High Burden of Public
Services.
If the population of Australia is
doubled, then the population of Syd'
ney would be doubled, and it is almost
impossible to conceive of an area
double the size of the London County
Council area inhabited by million
people. Under such circumstances,
difficulties of transport, the burden of
main services—sewers, street lighting,
transport of children to school, and
such essentials of modern civilisation
would become unbearably and impos'
sibly costly.
In a number of towns extensive
housing schemes are being laid out
with roads far too wide for the traffic
they will carry, a density over the site
area of four houses per nett acre, and
in many cases complete absence of
surfacing to roads, provision of foot'
paths, laying of sewers, waste or sur'
face water drains, provision of street
lighting and, in some instances, ab'
sence of general water supply.
Planned Development.
I would consider, therefore, that it
is of the utmost importance that plans
should be prepared immediately for
the development of all large cities of
Australia, accompanied bp the esti'
mated cost of development per head
of population; this development being
carried to a standard approaching that
of Europe, but being a matter for de'
cision as to whether the provision of
road surfaces, footpaths, green verges,
etc., need to be to the same measure
of completeness as has been found de'
sirable in the United Kingdom and
certain other countries.
These plans should also be accom'
panied by an estimate of the running
cost of the services when handed to
the future Local Authorities.
It is my opinion that the prepara'

tion of such plans would show that
far greater economies in road construe
tion would be necessary; roads would
have to be adjusted to the volume of
traffic they are designed to carry, and
possibly 80 per cent .of the population
would have to be housed at a density
of B'9 houses to the acres, the remain'
ing 20 per cent, being housed at 4 to
the acre and in some cases 1 or less
dwelling in accordance with a properly
graded pattern of living.
In the preparation of these plans
much greater attention should be given
to contour planning; on the one hand
to create greater variety in streets and
roads, and on the other to render the
development of sewers, surface water
drains, etc., more economical. In
many cases at present houses are being
erected with a complete absence of
these essential servics, in the happy
confidence that at some future date
these services will catch up with the
houses.
This may well occur, but it has been
the experience of more developed
countries like the United Kingdom
that where such services are left be-
hind the inhabitants live for a great
many years in conditions of discom'
fort, they suffer a great many serious
inconveniences because the portion of
the development which is non ' remu-
nerative has piled up to a work of
such magnitude that neither the in'
dividual, the Local Authority nor the
City can undertake it without any
serious disturbance of its economic
position.
Therefore, we in the United King'
dom have come to the conclusion that
we are forced to develop our housing
and our public services economically,
and we consider that the public ser'
vices must be in advance of the
houses.
Flats.
In considering the development of
large cities, due regard must be paid
to flats. A census of the require'
ments of the population will probably
show that not more than 3'5 per cent,
of people require flats in country
towns, and these will be mostly of the
two'Storey variety with a separate en'
trance door and a portion of garden.
Where travelling becomes a burden
on the population many will prefer to
live in flats in the heart of the city;
and a number of city occupations make
flats a desirable tppe of dwelling—for
instance, for transport, night and social
workers, people engaged in the cater-
ing and amusement trade, people with
no family ties, those whose business
keens them in the city at difficult
hours, and those who wish to avoid
long daily travel.
For these people, flat development
at high density is a necessity.
Development of a fine character,
together with the preservation of open
spaces, is best secured if such blocks
are high buildings, with as low a sur'
face density as possible. For this type
of development buildings can be erect'
ed successfully on the basis of 100'
150, or even 200 persons to the acre.
Revolutionary though these ideas
may be to the Australian mind, once
the works have been put into their
proper relationship the speed of hous'
ing is maintained and even increased.
Proper coordination is therefore a
matter of constructive thought and not
of physical difficulty in execution.
Construction of Buildings,
I examined a large number of the
“temporary” houses which are being
imported from European countries, in'
eluding Great Britain. In order to
keep the cost within reasonable limits
it is clear that the specification of
these houses has been reduced to a
minimum; and in this country far be'
low a minimum we should consider
desirable if maintenance is to be kept
to a reasonable level and the buildings
themselves are to have a proper “life.”
Experience in this country shows
that capital expenditure has to be
made in such a way that it lasts the
population approximately 100 years;
and in spite of the shortening life of
some types of building, which is the
result of rapid technical development;
there is as yet no indication that

civilised communities are rebuilding at
shorter periods than 100 years, and in
many cases it appears to be longer.
The cost of these imported houses
erected in Australia is extremely high,
and as far as I could ascertain varies
between £2BOO and £3600 for the
complete dwelling, including works on
the individual plot, but excluding all
road works and public services. It
appears to be universally admitted that
a house of brick or concrete construe'
tion could be obtained for the same
figure, or even less, if the labour and
materials were available.
The problem of labour would ap'
pear to be acute, but it seems that the
solution of the problem of materials
such as bricks or cement depends more
upon vigorous development by people
with expert knowledge and on large
scale production than on any other
factor.
“Prefab.” Maintenance
and Life.
If the production of bricks and
cement were forced forward at a
higher speed, houses of a far more
permanent construction could take the
place of buildings which will in the
future require extensive maintenance
and' rebuilding at much too early a
period.
It might be cheaper and better if
Australia imported a certain number
of craftsmen, even at a high cost,
rather than continue to erect thou'
sands of buildings which I am certain
will cause the nation as a whole com
cern before many years are past.
I would also question whether the
manufacture of these buildings in
European countries and transporting
them in large sections is sound. It
appears to me that serious and inform'
ed study of the problem would show
that a much larger proportion of the
houses could be pre'eut rather than
prefabricated; that portions of the car'
case could be made in a more solid
material, i.e., either brick, cast or
poured concrete, and that assistance to
the building programme could be
maintained almost to the present level
by the proper prefabricating of win'
dows. doors, kitchen furniture, plumb'
ing and possibly electrical equipment.
I formed the opinion that much
greater assistance could be rendered
by technicians from England, by dis'
cussions in greater detail and with a
fuller realisation of the diverse require'
ments of the Australian housing pro'
gramme; continually bearing in mind
the complexities of the problem of
providing houses on the one hand for
the large, established towns; and on
the other, houses for road works, rail
way, mining and other townships, and
some of the very fine water schemes

Decentralisation.
It is clear that the problems con-
nected with the centralisation of Aus-
tralia's population in her large cities
are even greater and more far-reaching
than those in the United Kingdom.
Expansion is taking place without
control in much the same way as the
British population gathered in large
towns in the nineteenth century, and
it may well be that Australia could
profit from the failure of Great Britain
and stem this movement by formulae
ing immediately a strong policy of
settlement in new or expanded towns
in different parts of the country.
Certain basic difficulties in the pre'
sent lack of foresight and control are
becoming visible; for instance, the
establishment of a factory in the centre
of an area of primary industry has the
effect of attracting much of the female
labour from the land, apart from creat'
ing problems of road construction,
housing and so on, which will be re'
peated each time a sizeable factory
spreads itself in the centre of a hither'
to nonundustrial area.
“New Towns.”
If these factories were restricted by
legislation to certain pre ' selected
points, preferably areas of existing
residence, e.g., towns of 10,00015,000
people, the strengthening of roads
would be much more limited, and
therefore less Costly in fact, once
strengthened the roads might serve 10'
20 factories.
The problems of sewage, water sup'
ply, surface water drains and other
matters would then be easier of solu'
tion because they would be supported
by rates or taxes paid by a large num'
ber of industries. Housing construe'
tion would be more rapid because it
is centralised in one area instead of
apart, and problems of Local Autho'
rity management and taxation would
be capable of solution by normal
economic standards.
I am convinced, moreover, that the
establishment of new or expanded
towns of this character would go a
long way towards stabilising the em-
ployees in primary industries over a
wide area around such an established
town and thus stop the drift of these
people to the capital cities.
Distances in Australia are covered
much more rapidly than in the United
Kingdom, and new or expanded towns
would suffer no disadvantage in being
100-200 miles from capital cities, sub-
ject always to local conditions.
The establishment of such towns
would enable technical education to be
provided, shops and amusements of a
high standard to be enjoyed, and thus
the normal amenities of all members
of the population could be greatly ex'
tended on a proper economic basis.
I passed through a number of towns
in Australia which appeared to me
quite capable of extension on these
principles, given a hi"h standard of
modern planning.
It has been found in the United
Kingdom that in such towns as Crawley
New Town once the industrial area is
established industrialists find benefit in
being congregated in a group and
therefore being provided with com'
mon advantages. The inhabitants of
such towns benefit on the economic
side, close contact between home and
work, and psychologically by a choice
of occupation.
On the human side, by a wide
choice of contacts people of differing
tastes and habits are able to join clubs
and societies which suit their chosen
range of activities.
Urgent Need for Planning.
The large areas of land being cover'
ed by housing on the outskirts of all
large cities in Australia are, by British
standards, being developed without
proper planning and coordination of
the houses themselves with other types
of building, and are being carried out
on a scale which, to one accustomed
to the more serious difficulties of
Britain, appear alarming.
The influx of 150,000 persons a
year into the country has, no doubt,
created political problems which de'
mand solution of great urgency. But
this urgency must be matched by a
drive of equal force for the production
of drawings and schemes to overcome
these problems and to keep pace with
the urgent demand of the incoming
inhabitants.
Without some such comprehensive
anproach to the problem of planning
and building I would venture to sug'
gest that Australia will find in a few
years’ time that she has developed
enormous areas of buildings which are
a serious drain on the community
financially and in spite of the cost are
not providing the inhabitants with
proper conditions of living and work'
ing.

Britain’s Contribution to Engineering
Festival Publication by The Association of Consulting Engineers.
“Great Britain,” says Mr. R. W.
Mountain, Chairman of The Associa-
tion of Consulting Engineers, in the
Introduction to this imposing volume,
“is the country in which the practice
of Consulting Engineering originally
began, and in which it has been most
fully developed. It is fitting, there-
fore, that a description of some of the
engineering work for which British
Consulting Engineers have been re-
sponsible should be made available at
the present time.”
And so it was that the present
volume was produced at the lime of
the Festival of Britain to amplify the
work exhibited and to record and dis-
play the work that cannot be displayed
as it is spread all over the world.
Royal Festival Hall.
Some fifty major projects are re-
viewed and illustrated, and appropriate-
ly the first article deals with the con-
struction and engineering services of
the great Festival Hall itself, for
which the firm of Scott & Waine,
M.M.1.C.E., were Consultant and Civil
Engineers.
The time available for the design-
ing and cons.ruction of such a major
project was too short and to achieve
it required the greatest effort from the
team of architects, engineers and other
experts and specialists. Some idea of
its magnitude is gained from the fact
that the contract price was £1,628,260;
steel reinforcement 2 340 tons: roof
steelwork 260 tons; mass concrete 8800
cubic yards; reinforced concrete 23,000
cubic yards; excavation 63,000 cubic
yards. Th e main contractors were
Holland 6? Hannen and Cubitts Ltd.
Captain Cook Dock.
Australian readers naturally feel a
surge of pride when they find that
after the Royal Festival Hall itself, the
first major undertaking reviewed is the
Captain Cook Dock in Sydney Har'
hour, which was a first'dass engineer'
ing achievement by any standards. A
large double'page photograph shows
the initial stages of the dock in
January, 1942 when the coffer-dams
had just enclosed the area to be de-
watered with the great “Queen
Elizabeth” riding safely at anchor in
the Harbour beyond.
The article on this huge project,
with its clean length of 1133 ft. and
width of 152 ft., is by the Consulting
Engineers Sir Alexander Gibb &
Partners, of whom one of the senior
partners was Sir Leopold Saville, who
selected the site.
The Brabazon Assembly
Hall.
Another fascinating engineering'
building project is the erection of the
enormous Assembly Hall at Filton for
the construction of the giant Brabazon
’plane in the largest steehframed as-
sembly hangar in the world, having a
floor area of 7j acres and an overall
width of 1050 ft.—which would thus

British Nylon Factory.
Another major project of the build'
ing as against the civil engineering
variety is the British Nylon Factory
at Pontypcol, which provides employ'
ment in continuous production for
2360 men and 475 women and which
has been described as one of the finest
examples of modern industrial archi'
tecture. It has a floor area of
865.000 square feet in the main build'
ing, 48,600 in the pilot plant and
35.000 square feet in the auxiliary
buildings, and absorbed 12,718 tons
of structural steelwork and 3138 tons
of reinforcement. Architect was Sir
Percy Thomas and Engineers Scott &
Wilson.
District Heating.
Mr. S. B. Donkin, Consulting En'
gineer to the Westminster City Coun-
cil, contributes an article on the Dis'
trict Heating Scheme that he designed
for the Pimlico Housing Estate and
which has caused such world'wide in'
terest.
The area upon which this develop'
ment is carried out was so badly blitzed
that the Westminster City Council
boldly decided to clear a large area of
old remaining property and plan an
entirely new development to contain
ultimately 1600 dwellings, and the
presence of the Battersea Power House
just across the Thames raised the
question as to the practicability of
using water heat from it to supply the
needs of the new estate.
The scheme developed consists of a
heat exchanger system in the power
house and a large heat accumulator
in the estate, hot water at 200 degrees
Fahrenhei being used as the heat
carrier, and this hot water can be used
directly for the space heating system
in the flats. Total demand from the
Pimlico flats and the Dolphin Square
project adjoining when fully developed
will be 73,000,000 B.Th.Us. per hour.
Powell d? Moya were the architects
for the Pimlico Housing Scheme,
which recently received the R I B.A.
London Architecture Medal for 1950.

there been more distinctive lead by
Bri ish engineers during the past

HOMES FOR U.K. MINERS
TO BOOST OUTPUT.
The first stage of the U.K. Gov'
ernment’s drive for more coal is to
be an alhout effort to build a record
number of houses in the coalfields—
for miners only— to attract manpower.
The Coal Board wants about 3000
more Italian miners this year (at pres'
ent fewer than 1000 Italians are em-
ployed), and miners have been asked
to consider coal output as a matter
of common interest, quite outside
politics.
The Useless Past

quoted the following expression of
opinion of the welhknown writer
and author of the satirical archb
tectural book “From Pillar to Post.”
by Osbert Lancaster.
“One of the treasured illusions of
the modern movement that must go
overboard is the frenzied rejection
of the past, that ridiculous attitude
of having absolutely no connection
with the period next door, which
has had such disastrous effects on
architectural education.”

Modern Sewage Treatment Plant
TEXAS SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR AUSTRALIA.
The sewage treatment plant erect'
ed by the City of Austin, Texas, is
modern in every respect, from its ar'
chitecture to its technical processes.
It stands as an example for many
other municipalities to follow, espeeb
ally in Australia and New Zealand,
where, excepting in the principal cities,
sewage disposal is still in its most
primitive stages.
According to the “Architectural
Record," a municipal sewage treat'
ment plant involves highly specialised
technical processes with which rela'
lively few building designers are farm
iliar.
As a result, it comments, all too
frequently these structures have little
to recommend them except insofar as
they keep out the weather.
In the case of the Austin plant,
which we here illustrate, exceptional
study has been made of the needs
which these structures are basically
designed to serve; and vital, func'
tional architectural forms have arisen.
Such a plant cannot fail to arouse
the interest of all municipal autho'
rities.
Treatment Plant.
This plant, employing the activated
sludge process of clarification, consists
of a number of tanks, a blower build'
ing (top and second top) and an of'
fice and laboratory building (bottom).
Upon entering the plant, sewage
flows through a ventura meter, where
it is measured, and thence to a bar
screen where rags, wood, etc., are re'
moved.
From here it goes through a de'
tritor for removal of sand, then tra'
vels into primary clarifier, remaining
for about two hours, during which
the heavier settleable solids are cob
lected and pumped to primary sludge
tanks.
The partially clarified sludge then
travels to aeration tanks; after six
or eight weeks of treatment, the sludge
is pumped on to sand beds for drying,
and is then ground and sold as fer-
tiliser.
Gas collected from the sludge
tanks is used for plant heating pur'
poses.
(Top) View of the blower-building. A

vices. (2nd top) Office-laboratory building
is at left, and blower building is at right.
(3rd top) Office and laboratory building de-

are designed to serve. The result are build-
ings which would be a credit to any muni-
cipality.

Cocos-Link In Empire Life-Line
£700,000 DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
In their peaceful solitude 1280
miles south-west of Singapore, the
Cocos Islands have hitherto been an
earthly paradise; they enshrined an
almost Utopian existence. There is
no unemployment, food supplies are
guaranteed, medicine services are free,
and at 65 those who wish may cease
work and draw half pay for the rest
of their lives.
Gradually evolved and perfected by
the Ross dynasty through the years,
this has led to a high standard of
living still unsurpassed east of Suez;.
Isles of perpetual summer string
across 55 miles of blue ocean, sea
breezes keep the unbearable heat of
the tropics at bay, maintaining a
steady 80 degrees temperature.
One of the world’s last private
monarchs, young John Clunies-Ross is
the fifth King of the Cocos Keeling
Islands, and his 1800 happy subjects
are now experiencing their first real
taste of “civilisation.”
Air Base.
Australia is now building a pas-
senger-plane base at Cocos. It will
be the first stopping place on the Aus-
tralia-South Africa air service sched'
uled to open in Tuly.
Cocos became headline news for
Australia in 1914 when H.M.A.S.
“Sydney” pounded the German cruis-
er “Emden” into submission at North
Keeling Island, and won Australia’s
first naval victory.
In World War 11., Cocos again fig-
ured in the war news, when the cable
station was shelled by a fapanese war-
ship. (King Sidney later died during
a fapanese air attack.)
In 1944, Lord Louis Mountbatten,
triple-Service Generalissimo, proclaim-
ed Cocos a military establishment, and
by the next year an air strip had geen
built on West Island. At one time,
up to 10,000 Service personnel were
stationed there.
About four years ago, Australia be
gan to consider Cocos as a base for
an Australia'South Africa airline, via
the Indian Ocean. There were sound
reasons for this project, the chief of
which being the forging of a new link
in the Empire life-line, in the event
of the Middle East facilities becoming
closed to Australia.
(If Guildford, W.A., is the point
of entry, a day will be saved on mails
to and from England.)
Costly Job.
No. 2 Airfield Construction Squad'
ron, R.A.A.F., with 500 men, has
been working strenuously to get the
base operational by July.
For instance, when the heavy equip'
mcnt arrived at Cocos in the Palik'
anda the airmen unloaded 3300 tons
of cargo in 21 days with landing
barges, although experts in Australia
had estimated that unskilled workers
would take at least 45 days.
The estimated cost of the job to
Australia is over £700,000, but it will
give the nation an air base of prime
strategic importance in developing di'
rect air routes from Australia to In'
dia, the Middle East and Africa.
THE CLUNIES-ROSS HOME.
The Clunies-Ross “Buckingham Palace”. This stone-built Oceania House, on Home Island,
forms a firm tribute to Ross toil and ingenuity. Every stone had to be imported from Scot-
land. Some of the bath tubs came from Perth, W.A., nearly 2000 miles distant; light switches
and blinds came 1300 miles from Colombo. The house has 14 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, ball-
room, billiard room, and 10,000-book library.
NEW CONTROL TOWER.
An excellent three-storied concrete control tower still stands at Cocos. It bears the inscription:
“Cocos, 3 feet”, indicating the height above sea level.

ANGULAR PLANNING.
In many American architectural publications we often see great freedom exercised in the placing of the house on
the site which is a great contrast to the stereotyped Australian fashion of always placing the front parallel with
the building alignment. As usual there are reasons and on analysis we invariably find that the homes illustrated
are of the large living type located on ample grounds as against in Australia having to locate the building on a
small plot which is quite often inadequate in width. In two of these examples, however, originality has been
displayed in planning and location of the cottage on the site. Apart from any aesthetic consideration there are often
considerable advantages from the aspect point of view in exercising more flexibility in this regard.

sion of the more important industries,
including those producing food and
export products. Thus the long-term
prospect is favourable for maintain-
ing a level of export earnings suffi-
cient to finance those imports need-
ed for all essential activities in the
economy.”
“Australia’s primary industries have
great scope for expansion aided by
research and provision of capital
equipment. The future may bring
consolidation in existing marginal
areas, more intensive use of settled
lands and greater variety of products.”
The Survey goes on to point out that
secondary industries continue to
broaden the basis of the national pro-
duct, replacing imports and supplying
the growing local population."
“It would seem that Australia’s
past insistence on skill among immi-
grants has been over-emphasised, and
that unless the Commonwealth is pre-
pared to accept unskilled workers, it
may fail to obtain worthwhile immi-
grants who are still available.”

CRITICISING OURSELVES
What Are We Contributing To The Future?
Being an address given before Parramatta Rotary on 23rd April, 1952, by Florence M. Taylor, 0.8. E.
The other day I addressed
Rotary at Rockdale. I told them
of the things that had happened
within one hundred years that we
are enjoying and taking as a right.
rather than a privilege and a
blessing. Men, in the past ten
decades, by their ingenuity, dilb
gence and hard work, had placed
many devices upon the market for
our comfort and pleasure. As
Kipling wrote:
"All we have of freedom
All we use and know
This our Fathers bought for us,
Long and long ago ”
g ’ g g ■
We have forgotten to say
“Thank God” for the fact that
so many men in the past were
endowed with the desire to work
skilfully and hard. They were
also endowed with brainpower
and originality to contrive and
devise many things of which I
will mention.
Criticising ourselves, we are not

much in our day to bestow upon

We Are Rich.
Australians are very richly
endowed by nature in this most
bounteous country, also we are
rich in the accumulated material
things as may be noted from
the fact that we have £1,835,000,'
000 in savings and trading banks
or £217 for each man, woman and
child, lying idle in our banks,
Our car registrations are nearing
1,000,000; nearly 2,000,000 out
of a population of about 8,480,'
000 own, or occupy their own
homes; We can now afford to pay
War Widows with three children
£lO/1/0 a week—this has risen
from £3/8/6 since the days of
the Chifley Government. Our
governments look after our can’t
works and won’t works from
teemage to dotage, but not as
much as they do in England for
Innately where they have gone
stark, staring mad. Last year they
spent <£48,400,000 on medical ser-
vices; £30,000,000 on dental ser
vices; £18,600,000 for optical ser'
vices, and not satisfied with that,
they are now giving free legal
advice to everybody. So far this
year they have considered 60,000
applications, 40,000 of which
have been given service; 2,500
cases have “come to judgment’'
out of which 80% have been sue'
cessful. Now, the government
owns the railways, postal and
telegraph services, water and sew'
erage, etc., but they do not give
those services free, though it is in
their power to bequeath them —
no, they needs must encroach
upon the preserves of the profes'
sional which is a very sorry state
of affairs, after professionals have
studied and spent noney at uni-
versities, devoted years of time
and energy to equip themselves
for an honorable and desirable
calling in life. This only goes to
show that England is poor and
is rapidly becoming poorer
through squandermania.
In Australia we can now spend
£25,000,000 a year on cinema'
tographs for sheer entertain'
ment. I am glad they only
charge a few shillings as an en'
trance fee and not 27/6, or
guineas per head, like the Stadium
to see two muscle maniacs misdi'
recting their energies. Fancy pay'
ing to see two people cuffing and
knocking each other about. If
they learnt Jui Jitsu, which they
could use in self defence, should
they be attacked, there would be
a bit of sense in it. I think every
woman should learn the Japan'
ese art of self defence.
100 Years of World Progress.
Among the things I mentioned
that we did not have 100 years
ago was the telephone, an inven'
tion of Dr. Graham Bell’s 78
years ago. By way of interest I
might add the first message that
went over the wires was from the
basement of his fiancee’s home
where he was experimenting, to
her father on the top floor. He
said: “I’m going to marry your
daughter,” and he did. He told
me that himself when he was in
Sydney. He gave me some of
his books and brochures which I
treasure.
One hundred years ago, we
had no sewerage systems, no
water reticulation into our homes,
no gas service, no electric lights,
for neither Edison nor Swan had
come together to take up and
carry further the introduction to
electricity by Michael Faraday,
Lord Kelvin, Clerk Maxwell,
Rontgen, and many others who
had contributed to this science.,
Edison was said to have had
5,000 failures, though he didn’t
call them that then —he called!
them experiments, and said hej
knew 5,000 ways of how not toj
do things.

Private enterprise brought to
the cottage of the poor, comforts
which Emperors and Kings of
100 years ago did not use, nor had
they ever heard of them. They
had not been invented.
In those days, we had no blot'
ting paper, no elevators, no cheap
structural steel for buildings, no
motor cars, no rubber tyres, no
bright steel, monel metal, stainless
steel —which has been such a
boon to housewives, no refrigera'
don, no electric cooking or heat'
ing appliances, no sewing ma'
chines, for up to that time clothes
were handed down as an heir'
loom and girls getting married
had to spin and weave their own
household linen and clothes.
They were called “Spinsters” and
still are.
There were no typewriters, no
votes for women, universities
were not thrown open to women,
there was no free education. But
men, when not so well educated
as they are now, took a far great'
er interest in their work. From
Mediaeval days onwards they
have been splendid craftsmen and
England could boast that they had
the finest furniture makers the
world had ever known. They
built the most beautiful, inspiring,
and architecturally perfect cath'
edrals and churches in the world
in which one feels awestruck on
entering, at the splendour of the
craftsmanship and the magnitude
of the scale. There is a religious
fervour over all and one seems to
realise one is in the House of
God. Craftsmen worked, in those
days, for the Glory of God. They
didn’t count the hours, they only
looked for achievement. We
must have a Glory in whatever
we undertake. Without a glory
in our task we become craven
and impoverished souls.
John Oxenham once wrote: —
Life is God’s sacramental gift
To man for his emprising,
The talent given to his care
For his Soul’s exercising,
A sacred trust bestowed on him
For his immortalising.
British Engineers Had a
Glory.
British Engineers took their
science all over the world, build'
ing dams and barrages in Egypt,
India and even in Russia; build'
ing bridges and canals and install'
ing electric generating plant —
even in Russia; establishing oil re'
fineries at Abadan for the Anglo'
Persian Oil Company. This oil,
by the way, had its early estab'
lishment through a man named
D’Arcy, a New Zealander, who
was at one time a partner with
Morgan in the Mount Morgan
Mines in Queensland. When
those mines seemed, through labour
troubles, destined to close, he
bought up nearly all the shares at
next to nothing. Then he went
abroad. When he was in Buda'
pest he read in a bank notice that
he would hear something to his
advantage by calling at the bank.
He did, and found he was a mil'
lionaire, for Mount Morgan had
staged a recovery. He allowed all
the shareholders to take back their
shares for what he gave and he
went prospecting in Syria, Persia
and elsewhere. He struck oil and
induced Lord Kitchener to get the
British Government to take them
up. They did. They spent
£3,000,000 on them then
£30,000,000 — possibly £300,000,'
000 would since have been spent
on the work of installing pipelines,
refineries, schools, etc. But the
Persians, the Egyptians and Indians
have forgotten what British brains
had done to develop their couii'
tries, for they have behaved
pretty badly since.
British Engineers built the best,
largest and fastest ships, most
dependable trains (until the Gov'
ernment nationalised them, since
when they have become dirty, urn
reliable and unprofitable). Their
planes flew the longest distances
in the fastest time, carried the
heaviest loads, reached the highest
altitudes and gave the best alb
round performance. Occasionally,

STRUCTURAL STEEL COLLAPSE.
Seventy-five tons of steel columns and girders
forming part of an extension to a hospital in
Philadelphia recently collapsed in a high wind
during construction. It had been bolted into
position ready for rivetting which was post-
poned owing to rain. Wind gusts of up to
40 m.p.h. were reported by the weather
bureau but the erection contractor said that
the wind set up vibration in the girders and
the bolts weren’t strong enough to hold them
together. No rivetted members were affect-
ed by the collapse. The damage occurred on
a Sunday and no one was injured.

ALUMINIUM IN CONSTRUCTION.
In 1951 in America, 500,000,000 lb. of alu-
minium products were used by the construc-
tion industry. The Aluminium Company of
America estimates that construction applica-
tions that utilised 18 per cent, of the com-
pany’s output in 1951 will absorb 30 per cent,
within two years after the defence metals
shortage is over, for it considers that they
can produce better building materials faster
and at less cost than other materials at pres-
ent being used. One of the most striking
architectural features of the new Lincoln Elec-
tric Co.’s new 17-acre plant at Cleveland is
the aluminium “curtain wall" (seen above)
28ft. high consisting of 15" wide aluminium
panels, rolled to form 3½in. deep box sec-
tions. Below is seen an example of “drop”
ceiling panels that slip into place and give
access to entire ceiling areas.

The British invented Radar, which
enabled aviators to engage the
would-be invaders over the Eng'
lish Channel. England was never
invaded, despite years of German
preparation to do this.
In Australia, Unionists, calling
themselves “Engineers” (not “Em
gine Drivers” which they virtu-
ally are) will come out on strike
with impunity to frustrate our
economy and rob other workers
of their daily wages as well as
the country of millions of pounds,
All the workers use the strike
weapon.
Our Union leaders speak ol
their “right to strike,” of legal
and illegal strikes. They give ad-
vice to their men to “go-slow”
on the job and the progress of the
whole country is retarded. We
have it in our power to punish
strikers under the law or dereg-

The greatest amount of bunk-
| um that has ever been crowded
into the heads of humans, has
■ been crowded in, in the present
; era.
Ears are meant to listen with
—some men listen to the wrong
! sounds. Our unthinking masses
have absorbed all sounds calcu-
lated to frustrate our economy
and reduce our built-up civilisa-
tion to a shambles. I mean we
are heading for it unless we can
call a halt. In our own build-
ing one can see what I call
: swarms of men taking about nine
I months to erect a few lights and
[ partitions. One cannot see pro-
gress at all for the time spent on
the work. It becomes a very ex-
pensive thing to pay for “no ap-
preciable progress.”
Clyde Engineering took six
| years to build 5 locomotives, then
the Government, annoyed with
the delay, placed an order for 25
steam locomotives in England.
Fancy sending orders out of the
country for goods that can be
manufactured here! At that time
we were paying £45 a ton for
' steel from Japan, when our own
steel could be produced for <£l6
per ton. It is now about £24 a
ton and is about three times
cheaper now than imported steel.
We have the knowledge and
the materials. Steel is being pro-
duced at about two-thrids capacity
! because the B.H.P. cannot get
I enough coal. [Latest advice 30/
4/52, is that they are equipped to
produce 1,750,000 tons a year and
the situation has so improved that
they can now produce 85% of
capacity.} We have coal enough
for 1,000 years. It is the
purest coal and we are told it
has the highest calorific value of
any coal in the world, yet we
can only get 17,600,000 tons of
it a year from our miners, though
we are equipped to use 20,600,000
tons of it, and could use far, far
more if we could get it from the
miners. Coal is known as some-
thing that contributes to our
comfort, but it is more than that
—it is the absolute and primary
factor upon which the whole life
and prosperity of our nation de-
pends. Unless we watch it we
will be turned into a nation of
sluggards through retardation of
our efforts.
Smash The Skull of Stupidity.
The brains of our workers have
been sadly and slowly poisoned
by vicious Communistic doc-
trines. We want to smash the
skull of such stupidity and let
us to the task of building up this
great country that offers so much.
We want to preach the slogan of
“Let us work harder, faster, long*
er and with greater efficiency than
the world has ever known, and
let us get somewhere in the scale
of life,” and if possible outclass
other nations in the race of life.
Being a larggard is not whole'
some for body or mind. You can’t
take out more than you put in.
Success does not happen —it is
organised, pre-empted and captur-
cd by concentrated commonsense.
As Longfellow once wrote:
“The heights of great men
gained and kept,
Were not attained by sudden
flight,
But they while their compan-
ions slept.
Were toiling upwards in the
night.”
Edison said: “Genius is 2%
inspiration and 98% perspiration.
I read in the paper the other
day that a man asked his young
son to get a bucket of sand from
a building in the course of com
struction. The boy was a long
time and the father asked what
delayed him. He replied that he
had to form up in a queue behind
all the other boys who had gone
to get a bucket of sand. This
was supposed to be funny. Fancy

parents teaching their children to
steal and what kind of a future
is before that poor boy!
Lord Keynes once said: “Never
in the lifetime of man now living,
has the universal element of soul
burnt so dimly”, and with that, I
agree. I don’t know what we are
heading for when parents talk
openly before their children of
how little they can do in a day.
We condone inactivity and drug
the mind with labour’s doctrines
of less work, when the purpose
of life is to be alert to work stead*
fastly and achieve.
We Are A Stupid People.
Today we are living in a state
of sustained anxiety through
frustrations. The whole world
seems to have lost its stability.
There seems to be no security of
tenure for our business, without
fear that some Government fresh*
ly imposed law will come down
upon us, with myriads of Civil
Servants requiring us to fill in
forms, and riddling us with
“please*explain” questions. When
nobody could get a scrap of steel
or a workman they would come I
swooping down on to property
owners, demanding that they put
fire escapes on their buildings
within 3 months and after that
along would come the “please*
explain.” Yesterday I had one
from the Department of Con*
ciliation and Arbitration —as
though any workman these days
needed protection against some
rapacious employer. I have to
pay a Sales Tax on what I
print on my own plant for
my own exclusive use. It is
tantamount to taxing a man
who drinks milk from his own
cow. These civil servants are for*
ever threatening us with dire pen*
alties as though we were crim*
inals. They are hanging over
our heads like the sword of Dam'
odes. The scourge of the civil
servant, with his controls, has
reached epidemic proportions.
For every three of us, who by our
diligence and enterprise in hard
creative work are contributing to
life’s progress, have to carry one
of his kind —a dead head, and we
cannot shake him off. We are
hard worked compared to an un*
dertaker for four or six men are
delegated to carry his dead in a
coffin, but three of us carry a
civil servant. Don’t forget that.
Control is a rolling stone that
runs down hill. Many a man
who has been climbing up hill
has been hit by that stone and
hurt and discouraged. Some
near the bottom, wEen the stone
has gained more impetus, have
been crushed.
Politics, with their controls,
have hampered industry, not
made it. It has been made by
sheer strength by the Chemist,
the Engineer, or the Master of
Industry, in spite of politics.
The man on the land —the
backbone of the Empire —has
been so discouraged that he finds
it no longer profitable to grow
things and soon we will be im*
porting vegetables, fruit and eggs,,

and according to a meat authority
in 6 or 8 years we will be import'
ing large quantities of meat.
Is this none of our business?
We are already importing steel
and coal which we have in abund'
ance if we will only work the
mines and produce the steel.
It is well known to all that the
ships coming into Sydney Har
bour take four times longer to
turn round than they do in any
port in the world if we exempt
the liners which sail on schedule
whether their holds are full or
empty. We can do nothing but
submit to the tactics of the wharf
labourers who reduce our stand
ards. We can do nothing to pre'
vent £250,000 worth of goods be'
ing pilfered from our wharves.
What a condition?
Last Friday I met a Mrs. Muh
holland quite casually. She said
her husband in the Amalgamated
Wireless Company knew me. I
remembered him. She said that
she had met me too, and I re'
membered her too, but long ago
it seemed. She told me it was
through Lady Fisk who, ten or
twelve years ago, was President
of the Signallers Comfort Fund.
Then I recalled the story.
One day during the early part
of the war, Lady Fisk rang to
say their Guest Speaker at their
Signallers meeting tomorrow was
held up by transport and would
not be able to address them;
would I step into the breach?
which I did. At that time the
Japs, had almost bombed Darwin
to smithereens. They were flying
over the Harbour. They had done
more damage to many things in
our harbour than was ever allow'
ed to get into the press, for se-
curity reasons. When we found
two Jap. submarines in the Har'
bour we exhibited them at Fort
Macquarie. We all thought we
were most victorious, we were
told of our successes, but not of
our losses. We needs must be
lulled into a feeling of security
and protected from anything that
was unpleasant or hard to
swallow.
I agree with J. B. Priestly who
once wrote that a man should
behave towards his country as a
woman behaves towards the man
she loves. She will do anything
for her husband but stop criticis'
ing and trying to improve him.
We should cast the same affec'
tionate glances at our country,
love it, but insist on telling it all
its fault.”
I love my country so I started
off by calling a spade a spade.
Said we are a stupid people—we
still are. It was rather fortunate
for us that the Japs, who were fly'
ing over Sydney knew so little of
strategy, otherwise they would
not have wasted their ammuni'
tion bombing Garden Island.
They would have put a couple
of well directed bombs into our
dams and left us to our fate. In
a week we would all have died
of thirst, or typhoid for without
water there could be no sewerage
system. There would be no elec'
tricity, for without water trains
to bring generating coal into the
city could not run. This is an
alarming condition. The miners,
according to the Communists’ soT
tening'up process, had seen to it
that stocks were low. At one time
Bunnerong kept a 6'months’ sup'
ply of good coal at grass; now
coal is so controlled that they
have to suffice with a few days’
supply of very bad coal —a hand
to mouth existence.
The first impulse would be to
make for the country, to the Ne'
pean, or Cordeaux River. I ask'
ed what- on? Railways engines
must have water, motor cars
must have water.
On one occasion I had an ex-
perience of this. We were out
way'back'ofbeyond and found
our car minus water but we
managed to limp home by putting
lemonade in the radiator. But
people do not carry lemonade as
a car emergency. Even if cars
chanced to be filled up with pet'
rol or water, we have road bottle'
necks to contend with. Down
south, we have Georges River
bridge with three lane'ways which
would provide two outward lane'
ways and one lane'way for re'
turning cars. One lane'way must
always be kept clear otherwise
there would soon be a complete
blockage. So on the two traffic
lanes if one could get 4,000 cars
in one hour over this bridge it
would take 14 days to get the
people out of Sydney by that
course to where water could be
found.
The Sydney Harbour Bridge
has six traffic lanes. The Japs,
would have left that for their own
occupation later. We could use 5
lanes for outward traffic and one
for inTound traffic, and get 10,000
cars away per hour. It would have
taken 6 days of 24 hours to get
1,400,000 (the then city popula'
tion) out of the city, assuming
we had enough cars, which we
haven’t.
On the roads up to the Nepean
with their narrow bridges and
road cuttings, one might have got
another 4,000 an hour or 14 days
to get the traffic out of Sydney.
These routes are reckoned indn
vidually but with all routes oper'
ating together and without mis'
hap the populace might have been
able to vacate the city in 4 days
if they had not died of thirst in
the meantime.

subjects to swallow, so the popu'
lace likes to forget about it.
From that day to this I empha'
sise we have done nothing to im'
prove our transport, nor have we
added another foot of roadway
or erected express streets or built
bridges or done a thing to relieve
traffic congestion.
When I was in New York they
opened a tunnel under the East
River on 25th May. Before we
left a week later they had started
another under the East River.
These are not small projects. That
one had cost £40,000,000 and was
designed to carry 50,000,000
vehicles a year, each of which
would effect a saving in time of
35 minutes. If a chauffeur over
there costs £1 per hour (our mo'
tor mechanics in Sydney get £1
per hour) it would save 10/' on
every trip or collectively £25,000,'
000 a year in wages. Don’t say
that owners drive their own cars,
because an owner’s time is far
more valuable than a chauffeur’s.
The authorities have estimated to
make <£2,250,000 profit from that
tunnel per year.
We are not at all bridge mind'
ed, tunnel minded, road minded
or subway minded. The subways
in New York collect 6,260,000
dimes a day=£3oo,ooo, or £109.'
500,000 a year. In saying New
York is so much bigger, it will be
right, but it only has a population
of less than 6 times Sydney’s pop'
ulation so we should proportion'
ately expect l/6th. of that deveb
opment but we don’t get it. We
don’t get l/60th.
From a Defence Point of View.
We hear of the marvellous be'
haviour of our men in the firing'
line. They were volunteers. Oc'
casionally we hear scraps of our
military machine here—mostly it
is pathetic, for the laws state we
cannot go outside of Australia to
defend our shores, even if an
enemy should make a base of New
Guinea.
A powerful enemy could
promptly oust Indonesians who
now make claim from the Dutch
that New Guinea belongs to liv
donesia, which it does not do,
neither racially nor nationally. But
we are impotent to protect it even
though it be at our very door. The
people voted our defence was to
be inside Australia only. Are
we a stupid people after that?
Australia is ours to do as we
like with it. Are we going to let
others make away with such
things as I have mentioned to'
night without raising a finger?
In conclusion, I can mention a
verse by R. L. Sharpe.
Isn’t it strange that princes and
kings,
And clowns who caper in saw'dust
rings,
And common folk like you and me
Are builders for eternity.
To each is given a bag of tools,
A shapeless man and a book of
rules,
And each must make ere life has
flown
A stumbling block or a stepping
stone.

U.S. Housing Trends
“Slab-on-ground” Construction
Popular.
Use of “slab-on-ground” construc-
tion in the U.S.A. has shown a rapid
growth during the past 10 years.
Nearly one-fourth of all houses built
during the first half of 1950 had a
slab-on-ground floor —whilst almost
none had in 1940. Wood joist floor
framing was used in more than three-
fourths of homes built in the U.S. last
year.
Other interesting U.S. housing
trend are the general changes in
structural design during the past dec-
ade.
For instance, there has been a de-
cided swing away from \\ and 2 storey
homes to 1-storey homes. In 1950,
86 p.c. of the homes built in the U.S.
were single storey; in 1940, only 67
p.c. were of that type.
In 1950, only 14 p.c. of homes
were 1-| or 2 storey; in 1940, 33 p.c.
were more than one storey.
Most popular size of home built in
1950 were 4-room houses, of which
47 p.c. were constructed, as against
22 p.c. in 1940. Larger homes were:
5-room houses, 1950 (35 p.c.), 1940
(47 p.c.): 6-room houses, 1950 (17
p.c.). 1940 (26 p.c.): 7 or more
room houses, 1950 (1 p.c.), 1940 (4
P-c.).
(In 1950, no 3-room houses were
built; in 1940 the number was 1 p.c.
of total homes constructed.)
Homes Smaller.
In regard to the calculated area in
square feet of homes built in 1950 as
against 1940, one-storey homes in
1950 had a calculated area of 941
sq. ft., in 1940, 1009 sq. ft. or 2-
storey, 1950 (1252 sq. ft.); 1940
(1523 sq. ft.). The average, all
houses —was; 1950 (983 sq. ft.),
1940 (1177 sq. ft.).
Eleven p.c. of homes built in 1950
were of masonry; the same percent-
age as in 1940.
In 1950, 89 p.c. were frame (in-
cluding a few frame and masonry
combined; in 1940, this percentage
(89 p.c.) was the same.
In 1950, 78 p.c. of new homes had
no fireplace, against 38 p.c. in 1940;
while in 1950 22 p.c. of existing
homes had fireplaces, compared with
62 p.c. in 1940,
Other trends in 1950 governed by
U.S. climatic conditions, disclosed an
unprecedented economy of building
construction in comparison with a
decade ago.
Discovery of New
Tropical Hardwood
With the discovery of a new trop-
ical hardwood in Central America and
along the northern coast of South
America, industry has at last found
a wood with an extremely high wear
resistance.
The hardwood is five times as
strong as the American white oak
and nearly half as strong as alu'
minium.
It comes from a medium-sized tree
known as kaneelhart.
The hardwood has such high wear
resistance, it is claimed, that it would
make hard-as-iron and practically in'
destructible thresholds for doorways,
tool and utensil handles, parts in tex'
tile mill machinery and for turned'
wood products of all kinds.
It is also one of the strongest and
heaviest woods in the world, although
it weighed only one-third as much
as aluminium, and can be machined
to a mirror-like finish.
RECENT
CONTINENTAL
ARCHITECTURE.
That war-torn Europe
seems to be able to
erect plenty of fine new
public buildings -
against virtually none
in Australia—is borne
out by these three in-
teresting examples.
(Top) Fine new hall
at Lausanne, Switzer-
land, in which an un-
usual lamella-like plan
has been utilised in
the layout of the rein-
forced concrete ribs to
the wide roof, in
which some panels are
glazed and others are
solid. (Middle) The
spacious concourse of a
recent Italian Railway
Station in which the
splendid natural light-
ing is a feature.
(Bottom) New labora-
tory building in Mun-
ich in which the pro-
tective awnings allow
for the passage of light
as well as providing
shelter.

Iceland Harnesses
Hot Springs
Believe it or not. they are now
growing bananas in Iceland as a re-
sult of the ingenious harnessing of
the hot springs which are plentiful
there.
Using the heat from the natural
hot water supply, schools, office build-
ings, flats and private houses are kept
comfortably warm night and dav, for
the supply of hot water is inexhaust'
able.
Experiments were first made in
1930 with a plant about two miles
from Reykjavik, the capital.
A hot spring was tapped and fifteen
quarts of water per second were pump-
ed into the town to provide heat for
the State Hospitals, a large public
school, a swimming pool, and about
40 private houses.
This plant is still in use, but is be-
ing overshadowed by the great mod-
ern one which began operating in
1943.
The city bought from a private fam-
ily the rights to all the thermal springs
within ten miles of Reykjavik, and
set up plants capable of pumping 81
gallons a second into a double pipe-
line which runs up and down the
hills, across fields and under streets
to the storage tanks at Reykjavik.
All pipes are specially insulated to
prevent loss of heat, and the hot water
having reached the tanks, flows by
gravity to the city.
It only loses five degree Centigrade
of its heat from the time it is pump-
ed out of the earth to the time it
comes from the bathroom tap—when
it is 75 to 80 degrees C. or 20 de-
grees below boiling point.
It would take 100,000 kW of elec-
tricity to heat an equal amount of
water to the same temperature.
Today 3500 houses are heated by
hot water and it is planned to serve
city ultimately.
The small charge made for the
water will more than pay off the cost
of the plant within ten years.
Iceland’s hot water is so wonder-
fully pure that it requires no chemi-
cal treatment of any kind.
As a result of harnessing the hot
springs, gardeners can heat their hot
houses to grow roses, asters, hydrang-
ers, tomatoes and bananas, even
though the climate is sub-arctic.

ANNEXE TO CHRYSLER BUILDING,
NEW YORK.
One would think that a huge skyscraper like
the Chrysler building would have enough
area, yet now we learn that a new 32-storey
“Annexe” seen above (to the right) has
been built. It is air conditioned throughout
and will also provide space for plant to air-
condition a large portion of the old Chrysler
building adjacent (seen on the left). The
new structure is known as the Chrysler
Building East.”

Veteran British
Builder
Sir Harry Sellev.
Celebrating his 80th birthday on
the 9th December is the President
of the British Federation of Master
Builders, Sir Harry R. Sellev, who
has been President of the Federation
since 1945 and much of his time,
energy and experience have gone into
building up the Federation to its pres-
ent widespread 11,000 membership.
Sir Harry has been in the building
industry for over 60 years. Coming
in 1892 from an apprenticeship in
Devonshire to work as a journeyman
on the erection of the old Hotel Cecil
in the Strand, he later founded the
firm of Swain and Selley and was rr
sponsible during his active career for
the building of more than 25,000
houses in London and its environs.
He has been Chairman of the
L.C.C. Housing Committee, pioneer
of the old House-Builders Association
and the first Chairman of its London
organisation, and a Conservative M.P.
for fourteen years until the General
Election of 1945. He was knighted
in 1944.
Unique Bricklaying Contest.
Sir Harry engaged in a unique con-
test in the latter years of the war.
During a debate in the House on the
question of bonus rates for bricklay-
ers, he challenged well-known budd-
ing trades unionist George Hicks, then
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minis-
ter of Works, to a bricklaying contest.
It took place in the forecourt of the
House of Commons, was won by the
veteran President of the Federation.
Recently Sir Harry appeared on tele-
vision to introduce models made in the
Festival competition organised by thj
Federation.
OUR COVER
The tall, graceful, impressive A.W.A.
Building in York Street, Sydney, epi-
tomises the three industries to which
this Journal is dedicated. Building,
Lighting, and Engineering.
Three hundred and sixty feet in
height from pavement to the top of the
tower, the building houses all the ad-
ministrative offices of the A.W.A. ac-
tivities, as well as broadcasting and
recording studios.
The Architects were D. T. Morrow
and Gordon and Robertson and Marks
(in association). Structural Engineer,
Mr. E. C. Everingham, Chief Engineers,
Trussed Concrete Steel Co. (Aust.)
Pty. Ltd., and the Builders were
William Hughes and Co. Pty. Ltd.
The tall tower is equipped with a
revolving aircraft beam.
Permits to Build
Hotels
Seven modern hotels are to be built
in the Sydney metropolitan area, and
the necessary permits have now been
granted, the Minister for Building Ma-
terials, Mr. Dickson, announced yes-
terday.
The new hotels will provide con-
siderably improved accommodation.
Mr. Dickson said.
Each would have 20 to 30 bed-
rooms, mostly equipped with shower
recesses.
Included in the seven permits is
one for a community hotel to be built
by Randwick Council at Maroubra.
The latest permits granted by the
Department of Building Materials are
for a second hotel at Maroubra, two
hotels at Fairfield, and one each at
Balgowlah, Pagewood and Caringbah.
Other important building permits
recently granted are for two large of-
r u in Flizabeth St

WHAT THE WORLD IS DOING
NEW DESIGNS AND TECHNIQUES DISTINGUISH U.S. BUILDINGS.
At first glance, the buildings here'
with illustrated appear to belong to
each other, but in actual fact, almost
the full width of the U.S.A. separates
the top building from the bottom
three.
Our top illustration is of Ari'
zona’s capital annexe in Phoenix,
which has been called by its architect
a “Design against the sun.”
The building features visors of con'
crete running the length of the build'
ing to shade windows the whole year
round, except during January and
February.
The windows are “head'high” and
standard filing cases fit beneath them
without interfering with window area.
This arrangement also eliminates glare
in employees’ eyes, and enables them
to work in comfort.
The other three buildings we illuc-
trate are the recently completed struc-
tures at the General Motors Technical
Centre near Detroit.
From first impressions, they seem
to be all glass, but closer examination
discovers structural framing and glossy
metal spandrels; also, that two of the
structures have glazed'brick end walls.
Steel columns are exposed on the
exterior of the buildings. These
structural members are slender, mak'
ing the structures appear taller, yet
not interfering with the feeling of
transparency given by such large areas
of glass. In one building (see illus'
tration, second from top), the col-
umns likewise serve as mullions.
Construction details are interesting.
Spandrels are faced wih porcelain-en-
amelled steel—both on the interior
and exterior. Of sandwich construc-
tion, they are 2in. thick panels, the
metal faces being bonded to a resin-
impregnated paper, honeycomb core.
With no metal-to-metal contact, the
panels have good resistance to heat
transmission. This was improved even
more by filling the honeycombs with
a granular insulation.
The buildings are now occupied by
General Motors Engineering staff.
They are the first of five groups to be
built on a site extending over a mile
and a quarter or, to be more exact, on
an 815-acre site north of Detroit.
The project is expected to be com-
pleted in the next two or three years.
The three structures built for the
engineering staff are office, shop, and
dynamometer building.
New-Type Brick.
Exterior walls at the end of the of-
fice building are built of bright red,
glazed brick. The facing, which was
also used at the ends of the dyna-
mometer building, but in bright orange
was developed by the architect and
manufactured exclusively for this pro-
ject. It is a ceramic-glazed, sand-
moulded, shale brick. Colours are
brilliant and very glossy.
Gas Without Coal-
In Wales
In Whitland, Carmarthenshire, 240
households are now using a new-style
gas made from butane —an oil by-pro-
duct —mixed with air. It can be sent
through ordinary gas mains and used
in ordinary gas appliances.
Butane gas has a different smell
from coal gas, is heavier, less poison-
ous, and less explosive. Cost to the
consumer is the same, but its heating
value is said to be twice as high.
Previously, the Whitland Gas
Works had been using 538 tons of
coal a vear, and if similar plants-are
installed at the 52 small gas under-
takings in Wales where such a system
is suitable, it would save 75,000 tons
of coal per annum.
Fire Damages
Timber Yard
£20,000 Loss in Granville Blaze.
A recent fire at a Granville timber
yard did about £20,000 damage, and
threatened nearby homes for some
time.
The fire destroyed Rowell’s timber
yard and contents, including a paint
shop and supplies of kerosene, tur-
pentine. petrol and white spirit.
Leaping flames brought down elec-
tric wires, blacking out all homes in
the area.
Six shops in front of the timber
yard were endangered, but firemen
prevented the fire from reaching
them.
TAKING THE COUNT.
It isn’t only in Australia that of'
ficials use too many words, says a
U.S. Congressman.
“Lincoln’s Gettysburg address con'
tained 266 words. The Ten Com'
mandments contain 297 words. The
Declaration of Independence contains
about 1500 words. But the Office of
Price Stabilisation order fixing prices
for cabbages contains 26,911 words.
(Top) Design against the sun. Arizona’s
capital annexe in Phoenix features visors of
concrete running the length of the 212 ft.
building to shade windows all year, except
during January and February. Windows are
“head-high” and standard filing cases fit in
beneath them. Building is 50 ft. deep (Sec-
ond top) Office building at General Motors
Technical Centre, Detroit. In this structure
columns double as mullions, and the windows
are double-glazed. Above and below them
are porcelain-enamelled metal panels, which
are bonded to an insulation core. Building
is three stories high, 53 x 370 ft. in plan.
(Third top) In this huge G.M. shop building,
windows contain over 50,000 sq. ft. of double-
glazed heat-absorbing glass, with a ½ in.
hermetically sealed air space between panes.
(Bottom) Dynamometer building. Walls are
new type brick or insulated metal panels.
Stacks in front are for exhausting fumes from
test rooms inside. It is rather nice to see
an industrial requirement, such as fume stacks
embodied in the design of the building and
featured architecturally.

THE CHARM OF TIMBER.
There is an ever-increasing volume of people in Australia who are building timber houses and the surprising
fact is that the prejudice against them that has existed in some minds, should have persisted so long. In America,
of course, there arc more timber houses than brick, but superbly equipped with suitable timbers such as Oregon
and redwood whereas our hardwoods are not the best for all aspects of construction on account of their weight,
shrinkage and warping propensities, and they are more difficult to handle and drive nails into than redwood or
cregon. The charm that can be obtained from timber is well instanced in the two top examples. The lower right
design accommodates four bedrooms and a bathroom in the roof space with generous dormer windows, while
the lower left is a low-lying plain design relieved with a stone chimney in random rubble stonework.

ONE. TWO OR THREE BEDROOMS.
No matter what size the house there is always a good layout available if enough thought is given to it by those
skilled in the art of planning. Bottom right is a house brought right down to basic fundamentals and yet ade-
quate for the childless couple or older people where family is married. Bottom left is also a basic plan with
two bedrooms; it will be noted that neither of these have a laundry which Sydney building regulations insist
must be provided, in spite of the fact that many people send the clothes to the laundry. Top left is very
similar to the one beneath but has the lounge turned sideways instead of lengthwise. Top right provides three
bedrooms and a dining room in addition to lounge room. Elevational treatments are all straightforward and
unostentatious.

THAT 1000-HOUR LAMP LIFE.
The life of the incandescent lamp
has recently been getting quite a lot
of attention in the daily Press, and it
might therefore be worth stating one
or two facts about the matter.
As its name implies, the incandes-
cent filament lamp produces light by
the heating of a wire filament to white
heat. The hotter the filament the
more efficiently does it convert elec-
tricity into light (i.e., the higher will
be the lumen per watt efficiency); but
on the other hand the hotter the fila-
ment the sooner will it “burn out”
—because higher temperature means
quicker evaporation of the metal fila-
ment, which ultimately burns through
at its weakest (and hottest) spot.
Lamp efficiency can of course be im-
proved to some extent by coiling and
recoiling the filament, by using special
gas fillings, and so on. But for any
given type of incandescent lamp
operating on a given supply voltage
and at a given rated wattage, lumen
per watt efficiency and lamp life are
inextricably linked. Higher efficiency
can only be obtained at the expense
of shortened life, and lengthening the
life inevitably means a loss of
efficiency.
It is clear that light will be obtained
most cheaply when the combined cost
of electricity and of lamp replacement
is a minimum. For general service
lamps (including those used for
domestic lighting) the most economi'
cal lamp has been found to be one
having an average life of 1000 hours,
as quoted in the appropriate British
Standard Specification No. 161.
Naturally, in some circumstances a
1000'hour life may not be the best.
For example, in Norwegian street
lighting practice, hydro'electricity is
plentiful and extremely cheap, where-
as the cost of replacing lamps is rather
high. In this case a less-efficient lamp
which burns more electricity than
usual, but which goes for 2500 hours
without replacement, is a better econo-
mic proposition. At the other end of
the scale we find projector lamps,
photoflood lamps and other types of
lamps in which efficiency is all im-
portant, and whose lives have been
reduced to as little as two hours for
its sake.
The foregoing remarks, of course,
apply to incandescent filament lamps
only. In the case of mercury, sodium
and fluorescent lamps, life and effi-
ciency are not linked in the same way,
and in the last few years there have
been substantial increases in both rated
life and the lumen per watt efficiency
of the fluorescent tube.

How Holland Does It
Six months ago the Dutch Gov-
ernment announced that the acute
housing shortage in Holland could
not be overcome before 1957, but
planners are now working to overcome
the shortage by 1954.
Methods used are interesting. Three
public loans were floated with the aim
of raising £2,500,000. Within one
month the public had subscribed £7,'
500,000.
The loans were at 4i p.c. for 25
years, and were issued in £5O and
£lOO bonds.
Since the liberation, Holland has
built 200,000 new houses, last years
total being 58,000.
During the period 1950'51, 67,444
houses were completed in Australia,
compared with 55,485 constructed in
1949-50, 80,000 more were under con'
struction at the end of 1951.
Holland has a population of just
over 9 million. Australias is only
about 1 million less.

ANN HATHAWAY OR LE CORBUSIER.
The choice between the house designer today may be said to lay anywhere between Ann Hathaway and her
cottage, the spirit of which is portrayed in the bottom left example, and the French modernist, Le Corbusier,
where “machine for living in” is epitomised in the top left example. In between these two poles of human ideals
lie the whole gamut of variation, two of which are to be seen in the other two examples. But no matter what
it looks like the house will continue to play a major part in our lives.
