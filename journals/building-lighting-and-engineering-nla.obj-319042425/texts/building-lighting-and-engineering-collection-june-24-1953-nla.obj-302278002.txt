intense summer heat.
Cane-ite is the one wallboard that insulates as
well as decorates. Reduce your building-time
estimates! . . Reduce your building-cost
estimates! ... by using Cane-ite for walls and
ceilings. Cane-ite comes in 6,7, 8,9, 10 and
12 foot lengths and 3 or 4 foot widths. This
choice of sizes makes this easy-to-handle
board quick-to-handle also.
Cane-ite takes any type of decoration. Can
be painted in any finish or papered. It is
being used for new construction and for re-
I modelling in every State of Australia. In
schools, hospitals, offices, libraries, civic
I auditoriums and private homes. In new
constructions or for remodelling.
Cane-ite is white-ant proofed another
reason for its success.
You can have a choice of three finishes (1)
Natural suede-like finish; (2) Ivory finish;

vaguely described by the customer. Now the
thrilling, new and unbelievably lovely "DULUX

A hundred years ago, ALUMINIUM was little more than a scientific curiosity.
Even half a century ago, Aluminium was still so difficult to come by that its
price placed it amongst the precious metals. To-day, the uses of aluminium
have so expanded that it is used in large tonnages by nearly all the major
industries. Now, you may ride in an aluminium railway coach, letters may be
carried in aluminium aircraft at speeds approaching the speed of sound, and
power, light, heat and air conditioning may be brought to you by means of
aluminium conductors.
To-day Aluminium is first in the non-ferrous metal groups in world production by
volume, and neither the increase in volume nor the expansion in the metal’s industrial
use show any signs of diminishing.
V ou are invited to consider afresh how trade and industry can make use of this metal. The
solution of many complex problems has been made possible by the application of
aluminium and its alloys to an extent that almost every activity on land, sea and in
the air has in some way been speeded, lightened or beautified by this versatile metal.
The products of Aluminium Union Limited include:—
Ingots; Alloys; “Kingstrand” Aluminium Houses; Corrugated Roofing and Siding Sheet;
“Alpaste” Paint Pigment; Chemical Section; Bauxites; Alumina (Hydrate and Calcined);
Aluminium Sulphate; Aluminium Fluoride; Artifical Cryolite; Fluorspar; Magnesia.

GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
The longdooked for ceremony
will be over when this article ap'
pears in print, though for reasons
that will be obvious the Corona'
tion must be viewed as a distant
prospect.
The eyes of the world have
turned towards Westminster Ab'
bey. Those of us who have had
to use the eye of imagination,
schooled by the multitude of pic'
tures of the Abbey and its neigh'
bouring streets of the West End,
and aided by the broadcast de'
scription, must miss much of the
pageantry of the scene, but,
nevertheless, need lose nothing of
the significance of the occasion.
While we canpot take in the ac'
tuality we can distil something of
its real essence.
In this Her Majesty had ah
ready done something to help us
for did she not tell us in her
Christmas Day broadcast that she
would be dedicating herself anew
to the service of her people. To
quote her own words:
“I shall do so in the presence
of a great congregation, drawn
from every part of the Common'
wealth and Empire, while millions
outside Westminster Abbey will
hear the promises and prayers be'
ing offered up within its walls. I
want you all to pray for me on
that day, to pray that God may
give me wisdom and strength to
carry out the solemn promises I
shall be making and that I may
faithfully serve Him, and you, all
the days of my life.”
That, then, is the essential cen'
tral feature of the Coronation ac'
cording to our British tradition.
It is not the conferring or assump'
tion of temporal power over
many millions of subjects but the
voluntary dedication by a young
and beautiful woman, wife and
mother, of the rest of her life to
the service of those same people.
The Coronation ceremony,
then, has something in it of the
days of chivalry when knights
dedicated themselves to a cause,
or of the ordination service for
the clergy. It originates with the
mystic'minded Saxon king, Ed'
ward the Confessor, who drew
his inspiration from the anointing
of the first Hebrew king, Saul, by
Samuel the prophet. There are
even some today who hold to a
tradition of a link between these
two kings.
By contrast with the British
tradition the accepted practice in
the case of many of the former
European kingdoms was for the
new king to crown himself, to
place his crown on his own head,
and thus to assume his new auth'
ority.
After the Coronation comes
the pageantry and the public ex'
pression of loyalty by a selected
group of subjects. Only Britain
can now produce such scenes in
all their glory and these have at'
tracted many thousands of spect'
ators from all over the world who
owe no allegiance to Queen
Elizabeth 11.
The materialistically'mi nd e d
might question whether the great
expense of the Coronation is jus'
tified- However the Queen her'
self has to meet heavy expenses
from her own resources while

ROYAL FAMILY TREE.
Queen Elizabeth 11. and Prince Phillip both descend from Queen Victoria, and through her their common lineage goes back to
the earliest rulers of the great country of which the Queen is now Monarch. This Royal Family Tree indicates the relationship
of Her Majesty and Prince Phillip to each other and to other members of the Royal Family. Prince Louis, of Battenberg, the
great British admiral to whose foresight the state of preparedness of the British Navy in 1914 is usually attributed, at King
George V.'s request discontinued the use, style, and title of "Serene Highness" and "Prince" and appellation of "Batten-
berg in 1917 and assumed for himself and his descendants the surname of Montbatten. He was the father of Admiral Earl
Montbatten, and grandfather of the Duke of Edinburgh, the Consort of Queen Elizabeth 11.

public expenditure is offset by the
heavy spending by overseas visit'
ors. The whole cost is a mere
bagatelle in comparison with the
cost of a short period of a war,
that colossal waste that is brought
about by men with a wholly ma'
terialistic outlook.
The Coronation is, fundament'
ally, something in the realm of
the spirit which cannot be meas'
ured by material standards. The
world forgets, for a brief moment
the chronic uneasiness under
which it has laboured for years,
We are reminded that there are
things that are greater than all
these anxieties, things that are
real and lasting, conferred on
mankind by its Creator.
The Queen has asked for our
prayers. Who would withhold
these —and much more, in affec'
tionate tribute to her own exemp'
lary character and personality as
w-ell as to the exalted office to
which she has been called.
The Queen’s dedication of her
own self implies an invitation to
all her right'minded subjects to
follow her example and to do
likewise. The world is in great
need of unselfish service and there
will always be abundant oppor'
tunity if we only can forget, at
least occasionally, our own indu
vidual inclinations and desires.
Finally, to use a metaphor from
the building field, a new cement
grouting of loyalty and affection
has been applied to the fabric of
the British Commonwealth which
can now look forward to a still
more glorious record. To plan
and work for this is the offer of
fealty we can all make to our be'
loved Queen Elisabeth the
Second.
ROUND THE WORLD IN
TWO DAYS
By Comet Airliners.
Sir Miles Thomas, chairman of
8.0.A.C., declares that the Comet 11.
will be the first airliner to be able
to fly at between 8 and 10 miles high
for long periods. First delivery will
be in next August.
But, he pointed out, much research
is still necessary into high speed
winds and “jet streams” at those high
altitudes. Very little was known about
meteorological conditions thus high
over the North Atlantic and a careful
study was necessary before a trans'
Atlantic Comet service can be intro'
duced.
Another investigation to be under'
taken when the Avon'engined Comets
are available will be of round'the'
world stratosphere routes. Later still,
when the British Britannia was in
8.0.A.C. operation, a global service
of 2 days was envisaged. The route
would be London, Edmonton, Tokio,
Calcutta or Hong Kong, Beirut, Lon'

CONCRETE CONSTRUCTIONS PTY. LTD.
One of the most interesting indus-
trial projects to be completed in Syd-
ney for some time is the new plant
of International Harvester Co. of
Australia Pty. Ltd. at Lidcombe,
Sydney.
In its design the building has been
reduced to its fundamental essentials —
space enclosed by a minimum of solid
walls and supports and a maximum of
glass so that it possesses an appear-
ance of lightness and grace that is
very attractive.
Although there is no aim at sym-
metry or repetition between ground
and first floor fenestration, and there
is also a great change in scale between
the large unbroken glass areas below
and the more subdivided windows
above, the excellent handling of the
proportions produce harmony and
balance. The free use of colour is also
stimulating.
Huge Showroom.
The project consists of two main
buildings. Both these units have two-
storeyed reinforced concrete sections
facing Parramatta Road with single-
storeyed factory type structures at the
rear. The principal building nearest
to Parramatta Road has, in the two-
storeyed section, a ground floor show-
room, 120 ft. x 60ft., enclosed on three
sides with plateglass in which are dis-
played all the various trucks, tractors
and agricultural machinery produced
by the company.
Spare parts may also be purchased
at the rear of this showroom, and the
remainder of the ground floor is oc-
cupied by a service s ation and spare
parts storage shelving.
The upper floor is taken up entire'
ly with general office, private offices,
conference room and air'conditioning
equipment room. A feature is the
glass wall across the 120 ft. long
southern wall which allows a high de'
gree of light penetration, enabling
office work to be carried out at desks
50ft. away without use of artificial
light for most daylight conditions.

upper floor, a dining-room and kitchen
which occupy the whole area, space
having been allowed for recreation,
ping-pong tables, etc. This dining-
room has a similar southern wall of
glass to the office block with remark-
ably good light penetration. The
whole of the tower floor of this build-
ing, including the sawtooth sections at
rear, is for the assembly of new vehicles
and the bulk storage of parts.
The main offices are fully air-
conditioned and fluorescent lighting
has been used throughout showroom,
offices, conference room and dining-
room.
The grounds have been carefully
laid out to provide ample parking
space for visitors and executives, while
there is also a large metalled area at
the rear where trucks and other
mobile equipment may be stored pend-

COMFORT IN THE KITCHEN.

The kitchen is the room in the
house that requires the most ventila-
tion and there are times when the at-
mosphere is heavy and there is no
breeze when natural ventilation just
doesn’t do the iob. This is when
the B.G.E. domestic kitchen exhaust
fan comes into its own for at the
touch of a switch this neat and effi-
cient little unit springs into life and
cooking fumes and steam are extract-
ed at the rate of 25,500 cu. ft. per

NEW FLEET FOR QUEEN.
British warships numbering 191
were on view at the Coronation Re'
view at Spithead. This was nearly
50 more than were present at the
last review in 1937. But in those
days the tonnage of the Fleet was
heavier.
Nine battleships and two battle'
cruisers were present on that occasion,
among them the ilhfated “Hood” and
“Repulse.” All five of the aircraft'
carriers present in 1937 were sunk
during the war, as were most of the
seventV'odd cruisers and destroyers.
Thus the 1953 Fleet consists of prac'
tically new ships.
Seventeen nations were represented
at the 1937 review, including the Rus'
sians and the Germans.
The Japs, sent a new cruiser. So
secretive were they about this vessel
that to protect her from prying eyes
they shrouded much of her with can'
vas. Strange, is it not, that they can
accept the good grace of the British
invitation to view her fleet, but screen
her own from all eyes. Even their
own Ambassador complained that he
was not allowed to see over the ship!
To-day the Taps, have no navy be'
yond a few patrol boats.
HOW BRITONS SPENT.
Every £1 the British people spent
last year went this way —on average—-
according to a Government estimate —
Food, 6/3d., drink and tobacco, 3/2d.,
rent, rates, fuel and light, 2/4d.,
clothes, 1/1 Id., household goods,
l/4d., and other goods and services,
SA.
[Ed. But if a landlord depends on
his property for an income—it goes
something like this: for every £1 cob
lected in rent, he pays 25/' in the £l
for taxation and then he lives on noth'
• ing at all. Property cannot be sold in
England for the simple reason that
people will not be saddled with repairs.
The landlords must do that for them.
That is why the government has to
foot the bill for the supply of houses
and why people have to live in tiny
cottages such as no one ever accepted
before and still pays more in rental
than ever before. 1

Just recently the firm did the whole of the Electrical and Switchboard installation at

undertaken by this firm such as the electrical installations at the new Enfield plant
of Larke Hoskins & Co., and the new building for the University of Technology at
Kensington. They have just recently completed the boiler control wiring for the
two new 50,000 kilowatt generating plant at Pyrmont Power Station for Interna-
tional Combustion (Australia) Ltd.
They made and installed the Reichel Automatic Fire Alarm system at the Uni-

U.S. RAILROAD and BUS TERMINALS
POST-WAR PLANNING EARNS DIVIDENDS.
COMFORT, SERVICE, EFFICIENCY, IS KEYNOTE.
Since the end of World War 11. a new and mightier America has been
rapidly taking form on the drawing board of engineers and architects.
In step with the enormous internal development of the nation, the
future of rail, ’bus, and air transportation is being sketched in dramatic
strokes in keeping with vast industrial and commercial progress, for
the Blueprints of today will become the bustling, hustling United
States of tomorrow.
Perhaps the greatest single advance-
ment America has made is in these
three fields of transportation.
The capable, far-seeing chief execu-
tives engaged in these fields, engin-
eers, architects and technical men,
have already done a magnificent job
in bringing fast, safe, efficient tran-
sport to the American people.
The U.S.A., at the end of 1946,
had about 29% of the total rail-
road mileage of the world, although
America has less than 6% of either
the land or population.
There is more railroad line in the
United States than in any other coun-
try—more than all of South America,
Asia, Africa and Australia combined.
Since many lines have more than one
track and all of them have sidings and
yards, there are almost twice as many
miles of track as there are of route.
It is interesting to note that most
railroads in the U.S.A. are private-
ly-owned, and the only examples of
railroads owned and operated by the
Federal Government are the Panama
Railroad and the Alaska Railroad,
which are roads more for Government
strategic use than for use by the gen-
eral public and therefore private en-
terprise could see no point in owning
them.
Outside the U.S.A. considerably
more than half of the railroad mileage
of the world is under government
ownership and operation. (In 1947
Great Britain under a labour govern-
ment nationalised her transport sys-
tem, resulting in a steady deterioration
of the standards of safety and service
as well as financial losses that govern-
ment-owned services usually incur. 1
Under private ownership, America’s
unequalled transcontinental railway
systems have made remarkable and
spectacular progress.
In the post-war years, the railroads
have embarked upon an extensive sta-
tion modernisation and building pro-
gramme.
Some of the tremendous rebuilding
and renovating projects have trans-
formed the stations into the most mod-
ern and up-to-date terminals in the
world.
Los Angeles Passenger
Terminal.
This magnificent project was com-
pleted on May 7, 1939. Its construc-
tion was based on a division of own-
ership costs by three railroads on a
proportional use scale, viz., Union
Pacific, 23%; Sante Fe, 33%; and
Southern Pacific, 44%.
This Union Terminal is an archi-
tectural gem in the Mediterranean
style. The structural units of the sta-
tion proper have an overall frontage
BUILT-IN PARCEL LOCKERS.
Part of a "streamlined" service in a modern American 'bus station with flowers
to gladden the scene. If we saw flowers on any of our stations we would just stand
and stare. We have not even got round to having a 'bus terminal, and by the
time we get one we might even "acclimatise" ourselves to seeing flowers as an
extra attraction. However, profits are made from these parcel Auto-Lockers and that
may account for this charming presentation of rendering service with beauty and
good grace.
ON THE CONCOURSE OF A LARGE RAILWAY STATION.
Arranged like the inside of a library these Auto-Lockers bring parcel checking to the
passengers by enabling them to select their lockers in locations near to their traffic
lanes. Travellers are invariably in such a hurry that there is only time to catch
their train "by the skin of their teeth" so that anything that will enable them to
lodge their luggage without having to walk a mile to the luggage room, wait in a
queue, wait for a receipt and all that, would be a great boon to regulars. In
America 30,000,000 people have been using these since 1943—and they are a
paying proposition.

of 860 ft., and a set-back of 200 ft.
provides a broad expanse, artistically
landscaped, ornamentally lighted, and
given over to parking areas, walks,
and driveways.
The station group comprises many
different buildings of varying sizes,
shapes and heights, each being a sep-
arate and independent structural unit,
yet so designed as to present a homo-
geneous appearance.
Within the station everything has
been done to provide the maximum
convenience for passengers and tran-
sients. The arrangement of public fa-
cilities —which includes banks of Aut-
omatic Luggage Lockers* —produces a
feeling of spacious freedom and effi-
ciency.
Washington Union Station.
One of the outstanding features of
this station is its close conformity of
design to the government buildings
of this Capital City. Its imposing
white stone facade draws attention to
the six fluted columns topped by six
equally imposing statues above the
main entrance.
A spacious plaza serving as a hub
for the wide streets running into it
fronts the station. When the city of
Washington remodelled this plaza,
motor traffic was co-ordinated to give
a minimum of interference to the sta-
tion cabs. Passengers are unloaded
directly in front of the main entrance
while the loading is done at a series
of covered platforms at the west end
of the station.
It is interesting to note that infor-
mation facilities operate on a 24-hour
basis, and employ 124 clerks, to
supply general as well as train infor-
mation to the public.
Self-service Parcel Checking Lock-
ers, 1232 in number, are strategically
and conveniently situated on the
Train Concourse, Ticket Lobby, Mam
Waiting Room, entrance to Women’s
Room, and the passageway between the
concourse and ticket lobby.
Pennsylvania Station, New York.
This world-famous station is the
gateway to the South and West for
New York and the New England
States.
It is a vast transportation hub in
the centre of bustling Manhattan Is-
land, providing the metropolis with di-
rect train services over lines leaving
New York like the spokes of a wheel
to Washington and points in the
South as distant as Miami and New
Orleans; to Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Norfolk, Pittsburgh, Cincannati, Louis-
ville, St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit,
Cleveland, and Montreal, Canada.
Built after the Roman Doric style,
and opened on September 8, 1910,
the Station occupies eight acres, and
has three levels; train platform, exit
concourse and main concourse. There
are 21 tracks in the station, located
40 feet below street level.
The dignified design of the main
Waiting Room, fully adapted to mod-
ern ideas, was suggested by the great
halls and basilicas of Rome, notably
the baths of Caracalla, Titus, and Dio-
cletian. Adjoining the huge open
train concourse, the walls of the wait-
ing room are 108 ft. wide and 105 ft.
high.
The Long Island concourse of the
station has undergone extensive im-
provements. The walls in this area
are of structural glass.
Over 2500 Self-service Parcel
Checking Lockers are located through-
out the entire station along the lines
of heaviest traffic.
Pennsylvania Station, Philadelphia,
Thjs maenificent station (comp i et .
ed March 12 1933) is on the West
bank of the Schuylkill River.
Of Grecian architecture in lime-
stone, the station serves both through
and suburban trains. It covers an area
of 208,953 sq. ft., with a maximum
height of 116 ft. It is served by the
city’s subway system and a unique
innovation is the spacious roof de-
signed to permit the landing of heli-
copters,
The main Passenger Station is of
steel and concrete construction, and is
faced with Alabama marble.
In the east and west elevations, cen-
trally located, are porticoes 150 ft.
wide and 70 ft. deep. Impressive

HUNDREDS OF LOCKERS IN RAIL TERMINALS. U.S.A.
All over the world one becomes so accustomed to seeing Railway Stations full of
drabness that it is refreshing to see a concourse free, like this, from every indication
of grime. Here is an American scene where hundreds of Auto-Lockers are in constant
use during peak traffic where there is plenty of speed but no confusion. What to
do with one's luggage when travelling has ever been a problem which America
has solved by introducing the hired locker, in much about the same way as the
Post Offices hire out their boxes. Each renter is given his own exclusive locker.
Our Government might find installations such as these a money spinner. America
has—but our Government wants "money spinners" even more than America.
BUS TERMINAL INSTALLATION OR RECESSED LOCKERS.
At a poll taken at 18 railway and 'bus terminals in U.S.A. as to reasons why Auto-
Lockers were preferred, 90% voted for convenience, speed, privacy, safety, novelty
and habit but only 10% voted for economy. Every possible improvement has been
made to these safety gadgets—even colour to brighten up the scene "at a truly
enormous expense it was said. But it was also stated that "improvements always pay."

Corinthian columns, lift, in diameter
and 71ft. high, dominate the east and
west facades.
The main concourse is a rectangular
area, 290 ft. long by 135 ft. wide and
95ft. to the flat coffered ceiling, which
is decorated in red, gold and cream
colours. With a preponderance of
red, the ceiling lends a great deal of
beauty to the room.
The smaller public areas are in
keeping with the scheme of the main
concourse, and include many cabinets
of Self-service Parcels Lockers
throughout the area.
For Greater Efficiency.
These four examples of modernisa-
tion of public facilities by large rail-
road companies, were selected at ran-
dom from a recent volume on “Rail-
road and Bus Terminal and Station
Layout.”
Space does not permit further quot-
ing of instances where station build-
ings were adequate in size, but which
needed the magic wand of freshness,
brightness, and the availability of mod-
ern equipment “to create the desir-
able atmosphere of comfort, hospital-
ity,-and a sincere desire to assist the
traveller.”
However, the railroad companies
are pushing full steam ahead with the
building, renovation, or modernisation
of hundreds of smaller, between-term-
inal stations. In many cases, this will
result in a complete transformation
both as to arrangement of management
public facilities and decorative finish.
As a leading U.S. railroad execu-
tive recently said: “Our passenger
stations are undergoing such a com-
plete overhaul that all of the interior
and part of the exterior bears only a
slight resemblance to their former
selves.
Bus Terminals.
In some parts of U.S.A. Railroad
and Bus Stations operate under one
roof as important adjuncts to each
other —not at each other’s throats as
in Australia. Although they may have
different owners they still work ami-
cably together and one is not taxed
off the face of the earth in order that
the other may indulge in riotous ex-
travagances.
In most large American cities and
towns Super Terminals have been
built by Bus Lines, and underline the
enormous growth and expansion of
this form of comfortable, convenient
travel.
The “Grand Central” of the bus
world is Washington’s Super Grey'
hound Terminal.
Representing an investment in land
and buildings of nearly $1,000,000
(£A. 446,000), this great travel centre
is a landmark in the construction and
operation of bus terminals.
It is built of Indiana limestone. It
is fire-proof, air-conditioned, and in-
corporates every modern facility com-
patible with the need for proper effi-
ciency and a satisfied customer.
The building is an island type unit.
Its entire structural system, including
walls, foundations, floors, beams, con-
course, platform, and bus driveway, is
of reinforced concrete design. The
only structural steel is for the round
columns which support the concrete
AMERICAN RAILROADS.
Principal Trunk-line Railroads of the U.S.A., reaching from Seattle. San Francisco, and Los Angeles in the West, to Boston,
New York and Washington in the East. This vast network of privately-owned and operated railroads makes travel a mem-
orable experience. Being run by private enterprise they are efficient, clean and reasonable in cartage costs and tares,
and out of all that they pay handsome dividends. In 1950 after declaring taxes at 1,212,000,000 dollars they declared
348,000,000 dollars dividends from a net operating income of 1,055,000,000 dollars and a net income of 854,000,000 dollars.
How much more sensible it is for governments to allow private enterprise to function and have such a huge rake-ott in taxa-
tion than tor the government to run services and only get losses tor their pains such as we are doing at present in N.b.W.

3300 sq. ft. and is very attractively
finished, with information booth,
ticket office and rest rooms adjoining.
Some 300 Parcel Checking Lockers
are provided on either side of the
ticket windows, and near all bus en-
trances and exits.
This Super Terminal is one of the
most outstanding examples in motor
transport progress the world has yet
witnessed. It has undoubtedly mark-
ed the opening of a new era in the de-
sign, construction, and function of
Bus Terminals in the U.S. and else-
where.
From this detailed survey of rail-
road and bus station design one salient
fact emerges:
• The entire layout, location and
installation of all facilities, considera-
tion of passenger convenience and
comfort, and managerial efficiency of
American rail and bus terminals is a
striking example of the future aims
and ideas of these forms of transport-
ation.
Little Advancement in Australia.
In the Commonwealth, where rail-
ways are Government -owned and op-
erated, little advancement in regard
to service has been seen in recent
years. The Governments appear to
be content with their well-known
“near - enough - is - good - enough”
policy, and do little to inculcate rail-
way employees with any ideals of ser-
vice, although just recently a new
ticket office, opened at Sydney Sta-
tion, would indicate that some one is
starting to move and is aspiring to
better, cleaner and more artistic rooms
and appointments. There is a great
deal of room for improvement in all
forms of our national transport—be it
rail, road, air or sea.
The most striking illustration of
this is our shocking lack of consider-
ate —we almost said decent —facilities
for travellers.
For instance, no Australian capital
city possesses an off-the-street bus
terminal for embarking passengers.
In Sydney—already congrested—
Martin Place is used as a picking-up
place for passengers; in Melbourne
it is Lonsdale Street, near Myers.
Even Airways buses disgorge passeng-
ers on to Sydney footpaths while in-
terminable arguments rage as to
whether the old Exhibition Building,
now doomed to demolition, could not
have beeen made into a Combined
Airways Terminal.
Meanwhile, the finest building in
Sydney for that purpose, a huge wool
store facing the Quay, stands empty.
A further service which railway and
airways authorities appear to have
overlooked, in this writer’s opinion,
is the installation of such an excellent
public facility as coin-operated Par-
cels Lockers.
These lockers are wonderful rev-
enue-earners in other parts of the
world, and are considered an integral
part of any station or terminal.
To date, the N.S.W. Government
Railways has shown great enterprise
in installing a cabinet of luggage lock-
ers, which are available for hire at a
charge of 6d. a day. Three sizes of
lockers are to be found at Central
Station; smallest in the top row;
medium in the centre row, and largest
at floor level, to save lifting heavy
bags.
This leadership on the part of the
N.S.W. Railways is evidence of its
desire to provide every possible amen-
ity for travellers. The railway auth-
orities of other States, profiting by
N.S.W.’s precepts and example, will
no doubt promptly follow.
This has happened in Canada and
U.S.A. to the undoubted advantage of
travellers. That it will happen here
is, we sincerely believe, a foregone
conclusion.
New Move for National Housing Loan
CO-OPERATIVE BUILDING SOCIETIES PLAN.
The Association of Co-operative
Building Societies have a plan for or-
ganising national housing loans to fi-
nance wide-scale home building in Aus-
tralia. Of course the Federal Gov-
ernment is to be asked to do the fi-
nancing of part of it.
More than 12,000 applicants are on
their waiting lists for money to build
new homes. A similar position exists
in Victoria.
The Societies want a series of hous-
ing loans over ten years and repay-
ment of loans into a national pool
which would become self-supporting
and would finance future housing.
It sounds easy to everyone except-
ing those who have to provide the
money, if it comes through govern-
ment channels, viz;., the taxpayer.
Surely they are taxed heavily enough
and often ask the question “why
should the diligent among us be tax-
ed so heavily as to provide even homes
for the not-so-diligent, or less ambi-
tious and less assiduous worker?”
Again the point arises what right
has the Government to turn itself into
a Monte-de-Piete? If it provides loans
for this industry it should provide
loans for any and every industry when
requested.
All the Government has to do to
straighten things out is to abolish the
Fair Rents Court and let Private En-
terprise take over. This enterprise
closed its doors when the Fair Rents
Court opened its doors. Before then
anyone could rent a house cheaply and
in any suburb.
The rapid flow of the Nile waters
would not know how to “burst their
banks,” compared to the flow that
buildings would take, if they could
only be released from all the absurd
Government laws, rules and regula-
tions that are retarding the building
and engineering development of this
country. They have singled these in'
dustries out for a fierce and vicious
strangulation.
800 employees on the Housing
Commission's staff would swallow up
in salaries £BOO,OOO annually, even if
they only received a little more than
City Council Sweepers so that
<£1,000,000 a year would not be over-
estimating this annual expenditure. In
addition there would be rents of of-
fices everywhere, cleaning, lighting,
etc., as well as fares all over the
place so that their inspectors could
keep their weather eye on all the
people they feel they cannot trust to
do a conscientious job.
If private enterprise did this work
each builder would practically “live
on the job in terms of working hours”
to see that no money would be wasted
and the job would be well done. His
reputation would be at stake and that
is just what a builder guards with all
his might and main.

SANDRINGHAM GARDENS, HYDE PARK, SYDNEY
MEMORIAL GARDEN TO KING GEORGE VI.
In 1951 the City Council decided
to develop a section of Hyde Park,
Sydney—formerly occupied by a band
rotunda and adjacent to the site where
the British Centre stood during the
war years—to provide a sunken garden
o commemorate the proposed visit of
Their Majesties King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth and Princess
Margaret during April, 1952.
Following the tragic death of the
King, it was decided that the garden
be named “Sandringham Garden” in
remembrance of King George VI. It
was completed last November at a
cost of <£lo,ooo and opened by the
Lord Mayor, Aid. E. C. O’Dea, M.L.C.
Sunken Garden and Reflection
Pool.
The garden covers an area of about
200 feet square and in the centre is a
30ft. diameter reflection pool sur'
rounded by terraced gardens and
broad flights of steps forming a circular
sunken garden a hundred feet in
diameter.
This sunken garden is enclosed at
the back by timber and stone per'
golas and lattice and by a heavy plant'
ing of trees and shrubs to close the
vista and form a background and set'
ting for the main garden. About a
thousand trees and shrubs will be
planted in addition to those already
existing, and as they grow it will be
necessary to remove some and re'
locate others, but close planting is
necessary at the beginning to provide
a well'furnished background and to
provide shelter to each other. Quick
growing, short lived trees like our
wattles are very useful in this way,
acting as parents to the slow'growing
but more permanent specimens. The
area in front of the sunken garden has
been laid out with paths and formal
garden beds, the planting of the two
beds in the immediate foreground
being set out in geometric patterns of
circles and rectangles.
Charming Stonework.
The stonework of the garden is an
outstanding feature. The welhknown
Sydney sandstone has been used with
pieces of granite, marble and old hand'
made sandstock bricks to provide a
variation of material and colour. The
stonework is of squared random,
irregular in the sizes of stones and
without regularity of courses. Inciden'
tally, some of the stone was removed
from the old Darlinghurst Gaol build'
ing, now the East Sydney Technical
College, and reused in this garden.
Careful Drainage.
The site consists generally of hard
shale and, although shale forms a good
foundation for paths and walls, it
would be a very unhappy choice for
garden or lawn beds. These beds were
excavated to about 2ft. deep, agricuh
ture drains were laid and the beds
partly filled with soil, heavily manured
with old stable manure and filled with
sandy loam and compost. The subse'
quent heavy rains, although delaying
completion and upsetting planting ar'
rangements, provided a very severe
test of the drainage, which has proved
exceptionally good for the beds could
be dug almost immediately after heavy
showers.
Whilst all this work was going on,
the nurseries were busy—seeds plant'
ed, seedlings pricked out into boxes,
grown on in frames and hardened off
in the open air in readiness to take
their places in the garden—and about
8000 seedlings were used. Shrubs,
trees and vines were also being grown
in tins and pots and receiving special
care.
The paths are constructed of decom'
posed dolarite stone, somewhat like
tennis court loam in appearance, and
with brown gravel lightly sprinkled
on top, providing a path pleasant to
the eye and soft to the tread.
Seasonal Displays.
Mr. C. Garth, Director of Parks,
said that considerable planting has
already been done chiefly of Ranunculi,
Pansies, Nemesias, Neirembergias and
Alvssum, but that does not finish the
work of nurseries, for they must start
again to provide more seedlings for
the summer and autumn displays.
There will be two main seasonal plant'
ings of annuals—Spring and Summer.
In addition, many flowers will be
grown in pots in the nursery and
placed in the garden when in flower to
avoid the period of waiting between
the seedling and flowering stages.
Much use will be made of the old
hardy annuals such as Phlox and
Petunias —at which so much criticism
has been levelled from time to time
but, nevertheless, most useful when
labour and costs are considered.
Special displays will, however, be

made of Daffodils, Iris, Hyacinths,
Hydrangea, Fuschias and other flowers
grown in pots to maturity.
Climbing Plants
on Pergolas.
The pergolas and lattice of stained
hardwood supported by sandstone piers
will be furnished with climbing plants
which will include the Wistaria, that
purple haze of spring; Bignonia
Venusta, the orange splash of winter;
the Rhyncospermum, the white per'
fumed flowers of autumn; the Thum'
bergias, the orange of summer, and
the dainty pink Antignon of late sum'
mer (February). The Monstero De'
liciosa, the tropical plant with its large
shining perforated leaves, will be used
to provide contrast to other plantings.
The surrounding planting includes
many native trees and shrubs the
Wattles, Christmas Trees, Geraldton
Wax, Bottle Brush and others —and
these have been grouped to provide
clumps of colour throughout the year.
But now, time must play its part,
for only the start has been made and
although there will be the seasonal
displays of flowers, years must pass
before the trees and shrubs, timber
and stone reach maturity, until the
effects of sun, wind and rain remove
the gloss of newness and add the meh
lowness of age.
Here, in one of the world’s busiest
cities, one will be able to escape from
the bustle and worry of city life and
rest in peaceful surroundings of sun'
light and shadow to enjoy the beauty
of lawns, trees and flowers and the
skvline of buildings silhouetted against
cloud and sky a place of rest and
beauty and a memorial fitting to a
great and much'loved King.
PROPOSED JOINT MEMORIAL
To King George V and King George
VI.
The N.S.W. State Government has
commissioned Mr. Lyndon Dadswell,
sculptor, and Dr. Henrik Epstein,
architect, of Sydney, to design a
memorial to King George V and King
George VI for Sandringham Gardens.
The Premier, Mr. J. J. Cahill, said
that “the Government contributed
£3OOO some years ago and the other
£3OOO was raised by public subscrip'
tion. The Government feels that the
gardens are the most appropriate place
for a memorial for both kings. We
hope to have it finished in time for
the Royal Visit in 1954.’’
IMPROVED STANDARD
FOR HOTEL BATHROOMS
Urged by Victorian Master Plumbers’
Association.
The Master Plumbers’ Association
of Victoria propose to urge the Licem
sing Court not to renew the licences
for hotels which have below standard
bathrooms and toilet conveniences.
They claim that the condition of some
bathrooms in many city and country
hotels is an insult to guests and a
disgrace to the management.
The Association intends to prepare
suggested standards for hotel bath'
rooms and conveniences, and a ratio
of bathrooms to bedrooms, and it will
suggest to the Licensing Court that it
should adopt these standards.
ALUMINIUM ROOFING.
The Aluminium Roofing Company
of Melbourne is now successfully
pioneering a new development in
metal roofing. This consists of a
buildup membrane of layers of alu'
minium foil set in hot bitumen.
This composite material provides a
permanent waterproof barrier and the
high reflectivity of the metal surface
cuts the temperature of the roof by a*
much as 60 degrees Fahrenheit in com'
parison with that of a normal bitU'
menous felt membrane, and can thus
considerably reduce interior summer
temperatures.
The American National Bureau of
Standards gives a single layer of the
foil used a life expectancy of 25 to 45
years.

THE VICTORIA PARK SWIMMING POOL
AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING.
Project to Cost £102,958.
The site selected for the pool and
its associated wading pool and build-
ings that is to be erected by the City
Council within Victoria Park, Sydney,
is just below the University grounds.
The existing ornamental lake near the
corner of City Road and Parramatta
Road will remain undisturbed.
The building which will be susk
into the hill and have a flat roof so
as to cause as little obstruction as pos-
sible to views across the Park, will be
curved to suit the existing contours
of the land and the wading pool will
be segmental in shape in a position
immediately in front of the building.
The scheme will have suitable land-
scape gardening both around it and
within the concourse area and as it
is designed primarily for “picnic pleas-
ure” rather than for racing, the aim
has been to enable the maximum num-
ber of people practicable to make use
of the facilities without absorbing too
much of the Park. With this end in
view only one low diving board is to
be included and comparatively shallow
water (i.e.. from 3’ 3” deep) will
extend as far as possible because divers
and swimmers require more area of
the pool to themselves than do people
who are satisfied to “cool off” in hot
weather and have a moderate amount
of swimming during heavy attendance
days.
The project is to have open , view
fencing to enclose the concourse, the
main pool and the “toddlers” pool,
the activities within the pools thus
being visible to people in the park
outside.
On the coloured concrete concourse
there will be seats and tables under
brightly coloured beach umbrellas and
sunbakers will have the use of gently
sloping painted timber ramps of Swed-
ish type.
The dressing rooms will be partly
open to the sky to obtain the benefic-
ial effects of sunshine and to provide
the natural ventilation so desirable in
rooms of that sort. The machine
room will be underground to house
the reticulation purification plant.
The main pool is to be 165’ x 55’
the length being 50 metres, i.e., Olym-
pic standard, and three widths to one
lap of the length. Both pools are to
be tiled and underwater and overhead
electric lighting will be available for
night bathing.
During heavy bathing loads spark-
ling clear water will be slpplied at the
rate of 320,000 gallons every four
hours. The standards of purity and
clarity to be applied will be those re-
commended by the American Public
Health Association and will result in
water for swimming equal to or better
than is usually used for drinking.
The City Council has approved the
acceptance of the tender submitted by
John Grant & Sons Pty. Ltd. of
£102,958, this being the lowest sub-
mitted for a stone-faced building.
EASING THE LANDLORD S
BURDEN.
The U.K. Society of Housing Man-
agers has taken a practical way out of
the tenant versus landlord wrangle.
They are preparing simple instructions
on how to do interior decorating.
Many thousands of tenants may be
called upon to do simple repairs about
their premises if rents are to be kept
down, for in Britain alone the costs of
such work have risen up to 300%
compared with pre-war.
In Britain, as in Australia, the ten-
ant just leaves all repairs to the land-
lord. But the unfortunate rent-con-
trolled landlord has an almost impos-
sible task when faced with budgeting
for indoor and outdoor repairs, and
general maintenance.
Put bluntly, it is a case of “Put
Rents Up —or Let Houses Fall
Down!”
In Australia our government is tell-
ing people how to lay foundations;
we presume ju§t in case the architect
left this item out of his specification.

TIMBER DEVELOPMENT
Excerpts from the I4th Annual Report of Mr. N. K. Wallis, President of the
Timber Development Association, delivered on the 11th June, 1953.
Timber Home Publicity.
It is gratifying to be able to state
that the intensified publicity campaign,
embarked upon during 1952, has ob-
viously created a mounting interest in
the many uses of timber. Especially
is this so in home building. Contin-
uous publicity in this important field
has resulted in such an increase in the
demand for information about timber
and timber homes, that in time the
volume of enquiries became too great
for our staff to handle, and conse-
quently our advertising and radio an-
nouncements have had to be curtailed.
Proof of achievement and the suc-
cess of T.D.A. publicitv is not always
obvious or easy to establish. The ef-
forts are slowly, but steadily, cumula-
tive. However, building statistics for
the years 1948 to 1952, as compiled
by the Commonwealth Statistician, in-
dicate that the well-designed timber
home, as sponsored by this Associa-
tion during the past decade, is con-
tinuing to increase in popularity in
N.S.W.
A comparison of the figures for
newly-completed dwellings in 1952,
as compared with 1948, show an in-
crease in the number of brick houses
of 11%, of fibre houses 30%, and of
timber houses the striking increase of
134%. I am certain that at last the
real value of timber as a home build-
ing material is being properly recog-
nised.
Information Distributed.
Approximately 9,300 “Timber
Home” booklets were forwarded by
mail (45% to country areas) in ad-
dition to pamphlets and -information
sheets, such as finishing treatments,
construction methods, availability of
species, treatment of wood pests.
There were approximately 7,300
visitors to the showroom, an average
of 30 per day.
The material for “Pixie Cottage,”
for the Children’s Hospital at Collaroy
was donated by Merchant Members.
Timber Handbook,
The final draft of the “Australian
Timber Handbook,” a 400-page text
book on Australian timber practice,
specially written for T.D.A., has been
completed. Thanks are due to the
South Australian Branch of the T.D.
A. for their co-operation and financial
assistance.
The “Young Bucks.”
During the year, junior executives
of the industry—calling themselves
“The Young Bucks”—joined togeth-
er in arranging some entertaining and
instructive gatherings.
General.
Lectures have been given to busi-
ness men’s organisations; addresses to
municipal and shire councils in city
and country; radio broadcasts; the
combating of adverse press publicity,
and the loaning and screening of films
both for members and for various suit-
able institutions.

ing of the Association the following
were elected to the Council:
President: N. K. Wallis.

E. A. Primrose, A. H. Sargeant,
I. Wightmap.
Mr. A. Houghton was elected on
the 29th July to fill a vacancy on the
Council.
Timber Supplies.
During the year, although steep in-
creases occurred in costs of wages and
plant, the industry absorbed much of
these additional costs in order to
keep prices as attractive as possible.
In practically all cases both local and
imported timbers used in home con-
struction were reduced in price.
Merchantable hardwood dropped from
143/- to 127/6 per 100 s. ft.: mer-
chantable Oregon from 191/- to
170/-, and baltic from 189/6 to
155/- per 100 s. ft.
However, the reduction of prices
cannot go on indefinitely. In the case
of hardwood the local industry is al-
ready carrying the basic wage increases
of the last 14 months.
It is hoped that in 1953 the Com-
monwealth Government will see its
way clear to revive the present life-
less building industry. Credit restric-
tions have done their job in stabilis-
ing our internal economy, and now a
steady financial transfusion is impera-
tive, particularly in housing where the
tremendous backlog could lead to un-
stable social conditions in our com-
munity.
Some indication of the effect of
credit and import restrictions upon the
trade is clearly indicated in the tables
set out in the Appendix to this report.
These tables compare N.S.W. log
production, and the imports and ex-
ports for 1952 with the boom year,
1951.

show that log imports contracted from
approximately 14,000,000 s. ft. to
8,000,000 s. ft. in 1952. Imports of
sawn and dressed timber dropped
sharply, the former from approximate-
ly 164,000,000 to 91,000,000 in
1952, and the latter from approximate-
ly 22,000,000 to 11,000,000 s. ft. in
1952.
In regard to plywood and veneer,
imports for 1952 were approximate-
ly, in both cases, 50% of the 1951
figure. The quantity of plywood for
1952 was approximately 13,000,000
sq. ft. in comparison to 25,000,000
sq. ft. for 1951. and that of veneers
approximately 9,000,000 sq. ft. com-
pared with 18,000,000 sq. ft. in
1951.
Box shocks although declining
were steady at a low figure.
In view of the large reduction in
both local production and imports,
any obvious increase in demand would
in a short time create a scarcity of
timber. It is hoped that the Govern-
ment will give the trade adequate
warning of its intentions and the full-
est co-operation in order to organise
future supplies of this essential ma-
terial.
Exports.
Reduced demand in Australia has
stimulated the local sawmilling indus-
try to seek additional markets oxer-
seas, and a certain amount of success
has been attained.
Log exports increased by approxi-
mately 6,000,000 s. ft. on the 1951
figure—mainly to New Zealand.
Railway sleeper exports to New Zea-
land increased by approximately
37,000. An exceptionally sharp rise
took place in sawn timber exports
from approximately 6,000,000 s. ft.
to 16,000,000 s. ft. Whereas exports
of plywood increased slightly from ap-
proximately 58,000 sq. ft. to 76,000
sq. ft., veneer exports decreased, pri'
marily due to smaller orders from the
United Kingdom.
Dressed timber shows an improve-
ment of approximately 28,000 s. ft.
mainly to New Guinea.
Death of T.D.A. Director—
Mr. C. O. T. Lembke.
The sad loss sustained by the As-
sociation and the community in the
death on 17th May of our late di-
rector, Mr. Conrad O. T. Lembke,
was recorded.
Log Production in N.S.W. (in Thousand Super Feet)
Imports From Overseas Into N. S. W.
Dressed Timber (super feet)
Mr. Lembke, together with other
members of the N.S.W. timber trade
was one of the original founders of
the T.D.A. in 1938. He was a mem'
ber of the council up to 1942, then
Acting Director, and finally Director
in 1944. His loyalty to T.D.A. ob'
jectives was unswerving; he furthered
the cause of timber with steady sin'
cerity of purpose, and in this he was
supported by a wide technical know'
ledge. As Editor of the Australian
Timber Journal, Conrad Lembke was
known to timber men throughout
Australia, and they will share in the
sense of loss the industry has suffered.
Appointment of Assistant
Director.
Mr. E. Colin Davis, as Assistant
Director of T.D.A. brings to his post
a. wide .experience in Public Relations.
Appreciation.
Thanks were accorded for close co-
operation received from Common'
wealth and State Organisations and
Trade Associations for their valuable
assistance in promoting the objects
of our Association.
Close contact has been maintained
with the T.D.A. of the United King'
dom. Their co-operation, especially
in relation to our Timber Handbook,
has been most helpful.
“To our Treasurer and Secretary,
Mr. J. J. Jefferson and Mr. E. L.
Symes, we are indebted for another
year of honorary service. We are for-
tunate in having their valued assist'
ance, and their work is greatly appre-
dated,” continued the report.

“To Mr. Conrad Lembke, Jnr., I
wish to extend special appreciation,
not only of his work during the year,
but also of the manner in which he
has helped overcome the difficulties
which have confronted your Council
as a result of his father’s illness and
death. Despite the extra work
thrown upon him during the last six
months, Conrad, fnr., has found time
to assist your Association on every
occasion and in every possible way.”
Future of T.D.A.
“Your Council has given a great
deal of thought to the future organis'
ation and activity of T.D.A. A close
study of trends in almost every aspect
of our industry reveals successful in'
roads by timber substitutes, not neces'
sarily, we are convinced, upon their
merits, but certainly because of unre'
lenting publicity. In the fields of
light and heavy construction, office
furniture and fittings, shelving, house
fittings and sheathing and many others
competing materials, backed by
thoughtful sales campaign, has made
substantial, even alarming progress.
We are watchful of these develop'
ments, but more support is necessary
if we are to impress successfully upon
the public, the merits and the right'
ful usage of timber in its legitimate
field.
“On the other hand, intensive re'
search has opened very many new av'
enues for our project, especially a
new confidence in timber and its scien'
tific usage. Kiln seasoning, immun'
isation, timber connectors, laminated
construction, improved wood, advances
in plywood technique, and, indeed,
the whole realm of wood technology,
have, even within the last decade,
placed timber far ahead of its former,
but still commanding, position as a
universal commodity. It is for us to
back the technologists to the hilt, to
capitalise on their valuable work and
bring timber in its proper sphere,
forcefully to the notice of every po'
tential user.
“To do this, however, T.D.A. must
have the wholehearted support of the
entire industry, in whose interests
your Association is working, and will
continue to work, with singleness of
purpose. I appeal, therefore, to every
timberman to put back into this great
industry something of that which he
has derived from it, whether it be in
thought, in enthusiasm or in practical
support through the T.D.A.
“If you will all do this, we can,
in the spirit of these times, regard
the future as a new era in timber—
or perhaps, in the words of Egon
Glesinger, as the Coming Age of
Wood.
I commend this thought and this
spirit to our great industry.”

Illuminating Engineering Society of Aust.-N.S.W.
Report of General Meeting of The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia,
held at the G.U.0.0.F. Building, 147 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on Thursday,
4th June, 1953, at 7.30 p.m.
The President, Mr. G. C. T. Brown,
extended a hearty welcome to the 92
visitors and members present, with
particular reference to the President,
Vice-President, and members of the
Electrical Contractors’ Association. He
further added that as an electrical con-
tractor himself, he felt quite at home
in their company. The President said
that he had been very pleased to note
that ope of Sydney’s eminent electrical
contractors, Mr. C. Roy Nilsson, had
been included in Her Majesty the
Queen’s coronation honours with the
award of the 0.8. E.
The minutes of the General meet-
ing held on the 7th May, 1953, were
taken as read and confirmed.
Report from Council.
The President presented the follow-
ing report from Council.

The Council has accepted an in-
vitation from the*lnstitute of Optome-
trists of N.S.W. to participate in a
joint meeting with the members of
that body on Wednesday, 26th August,
1953.
Meritorious Lighting Award.
Further conditions in regard to the
Award for Commercial Lighting were
announced as follows:
(1) That the lighting installations
eligible for the Award be limit-
ed to the Counties of Cumber-
land and Northumberland.
(2) That installations completed in
the five years ending 30th
June. 1953, be eligible.
(3) That photographs or drawings,
together with description, must
be submitted with the entry,
and that the area in which the
installation was situated must
be specified (e.g., the particular
section or department, and loca-
tion -within the store or build-
ing).
(4) That Messrs. Forbes, Hyatt
and Mainwaring be added to
the Jury.
Visit to Tivoli Theatre.
The President reminded members
of the arrangements to visit the Tivoli
Theatre on the evenings of the 9th,
11th, 16th, and 18th June at 5.30
o’clock. Members intended to be
present at these visits were asked to
notify the Secretary’s Office, without
delay, as requested in the circular post-
ed earlier in the week.
Subject for the Evening.
The subject for the evening was en-
titled “Modern Trends for Lighting
Installations” and took the form of
two papers delivered by Messrs. G. Y.
Falk and W, A. Smith.
Vote of Thanks
In moving the vote of thanks, Mr.
B. Deegan observed that the scope of
the papers, which covered lighting
practice from the days of the oil lamp
to the present day. when lighting can
be bought by the foot, contained a
wealth of information. Great strides
had been made during the last few
years even in incandescent lighting, as
evidenced in the growing popularity
of reflector bulb lamps. He also men-
tioned that the reduced bulb and
krypton-filled lamps might shortly be
available in Australia. The new and
revised lighting codes at present under
review are very interesting and should
prove beneficial to the community in
general.
Mr. Deegan said that Mr. Smith’s
description of the colours of various
fluorescent lamps had been a revela-
tion, and had clearly shown the need
for some simplification in colour ter-
minology as applied to fluorescent
lamps. He observed, however, that
coloured fluorescent lighting or any
form of coloured lighting, must be
considered in conjunction with the
colours of the surrounding surfaces.
The vote of thanks was seconded
by Mr. H. Chadwick, who said that it
was interesting to note that the first
electric lamps had been made and were
in use before the first electric gene-
rator had been built. He mentioned
in particular the Savoy Theatre, Lon-
don, which had been fitted with bat-
tery operated electric lamps prior to
the construction of an electric gene-
rator. Mr. Chadwick also emphasised
the effects of glare and the need for
correct positioning and application of
light. The new codes should greatly
assist in this direction, and they should
be carefully studied and used by both
electrical contractors and lighting en-
gineers.
The vote of thanks was carried by
acclamation.
Discussion.
Mr. R. J. Wiles, President of the
Electrical Contractors’ Association,
thanked Mr. G. G. T. Brown for his
words of welcome at the opening of
the meeting, and desired to convey the
appreciation of the Committee and
members of the Electrical Contractors’
Association to The Illuminating Em
gineering Society for making it pos-
sible Tor them to hear the papers pre-
sented. This was the first occasion,
Mr. Wiles said, that such a meeting
had been held, and he hoped that it
would be the forerunner of many
more. The interchange of views be-
tween the two organisations would
assist each to render a better service
to the community. The common in-
terest of the new codes could provide
a basis for a closer liaison between the
two organisations, and he assured Mr.
Brown of full co-operation in this
direction.
The President, Mr. G. C. T. Brown,
thanked Mr. Wiles for his remarks and
expressed full agreement with him.
The proposed liaison with the Elec-
trical Contractors’ Association would
be discussed at the next Council
Meeting of the Society.
Mr. Burgess asked Mr. Smith the
principle of the operation of the hot-
cathode fluorescent dimming equip-
ment.
Mr. Smith explained that the circuit
had been developed from the instant
start circuit which employed a cathode
heating transformer to provide a con-
tinuous current through the lamp
cathodes. By maintaining a constant
voltage across the lamp, and varying
the current through it over a range
from 450 milliamps to 3 milliamps,
the dimming effect was achieved,
Mr. Underwood asked Mr. Smith
about the' possibilities of using fluores-
cent lamps on low voltage direct cur-
rent.
Mr. Smith said that such use was
possible, and had been done in Aus-
tralia. Very little work of this nature
had been carried out overeas, largely
because geographical conditions were
such that no large populated areas
were situated at remote distances from
normal electric supply systems. The
two problems, said Mr. Smith, asso-
ciated with low voltage D.C. operation
were, firstly, the transformation of the
current by means of a vibrator and,
secondly, the cleaning-up of the re-

sultant wave form. Very careful de-
sign was necessary to obtain satisfac-
tory circuits, and such factors as the
large variation in battery voltage be-
tween re-charging operations must be
considered.
Mr. Muller asked Mr. Smith the
value of the resistance of the ballast
lamps used with instant start fluores-
cent circuits.
Mr. Smith said the resistance was
316 ohms.
Mr. Hudson-Shaw, referring to the
table of permissible brightness shown
bv Mr. Falk, asked if the reflection
factors of surrounding areas had been
taken into account.
Mr. Falk explained that the revised
code was very comprehensive and
would require a special night to dis-
cuss fully. The particular table which
he had shown as an example referred
specifically to the use of bare fluores-
cent tubes, viewed from one particular
direction in rooms of specified dimen-
sions.
Trends in Modern Lighting installations
By GERALD Y. FALK,
M.I.E.S. (Aust.)*
Amongst the very earliest impres'
sions of man in those far-off stone age
days was the consciousness of light
and darkness. Thus we find amongst
the traces of ancient civilisations the
tools for banishing darkness.
Among the world’s treasures are the
beautiful oil lamps discovered during
the excavations at Ur-of-the-Chaldeese
in Mesopotamia. These lamps date
back as far as 4000 B.C. These oil
lamps and improved models were used
for giving light for nearly 5000 years
of our civilisation until the develop-
ment of the candle made from natural
oils and fats took us into the 19th cen-
tury, when dawned the possibility of
the ultimate defeat of darkness by
economic artificial means.
Figure 1 shows two silver oil lamps
of Queen Shub-ad, one of the
Sumarian queens who ruled in 3500
B.C. These lamps were used during
the lifetime of the owners and were
placed in the coffins of the departed
to light their way on their journey to
the next world. The oil was placed
in the vessels and wicks were laid in
the lip of the shallow type or in the
small spout. It has just been dis-
covered that the oil used was X-100.
Figue 2 shows a beautiful lamp
made of solid gold which is in an ex-
cellent state of preservation and of
exquisite craftsmanship. These lamps
would have become very handy dur-
ing our recent blackouts and I am
sure that similar types were made by
many of our citizens in this 20th cen-
tury.
And even in recent times we have
progressed from the inefficient carbon
lamps, gaslight, vacuum and argon-
filled lamps, coiled coil filaments to
mercury discharge and fluorescent
lamps. Such advance has been made
in recent years in the development of
these light sources that now the pro'
vision of artificial light in almost any
reasonable quantity and quality is a
practicable and economic reality.
Our design and application has also
made giant strides, and fresh in our
memories are the primitive installations
of bare lamps, “chinamen’s hats,”
pulleys and counterweights filled with
lead shot, which cluttered up our
offices and homes. These have given
way to functional devices to harmonise
with out architectural and interior
decoration.
The improvements in light sources
and fitting design require increased
responsibilities from the people into
whose hands has been placed the
worthy task of bringing to every per'
son the right of having good lighting
available for his daily visual task and
for his leisure hours.
The electrical contractor’s import'
ance and influence in the acceptance
by the general public of modern light'
ing is a well'founded fact. Light is
finally produced by the connection of
assembled components and parts to an
installation of cables and wires con'
nected to the electrical supply. All of
these functions are carried out by the
modern electrical contractor.
The trends for future lighting in'
stallations will call for greater technical
and mechanical skill of the electrical
mechanic.
In my talk I will give a brief out'
line of present lighting applications;
what aids are at our disposal to im-
plement the standard lighting codes;
what we can expect in the future, and
at what standards we should aim to ad'
vance our lighting quantities and quali'
ties.
Mr. Smith in his section will deal
with the theories of new fluorescent
circuits and colour application.
We can expect influence from over-
seas developments to effect us in some
degree, but the bulk of the influence
will arise from our own efforts in im-
plementing our basic standards as set
down by our own Australian lighting
codes. These codes are the Standards
Association of Australia code for the
Interior Illumination of Buildings and
the Domestic Lighting Code.
From the revised S.A.A. code we
find that the foot candle levels of il'
lumination are being raised and more
prominent attention is being directed
to brightness.

values of illumination for typical tasks
for adequate seeing conditions. Class
No. 1 is for tasks with minute detail
and poor contrast. Examples where
200 ft. candles or more would be re-
quired is in hospital operating theatres
and city store show windows. Class
2 would be for precision work requir-
ing a high degree of accuracy such as
fine engraving. Class 3 would be for
severe and prolonged visual tasks such
as very fine drawing and sewing on
very dark goods. Class 4is for mode-
rated critical and prolonged tasks and
would be required for seeing in class-
rooms and fine machine work. Class
5 would cover ordinary visual tasks
such as office work and ordinary bench
work. Class 6 is for less exacting
visual tasks such as large assembly,
whilst Class 7 would be for illumina-
tion in passages and spaces other than
work areas.
Figure 4 is a simple aid to deter-
mine the allowable brightness for
general diffusing fittings and fluores-
cent fittings when viewed at right
angles to the main axis. It is a com-
pletely new departure from any code
in the world and will have very far-
reaching effects on improving our
visual conditions. Owing to our in-
creased illumination levels made pos-
sible by more economic means of pro-
ducing light, the problem of bright-
ness is becoming more prominent. It
is no longer sufficient to pour on the
lumens, and illuminating engineering
is rapidly becoming the science of
brightness engineering. By the use of
this table it is possible to ascertain
the brightness of the fitting required
for a room of any dimension and any
mounting height. It will be seen that
for a small room, for example, a room
12ft. x 20ft., allowable brightness
would be 3000 ft. candles owing to
the fitting being well out of the nor-
mal visual range; whilst in large rooms,
for example, a room 70ft. x 55ft., a
low brightness would be necessary,
since a large number of fittings would
be in the normal line of vision.
As a guide, the brightness of various
light sources are as follows: the sun
has a brightness of approximately
500,000,000 foot-lamberts. the candle
has a brightness of approximately 3000
foot-lamberts, a 60-watt pearl lamp has
a brightness of 27,000 foot-lamberts,
whilst a 40-watt fluorescent lamp has
a brightness of approximately 2000
foot-lamberts.
It can be seen that bare fluorescent
lamps could be used for dimensions
of rooms falling into class f and g,
whilst for all other sources of light
and other classes —a, b, c and d—some
diffusing cover would be required to
reduce the surface brightness of the
fitting.
The Committee responsible for the
drawing-up of this table are to be con-
gratulated for a very fine contribution
to lighting progress.
Amongst other new departures from
the old code is an interesting addition
of tables, showing the permissible
brightness of fittings.
A great stride forward has been
made in Australia by the introduction
of the S.A.A. domestic lighting code
which, it is hoped, will be issued in
the near future as an interim series to
enable it to be used and opened to
public critical review before the final
draft is printed.
The scope of the work is to estab-
lish “standards to the amount and
quality of illumination required to en-
sure easy and comfortable seeing con-
ditions in the home.” It is pleasing
to note that the code points out that
early co-operation between architect
and lighing engineer is essential to
ensure suitable placement of fixed fit-
tings and provision of adequate elec-
trical wiring aj\ d outlets. The code is
not over-ambitious in the minimum
quality of light required for various
tasks.
Some emphasis is placed on the
problem of brightness without involv-
ing the use of the code into the per-
plexities of Professor Logan or the
American glare rating system of Harris
and Meaker.
Simple tables are available for all
rooms of the house, and the sizes of
suitable glass-enclosed units are also
shown.
Figure 5 is an example of the many
fine tables available in the new domes-
tic code and shows the size of fitting
and the size of lamp for rooms in the
home.
The above examples are only a few
of the guides that are contained in

BUILDING: LIGHTING: ENGINEERING


Figure 7 is a decent development
known as a Rotterdam ceiling and is
gaining prominence on the Continent.
It consists of a wooden framework
suspended below a dark blue ceiling,
in the centre of each square is an out-
let connecting a lighting unit. The
lighting units can be placed in any of
the squares in accordance with the lay'
out of the store. Its advantage is that
the ceiling hides pipes and ducts and
is flexible if any change in store lay'
out is made. The adaption of the
above is now gaining favour in Eng'
land.
The fight for good lighting is being
steadily founded on winning points
and with the proper knowledge of
where to direct our steps and the
adoption of recommended standards
and with the proper equipment the
lighting engineer and the electrical
contractor can finish the good work
of bringing the joy of better seeing
conditions in all our daily under'
takings.
I believe that only with well'
informed electrical contractors insist'
ing on good standards of illumination
can we progress and develop our light'
ing in all sections of the industrial,
commercial and the residential life of
the Auslralian community.
the code, but it gives us a clear in'
dication that our standards are being
raised in accordance with the greater
knowledge now available of all the
factors governing good visual seeing
conditions.
Modern lighting installations are
mainly built up around fluorescent
lamps or tubing or in conjunction
with incandescent lamps. The use of
fluorescent lamps in modern industry
is almost a complete victory, whilst
commerce, shops and offices are rapid'
lv being converted. The only fields
that have not yet felt the impact of
the newest light sources are the domes'
tic and residential fields. The lamps
available for the fluorescent applica'
tions range from 9in. to sft. bi'pin
hot cathode lamps, and in cold cathode
replaceable pin type tubing is avail'
able from 4ft. to Bft. Circline fluores' -
cent lamps with its highly decorative
value has been available in small quam
tities and has its own appeal for those
looking for a more conventional ap'
pearance.
Figure 6 shows the krypton lamp,
which has an efficiency 30% higher
than that of the single coil lamp and
10% higher than the coiled coil argon'
filled lamp. The bulb on the left is
the size of a 15'watt standard lamp,
and it will be noted that the lamp on
the right'hand side, which is a kryp'
ton lamp, has a compactness which
can only be achieved when krypton
gas is used as the filling instead of
argon.
Some criticism of the lack of suit'
able designs of local fittings would be
justified, but I fail to see that even
overseas designers have made available
anything very outstanding for massed'
produced fittings. An advantage of
our more conservative approach to
lighting fitting design is that we are
able to benefit not only from the more
advanced overseas progress, but also
from their mistakes. This should
prove less costly to the Australian
public, as only well'tried and trusted
designs survive the test of time and
can be modified for Australian prac'
tical use. In step with the work of
the S.A.A. Code Committees, our
manufacturers are moving ahead with
equipment for modern lighting. The
trend in the residential field is the use
of pelmets and ready'made equipment
for the housing of fluorescent lamps.
Some excellent work has been done
with plastic and to make a break from
metal, wood and wood fibres have
been used. Spun aluminium fittings
in various coloured finishes are an ex'
cellent addition to the field of sup'
plementary lighting. Excellent
dramatic effects are obtained, but good
visual conditions of a room could be
endangered if the general illumination
is not taken into account. Typical
examples of recent trends here and
overseas of good lighting practice will
give us a clue as to where our de-
signers and lighting engineers will be
guiding the future of the lighting in'
dustrv in Australia.
The Colour Rendering
Properties of Lamps
By W. A. SMITH*
Once upon a time life was very
simple both for the lighting engineer
and the electrical contractor. We had
cosv things called lamps and they
came to us in cartons labelled 25
Watts, 40, 60, 100, 150 and 200
Watts. If we had a factory lighting
job to do then we used lamps which
were labelled 300 and 500 Watts.
Factory lighting equipment almost in'
variably consisted of vitreous enamel'
led dispersive reflectors, whilst for of'
fices and stores we had glass diffusing
units, the most modern of which were
affectionately known as “frosted foot'
balls.” All the lighting engineer had
to do was to push his slide rule and
the answer was the number of lamps
required to light a given floor area,
and he would put spots over a plan of
the building to indicate where the fit'
were to go. If it was a domestic
installation the lighting engineer was
never bothered, the contractor wired
an outlet to the centre of every ceil'
inor and the owner of the house went
along to her local store and selected
nice threedight pendants which the
contractor duly installed.

The Fluorescent Lamp.
Into this idyllic situation was sud'
denlv thrust the fluorescent lamp, and
at first there was great excitement.
The lighting engineers’ dream of a
large area source of low brightness
with a colour approaching that of day'
light had at last come true.
The early lamps were somewhat op'
timistically labelled “daylight,” and
although we had achieved by artificial
means a light source which was nearer
in colour to natural daylight than the
incandescent lamp, our womenfolk
soon found out that these lamps play'
ed havoc with their appearance, and
so, although the new lamps were ac'
ceptable in the factory where appear'
ances did not matter so much, they
were not acceptable in the office and
store —and certainly not in the home.
It was a fair criticism, and the lamp
physicist soon got busy and produced
a new colour which became known as
“warm'white.” This had a much bet'
ter effect on complexions and make'
up, the blue had been taken out of
the original daylight lamp and some
red put into it.
And then things really started, be'
cause if the physicist could juggle
with the fluorescent powders and pro'
duce a new colour warm white -
then he could produce all sorts of
other colours, too. But the confusing
part about it was that physicists in
different laboratories in different parts
of the world were all doing the same
thing and it was left pretty well to
the Publicity Departments of the
various lamp companies to think up
names for the spate of new colours
which followed, and it was not long
before a study of the lamp literature
of the world showed that a veritable
hydra had been born. From the
original lamp no fewer than fifteen
different white lamps appeared to have
been produced. These were: North'
light, Daylight 6500° K, Daylight
4500°K White 4500°K, Cool White,
De'Luxe Cool White, Natural, Natural
Daylight, White 3500°K, Warm
White, De'Luxe Warm White, Warm
Tint, Warm Tone, Mellow and Peach.
Fifteen Different Types.
But to make confusion worse con'
founded we find that in actual fact
there are not fifteen dicerent types of
lamp at all, because different lamp
manufacturers have called the same
lamp by different names, and in some
cases they have called different lamps
by the same name. We find that
what one calls Northlight another calls
Daylight 6500°K. That the Daylight
of one is the White 4500°K of
another, the Cool White of a third
and the Natural of a fourth. Warm
White, Warm Tint and Warm Tone
are much of a muchness, whilst Mel'
low and Peach are pretty well the
same thing. De'Luxe Cool White and
De'Luxe Warm White have the same
surface colour appearance as standard
Cool White and standard Warm
White, but have different colour rem
dering properties but neither of
these De'Luxe lamps have yet appear'
ed in Australia.
So our list of fifteen lamps really
boils down to five, all of which are
degrees of white, but all of which dif'
fer markedly in their colour rendering
properties—that is, the way in which
they lend appearance to coloured sur'
faces.
As a rough guide, the five types of
lamps are characterised as follows:
Northlight or Daylight 6500°K is a
cold bluish white light, Daylight
4500°K or White 4500°K and its near
equivalents, Natural and Natural Day'
light, are lamps which have a crisp
white appearance, White 3500°K is
white with a tinge of yellow about it.
Warm white is quite pinky, and Mel'
low and Peach have a high red con'
tent which gives a light the colour of
which is roughly the same as candle
light.
In the pre'fluorescent days we were
not overmuch bothered with questions
of colour. We did know that high
wattage lamps gave a whiter light than
did low wattage lamps, but that was
something that never entered into our
considerations when designing a light'
ing system. The ladies were conscious
of the distorting effect of incandescent
light on the colour of fabrics and >n
consequence would take fabrics into
the street in order to examine their
colour properties under natural light'
mg conditions. Some stories would in'
stall elaborate colour'matching units
as a substitute for natural light, but
generally speaking the colour of light
and its effect on surroundings was not
given serious attention if only because
there was nothing that could be done
about it.
Two Basic Tyoes
of Atmosphere.
Nevertheless, people are conditioned
to two basic types of atmosphere. A
cool neutral atmosphere is required in
the work world the factory, office
and school whilst in the home and
in other social environments the re'
quirement is for a warmer atmosphere,
and for physical and mental welhbeing
it should be the aim of the lighting
engineer to provide these basic atmos'
pheres. '
During the last few years we have
learned, too, that neutral surfaces do
not necessarily provide the correct eiv
vironment, whether it is a working
one or a social one. Certain colours
are stimulating—the reds and yellows
—whilst others are restful and relax'
ing—cool greens and pale blues, for
example. We have begun to use
coloured surfaces in schools, offices
and even factories; the old combina'
tions of creams and green or crearan
and brown are giving place to care*3
fully thought out colour schemes fore
walls, floors and furnishings. Ther
battleship grey of machinery is giving:
place to gaily'coloured parts. Outc
homes no longer have neutral wallsl!
and dark furnishings but are lively!
with colour.
All this has made the lighting prob-d
lems very acute, because the nature 010
the illuminant will determine the ap-q
pearance of a coloured surface.:
Hence, not only has the advent of the:
fluorescent lamp enabled us to have ®
choice of illuminants all of whicH:
render colours differently, but a choice:
of illuminants is of vital necessity ifr
we are to apply lighting successfully!
to the modern interior. But before:
we can make this successful applica-fi
tion. we have to know not only whats
effect the colour of the incident lightr
will have on the colours of materials.al
but also what effect any particular
fluorescent lamp will have.
Natural Daylight Conditions.
The naturalness of a coloured sur-:
face under artificial lighting conditioner
is usually referred—even unconscious-a,
ly— to its appearance under naturak
daylight conditions. In other words.al
when appraising a colour we do soc
with our minds referring it to a stan*n
dard white, which is Daylight. There:
is, however, no such colour as whiter
daylight which appears white is s
compound of all the colours of ther
spectrum ranging from violet at oner
end to red at the other, all the colours:
being mixed in certain proportions to)
produce what we call white.
Now surfaces appear coloured by'
virtue of the colour of the light whicH:
they reflect; for example, a red sur-:
face will appear red when illuminated):
by white light because all the colours:
of the spectrum are being absorbed):
except red, which is reflected back tod
our eyes. If, however, the same sur-:
face is illuminated by a light which!:
does not contain red, then there canu
be no reflection, only absorption, ano:
the surface will appear dark. A piece:
of red material, for example, illu-u
minated by pure green will appears
black, the same material illuminated::
by blue light will appear purple.
Range of Whites.
The range of whites represented byr
five basic fluorescent lamps may alih
appear to be white, but they are:
characterised by the amounts of red*b
dish light or bluish light which they:
emit. Northlight has a predominance:
of blue in its emitted light, hence:
bluish surfaces will appear quite vivid.b
but reds will appear brownish or purp-q
lish depending on the type of red:
which is being illuminated. Comm-
plexions appear pallid and lips ap-q
pear purple, hence this lamp is quiton
unsuitable for domestic use or anyr

location where colour rendering is of
importance. On the other hand, it is
an admirable lamp for industrial use
and it has colour properties which
make it the most suitable lamp for
seeing tasks which involve the dis-
crimination of fine detail. It has also
an important application in colour
matching .that is, where we are con-
cerned not with the absolute colour
of a material but have to discriminate
between or match together two sur-
faces which are similar in colour.
The Daylight 4500°K is the one
which has the best all-round colour
rendering properties, whilst providing
a cool crisp atmosphere compatible
with natural daylight. With the ex-
ception of very deep reds the lamp
will give colour results which are as
close to natural lighting conditions as
it is possible to get with an artificial
light source. Hence this lamp is the
one to use for store lighting where
overall colour rendition is of great im-
portance. Complexions appear fresh
and natural under this lamp, but be-
cause of its rather invigorating ap-
pearance it is not suitable for a social
atmosphere.
The White 3500°K is a good white
colour with a tinge of yellow in it,
some blues and some reds are not
rendered entirely satisfactorily, but it
has two advantages, firstly, it is the
most efficient of the fluorescent lamps
and, secondly, because it has a slightly
warm appearance it is a very accept-
able colour for such places as offices
where a large number of women are
employed.
Warm White gives a good appear-
ance to complexions, but the pinkish
character of the light sometimes re-
sults in an undesirable tinted atmos-
phere. However, this is a charac-
teristic which can be of advantage in
such places as hairdressing salons,
beauty parlors and so forth, where
often the decoration is deliberately
ninkish in order to simulate a warm
exotic atmosphere. It is a suitable
lamp, too, for homes and other social
environments.
Peach and Mellow have a high pro-
portion of red and, therefore, provide
a really warm atmosphere. Its colour
rendering properties are poor, especial-
ly as far as the blues and greens are
concerned. It is a lamp to use in the
home, restaurant and so forth and in
those locations where one is trying to
bring out the red content of surfaces.
It flatters complexions—and is admir-
able for butchers’ shops. Used with
discrimination it is very successful, but
it should not be used to provide high
levels of illumination or to light large
general areas.
Summing up, therefore, we can take
as a rough guide the fact that the
fluorescent lamp is correctly applied if
we use Northlight in industry, Day-
light 4500°K for shops and stores,
White 3500°K for offices, Warm
White, Peace and Mellow for homes,
restaurants and other places of social
activity. This is only a rough guide
and frequently we find that in order
to correctly light an interior as far as
colour rendition is concerned more
than one type of illuminant is neces-
sary. But we have .to be careful
Colours mutually affect each other
when viewed simultaneously, hence,
as a general rule, it is unwise to mix
two different types of fluorescent lamp
in the one fitting. Although the re-
sultant colour mix may be satisfactory,
the appearance of the fitting will be
poor owing to this phenomenon which
we call simultaneous contrast. For
example, Northlight and Daylight
when viewed together result in the
Northlight lamp appearing much more
blue and the Daylight lamp much
more red than they really are. It was
for this reason that the de-luxe lamps
were developed first in America and
then in Europe. The pairs of lamps—-
de-luxe cool white and standard cool
white, and de-luxe warm white and
standard warm white, render colours
differently, but their surface colour ap-
pearance is identical, therefore they
can be used in the same fitting to
provide a colour mix without there
being any change in their appearance.
Nor should the humble incandescent
lamp be forgotten when the question
of colour rendering is important, in-
candescent lamps have still a part to
nlay in lighting practice, especially in
store lighting, where they are used in
conjunction with fluorescent not only
to provide colour properties which are
not always possible with fluorescent
lamps alone, but the new reflector
spotlight can be used to emphasise
special features of the display or to
provide modelling, thereby avoiding
a flat appearance which purely general
fluorescent light sometimes provides.
The Design of Control Gear.
The fluorescent lamp is still a very
young light source and, consequently,
the lamp and everything associated
with it is still in the course of de-
velopment. Whilst the lamp physicist
has been busy improving the proper-
ties of the lamp as regards colour
rendering, light out-put, and main-
tenance of high lumen output during
life, the designers of the associated
control gear have also been examining
existing circuits and devising new
ones which would make the lamp more
reliable, more flexible and, if possible,
result in a reduction in cost.
That there has not been more spec-
tacular developments in control gear
circuits is due to a large extent to the
greatly improved performance of
lamps on existing circuits and to the
fact that none of the practical circuits
so far examined effect any reduction
in first cost, so that even after fifteen
years the general purpose starter
switch circuit seems to still reign
supreme.
The function of the choke in the
lamp circuit is to provide the lamp
with its correct starting current, cor'
rect running current and correct vol-
tage; any choke which fails to provide
the correct operating conditions as
laid down by the lamp physicist will
result in incorrect performance of the
lamp. The function of the starter
switch is to provide in conjunction
with the choke a high voltage tran'
sient across the lamp at a predeter'
mined moment and as soon as the
cathodes have reached their correct
operating temperature. This high vol-
tage transient can be obtained by
means other than that of a somewhat
crude switch, but any method adopted
which results in high voltage starting
without adequate pre'heating of the
lamp cathodes results in a serious re'
duction of the life of the lamp.
The Starter Switch.
It is unquestionable, however, that
the starter switch as an auxiliary in the
lamp circuit is unsatisfactory, and most
work on auxiliaries which has been
carried out in the laboratories of the
world has been towards the creation
of circuits which would eliminate this
particular component.
Interest in England and Australia
has centred mainly around the so'
called Quickstart circuit which, ah
though a starterless circuit, does also
provide pre'heating of cathodes before
the arc is struck. The circuit consists
of a transformer with a pair of secon'
daries which provides constant voltage
across the lamp filaments. Circuit con-
ditions are so arranged that the
cathodes are heated to their correct
operating temperature before the main
discharge takes place and so this cir-
cuit does not effect lamp life in the
way that cold starting does.
Now, with this particular type of
circuit, there are certain conditions
which have to be fulfilled if the lamp
is to be completely reliable in starting,
once the arc has struck the lamp func-
tions as any normal pre-heat circuit.
The essential point is that there is no
high voltage transient for starting as
there is when a starter switch operates,
hence means have to be found for
coaxing the arc to strike at mains
voltage. This is done by providing
an earth in close proximity to the
lamp and extending along its whole
length. Generally speaking, if the
lamp is in an earthed metal fitting,
the back channel will act as the earthed
strip. The earthed strip and the lamp
act as a condenser, there is a capaci-

tive current to earth from the ends of
the lamp which cause ionisation of
the lamp to be extended from the
region adjacent to the electrodes along
the lamp until the whole length is
conductive and the discharge can
strike from end to end.
Surface Resistance
of the Lamp.
Another factor of importance with
this type of circuit is that the con-
dition of the surface of the lamp has
a considerable bearing on lamp start-
ing. We find that there is a very im-
portant relationship between the sur-
face resistance of the lamp and strik-
ing voltage, if the surface resistance
lies between certain values then the
lamp will not strike. Now surface re-
sistance is conditioned by the humidity
of the atmosphere and hence the strik-
ing voltage becomes a function of the
humidity. With relative humidity be-
low sixty per cent, striking voltage is
normal, but as the humidity increases
so does the voltage required to initiate
the discharge and at ninety per cent,
the striking voltage is 175% of nor-
mal. There are two ways of dealing
with this problem: one is to reduce
the surface resistance below the critical
value by a metal strip which is in
direct contact with the lamp at all
points along its length, and the other
is to make use of the properties of
silicons which repel moisture and
which by breaking up the water vapour
into droplets increases the surface re-
sistance to some value above the
critical value. In this case the water
repellent compound is deposited on to
the glass of the tube. It is indestruc-
tible and transparent and does not
wear off during the life of the lamp.
Both these methods are used in prac-
tical lamps and both work equally
satisfactorily.
Quickstart Circuits.
It is found in practice that these
Quickstart circuits will function with-
out earthing systems and without the
modified lamps which have just been
mentioned, but their operation cannot
be considered to be reliable, and at
the present state of knowledge of these
circuits it is wise to be a little wary
of extravagant claims for starterless
gear which do not take into considera-
tion the limitations of such circuits.
Another practical circuit eliminates
both the starter switch and the choke.
The choke acts as a current limiting
device as well as providing by virtue
of a collapsing magnetic field a high
voltage transient the starter
switch opens. If the starter switch is
eliminated then the second function
of the choke is also eliminated, and the
current limiting activity of the choke
can be carried out by some piece of
apparatus which is less costly. A
straightforward resistance will do equal-
Iy well—as it does on D.C. circuits—
but as a resistance does no useful
work except absorb Watts and get
hot the obvious thing to do is to use
a filament lamp for the purpose which,
whilst it, too, absorbs watts at least
provides some light as well. With
such a circuit there is no pre-heating
of cathodes by conventional means,
so the lamp is re-designed, single con-
tact caps are used with short circuited
cathodes, and for starting there is a
starting strip inside the lamp which
functions in a similar way to the start-
ing mechanism of the H.P. mercury
vapour lamp.
In circuit design we have had, ever
since the fluorescent lamp was pro-
duced, the aim to eliminate the starter
switch; this has been done, but what
we have not done is thereby to reduce
the overall cost of the control gear,
or even to make the circuit simpler.
With the cathode transformer method
the overall efficiency of the circuit is
not impaired and remains as high as
with the starter switch circuit, but the
initial cost of the transformer is higher
than that of a starter switch and
socket. With the ballast lamp circuit
the initial cost of the equipment is
lower than that of conventional com-
ponents, but special lamps have to be
used and the efficiency of the system
is only about half of that using con-
ventional gear. This lower efficiency
is obvious as the power consumed by
the filament lamp ballast is about the
same as that of the fluorescent lamp
itself. Hence a decision as to the most
suitable equipment to use in any given
location must take into account a num-
ber of factors. One has to weigh up
the higher cost of Quickstart gear
against the elimination of a possible
cause of trouble due to premature
failure of the starter switch, and the
undoubted boon of instant starting as
compared with the inevitable few
seconds’ delay whilst the starter switch
operates. There is the lower first cost
of instant starting with a lamp ballast
to be offset against the necessity of
using special lamps and the low over-
all efficiency of the system which
means more fittings to light a given
area as compared with the lamps
operated from conventional gear.
Many other circuits have been de-
vised in the laboratories of the world,
some successful; others have not yet
reached the stage where they can with
confidence be put on the market. The
two that I have described are practical
but both are relatively new to this
country and both will have their ad-
herents. My own view is that once
a circuit has passed the laboratory
stage and has been proved reliable it
is worthy of serious attention. All
such circuits have a place in lighting
installations, they all have advantages
and disadvantages and these should be
frankly admitted. We have not yet
reached finality in ballast design and
until we do we should be cautious of
extravagant claims as to the merits of
this or that circuit, but at the same
ime let us welcome new circuits and
judge them and install them on their
own merits.
There is one other circuit I should
like to demonstrate to you and this
represents one of the most interesting
advances in the design of control gear
for the fluorescent lamp.
Inability to Dim.
It has been considered for many
years that a serious limitation of the
fluorescent lamp was its inability to be
dimmed in the way that incandescent
lamps can be dimmed. However, a
new circuit has been devised which
by controlling the current through the
lamn enables the brightness to be con-
trolled from full-up right down to
zero.
This circuit was developed in Eng-
land and during the Festival of Britain
much of the colour changing flood-
lighting systems were fluorescent tubes
operated from this dimming circuit.
The circuit has also been used success-
fully in Great Britain for stage lighting
where footlights and cyclorama light-
ing has been entirely from fluorescent
lamps.
The possibilities of this dimming
circuit are tremendous and it is an
example of how wary we should be of
being dogmatic about the future of
fluorescent lamp circuits, as so often
what we have thought could not be
done has eventually been achieved.
The fluorescent lamp and its associated
control gear has still a long way to
go before finality is achieved in its
design and operation.
SUPERSONIC MISSILES.
A deadly supersonic missile to pro-
tect American cities against air attack
is now available.
It is the “NIKE,” a radar directed
weapon capable of speeds up to 1,500
miles per hour and is said to be al-
most impossible to miss, once it has
located its target. Its record in tests
totalled 65 “kills” out of 100 shots,
which is near enough to “almost im-
possible.”
Other weapons in the arsenal are:
The Air Force’s F9B “Falcon”
guided missile, is expected to be
carried soon by night fighters.
The Air Force’s F 99 “Bomarc”, a
ground-launched pilotless fighter, is
expected to be available in a few
years.
The Army’s “Sky-sweeper” is a gun
designed for defence against low level
air strikes.

THE NEW LEVER HOUSE, NEW YORK
FACADES OF GLASS AND STAINLESS STEEL.
A striking sight in New York City’s
Park Avenue is the newly-opened
Lever House, home of Lever Brothers
Company.
Its exterior is blue heat-absorbing
glass and stainless steel. The blue glass
has a functional and not a decorative
purpose, for it admits light but filters
out 35% of the sun’s heat and enables
the building’s engineers to maintain a
uniform temperature.
The architects of the building are
Skidmore, Owings and Marrill, one of
the biggest names in U.S. architecture.
Among their major constructions is the
Ohio State University Medical Centre
and the entire atomic town of Oak
Ridge, Tenn.
Lever House is built on a conven-
tioned skeleton with more than 3400
tons of steel used in its framework.
The land area is 34,830 square feet,
the nett building area 275,000 square
feet, the nett office area (private
office and desk space) 131,000 square
feet. The height of the building, with
its 24 floors, is 306 feet. Costs for
building were 6,000,000 dollars.
The sealing of the windows not only
helps balance the air conditioning,
but cuts installation and maintenance
cost, and because the big city’s soot
and grime does not come into the
building the windows do not have to
be washed as frequently on the inside
as on the outside.
Wired glass was used instead of
bricks or stone in the spandrels be-
tween the windows and this enables
the window-cleaning crews to wash the
entire exterior of the building so that
it will always be clean and glistening.
Straight lines with a minimum of
decorative flourishes were used to keep
the building ageless.
The ground floor contains a glass-
enclosed lobby with a garden extend-
ing from the outside within the lobby
proper—the Lever Home Kitchen for
the promoting of Lever Brothers’ food
products, and an auditorium. The
second floor contains a Recreation
Lounge for the 1200 employees housed
in the building and a room for medi-
cal service. The third floor is the
location for the Cafeteria, and then
start the office floors, the executive
offices being on the 21st floor.
The tower occupies only a quarter
of the total land area.
Washing the Building.
As one of the leading makers of
soaps and detergents in the United
States, Lever Brothers is most interest'
ed in the clean aspects of the new
building, so when the house was in
the planning stage the problem of
washing all 1404 windows was studied
for six months by the architects.
To solve this problem it was neces'
sary to invent a special window-
washing machine which, perfected and
constructed by the Otis Elevator Com-
pany, has two principal units. The
first unit, the power plant,
runs on standard railroad tracks around
the top of the building just inside the
cornice. The second unit, the gon-
dola, runs up and down the side of
the building on stainless steel tracks
six windows apart. The gondola at-
taches to the vertical tracks by grip-
pers which prevent swing and sway,
tipping and tilting, and is connected
by cables from the long arms extend-
ing over the side.
The whole window-washing machine
is electrically operated. The crew con-
trols the up and down movement by
push buttons, washing the six-window
strip from top to bottom. The gon-
dola is returned to the top, a button
moves the power plant unit horizontal-
ly to the next six-window strip, where
the gondola gripper automatically finds
the vertical tracks —and the crew is
ready for another washing excursion.
It is really a movable external lift.
The power plant car moves around
the roof at a speed of 25 feet per
ninute. The gondola moves up and
down the side of Lever House at a
speed of 35 feet per minute.
This new device permits two men
to keep Lever House and its 1404
windows clean at all times, and the
two men can clean a window in about
90 seconds, or less than one-third the
time it takes a window-washer to clean
the conventional double-hung sash
window by the usual method. The en-
tire building exterior can be washed
by two men in only six days.
Interior Design.
The problem of the interior design
was solved by Raymond Loewv Cor-
noration. Industrial Designers and
Planners. Colour styling for Lever
House started with the outdoqrs. In
order to preserve the consistent colour
effect from the outside, a hue was first
developed for the Venetian blinds

which are used on the windows. Seen
from the outside, this colour “reads”
the same as the balance of the reflect'
ing glass surface of the building
whether the blinds are raised or
lowered.
The first condition for interior
colours was set up by the blue heat'
absorbing glass of the windows. It
was met by establishing a basic colour
to act as a modulator for all other
colours in the interior scheme. This
colour a warm grey'beige was
especially created and has been named
Lever House Beige.
The aid'eonditioning of Lever House
is operated from three zones- —north,
south, and interior. If one zone goes
out, the other two will provide com'
fort and fresh air.
Ground Floor Stores?
This question is asked frequently
about a business building of such iim
portance in the centre of Manhattan.
With a view to any possible source
of profit, Lever Brothers made a care'
ful survey of the shopping traffic in
this particular section of Park Avenue:,
which showed that the nett return was
small in relation to the great capital
investment required for building
ground floor stores. Further, ground
floor stores would need some base'
ment room and Lever wanted to keep
all the basement area for its own
garage and storage space. And final'
ly, such stores would have destroyed
the dramatic effect of a building that
seems to float in the air above a land'
scaped patio.
These are the Four Freedoms which
the Australian Building Industry
seeks, and an organised programme
to implement them is, in the opinion
of Industry leaders, long overdue.
What is urgently needed is an oven
all programme that will streamline
procedures, reduce wasted manpower,
put idle capital to work, and cut
through the red'tape and bureaucracy
that to'day hampers the Industry with
needless, archaic controls and restric'
tions.
Backing Assured.
To achieve the Four Freedoms of
Building is a task for the leaders of
the industry, and there are nation'
wide indications that such a move is
imminent.
They will be assured of the whole'
hearted, enthusiastic backing of all
Master Builders, and, in fact, all mem'
bers of the vast building and affiliated
industries.
The drive to bring about the Four
Freedoms of Building is something
that will appeal to the dramatic in'
stincts of all Australians, for it will
eventually result in builders being
able to take their proper place in
the scheme of things— to use the na'
tion’s economic resources to satisfy
the needs and desires of commerce,
industry, and the public.
Four Freedoms.
To accomplish the four essential
freedoms, the building industry must
be—
• Free to plan ahead; to plan the
future development of the nation, un'
hampered by any pressures whatso'
ever.
• Free to employ idle capital, to
further all types of building, and
every manner of construction, so long
as it contributes to the stability of the
nation and the people.
• Free to apply cost'reduction ef'
forts to direct labour and materials;
and to seek reductions in insurances,
taxes, supplies and services.
• Free from ridiculous present'day
Governmental and Municipal controls
and restrictions, ranging from out'
dated building regulations to alhim'
portant credit restrictions.
If the Building Industry can relieve
these pressures upon its progress, it
will undoubtedly enter upon a new
era of great prosperity.
Australia’s National Income is ex'
pected to rise above £4,000,000,000
in 1953/54 according to Mr. Me'
Mahon, Minister for Navy and Air.
In 1949/50 when the Government
took office, the National Income was
£2,300,000,000.
FOUR FREEDOMS OF BUILDING
PLEA FOR ECONOMIC UNDERSTANDING.
The basic goals of democratic
peoples are these Four Freedoms —
• Freedom of Worship.
® Freedom of Speech.
® Freedom from Want.
• Freedom from Fear.
The doctrine of these Four Free'
doms was embodied by the late Presi'
dent Roosevelt in a statement of prim
ciples which symbolised the deepest
hopes and aspirations of men through'
out the world.
President Roosevelt tried to con'
dense these principles into a slogan
which would seize men’s imagination.
Could we not condense similar prim
ciples into the Four Freedoms of Build'
ing, which, translated into everyday
language, would mean economic un'
derstanding which would secure for
the industry its constitutional rights
in Australia?
• Freedom to Plan Ahead.
• Freedom to Employ Idle Capital.
• Freedom From High Overheads.
• Freedom From Controls and
Restrictions.

AN ALUMINIUM SKYSCRAPER
NEW IDEAS. METHODS, MATERIALS ARE USED.
I An aluminium tower, recently com'
bleted in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.. has be-
come as famous as New York’s Flat'
Iron Building or Empire State Build'
ng.
Like them, it is a milestone of a
hew era, for it serves as a demonstra'
tion of both standard and new uses of
construction.
The Alcoa Building, erected for the
Aluminium Company of America,
proved an unusual opportunity for its
team of architects, engineers, build'
ers and owners to experiment with
new ideas, materials and methods in
iuch an ambitious project.
The result is the lightest'weight
building of its size to date and in'
corporates a great number of new de'
velopments. The structural steel frame
is fireproofed with foam concrete,
which was also used for floor slabs in
the mechanical core areas. The re'
mainder of the floor is of cellular steel
panels surfaced with concrete fill and
plastic tile or carpet, and fireproofed
beneath with perlite'plaster.
Exteriors are thin, stamped alumim
ium panels, bolted to angles on the
spandrel beams, and backed up with
4in. of perlite'concrete sprayed on
slotted aluminium lath and reinforc'
ing bars.
Ceilings are aluminium radiant heat'
ing and cooling panels designed to
provide all the winter heating and
half of the summertime sensible heat'
ing.
Air for ventilation and the rest of
the cooling is distributed through alu-
minium ducts to ceiling diffusers. All
electrical wiring, conduit and sector
busses, and most piping are also of
aluminium.
We Lag Behind.
This 41'Storey office building is not
a tall structure as U.S. buildings go,
but it outleaps anything we have —or
are likely to have —in Australia, whilst
our authorities are infused with re'
strictions to the city’s progress and
nothing else.
This structure is a striking symbol
of the fruits of private enterprise, en'
couraged by sane Government and
civic authorities, and channelled to'
ward the progress of the nation.
The same thing could happen here,
for our large companies are just as
keen to erect buildings worthy of their
products, and symbolic of their
achievements, as are the Americans.
But they are defeated before they
start; discouraged by pin-headed bur'
eaucrats and muddle'minded politi'
cians from building.
Latest example of this is seen in the
ambitious, praiseworthy Dunlop Rub'
ber Company project.
This organisation, which has done
so much to foster art in Australia, has
planned a group of buildings in Com-
monwealth Street, Sydney, which
would be an endowment to our cub
ture for generations to come.
Dunlop planned a 14'storey build'
ing which would include a National
Theatre, an Art Gallery, and a num-
her of other cultural amenities of the
greatest value and importance to Syd'
nev and the State.
This laudable project is in line
with what is done in other lands:
overseas, no city or ’town worthy of
its name feels its achievements are
complete unless it has a Civic Centre
as a focal point for its cultural life.
But the Dunlop project—the best
thing of its kind ever to be proposed
for Sydney—stands every chance of
being shelved by the City Council,
whose absurd Zoning Regulations im'
pose the most ridiculous restrictions
and curbs upon all types of city con'
struction.
“It is like trying to weave a rope
of sand to get any sense out of the
council,” a Master Builder declared
last week.
“Sydney is going backwards so fast
in everything you can mention
building, transport, roads, traffic,
manners —that we are really estrang'
ing ourselves from the world.
“We are a Sovereign State that’s
not worth two'bob tO'dav,” he added.
How right he is. As long as our
political ostriches bury their heads in
the sands of inertia and apathy, so
long will Sydney and the rest of
N.S.W. stagnate and vegetate.
We have built nothing in the City
of Sydney for fifteen years
A motorist, travelling thousands of
miles across the United States, need
never carry cash to pay for petrol, oil
or tyres. He just produces to the
garage a credit card from a petrol
company and everything they have is
his.

NEW FIRE STATION AT ROSANNA, VICTORIA
SEPARATE COTTAGES FOR STAFF.
The most recent of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Boards suburban stations will soon be officially opened at Rosanna, a sec-
tion of the City of Heidelberg When first planned, the proposed station was in two-storeyed form, but changes in the
Brigade organisation necessitated a simpler plan, and as a result one contract for the flat-roofed station of brick and con-
crete construction was let to Mr. D.S. Begg, while two official residences nearby were built by Messrs
McCaskill Bros. The hill-top site was chosen to provide favourable outlet roadways and a down-hill run-off for the fire engines.
The buildings were planned by Mr. Percy Everett. State Architect, with Mr. Ross Simmons as Associate Designer.

SPORTS LIGHTING
By M. W. PIERCE
(The Illuminating Engineering
Society, London)
The paper deals with the lighting
problems which are met with in
various indoor and outdoor sports, in'
eluding boxing, billiards, badminton,
lawn tennis, rifle ranges, race tracks,
squash racquets and football.
It seems fairly certain that games
played under artificial lighting are very
attractive to the players, the game
seems fast and the player feels he is
in good form. The facilities which
exist for the ordinary member of the
public to play games after dark are
surprisingly simple and inexpensive.
Some games, such as badminton, are
usually played in artificial light and
do indeed prove the point that there
is a demand for recreation of an active
kind in the evening; on the other
hand, there is very little lawn tennis
played in England except in daylight.
In the case of sports which attract
a large gate it is possible, and indeed
necessary, to install more elaborate
equipment, and the arrangement mus:
be such as to give both spectators and
players a good view. The game of
football played under lights has
Droved itself very attractive both to
public and players.
It freouently happens that players
and spectators continue with lighting
conditions which are less than ideal
when considerable improvements could
be made without costly alterations to
the lighting scheme.
BALLARAT RECORDS PROGRESS
NEW HOSPITAL AND POWER STATION.
The Mayor’s Report for 195 L 52

progressive city. First is the new
“Packaged” power station that is to
be erected at an estimated cost of
£2,500,000, and second the fine new
Infectionus Diseases Block that is in the
course of construction at the Ballarat
Hospital, both of which are illustrated
herewith.
Another ambitious project that is
included in the report is the proposed
Civic Hall, for which a site has been
selected in the Haymarket Reserve and
for which a request for finance to the
extent of £50,000 has been submitted
to the Loan Council.
Ballarat’s Gold Centenary Celebra-
tions terminated on November 24th,
1951, by the planting of a commemo'
ration tree in the Botanical Gardens
by the Mayor, Councillor W. E. Roff,
while a monument known as “The
Gold Monument’’ is the latest addition
to what is becoming known as the
City of Statues.
Valuations for 1952 amounted to
£718,291, rate being 3/2 in the pound,

Reinforced Hollow Clay Blocks for Large
Roof Construction
AN ADVANCED CONTINENTAL DEVELOPMENT.
What is known as clay block roofs
is a development now coming into ex'
tensive use on the Continent. In gene'
ral terms, two types of hollow'day
block roofing are in use—shallow slabs
which are assembled on purlins and
roof trusses, and thus which simply
provide the roof cladding and com
tribute a little to the stiffness of the
structure; the second and more ad'
vanced form makes use of unusually
deep hollow blocks, which are assem'
bled with reinforcement and concrete
grouting into preformed structural
members. The clay blocks in this case
form vaulted roofs and need no sup'
port from trusses or joists.
Vaulted structures are in fact an
excellent method for roofing large in'
dustrial buildings, garages, large public
buildings, stations, churches, reservoirs
and all halls or large dimensions where
it is necessary that the interior of the
building should be unobstructed by
niers or pillars intended to support the
roof.
It is not generally realised that hob
low clay blocks also lend themselves
readily to large vaulted constructions,
and that by taking advantage of the
static characteristics of curved surfaces
it is possible to make important savings
in costs and materials.
In the past, for the construction of
such structures, structural steelwork or
reinforced concrete have been env
ployed. Reinforced concrete is intend'
ed to displace structural steel, for
reasons of appearance and lower main'
tenance costs. It is, however, a very
costly way of constructing large vaults,
since the scaffoldings and centering,
owing to the curved form of the cast'
ings, are inevitably very complicated.
Moreover, the weight of the struc'
ture itself, if of reinforced concrete,
is very great, which increases on the
one hand the cost and quantity of
shuttering required during construe'
tion and on the other the quantities
of reinforcement used in the vault it'
self and in the tie beams.
Blocks Reduce Weight.
Hollow clay blocks, on the other
hand, reduce these two factors very
considerably, and greatly simplify the
construction of vault coverings and re'
duce the construction cost so much
that it becomes one of the most econo'
mical methods for the covering of
buildings of industrial sue, or larger.
In a sense, the use of hollow clay
blhcks for roof construction is a de'
velopment from their old-established
use for the construction of “pot”
floors, which again on the Continent
is now done to advanced standards of
design. Continental practice in floor'
ing differs from the British in that the
floor slabs are usually assembled with
their reinforcement and grouted and
are not put in position until set. This
reduces the cost of shuttering, as com'
pared with the English method of put'
ting the individual blocks in position,
before grouting. A similar method is
adopted for the construction of the
clay block roofs; the blocks are assem'
bled on templates on the ground, re'
inforced and grouted, and not put in
position until set.
The various beams sections are set
in position not on a continued scaf'
folding, but on limited temporary
strips of scaffolding which serve as
support to the beams during the com'
pletion of the structure.
For the construction of these curved
units the various parts of the hollow
block work are arranged one follow'
ing the other on the surface of a con'
vex template which reproduce exactly
the outline of the vault section for
which the beams are intended.
The beam sections are allowed to
set until the cement in the reinforce'
ment of the grooves has acquired suf'
ficient strength to allow them to be
transported and set in position.
Then the beam sections are taken
on the scaffolding which is arranged
in such a manner that the beam sec-
tions find support for their ends.
According to the dimensions of the
building to be roofed and to the bear'
ing capacity required, the vaulted
structure can be of a number of dif'
ferent forms.
Once the different clay block beams
forming the roof structure have been
set in position, the concrete will be
grouted into the ribs, which have been
formed between the beams. When
this has set, the whole structure be'
comes “solid” and homogeneous.
The steel tie beams have an im-
portant part to play in these vaulted
structures.
After the roof has been erected, and
the concrete has acquired sufficient
REINFORCED HOLLOW CLAY BLOCKS.
What is known as clay block roofs are coming into extensive use on the Continent.
We illustrate some details of this method of construction. (Top) A block in detail
and a general view of a curved roof prior to concreting. (Bottom left) Hollow
blocks arranged on the surface of a convex template. (Bottom right) the steel
reinforcement is put into grooves which is filled with thick cement.

strength, but before the scaffolding
and shuttering are removed, the tie
beams will be put in stress, which
takes the load of the vault off the
scaffolding which may then be easily
removed.
The lateral beams can be supported
either on load bearing walls op on
pillars.
In the first case they must absorb
the simple horizontal force produced
by the thrust of the vault, in the
second case they must be of suitable
: dimensions for supporting their own
’ weight.
Vaulted roofs made with hollow
clay blocks constructed with suitable
ventilating openings can be covered
with ordinary roof tiles or of bitU'
; minous felts, etc.
The shape of the vaults can be cir'
cular, parabolic, or cuspidal, according
to the static requirements; the design
calculations in any case are made in
accordance with the accepted practice,
taking into account the real angles we
have on the imposts which are often
functioning as hinges, the resilient
elongation of the steel tie beams, ther'
mad expansion, and so on.
All Right in 2053.
If Britain is to get on its feet and
remain on its feet it must modernise its
industry, a scientific report declared
recently. It added that, if industry
is to keep up with the times, scientific
research is of vital importance.
Britain spent less than £5,000,000
last year on industrial scientific re'
search, says the report.
And it warns the Government that
recent economy cuts will do long'term
damage to U.K. industry and its ex'

Queensland Letter
BUILDING AND ARCHITECTURAL NEWS.
A cynic was recently heard to re'
mark that half the world were employ'
ed to hand out forms for the other
half to fill in.
Architects and builders are more
prone to agree with the substance of
this pithy summing'up of the lot of
those two sections of society for very
convincing reasons. The general com'
plaint is that rarely does a plan and
specification submitted to the autho'
rides of a proposed building obtain
the reauisite permit without one or
more attempts to reconcile plans and
specification with building ordinances
new and old and the various
authorities in which nermits to build
are vested. The authorities may be
summed'up as follows: City Council
Works and Co'Ordination Authorities;
Health Department, Water 6? Sewer'
age: Labour and Industry (sometimes)
State Public Works; and if the build'
ing is a public house, the Licensing
Commission. With this formidable
arrav of building authorities it would
be hard to imagine the aggregate
amount of time involved before per-
mits could be obtained for 671 build'
ing operations.
Of the 671 building permits issued
by the Brisbane City Council during
April by far the largest proportion are
for new dwellings.
Then come those for alterations to
dwellings (residences can now be
altered to become flats), garages and
caravan buildings, small shops, and.
the smallest proportion, commercial
buildings of onlv moderate sizes, such
as one for =£6ooo.
Some of the remodelling and reno'
vations are extensive, and represent
the expenditure of considerable sums
of money. One of such is Vandeleur’s
Lands Office Hotel at the corner of
George and Mary Streets, whose ex'
ternal appearance, at least, now bears
little or no resemblance to the original
building.
Similarly, the purchase of the six'
storeyed building of the Country Press
Company, at the corner of Edward and
Elizabeth Streets, by the Transport and
General Insurance Co. Ltd., has led
to the transformation from a drab ex*
terior to an ornate one of Travertine
Marble, and a resplendent interior of
parquetried flooring, much glass and
“blonde” office furnishings,
A warehouse for Harding Bros. Pty.
Ltd., at Bulimba; a new factory and
warehouse at North Quay for Country
Traders Ltd.; an extensive new shop in
George Street for Woolworths, follow'
ing a similar building just opened by
this company in the Valley shopping
area, are amongst buildings in pro'
gress or just finished.
One of the most important pro*
posed new buildings is the imposing
structure planned for the Prudential
Assurance Co. Ltd. at the corner of
North Quay and Queen Street, to face
the very ornate Treasury building. A
considerable time has elapsed since this
company was reported to have been
granted a building permit that would
not entail drawing upon local building
materials in short supply. This, at
the time, required that some materials
would have had to be brought from
abroad. The “lion in the path” of
arrested progress in the meantime
came to light in a recent Brisbane City

Continued from previous page
Council statement that before building
operations could proceed it was their
intention to define a new building
alignment that would involve the
widening of the roadway at North
Quay and the truncating of this road-
way where it joins Queen Street. This
building proposal links up with a
major city alteration which could in-
volve the accomplishment of the long-
deferred intention to carry Adelaide
Street through from George Street to
North Quay. This would need the
resumption of valuable land on which
some buildings stand.
Then, in this vicinity, it is proposed
to build another bridge across the
Brisbane River between the Grey
Street Bridge and the Victoria Bridge,
which latter, to quote the current ex-
pression, has “about had it” in its
nearly sixty years’ service to the traffic
of trams and other vehicles. If and
when that proposal now being con-
sidered by the Government is brought
to fruition, and another bridge intend-
ed to carry suburban electric trains
across the river at Indooroopilly is
built, there will be no less than seven
bridges spanning the Brisbane River
between Indooroopilly and the Story
Bridge the latter next in size in
Australia to Sydney’s Harbour Bridge.
In addition to the large hospital
building of the Brisbane and South
Coast Hospital Board on Ipswich
Road, sketch of which has appeared
in this Journal, and on which work
is proceeding steadily, the Mater
Maternity Hospital, South Brisbane, is
being built by K. D. Morris & Sons
Pty. Ltd. Its ultimate height is to be
seven floors and in the grounds of the
Mater Misericordiae Private and Public
Hospitals on a hillside which will give
the Maternity Hospital great height.
The large motor terminal station at
South Brisbane for Penfolds is nearing
completion. For an expenditure of
<£500,000 the Queensland Cement and
Lime Works Ltd. will install additional
machinery at Darra.
The recently completed orchestral
“shell” at a cost of £16,000 in the
Botanic Gardens drew a great crowd
at its opening on a recent Sunday
afternoon. Its opening to the West,
from which disagreeable winds blow in
either winter or summer, has the com-
pensating advantage of being at the
bottom of a grassy slope from which
some thousands of people can view the
orchestra while listening to the music.
Though this letter’s intention was to
refer to Citv of Brisbane new build-
ings only, mention might be excusable
of a new £BO,OOO picture theatre for
Mt. Isa, designed by Guy Crick and
Associates, architects of Brisbane and
Sydney. This outback town of 8000
people, living 1400 miles north-west
of Brisbane, was until about a genera-
tion ago just a place where cattle
grazed and fossickers fossicked for
minerals.
Now, the fabulously rich Mount Isa
Mines Limited, from which this no
mean population of 8000 draw their
existence from high wages and, some-
times, even higher metal bonuses, is
to have a palatial air-conditioned pic-
ture palace to provide 1100 people
with the most comfortable seating to
view the latest three-dimensional films.

Coronation Lighting Scheme.
Of all the royal emblems which
could suitably be employed for an
occasion of national rejoicing such as
the Coronation, the rose is perhaps
the most symbolic.
The rose is the basis of the scheme
of decorations and illuminations evolv'
ed by the Regent Street Association
in conjunction with the General Elec'
trie Co. Ltd. and Beverley Pick Asso'
ciates, the aim of which gave the
whole of this majestic highway an in-
dividuality both simple and dignified.
Building fronts hung with vertical
drapes of a specially printed fabric
based on the English hedge rose. It
hung from the third floor level, being
placed against every available column
between windows on both sides of the
miledong street.
One thousand specially designed
“Chrysaline” roses* made in two sizes,
sft. and 3ft. diameter, were placed at
first floor levels. A red and white
valance extended along the cornice of
each building, while at balcony level
existing flower troughs provided the
final touch.
In addition, about a hundred large
Royal ciphers and other G.E.C. Coro'
nation devices in “Chryasline” were
displayed in prominent positions, af'
fording a dramatic night-time effect.
The decorations were put up ten
days before the Coronation and will
remain up for twenty-five days after-
wards.
An integral part of the entire
scheme is the illumination of the
drapes. At least 156 G.E.C. flood'
lights, each housing two IOOOw. Class
B 1 Osram projector lamps, spaced at
50ft. intervals and mounted on exist'
ing ledges 15ft. above pavement level,
were erected to illuminate decorations
on the opposite side of the street.
The floodlights were designed to avoid
glare to pedestrians and road traffic.

manufacturing rights in Australia for
“Chrysaline.”

Chesapeake Bay Bridge—Largest

justified pride for all connected with
that bold construction. The largest
continuous entirely - over - water steel
structure in the world, the 45,000,000

sections of Maryland a link that has
not existed since the days most Mary-
landers travelled by boat and the
Chesapeake itself was their highway.
Here are some leading facts about
the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The work
started on the bridge structure in
November, 1949, and the bridge
opened to traffic on July 30, 1952,
The length, shore to shore, including
causeway, is 4.35 miles, the length of
the bridge structure 4.03 miles. The
bridge’s 2920 ft. suspension section is
the longest strand-cable structure so
far. Each suspension anchorage is
one pier away from the end of the
suspension span proper. So strands
are almost 4000 ft. long, while the
main span length is 1600 ft. [Our
Lane Cove Bridge, 1536 ft. of short
spans on many piers, was started in
April, 1946, and is still years off com-
pletion.]
The suspension bridge towers 354 ft.
above the bay surface. The roadway
between curbs is 28ft. wide. The dia-
meter of suspension bridge cables is
14in. The foundations are reinforced
concrete piers supported on steel piles
driven into the bay bottom. The
deepest piles penetrate 203 ft. below
the bay water surface.
Approximately 17,500 tons of steel
piling have been used in the construc-
tion (4130 piles), besides 42,500 tons
of structural and other steel, 118,000
cubic yards of cement concrete,
2,538,000 cubic yards of earth mov-
able, 151,400 tons of slope protection
stone.
Traffic capacity of the bridge is
1500 vehicles per hour in one direc-
tion. Estimated traffic is 1,100,000
vehicles annually in 1952, increasing
by 450,000 in 1961.
The curve in the bridge alignment
was necessary to comply with regula-
tions determined by the Corps of En-
gineers, U.S. Army, in conjunction
with the necessity of landing the
bridge on favourable terrain.
Bridge Strands in the Cables.
Interesting is the use of bridge
strands instead of parallel wires in the
cables of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge
—as well as the placement of suspend'
ed structure in large four'panel, pre'
assembled sections. The tendency of
the construction was to do as much
work as possible off-site, away from
the hazards of open-water construe'
tion, then bring it to the job and place
it as quickly as possible. Planning for
erection of the bridge was under the
direction of J. H. Wagner, general
manager of erection for Bethlehem
Steel Company, and E, L. Durke,
Bethlehem engineer of erection. The
bridge was designed by the firm of J.
E. Greiner Co., Baltimore, for the
Maryland State Roads Commission.
A report in “Engineering News'
Record” states that the strands, 5 5
large ones and 6 small ones for each
cable, were pre'stressed, measured,
marked for saddle positions and pro'
vided with special anchorage sockets.
The saddle'position markings gave
each strand its correct sag for its de'
signed final position in the cable.
Each strand was delivered on a reel
and then pulled off and into place in
the bridge cable by a conventional
cable'spinning tramway.
Engineers of Bethlehem Steel Co.
estimate that a parallehwire job would
have taken three times as long with
the same amount of equipment. The
time'saving was not greater because
there was a limit to the number of
strands that could be placed daily. A
day’s work included the temporary
placement of one horizontal layer ol
strands (five to nine strands). This
step involved approximate positioning
of the strand layer in the final cable
location. The layer was secured by
wood clamps that kept it flat.
At night, when temperature vana-
lions were less severe than in the day'
time, a second crew moved on to the
towers and catwalks. With the aid of
chain hoists at the saddles, the crew
carefully adjusted the position of each
strand. Friction against saddles and
other strands was enough to hold a
strand. Adjustment took place at the
main'tower saddles, then at the side'
pier saddles. At the anchorages,
jacks pulling on the sockets made the
final adjustment for correct length;
proper shims were placed, then the
load was transferred through bearing
rods to the anchorage plates.
Refining Bridge Design
Practice.
A report will shortly be released on
the results of fulhscale tests on a
Californian Freeway bridge by the
three cooperating agencies, namely,
University of California Institute of
Transportation and Traffic Engineer'
ing, the California Division of High'
ways and the U.S. Bureau of Public
Roads. Among the findings, these
seem to be significant:
WINNER OF A “MOST BEAUTIFUL BRIDGE” AWARD.
The Delaware River Bridge, three miles from Wilmington, was the first major bridge to be
undertaken in America after the war. It has since been followed by other large bridges in
the Atlantic States. The main suspension span measures 2150 feet. This bridge recently
received the American Institute of Steel Construction’s award in Class I. of the 24th annual
beautiful bridge competition. Class I. covers steel bridges with spans of 400 feet or more.
The harmony of details in the design was praised by the judges. The designers were the
New York firm of Howard Needles, Tammers and Bergendoff, with O. H. Ammann as con-
sulting engineer and A. Gordon Lorimer as consulting architect.

(1) Composite action between the
steel girders and the concrete
deck system was found to exist
—even though there were no
shear connectors;
(2) Deflection as measured closely
approximated that computed
for composite action;
(3) AASGO values for transverse
load distribution are conserva-
tive for the middle girders and
agree closely for the two ex-
terior girders;
(4) The effect of the diaphragm on
load distribution was small;
(5) Dynamic increments of strain
and deflection for smoothly
rolling loads range from 20 to
30 per cent, of static values;
(6) The use of continuous record-
in g equipment to measure
strains and deflections was
found to be very effective for
static as well as dynamic
measurements.
Era of Great Bridges.
Never before in the history of
bridge engineering have such amazing
strides of progress been recorded as
in recent years. A generation ago,
the cantilever type was dominant.
Since then the cantilever bridge has
y.elded its previous supremacy to the
suspension type.
The world’s seven longest spans
are now suspension bridges. And, as
D. B. Steinman, Consulting Engineer,
in a survey on the Era of Great
Bridges points out, plans have been
made for moumental suspension
bridges of still longer spans, including
a span of 4620 ft. over the Narrows at
New York and a span of 5000 ft over
the Strait of Messina, between Italy
and Sicily. He is confident that sus-
pension bridge spans up to 10,000 ft.
are practicable and may be expected.
By combining three previously un-
related sciences, namely, the deflection
theory of suspension bridges, the
mathematical theory of vibration
analysis, and the science of aero-
dynamics, a new science of suspension
bridge aerodynamics has now been
developed. It permits predictive com
trol, solution and cure of bridge prob-
lems previously insolvable. New re-
cords have been achieved in the mag'
nitude and depth of bridge foundations
sunk under most difficult conditions.
The need for improved bridge mate'
rials has taken two directions, accord'
ing to Mr. Steinman. One is the de'
velopment of higher-strength steels,
including alloy steels (silicon steel,
nickel steel, steel manganese, chrome'
nickel steel), heat'treated carbon steel,
and cold'drawn. high'carbon bridge
wire. Materials with three or four
times the safe working strength of
ordinary steel have been developed.
The other direction is the develop-
ment of lighter'weight metals for struc-

O. D. A. OBERG HONOURED
C.M.G. FOR " BIG TIMBER MAN"
People in almost every sphere of
Australian industry and public life are
delighted that Her Gracious Majesty
Queen Elizabeth 11., in her Coronation
Year, has been pleased to honour a
distinguished Australian whose service
to the community has been outstand'
ing during many years.
Mr. Olaf David August Oberg has
been created a Companion of the
Most Distinguished Order of St.
Michael and St. George.
Mr. Oberg is a New South Welsh'
man and was educated at Sydney High
School. He gained distinction even
as a youngster and was Captain of his
School in 1911. Mr. Oberg was
Charter President of the Building In'
dustry Congress of New South Wales
and thus a principal founder of a
body which has a proud place in or'
ganisational life in that it comprises
all sections of a key industry. He
continues to serve on the Executive
Council of 8.1. C.
Mr. Oberg is “Big Timber’’ ment'
ally, physically and commercially. He
is Chairman of the Board of Direct'
ors of Thatcher &? Oberg Pty. Ltd. —
importers, exporters and retailers. He
is Chairman of the Board of Direct'
ors of Cypress Pine Timbers Pty. Ltd.
and a Director of D. Thatcher and
Sons (Cooperage) Pty. Ltd., Timber
Trade Mutual Insurance Ltd., Timber
Mutual Insurance Ltd., and Timber
Tallying Association Ltd. For seven
years he was President of the Council
of the Sydney and Suburban Timber
Merchants’ Association and was
Foundation President (and President
for 10 years) of the Timber Develop'
ment Association of Australia Ltd.
In the sphere of national service,
Mr. Oberg has applied his talents to
problems of great significance to Aus'
tralia. He was Advisor to the Austra'
lian Delegation to the United Nations
Conference in San Francisco in 1945
and was the leader of the Employers’
Delegation at the International Labour
Organisation Conference in Paris that
same year.
In 1945 he was also a Member of
the Commonwealth Immigration Ad'
visory Committee which reported to
the Federal Government on migration
prospects from the United Kingdom
and Western Europe. Such report led
to the establishment of the Immigra'
tion Advisory Council, of which he
was an original member and has been
Deputy Chairman for the past two
years. In January, 1950, Mr. Oberg
was Chairman of the first Australian
Citizenship Convention held in Can*
berra. He was a member of the Un-
employment Relief Council of New
South Wales for over three years dur'
ing the Stevens’ Government. Dur-
ing World War 11. he served as a
member of the Manpower Advisory
Committee of New South Wales and
as Advisor to the Timber Controller
for Australia. Mr. Oberg has travelled
abroad very extensively during the
past twenty years and has submitted
many reports to the Federal Govern'
ment, especially on matters affecting
Immigration.
Mr. Oberg was President of the
Employers’ Federation of New South
Wales for three years and is Immed'
iate Past President (and was Fresh
dent for almost five years) of the
Australian Council of Employers’ Fed'
erations, of which he is a life member
of the Council.
Active Rotarian.
Mr. Oberg has been a very active
member and servant of Rotary for
many years. He is a Past President of
the Rotary Club of Sydney which he
joined in 1938. He served Rotary
International as a committee member,
was a member of the International AT
fairs Committee for 1948'49 and was
District Governor of the 29th Dis'
trict for 1949/50. During 1950'5l he
was a member of the Aims and Ob'

jects Committee and from 1951-52 of
the Programme Planning Committee.
He attended the International As-
sembly and the International Conven-
tion of Rotary in 1949. He has rep-
resented successive Presidents of Rot-
ary International at Rotary District
Conferences in various parts of the
world.
Mr. Oberg, C.M.G., has undoubt-
edly compiled a record of service
which does credit to himself and to
New South Wales. He is still active
in national and industrial affairs—a
man of abounding energy and enthus-
iasm—and his colleagues look forward
confidently to the benefit of his in-
spiring leadership for many years to
come.
“Building, Lighting, Engineering”
is proud to join in the chorus of
congratulation and approbation.
The longest telegram ever trans-
mitted was from Birmingham, Ala-
bama, to President Roosevelt on his
birthday, in 1934. It contained 41,000
signatures, and it took expert telegra-
phists 19 hours 8 minutes to send it.
The longest sentence ever written
is incorporated in the 1941 minutes of
Cincinnatti fOhio) City Council. It
contains 20,000 words.
SOUND WAY OF
EXTINGUISHING FIRES.
Dale K. Auck, fire prevention ex-
pert for the U.S. Federation of Mutual
Fire Insurance Companies believes
that the fireman of the future will put
out fires by beaming high frequency
sound waves at them. The use of
water and present methods will be
discarded.
“In a laboratory,” he is reported as
saying, “one can bend or diminish the
flame of a Bunsen burner by bounc-
ing sound waves against it. There’s
no reason why the same thing could
not be done with larger fires as our
knowledge of sound increases.
Auck’s fire station of to-morrow
would consist of a large self-powered
generator. This would have a dish-
shaped antenna, similar to a radar
search screen. When fire broke out,
the fireman would aim the antenna at
it, the generator would send out sup-
ersonic frequencies and —presto—the
fire would be extinguished.
Besides large-scale models, smaller
sound generators might also be devel-
oped. These would be installed in
buildings just like present - day
sprinkler systems.
Auck sums up by saying that water
has been used as an extinguishing
agent since time immemorial.
“All we've done is to improve its
application technique. It’s time we
looked for a better agent, and sound
waves may be the answer.'
He doesn’t let his forecast of the
future finish with sound waves. As a
distinguished electrical engineer, he
predicts such wonders as solar heating
and wireless transmission of power.
New Headaches.
It it does come, solar heating will
provide new headaches for the safety
experts. It will have to be well in*
sulated. But it will also eliminate
many present hazards by doing away
with heating units that use combust'
ible materials.
Regarding power transmission,
Auck points out that small amounts
of electricity can already be transmit-
ted from one point to another with-
out wires in the laboratory. He fore-
sees the day when power for homes
will be received in much the same
manner as we now get radio pro-
grammes.
Auck concedes that his predictions
may seem fantastic. “But it must be
noted,” he says, “that the rate of
technical change is increasing rapidly.
Advances that might have taken 100
years to achieve some time ago may
now be realities within 25 to 50
years.
NEW CONCRETE RESEARCH
LABORATORIES IN BRITAIN.
The Association of Portland Cement
Manufacturers, which operates 26 cement
works in Britain, has built these new lab-
oratories at Greenhithe, Kent, for carry-
ing out research work on new cement-
based products and for improvements
in the quality of existing cement pro-
ducts. Concrete construction, in many
of its forms, is used throughout the
building. Walls are of cavity type with
hollow clinker blocks as the out-
side and hollow foamed slag concrete
blocks for the inside skin. A coloured
Tyrolean texture finish is used externally
and plaster internally, with acid-resist-
ing paint and glazed tile dadoes In the
chemical laboratories. Some cast stone
facing is also employed at the main
entrance and for window surrounds, ex-
cept that window heads are of cast-in-
situ concrete integral with the structural
framing.

SIXTY-SIX YEARS OF WUNDERLICH INDUSTRY
1887—1953
A FINE RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT.
There is no better known name in
the building industry in Australia
than that of Wunderlich. The found-
ers of the firm were three remarkable
men- —Ernest, Alfred, and Otto Wun-
derlich. and the growth and develop-
ment of the firm has been a living
symbol of their characters and their
outlook on life. They did not go into
business with the one idea of
profit, for their major objectives were
to produce quality articles for the
building industry, to give service, and
to concern themselves with the welfare
of their “co-workers” in the Wunder-
lich offices and factories throughout
Australia.
The great and continued expansion
proves their success in all these av-
enues.
In 1908, 1927, and 1947 attractive
and comprehensive brochures were
produced to illustrate twenty, forty,
and sixty years of Wunderlich industry
respectively.
Today, in every city and in every
town throughout Australasia there are
innumerable examples of Wunderlich’s
craftsmanship. In the cities, it is im-
possible to walk even a few yards
without coming abreast of a Wun-
derlich product such as a metal awn-
ing, ceiling and fascia, a pair of orn-
ate metal doors, a nameplate, memor-
ial or lettering in metal, a show win-
dow, a metal grille, to mention a few
of the predominating examples of
metal'work, either stamped, wrought
or cast, a colourful facade of archi'
tectural terra'cotta or “colourtex”
facing bricks, or a roof of terra-cotta
tiles.
In the suburbs and town and in the
country Wunderlich tile roofed houses
are everywhere, while the pattern of
brickwork is relieved by the lighter
coloured flat surfaced walls of Dura-
bestos homes.
The Wunderlich factory organisa-
tion at present is as follows:
New South Wales—Five Factory
Units.
At Redfern: Architectural and In-
dustrial metal-work.
At Rosehill: Terra-cotta Roofing
Tiles, Architecttural Terra-cotta Fac-
ing. “Durabestos” Asbestos-Cement
Products and Stoneware Pipes and
Fittings.
Victoria—Four Factory Units.
At South Melbourne: Architectural
and Industrial Metalwork.
At Vermont: Terra-cotta Roofing
Tiles.
At Sunshine: Architectural Terra-
cotta Facing and “Durabestos”, As-
bestos-cement Products.
South Australia—Two Factory Units.
At Adelaide: Architectural and In-
dustrial Metalwork.
At Edwardstown: Terra-cotta Roof-
ing Tiles.
Queensland —Four Factory Units.
At Valiev: Architectural and In'
dustrial Metalwork.
At Ferny Grove and Northgatc:
Terra'Cotta Roofing Tiles.
At Gaythorne: “Durabestos” A«'
bestos'cement Products.
Tasmania —Two Factory Units.
At Hobart: Architectural and In'
dustrial Metalwork.
At Launceston: Terra'Cotta Roof'
ing Tiles.
FEELING BLUE—CHOOSE GREY.
One of the industrial wonders of
1953 is the tremendous increase in
the use of grey. From fountain pens
to filing cabinets and cars, export
manufacturers find that, supplies be'
ing. equal, grev'coloured products are
outselling the rest. A London shoe
store doubled its sales after replacing
a large-patterned wine-red carpet
with plain grey. A U.S. airline an'
nounces a drop in air-sickness due to
the “smoothness” of grey upholstery.
In the last two years the craze for
grey, one of the calmest of colours —
has swept round the globe. Now a
Canadian hospital has modernised its

MASTERS OF INDUSTRY
THE WUNDERLICH FAMILY
at Baptist Street, Redfern, Sydney.
On behalf of the Building fraternity we
pay tribute to the Wunderlichs who, from
the time they entered the building in-
dustry, 65 years ago, have done everything
within their power to raise the standard
of all the materials they produced* How
they have succeeded is beyond words to
describe.
Mr. Charles Wunderlich
A MANAGING DIRECTOR
Is a son of Alfred Wunderlich, co-founder of the
Industry and the present Chairman of Directors.
Born at Sydney in 1903 and educated at Sydney
Grammar School, he made several trips abroad
to gain experience and further his interest in
music, especially in Italian Opera and Classical
Concerts. After obtaining some early business
experience with the Atlas Assurance Co. Ltd.,
and Meggitt Limited, he entered the Motor Car
Service Station business on his own account.
In 1941 he joined Wunderlich Limited as Assist-
ant to the Secretary, was made a Director in
1945 and a Managing Director in 1947. Particu-
larly interested in the sales side of the organisa-
tion, he is also extremely popular with the em-
ployees of the Company, and takes an active in-
terest in their sporting activities and welfare.
At present residing at Bellevue Hill, he will
shortly move with his wife, daughter and son to a
property recently purchased at Beauty Point.
A member of the N.S.W, Club and of the Aus-
tralian Golf Club, he also likes to get away from
the city, from time to time, for a few days of
beach fishing.
Mr. Alfred Wunderlich
CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS
Was born in London in 1865 —88 years ago—educated
in Switzerland and associated with the Wunderlich in-
dustry since 1887 as co-founder with his talented brother
Ernest, who died in 1945 at the age of 85. Alfred
Wunderlich, today, as Chairman of Directors of Wun-
derlich Limited, is as actively concerned with the pro-
gress and growth of the Company as in any of the 65
years in which he has consistently played his part in
planning Its destiny. His is not a token Chairmanship;
the office sees him daily and his keen concentration on
the problems that arise sets a standard that is appreciat-
ed and respected by all his associates—for the passing
of time and a full life, has taken little toll of his re-
sources. Under his Chairmanship, Wunderlich Limited
has enlarged, re-planned and re-equipped many of its
factories and erected others to produce an increased
volume of building materials.
Whilst his business interests have been his main con-
cern—apart from his Directorial position with Wunder-
lich Limited, he is a Director also of Meggitt Ltd., Lino-
leum Holdings Ltd., and Federal Match Co.—he found
time during his earlier years to pursue an active public
life. Decorated by the French Government (promoted a
Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur in 1933) for many
years' service to the French community in Australia, he
also served as President of the Associated Chamber of
Manufactures of Australia in 1911 and 1912, having taken
a keen interest in the establishment and welfare of the
N.S.W. Chamber of Manufactures from its Inception in
1895 over which he presided in 1910. He is a life
member of the Executive of the Associated Chambers of
Manufactures of Australia.
Always deeply interested in music, he was for many
years President of the Philharmonic Society and regu-
larly sang in the Chorus. His linguistic attainments com-
prise four modern languages. A member of the N.S.W.
Club and of the Athenaeum Club, Melbourne.

“HOW YOU BENEFIT
FROM ADVERTISING”
One noticeable trend now evidenc-
ed in numerous ways—especially in
the interest taken in a recent B.B.C.
programme on the subject—is the con'
cern of the general public in advertis'
ing, its merits, and its occasional de'
fects.
Undoubtedly, advertising is an ab'
solute essential in present'day com'
merce. The old notion that, if a man
made a better mousetrap than any'
body else, the world would beat a
path to his door, now needs qualify'
ing. The world would only clamour
for that mousetrap if it was advertis'
ed as efficiently as its competitors.
Relying entirely upon an established
name for future business —the restrain'
ed approach so often adopted by es'
tablished firms in the more dignified
days of the Victorian and Edwardian
eras—has scant chance of success in
the face of intensive advertising by
some commercially aggressive rival.
The Cost Does Not Hit
The Customer Hard.
On e consumer'objection to advertis'
ing often heard is that its cost must
appreciably push up the price of
finished products. This is a fallacy
refuted by cold statistics; it has been
shown, time and again, that even
large-scale advertising campaigns may
add only one farthing—or less—to the
price of goods costing perhaps a
couple of shillings or more. But, on
the other hand, if those goods were
not advertised, the manufacturer
might well have to add very much
more than one farthing to the selling
price—because he would almost cer-
tainly sell infinitely fewer goods. Since
substantial sales are prime essentials
in low production costs (and there-
fore low retail prices), advertising is
one valuable factor in keeping down
the cost-of-living.
Bringing The Stores To Your Door.
Another unquestionable service
rendered by centralised advertising, as
in the columns of the newspapers, is
that consumers are enabled to keep
constant check upon new products of
all types. If they had to scour the
shops for such goods, uncertain even
if the type of product they were seek-
ing was actually being made, shopping
would be infinitely more arduous.
Country folk, especially, often far re-
moved from easy reach of big stores,
find advertisement columns invalu-
able in compiling shopping lists.

Mr. Douglas Croudace
A MANAGING DIRECTOR
Was born af Hartlepool, England, educated at Old Fort
Street School, and joined the organisation 49 years ago.
In 1908 he was appointed Secretary of the newly-formed
Wunderlich Limited, transferred to its Adelaide Branch
as Manager in 1911 and returned to its Sydney Head
Office in 1914 as Chief Accountant. In 1930 he again
took up the position of Secretary, subsequently the dual
dole of Secretary-Director, and finally in 1947 the ap-
pointment of Joint Managing Director. His qualifications
—Fellow of the Institute of Cost Accountants and Asso-
ciate of the Institute of Accountants—were of Inestim-
able value in the financial ramifications of the business,
but he has also constantly devoted his abilities to all
other aspects of the organisation, and to its 18 factor-
ies situated throughout the Capital Cities of Australia,
and engaged with the manufacture of Building Materials
in metals, asbestos-cement and burnt clay.
Douglas Croudace's main hobby has always been
"Wunderlich Limited—its products, profits and employ-
ees." His efforts over the years have, in no small meas-
ure, assisted the Company to reach the pre-eminent
position is occupies in the Building Materials manufac-
facturing field to-day.

The end of the cement shortage,
which was confidently foreseen when
restrictions were removed early this
| year, is not yet in sight. Although
| the two local companies are between
| them making more cement than the
total of local and imported supplies
f last year, merchants' orders are still
as far in arrears as they were two
months ago.
When Government backing for the
Adelaide Cement Co. expansion was
being considered, a Parliamentary
Committee accepted an estimate of
about 190,000 tons as the State’s con'
sumption this year. Other estimates
ranged from 160,000 tons to 250,000.
Now a production equal to 200,000
tons a year is falling like snow in the
desert into the accumulated demand
of years, and the quarter-million es'
timate appears correct.
Government use, where imported
cement was previously used, can hard-
ly be blamed for the continued fam'
ine. Shortage of loan funds has, in
fact, held Government use down be'
low the amount previously imported.
Ihis may increase next year, after loan
estimates, based on a more generous
grant, have passed Parliament.
The approaching end of the finan'
dal year has brought a lull in both
State and Commonwealth Govern'
ment work, which has tightened the
pinch on big contractors, some of
whom are tendering for and getting
jobs under five figures. No major
State Government contracts were ah
lotted last month, and Federal works
have brought few big contracts. War
Service Homes contracts, which ceas'
ed temporarily during the month, are
not expected to be allotted again un-
til next month, partly to give an even
programme of construction, and partly
to maintain competitive tendering.
The State’s loan grant of £26,500,'
000 at the Loan Council meeting last
month, although well below the
£40,000,000 sought, will liven up
Government work in the next financial
year. Projects officially announced in-
elude the building of 3,600 new
homes, construction of schools for
18,000 new scholars, completion of
the seven'storev nurses’ home at the
new Western Districts Hospital, and
the use of part of it as a maternity
wing, and accelerated work on the
Mannum'Adelaide pipe line.
This major State work has already
stretched II miles of its 52'mile length
from the Murray at Mannum well into
the foothills above Palmer. Five of
the eight cylindrical reinforced con'
Crete, 2,000,000'ga1. reservoir tanks
have already been completed by the
contractors, G. H. Martin, of Unley,
two at Mannum and three at Palmer.
The 30,000,000'ga1. summit reservoir
will probably be built by the Engin-
eering and Water Supply Department
by day labour.
Tenders are being considered for
the reinforced concrete and brick sup'
erstructure for No. 2 pumping station
at Palmer, and tenders will be called
soon for No. 1 station at Mannum
and No. 3, three miles west of Palmer
in the foothills.

be between 12 and 40 ft. wide, total'

the excavation of about 350,000 cu.

Commonwealth contracts let during
the month include one for the new
Plympton Post Office, which H. J.
Were, of Mailsworth, secured at
£17.777. This building, to be con-
structed on Anzac Highway, will be
one of the most modern and striking'
looking suburban post offices in Ad'
elajde. Single-storey, it is faced with
blue glazed architectural terra-cotta
and cream face bricks.
Work at the new Adelaide airport
at West Beach continues to give con-
tracts to local operators. L H. Lever-
ington’s Greenhill Quarries have the
contract for supplying 20,000 tons of
crushed rock for runway surfacing, at
£16,500. Tenders are being consid-
ered for the erection of a canteen and
store building at the airport.
Tenders closed on June 16 for a
brick terminal building at Port Lin-
coln airport. This will include pas-
senger waiting rooms and toilet facil-
ities, a kiosk and an airlines office.
Work on the S.A. Mines Depart-
ment’s uranium treatment works at
Port Pirie has passed the initial stages,
and piling work is well advanced. Con'
tractors for the piling are Martin Con'
structional Engineers Ltd., of Adeh
aide, a subsidiary of G. H. Martin
Ltd., of Unley. Details, including
the price of the contract, are under
the security ban which shrouds most
uranium work.
Contracts for the buildings them'
selves are being called, and Martins
already have the contract for a pen'
tad'type hangar for a workshop. Tend'
ers closed with the Mines Department
on June 1 for the supply, fabrication
and erection of about 300 tons of mis'
cellaneous structural steelwork for the
plant, and tenders have been called,
closing on June 9, for the design
and supply of materials and labor, for
the erection and setting in operation
of a boiler plant and ancillary equip-
ment.
The S.A. Housing Trust will short'
ly call tenders for about 80 houses,
to be completed within a year, for
letting to technical employees at the
plant. These will be of brick or
other solid construction.
The trust already has two contract'
ors working at Port Pirie, completing
about 50 houses a year between them.
This is only enough to satisfy the lo-
cal demand, and the need for another
80 in a year will force the trust to
seek other builders in the town to
increase the building rate.
Another job of a different kind in
the north has been held up temporar-
ily by difficulty in getting tenders be'
cause of a local lack of red bricks, or'
iginally specified for the work. This
is the erection of a new Flying Doctor
base at Port Augusta, comprising a
residence, workshop, radio room and
office, of single-storey standard con'
struction. A tender is, however, ex'
pected soon, with a change to the
use of concrete bricks, which can be
made on the job. Caradoc Ashton,
Fisher, Woodhead and Beaumont
Smith are the architects.
This firm has closed tenders for a
store and amenities building at Gepps
Cross abattoirs, of single'storey red'
brick construction, with concrete
floors and asbestos cement roof. Ac'
ceptance by the Abattoirs Board is
expected soon.
The largest single contract let in
Adelaide for some time went last
month to the Perry Engineering Co.
The contract, worth £205,000, is for
two aerial cableways for the Queens'

Commission’s Tinaroo Falls dam in

£50,000, for a two-storeyed school,
with six classrooms, assembly hall
and residence for the teaching broth-
ers, to be built at Beverley for the
Society of Missionaries of the Sacred
Heart, Hindmarsh. The same firm
secured a contract, at £lO,OOO, for a
smaller school at Brighton for the
Catholic Church Endowment Society.
H. H. Tory is the architect in each
case.
A contract, at £10,500, for a new
convent school at Barmera, the nu-
cleus of a unit including a church and
presbytery, has been let to T. C.
Moritz, a local contractor. The de-
sign includes an oratory, giving em-

building, in contrast to the making-
over of older buildings which often
marks new church activity in a dis-
trict. The new building will over-
look Lake Bonney near the town. E.
A. Keal is the architect.
Tenders closed on June 8 for the
first completely self-contained blood
bank building for the Red Cross in
Adelaide. The work involves the
renovation and alteration of an old
house on the eastern side of the city,
once a doctor s residence and now an

WORLD-FAMOUS ‘ROCKBESTOS’
CABLES AND FLEXIBLES
TO BE MANUFACTURED
IN AUSTRALIA
By Cable Makers Australia Pty. Ltd.
The recent announcement released
bv Cable Makers Australia Pty. Ltd.
to the effect that the world'famous
‘Rockbestos’ Cables and Flexibles were
new being produced in their modern
Liverpool plant has aroused wide'
spread interest throughout the trade.
Recognised for many years as being
one of the most outstanding products
of their kind, their production in Aus'
tralia marks a noteworthy contribu'
tion to the cable'making industry of
Australia and forms a welcome addh
tion to the already extensive range of
quality wires, flexibles and cables now
being manufactured by the progres'
sive Cable Makers Australia Pty Ltd.
organisation.
“We are manufacturing these asbes'
tos insulated cables and flexibles under
exclusive licence from the Rockbestos
Products Corporation, Connecticut,
U.5.A.,” said Mr. M. Dillon, Secre'
tary of Cable Makers Australia Pty.
Ltd. recently, “and plan to produce
them in a wide variety of types and
constructions to meet every need of
Australia’s rapidly expanding indus'
tries.”
Specially processed to withstand
high temperature heat, the asbestos in'
sulation that is a feature of Rockbes'
tos cables and flexibles is formed by
a patented process into a firm, dense
and permanently flexible insulation
that is thoroughly impregnated with
heat and moisture'proof cements. The
construction of this insulating wall is
such that it has no laps, joints or
seams, and is impervious to deteriora'
tion from heat, fume oil, grease, age
or vibration. Although Cable Makers
Australia Pty. Ltd. plan to manufac'
ture many types of Rockbestos cables
and flexibles. three constructions are
standardised and merit individual men'
tion. These are:- —-
1. C.M.A. Rockbestos Heater Cord
Flexibles, which consist of a standard
range of tinned copper conductors in-
sulated with special heat'resistant rub'
ber dielectric, plus an additional asbes'
tos insulation. These are particularly
recommended for all electrical ap'
pliances where the ordinary rubber
flex shows deterioration from heat.
Thev are also suitable for leads to
small motors, pendants, and street
lights where the flexibles are subject
to heat from the lamps.
2. Rockbestos A.V.C. Cables. This
construction, originally developed and
natented by the Rockbestos Products
Corporation, consists of an insulation
in which varnished cambric is incor'
porated between two layers of felted
asbestos. It has a high dielectric
strength, but in view of the limiting

THE HISTORY OF TILE
Man’s comfort and the beauty of his surroundings have been enhanced since
prehistoric times by the making of tile, the handicraft recognised as a mature
art some 5000 years ago.
By WILLIAM BUCK
Egypt.
At the dawn of history, in 3000
8.C., a Pharaoh of Egypt believed that
his soul, after death, would spend its
days blissfully riding on the light of
heaven along with the sun. When not
so engaged he would want a home
safe from marauders, so he construct'
ed the Step Pyramid with chambers at
its heart to which he expected to re'
turn intermittently throughout eternity.
He decorated these rooms in the most
beautiful material available, glazed tile
in clean blues, yellows and reds. The
chambers proved secure from all
visitors except the archaeologists, and
when they were opened thousands of
years later the tile was as shining and
handsome as the day it was set.
Little remains of the tile set before
the Pharaoh’s time, but it is clear that
tile handicraft was then a mature art.
There were tile and glazed brick
facings in Crete, in the Abusir Pyra'
mid of Neterkhet, on the Ishtar Gate
and in the decorations of the Proces'
sional Street in Babylon. Roofing
tiles on prehistoric Greek temples were
so fundamentally right that such tiles
are made in exactly the same shapes
to'day.
China.
The Chinese developed their own
styles in tile roofing and were particu'
larly fond of ornamenting hips and
ridges with elaborate, grotesque, jocu'
lar dragons of brilliant yellow and
black tile. Centuries ago the Japanese
used a roofing tile in grey silver lustre,
and mosaic tiled floors appear in
Roman remains from Britain to Persia.
During Europe’s long depression, the
Middle Ages, only the Persians sup'
ported the tile arts in the high fashion.
They learned the secret of applying a
metallic lustre glaze of blues, reds and
yellows touched with fire, and they
perfected a relief tile on which they
pictured native life and legend. Some
of the’ir old wall tiles still adorn the
shrines of Bagdad and Damascus.
“The Continent.”
In Spain, the Saracenic Moors
created a new tradition in tile and pot'
tery handicraft known as Hispano'
Moresque, which is still in use to'day.
Some of the feats of imagination
created in this luxurious spirit of tile,
the Alhambra, the Alcazar, the Cuarto
Real, belong with the very greatest art.
In hot Spain, the Moors built for cool'
ness. They loved running water and
fountains, and it is easy to see why
tiles became an ornament in private
homes for the first time in history.
In the sixteenth century, Nurem'
berg, Germany, created stoves deco'
rated in glazed fancy tiles. The
Nuremberg stove is still made in cem
tral Europe to'day. Later, Delft, Hob
land, initiated another trend with its
delft tile—white, glazed squares, hand'
painted with lively human figures or
landscapes in delicate blue and violet
brown. They were charming in a folk
style and became the vogue in Eng'
land and the American colonies for
fireplace adornment.
America.
Another event in tile history was
the entry of North American indus'
try to the field. In Pittsburgh, in
1876, Samuel Keys started the first
clay tile factory in the United States,
and the American Encaustic Tiling
Company opened its first factory soon
afterwards. These ventures succeeded,
and so encouraged the development of
other enterprises, but by 1900 the total
product of the industry was only
2.000. dollars a year. The increase
of building which began in 1919 fur'
ther widened the demand for tile.
Bv 1929 there were 75 companies
in the United States, and national pro'
duction of clay floor and wall tile had
climbed to 29,000,000 dollars annual'
ly. The economic depression of the
1930’s caused some contraction of tile
production, but since 1935 figures
have risen steadily to the record year
of 1951, when 45 companies made
148.000. square feet of tile.
During World War II tile plants
made tile for ships, hospitals, defence,
housing and war plants. Clay tile has
certain assets which are invaluable in
laboratories and other workshops. It
is chemically inert, waterproof and
cleans easily. Wall tile never wears
out or loses its brightness. This is
one reason why there are 9,000,000
square feet of tile in New York City
subways. Tile fits well into modern
decoration, and in many homes there
are tile window seats and living'room
floors warmed by radiant heat.

(continued from page 71)
Fashion and utility are of primary im-
portance. Now there are schools
which teach tile setting.
Modem Tile Plant
in U.S.A.
A visit to a modern tile plant is a
worthwhile experience for anyone.
The first thing a visitor may notice is
that the earthy raw materials of tile—
clays, prophyllite, talc, feldspar and
flint, all except ball clay—often arrive
as loose powder. A man snakes a
large hose into the mixture, and by
vacuum the hose eats it up. Vacuum
ventilators are installed in many places
m the plant where dust might fly; a
modern tile factory is as clean as a
bakery.
There are three prevailing methods
of shaping tile. The most common
and the most interesting is the dust
press method. This begins at the
hoppers -under the great steel bins
where the vacuum has stored the
powdered clay. In a large plant, a
batch car, looking like a huge, squarish
kitchen refrigerator, creeps along on
rails under the bins and collects so
many pounds and so many ounces of
each material to insure a properly
composed mixture.
Chemical Contents.
Formulas vary widely, but most
tiles are compounds of three parts:
(1) Plastics, which are chiefly clays
and contribute bonding power; (2)
fillers, such as kaolins or flint (silica),
which contribute stability and rigidity,
particularly in the fire; and (3) a flux,
such as feldspar (aluminium silicate),
which melts and fuses the heat-resisting
elements into a solid piece. The latest
formulas also incorporate prophyllite
(a hydrous aluminium silicate) or talc
(a hydrous magnesium silicate).
There are clays which, alone or mixed
with other distinct clays, make excel-
lent tiles, but these are mostly un-
glazed tiles in the natural fired colours
of red, brown and buff. Generally,
tiles have a white body.
Mechanised Processing.
The batch car unloads its burden of
weighing tons, into a “blun-
ger” with a measured amount of
water. The blunger churns it into a
cream-like pabulum called “slip,” the
body of the tile. The slip then goes
through a sieve to remove natural
impurities, and through a magnetised
honeycomb which holds out primitive
iron. Next the water must be squeez-
°r t ' This is done in some plants
in a filter press, in others on a curious
pair of drums, as tall as corn cribs,
one steel, the other wood. The pro-
cess is not easy to visualise. What the
visitor sees at first is a row of what
appear to be revolving, mud-covered
barrels. The wooden cylinder is lite-
rally wrapped in a vacuum. A belt of
strings runs between the two drums
and turns them slowly. Under the
wooden drum there is a tub of liquid
slip and, as the drum revolves into
slip, by vacuum it picks up a coating
of clay one-eighth of an inch deep
and ten feet wide.
The belt of strings, also ten feet
wide, carries this blanket of slip away
and wraps it around the steel drum.
The strings pass between porcelain
teeth, which strip off the clay, and it
drops, looking now rather like small
brown flakes, on to a belt conveyor.
The squeezing vacuum and the trip
around the steel barrel have dried the
slip to a moisture content of 8 to 10
per cent. Some tile-makers have
found this drying method too baulky
and difficult for their taste and have
turned to other practices, the filter
press or a new-fashioned kind of dry
mix.
Tile Presses.
Tile presses are as marvellous to
watch as anything in the plant. They
fall as lightly as a butterfly, bearing
70 tons. A hopper drops the clay,
now a coarse powder, on to a steel
plate; a blade pushes and jiggles it
over multiple steel dies; the press de-
scends, swiftly, neatly, with its pres-
sure of 4000 pounds per square inch,
and the blade nudges the pressed tile
on to a conveyor—all in a wink' of
time.
In a fully-mechanised plant, except
perhaps for the man with the vacuum
and the button-pusher on the batch
taxi, the chances are that a visitor will
see few workers. The process is
almost wholly automatic.
Leaving the press, the tile moves by
gravity past an inspector and then, in
many plants, through a metal tunnel
in which it receives a shower of liquid
glaze. This dries before it reaches
the next worker, who stacks the tile in
a setter or sagger, both of which are
ceramic kiln racks. With this fast sys-
tern of applying the glaze only one
firing is necessary. The glaze is sim-
ply glass made of clay compounds
such as flint, feldspar and ball clay,
and coloured by various mineral
oxides, of lead, tin, zinc, uranium or
cobalt. In tile work, uranium oxide
produces yellow; cobalt creates blues
and blacks.
Far behind the dust-press method of
shaping in general use comes the “stiff
mud” process. Quarries the com'
mon, unglazed, reddish floor tiles and
some others are made by this pro-
cess. Stiff mud” tells the story. The
body, holding around 25 per cent,
water, i s extruded as one might
squeeze paste from a tube, and cut
off at the proper length with a wire.
Faience tiles, a highly - decorated
variety, are made by the full plastic
or hand-moulded method, using an
even wetter clay.
Tunnel Kilns.
All production lines in most plants
converge upon a tunnel, which repre-
sents a revolution in the manufacture
of tile. A few years ago all tile was
fired in periodic kilns; the kiln was
filled and bricked tight; the fires were
lit and kept burning for three or four

(Top) FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IN
FLOOR TILING.
One of the oldest products has been
combined in this room with one of the
newest—the plywood wall panel. For
more than 5,000 years tile has been
used as a building and decorative ma-
terial for buildings. The utilization of
modern methods in tile production has
increased its availability in many parts
of the world.
(Bottom) MOSAIC ALTAR PANEL.
The making of tile is one of mankind's
oldest handicrafts and has been used
for more than 50 centuries to beautify
and make more comfortable both his
dwellings and his public buildings. Al-
though modern technology has made the
production of tile less laborious today,
little can be added to its beauty.

days, and then the kiln was given a
week to cool. To'day, the tile sim'
ply rides on steel cars through a tun'
nel in less than 24 hours. The tun'
nel, heated usually by gas, reaches
about 2000 degrees Fahrenheit mid'
way in the trip; the tile can warm up
and cool slowly. Midway, both the
rack and the tile appear almost tram
sparent with white heat and the air in
the tunnel seems to hurry with violent,
dazzling light. When one car enters
the kiln, another pops out at the
finished end.
Aside from the economy in time,
the tunnel kiln has many advantages.
The steady heat saves much fuel, much
wear and tear on the kiln structure.
There is a huge saving in the labour
of loading and unloading. The tern'
perature control turns out a better
product. In the final inspection, girls
with nimble fingers test the war for
blemishes and colour blending, while
machines with more accuracy test for
warpage and size. This is an impor'
tant spot, for there are few secrets in
tile manufacture, and one of the best
ways a factory can produce a superior
product is by better inspection.
In the laboratory of any modern tile
plant technicians test all raw materials
as they arrive, and every day examine
samples of tile and mix collected from
every stage of manufacture, using all
the powers of science.

DEATH OF MR. FRED. WILSON
Many Tributes Paid To His Memory.
The death occurred on Sunday, June 14, of Mr. Fred. Wilson, 0.8. E., F.A.1.8.,
after a lifetime of outstanding and distinguished service to the Australian
Building Industry.
Mr. Wilson passed away at the com'
paratively early age of 65 in the Sea'
combe Hospital, Drummoyne, after a
brief illness. He leaves a wife. and
two sons.
Many Achievements.
Fred. Wilson, who was perhaps one
of Australia’s best' known master
builders, and certainly one of the best'
known battlers for the advancement of
the building industry, had many
achievements to his credit.
His North of England temperament
and tenacity was his proud birthright,
as he often said, for he had come up
the hard way, serving his apprentice'
ship as a carpenter and joiner in New'
castle'upon'Tyne. The things he learn'
ed in that rugged school of experience
became part of his honest, forthright
character, and moulded the man as we
knew and respected him in later years.
Fred. Wilson came to Australia over
40 years ago, and he won full recog'
nition of his services to the building
industry when his name appeared in
the first Honours List of Queen Eliza'
beth 11, and he was created an Officer
of the Most Excellent Order of the
British Empire.
Sneaking of the honour, he said:
“Naturally, I feel very proud to be
the recipient of such an honour, but
I feel that this is not just an honour
conferred upon me personally but a
tribute to those great organisations
with which I have been previleged to
work for many years.
“No man could have better or more
satisfying reward than the esteem of
his fellows, and, moreover,, no man
can compile a record of achievement
unless he has enjoyed the guidance
and help of his colleagues.”
Mr. Wilson had served as President
of the Master Builders’ Federation of
Australia, President of the Master
Builders’ Association of N.S.W., Coum
cillor of the Employers’ Association,
Councillor of The Royal Agricultural
Society and the University of Tech'
nology, among other activities. At
the time of his death he was President

of the Building Industry Congress of
N.S.W. for the 11th year.
Among his many other activities,
Mr. Wilson was Vice-Chairman of the
Sydney Technical Education District
Council and a member of the Com-
monwealth Immigration Planning
Committee.
Institute of Builders.
Mr. Wilson was also a principal
mover in the formation of The Aus-
tralian Institute of Builders, which
was founded in 1951. He became its
Charter President, and marshalled the
full scope of his energies and en-
thusiasm to launch the Institute suc-
cessfully.
8.1. C. Tribute.
“It was Fred. Wilson’s firm convic-
tion that every man should put some-
thing back into the industry from
which he gains a livelihood,” the
Executive Director of the 8.1. C., Mr.
D. Stewart Fraser, said in an eloquent
tribute.
“Fred. Wilson most of all recognised
the need for younger men to take up
the work-tools which their seniors laid
down owing to advancing years.
“Because of this belief, Mr. Wilson
took a. very deep and active interest
in Technical Education,” Mr. Fraser
added.
“His outstanding achievement was
undoubtedly his leadership of the
8.1. C. through eleven difficult years.
“He worked extraordinarily hard
and enthusiastically to weld all sections
of the building industry together for
the common good.”
At the time of his death, Mr. Wilson
was a director of Howie, Moffat
Company, one of Sydney’s largest con-
tracting organisations.
Funeral Service.
The funeral, which left the Pres-
byterian Church, Drummoyne, on June
16th for the Northern Suburbs Crema-
torium, was conducted by the Very
Rev. A. Campbell-Grieve, 8.A. % who
had long been a personal friend of the
late Mr. Wilson.

During the service, he paid an
eloquent tribute to Mr. Wilson’s many
sterling qualities, both as a Master
Builder and as a man.
“There remains the task of honour'
ing his memory by striving to carry
on his work by endeavouring to bet'
ter the industry he Ipved so well,’’ he
added.

stitute of Builders, in the Federal and

Mr. Wilson belonged.
UNDERGROUND GASIFICATION
OF COAL.
After four years of extensive expert
ments made by the Bureau of Mines
at Gorgas, Alabama, it has been proved
that coal—as it lies underground—can
be changed to a gas suitable for driv-
ing gas turbines and generating steam.
A second detailed report on the pro'
ject was recently made.
During one experiment, two gas
turbines were installed and operated
for 100 hours on combustible gases
captured from the burning coal. The
energy produced by the turbines was
used to compress air and send it back
underground to the gasification sys'
tern. In commercial operations, this
excess energy would be produced for
useful purposes. Further tests may
prove the feasibility of producing
gases for conversion to synthetic liquid
fuels or chemicals.
The first series of experiments was
conducted between January 21 and
March 12, 1947, jointly by the Bureau
of Mines and the Alabama Power
Company. The early tests merely es-
tablished that coal could be gasified as
it lay in the ground, and that the
burning could be controlled.

The second series of tests was con'
ducted between March 18, 1949, and
February 7, 1951. During 22 months
of continuous operation, 10,485 tons
of coal—underlying almost two acres —
were gasified. There appears to be no
limit to coal areas from which com'
bustible gases can be obtained.
Over a four'month period, when
65 % of the heating value of the coal
consumed in one area was utilised, the
energy yield was greater than could
have been obtained —under existing
mining methods —from the .coal min'
able from the same area. During one
eight'hour period, combustible gas
with a heating value of 90 Btu
(British thermal units) per cubic foot
was produced at a rate of 9.4 million
cubic feet per day. When new inlets
and outlets were driven near the burn'
ing coal faces, gases having calorific
values of 75 to 150 Btu per cubic
foot were produced.
In the first series of experiments,
entries were driven from the outcrop
into overburden averaging 30ft., while
those in the second project averaged
150 ft. below the surface. In the first
experiment, the entries extended only
150 ft.; in the second, 1540 ft. Since
such gasification is still in the experi'
mental state, no definite economic
evaluation is offered in the report.
However, provided technical aspects
are feasible, underground gasification
of coal can be applied in three ways:
(1) Complete combustion of coal
underground with air, and
utilisation of the heat energy in
gas turbines or in raising steam;
(2) Production of producer gas
with air, and utilisation of the
combustible gas in gas turbines;
(3) Production of synthesis gas by
gasification of coal with oxygen
and steam, and use of the gas
in the manufacture of synthetic
liquid fuels or organic chemi'
cals.
Further experiments are to be con'
ducted at Gorgas, where a new instab
lation is being constructed which
features a series of electrodes for pass'
ing electric current through the coal
seam to open passages for air and
gases. The proposed bed to be tested
covers larger areas, with resultant
greater distances between outcrops.
It is expected that the new system will
reduce the leakage which hampered
both of the previous experiments.
The new electric system reduces site'
development costs and virtually elimi'
nates all underground labour.

tions 4808, “The Second Under'

a bitter struggle with Charles Harri'

Gould bought the Denver and Rio

he strengthened his lines by construct'

the Pennsylvania Railroad. Caught in

The majority of homes today require a garage and consequently the planning and location of this unit
in the whole scheme is of considerable importance. All these examples emphasise the very fact.
Three utilise the garge as a separate unit but attached to the main bouse in various ways-roofed,
walled, etc.-to achieve scale and an affect of space. This point is particularlu emphasised in the
bottom left where the long low-lying roof line is achieved by extending the roof of the house over
the intervening space between house and garege. The bottom right plan was the "car-port" or
pen parking space as distinct from the lock-up garage. All the paths are laid out to lead to,
hand well define, the entrance door.
