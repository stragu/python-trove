For normal work the standards are
placed in pairs 3' 3" apart (to pro-

ards), the distance between pairs
being 6 to 10 feet, according to
local regulations. Lifts are spaced
approximately every 6 feet to give

along scaffold.
Bracing is required to make the
scaffold rigid and ties into the face

THE MODERN HOME IS A GAS HOME
Jcji
COOKING . . . Only gas gives you such even heat at
low cost —quickly controlled at the touch of a tap. Gas
ranges cost much less—are cooler, safer, last longer and
are more dependable. That is why more people in Sydney
cook with gas than any other fuel.
REFRIGERATION . . . Only gas gives you refrigerators
that last a lifetime. They have no motors or moving parts.
This makes them silent, wear free and repair free. Thermo-
static control gives the temperature you wish. Special
reduced rate for gas used.
n
*
WINTER WARMTH . . . Only gas gives you controlled
warmth —a cheerful glow that fills the whole room
instantly. A gas fire gives you exact heat . . . turn it up or
down to suit yourself. No work, no worry, and it's so easy
to change to a gas fire.
HOT WATER . . . Only gas gives you hot water all the
time for all the family. You can turn on all the hot taps
in the house at the same time with a gas hot water system
and there will still be hot water to spare. Gas never lets
you down.
EFFICIENCY
ts the reason why
GAS COSTS LESS
Gas is the efficient, willing servant in 400,000 Sydney homes. In Bathrooms, Lounges, Kitchens,
Laundries—and in every room where gas can be used—it does a better, cheaper job. Gas gives
you hot water all the time for your bath, shower, shave, dish washing, cleaning and clothes
washing. Gas warms your rooms, does all your cooking, and gives you perfect, trouble-free
refrigeration. The price of gas here is amongst the lowest in the world for manufactured gas.
Despite increased costs in all commodities, your gas company's modem planning and production
methods have kept the price down.

BUILDING STABILITY
The Building Industry Congress of N.S.W. is an important body in the com'
munity, for it comprises a representative cross'section of one of the nation's major
industries. Thus when at the Annual Meeting its President, Mr. S. D. C. Ken'
nedy, expressed several opinions as to what should be done to keep the industry
healthy, these warrant careful examination.
Like all responsible people connected with the industry, he is concerned with
the question of costs, and on this subject Mr. Kennedy said;
“Even prosperity has its problems—Australia faces a bright future with an
inadequate labour force. The effort to cope short'handed with an expanding
economy is a costly business. High costs are dangerous, even for key industries.
Congress took a leading part in the fight for economic stability, and I believe that
our principal job in the year ahead is to plan and work for the maintenance of
stability.”
To expand the labour force in the building industry is no easy problem, for
it would seem that the recruiting of local labour and apprentices is only sufficient
to maintain the present numbers, and therefore the solution would appear to be
an infusion of new strength from other sources. Such is the opinion of Congress,
and so through its President, who is a member of the Immigration Planning Coun'
cil, it has pressed for an intensive drive to recruit skilled tradesmen from Britain
and Europe.
Realising, however, that many migrants are reluctant to leave their existing
homes and country without being assured of suitable accommodation in their new
land, Congress has recommended that special provisions for the housing of build'
ing tradesmen must be made. “The only way,” says Mr. Kennedy, “to secure
the kind of people we want is to assure them that there is a home at the end of
the road —and it must not be too long a road.”
This is all good sound commonsense, and it is sincerely to be hoped that the
efforts of the Building Industry Congress —which, in view of its representative
structure, can be assumed to reflect the wishes of the whole building industry—
will be fruitful, for otherwise the country will find once again that “to cope short'
handed” with an expanding economy is indeed a costly business. The industry
and the public cannot afford another inflationary cost spiral, for it could be disastrous
to both the builders and the people whom they wish to serve.

OUR COVER ILLUSTRATION:
NEW QANTAS BUILDING
SIXTEEN FLOORS: AIR-CONDITIONED.
Tenders Being Called.
Tenders are being called for the
Qantas office block, to be erected on
the corner of Hunter Street and the
proposed Elizabeth Street extension.
It will have sixteen floors eleven
above ground and a sub-basement,
basement, lower ground, ground, and
mezzanine floors.
Its height above ground will be
right to the 150 feet limit imposed
by the City Council.
The building will have a gross
floor area of 171,436 square feet, of
which 104,697 square feet will be
office working area and the balance
sub-basement, basement, passages,
straiwells, toilets and other service
areas.
Westminster Hall Contract Let for £529,934
Interesting Curved Facade.
The shape of the building will con'
form with the curve of the proposed
Elizabeth Street extension, the curve
providing a relief for the simply pro-
portioned repetitive facade treatment.
The materials used in the facade
will be mainly glass and aluminium,
with a surround of sandstone and
ground floor columns in polished
granite.
A light-well in the rear of the
building increases in width towards
the northern end of the block. This
will allow maximum penetration of
light to all floors.
The underground floor areas pro-
vide machinery rooms, record storage,
filing space, stores for uniforms and
other equipment, and garage space
for 35 cars.
The ground floor will have three
entrances at varying levels and will
be used mainly as a booking hall.
There will also be a theatrette on
the ground floor. Upper floors will
be used to accommodate all Oantas
staff, with the exception of those now
located at the Wentworth Hotel
terminal.
Air-Conditioning.
Provision has been made for air-
conditioning the office areas with a
system of Frenger ceiling pipe to take
hot or refrigerated water behind sup-
porting metal acoustic tiles. This
will be supplemented by conditioned
air to provide a maximum tempera-
ture variation between 70 degrees and
75 degrees, with outside temperatures
ranging from 45 degrees to 90
degrees.
Architects are Rudder, Littlemore
and Rudder.
Architects’ Indemnity
Insurance
The N.S.W. Chapter of the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects has
been negotiating wi h insurance
brokers for the development of a
master policy to cover claims on its
members.
P is understood that if a minimum
of twenty participate, such a policy
could be introduced. Premiums for
individual cases would depend on the
number of participants and amount of
indemnity would be based on num-
ber of staff employed.
PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY.
When a professional dies, the words
“professional integrity” is frequently
used in his memorial. Professionals
invariably die poor, but they get an
acclaim whilst on this plane that no
money can buv.
“Professional integrity was his
portion in life.”
Could any man die richer than to
merit such a memorial as this?
A contract amounting to £529,934 has been let to John Grant & Sons Pty Ltd
for the erection of Westminster Hall, in Phillip Street, Sydney. Architects are
Rudder, Littlemore and Rudder,

Montgomery Rehabilitation and Amenities Pavilion
WAR VETERANS’ HOME, NARRABEEN, SYDNEY.
The War Veterans 1 Home at Narrabeen, Sydney, is an organisation that is very
near and dear to the heart of every Australian, for it was conceived to provide care
and shelter for those who have served their country well in two World Wars. Those
responsible for its foundation and development showed great initiative in acquiring
such a fine stretch of Australian bushland overlooking Narrabeen Lakes for the
building of this Home and haven for tired and disabled soldiers. There is peace and
serenity in the everlasting mutations of Nature.
New units have continually
been added over the years, and
the latest is perhaps one of the
most ambitious, this being officially
known as the Montgomery
Rehabilitation and Amenities
Pavilion, which takes its name
from Viscount Montgomery of
Alamein, who, when in Australia,
laid the foundation stone.
It is a most important building,
in that it provides facilities for
those who reside at the Home to
have healthy exercise and essential
social contact with their fellows,
as well as providing, in the
Theatre, means for those good
people whose great pleasure it is
to entertain their erstwhile
warriors.
Beautiful Bushland
Setting.
This new building is beautifull /
situated in what may be described
as a setting of natural Australian
bushland, and it was a particular
instruction to the architects that
the natural bushland should be
visible through the building and
all round it.
Building For Pleasure.
Built along the southern side
and around the south'west corner
of a bowling green, it is of strik'
ing appearance and though not
readily seen from the public
road, it merits closer examina'
tion. It is a building erected for
pleasure, and it carries an air of
openness and lightness which fits
this purpose.
The main portion is construct'
ed with a reinforced concrete
frame on two levels. The upper
level coincides with that of the
bowling rink and includes the
cafetaria'type restaurant, kitchens,
change'rooms, and rooms for the
storage of sporting equipment.
Underneath this are an open
garage and storerooms approached
from the rear.
The facade of the restaurant
has a northern aspect and faces
directly along the bowling greens.
The completely glazed front is
divided into zigzag bays which
may be thrown open at intervals
right along the front.
Bnc\ and Stone W alls.
The external walls are con'
structed of brickwork laid in gar'
den wall bond, using a mixture of
light'brown, buff and cream
colours. An exception to this is
the northernmost wall of the
theatre, which is clad with sand'
stone. The photographs were
taken before this stone wall was
finished and s to complete the pic'
ture, it is necessary to imagine it
carrying a bronze plaque or
decoration of symbolic character
centred over the main entrance
doors under the concrete hood.
Colour Freely Used.
Colour has been used through'
out with freedom and accentuates
the structure; thus in the restau'
rant the ceiling panels between
beams are medium turquoise blue,
whilst the beams and columns are
Continued Overleaf.

pinky-brown. In this area the
floor is constructed with Dunlop
Semastic tiles nearly white in
colour but interspersed with occa-
sional jet black.
Black is used again on one wall
of the curved staircase leading
down to the theatre hall and on
the row of five columns across
its northern end. These black
columns stand against a lime
green wall and support a honey-
comb of brickwork, in each recess
of which a small piece of Cane-ite
has been placed for acoustic
reasons. The ceiling of the hall
is coloured faint lilac, but just
below it is a strong open grid of
oiled Oregon carrying scattered
rectangles variously coloured with
yellow, blue, red, and white.
The Theatre.
With the exception of the pro-
scenium wall, which matches the
ceiling, the walls of the hall are
constructed of brickwork to
match the outside, and details
and trimming are painted cocoa-
brown. The stage curtain is gun
metal grey velvet, and seating is
duralumin - framed covered with
very light grey plastic.
The bright yellow tubular
metal balustrades on the steps at
either extremity of the stage
make a bright note of contrast.
The stage is fully equipped for
cinematograph or theatricals and
behind, at a lower level, are the
usual dressing rooms and toilets.
The floor level of the theatre
is reached by a curved stair from
the restaurant. It is mechanically
heated and ventilated.
O urved Aluminium Roof. L
The roof of the theatre is
covered with Fural patent alu-
minium sheeting supplied by
U.M.E.C. Pty. Ltd, which mate-
rial was thoroughly examined
overseas by the architects before
it was accepted. The nearly-flat
roofs to the remainder, of the
building are constructed with a
concrete slab sheeted with an im-
pervious membrane of bitumen-
impregnated asbestos laid in hot
bitumen and finished with a
covering of concrete slabs.
The Architects for the building
were Fowell, Mansfield Mac-
lurcan; Consulting Engineers,
Messrs. Woolacott, Hale & Bond,
and the Builder was Mr. E.
Spring Brown.
Development of U.S.
Shopping Centres
To Combat Traffic Congestion.
In a recent address before the Mel-
bourne Rotary Club, the Executive
Director of the Building Industry
Congress of Victoria, Mr. John
O’Keeffe, summed up impressions
gathered during his overseas tour
with the Australian Building Pro-
ductivity Team.
In his remarks, Mr. O’Keeffe said:
“Perhaps I should explain that T
do not intend to deal with the find-
ings of the Building Industry Pro-
ductivity Team as to how we can
reduce costs or improve the output of
building. In due time the opinions of
the Team will be published. I have
no doubt that its recommendations
will arouse much interest. The Report
will cover many suggestions whereby
greater efficiency in production could
be achieved.
“I propose to tell you something of
a trend in the transplacement of retail
business which is taking place in
America. I think it will be of inter-
est to Rotarians as leaders in their
respective spheres of business or pro-
fessional activity. It is you, gentle-
men, who must take the lead in
granoling with many of our economic
problems.
“My observations overseas were
directed towards those matters which
were likelv to have a direct or in-
direct bearing on the welfare of the
Building Industry and thus on rhe
State or National economy of this
country.
U.S. Shopping: Centres.
“I therefore selected as the subject
matter of this address ‘The Develop-

ment of Shopping Centres in Ameri-
ca,’ which is taking place as a result
of traffic congestion.
“Two years ago, the Secretary,
Chicago Plan Commission, said:
“ ‘The disintegration o fthe typi-
cal trading centre has been accelerated
during the past decade by the institu-
tion of a new type of commercial
facility the modern shopping
centre.’
“We in Australia are not fully
aware of the transplacement which has
taken place in American city retail
business due to the effects of expan-
sion of the automobile industry. The
effect in some cities of the United
States has been apparently cata-
strophic.
“In the words of Frank C. Balfour,
of the Californian Division of High-
ways:
“ ‘The traffic situation in the
Metropolitan areas of San Francisco
and Los Angeles has reached such a
critical condition that the established
central business districts are in a con-
tinuing state of stagnation and
deterioration.’
That expression may appear some-
what exaggerated. Having witnessed
the evident change in some cities of
America. I would say the words of
Mr. Balfour do not appear to have
been badly chosen:
“ ‘W e know business is important:
it is the life-blood of any city; it
creates the economic base and the
means of financing any readjustment
which the automobile is making com-
pulsory: it deserves much considera-
tion.’
Quoting figures concerning the
US. motor industry, Mr. O’Keeffe
said America is producing 5,000,000
to 7,000,000 cars a year, and is scrap-
ping some 2.000,000 to 3,000,000 a
year The U.S. has 52,000,000 cars
on the road; by 1964 some 65,000,000
will be on American roads.
Los Angeles has five cars to every
four people, he added.
The Answer.
The Americans appear to have
the answer to the question of how to
combat the increasing congestion of
city traffic. According to the Secre-
tary of the Chicago City Plan Com-
l£ bas Seen answered by
building compact clusters of stores
and in large numbers, usually with
extensive off-street parking space.’
He believes: ‘There is every indica-
tion that this trend will continue, both
111 built-up inlying and in vacant
suburban locations,’ such as:
• “ Lakewood Centre Southern Cali-
forn i a, a 300,000,000 - dollar
(£A. 123,800,000) scheme 12 miles
S.E. of Los Angeles. It is a satel-
lite city to accommodate over
75,000, and was constructed as one
project with private capital. The
project embraces 15,000 homes,
plus 550 acres for apartment
houses and multiple dwellings, and
includes grammar and high schools,
medical, dental and recreational
centres. The business site, of 154
acres, has 20,000,000 dollars
(<£A. 8,920,000) worth of retail
stores, with parking areas for
14.000 cars.
• “Stonestown, San Francisco, of 67
acres, with 25 acres for housing
apartments; balance for shopping,
with free parking for 2600 cars.
300.000 people live within a four'
mile radius. In effect, a city bush
ness community transferred to a
residential area. There is an under-
ground tunnel at Stonestown, 16ft.
below street level, for carrying sup-
plies of merchandise to the stores.
• Evergreen Plaza, Chicago, covers
23 acres and parks 2200 cars, with
a double-deck project to hold an
additional 1500 cars. The Plaza is
a supermarket, where shoppers are
sheltered from weather, and a con-
veyor system takes parcels to the
pick-up station in the parking
area.
• “Park Forest. South Chicago, a
completely planned, built, and
privately-financed undertaking, with
an ultra-modern Holiday Theatre,
parking areas for 3000 cars, and
sites for some 100 stores A
1.500,000-dollar (£A.669,000) High
School is to be built.”
Business Branches Out.
Mr. O’Keeffe added:
“In bold, characteristic fashion,
America has transplanted a great deal
of its cities’ retail trade. Business in'
terests had to do it. The enterprising
reader was quick to grasp what the
lack of parking facilities was doing to
his business. He has branched out
and is now attracting business to
attractive shopping centres with ade'
quate parking space as a necessary
but welcomed added attraction.”
VOLUNTARY HOUSING
SOCIETY.
Malaya has a non - profit- making
housing society run by voluntary
workers. Its aim is to help the poor
build low-cost houses, said its chair'
man, Mr. Lee Tham Yin, a Kuala
Lumpur architect. It is the Kuala
Lumpur Forlong Housing Co'opera'
tive Society, which will launch a
<£750,000 plan for a model village at
Setapak, near Kuala Lumpur, as soon
as the municipality approves. Prices
of the houses will range from about
<£Boo to £lBOO.
NEW CUSTOMS HOUSE FOR JOHANNESBURG.
The recently-completed Customs and Excise building at Johannesburg has a frontage
to two streets. It is of traditional reinforced concrete, planned on somewhat
austerity lines. The designers, however, have, as will be seen from the photo-
graph. achieved a highly satisfying treatment of window panels, on the left, by
recessing which provides deep hoods and sills. This building is in the part of the
City destined to become one of its busiest centres of activity.

MACKAY’S NEW NURSES’ HOME
DESIGNED FOR TROPICAL CONDITIONS.
Specifically designed for tropical
conditions, a striking three-storey
building has recently been completed
at Mackay, Queensland, to provide
accommodation for the nurses at the
Mackay Hospital. The building is
three-storied, the lower storey com-
prising entrance hall, recreation room,
lecture hall, library, and the piatron’s
self-contained suite. Part of one end
of this lower floor is entirely open,
the upper stories being supported on
round reinforced concrete columns.
This type of open construction
allows free passage of breeze right
around the bedrooms on the upper
stories and also provides welcome
shade for the public sections located
on the ground floor.
The building contains accommoda-
tion for forty nurses, twenty single
bedrooms being on both of the upper
floors. Each room is equipped with
built-in wardrobes and dressing tables,
and each floor has toilet rooms,
kitchenette and laundry; a sewing
room is also provided.
The structure is of reinforced con-
crete frame, with ribbed floor and
roof slabs, the walls and partitions
being of brick. The upper roof slab
is covered and insulated by a low-
pitch superimposed roof of corru-
gated asbestos cement in order to
give comfort from the hot conditions
give relief from the hot conditions
that prevail.
Prefab. Panels.
The whole of the bedroom fronts,
each comprising a door, sliding
sashes and adjustable wooden louvres,
were prefabricated to fit in between
the columns.
Each bedroom opens on to a canti'
levered balconette which, running in
a continuous line along the facade at
two levels, gives character and interest
to the straight-forward and simple
lines of the design.
The floors are of terrazzo to the
entrance and toilet rooms, with
polished hardwood elsewhere except
to the corridors, where linoleum is
laid. The ceilings to lounge, lecture
room, entrance hall and corridors are
of Perfotile.
The building faces north-east,
which is the direction from which
the prevailing breezes blow.
This building may be taken as an
excellent example of functionalistic
design developed efficiently to per-
form its required purpose under spe-
cial conditions. Without sensational-
ism on the one hand or the unneces-
sary application of extraneous detail
on the other, it gives a straight-
forward impression of a building
satisfactorily performing the purpose
for which it was built.
The Architects were Pranglev &
Crofts, of Brisbane, the Supervising
Associate Architect being Harold
Brown, of Mackay. Structural En-
gineers were Alexander & Browne, of
Brisbane.
The following subcontractors were
connected with the work: Terrazzo,
P. J. Lowther 6? Son Pty. Ltd.,
Louvres, Naco Ltd., and Asbestos
Cement, Wunderlich Ltd., all of Bris-
bane.
TRACTOR EXPERIMENTS
The Malayan Government has re'
ceived a £32,000 grant from the
Colonial Development and Welfare
Fund for a pilot scheme to determine
the future of mechanical cultivation.
A 50'acre tract of jungle in Perak is
being cleared for experiments with
machines for ploughing, sowing and
harvesting rice. It is thought that
large-scale use of tractors will develop
in Malaya.
PRICE RISE SAVES FACTORY
Upward trends in rubber prices
have given a rubber factory at Grisek,
near Muar, fohore, a new lease of
life. The factory is sponsored by
the Rural and Industrial Development
Authority, and was set up just over
a year ago for £44,000. It was run'
ning at a loss last year and at the
beginning of this year and was
threatened with closure until the “tide
turned” in rubber.

GROUP HOME BUILDING CUTS COSTS
SUBURBAN SOCIETY ASSISTS OWNERS.
The group erection of modern
home units for purchase has consider*
ably reduced purchase prices paid by
85 home-owners in Beverly Hills,
Revesby, Kingsgrove, and Padstow.
Construction of these fully-equipped
two* and three-bedroom homes was
organised by the Earlwood-Canterbury
Co-operative Community Advance-
ment Society Ltd.
This Society was formed to assist
members of the Terminating Build-
ing Societies within the group to
obtain homes, without each member
individually having to embark on all
the processes involved, and at the
same time share in the cost saving
resulting from the multiple building
scheme.
The purchaser, who, to qualify, has
to be a member of both the Advance-
ment Society and the terminating so-
ciety which will finance the purchase,
has the choice of numerous designs
and the opportunity to select colours
for interior decoratino.
Following the calling of tenders,
contracts are let by the Advancement
Society for an agreed number of
houses which are fully equipped, in-
cluding Rheem hot-water systems to
serve bathroom, kitchen and laundr”.
Finance for loans through the ter-
minating societies within the group is
the only factor at present restricting
the plans of the Directors of the Ad-
vancement Society, who are deter-
mined to meet the heavy demand for
cottages erected under this Community
Scheme.

£7,250,000 Expansion Programme
GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDEN’S ANNOUNCE PLANS.
Work is to begin immediately on a
further <£7,250,000 General Motors'
Holden’s expansion programme, with
additional facilities to increase Holden
output to a nominal capacity of 300
a day, or 72,000 a year.
This is the third postwar expan'
sion of G.M.H. plants; the last one
involved £11,000,000 expenditure.
Total floor space will be increased
from 81 to 100 acres, and increase
funds employed in the business to
over £40,000,000.
The project involves the erection of
new buildings at Woodville (South
Australia), at Fishermen’s Bend and
Dandenong (Victoria), and Pagewood
(Sydney).
Facilities will also be added to the
assembly plants at Pagewood, The
Valley (Brisbane), Birkenhead (Ade-
laide), and Mosman Park (Perth).
An important feature of this pro'
ject is that it will provide a basis
for further expansion of Holden
manufacture to a nominal output of
100,000 a year, or 400 a day.
Plant Expansion.
The aerial views showing these ex'
pansions at Woodville (S.A.),
Fishermen’s Bend and Dandenong
(Vic.), and Pagewoood plant (N.S.W.)
were featured in last week’s issue of
“Construction.”
The expansion of the plants will
increase the aggregate floor area to
100 acres (4,356,000 sq. ft.), as
under:
• Fishermen’s Bend: New buildings
will have floor area of 95,000 sq.
ft. (2 1/5 acres). Present total
floor space of this plant is 1,162,901
sq. ft. (26| acres). Total cost of
new buildings and equipment will
be about £1,610,000.
• Woodville (S.A.): Present total
floor space of 1,550,000 sq. ft. will
be increased by 166,000 sq. ft. (3f
acres). The expansion will cost
some £2,110,000. In the recent
G.M.H. £11,000,000 expansion,
£3,300,000 was spent at Woodville.
It is the largest bodybuilding and
metal'pressing plant south of the
Equator.
• Pagewood (34'acre site): Additional
50.000 sq. ft. (1 1/6 acres) to be
added to assembly plant at a cost
of about £558,000, including equip'
ment. Buildings at Pagewood were
recently almost doubled in floor
space—to 466,202 sq. ft. (10-|
acres).
• Dandenong (153'acre site): New
plant will have floor area of
550.000 sq. ft. acres), and
will cost over £2,840,000 without
machinery or equipment. (Cost of
machinery and equipment for this
plant is not included in the
£7,250,000 expansion expenditure,
but will be announced later.)
• Mosman Park, Perth: Additional
facilities will cost approximately
£78,000.

• Birkenhead, Port Adelaide: £30,000
to be spent on expansion.
• The Valley. Brisbane: Minor modi'
fications to premises will cost some
£6OOO.
This Australia'wide expansion of
existing G.M.H. facilities will be com'
pleted within 18 to 24 months, it was
stated in the Annual Report.
The programme means not only
more jobs for more people in G.M.H.
itself, but a related expansion by
many of the Company’s 3000 sup'
pliers in Australia (of materials ,parts,
components, and services), and so
give further important impetus to
Australia’s industrialisation.
Additional Facts.
The disposition of G.M.H’s. 1953
proceeds from sales is particularly in'
teresting. Total sales from its pro'
ducts (excluding Sales Tax) was
£57,670,118.
These receipts went:
• To supppliers of materials, compo'
nents, services, etc., £32,971,000
(57,2 per cent.).
• To emplovees for pay rolls and
allied expenses, £10,891,000 (18.9
per cent.).
• Customs Duties, taxes, etc.,
£4,665,000 (8.1 per cent.).
• Provision for depreciation on plants
and equipment, £984,000 (1.7 per
cent).
• To shareholders, £1,784,000 (3.1
ner cent.).
• For use in the business, £6,375,000
(11.0 per cent.).
• Average employment for 1953,
11,035 men and women—highest
in the Company’s history.
• Average annual earnings of all em'
ployees increased from £903 in
1952 to £946.
Holden Export.
The Report states that the outlook
for Holden products remains un-
changed but the Company plans to
export holden cars and utilities as
soon as practicable, “not only in its
own interests, but because it knowfe of
no other product of secondary indus'
try which could do so much in over'
seas countries to further Australia’s
reputation as a manufacturing
country.”
AMERICAN INDUSTRY
CRITICISED.
The American Machinist criticises
American industry, stating that more
than half of the production equipment
of the factories, machine tools and
metal forming units, is overage and
that much of it has very limited use'
fulness. Never before has so much
outmoded high cost machinery been
so widely diffused throughout Ameri'
can industry. The journal makes a
clarion call to industry to cut'out com'
placency and improve efficiency.
Stimulating American Design
HOTEL STATLER, DALLAS, TEXAS.
The design of this new Hotel Statler for Dallas, Tex, U.S.A.. is stimulating and
attractive, embodying everything that modern design and construction have to
offer without being extreme. The pattern created on the facade by the project-
ing spandrel panels provides interest to the large facades, and contrasts with the
fine vertical members. An up-to-the-minute feature is the "heliport" on the roof
(see lower view), this being the first hotel to have roof-top provision for the
landing of helicopters. Analysis of the impact load from helicopter landing
showed that the roof slab did not have to be thickened and very little additional
steel was required for reinforcing. The "touch-down pad" is surfaced with If
asphalt paving blocks which will provide a distinctive yellow circle about 40ft. in
diameter. The imaginative treatment of the various service features (tanks, lift-
wells, etc.) on the roof is in rather marked contrast to the haphazard roof-top
treatment of so many Australian city buildings.

New Modern Warehouse For Machine Tools
BRITAIN’S BEST PRODUCTS ON DISPLAY.
Alfred Herbert (A/sia) Pty. Ltd.
The new modern showroom and
warehouse of Alfred Herbert (A/sia)
Pty. Ltd. at Annandale, Sydney, were
officially opened on September 7 by
Mr. J. Finlay, M.8.E., who was for
many years General Manager of the
Government Ammunitions Factory,
Lithgow,
The ceremony was held in the
presence of a very large and repre'
sentative gathering of members of the
Australian and overseas engineering
industry.
A striking feature of the new build'
ing is a spacious machinery hall in
which a wide range of machinery is
set up to demonstrate various pro'
cesses to engineers.
The new building is claimed to be
the most modern machine tool show'
room in the Commonwealth, as it has
been basically designed around the
company’s particular needs.
Already the new premises have
proved to be an answer to the needs
of many Australian manufacturers
seeking machine tools to fit their
manifold production needs.
On display are machine tools made
by Alfred Herbert Ltd., Coventry,
England, the parent company, and
tools from the many world agencies
handled by the organisation.
Long Service to Australia.
Alfred Herbert (A/sia) Pty. Ltd.
was established at Pyrmont, Sydney,
over 30 years ago, where the firm
was handicapped to some extent by
lack of display and demons.ration
facilities.
After many years’ search for alter'
native premises, the company pur'
chased an 18,000 sq. ft. site at
Annandale, from which over 2000
tons of rock was excavated and two
small cottages demolished.
The architect for the new ware'
house was Mr. S. J. Traill, and it was
erected by A. W. Edwards Pty. Ltd.,
Master Builders.
dhe 18,000 sq. ft. of floor space
on the ground floor is covered to a
depth of 6in. by concrete, and two
large motorised roller'shutter entrances
18ft. high provide for incoming
loads on one side.
The main area is divided into three
bays each 36ft. wide by 110 ft. deep,
for which overhead cranes can trans'
port loads wherever needed.
One crane lifts 10 tons, a second
seven tons, and the third three tons.
By their operation, machines can be
moved at will, thus enabling them to
be quickly set up along the two bus
bar installations for immediate
demonstrations.
These machines then run under
working conditions in such a manner
that clients can watch all operations
and, at a later date, their operators
can be trained under identical cir'
cumstances.
Service and maintenance needs are
catered for by a 40ft. x 12ft. enclosed
area, equipped wi:h eight modern
machine tools for jobbing work.
Many of the technical staff have
come from the parent body; the office
staff are mostly Australians. Mr. John
Blunt, who recently retired as Manag'
ing Director, spent 51 years with the
firm, and came to Australia in 1931.
The six senior executive staff mem'
bers were all trained in Coventry.
Small Tools.
The small tools division, of some
4000 sq. ft., comprises an attractive
counter display set up around the steel
cabinets housing the stock. A system
of display enables customers to quickly
choose the equipment required.

Throughout the display and well'
planned office sections and spacious
staffrooms, parquetry flooring has
been installed. Glass bricks have been
used to advantage in planning these
modern premises. An unusual feature
of the interior walls is an occasional
“Coronation Tile,” which were made
in England during the Queen’s
Coronation, and, as the building was
then in course of construe ion, it was
decided that the tiles—embossed with
the Royal Cipher and the year, 195 3
would prove singularly appro-

Official Ceremony.
Following inspection of the premises
and machine tools under power, the
Managing Director, Mr. A. L. Hip-
well, welcomed the visitors, and paid
a tribute to the half-century of service
given Alfred Herbert Ltd. by the
late Managing Director, Mr. John H.
Blunt.
Mr. Hipwell added that he felt
sure Australia offered amazing pos-
sibilities in its fast industrial future.
He read a cable from Sir Alfred
Herbert who celebrated his 88th
birthday this week—wishing the Aus-
tralian enterprise every success.
Mr. Blunt traced the growth of the
parent company since he joined it in
1904, and the expansion of the Aus-
tralian company since he came to
Australia in 1931. He was indeed
proud of the great achievements he
had seen in his lifetime.
Mr. J. Finlay, M.8.E., said his first
acquaintance with Sir Alfred Herbert
was in 1910, when he met him in
Coven.ry. Since then, he had had
much to do with both the parent com'
pany and the Australian organisation.
Mr. Finlay traced the history of
various machine tools developed by
the company to meet industrial and
war needs; machines which to-day are
in constant use the world over. He
then officially declared the new
premises open.
At the conclusion of his speech,
Mr. Blunt presented Mr. Finlay with
a handsome engraved silver salver as
a memento of the occasion.
Following the ceremony, all present
enjoyed an elaborate buffet tea and
refreshments.
Sydney Timber
Expert Accepts N.Z.
Appointment
Mr. R. Deeble, who is well known
in all spheres of the Australian tim-
her industry, has been appointed
Sales Manager, Timber Division, of
Tasman Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd.,
which operates extensive pulp, paper
and sawmilling interests in N.Z.
He was, until recently, manager of
the Union Timber Co. Pty. Ltd.,
Leichhardt.
Mr. Deeble’s career in the timber
industry began as a technical officer
of the Fores: Products Division, Mel-
bourne, where he specialised for 11
years in the study of seasoning, pre-
servation, and veneer and plywood
production. He later joined National
Box Co. Ltd.,' Sydney, as a technical
officer, and later became manager of
Union Timber Co. Pty. Ltd., gaining
valuable experience in timber purchas-
ing and retailing.
He has already visited the Dominion
seven times and has handled radiata
pine sales, thus becoming familiar
with all aspects of marketing this
timber. Mr. Deeble considers that
Australia will offer the largest over-
seas market for the N.Z. company’s
future huge production, which is
eventually expected to reach
72,000,000 super feet sawn per
annum.
Mr. Deeble took up his new posh
tion on June 1, and before going to
N.Z. he is spending three months in
Australia, surveying marketing poten-
tials.

POPE PRODUCTS LTD.
NEW ADMINISTRATIVE BLOCK AT BEVERLEY, ADELAIDE.
Pope Products, one of the most
progressive industries in South Aus-
tralia, started in 1925, and the in'
teresting story of its foundation and
growth is given in the accompanying
article.
Early in 1952 a fire destroyed the
administrative office of the company
and a new modern office and adminis'
tration block was erected to take its
place.
Building Controls.
The rebuilding took place in 1952,
during the latter period of building'
material control, and as it was vital
that the block be erected in the
shortest possible time, the building as
finished is simple in plan, automatic
in design, conventional in structure,
and plain in finish-—in short, a fairly
clear reflection of the conditions out
of which it arose.
Exterior Colour.
The exterior is enlivened to some
extent by the colour combination of
the materials used, the greenish tinge
of anti'actinic glass in the window
strips being punctuated by spandrels,
at the columns, of dusty pink Witro'
lite,’ and this blends quite pleasantly
with the aluminium of window frames
and light grey of the cement brick
walls. Trim at the entrance is apple-
green.
The Ground Floor is given over to
office space including reception, gene-
ral, sectional and executive areas. On
the First Floor, only half of the space
has, so far been allotted to specific
functions, but those already developed
include a Product Showroom, Board
and Conference rooms and the Manag'
mg Director’s Suite. The balance of
this floor is reserved against future
expansion of either sales or adminis'
trative activity.
Construction.
The structure is a steel-and-concrete
frame; the brickwork is smoothTaced
cement brick; roofing is deep ' corru-
gated asbestos on wood purlins and
steel trusses. ’ Window frames are
aluminium and spandrels vitrolite;
glazing is single anti-actinic sheet in
fixed lights and horizontahsliding
sashes; door frames are of wood.
Internally, walls and columns are
floated and set. Ground Floor ceiling is
concrete “off the forms,” coloured;
whilst First Floor ceiling is flush'
jointed fibrous plaster. Floors on both
levels are concrete slabs, covered with
“Semas*-’c” tiles.
Panelling in the executive offices,
together with all furniture, furnishings
and partitions, was carried out by
the company.
Architects were Lawson, Cheesman
6? Doley, and Master Builders Wilckens
6? Burnside Ltd.
The rubber flooring was by the
Dunlop Flooring Co., of Adelaide.
Twenty-five Years of Progress.
Even a quarter of a century ago it
was not uncommon to see a “Pope
Sprinkler operating in an Adelaide
suburban garden, for, many years-
prior to this time, Mr. Henry Pope,
father of two of the present Directors,
using only a treadle lathe and other
simple tools, had manufactured various-
types of garden sprinklers. The fact
that Adelaide hardware dealers found
these readily saleable, coupled with
Mr. Pope’s intense interest in the
further development of a simple spray
system of irrigation, led to the forma'
tion of “Pope’s Sprinkler & Irrigation
Company’’ in the year 1925. Mr. S.
Barton Pope, present Chairman of
Directors, who had been trained as
an accountant, discarded his ambitions,
in that direction and, with his father,
staked his future in the little sprinkler
business.
A Modest Beginning.
The scene of this venture was a
small unused garage at the rear of
the family’s home at Croydon Park,
about three miles west of Adelaide.
Gradually the business expanded as
machinery was obtained and new gar-
den hose accessories were added to the
range, till by 1938 annual sales had
risen from £1729 to the huge total of
£4346.
Pope Products Ltd.
In 1931, “Pope Sprinklers Limited”
was no longer regarded as a satisfac-
tory name, as by this time its manu-
factures had extended beyond the

range of irrigation systems and gar-
den sprinklers and many new lines
were being produced. Accordingly,
the name of the company was changed
to “Pope Products Limited,” which
offered no impediment to future ex-
pansion. In spite of difficult con-
ditions brought about by the depres-
sion years, the company continued to
progress, and by 1934 the annual
turnover had reached a level of
£17,056.
By 1935 the company had com-
pletely outgrown its home site at
Croydon Park, and cramped for space
no alternative remained but to remove
the entire factory and plant to a new
location which provided breathing
space and room for extension. Ac-
cordingly, the decision was made to
move the whole plant to a spacious
site at Charles Road, Beverley.
War Production.
The company played an important
part in the great drive for munitions
production during the war years, and
200,000 aircraft practice bombs
and 1.322,189 practice bombs
as well as 1,120,481 anti-aircraft shell
components (“Gaine” No. 11) were
produced, as well as large quantities
of other munitions; employment in-
creasing from 300 to 750.
In order to accommodate the de-
mands made on the company, plant
and buildings were substantially in-
creased, this work being carried out
concurrently with production and
without reduction of output.
The additional buildings erected in-
cluded a modern mechanised foundry,
casualty room, locker and shower
rooms, and stores, in addition to pro-
ductive areas.
After the war it was found th?t
much had been learned from this
great struggle in terms of knowledge
that could be applied with equal bene-
fit in peace-time production. So.
concurrently with the manufacture of
new products, a programme of re-
development and improvement of
existing manufactures was undertaken.
Strengthened by new financial re-
sources, the company was now able
to cater for its expanded activities by
acquiring a modern factory building
and offices situated in the Finsbury
Munitions Area. This building was
obtained under lease from the Com'
monwealth of Australia and was
equipped with modern machinery,
staffed and in production early in 1947
within a few months of acquisition.
These added facilities were wholly de-
voted to the production of an en-
larged range of “Pope” products, and
components as service to other indus-
trial organisations.
Mechanised Foundry.
During 1946, the necessity to en-
large and improve the mechanised
facilities in the iron foundry had be-

come apparent. Originally installed
to produce bomb castings, it was not
sufficiently equipped to produce the
company’s civil requirements, so dut'
ing the Christmas holidays of 1946
the plant was extended, machinery
overhauled, and modifications made
to the mechanised layout in order to
yield the greater productoin required,
and it is now recognised as one of the
finest foundries in the Commonwealth
for the mass production of relatively
small weight castings.
The company’s considered policy of
development has brought its reward,
and its new products, such as carpen'
ters’ planes, clothes wringers, lawn-
mowers, electric lawn mowers and
washing machines, have been so s"c-
cessful that 1950—the year of the
company’s Silver Jubilee —saw sales
outstrip all previous records.
Surely this is a saga of Australian
industry!
FRENCH BUILDERS VISIT
LONDON.
Study Incentive Schemes.
A small study group, representa'
tive of the French Federation of
Building Contractors, visited London
recentlv to study industrial and public
relations methods used in the British
building industry.
The members of the group were
Messieurs Georges Javay and Alan
Delacommune, accompanied by M.
Michel Parion, chief of the Social
Service Department of the French
Federation, and M. Rene Pinhas, act'
ing as an interpreter.
On arrival at the National Federa'
tion of Building Trade Employers’
headquarters at 82 New Cavendish
Street, the French builders were web
corned by Mr. Nigel Hannen, Junior
Vice'President of the National Fede-
ration.
Discussions were held on incem
tives schemes, the working of
Regional Incentive Panels and the
operation of incentive schemes for
maintenance and repair jobs, also
the value of plant maintenance com'
petitions, the importance of observing
safety regulations, and methods of
preventing unnecessary waste of build'
ing materials.
The group was entertained by Mr.
Kirby Laing, of John Laing & Sons
Ltd., at the private cinema of that
company to see films illustrating some
of the company’s industrial relations
activities.

Australia’s Major Developmental Works
MANY LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS UNDER WAY.
Details of 159 of Australia’s major
developmental projects in the fields of
water conservation and supply irriga'
tion, electricity generation, town gas,
railway construction, seaports, air'
ports, and land settlement are given
in a new National Development
Department booklet.
Only the most important projects
are included. There are, of course,
many hundreds of smaller projects
being carried out in Australia which
have not been included in the survey.
The booklet gives brief notes on
the nature of each project, its pur'
pose, progress, and, wherever possible,
the estimated cost. Maps show the
location of all projects.
Huge Total Cost.
Total estimated cost for all those
projects for which costs are given is
£638,914,000. This figures does not
include the Snowy Mountains Scheme,
which alone is estimated to cost
£422,000,000. Other projects for
which costs are not given include the
24 land settlement projects listed, 19
of the 42 power projects, eight of the
20 railway construction projects, and
one of the 14 port development
schemes.
Of the works for which cost estfi
mates are given, those, dealing wuh
water supply, conservation and irriga'
tion account for £357,954,000, with'
out including the Snowy Scheme.
• Electricity generation accounts for
£164,400,000.
• Gas production for £16,972,000.
• Railway construction for £35,018,00.
• Seaports for £59,265,000.
• Airports for £5,505,000.
Many State Works.
Almost all projects listed in the
booklet are developmental works
undertaken by State Governments.
Private companies are responsible for
all the gas projects, except one in
Victoria which is a joint private and
State Government enterprise.
“Period of Intensive
Development.”
“The number and magnitude of the
projects shown to be in progress in
Australia indicate clearly that the
nation is in the midst of a period of
intensive development,” declares the
National Development Minister, Sen'
ator W. H. Spooner.
“It is fitting that a country so lack'
ing in water resources as is Australia
should be devoting the greatest pro'
portion of its developmental expendb
ture to works for the storage and dis'
tribution of water.
“These water schemes ,together
with those for land settlement, will
enhance the productivity of rural
areas and encourage the settlement of
more of our people in the country.
“They will have a marked influ'
ence on one of Australia’s most
serious problems of development—
the over'concentration of population
in the cities,” Senator Spooner
added.
Population Growth.
Australia’s copulation is now grow'
ing at a rate of three per cent, a year
(compared with the rate of one per
cent, which prevailed in the 1930’5),
and schemes for rural development
play an important part in attracting
portion of this increased population
to areas beyond the large cities, the
Senator said.
“It is important to emphasise that
the works listed are not just ‘pipe'
dreams’; they are all under construe'
tion, and a great many have reached
an advanced stage,” he added.
N.S.W. Projects.
Some of the major water supply,
conservation, and irrigation projects
for N.S.W. are:—
• Blowering Dam, Tumut River; con'
construction of rolled, earth'fill
of 846,000 acreTeet capacity, with
concrete spillway, £17,000,000. In'
vestigation of dam site proceeding.
• Burrendong Dam, Macquarie River;
construction of rolled, earth'fill
of 964,000 acreTeet capacity,
£8,000,000. (Construction was sus'
pended in 1952 when 15 per cent,
complete.)
• Glenbawn Dam, Hunter River;
earth'fill dam, 296,000 acreTeet
capacity, £10,800,000. Project to
be completed in 1958.
• Keepit Dam, Namoi River; mass
capacity, £8,500,000. (Construction
concrete dam, 345,000 acreTeet
is proceeding.)

(Still under construction.)
• Warragamba Pipeline; concrete'
lined steel pipeline, 106in.'84in.,
16 miles long, £4,700,000 (nearing
completion).
In all, 14 water supply, conserva-
tion, and water supply projects are
under way in N.S.W.
Electricity Generation.
• Pyrmont “B.” Estimated cost
(1953), £16,000,000. Installation
of third generating unit is nearing
completion.
• Lake Macouarie, £28,000,000 (to
be completed by 1960).

DIAMONDS AND SQUARES.
Basic shapes and forms applicable to structural and decorative uses are on analysis found to be somewhat limited. Their
application, however, is infinite and in the hands of ever y designer they tend to achieve individuality. In these tour designs
we find the square and rectangle used in different ways, particularly in the sub-division of the windows: in the top right, by
using a check design on the diagonal on the garage door, emphasis and special interest have been concentrated upon this
feature. The same feature of the bottom right design has been treated in a different fashion by developing a pattern of
solid and voids by means of alternate glazing and solid panels. It Is noted that all the plans presuppose a fairly wide block
of land, which is necessary when the garage ,s attached to the side of the house. Low-lying roof lines are also favoured.

Railway Construction.
In this category, N.S.W. has seven
railway construction propjects under
way, for which the estimated cost?
(1953) are not available. They aie:

Gas Manufacturing.
Gas manufacturing projects in
N.S.W. involve an estimated cost
( 1953) of £3,825,000. (The State
Government will introduce legislation
to enable Sydney’s two gas companies
to proceed with a £12,500,000 expan'
sion programme, it was announced
last week.)
Port Works.
Four important port construction
and improvement works in N.S.W'.
are as follows:
• Port Jackson. Sydney: Construction
of seven new jetties at Darling
Harbour, to replace 18 existing
berths; £5,275,000 estimated cost
( 1953), including cost of dredging.
® Homebush B a v Reclamation,
£750,000.

works. £3,750,000 (1954). Work
has begun.
• Port Kembla, £725,000; new 1000
ft. x 100 ft. jetty.
Land Settlement.
One land settlement propect is in
process of being developed in N.S.W.
It is the Coomealla ’lrrigation Area
Extension, Murray Valley. The area
is 3000 acres, with 100 farms, to
produce dried vine fruits and citrus.
Ninety'five blocks have been allocated
and are being developed.
Airports.
Kingsford'Smith Airport is being
developed at an estimated cost (1953)
of £1,367,000 to International Civil
Aviation Organisation standard 8.1.
Other Works.
Many other major works are in
progress in other States similar, in
general terms, to those being under'
taken by N.S.W. There seems little
doubt that current development pro'
jects being undertaken in Australia
represent a big step forward in the
harnessing of the nation’s national re'
THE OLD COMMISSARIAT STORE.
Many will remember the old grey stone Commissariat Store that was demolished
to make way for the new Maritime Services building. This old foundation stone
was removed and has now been erected just behind the Phillip Memorial. The
inscription reads: "This stone was removed from the Commissariat Store Building,
which was erected by order of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812. The build-
ing faced George Street North in a position near this site, and was demolished
in 1940."
THE GOVERNOR PHILLIP
MEMORIAL
This Memorial has just been
erected in front of the Maritime
Services Building, Circular Quay
West, Sydney. It was just about
this spot that Captain Arthur
Phillip, R.N., landed in Sydney
Cove on January 26, 1788, On
the rear of the sandstone
pedestal is this inscription:
"This Memorial was erected by
the Maritime Services Board of
N.S.W., in conjunction with the
Royal Australian Historical So-
ciety. The bust of Captain
Phillip was sculptured by Mrs.
Jean Hill, daughter of Sir
Edward Hallstrom, through whose
generosity the bust was
donated."

WORLD’S FIRST ALUMINIUM
OFFICE BUILDING.
The Alcoa Building, Pittsburgh.
Many Remarkable Innovations.
In the heart of Pittburgh’s Golden
Triangle, one of the most unique
office buildings of modern times has
recently been completed. It is Alcoa’s
new home office building, a 30-storey,
aluminium-clad skyscraper, and it
plays a major role in the city’s huge
rebuilding programme. It employs so
many innovations in both construction
techniques and materials that it defies
comparison with any single building
in the United States to-day.
Architects for this unique building
are Harrison 6? Abramovitz, of New
York (Harrison headed the organisa-
tion that designed and erected the
U.N.O. Headquarters m New York),
with Mitchell & Ritchey and Altenhof
Bown, of Pittsburgh, as associate
architects. The George A. Fuller
Company, of New York, were the
general contractors.
Plans called for the erection of a
30-storey office building containing
approximately 300,000 square feet of
rentable floor space above the first
floor.
Since it is architecturally pleasing
and also because the current trend is
to allow more light and air around
metropolitan office buildings, Alcoa’s
new structure is set back about 4’ 6”
from the building line on William
Penny Way, and this allows for
future widening of the avenue and
permits planting of shrubs and flowers
alongside the structure.
BERLIN S RECONSTRUCTION
PROBLEMS.
Optimism—Despite Difficulties.
A harder blow to the average Ber-
liner than either the division of his
city or the war destruction heaped
around him, is the complete loss of
his city’s former significance.
Berlin, now a pile of rubble, used
to be Germany’s administrative capi-
tal, as well as its greatest industrial
city.
In 1945, the city was., almost
“kaputt,” to use the expressive Ger-
man word for something that has
“had it.” Of 1,500,000 homes, only
370,000 were still habitable, and 22
city remained standing.
But the loss of Western Berlin’s
substance, which is far greater than
that of the rest of West Germany,
was not essentially due to the war.
Destruction by bombs was about the
same in Berlin as in all other German
industrial cities. What hit Berlin
hardest was the post-war damage.
In “Germany Reports,” an official
German Federal Government publica-
tion, we read that from May to July,
1945. the Red Army dismantled* 75
to 80 per cent, of Berlin’s entire plant
equipment. The iron, steel and metal
industries lost 90 per cent., the elec-
trical industry 85 per cent., the
mechanical precision and optical in-
dustries 80 per cent., the printing
trade 75 per cent., and vehicle manu-
facturers 70 per cent, of their former
capacity.
(The Red Army got the old plant,
and Germany, rapidly building up
new and more efficient plant, will
learn to say “Thank you” for that
mercy. She is already in a position
to outsell and undersell neighbouring
countries, of which Russia is one, by
her more modern output.)
New Jobs.
The Berlin blockade, at the time,
cost the city its remaining reserves
and, in addition, prevented recon-
struction in West Berlin during eleven
decisive months.
Desnite these difficulties, it was
possible to create 70,000 new perma-
nent jobs in industry during 1950-51.
This was an enormous step forward,
putting Berlin in line with the rest
of West German economy.
Alongside the upward industrial
trend of Western Berlin is the bleak
picture of mass unemployment, which
is reported to have assumed a perma-
nent character.
Almost every second Berliner is
directly or indirectly dependent on
public aid. Unemployment in the city
is four times greater than that of
other Western German cities.
The unemployment figure fluc-

How To Use Your Light Meter
By A. DRESLER, Dr.Ing., M.I.E.S.
Precise of a Lecture Given to the Illuminating Engineering Society of
Australia, Inc., on September 2, 1954.
The familiar photo-electric light
meter is a handy instrument, but it
must be treated with respect. It is
subject to certain limitations which
lighting engineers should understand
if they are to avoid making serious
errors.
The spectral sensitivity of the
ordinary selenium photovoltaic cell
does not correspond with that of the
“standard” human eye. This means
that a calibration for tungsten light
does not hold for mercury, sodium
or fluorescent light or, for that
matter, daylight. This “spectral
sensitivity error” can be overcome in
two ways. One is to calibrate the
cell separately for each type of light
source used. The other is to cover
the cell with a special “colour cor-
recting” filter which makes its spec-
tral response approximately the same
as that of the human eye.
The selenium photovoltaic cell does
not obev the Lambert cosine law
strictly, for the light falling on its
surface at an oblique angle does not
stimulate the cell to the extent that
it should. This means that if the
cell is used to measure oblique illumi-
nation (e.g., daylight from a window),
the reading will be lowered by an
amount known as the “cosine error.”
The extent of the error will depend
on the type of cell employed and on
the angle of incidence at which the
light strikes its surface. At the ex-
pense of a certain loss in sensitivity.
special devices can be applied to the
cell which will reduce its cosine
error to within a few per cent, over
practically the entire range. Colour
correction can also be incorporated
in such devices.
A simple colour correcting filter
and glass cover plate introduces very
serious cosine error. This suggests
that, for veneral illumination measure-
ments, if a special cosine-corrected,
colour-corrected, cell is not available,
the best compromise is to use a bare
photocell and calibrate it separately
for each type of light source.
Photocells should be guarded
against shocks and should never be
exposed to very high illuminations
(e.g., direct sunlight). 111-treatment of
this kind may cause them to break
down completely—or lose part of
their sensitivity, which is even more
serious since it may pass unnoticed.
Even if handled carefully, the meter
should be calibrated about every
three months if it is being frequently
used for routine measurement work.
The accuracy to be expected de-
pends on circumstances. An ordinary
pocket footcandle meter which is used
for artificial lighting measurements
only, and is calibrated to tungsten
light every twelve months or so,
should give readings correct to with-
ing ±20%, provided that it is handled
with reasonable care. This degree of
accuracy is usually good enough for
ordinary casual illumination measure-
merits. For more precise work a
bare-cell (or cosine-corrected) meter,
calibrated every three months in
terms of the various types of light
source encountered, should be correct
to within ±lO%. A fully colour-
corrected cosine - corrected meter,
freshly calibrated and used under
laboratory conditions, should have an
error not exceeding ±3%.
DISCUSSION.
( 1 ) Mr. Philips: Would Dr. Dres-
ler please indicate whether the diffi-
culties which are experienced with
Viscor type filters when measuring
light at different angles of incidence
are still present when the cosine
corrector is used?
Dr. Dresler: These difficulties are
not present provided the cosine cor-
rector is made of good diffusing mate-
rial and placed in such a position with
regard to the spectral filter and the
photocell that the direction of the
light reaching the filter is independent
of the angle of incidence of the light
reaching the cosine corrector,
(2) Mr. Gray; In view of the fact
that transistor elements exhibit a
photo-electric effect, could Dr. Dres-
ler please advise whether this type of
element can be used in a similar way
to the selenium cells?
Dr. Dresler: I have not yet heard
of transistors being used as photo-
cells.
(3) Mr. Campbell: I should like to
have Dr. Dresler’s opinion on the
value of the S.E.I. photometer as
compared with the selenium barrier
cell type.
Dr. Dresler: The S.E.I. photo-
meter is an excellent instrument, so
good in fact that I strongly recom-
mend its use in preference to a photo-
electric light meter, provided proper
care has been taken to have the
S.E.I. meter calibrated over its entire
working range.
(4) Mr. Lay: Would Dr. Dresler
please indicate the order of accuracy
which can be expected when measure-
ments are taken with the S.E.I.
meter?
Dr. Dresler: If readings are repeat-
ed in the usual way, I have had no
difficulties in achieving an accuracy
of ±5-10%,
(5) Mr. Connally: What is the
nature of material normally used for
cosine corrector, and how does it
affect the results of measurements?
Dr. Dresler: The material used for
cosine correction should combine the
properties of a good diffuser with a
high transmission factor. Within cer-
tain limits the degree of diffusion is
not very critical, provided the cosine
corrector is given the right shape.
(6) Mr. Forbes; In view of the fact
that Dr. Dresler has proved that the
current type light meter has a very
poor degree of accuracy, would he

please advise whether there are avail'
able, or likely to become available,
commercial instruments equipped with
the various correction devices he
mentioned, so that lighting engineers
will have an instrument in which they
can place greater faith?
Dr. Dresler: I am aware of cosine-
corrected light meters being made
available commercially. However, the
one type which I have seen myself
was not operating satisfactorily.
Street Lighting
Importance of Well-designed
Equipment.
The Annual Report of the Council
for the Preservation of Rural England
(Vol. XVI, No. 2) contains the fob
lowing section devoted to the design
of street lighting standards and
equipment. In view of its interest
and the fact that many of the com-
ments can be equally applied in this
country, it is published hereunder: —
“Street Lighting.—The widespread
disfigurement of towns and villages by
ill-considered schemes of street light'
ing is a post'war phenomenon with
which all C.P.R.E. members will be
familiar and to which we have re'
ferred in previous reports. Its cause
undoubtedly is that the equipment
tends to be chosen solely for its light'
ing efficiency and its cheapness and,
although in the course of a year the
hours of daylight greatly outnumber
those of darkness, little or no thought
seems usually to be given to its day'
time appearance. The problem can'
not therefore be dismissed as one of
taste upon which opinions will in-
evitablv differ; the difficulty is rather
that all too often there is no con'
scious exercise of taste at all, either
good or bad; the aesthetics of the
matter are simply ignored.
The installations to which excep'
tion is taken are criticised sometimes
for their unattractive design and ma-
terials, sometimes for the dispropor'
tion between the column and its set'
ting, and sometimes both.
Criticism of design and materials
is most often direc ed—and with good
reason—against the concrete stand'
ards whose coarseness of texture time
does not mellow and whose clumsy
proportions can rarely be assimilated
to their surroundings in the street
scene. On aesthetic grounds the use
of concrete for this purpose is to be
deplored, the more so as its structural
properties are such that only within
limits can the design of the columns
be refined. Both cast iron and tubu'
lar steel have been proved by experi'
ence to be far more sympathetic ma-
terials, and it is to be hoped that, as
controls are relaxed and these metals
become more freely available, they
will be much more widely used. Their
initial cost need be no higher, and
any additional cost of upkeep may
reasonably be regarded in most cases
as part of the price which a con'
scientious local authority must be pre'
pared to pay for the maintenance of
its civic amenities. Meanwhile, we
have been glad to see that, even in
the concrete columns, the general
standard of design has shown an im'
provement and also that attention is
being paid by some manufacturers to
co'ordinating the design of the
column and lantern so as to produce
a harmonious whole. We have no
doubt that these tendencies would be
much speeded up if a more active in'
terest in the design of street lighting
equipment were displayed by the local
authorities who install it. In the last
resort, it is a matter of supply and
demand. For the improvement
already achieved not a little of the
credit may fairly be claimed by the
Council of Industrial Design, whose
lists of approved designs afford valu'
able guidance to those authorities
which have the good sense to consult
them. The C.P.R.E. regrets the fur'
ther delay in publishing the illustra‘ed
brochure on the design of lighting
columns and other street furniture
which the Council of Industrial
Design was reported three years ago
to be preparing.
“Quite distinct from the quality of
the design and materials is the ques'
tion of scale—the height of the
columns in relation to the surrounding
buildings or other features. On classi'
fied roads the height is governed by a
code of practice’ laid down by the
Ministry of Transport, which’ pre'
scribes 25ft. above the carriageway as
the standard ‘Group A’ mounting
height for lanterns on Trunk Roads
and other ‘traffic routes.’ It is argu-
able indeed, it is the opinion of
some eminent lighting engineers—
that rigid adherence to this standard
may in some circumstances have the
result of reducing lighting efficiency,
and that on some ‘traffic routes’ the
actual volume of traffic may not neces'
sarily justify a full ‘Group A’ light'
ing scheme. At last year’s Chelten'
ham conference of the Georgian
Group a resolution was passed urging
the Ministry of Transport to con'
sider the propriety of permitting the
‘Group B’ mounting height of 15ft.
in places where 25'ft. standards would
be aesthetically unpleasing, and we
understand that in some highly excep'
tional cases this relaxation has in fact
been allowed. On such matters it is
the practice of the Ministry of Trans'
port not to act without the advice
of the Royal Fine Art Commission,
and our recommendation is that
wherever there are good reasons for a
departure from the prescribed height
the Commission should be consulted
as a first step, either direct or, in the
case of C.P.R.E. branches, through
C.P.R.E. Headquarters. It must in
any case be remembered that, though
a good design is always preferable to
a bad, the fact that a design is stated
to have been "passed by the Royal
Fine Ari Commission’ or ‘approved
by the Council of Industrial Design’
is no guarantee of its suitability for
any particular length of road —a point
which lighting authorities often over'
look.
“During the period covered by
this report, close liaison has been
maintained between the C.P.R.E., the
Commission, the Council of Industrial
Design, the Georgian Group and
other interested bodies, and in Sep'
tember the C.P.R.E. was represented
at the annual conference at Liverpool
of the Association of Public Lighting
Engineers. It may be assumed that
in the coming months many more
lighting schemes will be sanctioned,
for the raising of the capital invest'
ment limit by 25 per cent, means that
a further ,£500,000 can now be spent
on new installations. It is therefore
of the highest importance that local
authorities, who have all too little
official guidance on any but the
purely technical aspects of street
lighting, should be made aware of the
keen public interest in not only the
night'time efficiency but the day'time
appearance of street lighting equip'
ment, and that they should be en>
couraged to seek the advice (as some

THE REBUILDING OF LONDON
HOPES FOR GREATER ACTIVITY.
Although it is eight and a half Visitors from all parts of the
years since the last bomb fell on world who went to the Coronation
London, large areas of the city still were surprised and shocked to find
lie in ruins. how much of the city is still weed'
covered rubble.
That the capital of the victors,
after the greatest struggle in history,
should still remain as battle'Scarred
as at the end of the war seems ironic
in the light of the great rebuilding
that has taken place in the citiies of
the vanquished.
London’s retiring Lord Mayor, Sir
Rupert De La Bere, said recently that
he had a very real hope that at last
something could be done to rebuild
the city.
It is thought that the Government
in the next few months intends to
ease considerably the present tight re'
strictions on building licenses.
A Treasury official explained that
it was the declared objective of the
Churchill Government to remove
building controls in the form of
licenses through which the capital in-
vestment programme has been firmly
directed since the war years.
But although there will be con'
siderable easing for building, it is not
considered that it will be absolutely
free.
Sir Rupert De La Bere vigorously
declared that “if after 1945 we as a
nation had got together and said the
quickest road to recovery lay in re'
building this greatest of all cities, by
to'day we should have done more to
restore prosperity than almost any'
thing else could have done.’’
One of the first areas to benefit
will be the rich square mile of the
City of London, which will begin to
rise again around the inspiring focal
point of St. Paul’s—now ringed by
ruins.

Importance of the Building Contract
NEW BOOK ON STANDARDISATION.
Everyone connected with the

by so doing they will avoid many of
the troubles that can occur in such
matters: if troubles come about, they
will better be able to know iust how
they stand in relation thereto.

Hudson on Building
Contracts.
Over forty years have passed since
the learned author Hudson on Build-
ing Contracts wrote of those con-
tracts: “The subject matter is com-
plicated both by its own inherent
difficulties and by the fact that the
contracts in question are rarelv
drawn by persons having any know-
ledge of law, while the litigation re-
sulting from such contracts is gener-
ally conducted by persons who have
no practical experience in building.”
The widespread use of standard
conditions of contract has been the
answer to this criticism. The R.1.8.A.
Standard Form of Building Contract
is now generally accepted by archi-
tects, surveyors and builders as the
legal basis for the performance of
building works. A knowledge of the
intent and meaning of the standard
conditions of contract has
become a necessary part of the
equipment of those engaged, whether
professional!” or practically, in the
building industry.
The “Standard Form of Building
Contract” is a practical treatise on
the law relating to building works
carried out under the standard con-
ditions of contract. Each clause of
the contract is carefully annotated
and the legal and practical significance
of the wording explained.
This Annotation will prove an in-
valuable guide to architects and
builders in their dealings with the
legal complexities of building con-
tracts. It will be welcomed by lawyers
in addition for the information it
contains regarding the intricacies of
building practice. It is also a book
which the student or trainee should
keep in his library for careful study.

HARBOUR TUNNEL PROPOSAL
GOVERNMENT EXAMINATION PROMISES.
The State Government has
promised to examine thoroughly the
proposal to build a tunnel under
Sydney Harbour from the north side
to about the Haymarket.
Broadcasting on Monday night, the
Premier, Mr. Cahill, replied to the
proposal made last week in the Legis-
lative Assembly by Mr. C. Mallam,
Labour M.L.A. for Dulwich Hill.
In his speech, Mr. Mallam declared
that the Harbour Bridge had only
temporarily solved the problem of
communication between the north
and south shores.
The late Dr. Bradfield and other
engineers had recognised the value of
a tunnel, but construction difficulties
were much greater in the past than
those existing to-day.
Modern machinery could build a
tunnel more rapidly and much more
cheaply than a second bridge, Mr.
Mallam added.
To Review Suggestions.
In his broadcast, Mr. Cahill said the
Government would review Mr. Mai-
lam’s suggestion that it should “take
the road haulier as a partner” and not
treat him as an opponent.
“The Government will not ignore
this and other useful and constructive
suggestions,” Mr. Cahill declared.
“Ask For Estimate.”
Commenting on Mr. Cahill’s broad'
cast, Mr. Mallam said the Govern'
ment should prepare plans for a tun'
nel and obtain estimates of costs.
The Kaiser - Perini Group was
building a tunnel and a dam
for the Snowv Hydro-electric Scheme
for £25,000,000. The Government
should ask this company for an
estimate for a tunnel under the
Harbour from about the Haymarket
to the North Shore.
(Ed.: This is not the usual Gov*
ernment procedure, which is to frame
up the project with proper plans and
specifications and call for public
tenders. To ask anyone to give a
price would entail a terrific amount of
calculations and could not be done
before the project was determined and
worked out on plans which would
take months, if not a year, to do;
and then the question would arise,
“Why should any single builder be
selected for this work, when it is a
public undertaking?’’)
“The Kaiser company has to tun*
nel through granite at the Snowy, but
under the Harbour is sandstone.
“Another thing, if we have an
atom bomb, we will want a tunnel,”
Mr. Mallam added.
The Sydney Harbour Bridge was
22 years old on March 19 last. Mas-
sive though it is, the Bridge can no
longer handle all the peak-hour traffic.
Passengers by train, tram, bus and
motor vehicles now cross the Bridge
at the rate of 75,000,000 _a year. The
total number from the opening date,
March 19, 1932, to the end of 1952'
1953 was 1,096,404,000.
In that period these passengers con-
tributed directly in tolls and indirectly
in train, tram and bus charges only a
fraction less than the £9,725,000
which was the capital cost of the
structure to the end of the 1953
financial year. (Latest figures are not
yet available.)
In 21 years the Bridge earned a
total of over £10,000,000, but a
£6,800,000 loan liability remains. It
is being met by sinking fund proce'
dure designed to clear the debt com-
pletely by about 1985.
By that time, traffic experts declare,
traffic congestion will be so great
that the Bridge will be largely in'
operable (“Construction,” March 17,
' 5 )-.
As far back as 1857 the construe'
tion of a trans'harbour bridge was a
very live issue. In that year, Peter
Henderson, a personal friend of
George Stephenson, the locomotive
inventor, presented a plan for a
harbour bridge.
Many schemes have since been put
forward.
Norman Selfe proposed a bridge 60
years ago, with floating piers to lessen
the width of the central span.
Mr. F. E. Stowe had a three'
pronged or Y-bridge. with its centre
pier resting on one of the Harbour
islands, with arms stretching to the
PIPELINES, 2400 FEET AND 4450 FEET OUT TO SEA. SERVICE TANKERS.
Dual 12-inch pipelines are laid on the sea-bed off the coast of California to pro-
vide pick-up points tor oil tanker loading. Shown here (at top) is one of these
pipe lines being launched at Gaviota. It will extend seaward for 2400 feet, the
end being anchored and marked by a buoy. A 120-foot length of 10-inch flexible
rubber hose is attached and will be “fished" up by the tanker in 55 feet of water.
Loading can be done at the rate of 7500 barrels per hour. Top: The pipeline at
Gaviota being launched and floated into position. Note the derrick on barge at
the buoy site. Below: Five diesel caterpillars help to take the 4450-foot pipeline

northern side in two places. These
were given “short shrift,’’ for people
were not very engineering-minded.
When a tunnel was first suggested
and soundings taken it was reported
then, “An underground fissure that
existed would promptly consume all
the concrete that could be poured
into it’’; and that idea was promptly
abandoned, too.
There have never really been any
engineering difficulties from tunnels or
bridges that engineering graduates
from Sydney University could not
carry out. Their trouble is, they
haven’t been given a chance—other
than Dr. Bradfield, and he made his
chance by showing how it could be
financed. After that, no objections
were raised.
Sir John Sulman’s Tunnel Scheme
was laid aside, to be brought up later,
such as is suggested to-day.
Some notable tunnels are:—
• Rotherhithe Tunnel, London, one
mile 332 yards, of which 474
yards is under the river. Total
cost (1908). £1,505,914.
• Blackwall Tunnel, London, one
mile 279 yards, of which 377 yards
is under the river. Total cost
(1897), *1,323.663.
• Severn Tunnel, four and one-third
miles in length. Total cost (1886),
£2,000.000.
• The Mersey, at Liverpool, England,
one mile between pumping shafts.
• Holland Vehicular Tunnel, New
York, 2 miles 297 yards, a twin-
tube highway, cost *A. 17,000,000
(1927).
Other more recent tunnels in New
York are:—
• Queens Midtown Tunnel, used by
13,000,000 vehicles yearly, and
• Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, used by
1 5,000,000 yearly.
In addi'ion to these tunnels pro-
viding traffic routes, New York is still
more famous for its bridges, which
include:—

For 12 months ending December
31, 1951, the Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority reported an income
of 27,029,479 dollars (*A. 12,000,000).
The cost of operation averaged 14%
of revenue. In the same period,
113,046,087 vehicles used the
facilities.
This indicates that, with American
“know-how,” Town Planning pays,
when cost of operation leaves 86% of
revenue for further development and
enrichment.
In Australia, we drift and drift.
Even at the present time we have lost
£7>, 000,000 to indulge a foolish lot of
bus employees in a strike, which
makes nobody happy not even the
strikers. Still, that is their way of
life —and ours. Perhaps some day we
will wake up.
PLASTIC

FORMWORK
“Plasply”—And Its Advantages.
One of the most important devel-
opments in the U.S. building industry
in the past 20 years has been the in'
troduction and subsequent wide
acceptance of plywood panels for
concrete formwork or shuttering.
Now adopted as the standard form
material where small surfaces, fin-free
surfaces, simplified form construction
and multiple re-use are desired, water-
proof plywood forms have been used
on thousands of projects. These
range from simple curbing jobs to the
world’s largest architectural concrete
project at the 175-acre Parklabra
Hou sing Development in Los Angeles,
where 3,000,000 square feet of water-
proof was used for concrete form-
work.
“Plasply.”
To give waterproof plywood even
greater advantages over other form
boards, Ralph Symonds Ltd. have in-
troduced Plasply,” the guaranteed
50 pour (heavy construction plaster
surfaced hot-bonded “Reswood” form-
work plywood. The plasticised and
sealed surface prevents crazing,
checking and lifting of faces of ply.
It can be supplied in giant sheets
up to 25 feet x 7 feet, with no scarf
joints, thereby saving considerable
erection labour. It can be easily
erected by unskilled labour, and is
easily stripped requires less oiling;
has fewer joints fin-free surfaces;
smooth surface finish will obviate
plastering; hard surface for repeated
use, rigidity requiring less structural
support; high strength-weight ratio;
great constructional strength and fully
waterproof (stands boiling water).
“Plasply” waterproof formwork has
strong resistance to deflection, owing
to the outside skins of “Reswood”
Plywood being impregnated under
high heat and great pressure during
manufacture.
Sawn edges as well as new saw cute
or other working should be treated
with lead-oil. aluminium primer, shel-
lac or similar sealer. Too much oil
coating will stain the concrete. A
fine thin film that makes the surface
greasy to the touch is sufficient.
“Plasply” panels can also be sup-
plied wi h all edges sealed by galva-
nised iron channelling bonded and
riveted to the sheets. This prevents
any sludge penetrating open edges
and gives much longer panel life.
“Reswood” formwork has proved
of great value in the following pro-
iects: Bunneron" and Tallawarra
Power Houses; Warragamba. Kcepit
and Glenbawn Dams; Building Con'
structions at Port Kembla; Captain
Cook Graving Dock: A.M.P. Build'
ing; Liverpool Technical College.
Sizes and thicknesses of “Plasply”
and standard “Reswood” formwork
are from Jin. to Ijin. in sizes 25ft.
bv 7ft., 25ft. by 6ft., 7ft. by 3ft., and
6ft. by 3ft.. and other sizes on request.
EVERYTHING OPEN AND IN VIEW.
To-day's trend in structural design for
general effect rather than for detail, Is
illustrated in this picture of a corner in
a modern residence. Here nothing is
enclosed; the stair treads are perched
on central stringers, and there is no
balustrading; anyone could tall through
between the handrailing and the stairs,
whilst the books on the overhead shelves
could easily land on the heads of the
occupants below. (These are risks we
must take in these days of dangerous
living.) The lights can be switched in
any direction where they may be want-
ed mostly. Ornamentation, in the shape
of a doll stuck on the wall, is placed
where it will obstruct the passage of
goods, such as a bag of laundry, going
up or down stairs.

AFRICA’S LONGEST
LOG CHUTE.
A Mountain Supplies the Sudan with
Railway Sleepers.
The Sudan, a country of flat hori'
zons, sand and countless camels, is
not the place you would expect to
find the longest log chute in the
whole of Africa, but the chute which
ends in a spectacular water splash
right in front of the Katire sawmill
makes that claim.
It drops down 3000 ft., for where
the Sudan merges into Uganda and
the East African bush, the Imatong
Mountains reach up over 10,000 ft.
into the clouds. The rich, tropical
rainfforest which clothes the slopes of
these mountains yields olive, podo'
carpus and camphorwood trees, be'
sides an occasional mahogany and
mvule.
In contrast to the Northern Sudan,
with its parched, featureless desert
country supporting life only where
the Nile water flows, the mountain
forests are in another world of creep'
ers, dank moss'covered trees rotting
with age, and strawberries and other
temperate fruits. The high altitude
produces the different climate, but
also means serious transport diffi'
cukies.
The log chute has solved the prob'
lem of getting these heavy logs down
the steep slopes for cutting and trans-
port to other parts of the Southern
Sudan and the Nile stations further
downstream.
Down the three'miledong wooden
runway hurtle massive logs weighing
anything up to two tons. In their
wake they leave a faint pall of blue
smoke generated by the intense fric'
tion at high speed. With a thud and
a splash, their hectic journey suddenly
ends, and in the calm water by the
sawmill naked Latukas manhandle the
logs to the crane.

COCOBUS COTTAGE.

tropical attire of the men reveal that it is in Africa. It is the rest house of the

abound in this area.

Books For Builders
FROM FLORENCE M. TAYLOR’S
LIBRARY.
In the past ten months the Master
Builders’ Association has been receiv-
ing historic books on architecture,
building and engineering from the
Library of Florence M. Taylor. A
few other books to interest builders
in their leisure moments on lighter
subjects have also been included, such
as a complete set of Shakespeare’s
plays. A few heavier books on en-
gineering subjects may interest build-
ers seeking engineering solutions to
their problems.
She hopes the readers of her
volumes will accept them in the spirit
in which they are given, for their
knowledge irrespective of their condi-
tion. About 90% of them have not
been mutilated, but the more valu-
able ones have.
Simultaneously with these books,
Mrs. Taylor has been laying aside a
set for the Library of The Australian
Institute of Builders, as many of her
books, if not actually duplicated, in-
clude the revised editions* that come
out from time to time. They are all
good and useful.
This has entailed a tremendous
f mount of selection, so that each orga-
nisation may receive books appro-
priate to their activities.
The quality of most of the books is
the highest that was published, from
the days when the illustrations were
hand etched on steel or copper plate
and printed on hand-made paper with
hand-set type. Since those early days
the printing press has forged ahead
so rapidly that every few years a re-
vised edition of the same book has
been produced; at the same time,
many new authors with varying views
on the same subject have sprung into
being.
Many of the books that she has
donated have been mutilated, by
pages out for reproducing
illustrations therefrom in her own
Journals ,for her real purpose in ac-
quiring these books in the first place
was so that she could bring to Aus-
tralia the most interesting develop-
ments in building or architecture for
the benefit of the entire building
fraternity. They could never have
obtained these otherwise, for many of
them, like John Britton’s Cathedral
Series, are unpurchasable. She hopes
therefore that, where pages are torn,
builders will understand it is because
their contents were called upon to
circulate widely, in order that they
might benefit the greatest number.
The pages as a whole have not been
lost, but have been placed loosely in
their respective books, awaiting a lib-
rarian’s attention.
After George Taylor died in 1928,
Mrs. Taylor ceased to acquire books.
There was no further time to absorb
their contents, for she had deter-
mined to devote her whole life to con-
tinuing the work of both Mr. Taylor
and herself in her publishing house.
As it chanced, not many new books
were published as time and the wars
had carried off many of the authors
ties on different subjects, and they
would not have had much of a reader-
ship if they produced publications.
Everyone was stunned. After the
war came the depression, when every-
one was too poor to print books or
even to buy them. There was hardly
a sheet of paper available to print
them on. The whole world seemed to
be reduced to penury.
Technical books are coming to
light again now. The world has
changed very rapidly. Many of the
fine works and most knowledgeable
compilations can never again be pub-
lished, so that they have become
priceless possessions.
Nuclear science is taking its place
alongside of engineering science, but
it must be remembered that a founda-
tion, such as these old books offered,
was vital to everyone embarking in
these spheres then, and they are still.
They must ever remain the founda-
tion of the great minds in the know-
ledge they have to give.
An instance of giving old books
away was experienced by Mrs. Taylor
herself in connection with her en-
cyclopaedia, when, having purchased
the 1924 edition of Encyclopaedia
Britannica, she gave the 1900 edition
awav. She thought the new set
would replace the old, and though
she has acquired a new edition of this
and others since, covering practically
the same field, she considers that
giving the first edition away was her
greatest loss, as without old books
one cannot look back to the previous
days for comparisons to acquire a
built-up knowledge.
One book, on architectural orna-
ment, could never again be printed,
as no one would ever again acquire
such a wealth of energy and learning
as to draw so accurately and beautiful-
ly. Some there may be who could
copy what is before them, but no one
will ever again be able to make the
researches into the ornamentation of
all the nations to compile a work such
as this. At least, not with the 40-
hour week complex which has become
a religion in Australia.

cannot possibly live now on the rentals
that were based on 1939 figures.

£1,000,000 Hospital For Port Moresby
TENDERS BEING CALLED.
The Administration of Papua and
New Guinea plans to erect a Base
Hospital at Port Moresby for the
European and native populations
which will provide full nursing, surgi-
cal, X-Ray, and laboratory facilities, at
a cost exceeding £1,000,000.
Tenders are being called for the
first stage of the construction which
consists of the native hospital build-
ings, married and single native staff
quarters and maintenance and service
buildings.
The hospital buildings consist of an
administrative block incorporating
dental and casualty sections, an
operating block, one full nursing ward
to accommodate 36 beds, four part
nursing wards accommodating a total
of 160 beds, and three isolation wards
accommodating a total of 120 beds.
A kitchen and mess is provided for
both staff and patients, with a separate
mess for the isolation patients. All
the buildings are single-storied and
are connected by covered ways.
The staff quarters provide accom-
modation for 30 married natives and
30 single natives, together with re-
creational facilities. The maintenance
and service buildings comprise a
store, laundry, garage, workshop,
boiler house and incinerator.
The work includes air-conditioning
of the operating block, steam-raising
plant and reticulation, water, sewerage
and power.
The construction generally is con-
crete floors, timber-framed walls and
corrugated asbestos roofing. All mate-
rials, including timber, will be im-
ported from sources outside the
Territory.
Plans and Specified Bills of Quan-
tities are available from the Directors

Melbourne News-letter
General Motors-Holdens Limited’s
announcement of a building expan-
sion programme of £7,250,000 is one
of the most interesting made since
the war.
The programme will allow the
companv to increase its output to 300
cars a day, or 72,000 a year. The
new extensions will increase the floor
area of G.M.-H. factories from 81 to
100 acres.
A few years ago G.M.-H. bought
a 153-acre site at Dandenong, Mel-
bourne, close to the International
Harvester Coy.’s and Heinz Coy.’s fac-
tories, with frontages to the Prince’s
Highway and the main Gippsland
railway.
The company now proposes to
build an assembly and body-building
plant on portion of this land. The
building will have a total floor area
of 550,000 square feet, and will cost
without machinery or equipment—
more than £2,840,000. The company
claims that the Dandenong plant will
be the most modern operated by the
G.M. organisation in any country.
New buildings with a floor area of
95.000 square feet, or two and one-
acres, will be built at Fisher-
men s Bend, Melbourne, bringing the
total floor space of this plant to 26|
acres. The buildings and equipment
# there wfll cost about £1,610,000.
At Woodville. South Australia,
£2,110,000 will be expended in in-
creasing the floor area of this plant
from 1,550,000 square feet to 166,000
square feet, or 3| acres. This build-
ing will become the largest body-
building and metal-pressing plant in
the Southern Hemisphere.
T he assembly plant at Pagewood,
N.S.W., will be further extended by
50.000 square feet at a cost, includ-
ing equipment, of £558,000.
At the 'chicle assembly plant,
Mosman Park, Perth, £78,000 will be
expended on extensions, and £30.000
will be spent at Birkenhead. Port

Building Industry Congress
of Victoria.
In his presidential address at the
Annual Meeting of th e Building In'
dustry Congress of Victoria, Mr. D.
B. Doyle, 0.8. E., said that while a
very substantial recovery of business
generally had taken place in the past
twelve months, it was necessary to be
on guard against the recovery causing
a revival of the various factors re'
sponsible for the previous recession.
Mr. Doyle added: ”A serious
symptom accompanying the revival of
industry is the renewal of rolling
strikes. It is the responsibility of
management in the constructional
field to take a strong stand in combat-
ing the influences menacing the
economy, whilst seeking ways of rec-
tifying grievances by means of con-
ference and discussion.
“The competition for labour has
had the effect of creating demands by
the unions for increased margins.
The resistance to these demands by
the Master Builders has not been
fully supported by some of their
clients. The anxiety to get buildings
completed has prompted many clients
to agree to pay increased rates.”
Mr. Doyle pointed out that the
quantity of cement available to the
public was becoming less and less,
despite peak production at Geelong.
Mr. Doyle attributed the shortage
to the exclusive use being made of
local cement bv the Government for
public works. He said there were
prospects of a surplus of cement in
other States and suggested that a con'
cessional freight rate should be
considered.
Transport costs were so high now
that cement from other States was
more costly in Melbourne than
cement imported from overseas.
Mr. W. J. Vines, Managing Direc'
tor of Lewis Berber and Sons (Vic.)
Ltd., was elected Congress President.
Acknowledging his election. Mr.
Vines said: ‘T think we face a period
of change in our thinking towards
Congress and towards one another.
We will perform our task of console
dating the interests of our members
and make whatever changes have to
be made in our policy or constitution
in order to do so. But such changes
can only be made by the force of
reasoning and persuasion from the
people within Congress.”
Other members elected to the
Executive Committee of Congress
were:—
Vice-Presidents, W. Bclcombe Grif-
fiths, T. W. Morris.
Hon. Treasurer, R. W. Everett.

CAMOUFLAGE— FOR EFFECT.
The use of camouflage to make things not-what-they-seem was highly developed
in wartime. Here is an illustration of the technique for civic purposes. The
building shown here, near Warsaw, so tidy, so nice and orderly, would never be
guessed as being a brickworks.

Half'threats to officially re'impose
restrictions upon building of dwellings
at the seaside, unless the place is to
be occupied as a permanent resh
dence, have vanished, since the
futility of the proposal towards mak'
ing mote building material available
became ventilated.
The makers of fibre and tile roof'
ing announced that there was no
shortage (galvanised iron roofing has
become nearly a back number because
of its early corrosion from sea air);
local sawmillers advised that s'.ocks
were ample and their market circum'
scribed: local brickmakers had the
same advantages. It must be remem-
bered that a great proportion of the
new dwellings are luxurious holiday
hauints for sun'seeking southerners.
At a recent meeting of the Southport
Town Council, applications for build'
ing permits for £96,000 were dealt
with. Of course, buildings other than
dwellings come in for a share. In the
last year, figures for new buildings
reached nearly £3,000,000.
In the City of Brisbane, no less
than 864 permits to build were ap'
proved during August. This is a
marked increase in numbers on some
previous months. Mostly dwellings,
of course, below the £3OOO type: but
over that figure to £4OOO there were
47 permits, also an increase in recent
numbers of these better types.
There were 15 other permits for
dwellings exceeding £4OOO, and up to
£BOOO (one), £6lOO (one), over
£5OOO (six). Three buildings and
additions to flats account for £ll,OOO,
and six factories will cost from £3OOO
to £BOOO each. One, a tobacco fac'
tory at Northgate, will cost £60,000.
Of the 13 permits for new shops,
the highest in value were one each at
£24,000 and £25,000; one each at
£13,000, £12,500, £11,000; the eight
o.hers ranging from £6OOO to £3OOO
each. A foundry will take £40,000;
a bulk store, £6000; a transport
depot, £15,000; a branch fire station,
£12,500; a garage, £5000; alterations
to transfer a shop to a bank, £8,300.
A church is to cost £3600, and two
church halls will take £4OOO and
£5OOO, respectively. A club hall will
require £3500, and the rebuilding of
the German Club will account for
£BOOO.
When the “Kangaroos and Kricket'
ers” of England meet again, the Bris'
bane Cricket Ground should have
spent £5OOO in greater protection
from the midsummer sun, a hoary old
bug'bear in December sunshine.
Spurred on, no doubt, by the
Licensing Authority, two hotels will
each spend <£lo,ooo in additions and
improvements.
There is increased activity to be
seen along the suburban railways,
where widening is being carried out
to prepare for the electrification of
passenger trains. In several places,
the work involves the removal of very
hard rock in cuttings upwards of 50
feet in height. Completion of the
work involving new stations, and over'
bridges and all the paraphernalia
entering into so large an undertaking,
cannot be envisaged, even if times re'
main normal (how well Sydney
people, looking at the overhead rail'
way bridge at Circular Quay, know
this).
Although the new building for F.
H. Paulding 5? Co. Ltd., manufactur'
ing chemists throughout Australia,
will not be started until the end of
the year, two floors of a six'Storied
warehouse will cost £50,000, includ'
ing foundations slrong enough to
carry the remainder. The building will
have a frontage of 80ft. to Barry
Parade.
Surely the number of vast hospitals
throughout the country must be an
indictment against the manner in
which humanity lives—and dies. Next
month, the foundation will be laid
for a hospital for incurabes, under
the conduct of an R.C. order of
charity, though caring for the incur'
ables of both sexes and all creeds,_
ages, races and classes. The building,
at Kangaroo Point, is. to be of six
storeys in steel, concrete, and brick,
with provision for 154 beds. Tenders
have alreay closed for the foundations
of the building to cost £340,00, ex'
elusive of furniture and fittings.
Estimated time of construction is two
and a half years. State Government
subsidy will be £lOOO per bed.
Seventeen miles south of Surfers’
Paradise a sale has been made of a
hotel at Coolangatta for £BO,OOO. An
ex'bank clerk, still in his forties —Mr.
C. M. Whi.ehouse— is chairman of
directors of a company which has
acquired a chain of seven hotels,
valued at £1,000,000, throughout
Queensland. The border line of New
South Wales is little more than a
“stone’s throw” from the Hotel
Coolangatta, which is the “seventh.”
The Brisbane Ciy Council in re'
cent months placed orders for vehicles
and heavy equipment to the value of
£lll,OOO, much of it by way of
replacements.
In opening a £43,000 R.C. Church
at Windsor, Archbishop Duhig said
that during his residence in Brisbane,
since 1912, more than 50 churches
had been built at costs ranging from
£2OOO to £50,000, rates that could be
more than doubled at Today’s prices.

live on the lead, zinc and metals pro-
duction of the Mt. Isa mine, bid to
create a large inland city in the
“never never’’ of recent history.
Taking time by the hand, the Mt. Isa
Mines Ltd. has retained a leading
town planner - architect, Mr. Carl
Langer, to prepare an extensive plan
for the needs of the growing
community.
Already, the mining population is
well housed, with most of the ameni-
ties of city householding. The high
wages, plus the lead bonus which all
employees of the company enjoy, pro-
vide a high standard, if not an
affluent living. Town planners who
have had “bunches’’ of archaic alder-
men to try and satisfy with town plans,
will felicitate Mr. Langer on being
retained by an up-to-date company of
competent judges of the necessary
homes, halls, shops, parks, etc . He is
also a tree-lover, with a flare for tree-
surgery.
The great trek of seven 22-ton
heavy earth-moving trucks on the 2600
miles journey overland from Brisbane
to Rum Jungle began at Brisbane on
September 2. The trucks came from
New York, at the instance of the
English company of Blackwood
Hodge (Aust.) Ltd., and those who
know the roads—made and unmade—
these heavy vehicles must travel over,
will wish them well, and without the
need to use the two-way radio-
equipped utility that leads the
cavalcade.
The garden city of Toowoomba—
next to Brisbane in point of its popu-
lation, somewhat in excess of 40,000
people —is starting its Civic Square
scheme, to cost £250,000 over a
period of years, by beginning immedi-
ately to build a child-minding centre,
at a cost of £45,000. Other buildings
to follow will be a new city council
administration block, philharmonic
hall, returned soldiers’ hall, bus
terminal and waiting depot, and a
swimming pool of Olympic standard.
A new street and the planting of
wind-breaks at the civic square will
both add to the adornment and com-
fort of a city 2000 to 2500 fet above
sea level, where the Winters can be
really cold. When the new adminis-
tration block is built, the present
town hall will house the contents of
the art gallery more suitably than is
possible in the present restricted
space.
Toowoomba had a benefactor in
the late Mr, Fred Gould, who willed
his art collection of a lifetime, as a
memorial to his wife, and it was so
extensive as to occupy more space
than the room could provide for it,
to enable the many gems to be dis-
played to advantage.
The beauty created in Toowoomba
by its many trees in the streets and
parks, to supplement the fine gardens
adjoining lots of very picturesque
homes, owes its origin to the days—•
60 or 70 years ago—when the late
Mr. W. H. Groom, father of the late
Sir Littleton Groom, planted the first
street trees.
The Premier (Mr. Gair) recently
opened a new visual education centre
and library at the Wilston State
School. The cost of an ornate build'
ing, unlike many of the stereotyped
designs of former school buildings,
was £6OOO.
With much less delay than is too
characteristic of many works under'
taken, the Town of South Coast (the
centre of which is Southport) is
already under way with its £2,000,000
project to dam the mountain streams
of the Great Dividing Range, to pro'
vide a constant and reliable water
supply for the South Coast towns
from Southport to Coolangatta. Bulb
dozers are biting their way into the
lower reaches of the mountain, which
rises to 3500 feet, with waterfalls
and a canyon at Springbrook that
would do full justice to the Blue
Mountains. Only about one mile of
the access road to the site of the dam
remained to be completed at the end

of August. Every effort is being made
to avoid spoiling any of the beauty of
this fascinating valley of the Nerang
River, and the time to be taken over
the job—six years—gives some indica-
tion of its extent.
The very central position of the
new M.L.C. building, for which the
foundations are put in at the corner
of Adelaide and Edward Streets, is a
source of much interest to passersby.
The spectacle of eight storeys of steel
and concrete being taken down from
an adjoining building of modern con-
struction, displays the modern work-
man at his best on a very hazardous
job calling for skill. On the demoli-
tion of the walls and floors, there re-
mained the gaunt skeleton of steel
and concrete. The former material
was removed by drills, and steel had
to be cut by oxy-acetylene and
lowered to the basement prior to
being loaded on to motor trucks for
disposal elsewhere.
A new wing to Xavier Home for
crippled children, costing £12,000,
was opened early in September at
Cavendish Road, Coorparoo.
With £250,000 in hand from col-
lections towards the completion of St.
John’s Cathedral, estimated to cost
£400,000 at least, it is now proposed
to make some modifications in the
original plans by Sir John Pearson,
and then begin the foundations. On
the estimate of a leading Brisbane
contractor that the work would take
ten years, unless the unexpected took
place in the dearth of stonemasons,
it is felt that £25,000 in each of these
years could be collected, so that the
completed Cathedral would open free
of debt.
Adelaide News-letter
Building of the new satellite town
at Salisbury, 17 miles north of Ade-
laide. has begun. The town is ex-
pected to have a population of 25,000
within ten years. The project, which
will cost about £20,000,000, is South
Australia’s greatest town - planning
move since Colonel Light designed
Adelaide in 1836. The S.A. Housing
Trust has arranged for three firms—
Orlit S.A, Ltd., Elsdon Bros., and M.
& D. Richardson—to build the first
batch of homes. More metropolitan
building firms will be engaged later.
Two firms have already asked for fac-
tory sites in the town. The project
will include more than 6000 homes,
as well as industries, shops, churches,
schools, and theatres.
Adelaide’s staid skyline is gradually
changing as more new buildings go
up. Modern shops and offices are
spring up all over the city. The
Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney
has already moved into its new
premises in King William Street—
Adelaide’s first post'war building.
The old Dunlop building in Flinders
Street is being rebuilt into a four'
storey construction. Flints has dis'
appeared from the corner of Bank
and Hindley Streets to make way for
a multistorey branch of the S.A. Sav'
ings Bank. Smith’s furniture store,
next to the bank site in Hindley
Street, is receiving a face-lift.
In Grenfell Street, the site for the
offices of Murray River Wholesale
Cooperative Ltd. is being excavated.
Next door, McLeay Furnishers are re'
modelling a building for their use.
Alterations to Gay’s Arcade, between
Adelaide Arcade and Twin Street,
have not yet started, but when
finished the arcade will be the most
modern shopping centre in Adelaide.
Next to the State Electricity Trust
building in North Terrace, a seven-
storey block of professional chambers
will be built. In addition, St. Peter’s
College will erect a 12-storey building
on the corner of Gawler Place and
Grenfell Street, and Harvard Chambers
in North Terrace will soon be de-
molished to make way for a seven-
storey steel-framed building.
W. C. Burne & Sons Pty. Ltd.
have signed a contract for the erection
of the Corpus Christi Seminary at
Glen Waverley. which is an outlying
suburb of Melbourne. The contract
figure exceeds £BOO,OOO.
The proiect consists of seminary
accommodation and a chapel to seat
600 or 700 persons and comprises
about two-thirds of the whole scheme.
The buildings are to be mainly of
salmon-coloured brick struc.ure, with
black manganese base, and are prob-
ably the largest of their kind to be
constructed in a cloistral design.
The architect is Mr. Cyril C. Kelly.
The latest announcement of a
major city building has been made by
the City Mutual Life Assurance So'
ciety Ltd., which will erect a 12'
storey structure at the corner of King
William and Pirie Streets. The build'
ing will be 132 ft. high, built of the
most modern lightweight steel frame
construction. The ground floor will
be faced with granite, and the upper
storeys with stone. W’ork on the new
building is expected to start early in
1955, and should be completed within
18 months. The architects are Woods,
Laybourne'Smith and Irwin.
Demolition of the 103'year'old
Windsor Castle Hotel and the adjoin'
ing Morialta Chambers, in Victoria
Square, is almost completed. A new
11'Storey insurance building will rise
on the site. Contractors for the de'
molition are the S.A. Salvage Co.
Permission has been given for the
erection of a £60,000 ho el on Tor'
rens Road, Kilkenny. The license
was granted to Mr. James Cornelius
May, on condition that the hotel is
built within the next three years. It
will be known as the Challa Gardens
Hotel, and will include two storeys
and accommodation for 19 guests.
The 12 bedrooms will each have
attached bathrooms.
The two'storey Albion Hotel in
Churchill Road, Kilburn, is expected
to be completed by Christmas. Work
on the building, which is of concrete,
steele, and cream brick, has reached
the second'Storey stage. There will be
three lounges, two main bars and two
cocktail bars, all centrally heated.
Building costs will total at least
£60,000. The architects are Caradoc
Ashton. Fisher, Woodhead and Beau-
mont Smith, and Emmett and Son.
Ltd. are the contractors.
Work has started on another big
hotel —the proposed £65,000 Flinders
Hotel on Grand Junction Road, Rose-
water Gardens. The design, by Evans
and Bruer, Philpot and Partners, is
something new in S.A. hotel plan-
ning. It incorporates a beer garden
and covered way. The private en-
trance is screened by wide lawns and
flowering shrubs. Foyer, public lounge
and dining room are grouped around
this garden. For guests there will be
a private sitting room, seven double

bedrooms with running water, and a
private suite with bathroom, bedroom,

Fricker Bros.
Tenders will be called soon for
construction of the proposed 40-bed
Burnside War Memorial Hospital.
The State Government has granted a
£66,000 subsidy for the work, on a
£ for £ basis. The plans envisage an
entrance hall and administration
offices, surgical wing of 12 beds and
operating suite, medical wing of 12
beds, children’s section of six beds,
maternity wing of 10 beds, and
kitchen block. The architects, Hassell
and McConnell, expect the job to be
completed within two years.
Mr. Henry Wilckens has been
elected President of the S.A. Builders
and Contractors’ Association, to sue-
ceed Mr. R. J. Nurse. Other officers
elected at the Association’s Annual

The S.A. Cement Co. will soon put
into into operation the final section
of its enlarged plant at Angaston.
This will lift its capacity to about
150,000 tons —60,000 more than last
year’s production and bring the
State's total output to about 300,000
tons. Present indications are that the
S.A. demand will absorb 250,000 tons.
The new plant should quickly put an
end to S.A’s. chronic cement short-
age, and a balance may be available
for export to other States.
A Melbourne firm recognised as
Australia s leading hospital architects
—has been appointed joint architects
with an Adelaide firm to speed up
construction of the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, Woodville. The architects
appointed are Stephenson and Turner,
of Melbourne, and Caradoc Ashton,
Fisher, Woodhtad and Beaumont
Smith, of Adelaide. The appoint-
ment was made following a top-level
boil-up over the slow progress of the
work, which was formerly under the
supervision of the Architect-in-Chief’s
Department.
A new building with a two-storey
frontage to West Terrace will be com-
pleted soon. It is the new £65,000
warehouse and showrooms of Oliver
J. Nilsen and Co. Ltd. All the firm’s
city activities will be centred in the
building. Woods, Bagot, Laybourne-
Smith and Irwin are the architects.
The S.A. Harbours Board will

Kangaroo Island are expected to cost
about £30,000. Tenders for the job
close on September 22. The architect
is Walter D. Cowell, of Adelaide.
The new Keith and District Hos'
pital will be officially opened late in
October by the Chief Secretary (Sir
Lyell McEwin). Work is now in the
final stages. Cost of building the nine'
bed hospital was about £18,500.
Gordon C. Brown was the architect,
and the contractors were A. W.

A new storey will be added to
Elder House, Currie Street, for the
Elder Trustee Executor Co. Tenders
will close shortly, and building is ex-
pected to start soon. The building at
present includes a ground floor and
three upper storeys. Architects for
the alterations are Woods, Bagot,
Laybourne-Smith and Irwin.
A 4800 square inch mosaic, formed
by fourfold enlargement of about 20
aerial photos, is expected to aid
master planning for the development
of metropolitan Adelaide. Such a
mosaic has been suggested by local
architects, and experts say it could be
prepared within a few weeks. Each
photo, originally about 7in. square,
will cover about 25 square miles
from 19,000 ft. altitude. When en-
larged to a scale of about 4in. to the

The S.A. Housing Trust will prob'

man (Mr. J. P. Cartledge) has an'
nounced that, due to the great demand
for this type of home, the Trust
thought it would be justified in let'
ting another contract, probably for
about 100 dwellings. This would
bring the total to 208. The first con'
tract was for 108 homes. The first of
these will be ready for occupation
before the end of October.
The new Penola Memorial District
Hospital is expected to be completed

architects are McMichael and Harris.
Sage, Bigham and Ferguson are the
principal contractors.
The foundation stone of a new
£60,000 wing for Minda Home,

£20,000 to build, and seats 1300.
Hansen 6? Yuncken Pty. Ltd. were
the contractors.
The Studio Theatre—established in
Wellington Sauare, North Adelaide,
for non-professional acting groups—
will open on October 6. It will be
among the most modern theatres of
its kind in Australia and will seat 350.
Dean W. Berry and Gilbert are the
architects, and Webber and Williams
are the contractors.
Plans for 2289 houses, valued at
more than £6,000,000, have been ap-
proved suburban councils this year.
The biggest number 498, costing
£1,158,160 —was approved by Marion
Council.
A £lO,OOO contract for supply of
recording instruments for the Port
Pirie uranium treatment plant has
been let to the Melbourne firm of
Noyes Bros.
A £50,000 drive-in theatre will be
built at West Beach. It will accom-
modate 500 cars and should be com-
pleted by Christmas. One feature new
to drive-in theatres will be a quick
‘‘getaway” lane to obviate traffic
jams.
The S.A. Home Builders’ Club
built only 30 houses during the past
12 months. This is far below the
Club’s peak rate of “a home a week,”
maintained up to a year ago. The
building drop was revealed at the
Club’s annual meeting recently. The
reason is the serious drop-off in mem'
bership—a trend that has club officials
really worried. Officers elected were:
President. Mr. A. Hughes; Secretary,
Mr. E. Hargreaves; District Orga'
nisers, Messrs. F. Saint, A. Wilson,
and S. Moore.
A team of air explorers has dis-
covered a lost world of 100,000
people behind the mountain ranges of
S.W. New Guinea. The inhabitants,
who live in sunny, cultivated valleys,
have been cut off from the outside
world for thousands of years.
In a single year, a person's eyes
move up and down, forward, back'
wards, sideways, at least 36,000,000
times —the eyelids 94,000,000 times.
GLASS IN BUILDING DESIGN
The development of glass, transparent and semi-transparent, tough and strong,
has made possible its use as a building material. In the construction of this rail-
way station building in Rome, the imaginative use of glass both tor roof, walls
and doors admits the full introduction of daylight into what otherwise be
a somewhat dim interior. The S-shaped roof, supported on slender marble-faced
columns, covers a 775 ft. length of the concourse in the 93ft. high building. Top:
Side view of the platform roof, showing it as a continuous skylight. Below: Large
side wall glazing admits a maximum of light into the main concourse.

Revelite Wall
Enamels
Taubman’s New Product.
The announcement by Taubmans
(N.S.W.) Pty. Limited of their new
product—Revelite Wall Enamels —
should be of interest to the architec-
tural profession.
To-day’s trend in contemporary
architecture, placing the emphasis on
the maximum concentration of light
in the design of schools, hospitals,
administrative blocks and factories,
etc., has highlighted the need for
top-quality enamels resistant to the
ravages of hard wear and exposure,
enamels that can be washed or
scrubbed frequently, and supply a
flexible colour range which gives an
assurance for colour harmony in any
scheme of interior. Since these new
wall enamels are intermixable in their
respective finishes, an unlimited
range of contrasting and harmonis-
ing colours is simply and speedily
attainable.
During their fifty years of paint
manufacture this progressive Austra-
lian Company has followed a policy
of close liaison between their highly-
trained staff of Industrial Chemists
and Overseas Associates; using ad-
vanced scientific techniques to de-
velop better products; supplying as it
does the paint needs of a large per-
centage of the nation.
Some twelve years ago, market re-
search revealed the necessity to de-
velop and produce an alkyd-based
enamel formulation to overcome paint
surfacing problems, brought about
by contemporary architectural and
building methods. From the first
indication the paint industry initiated
a concentrated research and develop-
ment programme, involving thousands
of separate and individual experiments
to keep pace and provide a satisfac-
tory answer to this trend.
Backed by the Company reputa-
tion, under the one name—Revelite—
these new products come in identical
colours in the three finishes. Flat,
Semi-Gloss, and Full-Gloss, with addi-
tional strong colours in the Full-
Gloss for use on trims.

Atomic Power For
Industry
U.S. and Australia Are Interested.
President Eisenhower this week
started, by electric impulse, construe'
tion of the first full-scale atomic
power plant dedicated to the peace'
ful uses of mankind.
He took part in the ceremonies
without leaving his summer White
House at Denver, Colorado, some
1200 miles from the scene of the pro'
posed plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania.
As the President passed a radio'
active wand through an electric field,
it created an electric impulse that
flashed instantaneously to the power
plant site.
The signal set a bull'dozer in
action digging the first earth for lay'
ing the foundations. Completion of
the plant is expected within the next
three years.
Experience for Engineers.
The power plant is being built by
the Duquesne Light Company, in CO'
operation with the U.S. Atomic
Continued overleaf.
CONCRETE DESIGN IS NEAT AND EFFECTIVE.
The use of concrete in low-cost buildings can be effectively treated to give an
atmosphere of individuality without elaboration, as illustrated in this College of
Commerce at Liverpool, England. It combines slender vertical columns to give a
panel effect, and large windows admitting a maximum of daylight to the class-
rooms. It was designed by a panel of eminent architects.

Energy Commission. It is designed
to generate 60,000 kilowatts of
electricity.
The project will enable engineers
to gain design and technology experi-
ence in planning of atomic-power
plants for industry.
Atomic Power for Australia?
Seven nations soon will join an in-
formation pool to develop the use of
civilian atomic power. Co-operation
of the nations, including Australia,
may make atomic power for industry
practicable in five years. The other
nations are U.S.A., Britain, Canada,
France, Belgium, and South Africa.
The Federal Cabinet has decided to
join the pool, recently proposed by
the U.S.
Washington has been advised that
Australia is ready to start formal ne-
gotiations to bring the pool into
existence, which probably will start
operating about the end of the year.
The pool will:—-
• Arrange for exchange of atomic
information between the seven
nations.
• Provide for co-operative research
to prevent overlapping of research
activities.
• Arrange for an international re-
search school in America to which
the seven nations will send atomic
scientist.
• Hold some uranium for peaceful
use like power for industry and for
medical uses.
When the scheme begins operating,
Australian scientists will work on spe-
cific tasks of research allocated them
by the seven-nation pool.
N.S.W. May Win
Atomic Power Race
According to persistent reports,
N.S.W. may produce the first atomic
power in Australia.
It is believed that the first labora-'
tory for research into power produc-
tion from uranium will be built in
this State.
However, such a move would bring
loud protests from the South Austra-
lian Premier, Mr. Playford. He con-
siders that his State has a major
claim because of its uranium mining
at Radium Hill, and treatment plants
at Port Pirie and Thebarton.
Mr. Playford contends that an
atomic power laboratory established in
another State would divide the limited
technical knowledge and manpower
available.
SCIENCE OF KEEPING FIT.
T he Magic of Colour.
G. K. Chesterton’s “invisible man”
was the postman or the policeman,
whom, seeing so often, we cease to
see at all. On the same showing,
much of our world to-day has receded
out of sight and needs revisiting.
Strangely enough, included among
the things apt to be lost in the mists
of familiarity is that on which all
recognition depends, namely, LIGHT
itself.
Illumination has become something
of a new art, and where this new art
is practised effec'ively the sense of
excitement awakens and tension is
increased.
Colour at night, the spectrum glow-
ing in darkness, the oldest setting and
scenery of feasts, is irresistible. The
magic and the mystery of colour, its
poten: therapy, it s good cheer and its
lively joy present an enchantment
that is invaluable to health.
A soldier who has regained his
sight will declared, “Colour—l had
forgotten its glory.” Colour, bright-
ness, illumination, these are means to
the end of a sound mind in a sound
body. It is well to go out into the
light in these days; but it is well, in
addition, to secure that light shall
come in to us, whether at work, at
home, by day and also by night.
—“Times Review of Industry.”
THE DISCOVERY OF ASBESTOS
By HERODOTUS JONES
In days that were older, when travellers much bolder
Returned from their travels in far, foreign places,
They told of a Dragon, who got quite a jag on
By dining on maidens with fair forms and faces.
This reptilian blowtorch would wake up and go scorch
Ten acres of wheat or some ripe avocados.
A clerk and a farmer and strong men in armour
Were burned into clinkers, attempting bravados.
At last cried a yokel, “The knights and the folk’ll
Rebel if the King does not find a solution.
A maiden each meal is a bit more, we feel,
Than allowed for taxation by our constitution.”
Now the King had a lancer, a sly necromancer,
Whom he ofttimes consulted when troubled or puzzled.
So he said, “Have a flagon, and tell how a dragon
Who breathes fire and brimstone can safely be muzzled.”
The lancer said, “When you can vary his menu
With morsels more tempting from your commissary—
Or zebra, or kumquat, or fried dromedary.
This fire-breathing Dragon will still cause a sag in
Your kingdom’s resources and pain to the nation,
But a quick change of diet will very soon quiet
Rebellion, and also revive propagation.”
Now down near the moat lived a very old goat
Whose habits of eating were simply uncanny.
Instead of the hay they served him each day
He munched fibrous rock from an amphibole cranny.
Though the council derided, the King soon decided
This goat was the least cherished thing in the nation,
And as such could be handed when the Dragon demanded
A meal, or the choice of still more conflgration.
The decision once rendered, the old goat was tendered
The Dragon, who steamed at this tempting hors d’oeuvres,
And he puffed and he blew, and he flamed all anew
But the goat marched ahead with consummate nerve.
The Dragon rushed out with with a puff and a shout,
And swallowed this morsel of choice mutton shoulder.
He had no sooner finished, than his smoking diminished,
And his roar and his fire started to smoulder.
Two feeble sorties and then rigor mortis
Conducted the Dragon from here to hereafter.
With his last feeble wifMe, from within came a giggle,
Then a peal of some loud and satirical laughter.
Thus died the last Dragon, who managed to lag on
A century or two after others were dead.
He should never have tasted a goat who just wasted
His hay, and dined on asbestos instead.
And thus we discovered, the goat had uncovered
A poison for dragons, and a boon to the nation;
And the goat lived to savour the texture and flavour
Of asbestos shingles and bat insulation.
—“The Journal of the American Institute of Architects.

COMPACT AND SPREADING PLANS.
Judging by the area covered by the bottom left plan, it is endowed with a site somewhat more spacious than that usually
met with in suburban development, although the plan does extend parallel with the side boundaries. The two upper plans,
on the other hand, would be particularly suitable for the average 50ft. building block, one providing two bedrooms and a din-
ing room, and other three bedrooms and a living-room combining the general facilities of eating and leisure. The bottom
right plan spreads across the site and would require probably a 60ft. block to do it justice.

The Randwick Council is propos-
ing to erect a =£130,000 community

offered a £lOO,OOO loan to build the
first stage.
There is considerable building
activity evident in the Sydney busi-
ness area. Many premises are receiv-
ing extensive “face-lifts,” in the way
of alterations and additions, while a
number of new buildings are being
constructed in the city. Many more
are scheduled for early commence-
ment, including several new banks.
Considerable suburban building is
under way, and many homes, factories,
and commercial structures are spring-
ing up in outlying industrial areas,
notably Bankstown.
However, home-building costs have
been steadily rising in N.S.W. in the
last six months, and the demand for
building has created a labour shortage.
“There are not just enough work-
men to go round,” a prominent
Master Builder said.
The irregular supply of building
materials is delaying home-building
and is increasing the cost, because
“time means money.”
He added that the rise in house
construction costs had been slight in
the last six months, “but the upward
trend continues.”
ADELAIDE LETTER.
(See also page 65.)
Third Australian Planning Congress.
The Third Australian Planning
Congress was held in Adelaide from
August 13 to 17, representatives of
all Australian States being in attend-
ance. In opening the Congress, the
Premier of S.A., the Hon. Thomas
Playford. announced that at the cur-
rent session of the S.A. Parliament
legislation in the form of an amend-
ment to the existing Town Planning
Act would be introduced, in which a
feature would be a master plan for
Adelaide and the area.
“The Bill we are bringing in,” Mr.
Playford said, “deals primarily with
questions of sub-division. It is very
much further advanced than anything
previously attempted in South Aus-
tralia. Many people will say the Bill
does not go half far enough,” he con-
tinued; “equally as many will say it
goes too far and is interfering with
the rights of the individual.
“But I believe it does, in fact, pro-
vide what is essential—a plan for
the development of our city to ensure
that the people as a whole live the
best possible life under the best pos-
sible conditions, without the need to
spend enormous and disproportionate
sums of money on public utilities.

Premier said they had in the past
been a problem and costly, so much
so that they had embarrassed public
utilities by need of essential services
in areas where the services were
probably premature and not in the
public interest. He said it was import'
ant to see that subdivisions which
did eventuate provided for roads,
recreation facilities and other utilities.
Mr. Playford referred to the desire
of town planners in making factory
areas away from housing districts.
He knew of one overseas organisa'
tion which selected S.A. in preference
to N.S.W. to centre its Australian
activities because the S.A. Govern-
ment promised it a 20'acre site sur'
rounded by 600 houses for its
workers.
Professor Gordon
Stephenson.
In his address to the Congress,
Professor Gordon Stephenson, Plan'
ning Consultant for the Metropolitan
region of Perth and Fremantle, said
it would be considered ridiculous if
anyone were to build a house with-
out a plan, as an unrelated collection
of rooms under an ill'fitting roof, yet
it is sometimes assumed that a large
and complex modern city may grow
fortuitously into a reasonable working
unit. He referred to the W.A. Gov'
ernment s decision as almost unique
in modern town planning. He added
that a regional plan of Perth and Fre'
mantle should be prepared before
anything like the worst happened.
Mr. S. B. Dickinson.
The S.A. Director of Mines. Mr.
S. B. Dickinson, told the Congress
that if an early start was made to
produce steel at Wlhyalla, production
would be possible in two years. He
said South Australia’s growth was
being determined more and more by
the distribution and extent of its
mineral resources. The resources
would become a main limiting factor
in long'range economic development.
However, they were yet undeveloped,
and there is still much scope for in'
dustrialisation. Three hundred thous'
and tons of ingot steel could be pro'
duced at Whyalla annually from the
present blast furnace supplying basic
pig iron, Mr. Dickinson said. The
ultimate aim for Whyalla, though,
would be for three such furnaces.
Whyalla would then rank equally
with Port Kembla and Newcastle,
each with a production of about a
million tons a year.
Mr, I. R. Dridan.
The Engineerdn'Chief of the SA
Engineering and Water Supply
Department said that the timeliness
of present proposals for a new deveh
opment plan is illustrated by the way
in which Adelaide’s population has
expanded since the war. It reached
300.000 in 1926, 400,000 in 1949,
and on present indications will reach
500.000 in 1956.
Subject to new developments in
science, however, availability of water
will probably be a prime factor in
limiting the population. Taking all
relevant factors into account —rising
per capita consumption supplies from
the River Murray irrigation, stock
and industrial requirements, and so on
—the estimated water resources avail'
able to Adelaide total 43,000,000 gab
lons. These would be sufficient to
serve a population of only 1,180,000.
S.A. Industries’ Expansion.
Three new industrial enterprises
will be opened in South Australia
within the next few weeks:—
On Monday, September 27, the
Hon. T. Playford, Premier of South
Australia, will officially open the
new turbine and auxiliary gear manu-
facturing plant of C. A. Parsons &
Co. (Aust.) Ltd. at Whyalla. The
managing director of the English
company, South Australiamborn Sir
Claude Gibb, will come from England
to attend.
A few days later, at Whyalla on
October 2, a 4500'ton ship, s.s. “Yar-
runga,’’ will be launched, followed
later in the month, either October
13 or 20, by the opening of South
Australia s uranium field workings at
Radium Hill. The Governor'General,

Cement Stabilised Roads.
Stabilisers Ltd., of Sydney, who
have recently opened a branch in
Adelaide, are building their first two
roads for a country corporation in
South Australia. At Port Pirie, two
main roads will be rebuilt, using the
cement stabilisation process.
Recently, at Port Pine, Mr. W.
Peters, a director of Stabilisers Ltd.,
said that soil conditions in the city
were ideal for the process. He added
that many other corporations in South
Australia were interested in the pro'
cess, and representatives on Port
Augusta Council had visited Port
Pirie and inspected the roads being
made.
New Road Machinery Plant.
The first section of the assembly
plant for Moore Road Machinery
(S.A.) Pty. Ltd., a division of MaL
colm Moore Industries Ltd., is near-
ing completion in the Adelaide sub'
urb of Gepps Cross. In the next few
months, 50 employees of the com'
pany will be employed assembling
road'making plant. A nucleus gang
of 20 employees started work at the
plant recently, and the first assembled
equipment was a hydraulically operat'
ed front'end loader and a tractor
pusher.
New S.A. Diesel Trains.
Tenders from various parts of the
world were received recently for parts
of multiple'unit diesel trains for the
South Australian Railways. Three
trains —comprising six cars, four of
which would be powered—are esti'
mated to cost £500,000. The trains
will be used on Adelaide suburban
railways, and if they are successful
in effecting substantial savings and
able to handle the passenger traffic
effectively, it is possible the Govern'
ment may abandon its £4,000,000
electrification of suburban railways
plan.
£2,000,000 BORNEO EDUCATION
PLAN.
A £2,000,000 “master plan” to
provide free education for every citi-
ben over six years old in Brunei,
Borneo, will take six to ten years to
implement. The State Council has
already approved two'thirds of the
expenditure. A network of primary
and secondary will b~ put un,
and the schooling will be followed by
technical and academic scholarships in
Britain, Australia and New Zealand
for suitable children. The plan is
largely the work of Mr. H. ]. Padmore
recently-appointed Education Officer
of Brunei State. Of the primary
schools to be built, 23 will be in
jungle areas in the interior.

At the August meeting of the
Royal Victorian Institute of Archi'
tects the guest speaker. Sir Tohn
Latham, declared that more monu-
mental buildings comparable in style
with State Parliament House should
be erected in Melbourne. Fine
buildings, he said, gave people a
great sense of pride in their city.
There were too many functional
buildings being erected; but, he added,
“I suppose we must be thanHul that,
after such a long period of inactivity,
there are some buildings actually
going up.”

BUILDING PROGRESS.
Building and allied activity in many parts of the world are depicted in this series of sketches. Top left is a house in
Northampton, England, known as "New Ways," which was described by Sir Hugh Casson in a b roadcast talk as the first
"modern" home to be built in England. Alongside (top right) is a striking modern building in Zagreb, Yugoslavia); while the
next pair contrast a new style desk and chair with a new Post Office Court House and Customs House in Albany, U.S.A.
The remarkable expansion of the G. J. Cole's organisation is emphasised by this huge warehouse being erected at Port
Melbourne. Each of the four bays extending from the facade will provide 40,000 sq. ft. of floor space entirely free of columns.

DIFFERENT ROOF SLOPES.
Different types of designs lend themselves to variations in roof slope, a point that is borne out by these four sketches Tod
right has a roof with a pitch slightly greater than usual, this feature giving character to a design which relies upon its
symmetry for its appeal. The roof on the top left and that on the bottom right are much flatter, although both have
wide eaves to give effect to the elevational treatment. With a flatter pitch roof a wider eave is possible without coming
too far down the external walls. Bottom left design is about the type of roof pitch that is generally used on cottages in
Australia to-day.
