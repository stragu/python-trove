BRISBANE, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1912.
GATHERING STRENGTH.
QUEENSLAND UNANIMOUS.
The following wire arrived at head-
quarters to-day:—
TOWNSVILLE, Tuesday.
Townsville workers are very solid.
Shopkeepers and merchants made a deter-
mined effort to resume business, but met
with poor success. Pickets succeeded in
getting nearly ad hands to knock off.
Shops are doing no business; ad boy-
cotted.' The shop assistants have formed
a strong branch of the A.W.A. Cabmen
also have formed a branch of the A.W.A.
The police are very officious and dicta-
torial, and the inspector refuses permis-
sion to hold processions and open-air meet-
ings. Some members of the force are de-
sirous of joining in a general strike move-
ment. Shipping and ad other industries
completely paralysed. Wires received by j
General Secretary McCormack from I
A.W.A. officials, stating that work has
ceased at Mackay, Bowen, Cairns, Chilla-
goe, Wolfram, Einasleigh, Mount Mor-
gan, Mount Elliott, Nelson, Childers,
Bundaberg, Sellheim, Stannary Hills, and
Charters Towers.
The Situation To-day.
Brighter than Ever.
At no moment of this great struggle was
hhe outlook brighter than at the present.
The morning musters of the respective
unions at ou” Had were in every case
greater than ever before.
At the 10 o’clock assembly in Turbot
street, Strike Leaders Coyne and Codings
spoke to a vast crowd, which has never
been equalled for numbers and enthusiasm
since the strike began. Both speakers
urged continued discipline and obedience
to orders, and a solid, quiet, determined
continuance of the “peaceful holiday.” A
representative of the “Bulletin” inter-
viewed all secretaries to-day, and also the
Strike Committee, and in every case was
assured that the men in ad trades were
more solid than ever. Confirmation of
this is the fact that ad union meetings
throughout the day have been more en-
thusiastic than ever.
The Opposing Leaders.
A well-known citizen in the camp of the
enemy admitted this morning that the two
smartest men in Brisbane were Boss
Badger and Harry Coyne. At last evi-
dently they are prepared to admit the
ability of the strike leader —evidence that
they scent defeat. There is this difference,
however, between the two men —Badger
sits entrenched only because of the power
of his wealth, while “ Harry” is enthroned
in the hearts of the people, and derives his
power from their trust and affection and
the justice of his cause.
Mass Meeting's Last Night.
The Centennial Hall was crowded in
every part last night to hear the progress
reports from the Strike Committee. Mr.
Geo. Barber occupied the chair, and the
speakers were Mrs. Miller, Mr. J. S. Cei-
lings, Mr. O’Sullivan ,M.L.A., and Mr.
Boulton. All had a fine hearing, and the
audience was roused to a high pitch of ex-
citement and enthusiasm by the fighting
speech made by Mr. Codings, who brought
the latest news from the Strike Com-
mittee.
At Ivory street, Valley, one of the
largest open-air meetings ever seen any-
where in the city took place, the audience
numbering many thousands. The speakers
were Mrs. Huxham, Mr. W. F. Finlayson,
M.P., Messrs. D. Bowman, P. A.
McLachlan, J. Payne, MM.L.A., J. Hux-
ham, and Mr. Joe Codings. The very
large audience remained till nearly 11
o’clock, and were most sympathetic and
enthusiastic.
Frightened With False Fire.
The “ Courier, ” in its leader to-day
says that evidently the energy and courage
of' those whom it alleged had created the
disturbances in the city last week had
“ oozed out on Friday last before the de-
termined action of a few score of police.”
Poor Mr. Denham. Nothing less than a
Commonwealth army would do, in his
opinion, to keep this fearful rabble
from looting the city and here his wet nurse
says a few score police did the job. But,
then, Denham was not the only one who
was panic-stricken. Some people thought
nothing less than the mooring of the
British fleet in Moreton Bay would save
them from having their throats cut in
their beds. How Andy Fisher must laugh
when he reads the “Courier’s” revised
version! The Dreadnought incident re-
called.
Swayne, the member for Mackay, is
serving as a Sworn Special. So are police
spies. The citizens of the sugar centre
ought to feel delighted at the doings of
Hie person they sent to Parliament.

pounds voted last night. Committee have

Union.
Prophetic.
A horny-handed poet writes : —This is
what Badger and his mob of satellites
would ike :
Rock-a-bye, baby, asleep in your pram H
When you grow up, you will work on a
tram,
When you are married, your wife will work,
too,
So that the Capitalists shall have nothing
to do.
Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree-top,
When you are old your wages will stop.
Then, when you’ve spent what little you’ve
saved,
Chloroform, baby! ,and off to the grave!
But methinks, they are beginning to
find they are not to have things all their
own way.
Strikers’ Ambulance Brigade.
When the first intimation reached the
Strike Committee that the Government’s
only remedy for unionists’ legitimate
grievances was the policeman’s baton and
the carbine and sword, an offer was made
by several Ambulance men to form
a brigade for the use of the army of
striking Unionists. A corps, consisting
of highly-trained men, under Superinten-
dent Busby, was quickly formed, and they
did yeoman service during the whole of
“Black Friday,” when “Chief Butcher”
Cahill and “Buckshot” Ferguson got in
:heir brutal and cowardly work in Queen
street and other places. Thus again does
:he working class evidence its undoubted
ability io carry on all the operations of
our highly civilised and complex com-
munity. Another item in our “Brains v.
Force” policy.
In Troubled Waters.
Is the “Courier” really Mr. Denham’s
rriend ? If it is, then it will cease inter-
viewing him, or at least put the curb on a
.ot of his talk. He is made to say in this
morning’s paper that the Federal Con-
stitution is evidently based on Article 4
of the American Constitution, which
reads: “The United States shall guaran-
tee to every State in this Union a Re-
publican form of government, and shall
protect each of them against invasion, and
on the application of the Legislature, or
of the Executive WHEN THE LEGIS-
LATURE CANNOT BE CONVENED,
against domestic violence.” Why did not
the Premier summon the Legislature,
then ? He was begged to dc so by the
Labour representatives in the Assembly,
but he declined. Had the Commonwealth
Government received a request from the
Queensland Parliament to call the military
out, it would most certainly have done so.
But what chance was there of such a re-
quest being made ? Mr. Denham knew
better than subject his followers to the
ordeal of having to say whether they en-
dorsed or condemned the action of an alien
autocrat, when that action would have
placed our city in a state of civil war
were it not for the great forbearance dis-
played by the populace. They will have
sins enough to answer for when they
face the electors shortly.
Brute Force for the North.
Last night- and this morning individuals
were selected from the special constabulary
for duty (?) m Rockhampton and Towns-
ville. They were each given two revolvers
and a baton. They were then lectured on
the necessity for protecting property. It
was further emphasised that order must
be maintained, even at the expense of life.
A reign of terror is rapidly covering the
land. Let us rally at the coming election,
or w© shall have an Irish Napoleon on
Australian soil in the person of Emperor
(now Major) Cahill.
An Early Glimpse of Brisbane.
A prominent citizen writes: “A few
notes on my way in to town this morning:
At Vulture stret, 5 police, 4 specials, to
guard 2 empty cars ; Sidon street, 4 police,
5 specials, 1 car (10 on board) : Tribune
street, 4 bush mounted specials; 100 yards
further, 4 specials; 50 yards, 4 mounted
police; 50 yards, 4 specials; Russell street,
12 mounted police and bush men, all in
khaki, and some at least with revolvers
rnd swords, 6 specials, and 3 police ; egress
from bridge, right side, 2 police and 6
specials. Coming off the,bridge, the sight
of these “guardians” caused me to laugh
at them, but none went further than to
glare and mutter. The whole thing is the
biggest farce I ever witnessed.
The fact that Denham has put the lid
on Bung —large and small —until February
12 makes the lying of the daily Press look
very silly.
* * *
The Centennial Hall was packed tight
with earnest men and women last night,
and the speeches were, indeed, inspiring.
“ Victory is ours,” and the lying press is
powerless to poison the minds of the
people.
* # *
“ The Courier” is going silly in her
anger. The old lady strives to make citi-
zens believe the strike is squashed by lying,
and on the same page publishes telegrams
showing how Queensland is paralysed from
Brisbane to Burketown.
* » *
Comrades in the lead, as well as in the
rank and file, are winning creditable dis-
tinction and shattering the fortress of
greed every hour. President Coyne and
all comrades are paralysing the agents of
exploitation and making history rapidly.
* * *
Fully 10,000 earnest men and women
packed into Turbot street and cheered solid
as steel when President Coyne and Com-
rade J. S. Ceilings concluded addressing
them. Carters and half a dozen other
Unions were meeting at the time.
# *
The finger prints of some of Cahill’s
stalwart specials are impressed on the
criminal records of the State.
* # *
How would the city have been served
if the Strike Committee had called out the
sanitary men and the scavengers? Would
Cahill send the Sworn Specials to do the
work of the pilgrims ?
“Specials” Threaten Girls.
The sleepy but beautiful suburb of
Brisbane known as Taringa woke up sud-
denly last week end. Someone started a
canard about a certain Labourite leading a
gang of roughs to raid and demolish some
premises in the adjoining township. This
was sufficient pretext for some Taringa
residents, and a very nervous individual
excited others to such an extent that a
Vigilance Committee was organised, and a
number sworn in as special constables.
Three of these new-made brave “ de-
fenders ” of hearths and homes, their
badges of office securely fastened on their
arms, at once proceeded to exercise their
authority. They met the daughters of a
Labour man as they were on their way
home, and, lifting their batons, said : “We
will whack you to-night.’ ’ The father and
brothers of the girls were all in town, and
nearly every one of the members of this
valiant force were aware of the fact. The
mother at once proceeded to the Taringa
Shire Council Chambers, which is the
headquarters of the Vigilance Committee,
and reported the occurrence. She was
sympathetically received, and later on was
informed that an inquiry was made
and it had been discovered that it was some
larrikins with a handkerchief on their
arms.
There is no mistake about the matter.
Those who threatened the girls were mem-
bers of the force organised, not to preserve
order and peace, but to incite some of the
unionistic residents to commit some act
that can he described as a breach of the
peace, and thus enable thtD ippet worship-
pers of a capitalistic regime to lock up or
otherwise quieten men and women who are
earnest advocates of reform.
Black Friday.
To the Editor, “Strike Bulletin.”
Sir, —In reference to Friday, 2nd in-
stant, I wish the public and all concerned
to note the following: I was quietly wend-
ing my way home through Countess street
about 1.30, when I heard a deal of shout-
ing, and on looking back I saw a body of
mounted brutes (called police) coming in
the direction of Petrie Terrace. The order
was given to clear out, and everybody ran,
I also; my husband called out “Run.” I
tried to do so, but as I suffer from heart
trouble and also am in a condition which
prevented <me from running far, I grasped
a tree in Blackall street for support, when
I was told to get away from that tree. I
staggered across the road, and got into
the reserve, and dropped into a seat in
a dead faint, and before I had time to re-
cover my senses two inhuman brutes rode
through the reserve and ordered me to
leave the seat on which I sat. As I had
nearly two miles to walk before reaching
home, I can tell you I found it very dif-
ficult to go so far. Now, if this is the
kind of treatment the police are
to use in the city of Brisbane, I would like
to know what they would do if they were
where the people were not civilised, and
I thank God that nobody belonging to me
belongs to the slaughtering band. Are
we to be trampled on and killed for trying
to do our duty as workers P —l am, &c.,
(MRS.) G. SMITH
Brisbane, th February.
Even the lawbreakers are having a holi-
day while the fooled forces are being used
to incite rebellion. Only one unfortunate
victim was prosecuted in the South Bris-
bane Police Court, and he was sent to
prison as a vagrant. ’Tis a wonder he was
not sent to serve as a Sworn Special Strike-
breaker.
* # #
Needless to state the illegally-borrowed
guns of the Commonwealth force didn’t go
off.
# # *
“ The Bulletin” has proof that an agent
of the enemy did the window-smashing in
the Valley last week. “A poor dirty tool
of the police” was also used to decoy the
reds. The plot was checkmated, and V.O.’s
disarmed the plotters who had planned to
disturb the public peace.

The Chinamen of Brisbane despise the
miserable mongrels who serve Master dur-
ing a strike. When a few of the employees
of Foy & Gibson were sweating within the
big rag shop in the Valley the Chinamen
in the vicinity boohooed them.

“ The Trouble” that was planned for
yesterday did not arrive, and the sworn
strike-breakers are greatly disappointed
’Twas humorous to see an irregular squac
of them squatting on the kerbing in South
Brisbane, smoking cigarettes. They were
armed with military rifles and daggers
fixed to feed on human flesh. “ The Grate
General” got ashamed, and withdrew them
when lie saw there was no one to shoot.

Get your name on the roll. It is not
too late. If you have not already got it
on, make application for a claim at once.

At Friday night’s meeting on Marke
Square, Myles Ferricks, M.L.A., said that
it was a disgraceful reflection on their de-
mocracy that such a state of things shoulc
be allowed to exist in a place like Queens-
land. Continuing, he criticised the action
of the employers as an attempt to starve
them into submission, but lie for one,
whilst there were ample provisions in Bris-
bane, would not see his wife or family
starve. He thought, however, that the em-
ployers would reconsider their decision.
Unionism or Badgerism.
Which is It to Be ?
Queensland Must Decide.
(Contributed.)
Order was Heaven’s first law. This
much confessed, can Mr. Denham, by any
possibility of even prejudiced vision, con-
ceive of any trend of events by which
Unionism, with the foothold it has now
obtained in the Commonwealth, can be
supplanted by Badgerism in the near or
distant future? If it cannot, then what
is the object of his persisting in his present
line of action ? Is it that he does not
wish to see Unionism attain its proper and
inevitable position without preliminary
disaster ? To ignore Unionism now
would be to abolish the Arbi-
tration Court and the Wages Boards,
and to nullify most of the humanitarian
legislation that has been placed on the
Statute Book within recent years. With-
out Unionism these would have been im-
possible, and any politician who persists
in opposing or making puny efforts to sup-
press the means by which this beneficent
legislation was enacted, testifies as plainly
as if he said it in so many words that it
was with reluctance he gave his consent
to the progressive legislation in which he
was compelled to take part.
What, then is to follow from
the present industrial conflict?
Are the men who have risked so much
and who are still prepared to make
any sacrifice—even that of life itself, if
necessary—to secure their nidus trial inde-
pendence, to degenerate into a rabble and
return to their task-masters and cry
Peccavi” P This would be the only alter-
native left them were they now to sur-
render the position they have taken up ?
Would Mr. Denham care to representsucif
men in Parliament ? Could he ever again
call them “free and independent elec-
tors” ? In what light would such “men”
be regarded by their fellow-workers in
other parts of Australia, aye, in all parts
of the civilised world ? What a glowing
picture the immigration agents would be
able to portray in Europe when inviting
fathers of families to come here: “Come
to Queensland, the only part of the Com-
monwealth where Unionism is not toler-
ated. We make every industrial autocrat
welcome there, and if the workers don’t
implicitly obey his commands we bring
out the police to coerce them into doing
so, by the aid of the baton or the bullet.
If the police are unable to do it, then we
cajole other workers, with the help of a
subsidised and grovelling Press, to do the
work for them. It doesn’t even matter
if these industrial tyrants are not British
subjects \ that they insult us every hour of
the time they live with us; that they treat
their employees m Queensland in a way
no other workers are treated in the other
States—these things don’t in the least
matter. W e gave them control of our
thoroughfares, and as they must send lots
or money back to their own country (we
also allow the' Chinaman to do that) we
see that our workers and those we have
forced to patronise thpse foreigners are as
submissive to them as we are. We will
give you at least enough to eat and a
shanty to live in, if you can onlv forget
that you have a mind or a soul of your
own Come, then, to Queensland.
meddling Federal Government cleared out
the kanakas, so we have plenty of room for
white slaves.” This is the verbal film that
could truthfully be placed before those who
ai e asked to come here, if the workers in
the present struggle do not accomplish the
humanitarian task have set them-
selves.
Mr. Denham disputes the right of
Trades Union leaders to do certain things.
How did they acquire these rights P Was
it not by the votes of those who have done
most towards the development of the
State—men who have produced the wealth
that others have so greedily grasped ?
Representatives of Unionists have been re-
turned to represent their fellow Unionists
in tjje industrial councils of the country,
just as the Premier was returned by a cer-
tain number of citizens to represent them
politically. It may be said that Trade
Unionists do not represent all the workers.
Does Mr. Denham represent all the voters
in the electorate for which he was re-
turned ? Morally and ethically Trades
Union leaders can claim to represent their
co-workers as fully and as justly indus-
trially as any politician can to represent
a certain number of voters politically.
The decisions of a body of men sent to the
industrial citadel to formulate laws for the
guidance of those who sent them there, and
amongst whom they have toiled perhaps
for years, are as binding to every right-
thinking man as if they could be enforced
by rifles and bayonets. Destroy the doc-
trine of Capitalism—that every man is to
grind as much as he can out of his fellow-
man—and then, indeed, can the sword be
converted into the plough-share.
To-night’s Meetings.
The Centennial Hall and Ivory street.
Valley, will again be the places at which
strike progress reports will be made.
