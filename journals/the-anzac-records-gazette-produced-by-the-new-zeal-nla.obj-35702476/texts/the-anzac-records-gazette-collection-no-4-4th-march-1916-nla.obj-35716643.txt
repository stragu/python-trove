Editorial Remarks.
THERE is a song with a refrain *which
begins "Here we are, here we are again !?
The Song, and some of the young ladies
who sing it, are pretty well known to most
of our readers, so we make no apology -for
opening our fourth issue with an allusion to it.
The allusion is perhaps the more appro-
priate because the unavoidable postponement
of this issue had,?judging from information
gleaned by our Editorial Detective Depart-
ment, so worked upon the minds of some
members of our Section that they had reached
the verge of despair. They thought that a
Gazette, which has now rejoined the ranks
of irregular periodicals, was missing for ever.
But we are more pertinacious than our
anxious friends imagined, and have fully
lived up to our original claim that we would


?publish the ?A.R.G.? more or less regularly
every four weeks in future.?
Most emphatically we are not dead, nor
even dying, as may be judged from the
fact that we can trace a curious contrast
between ourselves and some of our critics,
who should but do not write for us, in the
illuminating story which follows :
The Two Frogs.
Once upon a time two frogs fell into a large smooth
bowl of milk. It was impossible to hop out or to crawl
out. Frog No. I consequently gave up what was?to him?
an utterly vain struggle, and was drowned. Frog No. 2,
however, kept on swimming, and swimming, and swim-
ming, in spite of the feebleness of an almost utter
exhaustion.
He had his reward.
His motions in swimming, you see, eventually formed
a nice large pat of butter. Perched on this, he paddled it
towards the side of the bowl, and managed to hop over
the edge.
Anybody who has made butter without a
churn can imagine the terrible physical strain
which that frog underwent.
But is not that better than being a kind of
Frog No. I ? ROLLO.
An Arabian Night.
There were five of us ! It had been a ?Darda-
nelles? night, which we celebrated at a quiet
little Restaurant where an excellent dinner was
served. The Omelettes! Well, ?Iliad three.
It was at the ?but stay, the place must
remain a secret, else I am afraid that its
splendid cuisine might be so much appreciated
that my next visit would result in my eyes
meeting that most comprehensible sign??Out
of bounds to ?!
They had fine Claret. We sampled it!
They kept Mumm?s, and we persuaded the
Padron, with much filoose, that it was quite
unnecessary to keep it any longer.
Many stories were told and reminiscences
gone over.
Many corks made acquaintance with the
ceiling.
There was the story of the time Sweeney
went out sniping; but that required another
bottle, and now I am quite unable to say
whether Sweeney ever finished the story ?or
the sniping.
But the eclat of the evening?or was it
morning?was after the happy, if boisterous,
party had cracked the last bottle and wended
their different ways.
I had a room. Here commences the story !
I had a room ?and a key. The two, of
course, are not always possessed in combi-
nation. However,-?I arrived. With a few of
his seemingly indispensable ?Allahs? the
Boab opened the door, and I, maybe in a fit of
absent-mindedness, ascended the stairs boots
in hand. Yes! that was the door. I knew it
by the the many scratches around the keyhole.
Finally,?l said finally ?the key turned the
lock and I was in the room. The electric light
was off, so I hunted up a piece of candle. (You
recollect how we used to husband the inches?)
B}r its rays I perceived, instead of the
?Psyche? which had adorned one wall, a
large print of Victor Emmanuel.
My landlady was, I know, very patriotic, as
also were her daughters, but why had she
honoured me with the portrait of her Sovereign?
I wondered ! At least I think I must have
done so, until my gaze rested on the bed. I
rubbed my eyes ! Did I see correctly, or was
I ?no, I refused to admit that.
Still, there she lay, her beautiful black hair
showing up so clearly against the white pillow.
What was to be done ? She looked so
happy, too peaceful to disturb. No ! I could
not think of such.
In the morning, as the sun streamed through
the open window, I awakened, and my senses
being much clearer than when I retired,
I thought of the prevoius night?s carouse.
I looked around. Where was she ?
I beheld her sitting on a chair gazing at me
through half closed eyes.
My landlady V-~Persian cat.

A Wet Day in Alexandria.
The saffron-tinted Desert, or
The Bedawin?s cold stare,
But makes my longing greater, for
Hibiscus-studded hair.
Wan vapours shroud this antique land,
The Sky?s a misted pall.
Somewhere the tall palms beckon, and
I hear the South Seas call.
The lamplight gives to pavement wet
An opalescent sheen,
The Bints and Waleds try to get
Piastres from the green.
The bootblacks, cowering from the storm,
Lament the awful day ;
Whilst Officers, a countless swarm,
To Groppi?s wend their way.
Egypt, you artificial fake,
You prehistoric sham,
No wiles of yours can ever make
Me care a single damn.
I only ask but one small thing
As pay for work that?s done,
Send me where nodding palm-trees fling
Their incense to the Sun,
For, when our foes are beaten,
Tis there that I would lie
Wrapped close in the star-eaten
Warm blanket of that Sky.

Advice to Song Writers.
We have notice with alarm that recently
writers of popular songs have been hard up
for names of towns or localities to which the
manor woman in the song wishes to go back.
The United States was used up long ago,
while the Mississippi River has absolutely
been worked to extinction. Asia, Africa,
Europe and South America have also been
used to a great extent, but by means of exten-
sive research work we are able to offer several
places that as yet have no little girl waiting
pay-shent-lee, or no cabaret. For example,
how about the following :
Pxvyleslizvtqhsk, Siberia.
Squeedunk, Oklahoma.
Liberia, Somaliland, German East Africa,
and Congo Free State.
Berwick-upon-Tweed, Scotland.
Mull of Galloway, Scotland.
Limburg, Germany.
Take Limburg, for instance. That?s where
the cheese is made, you know. This ought to
make fine harmony:
When this war is over, and there?s peace
throughout the world.
Then I?m going back to Germany.
I shall go to Limburg, to that dear old cheesy
town,
The town where Gwendolina waits for me;
And when at last we meet?(l shall know her
by her feet),
I?ll whisper to her softly, lovingly?
CHORUS.
I?m going back to Limburg, to the girl that I
adore.
She?s sitting on one great big cheese beside
the kitchen door :
I see her as she sits there, in her hair is twined
a rose ?
Of course she has a clothespin on her little
rosy nose.
Perhaps she loves another, but then at least
I?ll say:
Old Limburg smells to heaven, but I?m going
away!
Or how about Przmysl ? Dear old Przmysl!
The chorus like this:
In dear old Przmysl?that is where I want to be
To visit all the cabarets?there?s lots of girls
to see;
I?ll get rich in selling relics to the tourists that
come there,
The little chunks of fortresses that are
extremely rare.
Every evening I?ll go sailing on the quiet
Mxvzyl
When I get back once more at last?to dear
old Przmysl. Yale Record, ?


SATISFACTION.
It was the day before ? Good Friday?
(pay-day), and I found myself in the unhappy
but quite common position of having practic-
ally an empty pocket. On counting out the
extent of my tangible ?filoose?, I found myself
in possession of the total sum of seven piastres,
made up of one five and one two piastre piece.
I had been working later than usual in the
office, and was just wending my weary way
torwards the restaurant to partake of my
evening meal; and, not feeling at all hungry, I
decided I could well afford a two-piastre
appetiser at the nearest cafe. My drink was
ordered, and served. Reluctantly 1 withdrew
my cherished two-piastre piece from the quiet
seclusion of my pocket, handed it to the
waiter, and proceeded to sip the vivifying
draught. Almost immediately my sallow-faced
attendant returned, bearing with him the piece
of money I had just given him. ?This money
no good, mister?, he said. At a glance I saw
he was right, so I was obliged to call up my
reserves in the form of the ?piece? of five.
My change I quietly placed in my pocket,
together with the bad coin, finished my drink,
and departed.
During my meal, it suddenly occurred to me
that there was a goodly number of bad coins
in circulation, and knowing that I had
received another coin of the value of P.T. 2,
as part of my change, I drew forth both coins
to compare them. They both looked exactly
similar. Both had the fine milled edge, and my
inexperienced eye could detect nothing amiss.
I put them both to the usual test by dropping
them in turn on the floor. Similar sounds !
but ?both without that pleasant ring. Both
were deadheads! Had I received another
spurious coin ? Again I tested both. Alas ! it
was true. I was now in possession of two
?dead? coins, and one solitary ?sound? piastre
formed my wealth. One whole night before
me, and one whole piastre ?not even enough
to buy one packet of cigarettes. I had been
duped jc? and worse than that ?by a Greek.
I finished dinner, and passed from the
restaurant with the words ?Revenge is sweet?
ringing in my ears. What would I do ? How
could I, smarting under this insult ?get my own
back?. Providence (or was it the devil ?) came
to my assistance in the form of a well-kept
?Gharri? and a pair of sleek horsees.
?Want a cab, Sir?, called out the driver.
Should I drag him from his seat for adding
insult to injury, or should I cast aside all
conscientious scruples and avail myself of
this means of soothing my ruffled feelings ?
Everything seemed in order?the gharri, the
restless horses, the splendid night, and ?the
four piastres. For three piastres a half-hour
drive! Bien.
Settled snugly in the cushioned seat, 1 set
out, to all appearances without a single care.
Could anyone guess that I was actually in
possession of one solitary coin, and that to
the value of 2%d.? At the end of my half-hour
drive, we had arrived at a quiet and compara-
tively poorly lighted part of the town. Here I
called a halt, out of justice to the driver paid
my fare? 4 piastres (three for the drive and
one ?bucksheesh?), and, after jovially bidding
?goodnight? to my victim, disappeared into
the gloom of a side street.
Though I found myselfy some considerable
distance from my home with my only friend,
the one piastre-piece, still in my pocket, I was
in a state of mind much more tranquil than
previously. The thought of having ?lawfully??
ridded myself of the bad coins seemed to
give me the energy required to carry me home,
where I rested in solitude and peace with the
whole world, looking forward to the gifts of
the following morning.
Since this experience, I, like the good
Scotchman, look carefully at each coin I
receive, and, moreover, I am anxiously waiting
for the person who dares to attempt to palm
off bad coins on me.
Let it suffice to say, ?Once bitten, twice shy?.
This also may my old friend, the cab-driver,
be thinking at the present moment.

The Finishing Tough.
The following intimation appeared in large
letters upon one of the huts in the Australian
camp at Weymouth.
?Cold feet and malingerers not admitted?
This challenge could not remain unanswered,
so mysteriously the following words were
added:
?Hut full.?
Now things are normal again


O. L.!
The Devil sat and stroked his tail,
And listened to the howl and wail.
?By Eden?s Snake,? he said at last,
?Hell?s business is growing fast.
We haven?t got a grid to spare,
Although on some I?ve packed a pair.
Nine months ago things were so slow
In early let the license go;
But now, the way trade?s pouring in
Great Sulphur! What an awful din !?
Just then the chef dashed through the door
And cast himself upon the floor;
?Great Lord of Flame and Sheol?s Hob,
I must resign?l chuck the job.
You hear those cursing souls without?
Just mark their furious yell and shout,
They?re there in tens of thousands ?more!
Each day arrives a thousand score !
And, though I?ve tried by day and night
To satisfy their appetite
With roast and grill and boiled and ?well,
Most everything we?ve got in Hell,
They growl like dogs, dread lord, and so
Give me my wage and let me go.
No cook could stand the strain for long,
However healthy he and strong,
When endless lines of waiters crowd,
And clamour ceaselessly and loud.
Three times a day but this I hear:
? Hi! Sausage one and lager beer! ?
N.s.W. The Snake,
Once was enough.
A certain regiment relieved another regi-
ment in the trenches a short time ago, and
one man, whose turn it was for sentry,
thinking he had to go over the parapet to do
it said to the corporal.
?How many times? (pointing over) ?do 1
have to go over there ? ?
The corporal told him to follow him, and
told the sentry to look through the loop-hole
to see if he could see a dead German just the
other side of the German trench.
He looked, and said ?Yes.?
?Well,? said.ithe corporal ?he only went
over once!?
Still Uncured.
The C.G. of a certain regiment of regulars
was much troubled about the persistent unti-
diness of one of his men. Reprimand and
punishment were unavailing. The man remained
as dirty as ever.
The a brilliant idea struck the Colonel.
?Why not march him up and down the
whole line of the regiment and so shame him
into decency ??
It was done. The untidy warrior was
ordered to exhibit and march up and down
before the whole regiment.
At the end of the punishment the unabashed
culprit halted, saluted the Colonel, and said in
the hearing of the whole regiment with the
utmost coolness:
?Dirtiest regiment I ever inspected, sir.?
To the women of Australia.
A toast to the splendid daughters
Of the New World over the waters,
A world that is great as new;
Daughters of brave old races,
Daughters of heights and spaces,
Broad seas and broad earth places?
Hail to your land and you.
The sun and the winds have fed you ;
The width of your world has led you
Out into the larger view :
Strong with a strength that is tender,
Bright with a primal splendour,
Homage and praise we render
Hail to your land and you !
Sisters and daughters and mothers,
Standing abreast with your brothers,
Working for things that are true;
Thinking and doing and daring,
Giving, receiving, and sharing,
Earning the crowns you are wearing
Hail to your land and you.
ELLA WHEELER WILCOX.


The SNOW-BLIZZARD.
By ?GUNGA.?
One knows little of the times and the
seasons at which the early Gallipoli winter
plays its pranks. It is fairly gymnastic in its
turns of temperature ; still we never expected
a snow-blizzard in November. For thus
spake the official weather-god (through the
?Peninsula Press?) regarding that fair month :
November generally comes in fine, with a
lovely first ten days or so; it however be-
comes rather sharp at night and there may be
expected a cold snap in the second or third
week of the month; this lasts a few days;
after which the weather gets fine and warm
until the end of the month. November is, in
fact, considered by many to be the most
glorious month of the year.
There has been no talk of snow-blizzards
before the middle of January. It had pro-
mised to be a month to be marked ?with a
white stone.? Instead, it marked itself with
white stones that were many. The halting
Autumn we had chaffed for her vagaries,
except when the touch of bitterness crept
in the wake of the fitful November gales.
And all around me ev?ry bush and tree
Says Autumn?s here and Winter soon will be.
That snows his soft white silence over all.
We had foreseen the snow-drift no nearer
than that. But on the Sabbath morning of the
28th of November we woke to find a Peninsula
of Snow, with snow-men bearing snow-rifles
walking over the snow-ridges. This was the
introduction of most of us to snow. The
nearest we had yet come to the meeting
was at the ? Movies ? which had shown
Cossacks ploughing through their native
drifts for the Front. This was our first touch
with reality in utter cold.
The Australian has a glowing reputation
for adaptability which not even cold can
chill. He moved about like any Esquimo.
This was true literally ; for the first time he
donned his rabbit-skin jacket and his Bala-
clava cap and peaked ?Field-Service.? The
resemblance to an Esquimo. in his bear-
skin coat and hood, was remarkable. His
curiosity worked complementarily to his adapt-
ability. This was like seeing a new country
for the first time. The snow was a new
world ; and no excess of cold was to keep
him from examining and wondering. He
sloshed about the gullies scrutinising the
flakes on his person ; he climbed the ridges
to see something more of the general effect.
The Englishman regarded him from the
stronghold of his snowy tradition with a
superior commiseration ; as who should say :
This?ll make the beggars hop ! The ill-starred
Egyptians, literally and piteously wailed with
the cold. The Australian mostly grinned and
sky-larked.
By eight o?clock he was pasting all passers-
by from his store of ammunition ; and after
breakfast was conducting a sort of trench-
warfare in the gullies, bombing-out the
glowing enemy with a new brand of hand-
grenade, pure-white*
The wind blew a gale, driving the snow
like thick smoke over the turbid Aegean. Like
rain it was not: far too thick and cloudy.
The towering ridges on our east happily saved
us the extreme bitterness of the blast; but it
whistled down our sheltered gullies in a gusty
fashion.
The trenches had another tale to untold.
For them was no grateful ridge-shelter. The
freezing gale cut like a frosty knife across
the parapet, and drove a jet of ice through
the loop-hole, or whistled ruthlessly down
any trench it could enfilade. The stand-to-
arms that morning at 5.30 was an experience
of arctic rigour.
No sun relieved the grey, relentless day.
The men slopped on through the slush. Never
had they conceived anything so cold under-
foot.
But next morning the ground was frozen
hard. Every foot-print was filled with ice.
Where yesterday we had bogged, we pro-
gressed to-day like windmills, with arms
spread to keep a balance on the glossy and
steep-inclining surface. Buckets and pans
were frozen-over. The bristles of shaving-
brushes were congealed into a frozen exten-
sion of the handle. It was a valiant man who,
having pounded them out into a sort of
individuality, ventured to use the razor; the
blade seared like a knife of fire.
The sun shone bravely ; but could not touch
the stubborn ice of the ground. That night


was, to denizens of Australia, incredibly
frosty. There was no breath of air. The cold
bit through four thicknesses of blanket and
lay like a solid encasement of ice about your
limbs beneath the covers. Few men in Turkey
slept two hours that night, and those not
consecutively.
Next morning the slush oozed out to the
sun, and the whole position was as an
Australian cow-yard in the winter-rains. And
that is how the fair month of November made
her adieux to the Peninsula.
Yet it?s an ill blizzard that blows no body
good. Recent storms had played Old Harry
with transport of supplies to Anzac.ln especial,
the water-barge had been cast high and dry
in Irabros. Warfare is not easy in a country
where every pint of water consumed must be
landed under fire. Though summer was past,
men must drink. Salt bacon, salt ?bully? and
dry biscuit are thirst provoking ; and beside
that ?insensible perspiration? of which de
Quincey was wont to make so much, there
was activity on the Anzac Beach, if not
in the trenches; a normal activity inter-
mittently stimulated by the murderous shriek
of shell from flanks.
The reserve supply of water had already
been tapped. For a week we had been on a
quarter-ration. This eked-out at about a half
a mug of tea per man per diem. You ate salt-
beef for the evening meal without tea ; went
to bed thirsty dreaming by the rivers of water ;
woke to a breakfast of salt-bacon unmitigated
by tea; and entered on a burning day
though it was winter ; a day relieved only by
the half-pint at lunch at which you crunched
biscuit and jam. Men were foregoing their
precious nightly issue of rum because it
wrought a pleasant fire in the veins. Not only
were you drought-stricken, but frozen too ; and
that to a degree from which heating-food
would have saved you. But there was no
water for cooking the heating oat meal wait-
ing to be issued ?nor for the heating rice
which could not be boiled in sea-water.
The Blizzard came in the midst of this
drought and changed all that. Rum-jars,
buckets, biscuit-tins, water-cans yea, the
very jam tins were filled with snow, and
there was the precious potential water.
Parched-and-frozen throats were slaked, be-
ards shaven, porridge boiled, and bacon and
beef defied to do their worst. Removed from
the fire, it had a dusty smack. But it was
water.
Valvis Bay.
The sea before. The dunes behind.
A drearier place you?ll never find.
Unless maybe its in your mind,
To emulate that Yankee soul
To find like him another pole
In arctic zone.
For here no beach attracts the sight.
Nor pier wheron to pass the night,
In cheering some girls lonely plight
With tales of how we slew the Hun.
(In this we fairly take the bun)
Or did of yore.
Passes the week with Sunday?s mist
And Mondays, also Tuesdays mist.
Wednesday and Thursday also mist.
Our diary would be thus quite full ;
But lest it should be somewhat dull,
There comes the wind.
Now up this coast in olden days
Well so at least the Skipper says.
One never heard those gentle lays,
Of sailors piping for a breeze.
With sails close reefed mid souls unease,
They stood to sea.
So reigns the wind now lord of all.
Its very raging doth appal.
That often pray we it may fall.
But when it does and from our eye
We clear the sand; again we spy
The falling mist.
The sun is either blown away.
Or mists do hide its cheery way.
At least it never shines our way.
But perhaps the Kaiser just for fun
Sent ultimatums to the Sun
And put her out.
Yet if it?s true as says the sage ;
That all the world is but a stage ;
And we but actors in each age.
Then mark our sojourn on this shore.
Barren and bleak as Hell?s back door .
A lapse. Two years.

New Zealand Records Section.
Current Topics.
Since the publication of our last issue, we
have been unfortunate enough to lose the
services of Staff Sergeant Norton who has
been obliged to lay down the editorial pen for
this section. The loss is undoubtedly ours,
for our late editor, through his literary
experience and aptitude for such work, has
done much to forward the success of our
numbers. In consequence, I must take the
liberty of asking readers to overlook the initial
efforts of his successor, whose knowledge of
such matters is very limited. We feel indebted
to Staff Sergeant Norton for his efforts on
our behalf, and one and all we extend to him
our very best wishes for further success in his
new sphere of duty.
Much concern was felt among several
members of the staff a few nights ago, when
the sky suddenly opened its exhaust pipe, and
vented its wrath on our happy homes ?by the
sea?. Even the wild waves were roused, and
were clearing the surrounding wall to add to
the discomfort of the residents of this fragrant
flat. Like good soldiers all members of the
camp sprang to arms, to protect their homes ;
but, alas 1 the suprise attack proved too strong
and a city of ruined tents greeted the eyes of
passers-by the following morning. Who
would not enjoy the life of a soldier ?
It is with much disappointment that I read
the announcement the other day to the effect
that the Kaiser, his son, and body-guard have
postponed indefinitely? their long-proposed
visit to Egypt. In all probability (for all we
can do is suppose) ?His All Highest Majesty?
considers it advisable to accede to ?Little
Willie?s? wish for postponement on account
of the fast-closing Cairo tourist season, on
account of the difficulty, since this wideworld
war began, of obtaining passports, and in
consequence of the movements of strangers
being under close surveillance of the English
military authorities in Egypt, his methods of
last living and late hours will be severely
curtailed. Moreover, his great dislike for
Colonials, especially New Zealanders and
Australians, a great many of whom are
?spending? the season here, seems to have
done much to influence the change in his
holiday-planning. He informs us privately
that this year, he will not include Egypt in
his tour, and wishes to make known through
the medium of our social announcement
column, that his next stop will be made at
his country residence in St Helena, where he
will be ?at home?? co callers.
In troublesome times such as these, the
receptive qualities of man?s mind are roused
to a state of activity much more pronounced
than usual. We eagerly await news that are
not forthcoming, and consequently seek consol-
ation from any available source. Wherein
lies the means of obtaining this comfort but
in the wild clutching at floating straws of
rumour, that happen to pass our way? Pent-up
feelings must be released, opinions must be
made known. Thus are we besieged with
those indifferent expressions of opinion, better
known to us as ?rumours?. They are many
and varied, comforting and disheartening,
practicable and otherwise; yet we digest them
analyse them, compare them, spread them,
but never reject and scorn them. Why ?

Ignominy.
Night is dispelled by day, but the ignominy
of the tribe of Tamin will never be dispelled.
If they saw a flea riding on a louse and
galloping down to charge their line of battle
they would turn their backs and run away.

Irish Wit.
An Irish Sergeant of a well known Australian
Regiment camped at Mena, whilst in charge
of a Quarter Guard of twelve men, was asked
by Grand Rounds to account for the whole of
his men being absent, He quickly replied to
the officer : Four on sir, four going on, and
four coming off.
The officer left apparently satisfied.


SPORTING COLUMN.
Stray Shots.
Our newly-appointed editor, has decided
that a paper run by compatriots of such men
as Dick Arnst, Bob Fitzsimmons the All
Blacks, and the late Anthony Wilding, to
mention a few of Maoriland?s famous sports-
men, is not complete without a small space
devoted to the interests of sport; and for
reasons best known to himself, his choice has
fallen on me to provide the necessary copy
for that space. And having (to use a milita-
rism), been detailed for duty with the Sports
Column, I turn naturally to our football
players ; but it has occurred to me that outside
our immediate circle, their doings may not be
of great interest. One can hardly imagine
the High Commissioner in London, or one?s
nearest and dearest in New Zealand (and of
course she always gets a copy): I say one
can hardly imagine any of them showing an
absorbing interest in the fact that Sergt Bowie,
with the ball at toe, pirouetted in front of the
enemy?s goal with the grace and skill of Maud
Allan (but failed to shoot at the critical
moment); that Lovell with the hardihood and
determination characteristic of a New Zealan-
der, led many (?) assaults against the enemy?s
outer works; that the �biquitous Holmes
displayed all his oldtime daring and finesse;
or that Haseltine suddenly awakening from
a state of semi-coma scored a brilliant goal ?
for the other side Certainly this paper
should record our doings, and as far as our
sporting doings are concerned it shall, but I
think that I may be permitted to introduce
other subjects of a like nature, which may
prove of general interest to all our readers.
Rugby Football will not thrive in Egypt,
partly through lack of grounds, and partly
through climatic conditions; but the English-
man who introduced a winter game was wise
in making it ?"Soccer?. A scrum in which the
opposition was composed of steaming and
perspiring Abduls and Mahomeds would
probably have proved too much ever for the
redoutable ?All Blacks?. And so we have
had to discard our own game and take to
association code, and since their re-organisa-
tion, the ?All Greens? have now played six
games, winning four and drawing two, a
record of which they are justly proud.
On the afternoon of the 7th an event of
more than passing interest took place at
Nouzah, when a team representing the New
Zealand Army Post Office tried conclusions
wfith a side drawn from the South African
regiments at present stationed here. Knowing
the capabilities of our own team and their
condition ?or rather their lack thereof ?one
did not naturally expect to see them make a
great showing, but the most pessimistic of
barrackers could hardly have anticipated such
an overwhelming defeat for the New Zealand-
ers. New Zealand has a high reputation in
the rugby football world, and in order to
save that, and also to spare the feelings of
the players, I will refrain from mentioning
the final tally. Let it suffice to say that it
would not have been a bad cricket score on a
wet wicket. It is perhaps unfair to criticise
any team after such a game ; but the excuse
is that the South Africans inspire such an
interest in a Rugby ?follower?, and especially
a New Zealander, that one can scarcely refrain
from comparing their play with what one is
accustomed to see in N. Z. Their back play
is modelled entirely on the English style, and
the most apparent defect in the othewirse good
attack is the entire absence of what we know
as "?cutting in?, and the tries obtained by their
backs would never have been scored against
a N. Z. team whose rearguard knew the rudi-
ments of defence. Like English teams we
have seen ?down under?, the main object
seemed to be to get the ball to the wing-three
quarter, and then depend on his pace to run
round the opposition. This is an excellent
plan to follow when there is weak opposition ;
but against a strong defensive side, it is a
practice which will not result in many points.
The backs were a very speedy combination,
and, so the writer is quite ready to believe,
included in their number more than one player
who has earned international honours. Even
allowing for the weakness of the opposition,
and the defect already mentioned, their work
was of a very finished order. The forwards
were very heavy, with plenty of pace, and
with the idea of ?using their head?, a quality
not always found in the average Rugby
forward.


The best that can be said of the New Zea-
landers is that they stuck gamely to a hopeless
task and took their beating in the best of
spirit. The great pity is that we cannot get
a really good New Zealand team up here to
play them, for the resulting game would be
well worth watching. Unfortunately for foot-
ball in N. Z., a South African team has never
been seen there ; but let us hope that after the
war, such an event will happen, and one may
safely predict some very stirring contests, in
which the wearers of the silver fern-leaf will
not have things all their own way.

at Alexandria,
Friday.
Sir,
It is with feelings of the greatest regret that
we are compelled to cancel our Rugby Match
with your team arranged for to-morrow, as we
have been suddenly ordered to England.
Notwithstanding the prospect of going
home, the Officers and men of the ship desire
me to convey to all of you their dissappoint-
ment at not being able to fulfil the engagement
and as we leave to night for England, we
desire to extend our heartiest wishes to our
gallant Colonial friends for every happiness,
success and a safe return home.
On behalf of the Officers and men of
H.M.S. ?Magnificent.?
The Hon. Secretary ,
N.Z. Rugby Club.

Recently there appeared in a London news-
paper an advertisement for an experienced
insurance clerk, wages 15/- per week. The
advertiser got a lot of sarcastic letters like
the following, and no doubt he deserved them :
Dear Sir, I would respectfully apply for the
position you offer. I am an expert in insurance
in all its branches. In addition, I converse
fluently in Gum Arabic, Gorgonzola, Zola, and
Billingsgate. I write shorthand, longhand,
left hand and right hand. I can supply my
own typewriter if necessary, and I may
mention that I typewrite half an hour in ten
minutes ?the record for Great Britain. 1 would
be willing also to let you have the services,
gratis, of my large family of boys, and if
agreeable to you my wife would be pleased
to clean your office regularly without extra
charge. The cost of postage for your answer
to this application can be deducted from my
salary. Please note that if you have a back-
yard I would make bricks in my spare time.
Desert.
Searching about with care-dimmed eyes
For water, that is not there,
Stumbling on neath the burning skies
With a haggard and troubled stare,
On past the ruins that tell of fame,
But now desolate and dead,
On in the search of a drop to drink
While the sky burns overhead.
Burning and hot the desert sands
Fly out on the searching wind,
Making a hell man understands
Which he finds not very kind;
Life is the thought that goads him on
That fills his heart with fear,
And makes him battle across the sands
'Gainst death that?s creeping near.
Staggering over the desert white
To the land of God knows where,
Plunging on in the blinding light
To the thought of ?I don?t care?:
On past the aged bleached bones of man
That strew the caravan?s path,
On to the land of the greater beyond
That holds God?s aftermath.

The Universal Cry of Egypt.
In my time I have seen some very distressing
things and some very evil sights and some
awful places. And then I?ve seen Egypt ?the
mysterious inscrutable Egypt. And it doesn?t
make me forget the other things.
The universal call of Egypt is ?Ss-s-s-t?.
It?s like the hiss of an angry snake. I don?t
know if you?ve ever heard an angry snake,
nor do I know how to spell it?s battle cry ; but
if you press the apex of your tongue hard
behind your front top teeth, arch the tongue
till it touches the palate and make hunting
noises like long-drawn-out Capital ?S?s, you?ll
get somewhere near the mark.
If, at a restaurant you want attention, it is
sheer waste of time to yell ?Waiter? : you may
even shriek ?Gargon? till you are black in the
face, but you?ll get no response or salt or pep-
per or whatever else it is you want. Keep calm
and unruffled, murmer a pregnant ?Ss-s-s-t?
and ?Hey Presto! the waiter will ?Spring to
it?. If you want a gharry, no need to strain
your larynx with unholy ?Hi !?s. A simple
?Ss-s-s-t? will do the trick in half the time.
Its the same with everything. The cry is
universal -r it is sinister and strangely in
keeping with the everlasting occidental
intrigue which by-the-way is also universal ?
not only in Egypt but throughout the Orient,
If you walk along the small by-streets at
night you may be brought up sharply and
vaguely-disquieted with a half-heard Ss-s-s-t?.
If its tones are low and the sound prolonged
you may be sure it is a warning?possibly a
picquet; If sharp and pitched in a higher key
?most probably a signal or a threat. A
muffled scream follows, then a stealthy
shuffling of bare feet, a faint sickly odour and
silence ?silence so vindictively oppresive as
to be almost felt. It is disconcerting and
confoundedly baffling. But best not investi-
gate ?it?s Egypt. ?Ss-s-s-t? at a street corner
and you may see a trembling hand clutch
tighter the veil that hides all but eyes ?bright
black staring eyes full of a world of tragedy.
And it is not only in the street and cafes
that the cry is heard. In the Palatial Hotels,
behind luxurious palms with deftly shaded
lights, hansdomeiy-gowned and highly-cultu-
red women who speak fluently half a dozen
European languages may be heard to ejaculate
the damnable ?Ss-s-s-t?. May be to attract a
personal friend or acquaintance ; or perchance
a warning to a sister spy ! Quien Sabe ! The
damn thing gets hold of you. You find yourself,
instead of giving a good honest Australian
?Coo-ee?, unconsciously imitating a loathsome
reptile that shums the light.
This just one of the many factors that go to
make Egypt the baffling, puzzling place it is,
and shrouds it in a mantle of mysticism. It
is the outward symbol of the inner working
of the Oriental mind. It is inconceivable to
imagine an Egyptian Native doing anything
direct ?taking the line of least
realizing that the shortest distance between
two points is a straight line. He works and
works all the time in circles, in semi-circles,
in elliptics parabolas and rhomboids.
At the Pyramids I visited the tomb of
Rameses and was by an old Bedouin
?Oh so very very old, grey-bearded, toothless
and well nigh blind ?black-gowned and white-
turbaned, to let him forecast my future. But
even he?poor doddering old wreck was not
free from the malign intrigue ?he had to part
up bucksheesh to the, guide. The subsequent
proceedings were certainly impressive and
interesting?and if the blithering old humbug
hadn?t added as a final injunction that it was
"Square dinkum? I might have been tempted
to credit him with some occult knowledge.
As it was I felt that the resting place of old
Rameses had been violated by a Charlatan,
At Mena I went for a camel ride. Even the
camel boys were under the intrigue influence
and there wasffluch corroborence as to whether
Hamed?s or Abdul?s camels were to be honou-
red. Camel/riding is not exactly joy-riding.
Once in India I had a camel ride but that
was on a racing camel ?a long-legged thing
that made you feel dizzy to look down from.
These poor Egyptian brutes are not at all
fearsome things but they too are under the
ban of intrigue and will lie down when least
expected and refuse to budge until a satisfac-
tory arrangement in regard to extra bucksheesh
has been arrived at.
I had my photograph taken on camehback
near the pyramids and the ugly squat face
of the Sphynx grinned its sickly everlasting
grin. Happy thought though?the beggar


could?nt ?Ss-s-s-t? because Napoleon?s guns
thoughtfully knocked out its front teeth some
years back. I think the photographer, the
guide, the sphynx and the Devil all intrigued
to get my confounded steed to wander in the
direction it did. If, by any chance, you ever
see that photograph take special note of the
sardonic grin on the camehs face and the
contemptuous spread of its near legs.
I havn?t got dyspepsia or indigestion. Pm
not even ?fed up?. The sun is shining; the
skies are blue; the Mediterranean is a perfect
azure and what foliage there is, is luxurious
and vividly green. I don?t feel miserable and
I don?t care twopence what happens. I don?t
regret coming here and I shan?t regret going
away. But I should like a few dear old pals
from the Antipodes that I wot of to come and
visit me. We could study French and Arabic
and get our boots cleaned. Alexandria is full
of boot-blacks. They come to the cafes and
polish your boots while you eat: at the theatre
they bring their paraphernalia to the front
stalls or the boxes or the pit or the gallery
and polish your boots to the tune ofjj Tchai-
kowski?s Symphony or ?Tipperary?; if you
visit a shop to make a few purchases a boot
black is ever ready to grab an unwary heel
and polish it willy nilly while you buy ; your
barber?s assistant will dust your toe caps while
you are being shaved ; and even a quiet drink
in peace is impossible for the �biquitous boot
black lies alurking to polish your boots while
you drink. The boot-black is as universal as
the ?Ss-s-s-t?. I dont know whether he
occupies a special pew in church ?I havn?t
been there yet; but when I do, I shan?t be at
all surprised to find one prizing off my spurs
during the doxology, and I?m morally certain
the first and second lessons will be read and
the sermon preached to the accompaniment
of a chorus of ?Ss-s-s-t?s and ?boo-oots? from
every entrance and exit.

Sing Me To Sleep.
Sing me to sleep, where bullets fall,
Let me forget the W r orld and all;
Damp is my dug-out, cold is my feet,
Nothing but biscuits and bully to eat.
Sing me to sleep, where bombs explore,
And shrapnel shells are in galore.
Over the sand-bags fezzes you'll find,
Dead men in front, and dead men behind ?
Far from Gallipoli?d long to be
Where Turkish snipers can?t pot at me.
Think of me crouching where worms creep,
Waiting for someone toSing Me To Sleep.
Gallipoli, Deer sth /16.
Sing me to sleep, in some old shed,
The rats are running round overhead.
Stretched out here on my waterproof,
Dodging the rain drops from the roof.
Sing me to sleep where camp fires glow,
With plenty of coffee and bread, Oh No ;
Dreaming of home and nights in the West ?
With somebody?s old sea boots on my chest.
Far from the Star's light, I long to be,
Sights of New Zealand I?d rather see.
Think of me crouching where lizards creep,
Waiting for ?Jacko? to put me to sleep.
?Chips?
Ismailia, Egypt,
Jan. 18th /16.
Hour after hour the cards were fairly shuffled,
And fairly dealt; yet still I got no hand.
I rose from play, and with a mind unruffled,
Only I said ?1 do not understand?.
Life is a game of Whist, from unseen sources,
The cards are shuffled and the hands are
Blind are our efforts to control the forces, [dealt.
Which, though unseen, are no less
strongly felt.
I do not like the way the cards are shuffled,
But yet Fm in the game and bound to stay.
And through the long, long night will I,
unruffled,
Play what I get, until the break of day.
Gallipoli, 1/12/15.

The Admonition.
Remember, on your knees,
The men who guard your slumbers?
And guard a house in a still street
Of drifting leaves and drifting feet,
A deep blue window where below
Lies moonlight on the roofs like snow,
A clock that still his quarters tells
To the dove that roosts beneath the bell's
Grave canopy of silent brass,
Round which the little night-winds pass
Yet stir it not in the grey steeple ;
And guard all small and drowsy people
Whom gentlest dusk doth disattire,
Undressing by the nursery fire
In unperturbed numbers
On this side of the seas ?
Remember, on your knees,
The men who guard your slumbers.

her !

SATAN said the Almighty,
?I wish for a subtle snare wherein to entrap
men?;
God showed him silver and gold and horses ;
Satan said, ?Yes, these are good,? but did
not seem satisfied.
Then God showed him mines full of jewels,
but he said, ?Give me more, O Generous One?.
Then He showed him costly cloths and silks
and wines ; but he said, ?I require more than
these, for men can break these chains?. Then
He showed him the beauty of women, which
deprives men of reason and self-control.
Satan began to dance with joy and said,
?Give me that! now I shall succeed ! ?

Dinkum Oil.
A Word to the Unwary.
My friends of the Australian and New
Zealand Records Sections : As Dame Rumour
is once again on the warpath in and around
the precincts of our sacred edifice, I feel that
the time is opportune for a word with you on
the subject of Dinkum Oil. As one who has
drunk deeply of the dregs of humiliation
through too great a faith in the charitabless of
human nature, I consider that I am in a
position to discourse at length on this subject.
Unfortunately the Editor of the A.R.G. is not
of a very sympathetic nature and will not
grant the space for a lengthy article on
Dinkum Oil in this issue but, hearing of my
unfortunate experience, he realizes the neces-
sity for a few remarks and has permitted me
to issue a warning for the time being. Dame
Rumour is a fickle jade and as our past
experiences have proved, cannot be relied
upon, therefore my friends, whenever an
acquaintance greets you with that too well
known remark ?What?s the oil? ?avoid him,
lest your honour and fair name be trampled
in the dust. THE DINKUM OIL KING.
