Editorial Remarks.
In the old old days, when metal in the form
* of piastres was unknown, and when even
a tin kettle was a vague aspiration impossible
of realisation, there lived a man who decided
that his function in life was to be an EDITOR.
So much, in the old Stone Age, was he
obsessed with his idea, that he wrote a Circular
(on a stone tablet?perhaps in that Ogham
which is claimed to be kin to the ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphics, which we all know
so well but don?t understand) to all his friends
and potential enemies (after all people were
much the same then as now) and this was
what he wrote, or rather hewed out of the
native diorite, biotite, horneblende, or
whatever kind of rock was ?native?? in his
part of the world
?I am starting a paper. It is to be called
the ?Stone Age Records Gazette?. Contribute
at once.?


Now it happened that the self-constituted
EDITOR was a man of brawny personality,
so every woaded individual (you notice that
we include the lady literary aspirants as well,
though centuries rolled on over the edge of
the world before Elinor Glyn raised hopes in
the ancient female bosom, or Victoria Cross
desires in the immature) ?every woaded
individual, we say, hewed and hewed and
hewed at his or her piece of native rock until an
article or poem of some sort had taken shape.
Then they hesitated, because, well
because of the EDITOR'S brawny personality,
no doubt.
Eventually the EDITOR became a little bit
nervous about the prospects of his Gazette ?
not physically nervous, of course, but mentally
so, his body, you see was relatively far
greater than his mind ?and he sent out a
message to all contributors to furnish matter
without delay.
Which they duly did.
And then he took a few days off work
(N.B. He kept the Records of cases of
dissatisfaction between self-constituted
husbands and unwilling wives, and if we can
believe historical fragments which have come
to hand, all wives were unwillingly so in
those days ?not like Modern Egypt where
even a temporary -?) then, as we said
before, he took a few days off work, and
studied the contributions he had received.
And after that he made a great resolve.
He sent for all contributors one by one, and
at each one he hurled his or her contribution
with a sure and steady aim.
That, in spite of historical records (so-called)
is the reason why there is no real Ancient
Briton alive at the present time, except that
EDITOR?S descendants.

ROLLO.
The World and I Got Drunk.
I smiled upon the wide world,
Towards the bar I slunk.
And then ?or some time after
The world and I got drunk !
Oh, gay was life and brimming ;
Well wined and fed and girled;
And jollily my good friend,
The green old earthball, whirled.
And all things, gaily blithered,
Went staggering around;
Where'er I trod I marched on
Inebriated ground.
The trams had all a stagger,
They leaped right cheerily ;
And as I tried to board one
It jumped away from me.
Still that was but good humor
And done in merry play;
Am I a man to censure
A tram for going gay ?
The lamps and posts kept dancing
And twisted in strange bends ;
Sometimes I held them steady
For they and I seemed friends.
1 he buildings joined in with me
(Some very nearly fell),
And in my glad good-friendship
I rang them by the bell.
And staid and stolid persons
Seemed on the jag a-roam,
I linked my arm with many
And told them to go home.
For even when I?m mellow
?Tis somehow sad to me
To see a grey-beard lose his
Respectability.
A parson grey but gladsome,
Came flickering to view ;
?What ho ! my gay sky-pilot I
What, are you shickered too ?"
He staggered backward from me,
I saw he scarce could stand;
He was so blindly joyful
He could not see my hand.
With firm but quiet insistence
I took him on my way,
For in his ripe condition
I could not let him stay.
We met with merry sailors
And citizens full ripe ;
With beer and wine and whisky
And cigarette and pipe ;
And music it was flowing ;
And laughter it ran free,
When we got drunk together,
The whole darned world and me i
The stars were in the revel,
They danced and spun and gleamed,
The very clouds above us
Of beery fulness seemed.
But how the gay night finished,
Or where I chanced to go
To bed I can't remember,
And do not want to know.


Within my vague remembrance
The last that I could see,
Were laughter lighted faces,
On every side of me;
Policemen, clowns and sailors,
Swells, writers, men who paint,
Grey-bearded men and beardless,
Five parsons and a saint !

{From the Sydney ?Bulletin.?)
Tommy, when you read this
for goodness sake don't say
?The impudence of the rising
?generation is
9/11/15.
Now, old chap dont turn to the end of this
epistle to see whose signature is there, and
don?t look at the address and say to yourself
?Tm blest if I know anyone in? but read on,
0 Theophilus, and find out that I?m quite a
respectable person living in a respectable
house in a re street in the re township
of the aforesaid (save the mark 1) and am not
dwelling in that beauteous abode up the line
dubbed Mental Hospital. I suppose you?ll
think I ought to though. Well having started,
I?ll tell you how it comes about that you are
reading a letter from a girl you have never
seen or whom you are never likely to see, who
is at this moment defying Mrs. Grundy rather
flagrantly .About three months ago, I was
wading through the ?Star? for war-news, I came
across a paragraph that made me think, and
then hesitate; and ye ken, ?she who hesitates
is lost,? so I guess I?m lost now. The paragraph
was one taken from one of Lieutenant L
to his father, saying something to to the effect
that many of the Tommies never get the
?Scrape of a pen? from home, and so get
rather blue; and that if anyone would like to
send a letter to a lonely soldier, and to address
it to him, he would see that one disappointed
chap is made happy. Well, I don?t know
about the happy part of it, but I think you will
see now why I am writing.
I hope you are not unduly shocked, at least
1 am when I stop to think, but such a continued
strain on my brain might prove fatal don?t
cher kna-ow. But, I sez, sez I, if it is in my
power to see that disappointed chap is happy,
not all the Mrs. Grundys in the universe are
going to stop me. I?m long enough in coming
to the point, am I not. Well, Tommy, if you
have read this far and are still in command of
your nerves and brain, (this is as bad as a
bombardment, is?nt it ?) I?ll beg of you to put
yourself in the most obliging and good
tempered mood, and then I can get away : I
guess you are?n?t in an angelic mood after that,
now, but I?ll pretend you are. I?m in possession
of a most angelic temper myself, as witness
the night when Dad wouldn?t let me go to the
vaudeville with Bob (my brother, a cheeky
conceited little ass of 15) (sisterly love, what
ho !) Well I humped it off to bed at about
8 o?clock ; I kicked one of my shoes
into the fire place and knocked over the
silly shovel and tongs and they fell with
such a row into the fender, then I missed the
window pane with my brush, which fell with
a bully splash into the water-jug, and after
that exhibition, I accidentally on purpose
knocked over a little stool, which in its turn
tipped over my little table with photo frames
on it. Then I flopped into bed, and of course,
the blessed mattress collapsed, and I was
tipped in an inelegant bundle to the floor. I
had moved the mattress when I was making
m'y bed, and was too lazy to fix it, intending
to slide into bed that night as gently as a lion.
That?s usually the strength of my gentleness.
Dad ventured to knock at the door, which
mercifully I had locked, and enquire what the
noise was, where upon I, with what I supposed
to believe, disarming tranquility, informed
him that I was taking a course of physical
culture.
After which I suppose you?ll think I?m a tile
loose; hope you do?nt for I?ll have to disillusion
you. Before you go any further, let me inform
you (this is my best parliamentary manner)
that lam 16, going on for 17 next January (I
feel as old as anything, I guess in a few more
years they?ll forget when I was born, and
have to yank my mouth open and count my
teeth, like the horses) and I?m the oldest of 6;
and Dad is a widower, Mum died last
November; and I?m looking after Dad and
five kids, aged 15, 10, 7, 5, 3, and incidentally,
myself. Of course, Dad looks after me, oh,
certainly of course ; but I?m of the opinion that
he looks after me, not wisely but too well; he
won?t let me do this or that, and if he knew
1 was writing to a man whom I had never
seen, or whose name I don?t know, he?d take
a fit, in fact several fits. Hence the address,
Tommy. My best and one and only chum is
writing too, She is a decent sport on whom I
can air my views without being thought a


socialist, you see she is thoroughly seasoned
to me. And her Mother is so decent. We
told her about this, she said there was nothing
bad in it, and said I could get my letter
addressed there. If I suggested such a thing
to my Dad, he would slay me, but I khow
that if Mother knew she would not mind.
She knew me; Dad does?n?t. Mum knew I
wasn?t a silly sentimental love-sick idiot, but
Dad thinks I am, and consequently has drawn
his reins tighter round me. Do you know I
hate being a girl. I guess its no fun at all.
Can you imagine yourself in a skirt, and a
fancy hat jammed over your e} r es, and a pair
of gloves on your hands ? That?s how it feels
being a girl. Rotten. And skirts, simply
awful. They flap round your knees and ankles
and you can?t run ; of course girls were not
made to run. Simply made to sit still all through
the service and people looking at her all the
time. Do you know what I?d do if I was up
there ? I?d start with the back seat, and wink
at every person, old and young, masculine or
feline, who was looking at me. They?d get a
shock; but thank goodness Frn not up there,
as I possess a voice resembling a fog-horn, so
Bob says, but his sayings are always to be
taken ?cum grano salis? as we used to say at
the old Normal. I went there for two years
after I had passed my Proficiency and junior
free place exams, and do ye ken, since ever
after I had passed that has always been a
source of mystery to me. I know as much as
a hen, possessing its brains, so Bob says (to
be taken ?cum grano salis?). That sounds
like something on a menu does?n?t it. I wonder
if I have drivelled enough to suit your august
majesty?s taste. I?d better sheer of from
myself and put some questions. I?d better
number them. (l) What?s your name ? (2) Do
you come from N.Z. (3) If so, what part of it.
(4) How old are you ? (5) What are you like ?
(6) Enumerate all your charms ? (7) Have you
any brothers and sisters ? (I have I sister and
4 brothers) (8) Are you in possession of one
of those most ornamental, though useless
articles, ?a sweetheart. (9) If so, what?s she
like ? (TO) Is she nice ? (ll) Where does she
live ? What time do you sound reveille, or do
you shoot all night ? (13) What is your number,
your company, your regiment? (14) How do
you like War? (15) Have you ever had any
stirring adventures ? (16) if so state them ?
(17) Have you been wounded yet? (18) How
did it feel? (19) How many Turks have you
shot ? (20) Are you a good shot ? (21) How
many round of ammunition do you use daily ?
(22) How do you like bayoneting Turks ? (Gee
it must feel rather exciting, (23) Were you at
the landing at Gabatepe on April 25th ? (24)
What was it like ?
I say, the above sounds like an exam paper.
If you don?t answer all the above questions
I?ll scrag you. Fm quite experienced in
that, having practised on Bob. Can you box ?
Bob brought home two pairs of Boxing
Gloves and he and I have high old times.
Tommy if you don?t like to write me pourself,
or if you are too serious minded to write to a
silly young ass like yours truly, will you tell
some of your mates to. And tell them I?ll be
in the seventh heaven of delight if any of
them will write and give me explicit directions
about what you are all doing. Really. And
ril send you some papers etc. I nearly forgot.
Are you supplied with cigarettes ? Reminds
me of the time when I first smoked a cigarette.
Bob got some, and we sat on my bed while I
made the first experiment. Dad was planting
in the garden, so we were safe. I was half
scared to try, but at last I put it in my mouth
and took a long breath. As long as I live, I?ll
never forget that. I could?nt get the smoke
out of my lungs, and I coughed and spluttered
and swore (don?t be shocked, I often do it, when
Dad is?n?t near) and Bob was laughing at me.
I bombarded him with pillows, and he flew.
I have never done it since. Well I suppose
you will get this about Xmas. I?ll wish you
an exceeding happy Xmas and New Year,
which is rather incongruous, but I?ll wish it all
the same. Goodbye. Be sure to write. I won?t
sign myself your pal until you say I may be.
Better tell you that my name is known to Bob
as ILD. which I grieve to say, stands for Ugly
Duckling. lam Ugly. Really I seem to revel
in it, don?t I.
Well, this is enough, if you have survived
this epistle. I?ll have to start another chapter
?The First Epistle to Thomas Atkins.? How?s
that Umpire. Carry my best wishes to your
Chums. May your shadow never grow less.
May you live long and die happy, and all the
rest of that bally rot; but I hope you?ll ?do for?
as many Germans as you can. I?m rather blood-
thirsty am I not, I wish I were out there beside
you, but, I think that I wouldn?t shoot straight,
when I can?t hit a cocoa tin lid at 50 yds. with
Bob?s air-rifle. Never mind I?m improving, as
Aunt Bess says, I?m improving. Seems to me
I started to say goodbye a minute ago. Well
I?ll finish now.


Do write. Goodbye. Best wishes etc.

Zealand girl to a ?lonely Soldier.?

The ?Front Rank.?
Something is said about the weeding-out
of ?undesirables??drunks and gamblers, and
soldiers who howl at night, and fellows who
haunt the back streets of Cairo during the
dark hours and wink at Egyptian girls?from
the Australian forces in Egypt. These dubious
characters, it is alleged, are to be sent back
to Australia in disgrace, so that they may
marry undesirably, and rear undesirable
families, while the good men go to the front,
and do battle with the Turk, and are shot by
Abdul Fez. This idea that the worst citizen
should be carefully preserved from destruc-
tion, and get a free passage home to the place
where he used to be a nuisance, and become
one of the fathers of the community, and help
to make our laws, and even go into Parlia-
ment, while the best citizen is killed, looks
like an absurdity. Every undesirable who is
already in the force should be carefully pre-
served. Every criminal, hunchback, forger or
other bad character who seeks to enlist should
be enlisted with enthusiasm. The drunkard
should be taken on the evidence of his breath
and his nose. The worst scoundrels should
have extra pay, if necessary; and extra
special uniforms, and on the day of battle
they should go the first, being the folk who
can best be spared. They would certainly
kill somebody before they died. The front
ranks should include the most quarrelsome
drunk, the most chronic beer-chewer, the
worst poet, the hardened loafer, the publican
who adulterates his liquor, the counter-luncher,
the inveterate assault-and-battery person, Bill
Sikes, Butler, Deeming, all the discoverable
bushrangers, all the available pirates, the
man with the largest number of convictions,
the constant murderer, the religious maniac,
the sexual pervert, Oscar Wilde, the deviser
of indecent postcards, the Hunchback of
Notre Dame, the Outlaw of Iceland and Jack
the Ripper. And when they had done their
bit of trouble with the enemy the reputable
citizens who come behind would have an
easier row to hoe.
(From the Sydney ?Bulletin.?)
A few days ago two pleasant ceremonies
took place in the quarters of the Australian
Records Section.
Like Nelson, we have our blind eyes, and
so have Major C. T. Griffiths and Lieut.
H. S. G. Hall. For were it not otherwise,
would not King?s Regulations para. 443 have
proved an insurmountable obstacle ?
Anyhow a framed photograph of the mem-
bers of the Australian Records Section was
presented to Major Griffiths by the Section,
and another to Lieut. Hall by the original
members of the Section.
Both replied in a manner which left no
doubt as to their appreciation and as to the
desirability of (sometimes) having a blind
eye in reading King?s Regulations. Lieut.
Hall?s acknowledgment was given with a
considerable and greatly appreciated emotion.
If any General happens to read this with
his seeing eye we hope he will manage to
read K.R?s with his blind.


?A Little Knowledge... ?
Great uproar at the 2 me Chasseurs d?Afrique
barracks.
Since Reveille, for once unaccompanied by
profane outbursts from sleepy troopers, the
squares and rooms had been like a feverish
beehive.
Above the gates, under a sky fired by the
rising sun, a brand new flag flapped merrily
in the morning breeze, and the 2 big date
palms on each side, waved in unison, not
unlike two marabouts greeting the dawn.
It was the Regiment?s Day, the anniversary
of the glorious Crimean episode, the charge
of Balaclava.
The yards were packed with transport
waggons, full of greenery, flags and bunting.
Carts emptied loads of meat and piles of
vegetables at the cook-houses, where one
caught a glimpse of the busy cooks?fuliginous
silhouettes.
In the dormitories, improvised workshops
turned out unending multicoloured paper-
wreaths, palm and foliage plaits, while others
furbished up swords, carbines and curbs to
be used for trophies. Artists (?) hung the bed-
blankets in festoons and curtains and traced on
placards high-class drawings and triumphant
inscriptions, furiously glorifying the Home-
land, the 2nd Chass? d?Af, Balaclava veterans
and other worthy subjects.
But the riding-school was the thing for
chaotic order, for it was destined to shelter
the Sardanapalian and Bacchanalian orgies,
which would close the Day, the great tuck-in,
in which the men would nobly endeavour to
break through the broad crimson waist-sashes,
issued by a generous Government. In an atmo-
sphere of saw(and other)-dust, men, perspiring
and bare-breasted, dressed ?by the centre?
long rows of tables, piled up columns of
plates, masked the nudity of the walls under
chaste trophies of flags and lanterns. No
slackers there, everybody swore, sweated,
scraped, hustled and bustled : the ?furia fran-
cese,? for which the colonial cavalry is justly
noted, in all its pristine and prismatic beauty.
It gave one the fallacious impression it?s as
hard to celebrate as to win a victory.
Suddenly, a blare of trumpets. All work
ceased and the men, for a change of fun (?),
galloped to the halls, to unctuously listen to
a lecture on the battle of Balaclava : an idea,
emanating from the Colonel, who, wishing to
?migere utile dulci,? had decided that each
squadron would be inflicted with a recital of
this brilliant day in the military annals of
England and France.
The Captain of the 6th squadron, feeling
hoarse, had given the job to his lieutenants,
who, doubting their speechifying capacity,
had entrusted their N.C.O.?s with it, who, in
their turn, had called their Corporals?eloquence
to the rescue.
When Corporal Lempote received the order
to initiate his men into the mysteries of the
battle of Balaclava, he felt about as equal to
the task, as if he had been requested to
lecture at Algiers ?Varsity on the intricacies
and vagaries of microcosmoprotoplasmobact-
eriology or words to that effect.
On expiration of his voluntary term of
enlistment, he had reenlisted and during his
6 odd years of faithful service, had so far,
mostly employed his none too frequent spare-
time in the contemplation of elegant spirals
of blue smoke, emitted by his fidus Achates,
an honest if grimy briar pipe, or in setting
afire the tumultuous hearts of pretty Moorish
damsels.
But never had he pondered on or wondered
at what might have happened on this globe,
prior to his adorning same : he was discretion
personified and minding his own business
was a rooted principle with him.
But, being an old soldier he remembered
that the word Impossible is not to be found
in the Army dictionary. He had to tell the
men about the battle of Balaclava, so it would
be done. Discipline overrules everything,
and, when all?s said and done, to carry out
uncarriable orders is the a.b.c. of the military
profession.
So, Lempote, after a copious dinner, sat
alone at his table, ordered a stiff brandy to
stimulate his palate and imagination, lit his
pipe, and lying at ease, his red checkia
cocked at a perilous angle, in the warm night
air, stirred by the strident squeaks of crickets
in the offing, his eyes fixed on the scintillating
stars above, which bathed his poetic face in
their milky softness, he thought deeply.


The battle of Balaclava ? What the blue
blazes could it be ? The main thing was to
use one?s block.
First, as it was a victory, Napoleon won it.
No doubt on that point.
Who got slops ? It could only be the English
or the Germans, of course, so to save mistakes
he would put both of them in.
Who commanded them ? Lempote vaguely
remembered hearing in his childhood of one
Malborough, who probably lived about that
time, so he would generously put him in
command of the enemy forces.
But where was Balaclava ? That question
was easily solved as anybody can tell a
Spanish name by the sound.
It?s an easy matter to reconstitute a battle,
when you know who were the winning and
the losing side, the country where it took
place, that a charge of Chasseurs d?Afrique
occurred, and have tactical instincts to boot.
Lempote viewed it all in his imagination
like a coloured biodrama. He would mention
the great leaders whose names had reached
him, Marshall MacMahon, Jean-Bart, Kleber,
and Duguesclin and all would be right. He
had got hold of his subject.
Enthusing over his genius, he rewarded it
with two more brandies, and went to rest his
massive intellect.
Next day saw him telling his men the
moving story of a battle fought in Spain,
near Gibraltar : how 10.000 French found
themselves faced by 200.000 Anglo-German
troops. How things went badly for a while
for their glorious ancestors, when Napoleon
unexpectedly appeared on the scene with an
escort of the 2nd Chasseurs d?Afrique.
How Napoleon who was no fool, sized the
situation at a glance, and said to Duguesclin :
?S?truth, this game ?s up to Gyptian Mail?
Duguesclin, who was no fool, either, answer-
ed : Dont talk rot, all?s well as you have a
2nd Chass? d?Af? squadron with you.??
So the great Napoleon said : ?Gripes, I?d
forgotten it, Take the lead, save the army
and Vive the Algerian troops?.
Ah, if the men could have seen that charge,
oh, what a charge. The enemy was licked
into a cocked hat. Marlborough went mad
and blew his brains out. And all that was
thanks to who? to the glorious 2nd Chas-
seurs.
And to stop any velleity of asking unneces-
sary questions, Lempote ended : "You?ve all
understood what I?ve told you ? Right oh,
dismiss and break off.? And with the true
innate modesty of greatness, he withdrew
from the admiration of his audience.
In their clean tunics, as resplendent * as so
many suns, all the troopers stood at ease in
front of the tables, being allowed to contem-
plate and even sniff at the luscious viands
smoking in front of them, but compelled? to
await the Colonel?s arrival, to attack same.
The squadron cooks had surpassed them-
selves (Praise the Lord) and every man had
beside his plate, guess what, a cigar, yes, a
real, live penny cigar.
At 4, the Colonel entered, followed by the
Officers; the band played the Regimental
March, Bengal fires lit up, at the four corners of
the shed, and in this rather smoky apotheosis,
the Colonel pronounced a short (Thank God)
but stirring allocution, calling his men worthy
descendants of glorious ancestors, then ap-
proaching a table with glasses ready set,
called out the oldest trooper in the Regiment,
and clinking his glass against his, drunk the
health of all his friends, his children, the
troopers of the 2nd.
Then, following a time hallowed custom
the roar of: "Vive the Colonel? greeted this
original speech, rattling the windows, blowing
the paper lanterns out, and starting in mad
flights old and honoured families of bats,
denizens of the riding school beams. Then
repetition of Regimental march, new outburst
of Bengal fire, which threatened to smoke
us out.
Then the Colonel pronounced the fatidic
words, so anxiously awaited : "And now, boys,
sit down and a good appetite to you.?
This order was obeyed with alacrity and
they opened fire.
The O.C, passed along the tables, admiring
the menus, and letting a cheering word fall
now and then, from his ruby lips, on the men
who choked with emotion and stuffed turkey.
Before leaving the Hall, to see if his orders
had been strictly carried out, he picked a
corpulent young man, engaged in mortal
combat with the leg of a deceased hare, at the
last table occupied by Lempote?s men, and
asked him to briefly describe the battle sub
litigio.
By a dispensation of Providence, the men
had some instruction : recalling his school
training, he gave the exact rendition of
events, the attack of the Russians, the falling


back of the British, and their rescue by the
heroic charge of the Chass' d'Af.
Satisfied, the Colonel turned to the Captain,
and said : I congratulate you, Captain, on the
way my instructions have been carried out in
your squadron.
Then the Officers Heft the hall and the men
unrestrainedly fell to with a will.
The Colonel's congratulations had ricochet-
ed from rank to rank, until they reached
Lempote and as his colleagues asked him
where he'd learnt it all, he modestly said :
I just worked it up, from the relation of
ancestors of mine.
But, if his glory as an historian had been
proclaimed, his pride as a corporal was
wounded to the quick. There was no gain-
saying the fact that his recital had practically
received, in front of his men, the flattest of
contradiction, and he wouldn't put up with it.
That night, when the deus ex machina of
the day, retired to his virgin couch, he was
greeted by his corporal, who was awaiting
him astride his bed.
Say, come here, Mr. Knowall, I congratu-
late you on the way vou listened to what
I taught you. Where did you get the yarn you
pitched to the Boss ?
But, Corporal, that's in History.
Oh, its in History, is it. You've seen it there,
have you ? First, let me tell you that all you
told the Colonel was so many lies, and
the old man pulled your leg, for certain.
Second, is it me or History that's
your superior Officer ? Do you obey me or
History ? Do you think Tm going to ruin
my health, trying to educate you, and all,
for sweet Field Artillery ? So long as you're
in the Army, there's only my Balaclava that
goes, and to teach you to give me back slack
about it, you'll hear more about it.
Which I did, when my crime sheet showed :
two days Fatigue, for repeated inattention
during instruction and perverting the mean-
ing of same.
?Rana Gallica.?
The Sentry?s Lullaby to a Shirker.
Hush thee, gentle shirker, sleep
In thy nest so warm.
Foes from thee Fll strive to keep ;
Sleep thee, fear no harm.
Not far off the guns are mumbling,
Homes and ancient temples tumbling.
Still I guard thee, sweet civilian,
Thou and that refraining million ;
Though the icy night winds chafe,
What care I since thou sleep safe ?
Hush ! Hush 1
Let no dreams thy rest disturb,
As to landing Huns ;
We will keep them on the curb,
Guard thee from their guns,
Let no foolish dreams of duty
Mar thy sleep and spoil thy beauty.
Hush ! Think not of Belgium's sorrow,
Thou hast golf to play to-morrow.
Here in mud and rain I tread
Thanking Heav?n thou'rt safe in bed.
Hush! Hush 1
Angry clouds the heaven's rake ;
I'm so chilled with fear
Lest you should'st; perchance awake ?
Wake and volunteer !
Pretty one, so sweetly snoring,
Thy strong hands weren't meant for warring
They were meant to smite together
At the goaling of the leather;
And thou hast a sweetheart true ?
Some of us have sweethearts, too ?
Still that need not thee upset;
Slumber on, my pretty pet.
Hush ! Hush !
Chilly dawn, once more propelled
By Time's heartless hub,
Shows fair England still unshelled ?
Safe, thy pub and club.
For thy health great men are bleeding,
Heroes drown to keep thee feeding.
Peer and Plebian lives are giving,
Much as they, like thee, love living.
Sportsmen die to stay the Hun,
Holding such as thee ?in one."
Athletes die lest through the poles,
??Black Maria" shoots some goals.
Blood runs fast lest they home totter?
Sleep on sweetly, b?y rotter !

Mew Zealand Records Section,
EDITORIAL.
All papers of repute expect their Editors to
get up upon their hind legs at the New Year
and say something, to review the past and to
forecast the future. Let us endeavour not to
be boring. Our future lies upon the knees of
the Gods, we shall continue our irresponsible
existence for the duration of the War.
Our past may arouse a certain feeling of
complacency; we are yet adolescent, our
birth was heralded with no paean of praise
from a jealous Press, but now, whether
wanted or not, we make our bow for the third
time before a rapidly extending public.
From places so far apart as Cornwall and
Walvis Bay already come appreciative notices
of our efforts.
Mr. Herbert Thomas, the well-known poet
and Editor of the ?Cornishman? which circu-
lates wherever mining camps art to be found
as well as in the Delectable Duchy, reprinted
the poem on ?Homes? which appeared in our
first issue and eulogized our production,
calling it both cheery, philosophical, poetical,
and flippant.
Thank you, Herbert, you are placed on the
free list for that.
Lieutenant A.W.H. Frost of the Railway
Regiment in Irouth West Africa sends us
from the dusty sand and fly blown waste of
Walvis Bay a stirring poem which will be
handy to keep by us when we have got to the
arm-chair-before-the-fire stage of life and
have dyed our moustache.
We can hand it to our grandchildren who
pester us with questions as to the particular
part we played in the Great war and tell them
not to worry Grand-Dad : we played the game.
We have no absurd pretensions; we are not
a spiritual lamp-post against which the
wobbly sinner can lean when he feels over
frisky, nor do we claim to be mental pabulum
for the erudite.
It has been remarked that we are showing
a tendency to become middle-aged before our
time but that is a distinguishing mark of
extreme youth? at least this issue has no
parish magazine tendency.
Christmas has come and gone with it's
normal percentage of headache. Here*comes
the youngster?the New Year.
What has he got in his Pandora box for us
and the rest of the world ?
Obsessed as we are with the thought of
War, our first hope is the extermination of
what Prussian domination stands for, and
recompense for the smaller nations who have
suffered.
Years cannot pass without changing us; a
shock such as we and others have experienced
?to come suddenly from quiet homes, from
little gardens down under, where sunbeams
sleep in beds of flowers, into a world ablaze ?
must leave a mark on our characters.
And this Egypt, with its Oriental frank-
ness, where invitations to be drenched with
sooty showers of vice are so frequently pressed
upon us, will leave its imprint.
War is a brutalizing business anyway, but
the blackened places in our souls will blossom
again.
We are fed up ?let us admit it?we have
given our liberty to gain liberty and are
prepared to carry on to the finish even if it
leaves us bald-headed, but what we all long
for is for the time to come when we can
throw our tunics on the dust heap of oblivion,
fill our lungs with a deep drught of good
New Zealand air, and take our wandering way
again unchecked, free men once more, to go
where we will, to forget such things as
Orderly Rooms, Courts-Martial, Stew, Biscuits,
Bully Beef, salutes, Tents, Horse Lines,
fatigues, Detention Barracks, picquets passes,
etc. etc. and to get away to where those arms
are waiting to throw themselves in passionate
abandonment around our necks ?the arm I am
thinking of is brown and is in Samoa,
probably practising on some-one else, but no
matter. ?
So here's to it boys, the New Year, a world
at peace, and the encircling arm.

?Merci?
An Imaginative Sketch.
The setting sun was painting it's last
picture, making of the Desert a sea of soft-
toned colour harmonies, blood-red and gold,
and I sat at my window high up at the
Bel-Air Hotel at Suez watching for Night?s
swift fingers to blot it all out.
As so often happens, when one is relaxed
mentally and bodily, memories came stealing
down the quiet avenues of Thought.
These memories, which were mostly of the
South Seas, were rudely disturbed by the
discordant clangour of the dinner gong rever-
berating through the Hotel, and, as I came
down, 1 saw an unusually nondescript crowd
in the Hall.
A passenger boat from Colombo had, for
some reason, put in before going on through
the Canal, and amid the subdued susurrus of
conversation I caught fleeting references to
submarines and floating mines.
What on earth did it matter if the whole
shipload had been blown to perdition or the
other place; it was too hot to do more than
lazily wonder what exactly the trouble had
been.
From my table I watched them come in
with but a listless interest; it had been a
scorching day, and these people, the usual
pot-pourri to be found on a P and O Liner,
failed to interest me till
She came in.
A tall, deep-bosomed woman, from 36 to 38
carrying herself regally, like Juno, with Titian
coloured hair, having a slightly foreign
expression, perfect in pose and figure.
Holding her hand a boy of from six to
eight, and, close behind the Lord Proprietor,
one of those well-groomed Englishmen who
can always be trusted to do the right thing,
but dull, damnably dull, at all times, and if
possible more boring when slightly mellow.
How well I knew the tvpe, and she was his
wife, there was no doubt about that.
But,|jJfor all her hauteur and" affectation of
correctness as the British Matron, she was
certainly Mad Madge, the most expensive
light-of-love the Federated Malay States had
ever known.
I rubbed my eyes and steadied myself with
a deep gulp of whisky, whilst she just glanced
carelessly in my direction ?one of those cold
passionless looks which go through a man
without seeing him ?and busied herself with
her boy.
Had she forgotten that purple week we had
together at Raffles Hotel at Singapore, and
again that extraordinary meeting at Vila in
the New Hebrides ?
There was I, just out of the French Hospital
at Vila, still weak from fever, and Madge, an
incongruous figure in an opera cloak, pacing
up and down the deck of a copra catcher
which had just come in.
I had hailed her then aud she had told me
that she had a lover somewhere up the coast
and she was going to him for a while.
It was always ?for a while? with Madge, as
for as lovers were concerned; how long then
could this impossible menage-a-trois be
expected to last. Judging from the boy?s age
it had already lasted for seven or eight years.
The boy was a miniature replica of his
Father; I could imagine him in after years,
adjusting a monocle, looking out upon the
world with a bored expression and saying
?Haw.?
The little beast, I could have strangled him,
and my fingers unconsciously tightened on
my bread.
His Father?s cold superiority would pro-
bably fail to altogether stifle the diablerie he
was bound to inherit from his Mother and he
would make a secret drinker.
Let it go at that.
Dinner was consumed somehow, I noticed
that Madge if it was Madge, ate nothing, and
I determined to see the Comedy, or perhaps
Tragedy, out.
They rose first, the Lord Proprietor ahead
this time, but Madge did not follow him
straight out.


Instead she deviated so as to pass my table,
and, as she passed, she said one word ?Merci
?and passed out without looking at me.
I did the only thing a decent man could do,
packed my bag, made excuses to the Hotel
Manager, and caught the night train to
Ismailia
and thenl woke up, still in my chair and still
at Suez.
What unwarrantable liberties a vagrom
brain will take with us at times.
I know no-one of the name of Madge, nor
had I ever been at Singapore.
Worse than all it was nearly ten o?clock
and my dream dinner was but a Barmecide
feast.
That gulp of whisky too was but a phantom
draught,and left no taste behind.
It was after hours but I rang the bell, and
as an ebon face appeared round the corner I
uttered the one word which is the same in all
languages ?whisky ?and heard with interior
satisfaction his obedient feet swiftly patter
down the corridor.

Retrospection.
1933.
Long since have passed those years of strife
When Hunnish spawn lay bare the knife
To strive for mastery.
Yet still is with us through the years;
We who come from that vale of tears
To victory.
Those Hellish scenes when war dogs swept
Swift to their task ; Yea never slept
Till all was done.
The old wounds ache ; the ribbons fade ;
Give us to sleep in peaceful glade,
Our course is run.
But thank the Lord who made us men,
We knew the game and played it them.
Thank God for that.
That we may look the world in face,
For took we then no shirkers place.
In time of stress.
Rather we leave this goodly fame,
That duties roll-call holds our name.
Nor must confess.
Confusion, when children at our knee,
Crave for the tales ot Tipparee,
That long, long way.
Nor will to us, dread angeFs call
Bring fear of judgement, nor appal
To bid us stay.
The scars we bear are honour?s: won in fight
To right the wrong. The memory?s bright,
Nor wots of shame
Let the dread angel his gauntlet fling,
We?ll take it up for knows our King
We played the game.

From the New Zealand Times.
A bright tittle regimental paper, ?The
Honk,? issued by the Australian Divisional
Ammunition Park, now serving with a British
unit in France, has made its appearance in
the actual war zone, where it must be in great
demand, for it contains not only amusing
topical personal items, but all the latest news
from home. According to one of the latest
numbers: ??Two English privates were sitting
in an estaminet Pother evening, conversing
loudly in French. A couple of Australians
at an adjoining table decided that they were
not going to allow themselves to be out-
swanked. So one, who came from New South
Wales, remarked excitedly to his companion :
?Wagga Wagga walgett woolloomooloo wee
waa wallerawang woolgoolga yarramalong.?
?Woollongabba,? replied his comrade, who
came from Queensland. ?Cunnamulla too-
woomba toowong thargomindah indoroopilly
camooweal goondiwindi.? 'Bondi coogee ma-
roubra,? said the other with very great deter-
mination. 'Excuse me/ said one of the
Englishmen, ?but what language is that you?re
speaking?? ?Oh,that?s our Australian language,
he was told, 'We learnt English before we
came away, but we always prefer to speak
our own language among ourselves.? ?
(This mention of the ?Honk? will have more
than a passing interest for some members of
the Australian Records Section, and for many
others of our wide and growing circle of
readers.
When the great steamship ?Ceramic,? yclept
?H.M.A.T. A 40? was, a little more than a year
ago, cleaving the (luckily) still waters of
more than one ocean on her voyage from
Melbourne to Alexandria, the ?Honk?? was
first conceived in the fertile brain of a member
of the D.A.P. Its sub-title was ?The Voice of
the Benzine Lancers,? but it was more than
that to the 3000 troops on board. The printing
press was on the open deck, and in itself
provided interest and amusement for many a
necessarily idle passer-by. The present Editor
of the ?Anzac Records Gazette? was Associate
Editor of the ?Honk?: he still survives, and
so, apparently does the ?Honk,? but many,
alas, of those 3000 who saw its birth will
never read a printed line again.)
That Lane.
There was a something happened in that
lane. A something that made all and sundry
hold their breath. The fleeing Europeans, the
bewildered soldiers, caused many to assemble
there but they too in turn turned their backs
and hurried somewhere else. The Native
policeman with his proud step and his sedate
appearance appeared on the scene to invest-
igate. He too hurried to shelter. Even the
jabbering Arabs ceased their babble and
hurried onwards. The Jehu in his carriage
whipped his horses to a gallop and sent his
carriage along the road to escape. The
serious English picquet burst headlong away
despite the frantic appeal of their Officer to
halt; The passers-bye never turned to look
and the black boot-cleaners lifted their boxes
and sprang with cat like agility around the
corner. The soldiers of the King looked at
one another in amazement as they swung
boldly on. Everybody made haste from the
awfulness of the scene, for it wasn?t violets.
