undoubtedly the inventor ol Chlorodyne; that the whole story of the defendant wras deliberately
untrue. Chemists thij.nighout the land will confirm this decision that Dr. J. C. BROWN L was

NOBLES WHO CAME FROM TRADE.
Most of the great noblemen of the present day are
descended, by no means remotely, from tradespeople.
Thus the Prime Minister, the Marquis of Salisbury, is
descended in a direct line from a draper ; the late Duke of
Buckingham from a grocer, the Marquis of Bath from a
tailor, the late Lord Palmerston from a grocer, and the
Earl of Warwick from a liquor dealer.
TOO MUCH COMPANY.
Tom Roper was an Essex farmer of the old style, open,
and free-hearted as the day, but somewhat inclined to be
more plain-spoken than polite in his manner of expressing
himself.
On one occasion his wife asked a large party to dinner
rather against his wish, as several of the guests stood none
tco high in his estimation. On assembling in the dining-
room, it was found that sufficient visitors had not been
provided for. “My dear,” said Mrs. Roper, “we have not
enough chairs.” “OH! Ay !” says Tom, “there’s chairs
enough-—plenty of chairs. Too much company, that’s
what’s the matter.
CHILDREN CHOOSE THEIR OWN NAMES
In New Zealand the Maori priest repeats to the infant
a lengthy list of the names of its ancestors, fixing upon the
one which the child, by sneezing or crying when it is
uttered, is considered to select for itself.
In Russia the Cheremiss shakes the baby till it cries,
and then repeats a string of names to it till it chooses one
itself by ceasing its tears.
A gentleman, who was spending a month in the
Highlands, went to hire a carriage for the purpose of
taking his family for a drive. He looked at a vehicle, and
enquired how many it would hold. The ostler scratched
his head thoughtfully, and replied, “It hands four
generally, but six if they’re weel acquaint.”

COUNTY
CRICKET OF
1896.
'T'HE Ccrnty Cricket Season of 1896 -was
■* brought to a close on the znd of September.
It was an eventful four months. The County
Championship was contested by no fewer than
fourteen counties, and the fine dry weather
which prevailed all through the season till the
middle 0/ A ugust provided the kind of wickets
that batsmen and spectators loz’e.
'I he records of the games show Yorkshire in
the first place, with last years champions,
Surrey, below both Lancashire and Middlesex.
The representatives of the County f’alatine
have again secured second place, but Middlesex
have improved their position in splendidfashion,
gaining third place, instead of being bracketed
sixth with IVarwickshire,
i-rom 1887 onwards Surrey, the late champion
county, enjoyed an extraordinary series of
triumphs, having held the Championship year
after year, except in 1889, when it shared the
honours with A ottinghamshire and Lancashire,
and in 1893, when \ o-kshire came to the front.
It is no doubt to the interest of the competition
that the championship should occasionally
change hands, and it could not fall to the lot of
a more popular eleven than those who have it
now in possession.
In a I there were 126 county engagements, a
number falling half a dozen short of those of
1895, the falling off being caused by the inability
of several counties to renew their matches with
Essex and Leicestershire on account of the visit
of the Australians and the extra fixtures
accordingly introduced.
It will be notice L that of the 126 games, no
fewer than 35 had to be left drawn, either on
account of heavy scoring or curtailment of the
play by the weather.

Notable Copies of the Bible.
The following is an interesting list of Bibles which
have become notable, and have earned bye-names for the
grotesque mistakes which Ihey contain :
The “ Wicked Bible ” is so called on account of the
omission of the negative from the yth (6th) Commandment.
The copy recently put up for sale was accompanied by a
letter from Mr. H. Stevens to its last owner, who, after
complimenting him on its acquisition, adds : “ I told an
anxious and curious old lady, at the Caxton Exhibition,
that though this Seventh Commandment was found printed
in the Bible, it is not now generally considered binding.”
The edition was, of course, suppressed.
The “ Bugge ” Bible is thus termed from the fifth
verse of the Psalm xci. : “ So that thou shall not nede to
be afrayed for any bugges by night,” instead of “ the terror
by night,” as in the authorised version.
Dr. Wright enumerates other editions that have become
famous The “Breeches” Bible—“ Then the eies of them
both were opened, and they knew that they were naked,
and they sewed figge tree leaves together, and made
themselves breeches” (Gen. iii., 7) ; printed in 1560.
The “Treacle ’ Bible—“ Is there not treacle at
Gilead ? Is there no physician there ? ” (Ter. viii. 22) :
printed in 1568,
The “ Rosin ” Bible—“ Is there no rosin in Gilead ?
Is there no physician there ?” (Jer.viii. 22); printed in 1609.
The “ Place Makers ” Bible—“ Blessed are the place
makers ; for they shall be called the children of God ”
(Matt. v. 9); printed in 1651-2.
The “ Vinegar” Bible—“ The parable of the vinegar,”
instead of the “ vineyard,” appears in the chapter heading
to Luke xx. in an Oxford edition of the authorised version
which was published in 1717.
The “ Ears-to-ear ” Bible—“ Who hath ears to ear,
let him ear ” (Matt, xiii, 43) ; printed in 1810.
The “ Standing Fishes ” Bible—“ And it shall come to
pass that the fishes will stand upon it,” instead of “fishers”
(Ezek. xlvii, 10) ; printed in 1806.

WORDS WHICH
MAY
The wealth of the mind
-WARD work is only hard to those who do
not put heart in it.
There are no really strong people In this
world but good people.
The art of happiness in love consists in giving
everything without asking for anything.
It is a faith in something and enthusiasm for
something that makes life worth looking at.
There is no day born but comes like a stroke
of music into the world and sings itself all the
way through.
Government and co-operation are in all
things the laws of life ; anarchy and competition
the laws of death.
Make yourself complete master of what you
have learned, and be alw'ays learning something
new ; you may then be an instructor of men.
Wealth is a steep hill
which the father climbs
slowly, and which the son
often tumbles down precipi-
tately.
Since I cannot govern
my tongue, though within
my own teeth, how can 1
hope to govern the tongues
of others ?
Sunshine,
Great talents need to
be balanced with great hu-
mility. It is a lack of this
ballast that causes people
with the big head to topple
over.
These words from the ‘
Bible are often quoted —“ Put not your trust in
princes,” but the end of the sentence is forgotten
■ —“for they are but men.”
The thoroughly great men are those who have
done everything thoroughly, and who have
never despised anything, however small, of God’s
making. .
Whether any particular day _shall_ bring to
you more of happiness or suffering is largely
beyond your power to determine. Whether each
day of your life shall give happiness or suffering
rests with yourself. _ .
Whatever your sex or position, life is a
battle in which you are to show your pluck, and
woe be to the coward. Despair and postpone-
ment are cowardice and defeat. Men are born
to succeed, and not to fail.
There are two things which will make us
happy in this life if we attend to them. The
first is never to vex ourselves about what we
cannot help ; and the second, never to vex our-
selves about what we can help. _
The human heart is like a millstone in a mill.
When you put wheat under it, it turns and grinds
and bruises the wheat into flour; if you put no
wheat under it, it still grinds on, but then it is
itself that it grinds, and it slowly wears away.
When facts are wanting, and speculation, or
con jecture, is the basis of our opinion—or belief
or faith —we are as helpless as if navigating un-
known seas in thick weather. When we are off
soundings, of both authority and reason, a plum-
met of feathers is as good as a plummet of lead.
A good name is a rich inheritance.
INFLUENCE US
is the only true wealth.

Hearts were never lighter —

that man.
TT7HREE things come not back —a sped arrow,
a broken word, a lost opportunity.
A man begging for bread asid buj ing beer is a
great discouragement to charity.
If you want your wife to be an angel, treat
her like one, and see what comes of it.
Lovingkindness is greater than law's, and
the charities of life are more than all cere-
monies.
The world is full of people who want to do
good, but they are in no hurry about making
the start.
There is a paradox in pride : it makes some
men ridiculous, but prevents others from be-
coming so.
Whenever you hear a man dissuading you
from attempting to do well on the ground that
it is “Utopian,” beware of
Never wait for a thing
to turn up. Go and turn it
up yourself. It takes less
time, and it is surer to be
done.
Things tint will wear
are not to be had cheap,
whether it be a fabric or a
principle ; if it is to endure,
it must cost something.
If wrinkles must be
written on our brows, let
them not be written upon
the heart. The spirit should
never grow old.
Never be discouraged by trifles. If a spider
breaks his thread twenty times, he will mend it
as many. Perseverance and patience will accom-
plish wonders.
No man can be said to have reached the
higher walks of life, for when he has reached
where the higher walks are supposed to be, he
stops walking and commences to ride.
A house ought to be an interpretation of the
mind of its owner ; in reality it is seldom any-
thing of the kind, because inexperience and
haste put it together, and everyone knows that
what is there remains.
The chief art of learning is to attempt but little
at a time. The,widest excursions of the mind
are made by short flights frequently repeated ;
the most lofty fabrics of science are formed
by the continued accumulation of single pro-
positions. ... ~ ,
Merely to avoid what is disagreeable has
nothing to do with pride of station. \ ulgar
society is disagreeable, which is a sufficient
reason for keeping aloof^ from it. Among people
of refinement, association or even friendship
is possible in spite of difference of rank and
fortune.
Jealousy violates contracts, dissolves so-
ciety, breaks wedlock, betrays friends and
neighbours ; nobody is good, and everyone is
either doing or designing a mischief. Its rise is
guilt or ill-nature, and by reflection it thinks its
own fault to be other men’s, as he that is over-
run with the jaundice takes others to be yellow.

A little boy who
was told that the tiny
baby sister he was bend-
ing over had come from
heaven, looked at her
awhile, and then said,
softly, “Please tell us
all about heaven, baby,
before you forget it.”
“ Rock-a-by, baby !”

A little girl, four years old, happened to be
sliding upon the ice during the frost, when she
suddenly fell heavily, and was evidently badly
hurt. At the sound of her sobs a friend rushed
to her assistance, and caught her in her arms.
“ You poor little thing ! how did you fall ?” she
asked, sympathetically. The mite raised her
head and replied, between her sobs, “ Vertically."
So much for kindergarten training !
A wealthy lady and her little daughter were
listening to the morning music on the piazza,
when the lady’s-maid handed her a letter which
she tore open and proceeded to read._ The little
daughter looked at her and exclaimed, “ I’m
sorry ; I hoped that was from pa. Why doesn’t
he write?” “How do you know it isn’t from
pa?” the mother inquired. “Because you’ie
reading a lot of it,” the little girl replied. “If it
was from pa it would just say, ‘ Dear raa, am
sorry you aren’t feeling well. Enclosed please
find cheque. Your loving husband, Sam.’ ”

The Ashantee
Expedition.
The history of this expe-
dition will be familiar to
most of our readers. In
the autumn of 1895 an ul-
timatum was despatched
to King Prempeh, the
monarch of Ashantee, re-
quiring him to consent to
the presence of a British
Commissioner at Coomas-
sie, and to the establish-
ment of a British protec-
torate over Ashantee. He
was also called upon to
abandon human sacrifices,
slave-trading, and the
subjugation of the neigh-
bouring tribes.
On the delivery of this
ultimatum the king took
no notice of it, and it was
at last decided to send an
expedition against him,
under the command of
Sir Francis Scott.
This expedition was a
success. In his march to
Coomassie, the capital of
Ashantee, all the obstacles
which Sir Francis had to
encounter were of a mate-
rial kind. King Prempeh
wisely forebore making
any attempt at resistance.
The entry into Coomas-
sie was effected on the
17th of January. As the
various contingents of the
British force entered the
town, they formed up in
the palaver square. King
Prempeh, surrounded by
his chiefs, was seated on
one side of the square,
and made no manifesta-
tions of any kind while
the troops formed up and
lined the square.
will be ready for the table about as soon as those
planted in November, and will yield a more
abundant crop. Plant them in drills wide at the
bottom, and spread the seed regularly. It is a
common error to sow them too thickly and in
narrow drills ; the wide drill is particularly im-
portant for marrow-fats and other branching
sorts. Sow Bath or green Egyptian cos lettuce.
Currant and raspberry bushes unfold their leaves
at the end of this month. Prepare netting and
other protection for wall trees, and use it when
the buds begin to swell during the prevalence of
north-easterly winds. Before the b ids are much
swelled, prune apricots, peaches, nectarines, and
plums ; and also apples, pears, cherries, etc.

“I, Ethelwolfe, by the grace of God, King of
the West Saxons, etc., with the advice of the
Bishops, Earls, and all persons of distinction in
my dominions, have, for the health of my soul,
the good of my people, and the prosperity of my
kingdom, taken the honourable resolution of
granting the tenth part of the lands throughout
my whole kingdom to the Church and ministers
of religion, to be enjoyed by them, with all the
privilege of a free tenure, and discharged from
all the encumbrances incident to lay-fees. This
grant has been made by us in honour of Jesus
Christ, the Blessed Virgin, and all Saints, and
out of regard to the Pascal solemnity, and that
Almighty God might vouchsafe his blessings on
us and our posterity. Dated at Wilton, Ann.
Dom. 854, at the Feast of Easter.”
The Japan Gazette , published in Yokohama,
was edited by a woman, who has been deposed
through a change of proprietorship. In her
valedictory she says :
“ It has been urged more than once that under
the present editorship it has been impossible for
our contemporaries to write freely; but when we
recall the fact that we have been termed a liar
and a virago, likened to a senseless creature who
pokes the fire from the top, stigmatised as an
irate female, a female fibber, and alluded to
in a variety of other amicable ways, we are
tempted to wonder to what limits journalistic
freedom aspires to soar.” She then adds:—
“ I leave thee not with vain regret ,
Nor yet with vow to thee forget;
A man, I might have filled thee yet,
My Editorial Chair ! ”

rouen. 'VVV an aged clergyman said to him :
“ Young man, when you are as old as I am, you
. „ , c — , r , will understand that it is easier to be pious than
A Tale of Good Luck. it is to be good.”
.... Whittier himself, when old, said to a youth,
I'herb was a young man on a station in South My i a( j ) if thou wouldst win success, join thy-
Austraiia,” says a well-known writer, “ who, self to some unpopular but noble cause.’’
“ There was a young man on a station in South
Australia,” says a well-known writer, “ who,
three or four years before I heard the tale, was
receiving 20s. a week and his ‘ tucker ’ as a
boundary-rider.
” He was playing euchre with a friend, who,
after he had lost all his ready money, staked an
original share, which he had just purchased for
.£lOO or £l2O in a new silver mine, known as
Broken Hill Silver Mine. The boundary-rider won.
“A few months later he and another friend
went up to the mine to see how it was going on.
As they were returning to Adelaide they caught
a dangerous fever, and they were nursed by a
stranger.
The Birds Have Come
THE birds have comet The birds have
come!
God bless them, how they sing !
They fill the air with melody ,
And make the whole world ring ;
The blackbird and the robin,
And all the birds of spring.
“ The friend died ; the successful euchre-
player recovered.
“• When he was better he said to the stranger,
‘You have rendered me the greatest service one
man can render to another, for you have saved
my life. You ought to have a share of my luck.
I will divide with you. Here’s a cheque for
£15,000. My share in Broken Hill is worth
£30,000.’
“ I was telling this story at the table of a
friend of mine in London a few months after my
return to England ; there was only one guest
besides myself, and he was a well-known stock-
broker from Melbourne.
“ When I had finished he said, ‘ Yes ; I know
the boundary-rider very well, and did business
for him. The story is quite true. He held his
share for a time, and sold out at an enormous
price ; but if he had held till now, he would
have been worth £600,000.’ ”
I hear them in the bare tree-tops,
That stand so dull and grey ;
/ hear them sing in quips and chirps,
And merry roundelay ;
And if I longer listen,
They'll sing my heart away.
What though the sky be dark and chill ,
And winds blow fierce and wild t
We know the flowers will bloom again
Where often they have smiled.
Tor oh ! the birds are singing
Brave songs of springtime mild.
And when we hear , hope buds anew ;
We can 710 longer weep,
For lo ! as in the fairy tale—
The birds the secret keep —
A wakes again a princess
Who erstwhile slumbered deep.

The principal sowing of all the hardy annuals
should now be finished ; the sowing of the half-
hardy should be completed by the end of the
month. Transplant hardy biennials, such as
wall-flowers, Brompton stocks, hollyhocks, etc.,
if this was not done in autumn. Auriculas in
bloom should be protected against sun and rain,
but should be allowed as much air as possible.
They must be watered regularly, and the use of
manure water on alternate days will improve the
bloom. The water should never go on the
leaves. One may now make to advantage cut-

Success.
Let a man start with fixed
principles and with a de-
termination to win by the
practice of fairness to-
ward all, and he is bound
to succeed. He needs to
look out for his business
and see that those under
him are as honourable in
every way. A man who
does that will find friends
among both customers
and fellow business men.
A True Lady.
I A true lady not only is
] always at ease, no matter
\ with whom she is con-
versing, but she co trives
also to make her com-
panion as much at ease
as herself. Some people,
quite unintentionally,
cause uncomfortable
pauses in conversation,
simply by the habit of
hearing in perfect silence
a remark which is not
actually a question. It is
not that they wish to ig-
nore it, but it does not
occur to them that a reply
or comment is required,
so the unfortunate utterer
of the remark feels
snubbed, and ceases to
chat with the same ani-
mation as before. One
simple rule to bear in
mind will go a great way
toward winning the repu-
| tation of being a pleasant
\ companion. It is always
to show some interest in
whatever is said to you.
Often the subject may be
one in which you have not
the slightest concern, but
you must show interest
all the same.
tings of verbenas, heliotropes, etc. Watch rose-
trees and free them from grubs. Garden pests—
caterpillars, bettles, red spiders, ants, etc. —are
now very active. Repot window plants, and
thin them out if necessary. Rake beds smooth,
turn up gravel walks, and clip box-edgings. In
a shady place insert slips of sage, thyme, lavender,
and other herbs, and sow mustard and cress under
a south wall. In the fruit garden disbudding—
that is to say, relieving the shoots of wall-trees
of some of their buds just when they begin grow-
ing—is now to be attended to.

Lord Leighton,
The funeral of Lord
Leighton took place with
solemn ceremony in St.
Paul’s Cathedral on the
3rd of February,lB96. The
coffin, which had lain in
the Octagon Room of the
Royal Academy pend-
ing the funeral, was
surrounded and covered
by great numbers of
wreaths. The mass of
wreaths having been re-
moved and piled on a
car, the coffin was carried
down and placed on the
hearse in the courtyard
of Burlington House
shortly before Ti in the
morning, and a procession
was formed to St. Paul’s
Cathedral. It included
between thirty and forty
carriages, conveying the
pall-bearers, representa-
tives of various Royal
personages, relatives of
the deceased, officials.
Academicians, Associates
and students of the
Royal Academy, and was
headed by members of
the Artists Volunteer
Corps. The procession,
passing through great
crowds of spectators, ar-
rived shortly after noon
at the Cathedral, in which
a very large and repre-
sentative congregation of
mounters had assembled.
As the coffin was placed
in front of the opening
leading to the crypt,
where it was to be de-
posited, Colonel the Hon.
\V. Carington, who at-
tended to represent the
Queen, placed upon it a
wreath sent by her Ma-
jesty. The lesson was
read by the Dean, and
the rest of the service was
conducted by the Arch-
bishop of York.

She and I.
fFHFV say that the weather is had—that the
L snow - ■ ■ -- •
Lies thick on the ground , that the skies 'are
grey, ,
That the world is a mourning for summer: I
know -
That the summer's noon closes the winter's
day,
That out in the city the winds sob and moan ;
But what do I care if the world's all awry,
For with us the sun shines as we sit here alone ,
For she is at work—and so am I.
They say that the world—that’s to say, people
in it —
All Shout Together.
Are treachl rous and false when they seem to
be fair ,
And the praise of the mob, when you've striven
to win it,
Is just like an iceberg— ifs brilliant—and bare,
Thai nothing is worth half the trouble we give it,
That tears sound through when we're half
mad with glee ;
But I am content with my life —as I live it,
For I am at work—and so is she.
A great part of the din that beats upon the air
of China comes of the raising and lowering of
masts and sails, for on all except the sea-going
craft the masts are hinged, and are for ever being
pulled up or let down. To do this work the
Chinese crews are bunched together on each
deck, where they shout with each output of
strength. “ Hee-tah, hee-tah, hoo-ah, hoo-ah,
hee-tah ! ” they chant, or grunt, whenever two, or
twenty, or two hundred Chinamen work together at
anything. A common sight in the cities is to see
fifty of them pounding the earth for the founda-
tion of a new building. Every man, upon a high
scaffold, tugs at a rope, and all the ropes meet at
one big rock, that is lifted and dropped inces-
santly upon the ground to harden it. I say
“ every man,” but there are always boys, and
even baby boys, at some of the ropes. All shout
together, beginning at daybreak, when all work
begins, after which sleep can only be courted
with chloroform. Whenever two men work at
anything, they chant, whether it is at the work of
carrying a coffin in a funeral or a bedstead out
of a house.
They say that life isn't worth living—that
sorrow
Lies hid in our hearts when we laugh; well
—perhaps ;
U r e care naught for this, and we don't want to
borrow
The joy of the world — we're ccn’ent with cur
scraps !
And if you would know why /’ m gay, notwith-
standing
The chills of the world, and its people—just see
That my darling and I have a sweet “ under
standing,"
When at! the world works—and so do we.
—Edward Heron Allen.

THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY.
Reminded of His Daughter.
717 H E late Madame Patey, the popular song-
stress, was delighting a large audience in
the Town Hall at Birmingham, when a working
man at the rear of the building was observed to
be in tears. There was nothing in the words of.
the song to account for this display of feeling,
for the famed prima donna was singing in the
Italian tongue ; hut the grief of the man became
more pronounced and annoying ere Madame
Patey had concluded.
At length, amid a thunder of applause, the
singer retired, and the stranger was asked the
reason of his grief.
“She reminds me so of my darter !” said the
tearful one. “ She was in the singing line.”
“ But surely your daughter could not sing like
that?” queried a man on the next seat.
“No,” answered the mourner, with another
sob; “ but you never could tell what she was
singin’ about !”
Stupidity Detected.
Dr. Delaunay, a well-known Paris scientist,
has made some curious observations which show
the connection between little things and great.
To ascertain the qualities of an applicant cook,
he says it is sufficient to give her a plate to clean
or a sauce to make, and watch how she moves
her hand in either act. If she moves it from left
to right, or in the direction of the hands of a
watch, you may trust her ; if the other way, she
is certain to be stupid and incapable.
The intelligence of people may also be gauged,
the doctor says, by asking them to make a circle
on paper with a pencil, and noting in what direc-
tion the hand is moved. The good students in a
mathematical class draw circles from left to right.
The inferiority of the softer sex, as well as of
the male dunces, is shown by their drawing from
right to left. Asylum patients do the same.

Beside the Stile.
WE both walked slowly ever the yellow grass,
Beneath the sunset sky ;
And then he climbed the style—l did not pass —
A nd there we said good-bye.
He paused one moment; I leaned on the stile
A nd faced the hazy lane ;
But neither of us spoke until we both
Just said good-bye again.
And I went homeward to our quaint old farm,
A nd he went on his way;
And he has never crossed that field again
From that time to this day.
I wonder if he ever gives a thought
To what he left behind—
As / start sometimes, dreaming that I hear
A footstep in the wind.
If he had said but one regretful word,
Or I had shed a tear,
He would not go alone about the world.
Nor I sit lonely here.
A las! our hearts were full of angry pride
And love was choked in strife ;
A nd so the stile beyond the yellow grass
Stands straight across our life.

A Curious Medal.
ADOLPHUS, Sweden’s great
hero, commemorated one of his victories,
obtained in the year 1632, by a medal on which
was struck the following chronograramatical in-
scription :
Christ Vs DVX; ergo TrlVMphVs.
36424 s 641 4
In this chronogram all the letters representing
the Roman numerals have been brought into use,
which, arranged in the order set forth by the
figures arranged beneath them, read as MDC=
1600; V VVV or 4xs 20 ; X = 10 ; and II or
IX2 = 2; or, 1632.
Buddhistic Wisdom.
APPY is the man who hath sown in his
> breast the seeds of benevolence ; the pro-
duce thereof shall be charity and love.
From the fountain of his heart shall rise rivers
of goodness, and the streams shall overflow for
the benefit of mankind.
He assisteth the poor in their trouble; he
rejoiceth in furthering the prosperity of all men.
He censureth not his neighbour ; he believeth
not the tales of envy and malevolence, neither
repeateth he their slanders.
He forgiveth the injuries of men—he wipeth
them from his remembrance ; revenge and malice
have no place in his heart.
The griefs and anxieties of men excite his com-
passion ; he endeavoureth to alleviate the weight
of their misfortunes ; and the pleasure of success
rewarded! his labours.
Wigs in the Olden Time,
Queen Elizabeth had no fewer than eighty
attires of false hair.
It is probable, however, that in this respect she
was equalled, if not outdone, by her fair cousin,
the Queen of Scots. For Knollys writes to
Cecil: “ Mary Seaton, who is praised by the
Queen as the finest busker, that is to say, the
finest dresser, of a woman’s head of hair that may
be seen in any country. . . . Yesterday and
this day did she set a curled hair upon the Queen
that was said to be a perewyke, that showed very
delicate.”
Mary wore her periwigs to the last, and was
executed in an auburn peruke. During her life
she was so much addicted to changing the form
and colour of her hair, that on this account
many of her portraits are rendered difficult of
identification.
Towards the end of the reign of Charles 11.
wig-wearing had become all but universal in
England. We find the custom constantly alluded
to in the literature, the drama, and the art of the
period.
The Minstrel.
A WORN old man, withflowing lochs and white,
With brow as pallid as the April flowers,
With eyes so deep, so blue, it seemed the hours
Aging all else had left undimmed their light—
Held an old violin close-clasped and tight,
And improvised with all his master-powers,
Defying grief, zuhile from his bow in showers,
Fell notes that sang both sorrow and delight.
He, hungry, cold, and clad but scantily,
Played all his timid tongue dare not reveal,
His youth!s vain efforts, manhood's strife, the
sore
And bitter sorrows only death can heal —
Lo ! swift awakens from his ecstasy,
A servant struck him trembling from the door.
—From the French of
Theodore de Rauville.

GARDENING
Examine bulbs that are out of the ground ; they
must hot be allowed to become damp, for then
they will mould, and be of little value. Plants,
such as fuchsias, which are meant to bloom in
the windows in autumn, should be prevented from
flowering now. Take off the tops of chrysanthe-
mums. All bands tied round buds and grafts
should now be loosened and removed when they
are no longer required. According to some, it is
better to pot auriculas now than in May. Sow
cinerarias, petunias, and calceolarias ; if left to

Sorrow and Health.
The nervous j system requires complete rest after
blows caused'by sorrow. Recent medical obser-
vations show that the physical results of depress-
ing emotions are similar to those caused by
bodily accidents, fatigue, chill, partial starvation,
and loss of blood.
Grief cannot be ignored, neither can it be
cheered up. It must be accepted, and allowed
to wear itself away. Readjustment comes
slowly.
Sorrow, grief, and all great misfortunes should
be regarded as conditions similar to acute infec-
tious diseases, which they resemble in result; and
later, as convalescence from such diseases.
Seclusion, rest, sleep, appropriate food, fresh
air, sunshine, interests that tax neither mind nor
body, these are requirements in this class of ill-
ness.
The care of the condition following depressing
emotion calls for the same treatment in greater
or less degree. The poison of grief is more than
a name.
CaW|_ PARTY of gentlemen at a Birmingham
Hotel were telling stories one night re-
cently of famous shots, and of how many quails,
partridges, ducks, and other birds had been
killed at a single discharge.
After listening to what seemed a wilful exag-
geration by different narrators, a stranger who
was present volunteered his experience of his only
use of the fatal double-barrelled gun as follows
“ I went into the field one day to try gunning.
The only game discovered was an immense flock
of blackbirds. I should say that there were
10,000 in the flock. Slowly I crawled up towards
them, and when not more than four rods away
the birds rose in a solid mass. I fired both
barrels, and how many do you think I killed?”
Different guesses were made by the party,
ranging from twenty to four hundred.
“ Notone,” said the stranger ; “but I went out
with my brother to look for results, and we picked
up four bushels of legs. I had shota little under."
This was the last story told.
“Thou Didst Not Say Me Nay.”
I PRESSED thy hand at parting, thou didst
not say me nay ;
A smile so soft on dimpled cheek and roguish
lip ’gan play ,
I dared to kiss that templing cheek ,
I dared those honeyed lips to seek;
E’en now I scarce believe it true —thou didst not
To urge work, study, travel, the vain search
for amusement, is both useless and dangerous.
For a time the whole organism is overthrown,
and a temporary seclusion is imperative for proper
readjustment.
After some bereavement the custom of wearing
mourning has a distinct moral value. But its
period of use must be brief—a few weeks, months,
perhaps a year —otherwise dense black draperies
become a burden, an aesthetic blunder, and a
source of depression in themselves.

I asked, might I return, Love ! —thou didst not
say me nay ;
And now / have no rest by night, nor have /

And still I fear to come again ,
And half misdoubt my wondrous gain ;
And half misdoubt that / have dreamed thou

give her lessons two-three months more, and
by-and-by 1 teach her that she can’t sing. That j

the lessons won’t be thrown away.”
Things Left Undone.
bfjP T isn't the thing you do, dear,
O It's the thing you leave undone,
Which gives you a bit ofheo.rtache
A t the setting of the sun ;
The tender word forgotten,
The letter you did not write.
The flower you might have sent, dear,
Are your haunting ghosts to-night.
The stone you might have lifted
Out of the brother’s way,
The bit of hearisome counsel
You were httrried too much to say.
The loving touch of the hand, dear,
The gentle and winsome tone
That you had no time nor thought for,
With troubles enough of your own.
These little acts of kindness.
Cheap Hospitality.
A miser, residing in a little town In Normandy,
could not bring himself to return the civilities of
his friends ; consequently, one fine day his name
was dropped from the list of invitations.
To recover the loss of so many sumptuous i
repasts, he would have to entertain his hosts in j
his turn, and he did not relish that.
At last he was struck by a brilliant idea, and j
he sent out his cards of invitation.
In the middle of the banquet, which was on ,
a magnificent scale, horrible cries were heard, i
and our amphitryon ran out to ascertain the
cause. Soon afterwards he returned, pale, ex-
cited, his hands covered with blood.
“ What has happened? ” cried the guests.
“ A workman, the poor father of a family, has |
been run over just opposite my door ! ”
And without saying another word, the miser,
obeying a generous impulse, snatched up a plate,
in which he placed a few louis, and, handing it
round, collected about six hundred francs, which
he hastened to deliver to the interesting sufferer, i
Next day the guests found that the accident !
was a myth, invented by the miser to recoup
himself for the cost of his dinner.
So easily out op mind,
These chances to be angels
Which even mortals find —
They come in night and silence
Each mild reproachful wraith,
When hope is faint and flagging,
And a blight has dropped on faith.
For life is all too short, dear,
A nd sorrow is all too great,
To suffer our slow compassion
That tarries until too late.
And it's not the thing you do. dear,
It’s the thing you leave undone,
Which gives you the bitter heartache,
At the setting of the sun.
There are Exceptions, However.
An Irishman asked a Scotchman one day why a
railroad engine was always called “she.”
Sandy replied : “ Perhaps it’s on account of
the horrible noise it makes when it tries to
whistle.”

A Change in Literature.
Until the end of the
eighteenth century litera-
ture and art were separ-
able arts ; literature Leing
occupied exclusively with
thoughts, and not con-
cerned with the folds of
the dress, their shape, and
the tones they took in the
shadow, and again the
tones they took when the
lady bade her lover good-
bye, passing as she said
the words into the light
of the lamp which stood
on a small table, and
whose pink shade was
clearly defined on the
rich purple of the win-
dow-curtains. - George

Dunvagan Castle.
Dunvegan Casilf, in

How to Tell a Thief.
“ I always remember a man by his eyes,” said
Detective Sliman, an experienced officer. ‘‘lf
I once get a square look at a man’s eyes I would
recognise him if I met him in Inverness. The
eyes never change ; the face is always changing.
A man with strongly marked features can de-
ceive the shrewdest detectives if the latter have
not made a study of the eyes.
“ There are men whose faces are completely
altered by shaving off a moustache. Even a
week’s growth of beard and a change of clothing
will completely disguise some men. There are
men who look like gentlemen when clean shaven,
and like tramps with a three days’ stubble on
their faces.
“A change from a stiff to a soft hat completely
alters some, but if you have noted their eyes you
cannot mistake them. Every trade and pro-
fession stamps its imprint upon the eyes. If you
will notice closely you will see that the eyes of
the merchant differ from those of the lawyer, the
eyes of the day labourer from those of the skilled
mechanic.

When Trouble Comes.
HE hi trouble comes, don't let despair
Ay* Add to the burden you must bear,
But keep up heart, and, smiling, say—
“ The darkest cloud must pass away."
Don’t say, “ Why is it I" with a frown,
And go with heart and head bowed down,
But lift them both, and let your eyes
Behold the sunshine in the skies.
Doft sit and brood o'er things gone wrong,
But sing a hopeful, helpful song,
Or whistle something light and gay.
And thus drive half your cares away.
Sing of the pleasant things life knows;
Not of the thorns, but of the rose.
Each life kncnvs some joy every day,
Sure as December lends to May.
The man who sings when trouble's here,
From trouble has not much to fear;
Since it will never tarry long
When stout heart meets it with a song.
But brood o'er care, and we can make
This life a burden that will break
The stou test back. But sing, and lo!
The load is lifted. Let it go!
Then don't Jorget when things go wrong
To try the magic of a song.
For cheerful heart and smiling face
Bring sunshine to the shadiest place.

M. Stamboloff. the ex-
Prime Minister of Hul-
garia, has been truly de-
scribed as the man above
all others to whom the
present position of that
country, its freedom and
independence, are due.
At the time of his death
he was about forty years
of age, and till his fall in
June, 1894, he was re-
garded as one of the fore-
most statesmen in Europe.
The autocratic and high-
handed methods which
were alleged against him
made him many enemies,
and in the end brought
about his assassination.
This event took place
in July, 1895. He met

and stay single.”
How to be Strong.
Character Reading.
u C 9--J _
®Y six qualities,” says an old writer, “ may
CirT a fool be known : anger without cause,
speech without profit, change without motive,
inquiry without an object, putting trust in a
stranger, and wanting capacity to discriminate
between a friend and toe.”
The Miser.
Sandow, the “strong man,” says that his first
golden rule is—if you want to be strong, do not
eat too much. Nothing shortens life and mini-
mises power as the almost universal habit of
taking too much food.
The only rule as to how much food should be
taken is that the system should be kept free from
hunger until the usual time for the next meal.
If you wish to be strong, do not drink tea or
coffee, and when the stomach is empty take
nothing but distilled water.
Another point is, never try to economise in
sleep. Sandow says he sleeps nine hours and
often more. You should sleep in a warm bed-
room, and bathe almost as frequently as you eat.
At any rate, you should always have a cold bath
morning and evening.
Sandow says he lias not much faith in gym-
nastics as they are usually taught. His faith is
pinned to dumb-bells, and he does all his training
with them, supplemented with weight lifting.
If you wish to be strong, says Sandow, do not
overstrain yourself; develop your muscles by the
easiest and lightest exercise. By a constant use
of dumb-bells any man of average strength can
bring his muscles to the highest possible develop-
ment.
A H.A R D, do -e man was Solomon Ray,
Nothing of value he gave away ;
He hoarded and saved,
A nd he pinched and shaved,
A nd the more he got the more he craved.
The hard-earned shillings he toiled to gain,
Brought him little hut care and pain ;
For little he spent.
And alt that he lent,
He made it bring him twenty per cent.
This was the life of Solomon Ray,
The years went by, and his hair grew grey ;
His cheeks grew thin.
And his heart within
Crew as hard as the shillings he worked to win.
But he died one day, as all men must,
For life is fleeting and man is dtist:
A nd the heirs were gay
That laid him away ;
And that was the end of Solomon Ray.
They quarrelled now, who but little cared
For Solomon Ray white his life was spared ;
His lands were sold
And his hard-earned gold
All went to the lawyers, I am told.
Vet men ■millpinch, and cheat, and save,
Nor carry their treasures beyond the grave ;
All their gold some day
Will melt away ,
Like the selfish savings of Solomon Ray.
In exercising it is very important to stand cor-
rectly and to breathe properly. The right way
to breathe properly is to take long, full breaths,
and to expel the air slowly. If you breathe
properly, stand as you ought to do, get plenty of
pure air, sufficient, but not too much, wholesome
food, you will be sure to be healthy and strong.
—Eugene J. Hall.

GARDENING FOR
THE
MONTH.
The work to be executed in the flower-garden is
much the same as last month. Tea-roses that
are in exposed situations should be taken up and
placed safely out of the reach of frost. Any
fuchsias that are to remain out all the winter
should have their roots covered with litter or
coal-ashes. In frosty weather sprinkle a little
light litter over any choice things in open beds.
Make plantation of rhubarb, sea-kale, asparagus,
and horserad ish. Sow early peas and beans on dry
warm slopes. A delicate salad may be obtained in
five or six weeks by packing roots of dandelion
in leaf-mould and putting them in gentle heat.
Dig round old fruit-trees. If any trees grow too
luxuriantly to bear well, root-prune them. Con-
tinue, if necessary, to make new drains, to im-
prove water-courses, and to plant hedges. Turn
up the ground thoroughly for exposure to the
frost and snow. Inspect the fruit in the store-
room at frequent and regular intervals and
remove whatever is found to be in a state of
decay.

ASSASSINATION OF THE SHAH OF PERSIA I BRINGING HOME THE BODY.
For All Who Wish to Marry.
ELECT the girl. Agree with the girl's father
~<-fl in politics and with her mother in religion.
If you have a rival, keep an eye on him ; if he is
a widower, keep two eyes on him.
Do not assure the girl that you have no had
habits. It will be enough for you to say that
you never heard yourself snore in your sleep.
Do not put too much sweetstuff on paper. If
you do, you will hear it read in after years, when
your wife has some espial purpose in inflicting
upon you the severest punishment known to a
married man.
Go home at a reasonable hour in the evening.
Do not wait till the girl has to throw her whole
soul into a yawn that she cannot cover with both
hands. A little thing like that may cause a cool-
ness at the very beginning of the game.
If you sit down on some molasses-candy that
little Willie has left on the chair while wearing
your new summer trousers for the first time, smile
sweetly, and remark that you do not mind sitting
on molasses-candy at all, and that “ boys will be
boys.” Reserve your true feelings for future
reference.
Duelling.
.5h _ —;
/EHE duel is a survival of the trial by ordeal.
Rowland Yorke is supposed to have brought
it to England in 1557, but earlier than that it was
not unusual to see a glove hung over the altar in
church, as a challenge to anyone who should take
it down.
The Looking-Glass.
THE world is a looking-glass
Wherein we look all day,
And each one sees reflected there
His own true image, foul or flair,
Sullen, or sad, or gay;
Lit up with love or dark with hate ,
Or cheered by heaven or soured- by flate.
If, on the occasion of your first call, the girl
upon whom you have placed your affections looks
like an iceberg, and acts like a quiet cold wave,
take your leave early, and stay away.
Do not be too soft. Do not say, “ These little
hands shall never do a stroke of work while they
are mine,” and “You shall have nothing to do in
our home but to sit all day long and chirp to the
canaries ” —as if any sensible woman could be
happy fooling away valuable time in that sort of
style ! And a girl has a fine retentive memory for
the soft things and silly promises of courtship,
and occasionally, in after years, when she is
washing the dinner-dishes or patching rfhe worst
end ofyour trousers, she will remind you of them
in a cold sarcastic tone of Voice.
The sweet eyes meet an answering smile ,
The gladflace fronts the sun ;
The mourner nothing sees but shade,
And shivers, lonely and afraid;
The guilty-hearted one
Reads in the glass, without a doubt,
His sin detected andfound out.
The innocent child looks gaily in
With frank andfearless gaze.
And sees a face reflected there
Bright as his own-is fair ;
The old man full rf days,
Peers with his tired eyes and sees
But weariness and vanities.
The world is a looking-glass
Wherein ourselves are shown,
Kindness for kindness, cheer, for cheer.
Coldness Jor gloom, repulse for fear.
To every soul its own;
We cannot change the world a whit,
Only ourselves which look in it.
Susan Coolidgh.

In the case of marriage by banns, if the contracting
parties reside in different parishes, the publication must
be made in the churches of each parish for three con-

elapse after the third time of publication, the banns
become useless, and the parties must either obtain a
licence or submit to the republication of the banns.
Civil Marriages can be performed before a duly licensed
Registrar. Particulars of such can be obtained at all
Registry Offices.

An Old Horsfordian.
By B. LOCKWOOD.
(M|% QRSFORTH cannot boast of being the birth-place
|, of many great men, but several have gone out from
C ) the township and proved themselves worthy of a
honourable place in the history of the nation. America’s
great poet, Longfellow, was descended from an Horsforth
family, who went out to the States a few generations ago.
The name of Longfellow is still represented among the
present inhabitants.
One great and good man, too little known among us
at the present day, stands out pre-eminently as an old
Horsforth worthy. To him the British Empire is greatly
indebted for remarkable foresight, statesmanship, and
sterling ability, exercised m its welfare.
In a former Almanack we gave a faint outline of the
condition of things in our town at the beginning of the
century. Amid such surroundings there grew up a young
man whose thirst for knowledge was intensely keen, and
considerably in advance of his station in life.
A young blacksmith, brought up to that trade in the
town, eventually became a scholar, clergyman,
missionary,—and philanthropist ; the influence of his life
and deeds are world-wide and immortal, in both importance
and extent.
Surely we ought to know something about such a
man, to reverence his name, and endeavour to keep his
memory fragrant and ever green.
Several who have written of this great and good man
—for such he really was—have stated that he was born at
Horsforth.


We should have been glad to have said so, too, but
truth demands that credit should be given to a neighbouring
village. His boyhood and early manhood were, however,
spent at Horsforth. His subsequent life was lived, and
his noble and heroic deeds were done, over the seas. He
became the father of the Australian Church, themioneer
missionary to the cannibals of New Zealand, and The first
to introduce Australian wool into England, and promote
its use in this country.
Samuel Marsden was born at Parsley, in Turner’s
Fold, on July 28th, 1764. The entry of his birth is so
registered in the books of the parish church. Mr.
Marsden’s own account confirms this fact, for he
himself says that when he was ten or eleven years old
he left Parsley, and lived with his uncle, a blacksmith,
at Horsforth.
Here he worked at his uncle’s trade, and it is said of
him, that whilst blowing the bellows with one hand, he
wrote out grammatical declensions on the fireboard of his
forge, with a bit of chalk, in the other hand. He received
the rudiments of education from the Rev. Samuel Stones,
incumbent of Rawdon Church, who was very much
interested in the young man’s welfare, and no doubt gave
impetus to the bent of his inclination.
In the school adjoining Rawdon Church, meetings
were held that went by the name of “ Young Marsden’s
Class Meetings.” Here it was that he lectured, and otherwise
helped his benefactor. There opened out to him oppor-
tunities of receiving further education. He was admitted
into the Free Grammar School of Hull, where the celebrated
ecclesiastical historian, Dr. Joseph Milner (a native of
Pudsey), was the head master. He remained till 1789,
when, through the instrumentality of the Elland Society,
he was sent to St. John’s College, Cambridge, and
maintained there at the expense of the society, with the
distinct object of being prepared for the ministry of the
Church of England.
He had not yet completed his studies, when an offer
was made to him by the Government of a chaplaincy to
the colony of New South Wales. After some hesitancy,


he accepted the appointment, receiving the Royal mandate,
which bore the date, January ist, 1793.
He was then ordained by the Archbishop of York, and
immediately prepared to take up his life’s work. On the
2ist April he was united in marriage to Miss Elizabeth
Tristan, who for thirty years made him an excellent wife.
During the time he and his wife remained at Hull,
waiting for the sailing of the transport-ship, Mr. Marsden
was frequently invited to officiate in various churches.
On one of these occasions, on the morning of Sunday,
August 28th, 1793, as he waS just about to enter the pulpit,
the signal gun from his ship was heard. The summons
was imperative, it was impossible for him to preach, so,
along with his wife, he left the church immediately; but
the service so abruptly left was not continued, as the whole
congregation followed them to the shore. Then, as they
left in the boat, he gave the assembled company his parting
benediction, and they, in return, followed him with their
prayers and farewells. As he joined the ship, and
commenced the voyage, there came to him with full force
the great change he was making, and the difficult
undertaking he had accepted. The day was Sunday, but,
as he records in his journal, “ How different this Sabbath
to what I have been accustomed!” In place of the
fellowship of warm-hearted Christians, his new associates
were felons, and they of the worst type. Instead of
hearing prayer and praise on this Sabbath, there fell on his
ears nothing but oaths and blasphemies.
As the voyage proceeded, his request to conduct
Divine Service was refused ; but ere the journey’s end was
reached, he had obtained consent, and preached to the ship’s
company. , . ’ .
After a long and weary voyage, he arrived at his
destination, and took up his residence at Paramatta, a few
miles from Port Jackson.
New South Wales had been fixed upon by the
Government as a suitable place for a penal settlement.
Mr. Marsden was the second chaplain appointed to the
colony.
He began his career amid the deepest depths of
immorality and vice, and in face of extreme difficulties,


which were not lessened, but rather increased. Only a
stout, brave heart would have taken up so unpromising
and uncongenial a task ; and only a hero of the truest and
noblest kind would have continued to battle with the
difficulties, trials, and dangers that beset him on every
hand. In a very short time the senior chaplain gave up
his work, and left Mr. Marsden to struggle on with the
sole charge. He had to officiate single-handed at the
three settlements of Sydney, Paramatta, and Hawksbury.
In addition to this, he was appointed a magistrate
soon after his arrival. Mr. Marsden was a man that did
nothing by halves. Whatever he undertook he faithfully
and fearlessly endeavoured to carry out. He sought
always to administer justice even-handed, but many of his
brother magistrates were not so equally disposed. Again
and again he came into conflict with them in the
administration of justice. Occasionally he disagreed with
the governor also —especially so was this the case in the
early part of his residence in New South Wales.
When he arrived, in 1794, the colony was only six
years old, —hence the cultivation of land was but just
commenced. The colonists had to depend upon supplies
of food from the home country.
The governors did their best to get the land cleared
and brought under cultivation. To promote this, they
gave grants of one hundred acres to each officer, both
military and civil. Mr. Marsden availed himself of this
I privilege, and as land could be obtained on very easy
I terms, he added to the original grant. In a very short time
■ he had an estate of several hundred acres. Upon the
‘ cultivation of this estate, he brought to bear all the energy
and foresight which was so peculiar to the man, for which
many have sought to malign his character, putting down
J to greed what was due to other, and decidedly pure and
philanthropic, motives.
From the wild state of nature there sprang the “model
farm of Sydney,” which prospered greatly under his
fostering care and management. From this source, in
after years, though left to the care of his wife and servants,
large sums of money were realized, which were generously


devoted to Mr. Marsden’s many missionary enterprises,
and other benevolent purposes.
Monsieur Perron, a French commander, visited
Mr. Marsden’s farm in 1802, and records, “ No longer than
eight years ago the whole of this spot was covered wdth
immense and useless forests : what pains, what exertions,
must have been employed ! These roads, these flocks, the
work of eight years.” He adds of the owner, “ While he
thus laboured in his various important avocations, he was
not unmindful of the interests of others. He generously
interfered on behalf of the poorer settlers in their distresses,
established schools for the children, and often relieved their
necessities; and to the unhappy culprits, whom the justice
of their offended country had banished from their native
soil, he administered alternately exhortation and comfort.”
By this time, the whole energy and force of his noble
character was exerted at constant high pressure for the
well-being —social, moral, and spiritual—of the entire
community over which he began 1o manifest so great an
influence. His advice was sought by successive governors
on matters of difficulty and importance far beyond the
responsibility of his own official position. The London
Missionary Society also sought his counsel respecting their
mission to the South Sea Islanders, which was conscientiously
given by him in a lengthy document of seventeen folio
pages.
The colony grew, and as its numbers increased, its
wickedness and immorality also increased. Even the
judicature was greatly debased. Indeed, a general crisis
seemed to be close at hand. Mr. Marsden foresaw that the
intervention of the Home Government was needed. He
sought for, and obtained, permission to visit England.
After an absence of fourteen years he returned home.
He brought with him the first Australian wool, in
barrels, and arrived with it in London and Leeds in 1808.
It was seen by Mr. William Thompson, of Rawdon, and
by him manufactured into cloth. Mr. Marsden had some
of the cloth made up into a suit of clothes. Wearing this
suit, he was introduced to His Majesty, George HI. The
King was so pleased with the result that an order was given


fora supply of the same cloth to be, sent on to London,
from which similar garments were made for His Majesty.
Through Sir Joseph Banks, a request was made by
Mr. Marsden for a couple of Spanish Merino sheep from
His Majesty’s farm, to improve the breed of the Australian
stock. His Majesty gave him five were in
due time conveyed to, and became a valued acquisition in,
the colony.
The wool trade of Sydney dates from iBn, the year
after Mr. Marsden s return. The enormous success which
has attended this particular branch of Australian trade is
an everlasting monument to the ability and foresight of
this once obscure Horsfordian. The annual value of the
exports of Australian wool has reached no less a sum than
twenty-four millions sterling.
While in England, Mr. Marsden’s opinion and advice
relating to the condition and management of the colony
was eagerly solicited by the Government. He freely laid
before the Government and others his views and schemes
for the welfare of Australia, and also for the conversion of
the cannibals of New Zealand and the South Sea Islands.
Important steps were taken during this visit, which
have had material influence in advancing the successful j
development and progress of Australia. Indeed, it may be
said that the foundations of success were laid during
Mr. Marsden’s two years’ stay in England.
In August, 1809, he left his native land for the last
time, with some degree of depression, but still conscious of
having succeeded in his mission far beyond his expectations,
and determined to go forward with hope.
On the voyage back to Australia he came across a
New Zealand by name,—who had,
through a spirit of adventure, embarked on board a ship
which had been coasting the shores of New Zealand.
This chief, through a series of misfortunes inflicted upon
him by Europeans, had been made to suffer great hardships,
and was, when Mr. Marsden saw him, wretched, miserable,
and ill. By kindness, the man was restored in health and
spirits, Mr. Marsden took him into his own house, on
their arrival in Sydney, and for six months taught him
oj Am. iys


agriculture. Then he desired to return to New Zealand,
and so embarked for that purpose.
The idea of converting the cannibals of New Zealand
was a cherished desire of Mr. Marsden. The project could
not be started immediately on his return. A ship, called
the Boyd , had been seized by the natives of New Zealand,
and all on board—seventy in number—were killed and
eaten. The governor would not allow Mr. Marsden to go
there. But the noble man was not to be driven from his
purpose entirely. He bought a ship with his own money,
and sent the lay missionaries, who had come out with him
from England, on a visit to the island. The instructions
he gave them were to convey a message to"suaterra, and
try to induce him, with others, to pay a visit to Mr. Marsden,
at Paramatta, hoping by this means to find a way to
introduce the Gospel and civilization to their benighted
land. had reached New Zealand, but not before
he had again suffered many hardships through the perfidy
of Europeans. He was there, however, to welcome the
missionaries, and so to secure for them protection from
harm. When suaterra left Australia, Mr. Marsden gave
him a supply of wheat. On his return to his native
country, he had this wheat sown. Simple as this sounds
in our ears, no such thing had before occurred in that land.
Great was the wonder of the savages when it began to
grow and ripen. And great also was their astonishment
as told them of the bread which the Europeans
made from it. Unfortunately, there was no mill to grind
the corn when it was thrashed, and all Ruaterra’s efforts in
that direction proved unavailing. The missionary ship
brought such an article, so that when the corn was ground,
and cakes were baked from it, the astonishment of the
natives was unbounded. They shouted and danced for
joy. It had this effect, too : words were
believed, as he told them the missionaries were good men,
and sought their welfare. Eventually, he and six other
chiefs agreed to go to Sydney in the Active. The return
voyage was made, and Australia reached on August 22nd,
1814. For a time, the New Zealanders resided with
Mr. Marsden, at Paramatta.
On November 19th, 1814, Mr. Marsden, with the


eight New Zealanders and others, embarked in the Active,
for the purpose of starting the mission among the cannibals.
In December he dropped anchor, and communicated with
the people on the shore. A war had for some time been
raging between two of the tribes.
Mr. Marsden felt it to be his first duty to establish
peace among these people—a most delicate and peculiar
task, but in this he entirely succeeded. Not only had he
ventured ashore, but he and another friend—Mr. Nicholas
actually passed the night with the very savages who had
killed and eaten their countrymen a short time ago. We
will allow Mr. Marsden to describe this memorable event
in his own words : “ As the evening advanced, the people
began to retire to rest in different groups. About eleven
o clock, Mr. Nicholas and I wrapped ourselves in our great
coats, and prepared for rest also. George, the chief of
Wangaroa, directed me to lie by his side. His wife and
child lay on the right-hand, and Mr. Nicholas close
by. The night was dear ; the stars shone bright, and the
sea in our front was smooth ; around us were innumerable
spears, stuck upright in the ground, and groups of natives
lying in all directions, like a flock of sheep upon the grass,
as there were neither tents nor huts to cover them. I
viewed our present situation with feelings that I cannot
describe ; surrounded by cannibals who had massacred and
devoured our countrymen. I did not sleep much during
the night. About three o’clock in the morning, I rose and
walked about the camp, surveying the different groups of
natives. When the morning light returned, we beheld
men, women, and children asleep in all directions, like the
beasts of the field I had ordered the boat to
come on shore for us at daylight.”
Having invited the chiefs to breakfast on board the
Active, where he made them some presents, he had the
satisfaction of seeing them shake hands, and salute one
another by rubbing their noses together by way of showing
reconciliation. Thus peace was restored.
The next place visited was the Bay of Islands, the
principal harbour of the northern part of the island, and
the home of “Ouaterra. Here it was desired to fix a
mission station. On Sunday —\Christmas Day—Mr. Marsden
\ idlA-


had the great delight of preaching the Gospel for the
first time in New Zealand, from the text, Luke 11., row.,
“Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy.”
The confidence of the natives was thoroughly gained,
and arrangements for the future development and extension
of the Mission were agreed upon.
But the Mission did not uninterruptedly acquire success.
It had manv vicissitudes. The first discouragement was the
early death of who had proved himself a most
noble specimen of humanity in its savage state. Then
followed other trials—fresh wars broke out; but, never-
theless, the missionaries remained at their posts.
In 1819, Mr. Marsden made his second voyage to
New Zealand, and succeeded in consolidating and extending
the Mission.
Then, again, in the following year, February, 1820, at
the request of the governor, he went a third time. On
this occasion he made a most remarkable journey inland,
visiting tribe after tribe, making new acquaintances
continually, everywhere receiving great kindness from the
natives, and such hospitality as they were able to give ; but
literally living for weeks a savage life, surrounded only by
cannibals, and tasting the realities which they had to
endure. Ihe object of this visit being accomplished, he
returned to Sydney, only to pass through trials of another
nature. Governor Macquarie had brought heavy charges
against him to the Home Government. Lord Bathurst
sent out a commissioner to investigate the truth of these
allegations. The result of the investigation exonerated
Mr. Marsden from any blame whatever ; and the Home
Government ordered his stipend to be increased to
per annum, “in consideration of his long and useful
services m the colony of New South Wales.”
The new governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, who arrived
in 1821, gave him assurances of countenance and support.
Such encouragement was peculiarly opportune. He
thanked God, and took courage.
In July, 1823, Mr. Marsden again embarked for New
Zealand. During his absence, the warlike and turbulent
spirit of the natives had manifested itself in a violent form.
They had demanded from the missionaries firearms and


powder, in payment for their services. To adjust these
and other difficulties required all the astuteness, firmness,
and sagacity which this man of God possessed.
On the return voyage, he was subject to shipwreck.
The vessel was lost, but all on board were eventually saved.
At length he returned home, accompanied by six New
Zealand youths.
Two years elapsed, and he prepared again to visit
New Zealand. The Wesleyan missionary premises had
been destroyed, and the lives of the missionaries were in
danger, so that the work for a time had had to be suspended.
Mr. Marsden accordingly sailed in H.M.S. Rainbow , and
arrived in the Bay of Islands, April sth, 1827. He found
an improvement in the state of affairs, and danger for
the time was removed. He gave counsel to the missionaries,
and reasoned with the chiefs. In five days he was on his
way back to Sydney.
Increasing years did not quench his active interest in
the missionary cause. The year 1830 found him on board
ship bound for New Zealand ; and, when he arrived there,
a great battle had been fought, in which 1,400 natives had
been engaged. Not an hour was to be lost. He and
one of the missionaries, Mr. Williams, the very next
morning, went to the scene of action. Mr. Marsden felt no
alarm amongst these infuriated savages, and surely enough ’
he was regarded by them with the utmost confidence and
respect. He and Mr. Williams reasoned with both sides, |
j and, after a whole day’s deliberation, —in spite of great, ■
| warlike demonstrations, —they succeeded in restoring peace.
! At night-fall, at the close of a long oration, the great chief :
I on one side clave a stick in two to signify that his anger
* was broken ; and then followed a hideous war-dance, in
■ which both sides joined.
In 1835 there came to him a severe trial. His dear
partner —as he called his wife—died. She had been to
him a trusted helper, and her decease led him to think that
his last conflict also was near at hand.
With stooping gait, failing eyesight, and decaying 1
memory, he entered upon his seventy-second year, and
calmly and serenely awaited the summons, which, he felt,
must soon close his laborious life. He continued, however,


to visit the sick, and otherwise maintain his pastoral office.
Yet, on February gth, 1837, he sailed again for New
Zealand, this time accompanied by his youngest daughter.
He landed in the southern part of the island, and there stayed
at the Wesleyan missionary station for about a fortnight.
He then crossed overland to the Bay of Islands, being carried
all the way on a litter by natives ; and, in this manner he
visited many other missionary stations.
Wherever he went he was regarded as the friend and
father of the New Zealanders. One chieftain sat down on
the ground, gazing on him in silence for a long time, and
when gently reproved for his apparent rudeness, he said,
“ Lei me alone ; let me take a last look, I shall never see
him again.” This was by no means an isolated case.
At one place Mr. Marsden held a constant levee. As
many as a thousand Maoris presented themselves, some
coming a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles, content if
they could but sit and gaze upon him, ere he departed. Then,
when the time came for him to embark, they carried him
to the ship, a distance of six miles. Such was the
veneration which this grand old servant of God had
awakened in the hearts of these once degraded savages.
On the arrival of H.M.S. Rattlesnake, he joined the
ship, and, after visiting other parts of the island, he
returned to Sydney, arriving there 27th July, having been
away five months.
As an illustration of Mr. Marsden’s courage and
fearlessness, notwithstanding the mental and physical
infirmities of old age, we relate the following : After the
return from his last voyage to New Zealand,.he was one
day driving in the bush, accompanied by his youngest
daughter, when the conveyance was stopped by two noted
bushrangers, part of a gang who had been the terror of
the whole country for two years. With loaded pistols,
they threatened to shoot Mr. Marsden and his daughter if
they said a word, and ordered the daughter to turn out the
contents of her father’s pockets into their hands.
The grand old man, undismayed, remonstrated with
them about their evil career, and warned them of its
consequences. He plainly told them that it would lead
them to the gallows, and that he had no doubt he should


see them there. Strange to say, this was realised to the
letter, in a very short space of time. For other
outrages, these two ruffians were arrested, and condemned
to death. Mr. Marsden, in the capacity of chaplain,
followed them from the cell to the place of execution.
On luesday, Bth May, 1838, he set out in his gig on a
journey of twenty-five miles. Arriving at the house of his
friend, Rev. Mr. Styles, the chaplain of Windsor parish, he
complained of illness, the cold having suddenly affected j
him while driving.
Erysipelas in the head supervened, and a general
stupor followed. On Saturday morning, 12th May, the
inflammation reached the brain—-his spirit was released,
and he entered into rest. Having spent a laborious life, he
died in harness. Like his Great Master, he went about
doing good.
He was buried in his own churchyard of Paramatta,
in the presence of a great company.
Australia at last fully appreciated his worth, and, with
a grand, spontaneous effort, subscribed wherewith
j to raise a monument to his memory. It was ultimately 1
agreed to build a church, on land which Mr. Marsden had :
j devised for that purpose.
A tablet was placed in his church at Paramatta, by a j
New Zealand missionary and his native converts.
On the centenary of Mr. Marsden’s birth, a granite
obelisk was erected in the churchyard at Parsley, and
stained-glass windows were also put in the church, the
whole of the windows of the chancel being filled to
; perpetuate his memory.
His greatest monument, however, is to be seen in the j
; wonderful success that has resulted from those schemes I
I and projects which he founded and fostered.
He was truly a man raised up and endowed by God
for his life’s work, and was peculiarly faithful in the
discharge of his duty.
His firmness to the principle of righteousness, his
: inflexible integrity, his utter unselfishness, his devotion to
his Church, and his catholicity of brotherliness, strongly
; marked him out as a good and great man, whose example
and influence is indeed equally great and powerful.

The Cup of Balm Tea.
Nearly a century ago there appeared in the “ Poets’ Corner ” of
the Leeds Intelligencer, a number of poems from the pen of a noteworthy
Horsfordian schoolmaster. The author, James Whitaker, was a man
of considerable literary ability. Many people who to-day hold
honourable positions in society were amongst his pupils, and there is
no doubt a goodly circle will be particularly interested in the
reproduction of one of his poems.
IN boyhood I’ve oft heard my mother declare,
No herb in the garden with balm could compare ;
The leaves of our rose-tree might with’ring lie,
But the balm was suspended in bunches to dry :
Enveloped in paper-bag, hung to a peg,
It rarely came down but when friends came to beg ;
And then would my mother attest with great glee,
No doctor could vie with a cup of balm tea.
Methinks I now hear that dear mother’s tone,
Ere time broke the link that bound me to home ;
When ill, she would take me on to her knee,
And quickly prepare the restorative tea :
The lire was stirr’d, the kettle soon boil’d—
I cried like a child that was petted and spoil’d ;
I had but one sister, and she had but me,
And, oh, the wry faces we set at balm tea !
The spoonful of sugar she held in her hand,
Or pot of preserves on the tables would stand, —
These sweeten’d the bitter that lingered behind,
And dried up the tears and composed the vex’d mind.
Her pocket uninjured by surgical fee,
No wonder she praised the cup of balm tea.

The Cup of Balm Tea. —Continued
The son of the palace falls sick, and is ill,
No matter how slight, esculapean skill
Is prompt to attend, with the powder or pill ;
The newspapers catch the disastrous tale,
And, real or pretended, in dolorous wail
Transmit the sad tidings o’er mountain and vale ;
Alas! my old mother is deaf and can’t see,
Else I know what would cure. “ What ? ” A cup of
balm tea !
There’s hyssop and camomile, horehound and sage,
As performers of cures they still keep the stage,
And a hundred more in the herbalist's page ;
But ask my old mother, from prejudice free,
Which of all, when you’re ill, will make the best tea.
Though the current of time has worn in her brow,
The wrinkles of age, and its ceaseless flow,
Her flaxen hair washed as white as the snow, —
Though shrivell’d and shrunk like an aged tree,
Still green is the branch of her memory,—
And, with falt’ring tongue, she’ll descant of its worth,
Unrivail’d by plant or in ocean or earth ;
And still to the balk she’ll uplift her dim ee,
And say, with the learned “ Experience tells me,
If there is such a thing as they call panacea —
’Tis the herb which supplies the cup of balm tea.”
WHAT MACHINERY HAS DONE.
The following statements, compiled by a person who
has given the subject a great deal of thought, show how
great has been the effect of labour-saving machinery
One man and two boys do the work which it required
1,100 spinners to do but a small number of years ago.
One man does the work now of fifty weavers who
were required at the time of his grandfather.
Cotton printing machines have replaced 1,500 per cent,
of hand labour.
One machine with one man as attendant manufactures
as many horseshoes in one day as it would take 500 men
to make in the same time.

Jn JHemoriam .
A TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF
late ©ljoxntUnt,
Musician and Composer, of Horsforth, who died October 30th, 1896, in his 72nd year.
Many of his tunes have been sung far and wide, but “ Woodside,” set to the words.
“ Rock of Ages,” has been most popular. Throughout England, across the Atlantic
and even in the Colonies, it has become a favourite.
By JOHN G. MARSHALL,
Sleep, brother, sleep. The “ Rock of Ages ”
Now is cleft for thee ;
And with the kindred spirits blest
Whom thou to us didst manifest,
Rest peacefully.
The immortal spirit of the poet
Didst with thine own conspire.
Until to thee those hallowed words
Echoed the soul-inspiring chords
Of a celestial choir.
What influence interpreted
Thou didst to us impart
Is justly destined now to be
A living monument to thee,
In Music’s choicest art.
God saw from the beginning
The work that thou should’st do
And He will honour every man
Who strives to carry out His plan
In what he doth pursue.
And thou with patient care didst strive
To teach us all, in part,
The mysteries of Music’s measure,
And enchance in us the pleasure
Of that exhaustless art.
For thou would’st only have us know
The noblest works of those
Whom God inspired, and in whose themes
The most sublime, enchancing dreams,
Into creation rose.
Henceforth in us thy works will be
Cherished with deep regard,
And labour unto us unknown
Thy all-discerning God will own
And suitably reward.
Thy spirit, in the courts of Heaven,
A love-song now doth raise,
Which is in perfect harmony
With that angelic company,
Whose every breath is praise.

The New Church Organ.
By Will Carleton.
They’ve got a brand-new organ, Sue,
For all their fuss and search,
They’ve done just as they said they’d do,
And fetched it into church.
They’re bound the crittur shall be seen,
And on the preacher’s right
They’ve hoisted up their new machine
In everybody’s sight.
They’ve got a chorister and choir,
Ag’in’ my voice and vote ;
For it was never my desire
To praise the lord by note !
I’ve been a sister good an’ true
For five-an’-thirty year;
I’ve done what seemed my part to do,
An’ prayed my duty clear ;
I’ve sung the hymns both slow and quick
Just as the preacher read,
And twice, when Deacon Tubbs was sick
I took the fork an’ led !
And now their bold, new-fangled ways
Is cornin’ all about;
And I, right in my latter days,
Am fairly crowded out!
To-day the preacher, good old dear,
With tears all in his eyes,
Read “ I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies.”
I al’ays liked that blessed hymn—
I s’pose I al’ays will ;
It somehow gratifies my whim,
In good old Ortonville ;
But when that choir got up to sing,
I couldn’t catch a word ;
They sung the most dog-gondest thing
A body ever heard !

C. HAWKSHAW, Leeds Bridge, Leeds,


Some worldly chaps was standin’ near ;
An’ when I see them grin,
I bid farewell to every fear,
And boldly waded in.
I thought I’d chase their tune along,
An’ tried with all my might ;
But though my voice is good an’ strong
I couldn’t steer it right;
When they were high, then I was low,
An’ also contra wise ;
An’ I too fast, or they too slow,
To “mansions in the skies.”
An’ after every verse, you know,
They play a little tune ;
I didn’t understand, an’ so
I started in too soon.
I pitched it pretty middlin’ high,
I fetched a lusty tone,
But oh, alas! I found that I
Was singin’ there alone !
They laughed a little, I am told ;
But I had done my best;
And not a wave of trouble rolled
Across my peaceful breast.
And Sister Brown—l could but look—
She sits right front of me ;
She never was no singin’-book,
An’ never went to be ;
But then she al’ays tried to do
The best she could, she said ;
She understood the time right through,
An’ kep’ it with her head ;
But when she tried this mornin’, oh,
I had to laugh, or cough !
It kep’ her head a-bobbin’ so,
It e’en a’most came off!

An’ Deacon Tubbs —he all broke down,
As one might well suppose ;
He took one look at Sister Brown,
And meekly scratched his nose.
He looked his hymn-book through and through
And laid it on the seat,
And then a pensive sigh he drew,
And looked completely beat.
x\nd when they took another bout,
He didn’t even rise ;
But drawed his red bandanner out,
An’ wiped his weepin’ eyes.
I’ve been a sister good an’ true,

I’ve done what seemed my part to do,
An’ prayed my duty clear ;
But death will stop my voice, I know,
For he is on my track ;
And some day I to church will go,
And never more come back ;
And when the folks get up to sing—
Whene’er that time shall be—
I do not want no patent thing
A-squealin’ over me !

The Shadow on the Blind
ALAS! what errors are sometimes committed,
What blunders are made, what duties omitted,
What scandals arise, what mischief is wrought,
Through want of a moment’s reflection and thought.
How many a fair reputation has flown
Through some stab in the dark from a person unknown ;
Or some tale spread abroad with assiduous care,
When the story the strictest inspection would bear !
How often rage, malice, and envy are found ;
How often contention and hatred abound
Where true love should exist, and harmony dwell,
Through a misunderstanding, alas ! who can tell ?
Mr, Ferdinand Plum was a grocer by trade,
By attention and tact he a fortune had made ;
No tattler nor maker of mischief was he,
But as honest a man as you’d e’er wish to see.
Of a chapel, close by, he was deacon, they say,
And his minister lived just over the way.
Mr. Plum was retiring to rest one night,
He had just undress’d, and put out the light,
And pull’d back the blind,
As he peep’d from behind
(’Tis a custom with many to do so, you’ll find),
When, glancing his eye,
He happen’d to spy
On the blinds of the opposite side —oh, fie !
Two shadows; each movement, of course, he could see,
And the people were quarrelling evidently.
“Well, I never,” said Plum, as he witness’d the strife,
" I declare 'tis the minister beating his wife! ”
The minister held a thick stick in his hand,
And his wife ran away as he shook the brand,
Whilst her shrieks and cries were quite shocking to hear,
And the sounds came across most remarkably clear.
“ Well, things are deceiving,
But—‘ seeing’s believing,’ ”
Said Plum to himself, as he turn’d into bed ;
“ Now, who would have thought
That man would have fought
And beaten his wife on her shoulders and head
With a great big stick,
At least three inches thick ?
I am sure her shrieks quite fill'd me with dread

THE SHADOW ON THE BLlND.—Continued.
I’ve a great mind to bring
The whole of the thing
Before the church members ; but, no, I have read
A proverb which says ‘ Least said, soonest mended.’ ’
And thus Mr. Plum’s mild soliloquy ended.
But, alas ! Mr. Plum's eldest daughter, Miss Jane,
Saw the whole of the scene, and could not refrain
From telling Miss Spot, and Miss Spot told again
(Though of course in strict confidence) every one
Whom she happened to know, what the parson had done
So the news spread abroad, and soon reached the ear
Of the parson himself, and he traced it, I hear,
To the author, Miss Jane. Jane could not deny,
But at the same time she begg’d leave to defy
The parson to prove she had utter’d a lie.
A church meeting was called: Mr. Plum made a speech.
He said. “ Friends, pray listen awhile, I beseech.
What my daughter has said is most certainly true,
For I saw the whole scene on the same evening, too;
But, not wishing to make an unpleasantness rife,
I did not tell either my daughter or wife.
But of course as Miss Jane saw the the whole of the act,
I think it but right to attest to the fact."
“ ’Tis remarkably strange !” the parson replied :
“ It is plain Mr. Plum must something have spied ;
Though the wife-beating story of course is denied ;
And in that I can say I am grossly belied.”
While he ransacks his brain, and ponders, and tries
To recall any scene that could ever give rise
To so monstrous a charge, just then his wife cries,
“ I have if, my love; you remember that night
When I had such a horrible, terrible fright.
We both were retiring that evening to rest—■
1 was seated, my dear, and but partly undress’d—
When a nasty large rat jumpt’d close to my feet;
My shrieking was heard, I suppose, in the street ;
You caught up the poker, and ran round the room,
And at last knocked the rat, and so seal'd its doom.
Our shadows, my love, must have played on the blind ;
And this is the mystery solv’d you will find.’’
Moral.
Don’t believe every tale that is handed about;
We have all enough faults and real failings, without
Being burdened with those of which there’s a doubt.
If you study this tale, I think, too, you will find
That a light should be placed in the front, not behind
For often strange shadows are seen on the blind.

6 THE
BLOOD PURIFIER.
THOMPSON’S
Burdock Pills.
Pure Blood means Health and Life.
■ Impure Blood means Disease and Death.
. BURDOCK PILLS are a COMMON-SENSE REMEDY—
They act on the blood. The blood is the stream of life, traversing every part of the
human body ; and eruptions, pimples, sores, pains in the back, loss of appetite,
feeling of lassitude, gout, rheumatism and sundry other ailments proceed from
impurities of the blood. BURDOCK PILLS will soon purify the foulest blood, and
2 restore to perfect health.
■ BURDOCK PILLS are a simple remedy—
Tire old adage says—“A stitch in time saves nine.” Many a long and trying illness
might have been avoided had the blood been kept pure with BURDOCK PILLS- There
is no need to take a lot of nauseous physic. The simple use of these Pills is all-
sufficient. They act for themselves—simple and safe—they quickly cure Indigestion,
Wind in the Stomach, Bilious and Liver Complaints, Kidney Affections, Headache and
3 the more complicated cases mentioned below.
■ BURDOCK PILLS ARE a SURE REMEDY-
The peculiar properties of the herb BURDOCK are well-known. For centuries the
Extract of Burdock has been acknowledged by Doctors and Herbalists as the best of
all blood purifiers. In whatever form impurity of the blood shows itself Burdock
4 PILLS will soon effect a cure. If You Take Burdock Pills You MUST Get Better.
■ BURDOCK PILLS are a family remedy—
And as such should always be kept at hand. Husband and wife, sons and daughters,
aunts, uncles, cousins and all kind friends will be benefitted by their use. Every
mother should carry a box in her pocket. They are invaluable for every day com-
plaints. If you don’t feel well—the blood is wrong—take a BURDOCK PILL, you
5 will soon be right again, and may avoid an illness and a doctor’s bill.
■ BURDOCK PILLS will curb OBSTINATE CASES—
Time after time it has been known that BURDOCK PILLS have succeeded where
clever doctors have failed in long standing cases of disease. TRY THEM PER-
SISTENTLY for Scrofula, Eczema, Rheumatism and Gout, Sores in the head, legs or
body, for Diabetes, King’s Evil, Dropsy, Jaundice, Eruptions, Fits and Fevers.
6 Marvellous cures have been effected, don’t give up till you are cured.
■ BURDOCK PILLS are the very pills for ladies -
Every woman knows how necessary it is for her to keep the blood i» good order. If
the blood be impure the complexion becomes pale, and pimples and ugly eruptions
will disfigure the features. BURDOCK PILLS will soon put this right. They also
correct all Irregularities and at once relieve Fatigue, Palpitations, Lowness of Spirits,
Headache and Dizziness, restoring health of mind and body.
THOMPSON’S BURDOCK PILLS are protected with a GOVERN-
MENT STAMP with the name—JOHN THOMPSON—
affixed. SEE THE NAME. Don’t take a Substitute.

YOUR ATTENTION IS CALLED
TO THE FACT THAT
As an Effectual General Family Medicine,
without Mercury,
DR. SCOTT’S PILLS
ARE UNEQUALLED,
Being as Mild and Tonic in their action as they are certain in their curative
Ailments
effects of the following /
in both sexes or Children 1
BILIOUS and LIVER COM-
DYSPEPSIA, HEARTBURN
LOWNESS OF SPIRITS,
GIDDINESS,

IRRITABILITY, LASSITUDE,
LOSS OF APPETITE,
DIZZINESS OF THE
EYES,
HABITUAL COSTIVENESS,
PILES,
And all those other Symptoms wh
'ch none but a Sufferer can describe.
They can be taken at any time, without restraint from business or pleasure - hence
they are a most valuable Domestic Medicine. Heads of households should always have
a box of these Pills by them, to resort to on any slight occasion of ailing on the part
of those under their charge, as by paying attention to the regular action of the Stomach,
Liver and Bowels, many a severe illness is avoided or mitigated. They will be found
in slight cases by a single dose to restore health to the body with a happy frame of mind.
Mrs. Kelly writes :
“Chelsea Lea, Sefton Road, Walton, Liverpool, June arst, 1895.
“ Dear Sir, —I was looking over To-Day and saw a testimonial about Dk. Scott's
Pills. My dear uncle is in his 100th year and in possession of all his faculties, and
really ails from sheer old age only, and still likes to do a little in his garden, of which
he is most proud. He recommended them to me many years ago, and we find them
very excellent; he himself has used them ONLY for over 60 YEARS, and 1 believe for
over 50 years never had a doctor.”
THE GENUINE ARE IN A SQUARE GREEN PACKET.
Do not be persuaded by anyone to buy any other Medicine instead.

Sir, — I have taken WORK from the
first, and not a week passes without my
finding something in it to my advantage.
Although my business is one quite free
from mechanical tools, yet, by the assist-
ance of WORK, the use of such tools has
become part and parcel of my daily labour.
We hear of “ encyclopaedias of useful in-
formation” which cost pounds, but here is
one which, though it cost only a penny, is
worth a guinea a number.

paper for the industrious that was ever
printed. No industrious man need be out

AGENT For
ALL THE BEST KINDS OF TEAS,
SO MUCH ADVERTISED
J. J. respectfully requests the careful perusal of the following
CONCERNING TEA.
It is customary with tea dealers to belaud all teas sold by
them, as being immeasurably superior to any other teas. The
absurdity of this claim—being made by so many—must strike the public ;
therefore we propose leaving the merits of our teas to be judged by our
customers. In asking a trial, we will simply say, that we have special
knowledge of the article, and the technicalities of blending; we have
made a careful analysis of the local water, and, in buying, most rigorously
exclude all but perfect liquoring teas. Our teas from Is. to Is. 8d per
pound are not the “finest teas the world produces.” We give the public
credit for more sense than to believe such statements, in face of the fact
that from Is. Bd. to 35., and even 45., are daily paid in Mincing Lane for
choice to finest parcels. What we claim is, that these teas are good,
sound teas, fit for any table, and at least equal value to any teas
offering. If you are a connoisseur, and want something exceptionally
choice, we sell choice to finest procurable teas from Is. 6d. to 3s. 6d.
per pound.
DELIVERED FREE TO ANY ADDRESS.
