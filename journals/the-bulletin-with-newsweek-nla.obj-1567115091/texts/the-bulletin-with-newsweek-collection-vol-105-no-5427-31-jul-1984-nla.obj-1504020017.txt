Rival 4 cylinder two litre engine at 2500 rpm.
A martini may be improved by being
shaken. But drivers and passengers
seldom are.
BMW insists on using six cylinders in
engines of 2 litres and over. But most
other luxury car makers still persist with
four or five cylinders, despite the laws of
physics which decree that engines of
less than six cylinders can never be
perfectly balanced.
A four cylinder engine will have up to
10 times more vibration than a six
cylinder engine. And a four cylinder car
engine can transmit three times more
vibrations to the passenger compartment
In a BMW however, you will feel
fewer vibrations than if you were sitting
in an eight cylinder car.
To improve this smoothness even
further, each cylinder has its own
counterweight. Some other cars only
have one counterweight to balance
several cylinders.
When you drive the BMW 323 i for
example, you will be surprised at the
uncanny quiet but effortless acceler-
ation of its electronically fuel injected six.
And when you fill up with petrol you
will be pleasantly surprised at how
economical six cylinders can be, when
combined with energy-saving computer
electronics like a fuel cut-off system.
BMW believes that, if you are to
build the most sophisticated and refined
car in the world, the last place for
compromise is the engine. And if other
manufacturers are prepared to com-
promise on this the most important part
of the car, where will they stop 7

Behind the scenes all is calm effi-

From international star gazing to a
little mood music, grand occasions

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Filipino responsibility
As a Third World country, the Philip-
pines has many problems but anyone
envisioning a Philippines “wracked by
violent revolution and bloody civil
war,” as Father Brian Gore does in the
article by Bruce Stannard (B, July 10), is
talking through his hat.
Father Gore is entitled to his opinion
but I am afraid he sounds like the pro-
verbial boy who cried wolf once too
often. There is, after all, restiveness, un-
rest and demonstration in contempor-
ary society everywhere.
In speaking of “land-grabbing,”
Father Gore says that he and Father
Niall O’Brien were working with small
farmers “who had fled the haciendas
into the mountains, cleared small bits of
land which was now in danger of being
taken away from them because they had
no legal status. If they had been work-
ing a good piece of land, there was al-
ways the danger of some rich person ap-
plying to the Bureau of Lands for title
and coming up with a fait accompli .. .”
Mountains in my country, as in Aus-
tralia, are part of the forest land reserve
and not classified as agricultural lands,
to prevent erosion of the soil around
them. They are not allowed to be
cleared and tilled for farming and any-
one doing so is a squatter and would be
violating the law. They cannot be
alienated or titled under our Torrens
Title system.
We are in fact striving to improve the
lot of the common man through various
programs such as land reform, housing,
electrification and self-help livelihood
programs such as Sariling Sikap and the
KKK.
Our land reform program, begun in
1972 under President Marcos, has been
commended by foreign experts such as
FAO Adviser Dr Hans Maliczek, who
notes that the Philippines has been able
to implement land reform without any
social upheaval, and Professor William
Thiesenshussen, the University of Wis-
consin’s Land Tenure Centre Director,
who says that our program is far better
than other national programs.
As of May 1983, some 53,700 famil-
ies had been resettled on 805,156 hec-
tares of land. As of January 1981,
525,153 tenant farmers had been
awarded certificates of land transfer. By
June 1972, the Land Bank had financed
the acquisition by 104,452 farmer-ben-
eficiaries of 201,255 hectares of agrarian
land.
Stannard notes that Pope John Paul
II has “spoken out strongly against
priests” who involve themselves in “the
theology of liberation” in Third World
countries and that, despite the Papal
stricture, Father Gore had “conceded
that that was precisely what he had been
preaching and practicing (sic) in the
Philippines for the past 16 years.”
The Jesuit Superior General, Father
Peter Hans Kolvenbach, SJ, in a recent
TV interview in New York, echoed the
Pope’s injunction (Philippines Daily Ex-
press, June 16, 1984), saying, among
other things, that a priest must serve as a
“minister of reconciliation” and stay
out of politics because “... politics pits
one group against another...”
But isn’t this what Father Gore was
doing pitting tenant against landlord
in a country in which he was a guest?
The “theology of liberation,” he says,
“basically tries to bring reconciliation
between landlord and peasant.” But
sadly, he has not reconciled them; he
has instead divided them. Amazingly,

When you find the car that you always
wanted, life can get pretty exciting.
Particularly when the car has all the
trappings of a luxury car in an economy size.
All the verve and grace of a Rover.
All the economy, reliability and high
resale value of the best imported Japanese cars.
And, best of all, a modest price tag of
$13,400.* (Which is about what you’d normally
pay for a Toyota Celica Hatchback, Mazda 626
Super Deluxe 5-Door, oraTelstarTXs Ghia.) **
As you can see, the Rover Quintet is really
something to get excited about.
The luxury in exciting detail.
When you discuss the Quintet, it’s best to
start with a long list of comforts and features,
and just tick them off.
Power steering. Electric windows. Electric
aerial. Twin remote control exterior mirrors.
Pioneer stereo radio/cassette.
Seats, doors and headrests beautifully
finished in crushed velour.
Carpet youd be happy to have in your
home. (Even the load space is carpeted.)
Alloy wheels. Radial ply tyres.
Tachometer. Interior releases for the fuel filler
cap and rear hatch.
You’ll also find a 16-way warning light
display that lets you know if doors aren’t closed
properly or if a bulb has blown.
And warning chimes in case you leave
your lights on.
Electric sunroof and air conditioning are
attractive options.
Exciting Performance.
The Rover Quintet is surprisingly quick. f
More than a second quicker up to 100
km/h than the Camira SL/X 4-speed and the
Toyota Celica 5-speed 3-door.
The Quintet is also more economical,

using between IV2 and 3 litres per 100 km less
petrol around town. n
Standard petrol at that.
The source of this remarkable perform-
ance is the Quintet’s highly efficient 1.6 litre,
4-cylinder engine with its overhead cam, alloy
cylinder head and its electronic ignition.
To cap it all off, the Quintet has cat-like
agility. With 4-wheel independent suspension
and front wheel drive.
Exciting but sensible.
For all its luxury and performance, the
Rover Quintet is also a surprisingly practical car.
It has four doors, a rear hatch and rear
seat backs that fold down independently.
It’s so well built, you’re assured of trouble-
free motoring.
(You only have to walk around the car to
see how well it all fits together.)
All in all, can you think of a more exciting
way to spend $13,400?*

“If an election were held tomorrow, which party...?”
he even challenged the “social, cultural,
even religious structures ...” in Negros
Occidental.
If a foreign priest did all this in Aus-
tralia, would he not be regarded rightly
as an officious meddler?
Despite his residence of 14 years or
so in Kabankalan, and while he speaks
its dialect and has adopted some local
customs, Father Gore is still an outsider
who has no real grasp of the native cul-
ture.
For instance, he misinforms when he
says his “parishioners, the workers and
the peasants regard themselves as being
in the same position as medieval serfs
as the goods and chattels of the land-
owners . . as the latter’s “pos-
session.”
Father Gore has got it wrong. This is
where a little knowledge becomes
dangerous. The Filipino, especially in
Negros Occidental, whether in the rural
or urban area, is a proud person; he will
not allow anyone to own him or to re-
gard him as the possession of another
person.
In his literal way, Father Gore puts
more meaning than there is in words
such as sakup and tao, ignoring their
nuances. Sakup does not mean “pos-
session” at all, as he claims. It means
“member of a group” or “member of a
community.” When Father Gore calls
the townspeople of Kabankalan “my
parishioners” he is saying they are his
sakup, just as a union leader would re-
gard a member of his sakup.
He says tao means “I am the person
of Mr so and so.” This is not so. In fact,
tao means “man” or “person.” In a
broader sense, tao means a trusted con-
fidant, “my boy,” “my man,” certainly
not connoting ownership by one person
of another.
One understands Father Gore’s im-
patience but the dismantling of the col-
onial remnants of Philippine society is
our concern and nobody else’s. For all
his good intentions, he should perhaps
be reminded that Rome was not built in
a day and that the responsibility for
change lies not in his hands but in the
sovereign hands of the 53 million
Filipinos and their leadership.

Getting the goat
Teachers, parliamentarians, journalists
and TV commentators have aroused the
ire of T. H. Scott of Barbaldine, Queens-
land (B, July 17), by using the term
“kids” for “children.”
It “gets the goat” of goat breeders,
too. At least their kids (four-legged var-
iety) don’t disrupt theatre performances
or romantic restaurant dinners with
their wailings and other anti-social
habits.
Further to T. H. Scott’s letter, kids
and their parents (“bucks” and “does,”
incidentally, not “billies” and
“nannies”) will not “thrive on a diet of
old newsprint, cigarette butts, etc.” Nic-
otine is as poisonous to them as it is to
homo sapiens. Equally, they will not
“fatten on anything they can masticate,”
though they can survive in conditions
that would wipe out most farm animals.
Too many cases of unintentional
cruelty have occurred because unwitting
new goat keepers have subscribed to the
ideas of people such as T. H. Scott.
To maximise their milk, fleece or
meat production, goats require carefully
balanced diets like any other species. If
you see a goat eating cigarette butts or
Uncle Alfred’s long johns, the animal is
either severely malnourished or starv-
ing.
The humble goat dairy, not fleece
variety produces considerably more
milk for each kilogram of feed eaten
than the cow, which is unaccountably
more favored in the English-speaking
world. The goat is also an extremely at-
tractive companion animal.

Fell into trap
Katharine West (B, June 26-July 3) is to
be congratulated for her perceptive
analysis of what is wrong with the Lib-
eral Party in Australia but, alas, she falls
into the same trap that practically all
Australians fall into - that the party
needs merely to change its form of inter-
vention in Australian affairs.
Our problem is excessive interven-
tion, by whatever government. It is pon-
derous, costly and ineffective, regardless
of the philosophical direction that it
purports to pursue. Australia does not
lack the entrepreneurial spirit, the in-
novative individual or the opportunity:
but it is stifled by regulation, by too
much and too many costly governments
and by a pathetic dedication (including
among businessmen) to safety-first poli-
cies.
If the Liberal Party is to offer a genu-
ine philosophical alternative not only to
the present government but also to the
various governments of the past 20
years, it must first comprehend the
rationale of a genuinely free society and
then explain it to the electorate. The
Liberals’ tragedy is that they espouse,
but do not understand, free enterprise.
Until they do, they can expect to con-
tinue to languish as a limp and probably
ineffective alternative to the interven-
tionist pragmatism of the Hawke Gov-
ernment (while it survives the onslaught
of the left).

Not at all happy
1 am writing in relation to the article
entitled “Left control of ALP executive
under challenge,” by Richard Farmer
(B, May 1).
I was offended by this article and, in
particular, by the caption under my
photograph reading “Retiring member
for Fraser, Ken Fry: his numbers play
didn’t work.” The article was, in my
opinion, inaccurate and there were
some misleading statements including:
1. Marc Robinson has never been a del-
egate to the federal executive but has in
fact been an alternate delegate.
2. Mr Robinson has not always voted
in opposition to Mr Hawke. I have a
letter from Mr Robinson to this effect.
3. I have not resigned from the parlia-
ment and have never fixed a date for my
resignation.
4. The government has made no de-
cision on East Timor which is in conflict

Some people think that success in the money
market requires black magic and a ouija board.
Others believe in sophisticated computers and
international telecommunications.
Frankly, neither view is correct.
Our success in the money market, which dates
back to the pioneering work we did with
Commercial Bills of Exchange, owes more to another
commodity which all the computers in the world
could not replace.

with the party's policy and of which I
may have been critical.
5. I have not made any public state-
ments about the export of uranium.
6. I was overseas in the last week prior
to the pre-selection ballot and on the
day of the ballot itself and therefore
played no role whatever in the critical
closing stages of the ballot.
7. It is not at all unusual for office hold-
ers within the Australian Labor Party to
support candidates for public office and
letters of support for candidates for the
seat of Fraser pre-selection were signed
by other public office holders.
I hope that in future The Bulletin will
check with the subject of any article the
accuracy of the information contained
in it. When inaccurate and misleading
information is printed, as in this par-
ticular instance, such statements are un-
fair to the subject of the article and in
this case caused a great deal of distress,
embarrassment and misunderstanding
between myself and my party colleagues
as well as presenting a misleading view
to the public at large.

A major challenge
I would like to congratulate Hugh
Morgan on his article (B, July 10). He
has stated in straightforward terms
where this country is heading if we
don’t do something about it and spelt
out the persecution that miners, farmers
and the rest of the private sector are
suffering from the unproductive public
sector of the economy. A lot of these
people seem to forget how much the na-
tion relies on the miners and farmers to
pay for the majority of its bills.
There is pressure from conservation-
ists (concerning wildlife and land man-
agement), animal liberationists and
Aborigines and now added to all that
we have, in this part of Australia, the
report of the Joint Select Committee of
the Legislative Council and the Legisla-
tive Assembly inquiring into the West-
ern Division of New South Wales.
This committee, chaired by Mrs
Marie Fisher, MLA, appears not to have
looked into any of the ramifications as-
“Do you have to go around showing
everyone your autopsy scar?”
sociated with its recommendations.
The report would have the current
management of the Western Division
(the Western Lands Commission)
thrown out and replaced with a Western
Lands Management Authority and the
current commissioner replaced by a di-
rector and an advisory council of 17 to
20 people representing diverse inter-
ests from the Department of Agriculture
and five lessees to representatives from
the Department of Sport, Leisure and
Tourism and the Aboriginal regional
councils creating a costly, unwork-
able body with wide powers to exercise
controls.
The proposed management authority
would have staff - performing strategy
plans, economic and budgetary controls
and land use controls, reviewing the
covenants on the so-called perpetual
leases every 10 years and inspecting the
leases at least every four years or
putting them on a category system of
inspecting more often if a lessee is not
doing the right thing.
These, with many other controls and
regulations, would serve to create a
huge bureaucracy at great cost to the
people in the Western Division who
have looked after the country for more
than 100 years and improved its pro-
ductivity and covered up most of the
scars made on the land by earlier set-
tlers. Since the recent drought the recov-
ery of this land has been astounding.
It seems to me that these unproduc-
tive people in this country won’t be sat-
isfied until they have stifled the private
sector entirely. Surely they have enough
intelligence to see what the outcome
would be.

Not forgotten
In reference to the feature “Tarnish on
our Steele Rudd” (B, July 3), I would
like to point out that indeed Steele
Rudd has not been forgotten.
The Cambooya Rural Youth club is
in the preliminary stages of erecting a
replica of the Steele Rudd hut on the
original selection site at Greenmount,
near Toowoomba, with the permission
of Cambooya Shire Council.
Our club undertook this project be-
cause of the strong community feeling
for Arthur Hoey Davis (Steele Rudd).
As well as making club members more
familiar with such a colorful character
in our history, we will also gain first-
hand experience of construction meth-
ods of the era in which he lived.
The hut will be built of hand-hewn
timber slabs and will be of the same di-
mensions as the original Steele Rudd
dwelling.
Last year, at the Queensland Rural
Youth State Convention at Coolum on
the Sunshine Coast, plans for this long-
term project won for our club the $3OO
Westpac Award for a community ser-
vice project.
The Cambooya Rural Youth club
has put a lot of time and planning into
this undertaking and it is unfortunate
that our efforts to preserve this integral
part of Australian history went
unreported in Peter Ellingsen’s article.
Steele Rudd has not been forgotten and
we believe this project will help to en-
sure that he will not be in the future.

Sex is good
One can only agree with Ron Saw when
he asks “So what in God’s name is
wrong with enjoying sex?” (B, July 17).
In God’s eyes nothing is wrong with
enjoying sex. The Bible speaks often of
the delight which husband and wife are
to have in one another. Sex is a good
and beautiful thing.
However, good things can be put to
bad uses, as in extra-marital sex. What-
ever the immediate physical pleasure, il-
licit sex has no joy in comparison to
marriage.

Not much change
So David McNicoll’s acquaintance,
Peter Wagner, general manager of Sun
City, Bophuthatswana, has “proved that
the black African is capable of taking
over supervisory jobs and even moving
into the intricate world of the croupier”
(B, July 17). How wonderful!
Perhaps Wagner should spend some
time living and working in genuine
black African countries, rather than a
puppet state. From such experience in
both East and West Africa in the 60s
and 70s I know of many black Africans
who have achieved considerably more
than routine supervisory jobs. My black

"I'm taking over
$5,000a month with my
Kis 1-Hour Photo Processor."
“Kis I -hour processing has really taken off. During the
last Christmas holiday season we had the machine running 24
hours a day to cope with the demand. Installing Kis was one
of the best moves we ever made.”
No matter what kind of business you’re in, if you have
some floor space that isn’t pulling its weight, get a Kis I -hour
Photo Processor and Kis that low profit space goodbye. The
Kis Photo Processor needs less than 2.3 sq metres of floor
space, and by processing as few as 20 rolls of film a day, you
could earn over $40,000 in a full year. Process 40 rolls of film
a day and your earnings could go to almost $ 100,000.
“Every other machine on the market is so large and
expensive I think Kis is made specially for people with
businesses like mine. Its compact size is a real advantage.
If our customers weren’t completely delighted with their Kis
prints, they wouldn’t come back. But they do.”

In just one hour of machine time Kis processes, prints
and enlarges NO, 126, 135, and disc film. “Kis costs less than
a quarter of any comparable machine on the market, yet the
quality photos we can produce are equal to anything from
equipment costing $lOO,OOO or more.”
You can buy for a low initial deposit, the balance over
five years, or lease without any capital outlay. Kis can help you
arrange finance too, if needs be.

African friends include a barrister, doc-
tors in various disciplines, a university
dean, civil engineers and at least two
dozen well-qualified teachers in pos-
itions of responsibility.
My knowledge of black African
achievement meant that I suffered dis-
tinct culture shock when, like David
McNicoll, I visited South Africa and
saw for myself the limited responsibility
given to black Africans. Wagner’s re-
ported attitude leads me to believe that
not much has changed.

Poetry must change
With reference to several letters (B, July
17) regarding the recent literary sup-
plement selection of poems and their
construction.
Consider Shakespeare, Milton, Pope
and Wordsworth; Walt Whitman,
Swinburne, T. S. Eliot, Banjo Paterson,
Rupert Brooke, Dylan Thomas and
Sylvia Plath. These are all well-known
poets, many widely quoted. Consider
the changing styles over the years (16th-
20th century).
Do readers really want poetry to
stand still, which is often equal to stag-
nation? Poetry, like everything else,
must suffer change and it is the reader’s
choice whether or not to suffer the po-
etry. The best verse survives the years,
regardless of style.
Ars longa, vita brevis.
JULIA OSBORNE

Real poetry
I’ve rushed through the washing-up so I
can compose this letter which I’ve been
hankering to write ever since I read The
Bulletin’s Literary Supplement, namely
the poetry. I’ve held back because I’m a
critic without any standing. I left school
at 15 and have not had any tutoring or
“The rest of the family? In the
parlor, glued to the
bloody piano as usual.”
done any reading on the how, what and
where of the art of poetry. Yet, I am a
poet.
About two years ago I, for some un-
fathomable reason, commenced writing
poetry. Or should I say “words.” Some-
times only six lines and others many
verses. Now, these words that express
my mind would not grace the pages of
your magazine. They have no hidden
meanings. Some of them even rhyme!
Others have a nice ring to them as you
wrap your mouth around each syllable.
I believe that’s called rhythm, thanks
to R. C. Slessor (B, July 17). And to
Dean Kiley (B, July 17), thank you. You
gave me the confidence to have my say.
The poetry in the supplement re-
minded me of the children’s story “The
Emperor With No Clothes.” Frankly, I
couldn’t care less if I’m called an idiot.
That poetry was naked, bare, stark. Ob-
viously it was approved of by some. But
how about the many? The many ordi-
nary non-intellectuals like me.
I challenge The Bulletin to print my
letter and the following example of my
writing. I’ll wager that you’ll receive
hordes of letters; would you believe a
few? Well, one from my mum and dad
stating that they enjoyed my poem.
Whether it qualifies to be called poetry
is not the point. The judgment should be
decided on its ability to entertain and
manifest a feeling.
WORRY
Worry, your brow crinkles.
Eyes squinted with concern.
Eating deeply into your self.
When will you ever learn ?
Your shoulders are only so wide.
Don’t give so many worries a ride.
A tree grows without a care,
If it’s left alone to stand there.
A child plays with his mind intent,
On the single ambition to enjoyment.
Be a tree, once every while.
Be a child with frivolous style,
Once every while.

Bulletin Week praised
IN complimenting you on the merging
of The Bulletin and Newsweek, I express
my special pleasure at the publication
(B, July 10) of the intensely interesting
article Ringbarked in the Alice by
Lenore Nicklin and the feature, Barry
Cohen’s World, by Glennys Bell. This
was news-feature journalism at its best.

Nothing better
I have been reading The Bulletin for 35
years and my children have from the
time they could read at all.
I would argue that for our purposes
“No, I’m sorry, bosun, there’s
nobody down here for
50 lashes today.”
there is no better news magazine in the
world, that no change has not been an
improvement and the addition of
Newsweek is no exception.
May I, however, make a plea that
nothing dilutes the input of your regular
contributors (Adams, McNicoll, Saw),
and that your excellent (unique indeed)
literary supplements continue to
flourish and grow.
Lastly, what now happens to your
features from US News & World Report?
We gave that magazine up because of
your coverage.
RICHARD LEARY

It’s a ripper
The new magazine is a ripper! Con-
gratulations. Lots of interesting stuff in
That’s What You Say. Many thanks to
those contributors who highlighted two
of my pet aversions “kids” for chil-
dren and “Bums on seats.” To those
please add “at this point in time” and
the constant repetition of “you know.”
I would like to enlist the aid of David
McNicoll in a campaign to restore
proper use of the verb to be. I refuse to
concede that “I’m him” and other rel-
evant variations are any improvement
on “I’m he.”
Batman, sir, I protest at your “I bet
you don’t gamble as much as us.”
Regarding the Jackie Howe garment;
of course, the original basically was a
short-sleeved flannel garment but
wasn’t J. H. the first (acknowledged)
gent either to cut or tear out the sleeves
to give coolness and more freedom of
movement? This sleeveless garment be-
came the Jackie Howe shirt.
Here’s to another 100 years (at least)
of The Bulletin!

WITHOUT EPSON, HALF THE WORLD’S COMPUTERS
k WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO WRITE THEIR OWN NAMES.
If you've ever had anything to do with computers, you'll
be familiar with the name EPSON.®
II After all, EPSON is the world's largest manufacturer of
| computer printers.
But this is only one of a long list of EPSON achievements
over the past two decades. EPSON developed the first printing
head for miniature calculators.
It pioneered the development
application of Liquid Crystal Displays.
And it developed the world's first
low-cost computer printer.
Today, almost half the world's calculators, cash registers
and computers depend on components developed and manu-
factured by EPSON.
This has all been made possible because of EPSON'S
specialisation in “mechatronics" - the art of combining precise
mechanical and electronic technologies. In fact, more than 15%
of EPSON'S workforce are devoted to research and develop-
ment in this important field.
The result is EPSON'S own range of business computers
r and printers. Each one begins with an inbuilt operational advantage.
Perhaps this is why so many business people have made
i EPSON a part of their success.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Young under attack
SPECIAL Minister of State
Mick Young admitted he had
made a false Customs declar-
ation which had resulted in a
later payment of $1093 on
goods found in bags belong-
ing to his wife and sent by him
from London to Australia
as unaccompanied luggage.
The Opposition demanded
Young’s resignation, drawing
a parallel between the inci-
dent and the one in April 1982
when two Liberal Ministers
had to resign over the import-
ation of a color television set
on which no duty had been
paid initially.
Good report
THE Paris-based Organisa-
tion for Economic Co-oper-
ation and Development gave
Australia a good mark in its
annual economic survey. The
report estimated that Austra-
lia’s growth rate in 1983-84
reached a satisfactory 6.1 per-
cent but warned that by the
second half of 1985 economic
expansion could fall to just
over 3 percent. Unemploy-
ment would not be reduced
greatly in 1985 but it could be
cut marginally from the pre-
sent 9.3 percent to 8.9 percent.
12 arrested
DESPITE week-long demon-
strations against the export of
yellow cake, the cargo vessel
Clydebank left Darwin with a
$35 million shipment of ura-
nium oxide on board. Two
anti-nuclear protesters, a man
and a woman, who had tried
Mick Young: facing problems over a Customs declaration
to stow away on the
Clydebank, were arrested
along with 10 other demon-
strators.
Business migrants
THE Federal Government set
aside about 4000 visas for
business immigrants (and
their families) expected to
possess sizeable capital for a
start in the Australian econ-
omy. But the minimum
amount for qualifying for this
category of immigration was
doubled from $250,000 to
$500,000.
Pay rises
FEDERAL judges and top-
ranking public servants
received an 11.7 percent pay
increase 6 percent from July
1 and 5.7 percent from next
January 1. From that date the
salary of the Chief Justice, Sir
Harry Gibbs, will be $112,790
plus an expense allowance of
$5430 a year. Permanent
heads will be paid $74,588
and $3BOO in allowances a
year.
Gore returns
FATHER Brian Gore, 40,
received an emotional wel-
come in Perth when he re-
turned to Australia from the
Philippines, where he had
spent more than two years in
jail. With seven others Irish
priest Niall O’Brian and six
Filipinos he had been
charged with the ambush and
murder of a local mayor in
March 1982. After lengthy
legal battles the charges were
dropped, the accused were
freed and Gore and O’Brian
were given 30 days to leave
the country.
Doctors back
NORMAL medical services
were restored to NSW public
hospitals following successful
negotiations on most issues
between doctors and the state
government. Negotiations on
outstanding problems will
continue.
Harvest boost
EXTENSIVE rains in eastern
Australia boosted hopes of a
good wheat harvest. The Aus-
tralian Wheat Board lifted its
crop estimate from 14.1 mil-
lion tonnes to at least 15.1
million tonnes.
THE WORLD
McDonald’s massacre
ONE afternoon last week, re-
cently-sacked security guard
James Oliver Huberty, 41,
married with two children,
walked into a McDonald’s
restaurant in the US town of
San Ysidro near the Mexican
border carrying an arsenal of
guns and ammunition. He
shot 21 people dead and
wounded at least another 20
until a policeman shot him
dead. Police called it Ameri-
ca’s worst massacre by a lone
killer.
Fritz gets the nod
THE US Democratic Party
convention in San Francisco
elected Walter Mondale to
contest the presidential elec-
tion in November. He needed
1967 votes to win but received
2014.
Polish amnesty
THE POLISH Parliament
(Sejm) approved a sweeping
amnesty to commemorate the
40th anniversary of commu-
nist rule in Poland. The am-
nesty includes most political
prisoners between 600 and
700 persons in detention or
awaiting trial and about
35,000 common criminals.
The amnesty extends to mem-
bers of the underground op-
position provided they give
themselves up before the end
of this year.
New French PM
PRESIDENT Mitterrand of
France appointed Laurent
Fabius, 37, to head a new gov-
ernment following the resig-
nation of Prime Minister


Pierre Mauroy who had held
the post since the Socialist
Party’s victory at the 1981 par-
liamentary election. Mauroy
fell because of the poor per-
formance of the French econ-
omy and controversy over a
plan to give the government
greater control over private
mainly Catholic schools.
Fabius is France’s youngest
prime minister. The commu-
nists who had four ministerial
posts in the old government
decided not to participate in
the new one.
BUSINESS
Legal mergers
THE merging of law firms
started in earnest nationwide.
Freehill, Hollingdale and
Page of Sydney and Can-
berra, Moules of Melbourne
and Muir Williams Nicholson
of Perth combined to form the
biggest law firm in the
country. The venture is a
national legal partnership
rather than a merger, operat-
ing as a separate legal firm
with 91 partners under the
name Freehill, Hollingdale
and Page. Two Melbourne
firms, Corr and Corr and
Pavey Whiting and Byrne,
also joined, creating the
biggest legal firm in Victoria
with 38 partners.
Building slows
AUSTRALIAN Bureau of
Statistics figures showed that
the pent-up demand for hous-
ing resulting from the intro-
duction of the federal govern-
ment’s first home owners’
scheme had started to level
out. Building approval figures
for May, while 28.6 percent
above the three months to
May 1983, were only 0.8 per-
cent above the three months
to the end of February 1984.
The 13,838 buildings ap-
proved in May were about 10
percent above the April fig-
ures, largely reflecting the
clearing of the backlog in
building applications after the
slowdown in the housing in-
dustry over the Easter break.
New chief for Myer
TONY ROBERTS was ap-
pointed managing director of
Myer Emporium Ltd, filling
the position left vacant for
more than 18 months by the
early retirement of the for-
mer chief executive Keith
Rosenhain. Sidney Myer will
remain executive chairman of
Myer but will hand over to
Roberts the day-to-day re-
sponsibility of running Aus-
tralia’s largest department
store group.
Cheque interest
THE Commonwealth Bank-
ing Corporation announced it
would be the first of the major
Australian banks to offer in-
terest on cheque accounts.
The bank will introduce a new
two-tiered account which will
pay interest of 4 percent, cal-
culated daily, on cheque ac-
count balances between $2OOO
and $4999 and 7 percent
above $5OOO.

AUSTRALIA
Exclusive: Why Hawke will
call an early election this year
An election late this year, rather than early next year, now seems probable. Prime Minister Bob
Hawke is being influenced says RICHARD FARMER, not by any consideration of the
opposition but by the chance to upstage the left wing of his own party in pre-selections
PRIME MINISTER Bob Hawke is
under great pressure from his right-wing
supporters to call an election as soon as
possible. December 1 and November 24
are the most favored dates. The pressure
has little to do with what is the best date
to achieve the biggest victory. Such is
the confidence in the Labor camp, the
assumption is that victory will come
whenever the poll is held. The right-
wing pressure for getting the election
over this year is based on a desire to
limit the left-wing influence on who is
chosen to represent the Labor Party.
And all the signs are that Hawke will go
along with the proposal to have the elec-
tion this year instead of next.
The script, as written by the Prime
Minister’s right-wing advisers, is that
the election date be announced within a
couple of weeks of the Electoral Com-
mission making its final determination
about boundaries for NSW. Such an an-
nouncement, by Hawke, in mid-
October, would make it impossible for
the normal pre-selection methods of the
Labor Party to be applied.
While party rules differ from state to
state, in general they provide for rank
and file members to have a considerable
say. But the rank and file is dominated
by left-wingers. A snap election would
place NSW pre-selections in the hands
of the party machine. This is the key
state for the right and thus for Hawke.
In the new parliament of 148 members
Prime Minister Bob Hawke: scenario for election date announcement


in the House of Representatives, NSW
will have 51 an increase of eight.
It is one of the anomalies of power in
the Labor Party that the moderates are
in control of the federal executive and
the federal conference while having a
majority in only one of the six state con-
ferences. Even in that state NSW
the right’s control of party branches is
anything but assured. Its strength in
NSW and elsewhere comes from trade
union delegates and not those from
branches. Yet pre-selection procedures
give rank and file members and, hence,
the left a considerable say in who is
chosen to represent the party.
What concerns the right-wing con-
trollers''close to Hawke is that the next
election will be fought on the new
boundaries. The creation of 23 seats
Australia-wide ensures that some of
these changes will be substantial. So
does the instruction in the legislation
under which the Electoral Commjssion
operates to weight the numbers in elec-
torates to allow for population growth.
Whereas rural electorates are smaller
than city ones, this will not be the case
at the next election. The fastest-growing
suburban areas will initially have fewer
voters on their rolls, with the commis-
sion aiming to have all electorates of
equal size for the poll after next.
The convention within the party that
sitting members not be challenged for
pre-selection does not apply when
boundaries are changed substantially.
The fear of the right is that boundaries
in NSW will result in a substantially
changed electoral map. A March or
April election next year thus could re-
sult in a mad scramble for pre-selec-
tions. A November or December poll
would put the question in the hands of
the state administrative committee
where the right has the numbers.
The redistribution committee for
NSW is not expected to present its draft
report on the shape of electorates until
the second week of August. After the
maps are prepared comes a period of 14
days during which interested parties can
make comments and objections. The
commission then has a further six weeks
to consider whether the draft bound-
aries should be changed. This means
that the final shape of electorates might
not be known until the second week of
October.
The NSW branch rules provide for
candidates to be chosen by rank and file
ballots by federal electorate councils.
Yet, reconstituting these councils would
take several weeks as branches work out
in which electorate each of their mem-
bers live. If the Prime Minister wants his
election on Saturday, December 1, he
must announce it at least 33 days before
on October 26. A November 24 elec-
tion would have to be called by October
19. Either of these dates October 19

Peacock: lagging badly behind Hawke
IF A Federal election had been held in
the middle of July the Hawke Govern-
ment would have been returned with an
increased majority, the Morgan Gallup
Poll finds. And if a Senate election had
been held the ALP would have obtained
48 percent of the vote, which is 3 per-
cent less than the House of Representa-
tives support. The Democrats and inde-
pendents would have held the balance
of power.
Of all electors surveyed, 74 percent
(up 2 percent) said they felt Bob Hawke
would make a better Prime Minister,
while 14 percent (down 1 percent) said
Andrew Peacock. However, of L-NP
voters surveyed, 53 percent (up 5 per-
cent), a record high, said Hawke would
make the better Prime Minister, while
29 percent (down 3 percent) said Pea-
cock and 18 percent were undecided.

Senator Margaret Reynolds who retained her preselection after federal intervention
and October 26 would leave insuffi-
cient time for federal electorate councils
to be reconstituted.
In these circumstances there are, the-
oretically, two choices. Rule M 42 pro-
vides for candidates to be chosen by a
panel consisting of the 25-member ad-
ministrative committee with an equal
number of branch members from the
local area. Yet choosing the 25 branch
members would present the same diffi-
culties as letting federal electorate coun-
cils select the candidate themselves.
This makes letting the administrative
committee make the selections the only
real option.
On this body, the right can normally
rely on a solid 15 votes to the left’s eight.
Premier Neville Wran and independent
right-winger Peter Morris would also be
expected to vote with the machine on an
issue such as pre-selections, giving the
right a 17-8 majority.
The left in NSW is bound to be un-
happy about having its fate so decided.
And it is the prospect of a row on the
eve of an election that will cause the
administrative committee to exercise its
power with caution. The endorsements
it makes will probably reflect the right
and left balance among NSW members
of the House of Representatives.
It is with pre-selections for the Sen-
ate that the numbers are likely to be
exercised more ruthlessly. The party’s
state conference this year abolished the
council which used to choose Senate
candidates. The administrative commit-
tee has the task.
The retiring Labor senators, Kerry
Sibraa and left-winger Bruce Childs,
will not be challenged. Yet on this occa-
sion, with an enlarged Senate, Labor
has an excellent chance of returning
four senators and the left will be lucky
to get another.
In the two other major states, Vic-
toria and Queensland, pre-selections are
also likely to provide some excitement
within the party. In each case, a mixture
of local branch members and central
panels chooses the candidates. Yet nor-
mal party rules will probably be fol-
lowed because the final boundaries
should be announced a couple of weeks
earlier than in NSW where the redistri-
bution process was delayed by this
year’s state election.
Queensland has already had tur-
moil over Labor’s Senate ticket, with
the federal executive stepping in to en-
sure that Senator Margaret Reynolds
from Townsville retained her place on
it. The left, right and centre factions had
not been able to work out an agreement
among themselves which would guaran-
tee Reynolds a winnable position. Fed-
eral secretary Bob McMullan was con-
cerned that Queensland factional rigid-
ity would cost the party support in the
north. Even though Reynolds normally
sides with the left within the caucus,
Hawke supported federal intervention.
The Senate in Victoria also provides
that state’s most interesting pre-sel-
ection tussle, although for different
reasons. Long-time Socialist Left leader
Bill Hartley is determined finally to
make federal parliament.
The numbers of the 100-person panel
that will select Senate candidates are
quite delicately balanced. Some of the
younger members of the left fear that
Hartley might only make fourth spot on
the ticket if he is the Socialist Left
choice for pre-selection. Given the oft-
expressed public disquiet about Hartley,
this could result in his failing to win.
Another socialist left candidate if one
of sufficient stature to topple Hartley
can be found almost certainly would
get the third spot. That would give the
Socialist Left a certain member in the
parliamentary caucus of winning four
of the seven Senate seats to be con-
tested.
In Western Australia and South Aus-
tralia pre-selections are proceeding on
the basis that the draft recommenda-
tions of those states’ redistribution com-
mittees will be given final approval by
the Electoral Commission. The most in-
teresting contest is for the new South
Australian seat of Makin where the
left’s Peter Duncan and state secretary
Chris Schott are running. Duncan, a
former state cabinet minister and still
state member for Elizabeth, is favored
to win a real test of strength between the
left and the centre left faction of which
Schott is a prominent member.
Whoever gets the endorsement is cer-
tain to end up in Canberra the bound-
aries drawn make it a safe Labor seat.
Perhaps the greatest thing going for
Duncan is the desire of many of his for-
mer ministerial colleagues from the
right and centre to see him out of their
hair.
The Senate pre-selection in Tas-
mania is in a state of suspended anima-
tion following a court ruling that del-
egates of the Amalgamated Metal
Workers and Shipwrights’ Union to the
party’s state conference were not chosen
correctly. This local dispute might even
provide the key for the federal executive
to step in and make the endorsements,
as it did in Queensland. □


PICKERING’S WEEK


THE MEDIA
Rupert Murdoch’s
Olympian splurge
on the LA games
By TREVOR SYKES
APART FROM the Olympics, the
biggest media event in Los Angeles next
month may well be Rupert Murdoch’s
splurge on his coverage of the games.
Murdoch first caused a sensation
when he bid a staggering $10.6 million
for Australian television rights to the
games. This, however, was only the
start. The most popular guessing game
in the media industry at present is what
his total cost will be to cover the Games.
Insiders reckon less than $2l million,
but outsiders say the bill could top $25
million.
The Channel Ten network is devot-
ing enormous manpower to its cover-
age. The technical and production crew
going to Los Angeles from Australia for
Murdoch amount to more than 80
people. This figure does not include 27
commentators. In addition there will be
a print team of 12 writers, under group
general manager editorial Brian
Hogben, covering the events for
Murdoch’s Australian papers.
All up, Murdoch will have more than
100 staffers in Los Angeles for a fort-
night or more.
In addition, Murdoch has booked
153 rooms at the Beverly Wilshire Ho-
tel, where for the duration of the games,
he will be hosting the advertisers who
were the major sponsors for Channel
Ten’s coverage. The guest list runs to
nearly 300 people, including those who
got games tickets as part of their spon-
sorship package. They will be given free
accommodation and a $lO-a-day food
allowance, the cost of a basic breakfast.
Murdoch also has a hospitality suite
set up for Channel Ten and will host
two large receptions. To be entertained
by Hardy’s Wines, ice sculptures and
Vice President George Bush.
One bonus for the advertisers will be
that they can watch their own games
television coverage, including commer-
cials. The Channel Ten
coverage of the Games
will be transmitted, via
local microwave relay,
to the Beverly Wil-
shire.
During commercial
breaks, Channel Ten
technicians will cut off
the US commercials
and patch in the com-
mercials that are being
shown back in Austra-
lia. This has to be done
using a machine to con-
vert the advertisements
shot for Australian 625-
line television to the
American 525-line system.
Murdoch’s extravaganza looks like
being so lavish that some advertising
people have begun wondering whether
he will make any money out of the
games.
The short answer is that as a direct
investment they appear certain to be a
loser, although his sedulous wooing of
major advertisers might win him longer
term benefits for Ten. To be fair, Ten’s
general manager George Brown says:
“The only comment I’ll make is that
we’re in the black.”
To begin with, the costs are high.
Murdoch paid comparatively more for
Los Angeles’ Beverly Wilshire where Ten’s sponsors will be entertained
rights than networks for Japan and Eur-
ope. Japan paid SUSIB.S million for the
rights, while the European networks
paid SUSI9.B million for Europe inclu-
ding Britain. Canada and the Soviet
bloc paid only $3 million each.
On a per capita basis, Murdoch has
paid far more than the network in any
other nation except the United States.
To secure the rights, Ten had to pay
the money up front three years ago,
which means that it has foregone inter-
est on the payment
since and the real cost
to the network could be
estimated at close to $l4
million.
To cover his costs,
Murdoch devised a sys-
tem of gold, silver and
bronze sponsorships.
Originally there were to
be eight gold sponsor-
ships, with a price tag of
$2.16 million each. The
number was later
reduced to six and only
five were taken by
Ansett (in which
Murdoch’s News Cor-
poration has a half interest), The ANZ
Bank, National Panasonic, Toyota,
Carlton & United Breweries.
All 10 silver sponsorships (at
$895,000 each) were taken by the Aus-
tralian Dairy Corporation, Gillette,
McDonald’s, Qantas, Shell, Dulux,
IBM, Kellogg’s, Beecham and Budget
Rental Systems.
The bronzes are still selling. There
are 20 on offer at $412,000 each. It is
understood that very few have been
sold. In an effort to move them Channel
Ten marketers have broken them down
further, so that an advertiser can buy a
quarter of a bronze.
On these Humbers, Murdoch would
appear to have covered his costs. Total
gold and silver sponsorships amount to
$19.75 million with bronzes still selling.
Rival networks agree that the Ten net-
work has done a great job of marketing
the games and estimates that the group
would have raised between $23 and $25
million gross so far. Ten executives put
the figure higher, but it is difficult for an
outsider to see how.
Two million dollars is an awfully
large spend for 16 days, even though the
Olympics will be screened nationally.
For this reason the deal has been ex-
tended and the sponsors given extra
time for their commercials outside the
Olympic period.
They received advertising slots in the
Olympic telethon on the network and
on The Road to LA and The Olympiad ,
two lead-up series. They were also
credited with sponsorships for several
feature films and mini-series on the net-
work.

Lee McLeay (left) and Bruce Goodluck (in suit) listen to evidence: money not well spent?
In a typical package, a gold sponsor
would have been offered 400 30-second
spots on metropolitan TV during the 16
days, 200 spots on the 36 regional
stations, two spots in ech of the 13 epi-
sodes of The Road to LA, one in each of
the nine episodes of the same series
shown on regionals and two spots in
each of the 19 episodes of Olympiad.
The games telecast runs from mid-
night to 4pm and replays of the high-
lights were originally planned between
5 and 6pm each day. Advertisers would
also have got more spots in the replays,
but the time available has now been
halved because Ten has decided to con-
tinue showing Perfect Match from 5.30.
All this effectively dilutes the propor-
tion of the advertising dollar being
spent during the actual games. Or, to
look at it another way, the normal pro-
grams of Channel Ten are subsidising
the games programs.
Also, the $23 to $25 million revenue
is a gross figure. Advertising agencies
would have deducted a 10 percent com-
mission from this. The regionals are
understood to have secured their rights
on favorable terms, which means that
Ten will get little back out of them.
Taking into account the displaced
revenue which would otherwise have
been received from non-games tele-
vision shows and the opportunity cost
of having to pay up front for the rights,
television industry sources estimate Ten
could wind up losing $5 millon or more
on the games.
But they will rate well (especially on
the last day if Deek wins the marathon)
and Murdoch will have generated a
great deal of public relations and
hopefully goodwill. He will be looking
to the long term for the payoff. □

ABORIGINES
Parliamentary
probe into
use of funds
By DAVID ARMSTRONG
THE WORDS of Aboriginal leader
Charles Perkins returned to haunt him
last week when a parliamentary com-
mittee investigating the finances of the
Aboriginal Development Commission
was told Perkins had admitted that the
majority of about 460 commission busi-
ness enterprises were “going bad.”
Perkins, a former commission chair-
man who now is head of the federal Ab-
original Affairs Department, had told a
semi-private meeting on Thursday
Island: “We have got what they call a
moratorium on business enterprises for
individuals. Why we’ve done that is be-
cause we’ve got 460 business enterprises
out at the moment and they’re all going
bad ... or most of them are, anyhow.
We’re having great difficulty with
them.”
Perkins made the statement last
November and since then copies of a
transcript have been circulating among
people critical of him and the commis-
sion.
The commission, which had a budget
allocation of $5B million in 1983-84,
was set up in 1980 to help Aboriginal
individuals and communities to start
and run businesses, to make housing
loans and provide funds for training.
Extracts from the clandestine tran-
script were put on the public record at a
hearing in Cairns held by the House of
Representatives standing committee on
expenditure. The hearing was part of a
series of meetings and inspections the
committee held in Queensland last
week.
The extracts were read out by Paul
Phelan, special projects manager for Air
Queensland. The airline is opposing a
plan which it says is sponsored by the
commission to form an Aboriginal
mini-airline, called Palm Air, to fly the
Townsville-Palm Island route. Air
Queensland has conducted the service
for 30 years and is concerned about
competition from a rival backed by
public funds.
Perkins does not deny having made
the statement but he does say that it is
not to be taken literally. He has told The
Bulletin that he was exaggerating to re-
inforce his message that funds are tight
and that there is little point in people
flooding the commission with requests
for finance.
According to the commission’s 1982-
83 annual report: “No loan funds were
provided in 1982-83 to new individual
applicants. A moratorium was placed
on all new loans because of the severe
shortage of funding but some loans
were made to Aboriginal communities.”
Even if the official explanation is
correct that lack of money rather than
poor business practices led to the mora-
torium it is clear that all is not well
with some of the big projects the com-
mission has supported.
Last week the parliamentary com-
mittee, represented only by chairman
Leo McLeay, a Labor MP from New
South Wales, and Tasmanian Liberal
Bruce Goodluck, heard evidence con-
cerning two community-based projects;
information which raises serious ques-
tions about the way public funds admin-
istered by the commission have been
used.
In one case the business was placed
in receivership. In the other, a former
manager told of management practices
which could be described, kindly, as ec-
centric.
The first involved an enterprise
called the Keriba Lagau Development
Company Pty Ltd. The commission ad-
vanced about $1.4 million to the com-
pany to help it buy a fleet of fishing and
cargo vessels, operating in north
Queensland and Torres Strait waters.
Keriba Lagau was placed in receiver-
ship in April and is trying to trade its
way out of trouble. A statement issued
on April 17 by the then commission’s
acting chairman, Shirley McPherson, a
West Australian accountant, said the ac-
tion was taken because of poor trading
results.
McPherson said the commission had
decided to recall $840,000 in secured
loans.
What the annual report calls the
most important element in the project


was the Paluma, a 300-
tonne, 37-metre mother
ship with refrigerated
storage and processing fa-
cilities.
Ray Heilbron, chair-
man of the Cairns branch
of the Queensland Com-
mercial Fishermen’s Or-
ganisation and a former di-
rector of a Keriba Lagau
operating company,
Paluma Fisheries, said he
had been asked to help the
company because the di-
rectors wanted advice from
someone involved in the
fishing industry.
When McLeay asked Heilbron if he
would have bought the Paluma in 1980,
as the company had, Heilbron replied:
“I’d have to say ‘no’ to that.” Heilbron
added: “It’s common knowledge that
the business was for sale and the pre-
vious owner wasn’t reluctant to get out
of it.”
McLeay pointed out that the Paluma,
now almost 40 years old, had been
valued by a marine surveyor in 1982 at
$475,000. He said that in April 1984 it
had been given a book value of $435,000
and an estimated resale value of
$200,000.
Heilbron said $200,000 might “indi-
Charles Perkins
cate a more realistic view”
of the ship’s value. “I don’t
think there’d be too many
people rushing you at
$100,000,” he said. “It
would indicate to me that
the values were inflated to
start with.”
He said he had been
with the former owner,
north Queensland fisher-
man Brett Devine, when
the sale was being dis-
cussed. “When I heard the
figures being discussed and
the amount of assets
changing hands for that
amount of money, I con-
sidered Mr Devine was getting a very
good deal,” Heilbron said.
McLeay asked if the commission had
been a prudent investor, having put up
almost $500,000 to buy the business and
then having sunk extra funds in the con-
cern. Heilbron said he understood ac-
countants or business consultants had
been asked for advice but it was pos-
sible the project had not been in-
vestigated sufficiently or wrong infor-
mation had been supplied.
Heilbron said the kind of operation
envisaged could have worked. But he
thought the vessels bought were not
good enough to be competitive.
The second case involved the com-
mission’s showpiece, Delta Downs, a
cattle station near Normanton, on the
Gulf of Carpentaria. The commission
acquired all shares in the Delta Downs
Pastoral Company and therefore the
pastoral lease in December 1982. The
commission’s annual report lists the
cost of the shares as $1.6 million.
Loris Sclip, an economic adviser to
various commission projects in north
Queensland since September 1982, told
the committee of his sudden appoint-
ment as manager of the property in
February last year.
He said he had been asked, without
explanation, to accompany a number of
people to Delta Downs. “The following
day I was more or less made manager,”
he said. “I was given a chequebook
the company’s chequebook and I was
the sole signatory.”
Sclip told McLeay he had not run
such a property before. Nor was he ap-
pointed formally. “I was just given the
chequebook,” he said in answer to a
question from Goodluck. “There was
nothing on paper, nothing verbal even.”
He had been asked to “keep the proper-
ty going.”
Sclip said he had been told the ac-
count had a $200,000 overdraft. He had
been asked to stock the property to a
level where it could become functional

had left in “rather a hurry.” He said: “I
spent upwards of $lOO,OOO in six
weeks.” The money had been spent on
vehicles, horses and saddlery.
After a while, he said, “someone”

Challenge to
de facto travel
allowances
By ANTHONY HILL
AT LEAST ONE backbench member of
federal parliament has already used
overseas travel entitlement to take a de
facto spouse on a fact-finding tour, ac-
cording to Tasmanian Liberal MP
Kevin Newman.
Newman, who was minister for Ad-
ministrative Services in the Fraser gov-
ernment, says the de facto spouse was
not declared as such to the host govern-
ments.
With independent Tasmanian sena-
tor Brian Harradine, Newman will
move in parliament next month to disal-
low a determination of the Remunera-
tion Tribunal which accepts a govern-
ment move to let a senator or member
of the House of Representatives include
a person with whom he or she has “a
bona fide, stable, domestic relationship”
as a nominee for overseas travel.
Special Minister of State, Mick
Young, is to rule on the bona fides. But
the criteria seem a little vague.
Young’s office won’t say how many
applications have been made by MPs to
take de facto spouses overseas. “We
don’t keep a score card on members’
private lives,” says a spokesman. But
Newman, who administered the rel-
evant Act, says that he may have had
about half-a-dozen approaches and that
he knocked them all back.
“It is not simply the moral question,”
he says; “it is the example that should
be set by parliament.”
Proponents of the change argue that
a warm de facto relationship is prefer-
able to an unhappy marital one and, in
any case, Liberal frontbencher Steele
Hall says, it’s offensive to have rules
drawn up for MPs as though they were
“potentially bad schoolboys.”
The government has been moving
since it took office in March last year to
liberalise travel arrangements for de
facto partners. The responsible minister
has held discretionary powers but
Young was the first to allow as a matter
of policy de facto spouses to be inclu-
ded as nominees.
The politics of the opposition remain
fluid. Harradine wrote to the tribunal
this year suggesting that the proposals
on defacto overseas travel be framed as
a separate determination which could
be disallowed. It did not do so.
Instead, the choices facing Har-
radine are either a private member’s bill
which would have to pass through both
houses or a motion to disallow the
whole of Determination 18 which in-
cludes not only overseas travel but also
internal travel, private vehicle allow-
ances, telephones and postage.
If the disallowance motion suc-
ceeded, members wouldn’t even be able
to travel home from Canberra unless
the government had ready another de-
termination. □
PUBLIC OPINION
ALP maintains
lead in
SA and WA
THE LABOR governments in South
Australia and Western Australia would
have been returned if elections had been
held at the end of June, according to the
latest Morgan Gallup Polls.
In South Australia, support for the
ALP was up 1 percent to 53 percent and
Liberal support was down 1 percent to
36 percent. These figures came from in-
terviewing 726 electors throughout
South Australia in May and June. Elec-
tors were asked which party would re-
ceive their first preference “if a state
election were being held today?” Of
electors surveyed, only 9 percent didn’t
state their preference.

OPERA
Moffatt Who
takes over
quality control
By BRIAN HOAD
ONE DAY, perhaps, Moffatt Oxen-
bould will pen a piquant history of the
Australian Opera. He has witnessed in
intimate detail more of that company’s
turbulent comings and goings than any
other living soul. It could take the form
of an ode to the fallen. Some good-
humored composer such as George
Dreyfus would willingly set it to music.
Moffatt Who? To the public he is at
most a grey eminence. Investigative
journalists sometimes ask him to eluci-
date some subtle point of artistic policy.
He has occasionally directed a new pro-
duction. He is the only stable pillar of
support the company has ever known.
He joined the Australian Opera in
1963 as stage manager, a fresh young
graduate from the production course at
the National Institute of Dramatic Art.
By 1969 he was co-ordinator of plan-
ning; by 1974 artistic administrator;
and now, at the age of 40, he has been
promoted above the head of Richard
Bonynge as artistic director.
In the weird world of opera the musi-
cal director is as often as not the artistic
director. Musical directors whom
Oxenbould has known well include
Carlo Felice Cillario (1969-71), still a
regular guest conductor with the com-
pany; the tough and brilliant Edward
Downes (1972-75); and Richard
Bonynge (1976-84) now “musical di-
rector emeritus and principal guest con-
ductor.”
To confuse the situation, from 1969
to 1975 Stephen Hall held the title of
artistic director.
To confuse the situation further, the
general manager is as often as not the
artistic director. General managers
whom Oxenbould has known well in-
clude Donald McDonald (1969-72),
John Winther (1973-77), Peter Hem-
mings (1977-79) and, since 1981, Patrick
Veitch.
The board of directors of the Austra-
lian Opera have always been as con-
fused as anybody about the nature of
artistic direction. The results have often
been explosive. Hemmings, Winther,
McDonald, Hall, Downes and Cillario
all left abruptly to the accompaniment
of stage thunder and squabbles in the
board room. A particularly farcical sit-
uation was reached in 1978 when Hem-
mings, Bonynge and the board all
claimed to be artistic directors.
As guardians of the purse strings, the
board has always had soul-searching
problems in balancing artistic endeavor
with economic reality. Winther and
Downes produced the most artistically
exciting period in the company’s his-
tory. That was followed by financial cri-
sis in 1976.
At such a time, the money-spinning
potential of Bonynge (with Sutherland)
seemed irresistible. Hemmings was
shipped in to help out, but wouldn’t or
couldn’t fit in with Bonynge, and was
shipped out again. The company was
left without a general manager and with
a musical/artistic director absent for
half the year. Artistic standards
declined. Another financial crisis
loomed.
Patrick Veitch was brought in to
clear up the mess. By the end of 1981 he
had unearthed an accumulated deficit of
$1.3 million. He had to sell opera like
soap to reverse the situation and did so
Moffatt Oxenbould: the opera’s stable pillar
NEVILLE WALLER
with single-minded determination. But
quality control was neglected. Only this
year did the truth begin to dawn.
In the new era of democratic social-
isation, the company came under in-
creasing attack for being an elitist dino-
saur whose massive public subsidies
could be better used elsewhere in the
arts. The company moved to improve its
image. In April it launched a major
campaign to re-establish itself in Mel-
bourne. In May it took up its respons-
ibilities towards Australian composers
for the first time since 1974. In June it
introduced new concessions for stu-
dents and the unemployed, and a cheap
stand-by scheme for the general public.
But the problem of quality control
remained. The Melbourne season drew
some uncommonly stinging critical at-
tacks. The same pattern began to
emerge in Sydney.
The Sydney season opened with yet
another revival of Verdi’s Nabucco, a
horror for this reviewer to behold. The
new production of the American musi-
cal Fiddler on the Roof fell somewhere
between a serious treatment and the
lightness and liveliness of touch it once
had on the commercial circuit. The new
production of Wagner’s The Rhinegold
was a complete fiasco.
The board of directors finally met on
June 22 to come to grips with artistic
problems. The Bonynges were informed
of the new decisions on July 4, the day
after their return, and were under-
standably upset, if finally understand-
ing. Oxenbould’s appoint-
ment as artistic director was
announced on July 5. His en-
deavors to improve matters
will be subject to the approval
of Veitch and the board.
On July 13, as if in celebra-
tion of a new era, the com-
pany came up with a strong
revival of Verdi’s La Traviata.
The visiting Romanian so-
prano Nelly Miricioiu, as
Violetta, put in a memorable
performance of vocal splen-
dor and dramatic conviction.
Richard Greager, as Alfredo,
warmed to her challenge.
John Pringle came up with an
intriguingly sensitive interpre-
tation of Germont. Stuart
Challender and the band did
much to heighten drama and
pathos. And for once a resi-
dent producer, John Wregg,
managed to keep the whole
show on the road.
It’s become difficult to con-
tact Oxenbould these days. He
always seems to be busy with
rehearsals. It might be many
years yet before he is free to
pen his piquant memoirs of
the Australian Opera. □

Fremantle gears up for the cup
Fremantle’s fishing fleet: soon to be joined by luxury yachts
PHOTOGRAPHS BY ROGER GARWOOD
Crowded Success Harbor: they will have to make room for more
By BRUCE STANNARD
CONTRARY to popular belief the de-
fence of the America’s Cup does not in-
spire overwhelming joy in every Austra-
lian breast. There are those in Fre-
mantle who feel much the way General
Gordon did just before things got sticky
at Khartoum.
There is a sense of apprehension
tinged with excitement and not a little
dread as the realisation dawns on ordi-
nary people that soon their lovely,
sleepy little garrison will be invaded by
not only a horde of gawking tourists but
also an international armada of luxury
yachts and an army of cheque-book-
wielding tycoons, the likes of which are
seen rarely outside the pleasure domes
of Cannes, Monte Carlo or Newport,
Rhode Island.
Today, in Fremantle’s picturesque
fishing boat harbor, the honest, func-
tional shapes of the cray boats nod at
moorings soon to be shared with some
of the most opulent private vessels that
conspicuous consumption has con-
trived.
Whether the 23,000 -people of Fre-
mantle like it or not, Australia ll’s his-
toric America’s Cup win has set in mo-
tion an unstoppable money-laden jug-
gernaut, the arrival of which, in the
summer of 1986-87, promises social and
physical change on a scale undreamed
of in Australia since NSW’s ambitious
Governor Lachlan Macquarie dared to
use so much of the British Exchequer’s
cash in attempting to create his splendid
vision of a Georgian Sydney.
Fremantle, perched on the edge of
the vast Australian emptiness, sits with
its stuccoed, pedimented and turreted
face set toward the trackless wastes of
the Indian Ocean. That sort of isolation
has bred a peculiarly fierce form of
parochialism. In a place where outsiders
(even those from that other city up the
Swan River) are likely to be viewed with
caution bordering on suspicion, the
prospect of such an international as-
sault is one that provokes a lively and
often heated debate.
Fremantle, one of the most success-
fully integrated cities in Australia, has
thriving Italian, Yugoslav and Portu-
guese communities that have given the
place an easy Mediterranean air. Many
of the Italians, whose fathers came here
with nothing more than their consider-
able fishing skills, are now multi-mil-
lionaires.
Mick Lombardo is planning a huge
restaurant complex by the fishermen’s
harbor while “Dhufish Joe” Rotondella
is reported to have paid $3.4 million for
Elders’ sprawling wool stores. But the
Italians, like a lot of others in Fre-
mantle, are reluctant to leap into enor-
mous capital investments because of the
not unrealistic fear that this may be our
only defence of the cup.
People are concerned that, despite
all the best efforts of the city council,
rapacious developers and get-rich-quick
merchants could turn the place into a
ghastly echo of the Gold Coast. No one
in Fremantle wants that.
“We will leave change for the sake of
change to all those ramshackle cities
over east,” said 80-year-old Bill
“Doozer” Hughes. “In Fremantle we
look to the future but we value the past.
We’re proud of it and we want to keep
it, America’s Cup or not.” Those words,
which echo the popular sentiment, carry
special weight, not least because Hughes
is Alan Bond’s father-in-law, prominent
in South Fremantle sport and politics
for half a century.
But far from adopting an isolationist,
head-in-the-sand approach, Fremantle
is grasping what may well be a unique
opportunity to save its precious archi-
tectural heritage and at the same time
propel itself into a future based on the
almighty tourist dollar.
A delegation from Fremantle’s
staunchly Labor city council went to
Canberra this month with a $5O million
wish list. The council wants free federal
money to meet the costs of Everything
from new drainage to streetscaping and
an ambitious plan to bury the ugly over-
head power lines which mar so much of
the elegant, neo-classical late-Victorian
and Edwardian architecture.
There are plans to restore many of
the elegant cast iron lace verandahs that
were once a feature of the city and es-
pecially of its 26 pubs, 18 of which are
in the centre of town. The city council,
which owns a good deal of the central
business district, is in an excellent pos-
ition not only to make money by leasing
its under-used shop fronts but also to
keep firm control over the activities of
the out-of-towners who are pressing al-
ready for permits for everything from
pizza parlors to moped rental agencies.
Fremantle’s mayor, Bill McKenzie,
is the first to rebut suggestions that the
city won’t be able to cope with the cup.
“We’ve got our heads screwed on the
right way in Fremantle,” he said.
“We’ve got a wonderful opportunity
here and we aren’t about to blow it.
“People complain that our decisions
aren’t made at a million miles an hour
but we’ve got an obligation, not only to
the people of Fremantle but to the
people of Australia. No one is going to
thank us if we allow Fremantle to be-
come as gaudy as, say, Blackpool.


Fremantle Harbor: pleasure and commerce combine in the port
City centre: solid limestone reflects the gold rush days
Given a helping hand from the Com-
monwealth, we can present a venue that
all Australians will be proud of.”
Indications from Canberra are that
most, if not all, the money will be forth-
coming over the next three years. It will
mean that Fremantle, which seems to
have slumbered undisturbed since the
heady days of the great Kalgoorlie gold
rush, will be locked in an architectural
time-warp calculated to delight both
tourists and residents.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Finance
Minister John Dawkins (who happens
to be the member for Fremantle) and
Tourism Minister John Brown are all
aware that the America’s Cup summer
and the lead up to it could yield a bon-
anza not only in profit but also in inter-
national prestige and national political
kudos. In three years, when Fremantle
is crammed with 24 cup challengers
from the United States, Italy, France,
Canada, Britain, Switzerland, New Zea-
land and Germany as well as five poten-
tial defenders, that $5O million price tag
may seem small indeed.
No one knows how many tourists
will journey to one of the world’s most
isolated cities but already estimates
from the West Australian Tourism
Commission indicate that there will be
one million visitors 400,000 from
overseas and 600,000 from interstate
in 1986-87.
Most of them are expected to stay in
hotels or in billeted or rented accommo-
dation in Perth or Fremantle. Bond
Corporation is building a triple-towered
rental complex known as Observation
Fremantle’s Mediterranean atmosphere: city boasts an ethnically integrated community
NOEL HOLLY
City on the coast at Scarborough, north
of the two cities.
The QE2, Oriana and Canberra are
expected to function as floating hotels
off Fremantle during the cup races in
January 1987.
As for the millionaires, many of the
heads of the four American and four
Italian syndicates have snapped up
leases on some of the more substantial
homes in suburbs such as Applecross,
Peppermint Grove and Mosman Park.
Others will be staying aboard their
luxury yachts.
Although the state government and
the Royal Perth Yacht Club are con-
structing a new $3 million marina to
help cope with the cup boats, space will
be at a premium. Those with the money
will get the berths.
Hard by the fisherman’s harbor, in a
pokey little office lashed by gale-force
winds and rain, sat 43-year-old Don
Wieringa, one of the many Fremantle
businessmen caught up already in the
multi-million-dollar American bid to re-
gain yachting’s Holy Grail.
In Wieringa’s hand was a personal
cheque for SUS 10,000 down-payment
on space at his dock for the $lO million,
36m yacht Texas oilman William B.
Packer is having built in New Zealand
so that he and his fellow New York
Yacht Club syndicate members can
watch the cup races in comfort.
Wieringa’s knock-about, no-non-
sense approach to business appeals to
the Texans, who include some of the
most powerful members of the NYYC’s
America II syndicate. When they saw
his Fremantle Boat Lifters’ site they
made him an offer he couldn’t refuse.
But to cement the deal they flew him to
New York, put him up in the NYYC’s
luxurious headquarters on Manhattan s
West 44th Street and made certain that
by the time their arch rival, San Diego
Yacht Club Commodore Dennis
i Conner, got to him there would be no
! wavering.
Wieringa tells the story. “Conner
! said: T don’t care what they’ve offered
you, we’ll double it. Name your own


price.’ I told him: ‘Look, I may loathe
the NYYC but these guys have been
nice to me. I’m going to stick with nice
people’.”
Those “nice people” are now paying
Wieringa to construct what will be the
most modern 12-metre campaign facili-
ties in the world, with room for a couple
of racing yachts, a tender, assorted
chase boats and a dockside office. Other
facilities, including a block of flats to
house the racing crews and a sail loft
and storage facilities, have been pur-
chased in Fremantle.
In October this year, the first of what
may well be three NYYC 12-metre
yachts will arrive in Fremantle with a
tender, various runabouts and six 6m
containers crammed with at least twice
as much sailing paraphernalia as the
Australian challengers took to Newport
in their 21-year pursuit of the Auld
Mug. The NYYC’s cup campaign,
budgeted at about SUSI 2 million, is to
be waged every summer for the next
three years.
The NYYC syndicate’s operations
manager, North Carolina textile manu-
facturer Arthur Wullschleger, has taken
a three-year leave of absence from his
companies to run the campaign.
“Our slogan,” he said, “is: ‘The Am-
erica’s Cup ... Don’t leave Perth with-
out it.’ I wouldn’t have taken three years
out of my life and travelled half-way
round the world if I didn’t think we
were going to take the thing home.
“We will be sailing our first boat in
Fremantle until the end of January.
Then we will take that boat home and
by then our second boat will be ready.
We will race the two of them all next
summer in the States.
“Next September we will come back
with two boats and sail all through the
Australian summer. Then both boats
will go back to the States and by that
time we will have a third boat ready. We
will choose the best two and campaign
them both at home and finally in Fre-
mantle.”
The same obsessive (some may say
paranoic) dedication is expected from
Conner and from the Aga Khan’s Ital-
ian syndicate. Indeed, any challengers
hoping to come close to the top Ameri-
can boats are bound to follow suit or
content themselves with the dreary
prospect of being also-rans in a game
where there is no second. □
FOOTBALL
How VFL finances copped a shirtfront
By TIM DUNCAN
IT’S BEEN a strange season. Until the
sixth round, real footy had more or less
wiped the game’s politics and finances
off the back pages in Melbourne.
Football writers retrieved old files
and looked up the spelling of antique
terms such as “handball”, “tenacious”
and “shirtfront”. “Player payments”,
“interstate draft” and “football social-
ism” were suddenly unfashionable.
We even saw speculation about
whether Tommy Hafey could teach
Geelong to kick long and whether the
game now was being played at such
speed as to halt the formation of packs
and thus reduce the probability that
some “gazelle-like” “kid of character”
might leap on to someone’s head and
pull down a screamer.
This indian summer was very short-
lived.
About the time that Professor
Geoffrey Blainey delivered his famous
speech which led to the debate over
multicultural Australia, the Melbourne
Cricket Ground trustees agreed to have
four international soccer games on the
hallowed turf on Sundays. Suddenly in
danger of losing the football vote, the
Cain Government capitulated and be-
gan to negotiate Sunday footy finals
with the VFL.
That win breaks a very long drought
for the frustrated VFL. Even more than
in the past, this season has seen the
structure and management practices of
clubs and the VFL placed under very
close scrutiny.
First came rumors that two or three
other Melbourne clubs might follow the
Sydney Swans interstate. Analysis

Collingwood’s David Cloke: (dropping the ball) a $185,000 transfer
Collingwood’s Geoff Raines (holding ball): enormous payment
showed why. Half the clubs in Mel-
bourne were more or less broke.
The push for Sunday football, relo-
cation of the grand final to the VFL’s
own ground at Waverley and for es-
tablishment of a national competition
sprung from the fundamental need to
extract the Melbourne competition
from imminent financial dis-
aster. All are agreed (when
conversation moves from the
comparison of Paul Salmon’s
cruciate ligament with Peter
Hudson’s dicky knee) that the
level of player payments and
transfer fees is beyond the ca-
pacity of many clubs to pay.
The analysis of the state of
VFL player payments that fol-
lows is inevitably incomplete.
All involved in VFL footy are
self-confessed experts and
The Bulletin thus far has been
unable to interview everyone.
Nevertheless, a trial selection
of the views of player brokers,
club managers and adminis-
trators produces a composite
picture of the player market
that is as close as a good
player’s experience of this
partly black market is likely to
be.
First, imagine that you are
a 24-year-old VFL star.
We’ll leave the special

Melbourne’s Peter Moore: the club change now paying off
Let’s imagine that you have played
for four seasons and that you have been
lucky. The surgeon has kept away from
your knees that means that he prob-
ably will continue to do so. Your knees
must be very strong, you must be very
lucky or you play in such a way that you
don’t expose that critical joint to on-
coming trains. No matter how
they have been conserved,
good knees are worth money.
Let’s also imagine that you
were zoned with a strong
club’s recruiting area. The
chances are that you showed
promise as early as by your
14th birthday. About that
time, your parents became
aware that the club was happy
to share their burden. Season
tickets and finals tickets
materialised. School fees be-
came lighter. Trips interstate
on teenage football tours ap-
peared. You and your family
developed club loyalty.
Finally, let’s assume that
you are a superb athlete; that
you can sprint, leap, recover
instantaneously after hitting
brick walls and that your co-
ordination between eye and
body is better than 99.9 per-
cent of boys your age.
The club decides to put
you on its junior list. It pays
for taxis to and from training.
It gives you a mouthguard, it
buys your boots and it pats


you on the head. One day, after you
have upstaged some regular player at
training, the club takes the plunge and
you go out fast, fit, young, keen and
scared to death. They might pay you
$250 for that game and you might al-
ready have worked four years, training
four nights a week plus Sundays. Other
players your age, without even one
senior game under their belts, might al-
ready have suffered knee, ankle, thigh or
jaw reconstructions.
By some miracle, you survive the first
game. And the next. And the next. For
that season, you will most likely be paid
by the game - at about a sixth the rate
of established players regardless of
whether you are a consistent match win-
ner.
Your value will rise if you don’t get
reported. Good temperament, just like
good knees, is worth dollars.
Early affiliation with a strong club
turns out to be a tremendous advantage.
After four seasons and only a broken
nose, concussion twice a season, a
chipped ankle and a dislocated should-
er to worry about, you have played in a
couple of finals series. In one of those
series the club won the premiership and
you were instrumental in the grand final
victory.
You are hot property.
You have six or seven playing years

ahead, you pay back old scores when
the umpire is not looking, you can play
with injuries and you can win grand fi-
nals. The club put you on contract two
years ago, protecting itself from pred-
ators. You got a low-key job, a meagre
lump sum paid in four instalments, and
about $350 a game. It may have totalled,
say, $lB,OOO from the club. Now, things
are different.
At the beginning of the 1984 season,
you hire a lawyer to negotiate with the
club on your behalf. Aware that your
value may rise still further, you instruct
him to come up with a two-year con-
tract. He charges you about $5OO for sit-
ting down with the club manager who is
making about $50,000 (some, including
VFL administrative salaries, go as high
as $BO,OOO-a-year packages). The man-
ager' will have spoken with a $50,000 (at
least) coach and with an $BOOO part-
time club doctor or a $6OOO part-time
club physiotherapist.
The manager knows that you are a
club product, that you have club loyalty
and that you will not want to leave. The
lawyer knows what other clubs are pre-
pared to offer.
After some ceremonial bargaining,
you are called in and asked to sign a
contract which commits the club to pay-
ing you $35,000 for the 1984 season
paid in cash at six-week intervals
throughout it. As well, the lawyer has
negotiated some standard incentive
payments: $2OOO if your club plays in
the finals, $2OOO if you play 15 or more
senior games and $2OOO if you finish in
the top five in the club’s best and fairest
competition.
You also get a car to the value of
$12,000, signed over to your name
(which, in practice, turns out to be a
Until Now Only Pan Am Offered

$20,000 Volvo). Next year’s figures are
written into the contract, too.
In 1985, you will receive a flat pay-
ment of $40,000 with the same incen-
tives as this year’s.
You are 24 years’ old and you are a
star.
A less experienced mate at the club
negotiated a $20,000 lump sum with the
same incentives you got, on the basis of
half a season played in a key position in
1983. Another mate, whom the club is
prepared to put up for transfer, played a
few games over a couple of years for
only $ll,OOO each year. Some players
are getting more than you are but they
are five or six years older and the club
manager thinks that they are worth an
extra $lO,OOO to $15,000 a season.
Of course, your worries do not end
with the signing of the contract.
You have, in effect, given your coach
written authority to tell you to go out
and get your head kicked in. People
tend to forget that the debits in footy
contracts are measured in broken
bones, shattered joints, post-surgical
agony and lifelong arthritis.
Years of being called “chicken” for
having rationally decided to avoid the
imminent prospect of brain damage on
the other end of some opposing troglo-
dyte’s manic charge are on the cards. So
is the prospect of generating the hatred
of one’s erstwhile fanatical supporters if
one dares to contemplate a better offer
from another club.
Spruikers are not foiled by contracts.
Some clubs are prepared to pay in-
termediaries who can deliver post-con-
tract loyalties. (One club is reputed to
have offered a $25,000 brokerage fee for
two brothers.) Our 24-year-old star will
have to learn to sleep having refused
or accepted up to $lO,OOO in cash, to
be handed over in a paper bag, upon his
signing a letter of intent to join another
club upon the expiry of his contract in
1985. Perhaps 100 supporters pitched in
$lOO each; perhaps the predatory club is
desperate. In any case, it’s part of the
player market.
The other part of the player market
involves the money paid for players ex-
changed from one club to another.
Transfer fees have dropped some-
what this season, reflecting the decline
in the number of clubs which can pay
the fees that approached $200,000 early
last year. At that time Melbourne
bought Peter Moore and Kelvin
Templeton while Collingwood bought
Cloke and Geoff Raines. All these
players were commanding enormous
personal contract payments, with pack-
ages which insiders say went beyond
$60,000. Cloke’s package included a
liquor store dealership and is reputed to
have notched around $lOO,OOO. His
transfer fee was set at $185,000.
Collingwood this year transferred
Picken to the Swans for $135,000. Now
the clubs are trying to stay below the
$lOO,OOO level.
Buying expensive players is a tre-
mendous gamble. Cloke has yet to re-
produce at Collingwood the form that
helped win Richmond premiership
blazers. Picken, likewise, seems to have
had trouble in transition.
Melbourne got mediocre results
from Moore and Templeton last year
but the move seems to be paying off in
1984. If Melbourne’s experience is any
guide, the lesson is that the risk is worth
it if expensive stars are to be employed
in holding positions that younger home-
grown players are not quite ready for
yet. It is just too expensive now for a
club to buy enough players to achieve
the immediate success that North Mel-
bourne enjoyed in the mid-70s.
Hanging on to experienced players is
almost as much of a gamble as buying
them. Transfer fees do not come into it
but contracts do.
North Melbourne persevered with
veteran ruckman Gary Dempsey longer
than it should have done and its con-
tract commitment seems to have been
one reason for that.
It seems that the big transfer fees are

on the way out. If the VFL system were
closed, perhaps the transfers would
amount to little more than book entries
with clubs fine-tuning their sides on the
basis of fees circulating within the sys-
tem. But the fees have been leaking to
other states, mainly to Western Austra-
lia, and propping up the finances of
football outside the VFL. The Mel-
bourne competition cannot afford that
part of the player market any longer.
Player payments are less clear. For
our 24-year-old established star (and
there would be perhaps six like him on
the senior lists of most VFL clubs), the
market contract system works very well.
The other 90-odd players on the junior
and senior lists of each club risk teeth,
bone and tendons each week in part be-
cause they want what he’s got.
Yet, six of the 12 VFL clubs are
finding it very hard to finance contracts
like this. Perhaps, when it comes time to
re-negotiate at the end of 1985, our star
will wish that he’d told his lawyer to
produce a three-year contract.
There is talk of cuts to player pay-
ments perhaps by as much as 25 per-
cent but it is unlikely that the players
would accept such a cut if it did not also
apply to the well-paid coaches, man-
agers, administrators at the VFL and
club medical staffs. And, lacking special
legislation, cuts across the board require
the trust and foresight which are notori-
ously lacking in an organisation whose
constituent parts are dedicated to the
weekly destruction of each other.
Perhaps the recent disaster at St
Kilda may lead to a more moderate ap-
proach to payments. To avoid the liqui-
dation of the club, former players and
coaches who were owed money ac-
cepted 22 cents in the dollar. That’s
more expensive than a 25 percent cut in
salary.
Any 24-year-old star is bright enough
to work that out. □
Transplanting champions might not work
THE TABLE below suggests that the
VFL transfer market does not clearly re-
ward performance with price tags. With
the exception of John Annear, who was
running third in the Melbourne Herald
possessions award at the end of the 15th
round, and Geelong’s volatile Mark
Jackson, none of the widely-publicised
transfers cases in 1984 involved players
who subsequently turned in great sea-
sons.
As for the 1983 transfers, Melbourne
is on a winner with Peter Moore. David
Cloke, however, is having a lean season
at Collingwood. The conclusion seems
to be that transfers are risky when both
champion and mediocre players are
involved. Transfer fees for interstate
players now run to about $60,000, a fig-
ure lower than for many transfers with-
in the VFL clubs. Yet there is in Mel-
bourne strengthening suspicion about
the value of both VFL traded players
and interstate recruits.
Of the 240 players selected for senior
sides in the 14th VFL round this season,
50 had played with one or more club
while 54 came from interstate. Col-
lingwood last season and Richmond
this season have stuffed their teams with
purchased players. Yet Collingwood is
still not guaranteed a place in the final
five, while Richmond seems set to finish
close to the bottom of the ladder.
Richmond a couple of rounds ago
included 14 players purchased from
other VFL clubs or from interstate. Only
six players wearing Tiger colors that
day were once cubs at the Punt Road
nursery. Chief football writer at the
Herald, Mike Sheahan, listed them as
Greg Strachan, Phillip Egan, Jim Jess,
Dale Weightman, Mark Lee and
Matthew Hall. Five of those six are un-
doubtedly among the club’s best 10.
Lee, Egan and Jess are the only Rich-
mond players apart from Brian Taylor
who appear in the Herald’s player-of-
the year contender list.
By contrast, in the same round Mel-
bourne selected 13 players from its local
zone all products of renowned junior
coach Ray “Slug” Jordan’s football nur-
sery.
When Melbourne began to play its
home-grown youngsters, Melbourne be-
gan to win.

“WORMALD COUNTS ON
PERKIN-ELNER RELIABILITY ..
FROM ABU DHABI TO ANTARCTICA?
Denis Redfern. Manager, Wormald Data Systems.
If your company is considering upgrading
its computer facilities and wants a cost effective
solution, consider how Wormald Data Systems
and Perkin-Elmer Computers work together.
Firstly, consider the city of Sydney’s
Fi re Brigade a nd a f i re control system of over
7,000 fire alarms.
At the heart of this system, developed by
Wormald Data Systems, is a pair of Perkin-Elmer
32-bit computers.
Naturally in such a system, where lives and
property are at risk, the reliability of the hardware
is paramount.
Considertoo Melbourne’s Rialto Building
which upon completion will be the tallest
building in the southern hemisphere.
Wormald Data Systems are providing the
Rialto Building’s energy management, fire
detection, security and access control systems,
based around a Perkin-Elmer computer.
The fire protection system Wormald has
installed for the huge new Bayswater Power
Station is based around a pair of Perkin-Elmer
32-bit computers.
As are Wormald Data Systems designed
energy management, fire control and building
management systems, in a diverse range of
applications from oil wells off the coast of
Abu Dhabi, to research stations in Antarctica.
Wormald Data Systems have been building
their systems around Perkin-Elmer computers
since 1975.
And naturally, when you are providing a
product which has at its heart a component
manufactured by another company, you insist
that the other company’s component be
the best there is.
Because if that component fails to deliver,
it's you who are going to be losing orders.
Yet it stands to reason that Wormald
Data Systems chose to work together with
Perkin-Elmer.
For it was Perkin-Elmer who pioneered the
32-bit minicomputer-a breakthrough
that revolutionised the information industry.
Today, Perkin-Elmer is an acknowledged
industry leader with over 14,000 employees
worldwide, an annual turnover in excess of
$1 billion and a reputation for hardware reliability
which is second to none.
And that's exactly the kind of security
Wormald understands.
To find out how your company and
Perkin-Elmer Computers can work together,
you should call us on Sydney (02) 8871000,

The Shrimp
casts her net
in Cornwall
Jean Shrimpton and husband Michael Cox outside The Abbey in Penzance: a new life far from the cameras
By LUCINDA EVANS
IF THE 60s had a face, it was that of
Jean Shrimpton. In the years when Brit-
ain created a new pop culture and was
arbiter of taste and trends for the world,
her rather different look different
from all the models who had gone be-
fore and tall, slim figure dominated
the fashion pages: she became the sym-
bol of an era.
Today she has another name and an-
other life, as remote from her days as a
top model as London is from Land’s
End. She and her husband, Michael
Cox, own and run The Abbey, a small
hotel in Penzance.
“Down here people don’t give a
damn about me,” she says with satisfac-
tion. “I’ve been called Twiggy Shrimp-
ton, which about sums it up.”
“Jean likes a quiet, simple life,” said
her mother some 10 years ago. Now-
adays she has just that. The world of
Jean Cox begins and ends with The Ab-
bey, with Michael and their four-year-
old son, Thaddeus. If strangers come up
and ask whether she is Jean Shrimpton,
she tends to say no and that response is
truer than it seems.
She is the convent-educated daugh-
ter of a builder who became a farmer in
Buckinghamshire. Her parents had no
particular ambitions for her. “They
wanted me to lead an incredibly normal
life,” she says, “which would have
stifled me.”
On leaving school she took a Lucie
Clayton modelling course and was then
taken on as a model by that agency. She
met David Bailey while doing the
rounds with her photographs: “We
made an impact on each other physi-
cal attraction or whatever,” she says.
“In my life people have just stepped in
and pointed me in a certain direction. I
love change. I’ll jump in at lots of deep
ends.”
She claims that when she started
modelling she was “scruffy and gangly.
I’d turn up with this dog which was al-
ways being sick. I was a mess. But
Bailey wanted to use me and I think we
made an appealing young couple.”
However Evelyn Kark, who co-owned
and ran the Lucie Clayton agency, re-
members her as “very professional, al-
ways immaculate and she always turned
up on time. But she didn’t take model-
ling too seriously. For her it was all a
giggle. One always liked Jean. She was
easy to work with.”
The Shrimp seemed to embody the
new spirit of individualism and natural-
ness of the day. She worked under her
own name, washed her hair herself,
cleaned her face with soap and water,
kept fit by riding.
She is a restless person and after a
few years modelling lost its appeal. “I
got bored,” she says. “Being fiddled
with drives me mad. Also, I couldn’t
cope with getting a lot of money: I
didn’t want so much for doing some-
thing so trivial. I enjoyed it all for the
first year or so, then it became a strain
being the centre of attention. It is not
something I like.”
A romance with actor Terence Stamp
had ended. She began a love affair with


Shrimpton making a bed in the hotel: at first she and Michael did the chores themselves; now they have help
an American photographer named Jor-
dan Kalfus and moved to New York
where she embarked on a contract for a
major cosmetics manufacturer involv-
ing promotional work as well as having
photographs taken. But it all became
too much.
“I didn’t care a damn about the
product,” she said afterwards. “There
were times when I felt like crying out:
‘Don’t use it! Don’t put it on your face!’
But I couldn’t I was bound by con-
tract.”
She took stock of her life “Living
in an artificial world wasn’t what I
wanted” and began to edge away
from the Shrimp identity.
“When I came back from New York
in 1969 I was really screwed up,” she
says. “It was very predictable. I was
quite lost for a long period. It is very
hard to handle fame. Michael brought
me back together.”
From then on she cut back drasti-
cally on modelling work and by 1972
had given up the busy life of London to
disappear with a “strange and exceed-
ingly difficult” man known as Malcolm
the Poet. There were occasional sight-
ings in Wales where she started taking
photographs herself and later in
Cornwall where she opened a shop sell-
ing antiques: “I was fairly anonymous.
Dealers are obsessed with dealing. They
didn’t look at me. I liked that.”
She first met Cox in 1975 when he
walked into her antique shop in the vil-
lage of Marazion. He bought two vases
and walked out again. A year later she
had moved to another shop, in Truro,
and one day he appeared again. They
started talking. Four years younger than
her at 29, he was married and making a
living by restoring old houses and sell-
ing them.
She was living with Malcolm the
Poet and her relationship with Cox
started as a friendship. The two couples
met occasionally. They kept passing
each other on the twisting Cornish
roads and when she sold her cottage it
was bought by the Coxes.
A FEW MONTHS later Malcolm the
Poet went to join a Buddhist community
and soon after that Cox left his wife for
Jean. In a neat tying-up of loose ends,
his wife found happiness with someone
else within weeks. Jean and Michael
lived together until her divorce and
married early in 1979.
She is now 41. There are heavy lines
around her improbably sapphire-blue
eyes but she is still striking. Very tall
and long-limbed, she moves beautifully.
Because of her long body and bone
structure, her looks will never be de-
stroyed by age. Her brown hair is cut to
shoulder-length now, drawn back off
her face. She had evidently taken little
trouble with her appearance: it was a
statement of sorts.
She was wearing a blue-and-white
spotted skirt, an ageing black sweater,
bright red socks to the knee and curious,
curly-looking shoes much as a lepre-
chaun might have worn. She was direct,
forthright and entirely without affecta-
tion.
Looking back at her time as the
world’s top model, Jean Cox claims that
she “wasn’t ever very beautiful” and she
does not view the few physical changes
since that time as a problem. “I think it’s
a personal disaster if you think that,”
she says. “Nobody wants to get old but
it’s naive to fight too hard against it. It’s
undignified trying to arrest it.”
Although no prude, she has a puri-
tanical streak which colors her attitudes.
Money has never mattered much. She
says she never knew what she was earn-
ing in the headiest days of her career as

a cover girl (though she recalls being
paid a total of $lOO,OOO for her three-
year contract endorsing cosmetics
which is not a large amount compared
with the million-dollar contracts of
today).
For a time she was on the books of
agent Mark McCormack and says: “He
couldn’t believe it when I turned down
jobs worth lots of money.” Anyway,
none of the money she earned then is
available now; partly, it seems, because
she has been generous along the way.
The Abbey Hotel in Penzance was a
dilapidated old place which the Coxes
loved to visit in their first days together.
“It was so beautiful,” she says. “All run
down, in a marvellous way: full of old
ladies in hats . . . copies of Country Life
scattered about . . . some good an-
tiques.”
The place had a special significance
for them before there was any thought
of buying it. Cox first visited the hotel as
a child with his parents. In 1979 he and
his new wife celebrated their wedding
there with fish and chips and cham-
pagne. And today owning it marks the
realisation of a dream.
“WHEN 1 was pregnant with Thad I
was so ill I nearly died 50 years ago I
would have done,” Jean says. She had
fallen victim to a rare disease called
hyperemesis gravidarum. “It was then
that I heard The Abbey was for sale and
we decided to buy it. We paid $130,000,
borrowing money from both sets of
parents. When it became ours I was so
weak I couldn’t walk around it.”
They moved in when their son was
three months old and set about renova-
ting and decorating it themselves “We
couldn’t afford builders.” Cox had
earlier trained in hotel management and
had run a hotel in Somerset for four
years. To begin with they did all the ho-
tel work themselves but now have some
part-time staff.
A pale-blue building overlooking
Penzance harbor, The Abbey was built
in 1660 and substantially added to in
1820. It is small there are only seven
bedrooms and inside it does not look
like a hotel at all.
“Perhaps Chekhovian would best de-
scribe The Abbey experience,” says The
Good Hotel Guide 1984. One of its in-
spectors noted: “Chap downstairs
played viola for two hours it’s that
sort of place. Eccentric, stylish.”.
Looking back to the 60s Jean does
not feel any nostalgia. She rarely sees
the people she knew then, not even

THE ARTS
Forget the excitement:
pornography is boring
Sure, censors get to see a lot of things you don’t. But sitting alone in a theatre
watching a poor-quality movie is not all that stimulating, as former censor
MARY ROSE LIVE RAN I reveals.
CENSORS, like policemen, do not ex-
pect to be loved by the people paying
their wages. The best they can hope for
is not to be assailed by righteous
mothers or, increasingly, by members of
the women’s movement armed with
pamphlets on rape crisis centres.
Unlike police officers, however, cen-
sors do not follow in their fathers’ foot-
steps. Nor do they, when young, dream
of growing up to be a censor. What hap-
pens is that they wake up one morning
and find a reasonable salary being
offered for watching movies all day.
So they apply, painting some fantasy
of themselves as ideal censors, fabricat-
ing an identikit of normalcy: married
with two kids and a mortgage. Never
been a member of the Festival of Fight
or of the women’s movement. Only a
lukewarm libertarian. Not too old to
doze off in the middle of a movie or too
young to fidget when the action slows.
Fove movies but realise there’s lots of
junk to watch. Fove democracy and
curious to see how censorship works.
Short-listed candidates usually are
assembled to watch film cuts: material
that is excessively violent or indecent in
some way. Then they are required to
discuss the clips in the presence of a
psychologist. I jumped that stage for
some reason and went to the second, de-
scribed as a chat with the chief censor
and an official from Canberra.
During this chat, I was required to
deliberate on the following:
■ Would you ban an anti-semitic
film?
■ What is the greatest problem you
present to an employer?
■ What are your strengths, your
weaknesses?
■ What are you most proud of
having done in your life?
■ What do you think of the present
classification system? Are there any
films with whose classification you dis-
agree?
■ Do you see any differences in cen-
sorship for children and for adults?
When does a child become an adult?
And so on.
Appraisal by a psychologist is neces-
sary to protect the community from the
potential follies of a censor affected by
constant filmwatching. For instance,
American studies show that people who
view pornography for several hours a
week for a few weeks become less puni-
tive toward a rapist.
However, one censor on the board
was appealed to by a young relative
who had been attacked and raped in her
house. He had watched thousands of
rapes on film but nonetheless rushed to
her aid, comforted and supported her
during the months leading to the trial of
Censors see so few
good films that when
they walk past the
cinemas they view with
amazement all the
goodies offering.
the rapist and never once was heard to
utter any comment sympathising with
the girl’s attacker.
What happens when new censors
start work? First they have a look at
their workmates and discover an order
on the board: five men and four women,
ranging from 27 to 55 years of age. A
woman replaces a woman, a young cen-
sor replaces a young censor. They are a
fairly homogeneous group, diverse in
origins but reflecting the values of a lib-
eral humanist education. Politically,
they tend to favor the Fiberal Party but
there are usually one or two leftists to
balance the noise of friendly debate if
not the numbers.
Teachers are well represented, partly
because their salaries are in the same
range as the board’s and teachers can
return to employment more easily when
their contracts expire. Fikewise, young
public servants find a term on the board
to be a fillip to their careers. Older
people see it as an enjoyable end to their
working career. Nomads looking for ex-
perience relish its oddness.
Every censor is given copies of the
current guidelines to classification and
of commonwealth and state legislation
relating to film and video, since the
board not only registers films for the
commonwealth but also classifies them
for the states. It also services the Austra-
lian Broadcasting Tribunal by classify-
ing imported television material.
The guidelines tell the censor what
kind of visuals and language are per-
missible within a certain classification.
For instance, fuck is not allowed in
NRC and only in very rare circum-
stances on television. Implied inter-
course is allowed in M films if it is not
nude, full length and thrusting. If it is all
three, the film will be classified R. If the
sex is explicit, the film may now be
classified X. If the sex is fraught with
violence against an unconsenting vic-
tim, the film probably will be banned.
Frequency of shots, whether they are
long or brief, extra close-up or distant,
all have to be considered by new cen-
sors who work for a month before they
are allowed to write the reports now
available to the public justifying
classifications.
The guidelines are exactly that. New
censors can argue modifications to
them. Younger censors tend to be more
liberal in classifying material for chil-
dren, more conservative in the R to X
categories. Debate over classifications is
intense and on-going. Censors read
widely in the British, Australian and
American press about film-related mat-
ters, study changes in legislation, read
every letter from the public and study
reports of the effects of drugs, violence
and pornography on society laughing
madly at some of the conclusions.
Armed with the guidelines, the new
censor sits usually alone in one of
the eight theatres, crouched on a chair
that is ergonomically unsound, watch-
ing a clock that is always breaking down
and writing with a ballpoint pen that
will run out in the middle of a film that


usually will be porn. To relieve the bore-
dom he may chew wine-gums, file his
nails, rock backward and forward in his
chair or, occasionally, doze.
Censors see so few good films that
when they walk past the cinemas they
view with amazement all the goodies
offering. “Who saw that one?” they ask.
Unfortunately, good films often require
only one or two censors and the perks of
status ensure that the top of the board’s
hierarchy sees most of them.
Overseas material purchased by tele-
vision channels is screened in small
theatres. Sometimes good features are
bought by the commercial channels but
the censors cheer if they are rostered to
assess material for the ABC.
The chief censor determines how
many censors will watch a film. The de-
cision is based on the synopsis an im-
porter must attach to the application
for a film’s registration, as well as film
reviews and overseas classifications.
Where a censor has doubts about the
classification of a film and this hap-
pens quite often he will request a re-
screen and other opinions. If a film is
controversial the full board will see it,
sometimes more than once.
Re-screen day often is met with a
groan. Most re-screens though not all
are of poor films featuring pornogra-
phy or excessive violence.
All films re-screened are discussed at
the weekly board meeting where de-
cisions are debated and disputed, some-
times heatedly. The decision-making
process is not always rational. If a cen-
sor wants to pass a film with dubious
scenes he will defend the scenes on con-
textual grounds: if he wants the film out
he will use the calendar approach. This
stipulates that certain visuals an erect
penis before X ratings, for example, are
out no matter what the context.
These two strategies surfaced in the
debate on the anti-pornography docu-
mentary Not A Love Story produced by
the Canadian women’s movement. It
was classified R by the five women then
on the board and rejected by the four
men. The film contained hard-core sex
scenes normally rejected for classifica-
tion but the women censors substituted
the contextual or meritorious approach
for the categorical, rationalising their
approval of the subject. The men,
enraged by what they saw as the film’s
lack of balance, clung to the categorical
approach to keep it out.
Had there been more men than
women on the board at the time, the film
might well have been rejected. But in
that case, the Australian Film Institute
would very likely have appealed to the
Board of Review and won.
Decision-making on the board has in
the past been democratic. Each person
has had one vote and has used it as an
individual. Policy-making, however, is
the prerogative of the chief censor.
Outside pressure on censors is rare.
In the past four years, two foreign
governments have asked for films to be
banned but their requests have been
refused. The greatest pressure comes
from Australian film-makers wanting M
classifications for films that board mem-
bers might see as R. Where such films
have been financed by government
sources, individual parliamentarians
have written letters pleading the film-
makers’ cause. The board pays little at-
tention to this or to addresses by earnest
directors on the virtues of their film.
The greatest pressure on the board
today comes from the unholy alliance of
fundamentalists and feminists, the latter
having identified the film industry as the
community’s most powerful purveyor
of male supremacy propaganda. Once
again the old “tendency to corrupt and
deprave” argument has been taken out
of mothballs. Hopefully, however, the
women’s movement will let good sense
prevail and opt for education rather
than repressive legislation.
Then Australian film censorship will
continue to reflect, as it has been doing,
the passion for informed choice that is
integral to a vigorous democracy. □

“Today I believe most South Africans of all colours
desire a more just and equitable society” - G. W. H. Relly
Abridgement of the statement by Mr G. W. H. Relly, Chairman
of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.
The improvement of 9.3 per cent in group attributable profit
to R 554.1 million arises from an increase of R 45.6 million to
R 494.8 million in investment income; this was due mainly to the
higher distributions received from gold mining companies,
directly or via Anglo American Gold Investment Company.
Those higher dividends in turn were made possible by the
increase of 15.1 per cent, to R 474 an ounce, in the average rand
price of gold in 1983, which flowed from a 12.7 per cent
appreciation in the average dollar price, to $424, and a 2.7 per
cent depreciation of the rand. The fall in the dollar price since
then, to an average of $3Bl for the first half of 1984, has been
offset by the further depreciation in the exchange rate, the
rand price averaging R 479 an ounce.

The dollar price of gold has weakened for reasons similar to
those that have depressed most of the major international
currencies. The kernel of the matter is the strength of the US
dollar, resulting from the combination of high real interest
rates and its world-wide attraction as an investment medium.
In addition, sales of gold jewellery outside the United States
and Japan have declined owing largely to higher domestic
gold prices in countries where disposable incomes were under
pressure leaving more gold to be taken up in a market
characterised by investor indifference. So central is the metal to
South Africa’s well-being that the latest setback in the price, if it
persists for any length of time, will of itself leave the authorities
with no option but to tighten fiscal policy which would have
further adverse consequences upon growth. At this juncture,
however, it is as well to remember that the dollar’s value will
eventually be affected by the continuing US budget and
current account deficits, particularly if the cost of financing
them threatens to jeopardise the American recovery.
South Africa and World economy
The condition of the world economy, on which South Africa
trading internationally more than 25 per cent of its GDP is so
dependent, has changed significantly in recent years, mostly to
our detriment. We cannot take for granted that we will move into
the broad-based and sustained recovery in demand for our
exports that we experienced in previous cycles. Our manufac-
turing industries, for reasons unexceptionable in themselves,
are going to be required to adjust to protection primarily by way
of tariffs instead of quotas, at a time of intense international
competition which threatens to erode their share of the home
market and/or jeopardise their ability to expand into export
markets. Compounding the problem is the fact that in all but a
few cases our productivity is not as high as in countries at
a broadly comparable stage of development. For this we have to
blame, mainly, an historical neglect of education and technical
training and misdirection of the skills we do have.
Against an average increase of 63 000 jobs a year we have to
set projections of the growth in the economically active
population in the rest of this decade, which imply a need for job
creation averaging more than 300 000 a year. Agriculture can
do little to alleviate unemployment but there is no doubt that
the informal sector, given the proper stimulus, could make a
significant and cost-effective contribution to it.
Foreign investment
It is the more capital-intensive sector of the economy,
however, that will remain a major engine of growth and
employment creation in the longer term. That is yet another
reason why the issues of low productivity and the further
erosion of comparative export advantage have to be faced. In a
world that is growing both increasingly competitive and pro-
tectionist, we cannot afford policies which impair our fundamental
ability to pay our way. Failure to tackle the structural problems
in our economy will effect the flow of foreign investment to
South Africa just as surely as would heightened perceptions of
political risk. It would be a tragic irony if such investment, so
valuable to us still in terms of access to technology and
employment, were to become less attractive on account of our
relatively high costs, at a time when South Africa’s acceptability
overseas may be showing signs of improvement. Such improve-
ment will not, of course, diminish calls for disinvestment from
South Africa from people, particularly in the United States, who
simplistically condemn any steps that lead to the economic
upliftment of black South Africans as support for racism. Others,
believing that such important issues should be viewed
objectively, will ask themselves, inter alia, why the disinvestment
lobby has failed to win any support among the vast majority of
black South Africans whose interest it claims to represent.
Political developments
Tbday I believe most South Africans of all colours desire a
more just and equitable society. Mr P. W. Botha has chosen to
set the country now on a course of what might be called de-
centralised democratisation which, while it maintains a sub-
structure of racial self-determination, also appears to envisage a
superstructure of national co-operation. If Mr Botha can maintain
the thrust of his policy to embrace the urban black population
and then move to some federal system to embrace the country as
a whole, we may have reason to hope that these initiatives will
evoke the vitality and optimism to bring about a new era, with
profound implications for southern Africa as a whole.
Reform of our economic system will require no less courage
on the part of government, and from the private sector it will
require a greater commitment to the principles of private
enterprise than perhaps we have shown so far. The conflicts
and contradictions in our economic structure are too deep-seated
to lend themselves to easy and popular remedies.
Hard and difficult decisions have to be taken. Time is not on
our side; the pace of industrialisation in the Far East is proof of
that. Provided we are determined to maximise our economic
growth by removing or significantly reducing all obstacles to the
allocation of resources by the market uncomfortable for many
of us though that may be there is no reason why success
should elude us.
If we succeed in that aim, we shall also have succeeded in
another, without which the first is of limited usefulness. A more
whole-hearted commitment to the free market system cannot have
the required effect unless its benefits are freely extended to the
people who by law or custom are still denied full access to them.
Their willing and constructive participation will not be obtained
without concomitant advancement in political and social, as well
as monetary terms. Given that, we may then feel that the
foundations of our society are securely laid, for among the virtues
of the free enterprise system is one that surely is of special
relevance to all South Africans: that in decentralising decision-
making it decentralises political, as well as economic, power.

FILMS
Runyonesque
Allen on
Broadway
By SANDRA HALL
WOODY ALLEN seems to be develop-
ing his own brand of folklore. Last year
he gave us Zelig, a nonentity’s view of
recent history. And now comes
Broadway Danny Rose, a showbusiness
folk tale in which the grotesque mingles
cheerfully with the Runyonesque and
goodness is necessarily its own reward.
The story begins in exuberant style at
the Carnegie Delicatessen on New
York’s West Side. As the credits go up,
seven comedians are sitting around ap-
preciating one another’s impersonations
of the famous and reminiscing about the
worst acts they have ever seen a sub-
ject which leads naturally to the telling
of Broadway Danny Rose stories.
Danny Rose is an agent, celebrated
not for his successes but for the cal-
ibre of his failures. His are the star turns
no one else will handle one-armed
jugglers, one-legged tap dancers, blind
xylophone players and parrots who sing
I Wanna Be Me. Danny does his best
for all of them. No matter that the few
with promise move on to somebody
with more clout as soon as he
has their confidence up; he
has faith in every one, har-
anguing nightclub managers
on their behalf, buttonholing
talk show hosts and even
taking on himself the prob-
lems of their private lives.
With a talent for non-stop
talk and a desperate look in
the eye, he moves from one
petty crisis to the next, his
courage maintained by belief
in an elderly uncle’s child-
hood advice about the healing
powers of acceptance and for-
giveness.
The best Danny Rose story
concerns his management of
Lou Canova (Nick Apollo
Forte), a fat Italian singer
from the 50s making a come-
back at the Waldorf Astoria.
Danny has been dumped
once by Lou but naturally has
forgiven him and is ready to
do anything to get him a spot
on the Milton Berle show.
Lou, however, is in a bad way
distracted by a turbulent
affair with Tina Vitale (Mia Farrow), a
mobster’s widow with an uncompro-
mising manner and Mafia connections.
If Lou is to be at his best, Tina must be
at the Waldorf to hear him. Since Lou’s
unsuspecting wife also will be present,
Danny must be the one to take her.
The adventures which follow are
Runyonesque farce filled in with fast
talk and embellished with flashes of
pathos, offset by Allen’s frank, wonder-
ing and not entirely benevolent fascina-
tion with human peculiarities.
Riding back to the big-time on the
nostalgia boom, Lou has a voice some-
where between a shout and a whine, a
perspiring brow and a trick of throwing
a microphone from hand to hand (“I
taught him that,” says Danny, with justi-
fiable pride).
Farrow triumphantly playing
against type is decked out in ankle-
breaking stilettoes, a frilly blouse, a
bouffant and dark glasses. And Gordon
Willis’ black and white photography
serves up Danny’s gallery of clients in a
clinically unsentimental way which re-
calls both Diane Arbus and the harsh-
ness of Willis’ style in Allen’s Stardust
Memories.
Yet Broadway Danny Rose is a
softer, funnier and altogether more ap-
pealing piece than that bitter exercise in
self-absorption. It’s another of Allen’s
tributes to New York not to the
fashionable insider’s New York celebra-
ted in Manhattan but to its seedy, color-
ful underside. And it’s a tribute to enter-
tainers, with the tone established from
the first scene in the delicatessen.
The comics are off duty in a place
they have made their own and they’re
feeling expansive in a mood to com-
pete and compare. Each one is showing
off to his peers but also sharing memor-
ies with company well able to appreci-
ate affection.
As Danny, Allen is (as usual) playing
himself but this time it’s at* double
speed. He has a repertoire of emphatic
gestures which never quite match what
he’s saying and an unvarying line of
patter designed to get him past doormen
everywhere. When he and Farrow are
together, he bounces along at her side
like a nervous small dog not quite sure
where she’s going to take him next
just that, wherever it is, it’s going to
mean trouble.
Her character is something new in
Woody Allen heroines. There’s no trace
of Farrow’s fragility or her tentativeness
in Tina. Whether she’s being shot at or
sung at, she reacts with aplomb and an
eye for the main chance. Until she meets
Danny, she doesn’t know the meaning
of guilt. But he, of course, changes that.
I can’t say that it’s a blithe film. Allen
has been blithe only once in recent years
in the delightful A Midsummer
Night’s Sex Comedy (and that was writ-
ten off huffily as trivial by those who
prefer him austere). But Broadway
Danny Rose is a fond and funny salute
to some of the not-so-glittering aspects
of the Broadway tradition and its fol-
lowers. □

TELEVISION
Migrants in
the days
of Menzies
Christine Totos in The Young Wife: migration to an arranged marriage
By GERALDINE WALSH
FOR ABC drama to acknowledge the
existence in Australia of migrants other
than those of Anglo-Celtic origins has
been rare, although non-British settlers
received sympathetic treatment in the
Spring And Fall series as real human be-
ings and not only as stereotypes for the
amusement of dinky-di Aussies.
Putting cynical political consider-
ations aside, one of the justifications for
establishing Channel 0/28 was the
seeming reluctance of the national
broadcaster and the commercial tele-
vision stations to give those for whom
English was not their first language
a chance to see themselves portrayed
realistically.
Now that 0/28 is a reality, the ABC
is screening a three-part serial, The
Young Wife , which began this week. The
next episodes will be on July 31 and
August 7, following Nationwide. The
play is about the lives of some Greek
Cypriot migrants in Melbourne in the
early 60s.
Adapted for television by Linda
Aronson from a novel by David Martin,
the 50-minute episodes steadily chart a
course to inexorable tragedy.
The sad thing is that this worthy
drama could get lost in the general tone
of ABC programming. With the excep-
tion of Monday nights, when two Brit-
ish comedies drag a larger than usual
audience across to the ABC, and a
splash of Rumpole on Thursdays, the
run-of-the-mill ABC programming
tends to be “television to slash your
wrists by.”
Someone at the ABC seems to think
it’s non-intellectual to laugh that life
is grim and earnest and we out in
yobbo-land must never be allowed to
forget it. Only on Monday nights are we
permitted to laugh. We are even given
Terry and Arfur for good measure.
Laughing, it seems, should be done only
in blocks. That serious programs must
not be broken up by lighter ones looks
to be the policy.
The television adaptation of The
Young Wife has heightened, even exag-
gerated, the events and emotions in the
book. The characters love more intense-
ly, argue more fiercely and hate more
passionately. Perhaps that is necessary
in an age in which the average viewer
has come to expect the dramatic por-
trayal of life to be even larger than life.
Consequently, much of Martin’s irony
and gentle humor have disappeared but
the strength of the story holds attention.
The casting is skilful. The young
wife, Anna, played by Christine Totos,
is an uncanny representation both
physically and emotionally of the
character in the book. As the young
Greek Cypriot who arrives in Australia
in 1961 for her arranged marriage to a
Cypriot greengrocer, Totos acts superb-
ly. Olivia Hamnett, as the unhappy wife
of a middle-aged academic lothario, is
uncannily like her book character.
It would be far too superficial to ex-
plain The Young Wife as being merely
an exposition on a clash of cultures. The
different moral values inherent in tra-
ditional Greek culture and the Austra-
lian mores of the early 60s are import-
ant to the play but the basic human
emotions of jealousy, pride and guilt
and the eternal quandary of the rela-
tionships between men and women are
the stuff of which the drama is made.
Within this, another play is
rehearsed and performed Euripedes’
Alcestis, a story of a wife who is so un-
selfish that she is willing to die for her
husband, Admetus. The gods have
agreed to spare his life if he can offer up
a substitute mortal.
Others in his family turn down this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sacri-
fice themselves for him but not so the
noble Alcestis.
With this device, Martin has drawn a
subtle allegory in the mainstream story
of Anna, her husband Yannis and their
very good-looking young friend Criton.
The Young Wife has all the ingredi-
ents to be a cheap melodrama an
older husband whose jealousy stems
from macho Greek pride; a blind, tyr-
annical Greek matriarch; a middle-aged
Australian woman rejected by her
young Greek lover; a shady but wealthy
brother-in-law. Fortunately, it doesn’t
succumb to being a suburban version of
Dallas or Dynasty.
For some inexplicable reason, a
character who isn’t in the novel is in-
serted in the play. Lystra, a casual em-
ployee at Yannis’ greengrocery, has
more than her fair share of problems.
She has three young children and an un-
employed husband. She’s pregnant and
can’t afford to give up the job to have
the baby and care for it. Nor can she
afford the £BO quoted for a safe medical
abortion. She resorts to a backyard
abortionist after long and emotional ar-
guments with Anna about the moral and
religious rights and wrongs of termin-
ation.
The acting and the script are con-
vincing and subtitling is used sparingly
but effectively. The usual narks will
complain about a foreign language be-
ing spoken on the ABC.
There are flaws. Director Oscar
Whitbread has a habit of herding the
characters into corners of rooms with-
out establishing shots that give the
viewer an overall sense of location and
the editing is hard to fathom at times.
We are given flashes of a soccer field,
then of a kitchen for a few words
then back to the main action. Often it
seems to be for no reason other than to
reassure the audience that, at any given
time, the rest of the characters are alive
and well.
The Young Wife is not a drama to
watch if you’re feeling down but for
those in a normal frame of mind it will
hold their attention with its strong story
and faithful re-creation of Melbourne in
the Menzies era. □


BOOKS
A woman’s
lot warts
and all
By MARY ROSE LIVERANI
The Weaker Vessel: Woman’s Lot
In Seventeenth-Century England,
by Antonia Fraser. Weidenfeld and
Nicolson, London, $29.95.
RARELY does a work of research,
loosely ordered and crammed with fact
rather than special insights, heavy on
data and light in analysis, arouse heav-
ing emotions. But Antonia Fraser’s
latest work, a melancholy tale of
woman’s condition in England in the
17th century, does just that. The emo-
tions are horror, indignation, rage -
and gratitude for having been born well
into the 20th century; hang the nuclear
threat!
The Weaker Vessel, a pious euphem-
ism for women overhung with the re-
ligious sentiments that dominated 17th
century England is a reminder of
what was woman’s lot until quite recent-
ly: her arrival at birth second-best to a
boy, her education ruthlessly restricted
by men to ensure that she did not be-
come too “cunning,” her exclusion from
various fields of endeavor, her econ-
omic dependency, the need to market
her charms, her exposure to death from
relentless breeding and the persecution
of the poor and aged among her sex,
much of it being laid at the feet of the
sinful Eve.
Fraser delves into household ac-
counts, family letters, notebooks, diar-
ies, memoirs, women’s petitions, stat-
utes and a plethora of secondary
sources to upturn novel particulars pre-
viously ignored by writers and histor-
ians.
The women she brings to the fore are
mainly of the gentry or the aristocracy
but this, one suspects, is not because she
is upper-class (the daughter of Lord
Longford) but because few records of
17th century lower-class women are
available. Few poor women could read
or write and if they aren’t represented
among the portraits in the book it is be-
cause they could not afford to be done
in oils.
The single most horrifying situation
described in Fraser’s work, however, re-
lates to lower-class women those
judged to be witches. Beauty, according
to 17th century thought, was the direct
Antonia Fraser and children: 17th century women endangered by relentless breeding
expression of virtue. Ugliness was
equated with evil. So when the lower-
class women often without family be-
cause the death rate was so high among
both sexes, destitute because of changes
in the Poor Laws and living alone with
cats for company were seen to be
afflicted with wens or warts or other
such growths as sometimes accompany
age they were judged to be consorting
with the devil, their growths serving him
as teats. Men in the same situation, how-
ever, were elevated to the status of
“white” wizards free, it seemed, from
the sexual importunings of a devil who
was not in the slightest way gay. Like-
wise, upper-class women escaped the
label of witch warts or no because
of their property, effective as a crucifix it
seemed in warding off the devil’s atten-
tions.
Little wonder, therefore, that the
passion for property is one of the
dominating themes in Fraser’s book. A
single woman without property might
well cringe before what lay ahead.
Pepys recognised this when he gave his
25-year-old unmarried sister a small
dowry and heaved a sigh of relief to get
her married off, even to a twerp.
Pepys is widely quoted through the
book, probably because he wrote so gar-
rulously, but his antics and attitudes
highlight some aspects of the female
condition in his era.
His constant philandering had to be
borne stoically (though not silently) by
his wife not only because another man
might be hard to find but also as divorce
was almost impossible except for the
very rich. The ecclesiastical substitute,
that a woman could quit her husband’s
bed and board (without remarrying),
meant that she had to forego the proper-
ty her husband had taken into his name.
The passion for property directly ac-
counted for early, almost childhood,
marriages foisted upon upper-class
women by ambitious fathers often in-
different to the sanity or scruples of pro-
spective bridegrooms. Such women
could look forward to 30 years or so of
unremitting pregnancy if they
survived parturition or, if they were
really lucky, to young widowhood when
they got all the property. Then the local
widowers would be after them in full
cry.
The great escape for women was to
the convent and, for that, they had to
travel abroad. Protestant women did
not even have that option.
Of course, there were outstanding
women in the century who defied con-
straints and paid heavily for their inde-
pendence. Quaker women, encouraged
by their creed to vocalise their “inner
light,” belabored local authorities (men)
and were beaten or imprisoned; women
writers were savagely lampooned by the
wits of their day; struggling education-
ists trying to liberate women from ig-
norance saw their efforts come to
nothing...
Nearly 500 pages of lament but a his-
tory, nonetheless, not a polemic.
Fraser’s sympathies are with women but
also with good men. She may leave no
area of female wretchedness unreported
but she also cites instances of married
couples passionately devoted to one an-
other, of men who encouraged their
wives, daughters or sisters to educate
themselves or engage in commerce. And
the closing years of the century, so she
records, saw at least some progress for
women: the last trial for witchcraft was
held in England in 1685 and women
were allowed to act on the stage not
long after. Admittedly, they also were
expected to dispense sexual favors after
hours but at least a profession was
opening up.
The Weaker Vessel is structurally a
kind of petit point, a minute stitching
together of hundreds of women and
their families, including just about all
the noble families of England. Of 25


pages of index, more than 90 percent of
references are to personal names rather
than to concepts or events.
The anecdotal approach gives the
book a gossipy vigor and, if it lacks the
sustained character interest of the bi-
ography which Fraser normally writes,
the constant shuttle to and fro between
various members of a family provides a
compensatory unity.
The Weaker Vessel may not be seen
protruding from the oxters of radical
feminists in the way of The Female Eu-
nuch but we owe a debt of gratitude to
Fraser for her 12-year labor. □
Stow brings
evil back
into fashion
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
The Suburbs of Hell, by
Randolph Stow. Seeker and
Warburg, $17.95.
RANDOLPH STOW always has had a
passion for the blacker plays of the less-
er-known Elizabethan and Jacobean
dramatists. Shakespeare could out-mur-
der and out-horror the best of them but
in Kyd, Webster, Tourneur and
Marston there was an ingenuity in the
relationship between villains and death
that was saved from absurdity only by
the intensity of the poetry spoken by the
characters.
In his new book, Stow uses a number
of quotations from these old plays to
hint at what the reader is to expect.
Stow is as much a poet as a novelist;
a dangerous combination but not a fatal
one, as Hardy and Lawrence showed.
One could say that The Suburbs of Hell
was conceived by the poet and brought
to birth by the novelist. Dialogue,
character and observation are the
crispest and most assured he has
achieved.
There is ample proof of this in the
first few pages. In an East Anglian pub,
“Here and there the more formal uni-
form of a pilot added the touch of class
which the Speedwell’s landlady was al-
ways pleased to see.” Of the near-hero
of the book, Harry Ufford: “He smiled
his open country-boy’s smile, not in
hypocrisy, but because that was his way
of dealing with friction, for a while. He
did sincerely think the best of people,
till the moment when something de-
manded to be done.”
And Harry again: “‘I like most
people till they teach me different. Far
as I’m concerned, the whole hooman
race is on probation’.”
The local dialect is deliberate but not

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE ON EXPENDITURE
INQUIRY INTO
ASSISTANCE TO THE ARTS
The Expenditure Committee in the 33rd Parliament has decided to resume the Inquiry into
Commonwealth Assistance to the Arts which was commenced by its predecessor in November
1982.
The purpose of the inquiry is to review the efficiency and effectiveness of Commonwealth
Government expenditure on Assistance for the Arts. Particular attention will be given to
• The procedures for the allocation and distribution of funds available for the Arts through the
Commonwealth Budget;
• The impact of present level and allocation of expenditure in achieving Commonwealth policy
objectives;
• Changes in the organisation and delivery of financial assistance that would be required for
improved efficiency in administration and effectiveness in achieving policy objectives;
• The appropriate role of the Commonwealth in funding the Arts and the Commonwealth’s
relationship with other tiers of government funding for the Arts.
The review will focus on financial issues and funding matters within the Arts. It will, therefore,
encompass the programs and activities of organisations such as the Australia Council, the
Public Lending Right Scheme, Artbank, the International Cultural Corporation of Australia and
the Commonwealth contributions to the Australian Ballet Development Fund.
The Committee wishes to obtain the view of as wide a range as possible of individuals and
organisations with an interest in the Arts.
Interested persons who did not make a submission following the initial advertisement of the
Inquiry in November 1982 are invited to lodge written submissions by no later than 30
September 1984 with:

forced. This is as local a book as, on the
other side of the world, was The Merry-
Go-Round in the Sea. There is a subtle
jest here, typical of the quiet Stow, for
the murders chronicled in this book,
taking place in a town on the coast of
East Anglia, are based on the killings of
the Nedlands Monster who terrified
Perth 20 years ago.
Murder is international and where it
takes place is primarily in the mind that
conceives it, as Webster understood.
Stow takes his title from two superb
lines from Webster’s play The Duchess
of Malfi : “Security some men call the
suburbs of hell,/Only a dead wall be-
tween.”
The narrator, who also is the murder-
er, is allowed as in an old play the
interludes between the chapters, es-
tablishing his compulsive madness from
the beginning. “It is not envy or any-
thing of hatred that brings me again to
this little place in the mist which I have
known so long and wished no harm to
... No; it is never hostility or malice.
Simply, it is correction, or chastising.”
After the first senseless murder of an
amiable, rather feeble young man, the
drinkers in the pubs are fertile with sus-
pects. The victim’s unemployed PhD
brother; the black taxi-driver; even
Harry, an old sailor, patently a good
man. The reader is allowed an outsider’s
suspicions of Frank De Vere, clearly a
nasty man.
Of course, in an Agatha Christie
story the nice people are always sus-
pects too. However, in The Suburbs oj
Hell they are murdered so fast there is
soon hardly anyone left.
This is no Agatha Christie or civi-
lised Michael Innes whodunit. Stow is
using random horror, familiar as head-
line-evil, to break down the walls of the
cosy suburban home where the murders
are all on TV.
There are a number of vivid charac-
ters in The Suburbs of Hell, distinctive in
their speech without being folksy, but
by far the most attractive and memor-
able is Harry Ufford; it is a rare portrait
of a good man. Harry looks after young
men in trouble, the animals of the mur-
dered and himself. He is a comfortable
man in a pub and he does not pay duty
on his home comforts, being an old and
successful smuggler.
For some time evil has been out of
fashion, left in a technical way to the
religious. But recently some psychol-
ogists and historians have been brush-
ing some of the dust off Satan’s cloak.
Stow’s achievement is that evil
broods convincingly over the easy re-
alism of this book, the poet watching the
novelist and making sure he gets it right.
The suburbs of hell stretch a long way.
“Why this is hell, nor am I out of it”
might have been another Elizabethan
quotation added to Stow’s interludes. □
BOOK BULLETIN
A Gallant approaching
by Patricia Rolfe
WHEN Mavis Gallant comes next
March as the 1984 recipient of the Can-
ada/Australia Literary Award she will
represent something not unfamiliar
here: the expatriate who returns home
to an uncertain, sometimes acrimoni-
ous, welcome. Gallant has lived in Paris
for 30 years and is best known as a
short-story writer, notably for The New
Yorker, although her journalism is out-
standing. She is currently writer in resi-
dence at Massey University.
Thomas Shapcott, who was the re-
cipient in 1978, says that Gallant, of
somewhat uncertain temper, was well
able to defend herself against compat-
riots’ attack. Her last book published
here was From The 15th District, from
Cape in 1980, and it is possible that little
of her work is currently available here.
Saul Bellow: stories almost light relief
SAUL BELLOW’s new collection of
stories, Him With His Foot in His
Mouth, coming from Seeker and
Warburg in September, is almost light
relief after recent novels. The title story
is about a musicologist who is, as the
Arabs say, a hostage to his tongue but
he seems more often to say the sort of
thing we wish we’d thought of rather
than what he should not have. To a
woman companion who apologises at
the end of an evening, “I realise now
that I monopolised the conversation. I
talked and talked all evening,” he
replies, “That’s all right. You didn’t say
a thing.” Seekers are also putting out the
first uniform edition of Bellow’s work.
WAR BOOKS continue as one of the
strongest segments in publishing. Col-
lins, judging that the possibilities of
World War I are nigh exhausted, are
moving on to the official history of
World War 11.
The 16 volumes, Australians in the
War 1939-45, were published originally
by the Australian War Memorial, the
last coming out in the mid-19705. Stocks
are now almost run out.
Collins will do the navy, army and
air force volumes but will pick and
choose among the civil and medical
titles. They will do the two civil vol-
umes, Tlie Government And The People,
by Paul Hasluck.
Michael McKernan, director of re-
search and publications for the mem-
orial, believes the history should be
back in print but says that the $1 million
he estimates it will cost is beyond the re-
sources of the memorial. “We have
trouble with finance,” he said.
“Treasury doesn’t seem to know the
difference between us and the Anzac
Memorial in Hyde Park.” McKernan
found when he went to the memorial
three years ago from the University of
New South Wales that the official his-
tory was still selling at $4.50 a volume
because the price had been set at 45 shil-
lings in the 19405.
PETER LENGYEL, whose resignation
from UNESCO is seen, by those who
see turmoil everywhere, as further evi-
dence of turmoil in that organisation,
does lead a double life. He is the author
of the most popular book in France on
Australia, the sort you pick up at the
airport.
Under the name of Peter Michaels,
he published Australie in 1964 and has
updated it several times since. Outlining
the dismissal of the Whitlam Govern-
ment in 1975 he described the current
ambassador to UNESCO, Gough
Whitlam, as a “man of both moral and
physical stature.”
LANSDOWNE PRESS will follow its
highly-successful complete, two-volume
A. B. (Banjo) Paterson venture last
Christmas with The Complete Works of
Henry Lawson, in two volumes, in Sep-
tember. Print run is 55,000 and recom-
mended retail price is $59.95.
Lawson’s original publishers, Angus
and Robertson, published Henry
Lawson: The Master Story-teller last
April and say it is selling strongly. This
might take an edge off the market for
Lansdowne but Henry is still making so
much money for publishers that we
should take his face off the $lO note and
put it on the $lOO. □

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
A National Trust for our slang
THE AUSTRALIAN accent is cher-
ished around the globe now. There was
a time when all ABC announcers had to
speak like relatives of the royal family
and if any unfortunate Australian were
to appear on the international stage he
had to learn to speak all over again, do-
ing awful things such as freeing his
nasal passages and opening his mouth.
Not any more. Barry Humphries and
Paul Hogan have helped to spread our
culture. Since Hogan has been doing
ads for the Australian Tourist Commis-
sion in the US, phrases such as “G’day”
and “Putting a shrimp on the
barbie” have crept into the
American language.
I don’t know whether elo-
cution lessons are available in
1984 but, if they are, no doubt
children are being taught to
acquire the eloquent tones of
Bob Hawke or the flat menace
of Norm Gallagher as part of
our new spirit of nationalism.
It is comforting that our
language is being recognised
in the loftiest places. Oxford
University Press produced its
first Australian Pocket Oxford
Dictionary in 1976. This week
it launched the second
edition, revised and complete
with all the latest Australian
slang.
It is so up to date it includes “bot-
tom of the harbor,” which is described
officially as “an Australian tax avoid-
ance scheme.” There are the latest ill-
nesses such as tenosynovitis and AIDS.
Those rich Australian cultural events
the trifecta, the quadrella and the
quinella are there. What’s more, the im-
portance of the TAB is explained with
lines on how to use it: “Totalisator
Agency Board, branch or agency of the
TAB (the TAB is opposite the Post
Office, here are the TABs for race five”).
It was nice to see our deli win recog-
nition. That’s “a small shop open for
long hours selling perishable goods,
newspapers, etc.”
They also have granted Oxonion
blessing to pasty not the Cornish var-
iety but a “small round covering for
striptease dancer’s nipple.” Funny, I
would have spelt it p-a-s-t-i-e but then I
didn’t think the girls wore them any
more.
Then there’s ocker. This is a vital
word, utterly descriptive of a certain
genus Australian, but it has been in gen-
eral use for little more than a decade
and its origins are explained in-
adequately. The Oxford says: “Boorish
person; someone who is aggressively
Australian in speech and behaviour,
often for humorous effect. Orig. uncer-
tain. Perhaps from character in a series
of TV sketches by Ron Frazer.”
The 1976 edition said “Orig. uncer-
tain; perh. orig. a nickname for persons
with such surnames as O’Connell &
O’Connor, or alt. of Oscar.”
Ocker is so new it did not make any
of the famous works on the Australian
language by Sidney J. Baker. Yet a year
before he died I called Baker to ask him
what he knew about ocker. He was in
favor of the Oscar theory. He said in the
20s and 30s Oscar came into vogue as a
trendy name to give a child, maybe in
honor of singer Oscar Asche.
But the young peers of all those
Oscars found the name just too much,
maybe even a bit pansy, so it got con-
verted to Ocker. It shocks one, doesn’t
it? The thought that ocker might have
gay overtones.
All the classic Australian words are
in the Oxford, from bonzer to cattle
duffer. Regrettably, only the modern
version of screw is printed. It has been
destroyed by the Americans. The dic-
tionary says: “Screw: act of copula-
tion.” When I was a child screw was
money, the salary you earned. In my
innocence I remember asking an Ameri-
can girl what screw she earned. She
burst into tears.
Blue, of course, is there. What a won-
derful, subtle word is blue. It can be a
summons, an error of judgment or a
fight. You can bung on a blue. On the
other hand, a bluey can be a swagman’s
bundle and Bluey is the compulsory
name for anyone with red hair.
Many of the words in the dictionary
come under the “Quaint” heading. Aus-
tralians tend to use them when they are
being aggressively ocker in London or
at the Munich Beer Festival. They be-
long to an era two generations ago and
some go back to C. J. Dennis.
For some time I have been urging
that such words should be part of the
responsibility of the National Trust.
They should receive gradings: A, to be
preserved at all costs; B, an endangered
species; C, noteworthy.
Bonzer and bobby dazzler
are not in general use by the
young. They should receive an
A grading at once.
Bosker, a variation of
bonzer, is in the dictionary
but, alas, bosker like
boshter is extinct; very
early Sentimental Bloke and, I
fear, beyond repair.
But turps is there; a won-
derful word and an endan-
gered one. So too is “Come
the raw prawn,” one of the
most gloriously descriptive
lines in the ocker repertoire.
The Oxford defines it nicely:
“Attempt to deceive someone,
esp. by pretending innocence
or lack of knowledge.”
Chunder made it. I don’t think I
want to give a grading to chunder but
how about “Drinking with the flies” for
drinking on your own; I mean “On your
Pat Malone.” Surely it is worth a C.
Perve is there “an erotic gaze”
and so too is togs. We must do some-
thing to preserve togs. There is a dread-
ful tendency to refer to them as swim
suits. And they have honored ging, a
catapult. Heavens above, we used to
adore our gings but no kid under 30
would know what one was. An A.
The Oxford found some good old
names for prostitutes: a chromo or a
Mallee root. Save those. Then there’s
going butcher’s hook and getting
lemony. I haven’t heard anyone get
lemony for years but I like it.
Oh, we could go on about whinge,
stoush, shivoo, sheila and even the town
bike. Or how about the subtleties of
grouse? You can have a grumbling
grouse or things can be extra grouse,
which means in true Oxford terms
“absolutely first class.”
Another A. Form a branch of the
Ocker National Trust now. □

A burning question for the church
PHILLIP ADAMS
A FEW days back, one of Britain’s most
majestic cathedrals, one of God’s medi-
eval skyscrapers, came to grief. York
Minster was smote by lightning, the
thunderbolt turning ancient beams into
kindling.
The sacred precincts were turned
into a parody of hell as stained glass
images melted like colored toffee and
molten lead poured down on the scurry-
ing, treasure-salvaging clergy. Bibles
burned and pews blistered while, below
in the crypt, the ancient tenants were
roasted in their tombs. Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
Having just spent millions on restor-
ation, the parishioners were puzzled by
the justice of this act of God. Mean-
while the police were discounting the
possibility of arson provoked by the
consecration, just hours earlier, of a
controversial new bishop.
Just before claiming crook and
mitre, the bishop, the Right Rev David
Jenkins, had confessed that he didn’t
believe in the virgin birth or in the
physical resurrection of Jesus Christ,
thus infuriating a large part of the mem-
bership of the Church of England.
The Rev John Mawll, who had been
frog-marched from York Minster after
protesting against Jenkins’ promotion,
said: “I believe God acts in this world.
Who can say whether God intervened in
this case or not?”
For some, the blaze was God’s judg-
ment on the bolshie bishop; images of
the Almighty leaning over a thunder-
cloud to drop a disapproving depth
charge.
All of which persuades me to relate
one of my favorite historical, theologi-
cal anecdotes; a sort of atheist’s para-
ble. It concerns lightning, churches and
the first civilised American; Republi-
can, rationalist and scientist, Benjamin
Franklin.
The term scientist is a modern one.
Until Franklin’s time such men were de-
scribed as natural philosophers. They
would cogitate, experiment, discuss and
publish but in a studiously impractical
manner. The idea of technology
translating a scientific idea into a practi-
cal product was virtually unknown.
Indeed, it can be argued that Frank-
lin’s breakthrough, the lightning con-
ductor, was the first tangible expression
of science, the first technological prod-
uct to be offered to the market. And it
was a product that would bedevil the
Christian church.
Franklin (1706-1790), American
York Minster ablaze: a lightning rod would have foiled an act of God
printer, author, publisher, inventor,
scientist, public servant and diplomat,
was interested in heat and light, sound
and magnetism, hydrostatics, chemistry,
geology, physiology, psychology,
oceanography, women and revolution,
not necessarily in that order.
But he is remembered best for his en-
counter with electricity. While his orig-
inality may have been exaggerated
(there were experimenters aplenty in
Europe) Franklin’s hypotheses about
electricity were the most sophisticated
and he invented many of the terms
which we use in discussing electricity
today: for instance, positive, negative,
battery and conductor.
Whether or not his experiment with a
high-flying kite in an electrical storm
was authentic or apocryphal, there’s no
doubt that Franklin conceived the idea
of the lightning rod. And this, as they
used to say in The Goon Show, is where
the story really begins.
For centuries, churches and cathe-
drals had been blazing merrily not be-
cause of arson by atheists but because of
highly-embarrassing acts of God. In
every village, in every city, the church
was the tallest building. Enspired to in-
spire, its up-thrusting architecture was
at once pious and pompous, pointing at
the heaven of its patron.
However, many of the most beautiful
cathedrals caught fire regularly, a phe-
nomenon that was hard for priests and
vicars to explain from their singed pul-
pits. If the church was the house of God,
why did he keep burning it down? Why
not vent his spleen on the pub or the
brothel?
Well, by observing storms, Franklin
was able to find the answer. And when
he proffered his lightning rod to the
world, businessmen and farmers
embraced it with enthusiasm.
But not the churches. The clergy
found themselves on the horns of a di-
lemma, if not those of the devil himself.
It seemed to them anomalous, perhaps
blasphemous, to deflect God’s wrath in
this way. And so a new era began, in
which secular buildings enjoyed the un-
failing protection of Franklin’s ingeni-
ous device while churches and
churches alone were burnt to the
ground.
Such was Franklin’s fame that when
he died all educated Europeans knew
the epigram of Turgot, the French econ-
omist: “He snatched the lightning from
the skies and the sceptre from the ty-
rants.” And while he would be sad-
dened by the burning of York Minster, I
think Franklin would be amused by the
superstitious interpretations of the
tragedy.
But then, from the days of Galileo to
the current crack-pot controversy about
creationism, the Christian church has
not been always in the vanguard of
scientific thought. More often it has
been in the guard’s van, having discon-
nected itself from the Spirit of Progress
before being shunted on to some over-
grown side track. □

Malcolm eyes the situations vacant
DAVID M c NICOLL
WHAT IS Malcolm Fraser planning to
do with the rest of his life? It has be-
come apparent that he doesn’t intend to
sit around the paddocks sucking at
straws and counting sheep. In London I
found considerable discussion as to
what Mai had in mind. While I was
there he appeared for 10 minutes on the
BBC, talking about international finan-
cial crises, and created a big impression.
The word is that he would like to
make a comeback in politics or else get
a really top-notch job. One mentioned
in London was secretary-general of the
Commonwealth, currently held by Sir
Shridath Ramphal.
Next year a really magnificent job
comes up for grabs: director-general of
UNESCO, at present held by the much-
reviled Mr M’Bow. It is one of the plum
appointments, not only for the Parisian
trappings but also for the prestige.
Observers in London and Paris are
drawing up lists of possible candidates.
Gough Whitlam, currently our ambas-
sador to UNESCO, is on the tipsters’
short lists. So is Pierre Trudeau. And
Fraser’s name comes up regu-
larly, one reason being that he
is keeping himself in the spot-
light abroad with speeches
and appearances at important
events.
HAXSTEAD, the charming
old NSW South Coast house
which was the home of Jeff
and Dame Zara Bate and
which was redecorated by the
talented Zara has changed
hands.
From now on the property
is to be a resort for paying
guests who want a quiet and
exclusive holiday surfing,
water-skiing, fishing, moun-
tain-climbing, tennis and
horse-riding. There are dams
stocked with perch and rain-
bow trout and even an oven to
smoke the catch.
AT SOUTH AFRICA’S
premier sports centre
Johannesburg’s Ellis Park
there are strict rules about
taking grog into the arena.
The locals get up to all
sorts of lurks to defeat the
ban, such as easing the flaps
on Coke cans and refilling
them with beer; and cutting a
small hole in a navel orange,
scooping out the centre, filling with
brandy or rum and replacing the flap.
FROM LONDON I wrote that, in my
view, the state offices of agents-general
should be scrapped and the money de-
voted to promoting Australia instead of
individual states.
Predictably I drew some fire, notably
from R. F.W. Watson, the Agent-Gener-
al for New South Wales, who, in a per-
suasive letter, set out all the work and
results which have attended his tour of
duty.
He says in one part of his letter: “The
promotion of industrial investment is
not a function of the Commonwealth
and any action by the states in this re-
gard fills a considerable void.”
Well, in my view again, it should be a
function of the Commonwealth. There
seems something a bit unreal in the vari-
ous states competing against one an-
other for business. I don’t think I’m
alone in this line of thought, either.
I hear that Tasmania has closed or
intends to close its agent-general
Suzman: doubts about the new South African constitution
office in London. Could be the starter.
HELEN SUZMAN, whom I saw in
Cape Town, never seems to change
attractive, alert and still a thorn in the
side of the South African Government.
When I first met her 11 years ago she
was the sole member of the Progressive
Party in the House; now there are 27.
She will acknowledge, a bit grudg-
ingly, that there have been changes for
the better in South Africa recently. But,
says Suzman, they have come not be-
cause of the government changing its
views; the changes have been brought
about by the blacks: “Economic press-
ure brought the changes in labor laws
the unions, the removal of job reserva-
tion. This has happened because of the
economic muscle of skilled labor.”
While conceding changes in petty
apartheid, Suzman still sees many
apartheid areas which are an affront to
humanity. She has grave doubts about
the new constitution which, she
believes, keeps the worst of the West-
minster system and omits the rule of law
and universal franchise. She
sees in the dead hand of its
unproductive bureaucracy
one of South Africa’s main
problems.
If she were in power, what
would she do? First, a crash
housing program, the most
pressing need. Then a nation-
al convention of whites and
people of other colors to talk
about priorities. Then out
with discrimination, out with
segregation; a full-scale edu-
cation drive; and eventually a
Bill of Rights and adult fran-
chise, a federal system of gov-
ernment and proportional
representation with a minority
veto.
IMITATION is the sincerest
form of flattery. Pieter-Dirk
Uys, the South African satirist
who gives merry hell to mem-
bers of his government, their
wives and other well-known
targets in the public eye, must
have gone to the Barry Hum-
phries School of Dramatic
Art.
The echoes of Dame Edna,
Sir Les Patterson and others
seem apparent. But Uys is the
hottest stage property in
South Africa. □

The navy knows how to train its officers
but, apparently, doesn’t know how to
keep them. On this month’s list of resig-
nations is Captain Walter Rothwell, 47,
director of naval communications. He is
to become the first full-time director of
the Australian Telecommunications
Users’ Group, looking after the interests
of some of the country’s biggest corpor-
ations, some of its smallest and govern-
ment departments. And there, from the
RAN, goes 34 years of experience.
Ted Wright, manager of Sydney’s Re-
gent Hotel, provided the venue;
Francois Henry, managing director of
Remy Australia, provided the Krug and
Quelltaler; and the New South Wales
presentations of The Bulletin-Q uelltaler
Restaurant Awards took place amid
scenes of great gaiety on the night of
July 16. The winners were: Berowra
Waters Inn (best food), Clock Hotel
(best steak), Imperial Peking on the
Rocks (best Chinese), Suntory (best
other ethnic), Doyles (best seafood) and
the Regent’s Kables Restaurant for the
best wine list.

P and O (better-known to Sydney’s
Channel 10 people as Pinot) threw a
party on Oriana, and people from Cus-
toms, shipping and the wharves general-
ly went aboard to hoist a stoup or two to
Ruth Donnelly who was retiring. For 14
years Donnelly, lately information offi-
cer at Circular Quay, brought so much
sparkle to a rubbernecking line of work
that she became known as Miss Cus-
toms. Which isn’t bad for a lady of 62.
While on the subject of brushing up well,
it’s worth noting that Diahann Carroll is
49, Joan Collins 51, Elizabeth Taylor 52,
Roddy McDowall 55, Gina Lollobrigida
57, Anne Baxter 61, Alexis Smith 63,
Lana Turner 64, Dorothy McGuire 65,
Jane Wyman 70, Stewart Granger 71,
Barbara Stanwyck 76 and Bette Davis
76. And they’re all still working.
In Sydney, a belly-dancer named
Zahrra was proposing to solve the prob-
lems of international discord by (pre-
sumably belly-) “dancing for peace” at
the Chevron Hotel, Potts Point. She
issued “an invitation to all women (with
bellies!!). Join me in a convention of
women.” The idea was to create “a new
Earth where life, love, liberty and peace
abound ... through our art, the ancient
dance of the sacred belly!!” The Chev-
ron, which has seen everything from
Nat King Cole to the Hookers’ Ball, has
seen nothing yet.
Journalistic history is being made,
again, at Rupert Murdoch’s Sun news-
paper in London. The publication nor-
mally employs several hundred journal-
ists, all of whom have gone on strike.
But the paper is still hitting the streets,
produced entirely by one man, editor
Kelvin MacKenzie. To the casual eye
there is no drastic drop in quality or
quantity. Everyone knows Fleet Street is
over-manned, but this is ridiculous.
Oqirhuyakt, the last descendant of
Genghis Khan, has died in Mongolia,
aged 84, reported the New China
Newsagency. “He was a good commu-
nist,” the report alleged.
Prisoner Oscar Nichols, who has shrunk
from 340 kg to 276 kg in a Kentucky jail,
is suing prison officials for $6 million
for not giving him the food he wants to
keep his weight up.
In Sydney Bettina Arndt, the dis-
tinguished sex-therapist, announced
that her mainly-for-females mail-order
business was up for sale. The merchan-
dise, she said, was “erotic yet tasteful”;

stuff to show that sex was serious but
also a lot of fun. So what exactly did
that mean? Well, for instance, there
were a few vibrators only about three
of those on the market being worthwhile
leopard-skin male G-strings, straw-
berry nipple cream, massage oils,
“water baby” vibrators, for the bath,
and books of instruction on how to find
the G-spot.
Sir John Gielgud’s mellifluous tones
have replaced those of Orson Welles in
the Paul Masson wine commercials in
the US. Welles got the heave-ho because
his bulk was thought inappropriate for
such a fine wine. “I’m very fond of
Orson, and didn’t like to do him out of a
job,” purred Sir John, “but the money
was too good.”
Not even the most sanguine of
businessmen would try to promote rug-
by league in Australia beyond the
level of the itinerant strip show or flea
circus outside NSW and Queensland.
But in the UK, where it is similarly
confined to Yorkshire and Lancashire,
Australia’s sometime favourite Pom,
Test cricketer Derek Randall, is
involved in taking the game south as
far as midland Nottingham, anyway.
There he is helping to establish the
Mansfield Marksman club. Also help-
ing: a brewery and Dave Parker,
longtime associate of the Chooms’
favorite RL commentator, Eddie War-
ing.
Dame Rachel Cleland has some absorb-
ing things to say about her Perth neigh-
bor, Sir Paul Hasluck, throughout her
book, Pathways to Independence ,
launched by Andrew Peacock in Sydney
last week. It’s an account of her life and
times with Sir Donald Cleland, Papua
New Guinea’s Administrator when
Hasluck was Territories Minister. The
“curious dichotomy of Hasluck’s
character”, writes Dame Rachel,
showed “humanity, a poetic apprecia-
tion of beauty, and perceptive insight
on the one hand, and on the other the
compulsive drive to lash out at others in
a hurtful way, cutting him off from
people.” But he was also tlie gentleman.
On a PNG tour once, Dame Rachel re-
calls, “we all had to fit into a very small
Bulolo house with no mod cons and
Paul and I, both with a tummy wog,
spent a hazardous night avoiding each
other as we competed for a pit latrine at
the bottom of the garden. The decencies
being as they were, 25 years ago, neither
of us blinked an eyelid about it next
day.”

A few selected words to the wise
RON SAW
A SYDNEY solicitor named Peter
Breen has written a pretty good book
for professional reasons, no doubt,
using the nom-de-plume of Paul Baron
called The Book of Letters. It tells you
how to write letters about anything.
Defamation, over-charging, noisy
neighbors, accidents, insurance claims,
debts, debtors, advertising, real estate,
voracious landlords ... you think of it
and Breen-Baron will give you a few
words for it.
At one time or another I’ve written
bellyaching letters on every one of those
subjects. For the past few years I’ve
been busy with the insurance industry.
Once, when I had insured virtually
every brick of my house with one com-
pany and every last stitch of its contents
with another the premiums totalling
roughly $lOOO a year a tradesman
smashed about $2OOO worth of marble
fireplace. I replaced it with a cedar job
at $3OO and claimed $3OO and no more.
And a fat lot of good it did me.
The first company insisted that a fire-
place was not a fixture and referred me
to the people who had insured the con-
tents. They, the contents-fanciers, said
No, No, they weren’t responsible. In the
end nobody paid but me. I was silly
enough to think that I could win with
furious rhetoric or with threats of refu-
sal to reinsure.
There was a time when I might have.
Then companies actually paid with-
out much fooling around and they still
made enough money to throw up the
biggest buildings in town.
But they made so many silly little
rules that it became necessary for pol-
icy-holders to cheat to get square and
with cheating came defensive cheating
from the companies; with the result that
nobody paid for anything and nobody
with more brains than the average jack-
ass believed a single word uttered by an
insurance salesman.
Breen-Baron suggests that this state
of affairs can be tidied up with a deal of
prolix formality: .. It is my intention,
therefore, to obtain a quote from an-
other insurance company in a building
smaller than that occupied by your
company ...”.
Quote-schmote. They don’t care a
hoot in hell about quotes. If they lose
your business there always will be an-
other lamb ready to be slaughtered. But
if you even intimate protracted litiga-
tion over a nugatory matter, they will
jump.
Twice now I’ve written, briefly and
politely, saying that I’m really such a
silly-billy in these matters but my law-
yers seem quite angry about it all and
say that the company might like to ex-
plain to them its refusals.
Twice the result has been a telephone
call of flowery apology followed by a
cheque. They don’t care about me or my
silly little policy or my quotes but to get
into holts with a shrewd mouthpiece is
usually to expose one’s company to a lot
of ruinously-expensive flapdoodle and
it’s cheaper to pay.
Breen-Baron is enthusiastic, too,
about dealing skilfully with noisy neigh-
bors: “... Generally the authorities are
most helpful, particularly the Pollution
Control Commission who have access
to sonic equipment ... .” Sonic-
schmonic.
One Saturday morning a few months
ago my neighbor seemed to be dis-
embowelling pigs. I went to his front
door and shouted until he could hear
me and he left his hi-fi and looked con-
trite.
“Just testing,” he said and, grinding
my teeth but mollified, I pushed off. I
should have asked, “Testing for what,
when?”
Next morning the screaming was so
loud and his guests had to utter such
shrieks to make themselves heard that
the conversation in our house might
have been that between gawping gold-
fish in a bowl.
I called the Pollution Control Com-
mission. The man who answered
seemed to want to help.
“Noise pollution is a subject you
need to know about,” he said.
“Tomorrow I’ll send you
some literature.”
“I don’t want any literature
tomorrow. I want the noise to
stop now.”
“But this is Sunday.”
“And I’d like the noise to
stop on Sunday.”
“There’s nobody here.”
“Where are you? Some-
where else?”
“No, but there’s nothing I
can do.”
“So how do we control the
noise pollution?”
“I daresay you could call
the cops.”
I did, and: “We can’t do
anything till 9pm,” they said.
“So how do I stop the
noise?”
“You could call Pollution
Control.”
I should have remembered that (a) I
was dealing with public servants and (b)
private enterprise is best.
Years ago I lived in an apartment
and, it became clear, the glad cries of
my family and friends at play seemed to
disturb a Russian woman who lived
next door. Her solution was to write to
my editor, the late Jack Tier, telling him
that I was a thick-witted, bawling,
screaming, hallooing screwball.
The letters were always unsigned but
as she’d written the same stuff to me, in
the same hand, it was easy enough to
take them from Tier and put them in her
letter-box.
She gave no evidence of having seen
a letter of any kind and I hugged myself
with delight, knowing that I was prob-
ably driving her mad.
One morning in the festive season,
about three weeks after the uproar be-
gan, when most of the local inhabitants
were in town or otherwise at work, as I
lay twitching wretchedly, my cerebel-
lum like a hot jellyfish, my tongue like a
dead squirrel, a series of shattering, ag-
onising sounds pierced my soul.
In the window of her apartment the
Russian stood beside an empty kero-
sene drum. Regularly, about every three
seconds, she struck it heavily with a rag-
ged cricket bat.
Sobbing, I called the local cops and
certainly they arrived. But not at my
door. They stood beside her, grinning
they seemed to be wiping their chops,
back-handed as she kept beating.
It was the last uproar. □

Lange’s Baptism of Fire
The atomic-powered U.S. submarine Queenfish, Shultz with Australia’s Hawke: Labor is pledged to a nuclear-free South Pacific
NEW ZEALAND HERALD
New Zealand’s prime minister-elect confronts his predecessor—and Washington.
Prime Minister-elect David Lange had
barely slept off his hearty victory meal
last week when the string of crises began.
First, Wellington’s Reserve Bank stemmed
a hemorrhage of flight capital with a freeze
on foreign exchange—and demanded an
immediate devaluation of the New Zea-
land dollar. Lame-duck Prime Minister
Robert Muldoon refused, setting the stage
for a constitutional showdown over com-
mand during the two-week, postelection
interregnum. Then U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz arrived for the 33rd annual
meeting of the ANZUS defense pact and
collided with Lange’s campaign vow to
ban U.S. warships carrying nuclear weap-
ons from visiting New Zealand ports.
By anyone’s measure, it was a baptism of
fire —and doubly so for a 41-year-old law-
yer with only a scant seven years’ political
experience. But over the course of last
week, New Zealand’s youngest prime min-
ister of this century seemed conclusively to
dispose of campaign accusations that he
was far out of his depth. In short order he
forced a 20 percent devaluation of the New
Zealand dollar and compelled Muldoon to
give up effective control of the country’s
shaky finances. At least for the moment,
he skirted a serious rupture of ANZUS by
exchanging pleasantries and pledging good
will during a 40-minute private meeting
with Shultz. And he seems to be heading
for his formal Inauguration this week with
his optimism and trademark good humor
intact. “The job is very much more satisfy-
ing than I ever anticipated,” Lange told
Newsweek. “The only thing wrong is
that I don’t start getting paid to run this
country for another week.”
In imposing the devaluation only four
days after his landslide victory, Lange
seemed to put the nails in the political
coffin of his once powerful predecessor. A
crusader for global monetary reform who
has promoted “think big” strategies and
served as his own finance minister, Mul-
doon had mocked Lange throughout the
campaign as an “economic novice” and
was adamant in opposing any devaluation.
“I’m hoping that in the short space of a
day or two I can give [Lange] some in-
struction in the realities of government
where you don’t give way to every pres-
sure,” he said as the standoff boiled up into
headline news.
Freeze: But the lesson proved to be Mul-
doon’s. Lange quickly charged the eight-
year-veteran prime minister with “eco-
nomic sabotage” for withholding a
Reserve Bank memo strongly advising a
devaluation. Within 12 hours, Muldoon’s
own cabinet compelled him to back down
and accept Lange’s plan for the New Zea-
land dollar’s largest devaluation in 33
years, as well as for a three-month freeze
on prices and an end to interest-rate con-
trols. Muldoon later admitted that the Re-
serve Bank “may” have advised a devalu-
ation —but said that he did not know for
certain since he apparently had not read
the memo. He also said that when his
National Party meets early next year to
select its new leadership, he himself would
be “unlikely” to be a candidate.
The meeting with the American secre-
tary of state had promised to be equally
heated. Shultz had already warned that
Lange’s pledge to ban visits to New Zea-
land ports by nuclear-armed or nuclear-
powered U.S. ships could, if implemented,
spell the end of ANZUS. “For a military
alliance to mean anything, it must be possi-
ble for the military forces of the countries
involved to interact with one another,” he
said at press conferences in Australia and
New Zealand. Nevertheless, the two men
emerged smiling from their meeting in the
Parliament building in Wellington. Shultz
said they had laid the basis for a “good
cooperative relationship”; Lange promised
“a continuing association and a dialogue.”
But it remained unclear whether Lange
would seek to soften Labor’s tough antinu-
clear stance. “I am not prepared to answer
questions on the hoof about policy
changes,” he said.
Fortunately for Lange, he may have some
breathing room. Shultz did not back off on


WORLD AFFAIRS
demanding access for U.S. ships to New
Zealand ports, but he emphasized the need
for “patience” in working through differ-
ences within the alliance. His aides were
quick to point out that no U.S. Navy ships
are scheduled to visit New Zealand before
1985. And while the left wing of the Labor
Party considers the issue nonnegotiable,
Lange himself is widely believed to be am-
bivalent. Indeed, only a year ago Australia’s
Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke came to
power pledging a review of the ANZUS
treaty—but in short order reaffirmed the
status quo. It was all smiles and no friction
early last week when Hawke and Shultz met
in Canberra.
Heartfelt: While Lange may have been
able to duck the ANZUS issue, the econom-
ic crisis promises no early letup. Within 48
hours of the devaluation, $5OO million re-
turned to the country’s coffers —fully two-
thirds of the amount that had fled overseas
during the month preceding the election.
But economic analysts warn that devalu-
ation is only a short-term solution that ulti-
mately will drive up New Zealand’s $8.7
billion foreign debt, increase the price of
imported consumer goods and boost overall
inflation —now at 7.5 percent —by as much
as 6 percentage points. Those would hardly
be ripe conditions for the new prime minis-
ter to try to turn around his own party’s
heartfelt stance on nuclear weapons —or
face down Washington on what it views as a
critical threat to the ANZUS alliance. Da-
vid Lange might well be forgiven this week
for asking whatever happened to the old
tradition of a politician’s honeymoon.

'ANZUS Isa Commitment '
Last week in Wellington, Prime Minis-
ter-elect David Lange spoke with News-
week’s Selwyn Parker. Excerpts:
PARKER: How important is ANZUS to
New Zealand?
LANGE: Let me start by saying that
America is important to New Zealand. A
shared heritage, common democratic tra-
ditions, a fundamental dependence on the
American market for New Zealand ex-
ports, a history of American investment
in New Zealand: these make for an inevi-
table relationship that includes the de-
fense area as well. Even if we didn’t have
ANZUS, it’s inconceivable that the
Americans would stand by while we were
invaded. So ANZUS is an honest declara-
tion of our commitment each to the other.
Q. U.S. Secretary of State Shultz is op-
posed to any renegotiation of the ANZUS
treaty. Is he being reasonable?
A. He’s entitled to represent the view of
his government, and I respect him for it.
But I don’t accept that position.
Q. Is there a chance that New Zealand
might withdraw from ANZUS?
A. Quite simply, under ANZUS no-
body withdraws unilaterally. So there
would be no unilateral withdrawal by
New Zealand.
Q .How committed are you to the goal of
a nuclear-free South Pacific?
A. We support the idea of a nuclear-
weapons-free South Pacific, in which nu-
clear armaments would not be employed,
activated or stored. Of course we would
have to recognize the right of passage on
the high seas. So this would be a different
state of affairs than back home, where we
can put in place certain specific goals.
Q. Were you prepared for the crisis state
of the nation’s finances?
A. It was what I had expected rather
than what I had hoped. Having used up
every form of borrowing that you could
undertake, we were literally broke. In one
sense the very scale of the problem was a
help in its solution. It was so massive that
no one could quibble.
Q. Won’t the devaluation make it more
difficult for New Zealand to pay back its
foreign loans?
A. I think you have to come back to
certain realities. At the end of 1975 an
N.Z. dollar bought one dollar and four
cents in the United States. Today it buys
49 cents, which regrettably is about the
level where it belongs. Without the most
recent devaluation, there would have
been an inevitable, slow hemorrhaging
downward. But by that radical measure
we have the chance to get a whole new
wave of consolidation, to change the di-
rection of production, manufacturing and
marketing and then to handle that.
Q. Haven’t previous Labor governments
both in New Zealand and Australia suf-
fered from their doctrinaire left-wingers?
A. New Zealand has never had a doctri-
naire left-wing government. The social-
issue activists get labeled left wing and
they can in some cases be quite destabiliz-
ing. But what we have learned is the mes-
sage that we have taken right throughout
this campaign: that Labor governments
have to be more careful than conservative
governments.

If you think of IBM as a big
company that makes big
computers for other big
companies, you’re right—but
only partially so.
We’re also a company that
serves thousands of small
businesses and professionals.
There are good reasons for it.
Our growing selection of small
computers is one of them. They
provide problem-solving power at
prices that won’t create problems
for you.
They help you and the people
who work with you handle
accounting, word processing,
forecasting, inventory and other
tasks that are the foundation of
any enterprise, large or small.
And to use most of our systems,
you don’t need computer
experience either.
From the instruction manuals
that accompany them to
the training programs we
make available,
everything is designed to
put you in charge quickly
and painlessly.
For large companies and
small, IBM adapts to the
unique needs of its customers
—putting them and IBM
together in very productive ways.
We'd like to do the same for you.
You may need a big solution.
You may need a small solution. In
either case, IBM is the right

'We Are Worried About Isolationism'
INTERVIEW: PAUL D. WOLFOWITZ
Paul D. Wolfowitz, 40, has been assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs since December 1982. On a trip last
week with U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz through Southeast Asia, Austral-
ia and New Zealand, he talked with
Newsweek’s Zofia Smardz about prob-
lems that the United States faces with its
Pacific allies. Excerpts:
SMARDZ: What does the ANZUS alli-
ance mean to U.S. interests in the
Pacific?
WOLFOWITZ: It’s one of our oldest alli-
ances. ANZUS countries have fought with
us in four wars in this century, and they are
highly professional in their approach to
military and security matters. We benefit a
great deal from cooperating with their mili-
tary forces. We have become more con-
cerned with the situation in the Indian
Ocean and the Gulf. Events there have been
a reminder that the southern Pacific is one
of the access routes to that important part of
the world.
Q. The New Zealand Labor Party,
which is about to take power, opposes
visits to New Zealand ports by U.S.
nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed
ships. What would the repercussions be
if these visits had to stop?
A. ANZUS is a security alliance. Cooper-
ation among our military forces is essential
to the functioning of our alliance, and access
to ports and airfields is essential to that
military cooperation. We feel very strongly
that this is a problem that needs to be
worked out and we are focusing on it.
Q. Is the United States concerned
that if New Zealand banned U.S. ships,
Australia might do the same?
A. There are concerns everywhere about
nuclear deployments and the transit of
nuclear ships. We think we have convinced
the new Australian government and the
vast majority of the Australian public of
the merits of that issue. I would hope we
could convince the New Zealanders. But
these are two different countries with
minds of their own and interests and out-
looks of their own.
Q. Are you worried about isolation-
ism in that part of the world?
A. We are worried about isolationism
everywhere. One of the great benefits we
have gotten from the postwar system of
alliances has been that it has put a brake
on the tendency of all of us at different
times to withdraw into the kinds of shells
that helped produce the disasters of the
19305. It’s important for us to remain en-
Wolfowitz: ‘The Soviet threat is growing ’
BRUCE HOERTEL
gaged in the Pacific, and it’s important
for our partners to remain engaged with us.
Q. What is the specific Soviet threat
to the Pacific region?
A. There is a very large Soviet military
threat to this part of the world and it has
been growing steadily. The Soviets have
built up one of the world’s largest armies in
this area. They have 3,000 combat aircraft
deployed against China and against Japan,
and they are threatening large portions of
the sea lanes in the Pacific. They have a fleet
in the Pacific that has grown by almost 30
percent in the last few years. The greatest
danger lies in the possible use of those forces
in some future confrontation.
Q. What is the outlook for a Pacific
Basin community that would bring the
United States,Japan, the ASEAN coun-
tries and other Pacific nations into
closer economic cooperation?
A. No one is looking to a kind of European
Common Market concept. It’s not practical
and in my view not desirable. But there are
Pacific problems and it’s good to get people
looking at problems as they affect all the
countries in the Pacific.
Q .Asia is perhaps the most dynamic
part of the world these days in business
development. Are the links between the
United States and Asia strong enough
to sustain broader economic ties?
A. In dealing with Asian affairs, there are
distances that are more than just geograph-
ic. The question is whether we can bridge
these distances effectively. We’ve been
working particularly hard to deal with some
of our economic and trade problems with
the Japanese. These problems are made
tougher by the fact that our cultures are so
different. We should work at building the
kind of knowledge on both sides of the
Pacific that will lower the barriers. Our own
interests in the Pacific would be much better
served if we could increase the number of
Americans who have close contact with the
countries of the region.
Q. Will the United States face more
military surprises in this part of the
world anytime soon?
A. The purpose of our deterrence posture
is to do what we can to prevent those sur-
prises. Our posture in Korea is very impor-
tant in keeping the situation there stable.
The arrangements we have with Northeast
Asia have given the South Koreans a great
deal of confidence. Because of that confi-
dence, they were able to deal with the Ran-
goon bombing crisis with an impressive de-
gree of statesmanship.
Q. The Philippines seems to be one of
the most unsettled spots in the Pacific.
What can the United States do to re-
store stability there?
A. The government of the Philippines is
something for the people of the Philippines
to determine. It’s been very good that the
Philippines recently had a serious election
for the first time in a long while and that
there seems to be a reinvigoration of demo-
cratic processes there. That’s a develop-
ment we certainly welcome and want to
encourage any way we can appropriately.
Something that is appropriate for us to do is
to assist that country, as we are now, in
coping with some of its very serious eco-
nomic problems.
Q. What is the single most difficult
problem facing the United States in
Asia and the Pacific today?
A. There are a number. The situation in
Kampuchea [Cambodia] and the wider
threat that it poses to the whole region is one
of the most serious. The military threat that
North Korea poses to the South is one of the
most dangerous, although the strong deter-
rent posture we have with our South Kore-
an allies makes us fairly confident we won’t
actually have to face that danger. In some
ways, one of the problems we face is the
difficulty of keeping up enough energy to
treat this diverse and enormous part of the
world, and to keep our balance and remem-
ber it’s not just China, not just Japan or
Southeast Asia or New Zealand. It’s all a
single piece.


INDIA
New Moves Against the Sikhs
UPI
Barbed wire blocking off the temple: Gandhi has cracked the Sikhs’solidarity
Militant Sikhs had planned their march
to “liberate” the Golden Temple,
their holiest shrine, from its occupation by
Indian troops. But then the government
stepped in. Security forces arrested 88 Sikhs,
putting an end to the march before it even
began. The demarche proved once again
that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is deter-
mined to break the back of Sikh extremism.
The violent and deadly outburst that
claimed nearly 600 lives in the Punjab last
month was one of the most serious threats to
her government in years. To ensure that
there is no replay of that violence, Gandhi
has quietly begun to assume extraordinary
constitutional powers that will allow her to
crush any opposition group that dares to
challenge her.
Even before the aborted march, Gandhi
had cracked the Sikhs’ solidarity. Most Sikh
leaders had refused to begin cleanup oper-
ations at the temple until government troops
left the shrine in the city of Amritsar. That
was unacceptable to the New Delhi govern-
ment officials, who feared that the Sikhs
would leave the damage unrepaired as a
memorial to the assault and an inspiration to
Sikh separatist designs. But in a series of all-
night sessions, Gandhi’s emissaries negoti-
ated a settlement with Baba Santa Singh,
leader of a small maverick Sikh faction
called Nihang. The agreement allows re-
pairs to begin immediately.
The agreement with Singh is hardly a sign
that the prime minister has repaired rela-
tions with the Sikhs. By beginning work on
the temple, the Nihangs have defied Sikh
holy rulers and risked excommunication.
Many of the Nihangs who entered the 72-
acre temple complex last week were recruit-
ed from the Punjab, and are protected by
heavily armed Indian troops. In the end,
their labors may still come to naught; the
Sikh high priests have declared that recon-
struction can be done only by loyal Sikhs,
and they have vowed to undo any repairs
that the Nihangs make.
Despite the government’s tough stance
and the heavy troop presence in the Punjab,
the Sikh terror campaign has not been
crushed. Last week Sikh terrorists raided a
bank near Amritsar, and their hit-and-run
attacks claim a victim almost every day.
That is enough for Gandhi to claim justifica-
tion for keeping the Army in the state, which
now resembles an occupied zone in some
places. The continued violence is also the
stated reason for a new ordinance that gives
the prime minister the power to declare an
area “terrorist-affected and disturbed.” Un-
der the law, signed by President Zail Singh
without parliamentary approval, almost
anyone arrested can be charged with aiding
terrorism.
Unexpected: That has touched off fears
that Gandhi intends to silence all dissent
between now and the year-end, when she
must call national elections. “There are
enough laws on the books to deal with all
sorts of crimes, including terrorism,” says
Gobinda Mukhoty, an Indian constitution-
al expert. “Obviously, the ordinance is for
any kind of opposition in this crucial election
year. Gandhi has clamped on an emergency
rule without formally declaring it.” The
action was all the more unusual because
Gandhi could easily have waited for approv-
al by Parliament, which convenes this week.
But if she has proven anything in her long
tenure as India’s leader, it is that she will do
the unexpected or the unusual—as long as it
assures that her leadership remains secure.

U.S. AFFAIRS
A Running Start
A display of unity against the odds, and a 20,000-banner salute to the patriotism of the Democratic Party: As House O'Neill
Democrats talk unity and aim at Middle America —but will it play in November?
When the history of the 1984 presidential
election is written, the name Peter Scher
may not be on the list of Democratic nota-
bles. But it probably should be—for Scher, a
23-year-old Mondale advance man-turned-
convention “visibility chairman,” was the
mastermind of one of the ’B4 Democratic
convention’s most powerful symbolic
coups. Suddenly, just before Walter Mon-
dale’s acceptance speech on prime-time na-
tional TV, the rapt crowd in San Francisco’s
Moscone Convention Center produced
20,000 American flags and began waving
them in a seemingly spontaneous display of
old-fashioned patriotism. Call it hokey, call
it slick, it worked. “This,” said a delighted
House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O’Neill, “is
the week the Democrats took the flag back”
from the GOP.
For the first time in years, the leaders of
the Democratic Party were aiming straight
for the nation’s psychic mainstream —and
they couldn’t have asked for a better conven-
tion from which to launch their assault.
Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro
were nominated without incident or audible
complaint. All San Francisco, in fact,
seemed awash in enthusiasm for Ferraro,
who won nearly unanimous raves for her
first week in the national spotlight. Party
unity—on the surface, at least —was
achieved against heavy odds. The support-
ing cast —from Mario Cuomo, Jesse Jack-
son and Edward Kennedy to the last and
least-famous district delegate—played its
part with loyalty and elan.
The enemy was met head-on, at least
rhetorically, and the thematics of the fall
campaign were set forth with precision and
daring. And such was the palminess of the
convention’s final hours that its good, gray
nominee earned enthusiastic applause by
promising to raise taxes —which may be a
modern benchmark for political candor.
Competing Myths: Will it work? Do Mon-
dale and Ferraro have a chance against the
powerful appeal of Ronald Reagan? Clearly,
no Democrat knows for sure, but the prevail-
ing gloom among the party’s ranking pols
had lifted at least a little last week. Mon-
dale’s chosen themes —patriotism, family
and old-fashioned hard work —are arguably
a match for Ronald Reagan’s. Against the
cowboy myth of a nation built on rugged
individualism, he and Ferraro offer the
equally compelling symbolism of honest
immigrants earning their way into the
American middle class. And Mondale’s
forthright speech to the convention im-
pressed some of his sharpest critics. “It was
bold, it took risks —Mondale surprised me,”
said polltaker and Hart adviser Patrick Cad-
dell. “He didn’t look like he was just defend-
ing the past.”
Still, Mondale faces some formidable
problems. The party he now heads is still a
collection of disparate constituencies in
search of a common identity, and 1984 may
be a rebuilding year. Mondale’s challenge as
nominee is to bridge the transition gracefully
and win the election as well; to do so, he must
avoid the appearance of catering to “special
interests” at any cost, and he must fully
articulate his vision of the national future.
He will need a near-perfect campaign, and
luck, to do all that —and his ill-timed deci-
sion to resurrect Bert Lance last week was
hardly a reassuring sign. The choice of Fer-
raro signaled Mondale’s commitment to a
new politics of gender that transcends tradi-
tional geographic logic— but the ticket still
lacks regional balance, and the party is
threatened by potentially crippling defec-
tions among blue-collar workers and young
upscale voters. And the truth that lurked
behind the mood of solidarity in San Fran-
cisco last week was very probably this:
though the Democrats are united in their
desperation to defeat Ronald Reagan, they
are far from achieving a new consensus on
the party’s programs and core ideology.
“Sometimes I think the best thing that can
happen to this party is for Reagan to wipe us
out again,” sighed one dispirited big-city
mayor. “Then we’d be forced to purge our-
selves and start all over again. ’ ’
Mondale was not buying that brand of
defeatism. Clearly aware that many in the
party have lingering doubts about his dog-
ged campaign style, he rose to the occasion
with a combative acceptance speech that
may have been his best political moment

PHOTOS BY WAL LY McNAMEE—NESWEEK
Candidates Mondale and Ferraro accept the acclamation: Aiming for the psychic midstream
ever. He insisted that the Democrats had
learned a “new realism” from their 1980
defeat, and he touted the prevailing modera-
tion of the 1984 platform. And crucially,
given his image as a champion of the special
interests, Mondale went out of his way to
declare his capacity to withstand political
pressure. “A president has to be able to say
‘yes’—but mostly ‘no’,” he said, quoting
Harry Truman. And he said his message to
Congress was, “We must cut spending and
pay as we go. If you don’t hold the line, I
will —that’s what the veto is for. ”
He assailed Ronald Reagan for tax poli-
cies that favor the rich, and for encouraging
business to use “King Kong tactics to make
workers take Hong Kong wages”—a line
that brought an approving roar from the
union delegates in the hall. He attacked
Reagan’s record on arms control, and he
warned that the nation is “living on bor-
rowed time and borrowed money” because
of the Reagan deficits. “Whoever is inaugu-
rated in January, the American people will
have to pay Mr. Reagan’s bills,” he argued.
“Taxes will go up, and anyone who says they
won’t is not telling the truth. . . Let’s tell the
truth —Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so
will I. He won’t tell you. I just did.”
Dead Heat: It all seemed to work. In a new
Newsweek Poll conducted late last week,
Mondale and Ferraro were favored by 48
percent of the voters, while 46 percent sup-
ported Reagan and Bush —a dead heat, for
all practical purposes, although the after-
glow of the convention probably affects the
results. A 45 percent plurality of the News-
week sample said they were more likely to
vote Democratic because of the convention,
and Ferraro was a major plus: significantly,
65 percent of the voters now regard her as
qualified for the vice presidency, compared
with 51 percent one week earlier. More than
half the Democrats and independents who
lean Democratic felt the party was solidly
behind the ticket (although former Hart
supporters were more likely to see divisive-
ness ahead), but Reagan still had an edge
over Mondale in key attributes of leadership:
decisiveness, a well-defined program and
the perceived ability to get things done.
In Washington, Reagan and his aides
picked up the gauntlet—particularly after
Mondale’s blunt remarks on the inevitabil-
ity of a tax increase. “The president will not
balance the budget on the backs of the Amer-
ican people,” said White House spokesman
Larry Speakes, adding that Mondale would
have to raise taxes because the Democrats
“have made too many promises to too many
special-interest groups.” Chief of staff
James Baker said Mondale’s demand for six
separate presidential debates “cannot be
taken seriously,” promising only that Rea-
gan would debate Mondale “on reasonable
terms at a reasonable time.” And campaign
staffers said candidate Reagan was ready to
take his show on the road: this week Reagan
will visit New Jersey, Georgia and Texas, all


Ferraro’s First Week
Women and men alike wept and cheered.
It took three tries before the crowd would
quiet down and she could complete her first,
historic sentence. “Ladies and gentlemen of
the convention ... my name is Geraldine
Ferraro.” The effect was electric, inside the
Moscone Center and all across the nation.
Women of widely divergent backgrounds
and persuasions—and many men as well—
beamed, bawled and cheered aloud (“Ger-
ry! Gerry!”) as the first woman ever
nominated for vice president by a major
U.S. political party accepted the honor with
a powerful and plain-spoken grace. “By
choosing a woman to run for our nation’s
second highest office, you send a powerful
signal to all Americans,” Ferraro said. “If
we can do this, we can do anything .”
Even through the cool medium of televi-
sion, Ferraro’s speech was clearly an emo-
tional high point of last week’s Democratic
convention —and a vivid demonstration of
the excitement that Walter Mondale and his
advisers hope she will bring to the ticket.
The speech also capped Ferraro’s first week
of political testing as a major party candi-
date, a week in which she handled the pub-
lic, press and fellow politicians confidently
despite unprecedented scrutiny on every-
thing from her family’s finances to her cam-
paign body language. “She comes across in
a human way that is unique,” said Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt after Ferraro spoke
to a breakfast gathering of Southern gover-
nors and party officials in San Francisco.
“She can put this campaign on a people’s
level.” All week long, indeed, the candidate
herself pushed the family theme. “We have
been pre-empted on this issue, as if Demo-
crats are not family peo-
ple,” she told News-
week. “Our values are
middle-class values, and
those are voters we lost in
the last election . . . Now
is the time for us to re-
claim that constituency.”
Days before the for-
malities of nomination
and acceptance, Ferraro
was working hard to get in
step with the Mondale
campaign. At his Lake Ta-
hoe retreat last week she
received two black loose-
leaf books on Mondale
positions and held brief-
ing sessions on the back
porch of her cottage (once,
she excused herself to put
laundry in the dryer). Fer-
raro was particularly interested in discuss-
ing aid to Central America because she had
traveled there recently (both halves of the
ticket believe such support should be condi-
tioned on human-rights progress). “She was
already well versed in a full range of issues,”
said Mondale aide Bernard Aronson, who
advised Ferraro during the convention. She
also inherited Mondale speechwriter Ross
Brown and one of Mondale’s assistant press
secretaries, Scott Widmeyer, to beef up her
own half-dozen top staffers.
Was the “Mondalization” of Ferraro al-
ready under way? Not at all, campaign
aides insisted. And Mondale himself made
the same pledge to Ferraro, Newsweek

learned. “We don’t want to change you. If
you feel pressure, resist,” he told his run-
ning mate —a symbol, Mondale says, of
both the party’s new frontiers and the bed-
rock family values that prompted Ferraro
to take time out last week for a private
celebration of her 24th wedding anniversa-
ry. Some Mondale aides do worry about her
quick tongue (questioning Reagan’s reli-
gion) and limited policy background, but
they count on her quickness and savvy to
compensate. “Anyway,” said staffer Aron-
son, “she started her career running against
party bosses, and she’s not going to knuckle
under to any would-be bosses.”
‘Spark 5 : Besides, many of the bosses seem
to like Ferraro as is. “Gerry has given us the
spark we needed,” said her principal pa-
tron, House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip)
O’Neill. “She’ll speak up to Mondale.” If
Mondale himself felt threatened by that
prospect, or by speculations that Ferraro
may often outshine him, he hid it well—
kidding her at one point that he, too, hoped
to make the covers of both major news
magazines in the same week. “He doesn’t
have an ego that needs to be fulfilled all the
time,” said one Mondale aide. Sensitive to
new political proprieties, the nominee and
his team quickly developed an etiquette for
running mates of opposite sexes. They do
not kiss, hug or even join hands in the classic
raised-arm political salute. “I never kissed
Jimmy Carter,” jokes Mondale.
Ferraro’s finesse came through in a series
of political stops last week—including a
mission from the Mondale trailer to woo
wavering delegates and a solo appearance at
the crowded breakfast with Southern offi


key states; next month he will barnstorm his
way to the Republican convention in Dallas.
Despite the polls, one aide said confidently,
“the only thing that can beat us now is
[unforeseen] events.”
Mondale’s most urgent task last week was
to pull the Democrats together for the long
campaign ahead. During the first days of the
convention, he and his staff spent hours in
delicate negotiations with Gary Hart and
Jesse Jackson, urging them to accept his
nomination and avoid a divi-
sive battle on the issues. In
the end, his handlers easily
contained Jackson’s chal-
lenge to the party platform,
compromising only on a
Hart proposal to limit the
useofU.S. military force.
Behind the scenes, Mon-
dale’s high command kept
the proceedings under tight
control through a regiment
of 350 whips on the floor —
and his first-ballot nomina-
tion, when it came, was al-
most anticlimactic. New
York Governor Cuomo, the
keynote speaker, set the tone
early on with an eloquent
appeal for unity and traditional Democratic
values; the activities of the party’s subconsti-
tuencies, organized in dozens of busy cau-
cuses, went mostly unseen by the networks’
big eyes. The 800 labor delegates, for exam-
ple, were all but invisible on the tube: union
labels were conspicuously understated in
‘the convention hall, and AFL-CIO presi-
dent Lane Kirkland was closeted in a VIP
box far from the podium.
Squelch: The one crack in the veneer of
togetherness was the Bert Lance affair —
which, ironically, was the result of Mon-
dale’s haste to placate the party’s Southern
wing and to help balance his ticket with a
white male near the top. The flap broke
publicly the Friday before
the convention, when it be-
came known that Mondale
planned to replace Charles
Manatt as chairman of the
Democratic National Com-
mittee. Behind the scenes,
Lance had already been
recruited as Manatt’s suc-
cessor by Mondale cam-
paign chairman James
Johnson. But within hours,
and with Manatt seeming to
fan the flames, the party hi-
erarchy erupted in contro-
versy over Lance’s image as
a wheeler-dealer and his
Jimmy Carter past —and
sharp dissent threatened to
squelch the euphoria that
had followed Mondale’s an-
nouncement on Ferraro.
After 24 hours of indeci-
sion, Mondale publicly re-
versed himself: Manatt was
reinstated (although stripped of much of his
power), Lance was assigned a titular posi-
tion as general chairman of the campaign
and the nominee was forced to admit the
goof. Reagan’s men, watching from afar,
were exultant. “Here’s Mondale doing ex-
actly what Carter would have done —a little
bit of pressure and he’s on another tangent,”
said one. “What kind of leadership is that?”
Manatt: Fanning flames
WALLY McNAMEE— NESWEEK
What had happened? Top
Mondale aides attributed
the embarrassment to a
breakdown at the top —a
failure, under pressure of
time, to debate the Lance
appointment and anticipate
its potential for reopening
old wounds. For one thing,
they said, Mondale’s inner
circle had been split between
Washington and his home in
Minnesota through most of
the previous five weeks, and
coordination was slack. For
another, someone had suc-
cumbed to overconfidence.
“It always happens when
we’re close to a big score,”
groaned one adviser. Said another: “Call it
smugness or hubris —it’ll kill us if we don’t
get it under control.’’ The one consolation
was the probability that few voters cared
much what Bert Lance did, so long as he
stayed out of government —but News-
week learned that some in the Mondale
camp, belatedly convinced of the need for
damage control, are exploring ways to ease
him out of the campaign.
The uproar quickly subsided in the happy
babble emanating from San Francisco. Out-
side the convention hall, which was protect-
ed by barricades and patrolled by legions of
police, there were few signs of unrest —cer-
tainly nothing that qualified as a replay of

Jackson and Hart join Mondale: Delicate negotiations
cials. “If somebody does something good
for me, I don’t forget it. . . We all come from
the same kind of background,” she said.
“She disarmed them by being so honest —
she made them understand she was just like
them,” reported Congressman Gephardt.
Louisiana state chairman Jesse Bankston
was one of many quick to indicate approval.
“I am a conservative white man from the
South, and I want to get her into Louisiana
as much as we can,” he said. Accordingly,
Mondale’s men planned to exploit Ferraro’s
appeal far beyond safe Northeast and liberal
enclaves. “I can’t wait to send her to Norma
Rae country,” said one Mondale strategist.
“We’re going to send her into the lion’s
den,” said another.
Lions: If the response she drew at Mos-
cone was any example, Ferraro will tame
most of the lions she confronts. After
slogging through a half-dozen drafts,
slowing her normal express-train delivery
and slipping into the deserted hall the
night before to practice with the Tele-
PrompTer, the woman who would be veep

a presumably Freud-
ian slip: “Tonight, the
daughter of an immi-
grant from Italy has
been chosen to run for
president in the new
land my father came to
love.” As her audience
wept and cheered, Fer-
raro stressed home-
town virtues —pride in
work, love of country,
obedience to the law —
and delivered a ringing
indictment of Reagan
policies. “Tonight we
reclaim our dream,”
she declared. “To all
the children of Amer-
ica, I say: the genera-
tion before ours kept
faith with us, and like
them, we will pass on
to you a stronger, more just America.”
For delegate Ann Richards, state treas-
urer of Texas and a veteran politician, it was
a moment that defied definition. “Some-
times emotion speaks better than logic,” she
said. And from a back row near the alter-
nates’ gallery, Ohio pol Tim Hagan listened
to the speech with tears streaming down his
face. “It is a statement, a breakthrough and
a liberation for all of us,” said Hagan, who is
half Italian—with seven sisters. “I hope the
realization of this dream helps us win the
election. But we have changed America
here, and that may be enough.”

the ill-starred convention of 1968. On Mon-
day a protest by a group of punk rockers and
self-described anarchists led to 84 arrests; on
Thursday 89 marchers from the Livermore
Action Group, a coalition of peace activists,
were also arrested. Both incidents took place
in the financial district, nearly a mile from
the Moscone Center. The cops around the
hall, in fact, were plainly bored —so much so
that a few of them passed the time by “rat-
ing” passing women with hand-lettered
cards numbered 1 through 10, likejudges at
the Olympics. That bit of cheek outraged
women delegates and led to a city investiga-
tion —but the closest thing to violence oc-
curred inside the hall, where police got re-
ports that an unidentified man had
unaccountably bitten three delegates in a
tussle during Jesse Jackson’s speech.
The Trailers: The countdown to the nomi-
nation, meanwhile, was proceeding smooth-
ly. Mondale’s lieutenants ran the show from
a ring of live trailers just off the convention
floor; inside, a squad of 14 “trackers” stayed
in constant contact with the whips over floor
Let the Joy Bells Ring
From the moment the Rev. Jesse Jack-
son began to speak last week, there was
something special in the air. Even rival
delegations were alert and apprehensive:
no one was certain just what the fiery
preacher would say in his prime-time ad-
dress to the party as a whole —or, perhaps
more important, what he would refuse to
say. And Jackson’s own impassioned sup-
porters were on their feet from the start,
shouting his praises, exhorting him on:
“Teach, Brother, Teach!”
The moment of highest drama came ear-
ly, when Jackson met the fears head-on.
Suddenly, Jackson’s voice grew quiet—
and with it, the vast, packed hall. “If in my
low moments, in word, deed or attitude,
through some error of temper, taste or tone,
I have caused anyone discomfort, created
pain or revived someone’s fears, that was
not my truest self,” he said. “If there were
occasions when my grape turned into a
raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance,
please forgive me ... I am not a perfect
servant. I am a public servant doing my best
against the odds. As I develop and serve, be
patient. God is not finished with me yet.”
All apprehension evaporated. And by the
time Jackson’s voice rose again to its perfect
preacher’s pitch, almost the entire rainbow
congregation was on its feet, carrying his
cadences (“We must come up together!”),
many weeping with exhilarated pride.
Wit: The Democratic convention of
1984 will be remembered for oratory—for
the substance of speeches, the perform-
ances that accompanied them and the his-
tory-making settings in which they were


phones and walkie-talkies. Top aides John
Reilly and Bob Beckel worked with Joan
Mondale to convert undecided delegates in
the VIP trailer, which was equipped with a
bar and comfortable chairs; on the floor,
leading Mondale supporters like Georgia
state Sen. Julian Bond were assigned to keep
wavering delegations in line. Despite the
seeming inevitability of the final vote, the
Hart and Jackson forces tested Mondale’s
strength, and the outcome was decided by
delicate negotiations behind the scenes.
Though discussions with both the Hart
and Jackson camps had been going on for
weeks, the deal was struck during the con-
vention itself. On Monday Mondale met
privately with Hart and Jackson, but little
was accomplished; aides for all three cam-
paigns talked through the night. At one
point Mondale’s men thought they had
reached agreement on platform concessions
with Jackson’s negotiators, but Jackson
himself said no. Then Mondale accepted
Hart’s platform plank on the use of military
force, and he agreed to help Hart retire his
debts from the primary campaign . In return,
the Hart forces backed Mondale in turning
back two of Jackson’s platform challenges—
and Jackson, in the end, was forced to dilute
his demand for strong language on affirma-
tive action.
Bear Hug: Still, the final moments were
tense. Mondale was picking up delegates
through the waning hours, but he was losing
a few, too —and in the trailers, delegate
impresario Tom Donilon’s staff was keeping
score with excruciating care. Listening to
the roll call of the states, the trackers cele-
brated their victories and mourned their
losses; as the magic number —1,967 votes —
approached, they lobbied Donilon to let
their state be the one that put Mondale over
the top. It would be New Jersey, Donilon
decided—and a suspenseful hush fell over
the trailer. Suddenly the official tally flashed
on the television screens: it was 2,021, and
Walter Mondale was the party’s 1984 nomi-
nee. The trailer exploded in a 10-minute
melee of cheers and popping corks. The most
poignant moment came 15 minutes later in a
holding room beneath the podium, where
Mondale waited before going onstage. Jack-
son was being brought into the room next
door. Mondale caught sight of him and the
two exchanged an emotional bear hug.
Mondale and Ferraro celebrated victory
by taking the weekend off—perhaps their
last real respite before the fall campaign
begins. Though the final planning begins
next week in Washington, thebroad outlines
of their strategy are already clear. Mondale
aides believe Ferraro will be an overwhelm-
ing asset to the campaign nationwide: she
can catalyze the women’s vote, she may help
win back Hart’s young urban professionals,
especially in the West, and she can lend
pizzazz to the party wherever she goes. They
are also aware that she conveys a powerful
message about Mondale himself—that he is
bold, that he is oriented toward change, that
he cares about opportunity for those who
have been left out.
No decisions have been made about their
respective campaign roles. (Will Ferraro,
for example, be Mondale’s hatchet person?)
delivered. In a moving keynote address,
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo turned “A
Tale of Two Cities,” Saint Francis of Assisi
and his own immigrant roots to the service
of the Democratic ideal. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy did his share with an introduc-
tion of Fritz Mondale that savaged the
sitting president with cutting wit. Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro’s speech was equally
powerful, although its punch derived more
from its historical import. Even Mondale
himself did a masterful job—clear and
forceful and as good-natured as the man
himself.
But it was Jackson’s speech that brought
a new music to the mainstream of Ameri-
can oratory, stirring the spirit and wrench-
ing the emotions in a way more reminis-
cent of the revival tent than the convention
hall. The prize, the praise, went to Jesse
Jackson. Without departing
from the dictates of his con-
science, he said nearly all
the things party leaders had
hoped for.
Biblical: “This is not a per-
fect party. We are not a per-
fect people,” he said. “Yet
we are called to a perfect
mission ... to feed the
hungry, to clothe the naked,
to house the homeless, to
teach the illiterate, to pro-
vide jobs for the jobless and
to choose the human race
over the nuclear race.” Jack-
son used his own patented
blend of Biblical allusion
and political promise:
“There is a time to com-
pete, and a time to coop-
erate. I ask for your vote
on the first ballot as a vote
for a new direction for
this party and this nation
. . . But I will be proud to
support the nominee of
this convention.” He in-
voked the alliances of the
past: “The team that got
us here must be expand-
ed, not abandoned,” he
said, referring to Jews
who had died in the
cause of civil rights. And
he addressed the fu-
ture: “Young America —
dream! . . . Preach and
dream!” He ended with a
variation of the battle cry
that marked his debut in

the race for the nomination: “Our time has
come! Our faith, hope and dreams have
prevailed . . . America, our time has come!
We come from disgrace to amazing grace.
Our time has come!”
When it was over, Jackson held the con-
vention, at least, in his hands. His congrega-
tion shed tears ofjoy and pride: 67-year-old
Talley Williams of Brooklyn held a Jackson
poster in one hand and a crumpled tissue in
the other. Even the skeptics left drained but
inspired. Florida’s Gov. Bob Graham may
have put it best: “If you are a human being
and weren’t affected by what you just
heard, you may be beyond redemption.”

DOUG VANN—RANGEFINDERS
It is likely, however, that she and Mondale
will travel together this summer—an un-
usual arrangement for a candidate and his
veep. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson, Mon-
dale aides say, can be helpful to the ticket as
well. Jackson will devote his time to voter
registration, probably with substantial fi-
nancial backing from the DNC.
The campaign kickoff will come in early
August, somewhere in the South —a region
that, by common consensus, is critical for
the Democrats. Mondaie’s men expect to do
well in the Middle West and in the North-
east: Ferraro’s strength among both women
and Italian-Americans gives the Democrats
new hope in New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio,
Illinois and Michigan. They also hope to
make some inroads in Reagan’s western
turf —in Oregon and Washington, for exam-
ple, and perhaps in California as well. Chip-
ping away in the South, however, is all-
important: by most calculations, Mondale
and Ferraro urgently need to pick up at least
60 electoral votes there, and they must do so
without much hope of winning Florida.
Democratic polling expert William Hamil-
ton says Georgia, Louisiana and Texas are
theoretically winnable; together, those
states are worth 51 electoral votes.
Yuppie Problem: Beyond that regional
calculus, the Democrats have two overrid-
ing goals. One is to expand the Democratic
electorate by registering new voters: by
some estimates, as many as 15 million wom-
en are currently unregistered, and the Mon-
dale camp has every intention of increasing
registration among blacks and Hispanics as
well. If all goes according to plan, as many
as 14 million new voters will be added to the
rolls, and total turnout in November will
reach 100 million voters for the first time in
U.S. history. The other goal is tougher:
recapturing voters who went Republican in
1980. Many are ethnic Americans from
blue-collar backgrounds: the Democrats’
flag-and-family imagery, together with Fer-
raro’s Catholic, Italian-American heritage,
should help. Another big group, however,
are “yuppies”—younger, better-educated
voters whose politics are in flux. Speaker
O’Neill, for one, sees the yuppie vote as the
Democrats’ “biggest problem” —and some
experts believe that winning the allegience
of the wayward baby-boom generation may
decide whether the Democrats will contin-
ue as the nation’s majority party.
What it all portends is one of the most
closely contested elections in a generation
or more —real combat, to judge by Mon-
dale’s speech, that will offer the voters a
definitive choice. The choice is regional,
ideological, social and personal —nothing is
blurred. Mondale and Ferraro represent the
rust belt’s struggles with industrial decay;
Reagan and Bush represent the sun belt’s
chaotic growth. Mondale and Ferraro stand
for the evolving liberal tradition; Reagan
and Bush for the conservative renaissance.
Mondale, in choosing Ferraro, has pre-
empted the women’s issue, and by exten-
sion, the aspirations of the nation’s minor-
ities; Reagan and Bush, by choice or not,
symbolize the politics of the white Ameri-
can male. Mondale, always earnest, stands
for compassion and conciliation; Reagan,
always amiable, stands for stern morality
and hard choices. “They’ve drawn the
line,” one Reagan aide said happily. “This is
the clearest election choice since ’72.”
Future Shock: Leading Democrats know
perfectly well what is at stake in ’B4—and
some wonder whether Walter Mondale is
the right man to lead their party through a
critical electoral test. His grudging victory
in the primaries inspires little confidence:
Mondale won his war of attrition against
Gary Hart on the familiar terrain of interest-
group liberalism, but Hart ran away with the
future. Now the future is Mondale’s own
best drawing card with the voters and he is
plainly trying to make it work —but the
party’s Young Turks are uncertain that he is
ready to do so. “If Mondale runs in the
general election as he randn the primaries,
we lose,” Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware
says flatly. Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt says
Mondale needs “divine intervention” to car-
ry his state. “If we don’t elect him, there will
be a massive and protracted struggle to put
the old wine into new bottles,” Babbitt says.
“The Democratic Party is now built on in-
terest groups, and it will be very tough to
manage the change.” It may be even tough-
er, Babbitt suggests, to manage that transi-
tion during an uphill presidential campaign.
But it is now too late for doubts. The
Democrats, ready or not, have their nomi-
nee —and Walter Mondale has his work cut
out for him. In Ronald Reagan, he faces a
president who is armored in personal popu-
larity and who is riding the crest of a well-
timed economic recovery. As much as Mon-
dale roars about the imminence of fiscal
disaster, the polls show more voters still
think Reagan is better able to keep the coun-
try prosperous. As Democrat after Demo-
crat said last week, that means Mondale’s
best hope is for some unexpected bad news —
a sudden jump in interest rates or unemploy-
ment, a foreign-policy slip or even a Reagan
head cold to underscore the president’s age.
Meanwhile, the Democrats have no choice
but to slug it out and wait for a break. “We’ve
got a shot at it,” said one weary West Coast
pol last week, “but it’s going to be tough.”

OLYMPICS Los Angeles
Let The
Games
Begin
The torch is even now making its way
along the rocky coast, nearing the end
of a long journey that will see it, by the
weekend, carried in triumph across
the freeways to the Olympic stadium:
a symbolic link between the ancients
and ourselves, ignited by the sun and
kept alive by propane, brought from
the cradle of Western civilization to the city that is
sometimes accused of being the death of it; and
there it will burn, a signal that the Olympic ideal
still lives —and, incidentally, that there really is
oxygen in the atmosphere of Los Angeles.
Breathe deeply of it, then: oxygen may be the
only indispensable commodity that is not the
product of one of the official sponsors of an
Olympics as notable for the pervasive presence
of Coke and Levi Strauss as for the absence of
Russia, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Soon
the air will be as full of flags (Pageantry World
Inc., official flag makers), of cheers in a dozen
languages (Monterey Institute of International
Studies, official translators) and hyperbole (ABC,
official broadcaster) as it is of auto exhaust (Atlan-
tic Richfield, official gasoline), and even time itself
will be divided into official Olympic seconds by
Longines-Wittnauer. It was, perhaps, an inevita-
ble development: Olympics, which once were
mounted by mere governments, have gotten so
expensive that only corporations can afford to
sponsor them. Hand in hand with this develop-
ment has come an easing of the hypocritical divi-
sion between amateur and professional. Athletes
who have competed professionally, or who have
made millions from endorsements, will take the
field in Los Angeles without Zeus striking them
dead. Yet the Games themselves are inviolate; for
a pole-vaulter to cover himself like a race-car
driver with the names of beers and chewing tobac-
co remains as unthinkable as Agamemnon taking
the stage in a Caterpillar hat. However they earn
their livings, for the span of an event, or the length
of a race, athletes compete only for themselves,
and they-advertise only their countries.
The nonappearance of athletes from 15 Soviet-
bloc countries struck some observers as evidence
that the 20th century has proven itself unworthy
to carry the Olympic flame, although the Greeks
themselves would probably not have been trou-
bled; it never bothered them that the Persians
failed to field a team in Athens, let alone the
Aztecs. It has been suggested that future Olym-
pics could be held only in neutral territory; what
the Russians overlooked, it seems, is that —other
than politically —Los Angeles in many ways is
neutral territory. Its unassimilated ethnic groups
are so numerous and diverse as to effectively
cancel each other out. Psychologically, the Ange-
leno tends toward the detachment of those who
view the world mostly through their windshields;
the entertainment community pays a grudging
tribute to the Olympics by conceding that they
will probably lure the public away from the mov-
ies. Yet even in the most chic precincts of Los
Angeles, where for months it has been fashionable
to look on the Olympics as a chance to spend two
weeks out of town, there has been a noticeable
retreat from cynicism over the last few weeks, as
the preparations moved toward the one thing that
Hollywood finds irresistible: a premiere.
The actors are in place, the props are ready: 141
teams, with their flags, their horses and bicycles
and bows and arrows, the sheet music for 141
national anthems. With the Russians absent, it has
taken on less the nature of a political thriller than a
good-natured spectacular: The Rainbow Compe-
titions. The script has yet to be written, of course,
but few doubt that it will end happily for America,
or that there is some pigtailed little girl who is
going out there a gymnast, but coming back a star.
So unfurl the flags, tint the smog with the sacred
smoke of the torch. Take a deep breath, and let the
Games begin.

For Gold and Glory
From the major sports to the esoteric, many of the
world’s athletes are primed for a show of shows.
When it happens, deep into the Games,
we will know why we are watching: the
moment may stay with us as a kind of
spiritual souvenir. Indeed, it is already
possible to envision the climactic wom-
en’s 3,000 meters:
Zola Budd—the 17-year-old South Af-
rican sensation whom the British hustled
onto their already powerful track team —
is running, in the lead. But not for long.
For there, on the outside, goes America’s
Mary Decker, the madonna of the middle
distances. The thing about Decker, 25, is
that she demands to control the pace. But
the thing about this showdown is that
Budd is also every inch a front runner.
So, here we are in midrace, and these
women have already traded places on the
front end three . . . hang on, here comes
Budd again. Better make that “several
spine-tingling” times.
It is just possible, in fact, that no mat-
ter what happens on Friday, Aug. 10,
many spines won’t stop tingling until
around Christmas. Athletes around the
world seem primed for their show of
shows. Decker, a legend in her own re-
cord-breaking times, speaks testily of the
challenger she has never met, saying that
Budd has “yet to prove herself in interna-
tional competition” and that, anyway,
she doesn’t compete against “personal-
ities.” Traces of that edgy brio have been
turning up consistently among the
Americans gathering in the Olympic vil-
lage. Gymnast Mary Lou Retton wants
the world to know that she’s no pigtailed
wimp, almost as much as she wants to
beat her look-alike Romanian rival, Eca-
terina Szabo. Diver Greg Louganis can’t
wait to crown his career with a gold
medal and end his amphibious existence.
And Rita Crockett, 26, a top gun of a
strong volleyball squad, insists that “if
we do our best, there is no way in the
world that anyone can come close to us.”
Thanks to stars like Decker and quad-
ruple-threat Carl Lewis, 23, America’s
track team could have an off meet and
still walk away with the most medals.
Lewis is something akin to a sure thing in
the long jump, although his attempt to
break Bob Beamon’s 16-year-old record
of 29 feet 2.5 inches may be scotched by
the L.A. Coliseum’s tricky winds. His
other events are the 100- and 200-meter
dashes and the 4xloo-meter relay. In the
former two, Lewis figures to lead an
across-the-board sweep for American
sprinters; what makes the latter event
interesting is that Carl will be teamed
with some of the same athletes who have
often criticized him for playing to the
crowds, missing a pre-Olympic tuneup
meet and generally flaunting his stunning
superiority.
Expect Lewis to extend a hand for the
baton —but no apologies. Though he
hasn’t speculated much in public (he now
deals in formal press conferences and
photo opportunities), no one believes that
he will quit raising his arms triumphantly
as he crosses the finish line (a habit that
has cost him at least one world record).
“I think it proves that fans like competi-
tion,” says Carl. “They don’t necessarily
like records.”
If that’s the case, they may soon be
talking a lot about Zhu Jianhua. The
6-foot-4 high-jumper is the world-record
holder (with a leap of 7 feet 10 inches).
He is the main hope of the People’s
Republic of China, which has sent a
contingent of 224 athletes for its first
Summer Olympics since 1952. Zhu, 21, is
a hero at home, pursued by autograph
seekers. But in big meets he’s been prone
to debilitating fits of depression. That is
something that never troubled his chat-
terbox of a challenger, Californian
Dwight Stones. A part-time TV com-
mentator, Stones, 30, is as famous for his
Mickey Mouse T shirts and constant self-
lecturing as he is for his actual jumps. He
qualified for the games with an Ameri-

can-record leap of 7 feet 8 inches.
Marathoner Joan Benoit is the antith-
esis of Stones, when you can find her. As
is her custom, the 27-year-old runner has
been preparing for a climactic confronta-
tion with Norway’s Grete Waitz, 30, in
her native Maine, far from the madding
media. Benoit, who won the Olympic-
trials race just two weeks after undergo-
ing knee surgery, lowered the world re-
cord to 2:22.43 a year ago in Boston.
However, she must return to that form —
and overcome her penchant for setting a
too-fast early pace—to hold off not just
the unflappable Waitz (a five-time win-
ner of the New York Marathon) but
fellow Norwegian Ingrid Kristiansen.
Among the male 26.2-milers, Cuban-
born Alberto Salazar looms as America’s
best bet, although he’s a decided under-
dog to Australia’s Rob de Castella and
Japan’s Toshihiko Seko. Possessed of
knock-knees and a slightly gawky run-
ning form, de Castella makes up in stam-
ina what he lacks in style; for the past five
years he has logged an average of 100
miles a week. Lately, though, “Deek” has
been lagging a bit in his tuneup races, and
Australians, who consider him their best
hope for a medal, have begun to worry
about how he will stack up against the
African marathon specialists.
But then, uncertainty has always been
one of the hallmarks of Olympic compe-
tition. Even the best prepared athletes
can be stricken by unexpected setbacks.
A slow recovery from the flu recently
hampered Italy’s 10,000-meter star, Al-
berto Cova. But a grueling regimen of
five-hour daily workouts since then has
helped to whip Cova, 25, back into
shape—and made him the favorite to
beat Portuguese rival Fernando Ma-
mede, the current world-record holder.
The prognosis is a bit more questionable
for British middle-distance ace Steve
Cram, 23. Coming off an ankle injury,
Cram has lost a few races, including a
humiliating last-place finish at a recent
meet. Cram will have to be in top form if
he is to edge teammate Steve Ovett in the
1,500 at Los Angeles.
The same could be said for British
decathlon star Daley Thompson, who
will be squaring off" against West Ger-
many’s Jurgen Hingsen, whose 6-foot-
-6%, 228-pound frame might have been
carved from a solid block of oak. Until
recently, Thompson, 26, who won the
two-day event at the 1980 Games in Mos-
cow, was considered a sure bet to do it
again. But Thompson, the son of a Niger-
ian father and a Scottish mother, has
been having trouble with one of his key
events, the high jump. His difficulties
have increased the possibility that cur-
rent world-record holder Hingsen, 26,
who has never beaten Thompson in the

IONY DUFFY—DUOMO


eight times they have competed
head to head, might take the gold.
In any case, says Hingsen, “this
time I will not allow myself to be
influenced by Daley’s psychologi-
cal tricks.”
Swimming has traditionally
been an American strong suit.
But the impending clashes be-
tween Victor Davis, 20, of Can-
ada, and America’s John Moffet,
20, in the 100- and 200-meter
breast stroke are simply too close
to call. Moffet finally appeared to
shrug off the disappointment of
the 1980 boycott at last month’s
Olympic trials, where he beat his
teammate Steve Lundquist at 100
meters in the world-record time
of 1:02.13. Davis, meanwhile, has
matched that impressive creden-
tial with a world record of 2:14.58
at 200.
While they thrash it out, how-
ever, many of the fans will be
watching native New Yorker
Rick Carey, 21, the record holder
in the 100- and 200-meter back-
stroke, and perhaps the single
best performer in the pool. It will
also be hard to miss West Ger-
many’s Michael Gross. At 6 feet
7Vi, Gross has such a large “wing
span” in the butterfly that his
countrymen have dubbed him the “Alba-
tross from Offenbach.” As the world 200-
meterbutterfly champion and the holder
of the 200-meter freestyle record, Gross,
20, is also being hailed as the next Mark
Spitz. But probably no swimmers in Los
Angeles will be holding their heads high-
er than Hiroko Nagasaki and her fellow
breast-strokers on the Japanese team.
Their bowed-neck style is what distin-
De Castella: Short on style, but long on stamina
PAUL JBSUTTON— DUOMO
guishes them from other swimmers—and
Nagasaki may keep a high profile out of
the pool as well. A member of her coun-
try’s 1980 Olympic team when she was
just 11 years old, Nagasaki is a solid bet
to win the 100- and 200-meter breast
stroke this time around.
When the men are onstage in the gym-
nastics hall, most eyes will be riveted on a
pair of risk takers: native Angeleno
Mitch Gaylord, 23, and Li Ning,
20, of China. Gaylord has been
threatening to attempt an exotic
new maneuver on the high bar
that, he says, could either cost
him the competition or result in a
gold medal. In any case, he’ll
need something spectacular to
show up Li, who has been hailed
as the world’s most creative gym-
nast since he swept six of seven
gold medals at the world cham-
pionships two years ago. On the
women’s side, Ma Yanhong
should duplicate teammate Li’s
breathtaking daredeviltry.
Of course not every Olympian
will be center stage, basking in
the television floodlights. But
even such esoteric sports as
Greco-Roman wrestling, yacht-
ing and trap shooting have their
devoted followings. In the case of
archery, the 4,000 daily tickets
for Long Beach’s El Dorado Park
were sold out long ago. Another
tough ticket is the soccer finals;
every one of the Rose Bowl’s
104,000 seats is gone—pretty im-
pressive since no one knows
who’s going to play. However,
with three of the top four teams
boycotting, Yugoslavia looms as
the overwhelming favorite, with
the other medals up for grabs.
The usually lackluster United States
team, meanwhile, has gotten every break
imaginable. It qualified automatically as
the host country; a March ruling by the
international football federation allowed
the inclusion of 12 unabashed pros and a
California senator recently sponsored a
bill that effectively bent the citizenship
rules so that West German-born star

Jean Willrich could become an American
Olympian. But all to no avail, it seems. If
U.S. coach Alkis Panagoulias can get
past even a couple of the crack European
squads, who also benefited from the rules
allowing professionals, he will be a certi-
fied soccer hero.
The men’s volleyball tournament will
also be be something less than world
caliber, due to the absence of the Soviets
and Poles. But the women’s matches
promise to provide more than their share
of diving saves and gym-rattling spikes.
Leading the favored U.S. team will be
probably the most dominant player in the
world, 6-foot-5 Flo Hyman, whose awe-
some smashes can leave opponents duck-
ing for cover. China’s highly rated squad
is strong on defense. But it is the Brazil-
ians—tall, talented, but unpredictable—
who could pose the most serious chal-
lenge to the Americans. The way the
draw is set up, the U.S. team will have to
beat the Brazilians in order to advance to
the semifinal round.
The worst news comes from the world
of weight lifting, where the entire compe-
tition appears to be in disarray. For
starters, no sport was hurt more by the
boycott; the world champion in each of
the 10 weight divisions hails from a com-
munist country. (Most likely to be
missed: Naim Suleimanov of Bulgaria, a
16-year-old in the 123 !4 -pound class
who is the second lifter ever to raise three
times his own weight in the clean and
jerk.) What’s left in this usually highly
visible area is a tepid liftoff between Ro-
mania and Japan. The American team —
still recovering from the steroid scandal
that rocked last summer’s Pan Am
games —will compete in only seven divi-
sions and without any real chance
of a medal.
The equestrian events, however, will
go on as if the the Great Nyet had never
been uttered. This means that the British,
who complain about smog more than the
Soviets ever did, will be the team to beat
and that their terrific three-day eventer,
Lucinda Green, could make the Games
her personal showcase. Green, 30, is the
only equestrian ever to win England’s
Badminton Horse Trials on six different
mounts; she also won both the team and
individual gold medals at the world
championships in 1982. For the Olympic
event, which includes cross-country,
dressage and show jumping, she will
probably ride a 12-year-old gelding
named Regal Realm. Ironically, she
bought the horse from Australia’s Mer-
vyn Bennett, who is generally considered
her stiffest competition. But Green evi-
dently knows what it will take to win.
“You can’t put too much pressure on a
horse,” she says. The same might be said
for the gold-medal hopefuls coming to
Los Angeles on two legs.

A SPECIAL SURVEY ON
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
SPONSORED BY THE INSTITUTE
OF ASIAN ECONOMIES
The Korean people have risen
to the challenges of history
By John F. Mason
■ Except for a brief interrup-
tion from late 1979 to early
1981, during the very worst of
the world recession, the Re-
public of Korea has moved
steadily and rapidly forward. A
small, mountainous country of
40 million people, lacking nat-
ural resources and plagued by
hostility from the north, South
Korea has in slightly more than two decades
emerged from a marginally subsistent agricultural
country into one of Asia's major industrial nations.
Today the Republic of Korea commands respect
throughout the world for its economic strength and
for its growing stature in the world community—a
nation the World Bank calls "one of the outstand-
ing success stories of international development."
After a remarkably prosperous 1983, Korea is
preparing to take still further strides. The country's
industrial planners, responsible for shifting develop-
ment emphasis from labor-intensive light manufac-
turing to heavy industry in the past decade, are to-
day giving new priority to the
production of high technology
products. In a few years Korea
expects to be at least third in
the world in semiconductor
sales and a substantial produc-
er of data processing and tele-
communications products.
Additionally, both the public
and private sectors are putting
tremendous effort into the design of innovative,
high value-added products for export. Industrial
leaders believe the new products will eventually
penetrate the protectionist walls they see rising in
foreign markets.
TRYING HARDER
Korea's dramatic rise from a war-torn, divided
land to what is arguably the world's most advanced
"newly industrializing country" has been attributed
in part to its handicaps, challenges of history and
circumstance which have acted as a special kind of
adrenalin for planners and citizens alike.


The Economy
• With education discouraged under
36 years of foreign annexation, the de-
sire for education became a national ob-
session once freedom arrived. In 1961
when Korea ranked 60th among 74 de-
veloping countries in per capita income,
it already ranked 14th in "sociological
development." Today there is almost no
illiteracy in Korea.
• The lack of natural resources forced
Korea to devise economic strategies that
encouraged high worker productivity
and innovative manufacturing tech-
niques. Per capita annual GNP in 1961
stood at $B7; in 1983 per capita GNP
topped $l,BOO per person.
• The military threat from the north
and the resulting need for extraordinary
defense expenditures—approximately 6
percent of GNP—-have spurred the
country to meet these costs with unpar-
alleled rates of economic growth. Annu-
al GNP growth over the last 20 years has
averaged 8 percent.
The Korean people are achievers. Ko-
rea's greatest natural resource is, in fact,
its educated, motivated and industrious
populace. Putting in six-day work-weeks
in the offices and factories, Korean
workers have been the backbone of the
country's rapid progress.
CATCHING TWO RABBITS
Prosperity has brought prestige and a
growing sense of global responsibility.
President Chun Doo Hwan, who took
office in 1980, has led the country to-
ward a more active involvement in inter-
national affairs, taking steps that have
raised him, as head of state, and Korea,
as a dynamic Asian power, to new
heights of world respect.
President Chun has initiated political
and social change at home, has strength-
ened ties with the developed countries
and the Third World, and has succeeded
in attracting major international events,

journalist and consultant. Peter tHyun,
author of numerous books on Korea,
served as consultant.
including the 1988 Summer Olympics,
to Korea. Further, the President has
urged the North Koreans to sit down to
discuss sincerely a means of reunifying
the divided land —though so far without
results.
As notable as these initiatives in inter-
national affairs are, the administration's
most remarkable achievements may be
economic: Korea's galloping growth rate
has been accelerated while inflation
slowed —a feat the President has com-
pared to the old Korean proverb about
catching two rabbits at the same time.
In mid-1980 a terrible harvest and
world recession had brought down the
curtain on a decade of heady, though in-
flationary, growth: that year, Korea's
economy contracted 6.2 percent. It re-
bounded in 1981, growing 6.4 percent
that year, 5.6 percent in 1982, and a re-
markable 9.3 percent in 1983. Mean-
while, interest rates and inflation were
reduced —prices rose only 3.4 percent in
1983. Though the price stability is due in
part to recent declines in oil and com-
modity prices, the government has con-
tributed with policies to dampen wage-
push pressure, reduce government
support prices for rice and eliminate oth-
er structural sources of inflation.
Korea's comeback in 1982 was due to
a surge in domestic economic activity,
mainly construction, rather than export
growth. But last year the export econo-
my, led by the U.S. recovery, moved
back into high gear; in 1983 exports ac-
counted for 70 percent of GNP growth.
Domestic growth also continued,
spreading to investment in capital equip-
ment and consumption. Unemployment,
already lower than in most of the devel-
oped world, declined from 5.2 percent
in 1980 to 4.2 percent in 1983.
For the next few years the economy is
expected to remain strong, growing at
least 8 percent a year. A number of in-
ternal factors contribute:
• The labor force will expand twice as
fast as the general population. The aver-
age worker will have fewer dependents
to support and can thus save more, help-
ing meet the country's investment re-
quirements without fueling inflation.
• The well-educated work force is in-
creasingly well equipped to adopt more
technology from abroad. Higher per
capita productivity and new high-tech-
nology products should result.
• Korea's own domestic market is ex-
panding rapidly due to population
growth and greater general affluence.
But Korean industrialists believe their
greatest growth will continue to come
from global markets, because their cur-
rent portion of world trade is still only 1
percent. Winning a greater share—and
preserving economic momentum —will
require a coordinated effort—holding on
to all-important markets for construction
and light manufacturing while moving
their export base upscale to avoid pro-
tectionist measures. Doing so is perhaps
the country's greatest economic chal-
lenge.
STOKING GROWTH WITH EXPORTS
The emphasis on foreign markets is
not new. Since the start of the first Five-
Year Plan more than 20 years ago, the
rapid expansion of Korea's exports has
been the principal engine of growth.
Shipments have increased at a dazzling
rate, shifting in concentration over time
from light manufacturing to heavy indus-
try. Total exports grew from $lO billion
in 1977 to over $23.1 billion in 1983. In
1984, exports will account for a full 35
percent of GNP.
As exports have grown, so have the
competitive capabilities of other devel-
oping nations and protectionist senti-
ments of important trading partners. To
sustain export growth in this environ-
ment, businesses are adjusting produc-
tion strategies. Korean manufacturers are
improving product quality and diversify-
ing both product lines and markets. The
Commerce Ministry is spending $470
million this year for a "quality control
center" aimed at bolstering the Korean
reputation for quality goods.
The government is also encouraging
the replacement of obsolete facilities in
traditional industries such as textiles.
New products are being developed to
meet the changing tastes of foreign con-
sumers; small-lot production of high-
quality and high-value-added products is
being expanded. Information systems
providing data on foreign markets and
technology are being sponsored by the
government.
At the core of the nation's export
strategy is a concentrated push toward
high technology. Both government and
industry are putting more money into ef-
forts to design and manufacture technol-
ogy-based products not protected by
foreign import tariffs and quotas.
The move toward higher tech and
lower costs holds benefits for Korea's
trading partners: in the push the Koreans
have become active licensers of foreign
technologies. Since 1966 Korean busi-
nesses have signed 2,777 technology
cooperation agreements with foreign
Cutting Red Tape For Investors
Korea's new Foreign Capital Inducement Law went into effect on July 1, the first
major revision of laws governing foreign investment in more than a decade.
Among its provisions, the law . . .
• Concentrates authority in the Ministry of Finance to approve investments of up to
50 percent foreign equity that do not require a special tax holiday;
• Grants automatic approval for foreign investments up to $3 million in areas not
prohibited in a "negative list" to be promulgated by the Ministry of Finance;
• Lifts virtually all restrictions on repatriation and remittance of capital, profits and
dividends. It also extends the pay-in period for initial investment to 24 months and
permits reinvestment of dividends in areas other than the original investment;
• Retains the present automatic exemption from customs duties, taxes for special
consumption and value-added tax on capital goods imported for an approved for-
eign investment;
• Retains the possibility of a five-year, 100 percent tax holiday now available after
a review by the interested ministries. The program does eliminate the six- to
eight-year, 50 percent corporate income tax holiday. □□


companies. In 1983 U.S. companies
were paid $6O million in fees and royal-
ties by Korean firms.
IMPORTS AND FOREIGN DEBT
For all of the emphasis on exports, Ko-
rea still buys more abroad than it sells:
the country is heavily dependent upon
imports of raw materials and crude oil.
In 1983 Korea's balance-of-trade deficit
was $1.7 billion, and the country has
amassed $4O billion in foreign debt,
fourth largest in the world. To date the
size of the debt has not constrained Ko-
rea's access to funds —the country's
1983 debt service ratio was 15.4 per-
cent, down from 15.9 percent in 1982
and comfortably within the guidelines of
international lenders. Nevertheless, it is
clear that the country depends on con-
tinued export growth to service its debt
and further narrow deficits.
OVER THE BARRIERS
Despite the country's debt status and
per capita GNP of only $l,BOO (com-
pared, for instance, to Japan's $10,000)
developed country reception of Korea's
export drive has been cautious, even
cool. Both the U.S. and Japan—Korea's
largest trading partners, together ac-
counting for 47 percent of the country's
trade —have policies which constrain
Korean access to their markets. One of
the nation's principal diplomatic con-
cerns is dealing with trade restrictions
placed on Korean-made goods.
To help win continued access to over-
seas markets, the Korean government is
relaxing its own import restrictions: over
the next four years, 75 percent of those
items currently on the country's "re-
stricted” list will be removed, putting
Korea's free trade status on par with
many developed nations. Protective tar-
iffs will also be reduced over this period.
Under consideration is a two-year lib-
eralization plan that would greatly ex-
pand market areas for foreign banks,
putting them on a nearly equal basis with
Korean banks. Forty-eight foreign bank
branches and 21 representative offices
are presently operating in Korea.
A key provision of the liberalization
plan would give foreign banks access to
the Bank of Korea's rediscount facility,
thus improving access to won funds; it
would also permit foreign banks to fi-
nance exports for Korean companies. In
exchange, foreign banks would be re-
quired to allocate some of their funds for
loans to small and medium-sized indus-
tries and to buy specific amounts of gov-
ernment monetary stabilization bonds.
Allowing entry of more imports, and
admitting foreign companies and banks,
will give domestic industry more compe-
tition and, in general, encourage interna-
tional trade. In the long run, Korean
economists argue, protectionism is
counterproductive to trade worldwide.
As an official of the Economic Planning
Board points out, "The more Korea sells,
the more we buy.” □□

Seeking Joint Ventures
■ Potential foreign investors in Korea's
phenomenal growth who were waiting
for better incentives now have them. On
July 1, 1984 the first major revision of
Korea's laws governing foreign invest-
ment in a decade went into effect (see
box, this spread).
Even before July investment began to
pick up. But the government believes
that, due to the new incentives, invest-
ment will be even better in the second
half. To date in 1983 investors have
been primarily interested in high tech-
nology, such as electronics, whereas
those in 1981 and 1982 were investing
in machinery, food processing and phar-
maceuticals. Other areas of current in-
terest include automotive parts and
medical equipment.
Joint ventures are an increasingly pop-
ular form of corporate investment, al-
lowing foreign partners to take advan-
tage of Korea's manufacturing expertise.
"Although we are still quite a way be-
hind the Japanese as far as high technol-
ogy design is concerned, we have a
proven capability to manufacture high
quality products at low cost,” says Kim
Woo Choong, chairman of the Daewoo
Group, the Korean conglomerate.
"We work well with companies from
developed countries that provide tech-
nology and marketing while we supply
the manufacturing,” Kim says. "They
give us the 'software' and we give them
the 'hardware'.”
Daewoo, with sales of $6.2 billion last
year, entered an arrangement with the
Caterpillar Tractor Co. under which Cat-
erpillar will supply the design for a new
forklift vehicle. Daewoo will be the sole
manufacturer of the new vehicles, build-
ing them at its plant in Inchon; Caterpil-
lar will sell them throughout the world,
including the United States. Daewoo has
other ventures with General Motors, ITT
and Canada's Northern Telecom.
Kim believes this kind of partnership is
the wave of the future: "The developed
countries will concentrate more on de-
veloping and selling technology, and
countries such as Korea will do the man-
ufacturing. This kind of joint venture is
profitable for both parties.” □□

The Quest for Peace and Growth
Yang and um, heaven and earth: Symbols on the Korean flag represent universal balance and harmony
' The leaders of Korea's Fifth Republic have set an ambitious course,, promoting

■ Significant changes have taken place
since Chun Doo Hwan took office as
president of the Republic on September
1, 1980. Promising to build a "Great Ko-
rea" and revitalize the economy, the
new administration set out to reform the
political structure of the country, sharp-

dards of living and education, and reach
out internationally to the developed
world, to the nations of the Pacific Basin

Chun administration promulgated a new
constitution, enhancing the functions
and powers of the National Assembly
and limiting the President to a single
term of seven years. In the years since,
the administration has taken steps to
strengthen political institutions and re-
pair social division. Among the achieve-
ments of the past four years:
• Universities have been granted au-
tonomy and police removed from the
campuses. Students are now free to
demonstrate on campus. And some
1,400 students previously expelled be-
cause of participation in demonstrations
are being allowed to re-enroll.
• Amnesty has been granted to some
400 political dissidents and student dem-
onstrators. The names of more than 200
dissidents have been removed from a
roster of those prohibited from political
activity.
• Regulations covering overseas travel
have been liberalized, and citizens are
freer to travel abroad.
• A new law regarding the procedures
of the National Assembly has resulted in
a less confrontational style in political
debate. To lend his weight to the influ-
ence of the Assembly, President Chun
delivers a major policy statement before
it each January.
• The Advisory Council on State Af-
fairs—a body including political, aca-
demic and religious leaders —was estab-
lished for citizen consultation with the
President on key issues and policies.
Despite such reforms, political liberal-
ization has not proceeded quickly
enough for some Koreans, and banned
politicians continue to have a following.
In justifying their go-slow approach to
liberalization, government officials point
to the "generation gap.” "Policy makers
have had to cope with generations of
Koreans with different degrees of under-
standing about the political situation of
the peninsula,” explains an authority of
the Democratic Justice Party. "The
seemingly deaf ear of the government is
not deaf at all—it's just more precisely
tuned to the threat of the communists in
the north.”
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Shortly after taking office, President
Chun began a program of international
travel and outreach which has brought
world attention to Korea's achieve-
ments. Chun himself visited the United
States (in February 1981, he was the first
head of state to be received by President
Reagan's new administration), the coun-
tries of ASEAN, Canada and four African
nations —Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal and
Gabon. His envoys have traveled to
Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Sudan,
Mauritania and four nations of the Arabi-
an Gulf. In return Seoul has played host
to Pope John Paul II and 11 heads of
state —including President Reagan and
Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan.
Relations with Japan have climbed to
heights once unimaginable: Prime Minis-
ter Nakasone's visit in 1983 capped the
approval of a $4 billion government loan
to Korea, a symbol, the Koreans feel, of
Japan's respect for their recent strides.


Korea has become a center for world
conferences and other international
events. Last September, Seoul hosted the
70th Inter-Parliamentary Union Confer-
ence and the 53rd ASTA World Travel
Congress. The World Bank and Interna-
tional Monetary Fund meetings will be
held in Seoul in 1985. Most visibly, per-
haps, Korea has been chosen to host the
1988 Summer Olympics; preparations
for the Games, as well as the 1986 Asian
Games, are well under way. Despite re-
cent controversy surrounding the Soviet-
led withdrawal from the 1984 Olympics,
Korea remains dedicated to seeking full
international participation in the 1988
games and to making the Olympiad a fo-
rum for world harmony.
SOUTH/SOUTH COOPERATION
Korea has assumed a leadership role
in fostering a pact of cooperation with
other developing nations. Korea's own
memories of colonial rule are recent,
and it enthusiastically supports the prin-
ciples of the Non-Aligned Movement. In
1983, as part of Korea's dedication to
South/South cooperation, representa-
tives from 62 nations—students, engi-
neers, government officials —came to
Korea to study aspects of the country's
technical, managerial and industrial suc-
cess. Since 1963, more than 4500 dele-
gates have studied the Korean model.
President Chun Doo Hwan
The country's outreach to the South is
only one aspect of President Chun's vi-
sion for international cooperation. In
1982 the President proposed a Pacific
Basin summit conference, assembling
the leaders of the Pacific —those respon-
sible for the world's fastest growing
economies—to discuss matters of mutu-
al concern. The goals of the summit —
expanding trade, improving transporta-
tion and communication, promoting
education and cultural exchange and of-
fering a common perception of security
needs —reflect a long-range faith in the
region's stability and growth potential.
REUNIFICATION
The close presence of an openly hos-
tile neighbor to the north —only three
minutes away by jet aircraft—weighs
upon the Korean people and significantly
affects government policy, domestic and
foreign. Thirty-one years after a cease-
fire formally divided the peninsula and
Korean families, there are still grim re-
minders of North Korea's bitterness. Oc-
tober's bomb blast in Rangoon, believed
to be the work of North Korean terror-
ists, killed 21 people, including four
South Korean cabinet members.
Since the founding of the Fifth Repub-
lic, President Chun has attempted to
open talks which might lead to peaceful
reunification of Korea. Early in 1982, af-
ter two unanswered invitations to North
Korean president Kim 11-Sung, Chun
made public a "Formula for National
Reconciliation and Democratic Unifica-
tion." The Formula, which suggests steps
toward the restoration of trust between
the countries, such as postal exchange,
the reunion of separated families, and
the resumption of trade, has so far borne
no fruit, but the administration is con-
tinuing its efforts.
ECONOMIC REFORMS
In addition to political and internation-
al programs, the government has initiat-
ed reforms in economic policy and plan-
ning aimed to induce industrial growth in
line with world prices and demand,
technological progress and shifts in com-
parative advantage. The direction is to-
ward greater reliance on market mecha-
nisms rather than government allocation.
The administration has restructured
the industrial incentive system by begin-
ning to phase out a program of preferen-
tial tax and credit treatment for "strate-
gic industries." The change mandates
equal treatment of all types of invest-
ment and industrial development, creat-
ing an environment for industries to
compete on their own merits. To in-
crease agricultural productivity, the ad-
ministration has begun to phase out
price supports while expanding credit fa-
cilities for mechanization. Maximum
marginal income tax rates, both corpo-
rate and personal, have been reduced.
These efforts have been buttressed by
a gradual deregulation of those sectors
that had been controlled by the govern-
ment. The government has sold its share
of the country's banks; the number of
price-controlled commodities has been
reduced; and direct tax preferences have
been replaced by a system of indirect in-
centives covering depreciation and in-
vestment in manpower development.
The administration's efforts to im-
prove income distribution are based
upon the expansion of employment op-
portunities through rapid, but non-infla-
tionary, growth. These efforts are sup-
ported by increased educational and
vocational training expenditures. □□
THE LEGISLATURE
■ To comprehend what has happened in
Korea in recent years, one must under-
stand the man in the street whose ener-
gies and determination have transformed
the country as it is today. The National
Assembly sees itself as the voice of the
average Korean and as the link between
the people and the government.
This body has 276 members, two-
thirds (184) of whom are elected by di-
rect popular vote and the rest distributed
among parties winning at least five seats.
Sixty-one seats, or two-thirds of the 92
remaining, go to the party winning the
most seats, assuring it a working majority.
In the elections of March 25, 1981, 12
parties fielded candidates, with three win-
ning enough seats to form floor negotiat-
ing groups: the Democratic Justice Party,
the Democratic Korea Party and the Ko-
rea National Party. Five other parties won
at least one representative each.
With presidential elections slated for
1988 providing the first opportunity for a
peaceful change of government in recent
decades, the National Assembly has the
greatest potential of any branch of gov-
ernment for expanded influence.
Since the beginning of the Fifth Repub-
lic, the Assembly has had greater influ-
ence on government policy, forcing the
delay or cancellation of some projects.
The Assembly has a wide range of
functions. It deliberates and acts on legis-
lative bills, approves the national budget,
consents to the ratification of treaties, ap-
proves declarations of war, oversees gov-
The National Assembly Building, Seoul
ernment agencies and can impeach gov-
ernment officials. Central to the
Assembly's work is its role in reflecting
public opinion and of informing the peo-
ple about the conduct of public affairs.
Members of the Assembly are currently
pursuing "parliamentary diplomacy"—
explaining the basic principles and poli-
cies of the Korean government to other
peoples when they travel abroad. As part
of their visits, they exchange ideas with
their counterparts in other governments,
regardless of political persuasion, and fre-
quently invite foreign legislators to Korea
for this purpose. The success of these ef-
forts was highlighted when Korea was
chosen to host the 1983 International
Parliamentary Union Conference. Their
diplomatic role cannot be overempha-
sized as Korea's continued success de-
pends in large part of its relations with the
rest of the world. □□


People & Culture
Deep Roots
in Tradition's
Rich Earth
The folk fan dance: Beauty in symmetry and controlled exuberance
The Koreans weave a
modern success story
with old and new threads
■ First impressions tell a great deal about
the Korean people.
Moments after arrival at Kimpo Air-
port and the short drive into Seoul, the
visitor knows that Koreans value cleanli-
ness and order, color and pleasing de-
sign. The city is immaculate and well or-
ganized; the people are handsome, neat
and well dressed. The Koreans them-
selves are cheerful and spontaneous,
helpful to each other and receptive to
foreigners. Their country's economic re-
cord rounds out the view: the people are
educated and hardworking, blessed with
intelligence, creativity and patience for
painstaking detail.
5,000 YEARS
These qualities are rooted in the rich
history of a people whose ancestors
found their way to the peninsula from
the Altaic mountains by way of Manchu-
ria some 5,000 years ago. It is a tradition
of one language and one people, strong-
ly influenced by the beliefs and outlooks
of Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian
codes. From Confucianism comes a be-
lief in the complementarity and harmony
of nature and a devotion to family, edu-
cation and discipline. From Taoism and
Buddhism, Koreans derive their charac-
teristic patience, compassion and a con-
cern for healthy living.
Generous people with an earthy sense
of humor and a love of music and
dance, the Koreans enjoy a varied cul-
tural life offering traditional and West-
ern-style concerts, drama, opera and
musicals. The Sejong Cultural Center and
the National Theater of Korea feature
symphonic concerts as well as ballet,
choral and drama troupes.
THE ULTIMATE BLESSING
Under Taoism and Confucianism chil-
dren are considered the ultimate bless-
ing, a source of fulfillment and happiness
in life, and the modern Korean has culti-
vated that tradition. The colorful Korean
Children's Center and the Children's
Grand Park offer games, amusement
rides and wildlife exhibits. Family out-
ings—picnics, hiking, kite-flying—are
much enjoyed and widely practiced.
Urbanization and rapid economic de-
velopment have, of course, had their im-
pact on the social structure and philo-
sophical outlook of the Korean people,
but the fabric of tradition is strong and
lasting. It is no longer as common for
married sons to live with their parents,
yet "filial piety" remains the basis for
family conduct. Coexisting with such an-
cient sports as ssirum and taekwondo,
Western sports such as baseball and soc-
cer have soared in popularity, adapted
and played with a notably Korean disci-
pline and intensity. And in the bustling
streets of Seoul, symbol of modern Ko-
rea and center of its promising future,
ancient architecture and traditional
clothing remind one that Korea's social
roots still go deep into its own cultural soil.

Television Search
■ A television special called "Searching for Separated Families" was first aired on
Korean TV on June 30, 1983, the 33rd anniversary of the Korean War. Cameras
showed close-ups of people searching for relatives they had lost when the penin-
sula was divided more than 30 years before or during the Korean War
(1950-1953). The program prompted many people who heard their names or
saw the faces of loved ones to rush to the TV station. Throughout the show, the
introduction of new searchers was frequently interrupted for the emotional re-
unions of those who had found relatives.
Originally planned as a two-hour program, the special was aired for four and a
half hours that day, and was shown for the next 11 days, replacing all normal pro-
gramming. When the regular schedule was finally restored, "Separated Families"
became a weekly feature. Already, many thousands of families and friends have
been reunited.


Industry Survey
A New Industrial
Revolution
Industrial juggling act: Korean planners must hold markets in heavy industry while building a base in technology
Development of
high-tech industry and
increased market competition
are keys to the current
five year plan
■ The Republic of Korea's five-year eco-
nomic development plans are striking for
their technical sophistication and com-
prehensiveness. Based on some of the
world's most up-to-date industrial input-
output tables, the plans are effective
maps of the country's overall economic
development.
The fifth Five-Year Economic Devel-
opment Plan (1982-86) is a clear depar-
ture from previous plans; along with
guidelines for stable economic growth
and an improved balance of payments,
the plan stresses industrial restructuring,
balanced development of Korea's vari-
ous regions, a reduction in government
interference in the economy and greater
emphasis on social welfare.
Development of high-technology in-
dustries, such as electronics, and the re-
vitalization of small- and medium-sized
industries are key goals, as are the insti-
tution of fair-trade practices and in-
creased competition, which the govern-
ment considers vital for strengthening
the free-market environment.
In 1980 the government ordered the
restructuring of leading heavy industrial
sectors in order to streamline operations,
eliminate overlapping investment and
bolster competitiveness. Funds are being
diverted from these sectors to help ex-
pand the production of consumer goods
for the domestic market and to support
projects that will improve Korea's hous-
ing, infrastructure, transportation and so-
cial welfare system.
After the first year of the fifth plan, the
government scaled down some of its
goals. The average annual growth target
remains 7.5 percent, but 1986 exports
and imports are now projected at $37
billion and $36 billion, respectively.
THE PUSH TOWARD TECHNOLOGY
The public and private sectors are cur-
rently engaged in research and develop-
ment in a wide spectrum of high-tech-
nology areas, including robotics, medical
equipment, chemicals and pharmaceuti-
cal products, bioengineering, advanced
electronic components and very large-
scale integrated (VLSI) technology.
In 1982 the government launched a
five-year program to boost the country's
investments in research and develop-
ment to 2 percent of gross national prod-
uct by 1986, only slightly lower than the
average in industrial countries. This
translates into $3.2 billion for research
and development in 1986, compared to
$6OO million in 1979.
STEPS TO SUCCESS
At the same time, a quarterly Technol-
ogy Promotion Conference, presided
over by President Chun and attended by
high-level representatives of the govern-
ment, research institutions, academia
and business was called to plan steps to
ensure the program's success. Fifteen
government-supported research institu-
tions have been merged into nine, grant-
ed increased funding and placed under
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Science
and Technology.
A research complex called Taedok
Science Town has been built some 150
kilometers south of Seoul. Covering 28
square kilometers, the complex includes
a university and 30 research and devel-
opment institutions.
The fields of research currently as-
signed top government priority include
semiconductors, computers, mechanical
engineering and automation, fine chem-
istry, telecommunications, nuclear pow-
er plant safety and pollution control.
Tax incentives and other public assis-
tance are provided to spur the establish-
ment of research facilities and to encour-
age people to work in this area. The
number of R&D institutes increased from
105 in 1966 to 647 in 1980.
To further encourage R&D activities in
the private sector, the Korea Technology
Development Corp. (KTDC) was found-
ed in 1981 with $lOO million contribut-
ed by the government, industry and the
World Bank. KTDC provides long-term,
low-interest loans and equity capital to
industry to help finance research activi-
ties, the early commercialization of R&D
results and the introduction of advanced
technologies from abroad.
The government is working to facili-
tate the transfer of technology from
abroad by reducing the red tape in-
volved in licensing foreign technology,
concluding technical cooperation agree-
ments with foreign governments and in-
ternational organizations, and encourag-
ing direct foreign investment that
involves advanced technology. At the
same time, the Korea Institute for Indus-
trial Economics and Technology pro-
vides Korean industry with up-to-date in-
formation on overseas technological
development.
Increasing emphasis is being placed
on training scientists, engineers and oth-
er skilled workers at universities, junior
colleges and vocational schools.
An official projection shows that Ko-
rea's technical manpower should grow
from 736,000 persons in 1981 to over
1.4 million in 1991. An increasing num-
ber of scientists and engineers are being
sent abroad for advanced training while
expatriate scientists and engineers are
being encouraged to return home.


A Review of Key Sectors
The push into high technology is al-
ready being felt throughout the industries
at the backbone of the Korean economy.
A review of these key industrial sectors
suggests the flexibility and dynamism of
the economy—the basis of the nation's
future growth.
ELECTRONICS
Already established producers of con-
sumer electronic goods, Korean elec-
tronic firms are systematically entering
more sophisticated fields and gaining ex-
pertise in both the design and produc-
tion of telecommunications, data-pro-
cessing and robotics equipment.
Through joint venture technology trans-
fers and their own research, Korean
manufacturers are now focusing on
switching and transmission systems,
wireless digital communications, laser di-
odes, personal computers, hybrid inte-
grated circuits, digital radio systems and
bipolar products. The recent indepen-
dent development of both 16K and 64K
static RAM chips by Korean firms is lead-
ing the way toward future development
and production of 256 K RAMS, elec-
tronically erasable PROMs, and ulti-
mately a piece of the world market pie
for VLSIs.
SHIPBUILDING
Korean shipbuilders now rank number
two in the world in orders, after Japan.
In 1983, while business at most of the
world's shipyards declined, Korean ship-
builders expanded their share of the
world market to about 14 percent.
Korean shipbuilders have consistently
proven their ability to manufacture some
of the largest and most sophisticated
vessels and offshore structures in the
world, including ultra-large crude oil
tankers, complex chemical tankers, se-
misubmersible drilling rigs, polyethylene
plants and barge-mounted seawater
treatment plants. Despite the ongoing
glut in the world shipbuilding market,
Korean yards are working at nearly full
capacity with a backlog of orders
stretching until at least mid-1985.
Working at capacity: Korean shipbuilders
are now second in world orders
AUTOMOBILES
Korea's dream of joining the world's
elite club of automobile exporters is fast
approaching reality. Following the strong
rebound in the domestic market in 1982,
Korean automobile makers began push-
ing ahead with plans for new plants to
manufacture low-priced subcompacts
for export under joint venture design and
marketing agreements with U.S. and Jap-
anese car producers.
Daewoo Motor Co. announced early
this year that it will build a new $4OO
million plant with its joint-venture part-
ner, General Motors. When it is com-
pleted in 1987, the plant will produce
168,000 front-wheel-drive subcom-
pacts, half for export.
Hyundai Motor Co., which last year
sold 10 percent of its equity to Mitsubi-
shi, will build a new $460 million plant
to produce 300,000 small, front-wheel-
drive "X-cars” in 1985. Designed to re-
place Hyundai's "Pony” series, the X-
cars will resemble Mitsubishi's
"Mirage”. Present plans call for export-
ing 50,000 X-cars to the United States
under Hyundai's name.
TEXTILES
Korea's textile industry, once the
country's major exporter, is being com-
pletely revamped, with funds from the
government and private sector going to-
ward replacing outdated equipment,
automating factories and carrying out re-
search and development programs.
Renewed demand in the United
States, the European Community, Japan
and Hong Kong has focused the atten-
tion of Korean textile manufacturers on
improving the quality of garments and
fabrics and enhancing fashion design. To
help textile companies make a shift to-
ward higher quality garments, the Korea
Federation of Textiles Industries adminis-
ters about $4 million a year in low-cost
loans to manufacturers who need new
equipment, and the government plans to
help companies modernize with a $150
million fund.
CONSTRUCTION
Korea is one of the five world leaders
in overseas construction. Revenue from
such projects totaled $10.4 billion in
1983 despite a slowdown due to cut-
backs in Middle East projects. Korean
companies are looking for and finding
business in Southeast Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
In addition to significantly improving
the country's balance-of-trade position,
foreign construction contracts have re-
sulted in good public relations for Korea.
The skills and diligence of Korean con-
struction workers have impressed their
hosts so favorably that Korean products
in general are now highly regarded.

Saemaul Undong—
Model for the
Third World
Korea's comprehensive rural modern-
ization plan, called Saemaul Undong,
the New Community Movement, has
been successful at home and a model for
other Third World countries. Initiated in
1970 to introduce planning and organi-
zation into the country's rural sector and
to stop migration from the farms to the
cities, the nationwide, government-
sponsored movement has been studied
by more than 15,000 foreign visitors
from 95 countries.
Consisting of a series of planning
councils from the township up to the na-
tional government, agricultural and rural
projects are planned and cooperatively
implemented. Besides providing an in-
valuable boost to the country's agricul-
tural output, improving infrastructure
and stabilizing population distribution,
the movement has had an important im-
pact on people's morale, promoting a
cooperative spirit at the grass roots level
and giving people faith in their future.
As of 1982 all of the nation's 37,000
communities have taken part in various
Saemaul projects. More than 64,000 ki-
lometers of farm roads have been con-
structed and sanitary water supply facili-
ties for 29,000 villages built. All rural
households are electrified.
In addition, incomes have been raised
by reclaiming farmland, planting fruit
trees and raising livestock. To increase
off-farm income, 809 Saemaul factories
were constructed and various labor-in-
tensive projects undertaken.


Olympics 1988
"Festival of
Global Peace"
Over 100 competition and support facilities will be in place for the 24th Olympiad
The Koreans are serious
about their role as
apolitical Olympic hosts
■ No country could be more appropriate
for the 1988 Olympic Games than Ko-
rea. Koreans truly love and excel at ath-
letic activities of all kinds. They are gra-
cious and conscientious hosts who have
a great deal to show guests —modern cit-
ies, a rich heritage and breathtaking nat-
ural scenery. Equally important in an era
when the Olympics have become entan-
gled with international politics, the Kore-
ans are serious about their role as apoliti-
cal, peace-loving hosts. Their doors are
open to the athletes of the world.
MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION
In 1981 the International Olympic
Committee voted 52 to 27 to hold the
24th Olympiad in Seoul, bringing the
Summer Games to Asia for the first time
in history. Preparations immediately be-
gan for hosting this international event
with maximum international participa-
tion, building a forum for the promotion
of world harmony with preparations that
combine optimum efficiency and mod-
erate investment. The Seoul Olympic
Organizing Committee (SLOOC) was
founded that autumn, and work began
with the close cooperation of such
groups as the Olympic Supportive Com-
mittee, set up by the National Assembly,
and the Seoul city government's Olym-
pic Planning Group.
Despite the politically motivated boy-
cotts of both the 1980 and 1984 Olym-
pics, the Koreans are going ahead with
plans to fulfill their objective of full inter-
national participation, hoping to attract
all nations regardless of existing political
differences. If all goes as planned,
10,000 athletes will represent 152 coun-
tries at the 1988 Games.
In a gesture of their intention to make
the 1988 Games "a festival of global
peace," Seoul has approached North
Korea with a plan to form a unified Kore-
an team for the Olympics and other in-
ternational sports events. Following ini-
tiatives from the south in 1981 and
1982, officials from north and south
have met twice in 1984.
KOREAN GOLD
Korea's Olympic success dates to
1936 when a Korean marathon runner,
Son Ki Jong, captured a gold medal in
the name of Japan, then occupying Ko-
rea. Not until the 1976 Games in Mon-
treal did Yang Chong-Mo, a feather-
weight wrestler, bring Korea its own gold
medal. Five other medals were won that
year in wrestling, volleyball and yudo,
and Korea finished 19th out of 100 na-
tions participating.
Preparations for the 1988 Games are
"progressing smoothly and on sched-
ule," according to the SLOOC President,
Roh Tae Woo. Of a total of 103 compe-
tition, training and support facilities
needed for the Games, only 16 competi-
tion venues and five facilities have yet to
be built. The Seoul Sports Complex, con-
structed on 2.6 million square meters of
land at the eastern edge of Seoul, is less
than half an hour from downtown Seoul
and only 45 minutes from the airport,
and can be reached by subway, bus, taxi
or private car. The Seoul Complex will
consist of a main stadium with a capaci-
ty of 100,000 spectators and other facili-
ties to accommodate 100,000 more.
TFie National Sports Complex, scheduled
to be completed by the end of 1985, will
feature a 6,000 person velodrome, three


Large projects underway or planned in
Korea itself include subway systems in
Seoul and Pusan, a second integrated
steel mill and an associated port in the
south of the country at Kwangyang Bay,
sewage treatment facilities, a domestic
telecommunications satellite, two nucle-
ar power plants, expansion of the inter-
national airports at Seoul and Pusan,
construction of a new international air-
port to serve the Seoul area, and expan-
sion of Pusan's port.
ELECTRICAL MACHINERY
Producing top-quality equipment with
a value-added rate higher than other
manufacturing sectors, the approximate-
ly 710 enterprises that make up the elec-
trical machinery and appliances industry
account for 2.4 percent of the manufac-
turing companies in Korea. One-third of
the firms produce consumer electrical
products; the rest manufacture heavy
electrical equipment, wire and cable.
Production in this area totaled $l2B mil-
lion in 1970 and $1,404 million in 1980,
a 30.6 percent annual growth rate during
the 19705.
PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
As of March 1980, the nation's petro-
chemical production facilities include 22
enterprises, 30 plants, 2 naphtha crack-
ers and 2 aromatics extraction plants,
with an aggregate total production ca-
pacity of 2,759,000 tons per annum.
This base includes two large petro-
chemical complexes at Ulsan and Yo-
chon. The Yochon Petrochemical Com-
plex, with a naphtha-cracking center and
14 downstream plants, was completed
in January 1980. The Ulsan complex
uses only naphtha as its raw material,
while Yochon can use diesel also. By
1980 the total Korean petrochemical
production of 2,671,000 tons was worth
$171,538 million.
ENERGY
Because all oil is imported, Korea is
developing alternative energy sources,
particularly nuclear power, and encour-
aging conservation.
By the end of 1983 three nuclear
power plants were in operation and
agreements for building six more had
been signed, with the government plan-
ning to have 13 in operation by 1991.
Thirty-three thermal power plants, 17
hydropower stations and one pumped-
storage plant are also in operation, with
a feasibility study for a tidal power plant
under way.
The overall power-generating capacity
of the country is scheduled to increase
to 9.8 million kw by 1991—15 percent
from oil, 41 percent from nuclear, 22
percent from coal, 10 percent from nat-
ural gas, and 12 percent from hydroelec-
tric sources.
Although significant oil reserves have
not been found at home, a Korean corn-
pany recently struck oil in Indonesia —
the first successful oil strike ever on for-
eign soil by a Korean firm.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Korea has developed a sound infra-
structure which is continually being up-
graded. In addition to an efficient net-
work of 6,100 kilometers of railways,
Korea has 60 kilometers of inner and in-
tercity subway track with 57 more due
by 1985. 53,000 kilometers of roads ser-
vice over 650,000 motor vehicles.
Korea's major international port of en-
try by air is Seoul's Kimpo Airport, with a
smaller international airport at Pusan in
the south. Other national airports are
linked to the international airports; and
all are serviced by the nation's flag carri-
er, Korean Air Lines, which has 42 pas-
senger-cargo planes that fly to more than
27 overseas destinations.
Maritime facilities continue to be ex-
panded to cope with the increasing vol-
ume of Korean trade. The major cargo
ports are at Pusan and Inchon, on the
northwest coast.
Communications systems are con-
stantly being expanded in line with
growing demand. Currently there are
over 5.5 million telephone subscribers,
rising from 2.8 million in 1980. Two sat-
ellite earth stations, an over-the-horizon
tropospheric-scatter system, and a sub-
marine cable system linked with Japan
provide international telecommunica-
tion. In addition, Korea has telegram ex-
change services with 300 domestic/in-
ternational regions, telex service with
201 worldwide regions and exchange
mail service with 162 countries. □□
Sophisticated electronics: Korean firms have
developed 16K and 64K static RAM chips
gymnasia with a combined capacity of
26,000 and a swimming and diving facil-
ity accommodating 12,000 spectators.
An equestrian site will be built in the
area of Southern Seoul Grand Park and a
regatta course established on the Han
River. A yachting marina will be con-
structed at the southern port city of Pu-
san, only an hour away from Seoul by
air. Also under construction are the
Olympic Village, a complex of 12- and
15-story buildings to house 12,000 ath-
letes, and a Press Village accommodat-
ing 9,000. Both are scheduled to be
completed by 1987.
The Koreans are building their new fa-
cilities for the Games with an eye to put-
ting them to use after the contests. The
Olympic and Press Villages will be sold
for private residence after the Games,
and the new sports arenas will help meet
the ever-growing local demand for
sports and recreation facilities.
CLEAR SKIES, BRISK WEATHER
The SLOOC has tentatively scheduled
the 1988 Summer Games from Septem-
ber 1 7 to October 2, during Korea's au-
tumn, known for clear skies and brisk
weather. It is expected that some
300,000 foreign tourists and 150,000
expatriot Koreans will visit Korea during
the Games.
To handle this huge volume of visitors,
Seoul's Kimpo Airport, currently capable
of handling almost five million passen-
gers per year, will be expanded to a ca-
pacity of nearly nine million, and four
new subway lines are under construc-
tion. Seoul presently has 52 international
hotels with 12,000 rooms within 10 kilo-
meters of the city center. Four thousand
additional rooms will be built and new
and existing facilities upgraded. All ma-
jor hotels have complete convention
centers with simultaneous translation ca-
pabilities and meeting rooms of various
sizes to handle conferences associated
with the Olympics.
Roh of the SLOOC stresses that host-
ing the Olympics in Korea “has been our
people's dream" since Korea's first par-
ticipation in London in 1948. To be sure,
1988 will give Koreans an excellent op-
portunity to share their hospitality with
the rest of the world. It will also give the
world a chance to get better acquainted
with a dynamic people with a rich cul-
tural heritage striding confidently into a
new modern era. □□
KOREA PLAZA IN LOS ANGELES
The Republic of Korea is now running
an information center in Los Angeles to
help elevate awareness of Korea as the
host nation of the Games of the 24th
Olympiad. Located on South Figuroa
Street, two kilometers from the Colise-
um, the center has four display halls and
a multiscreen cinema that will feature
art, industry and tourism, and a small
theater for the presentation of traditional
Korean music and dance.


Visiting Korea
A Land of Legendary Beauty
Breathtaking beauty, heritage of kings:
Korean visitors discover rugged mountains,
more islands than Greece and unrivaled
treasures from ancient culture.
■ Legend has it that the Korean land is so
heavenly that, long ago, envious deities
sought to become human so as to live
there. Korea, the Eastern Land of Courte-
sy, has a long tradition of hospitality to
its human visitors—and today, with the
Asian Games and the Summer Olympics
promising to introduce thousands of
travelers to the country, the Koreans are
expanding efforts to welcome and enter-
tain their foreign guests.
Korea's tourist industry is already
growing rapidly. With its mountains,
beaches and islands, the country has
much to offer the tourist seeking natural
beauty and outdoor recreation. With a
5,000-year cultural heritage, this north-
east Asian peninsula also possesses a
wealth of ancient palaces, temples and
shrines, and museums filled with centu-
ries of stunning artistic expression. In
1962 a little more than 15,000 tourists
visited Korea; last year this number had
grown to 1.2 million. The government,
under the direction of the Korean Na-
tional Tourist Corp., is investing heavily
to upgrade facilities, develop and ex-
pand international hotels, conference
centers, transportation, national parks,
museums, golf courses and casinos.
VIBRANT TRADITION
Seoul, the capital city, is an important
year-round attraction and business
center. A fully modern metropolis with a
population of well over nine million, it
offers many deluxe hotels, excellent
shops, bars and restaurants. Its museums
are the repositories of many national
treasures. Visitors may be surprised to
encounter a lively and vibrant artistic
tradition still little known abroad.
Only a 30-minute car ride separates
Seoul from an astonishing replica of a
traditional Korean village. Dance troupes,
tightrope walkers, kite-flying contests,
weddings and funeral processions min-
gle in the village square as craftsmen
work in their traditional houses. The visi-
tor can linger in a humble farmer's home
and compare it with the wealth of a
Yangban's (aristocrat's) house. In one
area the village has gathered all the char-
acteristics, beauty and color of the vari-
ous provinces of the country.
Pusan, the second largest city and
principal port, lies on the southern tip of
the peninsula, offering magnificent
beaches for swimming. Within an hour's
drive of Pusan are two of the most beau-
tifully situated and interesting Buddhist
temples in the country, Pomosa and
Tongdosa.
Perhaps the richest repository of an-
cient history and arts on the peninsula is
the provincial city of Kyongju, which
once was the splendid capital of the Silla
Kingdom (57 B.C. to 935 A.D.). Kyongju
is literally a museum without walls, filled
with the temples, royal tombs and mon-
uments of ancient Silla, the earliest stone
observatory in Asia, pagodas and the
crumbling remains of palaces and for-
tresses. The two supreme treasures of
Kyongju are the Pulguksa Temple, one of
the most beautiful in Korea, and the
nearby stone grotto, called Sokkuram,
known throughout the world for the
stone statues and carved friezes, consid-
ered pinnacles of Buddhist art.
Only six kilometers away, on the east-
ern outskirts of Kyongju, the government
has developed the Pomun Lake Resort,
one of Asia's first-class international
tourist resorts, offering business facilities
for conventioneers as well.
The northern stretch of Korea's east
coast, which can conveniently be
reached by plane, train or express bus
from Seoul, is rugged and mountainous,
with a great deal of breathtaking scenery
that is considered some of the most
spectacular in Asia. The area is a year-
round resort with skiing and other winter
sports facilities, mountain climbing in the
fall and swimming in summer.
UNTOUCHED VALLEYS
The principal inland resort area, Mt.
Sorak National Park, offers several mod-
ern lodges and hotels. Inner Sorak has
stayed virtually untouched by modern
civilization. There, the Paektamsa Tem-
ple offers its beauty to adventuresome
hikers exploring the valleys.
Focus of much government attention
is Korea's only island province, Cheju,
just an hour by jet from Seoul. The land-
scape and vegetation take the traveler to
a different world. Only 220 miles off the
southern port of Pusan, the island enjoys
a semi-tropical climate entirely different
from that of the mainland. The beauties
of the island range from lofty Mt. Halla-
san, the highest mountain in South Ko-
rea, with a huge crater of an extinct vol-
cano, to the famed woman divers who
make their living garnering seafood and
other marine products from the depths
of the ocean, even in winter.
Increasingly popular with foreign tour-
ists and conventions, Cheju—and its
beauty—are legendary. But the beauty,
development and modernization of Ko-
rea are not legends—they are Korea to-
day. □□


GYMNASTICS
Benefiting
By Default
Some coaches say that Dmitry Belozer-
chev is the greatest gymnast ever. Unfor-
tunately, that claim won’t be tested this
year. Belozerchev is a Russian. His ab-
sence, and the absence of other superb
gymnasts from the communist bloc, gives
the United States its best chance in dec-
ades to win medals in these spectacular
leaping, spinning, twisting and flipping
events. The last time the Americans were
the stars was another Los Angeles Olym-
pics, in 1932; they won five golds and a
team silver. Those were the days when the
competition included Marine Corps-type
events like rope climbing and club swing-
ing. As the sport has been refined, the U.S.
team has declined: since 1940 the Ameri-
cans have won only two bronzes. But this
time as many as 15 medals, four of them
gold, seem within reach of U.S. athletes.
One star of the American team is Mary
Lou Retton, 16, who at 4 feet 10 is a little
bundle of energy and excitement. The
muscular West Virginian attacks the
vaulting horse, uneven bars and floor exer-
cise mat with the zest of a Samurai tum-
bler. Her private coach, ex-Romanian
Bela Karolyi, hopes for four medals for his
pupil. She is a favorite in the vault, and if
she makes no major blunders on the bal-
ance beam, admittedly her weakest event,
she should challenge her Romanian look-
alike, Ecaterina Szabo, for the all-round
title. The longer-limbed Julianne McNa-
mara is a good bet on the uneven parallel
bars, and the U.S. team should garner at
least a bronze.
On the men’s side, the Chinese may
have a slight edge over the Americans. Li
Ning “is the athlete to beat,” says UCLA
gymnastics coach Art Shurlock. Even
without Li, the Chinese outperformed the
Americans in a recent meet in Hawaii. The
Japanese, meanwhile, are bringing a team
of technically proficient but not very
flashy gymnasts to the Games. The ever-
precise Japanese gymnasts used to win lots
Vidmar the technician; Odd-coupled with Gaylord the gambler in a would-be medalfest
of medals. But the emphasis in this sport
has shifted in recent years to the big
tricks —and the Japanese teams seem to
have faded into the background. Japan’s
best hope in Los Angeles is that its com-
petitors will take a few risks too many, and
wind up slipping or tripping.
As for spectacular gymnasts, America’s
Mitch Gaylord, already famous for the
high-bar Gaylord flip, is now threatening
to perform what he calls the Gaylord II —
a seemingly impossible flyaway with a
half-twist. After early success, he missed it
at the Olympic trials, but he refuses to play
safe at the Olympics. “It’s ajackpot type of
move,” says Chuck Gaylord, his brother
and coach. “If he catches it, he’ll own the
gold medal. If he doesn’t, it’ll blow him
out of competition.” Teammate Peter
Vidmar, meanwhile, is a technician who
could win any number of medals if the
hotshots miss any part of their routines.
With the Russians gone, the U.S. men
are expected to take at least the team
bronze. But Eastern-bloc absentees and
home-court advantages bring their own
set of pressures. “Pauley Pavilion is an
environment I’m very familar with,” grins
Vidmar, “but it doesn’t leave me very
much room for excuses.”

Szabo: Romania’s Chunky Favorite for Gold
Roxv RIFKEN
The darlings of past Olympics were gym-
nasts like Cathy Rigby and Nadia Comane-
ci—slender, long-limbed girls who looked
like teen-age models. The image is different
this year: the odds-on favorite, Ecaterina
Szabo of Romania, is chunky and muscular.
Her principal rival, America’s Mary Lou Ret-
ton, is just as sturdy. “Never have there
been two gymnasts so similar,” says Bela
Karolyi. He should know. Karolyi trained
both Comaneci and Szabo. He now
coaches Retton.


TRACK.FIELD
A Fast lane for the U.S.
Even with the boycott the competition will be hot.
The decision to boycott the Olympics
may have caused Soviet leader Konstantin
Chernenko some regrets —but probably
not in the case of track and field events. By
skipping the Los Angeles Games, the So-
viets not only gained revenge against the
United States for sticking them with all
those souvenir teddy bears back in 1980;
they also avoided an almost certain drub-
bing in what is arguably the most visible
panoply of events. The United States is not
going to win as many track and field med-
als as the Greeks did in the original
Games, yet to casual observers—watch-
ing from the cheap seats in the Coliseum or
via the communal TV set in Peking—it
may appear that way. Thanks to a system
that now allows millionaire athletes to
retain amateur status, plus some plain
dumb luck (such as the withdrawal of
Ireland’s Eamonn Coghlan from the
5,000-meter race due to an injury), the
United States has assembled a team that
seems capable of stunning success.
That’s not to say that what happens on
the Coliseum’s track will be devoid of
drama. Even Carl Lewis will generate
suspense as he goes one-on-one against
the ghost of Jesse Owens. By now, any-
thing less than a quadruple play in the
long jump, 100- and 200-meter dashes
and the 4xloo-meter relay would be a
disappointment. A similar pressure will
come to bear on Carl’s 20-year-old sister,
Carol, who hopes to launch a career in
broadcasting by winning the women’s
long jump. Her personal journey is im-
peded, however, by two world-class Ro-
manians, including Anisoara Cusmir, 22,
the world-record holder at 24 feet 4 Vi
inches —1 foot 6 inches ahead of Carol’s
personal best.
Courageous comebacks are still a large
part of what these Games are all about.
For 100-meter specialist Evelyn Ashford,
victory depends on the ability to run
despite fear of sudden, searing pain. A
hamstring injury caused Ashford, 27, to
crumple at the 1983 Helsinki champion-
ships, and kept her from qualifying for the
200-meter sprint in last month’s Olympic
trials. It could be a jinxed race: Chandra
Cheeseborough dropped out of the same
event because of tendinitis and bronchitis;
she will now concentrate on the 400, an
event in which the United States has been
traditionally weak. Their place in the
200 —“the true test of a sprinter,” says
Ashford —will now be taken by Valerie
Brisco-Hooks, who is also competing in
the 400 and possibly the 4x400 relay. In
the absence of the powerful East Ger-
mans, the American sprinters are likely to
get their stiffest competition from veteran
Jamaican speedster Merlene Ottey.
In the middle distances, Ruth Wysocki
will be out to prove that she is no one-
race wonder. “What have I done?” the
27-year-old Wysocki asked herself as she
crossed the finish line of the 1,500-meter
race in the Olympic trials. The answer:
she had handed Mary Decker her first
defeat on any track since 1980. Wysocki,
who once quit running for two years
because of injury and a divorce (and
whose husband, long-distance runner
Tom, was once Decker’s boyfriend), im-
proved her personal top time in that
“metric mile” by an astonishing 12 sec-
onds, to 4:00.18. Still, Romania’s Mari-
cica Puica seems to be hitting her stride
in the middle distances —and could win a
pair of medals of her own.
Decker’s defeat was a factor in her deci-
sion to concentrate solely on a clash with
South African-turned-Briton Zola Budd
at 3,000 meters. Wysocki will double by
entering the 800. There she is part of a
wide-open field that includes West Ger-
many’s Margrit Klinger, 24, and Kim
Gallagher, 20, an American sweetheart
whose gleaming braces only enhance her
winner’s smile.
One area where the U.S. women are
not likely to dominate is in the strength
events. There are no serious American

challengers to the likes of Finnish javelin
hurler Tiina Lillak and discus thrower
Ria Stalman of Holland. It is said that
the United States lags behind the Europe-
ans in this area because American wom-
en would rather be svelte than successful.
Perhaps so, but the U.S. men seem will-
ing to get down and get beefy—at least
judging by 6-foot-4, 255-pounh Dave
Laut, a tower of gristle who could lead an
American medal sweep in the shot put.
Nor would anyone be too surprised if the
American surge continued with Tom Pe-
tranoff taking the javelin honors and pole
vaulter Mike Tully outdueling Beatle-
banged Frenchman Thierry Vigneron to
claim the gold. At this point, though,
two-time bronze medalist Dwight Stones,
30, seems to be a shade behind 21-year-
old Zhu Jianhua of the People’s Republic
of China in the high jump.
Then there’s the regal Edwin Moses, 28.
There will be no nail-biting as the 400-
meter-hurdles champ attempts to extend
his string of 102 consecutive victories in
Los Angeles. Yet all but the densest spec-
tators will experience the esthetic pleasure
of watching the man who won the 1976
Montreal Games medal demonstrate ex-
actly how to fly over a three-foot fence.
Moses last lost in 1977—t0 West Ger-
many’s Harald Schmid, 26, who will also
be in L.A. but with little hope for more
than a passing glance at the champion’s
sneaker soles. His gracefulness will pro-
vide a contrast to the hard-charging style
of the scowling 110-meter hurdler Greg
Foster, 25, who looks as if he’s pursuing a
purse-snatcher.
But in all likelihood, the most fun will
come from watching some new stars
emerge. The idea of 20-year-old Earl
Jones, a sophomore at Eastern Michigan,
beating Britain’s legendary Sebastian Coe
at 800 meters is delicious without being
preposterous. (Though he holds the world
record of 1:41.73, Coe has never won the
800 at a major international meet.) The
same is true of 400-meter man Antonio
McKay, 20—whose unabashed vows that
“the gold is mine” cut through the cyni-
cism of these times of trust-fund shelters
for “amateurs.” (It will take more than
rhetoric, however, for McKay to beat pow-
erful Bert Cameron of Jamaica.) Finally,
what could be more heart-warming than
the brother-sister act of A 1 and Jackie
Joyner of East St. Louis, 111.? He is the 24-
year-old triple jumper who will be taking
on Britain’s Keith Conner and his U.S.
teammate Willie Banks. She is the 22-year-
old heptathlete who made the team by
scoring an American-record 6,520 points.
Now that they’ve bucked the odds and the
experts by making the team, will anyone
dare remind the Joyners that they are only
the Games’ second most famous siblings?

MARTIN KASINDORF
Intensity in the Water
The aqua teams could be America’s top medalists.
Black-line fever: daily, through six
hours and 16,000 yards’ worth of laps, it
chases the swimmer as fast as the swimmer
chases the clock. Life is not simple in a
murmured world of air bubbles and dead,
black lines at the bottom of the pool. “It’s
95 percent mental,” says American free-
styler Rowdy Gaines, 25, who psyched
himself up for the Olympic tryouts by
wearing only black. In competition, every
swimmer has his own way to beat the fever.
Says Gaines, “I have to get angry. Then I
just swim like hell.”
Even that usually isn’t enough. Only 43
of the 650 American athletes who swam
like hell last month in Indianapolis made
is pretty good,” he says.“I’m a happy
camper now.”
Other happy campers should be dis-
tance swimmer George DiCarlo, favored
in the 400 and 1,500 freestyle, and Jeff
Kostoff, who could possibly be clanking a
medal after the 400 individual medley
(IM). Pablo Morales, the 19-year-old son
of Cuban immigrants, holds the world re-
cord in the 100-meter butterfly and will
also challenge in the 200 fly and 200 IM.
Mike Heath, one of the United States’ best
sprinters, will duel for gold in the 100
freestyle with teammate Rowdy Gaines
and in the 200 with West German super-
swimmer Michael Gross. If all goes as

the Olympic squad. There’s a whiff of “The
Natural” about this contingent—one-
third of its members were on the stillborn
1980 Olympic team, and most of these
past-prime athletes know that this is their
last shot at the gold. These veterans will
provide the leadership; but Olympic swim-
ming coach Don Gambril is counting on
his newcomers to donate much of the juice.
Rick Carey, the 21-year-old world-rec-
ord holder in the 100- and 200-meter back-
stroke, seems determined to break both his
marks at the Olympics and will also power
the record-bound medley relay team. One
of the most exciting races will be the finals
of the 100-meter breast stroke, where Steve
(Lunk) Lundquist will try to take back his
world record from fellow American John
Moffet. Moffet nabbed the record at the
Indianapolis trials, one finger tip ahead of
the charging Lundquist. Lunk, carrying
the reputation of squad party animal, says
he was not bothered by the loss. After he
injured his shoulder last year in a water-
skiing accident, he finished 23rd in his
event in a March meet. “From 23rd to 2nd
expected, the U.S. men should sweep all
three relays and win at least half of the 12
individual events.
Most of the medal winners in the men’s
divisions won’t have to ask themselves the
ultimate 1984 Olympic what-if question.
The Soviet-bloc absence affects mainly the
distance races, where Russian Vladimir
Salnikov was expected to take several
freestyles. Women victors, however, will
have to rationalize the no-show of the best
team in the world, the East Germans.
Tracy Caulkins, winner of 48 national
titlessince 1978, will shine as the star of the
women’s squad. She will be competing in
three events —the 100 breast stroke and
200 and 400 IM—and should win at least
two gold medals. Two other favored U.S.
swimmers, temporarily demoralized by
the aborting of the 1980 Olympics, have
regained their form and attitude. Nancy
Hogshead, 22, quit swimming in 1981 be-
cause “I was burned out. I’d been world
ranked since I was 13 and couldn’t take it
anymore.” Now, she is likely to take home
a medal in the 100 freestyle, 200 IM and

200 butterfly. Cynthia Woodhead, 20, was
favored to win the 100 and 200 freestyles in
Moscow. After 1980 she wandered among
various swim clubs before steeling up for
the Indianapolis trials. She should win the
200 freestyle. Tiffany Cohen, 18, is expect-
ed to triumph in the 400 and 800 freestyles,
while the lovable-pixie quota will be filled
by 15-year-old Michelle (Cha-Cha) Rich-
ardson. Altogether, the United States can
anticipate a dozen and a half gold or silver
medals for the 12 women’s events.
Up above the pool, meanwhile, Greg
Louganis will give an exhibition in per-
fection of craft. Still improving at 24, the
three-time NCAA diving champ is expect-
ed to become the first male diver to win two
gold medals in the same Olympics, in both
platform and springboard events. Lou-
ganis, who won a silver medal at the 1976
Olympics, hones his graceful, rhythmic
diving style with classical-ballet lessons.
He has so thoroughly beaten his sport that
at last year’s Pan American Games he
could have skipped the last of his 11 plat-
form dives and still won by 9 points. On
both the springboard and platform, Lou-
ganis’s most daring plunge will be a reverse
somersault tuck. The dive carries a
difficulty factor of 3.5 (the highest possi-
ble) and a beauty quotient of aaaah.
The women divers, however, will be
more sorely tested. In 1980, the Chinese
decided they would have the best divers in
the world. Chinese diving coaches dissect-
ed high-speed films of American competi-
tors and live dives at international meets.
The crash course worked, and the Chinese
are now threatening this island of tradi-
tional American supremacy. Curiously,
Lu Wei, who was expected to challenge for
the women’s platform gold, won’t be com-
ing to Los Angeles. American swimming
officials are still baffled by the absence of
the 5-foot-tall, 88-pound 19-year-old who
had a lock on most lovable pixie, commu-
nist division. America will counter with
springboard diver Kelly McCormick,
whose mother won four Olympic diving
gold medals in the ’sos, and Wendy Wy-
land, the world platform champion. Wy-
land and McCormick will be challenged by
China’s often picture-perfect Chen Xiao-
xia and Li Yihua, respectively.
For many members of the water squads,
however, the battle has already been won,
simply because the Games are going on.
Behind all the rhetoric about the joy of
competition stand swimmers who had
known black-line fever since childhood,
then made the 1980 Olympic team —then
had to decide whether or not a fleeting
moment on top was worth four more bor-
ing years of watery workouts. The art of
this team is symbolized by Louganis and
Carey, and the spirit by 21-year-old free-
styler Kim Line- han. “I was mentally and
emotionally drained,” she says, explaining
why she retired from swimming in the
spring of 1983. “But then last summer I
watched the Pan Am Games on TV. I just
sat there and bawled. I guess I didn’t have
swimming out of my system yet. I knew I
could be there at the Olympics.” Flouting
the fever, she jumped back in the water.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Compact Discs for Cars: Sounding Better
Only a year ago the music industry thrilled audiophiles with
the introduction of compact-disc (CD) players and recordings.
Critics and listeners raved over the CD’s clean and accurate
sound, which carries none of the surface noise or hiss of records
and tapes. Public acceptance of the new technology was
slowed, however, by the high prices of both players and discs,
and by the fact that the bulky systems were limited to home use.
The daunting cost of the CD systems fell quickly, but owners
have been eager to get more use out of their discs. Recently, real
strides have been announced in the effort to improve the
technology’s marketability by reducing the size of players to fit
into an automobile dashboard.
Three Japanese companies that have announced CD players
for the car had to overcome a series of engineering challenges.
The first was to miniaturize the heart of any CD system, the
laser-optic device that reads the digital code off the metallic
discs themselves. The in-dash units also had to be designed to
withstand the vibrations and jolts that they would inevitably
receive, as well as extremes of temperature and humidity.
Finally, the controls had to be simple enough to allow easy
operation by a driver concentrating on the road.
Sony Corp., one of the leaders in the development of CD
technology, seems to have maintained its edge with its im-
pressive model CDX-R7. The unit fits neatly into a standard
car-radio dashboard compart-
ment and boasts a digital-display
AM/FM stereo radio with six
programmable station-selector
buttons. The CD player is loaded
with convenient features, includ-
ing forward and reverse scanning
at 10 times the normal playing
speed, repeat function, bass and
treble controls and a sensor that
Sony’s in-dash CD player: Challenging the engineers
allows a listener to skip almost instantly to the next song. When
the CD is inserted in its horizontal slot, the machine automati-
cally draws the disc into place, and the digital display then starts
showing the elapsed playing time of the recording. A model
CDX-5 has most of the same features, but no radio. Sony says
the performance specifications of both units are comparable to
its home models. The company expects to deliver the first units
this autumn, at a price between $600 and $ 1,000.
Pioneer Electronics is planning a car CD system that sepa-
rates the player into two units. The so-called operating module
fits into the dash and contains the controls and a slot for
entering discs. But the power supply and digital processor are
housed in a second, slightly smaller box, which the company
says can be placed beneath the driver’s seat or under the dash.
The Pioneer CDX-1 has no radio, but otherwise offers most of
the features the Sony units have. No price has yet been released,
but Pioneer spokesmen say the system will be on the market in
early 1985.
Finally, Fujitsu Ten Ltd. has developed a bulky single-
component player in conjunction with Toyota Motor Corp.
The unit is too large to fit into the radio opening on most
dashboards, but Toyota apparently will offer it as an option
on its cars. The system has a built-in AM/FM radio and
many of the features of the Sony and Pioneer players. Instead
of sliding the CD into a slot,
however, each disc must be
loaded into a sliding tray similar
to that in many home models —
a seemingly cumbersome proce-
dure that could be especially
inconvenient while driving. Fu-
jitsu and Toyota have not yet
given a price for the unit or an
introductory date.
Fingerprints Don’t Lie
The human fingerprint has long been
known to be the ultimate identifier; no
two are alike. And unlike passwords or
identification cards, fingerprints can’t be
stolen, forgotten or even copied. For
these reasons, banks and companies that
store sensitive data in computers have
long wondered if fingerprints could be
integrated into their security measures to
control access to their vaults, automatic
tellers and terminals. California inventor
Randy Fowler has found that they can.
His electronic device identifies people by
their fingerprints—a system that may be
as close to foolproof as possible.
The Personal Verification Terminal
System, manufactured by Identix, Inc.,
of Palo Alto, consists of one or more
terminals and a central-computer mem-
ory bank that can store thousands of
fingerprint images. People who are to be
allowed entry to a building or room, or
electronic access to a computer, are first
“enrolled” in the system by inserting a
fingertip into one of the terminals. An
optical scanner then takes a high-resolu-
tion image of the print, which is translat-
ed into a mathematical code that is re-
tained in the central memory. Users are
also given their own four- or five-digit
Identix terminal: Getting to know you
personal-identification number. Later,
when they want to enter a facility or use a
computer, they input the number on the
terminal’s keypad and place the same
finger in the machine. If the print match-
es the one on file, access is given by
unlocking a door or allowing the user to
log on to a computer. One Identix termi-
nal can service an entire building or com-
puter system, but other terminals might
be placed on each floor or in each depart-
ment for greater convenience.
The system was tested recently at a
California bank, which has since ordered
it for its cash vault. Identix engineers are
also at work on a self-contained terminal
that could store the images without be-
ing tied to a central memory facility.
Each 14-pound terminal costs about
$4,500 and a central processor between
$4,000 and $5,000, depending on how
many fingerprints the purchaser wants
to be able to store.

Lakes, rivers and waterways are far from being immortal.
Nature cannot always survive the presence of man. And the
uncontrolled or accidental depositing of refuse is
threatening our lakes and rivers.
Surface water is more precious to Australia than most
countries. Evaporation is high, lakes are generally shallow
and rivers run inconsistently.
Limno gives “the kiss of life’’ to acidified lakes by
drawing into the system polluted or "dead” water, which has
low oxygen content.
The water is then oxygenated by intense contact with
compressed air and forced out. Treatment by Limno can
take six months minimum, to as much as five years for
severe cases.

David Lange survives
his week of crisis
New Zealand’s new Prime Minister was faced with major economic problems
after his election win. But, as lAN TEMPLETON reports, Lange survived the crisis
and launched a new political era.
THE LABOR PARTY barely had time
to uncork the champagne to celebrate
its election victory in New Zealand be-
fore it was thrust into the most severe
currency and constitutional crisis the
country had faced in the modern era.
The new Prime Minister, David
Lange, who had yet to be sworn in,
found himself without effective power
to deal with the outflow of foreign ex-
change reserves which had the normally
staid officials of the Reserve Bank on
the point of nervous collapse. Yet
Lange, new to the job and refreshingly
candid about his limited economic
skills, survived the crisis and by the end
of his first tumultuous week had won the
applause of most of his countrymen and
certainly of orthodox economists.
By the end of that week, too, public
anger with outgoing prime minister Sir
Robert Muldoon had reached the point
where his National Party in many re-
gions was threatening rebellion. Even
Muldoon recognised the inevitable and
worked out a deal with his colleagues
who were convinced he had to go but
could not decide on his successor that
leaves him in office until next January.
Even that may not satisfy the National
Party outside the parliamentary arena.
It meets on July 27 for its annual con-
ference and delegates there may call for
Muldoon’s head.
But some ministers in the outgoing
cabinet believe that he should stay long
enough to absorb the Labor govern-
ment’s onslaught on what it calls his
economic mismanagement.
Lange has accused Muldoon of “ly-
ing,” of an “appalling failure of man-
agement” and of being “reckless and ir-
responsible.”
The Reserve Bank set out the facts:
over the four weeks of the election cam-
paign, $1.4 billion flowed out of the
country. Besides these spot sales the
bank was carrying forward exchange
contracts of $1.2 billion, of which just
over $1 billion matured before the end
of August. Between them, the Reserve
Prime Minister David Lange: the plaudits of his countrymen ring in his ears
Bank and the Treasury borrowed over-
seas a total of $1.7 billion from June 19
to July 17.
Lange, who had campaigned against
the Muldoon government for its heavy
borrowing and accumulation of over-
seas debt, was appropriately horrified at
his inheritance. Both Reserve Bank and
Treasury had urged Muldoon to close
the foreign exchange market on July 13,
the day before the election. He had
refused to do this but trading had to be
suspended the following Monday.
At that point the country discovered
that Muldoon and Lange were studying
the economy from different ends of the
telescope. Muldoon was adamant that
the dollar was not over-valued and there
should be no devaluation. But Labor
believed that a structural adjustment in
the exchange rate would be essential,
though the party was careful to stress
during the election campaign that de-
valuation was not part of its economic
policy.
If Labor had hoped for a breathing
space after the election, before moving
to implement its plans for a broad econ-
omic package after a Hawke-type
summit those hopes were dashed by
the bizarre circumstances that devel-
oped in Wellington on July 16.
While Reserve Bank and Treasury
officials were telling Lange that devalu-
ation was imperative, Muldoon was
urging his opponent to resist devalu-
ation and join with him in a declaration
that it was not necessary. Muldoon said
that would kill speculation and force
the funds to return from abroad. He ar-
gued that devaluation would unwind all
the benefits of the wage-price freeze and
thrust New Zealand back into double-
digit inflation.
Muldoon’s apparent refusal to hand
over gracefully to Lange caused an out-
cry.'Muldoon’s determination to resist
devaluation flew in the face of all con-
stitutional conventions.
The difficulty is that New Zealand
does not have a written constitution and
its post-election procedures trace back
to the age when it took days to collect
all the votes in remote electorates.
The transition from one government
to another is based on the return of the


“Where’s that bloody new boy?!”
electoral writs, which usually takes
about 10 days. Until that is accom-
plished, there are no members of parlia-
ment and the country is governed by the
Executive Council ministers of the
crown plus the Governor-General.
If outgoing ministers refuse to carry
out the policy of the incoming govern-
ment, there is little a Prime Minister-
elect can do.
But July 17 brought a rapid U-turn
by Muldoon. After a special cabinet
meeting, he said he would implement
the instructions of the incoming Labor
government. And so Lange, operating
by remote control, got his hands on the
levers of power.
First, Lange had to summon all his
newly-elected MPs to Wellington for an
early caucus so that they could elect the
20 members of the Labor cabinet. That
accomplished, Lange called his first
cabinet meeting even though port-
folios had not been allocated and
pushed through the package con-
structed by his chief economic advisers,
Roger Douglas and David Caygill.
Within 24 hours of the 20 percent de-
valuation, more than $1 billion in for-
eign exchange flowed back into the New
Zealand banking system from abroad.
Lange also pushed through a three-
month freeze on prices and lifted the
array of controls on interest rates. That
was perhaps the most surprising aspect
of his package. But it was regarded as
necessary because low interest rates had
driven money out of the country in
search of a higher return.
Lange also has pledged that other as-
sistance measures to industry such as
export incentives are to be reviewed.
If the new Prime Minister emerged
from his first major test with the plaud-
its of his countrymen ringing in his ears,
there is a clear recognition that much
remains to be done.
The devaluation means a substantial
cut in real wages and, though the Labor
government plans relief in the budget
for low income families, it is difficult to
imagine that the trade unions will ac-
cept with equanimity the continuing
freeze on wages.
The devaluation has put hundreds of
millions of dollars into the hands of
those who gambled that the exchange
rate would have to be changed.
The net fiscal cost of the devaluation
is put at $350 million which will have to
be met by the taxpayer or, more likely,
financed by increasing the internal defi-
cit already running at $2.5 billion.
The medium-term legacy will be a
higher rate of inflation back up to 13
percent by March next year, according
to one authoritative economic forecast-
ing agency, compared with the 7 percent
for which Muldoon was aiming.
If Lange negotiated his first week
safely, he had plenty of reminders of the
hard decisions that lie ahead. The
ANZUS council meeting brought into
focus his party’s pledge to ban nuclear
warships and it is doubtful if he can fol-
low the Hawke government’s plan on
that issue, given the weight of opinion
inside the Labor movement. But at least
he has a breathing space.
He has shown already a capacity for
decisive action and, in avoiding politi-
cal traps, a nimbleness that might carry
him further and faster than his oppo-
nents believed possible.
There is a new mood not only in
Wellington but also in the country. The
Muldoon era clearly has ended: Lange’s
has begun. □
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
Two-way strain
imposed by
border-crossers
By STUART INDER
THE OFFICE of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees last
week put out a new estimate of the num-
ber of people who have crossed into
Papua New Guinea from Irian Jaya to
seek sanctuary 10,000.
And the office has stepped up its
work to help the PNG government deal
with them. Dealing with them that is,
looking after their welfare while de-
ciding what to do about them has be-
come a major problem separate from
the diplomatic initiatives between Indo-
nesia and PNG on the reasons for their
presence.
Papua New Guinea says that the
people, mostly subsistence farmers,
have crossed the border because of an
Indonesian military crackdown on
guerillas that they don’t want to be
caught up in or possibly because of
pressures from the Indonesian program
moving migrants from other provinces
into Irian Jaya.
Indonesia says that, whatever they
are, the border-crossers are not refugees
and it wants them back. PNG has
agreed that they should return except
for those who might have a well-
founded fear of persecution because of
involvement in dissident activities.
Deciding who should and who
should not go back is the stage which
PNG has reached.
The task is not simply humanitarian
it is an obligation imposed on mem-
ber countries by the United Nations’
1967 protocol and the 1951 convention
on refugees status. “Neither PNG nor
Indonesia is a signatory to the conven-
tion but they are UN members who an-
nually support the continuation of
UNHCR (the high commissioner’s
office) at the UN and that endorsement
gives us a mandate to interest ourselves
in the PNG border-crossers,” said
UNHCR official Michael Alford, in
Canberra. Alford is careful to refer to
“border-crossers”, rather than refugees.
He says that most of the 10,000 prob-
ably would want to go back.
However, under both the convention
and the statute, it is incumbent on a
country to give asylum to a fleeing per-
son who if returned would have a
well-founded fear of being persecuted
for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
membership of a particular social group
or political opinion.
Any return must be voluntary, with


independent monitoring on both sides
of the border, and the person concerned
may ask for UN help to become re-es-
tablished.
The high commissioner’s office has
laid down guidelines on how to deal
with border-crossers.
The first move is to determine
through interviews if people are genuine
refugees fearful of persecution and to
encourage them to go back voluntarily
if they would be safe. A refugee can be
offered integration into the local popu-
lation or, as a last resort, resettled in a
third country.
“The third category is always well
down the line,” said Alford. “The first
category is preferable but people don’t
move back in a hurry and you can’t
move them back in a hurry. Patience is
needed.
“PNG is at that first stage of identify-
ing the border-crossers. Officials there
are doing the determination.
“There has been no request for Aus-
tralia or anyone else to take any of those
people. That would be too far down the
line.” □
INDOOHTNK
Missing are
the link in
Reagan policy
By FEDOR MEDIANSKY
TO DRAMATISE the case of some
2500 United States personnel still miss-
ing as a result of the Vietnam war, Presi-
dent Reagan declared Friday, July 20 to
be National POW/MIA Recognition
Day. He proclaimed that the case of the
MIAs (missing in action) “will remain a
matter of highest national priority.” The
POW/MIA flag flew “as a symbol of
our unswerving commitment to achieve
the fullest possible accounting” for
those still missing in Indochina.
The US has never found Indochina
easy to deal with. Nor, for that matter,
has any other country. France and
China can show little for their involve-
ment and the Soviet Union is pouring
more resources into the region than it
can hope to recover. Indochina’s im-
mediate neighbors, the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
states also find the going rough. And
Australia’s Foreign Minister, Bill Hay-
den, can hardly point to substantial re-
wards for efforts at peace-making there.
US policy toward Vietnam is more
complex and more fluid than generally
recognised. Washington plays a key role
in a multinational policy of keeping
President Reagan receives the flag from the coffin of Vietnam’s “unknown soldier”
Hanoi isolated while its Vietnamese
military presence remains the critical
factor in the Kampuchean equation.
But the Reagan administration still pur-
sues occasional direct high-level con-
tacts aimed at resolving the MIA issue.
Reagan told the League of Families
of American Prisoners and Missing in
Southeast Asia last January that the
“fullest possible accounting” of those
still missing is now for “the government
bureaucracy ... a highest national pri-
ority.” Accordingly, an impressive in-
ter-agency network has been established
with direct participation by the Defence
Intelligence Agency (DIA) and other
arms of the Pentagon to account for
missing Americans and possible prison-
ers of war in Vietnam, Kampuchea and
Laos.
A DIA report says that Hanoi “had
in its possession the remains of more
than 400 US personnel who were lost as
a result of hostilities in Indochina.” The
DIA discussed less openly other sight-
ings of Americans alive in Vietnam who
remain voluntarily or otherwise.
Many informed US officials do not
rule out the possibility that missing Am-
ericans are still alive in Indochina.
The administration has said repeat-
edly that it believes that Hanoi is hold-
ing back on the MIAs and possibly on
POWs as well.
The administration has sent two
high-level delegations to Hanoi for
talks. The first went in February 1982
and the second a year later.
But such efforts have met with
frustratingly little success. Very few re-
mains have been turned over, though
Hanoi has agreed to hold technical-
level meetings more frequently. The
most recently scheduled of these was
cancelled at the last minute by the Viet-
namese last April, for “technical”
reasons. US officials, however, point out
that Vietnam had no such problems
with an Australian MIA team which
Hayden said “received the fullest co-op-
eration of the Vietnamese authorities.”
Hanoi’s signal is clear: Co-operation
on this issue will not be kept entirely
apart from other considerations.
The US and Vietnam have agreed
officially that the MIA issue is humani-
tarian and, so, should not be linked to
other political matters. In practice,
though, each side has tended to link it to
non-humanitarian concerns in the hope
of gaining advantage.
Thus, the US tries to encourage
movement by hinting that progress
would influence opinion more favor-
ably toward Vietnam. The Vietnamese
evidently have accepted this am-
biguously formulated link.
All three Indochina states are using
the US commitment to gain concessions
from Washington.
Laos does so most directly of them.
It has used the issue to extract limited
US aid and promises not to help resist-
ance forces.
Administration officials are reluctant
to take the next step and explain how
improved domestic opinion would ben-
efit Vietnam. This reluctance is due to
an awareness of Chinese and ASEAN
sensitivities to any form of overt linkage
between the two tracks of US policy,
despite unofficial concession that the
issues can’t be divorced totally. If the
MIA issue were resolved, Washington
would feel free to use its influence to
move toward a settlement on Kampu-
chea perhaps by being more encoura-
ging toward would-be regional go-be-
tweens, such as Indonesia and Aus-
tralia. □

skill of the financial planners at Elders
IXL? If you haven’t got it, there’s a sure
way to get it: become a unit holder in
Elders Equity Trust.
An equity trust is a pooling of
investments which enables the investor
or unit holder to become part owner of a
range of equities. These generally
comprise shares or securities, but may
also include debentures or money
market instruments.
The difference between trusts is the
difference between the skill, experience
and insights of the people who manage
them. That’s why Elders Equity Trust is
such an outstanding opportunity for you:
it enables you to tap into the financial
thinking of Elders, one of Australia’s
most successful corporations.
Who will manage
your investment?
The Manager of Elders Equity Trust
is Elders Portfolio Management Limited.
This company is part of the Finance
Group of Elders IXL Limited, one of
Australia’s largest companies with assets
exceeding $1.2 billion.
The directors of Elders Portfolio
Management Limited are either directors
or senior executives of the Elders IXL
Group. They represent a blend of
investment professionals and successful
corporate managers who presently
manage Superannuation and Trustee
funds exceeding $4OO million.
How you can tap into
Elders’ financial thinking.
The minimum investment require-
ment for entry into the Trust is $l,OOO.

COVER STORY/BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The goldfields ghosts
spring back to life
As Australia moves to double its gold production in the next two to three years, the shares of the
nation’s gold companies have tumbled. But, as DAVID HASELHURST reports, despite a
fall in the world gold price, the domestic price remains firm because of the falling SA. The gold
share sell-off has been overdone.
THE BAR of Kalgoorlie’s Star and
Garter Hotel was roaring on the Friday
night The Bulletin called in. Among the
merrymakers was Rob Wood, West
Australian sales manager for the heavy
equipment firm ISAS (WA). He was
shouting for his local staff and freely
showing off a $750,000 contract they
had just signed up to supply 50-tonne
trucks to prospector Bill Powell, a local
legend since striking his ounce-to-the-
tonne find 40km down the track toward
Perth at Coolgardie.
Wood ordered a round of middies
and offered the information that “we’ve
already sold him about $2 million of
plant.”
Next to the ISAS crowd stood the
directors of a small Perth property trust
who had come to town to look at build-
ing a $600,000 office block. But the local
connections were enthusiastically
talking it up into a $3 million project.
An earthmoving contractor who
recognised your scribe sidled over with
a double scotch to suggest an invest-
ment in a $200,000 syndicate being
formed to work gold dumps and surface
dirt west of the Ora Banda-Coolgardie
road.
This was the Star and Garter on
Friday night but it could have been
any pub on any night on the goldfields
where boom talk is the norm.
I had last visited Kalgoorlie in
March 1983 when the boom talk was
still strident and the gold price, at some
SA3SO/oz, was about SA6O/oz below
current levels despite the recent falls in
SUS prices.
At that time, we were taken to in-
spect a parched tract of land immediate-
ly north of Kalgoorlie’s Toorak the
suburb of Lamington where green gar-
dens surround substantial houses which
nevertheless are constructed largely of
timber, iron and fibro. The tract was to
be a new subdivision, the Hannans Es-
tate, 115 building lots being prepared by
the Kalgoorlie Town Council with
kerbed and sealed roads and under-
ground power.
Prospector Bill Powell shows off some rich specimens to geologist Chuck McCormick
In March last year, there was nothing
to see but survey pegs and the gravel
foundations of the subdivisional roads.
Fifteen months later, every lot has been
sold and more than 100 houses built.
The great surprise, however, is the
standard of the housing: Never before
has Kalgoorlie seen streets of double
brick and tile with homes that would be
imposing among the garden suburbs of
Sydney’s upper north shore.
Doug Dawes, regional manager for
the West Australian Department of In-
dustrial Development, points out a
$250,000 house built for fruit and veg-
etable wholesaler Graham Doust and a
$240,000 place owned by earthmoving
contractor Ivan Marsa. Practically
nothing comes in under $60,000 on this
up-market estate. Dawes says that an-
other 400 houses will be needed in Kal-
goorlie in the next 18 months not a lot
in urban Australia but prodigious in a
remote area where the population of the
twin towns of Kalgoorlie-Boulder runs
to 20,000.
The new accommodation is needed
for the mine expansion on the Golden
Mile and the dozens of new projects
bringing life back to the ghost towns
dotted through the surrounding back
country.
On nearby Mt Percy, Dawes points
to the foundations of a reservoir tank
with 20m walls which is being built at a
cost of $5.5 million. It will double the
capacity of Kalgoorlie’s water storage
which fills and empties four times a day
at the end of a 600 km pipeline from the
Mundaring Weir in the Darling Ranges
behind Perth. Already there is dissatis-
faction in some quarters of the town,
however, for the Public Works depart-
ment has sited the reservoir over recent-
ly-found extensions of gold-bearing
ground.
From the top of Mt Percy, we can see
a row of power pylons snaking back
across the horizon. They stretch south-
west for some 700 km to the Muja power
station on the Collie coalfields in the
lush jarrah forest country.
In October, Kalgoorlie’s old diesel-
powered generators are due to be turned


A new plant opens; 6 million tonnes of tailings dumps to be treated at Wiluna
off with the town and its mines to join
the state grid on completion of a $7O
million power transmission extension.
Another view from Mt Percy is over
the surface works of the Cassidy shaft
on Kalgoorlie Mining Associates’ Mt
Charlotte leases. The 1200 m-deep shaft
should be completed next year, at a cost
of around $7O million. It will replace the
Reward shaft whose ultimate demoli-
tion will more than pay for the new de-
velopment. The Reward shaft was sunk
in the old days on ore-bearing ground
and therefore the ore surrounding the
shaft could not be mined. Prudent mine
practice demands, on a deposit like the
Charlotte ore body, that no workings
are developed within 30-60 m of the
shaft.
The Reward shaft’s surrounding pil-
lar has been drill tested and its so-far
unmineable ore has produced values of
up to 20 gm/tonne. A probable million
tonnes of ore surround the shaft, ac-
cording to local mining engineers.
When it is finally dropped and hauled
out through the Cassidy, it should yield
more than enough to pay for the new
shaft even if the grade averages only 5
gm/tonne and the gold price a bit better
than SA4OO/tonne.
Driving down the Boulder Road
south of Kalgoorlie, Dawes points out
other signs of the goldfields’renewal.
There’s the first office of Claude de
Bernales, legendary tycoon of the first
half of the century. It’s a derelict shop in
front of a tumbling iron shed. It was
worth less than $20,000 two years ago
but sold recently for $70,000 and re-
building is about to begin.
On one side of the road is a new
bakery; on the other, Wesfarmers’ new
showrooms under construction. And
there’s Kalgoorlie Mining Associates’
new $1 million administration block.
Down the road are the Paringa leases,
re-opened last year by CSR and
Hampton Australia with a $27 million
mill to produce 35,000 oz a year from a
throughput of 180,000 tonnes of ore.
Dawes says that the Paringa group will
begin work soon on the portal to the
first decline shaft on the Golden Mile,
leading to a doubling of production in
12 months.
The new sense of confidence in the
west’s Golden Mile is reflected in scores
of gold development and exploration
ventures throughout Australia from
the Placer-sponsored Kidson Gold
Mines Ltd float launched last week for
North Queensland through wide-
ranging regional exploration across the
historic goldfields of NSW and Victoria
and all over the ancient Archean Pla-
teau that covers nearly a third of West-
ern Australia.
In a recent comprehensive study of
Australia’s emerging gold producers,
Melbourne brokers McCaughan Dyson
and Co point out that:
■ Australia’s gold production, although
small by world standards, has doubled
from an annual rate of 500,000 oz in
1981. Within three years, with the new
projects being developed, it should at
least double again.
■ Australia’s previous peaks in gold
production occurred in the 1850 s (3 mil-
lion oz a year), in 1903 (4.3 million), in
1940 (1.7 million) and in the late 50s (1.1
million). Then production declined to
very low levels in the mid-70s before the
gold price began to rise.
■ About 60 percent of current produc-
tion is from generally higher-cost
underground operations but only 15
percent of the new production antici-
pated in the next few years will come
from underground. Most will be from
low-cost open cuts.
■ Thirteen gold projects in Australia are
producing more than 10,000 oz a year
each and aggregating about 900,000 oz.
A larger number of projects producing
lesser quantities aggregate about
100,000 oz a year. Some 80 percent of
current production comes out of WA.
Recent weeks have brought a degree
of near panic in the market for Austra-
lian gold stocks which has been greatly
overdone.
The world price, universally quoted
in United States dollars, peaked for
1984 in early March at 5U5399.90 oz. It
stood at SUS3BB at March 30 and, with
a then exchange rate of $A =
5U50.9345, the equivalent domestic
price received by Australian producers
was SA4IS/oz.
The price since has fallen more than
14 percent, to around SUS34O/oz. But,
because the $A slipped nearly 12 per-
cent against the SUS to a recent ex-
change rate of around $A = SUSO.B2,
the consequence to the local gold price
has been marginal. A world gold price
of SUS34O/oz today translates to a
domestic price of about SA4I4/oz;
hardly a change.
Yet, the share prices of Australian
producers and companies soon to go
into production (see table, page 126)
have plunged as much as 40 percent.
There is some justification for high-
cost, underground producers such as
North Kalgurli to show some weakness
for they would be among the first to go
into losses if the gold price dipped much
below SA4OO/oz. There is also a lot
more security in seeing a higher world
gold price rather than depending on a
weak Australian dollar to maintain sol-
vency.
But many of the stocks marked down
are in that class of open-cut developers
and dump treaters able to operate
profitably with gold prices closer to half
their present levels.
Based on McCaughan Dyson’s re-
cent study, the accompanying table
shows a selection of WA’s larger pro-
ducers and their current estimated
break-even prices. All except North
Kalgurli are comfortably within profits
even if the price falls beneath SA4OO.
Nevertheless, planned expansion of
throughput at North Kalgurli from
60,000 oz this year to 75,000 oz next
year and 100,000 oz by 1986 should see
production costs down to a break-even
point of SA33O/oz in current dollars.

Among new projects in or approach-
ing production, the broker’s estimate of
break-even points for many come insig-
nificantly lower than for the established
producers.
Some of the estimated break-even
prices (SA) for new projects are:
■ $l5O/oz The Porphyry project

25 percent), destined to produce 31,000
oz/year and Griffins Find (Otter Ex-
ploration), to produce 14,000 oz/year.
■ $l6O/oz Harbor Lights (Carr Boyd
40 percent; Aztec Exploration 5 per-
cent), to produce 80,000 oz/year.
■ $l7O/oz Reedy’s (Metana
Minerals), opening next month with a
projected production of 26,000 oz/year;
Golden Crown (Australian Consolidated
Minerals NL), with a projected output
of 38,000 oz/year; Horseshoe Lights
(Barrack Mines 45.2 percent; Eastern
Petroleum 35.6 percent; Samantha Ex-
ploration 19.2 percent), with annual pro-
duction estimated at 53,000 oz.
■ $lBO/oz Kidston, 280 km north-west
of Townsville, Queensland (Kidston
Gold Mines Ltd), scheduled to produce
195,000 oz/year.
■ $l9O/oz Great Victoria (Great Vic-
toria Gold Ltd), to produce 35,000
oz/year; Bamboo Creek (Kitchener
Mining 50 percent; Haoma NW 25 per-
cent; Plenty River Mining NL 25 per-
cent), to produce 33,000 oz/year;
Nevoria (Jingellic Minerals 60 percent;
Southern Goldfields 40 percent), to
produce 20,000 oz/year from late 1984.
■ $2lO/oz Sons of Gwalia (Sons of
Gwalia NL), with an annual output of
30,000 oz.
■ $230/oz: Paddington (Pancontinental
Mining Ltd), to produce 85,000 oz/year;
Wiluna tailings project (Barrack Mines
50 percent; Metramar Minerals 50 per-
cent), to produce 30,000 oz/year.
Technical comment on the gold market
ONE OF the great problems for char-
tists in times of turbulence in inter-
national exchange markets is to know
which currency to use in plotting com-
modities.
Does one use sterling, which is the
currency of the London Metal Ex-
change albeit a weak denominator this
year, or US dollars, the strongest cur-
rency in the world in recent months? Or
from an Australian point of view, is one
best to express the major commodities
in Australian dollars? If a clear break-
down from a distribution pattern takes
place in SUS in say gold (such as has
occurred over the past fortnight), how
should one interpret this from the point
of view of an Australian gold mine?
Should one simply turn a blind eye to
the move and say that in $A no such
break has occurred and that no
downside price projections can be justi-
fied unless the price falls below
SA4OO/oz?
The accompanying chart compares
the London 3pm price of gold expressed
in SUS and SA/oz since the beginning
of 1982. This elapse captures the nadirs
of the 1980-1982 bear market in the yel-
low metal, the bottom having been re-
corded at SUS 296 and SA29O respect-
ively in June, 1982.
Until the end of February, 1983, gold
looked much the same whether plotted
in SUS or $A as the currencies were tied
but with the 10 percent devaluation in
March, 1983, the divergence between
SUS and $A became quite marked, a
process accentuated by the floating of
$A last December.
In SA, then, the price of gold has
been virtually steady since last October
whereas in SUS the metal has fallen by
12 percent at the extremity. Perhaps one
of the surprising side-effects of the fall
in the SUS price of gold has been the
massive depreciation in the share prices

of Australian gold stocks evident from

The only explanations for this big
sell-oflf appear to be that investors ex-
pect the fall in the $US price of gold to
outstrip the depreciation of $A against
the $US or that the 1984 federal budget
will contain a tax on companies earning
their living from gold mining or pos-
sibly that overseas investors are
dumping Australian mining stocks in
favor of investing in a stockmarket with
a harder underlying currency such as
the USA or Japan.

u $240/oz: Croydon, Queensland
(Central Coast Exploration NL), to
produce 18,500 oz/year; Kalgoorlie
(Black Hill Minerals 39.8 percent; East-
ern Petroleum 50.7 percent), still under
feasibility study, with a potential output
of 41,000 oz/year.
■ $250/oz: Pine Creek, in the Northern
Territory (Renison Goldfields Con-
solidated 65.9 percent; Enterprise Gold
Mines NL 31.4 percent), under a feasi-
bility study to produce 58,000 oz/year;
the Granites in the Northern Territory
(North Flinders Mines NL), under feasi-
bility to produce 53,000 oz/year.
Clearly, many of the up-coming pro-
ducers are costed well within profitable
operating margins even if the gold price
suffers a further significant fall. The dis-
counts in share prices since March 30
(see table) point to potential buys for
recovery opportunities in the market.
Among current producers, Whim
Creek stands out as one of the lowest-
cost operators with a break-even esti-
mate of $220/oz.
The share price of Whim Creek has
been discounted 19 percent, to $2.80,
since March 30 although the gold price
has held at about SA4IS/oz.
Whim Creek’s operation near
Meekatharra, WA, has reached a pro-
duction rate of 40,000 oz/year.
McCaughan Dyson estimated that
Whim Creek in the year to December
1984 would record a profit of $6 million
or 27c a share with gold averaging
SUS39O/oz equal to SA43O/oz at the
June exchange rate of $A = SUSO.9O.
Adjusting for the recent gold price fall
and the reduced value of the SA, if gold
holds for the rest of the year at its cur-
rent value of only SA4IS/oz, Whim
Creek’s net earnings should be reduced
by only about $300,000. That would
equal 26c a share, putting Whim Creek
on a price/earnings multiple of 10.7
times earnings.
Earnings should be 50 percent higher
in 1985, given the expectation that out-
put will rise to 45,000 oz and the $A
exchange rate will firm along with the
gold price. That would put Whim Creek
on a P/E of less than 7.5 and it also
owns 34 percent of all the enticing blue
sky in the new exploration arm
AustWhim Resources NL.
The North Royal Open cut; a treasure house for Central Norseman with a grade exceeding 12gm/tonne


speculators might also take hope
that the decline in the world gold price
and the uncertainty which that has pre-
cipitated might well deter the federal
government from any serious consider-
ations about taxing gold income par-
ticularly when the industry is getting on
its feet again and creating many jobs in
remote areas. □
Collapse in
gold shares
AUBTRALIAN gold shares have fallen
spectacularly over recent months in the
wake of the weakened world gold price
but, translated into Australian dol-
lars, the local gold price is higher than
when most miners were near their
peaks.
The following tables show the extent
of share price falls among major and
smaller gold producers.
The overseas gold price peaked for
1984 in early March at $U5399.90, fell
to a low of around SUS33O in early July
and late last week was showing some
recovery. But because the Australian
dollar had weakened so much against
the $U$, the return to Australian pro-
ducers has hardly been affected.
Here is how the gold price in SUS
and $A has changed between March 30
and July 19 and also how the exchange

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
One for widows and orphans
THE portfolio is starting to look well
fleshed again, thanks to Boral’s takeover
bid for Oil Company of Australia.
From a gain of 78 percent on our
investments at the end of March, we
slipped away in the market slump of the
past two months to a much slimmer 40-
odd percent gain. Now we’re fattening
up, with profits for the year so far of 61
percent on our initial bank of $15,000 in
shares and cash.
The market slump appears to be be-
hind us a view endorsed by leading
Sydney brokers Bain and Co last week.
Bain released a substantial study of the
current economic situation and outlook
for the share market and came up
with bullish targets over the next 12 to
18 months for a 14 percent lift in indus-
trial share prices and a 32 percent lift in
metal mining stocks.
Back in the edition of June 19, I re-
viewed the prospects of Golconda
Minerals NL, a gold dump stripper that
was undertaking a rights issue.
I suggested we might buy into it after
the new shares and options were listed.
The issue was a non-renounceable
one-for-three aimed at raising $2.8 mil-
lion with an offering of 8.015 shares at
30c plus an equal number of options at
5c to acquire by June 1986 another
share at 25c.
Jackson Graham Moore and Partners
underwrote the issue as the local gold
share market went into an irrational
slump. As a consequence, I understand
the sub-underwriters got stuck with a
bundle of paper. While the options have
traded around 10c-12c since listing, the
shares have been discounted by up to 5c
below their issue price and late last
week traded at 27c.
This is ludicrous. The company is al-
ready a major gold miner with produc-
tion in the year to June 30, 1984, of
around 14,000 oz and an expected profit
to be announced of around $1.5 million
(or 3.8 c a share on the presumption that
all the options are exercised).
But in the current year, with the
opening of at least two new gold dump
operations, production is scheduled to
rise to more than 27,600 oz and on sums
done by the underwriters, if gold holds
at SA4OO/oz (it’s better than SA42O), a
profit of $4,465,000 is in prospect.
That’s equivalent to 11.1 c a share
even allowing for the exercise of all out-
standing options which would com-
pletely eliminate group debt.
$o the shares at 27c are selling on a
bargain multiple of only 2.4 times this
year’s projected earnings. A maiden
dividend of 5c a share has also been
tipped giving them a potential yield
of 18.5 percent.
For cautious investors, the calibre of
the board is highly reassuring. In June,
the company announced the appoint-
ment of a new board member and gen-
eral manager Peter Willcocks, for-,
merly mine manager at the BHP-
Newmont consortium’s Telfer open cut.
Chairman is Brian Johnston, a civil
engineer and principal of the Pennant
Holdings group of property develop-
ment companies. Managing-director is
Bob Baldock, former senior partner for
14 years in a public accountancy prac-
tice and the fourth board member is
Melbourne solicitor Peter Just. Between
them, the board controls more than 30
percent of the 32.06 million issued
shares and 8 million options. A dozen
institutions hold another 25 percent.
With new plant and dump treatment
operations coming on stream, Jacksons
estimate total costs for each ounce of
production will come down from an ex-
pected $249/oz in 1984-85 to $165/oz in
1985-86 when projected earnings are
$7,169,000 or 17.9 c a share.
It’s almost a gold share for widows
and orphans, so I’ve taken 6000 in the
expectation of certain gains.

TAKEOVERS
Murdoch’s bid to
become a
newsprint supremo
By Bulletin correspondents
IF RUPERT Murdoch’s SUS 744 mil-
lion bid for control of St Regis Corpora-
tion of America comes off, he will be-
come the biggest newsprint supplier in
North America and his publishing ri-
vals will become his customers.
Murdoch’s bid puts a value of
SUSI67I million on the large forest
products group a price that is less
than half Murdoch’s reputed
assessment of its real worth.
It marks Murdoch’s sec-
ond attempt this year to
greatly expand his North Am-
erican business through a
massive share market plunge.
His earlier attempt to take
control of Warner Communi-
cations Inc was thwarted and
he sold out his 8 percent hold-
ing for a SUS4O million profit.
On June 26, Murdoch first
revealed he had acquired a 5.6
percent holding in St Regis
(1.8 million shares) for an av-
erage price of less than SUS 36
a share.
His present bid at SUSS2 a
share to lift his News Group’s
holding to 50.1 percent will
cost a further SUS 744 million.
Through a consortium of 22
banks led by the Midland Bank of the
UK, he has organised a credit line of, as
he put it, “not less than” SUS7SO mil-
lion to finance the bid. Sources close to
the News Group say the credit line, in
fact, is SUSB2S million and he may go
for all of St Regis.
The St Regis board has fought off
two share market raids already this
year, including one from a consortium
led by British entrepreneur Sir James
Goldsmith. In February the Goldsmith
consortium sold its share back to St
Regis for a reputed $4O million profit.
While Murdoch made a killing on
his Warner shares, he has hitherto been
unsuccessful in expanding out of news-
papers in the United States. His
proposed Skyband network of satellite-
delivered pay TV services had to be
postponed indefinitely when his plan-
ners recalculated the costs of reception
dishes and the availability of film stock.
His bid for Warner, motivated by its
possession of a film library, failed when
Warner fought back with a series of
legal challenges and corporate
countermoves.
Compared with these expansion at-
tempts, the proposed St Regis takeover
is much more straightforward. The third
biggest timber company in the United
States, St Regis is a major producer of
newsprint and cardboard. It also has a
vast holding of timber lands, as well as
insurance and energy interests.
Because of bureaucratic manage-
ment and the collapse of home building
from 1979 to 1983, St Regis is widely
believed to be undervalued at around
SUS 47 a share. Both Merrill Lynch and
Paine Webber issued favorable reports
on St Regis earlier this year, both rec-
ommending the corporation as a reas-
onable buy in the short run and an ex-
cellent buy in the long run, mainly be-
cause of the value of its timber holdings.
Since the harvesting rate on these hold-
Rupert Murdoch: a new attempt at expansion in the US
ings can be speeded up, the insurance
and energy interests can be sold, and the
asset values attributed to the forests
altered, Murdoch will have plenty of
opportunities to get a lot more out of St
Regis than he proposes to pay. Accord-
ing to St Regis lawyers, Murdoch put
the gross value of St Regis at SUS 3.6
billion to SUS3.B billion to a meeting of
bankers in London at which he was
asking for a SUS7SO million line of
credit. His offer last week of SUSS2 a
share, in cash until he reaches 50.1 per-
cent, and thereafter in securities, will
make a total purchase price of SUSI. 67
billion, or less than half of Murdoch’s
estimate of its value.
Murdoch is keeping silent about his
takeover strategy, but it is highly unlike-
ly that he believed for a moment last
week that the St Regis board would ac-
cept his offer. The intent of his offer,
which is SUSS above the market even
after announcement, is presumably to
create shareholder disaffection with the
St Regis board, to grab media attention,
and justify a hostile takeover bid in the
coming weeks. According to St Regis
lawyers Murdoch told the London
bankers he would pay up to SUSSS a
share for St Regis.
Analysts forecast a rosy future for St
Regis (even rosier if US interest rates
dropped). Demand for coated paper
was up 12 percent last year and as the
American recovery gathers pace, so ad-
vertising bookings rise and the demand
for paper and newsprint accordingly.
The firm’s cardboard division, with
sales in 1982 of almost $7OO million,
notched up a corporate loss, due to
lacklustre demand and production
problems. Yet St Regis, with 17 percent
of the national market, should be soon
making substantial profits, especially
when a new plant comes on stream in a
year or so.
Coated paper sales in 1983 were $619
million, yielding $74 million
profit and newsprint sold $3OO
million with $l9 million
profit. Construction con-
tributed $460 million and $4O
million respectively while
overseas interests (including
plants in Australia) added
$320 million and $lB million.
Insurance contributes $25
million to overall profits and
energy (St Regis owns oil, gas,
and lignite coal deposits)
added $29 million.
Murdoch’s bid follows a
few weeks after his assertion
on American television that
he was no longer interested in
acquiring American news-
paper properties. He now has
the flagship New York Post,
the Boston Herald, Chicago
Sun Times, plus papers in San
Antonio, Texas, and two weekly maga-
zines.
The American interests of News
Limited are almost certainly still net
losers, mainly because the Post loses
around SUSIO million a year or more,
and the interest bill on his other news-
paper acquisitions is likely to be still ex-
ceeding profits.
News Limited expansion in the
United States is powered by profits from
Australia and the UK rather than the
United States, where Murdoch’s reputa-
tion relies on his political clout, his ag-
gressiveness and charm.
In Australia, St Regis had for many
years a joint venture business with ICI
International which, until last year, gen-
erated revenues of around $46 million a
year. In March, 1983, the venture was
split up, with St Regis retaining owner-
ship of two packaging companies
Bates Sacks Pty Ltd, which makes
multi-walled sacks and Austrapak Pty
Ltd, maker of flexible packaging. A
third St Regis subsidiary, Light and
Denton Pty Ltd, makes gravure printing
cylinders. □

WILDCAT
Gollin saga nears its end
ACCOUNTANTS Price Waterhouse
are happy to report that the last episode
is being written in the saga of Gollin
Holdings Ltd.
At the failed trader’s head office in
Silverwater, a lone secretary Siglinde
Baumann, the company’s only em-
ployee waits for the termination of
Price Waterhouse’s scheme of arrange-
ment. Accountant John Rodger, admin-
istrator of the scheme, advertised last
week the sale of Gollin Holdings “a
delisted public company under a
scheme of arrangement since 1977. Over
10,000 shareholders.”
The company shell, which will have
no assets or liabilities or tax losses, is
being sold on its shareholder base and
corporate structure. Rodger says he
placed the advertisement to test buyer
interest. If a purchaser appears, Rodger
will have to come to some agreement
with creditors on a satisfactory price.
If a gold explorer made an offer to
buy, say, 70 percent of the Gollin shares
in exchange for assets such as prospect-
ing areas it could mean some life after
death for Gollin shareholders.
As far as schemes of arrangement go,
the Gollin scheme has been a success. It
was estimated in 1977 that, if Gollin
Holdings and subsidiary Gollin & Co
had been liquidated, the return from the
fire sale would have brought 19 and 33
cents in the dollar respectively to un-
secured creditors.
Projections at the time of the outset
of the scheme of arrangement were for
returns of 30 and 52 cents in the dollar.
In the seven years of the scheme, the
holding company’s creditors have
received 39.5 cents and the trading com-
pany’s 49.6 cents in the dollar. The ac-
countants predict that another 2 cents
and 6 cents will find its way to the credi-
tors of the respective companies at ter-
mination.
Gold giant
WHEN THE Canadian-backed Kid-
ston gold mine in northern Queensland
completes its first year of operations in
1985 it will have added around 25 per-
cent to national annual gold output
making it far and away the biggest pro-
ducer in Australia.
C. Allen Born, chairman and chief
executive officer of Placer Development
Ltd of Canada, was in Australia last
week to launch the prospectus for
Kidston Gold Mines Ltd and to offer a
few thoughts on Australia’s investment
rating and the outlook for the world
gold price.
Kidston is being brought into pro-
duction by a partnership of Placer (80
percent) and Elders-IXL (20). The pros-
pectus is offering 18.75 million shares at
$1.60, two-thirds from the Placer hold-
ing and one-third from Elders-IXL.
Following the $3O million raising,
Kidston’s public shareholding will be 15
percent, Elders 15 and Placer 70 with a
commitment to sell a further 15 percent
to Australian interests by mid-1986.
Born said the first gold pour was
scheduled from the mine in February
1985, with production for that year es-
timated at 281,0000 z, reducing to av-
erage over five years 196,0000 z of gold
and 156,0000 z of silver annually.
With production costs estimated at
SAI9S/oz, it comes within the lower
third on the cost curve for world pro-
ducers. “We have a saying around the
office,” he said: “If we can’t produce
gold for less than SUS2OO an ounce
($A243) we shouldn’t be in the busi-
ness.”
Born said Placer “realistically”
looked at a gold price in the medium to
long term of SUS4OO-SUS4SO/oz to jus-
tify investment in a gold mine. (That
compares with last week’s prices of less
than SUS3SO/oz).
He sees a world “appetite” of about
40 million oz a year, of which South
Africa produces about 27 million oz. He
says that much of South Africa’s pro-
duction has a cost of close to
SUS2BO/oz, a floor below which gold
“can’t fall” because significant produc-
tion would become unprofitable.
Placer now capitalised at around
$9OO million first listed in Australia in
1927 when it sponsored the float of
Bulolo Gold Dredging Ltd a highly
successful miner in Papua New Guinea
from 1930 to 1965. Australians still own
more than 5 percent of Placer’s capital.
Placer grades all its areas of oper-
ation and potential investment accord-
ing to a risk rating scale in which the
USA is No 1 with a risk-rating factor of
near zero in states such as Nevada and
Montana, rising to closer to 15 percent
for California. The rating takes into ac-
count factors such as political stability,
security, environmental lobbies, unions,
government charges and attitudes to
miners. Canada and Australian states
rate between 15 and 25 percent, with
Queensland No 1. □


THE CHARTIST
Bulls and bears now poles apart
by Russell hander
A FEATURE of the stockmarket scene
in Australia is a clear polarisation
among analysts as to which way share
prices will go in the second half of 1984.
The bulls are saying that this is a
heaven-sent opportunity for buying,
brought about by a world-wide bout of
panic selling. Everything, they argue,
points to new highs in the major share
indexes before long.
The US economy is gaining strength,
as is our own; corporate results are go-
ing to be good for 1983-84 and better
still in 1984-85; dividend yields and
price earnings multiplies are highly
favorable from a buyer’s viewpoint; and
the depreciation of the $A against the
SUS will put the mining industry back
on its feet. Share prices have shown re-
markable strength, they would argue,
against a concerted onslaught by sellers
and a base is appearing on the charts
from which a new bull market will de-
velop.
In contrast, the bears are pointing to
the grand array of broken primary
uptrend lines throughout the resource
and industrial sectors of our market, in
the share indexes here and in the major
overseas stockmarkets. They also note
the weakness of commodity prices
which, at this stage of the business cycle,
should be putting on weight. Maybe,
they suggest, the widely-predicted com-
modity boom will prove to have been a
mirage and they cite compulsive Third
World dumping of metals and other pri-
mary products as a possible cause.
They also note that inflation appears
to have died a mysterious death in the
US and could well be moribund in Aus-
tralia, contrary to conventional wisdom.
Could it be, they ask, that interest rates
will stay high in real terms and that
share yields will adjust upwards to re-
flect markedly lower inflationary expec-
tations?
On the technical side, the bears also
would be noting that momentum indi-
cators are pointing to an outgoing
stockmarket tide for the rest of 1984, al-
beit relieved from time to time (as of
now) by rallies.
The accompanying chart shows the
monthly average of the All Ordinaries
Index plotted against its six- and 12-
month moving averages. This serves to
highlight the scale of bull and bear mar-
kets over the past generation and the
fact that there has been only one soft
landing over this 25-year span the
mini-bear market of 1976-77.
In percentage retracement terms the
current slide would have to carry to
about 612 on the All Ords to be of equal
intensity to this episode. This would
suggest that once the current rally ends,
another downleg will materialise.
As to whether the All Ords will hold
above 600 or not is difficult to foresee at
this stage. The six and 12-month moving
averages are of use only as confirmation
of major turning points in the market,
giving quite late signals at both tops and
bottoms.
Theory has it that a major turning
point is suggested by the index slicing
through its six-month moving average.
This is reinforced when the six-month
moving average turns down (as occur-
red in June, 1984) and is confirmed
when the six-month crosses the 12-
month moving average, an event likely
to occur either this month or next. How-
ever, if one waited for this confirmation
before selling one would have missed
the boat by many precious months. In
fact in the case of the 1967-77 bear mar-
ket this confirmation coincided with
bargain basement in the All Ords.
As discussed from time to time in
this column, a more effective guide to
timing is provided by the Coppock In-
dicators, being weighted momentum
charts. These at present come down on
the side of the bears. □

THE MODEST FARMER
Intervention is egg-headedness
by Bert Kelly
A YEAR AGO I wrote two articles
about the egg-marketing feather bed
and since then things have been getting
worse. This became apparent with the
TV coverage of the raid and arrest by
inspectors of the New South Wales Egg
Marketing Corporation of poultry
farmers who had the temerity to prod-
uce and sell their eggs outside the statu-
tory egg markting system. The supreme
irony is that the managing director of
the corporation is Ken Baxter who has
for years been tipping buckets of scorn
on the indolence and inefficiencies of
statutory marketing authorities. Those
of us who had the good fortune to hear
Baxter’s hilarious description of his
white mice marketing board at an Out-
look conference will always think of
him and it with gratitude. But now he is
driving the reprehensible NSW egg
marketing machine and he has my sym-
pathy. If he cannot clean up that mess,
then no one can.
Before we look closely at the mess
the industry is in, we should ask why it
is thought to be necessary for govern-
ments to get involved in the industry at
all? Poultry farmers claim that, because
there is almost no demand for export
eggs, it is essential for egg production to
be tailored to meet the local demand
with very little over to be sold cheaply
overseas. This is the same claim now be-
ing made by dairy farmers who also
have a weak export market. The pro-
duction of eggs is limited by govern-
ments giving selected poultry farmers
the right to keep a certain quota of hens
which should produce enough eggs to
supply the local market with almost
none over. Dairy farmers hope to do
this also but they intend to call their
quotas “entitlements,” “quotas” having
unpleasant connotations since the NSW
chook farmer arrests hit the TV fan.
However, this does not answer the
question: Why do governments have to
get embroiled in egg regulation? There
is also a weak export market for pig
meat but pig farmers manage very well
without government intervention and
they have disadvantages that poultry
farmers escape. For instance, most pigs
are killed in export abattoirs and so
farmers have to pay high inspection fees
even though their pigs are not exported.
And pig meat has to compete in the
rough, cruel world in fierce competition
with red and chicken meat. Indeed, a
pig producer told me the other day that
he felt like a man in a swamp up to his
arse in alligators! Pig farmers may
sometimes look with longing at some
statutory marketing feather bed but they
quickly put this temptation behind
them.
There is almost no export market for
vegetables either but, by some magical
market mechanism, cities seem to be
supplied with fresh vegetables every day
without the government’s guiding hand.
Indeed, the very thought of the govern-
ment switching demand from carrots to
cauliflowers makes my thin blood run
cold.
Another reason why government in-
tervention is said to be necessary is to
ensure that eggs are supplied at stable
prices and that there are always enough
eggs to go round. But there is nothing
sacred about stable egg prices; meat and
vegetable prices go up and down as sup-
ply and demand for them fluctuates.
What is wrong with that? Why not let
Mavis decide whether she wants ex-
pensive eggs in the winter or more eggs
in the spring when they are cheaper? It
is her money she is spending, not the
government’s. Even though she gets
uptight about my striped trousers, she is
not stupid.
Poultry farmers say that, if the gov-
ernment is not regulating the supply of
eggs, a fate worse than death may result
and we might not have enough eggs to
go round. The same fear is often ex-
pressed after droughts when people say
there may not be enough sheep or cattle
for restocking. But we always find that,
when stock prices rise, animals seem al-
most to materialise out of the wood-
work. And, with our ability rapidly and
cheaply to send eggs in refrigerated
transport across Australia, there is no
chance of running out of eggs and
everyone knows this.
There is, indeed, no logical reason
why egg production should be con-
trolled by anything other than market
forces as is done with pigs and veg-
etables. The only people who want eggs
regulated are the poultry farmers who
are comfortably ensconced on their
feather beds. But ask the poultry farm-
ers who were raided and arrested in
NSW what they think of government
control of egg marketing or ask the poor
old consumers. But, of course, no one
has worried about them for years not
even Labor governments supposed to be
looking after little people.
We have examined the reasons why a
few people want the egg industry
regulated; next week we will look at the
mess we have made of it. □

When Len Buckeridge examined the benefits of carpets manufactured
with Du Pont Antron XL nylon fibre, his choice was clear, because carpet
made from Antron XL is easier to clean and because it has such a long life.
“Antron XL was just the obvious way to go," says Len. “Already it has
had a considerable effect in lowering the hefty overheads involved in
contract carpet maintenance!’
Since Griffin House was completed, the carpet has drawn nothing
but praise, both for its quality appearance and for its practicality.

A PIERCING scream rent the air of
Pierpont Manor. Mrs Pierpont’s
Burmese cat, Mandalay, had struck
again.
When Mrs Pierpont acquired the fe-
line she was assured it was affectionate
but neurotic. Unfortunately Mandalay
turned out to be not so much neurotic as
schizophrenic. She appears to be under
the impression that she is a Queensland
blue heeler and spends a great deal of
her time biting Mrs Pierpont’s ankles,
something your correspondent has not
attempted since the Stock Exchange
Ball of 1928.
In his younger days, Pierpont would
have rushed to the aid of a damsel - or
even a Mrs Pierpont in distress. But
after several slaps in the face your corre-
spondent has learned wisdom and now
leaves damsels to get out of distress in
their own incomparably efficient ways.
So Pierpont returned to his reading
matter, which happened to be the pros-
pectus for Australian Innovation Corpor-
ation, which was offering to let your cor-
respondent in on the ground floor of the
exciting, new, high-tech revolution.
For all Pierpont knows, Australian
Innovation may be bristling with future
Thomas Edisons but Pierpont might
give all the high-tech stocks a miss.
Your correspondent has this uncom-
fortable feeling that high technology
can, at least in some cases, get you into
the same sort of financial disasters as
the old-fashioned low technology.
Perhaps Pierpont was prejudiced be-
cause he had just been reading an old
edition of Forbes magazine which told
the story of the Copperhead missile.
Pierpont first heard of the Copperhead
several years ago. It was a ground-hug-
ging missile packed with modern wiz-
ardry. It could be launched from a dis-
tance, streak across the countryside and
home in on a target which was identified
by shining a laser beam on to it. “In-
credible,” Pierpoint can remember
thinking when he first heard of it, “I
don’t know how they do it.”
Several million dollars later, it turns
out the US Department of Defence is
none too sure how to do it, either. Al-
though the project was begun in 1973,
the American army still does not seem
to have a reliable laser-guided artillery
shell.
The last time Pierpont was involved
in a war, artillery shells were made by
Krupp for a few shillings each and were
fired by the hundred at the enemy’s
trenches on the general principle that
with luck you might hit some of the
other chaps or at least deafen them. The
Copperhead costs $U554,000 a shell
and as the Pentagon needs 30,000 of
them the whole project will cost $1.6 bil-
lion. In the good old days you could
have run a whole war for less than that.
One problem with the Copperhead
was that the sophisticated electronics
packed into the 137 cm shell had to con-
tinue working after being blasted out of
a cannon. During tests with dummy
rounds, the copper cone inside kept
slipping back and cutting wires, thereby
fouling up the guidance system.
The contractors spent a great deal of
money trying to solve this problem, un-
til some bright boffin realised that when
the shell was packed with explosive the
cone would not slip. In other words,
they had been trying to solve a problem
that did not exist.
Nor had the US army thought much
about the conditions in which the
weapon would be used. If the Copper-
head were fired in real life, there might
well be smoke on the battlefield and if
it were in Western Europe quite pos-
sibly fog as well. In operational tests,
the Copperhead hit only one smoke-
obscured target in three because the
lasers tended to reflect off the haze, giv-
ing false readings.
When the Copperhead could not get
a true laser reading it would fly around
in circles then fall to the ground, which
was not much of a result for $54,000.
The boffins did all sorts of frightfully
clever things to the laser beams and
improved accuracy to three hits out of
four in smoke but the Copperhead still
performs poorly in rain or snow.
The US army stipulated originally
that the Copperhead had to be able to
operate under a cloud base at 600
metres. Several years later, a weather
analyst pointed out that in West Ger-
many clouds were below 600 metres for
20 percent of the time. From his own
knowledge of northern Germany,
Pierpont has no trouble believing this.
Another problem was that some hap-
less infantryman had to shine the laser
beam on the target presumably an on-
coming Russian tank. The smart missile
relied on two foot soldiers lugging 25kg
of laser apparatus several kilometres
ahead of the cannon. After spending
five minutes setting up the laser, the sol-
diers then had to radio back to head-
quarters while shining a laser on the
tank for up to 13 seconds.
Reading this made Pierpont feel very
glad that he was too old and unfit for
army duty these days. After all, if the
soldiers can see the tank, the tank may
well be able to see the soldiers. Indeed,
such is modern wizardry that the tank
could be equipped with laser detectors,
enabling it to trace the soldiers with
considerable accuracy.
The army’s official response to this is
that the soldiers will be in no danger
because when the laser alarm rings in-
side the tank, the Russians will panic.
Well, if Pierpont were one of the foot


soldiers, the Russians would not be the
only ones panicking. All up, it takes
about four minutes to contact base, arm
the shell, load the cannon and call in a
Copperhead strike.
In this time a Russian tank travelling
at 30kmh can cover two kilometres. So
if the soldiers set up their laser equip-
ment two kilometres from the nearest
tank, it would be running over their toes
by the time the good old Copperhead
arrived. All of which enhanced
Pierpont’s already high opinion of the
virtues of cowardice but did nothing
much for his wariness about high tech.
Another scream echoed through the
halls as Mandalay sank her fangs into
Mrs Pierpont’s left sesamoid. Pierpont
slammed down the prospectus because
here was one problem Pierpont could
not only solve but also turn into a sound
investment.
Several years ago, Bill Hornadge of
Stamp News issued a prospectus for the
Dubbo Cat Farm. The idea was that all
the stray cats of Australia would be
rounded up and locked in cages in a big
paddock near Dubbo. The cats would
breed kittens at a rate of 12 a year.
When fully grown the toms would be
slaughtered and the skins exported to
Japan at 50c each.
Simultaneously, a rat farm would be
set up in the next paddock. The carcases
of the dead cats would be fed to the rats,
which in turn would be fed to the cats
and the entire operation would be self-
supporting.
Here at last was a chance to start this
financial version of perpetual motion,
using Mandalay as a base.
Pierpont explained the project to
Mrs Pierpont, who stopped swabbing
her ankle with iodine and gave your
correspondent a glare that would have
turned the Medusa to stone. “You mon-
ster!” she snarled.
Mandalay took more direct action.
She bit your correspondent on the
ankle. □
CHESS
Should no pawn be an island?
by Terrey Shaw
IF YOU want to start an argument
among chess players, one good way to
go about it is to get them involved in a
discussion on the isolated Queen’s pawn
that is, a pawn on the Queen’s file
which has no neighboring friendly
pawns on the adjacent Queen’s Bishop
or King files.
The isolated Q pawn is weak because
it cannot be defended by a pawn. It
must be defended by pieces, a task
which restricts their activity.
On the other hand, this pawn island
covers the squares K 5 and QBS, thus
supporting pieces which can use these
two useful squares as handy outposts.
Enemy pieces also are denied access to
them.
The arguments over whether these
strengths outweigh the weaknesses have
raged ever since Philidor laid the foun-
dation for our understanding of pawn
structures in his Analyse de Jeu des
Echecs, published in 1749.
Neither side lacks eminent spokes-
men. Whether you choose to agree with
Tartakover that “an isolated pawn
spreads gloom all over the chessboard”
or opt for Tarrasch’s dictum that “he
who fears an isolated Queen’s pawn
should give up chess” is simply a matter
of individual style.
The isolated Q pawn triumphs in the
following neat win by former Austra-
lian champion Doug Hamilton. The
game is from the Victorian Masters
Tournament, played in Melbourne.

The inevitable happened
last week (as hundreds of

when we published the above

As one wit pointed out,
their medal chances would

claiming that it was an Irish
eight but the truth is that the

We are glad to point out,
however, that the coxless four
John Bentley (SA), David

pects at Los Angeles.
We are even more glad that

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
WHITE has just re-entered after
rolling a 4-5 and in doing so he .
has captured Black’s 4 point. Now
White has a 5 left to play. Four
possible moves are illustrated
two dotted lines and two solid
lines. Which is best?
Think further and picture the
game if Black held White’s 5
point. He would have to be the
favorite to win.
On the other hand, if White
captured it the odds would favor
him. At the moment, the game is
revolving around W 5.
The two dotted line plays (812
to W 8 and W 6 to Wl) should be
discarded without second thought
as they do nothing for White’s
game except weaken it.
The first solid line play, B 4 to
89, may appear worthwhile to the
beginner but it’s not. First, it
leaves the remaining man on B 4
extremely vulnerable and if Black
captures that point with White on
the bar then things will look bleak
for White.
The other reason for not hit-
ting on B 9 is that it increases
Black’s chances of capturing the
vital W 5. As it stands, Black needs
any straight 4, a 3-1 or 2-2 to cap-
ture W 5 14 shots in all.
If Black has a man on the bar
then he can capture W 5 by re-en-
tering with any straight 5, a 1-4, 2-
4, 3-4, 2-2 or 3-2 20 shots in all,
six more shots than if he were not
on the bar.
White’s best move is to hit on
W 5 from WlO. Twenty returns by
Black will hit on the 5 point but
only a roll of 5-4 will give him that
point.

Opening lead — jack of clubs.
THE OPPORTUNITY to make a
spectacular bid or play in bridge is
comparatively rare but the oppor-
tunity to make an ordinary mis-
take occurs on almost every deal.
A player’s skill therefore is
measured more by the frequency
of his errors than by the number of
ingenious bids or plays he makes.
Take this deal where declarer
had nine virtually certain tricks in
no trump but finished down one.
West led the jack of clubs, East
playing the queen, and South
could count eight sure tricks —
three spades, three hearts and two
clubs.
The only source of a ninth was
in diamonds, so South took East’s
queen with the king and led a dia-
mond at trick two.
West alertly put up his king
and returned the club 10. Declarer
ducked but West played a third
club, dislodging the ace. When
South then led another diamond
West took the ace and cashed two
more clubs for a one-trick set.
Declarer failed because, at
trick one, he neglected to guard
against the only lie of the cards
that could defeat him: namely, if
West had five clubs and the A-K.
of diamonds. Three no trump was
unassailable against any other div-
ision of either clubs or diamonds.
To protect against this possi-
bility, South should have ducked
East’s queen of clubs at the first
trick.
If the clubs proved to be div-
ided 5-1, East would then be un-
able to continue the suit and
would be forced to shift to another
suit, giving declarer ample time to
develop a diamond trick. If East
had a second club to return, it
would mean that the clubs were
divided no worse than 4-2 and
again South would prevail easily.
Observe that making the con-
tract did not involve a spectacular
play; all that declarer had to do
was exercise caution.
