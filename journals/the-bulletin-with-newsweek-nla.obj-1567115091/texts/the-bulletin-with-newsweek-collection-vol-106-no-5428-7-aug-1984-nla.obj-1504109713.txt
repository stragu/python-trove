THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
BBC blew it
The world’s most prestigious golf tour-
nament the British Open played at
the world’s most famous golf course
St Andrew’s in Scotland this year pro-
vided the BBC with the greatest oppor-
tunity to show millions of viewers
throughout the world what live tele-
vision is all about.
The BBC failed miserably and I shed
tears of blood night after night waiting
and hoping in vain to see an exciting
full coverage of the world’s best golfers,
past and present, succeeding or failing
to show their best talents.
Australian TV showed the Poms how
to televise cricket and the time is ripe
for the Nine Network to tender for the
world television rights of next year’s
British Open Golf Tournament. I am
sure the American networks would
willingly accept an Australian Nine
coverage.
Where the BBC failed dismally was
in covering mainly the final two or three
groups to hit off. They continually com-
mitted the cardinal sin of letting the
cameras “walk” the players from one
shot to the next while we listened to ex-
cited applause for action on other holes
covered by cameras but not shown. The
BBC have apparently never heard of a
split screen to show two top contenders
in action at the same time on different
holes.
The two par-three holes at St
Andrew’s (the Bth and 11th) were
covered by camera but I didn’t see Ben
Crenshaw’s thrilling hole-in-one at the
Bth on the final day which was the most
spectacular shot at this year’s British
Open and Crenshaw’s first-ever “ace” in
a tournament. Crenshaw had hit off
early and was not in contention so it
was possible the BBC boys had taken a
morning tea break at this time. If it was
televised I must have been sent to sleep
by Mark McCormack’s boring com-
mentary. This multi-millionaire Ameri-
can sports management tycoon should
never be allowed near a microphone.
American TV also was guilty of miss-
ing a hole-in-one at the Augusta US
Masters in the late 1970 s when Gary
Player scored an ace at a par three not
covered by CBS cameras but I was for-
tunate enough to see it because I was on
the course.
For the normal golf viewer it might
appear harsh to criticise a TV coverage
missing holes-in-one, but for the experi-
enced Australian TV producers it is not
a difficult task to ensure that every shot
on every par-three hole is recorded with
the actual aces, if any, and' the near
misses being stored on video-tape for
replay while all the errant shots are im-
mediately wiped. It costs nothing extra
to do this except keen concentration
and skill from experienced operators.
Many young Australians might not
know that Australian television was the
first in the world to provide a coverage
of the full 18 holes of a golf tournament.
That was way back in 1960 when Chan-
nels 2, 7 and 9 combined their cameras,
commentators, technicians and equip-
ment (produced by Nine) to cover the
18 holes of the Australian Open at
Kensington in Sydney.
For the 1978 US Open the American
Broadcasting Company publicly
“Sure weakens his case by
resorting to showbiz ...”

claimed that “for the first time in the
world” they would be covering the full
18 holes of a golf tournament. A top US
golf magazine took American Broad-
casting to task over this and told the
American nation that Australia had
done this 18 years before and were still
doing it most successfully. So, come on

Bewildered by Blainey
May I express total agreement with the
statement by Andrew Norton (B, July
24): “It is high time the word ‘racist’ was
used a lot more carefully, instead of just
thrown at anyone who even just un-
intentionally questions the views of an
ethnic group ...”
It is quite inappropriate to apply the
word to Geoffrey Blainey, given his
total life work. Last month the council
of this institute issued a statement in
which it acknowledged the right of
peaceful demonstration, but deplored
recent attempts to prevent Professor
Blainey expressing his views.
The council said at the same time
that his arguments contained mislead-
ing statements, such as suggesting that
government policy showed preference
to Vietnamese as regards family re-
union. In fact, family reunion is rather
more restricted for Vietnamese than for
other people.
We are also quite bewildered by his
remarks about multiculturalism (B, July
3). Far from being “in tatters,”
multicultural policies to promote social
equity and understanding are proving
their value in schools, workplaces, hos-
pitals and other areas of the community,
and are highly regarded in other coun-
tries. And contrary to Professor
Blainey’s assertions multicultural re-
search highlights the difficult as well as
the valuable aspects of migration.

French exploration
Re John Stackhouse’s article and book
review “Doing the right thing by
Napoleon” (B, July 24): In March 1982,
a small ceremony was held at Marengo
(near Apollo Bay, Vic) to mark the
180th anniversary of Baudin’s discovery
of Cap Marengo, and a new grandstand
was dedicated to his memory.
The credit, for completing (in March
1802) the exploration of the segment of
Victorian coastline between Port Phillip
Bay and the Cape Patton/Cape Otway
area, belongs to Nicolas Baudin who
commanded the French expedition.
Baudin died in 1803 on the return
journey to France. The official accounts
of the expedition were published in
France, in French, and belatedly, in
three volumes. The first volume con-
cerned natural history and was pub-
lished by Francois Peron in 1807. After
Peron’s death the second and third vol-
umes in the series Voyage de
Decouvertes aux Terres Australes were
written by Louis Desaulces de Freycinet
in 1815 and 1816, and published with
maps and charts.
The resultant 1815 chart of the seg-
ment of Victorian coastline explored in
March 1802, identifies in about their
present locations on either side of Cape
Otway, both Cap Marengo and Cap
Volney. Somewhat puzzlingly, those
two place names have survived to the
present time. But other nearby place
names, assigned by Baudin’s expedi-
tion, have not.
It is true that Baudin’s explorations
did not receive early attention in Aus-
tralia. On the other hand, The Lost Aus-
tralia of Francois Peron by Colin Wal-
lace is by no means the first work on the
subject, see eg H. M. Cooper French Ex-
ploration in South Australia 1802-1803
(Adelaide 1952); H. M. Cooper The Un-
known Coast (a supplement) (Adelaide
1955); A. Sharp The Discovery of Aus-
tralia (Oxford UP 1963 at p 235; and
elsewhere); The Journal of Post Captain
Nicolas Baudin translated by Christine
Cornell (Adelaide 1974); Leslie R.
Marchant France Australe (Perth 1982);
and T. M. Perry The Discovery of Aus-
tralia, the charts and maps of the naviga-
tors and explorers (Melbourne, 1982).

Subject covered
Re the article (B, July 24) under the
heading “Doing the right thing by
Napoleon”: It is indeed not surprising
that many Australians do not realise
that a French expedition ... charted this
coast since many Australians do not
bother with their own literature (or for
that matter anything else) but only trust
the imported variety.
In point of fact the subject of the
book about which John Stackhouse
writes was covered, probably much
more completely, two years earlier than
the book just published in London.
Its title was France Australe, covering
the years 1503 to 1826 and was written,
after years of research both here and in
France and elsewhere, by Professor
Leslie R. Marchant of the University of
Western Australia. Indeed it was con-
sidered so significant that French Am-
bassador Merimee came from Canberra
to Perth for its launching in the Art Gal-
lery of Western Australia on June 4
1982.

A different drummer
I read with much interest the poem by
Dean Kiley (B, July 17), which was
quite good as he went about to define
poetry in his witty verses after reading
poems in the literary pages of The Bul-
letin.
He felt that you would have to ex-
plain to the poets of your supplement
(of which I was not one) the words
“rhythm,” “rhyme” and “theme” stating


Why did these
nice companiesgo
oil the way
on their first
date with an
NEC computer?
They talk about it a lot between
themselves those that have and
those that haven’t.
But even in this liberated age we
live in there are still many who stop
short of going all the way; who
believe the standards that were good
enough for their parents are good
enough for them.
Those that feel uncomfortable at
the mention of words like interface.
So, don’t blush to admit it. If
your company has stopped short of
embracing computer technology,
you’re in good company.
After all it’s simply good old
fashioned business principles
resisting the temptation to con-
summate a contract with the first
smooth talking computer salesman
who promises to move the earth
for you.
In fact there are plenty of
computer companies who seem
scarcely ready for a stable relat-
ionship. And give the distinct
impression it was only yesterday they
were hanging round fun parlours
playing with Space Invaders.
With NEC it’s different.
Which is why so many nice
companies choose the NEC Astra the
first time they go all the way with
computers.
Japan’s number one selling
mini-computer has all the maturity
and good manners of a tried and
true system that can make the tran-
sition to computerisation a gentle
awakening to a new world of
exciting possibilities. Not a rude
disillusionment.
And Astra never demands a total
commitment from the very first time.
It gives you room to let the relat-
ionship grow. From the simplicity
of the single terminal Astra 25,
through the 45, the 65 and the 85.
Blossoming into the magnificence
of the Astra 100, the powerful mul-
ti-terminal mini-computer that
promises fulfilment for the needs of
the largest companies.
Just ask these nice companies
who weren’t afraid to go all the way
with NEC’s Astra.
Jim Scott won’t be bashful
revealing how Astra streamlined
operations for Burns Philp Steel in
Salisbury, Queensland, speeding up
order processing in the competitive
steel supply business and allow-
ing tight economical control of
inventory and accounting.
Richard Hamilton-Irvine of
Irvines can tell you how important it
is to have a happy uncomplicated
working relationship when you
spend your life together on a small
tropical island like Norfolk managing
a Hotel and a duty free store.
John Swainton of Maxwell
Optical Industries, Pyrmont, wasn’t
looking through rose coloured
glasses when they installed an Astra
to focus operations in their business
importing and distributing Nikon
Photographic Equipment.
Donn Hely from Dependable
Mailing Service has the direct
approach, but with a difference;
the difference being an Astra.
He knows the Astra will definitely
get the mail out.
There was no room for
romancing when John Foley of the
Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria
told NEC that a little housekeeping
money had to stretch a long way in
the fund raising business.
In today’s world there has to be a
first time for every company. And it’s
going to effect your feelings for
computers for the rest of your life.
When the time comes, make it
with NEC Astra and you won’t be
disappointed.

WHAT EVERY COMPANY NEEDS: HIGH POWERED
Owning a new Peugeot
Executive is no guarantee of
a seat on the board. But it
certainly tells everyone you
mean business.
The 2.2 litre fuel injected
engine gets you from 0-100 in
just 10.5 seconds.
The dual circuit four wheel
disc brakes do as they're told
under any conditions.
And the Michelin TRX tyres
don’t answer back when you
take a tight corner.
The Executive looks smart.
It's available in two tone metallic
paintwork. Silver on grey. Or
blue on grey.
The windows are tinted.
The surrounds are black.
The boot lid has a chunky
spoiler that gives you greater
traction. And greater attraction.
The interior of the
Executive is as well-planned as
a well-run office.
The Peugeot boffins
discovered that a seat crafted
entirely from polymerized foam
needed no springs at all. You sit
in the seat. Not on the seat.
The covering is soft velour
tailored in dark blue with
adjustable headrests, front
and rear.
Like your office, the
Executive is air-conditioned.
Unlike your office, the
Executive has a touch-sensitive
AM/FM stereo radio/cassette.
Every window is electrically
operated. The doors have
central locking.
And every feature of the
Peugeot Executive is standard.
The only executive
decision you need to make is:
automatic or manual,
And you can do that at
your nearest Peugeot dealer.
Or write for a free facts folder.

these three elements were necessary for
a poem to be credible.
What untruths. I am an author and
poet, who keeps abreast with move-
ments in the literature world. Dean
seems to be living in the dark ages,
sleeping through the poetry renaissance
which began some 30 years ago and
continues to this very day. It began in
the early 1950 s in America in San Fran-
cisco with Jack Kerouac and his beat
poets, including Allen Ginsberg, who is
presently lecturing in the Poetics De-
partment at the Naropa Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
The renaissance began in America
and spread to the rest of the world in
due course which revolutionised poetry
and writing style, and today we call it
modern poetry and it takes all forms
and shapes.
Throughout their endeavors Kerouac
and Ginsberg did not once try to define
poetry; instead they read their poetry to
the world. It was a statement in itself.
Poetry has no definition because it is
spontaneous, it is the beating heart and
soul of every man, woman and child,
who are born poets in their own right.
There are no rules to poetry. No bound-
aries. It is free self-expression which
flows from within. That is what poetry is
all about and it would appear that Dean
is unable to accept the fact that we all
beat to a different tune.

Sensible approach
The Wildcat column took a sensible ap-
proach to West Australian Opposition
leader Bill Hassell’s wilder claims on
Aboriginal land rights when it said they
should be treated warily.
Analysis of Hassell’s major objec-
tions to land rights reveals they are
based on the Fraser Government’s
Northern Territory legislation and the
discussion paper published in January
by the commissioner of the West Aus-
tralian Aboriginal land inquiry, Mr
Paul Seaman, QC.
The Northern Territory situation is
clear: Everybody including the Terri-
tory Government, the West Australian
Government and Mr Seaman has ack-
nowledged problems with the legisla-
tion as it effects mining.
The Territory Government has in-
formed the WA Government of a de-
tailed review it is making of this aspect.
Their review takes as its starting point
the criticisms made by Mr Seaman in
his discussion paper. That discussion
paper is just what it says it is a dis-
cussion paper written to identify the
major land rights issue and give the de-
bate direction and organisation. It does
not contain recommendations. Mr Sea-
man will advise the state government of
his findings in two months and we will
then be in a position to prepare legisla-
tion.
Mr Hassell’s nationwide campaign
to frighten people on this issue is a shal-
low and cynical vote-catching exercise.
After what have been at times heated
discussions, the Commonwealth has
acknowledged the significance of the
Seaman Inquiry and the Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding, has
said publicly that Mr Seaman’s work
will be needed in the preparation of fed-
eral legislation.
Mr Hassell’s federal colleagues now
face their moment of truth as he asks
them to abandon long standing bi-parti-
san policies of goodwill towards Abor-’
iginal people.

f your milk.
The plastic milk bottle has benefits for everybody; manufacturers,
dairies and consumers alike.
Switching to plastic milk bottles would save the country an
estimated $6O million annually spent on importing paperboard from
Scandinavia and U.S.A. for use in carton manufacture.
A plastic milk bottle is resealable, leakproof and because of its
handle, easier to pour. It cannot taint the milk in any way
Dairies enjoy greater flexibility of packaging with plastic
bottles because the one container can serve as the pack for all the
different types and flavours of milk with the simple addition of the
appropriate labels.
Hoechst's high density polyethylene, Hostalen, is the raw material
from which plastic bottles are made.
Hostalen is ideally suited for this purpose because of its
comparatively low cost, and good impact strength over a range of
temperatures.
So milk bottles made from Hostalen can give us more cream
all round.
In Australia, and on four other continents, Hoechst technology and
innovation in plastics are producing better products for a better
standard of living.

Subtle discrimination
I have read and re-read the article,
“What Indonesia thinks of us” (B, July
24). I was trying to understand just what
the writer would have Australians do.
Let me summarise my findings.
We should adjust to take account of
Asian ways of thinking. (In a nonsense
parenthesis Professor Mackie suggests
the Indonesians need to do this, too.
Are they not already Asian?) Austra-
lians should not call spades “spades,”
nor murder “murder.” Why not? Some
feelings might get hurt! If we ask those
who command the instruments of viol-
ence to stop hurting human bodies, their
feelings will be hurt. If we persist then
we, in Australia, will have to bear the
terrible consequence of isolation.
Is this what Mackie means? What-
ever his intention, this is pernicious
folly.
Underlying the professor’s proposal
there seems a subtle form of discrimina-
tion. In Mackie’s scales, the deaths of
unknown Indonesians weigh not so
heavily as General Moerdani’s sensitiv-
ity. This provokes me to ask him: does
an Asian not have eyes, hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, life and
the desire to live? Is he not hurt by the
same weapons, susceptible to the same
hungers, driven by the same aspirations,
vulnerable to the same mortality as is an
Australian? If he is stabbed, will he not
bleed? If he is bludgeoned, will he not
drop? And if shot through and through,
will he not die? Shakespeare asked
this better, of course, but then Professor
Mackie improves on Shakespeare, too.
In Henry V, it was the Dauphin who
sent the tennis balls. Has Professor
Mackie got things the wrong way round,
perhaps?
“More could be said on both sides
about the rights and wrongs of Indo-
nesia’s takeover of East Timor.” So
Mackie writes. What, I wonder, could
be said about the rights? In internation-
al law, the takeover itself has no validi-
ty. It is void. Hitler’s incorporation of
Czechoslovakia stood, I think, on slight-
ly better grounds. Yet some of those
same Indonesians who call Australians
arrogant simply ignore the rule of law.
Their adverse judgment does not worry
me. I would rather win approval from
Haji Prinsen, a Jakarta civil rights cam-
paigner, who asked Australians to pro-
test. He and his brave friends are con-
stantly in danger of reprisal. We here
can speak out safely. And maybe it will
help.
Against that possibility we should
ask ourselves two questions: Will the re-
straint which Mackie urges do any
single thing to make the suffering less?
Will our silence on malign misuse of
power be taken for approval? Unless
Australians can answer the first with
positive assurance and the second in the
negative, they ought to ignore the advice
of Professor Mackie.

Adelaide
How much further will your life go
in South Australia?
South Australia is a very healthy place to live, work and play. Take a simple thing like the air we breathe. Adelaide
has virtually no measurable smog. In Sydney, however, air pollution levels regularly reach ‘smog’ proportions.
That’s a breath of fresh air for people who like cities, but don’t like the health risks.
Of course Adelaide offers an environment that is very healthy too. It’s a city that is almost over-crowded with
parklands, beaches and glorious unspoilt hills areas that
are only minutes from the city centre.
And it’s a very safe place to live. You’re less likely
to have a road accident. Get mugged. Or have your
house broken into.
South Australia is a great place to bring up kids.
Start a business. Or just simply live in.
South Australians have been keeping the good
things to themselves for far too long.
Now the secret is out.

Rival 4 cylinder two litre engine at 2500 rpm.
A martini may be improved by being
shaken. But drivers and passengers
seldom are.
BMW insists on using six cylinders in
engines of 2 litres and over. But most
other luxury car makers still persist with
four or five cylinders, despite the laws of
physics which decree that engines of
less than six cylinders can never be
perfectly balanced.
A four cylinder engine will have up to
10 times more vibration than a six
cylinder engine. And a four cylinder car
engine can transmit three times more
vibrations to the passenger compartment.
In a BMW however, you will feel
fewer vibrations than if you were sitting
in an eight cylinder car.
To improve this smoothness even
further, each cylinder has its own
counterweight. Some other cars only
have one counterweight to balance
several cylinders.
When you drive the BMW 323 i for
example, you will be surprised at the
uncanny quiet but effortless acceler-
ation of its electronically fuel injected six.
And when you fill up with petrol you
will be pleasantly surprised at how
economical six cylinders can be, when
combined with energy-saving computer
electronics like a fuel cut-off system.
BMW believes that, if you are to
build the most sophisticated and refined
car in the world, the last place for
compromise is the engine. And if other
manufacturers are prepared to com-
promise on this the most important part
of the car, where will they stop?

July 24) Professor J. A. C. Mackie com-
mented that from the Jakarta perspec-
tive Australia is “still seen as white
and alien to Asia.” Might I add that the
ethnocentric Indonesian leadership
holds a similar view of the Melanesians
of Irian Jaya that they are black and
alien to Asia. As a result they have been
treated as second-class citizens, not only
in Indonesia at large but in their own
land, West Papua, as well.
In turn, the Melanesians regard the
Indonesian administration as alien to
the South Pacific, within which region’s
cultural boundaries the island of New
Guinea lies. Thus it is not surprising
that the two races should be in conflict.
Professor Mackie suggested that
“many Indonesians” have come to be-
lieve due to government propaganda,
apparently that Australians are “med-
dling improperly” in the matters of East
Timor and Irian Jaya. Firstly, I would
contend that most Timorese and
“Irianese” welcome the spotlight being
directed from Australia on human
rights abuses in their homelands. The
same goes for many Indonesians in Java
etc, which accounts for the popularity
of Radio Australia’s broadcasts.
Secondly, I believe that the In-
donesian media should be encouraged
to “meddle” similarly in the Aboriginal
situation here, which is seen to be Aus-
tralia’s weak point. As long as the re-
ports were true which I feel is the case
with most Australian coverage of In-
donesian affairs the resulting overseas
pressure would only further support the
initiatives being taken by the relevant
ALP minister, Mr Holding.
The debate over indigenous peoples’
rights, whether here or in Indonesia,
should be brought into the open. It must
not be submerged on such spurious
grounds as Australians having different
“mental and cultural” attitudes to In-
donesians. The essence of the matter is
“Neville agreed to settle out of court.”
politics, which in Indonesia’s case
means an unrepresentative regime pur-
suing widely unpopular policies.
Increasingly, Indonesians are
making their beliefs known. If they can-
not do so in their own country, it is logi-
cal that Australia would be seen as one
place where the flame of truth may
glow. Australian journalists, and other
observers, will continue to publicise
Jakarta’s excesses, should they see proof
of their occurring.
That a well-known academic can
suggest acquiescing in the cover-up is
most distressing.

Crying for change
I was interested in Anthony Hill’s
article (B, July 17) concerning the latest
handicapped programs review. He high-
lighted the problems of sheltered work-
shops and mentioned not at all two
areas, which to me, are crying out for
change.
I am concerned about the time pro-
fessional people associated with special
education have to spend in fund-rais-
ing, thus taking up their time and energy
away from the children in their care. My
staff give up hours of their time in order
to maintain the standard we have set for
ourselves.
My second area of concern is in-
dicated by the heading “health” under
which the article is written. Until the
governments, both federal and state, be-
gin to look at the conglomeration of ar-
chaic acts under which they operate, the
handicapped will always suffer. Many
handicapped people are not sick, yet
those caring for them are forced to do so
under a medical model. Voluntary or-
ganisations are confused and maddened
by having to deal with four to five differ-
ent government departments Social
Security, Health, Education and even
the fire brigade in order to provide a
simple service.

To succeed in today’s fickle

with a ‘woolly’ positioning, or those that try to be all beans
to all people, are very likely to fail.
In these exacting conditions it is vital to determine
exactly how well all the marketing elements really do work
together before major financial and physical resources are
risked in a full scale launch.
The only way to reduce this risk to manageable
proportions is to put the product
into an ideal test market like
Adelaide, where consumers can
vote with their hip pockets. Using
Adelaide’s unique test market
measurement facilities, your
company can now monitor results
very accurately, allowing you to
make any necessary adjustments
before you commit to a full scale
launch.

OLYMPIC ACTION
No love festival at the Mickey Mouse Games
THE SUN shone on the
bright green, freshly-painted
grass, the smog lifted and
rocket man flew into the Los
Angeles Coliseum to launch
the 1984 Olympic Games. The
traffic snarled but in the city
that has been described as the
biggest parking lot in the
world this was only to be ex-
pected.
The 7800 athletes who had
been out of sight behind their
3m-high barbed wire fences
emerged to take centre stage.
Darren Clark, Ken Lorraway,
Ric Mitchell, Lisa Martin,
Mary Decker and Alberto
Salazar were exceptions
saving themselves for greater
efforts later this week.
“You can tell it’s not going
to be a love festival,” said one
LA resident surveying the
fences surrounding the Olym-
pic Village at the University
of Southern California. “It’s
the closest thing I’ve seen to
the Berlin Wall.” Dogs and
cops and feds are everywhere,
and girls in khaki with pistols
and batons on their hips, but
at least there aren’t any ma-
chine guns in sight as there
were at the Winter Olympics
in Sarajevo and the Pan Am-
erican Games in Venezuela.
And the bomb-stopping
robots are being kept taste-
fully under cover.
“There is nothing as big as
this except maybe D-Day,”
said the producer of the open-
ing entertainment extrava-
ganza, David Wolper. (Frank
Sinatra refused to go because
it was bigger than he was, said
one of the Hollywood crowd.)
Like D-Day there were
casualties. The President,
well-hidden behind bullet-
proof glass, seemed to fluff his
opening lines but local papers
have graciously suggested that
he simply rearranged them.
The United States athlete
Edwin Moses, who gave the
Olympic Oath, forgot his. “In
the true spirt of sportsman-
ship ... in the true spirit of
sportsmanship ... in the true
spirit of sportsmanship . . .”
93,000 who could read the
words of the oath on the giant
screen willed him to remem-
Equestrian Wayne Roycroft leads the Australian team
ber the final 11 words ... “for
the glory of sport and the hon-
or of our teams.” An earlier
casualty was Bomber, the
Alaskan bald eagle, which
was to have taken part in the
opening ceremonies but died
of smog-induced stress during
a training session. The Libyan
team was another late casu-
alty and two Canadian
weightlifters who failed their
doping tests for steroids. Bal-
loons released at the Coliseum
hit power lines and blacked
out a dozen suburbs.
The 589-strong United
States team got the most ap-
plause followed by the “good
commie” teams of Romania
and China. After the home
team, Romania and Australia
are tipped to be the biggest
medal winners. The Austra-
lians looked good the
women in yellow dresses, men
in their khaki shirts and trou-
sers and wide-brimmed hats
looking like Northern Terri-
tory policemen. From high up
in the bleachers you merciful-
ly couldn’t see the koalas,
kookaburras and emus.
Through the fieldglasses
you could see Grant Kenny’s
kookaburra wrestling with
Australia’s 100m breaststroke bronze medallist Peter Evans
Lisa Curry’s koala. However,
this is no place to knock ko-
alas. In a city where just about
everybody is collecting pins a
koala has been known to fetch
as high as $5O. Ask a police-
man for help and he will ask
you for a pin. Among the par-
ading athletes, Bahrain, in fire
engine red robes, and Ber-
muda, in black blazers and
yellow bermuda shorts, got
best-dressed awards and the
Japanese were, not sur-
prisingly, the best drilled.
The crowd that watched
the opening ceremony was
curiously subdued. Many
spent the first hour recovering
from the trauma of finding
their seats. Inside the Coli-
seum organisation was woeful
and crowd handling chaotic.
There was near panic as
people shoved and jostled and
called to each other “to hold
the line.” There can be no
sound more shrill than that of
a near-hysterical American
woman. The thousands of se-
curity officials seemed power-
less to create order. Not for
nothing are these also known
as the Mickey Mouse Games.
Suggestions that everything
was much better organised in
Moscow do not create friend-
ly relations. “The Olympics
the Soviets tried to strangle in
their crib are crawling and
walking,” wrote Jim Murray


of The Los Angeles Times.
“The Olympics they said were
too commercial are being
done with as much taste as a
High Mass.” He was very,
very serious.
The choice of Jesse Owen’s
granddaughter Gina Hemp-
hill and decathlon gold med-
allist Rafer Johnson as the fi-
nal torch-bearers ended all the
guessing competitions that
had Pia Zadora, Michael
Jackson and the de-throned
Miss America as starters.
( Penthouse, featuring the nude
Miss America pictures, is out-
selling Sports Illustrated by
100 to one).
Smog, or unhealthful air
quality, as the weather fore-
casters prefer to say, has not
yet proved a problem. Articles
in the Soviet press have sug-
gested that the horses in the
equestrian events might need
to wear gas masks. Athletes
are reported to have trained
for Los Angeles by running
behind buses in their home
countries.
“Smog? I’m not worried
about it at all,” said a yellow-
blazered Rob de Castella be-
fore departing the Olympic
Village to fly north to a secret
and sweeter training area. “I
enjoy the atmosphere of the
village but it would be detri-
mental to live and train here.
With the excitement and the
atmosphere here you’d find
yourself emotionally and
mentally drained by the time
you got to the starting line.”
Asked how he would
handle the smog, the confi-
dent and very relaxed looking
de Castella said “better than
anyone else.” His main con-
cern was about “just staying
on my feet.” And he said there
were about a dozen who could
win the race.
The competition at the
Olympics is by no means re-
stricted to the athletes. The
athletes are outnumbered by
the press. Their access to each
other is severely restricted and
some pressmen find them-
selves more restricted than
others. Relations between the
Australian Nine and Ten net-
work teams have worsened
The Games rocketman flies in to launch proceedings
considerably. Very few passes
are issued to journalists want-
ing to interview athletes in
their villages. Most go to
Murdoch-controlled media.
Venue sites are up to 300 km
apart. Journalists covering the
rowing have to resign them-
selves to spending seven hours
a day in buses. For a week The
Border Mail has been hot on
the trail of two cyclists from
Wangaratta, Dean Woods
and Glenn Clarke, but has
still not sighted them. Reports
from team coaches about the
athletes have mainly con-
cerned birthday celebrations
and the giving to the birthday
celebrant of a commemora-
tive silver dollar worth $32.
“It’s the closest most of them
are going to get to any sort of
medal,” observed one sports
writer sourly.
The disappearances of
women athletes from the
Olympic villages will not be
announced. Results of the sex
tests that all women except the
equestriennes must undergo
are to be kept secret “out of
respect for the rights of the in-
dividual.” Prince Alexander
de Merode of Belgium, a
member of the International
Olympic Committee, said the
whole procedure was being
conducted in absolute secret.
Those who failed the
chromosome test on cells
scraped from the inside of the
mouth would quietly disap-
pear from the games without
publicity. “The shock of dis-
covering a sexual abnormality
would be serious enough to
the individual concerned,” he
said. “It would be scandalous
if we added to the human
suffering of such an event by
publicising it.” Men claiming
to be women have won gold
medals in earlier Olympics.
Prince Alexander is by no
means the only prince at the
Games. Prince Albert of Mon-
aco is here, Prince Philip is ex-
pected and four Saudi
Arabian princes, including
Prince Sultan bin Salman,
arrived to cheer on the Saudi
soccer team. The princesses
have included Anne and
Marie-Gabrielle De Lobko-
wicz. The party circuit has
been described as being “on
overload.” Among the local
partygoers: Jane Fonda,
Gregory Peck, Esther Wil-
liams and Brooke Shields.
Last week a local radio station
announced three cases of bu-
bonic plague had been dis-
covered in Los Angeles but
everyone has sensibly ignored
this.
People who had paid $2OO
for their tickets and $lOO for
special bus transport found
that their buses couldn’t get
near the Coliseum. After long
walks in the hot sun, past
street vendors selling every-
thing from homemade lemon-
ade to carpets featuring the
Virgin Mary, they found
themselves in a human bottle-
neck inside the stadium.
Women fainted in the crush.
You couldn’t get to the Red
Cross station even if you
wanted to. At the worst stage,
a bomb-stopping robot
couldn’t have got through.
Everyone had to pass a very
thorough security check one
woman handed over a large
plastic bag with the warning
“hey, that’s ice.” After the cer-
emony the crush was almost
as bad. Pressmen waited up to
three hours for the battered
yellow school buses that are
serving as press buses. This is
the no frills Olympics. □

AUSTRALIA
Young’s future hangs
on a telephone call
Mick Young, the accident-prone Special Minister of State, faces an inquiry into
what has been labelled the Paddington Bear Affair. RICHARD FARMER reports
that the outcome of that inquiry could depend on the content of one telephone conversation.
THE POLITICAL future of Special
Minister of State Mick Young hangs on
what a special inquiry set up by Prime
Minister Bob Hawke finds about a con-
versation between one of Young’s
secretaries and a Customs officer.
The nature of this conversation, and
the degree to which the secretary was
speaking on behalf of Young, will be
the crucial points in the inquiry.
It was the Customs officer’s disclo-
sure of that conversation that led last
week to Hawke appointing Michael
Black QC to carry out the investigation.
Young made no mention of the role
of his secretary when giving his version
of the events that involved him in
making an incorrect declaration to Cus-
toms when returning to Australia from a
conference in London. When Hawke
became aware that there might have
been an attempt to have Young’s origin-
al declaration replaced by a second cor-
rected one he believed there was no op-
tion but to have an independent in-
quiry.
Young, for his part, continues to
maintain that he has stated accurately
what happened, He denies any attempt
to make a second Customs declaration.
Presumably Black will have to deter-
mine whether Young’s staff member did
have the conversation as reported by the
Customs officer and whether, if she did,
she was acting on Young’s behalf.
Young’s fate appears to hang on that
simple matter of fact.
In hard political terms, the govern-
ment undoubtedly would be best served
by Young not returning to active duty in
the cabinet. The Paddington Bear Affair
has been a godsend for the Opposition.
Both Liberal leader Andrew Peacock
and his deputy John Howard have
seized on the issue with gusto. At a time
when the economic news for the govern-
ment could hardly be better, the propri-
ety of keeping as a minister a man who
admits breaking the Customs law has
enabled Peacock and Howard to go on
the attack.
It is the first time since the Combe-
Ivanov affair last year in which
Young, once again, was a featured
player that the Opposition has had
the government on the defensive. The
tabling of Black’s report when parlia-
ment meets in three weeks will enable
the Opposition to continue the pressure
in a way that will obscure the economic
issues that Hawke wants to highlight in
the run-up to his early election.
Peacock already has raised the
spectre of a Senate inquiry and that
really would be an irritant for the gov-
ernment. A committee of senators on
which the Liberals, Nationals and
Democrats had a majority would ensure
that debate about Young’s actions
would go on until the end of the year.


Normally allegations of political
scandal take a long time to sink into the
public consciousness. The reaction to
Young’s problems probably has not
done any great electoral damage so far.
The presence of a Paddington Bear
among the items contained in the lug-
gage Young sent home as unaccompan-
ied baggage for his wife and her sister
has tended to trivialise the incident. But
in the months ahead the Opposition
should be able to re-focus attention on
the matters of principle involved.
Sacking Young as Special Minister
of State would put an end to the possi-
bility of damaging electoral conse-
quences. Hawke seems well aware of
that and the firmness of some of his
comments leaves little doubt that his
friend will have to get a clean bill of
health from the Black inquiry.
“There must be a clear exoneration,”
Hawke said in a television interview at
the weekend. “I mean I obviously can’t
go into all the details that have to be
examined by Mr Black. But there al-
ready is the case that in regard to one
matter that has been canvassed in the
press ... that is in regard to ... a pos-
sible second Customs form from ... Mr
Young has clearly repudiated to the
leadership of the party that any such
thing occurred.”
Hawke believes that the standards by
which Young will have to live are the
standards which he set himself in a
speech to parliament in 1982 on the
non-payment of duty on a color TV set
by then Health Minister Michael
MacKellar. Young said then: “Nothing
is more important than the way in which
these people who are called ministers
behave themselves and set an example
to other people in Australia.”
By those standards a case could be
made as the Opposition has been do-
ing that Hawke should not have kept
Young in the ministry even after receiv-
ing an initial report from Industry and
Commerce Minister John Button that
the case had been treated in the normal
manner by his department and that no
further action was needed. That Hawke
chose to accept Button’s report reflects a
genuine desire by him not to be too
harsh on his colleagues.
It reflects as well the desire to avoid
inflaming the tensions between the
different factions within his govern-
ment. Young is a key person in the
Centre Left and his dismissal would re-
duce their influence. The initial reaction
of the Centre Left ministers was to sup-
port Young and that support increased
when a news agency reported in-
correctly that Young was about to re-
sign after Button reported his new infor-
mation to Hawke.

Mick, morals and Paddington Bear

THE MOST dangerous position to oc-
cupy in politics is the high moral
ground.
The perils of Mick Young are a per-
fect illustration. Young is a good-
hearted, knockabout lad whose con-
siderable intelligence and ability are
leavened by more than a touch of
larrikinism.
He could be portrayed as an arche-
typal Ocker, and the fact that he was
caught importing a few gifts on behalf
of his wife (a crime most Australian
travellers have committed at some time)
only reinforces that image.
The resulting brouhaha in Canberra
has contained a great deal of hypocrisy
and pomposity.
Politicians do not suddenly become
sanctified when they enter parliament: it
is in fact reassuring that they remain of
the same flesh as the rest of us, and sub-
ject to the same failings.
There must have been dozens of
other Australians at Mascot on July 5
fudging their Customs declarations, wit-
tingly or unwittingly, in the same
fashion as Young.
Politicians are elected to defend the
realm, maintain a sound currency and
protect the widow and orphan. It is ar-
guable that no Australian government
has managed to achieve any of these
aims in the past 15 years. Certainly
these are the kinds of issues upon which
governments should tremble and minis-
ters be sacked rather than some trifling
issue such as a few hundred dollars
worth of Customs duty.
This would make an excellent de-
fence for Young if it were not for the
fact that Young himself has written the
rules on this issue.
In the equally pompous debate over
the affair of Michael MacKellar’s color
television in 1982, Young said:
“Nothing is more important than the
way in which these people who are
called ministers behave themselves and
set an example to other people in Aus-
tralia.”
This is the sort of stuff that passes for
serious debate in our national parlia-
ment. And now Young, the most acci-
dent-prone of Hawke’s ministers, has
been hoist on his own petar indeed.
The best grounds, indeed, for sack-
ing Young are that he would then stand
as a warning of the folly of throwing
stones while living in a political
glasshouse.
It might get some of the pomposity
out of our political debate and ensure
that politicians spend more time on the
serious issues that confront the nation,
and less on the dutiable value of Pad-
dington Bear. □


not seem to be the same passion in the
defence of Young.
Hawke also suffers from not being a
free agent when it comes to dismissing a
minister. That job must be done by the
four parliamentary leaders together. If
the leadership gets out of line with the
feeling of the rank and file parliamen-
tary membership, there is the possibility
of a sacked minister being re-elected im-
mediately afterwards by caucus ballot.
It was to avoid that humiliation that
Hawke allowed Young back into the
cabinet last year despite a critical
finding about Young by Mr Justice
Hope over the disclosure of security in-
formation in the Combe-Ivanov affair.
This restraint still applies and while
Hawke might maintain that a complete
exoneration of Young by Black is neces-
sary, it is not certain how his party will
interpret those words. It certainly makes
things messy for the Prime Minister.
To date Hawke has avoided any
major reverses at the hands of caucus of
the kind that so weakened the adminis-
tration of Gough Whitlam a decade ago.
To get a rebuff over this incident would
do more damage to the government
than continued public criticism for
keeping Young in the ministry.
Providing that the Black report sup-
ports Young in maintaining that his sec-
retary acted without his knowledge in
suggesting that a second Customs form
be filled in, then it is Young’s popularity
among MPs that will do most to save
him. There is no better numbers man in
the party and some members of the
Centre Left still see keeping Young in
his job as the first major parliamentary
test of their faction’s strength. □
SECURITY
ASIO facing grave ‘mole’ peril
Australia’s security services have hit another rocky patch with the most recent
turbulence caused by a former British spy-catcher’s allegations, as JOHN
STACKHOUSE reports. Meanwhile, RICHARD FARMER tells of industrial
discord within ASIO and a likely shake-up for our overseas intelligence analysts.
THE RUSSIANS had a spy in Austra-
lian security intelligence in the latter
part of World War II and possibly the
months afterwards. Australia’s Labor
government of the day was aware of
leaks and almost certainly of the pres-
ence of a traitor of which the British
by this time had learned from “secret
sources.”
As a result, prime minister Ben
Chifley fired the Australian Security
Service (which was linked with the
Commonwealth Police). Ministers and
influential public servants were wary
about entrusting security to the military
which had a highly developed counter-
intelligence service at the end of the
war.
Under pressure from the British, who
had officially warned that security
secrets were leaking from Australia,
Chifley and his advisers agreed to estab-
lish the Australian Security Intelligence
Organisation on the model of the British
MIS counter-intelligence service. Sitting
in on the meeting of the top-level coun-
cil at which this decision was adopted
was British MIS executive Roger Hollis.
These facts emerged last week in de-
velopments following the accusations
by former British MIS spy-catcher Peter
Wright, now living in Tasmania, that
the evidence pointed to Hollis being
yet another mole in the British security
services.
The Wright revelations led to a flurry
in Australia.
There is no evidence that Hollis had
a direct or lasting influence on ASIO or
appointed any of his people to the in-
fant organisation. However, ASIO in its
early days DID recruit a number of
British executives with an intelligence
background. Most of these came from
Peter Wright as seen by Ward O’Neill


India, which had just been
given its independence.
Australian operatives were
always unhappy about
them. Mostly the uneasi-
ness was not so much
about security but what a
former ASIO executive de-
scribes as the “bodyline”
factor the “cultural
cringe” of Australian
anglophiles of the day.
There are nagging
doubts in ASIO about
whether it has been in-
filtrated in the past. The
former executive says: “So many odd
things happened that couldn’t be ex-
plained. The big one was the discovery
(in 1962) of high-speed message senders
in Sydney and Adelaide. We had a big
operation to find the contact in Adel-
aide but it was a fiasco. Was it incompe-
tence on ASIO’s part? Was it the inter-
vention of the Commonwealth Police?
Or was it a malign influence in the or-
ganisation itself? This has been a long
and continuing debate and a de-
bilitating influence for years.”
Whatever the truth of that, there is a
fear that ASIO is in extreme danger of
infiltration now. It is undergoing a
physical and psychological upheaval.
On the one hand there have been the
clash with the Labor government, the
Sir Roger Hollis
UPI
David Combe episode and
the constant attacks by the
left wing. Then there has
been the attempt within the
Attorney-General’s depart-
ment to broaden the base
of ASIO by direct graduate
recruitment and in particu-
lar a decision to appoint
women to top jobs. Unless
positive security vetting is
insisted on, the chances of
infiltration by foreign
sources will widen greatly.
A final factor is the forth-
coming ASIO move to a
new building in Canberra, an upheaval
from its former Melbourne base to a
much smaller city.
The combination of these historic
facts with the contemporary pressures
on security and intelligence organisa-
tions in western, democratic cultures
highlights the warnings that Wright has
been sounding in weeks.
Wright, who left MIS in 1976 to join
his daughter and four grandchildren in
Tasmania, has been running a one-man
campaign to nail Hollis. Although the
former British intelligence chief is dead,
Wright believes that the Hollis case
underlines the weakness of the British
and, by extension, the Australian ap-
proach to internal security.
He emphasises that he has only a
peripheral knowledge of ASIO, al-
though he has had frequent contacts.
(Not the least of these was using
defector Vladimir Petrov as a valued
consultant. Petrov and other Russian
defectors translated for Wright a vital
memorandum which, he believes,
helped clinch the evidence that points to
Hollis.)
But Wright believes that the western
intelligence organisations have been
historically riddled with traitors. Like
The Bulletin’s Australian sources, he
sees the possibility of infiltration as like-
ly to take place again even at junior
levels.
The normal course of promotion and
the passage of years will, these pro-
fessionals believe, elevate “sleepers”
into positions where they could be
dangerous moles.
Wright is breaking the British Offi-
cial Secrets Act by completing a book at
the Arab horse stud he and his wife run
at the tiny village of Cygnet, south of
Hobart. He is doing so because he
believes we are approaching spy-catch-
ing from the wrong end.
According to Wright, the conven-
tional way to catch a spy in an intelli-
gence service is to look at the past and
investigate the person with the worst re-
cord of success. Wright says one of Brit-
ain’s most successful operators worked
on the theory of looking at the greatest
Angry agents seek a ‘golden handshake’
THE AUSTRALIAN Security Intelli-
gence Organisation is racked by an in-
dustrial dispute. Federal Attorney-Gen-
eral Gareth Evans has held talks with
agents unhappy that new appointments
have reduced their opportunities for
promotion. The agents, part of ASIO’s
old guard of investigators, feel that they
have been passed over unfairly in favor
of university graduates recruited since
the 1977 security service investigation
by Mr Justice Hope.
The ASIO staff association wants
Senator Evans to introduce a system of
voluntary early retirement for its dis-
gruntled members. The suggestion is
that those agents no longer happy get a
“golden handshake.” Evans has resisted
the idea.
What makes this industrial dispute
different from most is the way in which
news of it became public.
ASIO agents normally are reticent
about talking to journalists. But a story
appeared in the Sydney Sun-Herald
newspaper last month quoting ASIO
sources as saying their morale was so
Gareth Evans: resistance
low some even felt that the organisation
should be disbanded.
The incident which officers chose to
claim as “the last straw” perhaps gives a
clear illustration of why Hope believed
that ASIO needed some new members.
The morale problem came to a head be-
cause a senior officer, during a visit to
Germany, had sent home in a diplo-
matic bag a collection of book matches.
The matches, the disgruntled ASIO men
reported, could have ignited and
jeopardised the jumbo jet in which the
matches travelled. Yet this senior man
had been responsible for disciplining
some of their number for offences in-
volving use of the diplomatic courier
system which they considered to have
been far less serious.
In the subtle way of the intelligence
agent, the leak to the Sun-Herald made
no mention that the solution proposed
to the morale problem was that the dis-
gruntled may be bought off. But going
public was intended to prepare Evans
for the applications for severance pay.
Richard Farmer


number of failures in which an individ-
ual was involved. This, he will docu-
ment in his forthcoming book, led to a
major counter-intelligence coup against
the Russians.
It is also important, Wright believes,
to compartmentalise information on the
basic “need-to-know” principle so that
there are fewer opportunities of leaks
occurring.
Adherence to this principle, he will
also claim, forced the Russians in an-
other operation into sacrificing one of
their top clandestine operators. There is
evidence the Russians knew the spy was
about to be arrested. But, had they
acted, they would have pointed a finger
straight at Hollis allegedly in the
know and they wanted to protect him.
Wright believes that intelligence or-
ganisations should keep elaborate logs
of all operations, on computers. Ran-
dom checks then would show if an indi-
vidual’s propensity to failure was get-
ting to be over the odds. The knowl-
edge that such programs were being run
would be a powerful deterrent and
make the task of infiltrating much
harder.
When Wright and his wife, Lois,
came to Australia they brought with
them the nucleus of the Arab stud they
were running in Britain. They live some
40km from Hobart in a green valley
near the Huon estuary with 30 Arab
horses. They bought some 23 hectares of
a rundown property and have been
rebuilding fences, planting trees and
putting up a modern stable complex.
The stables are more modern than their
home, a former fodder shed, lined, in-
sulated and warmed by a fuel stove.
Lois keeps it going with wood from
groves which include two huge cypress
windbreaks shadowing the house.
In one of the small rooms is a wall
festooned with ribbons that their horses
have won at shows. A line of beer
bottles leads to the bathroom. Here
Wright brews his own beer, which he
shares with visitors.
Home brewing is an art that requires
meticulous attention to detail and rigid
hygiene, which metaphorically is com-
parable with cleaning out a suspect in-
telligence organisation.
“We had an infection here but we
were able to get rid of it,” Lois says.
Certainly the brew is not your average
sour-tasting, cloudy swill. It’s sharp, bit-
ter and very much to the palate. “It runs
to about 5 percent alcohol,” Wright
says. “I add extra sugar.”
Jolt likely for overseas intelligence analysts
A THOROUGH shake-up is expected
in the Office of National Assessments,
the country’s chief analyst of overseas
intelligence. Key government ministers
are unhappy with the quality of much of
the agency’s recent work. They believe
few of the high hopes held for it when it
was set up seven years ago have been
realised.
The choice facing the government is
either to up-grade ONA dramatically or
abolish it. The final decisions will de-
pend on the report of the Hope royal
commission into all Australia’s security
services. But, as ONA was created as a
result of Mr Justice Hope’s first report
in 1977, it is likely he will recommend
that it be considerably strengthened.
Ministers expect that Hope will
agree with them that ONA has done
little to fulfil its role of co-ordinating
international intelligence. Rivalries be-
tween the competing agencies continue
and it will be no surprise if Hope again
finds that they are “fragmented, poorly
co-ordinated and organised.”
The stage is certainly set for another
round of the bureaucratic infighting that
saw ONA emerge as an organisation
quite different from the one Hope orig-
inally recommended. As planned, ONA
was to break the stranglehold of the De-
fence and Foreign Affairs departments
on intelligence assessment.
Hope wanted ONA to take over
many of the functions of Defence’s
Joint Intelligence Organisation. JIO
stayed with Defence virtually unscathed
when then-prime minister Malcolm
Fraser bowed to departmental pressure
to leave things as they were.
Hope recommended that a senior
position in ONA be filled by a serving
military intelligence officer of at least
major-general rank. Other military offi-
cers were to be seconded to it. These
plans also fell victim to Defence depart-
ment jealousy. ONA has never had a
serving Defence officer on its staff, let
alone a senior one. The ability of the
office to report in a meaningful way on
military matters has been substantially
hampered. The Strategic and Inter-
national Policy Division of the Defence
department has thus, through superior
knowledge, maintained its predominant
position within the bureaucratic peck-
ing order.
Hope stressed and Fraser accepted
that assessments of international econ-
omic conditions should be a vital part
of ONA’s work. One of the two div-
isions of the office is concerned exclu-
sively with such matters. But, with only
a small staff, co-operation with the
major economic departments of
Treasury and Trade is vital for ONA.
Once again bureaucratic rivalries have
prevented the flow of information at the
high level that ONA needs. The Over-
seas Economic Relations Division of
Treasury feels little need to have its
views assessed by someone else. The
Energy Research and Development
Division of the Department of Re-
Malcolm Fraser: bowed to departmental pressure


It was this brew he was pictured sip-
ping on TV interviews.
Meanwhile, in Canberra, Bulletin
sources disclose that ASIO, along with
Britain’s MIS, is not prepared to accept
the Hollis allegations.
The line is that the evidence against
Hollis was not conclusive and hence it
has to be assumed that he was not a
traitor.
This was certainly so in Australia.
The Bulletin understands that Justice
Edward Woodward, when he was
named head of ASIO, called the senior
staff together and told them he had seen
the anti-Hollis evidence. Reportedly he
said: “In a court I would have to regard
the evidence as not proven and then
presume the innocence of Hollis.”
It is this attitude that Wright is cam-
paigning against. He believes the state
has a right to presume guilt, rather than
innocence in security matters.
This means that the individual
should be sacked when a reasonable
suspicion exists. According to Wright,
security organisations have ample secret
funds to handle this sort of problem.
The answer, he believes, is a generous
pay-off then out.
Otherwise, he says, the suspicion
lingers and there are investigations and
inquiries, none of which is ever conclu-
sive. The suspicions fester and, in the
end, it is as bad as if a genuine mole had
been at work.
The Bulletin’s ASIO sources speak of
the same debilitating atmosphere, of
people working alongside one another
and unable to trust one another.
On the evidence, Hollis’ influence in
ASIO was slight. The organisation
started with fewer than 20 staff in the
first year, then grew to 80 and expanded
to today’s 700 or so. But most of these
are clerks, typists or technicians hand-
ling routine work. The executive con-
sists of fewer than 50 people, probably
about 35. In any witchhunt, the finger
points at such people.
The logic seems to be on the Wright
side: if there is any suspicion, get rid of
the individual concerned and compen-
sate him or her.
Raising his glass of home brew and
pondering his 36 years as one of Brit-
ain’s top spy-catchers, Wright thought
over a traditional Australian remedy for
snakebite: If you’re bitten on a hand or
a foot, you hack it off. “Painful and
drastic,” he agreed. “But in security,
yes, you have no other option.” John
Stackhouse
sources and Energy has a
similar proprietorial view
about long-term develop-
ments in the resources
area. Trade also has not
seen providing informa-
tion for ONA as a high pri-
ority. There is a sense
among all these depart-
ments that ONA is a rival
in Canberra’s power game,
rather than an ally.
The Hope theory al-
ways was that ONA should
depend on other bodies for
much of its data. A trunc-
ated JIO was to be the
principal source of military
intelligence, having eval-
uated the raw data pro-
vided by the Defence Sig-
nals Division and by for-
eign intelligence services
such as the CIA. Foreign
Affairs was to help ONA
with its long-term assess-
ments with an evaluation
of material from the Aus-
tralian Secret Intelligence
Service and from its over-
seas missions. A National Assessment
Board, chaired by the director-general
of ONA and with representatives of all
the departments and organisations with
an interest in the subject being reported
on, was to meet before a final version
was sent to government.
Such long-term assessments have not
proved numerous. For, as well as pre-
paring considered views about likely
developments, ONA has to give the gov-
ernment a daily report on current intel-
ligence. The staff of the office is small
Mr Justice Hope: much depends on royal commission report
only about 35 analysts and giving de-
tails of “the war of the week” can be a
time-consuming task. Malcolm Fraser
as prime minister, perhaps more than
Bob Hawke, had a voracious appetite
for the latest news on the world’s
trouble spots.
There is little criticism from the cur-
rent government about this aspect of
ONA’s work. And there certainly does
seem to be much more co-operation be-
tween the various departments and spy
agencies and ONA on this daily basis
than when it comes to
long-term projects.
A more fundamental
criticism, which Hope is
likely to consider, is that
ONA is spreading its net
too widely. Some of its offi-
cers would like to see a
greater concentration on
assessments about the
Asian and Pacific region.
Reporting on trends in the
Soviet Union and eastern
Europe is, the argument
goes, of far less relevance
to Australia than analysing
what is happening in the
ASEAN countries and in
China and Japan.
Of more serious conse-
quence is the political cli-
mate in which ONA has to
operate. While both Hope
and Fraser said that ONA
should be free from exter-
nal pressures and direc-
tions, it hasn’t quite hap-
pened that way.
It's not that govern-
ments have tried to alter
the content of the ONA assessments.
But by publicly making known their dis-
agreements as Fraser did over Af-
ghanistan and Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden did this year over an assess-
ment of Soviet nuclear superiority - the
politicians inevitably affect the way the
reports are written. In the world cf bu-
reaucratic gamesmanship and influence,
it rarely pays to tell governments things
they don’t want to hear,
The problem for ONA has been the
perceptions of its work. In 1980, its re-


An Ansett Boeing 737 approaches the airstrip on Hamilton Island: an outer reef resort planned
port that the invasion of Afghanistan
was not a prelude to an invasion of Iran
led to claims that it had fallen under
“left-wing” influence. One former ana-
lyst ONA had “an appalling lack of se-
curity,” was “politically biased” and
was under “the dominance of the For-
eign Affairs-based clique.”
In a series of disasters that year, an
ASIO document, Threat to the Internal
Security of Australia, was accidentally
destroyed at ONA and Fraser publicly
rebuked two officers for helping to brief
then opposition leader Hayden for a
speech on the Afghanistan invasion.
The next year, director-general Bob
Furlonger left and was replaced by
Michael Cook who had been chief
executive on Fraser’s personal staff".
Some people in the present govern-
ment say ONA has fallen under “right-
wing” influence. They say acceptance of
Soviet nuclear superiority is evidence
ONA has “bought” the Reagan line.
While the Soviets may have superior-
ity in land-based intercontinental ballis-
tic missiles the argument against the
ONA assessment is that the United
States has much greater superiority in
submarine and bomber-launched mis-
siles.
It was an argument quoted ap-
provingly by Hayden this year and, by
effectively cutting the political ground
from beneath ONA in this key area, it
highlighted the dilemma facing all pub-
lic advisory institutions. If its reports
are ignored it loses influence. And if it
has no influence its reason for existence
is undermined.
This is why the reaction by the gov-
ernment to the forthcoming Hope re-
port will be crucial. It can turn ONA
into an effective and influential co-
ordinating body as Hope first intended.
If not, the government might as well dis-
pense with it. Either way, it promises to
be a major shakeout.

Big savings
in centenary
celebration
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
THE SEA and its service breed tra-
ditions but not necessarily conserva-
tism. At the age of 100, one of the
world’s great marine organisations is
plunging out to put into use the latest of
technologies to provide a service for
Australian trade not attempted before.
The Queensland Coast and Torres
Strait Pilot Service which dates its for-
mal origins to regulations gazetted on
August 5, 1884, will use its centenary to
announce provision of pilotage through
the recently discovered and difficult Hy-
drographer’s Passage which provides
direct access from the open Pacific to
Queensland’s coal ports of Hay Point
and Dalrymple Bay and allows bulk
coal carriers to save two days a voyage
on the round trip to Japan.
With modern bulk carriers per-
haps 100,000 tonnes or so days saved
mean big money. The cost of such a ship
can easily run to $30,000 a day. A
shorter routing gives Queensland coal a
price edge in the cut-throat energy mar-
ket.
The Royal Australian Navy’s hy-
drography service located and charted
the passage, completing the long task a
couple of years ago. The federal Depart-
ment of Transport is building lights to
mark its twists and turns. Now the pilots
are organising to have master mariners
available to con the ships through the
final stage in bringing the route through
the Barrier Reefs shoals into commer-
cial use.
It is the most ambitious venture the
pilots have tackled. Norman Rogers,
secretary to the service (which is a part-
nership of the active pilots), says that it
has decided to build and moor a heli-
copter pad in one of the lagoons of the
outer reef and use twin-engined heli-
copters to take the pilots from the main
base to the outpost and also to ships
approaching the passage entrance.
There will probably also be some
sort of floating accommodation located
in the lagoon, which could be the one
enclosed by Little Bugatti reef.
Little Bugatti (and another reef
under consideration, Snelgrove’s) is al-
most completely submerged. But the
horseshoe-shaped coral formations go
within a few centimetres of the surface
and are enough to break the force of the
waves sweeping in from the Coral Sea.
In this shelter, the pontoon and floating
cabins would lie on deeply-laid but flex-
ible moorings designed to ride out if
necessary even the force of cyclones.
Rogers is negotiating with three or-
ganisations for provision of the special-
ist helicopter services.
One of the contenders is Keith Wil-
liams, owner of the impressive Hamil-
ton Island tourist development about
120 km away in the Whitsunday Islands.
At the inauguration of Hamilton’s jet
airstrip recently by his partner, Ansett
Airlines, Williams announced plans to
build his own resort on the outer reef
and buy two Bell 212 helicopters to
ferry guests from Hamilton to the reef.
Williams said that he had commis-
sioned a 20-berth floating hotel from
NQEA in Cairns. Rogers said that Wil-
liams was one of the contenders but
would not say whether the proposed
outer reef resort was part of the pilots’
plans as well.
The other contenders are exclusively
helicopter operators, both foreign
groups with considerable experience in
flying and delivering pilots to ships in
the open ocean. That skill was rare and


essential if the new pilotage were to suc-
ceed, Rogers said.
Helicopters can land on the ap-
proaching ships most of the time, but
occasionally will have to winch pilots to
ships under way.
Williams, who also has long experi-
ence with helicopter work, holds a
trump card: Hamilton Island. He is in-
vesting about SIOO million to build a
resort for 2000 tourists in the middle of
the Whitsundays. With Ansett, which
has exclusive rights for five years, he has
built the 1824-metre jet strip which is
developed to the stage where it can
handle its flagships the Boeing 7675.
The direct Ansett flights from Syd-
ney and Brisbane would allow pilots to
fly in from the metropolitan centres,
board a waiting helicopter and be out at
either the reef base or aboard ship with-
in another 40 minutes.
Ansett is using Hamilton as the
spearhead of its drive to develop tour-
ism into tropical Queensland. The com-
pany’s Hayman Island resort is about
30km away and the airline soon will be
using a high-speed catamaran ferry to
take passengers from a berth alongside
the Hamilton airstrip to Hayman’s
wharf. The costly Sikorsky S6l helicop-
ters which have been servicing Hayman
from Proserpine on the mainland
eventually will be withdrawn and sold.
Ansett is jubilant that its twin strat-
egy of servicing the Whitsundays from
Proserpine and Hamilton will give it a
stranglehold on the fastest-growing seg-
ment of the Queensland coastal holiday
market. Backing up this judgment, the
airline is spending SSO million to up-
grade Hayman.
With the ability to market both
Hamilton and Hayman as resorts of
world class, Ansett will be stronger in
the Whitsundays than its rival TAA.
But TAA is striking back by empha-
sising its upper-market Dunk and
Bedarra resorts further north (with air
access via Townsville) and Keppel
Island, reached through Rockhampton.
It says that Keppel is one of the biggest
marketing success stories in the Queens-
land tourism business.
In the Whitsunday region, TAA has
focused on its big Airlie Beach develop-
ment on the mainland and has market-
ing agreements with other islands.
Behind the Queensland coastal
boom are three factors: Airline tour
marketers report a response to the
government campaign to holiday in
Australia which was launched by the
Paul Hogan ads. Then, the dwindling
Australian dollar has been making lo-
cals think twice about going overseas.
And, finally, the recent sudden cold
snap in Sydney and Melbourne saw the
image of tropical islands create a warm
glow in the hearts and minds of poten-
tial southern vacationers. □

Indonesia still

Jusuf Wanandi"... we have to get the Vietnamese out of their corner”
By DENIS REINHARDT
DESPITE a stinging rebuff of Austra-
lia’s Kampuchea initiatives at the
ASEAN foreign ministers summit in
Jakarta last month, Indonesian policy-
makers are hopeful that soon they may
be working with Australia to sponsor an
Indochinese peace settlement.
The result would be an improvement
in bilateral respect between Jakarta and
Canberra, despite recent friction over
East Timor. However, Foreign Minister
Bill Hayden will have to
play down his diplomacy
and not offend Indonesia’s
centre-stage aspirations.
He also will have to relin-
quish hopes of either
hosting or participating in
the first summit.
Despite differences of
emphasis between Indo-

Dr Mochtar-Kusumaat-
madja and armed forces
chief General Benny Mur-
dani, Indonesia is ready to
apply pressure to ASEAN
General Murdani
partner Thailand, one of the key oppo-
nents of an early diplomatic solution in
Indochina.
This would entail Thai acceptance of
the main thrust of the Hayden proposals
on Kampuchea: a regional summit fol-
lowed by full withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Kampuchea, in exchange
for a unified Kampuchean Government
probably led by elements of the present
Heng Samrin regime. This government
would not include the genocidal Pol Pot
but ASEAN would want to see Prince
Norodom Sihanouk participating.
In the trade-off for a Vietnamese
withdrawal, Thailand and to a lesser ex-
tent Singapore would have to stop cov-
ert military aid to opponents of the
Pnom Penh goverment.
The Indonesian position has been
spelt out to The Bulletin in a series of
remarkably frank inter-
views with high-ranking
Jakarta policy-makers and
advisers following a recent
seminar in Brisbane be-
tween officials from Aus-
tralia and Indonesia.
Jusuf Wanandi, execu-
tive director of the In-
donesian Government’s
think-tank, the Centre for
Strategic and International
Studies, said: “There are
some senior Indonesian
people who feel that Aus-
tralia is trespassing


diplomatically. But the Hayden propo-
sal is still on the table to be taken up by
the ASEAN foreign ministers. I don’t
see that it has been rejected.
“There is an awareness from both
Australia and Indonesia that we have to
get the Vietnamese out of their corner.”
In Jakarta circles, Wanandi’s views
are known to be favored by Mochtar,
who has been assessed by both Austra-
lian and Indonesian observers as giving
too much attention to the protestations
of the Thais and, in particular, Foreign
Minister Siddhi Savetsila’s views that
Vietnam cannot be trusted.
Savetsila and Singapore’s Foreign
Minister, Mr S. Dhanabalan, castigated
visiting Australian ministers late last
year, claiming Hayden was “trying to
bend over backwards to please Viet-
nam” following the first Hawke Gov-
ernment moves for a peace settlement.
A far more direct approach is taken
by Murdani, whose power base in In-
donesian politics far exceeds Mochtar’s
and who has been given the running on
Vietnam including talks in Hanoi
by President Suharto.
Murdani’s views are reflected by the
English-language Jakarta Post. Its chief
editor, Sabam Siagian, told The Bul-
letin: “We are running out of time. We
have to think how the situation will look
10 years from now. After 10 years
Hanoi will say to Jakarta: ‘You’re not a
friend if we haven’t done anything to
bring an end to it’.”
As revealed recently by
The Bulletin, Murdani once
formed a close relationship
with joint parliamentary for-
eign affairs and defence com-
mittee chairman, Bill Morri-
son, when the two were
stationed in Kuala Lumpur as
diplomats.
Morrison, who may yet be
posted to Jakarta in a move to
improve relations, said:
“Mochtar is running the
ASEAN line. But Murdani is
improving bilateral contacts
with Vietnam, perhaps as an
insurance policy for when
Vietnam comes back into the
international community.”
For Morrison, the message
from Jakarta to Canberra
over Kampuchea has been
simple. “They’ve expressed
the preference that they would
rather do the running.”
This is not exactly true, say
the Indonesians. Australia has
a fundamentally important
role as a trigger, albeit an un-
popular one with the Thais.
This is because Indonesia
must not be seen to betray
Thai interests for fear of
undermining ASEAN consen-
sus. There is a deadlock which Indo-
nesia, like Australia, wants to break.
Mr C. P. F. Luhulima, one of the key
Indonesian officials charged with devel-
oping options for dealing with ASEAN-
Kampuchea questions, asked: “Who is
going to make the first move? Vietnam
has proposed a conference between the
six ASEAN nations with Vietnam and
Laos but that has been rejected by Thai-
land and ASEAN, so the cards are now
in ASEAN hands and they have to
come again with a new proposal.
“The option for ASEAN is to try
out the Vietnamese proposal; to talk
with the Vietnamese. It is always the
Vietnamese foreign minister who is
travelling to ASEAN countries. The
best way is for other countries to per-
suade Thailand to try to sit down
together with Vietnam and Laos.
“What should be done is better co-
ordination between Australia and
ASEAN on what steps Australia can
take to soften the tensions between
ASEAN and Vietnam. Australia might
be able to help most in the process by
talking to Thailand,” Luhulima said.
The Australian trigger, according to
Siagian, is simple. Australia should jolt
Thailand to the negotiating table by
opening a direct aid program to Viet-
nam and Kampuchea.
“Your government should give aid
and disregard Thailand. Then they will
know how the game is played,” Siagian
said. □

FILM-MAKING
Vexed questions
on the bill for
top-level talks
By ANTHONY HILL
WHEN Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Exporters Association
of America, arrives in Australia next
month for talks with Home Affairs min-
ister Barry Cohen at least three key
topics will be raised:
■ Moves from within the Australian
Film Commission to impose a levy of
perhaps 10 percent on repatriated
profits from foreign films shown in Aus-
tralia. (An estimated $1 billion would be
going off-shore over the 10 years most
of it to the United States.)
■ Suggestions that the videos of suc-
cessful film be withheld for a specific
period up to 12 months has been men-
tioned to help cinemas arrest an audi-
ence deadline.
■ Attempts by the local industry to
secure greater distribution in the US
market.
With Americans able to spend up to
$5 million on a promotional launching,
the Australian industry cannot really
compete.
Despite some critical approval, only
about half-a-dozen Australian
films of recent years have had
reasonable box-office success
in the US. Many Australian
films have been limited to the
smaller “art” cinemas and one
thing Cohen will want from
Valenti is advice on how the
local product can achieve
greater penetration of cinema
chains.
The moves on a levy and
withholding of videos are
much more contentious.
Cohen has put them on the
backburner and is asking for
more facts and figures but
the US film industry already is
beginning to organise opposi-
tion.
A Canberra lobbying firm
Neilson McCarthy has
been retained to prepare a re-
port, due to be completed
soon. It is expected to argue
that such moves overseas have
had only limited effect. For
one thing, a “freeze” on
videos tends to open the mar-
ket for pirate versions; for an-
other, it is said that videos can
help attract audiences to the
cinema box-office.
On the other side, it’s ar

WHAT INITIATIVE,
HARD WORK AND
CONSENSUS HAVE
ACHIEVED.
if t
When Industry, Unions and Government
got together a little over a year ago, the message
was clear.
With consensus, hard work and bold
initiatives, we could return this country to a
healthy, stable condition, and keep it that way
The healthy profit just announced by
Australia’s BHP is tangible proof of it.
A year ago, our vital steel industry was
losing money at a rate which endangered its
long term viability.
With Government co-operation where it
was needed and justifiable, with constant
constructive dialogue between BHP and Unions,
and with BHP honouring its commitment by
investing funds and increasing efficiency, the
steel industry has made a very healthy turn
around.
BHP chose to have confidence when
global depression caused others to have doubts.
And not just in steel. Investments in oil
and gas, and mineral development have
continued to provide resources, income and
employment.
The acquisition of Utah International did
more than significantly reduce foreign
ownership in Australian resources.
It has given Australian business a louder
voice in the business capitals of the world. It has
opened the doors to broader earnings, new
technologies, new opportunities.
Importantly, the healthy condition of
Australia’s biggest company is a good thing for
many more Australians than those who work for
BHP, or have shares in it.
Through superannuation funds, life
policies, and many other investment forms,
millions more will benefit.
More importantly still, it’s a good
indicator of what initiative, hard work, sound
business and a commitment to the future can do
for the recovery of the Australian economy.
National confidence is growing, and
rightly so.
We can all share in that confidence.
BHP thanks its workforce, and the
unions of which so many are members.
BHP thanks all those who appreciate that
national well being is dependent on that of our
corporate citizens.
For its own part, ‘BHP is proud of the
tangible benefits of its commitment to Australia’s
future’.
It’s a pride all Australians can share.

gued that video market penetration in
Australia is now 30 percent and heading
for 50 percent by the end of next year.
Australian Film Commission chair-
man Phillip Adams says talks about a
voluntary code are proceeding but that
legislation may be recommended if that
can’t be worked out.
Imposition of a levy on repatriated
profits has won a groundswell of sup-
port within the local industry, although
moves for a 30 percent levy failed at the
ALP national conference. A levy of 10
percent is more likely and could yield
between $6 and $7 million this year. The
suggestion is that this money could be
used to make films directed at the over-
seas commercial market, freeing other
funds for more “art” movies.
Talks with the US industry are said
to have been “amicable.” There is no
suggestion yet of the Americans im-
posing a boycott in retaliation as has
occurred elsewhere.
Adams says only that he believes it
would be appropriate “for some mech-
anism to be set up” but others see many
problems ahead.
Would the levy apply to telemovies
and videos? And, given the costs of pro-
duction, would it apply to those films
which fail at the box-office. Industry
sources say that only one film in 20
shows a substantial return.
Cohen is not yet committing himself.
But he and Valenti clearly have a lot on
their agenda. □
RELIGION
The Philippines
rids itself of a
turbulent priest
By JAN MAYMAN
MEETING Father Brian Gore is like
encountering an early Christian. Mar-
tyrdom hovers in the air.
After having had dismissed charges
of murder and incitement to rebellion in
the Philippines, he made headlines at
his news conference in Perth with a cas-
ual reference to Aboriginal land rights
and the anti-nuclear movement.
Gore is a big, suntanned man, dark-
eyed and serious. At 39 he has the tough
self-assurance of a much older person.
He speaks thoughtfully:
“Hope this experience of mine can
somehow sharpen people’s feeling for
justice in other areas. It is easy to be
interested in something which is far
away but difficult when it is in your
backyard ...

Move over Turin,

Tokyo.

is
The areas of Turin, Milan and Modena, in Northern
Italy, have long been leading centres of high
performance automotive innovation. The home of such
legendary names as Ferrari, Maserati, Lancia, Alfa
Romeo, Bertone and Pininfarina.
New Toyota Supra is about to challenge such Euro-
pean exclusivity.
It has been described as the most exciting Toyota
ever, the flagship of Toyota technology, and with very
good reason.
Supra will be as impressive on our highways as it is on
an autostrada.
A welcome development from the Spartan style of
road warriors, to a luxury sports car that still has the iron
will of aSamurai withoutdenyingthe driveror passengers
their creature comforts.
SUPERLATIVE STYLING.
You simply have to look at Supra to see that it is a
super car.
The wedge-shaped styling literally slips through the
air. With wind resistance cut to a mere 0.35 drag co-
efficient (the same as a Porsche 944).
The retractable headlights, built-in driving lights,
bumper and air-scoop combine to present a picture of
aerodynamic efficiency and elegant design.
A LUXURY INTERIORTHAT IS ANYTHING
BUTSUPERFICIAL.
Sit inside and you enter a world like that of Luke
Skywalker, ready to win the ‘car wars'.
The instruments are completely digital. Concise and
easy to read. They feature a speed sensor, zone display
tachometer and fuel gauge, and a segmented water
temperature gauge.
Another impressive element is something the driver
will rarely look at, but always use. The sports driver’s seat
is adjustable 8 separate ways, including something no
other car has in Australia, a pneumatic lumbar support.
And there are so many standard luxury features on
this anything but standard car, the only major options to
consider are electric sun roof, genuine Toyota air con-
ditioning and cruise control.
Supra is really in a class of its own!
ATRUE SUPER POWER.
If the engine is the heart of a true performance
sports car, Supra is in excellent shape indeed.
SUPER RESPONSIVE
It is powered by Toyota's re-
markable new, low inertia Super
Responsive engine.
A 2.8 litre, OHC 6 cylinder,
electronically fuel injected power plant that turns the
accelerator into an exhilarator. With engineering that
refines this raw ability into sheer driving enjoyment.
YOU DON'T NEEDTO BE SUPERMAN.
Unlike some sports cars you don't have to work like
Fangio to handle the excellent performance.
Supra's road manners are impeccable.
The flared guards house low profile 60 series tyres on
7" alloy wheels that hug the road.
The rack and pinion power steering, combined with
all-independantToyota Suspension Tuning, and a limited
slip differential let you hug corners and straighten out
sharp curves.
You also have a choice of a snappy 5-speed manual
transmission, orresponsive4-speed overdrive automatic.
Not only does Supra go quickly, it also stops quickly
and surely with 4-wheel ventilated disc brakes.
The otherthingthatsets Supra apart from other high
performance sports cars is that you don't have to be a
Howard Hughes to buy it.
SUPRA. THE SUPERTOYOTA.
It is a car designed for people who take their driving
seriously, and place demands on their machinery.
So you get true European performance with the
I solid, reliable character that distinguishes Toyota.
The new Supra proves that Toyota is well on the way
to becoming the new super power in affordable per-
formance.

the Aboriginal problem. When I hear
people talking about the Aborigines I
am reminded of things happening in the
Philippines. I’m not going to rush into
anything, though. I need time to learn.”
Gore plans to travel round Australia,
meeting many of the thousands who
wrote to him during his two years in
person.
“I feel I could do a lot of good
talking to people. I am a radical, yes,
but methodology is important. I am in
no hurry.”
How did a quiet, middle-class altar
boy from Perth suburbia become a tur-
bulent priest?
“I came from a good Catholic family
and missionary work always interested
me. There was something romantic
about it, I suppose; going overseas as a
priest.”
After two years studying Latin in a
peaceful seminary beside the Swan Riv-
er and another three years training with
the Columbans in Sydney, Gore found
himself in the Philippines: confronted,
in his mid-20s, with his first experience
of poverty.
“I suppose we foreign priests were
hit much more by the suffering of the
poor people. The local clergy were used
to it; it was part of their life.”
Concern with effects led to consider-
ation of causes. The Columban mis-
sionaries, like other priests in the Philip-
pines, began thinking of new ways to
reach out to help their vast flock.
Development projects had failed, the
priests believed, because they lacked
basic organisational support among
those they were supposed to help.
Gore said: ‘‘The only power of the
poor person is his organisation, his
unity. He doesn’t have money. The one
thing he does have is numbers. If you
can get them together to unite them and
help each other, you can help them.
“We tried to help them build up their
self esteem, to believe they were as good
as the next man, to break that fatalism
of believing they were born to live and
die poor. We felt this was no evil thing
but others saw it as an incitement to re-
bellion which it was, I suppose.”
He said, “Our military critics said
our Christian communities were a threat
to national security because they were
building a network of power among the
ordinary poor people and in this they
were 100 percent correct.”
Though the guerilla New People’s
Army is a growing force in the Philip-
pines it was fundamental Christian
ideas, not guns and bombs, which the
Philippine’s government saw as a threat
and rightly so, according to Gore.
“The imperative of the gospel is to
love your neighbor which, taken to its
logical conclusion, is dynamic and rev-
olutionary. Christ and his disciples were
accused of subversion.” □

POLITICS
Abortion is
still an
emotive issue
By DON AITKIN
THE ALP managed to keep the pro-
abortionists moderately happy at its na-
tional conference without arousing the
full ire of the right-to-lifers. The party
did this by bringing a pro-abortion
stand into Labor’s platform but main-
taining the right of parliamentarians to
a conscience vote.
This was a considerable political vic-
tory in a week which saw many others.
Abortion is a difficult question for
the political parties; more difficult, in
some respects, than uranium.
More than one of those who spoke at
the ALP national conference com-
plained that if abortion were to be
treated as a conscience issue then ura-
nium should be given that status, too.
And that is an understandable position.
But as far as the public is concerned, the
two are very different issues.
Uranium is a classic example of the
passionate minority issue: the anti-ura-
nium movement claims to have more
members than has the ALP and that
may be true, since the ALP has only
about 50,000 members. But there is no
pro-uranium movement.
As a political issue, abortion has a
different shape, as Diagram 1 illustrates.
The evidence comes from 1979 but the
battle lines are unlikely to have altered
much. In this 1979 national survey
people were asked: “Do you think that
Diagram 1
women should be able to obtain an
abortion easily when they want one, or
do you think that abortion should be
allowed only in special circumstances?”
Those who had an opinion were then
asked how strongly they felt about the
issue: very strongly, fairly strongly or
not very strongly.
In 1979 Australia split evenly on the
abortion question: 44 percent thought
that women should be allowed abor-
tions when they wanted them, while 47
percent wanted special circumstances
first. Another 5 percent wouldn’t have
abortion under any circumstances and 4
percent had no opinion.
In public policy-making an even div-
ision of the nation is a bad beginning
for new laws. What makes abortion an
Diagram 2
even worse subject is that people feel so
strongly about it. Half of those who had
an opinion claimed to feel very strongly
about and nearly all the rest had fairly
strong opinions.
If you arrange the nation according
to people’s opinions and the strength of
those opinions you get the U-shaped
curve shown in Diagram 1. On the abor-
tion question there is no middle ground
and there are few people still to be per-
suaded.
Not only that: if you divide Australia
into the categories that analysts of pub-
lic opinion use commonly you find the
same antagonism within the sub-groups.
You might think that women would
be more likely to be pro-abortion than
men but in fact the difference is slight:
women are divided deeply about abor-
tion. So are the old, the young, the
middle class, the working class. Regular
churchgoers include the greatest pro-
portion of anti-abortionists but there
are still significant minorities of
churchgoers who believe that if a
woman wants an abortion she should be
allowed to have one. And among those
who never go to church or say they have
no religion the group most likely to
contain pro-abortionists there are
quite a few who are opposed resolutely
to easy abortion.
Political partisanship is no guide to
views on abortion (see Diagram 2). As
you might expect, National Party sup-
porters are the most conservative on the
issue and there are notably fewer
Nationals in favor of easy abortion. But
the similarity between the party profiles
is more striking than the differences.
The ALP is balanced almost perfectly
between passionate pro- and anti-abor-
tionists.
In such circumstances it would be


madness for a political party to insist on
a party vote on the question. It could be
costly to have a formal party policy,
even in as weak-kneed a form as the
Labor version. The politicians are reluc-
tant to stand up to be counted (con-
science votes are rare in Australian par-
liaments) and abortion is an issue which
people neither want nor need to take
their opinions from their political repre-
sentatives.
For the moment, at least, abortion is
too sensitive a matter to be left to the
political parties. Yet that moment may
pass. Fifteen years ago the anti-abortion
forces were much stronger than they
now are, though their passion was prob-
ably less. Abortion was against the law
and doctors who carried out abortions
went in danger of prosecution.
The passage of time, a change of gen-
erations, reams of public debate and a
shift in the interpretation and adminis-
tration of the law in some states have
evened up the pro-abortion and anti-
abortion forces.
In time, as relatively easy abortion
becomes widespread in Australia, the
change in the facts will become reflected
in the formal legal situation. But there
will be many years of angry argument
before that happens. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Keep Olympics
moving,

FIFTY-THREE percent of Australians
would prefer the Olympic Games to
continue to move from country to
country, rather than have a permanent
site in Greece. However, one in two
older Australians indicate a preference
for a permanent Games site in Greece,
according to the Morgan Gallup Poll.
In the Australia-wide survey, 1064
people aged 14 and over were asked for
their views on where the Olympic
Games should be held. They were
asked: “Would you prefer a permanent
site to be established in Greece or that
the Olympic Games continue to move
from country to country?”
Of all Australians, 53 percent would
prefer the Games to continue to move
from country to country, 41 percent
would prefer a permanent site in Greece
and 6 percent had no preference.

URANIUM
Anti-nukes take
off the gloves
at Roxby Downs
By BOB BROWNING
ANGRY OVER their “betrayal” at the
ALP federal conference and fearful of
becoming a marginal political force,
anti-uranium protesters have loosened
the reins on civil disobedience.
Their national co-ordinating body,
the Coalition for a Nuclear Free Austra-
lia, has just issued directives to its mem-
ber organisations setting the tactics for
an all-out blockade of the Roxby
Downs uranium mine, starting on
August 19.
South Australian police have re-
quested an extra $1.6 million to cover
the costs of coping with the blockade
over a six-week period. Some official
circles are saying the cost to taxpayers
could exceed $2 million in extra state
and federal security measures if as ex-
pected the blockade lasts longer.
Protest leaders say they aim to make
the cost to governments and Roxby
joint-venturers high enough to make
them think twice about the viability of
the project. They claim the last cam-
paign at Roxby Downs cost $600,000 in
extra policing and cost the uranium
mining companies $250,000.
In its Roxby Downs Blockade Hand-
book being distributed to its members
the coalition states: “We have chosen to
use civil disobedience as a tactic during
the 1984 Roxby Blockade.” It defines
civil disobedience as a “deliberate viol-
ation of accepted law” and says it will
“break the law openly and collectively
with the full knowledge of our actions
and the consequences that they entail.”
An associated document prepared by
the Legal Education Group titled Civil
Disobedience says: “Among some paci-
fists and non-violent action advocates,
CD assumes a complete commitment to
non-violence” but “This view would
effectively prohibit direct participation
in blockading.”
The coalition says that violence is
likely at Roxby but that it will be caused
by the industry and police who will be

ent civil disobedience blockade” but it
explains that the non-violence is in
comparison “to the inherent violence of
the nuclear industry and the police state
it creates.” It says: “We have tried for
years other methods ... they have
failed.” It claims: “We have been be-
trayed by the ALP federal government
in this country which too easily
capitulated to the pressure from corpor-
ations and multinationals.”
The handbook states that one of the
principle aims of the new tactics is to
“increase the financial cost to the gov-
ernment and the industry” so that they
“will have to take such costs into ac-
count when determining the viability of
such operations.”
To increase the financial costs the
Legal Education Group has devised
new tactics regarding arrests and court
appearances. The coalition says that all
participants “should agree to follow the
same legal pathway” namely, a “col-
lective decision to refuse bail or to serve
time in jail rather than paying a fine.”
Those charged should defend them-
selves to cause court delays and draw
public attention to the “issue rather than
the charge.”
Another innovative feature of the
blockade will be the operations of the
coalition’s Media Collective. Organisers
regard coverage of the last campaign at
Roxby as a media disaster and are
making every effort to ensure this is not
repeated.
The Media Collective at the block-
ade will comprise “between 8 and 12
people” with media skills. Its aim is de-
scribed in the handbook as refusing to
go along with the angles the media will
want to take and pushing angles of its
own choosing. These are defined as:
■ Uranium sellers should be com-
pared to drug pushers, making the
world a worse place.
■ Uranium pushers will turn Austra-
lia into a radioactive waste dump.
■ Uranium mining will create only a
few jobs at great public expense.
■ Nurrungar, the Joint Defence
Space Communications Station, should
be drawn into the debate.
The handbook advises how Nur-
rungar should be involved. The Media
Collective will stress that “It is ironic
that a critically important part of the
USA nuclear war fighting system” is
situated “so close” to a “major source of
the raw material for nuclear weapons
Roxby uranium mine.”
It says the Media Collective will
push the view that “the consequences
for South Australia of a nuclear attack
on Nurrungar” will be “catastrophic.”
It says that author and scientist Dr
Desmond Ball will be quoted as putting
Nurrungar, North West Cape and Pine
Gap “at the very top of the Soviet nu-
clear target list.” □

ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS
Progress report on a black dream
A new deal is being forged for Aborigines in Queensland. DA VID ARMSTRONG
reports on the progress of an Aboriginal-owned cattle station and looks at the
Queensland Government’s land title proposals which, although unpopular with many
Aborigines, could provoke white hostility.
ROLLEY GILBERT, Aboriginal patri-
arch of the Gulf country, had a dream.
With his mind’s eye he saw a cattle
station owned and run by Aborigines,
drawing young men out of the towns
and, most importantly, the pubs and
giving them training and jobs; a place
which would be a haven for Aboriginal
families to camp, hunt and fish as their
ancestors had done before the coming
of the white race.
“Old Roliey,” born at Gilbert River,
in north Queensland, in 1911, learned
decades ago that “if you don’t ask for it,
you don’t get it.” Getting the property
was a matter of asking, yet again, for
that which Europeans had but Aborigi-
nes did not. Now they have to show they
are able to run it themselves. So far, they
have not.
Gilbert reasoned that once only
white people had schools, pensions and
liquor. Aborigines asked for these trap-
pings of European society and eventual-
ly received them. So in the 70s he and
other Aborigines from Normanton,
near the south-east corner of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, be-
gan asking for that which the
white race held precious:
land.
What they got, after a num-
ber of false starts, was Delta
Downs, a 4000 sq km station
north of Normanton. The Ab-
original Development Com-
mission, with which Gilbert
had negotiated, bought out
the shares in the Delta Downs
Pastoral Company in De-
cember 1982. The cost was
$1.6 million, with $1 million
being paid at the time and a fi-
nal payment due next
•October. According to the
commission the property was
to be a base for the Kurtjar
people of Normanton. It was
not what the Aborigines had
asked for.
Much of the Normanton
Aborigines’ vision was ex-
pressed in a letter from the lo-
cal Carpentaria Shire Council
to the federal Aboriginal
Affairs Department in the late
70s. The Aborigines asked for
a piece of crown land on
which they could set up, in the language
of the bureaucrats, a rural occupation
training scheme.
The idea was that they would build a
station from scratch, learning all the
skills of property development and
management. The benefits of increased
employment and reduced drinking
would flow automatically.
When they got Delta Downs, how-
ever, they got a run-down, but going,
concern. They also got white manage-
ment and technical staff. The
jobs available for the Aborigi-
nes were the usual ones:
rounding up cattle, fencing,
cooking. The name of the
property was changed to the
Aboriginal Morr-Morr but it is
always called Delta Downs.
The “Aboriginal property” is
owned by the white taxpayers.
It is a white property which
employs more Aborigines
than most.
The purchase of Delta
Roliey Gilbert
Downs brought political controversy.
The Bjelke-Petersen government was
opposed to Aboriginal ownership of a
pastoral lease; to circumvent the
Queensland Government the shares
were bought in New South Wales. The
initial reaction of much of the local
white community was hostile. Many
Europeans already think Aborigines are
given too much in subsidised housing
and education. The political pressures
are such that Delta Downs must prove
itself by being a commercial
success.
“Old Rolley’s” plan,
caught in the middle of the
continuing battle between
Canberra and Brisbane over
Aboriginal issues, did not
have a chance of being
fulfilled. It was impracticable,
anyhow.
Delta Downs came under
political scrutiny again last
month, during an investiga-
tion of the Aboriginal Devel-
A stockmen’s camp on Delta Downs: Aborigines make good stockmen, says manager Bill Johnston


The Delta Downs homestead, an hour’s drive north from Normanton
opment Commission’s finances by the
House of Representatives standing
committee on expenditure. A commis-
sion official, Loris Sclip, told of how he
had “more or less” been appointed
manager of the property in February
last year. He had simply been given a
chequebook, told the company had a
$200,000 overdraft and asked to “keep
the property going.” He had had no ex-
perience of big station management.
Rolley Gilbert is more concerned
about the relationship of his people to
Delta Downs than with the details of
past management practices. This
stooped, pencil-thin man with wispy
grey hair, a bristly grey beard and teeth
stained yellow from the roll-your-own
cigarettes he smokes almost constantly,
is a director of the Morr-Morr Pastoral
Company but he never went to school.
He began working on a cattle station at
the age of 12 and since then he has
worked on “lots of properties” and
done “all the jobs.” He is a quietly
spoken man who has been asked by uni-
versities down south to talk about Abor-
iginal culture and problems. As the lo-
cal Aborigines would say, he is a “real
old gentleman.”
He lives on Delta Downs in a fibro-
clad hut near the homestead. His room
is painted pink and lilac curtains cover
the windows. It contains two iron
bunks, a couple of chairs, a chest of
drawers and little else. One of his six
children is a camp cook.
“Old Rolley” justifies the purchase
on the grounds of justice and necessity.
He recalls going to Canberra to talk to
commission officials about the property.
“I said: ‘Why shouldn’t we have our
land ba-ek?-We’re entitled to it it’s
only because of the Queensland govern-
ment that we haven’t.’ So today we have
our land back.”
The need Gilbert saw was to find a
Delta Downs, on the Gulf of Carpentaria
way of cutting people’s drinking. “I
want to get the teenagers out of
Normanton,” Gilbert says. “They get
into bad company with their drinking. I
used to drink but I gave it away 25 years
ago. I saw my people drinking so much
and spending so much money that they
could have spent on other things.
“I had the idea of training people.
That’s important for our race. When
people pass away they should know that
the young people are trained.”
Twenty months after the purchase
Gilbert is simultaneously delighted and
disappointed. He is pleased that some
of his people have jobs and are working
well. “A lot of my people are working
here together and they have no prob-
lems,” he says. “They are so happy.” He
is upset about the number of white em-
ployees; the need to use helicopters
not Aboriginal stockmen for muster-
ing in remote, inaccessible areas; and
the lack of a vehicle to bring people out
from Normanton.
“I know we’ve got to have choppers,
for certain,” he says. “I’ve got to cop all
that. I don’t agree about having so many
white people. We should have
only a station manager and a
mechanic, that’s all. The white
race is getting the money.
Some people say they don’t
want to work out here with the
white people.
“I would like to get people
out here. I will organise things
for them. If they want to do a
bit of work, they can. If not,
they can camp out and do
their own hunting. The
trouble is we haven’t got a ve-
hicle to get them out here.”
In spite of his reservations
Gilbert gets on well with Bill
Johnston, the station manager
since April of last year.
Johnston, 37, has a bushy
moustache and light brown
hair which makes him look
like 60 Minutes’ George
Negus without the wings of
grey at the temples.
He is used to working in remote
areas with native people. After gradua-
ting from agricultural college in Wagga,
NSW, in 1965, he went to Papua New
Guinea. Following a short stint on Bou-
gainville he returned to NSW, then went
to work for an Australian-owned com-
pany in the Solomon Islands, before go-
ing on to run a property of 8000 ha, with
7500 head of cattle, for former PNG
Transport Minister Bruce Jephcott. He
stayed with Jephcott for three years,
then moved on to other properties and
joined the PNG Development Bank in
1976.
He and his wife, Rhoda, have three
pre-teen daughters, two of whom board
at the Presbyterian Girls College at
Warwick, in the south of Queensland.
The rest of the family live in a cream,
two-storeyed fibro and weatherboard
homestead, surrounded by gums, palms
and bougainvillea.
The homestead is about an hour’s
drive north from Normanton, mostly
over a wide and well-maintained dirt
road. The country is flat, scrubby and
ugly yet strangely captivating, because
of sudden changes in the landscape:
here a lagoon teeming with birds; there
a creek lined with imposing gums.
The property runs inland from the
south-east corner of the Gulf. At its
longest point it is about 100 km from
south to north; at its widest it is about
80km from east to west. One paddock
alone, the Gilbert, covers 1600 sq km.
The fencing and the homestead area
look in good condition, although
Johnston says they were run down when
he arrived. The cattle, however, were
and are in fine shape: sleek and well-
rounded. “That’s the one thing about
this place,” Johnston says. “It’s got ex-
cellent cattle.”
By Johnston’s conservative estimate


Station manager Johnston and a stockman inspect some of the Delta Downs cattle
the property holds about 18,000 head.
Including Johnston the station employs
five white men, plus a pilot who is there
until Johnston gets his licence. About 25
Aborigines work there.
The Aborigines are yet to show that
they are able to run a station such as
Delta Downs on their own. Johnston
has his eye on a young Aborigine whom
he plans to send to agricultural college
next year. He might be a future manager
of the property but the time when he is
ready to take over is a long way off.
“They’ve got to get someone to run it
themselves,” Johnston says.
Until that time Johnston says the
presence of the whites is inevitable.
“These blokes (the Aborigines) are good
stockmen and that’s their job,” he says.
“Other things they’re not really interest-
ed in. You need expertise in this type of
operation. The Aboriginal involvement
makes the job a lot harder. It’s a big job,
anyway. If it weren’t an Aboriginal en-
terprise you’d have more white staff.
“I’ve got some good men here but the
grog’s a problem. They won’t take re-
sponsibility. I get the impression that
it’s just a job to them. I don’t think it
means a hell of a lot to them that they
own the place, except perhaps for the
older people.”
Recently a weekend-long local show-
cum-party was held at Snake Creek, on
the way to the Delta Downs homestead.
The hangovers (among whites and
Aborigines) reported were monumental.
Johnston says he got no work out of the
Aborigines on the Monday. One of the
Aboriginal workers said it was not until
the following Thursday that everyone
was working efficiently.
So far this year the station has turned
over more than $500,000 and Morr-
Morr Pastoral Company chairman (and
ADC commissioner) Mick Miller pre-
dicts the figure will reach $1 million by
the end of 1984. Costs are high: Miller
says the wages bill last year was
Bob Katter: a revolutionary plan for the
Aborigines of Queensland
$370,000 and the helicopters cost about
$70,000 a year. Profits will go back into
the property. “Everything that’s been
done since the ADC took over has been
done with money generated by the
property,” Johnston says.
Neither Johnston nor Miller disputes
Sclip’s story of his unorthodox appoint-
ment and Johnston does admit to falling
behind in his paperwork at times. To
help solve the problem he has bought a
Microbee computer. Delta Downs,
however, is having to live with an early
management decision which continues
to be expensive. In March last year the
company bought the Burns, Philp store
in Normanton. This store, built in 1879,
was Burns, Philp’s second store. It has
been renamed the Mai (food) store, al-
though it still bears the Burns, Philp
name on the front. According to
Johnston a total of $190,000 has gone
into the store (although the purchase
price was substantially lower than that).
“A fair bit of money has gone out of the
property that could have gone into the
property,” he says. “They should get the
store right out of the company.”
The prevailing white attitude in the
area towards Delta Downs seems to be
that it is acceptable as long as it is a
commercial success. The initial ani-
mosity which could have led to a white
backlash appears to have dissipated.
But plans are afoot for North Queens-
land’s Aborigines which could yet pro-
voke white hostility.
Earlier this year Bob Katter, the
Queensland minister responsible for
Aboriginal affairs, brought down legis-
lation giving Aboriginal communities a
form of title to the reserve land on
which they live. The legal device for
achieving the handover is called a deed
of grant in trust. When regulations
under the new laws take effect 20,000
Aboriginal Queenslanders will control,
through their communities, some 3 mil-
lion hectares of land, most of it in the
Gulf and Cape York Peninsula areas.
At the same time community coun-
cils are being given powers of self-man-
agement similar to, but less than, local
government powers. Self-management
is to be phased in over three years. The
changes Katter has introduced are rad-
ical. Under previous legislation the De-
partment of Aboriginal and Islander
Affairs, renamed the Community Ser-
vices Department, managed reserves.
People living on the communities
(the new name for reserves) will elect
their own councils. The department will
continue to have a role but it will be
more advisory than managerial.
Katter’s plans, however, go much
further. “The Queensland government
will effectively be moving village land
into private ownership,” he says. “The
power over this decision lies with the
councils but in all probability the vast
bulk of the land will be handed over to
pastoral leases. The energies of the de-
partment will be directed to supplying
people with the needs for running fam-
ily-run businesses in the reserve areas.”

planned Aboriginal properties and
Delta Downs is that Delta is owned
from Canberra. Under his scheme own-
ership eventually will reside in families
and individuals. The main restriction is
that owners will be able to sell only to
others within the community. Aborigi-
nes, however, will be allowed to buy
land outside the reserve areas.
According to Katter, Aborigines
would gain access to capital for their
enterprises through their title to the land
and the “cleanskin” (unbranded) cattle
already on the land. Further financial
help would have to come from Can-
berra. “We are hoping that organisa-
tions such as the Aboriginal Develop-
ment Commission will shoulder their
responsibilities as far as commencement
capital goes,” he says.
Turning Aboriginal land over to
owner-entrepreneurs and asking Can-
berra to finance the ventures would
have the effect of virtually eliminating
the state government’s role in Aborigi-
nal affairs. It would vacate the field in
favor of the federal government.
Miller is opposed resolutely to
Katter’s plan. Individual ownership, he
says, is alien to Aboriginal tradition and
thought. Other Aboriginals are wary of
enforced development of their areas.
Annie Chong, chairman of the
Momington Island council, says devel-
opment can come but only when the
people are able to accept it.
Katter has devised his plans in the
face of strong opposition from his own
department. Pat Killoran, his depart-
mental head, favors what might be
called an “overall development” ap-
proach developing the north general-
ly, both black and white communities.
His aim is to avoid a white backlash
flowing from giving Aborigines “too
much.” The dispute between Katter and
Killoran is amazingly acrimonious.
Killoran has presided over the depart-
ment for 20 years. Katter proposes dis-
posing with two decades’ work.
Katter realises that his plan would
mean severe disruption to traditional
Aboriginal culture. His argument is that
only private ownership can restore Ab-
original pride and give them prosperity.
The Japanese, he says, had to throw
over their feudal culture when they
embraced notions of private enterprise.
So, too, must the Aborigines shed much
of their communal traditions. It can be
done, he says. He is sure the Aboriginal
thought patterns are not genetically-

THE ARTS
Jonathan Miller: still
beyond the theatrical fringe
Britain's Angry Middle-aged Man explains himself in a kinetic and
splenetic conversation with MEL GUSSOWabout
re-interpretation and re-evaluation of the performing arts today.
WORKING for Peter Hall at Britain’s
National Theatre was like “working for
Nixon.” Television has done “a terrible
disservice to literature.” And, as for the
movies, a forthcoming film based on a
literary masterpiece is “a Thalidomide
abortion.”
Acerbic as well as opinionated,
Jonathan Miller has courted contro-
versy as if she were a duchess. As a re-
sult and partly by choice he has
endangered his own employability. In a
career just short of 25 years, he has re-
sponded by becoming peripatetic, bat-
ting back and forth among the arts and
between England and America. Against
odds, he has maintained a position as a
director of classics on stage, in opera
houses and on television and also as an
author, lecturer and television host of
the popular medical series, The Body in
Question.
Just over a year ago, he announced
his retirement from the arts a threat-
ened curtain in a career that he began in
1960 as a comedian, one quarter of Be-
yond the Fringe and a full-time return
to medicine, the profession for which he
was trained. He has a research fellow-
ship in neuropsychology and has a par-
ticular interest in the human brain.
While participating in the arts he has
“felt remorse about not being in medi-
cine.”
Nevertheless, through sheer momen-
tum and despite the apparent short-
age of hospitable places for him to work
Miller’s artistic productivity seems to
continue with unabated enthusiasm and
eclecticism. Recently, after a stop in
Palm Springs, California, for a medical
conference, he flew to Houston for the
beginning of the US tour of his radical
production of Rigoletto. Then it was on
to New York when Rigoletto opened at
the Metropolitan Opera House. Then it
was back home to London to finish two
books one with his right hand, one
with his left a history of the connec-
tions between mesmerism and radical
politics and a volume entitled The After-
life of Plays.
His retirement will be topped off by


his 1985 London production of Don
Giovanni. One fully expects the
Bernhardt-like billboard, “Positively Fi-
nal Performance,” to be posted until the
end of the century.
Even as a full-time doctor, he re-
mains a retiree in question. Perhaps he
is simply biding his office hours waiting
for an offer he cannot refuse, such as an
invitation to run his own theatre with
plenipotentiary power, something that
for the moment seems reserved for his
rival, Peter Hall.
Because of his iconoclastic interpre-
tations of classics, Miller has acquired
detractors as well as admirers.
For him, each production rep-
resents a leap of his faith in
his own intuitive judgment,
reached after considerable
contemplation as well as re-
search. The approach may
seem rash but it is never with-
out reasons. Even when
criticised for his divergence
from tradition, he insists that
he is faithful to the spirit of
the source as he sees it.
The title of his book in pro-
gress, The Afterlife of Plays, a
variation on the German,
nachleben der antike, or the af-
terlife of antiquity, could
serve as a summary of his the-
atrical and operatic endeavors
and also as a defence of his
approach as a director.
“Works of art do not re-
main the same,” he said. Plays
and operas went through a re-
newal process as each genera-
tion looked at them from its
particular vantage point.
“They have a natural life,
performed in ways that are approved by
the author. Then, after a long period of
extinction or oblivion, they resurface in
a form completely different from what
the author intended. No producer or di-
rector thinks of anything being a defini-
tive production. The only ones who use
that expression are critics.”
In the case of Rigoletto he transposed
Verdi from 16th-century Mantua to a
1950 s New York mafioso setting, a
choice that led to controversy. The an-
nouncement of the production drew
protests from Italian-American organ-
isations. A representative of the Sons of
Italy in America said that the version
showed monumental insensitivity to the
very “culture that produced the genius
of Giuseppe Verdi.” In response, Miller
showed a tape of his production to Ital-
ian-American leaders and felt that he
had pacified them.
Describing the genesis of his
Rigoletto, he said: “Sometimes you get
struck by a musical metaphor.” Prepar-
ing his version for the English National
Opera, he found himself influenced by
movies. He saw Some Like It Hot, and
remembered a scene in which George
Raft supplied an alibi for a crony, say-
ing he was at a performance of
Rigoletto. In Palm Beach, Miller
realised, “there were friends of Italian
opera.”
That correlation between gangsters
and opera was confirmed by The God-
father. When A 1 Pacino’s Michael
Corleone was married in Italy, “a town
band cranked out a tune from
Traviata.”
These were, Miller said, “startling
congruences, previously unseen sim-
Peter Hall: “very much like Nixon,” according to Miller
CENTRAL PRESS PHOTOS
ilarities,” and from that point he could
“map out a structure.” “I carefully
transposed the opera,” he said. “It was
like lifting a fossil and giving it a differ-
ent sort of musculature. Simply to have
an automatic update is mindless but no
more mindless than simply leaving a
work in its period.”
Because of his independent attitude,
he has been faced with a shrinking do-
main in which to perform acts of artistic
surgery. When Laurence Olivier was
head of the National Theatre, Miller
was one of the company’s regular direc-
tors, a relationship that was severed
after Peter Hall arrived. He and Hall
remain at sword’s point and word’s
point, with Hall assailing Miller in his
recently published Diaries.
“Hall is very much like Nixon,”
Miller said. “He is very solitary and ob-
sessed with power and money. He loves
big stars and that’s where his power de-
rives from. He has secret conclaves with
prestigious figures. I suggested that he
take the door of his office off its hinges.”
Hall kept the door and also accepted
the artistic direction of the
Glyndebourne Opera Festival, which
gave him even more control over
English theatre and opera.
While unable to work at the Nation-
al, Miller has not taken the alternate
route to the Royal Shakespeare Com-
pany. He said: “I couldn’t work there
except, occasionally, as a guest director.
I would want to be part of a company as
I was at the English National Opera.
I’m a studio artist, very much a
homebody. In my case, familiarity
breeds contentment.”
Not being affiliated with either of
England’s two major theatres,
the National and the Royal
Shakespeare Company, is, for
Miller, a nearly insurmount-
able obstacle. “It’s like being
an internal exile in the Soviet
Union,” he said. “You have
all the skills but no place to
practise. You’re castrated.”
Then he proceeded to bait
television, where he was pro-
ducer and director of
Shakespeare for the BBC:
“Television-dias done a ter-
rible disservice to literature. It
devours and destroys fiction
by turning it into overcivilised
soap operas, a sort of
Fortnum and Mason export
line, like Oxford marmalade,
eaten as an English commod-
ity.”
He included movies in his
indictment. To adapt fiction
to the screen, he said, is “like
saying, let’s try skating on
syrup it could be done if
only we tried harder.” From
his perspective, there is no
“afterlife” for adaptations, a word that
passes like poison on his lips.
He reserved much of his antipathy
for Swann in Love, the forthcoming film
of Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past.
First he attacked the “gross invention of
representing Swann as a slim, winsome
young man who could be a denizen of a
disco.” For him, the visualisation of the
character of Swann or of any charac-
ter from a novel is inessential to the
experience.
“One is surprised that characters
have a ‘look’ at all. To think what
Swann looks like gets in the way. Great
fiction has great description but film
thinks of description as second best to
depiction.”
With uncharacteristic equanimity, he
pointed to the Royal Shakespeare Com-
pany’s Nicholas Nickleby and Yuri
Lyubimov’s recent London stage adap-
tation of Crime and Punishment as ex-
ceptions. On the other end of the spec-
trum, he allowed for the embodiment of
lesser work and used the television
series of Brideshead Revisited as an


example, “A second-rate novel that be-
came a soap opera of a very high or-
der.”
When asked why he did not work
with contemporary playwrights, he ex-
pressed an admiration for Samuel
Beckett but said that his work had al-
ready been defined in productions by
the author. He said that Sam Shepard
was “very, very good indeed but best
done by Americans” and added that he
liked Harold Pinter’s early plays and
had “tremendous admiration” for the
work of Joe Orton. In praise of early
Pinter and all of Orton, he said:
“Neither was aware of the importance
of their themes.”
In contrast, he levelled his sights at
Peter Shaffer. “I can’t bear him,” he
said. “Sentimental tosh and twaddle
from Amadeus back to Equus."
On an imaginary scale, he weighs a
playwright’s intention against his execu-
tion. “Pick up Shaffer,” he suggested.
“The enormous size of his themes. The
play is one-eighth of what it should
weigh.”
The only living playwright he ex-
pressed unabashed admiration for
whom was Athol Fugard. “I think
Fugard is a great playwright, brilliant
and excellently presented under his own
supervision. It would be meddlesome
for someone else to direct them.”
With Shaffer there is a thunder of
pretension. They don’t make speeches
in Fugard’s work. The weight and vol-
ume are consistent with one another.
The specific gravity of Fugard’s plays is
dead right.”
That led him back to his masters,
Shakespeare and Mozart, and their
specific gravity.
“With Shakespeare and Mozart, you
know you’re in safe hands. You feel
supported by a strong, masterful grasp.
You get into the current and you know
you will be conducted with thrust and
purpose.”
Because of his dismissive attitude
about many of his contemporaries, it
seemed natural to ask if he had any
friends in the theatre. “Directors have
an adulterous suspicion of each other,”
he said.
“Most of my friends are designers or
actors,” or people outside of the theatre.
He said that he was still in touch with
his Beyond the Fringe mates, including
Dudley Moore, but they did not see
each other often.
Miller seemed to regard his own de-
parture from acting 22 years ago
with no regret, just as he regarded his
shift into medicine as a natural change
of course a move, as it were, into the
“afterlife” of Miller.
He ended by aiming a characteristic
Miller barb against his own verbal facil-
ity: “So much of what I say is can-
tankerous howl.” □

West eyes the
riptides lurking
in our society
Morris West: prefers to talk in concepts
ERNIE McQUILLAN
By GLENDA THOMPSON
BEST-SELLING author Morris West
fears Australia is not the placid, stable
society pictured by many people. He
says the immigration debate sparked by
Professor Geoffrey Blainey brought to
light ugly conflicts.
“The causes of dissention in this
country are much closer to the surface
than the civilised man believes them to
be,” West says. “The old divisions be-
tween races, classes, religions and old
histories are still very tender.
“Racial migration is a very danger-
ous and tendentious argument which
will polarise the discontents in this
country. It is finding other scapegoats
... once it was the Jews and the Gyp-
sies; now, let’s make it the Viets or the
Chinese.
“I’m not saying Blainey shouldn’t
have said it. I don’t want to
curtail free speech. I point
out, however, that the com-
municator must have a deep
devotion to the cause of truth
and a very, very clear, pro-
found knowledge of the con-
sequences of everything he or
she says so that a notion of
self-censorship and self-regu-
lation enters into our daily
commerce with one another.
“The notion of self-censor-
ship is implicit in any stable
society even marriage, if I
may suggest it.”
West will rarely be drawn
on specifics. In the two years
he has been back after 17
years living abroad, he has
often claimed ignorance of
matters Australian.
He prefers to talk in con-
cepts, the broad problems
facing mankind such as the
big subjects tackled in his
novels violence and terror-
ism in Proteus (1979), the end
of the world in The Clowns of
God(m\).
West denies any wish to
preach. He is pleased by re-
sponses to his books and he
marvels at any influence he
has wrought on others.
At the “Awgies,” the Aus-
tralian Writers’ Guild awards for tele-
vision, stage, radio and film script-
writers in Melbourne recently, one of
the nominees told him she was there
because of him. She had given him a
cup of coffee once and asked him how
to write.
He had told her to write a page every
day for 12 months because, “unless
you’re patient enough to write a page at
a time, you’ll never write a book.”
West spent 18 months on his next
book ( The World is Made of Glass was
the latest, in 1983) which we will see this
time next year. It is about “My Personal
View of Australia,” says West, sending
himself up. “No, I don’t know what it
will be called. It is not about all those
things you’ve heard.”
He is engrossed with film and tele-
vision talks about which he will say
little. But he will talk kindly about the
doom facing mankind.
“I tend to agree with Arthur Koestler
that man is a mad animal. Man con-
trives his own tragedies and contrives
his own hell,” West says.
He expands about the robot age en-
suring unending unemployment, the
population exploding and using up the
planet’s resources and the ultimate
threat of nuclear annihilation.
“I see it as a constant struggle to bal-
ance the constructor and the destructor,
to prepare against the locust years when


the world gets out of balance,” he says.
West was ill four years ago and came
to his own terms with death: “Every day
then, everything you do, becomes
precious not in the sense that you
cling to it; in the sense of prizing it.”
He says that, in the same way, man-
kind itself is on the brink: “So it’s a
great mistake for national leaders to dis-
count the strength of peace and dis-
armament movements, the impulse of
people under threat of the atom bomb.
It’s a great mistake to treat all those
people as though they are cranks or pol-
itical provocateurs.
“Children are affected by
more than we realise. Part of this is the
drug scene. It leads to flight; it’s not just
kicks.”
His remarks would be read in the
light of the Australian Labor Party’s re-
cent decision to continue uranium
mining in Australia, I said.
“The closer one comes to the actual
detail, the less I am inclined to be cer-
tain. I don’t really know but, once the
genie is out of the bottle, you can’t
really put the cork back,” he replied.
The novelist sat with his back to the
superb view from his 59th floor office at
Sydney’s MLC Centre. A chunky man
with crumpled face, he has been ac-
cused of lack of humor but I found him
warm and human. At times he treated
me less as one would expect of a busy
millionaire, more like the father of one’s
best friend.
Politically, he warns that Australia is
on the verge of going the way of Britain
rather than America: “I hear, more and
more, the phrase which I heard ad
nauseum in England ‘they’ (meaning
the government) should do something
about it. This is a dangerous point, that
the state is separate from man. Once
you reach this point, you destroy the
roots of democracy.
“The Americans in a funny way have
better grassroots democracy. It is easier,
even in the desert jungle of New York,
to find communities of people saying,
‘Why do we live in this shit? Why don’t
we all get out and tidy the place up and
plant some gardens and make a tiny en-
vironment of our own. We’ll fight the
city fathers if we have to.’
“Now you can do that in a town, you
can do that in a village in America. The
inertia of centralisation doesn’t work.
“You have the problems of the
elected judiciary, the elected police
chief in many areas, which bring its own
corruption. At the same time, at town
level it introduces a constant account-
ability. We regard our people as ac-
countable only every three years.
“We’re in danger of going the way of
Britain but we shouldn’t. We don’t have
the dead hand of the class system on us
here which England did. We don’t have
that excuse.” □

The mixed
blessings of a
point of view
By SANDRA HALL
DAVID BRADBURY is a unique and
contentious talent among Australian
film-makers in that he likes to take on
the world. His three films have all been
about other people’s politics and each
has posed provocative questions about
the business of reportage about the
delicate relationship between truth and
commitment and the dangers and ad-
vantages of having a point of view.
By the very nature of its subject, his
previous film Public Enemy Number
One, an examination of the life and
times of Wilfred Burchett confronted
these issues in every frame. His new
film, Nicaragua: No Pasaran, shows
similar tensions but throws up more
sophisticated answers to its questions.
Bradbury likes to have heroes for his
films (something which
made the one on Burchett
so problematical) and
early on he talked to
Graham Greene about
Panama and his friendship
with General Torrijos, the
subject of Greene’s new
book, Getting to Know the
General. But when Torrijos
was killed in a plane crash,
Greene lost interest in the
film.
Bradbury, meanwhile,
had got himself as far as
Nicaragua where he hap-
pened to meet Bianca
Jagger in a cafe. For a
while (until she insisted on
having control of the final
cut), the film looked like
becoming Bianca Goes To
The Revolution. Then, after
much lobbying and waiting, Bradbury
managed to interest Nicaraguan minis-
ter for the Interior Tomas Borge in be-
ing his protagonist.
The idea doesn’t really work. Per-
haps Borge is as charismatic in person
as Bradbury claims in the interview
which comes with the production notes
but even when remembering his months
of torture and imprisonment under the
Somoza regime he is stolid and impass-
The Pope in Managua: Sandinistas were upset
ive on film. As well, the frequency of his
appearances strikes an uncomfortably
official note at odds with everything else
about the work.
Bradbury may be passionate in his
defence of the Sandinistas but he also
seems to have learned something from
his experiences with the Burchett film.
Nobody could say that Nicaragua: No
Pasaran is even-handed in the conven-
tional ABC sense. But the other side of

the argument is not restricted to the ex-
tracts from a Reagan speech to congress
which are used with cold irony to punc-
tuate the action: The most telling criti-
cisms come from Nicaraguans them-
selves women arguing in the market
over the reasons for high prices and
poor produce; Miskitu Indians, held on
prison farms for collaborating with the
US-backed contras, complaining about
being arrested without trial.
The Miskitu interview is rebutted
swiftly by another with an American
human rights commissioner but there’s
nothing to dilute the effect of the film’s
most piquant moments in which two
brothers argue the issue of press censor-
ship.
Pedro and Carlos Chamorro are
both newspaper chiefs, sons of a liberal
editor who was shot dead in 1978 pre-
sumably by Somoza’s national guard.
Wearing Lacoste T-shirts, the brothers
are interviewed at their desks. Pedro,
editor of the independent La Prensa,
bitterly repeats President Reagan’s con-
demnation of media censorship in
Nicaragua; Carlos, editor of the pro-
government Barricade, argues that cen-
sorship is a necessary strategy since the
country is on a war footing.
Lucky enough to be in Managua
during the Pope’s visit last year,
Bradbury filmed the rally at which
Sandinista supporters became incensed
both by the Pope’s remarks about the
folly of letting politics interfere with re-
ligion and his failure to say anything to
comfort the relatives and friends of 17
boys killed in a contra raid the day be-
fore. They had been waiting for such
words and, when they didn’t come,
anger mounted and with it the chanting
which eventually drowned out the rest
of the speech.
There’s an awful inevitability about
it all and, by catching it so precisely, the
film amplifies the headlines it provoked
as no amount of editorialising has been
able to do.
Footage such as this and of young
Sandinistas doing their military train-
ing against a background of arriving
and departing US military transports on
the Honduran border give the film pun-
gency and immediacy as well as adding
substance to Bradbury’s contention that
the Sandinistas are engaged in self-de-
fence, rather than the export of revol-
ution. Nicaragua: No Pasaran has color,
character and a sense of commitment. □

Good humor
in a dog’s-eye
view of life
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
Archimedes And The Seagle, by
David Ireland. The Viking Press,
$16.95.
AT LAST, a happy Australian novel!
We have so many that are gloomy, an-
guished, ultimately depressing. And
along comes David Ireland, of all
people, with a novel radiating kindness
and good humor. Ireland, who has had
some of the most appalling visions of
human depravity to have appeared in
fiction. No, he has not gone soft in the
head; he has taken a new look at the
human race, a dog’s-eye view. His nar-
rator is a dog.
Archimedes is the dog-narrator,
rechristened from the original name
Harrison B. Guest (“Hap” or “Happy”
for short) by Julie Guest, the 14-year-
old daughter of his employers not
“owners.” She gave him the name be-
cause she found him reading Euclid.
Although he has this remarkable ac-
complishment of being able to read, he
cannot talk to human beings only to
other animals.
In the gutter near where he lives in
Woolloomooloo, he finds a battered
copy of something called the Book Of
Knowledge and with great difficulty lugs
it home to his kennel.
By means of his modest canine hero,
Ireland is able to speak of those
forbidden subjects joy, kindness, beauty
without falling into human-sentiment-
ality.
Being Ireland, who already knows
the worst but also is a very ac-
complished novelist, possibilities of
goodness are subtly introduced by the
presence of evil. For instance, Chapter
76 “Glad And Light-hearted Things I
Delight In” is preceded by “But They
Cut Up Animals Alive” (Chapter 74;
some brutal facts about vivisection) and
“The Smell Of Blood” (Chapter 75),
about finding a favorite old horse shot
dead by seven bullets pumped into him
by vandals for amusement.
There are parallels between the lives
of dogs and humans, beginning with
Archimedes’ strong assertion that dogs
are people. Dogs live in boxes, just like
their city employers; one kennel is
called Wyebark. Dogs, however, are
David Ireland: a refusal to draw boundaries
luckier than humans: they have all day
to read and think. Archimedes wants to
share his knowledge as part of his wish
to improve the world. He tries to teach
his philosophical friend Dogenes to
read but not with much success.
Archimedes And the Seagle is also
about seagulls, giving inspired op-
portunities for satire on humans. Begin-
ning with a drunken seagull which has
been sipping from a broken bottle of
cheap sherry — “A drunken seagull! I
should have expected it of a Sydney
gull, I suppose.”
Archimedes hears, from a bulldog
friend who has intellectual leanings, of
a very special seagull “that flies higher
than all the other gulls — as high as an
eagle. He’s more like an eagle than a
seagull.”
When Archimedes finally makes
contact with the Seagle — this bird
which is more spirit than matter, more
imagination than reasoning — the
silence of the bird puzzles him. He has a
vision, as he watches this enigmatic
bird, of his precious Book beside it in
the air. Back in his kennel, he picks up
the Book and lets it fall at random. It
opens on a passage on freedom and
how it must be protected by people and
also reconciled with their weaknesses.
Archimedes realises that the individual
life of the Seagle, hero and hermit, is not
for him: “For better or worse, my life
was amongst others.”
Archimedes And The Seagle is full of
unfashionable confidence in ordinary
people, even in Australians. This book
contains a lot of catalogues, reminiscent
of Walt Whitman, and Ireland shares
with Whitman not only a
guarded optimism but also a
refusal to draw boundaries.
The novel is revolutionary
while refusing to countenance
a timetable of revolution.
“I’m not a revolutionary
dog,” says Archimedes, who is
also very wary of intellect-
uals. His ideas lead on from
dogs to people to life and he
asks where do people stop
and things begin.
Archimedes also states
firmly, “I am not a religious
dog” but he is not averse to
inventing his own religion.
(One recalls that Ireland was
brought up in a family of
Plymouth Brethren.) Archi-
medes has programs of wis-
dom and morality “The Ten
Things” of Chapter 55, the
“Twelve Aspirations” of
Chapter 94. He goes home
happy after bounding into an
art class one day and reading
the title of a student’s paint-
ing: “Under everything, at the
heart of all things, there is life
and strength and joy.”
Yet, as Archimedes observes else-
where: “On planet Earth, mankind is
the root of all evil.” This amiable dog —
an unabashed teacher — has some very
old proposals to offer that are made mir-
aculously new. □
A humorist’s

By MARY ROSE LIVERANI
Growing Up, by Russell Baker.
Sidgwick & Jackson, $26.50.
A LITTLE MAN adorns the front cover
of this autobiography. Hair neatly
parted and sleeked down, in tie and
woollen jacket, he exudes all the re-
spectability an ambitious Mama could
iwant. But, for a child of eight, his ex-
pression is unusually guarded. He seems
never to have known mischief, unlike
the younger sister shown beside him in
the full photo of which the cover is only
a detail. The children are Russell Baker,
now world-famous New York Times
columnist, and Doris who got married.
Psychologists say that the “favorite
son” is the person most likely to succeed
in a family. When a boy’s father dies
young, forcing his mother to focus her
hopes for a future on her only son, that
boy is favored indeed.
Baker’s story proceeds from his

mother’s senility. She is 81 and confined
to bed. Her retreat into childhood,
Baker argues, stems not so much from
hardening arteries as from the loss of a
future. Her future had been her son’s
until he insisted on creating his own.
Now a grandfather himself, he sees a
similar situation emerging with his chil-
dren and regrets having abandoned his
past. He wants to show that life is more
than “single span from diaper to
shroud,” that it is instead “a braided
cord of humanity”.
Growing Up ties together three gener-
ations of the blue-collar elements in an
old Virginian family buffeted by the De-
pression but surviving through the in-
domitable spirit of its womenfolk and
the family loyalties of its more enter-
prising males. Baker writes of the
women his grandmother, his mother,
aunts, sister and ultimately his wife
with awe. They tower over him, even
physically. One suspects that the four
years it took him to decide to marry
Mimi, his spirited girlfriend, might have
sprung from a desire to remain free of
“petticoat government.”
In the country or the city, Baker
women were demonically energetic.
Russell could delight in the luxury of a
rustic childhood but in 1930 the
Morrisonville women’s lives “were
hard, endless labor”. They carried water
from the spring, scoured the slop
buckets, cooked preserves, made the
butter and were mostly pregnant
when they did it. When they heard of a
woman dropping dead somewhere, they
reached for one of the hundreds of
maxims that governed their lives: Man
is born to toil and woman is born to
suffer. Baker absorbed many more.
Living by maxims, rather than ques-
tioning them, produces well-behaved
people. The widowed Mrs Baker, first
sharing her brother’s Newark flat and
then eking out a separate existence in
Baltimore with food relief drawn home
in a shopping cart which Russell and
she covered with their sweaters to defy
gossip, supported Roosevelt. But, like
the rest of her family, she never ques-
tioned the system or much else besides.
Fascists and communists might
clash, Trotsky be assassinated, refugees
pour into America but the 30s for the
Bakers were small print: macaroni and
cheese every night, two salesmen being
sacked so that Uncle Allen could work
for less than the wage of one.
Strengthened by their Democrat
humor and civility, the Bakers endured
to better days when Russell beginning
his rites of passage and the struggle to
“make something of himself’ - dis-
lodges himself from his mother’s grip.
His ambition, as with every other scrib-
bler of the 30s, was to write like
Hemingway - not an easy task for a
humorist. Baker became instead one of
the top essayists of his generation, re-
joicing in his ability to make people
laugh, awarded the Pulitzer Prize, syn-
dicated to newspapers worldwide.
This tribute to his forebears, how-
ever, is a serious one acknowledging
their drive, kindness, warmth and ten-
acity. Baker’s mother, orbiting in an-
other time, may say in the closing lines
that she has never heard of her son but
his book braids their generations
together and reaches out to the next
with a civilising humanity. □
Gloria Frydman: how ordinary Poles live
A socialist
faces the
real world
By EDMUND CAMPION
Poles Apart, by Gloria Frydman.
River Seine Publications, $8.50.
POLAND, so the saying goes, is a
country with its body in the East, its
head in the West and its heart in the
Vatican.
Gloria Frydman is a Melbourne left-
ist who lived in Poland for six months in
1981 with her two sons and her Polish-
born husband, Karol. This book, pub-
lished by the multicultural press River
Seine, is an account of their life in
Poland while the Solidarity-govern-
ment confrontation was building to its
climax.
Coming from a Jewish background,
the Frydmans show no more than a pol-
ite interest in Polish Catholicism. Nor
can the author say much about what
was going on inside Polish heads be-
cause she could not speak or read the
language. The strength of her book lies
necessarily in its account of how ordi-
nary Poles live from day to day.
The Frydmans had three months in a
Warsaw flat. The rest of the time they
roamed round the country. Keeping
their eyes and ears open, they were
able to get a closer picture of everyday
life than is available to official visitors
on sponsored tours. And, because of
Karol’s Polish origin, their time in Po-
land was no mere tourist jaunt.
They were delighted at the easy ac-
cess to concerts and opera, with tickets
costing not more than a dollar or two.
The Frydman'boys found much to inter-
est them in local culture clubs and
neighborhood centres. Unlike most
tourists, the Frydmans had to shop each
day. They found food cheap and cloth-
ing of better quality than they had ex-
pected.
Despite the hard times, Poles they
met were confident that their country
would ride out the storm. Ordinary,
Poles seemed less obsessed by the Soli-
darity challenge than were the western
media. At a camp site, Karol often was
the only one watching the long tele-
vision programs on politics.
The shortage of goods exasperated
the Frydmans. Seemingly, one had to
queue for everything from meat to
lavatory paper. Goods often were out of
stock. Scarce goods began to be
rationed. Foreigners such as the
Frydmans lacked ration books.
Gloria refused to despond. As a left-
ist, she was attuned to sense an air of
popular achievement and communal
pride. She liked the socialist slogans on
the billboards: “The Future Belongs to
the Forces of Peace and Socialism” or
“We are all Managers of our Country.”
Fine sentiments these, she thought so
preferable to the western commercials
for petrol or potato chips.
Because of this idealism in the air,
she was quite unprepared for the surli-
ness of the people she met. The only
person in their apartment building to
greet them was a priest who tried out his
English on the boys. Women workers in
government offices would ignore them
and go on with their long conversations.
Shop assistants treated them like dirt.
The Frydmans found it a sobering
thought that, in a socialist economy, no
one had to try harder.
So, like many travel books, this one
tells a reader as much about the travel-
lers as about the places they visit. Its
aim of acquainting Australian readers
with modern Poland could have been
improved by tighter editing, even if this
meant turning a book-length manu-
script into a couple of magazine articles.
Beyond that, Poles Apart is a valuable
record of the pride and puzzlement a
contemporary socialist feels when she
gets out of the discussion groups and
into reality. □

BOOK BULLETIN
by Patricia Role
Rodney Marsh’s second innings
PERHAPS BUOYED by Harry M.
Miller, who is agent for former Test
wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh, Penguin
is doing an initial 40,000 for Marsh’s
biography, Gloves, Sweat and Tears,
coming on August 27 in time for
Father’s Day, at $4.95. The previous
Bowled Lillee, Caught Marsh may have
sold around 80,000 and Penguin is op-
timistic about getting that figure for
Gloves, Sweat and Tears by Christmas.
Marsh, who has written in collaboration
with Austin Robertson, is fairly frank
about fellow cricketers Lillee, the Chap-
pells and Kim Hughes, about the
possibilities of his return to Test cricket
if he were made captain and about some
of his drinking feats, such as equal
scoring with Doug Walters: 45 cans of
beer between Sydney and London.
THIS YEAR’S ABC Boyer lectures, by
expatriate writer Shirley Hazzard, may
be gentler in tone than some but will be
forthright nonetheless. Hazzard will be
here this month to continue preparation
for the lectures in which she will talk
about growing up here in the 1930 s and
1940 s and the intolerance to outside in-
fluences she believes was prevalent then.
Peter Morton, of ABC Talks, says that
these days Hazzard keeps herself very
much up to date with what is happening
here. Macmillan has nothing of hers in
hardback but Penguin has reissued
The Bay of Noon, Evening of the Holiday
and Transit of Venus in paperback.
GRAHAM GREENE’S new book, Get-
ting to Know the General, will come
from Jonathan Cape on October 2, the
author’s 80th birthday. It is being pub-
lished in time for the US presidential
election, although even Greene’s most
devout fans would not believe that the
book, condemnatory of US policies in
central America, will make a damned
bit of difference to the result.
Getting to Know the General is about
Greene’s friendship with Omar Torrijos
who, having taken power in Panama in
1968, invited Greene there in 1976.
Greene continued to visit Panama until
Torrijos’s death in a plane crash in 1981.
The brilliant set piece is Greene’s ac-
count of his visit to Washington as the
guest of Torrijos for the signing of the
Panama Canal treaty with President
Jimmy Carter.
IN THE 19605, being a writer in resi-
dence at a university was pleasant. The
odd glass of sherry and a bit of polite
conversation with the faculty from time
to time was all that was needed to earn
your keep for a few months, even a year.
Now writers have moved down through
colleges and schools into the commu-
nity. This can be hard work.
Communities as far flung as the Wil-
liamstown dockyard, Melbourne,
Queenstown in Tasmania, Nambour in
Queensland and Kalamunda in the hills
behind Perth are involved. The Austra-
lia Council helps most projects but
Kalamunda was the initiative of the
shire council. The writers Andrew
Lansdown and Peter Bibby are there for
six weeks to see what comes out of it;
perhaps a book.
In Queenstown, playwright Graham
Pitts and the Salamanca Theatre Com-
pany have been holding workshops, de-
veloping plays about the area’s mining
history. Art historian Humphrey
McQueen is giving courses in Tasmania,
covering such matters as literary agents,
and the writer and TV.
It may all sound faintly piddling, but
Thomas Shapscott, director of the Aus-
tralia Council’s Literature Board, is a
strong supporter. He sees great value in
writers getting out into the community
and points to his recent Canadian ex-
perience when he saw what happened at
Blyth, a village of 1000 people. What
began as one playwright in the commu-
nity evolved into The Farm Show which
has toured Canada and been seen by
500,000 people in a season. □
Graham Greene: condemning US policies


OPERA
A chilly
night
at the AO
By BRIAN HOAD
FOR ITS sixth amazing spectacle of the
current Sydney season, the Australian
Opera came up with The Piqued Dame,
a music drama in three acts, a prologue,
an epilogue and an afterthought.
Actually it was billed as a revival of
Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann. The
occasion was the 10th anniversary of the
first apperance with the company of
Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge
in that same work. Flowers, balloons,
panegyrics in the program notes and
other desperate efforts were made to
create a party atmosphere.
But bruised egos sustained during re-
cent sessions of back-stage musical
chairs in which Bonynge lost his seat
as the company’s musical/artistic direc-
tor were still showing. Ad-
vertisements offering the
maestro’s batons for sale as
“rare collector’s items” at a
mere $250 suggested a liqui-
dation sale.
Sutherland as the doll
Olympia, the courtesan
Giulietta, the consumptive
Antonia and the diva Stella
remained Sutherland in chilly
work-to-rule mood: the voice
in fabulous form; every note
(but one) and action correct;
and a complete lack of that
outgoing warmth and gener-
osity of spirit which has
created so many unforgettable
nights of opera over the past
decade.
How could it have been
otherwise? The company’s
board of directors had done
the dirty on her husband and
she was not amused.
If, as so often in the past,
Sutherland’s usual good
humor has been seen to in-
spire an entire production,
here the lack of it froze one.
Horst Hoffmann, a strap-
ping, strong-voiced tenor im-
ported from Germany as the
new leading man, caught cold
from the start and battled with
huskiness all evening.
Jonathan Summers as
Hoffmann’s evil adversaries
sang flawlessly, made all the right ges-
tures but made no dramatic impact. The
same chilly fate befell the impressive
contributions of Bernadette Cullen as
Hoffmann’s muse and companion. The
comic capers of Graeme Ewer as the
three grotesques had never seemed less
amusing.
With a final sour note (a sort of oper-
atic raspberry) the angry diva Stella
sailed from the scene to return as the
angry diva Sutherland, unimpressed by
a cascade of carnations from the stalls, a
burst of balloons from the pit and the
sudden appearance on stage of the en-
tire Australian Opera (with the tactful
exception of the directors), edging for-
ward nervously as if The National
Treasure were about to explode and
vanish or at least throw a mad scene and
pull a knife.
But no. Sutherland commanded and
received special recognition for conduc-
tor Bonynge, gave or denied embraces
to selected members of the company
and made a terse little speech of the
what’s-all-the-fuss-about sort. After a
long standing ovation of sympathetic
devotion, the audience was dismissed to
ponder what had happened.
To aid this exercise the management
thoughtfully had provided a list of the
56 productions with which Sutherland
Joan Sutherland in The Tales of Hoffmann: a work-to-rule mood
and/or Bonynge have been involved di-
rectly at the Australian Opera. And to
step back only one night to the fifth
amazing spectacle of the season was to
ponder again the Bonynge taste for friv-
olity.
On that occasion the company
offered a new and witty production of
Gilbert and Sullivan’s 35-minute can-
tata, Trial by Jury; a banal piece of flut-
ter for two dancers to the tune of
Offenbach’s Le Papillon; and a revival
of Offenbach’s incomprehensible piece
of high-camp buffoonery, Ba-ta-clan
an excellent program for a late 19th-
century music hall.
At the same time it was far more
amusing than frivolities from the past
such as Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera or
Piccinni’s La Buona Figliuola. In
Lehar’s The Merry Widow and Strauss’s
Die Fledermaus, the frivolous Bonynge
came up with a couple of money-spin-
ners. And once, in Auber’s deliciously
dotty Fra Diavolo, he excavated a for-
gotten gem.
With The Beggar’s Opera you can
pick up the thread of another Bonynge
peccadillo. Its production here was used
as a sort of rehearsal for his recording of
it elsewhere. Other such impositions in-
cluded Verdi’s early tub-thumper, /
Masnadieri, and Thomas’s tedious
Hamlet.
Hamlet also reflected
Bonynge’s love of French op-
era, an area neglected until his
arrival. Memorable additions
since included Bizet’s Carmen
and Massenet’s Manon.
According to personal
taste, many have argued that
there was too much of this,
too little of that. Unarguable
achievements included strong
new productions of Verdi’s La
Traviata and II Trovatore,
Donizetti’s Lucia di
Lammermoor, Mozart’s Don
Giovanni, Handel’s Alcina ...
Yet in recent years even
strong new productions soon
tended to fall apart as artistic
standards slipped and with
them went the morale of resi-
dent artists.
With Bonynge out of the
country for half the year and
the rest of the management
preoccupied with dollars, the
decline was explicable if inex-
cusable. Some second-rate
production teams shipped in
from abroad for today and
gone tomorrow didn’t help.
Endless rumors of nepotism
and favoritism peppered the
growing mess.
Something had to be done
and was, crudely. What’s to
come is still unsure. □

The demons that haunt
the long-run truckies
A big rig Melbourne-bound: The Road breeds restless individualism with a hefty chunk of paranoia
A truckie’s life is a never-ending race to meet instalments to the finance
companies, punctuated by close calls with death and collapsing insurance
companies, BRUCE STANNARD found when he took to The Road.
AT 2 O CLOCK on a miserably cold
and wet Melbourne morning, Charlie
Hastings sat slumped over black coffee
in the diner at Truck City, a gaudy,
neon-lit truckies’ oasis at Campbellfield
on the city s northern outskirts. His
$99,000 Ford Louisville, a huge red-
white-and-blue-striped brute, stood
silent in the gloom of the lot.
Hastings had long since doubled his
22-tonne maximum load but the steel,
bound for Brisbane, would have to wait
until he had about 60 tonnes gross. Only
when the forwarders made up the differ-
ence would he be certain of at least
doubling the $1496 he would ordinarily
get for the 1680 km trip north.
The long run up the Newell Highway
would, he figured, take no more than 24
hours non-stop even allowing for de-
tours through the back roads to avoid
the scalies who man the highway
truck-weight checking stations.
astings is used to breaking the law;
e is, after all, a truck driver and these
ays that often is a synonym for a deep-
ly troubled man. All this law-breaking
was, for Hastings, a matter of dire
necessity. When he lost the $ll,OOO pre-
mium he had paid to cover the new
Louisville, he was forced to scrape up
another $7OOO for fresh insurance - all
that after he had borrowed close to
$BO,OOO at 15.5 percent to finance it.
Like many of his mates, Hastings is a
victim of the great insurance shake-out.
After the Bishopsgate fraud, three
other heavy motor vehicle insurers
Crest, Fleet and Convoy crashed in
quick succession, taking with them hun-
dreds of owner-drivers who had in-
vested all their savings in heavily-
mortgaged rigs. Some of the men will
never recover either financially or,
one suspects, mentally - from the sud-
den loss of such an idiosyncratic
lifestyle.
Truckies like to tell you that The
Road breeds a peculiarly restless indi-
vidualism. It does, but with it goes a
hefty chunk of paranoia.
“You look at a bloke like me,”
Hastings said, “and you see a big, tough
truckie. But I can tell you I cry, mate. I
cry just like a bloody baby when I think
of what I’ve got hanging over this ugly
head of mine. People say we’re like a
pack of mad dogs always tear-arsing up
the road; if they had half the pressure I
cop, I reckon they’d tear-arse too.”
Hastings has a wife in Sydney whose
factory hand’s wages are needed when
the going gets rough and that’s most
of the time. “She is the one who keeps
me going,” he said. “There are plenty of
times when I think it’s all too much. But
she knows how I love the road. It’s
queer, isn’t it? Here I am busting a gut
over something that will probably end
up killing me and yet I love it. What
would the trick cyclists (psychiatrists)
make of that?”
The encounter with Hastings came at
the end of an exhausting 900 km truck
ride from Sydney. Colin Burdett, who
twice a week runs a car transporter be-
tween Sydney and Melbourne, had writ-
ten to The Bulletin complaining about
the near misses with holiday traffic
which very nearly cost him his life on
the Queen’s Birthday weekend. Copies


of the letter went to all the major news
organisations in Australia. The Bulletin
was the only one to accept Burdett’s in-
vitation to ride.
Burdett was not, on first sight, in-
spiring. Lumbering out of Sydney’s
Commonwealth Wool Stores, he
resembled the Michelin tyre man
roly-poly beneath a navy blue
turtleneck sweater and greasy dunga-
rees. His hair, straight as a plumb bob,
hung down in a Beatle-cut and he
peered through thick dark glasses.
But, once behind the wheel of his
Nissan diesel, Burdett underwent a mir-
aculous transformation. Without so
much as a sigh, he gently steered the
enormous rig through a maze of narrow
suburban streets between Botany and
the Hume Highway at Liverpool. A for-
mer motor mechanic, he has
been an owner-driver on the
Sydney-Melbourne run for
more than four years. His
truck is a no-nonsense olive
green with no chrome, no
lights and no fancy emblems
and signs.
If it was at first disconcert-
ing to find myself perched
more than 2m above the road,
it was doubly so to be told not
to worry about seat belts.
Burdett confessed that he had
only lap belts which would, in
any case, do nothing more
than propel my skull through
his dashboard in the event of
a smash.
“Relax, enjoy the ride,” he
said, “and keep your eyes
open for the ratbags out there
trying to kill us.” Burdett’s
indeed, most truckies’ idea
MARK GIBSON/ TRUCKIN' LIFE Magazine
Many truckies faced crises when three insurers crashed after the Bishopsgate fraud
of heaven is an unbroken freeway with
no tourist-motorists.
He lit the first of 60 Camels he would
smoke during the next 12'/ 2 hours and
launched into a litany of horror stories
about crashes, decapitations, inciner-
ations and near misses on the route they
call the Rocket Run.
An outsize dummy, big enough to
satisfy the most cantankerous monster
child, swung from his rear-vision mir-
ror; it made me wonder whether some-
one had not tried to silence him with a
none-too-subtle hint. But Burdett’s
stories were all unfortunately true. Life
through a trucker’s eyes is a constant
Star Wars battle with alien invaders in
the form of family sedans overtaking at
140km/h, swinging in hard and braking
just in time to avoid a head-on.
Colin Burdett: heaven is a road without tourist-drivers
“Caravaners are the worst,” he said.
“You see them wobbling about all over
the place. They’re accidents looking for
a place to happen.” As if to emphasise
the point, a car hauling a big white cara-
van pulled into the gravel to allow us to
pass. Double yellow lines made that im-
possible and, instead, a shower of stones
flew up at the truck’s windshield. Later,
just outside Goulburn, another caravan-
toting car crossed double yellow lines to
overtake us.
“They’re worst when they’re going
downhill,” Burdett said. “That’s when
they get the wobbles but, instead of ac-
celerating gently out of trouble, you see
drivers trying to brake.
“That’s when the caravan is likely to
flip clean over. Pity help the budgie in
the cage in the back.”
Truckies do seem to be an
embattled mob on the road.
Nothing, it seems, infuri-
ates another motorist more
than to be stuck behind a
truck.
“I see them in the rear-
view mirror,” Burdett said.
“They come rushing up and
sit centimetres from my
bumper, darting in and out
looking for an opening as if
their very lives depended on
it.
“And, if they can’t get
around, pretty soon you’ve
got six or eight cars back there
with drivers all having cardiac
arrests because they think
they’re going to be late.
“I’m not a mean bugger; I
oblige them by going faster.
But then what happens? A
copper comes along and who


do you think gets the ticket? Muggins
up here, that’s who.”
Burdett must by now know every po-
liceman between Sydney and Mel-
bourne. He has been fined a total of
$l7OO over the past 12 months for ex-
ceeding the 80km/h highway speed
limit by up to lOlkm/h.
The latest offence means that he will
almost certainly lose his licence for six
months, in which case he would simply
hire a replacement driver and go back
to mending other drivers’ trucks.
One of the more astonishing realisa-
tions that quickly dawns on a trucking
neophyte is CB radio’s role in the net-
work of police evasion on the road. The
radio, used in conjunction with radar
detectors, gives the truckies a very de-
tailed picture of where the police are
and what they are up to.
“Double bubble south-
bound out of Goulburn” can
mean only one thing. This sort
of intelligence is swapped
freely among truck drivers
who have never met and yet
have developed almost inti-
mate relationships by virtue
of their constant criss-cross-
ing on the highway. Language
much of it fiercely profane
invariably invokes the great
Australian epithet “mate” and
yet, if a trucker breaks down,
he can usually expect help
from no one but towtruck op-
erators.
“I’d stop and give a bloke a
hand if I was asked,” Burdett
said, “but most blokes would
reckon I’m a mug. They’ve all
got deadlines and I’ve yet to
see the truckie who was com-
fortably ahead of schedule.
There are freight-forwarding companies
who fine their drivers if they arrive even
an hour late.
“Everyone out here knows that, if
they can’t perform, there is a stack of
blokes just waiting to take their place.”
Although most of the truckies are
magnificent professional drivers, speed,
speed and more speed seems to domi-
nate life on the road. Although we had
been going since 10am, there was no
question of our stopping for lunch.
Even after we paused at a wrecker’s
yard in Goulburn to pick up three
smashed cars, the significance of those
grisly wrecks riding along behind us did
nothing to slow us down. We stopped
eventually at Mick and Mavis Fay’s
Shell roadhouse at Gundagai at 4.30 pm.
Mrs Fay, a fiery redhead with
Cleopatra eyeliner, a blue check
lumberjacket and black slacks tucked
into fur-lined boots, is a former trans-
Nullarbor truckie who runs the place
like a homey guesthouse. The picture of
domestic tranquillity which includes a
roaring log fire and a yellow budgie
dozing among synthetic flowers in a
clear plastic dome is designed to ease
“the boys” down from all that energy-
sapping nervous tension on the road.
“The first thing they want is either a big
pot of strong black coffee or a long, hot
shower,” she said. “Then, after they’ve
freshed up, they’ll attack a decent steak.
We cut our own, so they know it’s good.
I give them lots of fresh veges, too. For a
lot of the blokes, it’s probably the only
decent meal they allow themselves on
the Sydney-Melbourne run.”
Mrs Fay sees that the truckies leave
nothing on their plates. “What’s wrong
with those carrots?” she bellowed at a
driver twice her size. “Eat ’em! They’re
good for your eyes.”
She said: “I have to be mother con-
Truck City, Campbellfield: the beginning of The Road
DON McPHEDRAN
fessor, nurse and kindly aunty to all
these blokes. We’re open 24 hours every
day of the year so they know that they’ll
cop a bit of tea and sympathy here.”
The final run into Melbourne was
among the most frightening journeys
that I’m likely to make.
There is something weirdly exciting
about hurtling through an inky void
with nothing but the road ahead dimly
visible. On the northern approaches to
Melbourne we must have been going
very close to 140km/h. Speed signs,
their warning messages ignited by the
headlights, flared up and flew by and
the northbound trucks whooshed by
like multi-colored meteors.
Burdett had by this time been
driving, with only minor halts, for
something like 27 hours. He had left his
Craigieburn (Vic) home at 7.30 thepre-
vious night and driven to Sydney with a
load of Toyotas. As usual, he allowed
himself only the one stop at Gundagai
where he consumed a pot of coffee and
two steak sandwiches.
Although the night was bitterly cold
now, he was careful to leave his window
down so that a constant stream of air
whistled across the stubble on his face.
“This is where a lot of blokes come
unstuck,” he said. “There is a great
temptation to kick on when you see the
glow of the city lights up ahead. But,
when you feel yourself drifting off,
you’ve really got no choice but to pull
over even if it’s for 20 minutes. I’ve
fallen asleep at the wheel plenty of
times.
“The sunlight warms the cabin and
sends you off. The first clue is that
there’s no noise. It’s as if the engine has
quietly faded away and you’re drifting
off into space. It’s all very pleasant until
you suddenly snap out of it and you
realise you’re out there in the middle of
the road.”
Burdett says he does not
take drugs to keep himself go-
ing but that he knows plenty
of other truckies who do.
Anoretic drugs such as
Tenuate, Dospan and
Duromine are used in con-
junction with decongestants
such as Ephadrine to suppress
appetite, act as a stimulant
and keep the drivers wide
awake for up to 48 hours at a
stretch.
‘‘You can’t blame the
truckies for taking drugs,” he
said; “they are simply re-
sponding to the pressure ap-
plied by the freight-for-
warders and they, in turn, are
responding to the situation in
which the state rail authorities
undercut our cartage rates by
50 percent.
“The truckers’ biggest en-
emy is the railways.
“Who would send freight to Brisbane
by road for $l5OO when the same load
by rail is going to cost only $700? Of
course, it gets knocked around on rail
but shippers are prepared to risk that
because the rates are so cheap.
“Politicians and the public can howl
all they like about the behaviour of
truckies on the road but things are not
going to improve until the government
does something about equalising road-
rail freight rates. At a stroke, that would
take the pressure off the drivers. There
would be no more drugs, no need to
tear-arse and a lot less risk to ordinary
motorists. It’s a pipe dream, of course.
No politician has the guts to do some-
thing as imaginative as that, which is
why we’re all condemned to keep on
truckin’.
“Next time you tootle down a high-
way and you feel a big Kenworth
breathing down your neck, spare a
thought for the poor bastard behind the
wheel ... Some of us are human.” □

All the dope on banned sport drugs
US swimmer Rick De Mont: disqualified in Montreal after winning gold
UPI
Daniel Munez: lost gold in Caracas
By MIKE AGOSTINI
BEHIND THE gold and
glory of the Olympics is a hid-
den world of illicit drugs and
other secret techniques for en-
suring success. During the
games a clandestine battle will
be waged between conserva-
tive authority trying to stem
the increasing illegal use of
drugs and science and people
whose only interest is victory
regardless of health risks.
News of this battle will sur-
face only if a prominent
sportsman or woman is
caught and banned for use of
drugs or methods which are
restricted.
Besides the glamor of win-
ning medals, there is much
potential for commercial gain
through success at the games.
There are also political mo-
tives for winning which in
themselves may offer personal
benefits far outweighing the extrinsic
value of medals which are made of mere
gilded alloys.
The absence of East European com-
petitors should remove many of the sup-
posed pressures on Western competitors
to use illegal methods for improving
performances. The East Europeans are
alleged leaders in the development and
use of the most sophisticated drugs em-
ployed in sport. Many Westerners
wrongly excuse their own use of such
“I suppose it was only a matter of time
before the Mafia got involved”
substances by stating that they must fol-
low suit if they are to keep abreast of
their Eastern counterparts.
At last year’s Pan American games in
Caracas, Venezuela, at which European
nations did not participate, four
weightlifting medallists were forced to
return their medals when mandatory
post-competition drug tests proved
positive. They were caught because the
testing methods and apparatus used in
Caracas were far ahead of any such
equipment or methods used
previously.
It was probably no coinci-
dence that 13 members of the
US track and field team
mostly in throwing events
where muscle bulk and
strength can be enhanced
through illegal drug use
suddenly decided to fly home
early.
The authorities won the
battle of Caracas but athletes,
their coaches and assisting
doctors won’t be caught quite
so easily in Los Angeles.
I’m glad that my own
Olympic career occurred in
the 50s when the strongest
substances we knew of, and
were prepared to use, were
amphetamines. Prescription
drugs such as Dexedrine were
used by many of the great
Olympic champions of the
early post-World War II period.
I was introduced to Dexedrine by a
group of hard-living, fun-loving Olym-
pic gold medallists from the Caribbean
and the USA who called it pepper. You
could go without food, feel full of en-
ergy, perform amazing physical feats,
drink copious quantities of beer after
competition and not feel tired until
hours later. When fatigue struck, you
fell into a deep slumber and would feel
battered and beaten for days.


“Good news, you guys! The Ruskies have had a last minute change of heart!"
The scene now is much more sophis-
ticated and potentially deadly. The list
of drugs and banned substances for
which constant checking will occur in
Los Angeles includes:
ALCOHOL: It is on the prohibited list for
the first time because it can be used as a
central nervous system (CNS) depress-
ant. It is said to be used by shooters to
steady their hands and to benefit run-
ners because of its mild sedating effects
if taken the night before. As well as pro-
viding energy, beer is high in vitamins
and minerals.
anabolic STEROIDS: Employed medical-
ly to promote weight gain in patients
with serious debilitating disease or after
cancer operations, anabolic steroids are
used to add weight and muscle to
weightlifters and throwers and partici-
pants in other sports requiring power
and muscle. Side-effects include hair
growth in both males and females,
masculinisation of females along with
disturbance of menstrual functions, pre-
cocious puberty, growth retardation
and, in some instances, risk of severe
liver damage and jaundice which can
sometimes kill. These were the first of
the modern drugs to be widely
publicised and also tested for in sport.
BETA-BLOCKERS: Prescribed for patients
with various forms of coronary heart
disease, beta-blockers are designed to
reduce tremors, slow down heart rates
and decrease oxygen demand in the
muscles. They may also help relieve
anxiety thus they can be useful for
shooters, archers and others who want
more muscle control under tension.
Beta-blockers also have many potential-
ly dangerous, and occasionally fatal,
side-effects, particularly among people
who have undiagnosed forms of heart
disease, diabetes, asthma and some ner-
vous ailments.
CAFFEINE: This stimulant of the central
nervous system reduces' sensitivity to
fatigue and helps in the breakdown of
body fat. It also conserves body sugar
and, thus, possibly increases total po-
tential energy from stored body
supplies. The amount taken to break the
rules requires considerably more coffee
than anyone would normally drink. A
dose of about 600 mg the equivalent of
six cups of coffee and 12 cups of tea
would probably produce the illegal level
of 15mg per ml of urine.
NARCOTIC ANALGESICS: This group in-
cludes codeine which can be found in
many pain-relief drugs available with-
out prescription in Australia. These
drugs decrease pain awareness and, in
small to moderate doses, lower inhibi-
tion and produce euphoria. Olympians
must be extremely careful in what they
use for normal pain relief or risk dis-
qualification for illegal drug usage.
PSYCHOMOTOR STIMULANTS: Included
among these are amphetamines, such as
Dexedrine and Benzedrine and cocaine.
These drugs increase alertness and en-
ergy if taken in small amounts and re-
duce pain and fatigue sensitivity. Larger
doses can induce aggressiveness and
hostility. Death can occur as a result of
overstimulation, as happened in the
1960 Olympics to long-distance Danish
cyclist Nils Jensen.
SYMPATHETIC AMINES: These drugs mimic
the effects of adrenalin which flows nat-
urally in “fight or flight” situations
where increased heart rates, greater
blood flow to the muscles and agitation
may be required. Many drugs used
medically to treat asthma fall within this
category. Asthmatics must be cautious
in what they use even if by prescription.
American swimmer Rick de Mont lost
his 400 m gold medal in Montreal in
1976 when he was found to have used
one of these drugs for an asthmatic con-
dition. The gold went to Australian
Brad Cooper.
TESTOSTERONE: This natural male hor-
mone has both anabolic (muscle-build-
ing) and androgenic (masculinising)
properties. It is normally present in
males and occasionally in a few women.
Testosterone is often used to replace an-
abolic steroids nearing competition
time because it can maintain muscle size
and strength even with relatively small,
legal dosages. The tests are for abnor-
mally high levels.
HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE: This is the
most recent drug being used for increas-
ing size but will not be included in the
tests in Los Angeles. It comes from the
pituitary glands of cadavers and can
cost as much as $6O a treatment. One US
university professor athletes
using growth-hormone extracts from
monkeys because of its much lower
cost. The professor claims to have noted
some users already developing ape-like
head and facial features which may or
may not be true.
What is sadly ironic about drug
taking in sport is that some current re-
search suggests that all these drugs do is
trigger the body’s own natural anti-
pain, anti-fatigue or energy-producing
substances rather than actually create
the responses or changes themselves.
This could mean that in the future com-
petitors in major sports may revert to
using hypnosis, yoga and meditation to
achieve the same results without using
drugs.
If there is a way to solve the drug
problem in sports and games, it may be
by teaching people from early child-
hood how to dig deeply within them-
selves to provide the motivation and
stimulus of winning fairly and
squarely. That is what sport used to be
about before these days of big money
and meddling politics. □
How some gain
the edge
SOME competitors will go to
amazing extremes either to gain
the advantage or to avoid detec-
tion.
Blowing fresh air into the
bowels by means of tubes inserted
in the rectum of a swimmer just
before a race is one unusual meth-
od said to be used. The air, it is
claimed, adds buoyancy while re-
ducing drag.
Some East European female
competitors reportedly insert into
their vaginas balloons containing
drug-free urine for test samples.

Francis Prout Mahony probably thought
that fate had been unkind to him. As a
black-and-white artist around the turn
of the century he was well-known in a
number of publications, including The
Bulletin. He was distinguished for his
paintings of horses. He illustrated the
works of Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson
and Adam Lindsay Gordon. But all that
was soon forgotten. When he became
famous it was for his drawings for Dot
and the Kangaroo, by Ethel Pedley. He
died in England in 1916 and since then
his works have been tucked away in
what is legally, and often fancifully,
called his estate. Frank Mahony’s oils,
watercolors and drawings are now be-
ing exhibited by Josef Lebovic, in Pad-
dington, NSW.

tinguished white redskin, recently heard

he moved to the nearby, untrendy fish-
ing village of Patonga, where he bought
a small fibro house with large holes in
its roof, birds in the top of the wardrobe
and an even smaller house out the back.
“This is what comes of spending your
life on literature,” said Kim, whose
third novel, The Chinaman, is out this
month. Kim, a naturalised Australian,
was born in Korea and came to Sydney
in 1961 to study under the Colombo
Plan. Instead of writing a thesis, he
wrote a novel, My Name is Tian, about a
child growing up in Vietnam during the
war. The Chinaman has a happier set-
ting: luxury yachts and cruisers sailing
the Great Barrier Reef. What does Kim
think about Geoffrey Blainey’s remarks
on Asian immigration? Blainey, he re-
plied, was chairman of the Australia
Council Literature Board which gave
him a senior literary fellowship in 1974.
And: “I’m glad the issue was raised at
that level, where at least there is room
for logical debate, rather than at the
street level.”

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
I just lap up this computer
BACK ON April 24 we reported that
typewriters were finished. Batman had
bought himself a computer, double disk
drive and all. The new era was to work
with a word processor program and the
world of the floppy disk.
That was April. But you can’t live
with just a single computer. If you are to
be up with the trendies, the latest in the
world of bytes, you must also have a lap
computer.
It is a darling thing. It will fit in your
briefcase and you can literally operate it
on your lap, sitting in an aeroplane,
dozing in an armchair or sitting on the
dunny.
Mine is a Tandy TRSBO Model 100
and it cost nearly $lOOO. You know how
it is; a week after I bought it they
dropped the price $2OO. It is made in
Japan and NEC have a model that is
almost identical. That has been selling
for $699. In the computer world it is
nearly always a good idea to wait until
next week.
Now these lap computers are the true
marvels of the computer revolution.
Most newspapers are buying them for
their reporters. The Melbourne Herald
has 20 NECs. The Sydney Morning Her-
ald is using them and so is The Courier-
Mail in Brisbane.
The real black magic is that you can
send your copy over the telephone. You
just put your telephone receiver into a
modem coupler, press a button on your
lap computer and all your copy goes
into the Big Brother computer at the
office.
This means that anywhere in the
world where there is a telephone you
can send your copy “Zap.”
Good grief, when I think of the
agonies we used to suffer, finding a post
office, finding a telecommunications
office, pleading often with over-worked
postmasters to get our stories on the
wire.
In 1979 in California I received a
Teleram. This was supposed to be port-
able. It would break your arm just to lift
it. It had to be powered into the mains
circuit and if you were going to use a
public telephone you had to use a long
lead to someone kind enough to provide
the power. But the new lap computers
work off batteries and they will do
things utterly beyond the ken of the old
Telerams.
For a start, your lap computer is
about the size of one of those little port-
able typewriters. It has a screen and it
has a memory which varies accordng to
how much you are prepared to pay.
Mine will hold about 20,000 words. But
you can take along a tape recorder and
store extra material on tape. You also
need a printer to print out your ma-
terial.
But the beauty of lap computers is
that they are easy. I mean, the software
is built in and you don’t need a three-
week course to learn how to work the
darned thing.
They’re marvellous when you’re
travelling. You can enter all your names
and addresses; uncles, aunts, girl-
friends. Then when you want a tele-
phone number you press the “Find”
button. You might say: “Find Gert.”
Gert’s phone number comes up on the
screen instantly. Fantastic.
You can put in your entire schedule.
Tell the computer to give you Sep-
tember 3 and up comes your entire pro-
gram for September 3. I just enter stuff
higgledy-piggledy. I give * as the sym-
bol for petrol. But when I tell the lap
computer to find * up comes a complete
list of what I have spent on petrol.
I guess I have a weakness for
gadgets. I couldn’t live without a digital
watch. I even like electric stoves with
automatic programs. The gadget disease
is hard to eradicate.
And there’s a lot more gadgetry to
the lap computer. You can put in a cal-
culator program. You can have a pro-
gram that tells you instantly how many
words you have written. Then there’s a
writer program which will give you tabs,
create a beautiful letter-writing scene
and automatically number the pages for
you.
The screen is big enough for editing,
tidying up, inserting lines and transfer-
ring them elsewhere. It tells you the
exact time and the date.
I have a friend who has Big Ben
chimes on his lap computer. It chimes
on the quarter and the half hour. Then
on the hour it gives the Big Ben chimes
and chimes out the hour. Not quite the
majestic, sonorous tones of Big Ben it-
self but at least a computer imitation.
Failings: Well, it eats batteries, al-
though you can also plug it into the
mains. Also you have to wait until you
get home to do your print-outs.
My lap computer is compatible with
my big computer. They talk to each
other most beautifully. I can take stuff
out of the lap job and store it all perma-
nently on floppy disk in the big com-
puter.
My wife occasionally says quietly
that this is the only communication in
our house; one computer talking to an-
other.
But no matter what you buy you will
be obsolete. Already there are later
model lap computers, jobs with bigger
screens that fold out and even have
built-in tapes to store that extra mem-
ory.
I guess in another six months I will
be as out of date as my old typewriter. □


Getting to the bottom of a new treaty
PHILLIP ADAMS
AS WELL AS being spiritual father to
us Australian Fabians, my old mate
Race Matthews is a minister in John
Cain’s government, his portfolio con-
taining, like some over-stuffed suitcase,
the police, the fire brigade and the arts.
Or, as someone suggested recently,
the plods, the pyromaniacs and the
poofters.
Well, the other day Race invited me
to lunch with his more-or-less opposite
number from Norway, the charming
Minister for Arts and Science, and the
appropriately distinguished Norwegian
ambassador.
The minister explained that Norway
resembles New Zealand both scenically
and statistically, the populations being
all but identical. And, to my astonish-
ment, he said that his government re-
jects porn and permissiveness in favor
of stern censorship, making Norway a
conservative oasis amid all that
Scandinavian socialism.
When he bemoaned the fact that pol-
itical and cultural contacts between our
two countries were negligible, I got one
of those dazzling insights that make me,
despite my appalling table manners, in-
dispensable at such official occasions. I
pointed out that while there seems very
little in the export-import area that
could bring us closer together, there’d
soon be a vacancy in the ANZUS treaty.
For a conservative country about the
size of New Zealand. Both ministers
and the ambassador were captivated by
the suggestion. Race pulled out his min-
isterial biro and started preparing a
draft agreement there and then on his
serviette. But, sadly, the whole idea col-
lapsed. I suddenly realised that we
would have to drop the Z. And who’d
want to be signatories to an ANUS
Treaty?
MY MIND goes back to the incident at
Lakeside, when B-b Hawke thought
he’d been shot. There have been two
principal reactions to the incident
general amusement from the cynics and
outrage from the Christians. The flood
of mail from the religiously inclined has
been appalling not a smidgen of sym-
pathy for the man who thought he’d
been assassinated. Just sanctimonious
complaints about his blasphemy, about
a disbeliever using the Lord’s name in
vain.
Are we forgetting that, just a few
years ago, Arthur Calwell narrowly
escaped death by shooting? And judg-
ing by international attempts at assas-
sination, the more popular the leader,
the more likely an attempt. One suspects
that B-b is receiving any number of
death threats, given that Australia now
has enough lunatic fringes to decorate
our entire coastline.
It was interesting that the political
colleagues sitting on either side of the
PM didn’t even flinch at the sound. It
was Hawke who doubled over. And his
subsequent laughter expressed relief,
not amusement.
I had spoken to Hawke a few days
earlier, just after the press conference
he’d convened on the Family Court
bombing. He was still shaken and angry
from that atrocity. And I’ve heard from
other sources that at least one senior
minister and his family are under 24-
hour police guard as a result of threats
and a series of attacks on their home.
These, for obvious reasons, have not
been publicised.
To be a pope, president or prime
minister is to be the target of every other
ratbag. The fear must always be there,
just beneath one’s conscious thoughts.
So rather than criticising B-b for ex-
claiming “Jesus Christ!” he should have
our sympathy and our best wishes. And
instead of writing fatuous letters to the
editor, perhaps Christians could
be encouraged to cry out “Bertrand
Russell!” at times of emotional strain.
THE PRINTING of B-b is not a mis-
print. I’ve decided to adopt this proce-
dure since visiting the great synagogue
in St Kilda a few days ago, to hear the
remarkable voice of a visiting cantor
from Israel. Throughout the program
notes, I noticed that God was printed
G-d, at first putting it down to a hiccup-
ping word processor. But no. It turns
out to be standard practice in Jewish
texts, so that the name of God cannot be
inadvertently destroyed. So from now
on it’s B-b and I’ll save all the Os for the
budget deficit.
A FEW months back, I described Ant-
arctica as being “the only continent on
which a human child has never been
born.” The Minister for Science and
Technology, Barry Jones, tells me that
this is no longer the case. Not content
with invading the Falklands, the cad-
dish Argies actually freighted a preg-
nant woman to their Antarctic base. So
now one child has been born in that
panorama of berg and penguin.
Whether the Argentinians went to all
that trouble for the Guinness Book of
Records or to strengthen their territorial
claims is not entirely clear.
COUNCIL tenants in Doncaster have
been banned from building fall-out
shelters because the Labor Control
Council has declared the borough a nu-
clear free zone.
The Daily Telegraph, London
A POLICE officer kicked a man so hard
in the face that the sole of his boot came
off, it was claimed at Leeds County
Court. The man, Mr John Marshall,
aged 57, was accused of criminal dam-
age to a police boot.

An experimental look at life
DAVID McNICOLL
LAST WEEK I listened to
one of the most unusual
and fascinating stories I’ve
heard for a long time
young Sydney computer
genius Scott Fuller relating
his part in the Micro So-
ciety program being made
by Mike Willesee. It’s a
program which will cause
great interest and contro-
versy when it comes on.
Fifteen diverse people
were taken to a lush sheep
property at Wee Jasper in New South
Wales. They ranged from a capitalist
through housewives, a Vietnamese, a
registered nurse and a grandfather to a
member of the Communist Party. “The
Game,” as it was known, was organised
by Professor Brian Spicer, of Monash
University.
It was a “cash” society. On arrival,
each person drew an envelope contain-
ing “Willesee dollars” in varying num-
bers. This meant some people became
affluent, some poor (Scott Fuller found
himself having to exist on $45 at a
place where the most basic food cost
$5). Food and drink franchises were
auctioned (one went broke). The accom-
modation varied from en suite in the
homestead at $l5O a night to cheap
dossing in the shearers’ quarters.
Everything became very real. There
was no play acting and as the week went
on tense situations arose. There were no
actual fights but very close. To earn
money, the “poor” dug post holes or
cleaned house. The communist, who
had drawn a lot of money, changed
some of his ideas.
At the end of the week, when the
“government” (Prof Spicer) declared
the game over, the “cast,” exhausted
and emotionally drained (some were
near breakdown), felt as though an
enormous weight had been lifted from
them.
Sorting out and analysing the incred-
ible footage of material will be a mighty
job. It will be interesting to see the final
conclusions whether it is possible or
not to manufacture a Utopia.
INTERESTING to return to Australia
and find that the immigration debate is
being dampened by the government
(predictably) and by the media, as
though the whole question of our mi-
grant intake is something which we
should be ashamed to debate. Then I
read the fatuous remarks of Home
A Willesee note,
currency in a
survival game
Affairs Minister Barry Cohen who even
compares the situation with persecution
of the Jews.
Surely there is nothing wrong with a
reasoned debate on our migrant intake.
If anyone doubts its interest to the gen-
eral public, the Morgan Gallup Poll fig-
ures published in this magazine a few
weeks ago should dispel the doubts.
I know the issue is emotional and
should not be allowed to be used by in-
flammatory ratbags. But just consider
the calm remarks of the executive direc-
tor of the Big Brother Movement, Don
MacKinnon, who alleges
that Australian migration
officials in London were
encouraged to dissuade
British applicants under
the family reunion
category. The Big Brother
office had received a flood
of complaints about our
current immigration pol-
icy. MacKinnon said that,
contrary to what had been
said by Immigration Min-
ister Stewart West, appli-
cants from some other
countries did not have to meet the same
criteria or undergo the same processing
as migrants from the United Kingdom
and Europe.
Steps must be taken, said
MacKinnon, to reverse the “anti-Brit-
ish, anti-European” migration policy
that exists at present.
If supporting MacKinnon means
one is a racist, then I’m a racist.
FOR YEARS I’ve heard people talking
about Medicheck but I’ve only just got
around to giving it a fly. It is really a
remarkable set-up; instead of a doctor
questioning you, you sit down and have
a long chat with a computer; a friendly,
understanding computer. Pleasant
nurses, spotless equipment and all over
in a few hours. It costs $145 but you get
most of that back from what’s its name.
Cohen: fatuous remarks
PETER MARS
IF EVER something was
calculated to stir up anti-
British feelings among the
uneducated it was the tele-
vision series which was
supposed to deal with the
cricket bodyline dispute.
Anyone not knowing or
appreciating the inaccuracies of the pro-
duction might well nurse a grudge
against English cricketers and start giv-
ing vent to it when next they visit Aus-
tralia. Bill O’Reilly and others have
dealt pretty thoroughly with the film’s
inaccuracies but one point needs expla-
nation: the “Mr Packer” in the news-
paper office was not the late Sir Frank
but his father, R. C. Packer, one of the
great and innovative editors of the 20s
and 30s.
THE NEXT few weeks are going to be
interesting for followers of turf politics,
particularly Australian Jockey Club
politics.
Bill Gordon, one of the effective
committeemen, has resigned and a sec-
ond committeeman in-
tends turning it in. The
timing of the resignations
means that there will be a
committee “spill” instead
of casual vacancies being
filled without members
having to pass judgment
on all committeemen.
So far, four aspirants
have been mentioned
two of them breeders. It is
possible the field may
eventually see six jockey-
ing for the two vacancies.
It’s a time for AJC members to think
long and deep.
At present the committee largely
comprises graziers, lawyers and
breeders and one bona fide business-
man who is in a rather restricted busi-
ness (chickens). What the committee
needs is some top class business brains
(the Sydney Turf Club has benefited
greatly from such an infusion).
The obvious man is Sir Tristan
Antico, who would bring much needed
acumen to committee deliberations.
There is no doubt he would sail home
and he should be persuaded to stand.
The future of racing is disturbing
many turf followers. The dominance of
breeders (whose influence is pushing up
the prize money in the current absurd
competitive rivalry between clubs) is
one worry. But there are others.

The Olympic Gamesl An ideal of
excellence, a bond amongst nations...
conceived in Ancient Greece in the 6th
century 8.C., revived in 1896 through the
efforts of Pierre de Coubertin, father of the Modern
Olympics. The first Modern Olympics were held in
Athens...only 13 countries participated, including -
astonishingly - Australia, a country still in its infancyl
Since then we have participated with
enthusiasm and often notable success. And in 1956
Melbourne enjoyed the distinction of being the first
city in the Southern hemisphere to host the Games!
An Important collector's piece for your
family. The first plate in any series is considered to
be of special value and this is not only the very first,
but also the official Australian 1984 Olympic Plate.
The central motif depicts the Olympic torch,
proudly held aloft by a bold young athlete, against
a backdrop of the Los Angeles Olympic Stadium...
and includes the Australian Olympic symbol. Artist
Bernard Tate has captured both the intensity and
dignity of the Games with this finely rendered motif,
framed by the official symbols of the past nine
Olympic Games from 1948 to 1980.

Drinking in the past
RON SAW
MY MOTHER, who has been digging
around in the roots of the family tree,
writes to tell me that my great-good-
god-almighty-grandmother was born
Mary Ann Syred in Perth in 1836.
And that 17 years later the hussy
married a comparative dotard of 28, a
merchant named Henry Saw. Ho-hum.
This Henry seems to have been a
merchant the way Sir Charles Lloyd
Jones or the Coles boys were. He had
premises fronting on Hay Street, the
main shopping street of Perth. There
was a store, above which he and Mary
Ann generated six children. On one side
of the store was a woodyard and, on the
other, a large orchard. If you wanted
anything in Perth halfway through the
last century Henry, apparently schooled
by family carpetbaggers from the east,
would sell it to you.
My interest quickened. This modest
property-cum-nursery stretched down
Hay Street to where the Criterion Hotel
now stands. The Cry, as I remember it,
was a good pub but just a pub. It was a
handy stop-off if you were travelling
back to central Perth from the WACA
ground, your mind writhing with details
of cricket or football matches; but if
you had travelled as far as that you
might as well have kept going and had
the one at the Palace or even the
Adelphi.
The Adelphi used to be on the corner
of St George’s Terrace and Mill Street,
where the Parmelia Hilton now stands,
and ... hang on!
This same Mary Ann, says mother
the genealogist, was born on that very
spot in Mill Street.
God bless my heart and soul! As I
work it out I practically own two of
Perth’s most distinguished watering-
holes!
I used to be rather proud of the fact
that the first Saw to land in this country
was a caitiff of some kind who got seven
years from Northampton Assizes for
pinching a ferret or something and
arrived here in the Third Fleet.
Now I find that he spread his seed so
carefully that I more or less own half the
pubs in WA. This is better.
As time went by and the Saws who
were not noted wowsers had more
and more bad nights at the butts and the
tables, that vast stretch of Hay Street,
and that little plot in Mill Street,
dwindled. All that was left when I was a
lad was the Plaza Arcade, between Hay
and Murray Streets, which includes the
Plaza movie theatre.
I do recall that, as a child in short
pants, I went to the Plaza with my
father. They were showing the first run
of Snow Whie and the Seven Dwarfs', my
father walked up and asked for two
complementary tickets.
It was pretty damn cheeky of me but
I asked him why he didn’t pay like
everybody else.
“I don’t suppose they’d ask us to
pay,” he said.
“You mean we’re getting in for nix?
Freeloading?”
“Well, not really. This is our arcade.”
I told him that I didn’t care about all
that: I wasn’t going to stand there wail-
ing for free seats like some ... some
freeloader. And he said that nobody
was asking me to do a damn thing with
my time but spend it without carrying
on like a smarmy little prig; and if I
didn’t like it and, more to the point, if
I wanted him to fetch me a clout on the
ear I could miss Snow White and get
myself to buggery back to school.
I saw then that he was absolutely
right and I allowed myself to suffer the
shame of seeing Snow White without my
father paying. And, in re Henry Saw, I
have presented my case in full.
But Henry’s missus had a pretty firm
hold on the Adelphi, which became the
Parmelia; and Henry’s brother, Thom-
as, built the Narrogin Inn, at Armadale,
WA; and my maternal grandfather,
Sydney Elliot, started and owned the
old Redcastle Brewery at Rivervale and
... damn and blast it, here was one side
of my family owning half the
tosspotteries in the state and the other
half filling the tosspots with ale; here
was my father setting a splendid
example in freeloading and what was I
doing about it all? Nothing.
Had I known, when I lived in Perth,
what I know now I’d have been rather
quicker off the mark: I can imagine my-
self walking into the bar of the Parmelia
or the Cry or the Narrogin Inn and giv-
ing the facts to the barmaid.
And she’d have thrown her apron
over her head and fled to the back of the
pub, squawking: “Lord lawks-a-mercy!
Landlord! Landlord! This nice young
man practically owns the place, or used
to. What do we do now?”
And the publican, honest fellow,
would have tugged his forelock and
asked a few more deferential questions
and said: “God bless you, young sir.
You alone have pretty well saved the
hotel trade of the nation. You’ll take a
schooner or two? Or could I send you
an 18-galloner for lunch?” There’s no
knowing where it all would have ended.
At Mill Street I’d have been a
backslapping buddy of Nicky Hilton
and the jet set. Nicky-baby? Wasn’t he
once married to Elizabeth Taylor? Yes,
of course. Landlord, a middy of port-
and-lemon for the girl; and tell me, Liz,
what d’you hear from Dicky Burton?
You, boy, whatsyername, Bond,
Holmes a Court, fetch a bag of prawns
for Miss Taylor.
So life passed me by in the West. But
there’s still hope for me in Sydney:
I know a woman who always has
been a good sort but who now, I realise
with a start, makes Bo Derek look like a
wizened crone. She says that her family
used to own the land, in Martin Place,
now occupied by the Sydney GPO.
What a lurk we could make of that.

EUROPE
The Risky Dream
Of One Germany
Bonn and East Berlin move closer together. But
warmer ties between the two governments are raising
fears in Moscow that Kohl may try to tempt Honecker
toward neutrality and weaken the Warsaw Pact.
Helmut Kohl, like so many of his West
German constituents, has long had a
dream —the reunification of the two Ger-
manys. Until now, few people outside West
Germany have taken the idea very seriously.
But in recent months Chancellor Kohl and
East German leader Erich Honecker have
been steadily improving ties. And last week
the two governments moved even closer
together: Bonn announced a new “jumbo”
loan to East Berlin that paved the way for a
series of agreements easing travel between
the two countries and improving the
chances of a state visit by Honecker next
month, the first of its kind since the post-
World War II partition. The two German
leaders have become so chummy of late that
commentators in Bonn now refer to the pair
as “The Helmut and Erich Show.”
Not everyone is taking the German rap-
prochement so lightly. Honecker’s Eastern
bloc allies are getting increasingly nervous
about how far the new friendship will go.
The Soviet press has launched several at-
tacks against the Kohl government, accus-
ing Bonn of everything from militarism to
having neo-Nazi “revanchist” designs of
regaining territory lost by Germany after
World War 11. Relations between Bonn and
Moscow were already strained over the de-
ployment of Pershing II NATO missiles in
West Germany last December. But Moscow
may now be more concerned that Kohl will
be able to tempt East Berlin toward neutral-
ity and seriously weaken the Warsaw Pact.
“An attempt is being made to use both eco-
nomic levers and political contacts,” said a
commentary in Pravda last week, “to under-
Honecker with Kohl: A budding friendship—and new warnings from the Kremlin
ADN
Visitors crossing into East Berlin: The lure of German reunification continues to be strong, but the Western Alliance and the Soviet Union unite in opposing the trend
mine the socialist system of the German
Democratic Republic. ’’
Moscow’s attacks have not slowed Kohl’s
drive for warmer relations between Bonn
and East Berlin. German reunification has
become something of an unassailable Mutter
und Strudel issue in West German politics,
and Kohl’s efforts have been highly popular
with West Germans of virtually all political
stripes. Some have criticized the Christian
Democratic leader for not winning enough
concessions from East Berlin in return for
last week’s $333 million government-
backed loan. (“Much quidfor too little quo,”
groused the daily Die Welt.) But even the
political opposition could not fault Kohl’s
basic aim of improving relations with East
Berlin. “We all would have liked to get
more,” said Horst Ehmke, a Social Demo-
cratic Party leader. “But it would be dishon-
est for us not to say that something has been
achieved.”
Kohl’s effort to strengthen relations with
the East Germans has largely been an exer-
cise in Deutsche-mark diplomacy. Last year
he approved a $385 million government-
backed loan to East Berlin to help pay debt
service and subsidize imports. And Bonn


German reunification continues to be strong, but the Western Alliance and the Soviet Union unite in opposing the trend
permitted such West German companies as
Voiks wagen and Siemens to negotiate multi-
million dollar contracts with the East Ger-
mans to build several jointly owned fac-
tories. The strategy has worked. East Berlin
has loosened many of its own policies, espe-
cially its restriction on travel and emigra-
tion, which have long been emotional issues
for the many West Germans who have
friends and relatives living in the East. Last
week the two countries agreed to extend the
time limits for cross-border visits for up to 60
days and to reduce border fees. Honecker
has permitted a record 30,000 East Germans
to emigrate to the West so far this year—
more than twice the number for all of 1983.
And Bonn is confident that the flow will
continue. “We expect several thousand
more to come over in the rest of the year,”
said Philipp Jenninger, a Kohl aide who
handles relations with East Berlin.
Reassurance: Kohl has pursued his Ger-
man-German courtship with Honecker
without any criticism from Washington.
“Our basic feeling is that we trust the West
Germans,” said one U.S. official. “Both
countries are trying to keep relations going
despite East-West tensions.” But closer to
home, many Western European govern-
ments are more worried—mainly over the
still improbable prospect of one Germany,
French President Frangois Mitterrand has
said that “there is no question” that two
Germanys would ever be allowed to reunite.
Bonn has tried to reassure Western Europe
that it is firmly in the alliance. “The Federal
Republic is fully committed to NATO,
Jenninger said. “But genuine political de-
tente between the two Germanys is not in
contradiction to this commitment. ’ ’
That is precisely what worries Moscow
and other members of the Eastern bloc,
When the two Germanys first began to
improve ties, the Soviets had hoped that
Honecker would be able to encourage neu-
tralist, anti-Western elements in West Ger-
many. Instead, the Kremlin now fears that
as East Berlin becomes more and more eco-
nomically dependent upon Bonn, it may
stray from the Soviet orbit. The Federal
Republic is already East Germany’s largest
Western trading partner, accounting for 40
percent of the communist state’s external
trade last year. While there is a core of
support for the Soviets in East Berlin, Mos-
cow has historically rooted insecurities
about the depth of German loyalty. The
Soviets have not warned East Berlin public-
ly, but the harsh media attacks on Bonn
represent a clear signal to Honecker that the
Kremlin s patience is wearing thin,
‘Quagmire’: At least part of the Soviet
campaign against Bonn is sheer superpower
posturing. Moscow may believe that hard-
line tactics could still weaken the Kohl gov-
eminent s resolve to accept the remainder of
its NATO nuclear missiles. Bonn is making
the country sink deeper into the quagmire of
the arms race, which may have fatal conse-
quences for peace and security in Europe,
said Pravda. But Moscow is more concerned
with what it perceives as West Germany’s
growing revanchism, which the Soviets
broadly define as the desire for German
reunification or the return to Germany s
1937 borders. The Soviet media have named
at least 40 members of the West German
Bundestag as revanchists, including such
high-ranking officials as Interior Minister
Friedrich Zimmermann and Hemnch Win-
delen, minister for inter-German affairs.
The short-term future of German detente
will turn mostly on the success ot Hon-
ecker’s planned visit to the West in Septem-

German leader insists on visiting Bonn.
Kohl’s strategists are opposed to that, since
it would force the West German chancellor
to pay a reciprocal visit to East Berlin, which
the Bonn government officially considers an

Bonn officials are predicting more dramatic
steps toward even warmer relations. That

COMMON MARKET
‘Relaunching' Europe
With a Slap at Britain
Barely a month ago, the leaders of the
Common Market ended their Fontaine-
bleau summit with talk of the “relaunching
of Europe. ’ ’ But in a single vote last week, the
European Economic Community’s legisla-
tive arm at least briefly clouded that spirit of
cooperation by blocking payment of $6OO
million in EEC budget rebates to Britain. By
bucking the rebate accord hammered out at
Fontainebleau, the European Parliament
rekindled a dispute that had paralyzed the
Ten —and obsessed British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher —since 1979.
The blocking maneuver will probably be
short lived; it has no backing from Commu-
nity leaders and the Parliament has little real
power. The lopsided vote (212 to 70) was
clearly an attempt to coerce the British into
approving new spending to help overcome
EEC budget deficits. So far, Thatcher has
refused to go along, insisting that the Com-
munity bridge the gap by cutting or postpon-
ing farm subsidies. In the end, London will
almost certainly get its money —but prob-
ably not without more sound and fury.
FRANCE
The Disarmed Opposition
It is a parliamentary tradition in France
for out-of-power parties to hoot and
heckle speakers from the ruling party. Yet
when the country’s new prime minister,
Laurent Fabius, took the podium in the
National Assembly last Tuesday to outline
his week-old government’s program, the
opposition was surprisingly docile. The
right’s reserve was less a matter of parlia-
mentary protocol than a sense of bewilder-
ment. In one dramatic week, Socialist Presi-
dent Franqois Mitterrand had deftly
disarmed his right-wing opponents by
switching to a conservative prime minister,
forcing the Communists out of his govern-
ment and calling for a constitutional
amendment to allow referendums on “pub-
lic liberties” issues. That left the opposition
with an awkward problem: how to battle a
government with a new centrist image.
Fabius’s speech was a clear affirmation of
Mitterrand’s shift to the center.
Indeed, the address might have
been delivered by the previous
rightist administration. Fabius
vowed to continue the govern-
ment’s austerity policies, put-
ting emphasis on the need to
modernize industry and to in-
crease industrial investment.
And the government’s 1985
budget, to be submitted to Par-
liament in the coming months,
is about as far from traditional
socialist economics as can be
imagined. The government
plans to cut taxes to increase
consumer savings and stimu-
late investment while slashing
social spending. One political
commentator wryly called the
plans “supply-side socialism.”
Attack: Co-opted on the eco-
nomic front and outmaneu-
vered on the social issues, the
two principal opposition par-
ties, the center-right Union for
French Democracy and the
neo-Gaullist Rally for the Re-
public (RPR), are now groping
for a line of attack. “They no
longer have a strategy,” says
Philippe Moreau Defarges, a
professor at France’s Institut
des Sciences Politiques. That was evident
when Paris Mayor and RPR leader Jacques
Chirac, in a startling move, demanded that
Mitterrand dissolve the National Assem-
bly—in which the Socialists hold an abso-
lute majority —and call new elections.
“Mitterrand would never do something so
politically foolish,” says one right-wing po-
litical insider. “Chirac’s just trying to take
back the offensive.”
Most perturbing to the right is what to do
about Mitterrand’s call for a September ref-
erendum to amend the Constitution. Before
a public vote, the National Assembly and the
Senate, now controlled by the opposition,
must approve the measure. Although the
opposition originally proposed a referen-
dum on a government plan to increase state
control of private schools, the right fears
that a more general referendum would turn
into a plebiscite for Mitterrand. That could
re-establish the legitimacy his government
lost in June’s European Parliament elec-
tions. But a right-wing vote against the pro-
posal would be interpreted by the public as a
vote against democracy. Analysts predict
that the Senate will try to block the measure
by tacking on unacceptable amendments,
While the opposition fumbles for a strate-
gy, it can at least be thankful that the Mitter-
rand government remains a long way from
wooing back its wayward electorate. Politi-
cal analysts estimate that the Socialists’ cur-
Fabius before the Assembly: ‘Supply-side socialism’?
rent support runs no higher than 25 percent.
Moreover, with the Communists now free
to oppose the government, the autumn ren-
tree from the beach is likely to be heated. “I
can’t see the government winning any
points when half the country goes on strike
over the next round of purchasing-power
cutbacks,” says one financial analyst. If
nothing else, Mitterrand’s next set of trou-
bles could provide his opponents with the
ammunition they are now looking for.

CAMPAIGN '84
Reagan Takes
Off the Gloves
Dashing through Texas, Georgia and New Jersey, the
candidate pursues an old sport —bashing Democrats.
For four frustrating days Ronald Reagan
had to sit at home and watch it unfold
on television: Democrats waxing eloquent
over his purported failures. Democrats
preaching family values. Democrats wav-
ing the flag from one end of the Moscone
Center to the other. By last week the presi-
dent was mad as hell and determined not
to take it anymore. Spuming the tradi-
tional Rose Garden strategy, Reagan barn-
stormed through Texas, Georgia and New
Jersey, returning to the sport he loves best —
bashing liberal Democrats.
His speeches were classic Roughhouse

convention. “Maybe that fog is so thick out
there it’s getting inside their heads,” he
gibed in Austin. At an Atlanta rally, Reagan
offered his own directions to a Democratic
convention: “Go west to San Francisco and
then turn left.” Hejoked that the Democrats
still believe that GNP “stands for gross
national promises.” With a broad grin and
his trademark soft-shoe delivery, Reagan
even got away with almost questioning the
patriotism of his rivals. “The national
Democratic leadership is going so far left,”
he declared, “they’ve left America.”
Some top White House aides had wanted
the president to wait until the Republican
convention to command equal time. But
stung by polls showing him barely even with
the Mondale-Ferraro ticket, Reagan decid-
ed to unleash his counterforce strategy.
“Before the Democratic convention, there
was a lot of Republican complacency,” said
Reagan political confidant Lyn Nofziger.
“A look at those polls should tell them that
this election is not a lead-pipe cinch.”
‘Four More Years’: The result was a three-
pronged Reagan offensive: a press confer-
ence castigating the Democrats, a five-min-
ute television ad repeating his themes and
two days on the road preaching to the GOP
faithful. Reagan’s itinerary was a Michelin
Guide to the swing voters of 1984: Southern
moderates in Texas and Georgia and blue-
collar ethnics, especially Italian-Ameri-
cans, in northern New
Jersey. Despite persist-
ent chants of “four more
years,” sweltering heat
partly wilted Republi-
can enthusiasm in Aus-
tin and Atlanta. But
New Jersey was a bra-
vura performance—
complete with a cameo
appearance by home-
town hero Frank Sinatra
at a church fair in Ho-
boken, where later Rea-
gan shared a spaghet-
ti dinner (prepared by
White House chefs) with
Newark Archbishop Pe-
ter Gerety.
The Mondale camp
claimed to be delighted
by the first installment of
Ronnie Strikes Back. “They wanted this to
be a six-week election, a British-style elec-
tion,” said Mondale polltaker Peter Hart,
“For the first time in many months, Reagan
is on the defensive.” But while the president
was field-testing his mainstream campaign
themes, the Democratic nominee was de-
voting his energies to field and stream,
Buoyed by the success of the Democratic
convention, Mondale treated himself to a
five-day fishing vacation in northern Min-
nesota—angling for walleyes in the cold
waters of Gunflint Lake and Lake Superior.
The Mondale entourage—his family, two
fishing buddies from Duluth and a few
aides—was encamped in three rustic cab-
ms. There were daily news flashes: Mondale
The president and Bush lead the cheers at an
hauled in an almost eight-pound walleye
and set a personal record with a 14-pound
lake trout. Fritz of the North emerged from
seclusion just long enough to declare that
Reagan’s invective showed that the presi-
dent “is getting a little desperate.”
Hatchet Person: Half a continent away,
running mate Geraldine Ferraro basked in
the media spotlight as she honed her own
skills as a political hatchet person. As femi-
nist leaders had predicted, the selection of
Ferraro left Reagan and the rest of the
Republican team groping for words, sym-
bols and a strategy to counter America’s
first gender-balanced ticket. Reagan cam-
paign chief Ed Rollins stumbled into an
embarrassing double-entendre when he de-
clared that Ferraro could be “the biggest
political bust of recent years.” Vice Presi-
dent George Bush had readily agreed to
debate Ferraro, but last week campaign offi-
cials were backing away from any specific
commitment. “I don’t see any gain for the
Republicans in a Bush-Ferraro debate,”
Nofziger admitted. During the Austin rally,
both Reagan and Bush demonstrated their
difficulties with feminist sensitivities when
they allowed two cheerleaders in halter

tops to present them with Stetson hats.
Beginning with the efforts to woo Italian
Roman Catholics in New Jersey, the Rea-
gan-Bush team unveiled what passes for an
impromptu strategy to contain Ferraro fe-
ver. The president will avoid mentioning her
by name —which shouldn’t be hard since
Reagan on the stump totally avoided ever
uttering the word “Mondale.” Reagan cam-
paign surrogates will deride Ferraro: not as a
woman, but as an inexperienced liberal.
“We have to show that Geraldine Ferraro is
not the lady in the supermarket,” explained
Mitchell Daniels, who heads the Republi-
can Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Social Issues: Televised press conferences
are part of the arsenal of incumbency—and
Reagan used this pulpit last week to finesse
Mondale’s claim that the president has a
“secret plan” to raise taxes after the elec-
tion. Sounding themes that conservative
House Republicans have been using for
months, Reagan also charged that House
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O’Neill and his
Democratic minions were bottling up “six
key measures” ranging from a constitution-
al amendment mandating a balanced budg-
et to a so-called equal-access bill allowing
student groups to use public schools for
afterhours religious meetings. The presi-
dent’s appeal was far from a realistic legisla-
tive agenda—especially since Congress is
only scheduled to be in session for 33 more
days. But wary of being entrapped on social
issues, most House Democrats joined in the
lopsided 337-to-77 majority that sent a
slightly diluted version of the equal-access
bill to Reagan for his signature.
In his press conference, Reagan also
sparked a brief bidding war for the votes of
senior citizens —and again the Democrats
demonstrated bipartisan solidarity. The is-
sue was vintage political pork barrel:
whether social-security recipients will get
their annual cost-of-living increase even
though inflation may have fallen below the
legal 3 percent trigger. Despite the estimat-
ed $5 billion cost, Reagan pressed for a
social-security increase—and within hours
Senate Democrats took the lead in pushing
the measure through by an 87-3 vote.
Imperiled: This orgy of election-year pos-
turing also imperiled the Simpson-Mazzoli
immigration reform bill now awaiting
House-Senate conference. Mondale quieted
a brief Hispanic rebellion at the convention
by reaffirming his opposition to the parts of
the bill that would penalize employers who
knowingly hire illegal aliens. Last week the
Reagan team also abruptly backed away
from this prickly reform package. Vice
President Bush promised the National
Council of La Raza that Reagan will “not
sign any legislation that will permit employ-
ers to discriminate against Hispanics.”
Traditionalists may have been content to
wait until Labor Day, but the sizzling start
of the general-election campaign presaged
many of the themes and tactics of the next

three months. Judging from the harsh rhet-
oric, both sides will try to occupy the po-
litical center by depicting their rivals as
ideological extremists: in effect, George
McGovern versus Barry Goldwater. Politi-
cal strategists are in almost total agreement
over the major geographic and demograph-
ic battlegrounds. Reagan’s visit to northern
New Jersey underlines the importance of
blue-collar ethnic Catholics (known as
BCEC voters) in the Northeast and Mid-
west. The Democrats won the White House
in 1976 —the only time since 1964 they cap-
tured a majority of the Italian vote. Both
campaigns also view young white moder-
ates as the linchpin for winning the South
and Texas. Not surprisingly, within a week
all four national candidates will have visited
Austin, Texas, the prototypical sun-belt
boom town bursting with politically volatile
Yuppies too important to quiche off".
The Democratic convention showcased
Mondale’s strategy of trying to arouse voter
fears about the future under Reagan. But
political analyst Richard Scammon cau-
tions that most elections are a referendum
“about what a president has done so far.”
Ronald Reagan understands that perfectly.
He triggered wild applause in Austin by
simply asking, “Are you better off than you
were four years ago?”

Jousting Over a Tax Increase
The president tries to finesse a tough issue: ‘He didn’t close the door,’ Dole said
MARLETT E-CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
Let’s tell the truth — Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I.
He won’t tell you. I just did.
‘ —Walter Mondale accepting the Democratic nomination
It was, in a way, the economic equivalent of choosing a woman
to run for vice president: dramatic, untraditional and potentially
self-destructive. But like his selection of Geraldine Ferraro,
Fritz Mondale’s convention pledge to raise taxes if elected
seemed to pay off" —at least for the first week of partisan battle. It
put the president on the defensive, split Republican ranks and
forced the American public to take a closer look at some
economic realities that remain dangerously harsh despite the
pell-mell pace of the nation’s economic recovery. That the ploy
could yet backfire on Mondale was only further evidence of how
complex and daunting the issue of taxes really is.
Ronald Reagan tried to finesse it at his press conference. “I
have no plans for a tax increase,” he said. “I believe it would be
counterproductive with regard to the present recovery, or
expansion.” But he kept chewing on the issue, eventually
explaining that he would have to “look at the tax structure” if
spending cuts could not bring government expenditures into
line with revenues. (Among the programs to be surveyed for
further savings, Reagan said, were Medicare, veterans’ benefits
and farm price supports.) “He was being responsible. He didn’t
close the door,” said Kansas Republican Bob Dole, chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee, who earlier predicted that a
tax increase would be necessary to bring down a soaring federal
budget deficit expected to hit $230 bil-
lion by 1989.
Many economists think such an in-
crease is inevitable because the current
tax system now nets about 19 percent of
the gross national product while federal
spending approaches 24 percent, de-
spite billions in bipartisan paring. That
proportion would not be significantly
changed simply by growth in the
GNP fed by the current recovery. In-
deed, Federal Reserve chairman Paul
Volcker warned last week that the
healthy economic growth and modest
inflation of the last 18 months would
not continue unless the deficit is
reduced.
Special Interests: Democrats were de-
lighted with the divisions among their
Republican rivals. Mondale’s support-
ers said his boldness in admitting the
need for a tax increase also made the
nominee look tougher, more candid and
less the servant of special interests.
“Mondale is telling people what they
need to hear, not what they want to
hear,” said New York Rep. Tom Dow-
ney. “The question will be who’s telling
the truth, and Mondale will win on that.”
Mondale, however, has made some waves for himself. Even
before the convention, he had released a plan to reduce the
deficit by half —or about $lOO billion —in 1989. The measures
included about $3O billion in spending cuts and $6O billion in
revenue measures such as the deferral of tax indexing, a cap on
the third-year tax cut for those earning more than $60,000, a 10
percent “surcharge” on the taxes of those earning more than
$lOO,OOO, a 15 percent minimum corporate tax and tough new
“compliance” enforcement to recapture up to $lO billion a
year from tax evaders. But the package was based on January
economic forecasts that were already out of date by the time a
group of economists briefed Mondale on the mounting deficit
problem again in North Oaks, Minn., last month. Mondale
then raised the ante in San Francisco: he promised a two-thirds
cut in the deficit by 1989, then sent his staffers scrambling to
find ways to meet that goal—and yet to keep the burden mostly
on corporations and on the wealthiest Americans.
Most budget analysis suggests that the pain may well have to
be more widespread—and the plan accordingly less popular if
it comes to the debate Mondale has demanded. Already some

For Want of a Bathing Suit
Bewildered aides to Salvadoran Presi-
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte thought the
photographers were clamoring for him. In
fact, they had staked out the studios of
NBC’s “Today” show at dawn last week in
hopes of catching the newly dethroned Miss
America, Vanessa Williams, and her succes-
sor, Suzette Charles. Pageant officials were
so fearful that the two Miss Americas of

1984, appearing in different segments of the
show, might be seen together that they insist-
ed on separate studio holding rooms. In the
same half hour, Playboy publisher Hugh
Hefner —interviewed in silk pajamas—
waxed philosophic about ethics, exploita-
tion and women’s rights, sounding for all the
world, joked one Playboy minion, like a
sensitive male for the ’ 80s.
Peek: By last week the scandal over Wil-
liams’s nude photos in Penthouse magazine
had assumed all the dimensions of a Greek
tragedy—with comic-opera overtones. Wil-
liams bit her lip and resigned. Penthouse
publisher Bob Guccione defended his maga-
zine’s coup as “precisely analogous to what
The Washington Post did to Richard Nix-
on” and Kellogg’s executives withheld
thousands of boxes of cornflakes featuring
Williams from a National Urban League
convention. Amid swirling debate over just
who was exploiting whom and what differ-
ence a bathing suit made, 5 million copies of
Penthouse hit the newsstands and sold out
immediately. Some newsstands scalped the
$4 issue ($ 1 higher than usual) for as much as
$3O a copy; others charged $2 to $7 just for a
peek. “The thing that disgusts me most is not
what she did or who did what to her,” sniffed
Connaught Marshner, chairman of the Na-
tional Pro-Family Coalition —but the sight
of congressional aides on Capitol Hill “fall-
ing all over themselves slavering after some
dirty pictures.”
New details also emerged about how the
photographs found their way into print.
Guccione told Newsweek that Penthouse
had turned away an agent for pho-
tographer Tom Chiapel, then
Chiapel himself, before Chiapel
produced an acceptable model re-
lease form. In the end, an attorney
for Penthouse, Norman Roy Grut-
man, insisted the release was valid,
but Williams also insisted that she
had never agreed to have the
photos published. Doubts about
the documentation contributed to
Playboy’s refusal to buy the pic-
tures when Chiapel’s agent, Steve
Breitman, offered them late last
year. New York modeling execu-
tive Pat Evans said Breitman also
told her about the pictures last
year; he had hopes, she said, of
signing Charles to a modeling con-
tract, insisting that she would soon
become the new Miss America. Ev-
ans refused to get involved. Neither
Breitman nor Chiapel could be
reached for comment.
‘Torso’: Such details had little to
do with the debate that dominated
editorial pages and conversations
last week. Feminists and tradition-
alists, like Marshner, alike charged that the
pageant itself was only marginally less guilty
of exploiting female flesh. “The swimsuit
competition reduces women to just a torso,”
blasted Alexandra Matusinka of Women
Against Pornography. “There’s nothing
pornographic about a
woman in a swimsuit —if
there were, every beach
in the country would be
closed,” countered pag-
eant chairman Albert
Marks Jr. In one unsci-
entific telephone poll
conducted by the Los
Angeles Herald Examin-
er, 65 percent of re-
spondents said Williams
should have kept her
crown. “America has
made some mistakes —so
why not Miss America?”
said one physician who
called in. But many lost
sympathy for Williams
after seeing the photos,
depicting startlingly ex-
plicit lesbian sex scenes.
Williams resigning: Startling scenes
SONIA MOSKOWITZ
Williams “should not have posed for those
pictures,” said anti-ERA activist Phyllis
Schlafly. “But it’s the magazine that will
reap all the benefits, and that’s troubling.”
Williams, who hopes to pursue an enter-
tainment career, may not
fare so badly in the end.
Hollywood casting agents
said her new notoriety
might actually help win
movie roles, even if it cuts
her out of advertising and
TV jobs. Pageant officials
said she could keep her

estimated $125,000 in ap-
pearance fees —and that
she might even be asked to

repeated his offer to hire Williams for Pent-
house public-relations appearances. Wil-
liams, not surprisingly, did not respond.

WORLD AFFAIRS
Israel Votes Against Itself
After a splintered election, neither Labor nor Likud can form a strong coalition.
Shamir (left) and Peres casting their ballots: A chaotic outcome that reflected growing disillusionment with both major parties
Israel desperately needed a strong new
government. Inflation was devouring the
shekel, the occupation of Lebanon was sap-
ping morale and the surrounding Arab
world was as hostile and dangerous as ever.
But when Israelis went to the polls last
week, they only made things worse. Neither
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his
Likud bloc nor Shimon Peres and his Labor
Party could form a governing coalition in
the Knesset. There was talk of a national-
unity cabinet, but few politicians believed it.
And whatever government emerged from
the muddle was certain to be too weak and
unstable to do Israel much good. “The peo-
ple of Israel voted against itself,” said novel-
ist Amos Kenan as he surveyed the chaotic
results. “It . . . voted against the govern-
ment —against any government.”
Until the last weeks of the campaign,
Peres had been the heavy favorite. Early
polls indicated that Labor might win up to
55 seats —enough to give it a strong chance
of forming a ruling coalition. The Reagan
administration also favored Peres, hoping
that he would take new steps toward solving
the Palestinian problem. But Peres fought a
cautious and uninspiring campaign. In the
end Labor won only 44 seats —more than
any other party, but 3 seats fewer than it
took in the last elections in 1981. Israeli
President Chaim Herzog was charged with
asking Peres or Shamir to try to form a
government, and Labor’s plurality might
persuade him to give Peres the first try. But
even if he gets the nod, Peres had only a slim
chance of recruiting enough partners
among Israel’s smaller par-
ties to form a majority in the
120-member Knesset.
While Peres was scram-
bling to muster a majority,
Shamir was doing the same
thing. He had waged a dull
election fight. Menachem
Begin, his popular prede-
cessor, refused to endorse
him publicly. But in a
late catch-up drive, Likud
managed to capture 41
seats. The results indi-
cated that Likud still com-
mands a powerful hard-line
constituency—made up of
hawks who want to hold on
to Israel’s occupied territo-
ries at all costs, and of Oriental Jews rankled
over the discrimination they suffered under
past Labor governments. Since Likud has
more natural ties to Israel’s small right-
wing religious parties, Shamir still had a
good chance of outbargaining Peres and
returning as prime minister.
With the outcome so murky, many Israe-
lis hoped the parties would put aside their

differences and form a national-unity gov-
ernment. Begin endorsed the idea, saying it
would be “a positive contribution.” Several
top Labor strategists also favored the unity
arrangement: they pointed out that it might
strengthen Labor’s standing among Orien-
tal Jews; it could also take away some of the
leverage of far-right parties that might pres-
sure Shamir to take an even tougher stance
on relations with the Arabs. The trouble was
that both Shamir and Peres appeared unwill-
ing to serve in a government headed by the
other man. Given that obstacle, the odds
were running against the unity scenario.
Allies: The more likely prospect was an
extended period of horse-trading in which
Shamir and Peres would each try to form a
government on his own. Of the 13 small
parties elected to the Knesset, Labor had
only two natural allies: Shinui (3 seats) and
the Movement for Citizens’ Rights and
Peace (3). Peres was counting on the backing
of two strategic centrist parties: Tami (1),
whose defection from the Likud bloc forced
the election; and Yahad (3), a new party led
by Ezer Weizman, the former defense minis-
ter under Begin who resigned in 1980 over
Likud’s West Bank policies. He could also
rely on the passive support of the two left-
wing Arab parties—RAKAH (4) and the
Progressive List for Peace (2); but for politi-
cal reasons he would not invite either into a
coalition. With all those parties in his camp,
Peres would have only 54 coalition partners.
But he would command the sympathies of 60
Knesset members—enough to keep Shamir
from forming a government.
Shamir’s arithmetic looked more prom-
ising. He had six natural allies: Tehiya (5),
the National Religious Party (4), the
Sephardic Torah Guardians (4), Agudat
Israel (2), Morasha (2) and Ometz (1). He
could also expect the passive backing of the
newly elected Kach movement of Rabbi
Meir Kahane, the far-right founder of the
Jewish Defense League. (Like the Arab par-
ties, Kahane was unacceptable to either
Shamir or Peres as a coalition partner.)
That gave Shamir the support of 60 Knesset
members—enough to block Peres. It also
gave him 59 potential coalition partners. To
prevail, all Shamir had to do was win over
Weizman’s Yahad party. Before the elec-
tion, Weizman had proclaimed his will-
ingness to serve under either Labor or Li-
kud. He still seemed to be leaning toward
Peres. But Likud officials were busy court-
ing Weizman, and Shamir was thought to be
prepared to offer him his choice of cabinet
posts in exchange for Yahad’s support.
Beyond the difficulty it added to coali-
tion-building, some Israelis saw other trou-
bling implications in the proliferation of the
small parties. In part, the splintering effect
resulted from Israel’s system of proportion-
al representation, which guarantees at least
one Knesset seat to every party that wins
more than 1 percent of the vote. But it also
reflected a growing disillusion with the two
major parties—and perhaps with Israeli de-
mocracy itself. Several of the fringe parties

are openly antidemocratic: RAKAH is
communist; and Kahane’s Kach movement
advocates a theocratic dictatorship that
would expel all Arabs from Israel. Assess-
ing the election returns, Israeli author
Amos Oz saw a danger that Israelis could
eventually become “fed up with democra-
cy” and that “the lack of stable government
would bring more and more of them to
think of a nondemocratic alternative.”
Inflation: For the moment, Shamir and
Peres still had to worry about how to make
the current system work. Whichever man
emerges as prime minister, his first priority
will have to be Israel’s dire economic crisis.
Under seven years of Likud rule, inflation
has skyrocketed to 400 percent, partly be-
cause of government spending on defense
and West Bank settlements, partly because
of the no-tomorrow spending of Israeli con-
sumers. Many Israelis have abandoned the
shekel as a store of value, turning instead to
the American dollar. Before the elections,
thousands of panicky Israelis bought up
more dollars, further depleting the coun-
try’s $3 billion foreign-currency reserves. To
halt the drain, former Deputy Finance Min-
ister Yehezkel Flomin warned, the new
government will have to take strong action
“within a couple of weeks. ”
On the Lebanon issue, both Shamir and
Peres have come out in favor of Israeli
withdrawal. The logic of that course grew
stronger when the Lebanese government
asked Jerusalem to shut down its liaison
office north of Beirut—the last tangible gain
of Israel’s 1982 invasion. But neither Labor
nor Likud is likely to pull out Israeli troops
until strict limits are placed on the strength
and movement of Syrian forces in Lebanon,
Israeli officials were outraged last week
when U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard W. Murphy testified before Con-
gress that Damascus was playing a “help-
ful” role in restoring stability to Leb-
anon. Murphy insisted that his praise was
“relative.” But at least one respected Israeli
analyst predicted that Israel would stay in
Lebanon, and that de facto partition of the
country would continue indefinitely,
The election destroyed any short-term
prospect of progress on the Palestinian is-
sue. During the campaign, Peres had talked
about pushing for a new peace initiative
with Jordan and Egypt. But that plan de-
pended on a strong Labor mandate; now

any Peres government would be too weak to
trade land for peace. If Shamir puts together
a coalition, he can be expected to stick with
Likud’s hard-line policies. And any unity
government would be so divided on the
Palestinian question that it would probably
ignore it altogether. Given that bleak out-
look, the Arab world dismissed the election:
Egyptians predicted it would mean more
“cold peace” between Cairo and Jerusalem;
Jordanians said it ruined any chance that
Hussein would take new risks, and PLO
leader Yasir Arafat used it as another occa-
sion to rail against “the Israeli conspiracy.”
Some U.S. officials still believed that the
peace process could be revived. They point-
ed out that if Ronald Reagan wins a second
term in November, he could bring strong
U.S. pressure to bear in trying to revive his
1982 proposal for a Jordanian federation on
the West Bank. They also predicted, along
with many Israelis, that whatever govern-
ment emerges in Jerusalem won’t last very
long—perhaps less than a year. But even if a
new election does take place soon, the
chances are slim that Israel will move back
to the left. Inconclusive as it was, last week’s
result proved one thing: Israel has become a
decidedly more right-wing country. Mena-
chem Begin was no fluke, and Israel’s next
prime minister will have to work within the
narrow confines of Begin’s political legacy.

Who Won in Israel?
By SHLOMO AVINERI
Labor won the Israeli elections. But it may turn out to be a
Pyrrhic victory.
Despite the debacle in Lebanon, a 400 percent annual infla-
tion rate and the eclipse of Menachem Begin, Likud managed to
hold on to the core of its political supporters. It is no longer the
largest party, but it remains a formidable force, and given the
fragmentation of the Israeli political scene, Yitzhak Shamir may
emerge, once more, as Israel’s prime minister.
In the past, many foreign observers tried to explain Likud’s
ascendancy in terms of the powerful personal appeal of Mena-
chem Begin. But this never went to the heart of the issue. Begin did
not create a constituency—he articulated it. It is this constituen-
cy which Likud has been able to keep almost intact despite its
recent vicissitudes, and it represents two major shifts in Israeli life
in the last two decades —one political, the other sociological.
The Six Day War of 1967 was a major watershed. It changed
not only the strategic balance in the Middle East; it also trans-
formed the political agenda in Israel. Before 1967, political
debate in Israel was almost exclusively focused on internal
issues: problems of nation building, massive immigration and its
absorption, the extension of a nascent welfare state, the ingather-
ing of the exiles, the opening up of new frontiers —like the
Negev—for settlement and development. For these issues, the
political ideas—and the powerful
machine —of the Labor Party ap-
peared to be relevant. The right-wing
Herut Party—later to become the
main component of Likud—seemed
out of touch with the realities of life in
Israel. When it talked about histori-
cal Jewish rights to Judea and Samar-
ia, it did not get much response from
people who had just escaped the Nazi
Holocaust or persecution in Arab
countries. But after 1967, with Israel
in control of the ancestral lands on
the West Bank and Gaza, the political
debate shifted to issues of nationalism
and confrontation with Palestinian
nationalism. Likud, with its simple
message—“ This is our land”—had a
clear advantage over Labor, which
tried to square its commitment to
Israel’s security with its liberal, hu-
manistic ideals.
The second change has been the
transformation of Israeli society it-
self. When the state was established in
1948, 85 percent of Israel’s Jewish
population was made up of immi-
grants from Europe and their de-
Shamir at election headquarters: A new agenda
ZOOM 77
scendants (Ashkenazim) and 15 percent hailed from Middle
Eastern countries (Sephardim). Today, the ratio is 50-50 with
the Sephardim on the increase.
It would be wrong to suggest that all Sephardic voters prefer
Likud; in the 1981 elections around 35 percent of the Labor
voters were Sephardim. But on balance, many Sephardim tend
to feel more at home with the more tradition-oriented and
ethnocentric outlook of Likud than with the universalist ideas of
Labor, which are, after all, an outgrowth of the European
Enlightenment. It is true that some of Israel’s most extreme right
wingers are of European background. But the masses that hailed
Begin and Sharon for their tough policies toward the Arabs were
predominantly Sephardic. Since many of the Middle Eastern
immigrants brought with them memories of persecution and
hatred at the hands of Arab Muslims, it is not surprising if they
are more hawkish than Israelis of European origin, who are not
burdened with such memories.
Instability: The combination of a new political agenda and a
changing social structure severely undermined the traditional
hegemony of the Labor Party. But any government that emerges
from the forthcoming coalition negotiations is bound to be a
weak and unstable one —whether led by Labor or by Likud. A
national-unity government will likewise be extremely fragile,
with its two main partners pushing in opposing directions.
Will Israel then become ungovernable? Not necessarily. The
Israeli system has absorbed many crises in the past. Yet it is a
different Israel that emerges out of all this —perhaps not at peace
with itself or with its neighbors. Para-
doxically, it is a much more Middle
Eastern, less European country.
Many observers have hoped that Is-
rael would one day shed its Europe-
an characteristics and become more
like the countries surrounding it. It
may be a cruel irony of history that
Likud’s staying in power is an ex-
pression of this integration of Israel
into the Middle East —into the real,
not always pleasant Middle East, not
into some sort of utopian, nonexist-
ent Middle East which appears only
in the dreams of European roman-
tics. But this is the real Israel, and
for better or worse, the friends
of Israel —and Jews all over the
world—will have to learn to come to
terms with it.

WORLD BUSINESS
The Video
Revolution
The boom in VCR’s is overturning
the tyranny of television and trans-
forming the American living room
into a private screening room. Ea-
ger entrepreneurs are building an
entire industry around the video-
philes, shaking the very founda-
tions of the entertainment business.
Near closing time on a hot, humid night,
Federal TV, across from Wrigley Field in
Chicago, is packed with people waiting to
rent tapes for their video-cassette recorders.
To nurse Eileen Smith, 34, nine months
pregnant, bliss would be unwinding in front
of the TV watching Meryl Streep in “Silk-
wood.” But lots of people had the same idea.
“We’re out. How ’bout ‘Cujo’?” says a clerk.
As people behind her groan, Smith dashes off
to a video store in Lincoln Park. Out again.
She finally finds “Silkwood” at the Chicago
Public Library. “I can’t say the VCR has
changed my life, unless you count the night

we rented ‘An Officer and a Gentleman’,”
she says, patting her swollen stomach. “If we
hadn’tstayed up late to watch Richard Gere,
I might not be in this condition. ”
Last November Barbara and Wayne Riley
of Houston were eager to watch ABC’s nu-
clear-holocaust drama “The Day After. ”
But they didn’t want to expose their three-
year-old son, Cullen, to the graphic film. At
8 o’clock they popped a cassette into their
VCR and taped the show to watch after
Cullen’s bedtime. As much of the country
sat transfixed by images of nuclear devas-
tation, the Rileys were on
the couch entertaining Cul-
len with tapes of “Sesame
Street”—using another of
their four VCR’s.
For Louis Barrere, a San
Francisco sound engineer,
what started as a hobby be-
came a consuming obses-
sion. “I would tape 10 Star
Treks’, ” he says, “and then
I would say to myself, Tf I
have 10 of them, I really
ought to have all of them;
there are only 82. ’ That’s
how it grows. ” Barrere has
just bought his sixth VCR;
he wore out his first five in
the course of amassing
1,000 videotapes—a collec-
tion so vast that he had to
build a special closet to
house it. But Barrere may
be looking for another hob-
by. “It can get pretty expen-
sive, ”he says. “Ifinally said
Browsing at Philadelphia’s Movies Unlimited:
to myself, ‘This is crazy. I’ve got a Volvo in
my closet that I can ’t drive’. ”
Video revolutions are proclaimed so of-
ten that it would be tempting to dismiss this
one as just another false alarm. But all the
evidence says it isn’t. Spurred by sharp price
cuts and a surge in the availability of pre-
recorded tapes, VCR sales have galloped
beyond the most optimistic projections.
More than 10 million American homes now
have at least one VCR —and that figure
should hit 15 million at the end of 1984. By
1987, one in three households will have one.
The private screening room, once the exclu-
sive luxury of movie moguls, may soon be as
common as the two-car garage. “Home vid-
eo,” says Richard Snyder, chairman of Si-
mon and Schuster, “is going to be the next
major mass medium.”
Its arrival is shaking up almost every
facet of the entertainment business. With
video revenues on their way to becoming the
largest source of film revenue after box-
office receipts, directors, actors and writers
are dickering with the studios over how to

divide the extra loot. Studio executives,
meanwhile, are busily seeking ways to mine
the cassette market for even more. Music
videos have spun new life into the record
industry, and the spread of VCR’s may turn
music-video sales into a significant source
of revenue. The satraps of other realms —
broadcasting, cable TV, publishing and ad-
vertising—are trying to hold their own
against the new competitor, grabbing for
pieces of the action at the same time.
Freedom: The theme of this uprising is
power to the people. Ever since the television
set took control of the American family, it
has ruled dictatorially, delivering look-alike
programming that varies only with the time
of day. More than any other system, the
VCR lets viewers overturn television’s tyr-
anny. For early users, that mostly meant
either “time shifting”—taping a program
to watch at another, more convenient hour
—or watching X-rated films. But the VCR
movement owes its newfound strength to
the vast array of programming now avail-
able. Choices range from megaflicks like
“Tootsie” and rock epics like “Duran
Duran” to “Curious George” and Jane Fon-
da’s “Workout.” “It’s freedom,” says Los
Angeles screenwriter Dana Olsen. “When I
was a kid I was a prisoner of the tube; now it
does what I want when I want it. ”
That freedom begins with a technology
that originated in the United States in 1961
and is now dominated by Japan, where gi-
ants such as Sony, Hitachi and Matsushita
manufacture VCR’s for the world. Ameri-
can companies get their slice of the $5 bil-
lion hardware market by selling Japanese
machines under their own labels,
The versatile little machines have created
a whole new industry: the sales and rental of
prerecorded cassettes. A video outlet can be
anything from a drugstore where one
counter supports a stack of tapes to 30-store
chains like Erol’s in Washington, D.C. To-
gether, the 14,000 outlets that retail cas-
settes rang up $ 1 billion in revenues last
year, mostly from rentals—and according
to many analysts, that figure could rise to $5
billion by 1988 (chart),
To reach this rosy state the video industry
had to survive a fairly sickly childhood. In
the mid-1970s videophiles began copying
television shows to sell to fellow addicts.
What early VCR owners wanted most was
movies, but given the small number of ma-
chines in circulation, the major studios
couldn’t be bothered to license their films.
Finally, in 1978 video visionary Andre Blay
persuaded Twentieth Century-Fox to sell
him the cassette rights to 50 movies, includ-
ing “M*A*S*H” and “Patton,” for $6,000
each. Blay’s tapes were placed in electronics
stores, but low volume and steep manufac-
turing costs kept the price so high ($79.95)
that very few sold. “Then damn American
ingenuity set in,” says Jack Silverman, who
founded Commtron, the nation’s largest
video-cassette distributor. Retailers began
to rent cassettes instead of selling them, “and
they spawned an industry. ”
Heroes: To hear Silverman tell it, the
founding of the home-video industry is a
story as stirring as the founding of the Re-
public: “The real heroes of the video move-
ment are those little mom-and-pop retail
stores —the guy who got a second mortgage
on his house and borrowed from his aunt to
open a retail store and endured hard times
until it boomed. They were dentists’ wives,
looking for a career in liberated America,
bookkeepers whose kids ran it so they could
realize the American dream of owning their
own business and Vietnamese boat people
who didn’t even speak English. Little by
little these little guys built an entire industry
and did it during a deep recesssion.”
Now people are rushing to cash in. “It’s
an easy business to get into,” says Steven
Savage, co-owner of New York’s New Vid-
eo. “You just buy some tapes, put up a sign
that says ‘Video’ and if you have a good
location, people will come in.” In fact, you
can get into the business just by buying
a video vending machine—for $16,000 —
from Essex Engineering, a Connecticut
firm. The customer inserts a credit card and
chooses one of the machine’s 168 tapes; if
the tape is not returned, the account is billed
for the purchase price.
Video signs are popping up everywhere.
In Houston, Safeway and Randall’s super-
markets not only offer tapes, they also rent
VCR’s: Safeway charges $9 a night, Ran-
dall’s $ll. In Illinois, Dominick’s Fine
Foods chain offers a package deal: 10 tapes
for $2l. “At that price,” says customer
Eileen Smith, “it’s hard to go out for a quart
of milk without returning with a movie.”
And in New York, renting tapes can take
you to the cleaners. Last April Tai J. Kwon
turned part of his Greenwich Village dry-
cleaning shop over to video cassettes. Why
cassettes? “I read about it in the newspa-
pers,” says Kwon, in heavily accented Eng-
lish. “I didn’t have any experience. I just
opened.” But he had done some market
research: “A lot of people had video cas-
settes when they came into the cleaners,” he
says. And he recognized that both cassettes
and dry cleaning require a return trip every
two days or so.
It’s getting harder to find virgin terri-


DEBRA FREEMAN —NEWSWEEK
tory. Alaska, for example, is a video hot
spot. Dan Apted, co-owner of Video Con-
cepts in Anchorage, rents tapes to 22 bush
communities, delivering them by air. “One
guy rents it,” he says, “and half the town
comes over to his house to watch it.”
When too many people get the same good
idea, it can turn bad. Like dozens of others,
Jean Lightbourn went into video retailing
because there wasn’t a place near her
home —in scruffy southwest Detroit—
where she could rent cassettes for her VCR.
She opened her shop, Video Focus, four
months ago. But within two weeks two other
video outlets had invaded the neighbor-
hood. Staring forlornly across the street
where yet another video store has an “Open-
ing Soon” sign in its window, she says, “If I
had known this was going to become a video
block, I would have remained a consumer. ”
In fact, the pressures on mom-and-pop
retailers are enormous. For one thing, capi-
tal outlays are high. Kwon, for example,
spent $40,000 to stock 1,000 titles, and he’s
saving up for 1,000 more. Many outlets use
“clubs” —offering discounts on rentals for
large up-front “membership” fees to im-
prove cash flow and buy more inventory. To
be sure of having popular tapes on hand, a
store must carry multiple copies of hot ti-
tles. Larger dealers, like Movies Unlimited
in Philadelphia, carry up to 7,000 titles;
owner Jerry Frebowitz finds that a larger
selection allows him to charge higher rental
prices than some small operations. The
competition will get even tougher if mass
merchandisers like K mart and 7-Eleven,
which are now testing the waters, jump in.
For Hollywood the only worry may be
how to chum the stuff out fast enough. But
the major studios had to be dragged into the
business —by video pirates. Bootleggers
were selling illicit copies of “Star Wars” and
“Raiders of the Lost Ark” for as much as
$l,OOO each. “A whole black market had
grown up to satisfy a consumer demand we
were ignoring,” says Steve Roberts, presi-
dent of Twentieth Century-Telecommuni-
cation. “So we decided to get into the boot-
legger’s business and make some profits for
ourselves.”
Which is just what they’ve done. Video
rights for “Silkwood” fetched $1.5 million
in January. “Supergirl,” which hasn’t even
started filming yet, brought $3.25 million
Assembling Sony Betamaxes: The hardware is Japanese
for the North American
rights alone. And George
Lucas just sold “The Em-
pire Strikes Back” to CBS-
Fox for an astounding $l5
million. By 1988, according
to conservative estimates,
home video will be contrib-
uting up to 25 percent of a
film’s revenues.
Even so, the film studios’
reluctance to enter the field
allowed independent com-
panies to gain a solid grip on
key parts of the business.
Early on, a few small compa-
nies, most of which dealt in
pornographic films, bought
up the video rights to popu-
lar television series and chil-
dren’s programming. Oth-
ers brought out a number of
instructional tapes. Little
known Karl Video markets
one of the most popular sell-
ers, Jane Fonda’s “Work-
out.” Roughly 30 independ-
ent marketers account for
most of the nonmovie trade. Belatedly, the
studios formed their own video-marketing
companies (some are joint ventures like
CBS-Fox), but they are pretty much con-
fined to selling their own releases. A few very
successful producers, like the Salkind Co.
(“Supergirl”) and George Lucas, are power-
ful enough to retain the video rights to their
own films.
Foresight: In addition, Hollywood has
been all but shut out of the video-distribu-
tion business. After producing a film,
most studios deliver the prints directly to
theaters, making good money for their trou-
ble. But film executives
didn’t believe video cas-
settes would ever repay the
costs of handling them.
Now, once the actual cas-
settes have been manufac-
tured (by firms such as Bell
& Howell in Chicago), the
studios must turn them over
to distributors like Silver-
man’s Commtron (1983
sales: $125 million) or
Sound Video Unlimited
(projected 1984 sales: $9O
million), which in turn de-
liver them to retailers. “The
film companies through the
years have failed to have
much foresight about the fu-
ture,” admits Alan Hirsch-
field, president of Twentieth
Century-Fox. “We didn’t
do it with TV. We failed
with cable, and we allowed
others to seize the distribu-
tion of home video.”

Toshiba introduces
9 printers in 3.
You use your computer for more than one purpose.
Why shouldn’t you use your printer the same way?
With Toshiba’s P 1351, P 1350 and P 1340 you can. A
text mode uses a 24-pin dot matrix printhead to give
you clean, letter-quality copy. A draft mode accelerates
the pace for long jobs or jobs that are required in a
hurry. And graphs are no problem either. The exclusive
printhead delivers a high 180 x 180 dots-per-inch
graphics density pattern. Each printer is really three
printers in one.
The P 1350 and P 1351 double the speed of a
standard daisy wheel printer, producing high quality
copy in the text mode, at 100 cps. The draft mode races
along at 192 cps.
They also offer subscripts, super-
scripts, variable pitch and a variety
of fonts selectable by software
command. And both printers
have extra wide platens. Perfect
for spreadsheet and Lotus
1-2-3 data processing. If
space and budget are a bit
tight, choose the P 1340. It gives you
most of the features of the other two, for less.
With all these advantages, and proven reliability,
it’s little wonder that IBM PC users the world over are
choosing Toshiba printers. No matter which one
you choose, it’s all the printers you need.

of the industry, however, is flooding
the major studios with enough cash to
force an overhaul of their intricate
financial structure. “The home-video
explosion has changed the movie
business more than anything since
the advent of TV,” says Paramount
president Michael Eisner. “All ar-
rangements with the writers, the di-
rectors and the actors, the cinematog-
raphers, everybody, will have to
change.” Last month, for example,
the Directors Guild —preparing to
strike over the issue—accepted a new
contract giving directors an increased
share of home-video revenues.
Hollywood executives, mean-
while, are fighting the “first sale”
doctrine in federal copyright law
that prohibits the studios from get-
ting additional royalty payments
once they have sold a tape to a deal-
er. “Composers get compensation
when their songs are played; why
shouldn’t the creators of a movie be
paid when their film is rented 50
times?” rails Fox’s Hirschfield. Two
bills moving through Congress would
repeal the first-sale rule, but the video
retailers are determined to stop them.
A neater way to handle the rental prob-
lem would be to encourage cassette sales,
from which Hollywood extracts a full meas-
ure of profit. In an attempt to tilt the market
in that direction, Paramount released “Star
Trek II: The Wrath of Khan” in November
1982 at $39.95, half the going rate for most
first-run movies. The experiment paid off,
and last December Paramount put out
“Raiders” at the same price; with 600,000
copies sold, it reigns as all-time top seller.
Videotape vending machine: The trick is convenience
JAMES POZARIK— PICTURE GROUP
So far, no major studio has followed Par-
amount’s lead—on the ground that price
reductions don’t pay. RCA/Columbia’s
“Tootsie,’’ for example, became the second
title to break 100,000 in sales, even though it
is priced at $79.95. “We would have had to
sell 300,000 titles at $39.95 to give us the
same profits,” insists RCA/Columbia presi-
dent Robert Blattner. CBS-Fox also has
announced that it will release all its big hits at
$79.95. Even Paramount still uses a two-tier
approach: if it does not expect a film to sell
well at the retail level, even at a re-
duced price, it sets its list price at
$79.95 to make what it can from deal-
ers who will be renting it out.
With music videos, there is no con-
test between sales and rental: people
want to play them repeatedly, like
records, not return them after one
viewing. “You haven’t seen the video
explosion yet,’’ says Gene Giaquinto,
president of MCA Home Video. In
addition to MTV, the cable channel
that plays them 24 hours a day, as
many as 300 programs nationwide are
devoted to music videos. While sales
of music videos are still small relative
to movies, F. Eberstadt & Co. esti-
mates that by 1988 they will account
for a quarter of the home-video mar-
ket. And many record stores strug-
gling through the recent rock-and-
roll slump found video sidelines to be
their salvation.
Synergy: All these dollars flowing
into video have to be coming out of
someone’s pockets. Theater owners
would seem to be likely victims, but on
the contrary, they are flourishing—
with record revenues and an increas-
ing number of screens available to the
public. That isn’t necessarily a para-
dox: VCR’s appear to inspire enthusiasm
about movies, persuading some people who
had stopped going to theaters to return. And
with increased revenues from video rights,
Hollywood is turning out more films: 144
through June of this year, compared with
102 in the first half of 1983. Accordingly,
Larry Moyer, who runs a theater chain in the
Portland, Ore., area, has opened 10 video
stores and begun to sell new and used tapes
at his 12 theaters. He got his first taste
of synergy when “Indiana Jones and the

VCR Mania Around the World
The video revolution that is sweeping America has also taken
the rest of the world by storm. In Britain and Japan—two of a
handful of countries where videomania has outpaced the rage in
the United States—roughly a third of all households have VCR’s.
In downtown Taipei, cassette rental shops have cropped up on
almost every corner. Video “bars” and airborne lending libraries
have sprung up in Australia. And in remote parts of India,
merchants travel from village to village peddling equipment and
the latest Western films. “VCR’s are becoming household fix-
tures,” says Klaus Miiller-Neuhof, chairman of West Germany’s
Video Institute: “Someday, every TV will come with one. ”
Video’s chief selling points are accessibility and, increasingly,
price. Mass production and stiff competition have made VCR’s
affordable for large seg-
ments of the world’s popu-
lation. Consumers have
found that the new technol-
ogy gives them a welcome
change from the often
dreary television fare of-
fered in many countries
around the world. And peo-
ple no longer need to wait
for a popular movie to come
to their local theaters. From
Paris to Calcutta, VCR
owners can view such box-
office hits as “Raiders of the
Lost Ark” and “Flash-
dance” in the comfort of
their homes. “It’s a great
alternative for families, es-
pecially with what it costs to
see a movie,” says Stuart
Rubin, an Australian film
distributor. “Video has be-
come the great babysitter.”
Embargo: For all the
excitement, however, the
advent of VCR’s and prere-
corded movies has not been
uniformly welcomed. Most
of the world’s video equip-
ment is made by the Japa-
nese, and some countries
worry that the tide of im-
ports will swamp local man-
ufacturers trying to break
into the market. Taiwan has
banned the sale of Japanese
VCR’s, hoping to preserve
the new market for its own firms. And nearly two years ago,
alarmed at its mounting trade deficit with Japan, France slapped
a de facto embargo on Japanese electronics exporters. For three
months, the government required all VCR’s to be imported
through an understaffed customs house in Poitiers, roughly 100
miles from the nearest port. It also levied a 30 percent “luxury
tax” on both the machines and all imported cassettes.
The video boom has also sparked other worries. In some
countries, it threatens to undermine business at traditional
movie theaters. In Britain and India, people say they are going to
the movies less often, and some Australian cinemas have had to
lower their prices in order to compete with the burgeoning
number of video outlets. Parents and teachers are concerned
that the dizzying abundance of video movies will discourage

young people from reading.
And they are not always
happy about what children
are watching. Films featuring gruesome violence and explicit
pornography—“video nasties,” as they are called in Britain—
are especially popular. In West Germany, such films account for
nearly half of the videotapes bought or rented. Some of them are
truly horrific. In one popular German film, a miniskirted young
woman laughs as she plunges an ice pick into a man’s throat and
then chops him up with an ax. The images are grotesque enough
for adults—and yet a recent survey found that two-thirds of 12-
and 13-year-old schoolchildren in West Germany had seen at
least one such film.
Not surprisingly, a number of countries are now taking steps
to regulate the unbridled distribution of that kind of film. West
German officials are calling for a nationwide cleanup cam-
paign, vowing that “such
trash will disappear from
the market.” Western Aus-
tralia has banned the rental
or sale of any such X-rated
material, and Britain’s Par-
liament is considering new
legislation that would al-
low the government to re-
strict the distribution of
new video releases.
Thefts: Pressure is also
building to control other
abuses —particularly copy-
right violations. In vir-
tually every country where
video has become popular,
“video pirates” have flour-
ished. Last year West Ger-
many’s 5,000 video outlets
earned more than $4OO mil-
lion in the sale and rental of
prerecorded tapes. Indus-
try analysts estimate that
roughly half of these tapes
were “stolen” —that is, un-
lawfully duplicated and
sold without approval. Pi-
rated films account for
about a third of the British
market, and more than 40
percent of Italy’s. The
thefts are frequently bra-
zen. Illegal copies of first-
run movies are often avail-
able within weeks of the
film’s release —depriving
the producer and the film’s
backers of untold millions of dollars in ticket sales. Occasional-
ly, the pirates even get a jump on the theaters: the blockbuster
movie “E.T.” was circulating as a private video in Italy before
it even reached the movie houses.
That as much as anything may indicate the true demand for
the new technology. It is no passing fad. Analysts predict that
60 percent of all British families will one day own a VCR, and
the figures are comparably ambitious for many other countries.
With manufacturers exploring new applications for music,
education and business, the market can only be expected to
grow. For all its problems and excesses, global home video is
here to stay.

Temple of Doom” opened at two of his
theaters: lobby sales of its predecessor,
“Raiders of the Lost Ark,” took off. “We’ll
never stop going to the movies,” says film
historian Ron Haver, owner of 400 cas-
settes and 250 videodiscs. “You never get
over the moviegoing experience where you
sit with 1,000 other people and confront
that larger-than-life image which domi-
nates you in the dark.”
Pay-cable movie services such as Home
Box Office and The Movie Channel have
no such allure, and their pockets are no-
ticeably less swollen these days. Home
video is now growing twice as fast as pay
cable. Movies are generally available on
cassettes six months before they hit the
movie channels, and VCR’s offer vastly
greater selection. Linda and Allen Brum-
low began subscribing to a cable system
last November. “We didn’t get the movie
channels because everyone we know kept
complaining about seeing the same movies
over and over,” Brumlow explains. “We
got the VCR instead.”
The commercial TV networks —and
their advertisers —are also feeling the
home-video crunch. Cable TV and local
stations have already nibbled away at net-
work audiences, and VCR use could take
an even bigger bite. Advertising agency
BBDO predicts that by 1990 networks will
be pulling only 65 percent of the prime-
time audience —down from a lordly 91
TV Sets of the Future
In the snowcapped mountains near Provo, Utah, Robert
Redford and a crew of veteran filmmakers at his Sundance
Institute film workshop recently experimented with a new video
technology—high-definition television (HDTV). To purists, no
video technology can match the quality of 35-mm film. But even
the skeptics at Sundance were impressed: where conventional
television produces only flat, mediocre images, the HDTV
equipment creates sharp images with the stunning appearance of
three-dimensionality.
As a technology, television today is not much different from
what it was when Hopalong Cassidy and the Mouseketeers ruled
the airwaves. The broadcast standards used today were set in
1941; color was introduced in 1954. But with the explosive
growth of VCR’s, computers, cable and other video technol-
ogies, television is on the verge of a major technological transfor-
Providing a sharper image: A 1,125-line, high-definition TV (left) and conventional TV
mation. “The whole nature of the TV set is going to change,”
says Lee Isgur, consumer-electronics analyst for Paine Webber.
The new wave of technological innovation has already begun.
In 1981 Sony introduced its Profeel monitors, breaking the TV
set into separate components. Typically, a component television
system has a high-quality monitor —video screen —that has
seven or eight input and output jacks so that it can display video
signals from VCR’s, video-laser-disc players, a computer, cable
or conventional broadcast television. The tuner, which can pick
up as many as 169 broadcast and cable channels, is a separate
unit. Instead of the small, tinny speakers found on TV sets,
component systems often have full stereo speakers. For those
who want the reverberating “surround-sound” of a movie the-
ater, a Dolby Surround Sound decoder will produce sound on
four speakers, two in front of the viewer and two behind.
Although some VCR’s and laser-disc players provide stereo
sound, broadcast TV does not. But that will soon change:
recently the Federal Communications Commission approved a
new standard that will allow TV stations to broadcast in stereo.
Instead of a single monaural channel, the Zenith/dbx standard
provides three audio channels for each video channel—two for
stereo sound and a third, called SAP for separate audio program,
which broadcasters will likely use for simultaneous foreign-
language broadcasts. (In Japan, where stereo TV has been
available for six years, broadcasters have used the extra audio
channel differently: baseball viewers have a choice of listening to
announcers who root either for or against the hometown team.)
In the United States regular stereo broadcasting for some pro-
grams—such as “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Car-
son” —is expected to begin this fall. Special stereo decoders will
be needed to pick up the signals; the decoders can be plugged into
newer “stereo-ready” TV sets, and some manufacturers are
bringing out models with the decoders built in. (None have
announced decoders for older sets, however.)
Tricks: The next wave in video tech-
nology will be the introduction of digital
television. In a digital-TV set, the con-
ventional analog video and audio signals
are converted and processed in the bina-
ry digital code —a series of ones and
zeros—that computers use. Digital tele-
vision makes it possible to do tricks with
the signals. For instance, the images
can be stored in a memory momentarily
so that ghost images can be canceled
out. Japan’s Matsushita Corp., which
brought out the world’s first digital tele-
vision in June, designed the set so that it
will display two images at once, letting
the Viewer watch one show while moni-
toring a second channel or a VCR or
videodisc playback in a corner of the
screen. A digital set developed by NEC
of Japan can freeze up to four frames in
memory, then print out the images on a
thermal printer. Aside from the innovations it makes possible,
digital technology should eventually cut the cost of television
assembly by putting much of the circuitry on a few silicon chips.
While the first digital-TV sets should be on the American
market by the end of the year, the more exotic technology of
high-definition television will be slower to arrive. HDTV pro-
vides a stunning improvement in picture quality, with much
higher resolution and a wider screen than the old 525-line
standard adopted in 1941. But broadcasters and manufacturers
have not yet agreed on a new standard, and until they do HDTV
will remain only a bright idea. Says William Connolly, president
of Sony Broadcast Products, which has developed an experi-
mental HDTV system: “This is a case where the technology is
ready but the economic hurdles still have to be crossed.”

percent in 1977-78. So far, though, steady
increases in the overall number of homes
with television sets have kept network rev-
enues growing.
And like movie theaters, television net-
works have certain unique assets. For one
thing, many people prefer to watch the
same things that everyone else is watch-
ing—and to watch them at the same time.
“Network TV is here to stay,” says George
Gerbner, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School of Com-
munication. “It’s the only thing that gives
us a sense of commonality as a culture.”
David Poltrack, the ratings expert at CBS,
notes that some of the most commonly
recorded programs are daytime soap op-
eras, which means that VCR’s may be
helping the networks reach millions of
working people they would otherwise miss.
Nor is anything likely to challenge
network-TV advertising as
one of the most effective
ways to launch a new prod-
uct. Even so, advertisers
are exploring ways to get
ads on cassettes, including
the possibility that people
would buy pitch-carrying
cassettes if they were of-
fered at a significantly
lower price.
Formats: While swallow-
ing their Gelusil, worried ex-
ecutives can comfort them-
selves with the thought that
for all their love of gadgets,
Americans have been re-
markably cautious when it
comes to forming lasting at-
tachments to new machines.
Video-game machines and
videodisc players, for exam-
ple, are two innovations that
fell flat; RCA announced
that it will stop producing
videodisc players, which
cannot record material, this
year. But the market is far
from settled. Buyers must still choose be-
tween the two VCR formats, Beta and VHS,
which offer different advantages and draw-
backs in quality and convenience. Beta ma-
chines, popular overseas, account for only a
small portion of domestic VCR sales. The
market could be further complicated by a
new format, 8 mm, which is now being
introduced for use with some portable video
cameras.
Whatever the format, though, home vid-
eo has some strengths that bode well for its
survival. Above all, it appeals to the great
American love of freedom, which these
days is generally synonymous with con-
venience. “We wouldn’t go anywhere on
Friday nights, because we had to be home
by 8 p.m. to watch ‘Dallas’,” says Barbara
Riley. “But now we just tape it and watch
it when we come back.” John Diba, a car-
stereo-store owner in San Francisco, owns
four VCR’s, including one in his car and
one that he sets up outside so he can watch
while soaking in the hot tub.
But VCR’s aren’t just for sybarites, as
Diba attests: “Even my babysitter, the girl
who struggles day to day, has a VCR.” It
can, in fact, be highly cost-effective. With
rental tapes available for as little as 99
cents a night, an evening at home can be
much cheaper than a trek to the movie
theater. Shelly Berger’s son Joshua, 17,
who lives down the block from his di-
vorced father in Beverly Hills, brings girl-
friends to his father’s paneled media room
to watch movies on the VCR. “It’s become
a cheap date for him,” says Berger. “He’ll
pop in a couple of movies and wait for his
dear old dad to order sushi.”
The comforts of home require no sacri-
fice in selectivity: 200 titles, old and new, hit
the market each month, and most films are
available on tape within a year of release.
‘Now, remember, feed the cats twice a day, water the plants once a week, and
this is a list of the programs we want videotaped ’
DRAWING BY LEVIN © 1979 THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE, INC.
While the popularity of X-rated tapes,
which once held 80 percent of the market,
has cooled, children’s programming is hot:
Disney cassettes are so popular that toddlers
swap them in nursery school. And when all
else palls, video cameras have created a new
genre, “domestic drama,” homemade tapes
of a daughter’s 40-point basketball game, for
example, that she can study to improve her
defense. The advent of cheap, portable cam-
eras, in fact, may give a significant boost to
VCR sales.
There is another side to the programming
versatility of VCR’s: many adults use them
to control what their children see. Says
Atlanta mother Amy Misner, “I don’t like
the idea of my chidren spending a lot of time
in front of the tube. But I’d rather they’d
watch an hour of Disney than 10 minutes of
cartoons.”
Whether people are watching soap op-
eras or “La Traviata,” though, the truth is
that for a nation already hopelessly addict-
ed to television, VCR’s furnish yet another
excuse for spending time in front of the tube,
“I have people who come in and watch
between four and seven movies a week,”
says Michael Pollack, co-owner of New
Video in New York. “I worry about them,
Sometimes I say, ‘Go read a book, go talk to
somebody’.” Yet VCR’s can be liberating.
“We used to watch a lot of shows to get to a
show,” says Barbara Riley. “Now we just
set the timer. We’re watching less TV.” And
of course, some people are immune to the
VCR’s charms. When New York writer
Michael Wolff learned his wife was preg-
nant, he immediately bought a VCR in an-
ticipation of long evenings at home. But he
hardly uses it. “When you can watch any-
thing you want, there’s no sense of urgency,
so you end up watching nothing,” says
Wolff. He has only used $9O of the $lOO in
free rentals he got for join-
ing the video club at Video
Connection. He even
bought a camera to make
videotapes of his daughter,
Elizabeth, but “they made
her look like a bank rob-
ber.” Wolff, of course, is
probably the kind of person
who still reads books; hard-
ly typical.
How-to Tapes: Where, in
fact, do the humble book-
sellers stand amid all this
video turmoil? As ABC’s
Michael Dann sees it, they
could end up big winners.
“Entertainment will not be
the basis for the VCR’s suc-
cess in the long term,” he
says. Jane Fonda’s “Work-
out” is just the beginning:
Dann bets that instruc-
tional programming of all
kinds, from cooking to car-
pentry, will have enormous
appeal. Some publishers
have already begun. Simon
and Schuster, for example, plans to sell
video cassettes in bookstores and price them
only slightly higher than hard-cover books.
“I don’t know where this market will take
us,” says chairman Snyder, “but I do know
there is a lot of room out there for nonthea-
trical video.”
If Snyder is right, and the VCR comes to
be a vehicle for delivering new kinds of
programming, it may yet enhance the cul-
tural landscape. Chances are, though, that
it will remain just a new way of watching the
same old stuff. Technical revolutions gener-
ally have not produced cultural advances,
and perhaps they should not be expected to.
The VCR is pretty nifty as gadgets go, and
that alone seems to ensure that it will take
up permanent residence in the American
home, right alongside the beloved box.

Matsushita in Video Technology
HI-FI VHS BY NATIONAL
CONCERTS AND MOVIES
WILL NEVER SOUND THE SAME
The new Hi-Fi VHS audio system in our
NV-850 video cassette recorder offers true high
fidelity sound reproduction. Profoundly superior
to the conventional VTR. And better even than
almost all audio cassette or open reel decks. In
fact, this versatile video component, equipped
with audio level meters, can double as a hi-fi
audio deck capable of 4 uninterrupted hours*
of brilliant recording.
National Hi-Fi VHS employs two rapidly
rotating audio heads on the video head cylinder,
in addition to a conventional fixed audio head,
to produce a relative tape-to-head speed more
than 200 times faster than the fixed head design.
And we have adopted a new FM (Frequency
Modulation) conversion method for sound record-
ing. Quite simply, the tremendous increase in
tape-to-head speed and the FM conversion method
create a tremendous improvement in sound qual-
ity when Hi-Fi VHS is connected
to your audio system.
The specs speak for them-
selves. Hi-Fi VHS boasts a greatly
extended, flat frequency response
of 20Hz—20kHz (DIN). And an
extremely wide dynamic range of
more than 80dB.
The thrilling sound of Hi-Fi VHS is the
perfect partner for National’s celebrated VTR
picture performance. The NV-850’s innovative
3-video-head system delivers completely clear,
jitter-free playback in our Super Still mode. A
rugged, one-piece aluminium die-cast chassis that
provides optimum contact between video heads
and tape, and our famous quartz-locked direct
drive motors that perform with incredible 99.999
percent rotational accuracy—both original devel-
opments—form the foundation for this rock-solid
picture quality.
Performance like this doesn’t come easily.
It’s the product of a huge commitment to R&D
from Japan’s largest consumer electronics group,
Matsushita Electric. A commitment that’s made
us a frequent source of new video technology
and the world’s leading manufacturer of home
video equipment.

THE OLYMPICS
A Gold Mine in Los Angeles
The first Summer Games in 52 years to be held on American soil get underway.
They sang of America as it should be, and
sometimes is. And saints, or the reason-
able facsimile thereof, came marching in.
Everybody who owned a flag or a fliigelhorn
wanted to be in that number, it seemed, when
the XXIII modern Olympiad began. From
the moment a solo flyer powered by a jet pack
whooshed in and landed on the field, it was
the kind of extravaganza that only Holly-
wood could hatch. Even as the sky above the
Los Angeles Coliseum filled with pigeons,
balloons and tiny parachutes, street vendors
hawked “To Hell With Russia” T shirts
($l2) that will never be more fashionable
than at that precise moment in 1984. Ath-
letes from a record 140 countries marched
around the Wi -acre infield—just as another
generation of Olympians had done in the
Summer Games of 1932. And hearts pound-
ed. But the mounting emotions weren’t re-
leased until, with dusk falling, Gina
Hemphill, the granddaughter of Jesse
Owens, jogged in and ended the guessing
about the identity of the torchbearer: there
were two, Hemphill and 1960 decathlon
champion Rafer Johnson. As 88,000
cheered, Johnson glided gracefully up a
white staircase and, with a mixture of patri-
otism and fierce pride, lit the flame.
And so the Games began.
These ceremonies also marked the ending
of a five-year effort to mount the first profit-
making Olympics ever. By aggressively
marketing the sportsfest to corporate spon-
sors around the world, the Los Angeles
Olympic Organizing Committee president
Peter Ueberroth, 46, a self-made million-
aire, produced a project surplus of approxi-
mately $l2 million. Speaking of the hugely
successful coast-to-coast torch relay con-
ceived under his administration, Ueberroth
recently hailed “the biggest outpouring of
patriotism since World War II.” President
Ronald Reagan, who declared the Games
open, had voiced that same theme earlier in
the day when he visited American athletes in
the Olympic Village at the University of
Southern California. Stealing a line from orte
of his own movies, the president urged the
nation’s hopefuls to “win one for the Gip-
per”—and spoke of a New Patriotism. “My
heart will be stopped for three hours or two
weeks,” his wife, Nancy, added in an emo-
tional postscript, “however long it takes.”
The eruption of spirit came just in time.
Los Angeles had slipped into strange pre-
Olympic doldrums as the ceremonies drew
near: traffic was actually lighter than nor-
mal, hotel bookings were markedly down
over the same period a year ago and store
managers were reporting sluggish summer
sales. Even the airport had an ambience
somehow reminiscent of Dayton, Ohio.
(“The whole Olympics,” observed Holly-
wood Reporter columnist George Christy,
“makes you want to yawn.”) In fact, many
residents had left town to avoid a tourist
crush that was materializing only slowly.
Indeed, given the poor exchange rates that
discouraged foreign travelers, and the less-
ening of interest caused by the boycott, the
worst-case scenarios of a totally gridlocked
and smog-choked L.A. may prove no more
justified than the rumor (heard often last
week) that Michael Jackson would moon-
walk the torch into the Coliseum. Not that
the relative stillness was having any effect
on certain anxious Angelenos: even as the
black-market price of many tickets fell to
face value—and police spoke of a huge drop
in crime around the Coliseum area —psy-

The athletes, behind their smiles and
waves, were equally edgy. With their mo-
ment in the hazy sunshine at hand, many
Olympians complained about overzealous
security personnel (police and guards at the
three athletes’ villages were especially vigi-
lant in their pursuit of autographs), overly
efficient shuttle buses (“In my country we
are kings, ’ ’ said an Egyptian athlete who was
left behind one morning. “The buses wait for
us”) and overcrowded conditions. The loud-
est howls came from the downtown dorm
rooms at USC, where as many as 10 Olympi-
ans were packed into modest, two-room
suites. “It’s sad,’’said Ghanaian triplejump-
er Francis DoDoo. “We have practice at 10,
but if you want to take a shower, you have to
wake up at 6.” Added Swedish team phys-
iotherapist Inger Tobell: “I can tell you, the
beds were better in Moscow and Sarajevo.”
The host Americans, also billeted at USC,
seemed not much more enthusiastic: at last
Wednesday’s flag-raising welcoming cere-
mony for the 615-member U.S. team, only
70 or so athletes bothered to show up. Con-
spicuously absent were such superstars as
long-distance runner Mary Decker, long
jumper/sprinter Carl Lewis and high jump-
er Dwight Stones, who had threatened to
boycott the village altogether.
Migraines: By far the grimmest depic-
tions of life in the villages came, however,
from the Soviet press, which quickly picked
up on any expressions of dissatisfaction—
and embellished them with dubious anec-
dotes about runners who only narrowly
escaped death while jogging on the L.A.
freeways, about athletes with smog-induced
migraines and Angelenos confined to their
homes by the filthy air. Sounding more stri-
dent than ever as the Games began, Moscow
news agencies depicted L.A. last week as a
city whose “scorching air” is conducive only
to “gangsters and pornographers.” Local
residents have been warned, said Izvestia,
“not to leave their homes, and to turn up
their air conditioners full blast. ” Every erup-
tion of senseless violence—including the
McDonald’s massacre in San Ysidro two
weeks ago and an incident in the Westwood
neighborhood the night before the Games,
when a deranged driver plowed through a
screaming crowd on the sidewalk, killing
one and injuring 57—is made to serve as
proof to the Soviets that their decision to

boycott the Games for security reasons was
obviously well founded.
But Chinese correspondents, covering
their teams’ first appearance at a Summer
Olympics in 32 years, painted a much differ-
ent picture for readers back in the People’s
Republic. One Chinese news agency saw its
athletes’ facilities on the lush UCLA cam-
pus—the Olympic organizers had thought-
fully housed the Taiwanese team across
town at USC—as an adventure in “electron-
ic living.” Women’s basketball captain Song
Xiabo pronounced the dormitory rooms
“comfortable” and the food “delicious.”
And though some members
of the delegation thought
there was an excessive num-
ber of LAOOC security heli-
copters buzzing the village
and griped about commer-
cialization, their biggest
problem, according to Chi-
na Youth News, was that the
local Chinese community
was tossing “too many par-
ties for us to cope with.”
Encouraging: For all their
grousing, more than a few
Olympians were whooping
it up in frat-house fashion as
they waited for their turn.
Immediately after checking
into the American head-
quarters at USC, swimmers
John Moffet and Mike
O’Brien commandeered an
electric cart reserved for
VlP’s and the elderly and
tore around the gaily fes-
tooned campus streets with
an LAOOC official in hot
pursuit. At the UCLA vil-
lage, Dutch swimmer Elies
Voskes broke the tension by having the on-
site Vidal Sassoon salon style her hair in a
punkish re-creation of the Olympic rings,
which they then dyed red, black, yellow,
blue and green, the official colors. The
UCLA village nightspot, called Champs,
was proving popular, too: “Maybe I can’t
What Makes Willie Jump?
World-class athletes, like the rich, are
different from you and me. Physical strain
and self-denial are their constant compan-
ions. Without guarantee of either riches or
celebrity, personal lives and careers go on
hold. Difficult choices must be made. But in
the end, all reap their own rewards, as Mar-
tin Kasindorf, a Newsweek national cor-
respondent, reports:
Willie Banks has already flunked his bar
exam twice and may never become presi-
dent. But even if his hoped-for legal and
political careers fail, he will have already
left his mark on the world. Many before
him have become lawyers; no one but Wil-
lie Banks ever brought glamour to the
sport of triple jumping.
In track and field the triple jump, with
its weird rhythm, has been the garage-band
warm-up for dash-and-leap headliners. It
seems awkward: first a 40-meter sprint
ending in a hop that finishes on the takeoff
foot; then a step landing on the opposite
foot, and finally a long leap to a sandy pit.
Enter UCLA law grad Banks: “I like to
compare [the triple jump] to ballet,” he
says. “It’s beautiful, it’s graceful and it
deserves notice.” This year it gets its no-
tice: the finals will be held this Saturday
afternoon, in prime sports-viewing time.
Much of this event’s new color comes
from Banks’s warm-ups. Like a pro wres-
tler entering the ring, he faces the crowd
and demands both attention and response.
He will borrow the public-address system
and welcome the crowd. He will clap his
hands, begging for audience involvement.
If that doesn’t work, he will retake the
mike. “Hi everybody, this is Willie again,”
he announced at a meet last May. “The
triple jumpers have decided to dedicate
this round to Mother’s Day.”
As jump time nears, Banks slips on a
Walkman and stretches for all to see to the
beat of Funkadelic. (Olympic officials have
threatened to ban radios from the Coliseum
infield.) The by-then-revved crowd follows
Banks to his start, where he claps several
times, then starts his sprint. Generally, the
psych-up tricks have worked: Banks owns
the U.S. outdoor record of 57 feet IV2
inches and was a favorite for the aborted
1980 Games. This week he is expected to
challenge for the gold. “I’ve got to win,”
says Banks, promising to “use that moment
to build the triple jump. In my TV interview
afterward, I’ll ask, ‘Wasn’t that exciting’’?”
Banks, who took up the sport on a lark as
a 16-year-old in Oceanside, Calif., broke
the league record on his first high-school
jump. He shortly received a full scholar-
ship to UCLA, where he hoped to exploit
his athletic ability in behalf of education.
Then came the first blast of glory.
Amazed: In 1975 freshman Banks
neared the line at the end of a hotly contest-
ed dual meet with archrival USC. He
jumped two feet past his previous best, won
the meet for UCLA and was carried off the
field on the shoulders of his amazed team-
mates. That instant, says Banks, still ranks
as “the greatest moment of my life.”
But the taste of heroism didn’t linger.
Self-doubts surfaced over the hours Banks
spent each day jumping into sand when he
could be studying in the library. Then, in
1978, he was carried off the field again—
this time on a stretcher. With his back
badly injured and his scholastic ambitions
imperiled, Banks decided to quit the sport.
“I had always thought it was somewhat
degrading to be an athlete,” he remembers.
“[But] once I stopped, I realized I enjoyed
doing it. I was, in fact, an athlete. It was a
revelation.” Banks came back to the sport
and has ranked among the world’s top five

make it in athletics,” laughed Malaysian
middle-distance runner B. Rajkumar, “but
I can be king of the disco. The girls here are
very friendly, very sweet.” And one still
unknown swimmer used the computer sys-
tem at the AT&T communications center to
send electronic psych-out messages (“Good
luck, but I will be first”) to American back-
stroke champion—and gold-medal favor-
ite—Rick Carey. At the picturesque ocean-
front campus of the University of California
at Santa Barbara, meanwhile, rowers and
canoers happily “carbo-loaded”—stoked
up on carbohydrates—and went for long
moonlight strolls along the Pacific. Most
encouraging of all, however, was the calm
response to the organizers’ policy of mixing
unfriendly nations at the same village—
India and Pakistan at USC, Cyprus, Greece
and Turkey all at UCLA—in hopes that
would-be terrorists would not blow up
friends along with enemies.
By the weekend even Decker, Lewis and
Stones were softening. All three bowed to
the U.S. Olympic Committee’s insistence
that they abandon plans to live off campus
and had indicated a willingness to mingle
with the 7,800 other athletes —if only for
the few days they will actually be compet-
ing. Lewis’s manager, Joe Douglas, warned,
however, that “the first time it gets noisy,
Carl will check out and stay at a private
home” —and Decker’s coach, Dick Brown,
stressed that Mary’s stay would be “for the
minimally obligated amount of time.”
Meanwhile, Lewis himself was raising an in
absentia ruckus, thanks to a Sports Illus-
trated article in which he criticized 400-
meter hurdling champion Edwin Moses for
bad-mouthing American track-and-field
fans—and, worse yet, not thanking him for
some unspecified career advice. Moses, the
official captain of the American men’s team
and, at 28, a senior spokesman, responded
last week at a press conference at which his
German-born wife, Myrella, grabbed the
microphone to say that “it was Carl who
came to us asking how to do things with the
public and how to deal with promoters in
Europe. And he never said thank you.
That’s his style, I guess.” Moses himself
said only that Lewis’s stance “doesn’t
make sense .. . It’s unfortunate for him,
not for me.”
Touchy: In contrast to those angry Olym-
pians, there was the International Olympic
Committee, which provided yet another les-
son in how to duck controversy. Instead of
settling the question of whether nations
should be banned from the Games for boy-
cotting, as it had planned to do in Los
Angeles, the lOC decided to postpone de-
bate on the subject until December. That
meeting, to be held in Lausanne, Switzer-
land, will be an “extraordinary session,” the
lOC insisted —but it will only be that if the
Olympic lords and commissars actually
take a stand on that touchy political ques-
tion once and for all. In L.A. last week,
however, the lOC did at least speak with
certainty in the case of Jeff 1 Michels, the
American weight lifter who sought eligibil-
ity despite a two-year suspension by
the International Weightlifting Federation
after traces of testosterone, a steroid, were
triple jumpers in six of the past seven years.
Seven years is several generations in
track and field, however, and Banks needs
ever-increasing doses of emotion and tech-
nique to get the distances he needs to win.
Outside the arena, the strain is also evi-
dent. Banks’s hectic training schedule may
account for his two bar-exam failures,
along with his deferral of marriage.
Plunged into depression when his girl-
friend left him for postdoctoral study in
Europe, he put in a nervous jump that just
barely qualified at the Olympic trials. “I’ve
got another love,” he now says.“ That’s my
triple jump.”
So he puts off the things most ambitious,
2 8-year-old law-school graduates actively
seek. Banks realizes how a highly publi-
cized gold medal might help him with his
law career, or in a run for office. But there
is more to his Funkadelic-inspired pit per-
formances than self-promotion. Haunted
by the memory of that moment on his
teammates’ shoulders, Willie Banks says
that “emotion is what makes or breaks me.
I can draw that emotion from so many
other people. I doubted myself so many
times before the trials. But I need to win a
gold medal, and I’m going to do it. I’m an
Olympian now, and no one can take that
away from me.”
Triple jumper Banks at home: After seven years at the top, driven by emotion
LESTER SLOAN— Newsweek


found in his system during the Pan Am
Games last summer. Citing their policy of
allowing individual sports federations the
final say in such matters, the committee said
that Michels, once Americas’s best lifter,
would not be allowed to compete.
An American cyclist did manage to sides-
tep allegations of drug use, albeit barely.
Alexi Grewal, 23, was dropped from the
Olympic squad when a relatively unsophis-
ticated urine test taken after a Colorado
bike race earlier this month revealed traces
of the banned substance phenylethylamine.
In his appeal, Grewal pointed out that an
asthma remedy he uses with USOC permis-
sion belongs to the same family of drugs,

and that he had been tested by a method too
imprecise to tell the difference between the
two substances. He added that shortly be-
fore the test he had taken what he thought
was an energy-boosting herbal tablet —
from a container labeled in Chinese —which
may also have affected the result. Ultimate-
ly, the USOC review panel agreed that the
exact substance found in GrewaPs body had
not been determined —and allowed him
back into the 190-kilometer road race.
Now that the Games have begun, drug
use will not be subject to debate. Accord-
ing to Dr. Anthony Daly, the chief medical
officer for the LAOOC, the ultrasensitive
equipment at the UCLA Medical Center
can detect an illegal substance at a concen-
tration of 1 part per billion —“the equiv-
alent of one sugar cube in a swimming
pool” —even if the drug was injected up to
four months ago. If an athlete challenges
the $2 million setup, says Daly, “he just
can’t win.”
No Appeal: Meanwhile, a federal judge
disallowed freestyle wrestler Lee Roy
Smith’s claim that he’d been unfairly ma-
neuvered off the team after an apparent
victory in a protest match —and named ri-
val Randy Lewis to compete in the 136.5-
pound class. The Arperican Arbitration As-
sociation ruled that the U.S. Yacht Racing
Union’s decision to give Finn-class sailor
John Bertrand an Olympic berth, following
the disqualification for fouling of seeming
winner Russ Silvestri, was not subject to
appeal. And in a development that could
weigh heavily on some Olympians, the mak-
ers of Puma running shoes filed a $3.5 mil-
lion suit against four female track stars
—middle-distance runner Kim Gallagher,
heptathlete Jodi Anderson, high jumper
Pam Spencer and hurdler Pam Page—for
repudiating endorsement contracts before
the deadline and switching to Adidas.
Then there was Bomber, the bald eagle
who was supposed to soar high over the
opening ceremonies. He died last week, re-
portedly from stress. It was hoped, as the
Games at last began, that he was just an old
bird, not an omen.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Forget Numbers With This Phone
It’s often difficult to remember the phone numbers of your
friends, relatives and business associates without turning to
that dogeafed address book in the desk drawer. A new French-
made phone on the market may do away with all that. The
Alpha X allows a caller to ring up another person just by typing
in his or her name on a typewriter-style keyboard. The phone
can be programmed easily to store up to 255 names and
corresponding phone numbers —many more than most people
call regularly. Phone numbers
can be assigned to any combi-
nation of up to eight letters.
The sleek, black phone has a
fluorescent display that shows
the letter combination as it
is entered, and the number
called. Phone numbers of up to
24 digits can be stored, allow-
ing easy long-distance or over-
seas calls. The telephone works
on any phone line and connects
to most plug-in jacks. An AC
outlet provides the power, al-
though a battery protects the
memory from being erased in
case of a power cutoff. These same features make the Alpha X a
portable phone that can be taken on business trips in its own
carrying case. The unit measures 10 Vi by 9 by 3 Vi inches and
weighs 3Vi pounds. The phone has a hold button, a last-
number redial feature and a speaker that allows the caller to
wait before picking up the handset until he or she hears the
other party answer. A key-lock mechanism also protects the
memory against tampering. The Alpha X is made by General
Electronique Europeen of Par-
is and costs $550. It is also
available by mail order from
The Sharper Image Catalog of
San Francisco for $589.
Cushion for the Tub
Modern technology has
helped greatly in enabling the
physically handicapped to join
the mainstream of society.
Nevertheless, several everyday
tasks remain difficult to ac-
complish alone. For many,
bathing is one such task. Now,
a small company that is based
in Washington, D.C., has de-
veloped an inexpensive, porta-
ble device employing simple
technology that could go a
long way toward helping
handicapped, injured or aged
people free themselves from
the need to have others help them get in and out of a bathtub.
The Bathomatic Hydrocushion Independent Bathing Sys-
tem consists of a heavy-gauge vinyl cushion that fits standard
bathtubs. The cushion is attached to the bathtub faucet or to
the shower head with a universal adapter and is filled with
warm water. The user then can maneuver onto the cushion,
Alpha X telephone: No need for dogeared address books
Carrying case: Protecting the goods while on the road
and, once seated, pull a drawstring, which opens a valve in the
cushion, releasing the water. As the tub fills, the person is
gently lowered into the tub. When finished bathing, the user
closes the valve, opens the drain and turns on the water to refill
the cushion and make it easier to get out of the tub. The
Bathomatic system is manufactured by International Health-
care Products, Inc. The cushion, adapter and optional carrying
case weigh about 14 pounds when empty. Also available are a
backrest that attaches to the cushion, and a transfer board that
would make it easier for some to slide onto the cushion. The
polyvinyl cushion cleans easi-
ly, holds about 25 gallons of
water —the amount usually
needed to fill a tub —and will
support a person weighing
more than 300 pounds. The
price of the basic system
is $369.50.
Computer Cases
The powerful portable com-
puters currently on the market
are a boon for the traveling
businessperson who now can
easily send and receive docu-
ments to and from the home office. These sensitive and increas-
ingly expensive devices are often exposed to great rigors during
travel, however. One of America’s largest luggage manufac-
turers, American Tourister of Warren, R. 1., has recently
applied its expertise to produce a line of equipment cases
specially designed for carrying computer and electronic
equipment.
The hard-sided cases are made of high-impact plastic with a
foam-rubber interior custom-
ized to hold the computer and
various peripheral devices. Ex-
cept for a slightly high-tech
look that the company has giv-
en them, the cases resemble the
traditional briefcases made by
American Tourister and don’t
draw attention to the fact that a
valuable computer is inside.
The construction of the com-
puter cases is more rugged than
that of the briefcases and most
luggage, however.
American Tourister already
offers cases to hold portables
made by Epson, Sharp, NEC,
Radio Shack and Convergent
Technologies. A case designed
for the Epson FX-80 printer is
also available, as are larger
models designed to hold the
IBM PC and Apple lie. The
company says that it plans to
manufacture cases for other new computers as they are intro-
duced. The suggested price for the small cases is $ 105 and $ 145
for the large models, considerably less than the cost of heavier
metal cases. American Tourister also is producing soft cases to
hold computers and electronics equipment.

THE BULLETIN
NEIGHBORHOOD
Lange and his
deregulator take control
New Zealand’s Labor government is by necessity having a working honeymoon in
an effort to cure the country’s economic woes. lAN TEMPLETON looks at the
dynamic young team which Prime Minister David Lange has put together for the
task of restoring growth and prosperity and the approach which it may take.
AFTER ESCAPING the grip of the
politician who may come to be known
as New Zealand’s Iron Chancellor, the
nation is basking even if briefly in
the sunlight of the new Lange Labor
government. It has brought a change
not only of style but also of pace in the
beehive wing of parliament which
houses the executive arm of the admin-
istration.
The Muldoon team has given way to
fresh faces whose average age is 45.
More significantly, perhaps, three of
the top ministers are in their 30s and
they give David Lange (41) and Deputy
Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer (42) al-
most a venerable look. The new leader
clearly hopes to instil the dynamism of
youth in his regime.
Lange took office having given few
hostages to electoral fortune and
those he can redeem much later. The
atmosphere meanwhile is strangely eu-
phoric.
Lange promised reconciliation. Al-
ready he has won over the trade unions
who have agreed to forgo wage claims.
The crusty president of the Federation
of Labor, Jim Knox, has appeared on
the platform of the annual conference
of federated farmers preaching sweet
reasonableness. And Ron Trotter, boss
of the country’s biggest conglomerate
Fletcher Challenge is reported to
have been invited to help run the econ-
omic “summit” that Lange believes can
emulate Australia’s Hawke model in re-
uniting sectors which have been war-
ring.
It is, of course, in the economic sec-
tor that the Labor team must discover a
new dynamic if it is to push the country
back onto the path of steady economic
growth and rising prosperity.
Even some of Muldoon’s colleagues
have blanched at the revelations of the
last days of his reign.
Lange professes to be no economic
wizard, so he is looking to those he has
placed in the key economic portfolios to
Roger Douglas: a consistent advocate for the removal of subsidies and tax incentives
draw up a program to lift New Zealand
out of the stagflationary swamp in
which it has been stuck for the past dec-
ade.
Roger Douglas, 46, the Minister of
Finance, will be working closely with
two associate ministers of Finance:
David Caygill, 35 (who is also Minister
of Trade and Industry), and Richard
Prebble, 36 (Minister of Transport).
In forming this mini-cabinet for
economic policy-making, Lange is
making rather vividly the point that
such affairs no longer will be under the
complete domination of one man.
Sir Robert Muldoon, in holding the
Finance portfolio as well as the prime
ministership, had acquired virtual presi-
dential powers. With his own network
of advisers, he had reached the point
where he frequently rejected the advice
of Treasury and the Reserve Bank and
expected cabinet to be little more than a
rubber stamp for the policies he had
chosen.
Whether Lange’s concept will work
remains to be seen. It could be sug-
gested that he has split the responsibility
up so that no one might outshine the
Prime Minister. Yet Douglas, Prebble
and Caygill are among Lange’s most
loyal henchmen. Douglas has supplied
the basic philosophic thrust to what pol-
icy the Labor leader has enunciated.
It was Douglas who four years ago
started a campaign to shake first his
party and then the country out of its
economic lethargy. He said then that
New Zealand was sliding backward so
rapidly that its standard of living might
be the lowest of any country in the de-
veloped world by the year 2000.
The system had failed, he argued,
and tinkering with it was no use; New


Zealand needed radical innovations.
The public would have to participate
fully if those changes were to take effect.
Douglas criticises past governments
for taking soft options. The nation, he
says, can no longer duck the hard de-
cisions.
It is not surprising, then, to find
Douglas saying in an economic paper
he prepared two years ago: “I would
immediately devalue by 20 percent.”
New Zealand still awaits the full effects
of this recent move. Douglas also has
consistently advocated the removal of
subsidies and tax incentives to all indus-
tries, including farming. In proposing
reforms of the tax system he has argued
that the basic principle should be to
promote an increase in the output of
goods and services, to share that in-
crease among those who contribute to it
and among those who are dis-
advantaged and cannot contribute.
Now, as Douglas and his colleagues
begin work on the budget expected at
the end of the three-month price freeze,
there is considerable speculation about
how far they will go with some of the
radical tax options he has canvassed.
The time constraint may limit how
far he can go in this budget, particularly
as the first priority will be to aim what-
ever assistance is possible to the low-
income families who have been hardest
hit by higher costs arising from devalu-
ation. But, given his track record, there
will be surprise if those bold programs
he has consistently urged on the country
are left on the shelf more than a year or
two.
For example: he put forward two
years ago a reform package that would
have abolished personal and company
tax through a shift to taxing wealth,
some business inputs, gifts and retail
sales. Douglas argued that those
changes could increase net wages and
social welfare benefits by 20 percent.
Douglas has contended that the sys-
tem of taxing the net income of com-
panies, partnerships and farms engaged
in productive activity encourages tax
avoidance and discourages productive
investment. A company owning a
$200,000 pleasure boat would pay the
same tax on that item as on $200,000
machinery or stock. He has said, too,
that the system of taxing the gross in-
come of individuals encourages avoid-
ance, bad work habits and the under-
ground economy. His argument is that
personal income tax should be replaced
by a flat payroll tax on wages, allow-
ances and “perks”.
Just how hard Douglas pushes for
radical solutions to New Zealand’s
economic problems will become evident
over the next few months. Pent-up en-
ergy certainly is there, waiting to be re-
leased. It depends on whether he can
find the right trigger. □
THE PACIFIC
ANZUS or
no, the links
are strong
The ANZUS council meeting in Wellington: at the brink of the unthinkable
By FEDOR MEDIANSKY
lian and New Zealand concern over a
resurgent post-war Japan, at a time
when the US was pushing a soft peace
treaty to bolster Japan’s reconstruction.
To this day, the US continues to press
Japan to develop its military capabili-
ties, while Australia along with its
South east Asian neighbors is con-
cerned that Japan should not play a
military role in the region.
The proponents of ANZUS often ar-
gue that the treaty is part of the fabric of
Western deterrence which contributes
to a world order based on shared values.
And so it is. Still, Lange could well ask,
“What common values?” when, in the
immediate wake of an election, a gov-
ernment not yet installed is already
threatened with all manner of things
including economic sanctions if it
fails to continue with an arrangement
which has been repudiated by the elec-
torate, which it is not legally obliged to
do; and which is not a strategic neces-
sity.
Of course, as a matter of principle,
Shultz was quite right in saying that an
alliance in which the parties can’t inter-
act isn’t much of an alliance. The prob-
lem with this approach is that alliances
tend to become unduly inflexible when
conducted on the high plain of prin-
ciple. Remember the long Russian pipe-
line and the strain in the Atlantic al-
liance when Ronald Reagan decided to
stand on principle?
Lange would be on reasonably firm
ground especially with a little support
from across the Tasman if, while
sticking to his platform, he conceded
that in the event of strategic necessity
his government would review its stance
so as to accommodate the security needs
of the alliance.
ANZUS lacks most of the elements
that bind alliances. It lacks a clear se-
curity guarantee as well as a common
adversary focus. It also has little by way
of integrative standing military arrange-
“ANZUS at risk if Lange stands firm on
barring US nuclear ships from New
Zealand.” Well, that’s what the head-
lines said with just a little help from
US Secretary of State George Shultz
and Wellington’s defeated conservative
government.
As always, the politicians in Can-
berra responded faithfully and pre-
dictably on cue. The opposition
reportedly “called for,” and govern-
ment officials were “looking at,” signing
a bilateral pact with the US should
the Lange government stick to its party
platform and should the Reagan Ad-
ministration follow through with
Shultz’s dire warnings.
While the ANZUS foreign ministers
were hovering on the brink of the un-
thinkable in Wellington, no one seems
to have gone that critical step further
and asked: Is ANZUS likely to collapse
and will it really make any difference if
it does?
The answer to both these questions,
it can be argued, is “No.” This, of
course, does not mean that Australia’s
security links with the US and with
New Zealand are either endangered
or are, otherwise, of little value.
ANZUS is another matter. Except in
symbolic terms, it is not much of a
treaty. ANZUS lacks just about all the
attributes that give coherence and sub-
stance to a treaty relationship. Unlike
NATO and US-Japan security pacts,
ANZUS lacks a common adversary fo-
cus. It came into being through Austra-


Prime Minister Hawke, with Defence Secretary Weinberger, at the Pentagon
UPI
ments such as joint planning, joint com-
mand and joint deployments. Yet these
integrative arrangements play an essen-
tial part in America’s major alliance
systems in the north Atlantic and across
the north Pacific.
Despite the deficiencies of ANZUS,
successive Australian governments have
regarded the treaty as essential. Sir
Robert Menzies called it the corner-
stone of the nation’s defence and Bob
Hawke echoed that assessment
though rather inelegantly - when he de-
scribed the treaty as “foundational.”
Of course, politicians have long
understood the deep attachment of the
Australian electorate to the American
alliance and the consequent danger of
appearing to weaken it. So they have
come to mythologising ANZUS, to the
extent that they believe their own rhet-
oric. This in turn has made the clear-
headed management of the alliance so
much more difficult.
A clearer understanding of “the Am-
erican alliance” could well begin by
divorcing the treaty from the substan-
tive ties that link Australia and the US.
This essential de-linking would make it
more evident that the Australian-US se-
curity relationship is bilateral and not
triangular. Consequently, the weaken-
ing of links between the US and New
Zealand would have little impact on our
links with the US or our links with
New Zealand.
Even a brief look at the security ties
between Australia and the US make
clear that these have little to do with the
treaty and even less with New Zealand.
The ties that really bind fall under three
headings: intelligence links, the US de-
fence facilities in Australia and major
defence programs.
The intelligence links with the US go
back to wartime co-operation before
ANZUS. Furthermore, they are based
on numerous agreements many
secret, some bilateral. Tripartite intelli-
gence consultations do take place be-
tween the three ANZUS partners, but
these are by no means essential to the
Australia-US intelligence relationship.
While Australian governments have
for years linked the US, “joint” defence
facilities to the ANZUS Treaty, the link
is fallacious. As Foreign Affairs Minis-
ter Bill Hayden acknowledged in parlia-
ment last year, North-West Cape and
the other stations are not linked to any
“specific ANZUS obligation, and they
are in any case bilateral arrangements
as New Zealand is not involved.” In
fact the siting of the Omega navigation
station in Australia was apparently due
to New Zealand’s reluctance to host it.
Wellington’s reluctance on this was not
made an acid test of alliance solidarity.
Few Australia-US defence programs
are based on, or otherwise depend on,
ANZUS or trilateral co-operation. For
the US, strategically important arrange-
ments involve the staging of B-52s
through Darwin and the regular visit of
US warships in Western Australia. Both
these and other co-operative arrange-
ments are designed to support the US
posture in the Indian Ocean on a bilat-
eral basis. More important,
they are “out-of-area” be-
cause ANZUS is, by defini-
tion, a Pacific pact.
For Australia the programs
of greatest value include those
that provide access to sophis-
ticated defence technology
and hardware. Here again, the
relevant agreements are bilat-
eral and stand independent of
ANZUS.
It is often overlooked that
Australia has important se-
curity links with New Zealand
but ANZUS does not play an
essential part in them. New
Zealand is our oldest treaty
partner. The 1944 ANZAC
pact pre-dates ANZUS and
continues to be the basis of a
far more ambitious set of se-
curity links than those at-
tempted between Australia
and the US. Nor should it be
overlooked that public
opinion in New Zealand dis-
tinguishes between links with
Australia and links with the
US.
What, then, is left for
ANZUS? Very little. It is the
basis for regular, high-level trilateral
consultations between the allies. Yet the
highest consultations normally take
place bilaterally.
Why, then, all the fuss about the pos-
sible demise of ANZUS? Partly, it’s due
to cultural factors; partly from habit.
The ANZUS states have a legal-political
culture, so there is a respect for the maj-
esty of agreements enshrined in the law.
Also, Australia’s sense of isolation has
traditionally led to a desire for close ties
to “great and powerful friends.”
However, so notwithstanding recent
events in Wellington and concern in
Canberra but not in Washington it
is possible to think of life, as we know it,
without ANZUS.
The principal advantage to any dim-
inution of ANZUS would be that it
might well force defence managers to
focus on realities such as enlightened
self-interest rather than illusory obliga-
tions. The treaty does not oblige anyone
to do anything - except to consult. A
clear appreciation of the limits of
ANZUS would help to put our substan-
tial defence links with the US on a
clearer and healthier footing. It would
also make it easier to see that whatever
the strains between the current New
Zealand government and its current
counterpart in the US, these strains do
not encroach on Australia’s very sub-
stantial security links with the US. This
is turn might make clear that there is
little advantage or decency in abet-
ting Shultz’s more heavy-handed efforts
at alliance management. □

Banking’s elephant gets
ready to charge
The Commonwealth’s Vernon Christie: “supremely confident” of winning a top rating
Heartened by deregulation and a corporate restructuring, the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia is getting ready to attack the marketplace with new vigor.
MICHAEL MEAGHER outlines the bank’s changes and plans.
THERE IS an air of excitement at the
Commonwealth Bank’s Pitt Street offices
in Sydney. This week, one of the final
steps in the deregulation of the banking
system sees the dropping of the restric-
tion preventing trading banks from bor-
rowing for periods shorter than 14 days.
It means the major trading banks can
pay interest on deposits at call. The
Commonwealth already has put press-
ure on its competitors by announcing
that it will pay interest on new cheque
accounts, with 7 percent on offer for
balances of more than $5OOO.
What is buoying the Commonwealth
more is that in the next few weeks it will
know the outcome of a meeting last
week with representatives of the US
credit rating agency Moody’s Investor
Services Inc. Moody’s and the Standard
and Poors Corporation (S and P) are re-
garded as the world’s premier financial
ratings organisations. The Common-
wealth is seeking a long-term debt
rating and is shooting for the agencies’
top opinion, the Triple A rating. The
bank’s managing director, Vernon
Christie, told The Bulletin he was “su-
premely confident” of being awarded
Moody’s top Aaa and S and P’s AAA
ratings. Christie and other executives
will have a final interview with S and P
examiners next month.
The Aaa and AAA ratings are
awarded to fewer than 10 banks world-
wide. They include the Swiss Bank Cor-
poration, the American J. P. Morgan
Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan and
the Dutch Rabo Bank Nederland. The
US Texas Commerce Bank was on the
list but, like other American banks, had
its rating downgraded following the re-
cent turmoil caused by the problems of
the Continental Illinois National.
The uncertainty in world banking
circles generally has made the top credit
ratings highly desirable. A Triple A
rating would help the Commonwealth
to tap the US domestic market for long-
term securities and to gain support fa-
cilities for loan raising in the US. It also
would enable the bank to borrow more
cheaply on the US and European mar-
kets.
Christie says the rating which caps
the bank’s recent restructuring and gives
a significant boost to its international
operations “will enable us to borrow
in the Eurocurrency bond market at the
finest possible margins and that is very
important.”
While a top long-term rating is
valued more in the US domestic market
than in Europe, it is valuable in selling
in the European secondary bond mar-
ket. Without such a rating, a smaller
Swiss bank may not be happy to trust an
Australian bank. The ability to obtain
cheaper rates overseas also would mean
that the Commonwealth could lend to
Australian corporate clients at a lower
rate.
Christie said: “More and more Aus-
tralian companies are looking to bor-
row their commitments offshore, to
hedge exchange risks and to get a lower
interest rate than might be available in
the Australian market. They may not be
well enough known or don’t have the
financial strength to go out and raise
$5O million on the Eurocurrency mar-

Chief general manager Bill Clark: the bank

ket. We can go in and on-lend the
money to them and get the facility for
them at a cheaper rate than they would
be able to get locally.”
The Triple A quest is part of the new
image of the Commonwealth. It prefers
to be seen as a charging rather than a
ponderous and safe elephant. Christie is
proud of its being the first to announce
interest-bearing cheque accounts.
“We were the first. We see it as vital
to be progressive, not only in the busi-
ness sense. It’s also important that the
staff feel you are supporting them; that
they see you as up-front, up-market and
doing something positive.”
Christie is holding staff functions na-
tionally, inviting branch managers and
“administrative classified officers” to
hear “what the restructuring of the bank
means to them.” Last week 1300 em-
ployees went to Sydney’s Entertainment
Centre for a buffet meal and a speech
from their managing director. Christie
quipped: “The only entertainment was
my speech and, following Boy George,
they didn’t think that was a big deal.”
Christie is quick to defend the bank
against any criticism that it lags behind
its competitors. He said: “I get sick of
telling the press that we will lend $1.5
billion for housing this year, well in
excess of competitors. The building
societies get three pages if they lend $5
million.
“We are orientated to product lines
now rather than divisions as previously.
We have established retail banking,
which takes in savings bank loans and
personal loans which used to be in the
trading bank. Retail banking means
your wide consumer base; Bankcard,
Mastercard, housing loans and personal
consumer finance.
“It makes it easier at the branch
level. When a customer walks in, he is
dealing with the Commonwealth Bank
rather than going over to the savings
bank counter here or the Development
Bank counter there or the trading bank
counter somewhere else.”
Managerial changes have brought
the bank in line with the other majors.
What has been created is a more mod-
ern, responsive organisation. Christie
and his deputy managing director,
Bruce Aspery, head the staff of the new-
ly-named Commonwealth Bank of Aus-
tralia, the old Commonwealth Trading
Bank which now incorporates the Com-
monwealth Savings Bank as a wholly-
owned subsidiary. Christie and Aspery
are the only statutory appointees with
salaries determined by government.
Under them are the chief general
managers. Bill Clark, previously general
manager of the trading bank, heads the
corporate and international division;
Peter Wilson, the former savings bank
general manager, looks after retail and
John Fletcher retains control of the
autonomous Commonwealth Develop-
ment Bank. Fred Hulme basically the
figures man who determines the pricing
of new products was deputy mana-
ging director of the trading bank and is
the new general manager, group
treasury, and Alex Nimmo is general
manager personnel.
The bank will marshal its top execu-
tives into one head office in Sydney.
They are scattered through the city in
more than 10 buildings. Head office will
move from the existing corner location
in Pitt Street to premises at 48 Martin
Place which the bank had leased to the
Australian Taxation Office.
Built in 1928, No 48 is clad exter-
nally with deep red granite and pink,
glazed ceramic blocks. About $5O mil-
lion will be spent over two or three
years in renovating the National Trust-
rated building.
Perhaps one ingredient is missing
from the Commonwealth’s claim of pro-
viding a one-stop financial service. Un-
like Westpac, the National Australia
Bank and the ANZ, it has not yet an-
nounced a link with a stockbroker.
Christie said: “We are looking at the
situation very carefully. We have some
reservations about whether it is going to
be a significant money-spinner. We
have had plenty of offers but we will not
rush into it.”
He says that the prospect of provi-
ding general insurance is “further down
the line.” The bank has housing in-
surance available.
As to investment advice, Christie
says the bank is offering it already
through the merchant bank Australian
European Finance Corporation Ltd. The
bank recently increased its shareholding
in the AEFC to 51 percent to take a
more aggressive stance in the corporate
arena. It is also setting up a capital mar-
ket services group within the Common-
wealth Bank of Australia structure.
The new service would seem to clash
with the objects of the AEFC but, ac-
cording to Christie, “We have always
been competitive with the AEFC. They
are very strong in the short-term money
market and will continue to be.”
Christie says the ability of the
trading banks to enter the short-term
money area from August 1 “will make
competition that much harder; mer-
chant banks will squeeze their margins a
bit. They will have to offer that much
more interest on their facilities to com-
pete with the trading banks. But there is
no suggestion that they won’t continue
to be competitive. Experience around


the world has shown that the entry of
new banks broadens the market and
creates business for everybody.
“I have seen transactions through
merchant banks for the past 10 years
which I could never credit. I could only
wonder why the large corporations
involved would want to go to a mer-
chant bank when the cost of funds was
higher than they could get through their
own banks. That has always been the
case and I don’t think it will change.”
He suggests that the merchant banks
who continue to be successful will do so
through concentrating on personal ser-
vice and expertise.
He believes there may be a rational-
isation of the merchant banks which are
not bank-owned or in which banks do
not have a major shareholding.
A major criticism levelled at the
Commonwealth is its inability in a com-
petitive marketplace to hold staff. The
most glaring recent example was the de-
parture of the chief general manager of
the bank’s portfolio management ser-
vices, Warren McCullagh, and three
more junior security analysts for the
Sydney stockbrokers Lamploughs.
Christie said: “It’s not upsetting. It’s
a bit uncomfortable at times. The fact
that McCullagh went you can bear and
wear and perhaps even expect because
he had the reputation and we certainly
weren’t paying him anything like the
money he could get outside. He had left
us once before and come back.
“But when you lose three other
people whom you have trained for
seven or eight or 10 years, you are going
to be disappointed.”
On staff losses generally he claims:
“It happens and always will happen
when there is a need in the marketplace
for specialists such as dealers at the
moment. We suffered the same problem
in the 1960 s when we led the banking
world in computerisation. Suddenly all
the programmers we had trained were
being taken from us. We were able to
survive because we had the training pro-
grams in place.”
Christie suffers from a severely re-
stricted salary himself. The three heads
of the competing major banks enjoy sal-
ary packages of around $150,000 but
Christie must be content with something
less than $lOO,OOO as dictated by the
government remuneration tribunal.
But the bank is revising attitudes to
salary packages. It has just spent around
$1 million on one of the most modern
foreign exchange (FOREX) dealing
rooms in Australia. Because of the
skyrocketing increase in FOREX dealer
salaries, the bank has for the first time
decided to employ outside consultants
Cullen Egan Dell Australia to come
up with suggested salaries for various
positions. The manager of the FOREX
division, Art Brown, knows that his sal-
ary is well below the $BO,OOO to $120,000
many of his peers receive.
But Brown is loyal to the bank. The
challenge of launching the facility and
managing the 35 dealers and trainees
under him as well as being able to
ride on the strength the bank’s name en-
joys in the marketplace keeps him
there. Brown said: “We are keeping a
number of people (dealers) who stay on
because they know, with the Common-
wealth, they are dealing from strength;
they don’t get knocked back in the mar-
ketplace.
“Two years ago, the rules in dealing
in the international markets were
dictated by the letters RPN the
highest Rate, followed by the Period of
the facility and then the Name of the
institution. Now, with the problems of
the Bank of Illinois and other US banks,
the priorities of the lender are NPR
Name, Period and Rate.”
Training has been the Common-
wealth’s answer to its brain drain. Clark
says the bank each year sends about
10,000 members of its 34,000 staff to
teller schools, colleges, technical col-
leges, universities and various seminars
Foreign exchange manager Art Brown: loyal despite a salary below his peers
WARWICK KENT
for higher level management. The bank
owns a mini-university at St Ives, Syd-
ney, where employees can live in.
On the promise of the long-term
Triple A rating, Clark says that where
the bank had prudential restraints that
kept it to $lOO million in international
markets the exposure could be double
that amount. He points out that the
Commonwealth already has a healthy
presence overseas. It has offices in Lon-
don, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong,
New York and Los Angeles and plans
more.
At the end of June, the Common-
wealth rated as the 98th largest issuer of
short-term commercial paper in the US
domestic market with outstandings of
$3BO million. There were around 1000
issuers in the market. The Common-
wealth also has been involved in large
syndicated loans in the US, the most re-
cent being a part in the facility arranged
for News Corporation’s bid for the paper
products group St Regis.
What has made the Commonwealth
so confident of obtaining a Triple A
rating is its bolstered capital structure
and beefed-up government guarantee.
Through revaluation of the trading
and savings bank properties, capital
and reserves of the new Commonwealth
Bank of Australia have been boosted by
more than $5OO million.
Other strengthening measures have
included a $l5 million capital injection
into the Commonwealth by the govern-
ment and a transfer of $75 million from
the reserves of the Commonwealth De-
velopment Bank.
The full effect of these actions has
been to improve gearing ratios dramati-
cally. At June 30 last year, the ratio of
the trading bank’s total assets of $13.5
billion to capital and reserves of $215
million was 63 to 1. The private banks
have ratios of 20 to 1 and less. With
restructuring, the Commonwealth
emerges with assets of around $14.9 bil-
lion and capital and reserves of around
$B5O million for a gearing ratio of 17.5.
The other international plus for the
Commonwealth is the government guar-
antee which, according to Christie, tra-
ditionally has been seen overseas more
as “a letter of comfort than a guaran-
tee.” The Commonwealth Banks Act
1959 did not give a creditor the power to
sue the government but the amended
Act this year reads: “The Common-
wealth (of Australia) guarantees the due
payment by a body ... of all monies
that are, or at any time become, payable
by the body to a person other than the
Commonwealth.”
The bank’s eligibility for a high
credit rating is assisted by the fact that,
like the other major Australian banks,
it has a relatively small exposure
about $2O million to debt-stricken
countries, mostly in Mexico. □


WILDCAT
A smooth entrance through the back door
BUYERS of television stations over the
past year or so have paid spectacular
prices of up to 25 times current year
earnings for the shares.
So the backdoor listing of West Aus-
tralian provincial TV group Mid-West-
ern Television Pty Ltd on a projected
P/E multiple of 8 has presented the
sponsoring brokers McNall and
Hordern with few problems.
Former Sydney television actor Mike
Dorsey and his associates got control of
Mid-Western Television after it had
clocked up $600,000 in accumulated
losses, having started with a TV trans-
mitter and studio at Kalgoorlie. The in-
itial base was too small to be viable. It
has since relocated its main base to
Perth where it takes relays from both
TVW7 and STW9 for transmission
through a network of 11 translator
stations extending from Esperance on
the Great Australian Bight through
Norseman, Kalgoorlie and west
through the central wheatbelt towns to
Perth. With an audience now boosted to
100,000, and revenues up from $BOO,OOO
in 1982-83 to $1.3 million in the latest
June 30 year, it is now trading in the
black. Revenue is projected at $2 mil-
lion for the current year and a trading
profit of $546,000.
Mid-West Television will join the
lists through being acquired by Fowler
Constructions Ltd, which itself has been
reconstructed to have an issued capital
of 2 million $1 shares. McNall and
Hordern closed an underwritten issue
last week of 847,500 shares at $2 to fund
Fowler’s purchase.
Subscribers who took up the shares
are in on a prospective P/E multiple of
around 8 times current year prospective
earnings.
Price earnings multiples ruling on
listed provincial television stations last
week were:

Darling Downs TV 18.9

Pensioner plea
WHEN THE government announces
tax changes in the budget Wildcat hopes
that some relief will be given to the least
affluent members of the community
the card-carrying pensioner.
“If you ask me, they were taxed out of existence!”
Accountants Price Waterhouse point
out that the present tax structure is
framed so that a married couple on the
age pension, yet still eligible to carry a
card, will still have to lodge a tax return
and pay tax for the year ending June 30.
The card entitles the pensioner to health
benefits and travel and other con-
cessions.
As shown in the table, if a single pen-
sioner’s weekly gross income is less than
$57 or a married couple’s income is less
than $94 the pensioners qualify for the
card. But, inequitably says Price
Waterhouse, tax is still forthcoming.
Take the example of a couple who earn
$4650 annually from a lump sum de-
posited in a building society, which
gives them a combined income of
around $9O a week. The two are entitled
to $61.60 each weekly from the pension
or $123.20 combined, for a yearly pen-
sion income of $6406.40. Combined in-
come from pension and building society
interest comes to $11,056.40.
If the couple have been wise and
split interest between themselves they
each pay tax on $5528, $279.90 each,
which is reduced by the pensioner’s re-
bate of $237.62 to $42.28 each.
If the couple have been imprudent
and not split the building society inter-
est and left it all, say, in the husband’s
name, he will be taxed on the total inter-
est of $4650 plus his pension income of
$3203.20 - $7853.20.
Collecting tax from a cardholder
looks inept, considering the tax office’s
average cost of assessing a return is es-
timated at around $l5O.

THE CHARTIST
The big three stock markets wilt
by Russell Lander
IN 1983 stock markets around the
world rose strongly and equities were
once again the rage. The reasons, we
were told, were the US economic revival
and lower inflation rates in the pipeline
and the prospect of lower government
deficits which would allow interest rates
to fall. As we proceed into the second
half of 1984 there is a worldwide out-
break of bearish sentiment towards
equities and we are now being told by
fundamental analysts that the reasons
are that the US economic recovery is
too robust and that lower inflation rates
in the leading economies will require a
complete re-think about equity yields
which are patently too low.
The missing ingredients in 1984 are
markedly lower government deficits
both in the US (and here for that matter)
and lower interest rates.
Equity investors are now
having to contend with the
dangerous mix of potentially
high interest rates and low in-
flation rates, a combination
not seen in recent years. The
beauty of charts is that one is
spared the agony of attempt-
ing to answer the sort of ques-
tions which so obviously
baffle economists, such as
“What causes inflation?” or
“Why has inflation mysteri-
ously passed away?”
What, then, are the charts
on the Big Three stock mar-
kets saying at present? In a
word, trouble. Each of the
three adjacent charts going back to
January 1982 has been constructed on
the point and figure principle which
simply records the flow of data rather
than the range of trades on a given day
or a given week as in a bar chart.
The key Dow Jones Industrial Av-
erage which is based on the prices of 30
leading US stocks broke down in
January and has since made two fairly
tame attempts to rally. However, the
1100 level was pierced again on July 23
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
appears to be headed back to the low
1000 s.
A primary bear market is now in
place, its predecessor having reigned su-
preme from the middle of 1981 to the
third quarter of 1982.
The London FT Actuaries 500 has
only recently broken its uptrend which
had been in place for some 4/ 2 years. A
head and shoulders top has now been
confirmed which suggests that a further
substantial fall is on the cards in the
London stockmarket. It would not sur-
prise to see the 450 mark tested shortly,
The Tokyo New Index has likewise re-
cently confirmed a majestic head and
shoulders top which gives a downside
count to around 650. This compares
with a peak of about 875 earlier this
year.
Given that we live in a global stock
market village, then, the outlook for our
own equity market is clouded by the
bearish trends evident in the key share
indexes of the major stock markets. It is
always possible that our market could
shine on its own, albeit unlikely. □

Keen eye could prove profitable
WHEN geologist Chuck McCormick
floated his company Electrum NL last
November, the shares issued at 40c rose
strongly to peak at 52c but have since
fallen right away to a recent low of 16.
At that price they should have little
downside risk particularly since the
company completed moves last week
which should make it a profitable gold
producer early next year.
McCormick was the young field ge-
ologist in charge of proving up Pan-
continental Mining’s Paddington gold
deposit at Broad Arrow, 35km north of
Kalgoorlie. He recognised similar gold-
bearing potential north of Paddington
and when Pancontinental decided not
to seek more ground, he went ahead and
pegged north himself.
Early last year, he held tenements
running 7.5 km north along the strike
length of the same geological feature as
the Paddington finds. He farmed out 70
percent of the area in equal parts to
Samantha Exploration and Samson Ex-
ploration. Of 10 separate mineralised
stockworks discovered in the area with
widths up to 50m and strike lengths up
to Ikm, the most prospective so far is
the Victory zone where inferred reserves
so far stand at 500,000 tonnes of
3gm/tonne material amenable to open
pit extraction.
With drilling confined in the past six
months to proving up the Victory and
the fact that the whole Broad Arrow
North project had become a large-scale,
long-term undertaking, the market in-
terest in Electrum waned.
But last week it announced it had
acquired a managing 55 percent interest
in the Brilliant gold mining lease, mill-
ing and treatment plant 3km south-east
of Coolgardie. The other partner in the
Brilliant block is Tryaction Gold Mining
Pty Ltd, controlled by Kalgoorlie pros-
pector and miner Bill Trythrall.
The acquisition is a significant ad-
dition to what Electrum already held. It
now totals 310 ha. More importantly, it
will transform Electrum into a gold pro-
ducer. Proven open pit reserves, using a
cut-off grade of I.sgm/tonne, amount to
140,000 tonnes grading 3.34gm/tonne.
Using a cut-off of o.sgm/tonne, proven
reserves are 320,000 tonnes grading
2.3gm/tonne.
A $335,000 program is planned to
upgrade the Brilliant plant to a
throughput of 70,000 tonnes of ore a
year with a new carbon-in-pulp treat-
ment plant.
On a gold price of SA4OO/oz and in-
itial recoveries of only 70 percent, Elec-
trum estimates it would recover all costs
of up-grading the plant and operating
costs by early in mid-1985.
The joint venture expects to earn a
minimum operating profit of $1 million
after the first 16 months of operation.
Electrum has on issue 4.32 million
listed shares and 7.175 million vendor
shares. At 16c, its market capitalisation
is only $1.84 million yet it still has
liquid funds of around $750,000 and the
promise of generating profits. A drilling
program on Cord Holdings’ leases starts
this week and any results will rub off on
the neighbors.

The snow was painful to look at even
through our tinted glasses.
Ahead and behind, the slalom of marker
poles indicated the unsealed road which Range
Rover’s unique self-levelling suspension
effectively made as smooth as the fresh snow that
covered it.
Though we’d set out for the snow before
dawn, it certainly didn’t feel as though we’d been
driving for six hours.

Even our departure had been smoother than
usual.
It seemed that we had more equipment than
they’d taken to the moon.
But the luggage space swallowed it all,
including the stocks, with room to spare.
“To all intents and
purposes, we could have
been on the moon.”
The expressway to Mittagong was as quiet as
our navigator, asleep on the back seat.
And the powerful 3.5 litre engine let us make
the most of it without disturbing him or the
slower traffic we were passing.
Goulburn loomed out of the fog, with the
promise of steaming mugs of coffee.
Then we were into and out of Canberra faster
than a mid-term elected member, and ready to do
battle with the endless queues of tourist buses.

sight of snow, and we were looking forward to
coming to grips with it.
Grips being the operative word.
The transition from sealed road to hard-
packed snow was imperceptible.
Due in no small part to the Range Rover’s
all purpose radial tyres which virtually ate up the
mud and snow.
We did stop once, but that was only to extract
one enthusiast who had fitted chains to the rear
wheels of his front-wheel drive car.
Our diff-lock was engaged even before we’d
stopped rolling, so the extraction was completely
painless.
By the time we hit Smiggins, we realised that
this time we were in luck with the snow.
But Guthega with its uncrowded slopes was
our destination. And the day wasn’t getting any
younger.
Having opted for the shorter link-road
(something that pre-Range Rover we’d never
even considered) we turned up the cabin heat and
set off up the mountain.
Then, as we crested the rise, the light started
playing its tricks and die world, as we’d gotten
used to it, ceased to exist.

THE MODEST FARMER
Egging on the substitutes
by Bert Kelly
LAST WEEK we discussed why it was
thought to be necessary to regulate the
egg industry; this week we will examine
the fruits of that regulation.
One result is that it has made eggs
dearer except in NSW, where prices
have been coming down recently. A
year ago the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics said: “It is estimated that
egg prices at retail level may have been
about 40 cents a dozen lower under an
unregulated market arrangement. In
particular, these higher prices are, in
part, reflected in the value of hen quotas
which, in 1982-83, traded at around $l5-
$2O a hen.”
So that is one result of regulation.
The bureau estimates that the artificially
high price of eggs is costing consumers
about $7O million a year. Of course, no
one worries about that, consumers be-
ing regarded as fair game in Australia.
But it worries exporters such as Fred
and me because Eccles has taught us
that a consumer subsidy works in the
same way as a tariff subsidy; both get
built into the cost of living, then into
wages and then are passed back along
the line until they come to rest on the
bent backs of exporters who are at the
end of the line. So Fred and I worry
about consumer subsidies, as we do
about tariff subsidies.
One result of keeping the price of
eggs high is that this encourages substi-
tutes. If the dairy farmers get their way
and succeed in keeping the price of milk
products high, they will hold the gate
open for artificial products such as
soymilk to come in. They did this with
butter prices years ago, giving margar-
ine an arm-chair ride.
It is true that artificial eggs do not
appear to be just around the corner,
though it is hard to be sure about this
with such queer goings-on with human
eggs. But substitutes for eggs can come
in other forms. I used to eat two eggs for
breakfast every morning but Mavis
weaned me on to bran, the same stuff as
horses eat. I resented this at first but
now I am addicted to it. Indeed, the
other morning I caught myself giving a
little whinny when I heard Mavis clat-
tering the breakfast dishes. The chook
people will keep the door open for sub-
stitutes if they keep the price of eggs
artificially high.
It cannot be claimed that we regulate
the egg industry to take care of the poor
little poverty-stricken fowl farmer be-
cause most of the subsidy money goes to
the people who need it least.
I quote again from the bureau re-
port: “It is estimated that, in 1981-82, 90
farms with over 20,000 birds, account-
ing for about 4 percent of the number of
commercial units but 37 percent of pro-
duction, received 37 percent of the in-
come transfer, which is equivalent to
nearly $300,000 per farm. By contrast,
about 1200 farms or about half the total,
received about 3 percent of the con-
sumer transfer, or about $1640 per
farm.” You can understand the big egg
producers’ fanatical attachment to or-
derly marketing if it is as profitable as
that.
Another result of regulation is that it
encourages each state to have its own
egg marketing system. Stern steps are
taken by states to prevent eggs coming
in from other states, even if eggs there
are cheaper. I can never understand
how this is legal when Section 92 of the
Constitution insists that trade between
states must be absolutely free.
States once used health regulations
to keep out interstate eggs. This perhaps
could be justified when transport was
slow but now, with fast and refrigerated
road transport, it is foolish to pretend
that these health regulations are neces-
sary. We transport meat across Austra-
lia in refrigerated trucks. Recently I saw
in Queensland beef being loaded for
Perth. What is wrong with doing this
with eggs?
Some people appear indifferent to
the Constitution being breached in this
way but I think it is a serious matter.
Before federation, there used to be Cus-
toms posts at all state borders. It was
one of the great achievements of the
founding fathers to get rid of these. But
if we stop eggs and milk being produced
where this can be done most cheaply
just to satisfy state loyalties or preju-
dices, why not do the same with cars,
textiles or footwear? And what kind of a
nation do you think would result?
Fred has been having a pretty rough
time on his farm lately and he is think-
ing of buying a large refrigerated truck
for his boy Bill so that he can carry
packaged milk from northern Victoria
to Sydney and then back-load with eggs
to Melbourne. He thinks that this will be
better than farming.
This is the kind of opening that gov-
ernments create when they muck
around with markets.
However, once you get on the back
of a hen quota tiger or any other kind
of quota tiger it is hard to get off with-
out being eaten. □

A textbook case for judgment
COUNSEL last week completed their
submissions to the Darwin Supreme
Court inquiry into the liquidation of
Day and Dent Constructions. The in-
quiry, conducted under Section 278 of
the Companies Act by the Chief Justice
of the Northern Territory, Sir William
Forster, is only the second of its kind in
Australia and is destined to become a
star feature of textbooks of the future on
law and accountancy.
Sir William’s inquiry it would have
been under Section 420 in the rest of
Australia has been into the conduct of
the liquidation. His judgment, to be
produced in a month or so, will be the
hottest news in the Territory that day
unless Cyclone Tracy re-appears.
As Sir William certainly would not
be influenced by anything your corre-
spondent might write, Pierpont pro-
poses to summarise the case. He warns
all readers to break out a crate of
Bollinger before proceeding further, as
the subject is complex and requires
great quantities of brain food.
To any businessman with a healthy
distrust of lawyers and accountants, the
case reads like a horror story. What
started out as a small and slightly messy
liquidation turned into a legal monster
in which the costs have gone somewhere
over $1 million.
At the bottom of this legal heap is a
chap called Ken Day, former president
of the right-wing Progress Party in the
Territory, and, with his wife, director of
companies called Day and Dent Con-
struction and North Australian Proper-
ties (NAP).
Late in 1976, NAP bought a block of
land zoned industrial at a spot
called 11-Mile, on the outskirts of Dar-
win. To discharge d mortgage, $lOO,OOO
was borrowed from Esanda. The loan
was made to both Day and Dent and
NAP. Thus Day and Dent had a
$lOO,OOO debt which might more ac-
curately have been called a contingent
liability but no corresponding asset.
Repayment of the loan was, however,
guaranteed by NAP. The cheque for
$lOO,OOO was paid directly to the pre-
vious mortgagors.
The structure of this deal has been
disputed. The foregoing is basically
what Mr Justice Gallop found to be the
case in a judgment handed down in the
NT Supreme Court on March 19, 1980.
As long as both family companies
stayed operational and under the same
control, everything would have been
fine. But they didn’t.
Day and Dent appears
to have become insolvent
in late 1977, in that it had
assets and work in progress
but could not pay its debts
to various creditors. In
January 1978, Ken went to
Richard Barber of Price
Waterhouse & Co to dis-
cuss a scheme of arrange-
ment for Day and Dent.
Instead, according to
Ken, Barber proposed that
a provisional liquidator be
appointed on the petition
of a creditor. This was
done, the creditor being a
company called ABM
which was owed nearly
$lO,OOO, and a provisional
liquidator was appointed
by the Supreme Court on
February 23, 1978.
Barber himself could
not be appointed because
he was not a registered liquidator in the
NT. Indeed, there were very few regis-
tered liquidators in the NT at the time
and Pierpont would guess that not all of
them were available for the job anyway.
The court appointed Laurence
Cheong Ah Toy who had close links
with Price Waterhouse. So close, in fact,
that on the same day February 23
he appointed Price Waterhouse as his
agents “for the purposes of such pro-
visional liquidation and for all matters
incidental thereto.”
Let’s stop the story here for a second
and look over Sir William’s shoulder ...
Although occasionally inspired by
the grape of the Marne, Pierpont is by
no means clairvoyant so he is unable to
say what issues Sir William will address
in his judgment but your correspondent
will be interested to see if he has any-
thing to say on the following:
■ Can a provisional liquidator, ap-
pointed by the court, legally appoint
someone else as his agent? When a chap
from one of the big firms such as
Hungerfords or Peat Marwick is ap-
pointed liquidator of a company, he
normally has a small army of clerks and
underlings scurrying about looking
after the ledgers but this is different
from appointing them his agents. If
there is a precedent, Sir William will
doubtless find it.
■ Ah Toy, having appointed Price
Waterhouse as agent on the same day he
was appointed, appears to have taken
little further active part in the liquida-
Ken Day
tion. He went overseas
from mid-March to mid-
April. When first ap-
proached by Barber to be
liquidator, Ah Toy said
that he would have to take
the trip and would be un-
available at this time.
When the deputy registrar
of companies wrote to Ah
Toy querying the appoint-
ment of Price Waterhouse,
Ah Toy replied that they
had been appointed as his
agents “in respect of cer-
tain matters in connection
with the liquidation.”
At the inquiry, the fol-
lowing exchange occurred
with Mr Fred Davey for
the registrar of companies:
Davey: “. .. if you’re
going to be frank and
forthright, you would have
said ‘I have delegated to
Price Waterhouse all matters in connec-
tion with the liquidation,’ wouldn’t
you?”
Ah Toy: “Yes, I would have.”
Ah Toy further said that, while he
was provisional liquidator, he had not
examined the accounts of Day and
Dent.
On March 7 this year, Ah Toy stood
down as an official liquidator and asked
for his name to be removed from the list
of official liquidators in the Northern
Territory.
■ What happened to the scheme of
arrangement? Provisional liquidation is
normally a stepping-stone either to
liquidation or a scheme of arrangement,
under which creditors are asked to agree
to hold off for a while and give the com-
pany a chance to work off all or part of
its debts.
One of Day’s ideas was a scheme of
arrangement under which all creditors
would receive 100 cents in the dollar.
This might have been optimistic but, on
Pierpont’s reading of the evidence, they
appear to have had a sporting chance of
getting 50 cents under another one.
Day’s business primarily consisted of
smallish contracting jobs on mission
stations. It is not the sort of business
that could easily be managed by an ac-
countant sitting in Darwin or even by
another manager. Day’s suggestions
that he continue in a management role
under a scheme of arrangement appear
to have caused some friction with Price
Waterhouse but, if the jobs could not be


completed and fresh ones undertaken,
the creditors’ chances would dwindle.
The directors’ statement of affairs on
February 23, 1978, showed that Day and
Dent had assets with an estimated re-
alisable value of $274,000 and an es-
timated deficiency of $96,000.
Among the assets was a book entry
showing SIOO,OOO (which Day and Dent
had never received) owing from NAP.
Price Waterhouse demanded repayment
from NAP and when it did not repay
(the money was tied up in the 11-Mile
property) petitioned the court for a pro-
visional liquidator to be appointed to
NAP. That liquidator sold the property
and repaid Esanda but Price
Waterhouse kept pursuing NAP for the
alleged debt of SIOO,OOO. This pursuit
took up many court proceedings and
many, many thousands of dollars.
All parties involved, including the
registrar, have now spent somewhere
over $1 million on a liquidation where
the total assets were $274,000 at best (if
you take out the illusory SIOO,OOO, they
were $174,000). And the whole mazurka
has taken more than seven years.
Ignorant old grampus that he is,
Pierpont would have thought that a
liquidation involving a couple of hun-
dred thousand dollars, a property, some
construction work in the bush and
where the proprietor was willing to give
extensive personal guarantees (and
could, thus, have his personal estate se-
questered if he did not perform) was
something that could have been
wrapped up inside a year even allow-
ing for long lunches.
And, if a small liquidation should
develop into a nightmare such as this
one and Pierpont were a major account-
ancy partnership, his instinct would
have been to reach for the chequebook
and send off settlement cheques in full
to all parties involved and then try to
pretend that the whole sordid affair had

CHESS
Wild West tactics
by Terrey Shaw
DO YOU ever feel that your chess
games are getting stale? That they’re not
as exciting as they used to be?
If so, a good antidote is to adopt the
following policy: wait to see on which
side of the board your opponent castles,
then promptly castle on the other wing.
Opposite-side castling is perhaps the
last frontier for the daredevil player in-
tent on attack at all costs.
Such positions are usually a prelude
to a Wild West display of tactics where
the only law is to attack the King. The
tactician holds undisputed sway and all
positional players are milksops.
Normally, caution can be thrown to
the winds. The routine constraints about
not making weakening pawn moves and
taking care to control the centre usually
do not apply.
This is especially gratifying to those
players such as myself who often feel
that we’re not sure where the centre is,
let alone how we’re actually supposed to
control the wretched thing.
The normal attacking strategy in
such positions is to throw up the pawns
facing the enemy King as fast as pos-
sible. This is so you can open lines along
which your pieces can penetrate.
In defence (it is an unfortunate fact
of life that now and again one must fall
back on such moves), the important
thing to remember is to keep the pawns
in front of your King unmoved on the
second rank as long as possible. This
makes it harder for the enemy pawns to
find a line-opening target when they ad-
vance.
The following game, from the popu-
lar Queen’s Birthday weekend tourna-
ment in Albury, NSW, is a good practi-
cal example of these ideas put into ac-
tion.
Black’s game hangs by a thread, as
White is first to open a line, but he de-
cides the issue neatly with a series of
nicely-timed regicidal body blows.

A typical example of opposite-side

each side to attack the enemy King’s
position energetically.

In the nick of time, Black finds a way

pedestrian line-opening manoeuvre of
P-QRS followed by P-QN6.

recently by running around

In its enthusiasm, it has
suppressed some people who

was in the first place.
One Melbourne motoring

couple of weeks ago to receive
a phone call from the firm’s
lawyer demanding that he not
write an article containing the
secret and threatening him
with condign punishment if
he did.
The innocent scribe hadn’t
written anything but he now
knows everything GM-H was
trying to keep secret.

Fisherman’s
crewing
problem
SEX discrimination laws can
take a lot of fun out of life, as
a fisherman who wanted to
hire a female deckhand dis-
covered.
The fisherman, from
Karumba, on the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, approached the
Commonwealth Employment
Service in his search for a
woman “deckie.” He was told
he wasn’t allowed to ask for a
woman: jobs were allocated
according to the order in
which applications were
received and the next person
on the list was a male.
Our fishing friend was
nothing if not direct.
“Look,” he told the CES
person. “I want to sleep with a
woman, not with a bloke.”
“You can’t say that,” the
CES person replied. “You’re
not allowed to discriminate
against the males.”
FOOTNOTE: Feminists
may think the fisherman got
his just deserts in the end. He
approached a private employ-
ment agency, one which has
supplied some attractive bar-
maids (bar persons?) for the
Karumba Lodge Hotel. The
agency found him a female
deckie. She was, said the fish-
erman, six feet tall and 16
stone.

Woody Allen’s words for birds
WOODY Allen, probably the
world’s highest-profile wimp,
has a great line when it comes
to chatting up the birds. A
London paper recently pub-
lished a compilation of his
chit-chat. Examples:
On marriage: I kept
putting my wife under a ped-
estal.
On getting a divorce: I
telephoned my wife’s best
friend and asked if she would
commit adultery with me. But
she said “no”, not even if it
helps the US space program.
On sex: It’s the most fun I
ever had without laughing.
On birth control: I want to
tell you about oral contracep-
tion I asked this girl to sleep
with me and she said, “No”.
What to say to a girl in a
cab: You’re so beautiful I can
hardly keep my eyes on the
meter.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
BLACK throws a 4-1. What’s the
play? There doesn’t seem to be a
barrel of options. Black can split
his back men, move from the mid
or 12 point or take his 4 point (B 8
to B 4 and B 5 to B 4).
Capturing the 4 point may ap-
pear the best. It certainly is a use-
ful point and, as Black’s distribu-
tion stands, capturing the 4 point
would make it all neat, tidy and
impressive. The trouble is White
has gone already; it is a case of
locking the stable door after the
horse has bolted.
What is White going to do
next? If he rolls a 2 he will save his
blot by moving 810 to 812. With
anything higher than 3 he will
move the blot around the corner
into his own home board. What-
ever happens, only a roll of
double 3 by White will force him
to leave the blot where it is.
The question is: what chance
does Black have of getting a hit on
his next roll?
The answer is, “Very little”.
And, if that is the case, what good
is the 4 point to Black?
Black’s position is not envi-
able. He is coming second. What
he has to do is upset the balance.
Now is the time to split his back
men, using the 4 to move W 1 to
W 5.
Now White has problems. He
must save the blot on 810 but
moving it around the corner isn’t
enough any more. Furthermore, if
he leaves the Black blot on W 5
Black could anchor it next roll.
Then White will be in the unenvi-
able position of bringing nine men
home past a 5 point anchor.
Moving to the 5 point now
opens up the game for Black.
I’m often asked: “When
should you split the back-men?”
There is no all-encompassing
answer but this is a text book case.

Opening lead king of hearts.
DECLARER’S initial approach to
the play has a great deal to do with
how he fares eventually. If he pro-
ceeds on the assumption that his
finesses will succeed or that the
various suits will be divided favor-
ably making no provision for
the possibility things may not
work as well as he’d like he is
sure to find himself in hot water
from time to time.
What declarer should attempt
to do is shape his play so that he
accomplishes his purpose not only
when matters progress satisfactor-
ily but also when they develop
unsatisfactorily.
This deal is typical of a situa-
tion that arises occasionally.
South can see when dummy comes
down that the contract is ice-cold
if the diamonds are divided 3-2.
All his early plays therefore
should be designed to cope with a
4-1 or 5-0 division.
He prepares thoroughly for
this possibility by ruffing the sec-
ond heart lead, drawing trumps
cashing the ace of diamonds and
leading the A-K and another club.
South no longer cares how the
diamonds are divided. By now
both dummy and declarer each
have three diamonds and one
trump and the defender who wins
the third round of clubs must re-
turn a diamond or yield a ruff-dis-
card.
In the actual case, West prob-
ably would win the third club. If
he returns the queen or jack of
diamonds, declarer ducks and
West is end-played. If he returns
the nine instead, declarer likewise
ducks to assure the contract.
If East has the diamond length
instead of West, he runs into the
same dead end. There is no pos-
sible escape.
