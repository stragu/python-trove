Consider this.
The BMW 520 i offers you a level of
design and refinement quite simply
unavailable in other cars in its class. Yet it
remains eminently competitive in the price
arena. So what may have seemed a mere
flight of fancy is, in reality, well within
your grasp.
SIX-CYLINDER REFINEMENT.
The level of sophistication starts with
the engine - one of the few six-cylinder,
two-litre engines in the world. The laws of
engineering dictate that if an in-line, two-
litre engine is to be totally free of
secondary vibrations, it should never have
fewer than six cylinders. Anything less is a
compromise.
In the BMW 520 i, you’ll find a turbine-
smooth, electronically fuel-injected, six-
cylinder engine which revs effortlessly, yet
is tractable and responsive in traffic.
And now that a revolutionary, four-
speed automatic transmission is available,
you can experience the economy and
performance normally associated with a
five-speed manual.
TECHNOLOGY CREATES EFFICIENCY.
Advanced electronics are an integral
part of the design of every BMW, and the
520 i is no exception.
Certainly the engine is a prime
beneficiary of this technology. Instead of
conventional servicing by the book, a
computer monitors driving conditions and
your driving style, and indicates the precise
moment an oil change or service is due.
This is allowing BMW drivers to
extend their service intervals by up to
sixty percent.
A computer-controlled fuel-
consumption meter monitors the precise
fuel flow, compares it to road speed, and
tells you exactly how much fuel you
are using.
And when you lift your foot off the

accelerator at over 1200 r/min, the fuel
cuts off completely.
These advances in technology not
only typify BMW’s quest for greater fuel
efficiency, but allow for the production of
2-litre engine that produces nearly as
much power (125bhp)’as some engines
twice its size.
CONSISTENCY OF QUALITY.
Every BMW is built to the same
exacting standards of quality - regardless
of price. Standards which you would not
have considered possible in a car priced
below $30,000.
This committment to quality allows
BMW to offer a 6 year warranty against rust
perforation on its current models.
It’s not surprising then, that such a
relentless pursuit of excellence in design
and manufacture should pay such
handsome dividends when you finally
come to sell your BMW.
If you’re driven by a similar desire
for quality and refinement, then you’ll
recognise the need to test drive the
BMW 520 i.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
‘Pampered’ Aborigines
The current debate on Land Rights and
Sacred Sites protection may have led
some people to believe Aborigines are a
pampered section of our community.
Unfortunately for Aboriginal
people, nothing could be further from
the truth. Here at Milingimbi, just off
the coast of Arnhemland, for instance,
we repeatedly have sewage forming
swamps all over town, including the
school playground. The response of the
Northern Territory government has
been a few half hearted band-aid sol-
utions which have failed. No permanent
solution seems to have been even con-
sidered, let alone implemented.
The problem is so bad that the school
has been closed for 11 days since the
June holidays and the possibility of
serious disease is growing more likely.
As the NT government looks like re-
maining inert on this issue, I suppose
the best we can hope for is a change in
the wind to take away the stench. If this
is the sort of pampering you would en-
joy, come and join us at Milingimbi.

Academic journos
Why should you be so surprised that
two journalists, Roger Covell (trained
in Brisbane) and Donald Horne, have
become professors at the University of
NSW? (People, B, October 16.)
I am sure others can and will.
While you are wondering where it
will all end, may I remind you that a
journalist has been Chancellor of
Griffith University for nine years.
On leaving the editor’s chair at The
Courier-Mail in 1970, I was appointed
to head the planning committee for a
second university in Brisbane. We
opened in 1975 and I am proud to have
been in office as Chairman Of Council
and Chancellor since then.
There is in Queensland no limit to
the possibilities of journalism.

Qld Medicare survey
During August and September, 1984,
the Metropolitan General Practitioners’
Group of the AMA, Queensland
Branch, commissioned a survey of the
billing practices of every identifiable
general practitioner in Brisbane.
Doctors were phoned during surgery
hours, and the doctor or his/her recep-
tionist was asked: “Does your practice
direct bill Medicare for all patients, do
you selectively direct bill Medicare only
pensioners and other disadvantaged
“Could you please take back all these books on Russia he’s falling

groups, or are none of your patients di-
rect billed?” The number of doctors in
each practice was also determined.
The result of the survey is shown in
the following table:
BILLING PROCEDURE Number of Percentage

groups 490 83.7%
Direct bill no patients 42 7.2%
Direct bill all patients 38 6.6%
Refused to co-operate
with survey 15 2.5%
TOTAL 585 100.0%
The survey noted many comments
made by doctors while conducting the
survey. These included one doctor who
had stopped direct billing and returned
to selective direct billing because he had
complaints from patients who were be-
ing harrassed by Department of Health
inspectors. Two doctors who did direct
bill all patients said they did so because
they had 85-90 percent pensioners in
their practices, and it was not worth-
while running accounts for the small re-
mainder.
The total number of services being
direct billed, which is a figure often
quoted by the federal Minister for
Health, Dr (non-medical) Blewett, bears
no relationship to the number of doc-
tors direct billing all patients. This is be-
cause pensioners and those on sickness
benefits are likely to make far greater
use of health services, and require more
pathology tests than the average patient.
The number of general practitioners
who direct bill Medicare for all patients
is far lower than the federal government
would have the general public believe,
but the majority of doctors are direct
billing those who can least afford to pay
any gap.

A welcome exposure
The Bulletin did well to publish the
article “Aussie racism a myth ex-
posed” (B, October 9). That hoary old
tale of how Australians see themselves is
best seen as an aberration belonging to
a minority.
The majority of Australians still go
their merry way thinking about the
house, the new car or who’s going to
win the grand final (Aussie rules if you
five south of the Murray and rugby if
you five north of it).
An important point made in the
article was that our Asian newcomers
are sometimes a source of irritation to at
least some Australians. All things con-
sidered, such is probably not qualita-
tively different from irritations provided
by the numerous European and Middle
Eastern settlers who have been coming
to our shores since the end of World
War 11.

Poetic ‘quickie’
Proudly, I call myself an everyday-

job. I receive good pay, have ideal
working conditions and a heap of.side
benefits. Someone once said Vny fife?
must be boring. He didn’t get away with
that typical statement. A 10-minute lec-
ture had him on the ropes wishing he’d
never entered the ring.
The ring on my finger is not attached
to a ball and chain. I’m my own boss,
I’m free. Free to read The Bulletin,
spend an hour on one clue of the cross-
word, walk for pleasure, serve an ace
now and then, watch the sparrows have
a sand bath in the garden and free to
love, feed and make happy my family.
Because of this peaceful sense of
achievement, this unfettered mind can
create poetry. I now boldly call my
writings, poetry, because The Bulletin,
in its wisdom printed my poem, Worry,
in its July 31 issue. And thank you to the
two correspondents who expressed their
favor of it.
Now, if I may, through your
generous magazine, I’d like to inform
any interested publishers of poetry that

I credit you with a skilful coupling of

If the Whig fits?
I refer to the article by Tim Duncan on
the ideas and influences of the so-called
“New Right,” an article which refers to
the Centre (not Institute) of Policy
Studies and myself as being part of this
alleged alliance. I would note first and
foremost that the Centre of Policy
Studies holds no views and includes
staff with a wide variety of opinions on
economic and political matters.
I would concede, however, that the
bulk of us do believe that market forces,
rather than centralised regulation, con-
stitutes the most efficient and fair means
of allocating resources. Regulation and
legislation by committees tend to benefit
those with power and privilege in our
society, and tariff and other protection
policies (including tenure in the public
service and universities) and non-mar-
ket arrangements typically favor the few
as against the many.
Those of us in favor of deregulation,
and of greater use of market forces, are
typically in favor of the small man, the
person without sizable economic power,
and thus could well be characterised as
on the left, or certainly as on the side of
small “1” liberalism. Of course such lib-
eralism has often been forgotten within
the Liberal Party, as it has sought to
protect one interest group after another,
depending on electoral circumstances.
If we must be labelled, might I sug-
gest possibilities such as “New Whigs,”
“liberal left,” “Smithians,” or, more
tediously, “economic rationalists.”

Backgammon blot!
“A working miner’s wife actually, sir.”
I thank Michael Lloyd for his insight
into the finer points of the age-old game
of creative backgammon. (B, October
16). Perhaps his next article should con-
centrate on the sleight of hand or
diversionary tactics necessary to carry
out these moves.
I refer, of course, to his advice to
move a blot from the 9-point to the 4-
point on a roll of 6, capture the point
and issue a strong warning to Black, all
in one flowing movement. Pure magic! I
suspect however, that any hitting done
after a move like that would be Black
hitting White with the board!
But perhaps a real expert could get
away with moving B-12 to W-4 and W-6
to W-4 on a 6-2 roll, claiming he’d mis-
read the 6 as a 9 because the dice were
upside down?
MARTIN H. ASHTON
Parramatta NSW
The Daintree and CSIRO
Being involved in rainforest research
conducted by CSIRO’s Atherton lab-
oratory since its establishment in 1971,1
take exception to some of the statements
made in discussion of rainforest re-
search and the Daintree controversy (B,
October 9).
Firstly it must be observed that
CSIRO has never been particularly
generous in allocating resources for
rainforest research. Funds have been
short for many years and the problems
associated with not being able to re-
place a technician who decides to leave,
have been with research staff since the
“good” times of the mid-19705. As a
consequence the Atherton laboratory
has always been arguably viable.
Efforts to counter this demoralising
situation by recruiting more staff or de-
veloping facilities which would enable a
reasonable number of visiting scientists
to be accommodated have been repeat-
edly frustrated.
The argument that supporting six
scientists at Atherton is so expensive
that it places an intolerable burden on
the remaining 72 scientists in the Div-
ision of Forest Research (based mainly
in Canberra) cannot be sustained.
Secondly, the division’s current re-
search policy discourages long-term
studies which, as the article notes, are an
essential part of learning how the
rainforest grows and, in particular, how
it is affected by disruption and the cre-
ation of gaps such as the Daintree road.
Instead researchers are now told to de-
vote increasing proportions of the re-
sources available to fundamental
studies such as the physiological charac-
teristics of some selected plant species.
While there may be some merit in
these new studies, technical and in-
terpretational problems abound and it
may be many years, even decades, be-
fore they yield sufficient data to signifi-
cantly influence rainforest management.
Finally, while I agree with the state-
ment that scientists cannot make defini-
tive statements on the rainforest and the
need to preserve it because they do not
have enough information, the present
expertise in rainforest botany, ecology
and soils within the division’s Atherton
group could well have contributed to a
more rational debate on the Daintree
issues.
However, this contribution could not
have reasonably been made without
some on-site investigations. Un-
fortunately such studies are difficult to
place within currently approved re-
search programs and even more difficult
to fund from existing resources.
Even then it must be recognised that
scientists cannot answer all the ques-
tions. Value judgments relating, for
example, to acceptable degrees of
change or recovery periods, will also
play an important, if not dominant, role
in these land use debates.
CSIRO’s Atherton laboratory has an
enormous potential to contribute to the
improved management of rainforest
lands throughout the tropics. Un-
fortunately the research envisaged does
not seem to fit all that comfortably with-
in the folds of CSIRO.
Hopefully, some additional or alter-
native sources of funding will be found
and research program management re-
organised so that the laboratory will re


gain some semblance of viability and
start to add significantly to our knowl-
edge of these fascinating and extremely
complex forests.

Chilling killing
As a doctor in full-time emergency
practise, I am amazed by the nonsense
written by Michael Hogan re death
from bow-hunting.
I have seen humans die from bullets,
knives and various other nasty things
and most die fairly unpleasantly.
To die of a collapsed lung with an
arrow is not like having the wind
knocked out of you. It is more like
having a plastic bag put over your face.
You die of suffocation, struggling panic-
stricken, and blue. I suggest Mr Hogan
tries it.
To suggest that an animal can have
an arrow shot through its chest, not
know it, and drop dead from loss of
blood is pathetic in its stupidity.
In the previous sentence we were
told the animal dies of a collapsed lung
and we are supposed to imagine the ani-
mal happily eating while suffocating. In
the event that the animal dies from
blood loss, not lung collapse, the blood
from an internal chest wound is still
likely to cause suffocation or direct
death with fainting, shock, gasping or
even fits.
Hogan then points out the animals
shot but not killed die of lead poison-
ing, while an animal shot with an arrow
recovers.
Obviously Mr Hogan has not heard
of infection or all the old diggers walk-
ing around with lead in them.
I am appalled at loss of life and
suffering, whether in animals or hu-
mans, and to think some people do
these things (sport killing) for pleasure
chills me with horror.
It surely is a sickness.

The Australian plight
I have read with some relief David
McNicoll’s article of October 9. I agree
wholeheartedly that “certain Aborigines
and their white manipulators are doing
their best to bring apartheid to Austra-
lia” my relief being that I thought no
one was willing to put a view similar to
mine into print.
I am sick to death of hearing of the
plight of the Aboriginal. I am fifth gen-
eration Australian.
I am considering investing in real es-
tate, so would either the federal govern-
ment or one of the state governments be
so kind as to transfer title of say a
few thousand acres to me? After all, I
am an Australian.

The footy malaise
“Colliwobbles” is a new word (Batman,
B, October 9) but it hasn’t made the dic-
tionaries yet.
Collywobbles (sic) is the word in the
dictionaries. It is not a new word. Poms
use it. It means the runs, dates from
1841 according to The Shorter Oxford,
links “colic” with “wobble” and is a
damned good word for it.
I would not, however, dispute
Batman’s use or spelling which seem
peculiarly apt when speaking of the
Collingwood football team whose prob-
lem seems to be getting the runs, as it
were, on the board.

Is your car in su
Most luxury cars have lines that are remi-
niscent of a box.
The Rover 3500 SE and Vanden Plas, on
the other hand, have lines that are reminiscent of
the Ferrari Daytona.
Most luxury cars have four doors and a boot
Whereas the Rover has four doors and a
hatchback.
A design that turns heads and turns the Rover
into a station wagon.
(Ml you do is fold down the rear seat)
Judging by its shape you might think the Rover
also has superb aerodynamics.
You’d be right. It also has the performance
to match.
Furthermore, to keep it in shape we put the
bodyshell through a highly advanced rust-protect-
ion process known as cathodic priming. Then we
underseal it
And then we paint it, giving it more coats than
you’d find in a film star’s wardrobe.

it prompted the motoring press to write that Rover
‘.. includes just about every automotive mod con
you can think of or dream about.’
The checklist (equally important to the health
and comfort of the Rover driver) is another long list
Every car must pass literally thousands of
mechanical and electronic checks before it’s allowed
out of the factory.
The result is Rovers spend the maximum time
on the road, and the minimum time off it
Which leads us to a claim that no one else can
make.

Instead of a one year warranty there is a two

Whats more ; Rover undertake to pay the labour

evidence who did not disclose his name
and wanted his claims to be judged by
his own supporters. Why, then, should
Mr Adams (B, September, 25) accept
the claims of an “electrician” allegedly
made at the post-World War II trials in
Germany to judges appointed by the
victors that people were gassed in gas
chambers. If the “electrician” exists and
gave evidence at the post-war trials, I
suggest he claim the $50,000 reward
offered by the Institute for Historical
Review to anyone who can prove the
existence of gas chambers.
I cannot locate any reference in the
published texts of the trials to the type
of evidence given by the “electrician”
who claims he was cross-examined for
weeks and I invite Mr Adams to specify
where and when the evidence was given
and to indicate where plans and specifi-
cations for gas chambers can be in-
spected.
Napoleon said that history is the lies
agreed upon by the victors. The post-
war trials in Germany were kangaroo
courts which have been widely con-
demned by jurists. Much of the evi-
dence given at the trials was false. For
instance evidence was given that there
were gas chambers at Ravensbruck,
Mauthausen and Struthof leading to
the execution of the camp comman-
dants. It is now conceded by Jewish
writers such as Gitta Sereny that there
were no gas chambers at those camps.
Sereny has also condeded that some
Jews and non-Jews are still inventing
stories about the camps (New States-
man, November 11, 1979).
I have never stated, as alleged by Mr
Adams, that the exaggerations about the
extent of the Holocaust are due to a
“Jewish conspiracy” nor have I stated
that the bodies of victims of typhus at
Belsen are “mythical.”
The reason that Mr Adams and
others devote so much space to the
Holocaust is that it is Israel’s number
one propaganda weapon. Why does he
ignore the devastation of German cities
leading to the deaths of over 600,000
civilians?
His statement that he finds the views
of revisionist historians about the Holo-
caust blasphemous is understandable
for Mr Adams, despite his claims to be-
ing a sceptic, is a deeply religious man.
His religion is the Holocaust.

Experts say there is

it before you. At Camus,
four generations of our
family have been doing
this for over a century.

One of our most

of the cognac region to create a finished product
with the desired characteristics.
The art of tasting is of utmost importance and

snifter to eliminate the influence of colour on our
perception of taste, thereby allowing us to focus
on the bouquet, smoothness, delicacy and

The responsibility
B. Morris, in his letter (B, October 16)
commenting on the deaths through star-
vation and typhus in Belsen concentra-
tion camp, states that the nazi bureauc-
racy cannot be held solely responsible
for this tragedy. Then, who else can
have shared the responsibility?
There was neither starvation nor ty


phus in the environs outside the camp
perimeter, as I know from personal ex-
perience at Belsen two days following
the camp’s liberation.
To say further that starvation and ty-
phus are still with us is surely irrelevant
to this particular incident.

ANZUS friendship
New Zealand, Australia and the United
States, as co-dwellers in the Pacific
share a friendship based on a common
geography, language and recent mili-
tary history. This friendship was
formalised in 1951 by the signing of the
ANZUS treaty, a loose military alliance
committing the parties to confer in the
event of an attack on any one of them.
The new Labor government in New
Zealand, while committed to maintain-
ing our traditional friendship, has con-
sistently been opposed to nuclear
weaponry and does not wish to harbor
nuclear vessels in New Zealand ports.
Furthermore, convinced of the insanity
of the nuclear arms race, New Zealand
is arguing in international forums for
making the Pacific a nuclear-weapons-
free zone.
These policies are supported by at
least two-thirds of the New Zealand
voting population, not a mere handful
of radicals.
It is disturbing, therefore, that in its
attempts to pursue this policy the new
government is encountering heavy
pressure even intimidation from
American official circles. The American
embassy in Wellington has made state-
ments to the effect that refusing entry to
nuclear ships would cause an end to
ANZUS and it would now appear that
an agreement by the US not to dump its
butter and dairy surpluses on the world
market will not be honored if New Zea-
land continues with this policy. Other
threats of reduction in quotas for New
Zealand imports into America have also
been made.
I think it should be pointed out that
the voters of New Zealand have made
their intentions clear and our govern-
ment is carrying out their wishes. Such
heavy-handed and unwarranted intru-
sion in the affairs of a sovereign country
really make me wonder whether Ameri-
ca is our friend.
As a small country of only three mil-
lion people, New Zealand wishes to re-
main allied to a powerful friend such as
the US. However, continuation of the
present bullying approach will drive
New Zealand into a wholly non-aligned
stand which would be quite warranted.
If friends cannot differ and still re-
main friends, there was no friendship to
start with merely a master/slave rela-
tionship.

We are the only country in the free

The Cameron view
As I read Jim Cameron’s article (B,
October 16), I wondered what point he
was making as he successively
“I caught my husband smiling the
other day. ”
denigrated feminists, lesbians, pacifists,
humanists, ockers, intellectuals and
Christians. To my astonishment, the
point appeared to be an affirmation of
homo sapiens! Such extreme negativism
to make a supposedly positive point.
It is disappointing that Mr Cameron,
who once had a reputation as a debater,
has lapsed into obscure anti-intellec-
tualism. It is not good enough to dismiss
the arguments of feminists because
“they’ve never managed to be femi-
nine.” It is ridiculous to suggest that
lesbians would prefer that men not be
allowed to live life. (What about all the
heterosexual men, may I ask, who over
the centuries have denied women the
right to “live life?”) It is not inconsistent
for pacifists to argue against war but
then take up arms in defence of their
country. Humanists who do not believe
in God do not necessarily lack a spiri-
tual dimension. Intellectuals, by defini-
tion, are not necessarily devoid of hope.
Christian principles of faith, hope and
love have been tried by and have
worked for Christians and non-
Christians.
Mr Cameron condemns those with-
out hope, yet has done nothing to create
hope. His thesis of “Go out and enjoy
life, dammit” is simply a cruel joke for
those suffering injustice, poverty and
oppression. When the feminists, paci-
fists, humanists, intellectuals and
Christians have solved these problems,
then and then only will Mr
Cameron’s admonition be appropriate.

on the campaign trail in
Western Australia said he
was agreeing to a debate with
Opposition leader Andrew
Peacock. In Melbourne, Pea-
cock said he welcomed the
news and was prepared to
meet Hawke at any time and
in any place for the event.
National Party leader lan Sin-

Prime Minister to a debate “in
any forum.”
Tax alert
THE QUESTION of a capital
gains tax as an election issue
hotted up again after federal
Minister for Industry and
Commerce Senator John But-
ton discussed it approvingly
at a Canberra press confer-
ence. However, he and (separ-
ately) Prime Minister Hawke
insisted that the government
had for the time being no con-
crete plans to introduce the
controversial tax which (said
Hawke), if adopted, would ex-
clude the family home.
Magistracy boost
LEGISLATION which took
force last week in Victoria has
lifted the appointment of
magistrates and their tenure in
office to the level of judges of
higher courts. The laws
which also remove magis-
trates from the public service
were introduced to ensure
the independence of the mag-
istracy and to raise public
confidence in its role.

ban for both sexes. But the
council changed its mind after
a sit-down protest by both
boys and girls at the school
oval and lifted the ban.

Weapons worries
CALLS to cease the nuclear
arms race continued to
multiply. In Bonn, West
German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and his guest,
Romania’s President Nicolae
Ceausescu said they would
press the superpowers for a
return to nuclear arms reduc-
tion talks as soon as possible
after the presidential elections
in the United States. In
Helsinki, Finnish President
Mauno Koivisto and East
German President Erich
Honecker suggested the cre-
ation of nuclear weapons-free
zones in Europe. Meanwhile,
in an interview with the
Washington Post newspaper
Soviet chief Konstantine
Chernenko urged Reagan to
substantiate his conciliatory
words through concrete
deeds. These, he said, could
“signal the start of a real
drastic change in Soviet-Am-
erican relations.”
Mondale gains
ACCORDING to the latest
American ABC News and
Washington Post poll Walter
Mondale’s rating in the pre-
sidential elections campaign
rose five percent. He now
trails Ronald Reagan by 12
percent.
Duarte meets rebels
PRESIDENT Duarte of El
Salvador led a five-man
delegation to the first ever
meeting with four guerilla
leaders at La Palma, 90km
north of the capital, San
Salvador, to negotiate ending
the civil war. After six hours
of discussions, during which
the guerilla chiefs presented
29 conditions, the two sides
agreed to meet again in a
month.
ZAPU says ‘no’
JOSHUA Nkomo, veteran
leader of the opposition
Zimbabwe African People’s
Union (ZAPU) firmly rejected
plans of Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe, chief of the
governing Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic


Front party (ZANU), to cre-
ate a single party state next
year. Speaking at ZAPU’s
two-day national convention,
Nkomo said: “The congress
of ZAPU said a big ‘no’ to a
one-party state now or in the
future. We mean just that.’’

don, Sir Richard Stone
received the prize for
economics.
Border move
INDONESIA and Papua
New Guinea initialled a new
five-year border agreement to
replace the one signed in
1979. The new document is
hoped to improve relations
between the two countries
which were strained by Port
Moresby's allegations that
troops and jets from
neighboring Irian Jaya Lad
crossed the border into PNG
and by the infiltration of
almost 10,000 Irian Jaya re-
fugees into Papua New
Guinea.
Blow to Maoism
THE Chinese Communist
Party’s central committee
adopted a policy to reduce the
state’s role in economic
planning and in running busi-
nesses. The policy, to be fully
implemented in five years,
also abandons Maoism’s
egalitarian principles and
aims at rewarding diligent
workers and “punishing” the
lazy.
Gulf fighting
HEAVY fighting flared in the
Gulf war. Both Iran and Iraq
have reported important gains
and enemy losses. Iraq said its
second army “tore Iranian
troops to pieces.” Iran
insisted it drowned an Iraqi
offensive near Khorramshar
“in blood.”

COVER STORY/AUSTRALIA
Peacock gallant in the
shadow of the scaffold
The demeanor offederal Opposition leader Andrew Peacock in the face of electoral
defeat is winning him fresh admiration. DA VID BARNETT explains the
phenomenon and looks at the Liberals’ alternatives if they are again routed on December 1.
ANDREW PEACOCK is mounting the
scaffold for his execution on December
1 with such bravado that it may yet save
him not from defeat by Prime Minis-
ter Bob Hawke (nobody expects a mir-
acle of those dimensions) but from be-
ing deposed as leader immediately after
the general elections by an unsenti-
mental party.
The Liberals do not stick with their
Doc Evatts and Arthur Calwells
through defeat after defeat. They try to
choose winners, sometimes for such
misbegotten reasons as “good media
image” and “gets on well with the
press.”
Sir John Gorton, Sir William
McMahon and Peacock himself all had
those flimsy arguments working for
them.
Now, Peacock has produced another
argument: he has demonstrated that
unexpectedly, on the basis of his record
he can display his style in adversity.
Peacock has shown over the past
four or five weeks, with nothing to lose
as he and his party face the prospect of
electoral disaster, that he has guts.
Peacock has capitalised on two mis-
takes one of his own and one by
Hawke.
Peacock went too far when he called
the Prime Minister “a little crook” who
consorted with criminals. He ignored
advice to retract and live it down; in-
stead, he chose to use the unfavorable
publicity it generated as springboard for
an attack on the government’s handling
of organised crime.
“Charge, men,” he called and raced
toward the barricades. He looked
round, saw that he was alone and kept
going all the same. He won two import-
ant points: that the government would
strengthen the new National Crime
Authority if its head sought additional
powers and that any state vetoing an
investigation would have to do so pub-
licly.
The issue ran for three weeks and ob-
viously worried the Prime Minister. It
foundered when Hawke cried over his
family problems at a press conference
and when Peacock found himself un-
able to meet expectations that his office
“had something.”
Peacock’s party looked at the first
burst of headlines, counted the days to
the then-still-unannounced election and
members began to canvass the idea of a
change of leadership.
The chief alternative was (and still is)
Peacock’s deputy, John Howard.
Howard stood for the leadership
after the defeat of the Liberal-National
Party coalition government in March
last year, losing 36 to 20 after an erosion
of support during the final days.
Some were promised jobs by Pea-
cock. One of his first moves, for in-
stance, was to assure federal Liberal
Party director Tony Eggleton, that Pea-
cock as leader he would wish Eggleton
to continue.
One prominent New South Wales
member of the House of Representa-
tives took the view that the prime con-
sideration for the defeated Liberals was
stability and consolidation. Howard,
this member reasoned, would be a loyal
deputy to Peacock as Howard had
been to the routed prime minister,
Malcolm Fraser while Peacock, if he
did not make it, would start working
toward a takeover. So, that member
voted for Peacock.
Others saw Peacock as a popular fig-
ure, as the obvious heir and as a man
entitled to have his go.
None of those arguments is still
working for him.
The media might once have prefer-
red Peacock to Fraser but they do not
prefer him to Hawke. When looking for
an Opposition spokesman, they tend
nowadays to turn to Howard who is
more available and who has had more
to say less bombastically. (Howard is
one of the very few prominent politi-
cians who does not seem frightened of
giving the Australian Broadcasting Cor-
poration’s Richard Carleton an inter-
view.)
Peacock might have been able to de-
liver jobs as shadow ministers but he is


The top team that will tell all
David Barnett
Richard Farmer
Alan Reid
AS THE 1984 federal election campaign gets under way, The
Bulletin is gearing to cover it with Australia’s top team of
political writers. The line-up includes former staffers of both
the present and the former prime ministers of Australia.
The Bulletin’s Canberra correspondent Richard Farmer is
one of the best-known and best-read writers on the national
political scene. Farmer first came to Canberra in 1965 to work
for Sir Frederick Wheeler at the Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice Board. After 18 months as a public servant (“the most
instructive period of my working life”), Farmer joined
Maxwell Newton, writing for political and economic newslet-
ters, The Economist and The Financial Times of London. He
re-entered the mainstream of journalism in 1971 as political
correspondent of the Sunday Australian. When that paper
closed, he became political correspondent of the Daily Tele-
graph and Sunday Telegraph. Leaving journalism to found a
family wine business, Farm-
er worked for the Labor
Party on the 1980 and 1983
election campaigns being
closely associated with Bob
Hawke in the latter.
The Bulletin’s latest re-
cruit, David Barnett, who
wrote the cover story for this
edition, has vast experience
on the opposite side of poli-
tics. Barnett spent seven
years, from 1975 to 1982, as
press secretary to Prime
Minister Malcolm Fraser.
Before that, Barnett had ex-
tensive experience as a jour-
nalist. He had worked in
Australia, Africa, Europe,
the Middle East and Asia. In
1972, he established the Aus-
tralian Associated Press bu-
reau in Canberra.
Alan Reid, doyen of the
press gallery, will also be
covering the campaign for
The Bulletin. This will be
Reid’s 20th federal general
election campaign. He has
David Armstrong
Lenore Nicklin
covered more campaigns and known more prime ministers
than has any other living pressman or politician.
The Bulletin also has, of course, exclusive rights to the
Morgan Gallup Poll. This is the poll most respected and
widely quoted among political aficionados and the one
awaited eagerly or tensely by the politicians themselves.
Morgan Gallup was the first poll to show Prime Minister
Hawke’s popularity rating had topped 70 percent a rating
later confirmed by other polls. Morgan Gallup also tipped a
Labor victory in the last election, as it has tipped accurately in
previous elections. In the election campaign, Morgan Gallup
will not only give its usual regular assessment of how the
parties and their leaders rate; it will also look at other aspects
of the campaign, such as the poll printed in the October 23
edition which showed the issues that voters considered to be
the most important and the poll in this edition showing whom
Deborah Hope
Larry Pickering
voters prefer as leaders of
the major parties.
The Bulletin’s political
writing team will be backed
by the magazine’s line-up of
top journalists.
Writers such as Bruce
Stannard, Lenore Nicklin,
David Armstrong and De-
borah Hope will provide
special articles giving depth,
color and insight on the im-
portant and unusual aspects
of the campaign.
On the lighter side, the in-
imitable Larry Pickering will
be featuring a special page
of cartoons each week
titled “Pickering’s Election”
in addition to cartoons
from Mark Lynch and the
rest of our regulars.
And we will of course,
have illustrations by Ward
O’Neill, winner of the 1984
Walkley Award for his out-
standing cover illustration
of minister Mick Young
as Paddington Bear. □


not going to deliver minis-
tries on December 1.
He is widely felt to have
failed to rebuild the Lib-
erals’ links with the busi-
ness community. He has
failed to cultivate the aca-
demics, even though politi-
cal parties have a great
need while in opposition
for input from intellec-
tuals.
Above all, he has had
his go.
At best for him, the
numbers are about even.
Howard recoiled a
month ago from the sug-
gestion that a coup be
staged against Peacock,
even when it was couched
in terms of Howard’s
having a duty to save the
party from a debacle. He
felt 18 months ago that he
had to stake his case but es-
sentially he, too, belongs to
the school which con-
sidered that Peacock so
long branded a future lead-
er was entitled to his go.
The mistake which
Hawke made which is
helping Peacock in his
struggle to survive was the
decision to announce an
election date seven weeks
in advance.
Liberal Party founder
Sir Robert Menzies (whose
seat Peacock inherited)
took the view that he could
hold the attention of the
electorate for about two-
and-a-half weeks. That has
been conventional wisdom
since.
Hawke uses ridicule
against Peacock and pre-
tends contempt for him
and his image although
Hawke has become just as
well dressed and as care-
fully groomed.
If Hawke had come to
believe in his own rhetoric about his ri-
val to the extent of abandoning one of
the tenets of political craft, that was a
mistake.
The long campaign is already work-
ing to Peacock’s advantage, not
only against Hawke but also against
Howard.
Peacock is no longer “Mr Gucci,” he
is the alternative prime minister whose
views must be taken seriously because,
in theory, they could become govern-
ment policy in December. So, almost
for the first time, what he has to say is
going into the paper.
He is receiving equal exposure to
Hawke’s for three times as long as nor-
mally would be the case. Peacock has
three times as long to argue the Opposi-
tion’s case about taxes on superannu-
ation and the assets test on pensions in
the 18 marginal seats which the Opposi-
tion needs to win.
Especially, however, Peacock has
three times as long to convert the issues
of the campaign from what Hawke
wants which is the government’s
economic record to what the Opposi-
tion wants: taxation.
And Peacock has been highly suc-
cessful. Hawke and his Treasurer Paul
Keating will not rule out the possibility
of a capital gains tax, a wealth tax or
death duties. The labor leaders only say
that there will be a review and that the
total taxation harvest will not be in-
creased.
As a result, the government is on the
defensive on a vital issue.
Another area in which the govern-
ment is vulnerable is over Aboriginal
land rights. Minister Clyde Holding has
been preparing legislation but he is
holding his hand until after the elec-
tions. That issue could turn out to be
another mess for the government, to
Peacock’s advantage, during the next
five weeks.


Meanwhile, Peacock continues to
display the form which he discovered
during his aborted campaign over or-
ganised crime. He is cheerful, energetic
and unflagging and a good face-to-face
campaigner. You would not guess that
he was a politically hanged man. Pea-
cock acts as if the difference between the
55 percent which public opinion polls
give the Australian Labor Party and the
37 percent they give the coalition parties
is not 18 points but eight and closing
fast.
Hawke’s Morgan Gallup Poll ap-
proval rating is 69 percent while Pea-
cock’s is 20 (even lower than
McMahon’s in 1972 when he lost gov-
ernment to Gough Whitlam). Peacock
remains unbowed, as if there had been a
mistake in the figures and the entry for
his disapproval rating of 67 percent
should be the other way around.
No aristocrat ever went more gal-
lantly to the guillotine.
All the Liberals have been driven to
respect Peacock for keeping his end up
and some say that, if he can hold the
line and not lose seats, he will at least
survive the immediate post-election
period.
Howard is not the only alternative.
Michael Mackellar, Jim Carlton, lan
MacPhee and Steele Hall all see them-
selves as potential prime ministers.
Hall is likely to join in a challenge
but it is not considered that his support
is large. He is a “wet” when, for the time
being, the middle ground is a lost cause
for the Liberals.
Carlton is a certain challenger. He is
not inhibited by the sense of decorum
which is staying Howard’s hand until
after the elections. Carlton is already
busy gathering around him a coterie of
advisers who support his bid.
Carlton is a “dry” and one of his
party’s intellectual engines but he has
not distinguished himself as a public
performer. As a New South Welshman,
Carlton would cut into Howard’s sup-
port without replacing him as the main
alternative.
The “wild card” is Paul Everingham,
former Chief Minister of the Northern
Territory. He is more popular in the ter-
ritory than Hawke is in the nation at
large, with an approval rating above 80
percent.
Last November, Everingham
withstood a campaign from Hawke to
lead the Liberal-Country League back
to office with a huge majority in North-
ern Territory elections. He resigned as
Chief Minister to oppose his former law
partner John Reeves who is the only sit-
ting member of the House of Represen-
tatives thought likely to lose his seat on
the old boundaries.
Everingham will not say whether he
would join the National Party or the
Liberals in Canberra but he has not
PUBLIC OPINION
Howard preferred as opposition leader
ANDREW PEACOCK is no longer the
people’s choice as federal Opposition
leader. According to the Morgan
Gallup Poll, he now ranks behind depu-
ty leader John Howard and former
prime minister Malcolm Fraser.
The poll, published exclusively in
The Bulletin , found that only 14 percent
of voters preferred Peacock as leader.
This represents a plunge of 20 percent
in Peacock’s support since April, when
a similar poll was last taken.
The 20 percent preference for Pea-
cock among Liberal-National Party
voters is 19 percent lower than Fraser’s
low of 39 percent and 24 percent lower
than the 44 percent preference by
United Australia-Country Party voters
for Robert Menzies in August 1943.
Then, 24 percent preferred Arthur
Fadden and 18 percent Billy Hughes. In
the same Gallup Poll in 1943, John
Curtin was preferred by 74 percent of
Labor voters while 20 percent preferred
Dr H. V. Evatt.
In this latest Australia-wide survey,
1724 electors were interviewed on the
two weekends of October 6 and 13.
Those interviewed were shown a list of
leading Australian Labor Party
members and asked, if they were an
ALP voter, which one they would prefer
as prime minister.

PICKERING’S ELECTION


given up the chief minister-
ship for nothing.
He will sit with the Liberals
and one day he will seek to be
their leader. But not yet at this
stage, that would be so im-
practical as to be ridiculous.
The other figure looming in
the wings is that of Fraser,
draped impressively across
the screen during television
current affairs programs.
Fraser says that he would
only consider a return in cir-
cumstances too dire to con-
template. Such circumstances
would be a crushing defeat for
the conservative parties in
December, followed by an-
other at the next elections,
leading to their collapse.
Fraser has not lost his flair
for telling the truth as if he
were telling a lie. He receives
invitations from all around
the world to speak. He is
having a very nice time, lead-
ing what he calls a non-vitri-
olic life.
He is not in the mood for a
return to the centre of politics
and nor, it must be said, are
the Liberals or the business
community on his behalf. He should be
believed.
Fraser always thought well of the
Liberal’s Senate leader, Fred Chaney,
and created a vacancy in Western Aus-
tralia so that he could move to the lower
house.
But Chaney failed to gain pre-selec-
tion. He remains in the Senate, a highly
intelligent and humanitarian, somewhat
impish figure who missed his chance
and probably is not sorry.
Howard is not a man whose person-
ality prompts clever remarks. He is con-
scientious, articulate and game. He did
not repudiate Fraser and his policies
when defeat made them so unfashion-
able and Howard’s integrity is never
questioned. He is an economic “dry.”
His critics say that he is somewhat
colorless a comment which could
have been made of John Curtin, the
wartime prime minister so much ad-
mired by the flamboyant Hawke.
It may be that the most successful
opposition leaders are those who pre-
sent the sharpest contrasts to the prime
ministers against whom they line up.
The Liberals decided 18 months ago,
when they chose Peacock as their lead-
er, to match flamboyance with flamboy-
ance. Naturally, the man with the most
is winning.
If the Liberals want a change after
the next election, they have no real
choice but to match a steady baseline
tactician against serve, volley and dash
to the net. □
THE LIBERALS
Malcolm Fraser:
the view from
the sideline
Malcolm Fraser: “'Never' is a word I don’t use...”
ROB WALLS/RAPPORT
By BRUCE STANNARD
IF THE federal election goes as disas-
trously for Andrew Peacock and the
Liberal Party as most political analysts
expect it will, then former prime minis-
ter, Malcolm Fraser, will almost certain-
ly be prepared to plunge back into the
maelstrom of Australian political life.
Fraser, who was Australia’s second
longest serving Prime Minister, has lost
none of his considerable skill at shadow
boxing but in an interview with The Bul-
letin in Melbourne last week offered the
most tantalizing evidence that should
the December 1 poll go particularly
badly for the Liberals then he would be
prepared, “for the sake of the country”
once again to step in as a strong and
experienced alternative to the Hawke
government.
When, towards the end of a long dis-
cussion, I put that question to him di-
rectly he said: “I don’t think I should
respond to that kind of question when
an election campaign has just started. I
would have to give the kind of response
I gave during my own election cam-
paigning and that is there is only one
poll that counts. That in the
end remains true.”
If, as he expects, his worst
case economic scenario also
materialises and President
Reagan’s ballooning deficit
does lead to a sharp and
severe international recession
in the very near future then
that would also clearly consti-
tute the kind of grounds he
has consistently mentioned as
being necessary for political
comeback.
It is hard to escape the im-
pression that Malcolm Fraser
is already running for high
office. Eighteen months after
he was soundly rejected by the
electorate he appears to be as
busy as ever he was in Can-
berra. In the space of 24 hours
last week he appeared on the
ABC’s Nationwide program,
gave a long interview to the
Melbourne Herald, then The
Bulletin and followed with a
radio appearance with Syd-
ney chat show host Ita
Buttrose.
He appeared to be getting
at least as much media atten-
tion as the present Opposition
leader. There was a wry grin on his face
when he said: “Tamie says the whole
journalistic world misses me because
they haven’t got anyone to hate any
more. Crawling over my carcass got the
adrenalin of a lot of journalists moving
very warmly. They don’t seem to have
somebody cast in the same role at the
present time.”
Fraser, who appeared unusually
warm, relaxed and cheerful was also
very careful not to say anything which
might knock the idea of his political res-
urrection. “I think it’s just too early to
make those sorts of judgments,” he said.
“After all, I’ve only been away from the
place for 18 months.”
But, I asked, was it not indicative of
the severe decline in Liberal Party for-
tunes since his departure that people,
even after so short a time, were now, if
not actually clamoring, then certainly
talking about his saviour-like re-emer-
gence to lead the conservative faithful
out of the political wilderness?
“I can only say to that, that I hope
circumstances don’t unfold in that way.
‘Never’ is a word I don’t use because it’s
final and absolute. Anyone who has
been in public life all their life as I have
and who still has some working life left
... if your country is at risk and enough
people really wanted you to do some-
thing about it, is it something you can
refuse? It would obviously be very hard
to refuse.”
Pressed to describe in greater detail
what those circumstances might include


Prime Minister Bob Hawke: still preferred
he said: “Basically it would be a situa-
tion in which the Labor Party was
making a mess of Australia and the Lib-
eral Party was not responding to the
challenge. But,” he added, “it’s not just
a question of the Liberal Party failing to
respond to what the electorate wanted.
It would be a matter of what Australia
needed.”
It would, he said, be going too close
to politics to try to define the terms fur-
ther. Fraser revealed that approaches
had been made by people seeking to
have him rejoin the political fray. He
had, he said, given them similar replies.
Was it frustrating, given all the top-
level international political and econ-
omic contacts he still enjoys, to be on
the outside looking in on the current
Australian political scene?
“Not really,” he said. “I’ve enjoyed
the last 18 months outside the vitriolic
world. The sense of relief is really enor-
mous. I suppose looking back there
were ways in which I added to the
sharpness of debate in ways in which I
subsequently wished I hadn’t. I really
do enjoy what I’m doing. I’m quite cer-
tain my family are glad I’m no longer
part of the political process. My wife is
very happy doing all the things she
wasn’t able to do all those years when
she was supporting me. I’m sure if she
had been prime minister she never
would have been beaten.”
Fraser said his plans for the immedi-
ate future centred on his farm and the
building of a “shack” in Tasmania from
which he could indulge his passion for
wild brown trout fishing.
Policy Directions, his American-style
think-tank, has completed its first major
paper, on education. Fraser said publi-
cation may be delayed because of the
election campaign. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Labor support
drifts but still
a poll winner
THE HAWKE government would have
held power with an increased majority
had a federal election been held on the
weekend of October 13/14, the Morgan
Gallup Poll finds.
However, the poll also showed that
support for the ruling Australian labor
Party had been cut by 5 percent. This
brings it back to the long-term trend but
Labor’s loss has not been fully to the
Liberal and National parties’ gain. The
L-NP picked up three points of the
swing, with one switching to the
Australian Democrats and one to others
and undecideds.
Oppositon leader Andrew Peacock’s
approval rating dropping 1 percent to
an all-time low of 19 percent while 66
percent (down 1) disapproved and 15
percent were undecided. Approval of
the way in which Peacock is handling
his job is the lowest obtained by the
Morgan Gallup Poll for any federal
leader.
Of all electors surveyed, 71 percent
(down 3) said they felt that Bob Hawke
made the better Prime Minister while 15
percent (unchanged) said Peacock
would. Of Liberal and National voters
surveyed, 40 percent (down 5) said
Hawke made the better Prime Minister,
38 percent (unchanged) said Peacock
would and 22 percent were undecided.
The results come from asking 958
electors which party would receive their
first preference “if a federal election
were held today for the House of
Representatives.” Only 5 percent did
not state a preference.

DISARMAMENT
The conscience
of Janet
Holmes a Court
By DENIS REINHARDT
WHEN JANET Holmes a Court was a
child, the writer Katharine Susannah
Prichard was a luminary in Janet’s
mother’s circle of friends. In an era
when it was distinctly unfashionable to
be a communist, the adolescent Janet
Ranford was a consumer of
reformism.
“I don’t think that the
biggest influence was the fact
that Katharine Susannah
Prichard was a communist,
because obviously I’m not a
communist and my parents
indeed were not communists,”
she says today.
“The real influence is that I
was surrounded by women
who were independent, think-
ing and concerned people.”
A great treat on occasional
Fridays was to accompany her
mother to the Modern
Women’s Club in a city cellar,
events from which Janet
formed the view that women
could do anything.
“When I look back, it must
have been quite a massive
thing at that time,” she says.
“They were the bridge
from the suffragettes and they
didn’t need the women’s liber-
ation movement.”
From these articulate and
forceful women, Janet.
Holmes a Court - now 40, mother of
four, wife of one of Australia’s most
polished entrepreneurs can trace her
modest support for Australia’s newly-
formed Nuclear Disarmament Party.
She vividly recalls Bessie Reischbeth,
a pillar of Perth society and aunt of
Dame Rachel Cleland whose husband
was one of the Liberal Party’s founders,
standing knee-deep in mud in the path
of bulldozers filling Swan River fore-
shores. Holmes a Court says she is ready
to help block the path to a nuclear
holocuast.
“My kids call me a ‘greenie’ which
I take as a compliment,” she says, “but I
feel that each generation is handed the
Earth in a certain condition and, with
certain limits, we should hand it on to
the next generation as we found it. It’s a
bit like opening and closing farm gates
you leave them as you find them. And
I think the generations that were
handed this planet at the beginning of
this century and the generations that
have had it between now and the year
2000 have really made the most horrific
dent in so many things.”
Husband Robert Holmes a Court
tells her that she is impetuous, explains
Janet. But sometimes he is so absorbed
in a project that he might hardly talk for
two days. This does not mean that they
do not share strong interests or that they
do not consult. But her decision to give
a small donation to the Nuclear Dis-
armament Party was taken indepen-
dently.
“When these people asked me for a
donation, I really jumped at it, because
I have so often said that I am concerned
Janet Holmes à Court: “My kids call me a ‘greenie’...”
RICHIE HANN
about this but I don’t ever do anything
about it.
“I felt that, by giving them a small
donation, it was one way I could con-
tribute.”
She was at first reluctant to discuss
the amount. One newspaper suggested
that she was bankrolling the party’s
$BO,OOO Senate campaign. But the sup-
port, she says, was “pathetically small.”
The Bulletin can reveal that it was $2OO.
“The reason I gave them the dona-
tion was twofold. Firstly, instead of say-
ing all the time I’m concerned about the
nuclear thing, I could actually give
something. Secondly, I think to have a
nuclear disarmament party putting can-
didates forward for parliament will
draw attention to the issue. It will make
more people think about it.”
Single-issue parties have succeeded,
argues Holmes a Court.
Could she see herself demonstrating
against visiting nuclear warships? “I
loathe the way we are a nuclear target. I
suppose I really should demonstrate but
perhaps my role is different.”
The Holmes a Court donation was a
coup for the new peace group but was
not supposed to be publicised, convenor
and Senate candidate Jo Vallentine told
The Bulletin.
“Since then, however, all kinds of
people have been giving us their sup-
port,” Vallentine said. As well as in
Western Australia, National Disarma-
ment drawing inspiration from West
Germany’s Green Party plans to field
Senate candidates in Victoria, the Aus-
tralian Capital Territory and NSW
where rock music star Peter Garrett is
running.
Janet Holmes a Court says:
“I think David Lange is so
brave because so many things
in the world are economic and
(barring nuclear ships) is a
great economic step to take
for a little country like New
Zealand.
“The Americans are such a
big part of their market that
they can pressure them so
enormously and we are such
great mates of the Americans
that it’s highly likely that we’ll
be invited to pressure them.
He’s very, very brave.
“I really don’t like living
six kilometres (from Fre-
mantle) within shooting dis-
tance of Russian submar-
ines.”
Holmes a Court is remem-
bered by university peers as
being very cerebral and ex-
; ceedingly attractive. It was in
■ student guild politics, where
: she was a vice-president, that
: she met Robert. He was a
locally-elected representative

One peer (and hopeful beau) was

When their first son, Peter, was two
years old in 1970 Janet established a

Claremont home. It is still operating,
partly funded by the Holmes a Courts.
The state government had been trying to
close a similar playschool in the
country. “Many people thought I was
doing something illegal. Some of our
mothers got worried and said perhaps
we should not go ahead with this. My
attitude was that I was providing a ser-
vice the government wasn’t able to or
wasn’t willing to provide.
“If they’d wanted me to close it
down, I might well have fought it. It
didn’t arise and, in fact, the government
became far more lenient on those situa-
tions because they took the point.” □
THE MEDIA
‘Big guns’ in the West under circulation fire
FOR the next two weekends Perth
newspaper readers will be treated to a
publishing free-for-all which will make
east coast bingo circulation battles like
games between friends.
In a single, bold promotional on-
slaught against his two major rivals in
this already overcrowded newspaper
marketplace, Robert Holmes a Court’s
brassy Western Mail will offer free
classified advertising space and buy a
record circulation by paying a dollar to
charity for every copy of the newspaper
sold on the first weekend of the promo-
tion. Holmes a Court’s executives plan
to print 283,000 copies with
up to 80 pages of free adver-
tising, ostensibly as part of a
charity telethon run by
Holmes a Court’s other major
Perth media interest, TVW 7.
The estimated cost of the
attempt to “shake” rich classi-
fied advertising and steal cir-
culation from the Saturday
edition of the Melbourne Her-
ald-owned West Australian
and News Limited’s Sunday
Times will be at least
$500,000. At present the West-
ern Mail claims a circulation
of 160,000 while the Saturday
West Australian sells 238,000
and the Sunday Times
252,000. Both the latter are the
principal outlets for classified
advertising in Perth, carrying
around 70 pages each weekly.
Holmes a Court’s attempt
to buy circulation is also
viewed within his tight circle
of advisers as a full-scale pro-
duction test for launching a
daily onslaught against the
West Australian. The Western
Mail presently publishes on
Friday evening with an
updated edition selling
through Saturday.
Over the two weekends the
Western Mail will come close to creating
records in Australian newspaper pub-
lishing, at a time when a sagging trend
continues in Australian reader-
ship patterns.
Using $2O-million worth of newly in-
stalled press lines, allowing full color
printing throughout the paper, the
Western Mail is projected to run to 270
pager, including a 60-page full color
magazine insert already an estab-
lished component.
The Western Mail, with its gaudy
spread of color and sectional liftouts,
will attempt to create new ground in
Robert Holmes a Court: waging a newspaper war
ROB WALLS/RAPPORT
Australia by publishing continual
edition updates between Friday evening
and Sunday morning.
But it is the pitch for classifieds, the
revenue which is needed to reduce
operating losses associated with starting
up the Western Mail, which Holmes a
Court is keen to win. The free classifieds
may be kept up in subsequent weeks in
an effort to take the Western Mail’s
classified content to around 30 pages.
“We have nothing to lose, they have
everything to lose against us” is the way
John Reynolds, chief executive of both
TVW 7 and the Western Mail described
the pending battle.
“One very good way to get
the circulation up is to con-
centrate on classifieds. We’re
already number one in the
new home advertising market
and we’re doing well in the
used home area “Reynolds
told The Bulletin.
The Holmes a Court group
will also use its Perth radio
station as part of a sustained
follow through.
“We’ve really got a vehicle
that can work for the classi-
fied advertiser,” Reynolds
said.
“I think we’ve got to pro-
mote that very aggressively,
which we haven’t done to
date. We’ve promoted circula-
tion aggressively but not
classifieds. In January and
February, frankly, we can use
the television media at no op-
portunity cost to us to get us
cracking.”
Reynolds argues that man-
agement of the West Austra-
lian, in particular, is so wor-
ried about falling circulation
and hindered by outmoded
plant that it will not be able to
react effectively. □

POLITICS
The pretenders
still frisky in
Macquarie Street
Deputy Premier Ron Mulock and left leader Frank Walker
NEVILLE WALLER
By DEBORAH HOPE
JOSTLING FOR positions by Labor
leadership contenders in NSW is ex-
pected to continue despite Premier
Neville Wran’s announcement to cabi-
net last week that he plans to lead the
party into the 1988 state election.
Elements of Wran’s government are
convinced that, no matter what the
Premier’s public stance, he is likely to
vacate the leadership before July next
year. The Labor Party machine in NSW
is more of the opinion that Wran’s re-
tirement is at least 12 months away.
However, it is likely that the man-
oeuvring will continue in a more cir-
cumspect and less urgent manner than
during the Premier’s two-week absence
overseas this month.
Informal but intense left-right nego-
tiations took place during Wran’s ab-
sence and, although no deals were
finalised, it is believed that as a result
Public Works minister Laurie Brereton
and Youth and Community Services
minister Frank Walker are approaching
an arrangement for a joint ticket in the
event of an early leadership ballot.
Other contenders involved in these
talks included Police minister Peter An-
derson and Environment and Planning
minister Terry Sheahan. Although he
clearly has leadership aspirations,
Deputy Premier Ron Mulock has not
been involved in the discussions and At-
torney-General Paul Landa is no longer
considered to be in the race. Transport
minister Barrie Unsworth often sug-
gested as Wran’s successor would
have to find a lower house seat, putting
him out of the running in any sudden
contest.
Having failed to secure the deputy
leadership after the retirement of Jack
Ferguson, left-winger Walker has re-di-
rected his sights from the premiership
and toward extracting the best deal pos-
sible for the left in return for support of
one of the contenders. Minimum condi-
tions are regaining the deputy position
for the left (that is, for himself) and in-
creasing the number of positions for the
left in the ministry. (The left holds four
of 19.)
A key member of the right-wing ma-
chine in NSW, Senator Graham
Richardson, was also involved in the
discussions.
Speculation within the party about a
change of leadership came to a head last
week after The Bulletin published an
opinion poll showing the Premier’s ap-
proval at 38 percent 13 percent below
that of Opposition leader
Nick Greiner.
The origins of the
speculation about a June
retirement by Wran are to
be found in his comment at
an ALP national executive
meeting last December that
he would not remain if
members of the NSW
Legislative Council were
allowed to join the lower
house Labor caucus. “If
they go in, I go out,” he is
reported to have said.
However, at the executive’s
September 28 meeting,
Wran supported July 1985 as the date
for the joint caucus to commence.
Other indicators MPs put forward as
signals of an early retirement included
the battering of allegations concerning
Wran this year, his outspokenness re-
garding the Briese affair, Prime Minister
Hawke’s recent lukewarm expression of
support for the Premier and the
thwarted career ambitions of Wran’s
wife.
Another reason behind the leader-
ship push, however, is that some leader-
ship contenders stand to gain more than
others if Wran retires before next July.
In the present caucus, Mulock holds
more votes than any of the other con-
tenders for leadership. His chances of a
victory will be reduced when the
caucuses meet jointly. (Of the 24 Labor
members of the upper house, Unsworth
is said to carry 18.)
Brereton also stands to gain from a
pre-July ballot, since this is the time
when left-wing support would have the
greatest chance of making him the win-
ner. In a post-July or even a post-1988
ballot the result would be far less cer-
tain. Anderson would have had time to
build on his substantial standing and
Unsworth had time to seek a lower
house seat.
While Unsworth and Anderson
would benefit from a later poll, the left’s
only real chance of being a power be-
hind the leadership is if Wran retires be-
fore the joint caucus commences (in the
new caucus the left will command only
25 of 83 votes, compared to 21 of the
present 59).
Countering the suggestion that the
left is responsible for speculation, how-
ever, is that the left caucus made an in-
formal approach to Wran two months
ago offering full support for his con-
tinued leadership.
Wran had made clear that he would
not retire while allegations hung over
his head. He told members of his cabi-
net and the caucus last week to forget
about an imminent change of leadership
and to “get behind” him.
With this plea, the Premier would
have consolidated the considerable sup-
Laurie Brereton
port for him among the
backbenchers who see
leadership speculation as
seriously destabilising for
the government.
There are still those
within the party machine
who believe, however, that
it is by no means certain
that Wran will be the lead-
er in 1988. “The contend-
ers are so active because
they don’t know when it
will be but they want to be
ready in case it’s this after-
noon,” said one prominent
member. □

RELIGION
Brian Gore is
out to prick
our consciences
By BRUCE STANNARD
SIXTEEN YEARS among the Filipino
poor have left indelible marks on the
mind of Father Brian Gore. The corrup-
tion, violence, torture and oppression
on the one hand and, on the other, the
indomitable spirit and unshakeable
faith of the ordinary Filipino have
helped to shape a man who is hardened
yet touched deeply and sincerely by the
plight of those who literally have
nothing more than the shirts on their
backs.
At home in Perth, the squeaky-clean
capital of one of the world’s richer
states, Gore is surrounded daily by what
seems like conspicuous consumption on
a grand scale.
He has come home like a prickly,
stinging burr under our glossy social
saddle. He can’t help spiking the con-
science of comfortable, middle-class
Australia.
Gore has managed to upset quite a
few conservative catholics along the
way. Just before he was thrown into a
Filipino jail on trumped-up charges of
multiple murder, inciting rebellion and
possession of arms and explosives, Gore
came home on leave. Preaching at Cor-
pus Christi in Mosman Park recently, he
chose a passage from the Acts of the
Apostles to drive home the notion that
perhaps we ought to share a little of our
vast wealth with those who have
nothing.
“The believers all met together and
had everything jointly,” he told the con-
gregation. “They sold their property
and their belongings and distributed
them to all, as anyone might have
need.”
It was at that point that a man (iden-
tified subsequently as a defeated Liberal
candidate) stood up and shouted: “I’m
sorry, father, I can’t take any more.
That’s ... socialismV'
Gore said: “He stormed out of the
church and slammed the door. You
could have heard a pin drop. I looked
down at the congregation and they were
absolutely stunned. Nothing like that
had ever happened in exclusive
Mosman Park before. I said: ‘He calls it
socialism. I'call it the gospel.’
“Well, there was a great hubbub in
the parish over that but it got people
thinking. A little consciousness-raising
won’t do anyone any harm.”
The second son of a Fremantle bar-
ber, Gore underwent a quintessential
Catholic upbringing. An altar boy at St
Aidan’s, Mosman Park, at seven, he
endured the canings dished out by strict
Irish nuns sent out from Galway to beat
religion into the heathen antipodeans.
At St Patrick’s, the Christian
Brothers junior college in Fremantle, he
was a dogged though never brilliant stu-
dent. He learned the Latin Mass off par-
rot fashion like everyone else and never
understood a word of it.
A life in the missionary priesthood
was a natural and untroubled choice,
inspired in part by Rudyard Kipling
and memories of jungle flicks glimpsed
over popcorn at Saturday afternoon
movies at the local cinema. He was not
Gore: “the Church has an obligation to be involved”
ALF SORBELLO
interested in being a “humdrum” parish
priest. He wanted adventure in an
exotic setting and, after seven years of
toil at the Columban Mission Society’s
Sydney seminary, he was overjoyed
when he found “Philippines” typed in
large letters next to his name on a notice
board.
He sailed into the sweltering heat of
Manila harbor in 1969, a wide-eyed 26-
year-old loaded down with books on
theology he would never read. Over the
next 16 years, living among some of the
poorest people in South-East Asia, he
learned a radicalism that led him often
into head-on confrontations with the
military, the politicians and the land-
lords, all of whom had a vested interest
in maintaining what he calls a “neo-feu-
dal” society in which peasants had
come to see themselves as little more
than chattels.
This “turbulent priest,” as President
Marcos once described him, is likely to
play a major role in gingering-up Aus-
tralia’s social conscience over the next
decade.
Gore said: “Too many church people
have been interested in the life here-
after. But the struggle for justice on
Earth is an integral part of the gospel
teachings.”
Aboriginal land rights and the de-
struction of Aboriginal culture are obvi-
ous targets for his attention, although at
the moment he wants time to under-
stand all the issues. Other areas of con-
cern include uranium mining and what
he calls the “moral implications” of
Australia’s relations with some of its
South-East Asian neighbors.
He said: “Australian mili-
tary and economic aid is go-
ing to some repressive
regimes. We’ve got to examine
the question of whether in
propping up these dictatorial
governments we may be pro-
longing the suffering of their
people.”
All this begs the question
of whether priests should play
a role in politics.
“My answer,” he said, “is
that all these issues affect the
lives of all people. The church
therefore has an obligation to
be involved. The Pope has
said that the church can never
hesitate to take up the cause of
the poor and listen to the
voice of those who are not
listened to. Not when they ask
for charity but when they de-
mand justice.
“We take that as a very
clear mandate for social ac-
tion, especially since the Pope
chose to utter those words to
hundreds of thousands of
Negros sugar workers and
under the noses of the very planters who
exploit them. The planters’ response to
that was: ‘lf that’s the Pope’s message,
this is going to mean war.’ So Pope John
Paul II is a bit of a stirrer himself.”
To those who have suggested that a
foreign priest had no right interfering in
Filipino affairs, Gore argues that far
from interfering he was trying to uphold
Filipino law.
“People began to see there were two
sets of laws in the Philippines, one for
the rich and one for the poor. It’s the
Marcos Government which stirs up the
people by maintaining that inequity. In
Negros we kept a full-time staff of three
lawyers to deal with people’s problems.
Frustration and discontent is caused not
by priests but by the government that
can’t deliver simple justice.” □

lished by William Collins this week.)


AGRICULTURE
Plagued by
plagues-now
come locusts
By WILLA MCDONALD
MICE, LOCUSTS and soon mosqui-
toes the people of NSW’s south-west
are suffering a rash of plagues fit to test
the temper of an ancient Egyptian.
While the mouse plague is not ex-
pected to peak until next year and the
mosquitoes have yet to arrive, the im-
mediate problem for the Riverina is the
locusts. The sparsely populated area
from Broken Hill, Ivanhoe, Hillston
and Condobolin south to the River
Murray has hatchings of lo-
custs in plague proportions.
smaller outbreaks have ap-
peared in the northern end of
the Flinders Ranges, in cen-
tral and western NBW around
Cobar and Bourke, south to
Yunta in the Renmark area
of south Australia and as
far north as Charleville in
Queensland.
spraying (ground and aeri-
al) began last week in an effort
to keep numbers down. “You
can’t kill every last one,” said
Dr Phil Symmons, director of
the Australian Plague Locust
Commission. “Ninety percent
control would be bloody good
but the ones left could multi-
ply again, by 10 times, and
you would be back where you
started.”
Left unchecked, the dam-
age to crops and pasture
would be inestimable. Even
controlled, the damage can be
extensive for individual farm-
ers unlucky enough to be in
the path of flying swarms.
swarms can stretch for two
or three kilometres long, eat-
ing virtually everything in
their path. A swarm that size
can eat 100 tonnes of feed a
day. Where there is insuffi-
cient food, they have been
known to devour curtains
from windows and clothes
from the line.
Their numbers can make
driving impossible, blocking
vision and forcing motorists
to scrape the insects from the
radiator every few kilometres.
Even trains have been delayed
when swarms have covered
the tracks, making them too
slippery for wheels to grip.
The first hatchings of the plague lo-
cust Chortoicetes terminifera in the Riv-
erina area began in late september. The
young hoppers go through five stages
before they get their wings. Usually at
the third stage, they form bands which
are easier to spot-spray.
They appear from the air to be large
black streaks against green-brown pas-
ture.
The Riverina locusts are only in the
second growth stage, yet already can be
seen in thick bands from the air. “See-
ing them now, they are very dense in-
deed,” said Symmons. “There is no
ground between them at all, not a milli-
metre.”
The real problems start when they
take to the air, laying eggs as they go
and taking cover in crops. Migrating
swarms can travel 200 km from the orig-
inal breeding ground in a single genera-

tion. The locusts probably will fly south,
south-west and south-east.
Two and even three generations can
occur in a single season. The first gener-
ation will gradually die out by the end
of December. Depending on rainfall, a
second generation of locusts could be
hatching in January and a third to take
the plague through to autumn. The eggs
need warmth and moisture to develop
or else they will die or lie dormant until
next spring.
The commission is responsible for
the aerial spraying. At the peak of the
operation, it will use three spotter air-
craft and five or six to spray.
The commission has stockpiled
about 96.5 tonnes of fentriothioun for
spraying, an insecticide used for treat-
ing grain in stores which has a with-
holding period of about seven days. De-
pending on weather conditions, after
about three days it loses half
its effectiveness and will have
broken down completely at
the end of a fortnight.
The chemicals cost
$BOO,OOO of the $1.5 million
allocated to the commission
this year. Symmons expects
that budget to be exceeded by
the end of the season. The
commission is jointly funded
by states and commonwealth.
The states themselves are
responsible for ground spray-
ing. The NSW Department of
Agriculture has 35,000 litres
of fentriothioun and 41
tonnes of a fentriothioun/
malathion mixture for distri-
bution to the Pasture Protec-
tion Boards for use by local
farmers.
All landowners in NSW
are required to report hatch-
ings to the boards under the
Noxious Insects Act. Farmers
occasionally have been threat-
ened with prosecution for fail-
ure to do so.
During the last big out-
break, in the Dubbo area in
1979, the commission used
three helicopters on loan from
government instrumentalities
to roam the countryside spot-
ting hatchings and bandings.
“They would land at the
homestead and tell the guy,”
said Mark Childe, regional
media officer, Department of
Agriculture, Wagga. “They
were known as the ‘spy in the
sky’ and threats were made.
There are people who are lazy
farmers who just do not care,
as long as it doesn’t affect
them directly.” □

THE LEFT
Socialist Left
needs economic
act that’s right
By TIM DUNCAN
DESPITE its control of the ALP ma-
chine in Victoria, the Socialist Left fac-
tion is handicapped by its reluctance to
formulate credible and consistent pos-
itions on economic affairs.
For years the faction has been con-
tent to embrace activists obsessed with
single issues. As a result its
own agenda has come to re-
semble a patchwork manifes-
to of utopianism, reaction and
pragmatism. At recent state
conferences, the Socialist Left
has made more of Nicaragua,
Libya and the ecology of ura-
nium mining than it has of
many of the material concerns
of the Australian population.
Economics has been its
Achilles heel. Alluding to the
problem just after this year’s
national ALP conference, its
numbers man in Victoria, fed-
eral MHR Gerry Hand, sug-
gested that the left could not
expect to be taken seriously
until it took economics
seriously.
Some members of the
Victorian Socialist Left do
take economics seriously, but
they frankly admit that there
are not many of them, that
they are not well organised,
that they lack credibility (at
least for now), and that they
operate within a faction which
is still to recognise that econ-
omic questions have become
central to the current political debate.
Pete Steedman, MHR for the sensi-
tive federal seat of Casey, laments that
so few members of the Socialist Left are
prepared to think hard about economic
policy, thinking the reason might be
that so few in the faction have close ex-
perience of modern economic life. “You
don’t have to be a free marketeer, but
you should have some knowledge of
the way markets work,” he explains.
Mark Trethewey, a researcher for an-
other Socialist Left MHR, Andrew
Theophanous, is also concerned about
the lack of economic thinking.
On the faction’s economic policy for-
mation, he says: “As yet, despite a lot of
talk about getting its act together, that is
yet to come about. It’s not that the left is
intellectually devoid, it’s just that
they’re lacking in organisation.”
Since the federal conference, it ap-
pears nothing much has happened. Yet
those of the Socialist Left who want to
bring the faction face to face with econ-
omic policy are developing explana-
tions for the left’s hitherto poor per-
formance in the area, and are confident
they are beginning to bring about
changes in outlook.
The left’s response to federal
Treasurer Paul Keating’s proposal to
de-regulate the financial sector and to
float the dollar was to oppose it. But, as
one critic within the faction told The
Bulletin, the left has a tendency to take a
position at face value to use it to op-
pose what the right is proposing without
thinking hard about why it is doing so.
Pete Steedman: Few SL members think about hard economics
Lindsay Tanner, president of the
Economic Policy Development Com-
mittee of the Victorian ALP, is one of
the younger Socialist Left activists who
is becoming aware of such criticism. He
thinks that the left acted instinctively by
opposing the de-regulation of the
banks.
He said: “People in the left have
assumed that any regulation is a good
thing. But maybe they do not recognise
that the regime of regulation we have
may have been outgrown.”
Theo Theophanous, brother of
Andrew and also a Socialist Left mem-
ber of the economic policy committee,
makes a similar point on the floating of
the dollar: “As far as I can see, no mem-
ber of the left has put up a coherent
reason as to why the de-regulation of
exchange should not take place.”
Neither Theophanous nor Tanner
are economic libertarians. Rather, they
simply point out that the left has al-
lowed itself to be limited by knee-jerk
reactions on economic questions.
Members of the left freely point out
that economics is often regarded within
the faction as the “sell-out” area, and
that the faction is reluctant to confront
it for fear that it will have to make un-
bearable ideological compromises.
Alternatively, if it does not compromise
it will run a high risk of looking ridicu-
lous. As one member explained: “The
left has to start dealing with the real
world in the economic area.
“Take the question of the banks. On
one hand, we were confronted with the
big Australian banks and on
the other with the prospect of
foreign entry. Because we
didn’t want to compromise on
the entry of foreign banks, we
wound up supporting a dom-
estic high finance cartel and
that was ludicrous.
“It’s not surprising that the
left avoids the area, but be-
cause it fails to recognise the
centrality of economics, the
left keeps itself on the margin.
It doesn’t see that Nicaragua
or uranium is not what it’s all
about.”
The result is that the So-
cialist Left has allowed other
factions in the ALP to deter-
mine the party’s economic
agenda. Tanner, for instance,
supplies a list of policy areas
which he says should be
raised by the left, but upon
which it is silent. He refers to
the question of waste within
the public sector, to problems
of on-costs for small and me-
dium-sized firms, and to both
the public sector debt and the
foreign debt.
As Tanner sees it, Austra-
lia’s foreign debt figures are looking
troublesome, and he suspects that one
reason might be that the Foreign Invest-
ment Review Board has deterred com-
panies from importing capital as equity,
resulting in more of them resorting to
direct borrowing from overseas.
“There’s nothing wrong with econ-
omic nationalism,” he says, “but maybe
it’s not in the national interest that as a
result of nationalistic controls we might
have become too highly geared. This is
the sort of question on which the left
should contribute.”
Pete Steedman’s list is similar to Tan-
ner’s, only he has begun to put pen to
paper.
Steedman is unusual by the stan-
dards of the Socialist Left, not only be-
cause he talks of markets but also be-
cause he admits that the structural prob

lems of the Australian economy are
legitimate additions to the Socialist Left
agenda.
Steedman told The Bulletin that his
suggestion that the Accord become the
framework for the negotiation of struc-
tural change was derived more from
practicalities than from formal theory.
Not surprisingly, his arguments are
mostly the traditional ones of renewed
import replacement through added pro-
tection and of the selection of “key” in-
dustries for government-supported ex-
pansion, together with complementing
manpower training programs. But he
also stumbled across a structural expla-
nation for inflation, arguing that “the
persistence of inflation in a period of
high unemployment and monetary re-
straint testifies to the fact that inflation
is not primarily a monetary problem but
rather the outcome of a wage-price-tax
distributive struggle over shares in the
national product.”
Normally, inflation only gets a men-
tion from the Socialist Left when the
brethren are reminded that it should not
come first. So, on one hand the faction ,
has yet to come out with an or-
ganisational response to its problems
with economic policy; on the other,
there is evidence that its members who
are interested in these key questions are
beginning to develop some ideas and to
think about how to market them.
As Mark Trethewey explains, com-
munication was one of the lessons of the
last national conference for the left.
“We were accused of being paranoid
about the banks. But in this society if
you want more equality, then you must
worry about the banks. They, more than
anyone, have the power to stop social
reform. But that’s a more nebulous ar-
gument. It’s more political than econ-
omic, and perhaps we shouldn’t have
argued it. It might have been better to
have pointed out that with banking
competition you lose banking stability.
The more the competition, the more
risks the banks will take and the more
chance there will be of a collapse. The
left ignored how safe our system is.”
The “too-hard” basket, the need for
maintaining the warm inner glow, the
lack of familiarity with finance and
markets and both communicational and
organisational problems all contribute
to the economic reticence of the Social-
ist Left. But as well there are basic prob-
lems with developing a Socialist Left
theory of the Australian economy.
For other political animals this might
not prove so pressing a problem, but the
others jdo not call themselves “social-
ist.” Once, the Australian Socialist Left
was a movement broadly committed to
the socialisation of industry, to govern-
ment control and operation of industry.
Now the theoreticians are not so sure.
Tanner says that the left no longer talks
about it as a realistic possibility, Theo
Theophanous points out that experience
shows that nationalising industry does
not remove alienation, nor does it
necessarily promote efficiency.
Trethewey says, simply, that other
things come first.
But Theophanous also suggests that
the left is suffering for the reason that
economic events have left theory be-
hind. “The left was caught off guard by
changes in the international economy,”
he says. “It was thought that if you ran
into a depression, all you had to do was
pump the economy through government
spending and you were okay. But with
stagflation, people could not see the im-
plications.” As Theophanous sees it,
Marxian analysis, as well as Keynesian
theory, requires review in the light of
recent events.
According to Theophanous, the task
for the Socialist Left is to analyse the
stagnation of Australia, to establish
movements in the social wage, docu-
ment them and frame socialist policies
accordingly.
It sounds almost unbelievably am-
bitious, and one wonders whether or not
the Socialist Left will simply be swal-
lowing a small group of researchers’
version of economic history in much the
same way it has swallowed Bill
Hartley’s version of Libya, or Joe Cam-
illeri’s line on the politics of nuclear
power.
The Socialist Left has a traditional
love for the grand vision, and this in
part is why it does not happily engage
itself in detail. Indeed, a blueprint for
the Australian economy seems to be
what some of its economic thinkers
would dearly love.
“There isn’t, to my knowledge, a left
economic document and that’s a great
problem,” says Theophanous.
Nevertheless, the yearning for the
perfect theory is largely in the back-
ground, and as Theophanous suggests,
the first task is to outline in a way that
can be easily understood what the left
vision of Australian democratic social-
ism actually is. At this stage it seems that
might be easier said than done. □

THE OUTBACK
Hall of fame
for pioneers
moves to reality
A model of Feiko Bouman’s design for the Australian Stockman’s Hall of Fame
By JILL BOWEN
“LIFE,” as outback artist Hugh Sawrey
has often said, “is like a wagon wheel
bogged down in cow dung. Sooner or
later, the shiny side will come out on
top.” It did recently for Sawrey and his
fellow members of the board of direc-
tors of the Stockman’s Hall of Fame
when the cause was nominated as an
approved Australian Bicentennial
Authority project, with funding of $6
million.
The announcement, in Townsville,
was by Federal Home Affairs and En-
vironment minister Barry Cohen and
Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-
Petersen.
“The Stockman’s Hall of Fame will
honor the pioneers who opened up and
developed the interior of Australia,”
Bjelke-Petersen said. “Its galleries will
provide a national focus through art, lit-
erature, artifacts and memorabilia on
the way of life of these gallant Austra-
lians including women and Aborigines.
It will serve to remind us all of the vital
interdependence and historical ties be-
tween the country and the city.”
As a national-state bicentennial com-
memorative project, $3 million will
come from both the commonwealth and
state governments. With an additional
$500,000 special grant from the Queens-
land government the total budgeted
capital cost for the major building and
site works at Longreach is achieved.
The Hall of Fame will have to find
the remaining budgeted cost of $4.5 mil-
lion for art acquisition, display prepara-
tion, historical research and adminis-
tration to make a total of $ll million.
The hall’s national directors (a com-
posite body of people from each state)
are breathing easier about the financial
task still before them and confident of
raising $4.5 million to make the mem-
orial a reality by 1988.
If the building of a national mem-
orial can be compared to the shifting of
a bogged wheel, the board has had its
backs and shoulders applied to the task
for years. The cause was one of the first
to be drawn to the attention of the auth-
ority, soon after it was established in
1979, and the board worked hard to sat-
isfy the funding criteria. But it was con-
sidered by no means a certainty. Had it
not eventuated, the target date would
have gone back.
Board member Sir Frank Moore,
forthright chairman of the Queensland
Travel and Tourist Corporation, said:
“We’re constantly being told that we
need a new ‘identity,’ just as we need a
new plastic bank card. How about sup-
porting first the old one we’ve had that
has stood us in pretty good stead for
nearly a couple of hundred years?”
That is what the Hall of Fame set out
seven years ago to do to honor bush
pioneers and unsung heroes of the out-
back. Former ringer, shearer and head
stockman, Sawrey romanced the idea
around the outback over campfire dis-
cussions which is where it remained un-
til practical, thinking bush businessman
R. M. Williams stood up to be counted
alongside him and they invited any
other interested people to do so.
Towns and cities were asked in 1977
to make submissions for the national
site and 43 did. Alice Springs, Canberra,
Toowoomba, Warwick, Albury-
Wodonga, Rockhampton, Cloncurry
and Longreach were among them.
The board gave the thumbs-down to
capital and coastal venues, deciding in
1978 in an official ballot to plant the
memorial in dirt-brown authenticity.
Longreach, central Queensland stra-
tegically half-way between tourist
meccas, The Reef and The Rock was
chosen.
Directors went to the United States
on a study tour in 1979 to see how simi-
lar American memorials functioned and
were financed. A national competition
among architects followed their return.
Williams, Sawrey and company
wanted no Taj Mahal but called for a
building that smacked of the bush,
whether the inspiration be a gumleaf or
a gunyah.
Some 200 architects applied for the
brief with 88 submitting entries and the
winner was Feiko Bouman, of Sydney.
Bouman had been a member of the
design team in the winning entry in the
High Court building in Canberra in
1973, and in 1979 a finalist in the na-
tional competition for the Australian
Archives building in Canberra.
In 1980, the design was costed at
more than $2 million a figure that has
blown out since. The Hall of Fame set
out to find its money for the project and
the cause has never lacked for signifi-
cant and generous supporters.
Publisher Rupert Murdoch handed
over $lOOO to become the hall’s first pa-
tron member and pledged his com-
pany’s assistance wherever possible.
The corporation’s managing director,
Ken Cowley, was a foundation ap-
pointee to the national board.
Kerry Packer, of Australian Con-
solidated Press, gave $lO,OOO to assist
the cause when the money was most
needed. In Victoria, Melbourne’s in-
defatigable Lady Clarke huffed and
puffed in the right direction. Noted au


thor and historian Dame Mary Durack
pledged help from Western Australia.
Both women were appointed to the
board. Pioneer aviator Eddie Connellan
also joined the board, as a Northern
Territory representative, but Connellan
died of cancer last year and his berth
has gone to NT Speaker Roger Steele.
Pastoralist Wallace Munro joined the
board in NSW and in Queensland Sir
James Walker, Sir James Killen and
Moore did so. The chairman of the
Commonwealth Savings Bank, Charles
Schmidt, became a South Australian ap-
pointee.
Sydney businessman Dick Smith
said, ‘l’d like to help” and handed over
$70,000 in his solicitors’ offices. He
asked that no publicity surround the do-
nation. It was, Smith said, purely a pri-
vate gesture. A NSW pastoral family,
the Whites, of Scone, organised a
$30,000 trust fund for the project.
The board did not have to be told
that chook raffles and chocolate wheels
would not raise the money required. It
tuned in to “meaningful participation
fund-raising,” linking with Lansdowne
Press in an agreement to produce a
series of outback books. The first, The
Stockman , came out in August. Hall of
Fame literary .contributions and exper-
tise given to the book and its Sydney
launching earned the project nearly
$30,000.
In nearly 200 years of white settle-
ment, the Hall of Fame will be the
country’s second national memorial.
The first to war in Canberra,
offered few guidelines. Conceived in
1915 by war historian C. E. W. Bean
and authorised by an act of parliament
in 1925, the war memorial was opened
(in the middle of another war) in 1941.
Sawrey and Williams figured that
they could not wait so long the bid to
collect and preserve the country’s out-
back history could not stand dilly-dally-
ing.
The directors’ visit to the US showed
that the Cowboy Hall of Fame (the Am-
erican memorial to document its pion-
eers’ push westward) in Oklahoma City
had been financed privately by people
in the 17 western states. Williams and
Sawrey maintained that “a body of
caring Australians” could achieve a
similar result here and have been
proved correct. Government help, not
envisaged initially, has been a bonus.
There have been criticisms of the
name ... that “stockman” is too narrow
for the broader concept envisaged and
that it should have been called the Na-
tional Memorial to Outback Pioneers.
The site, too, has drawn criticism. Many
people did not know where Longreach
was. Others argued that it was too re-
mote. The board argued in return that a
bush memorial had no relevance in
Canberra, Melbourne or Sydney. □

ARBITRATION
Commission under fire again
By DEBORAH HOPE
THE ABRITRATION Commission, ac-
cording to most big employer organisa-
tions, is dangerously close to becoming
a branch of the Hawke government and
its decisions are threatening continued
economic recovery. That is what they
say when you ask them to define the
commission’s role in the present frame-
work of the ALP-ACTU accord.
Criticism is hardly new to the com-
mission. In its 80-year history, it has
weathered and won many battles and
there is no indication that it will not sur-
vive now. After all, even the employer
groups in their submissions to the Han-
cock inquiry into industrial relations
systems call for a continuation of a cen-
tralised wage fixing system.
Members of the commission and
their supporters dispute strongly any
suggestion of a loss of independence but
several factors warrant an examination
of the complaint.
The first is the tendency of the gov-
ernment to treat any criticism of the
commission as somehow un-Australian.
In this atmosphere, many employers are
too nervous to voice their criticisms and
will not give evidence to back sub-
missions to the commission because of
fears of union reprisals.
The second factor is the commission
decision to allow building workers the
4.1 percent national wage rise granted
in April this year despite their pursuit of
a superannuation deal outside the com-
mission. There is a strong view that this
is nothing more than a reworked ver-
sion of the building industry recovery
payment (BIRP) thrown out of the com-
mission a year ago as breaching the “no
extra claims” guidelines.
The third is the commission’s de-
cision last month to set minimum re-
dundancy conditions for workers in the
ACTU’s job protection case. Employers
say steep increases in labor on-costs re-
sulting from this decision will harm
business investment and employment.
According to NSW Employers’ Fed-
eration director Alan Jones, these “glib”
decisions by the commission have con-
tributed to a severe erosion of employer
confidence in the bench. He says em-
ployers, are bamboozled by their argu-
ments having no impact.
“Employers seem to have no voice,”
said Jones. “They seem fearful of ques-
tioning the Hawke economic analysis.
Employers are not prepared to have a
commission that’s just a lickspittle voice
of government.”
Commission president Sir John Moore: problems in choosing his successor
Professor Richard Blandy, econom-
ist and director of the National Institute
of Labor Studies at Adelaide’s Flinders
University, added weight to Jones’ criti-
cisms recently when Blandy issued a
strong attack on what he described as
the commission’s role as an enforcer for
the trade union movement. He
combined this with criticism of the job
protection decision, which he said had
“dealt a blow to the expectations of
Australia’s unemployed.”
According to Blandy, the present ar-
bitration system relies solely on the vol-
untary co-operation, goodwill and
economic understanding of the trade
union movement. Because of this, he ar-
gues, it is unlikely to endure in its pre-
sent form.
He said: “Decisions of the commis-
sion which transgress what is acceptable
to the unions cannot be enforced but
this is not true of decisions which are
unacceptable to employers. In effect, the
commission has become an enforce-
ment arm of policy acceptable to the
union movement. This is an extraordi-
nary degree of power to accord a sec-
tional interest group, even one as broad-
ly based as the trade union movement.”
To check whether employers and in-
deed Blandy are just whingeing or have
a genuine complaint at hand, it is neces-
sary to survey the commission’s be-
haviour over the past few years.
Wage indexation collapsed in July
1981 because of many pressures on the
system, not the least being strong resist-
ance from sections of the Fraser govern-
ment and Treasury to highly centralised
wage setting. In accordance with this
view, the commission agreed to a less
centralised system in the form of indus-
try-by-industry negotiations. The result
in wage rises and hours reductions
proved little short of disastrous for the
economy.
As one senior member of the bench
put it: “By the end of 1982 the agree-
ments which resulted alarmed every-
body, including the ACTU. In the corn-
mission there was apprehension of cre-
ating in 1982 the same terrible situation
as in 1974 when award rates rose 35 per-
cent for adult males against a consumer
price index (CPI) increase that year of
less than half that figure,
It was in this atmosphere, combined
with recession, that the commission
agreed to a six-month wage freeze for
private sector employees. (The govern-
ment had already legislated for a 12-
month wage freeze for public servants),
The decision was reached despite com-
mission president Sir John Moore s per-
sonal lack of confidence in the proposal
and noises from the ACTU that a wage
explosion would follow the end of the
freeze. The commission was, however,
acting in line with government econ-


MILTON WORDLEY
Professor Blandy: he sees the commission as a union “enforcer”
The ACTU’s Simon Crean: a champion of superannuation
omic policy a policy which had the
full backing of employers.
In the interim, employers and gov-
ernments at the new Labor regime’s
national economic summit agreed in
principal to return to a centralised wage
fixing system.
The prices and incomes accord,
negotiated between the ALP and the
ACTU over many years and endorsed
by federal unions, was to be the basis of
Labor’s economic policy. Full wage in-
dexation was said to be the key to the
accord holding together.
The wage freeze remained in place
until the national wage bench, headed
by Moore, handed down its decision in
September. The system it delivered was
six-monthly wage indexation on the
basis of CPI movements and condition-
al on unions signing and complying
with no-extra-claims agreements. Under
the principles set down in the decision,
a productivity case could not be held
until 1985 and applications for reduc-
tions of hours to below 38 hours would
not be heard. The system was to remain
at least until a review of the principles
in October next year.
Although some employers claim to
have been most surprised by this de-
cision, more regarded it as inevitable. It
was certainly not a very original de-
cision since it followed closely on the
submissions of the ACTU and the gov-
ernment. And, importantly for the em-
ployers, the bench agreed with their
submission that adjustments for CPI in-
creases should not be made automati-
cally. This allowed the commission to
remain in a position of power, with the
need for regular national wage hearings,
and allowed employers the right to ar-
gue incapacity to pay when it came to
altering individual awards.
The bench agreed with the employers
that building into a wage system expec-
tations which might not always be met,
as was the case in the 1975-81 indexa-
tion episode, could lead to a serious loss
of confidence in the system.
The decision also ensured a smooth
exit from the wage freeze. Said one
member of the commission: “The really
remarkable thing is that we emerged
from the wage freeze without a ripple.
All the cries of foreboding in December
1982 came to nothing because the end
came with a centralised wage structure
in place and a 4.3 percent wage rise.
With the immediate history of wage fix-
ing in this country in mind, there is no
room for argument for alternatives to
what the government is doing. There’s
no competition for the view that a
structured, centralised wage fixing sys-
tem is necessary.”
In its ruling, the bench said its de-
cision to give “prima facie full indexa-
tion” another try would be in the public
interest and also in the “expectation
that it would lead to a more stable in-
dustrial environment and that it would
provide the basis for a more rapid econ-
omic recovery than would occur in any
alternative system.” It listed the over-
whelming union commitment to the ac-
cord, described by Treasurer Paul
Keating as the basis of the government’s
prices and incomes policy and a major
anti-inflationary instrument, as a key
reason behind the decision.
The tight parameters set by the bench
reflected its knowledge that full indexa-
tion and everything else the unions
wanted could be economically disas-
trous. The strength of its wage prin-
ciples had been boosted substantially in
a 1982 decision of the High Court which
made plain that individual members of
the commission were bound to observe
principles set by national wage benches.
In September last year it seemed the
role the commission had chosen for it-
self was one of watchdog over economic
recovery, with the ACTU and the Labor
government as the policemen.
The first real test of this role came
when the commission was presented
with a two-year consent agreement in
the building industry. This involved im-
provements in allowances of around
$2O a week above indexation for Aus-
tralia’s 130,000 building workers. The
package was impeccable by industrial
relations standards and building unions
and employers were shocked when a
full bench, chaired by Justice Terry

Ludeke, rejected the lot. In his state-
ment, Ludeke said the commission’s
first priority was to safeguard the new
wage principles. As well as finding that
most of the building industry package
was in breach of these, the bench also
feared that a decision in favor of even
part of the deal would create a general
expectation of wage increase above in-
dexation in other industries.
In the first national wage hearing
after the re-introduction of indexation,
in April this year, the ACTU, the federal
government and state Labor govern-
ments argued for a 4.1 percent rise as
full compensation for September and
December quarter movements in the
CPI. Employers argued against the 4.1
percent on the grounds of the fragility
of the economy. They also argued that
there was a lack of commitment to the
wage principles. Evidence of this, they
said, was to be found in unions in the
food preserving and confectionary in-
dustries which had refused to give the
“no extra claims” undertaking required
by the system. But it was also to be
found in building and construction
unions’ claim for a superannuation
scheme for the industry, thought by
many to be just another version of the
rejected BIRP deal and thus in breach
of the principles.
In its decision, the wage bench
agreed with the employers’ submission
that the economic recovery was in its
infancy but found that it had been faster
than expected six months earlier. The
ACTU held its ground with the argu-
ment that the building union claim was
isolated to one industry and sought to
remove a situation in which a particular
group of workers was not entitled to an
employment benefit generally available
to other employees. The bench awarded
the 4.1 percent nationally.
It is understood that some employers
were so rankled by this decision that
they attempted to have the Confeder-
ation of Australian Industry, the peak
employer body, withdraw from the
Hancock inquiry its submission for a
continuation of the centralised system.
The opposition spokesman on In-
dustrial Relations, lan Macphee, be-
lieves the superannuation negotiations
constituted “a blatant circumvention”
of the commission’s guidelines. He said:
“It’s a pay rise by another name. I think
the decision was wrong and I can
understand employers losing confi-
dence in the system.”
Macphee, however, supports the
commission’s re-introduction of indexa-
tion under present circumstances:
“With the government and the ACTU
saying that not to grant indexation
would cause industrial disputes and
Alan Jones: Employers’ spokesman
undermine economic policy, it would
have been irresponsible to take another
course. But it should not have passed
the 4.1 percent on to building workers
so blithely.”
A leading employer said: “There’s a

The Liberals’ lan Macphee: critical
feeling developing in the community
that the commission is just doing what
the government wants. We are not con-
vinced that employers’ submissions
have so little merit that they should be
rejected so often. It would be unreal for
us to believe the commission should al-
ways endorse our views. But it is equally
unreal for the government.”
The ACTU, naturally enough, dis-
agrees with this viewpoint. Many of the
employer submissions, senior officials
argue, are inflexible and sometimes ir-
relevant. According to senior vice-presi-
dent Simon Crean, it is in the commis-
sion’s interests to promote the accord
because the social wage side of the
agreement provides the supportive
mechanisms necessary to maintain its
viability. Superannuation is one of the
items Crean listed as a supportive mech-
anism. This view is supported by a num-
ber of industrial relations academics
who believe lack of such supports was a
key reason for the failure of indexation
in 1981.
The commission’s decision in the job
protection case, handed down last
month, has united employer antagon-
ism to the bench. According to Alan
Jones, employers have never been so
vocal in their concerns as over this case.
The decision set minimum redundancy
standards for employers that they say
will undermine the business recovery,
especially in the shaky metals industry,
and that it will discourage employers
putting on extra workers. This is despite
the commission having agreed with
ACTU evidence that the cost of the
scheme would not add substantially to
the overall costs of labor. Jones rejects
as “balderdash” recent statements from
the government that labor on-costs here
have dropped to the level of the 19605.
“Employers now face the prospect of
improved profits being diminished by a
productivity case next year,” he said.
Employers, dismayed by union state-
ments about the decision being only a
minimum, are in the process of attempt-
ing to have the case reviewed. At the
time of the decision, Macphee argued
that such minimum standards were in-
evitable in a civilised society. He regret-
ted, however, that employers had not
made a genuine effort to have the costs
of the scheme minimised through offsets
such as a reduction in penalty rates,
youth wages and the annual leave
loading.
The attack by employers comes at a
crucial time for the commission, which
is on the verge of important changes.
The first of these is the retirement of
Moore when he turns 70 next year. The
second will consist of any changes
resulting from the report of the Han-
cock inquiry.
Although all the major submissions
argued for a continuation of a cen-
tralised system, several including
Moore’s argued a strong case for the
commission to be split into two bodies,

one dealing with wages and conditions
and disputes and the other with more
legalistic matters now handled by
judges of the Federal Court. It has long
been felt that these matters could be
more satisfactorily dealt with by lawyers
closer to industrial relations. For in-
stance, members of the commission
could be appointed to both the concilia-
tion body and its legal brother, the in-
dustrial court, which would deal with
matters such as applications for
deregistration of unions or unfair con-
tracts. Under this system, both bodies
would share the same president.
With indexation in place and an in-
quiry underway, it is fair to question
what there is to occupy members of the
commission (which has a budget alloca-
tion of more than $lO million for 1984-
85) in between national wage hearings.
But, despite unions signing “no extra
claims” agreements and the number of
working days lost through industrial
disputes being at its lowest for around
16 years, the 28 commissioners, 11
deputy presidents and president show
no evidence of idleness.
The law lists for the Arbitration
Commission reveal that commission
members are as busy as they were three
years ago. At the commission hearing
rooms in Queen’s Square, Sydney, com-
missioners heard 215 matters in 25 sit-
ting days in July three years ago, com-
pared with 192 matters over 22 sitting
days during July 1984.
An analysis of commission business
for 1982-83 shows that fewer than a
third of all matters before the commis-
sion were aimed at varying awards and,
of those, only half sought a variance of
wages. Others sought variations for con-
ditions of service, such as maternity
leave and safety provisions, or dealt
with matters such as demarcation dis-
putes and dismissals.
Choosing Moore’s successor poses
an especially difficult dilemma for the
government. Despite some manoeuvr-
ing over the appointment, Moore was
an obvious choice for the commission
presidency when Sir Richard Kirby re-
tired in 1973 Moore had served as
acting president since 1970, due to
Kirby’s ill-health. There is no one domi-
nant figure in the commission today
who would be acceptable to unions, em-
ployers and governments. The ACTU’s
view is that the new president should
come from outside the commission,
since no senior deputy president al-
ready on the bench is a strong enough
supporter of centralised wage fixing for
its liking. *
However, the short list for the job
appears at present to have been reduced
to six:
■ Justice Terry Ludeke, 61, a deputy
president of the commission and fourth
in seniority after Moore. Ludeke is re-
Justice Ludeke: his rejection of a consent agreement shocked the unions
nowned as a strongly independent and
controversial figure who favors substan-
tial restructuring of the commission to
develop a less centralised system. For-
merly counsel for the employers, he
would be an unpopular choice with the
ACTU.
■ Justice Jim Robinson, 58, second
in seniority after Moore, also a former
employers’ advocate and friend of
Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Unortho-
dox and intellectual, he would be ac-
ceptable to employers but not necessar-
ily to unions who remember him (with
Ludeke) as a member of the bench
whose decision to deliver only 80 per-
cent wage indexation, they believe,
played a part in the collapse of the orig-
inal system.
■ Justice Barry Maddern, 46, who
succeeded Robinson as employers’ ad-
vocate and is believed to be a favorite of
the Confederation of Australian Indus-
try and also of the government. There is
slight disquiet, however, that Maddern
may not have sufficient experience for
the job.
■ Professor Keith Hancock, 49, vice-
chancellor of Flinders University, chair-
man of the government’s inquiry into
industrial relations law and systems and
a member of the National Superannu-
ation Inquiry set up by the Whitlam
government in 1973. An economist,
Hancock has had a long interest in in-
dustrial relations and labor economics.
However, he lacks legal qualifications.
(Section 7 (1) of the Conciliation and
Arbitration Act stipulates that a presi-
dent of the commission must have five
years’ standing as a lawyer, so this
would have to be repealed for him to
succeed.)
■ Justice Trevor Olsson, 53, former
president of the South Australian In-
dustrial Commission and now a judge
of the Supreme Court there. He meets
the ACTU’s requirement for an out-
sider. In his submission to the Hancock
inquiry Olsson called for a restructuring
of the arbitration system that would see
state and federal levels moulded into
one commission with regional opera-
tions co-ordinated by one president.
■ Justice Bill Fisher, 58, president of
the NSW Industrial Commission, for-
mer judge of the NSW Supreme Court
and Sydney QC since 1971. A Labor
supporter, Fisher stood as a candidate
for the federal seats of Warringah and
Lowe in 1949 and 1972, respectively.
Two outside contenders are Arbitra-
tion Commission deputy president Jus-
tice Williams and the Minister for In-
dustry and Commerce, Senator John
Button. Williams, is regarded as an out-
sider because he is nearing retirement.
However, he could be the only present
commissioner the ACTU would con-
sider for the appointment.

Lawn bowls a

MELINDA WATTS bends to bowl,
eyes narrowing in concentration as she
seeks the jack at the end of the rink at
the Beverly Hills Bowling Club.
Behind her, whispering encourage-
ment, is Melinda’s 16-year-old twin sis-
ter, Deborah. Both of them, squinting
up the rink, pick out the white ping
pong bat that a club member has placed
behind the jack.
Both girls need it. For, like their eight
classmates who go to the club every
Tuesday afternoon, they are partially
blind.
Melinda and Deborah are members
of the growing army of NSW school-
children who are turning to lawn bowls.
The sport once derisively referred
to as a game for old men and women
is gaining popularity among the young.
It is played by 37 high schools through-
out the state and the numbers are grow-
ing a trend reflected in other states.
Two of the schools in the Sydney
metropolitan area are co-educational
Sir Joseph Banks High at Revesby and
Kingsgrove North High where Melinda
and Deborah are among the students in
the school’s Part Sighted Unit.
“It has been a wonderful opportu-
nity for these children to actively take
part in a sport,” says Anne Doyle, the
teacher in charge of the unit.
Sport was something which was pre-
viously denied them.
“Before, they used to sit around in
the library playing parlor games. They
felt totally disadvantaged.”
Now, Doyle says, they feel totally
involved.
So, too, are the members of the
Beverly Hills club. They pick the stu-
dents up by car each Tuesday after
lunch, take them to the club and return
them to the school. “They also lend us
their bowls and provide money to buy
trophies,” Doyle says.
“They also put on a carnival once a
year for blind bowlers.
“The Beverly Hills Bowling Club
members have been absolutely fabu-
lous.”
The involvement between the NSW
government, the Royal NSW Bowling
Association and the schools started
about a year ago when a special com-
mittee of representatives was set up.
One of its primary objectives was to in-
form executives of the 750 bowling
clubs throughout the state and masters
and mistresses in the 375 state and 250
Catholic high schools of the project.
“It took off,” says David Mollard,
recreation officer with the NSW Depart-
ment for Sport and Recreation, “like a
bomb.
“The Education department has now
officially recognised lawn bowls as a
school recreational sport and an in-
creasing number of competitors are be-
ing organised by individual schools
against other ones. It is a sport that is
not only coming out of the woodwork,
it’s charging out.”
Why has there been such a readiness
on the part of the students to accept
lawn bowls as a preferred sport? “For a
start, there are obviously students who
for various reasons can’t take part in
body contact pastimes,” Mollard says.
“Also, because of the incidence of in-
jury in body contact sport,
many of the parents are in
favor of it.
“Another reason is that the
kids have seen an increasing
number of younger people
throughout the world take up
lawn bowls and become
champions.
“And another reason is
that they recognise the degree
of technical expertise lawn
bowls requires and that gets
the youngsters in.”
If there is any irony in a
former champion footballer
championing the growing fol-
lowing of lawn bowls in NSW
Sport minister Michael Cleary
is prepared to accept the
good-natured banter.
Cleary recently handed
over a dozen video cassettes
on how to play bowls to fel-
low politician Rod Cavalier,
the minister for Education, at the
Gladesville Bowling Club. In a joking
aside to Cleary that lawn bowls was a
sport that required a degree of intelli-
gence, Cavalier said more seriously that
he could envisage the day when high
school children throughout the state
would play bowls.
Cleary, equally as seriously, agreed.
“There is no doubt,” he said on that oc-
casion, “that this growing popularity
among youngsters will greatly enhance
the game of bowls and our champions
are obviously going to become younger
and younger.”
Totally in agreement with that senti-
ment is Phil Hafey, the music master at
Sir Joseph Banks High. He and 16 stu-
dents go every Tuesday afternoon to the
Revesby Bowling Club where they, too,
receive full co-operation and encour-
agement from members.
Hafey, a qualified soccer referee,
involved himself enthusiastically with
the scheme from its introduction. “I
thought it might be a good idea to try
something different so I went down
to give it a go with the kids,” he says.
“This year, our school had eight stu-
dents in the State Bowls Association
pairs and one pair got through to the
sectional final at Revesby.”
What, then, has been the reaction of
other students to their fellows opting for
lawn bowls in preference to the more
vigorous sports do they give their
mates a ribbing? “They used to when we
first started,” Hafey admits. “But some
of our kids playing bowls are also
combined High School hockey players
and others still play open rugby league.
Others run 52 minutes in the annual
City to Surf.
“Yes,” he says, “we had to put up
with a bit at first. “Not” he adds, with
satisfaction, “now.” □

EDUCATION
Opportunities more equal than others
Pupils at work in a NSW government school: conclusions disputed
By GEOFFREY PARTINGTON*
T. R. DUNN, an American visiting
Melbourne University, in 1982 reported
research which has greatly excited rad-
ical academics in Australia. Dunn com-
pared the results of university entrants
in Victoria with their Higher School
Certificate (HSC) results in 1975, 1976
and 1978 and found that students from
government schools subsequently made
greater scholastic progress on average
than did those from non-government
schools. This finding was in line with
British research of the 60s which
showed that state school entrants into
universities obtained significantly better
degrees on average than did public
school entrants with the same grade in
the advanced level of the General Cer-
tificate of Education.
On the basis of his correct empirical
calculations, Dunn made two absurd
conclusions. The first was that students
in Victoria’s non-government schools
were “over-taught” (although “under-
teaching” in the government schools
was just as likely). The second was that
his findings indicated bias in the HSC
examinations, in university selection or
in both.
To compensate for this alleged bias,
Dunn proposed that every government
school candidate however affluent
should receive extra marks compared
with every non-government school can-
didate, however penurious. The loading
would vary, according to faculty returns
over the previous few years.
All Dunn really confirmed was that,
in any population admitted to a course
or to an activity with an equal level of
achievement, those who have received
inferior preparation will on average
subsequently out-perform those who
have been well prepared. This would be
the case in chess, cricket or ballet.
Far more candidates who were well
prepared would, of course, reach a high
standard at entry compared with the
badly prepared and to claim that bad or
inadequate preparation for any activity
was somehow “better” than good or ad-
equate preparation would be utter ab-
surdity. This absurd conclusion is
widely held, however.
Mr Van Davy, president of the Aus-
tralian Teachers’ Federation, spent most
of his (and my) time in an ABC tele-
vision Pressure Point program in loudly
asserting that Dunn’s research which
I had not come across at the time (it is
not of special merit or widespread
fame) proved that the government
schools of Victoria and probably of the
rest of Australia were better academi-
cally than their rivals.
Dunn and Davy even fail to under-
stand that the same phenomenon: su-
perior subsequent performance, once
equal learning conditions are provided,
by students who have suffered from
poor teaching compared with those who
have benefited from good, applies even
more within each schooling system than
between systems.
If we take HSC students in Victoria
who gain, say, between 400 and 420
marks of a possible 500, we shall find
that those who have attended the most
efficient state high schools will perform
less well at university than those who
have attended the least efficient once
they all enjoy the same standard of
teaching.
The logic of the Dunn and Davy the-
sis would be that all government schools
are less efficient than all non-govern-
ment schools, which they do not believe
and which certainly is untrue.
The argument that differences be-
tween the later achievement levels of
groups should be a reason for adjusting

entry requirements to courses is one
fraught with dangers for radicals them-
selves, especially for feminists. The
drop-out rate for women in higher edu-
cation is higher than for men, while re-
gression analysis of the type used by
Dunn shows that women on average
achieve less at graduation and men
more than their entry scores would have
indicated. This tendency led Michael
Levin, the hammer of the American
feminists, to propose a higher admission
score for women than for men in
courses (such as Medicine) which were
pursued less for personal cultivation
than for the advantage of society. I
would resist Levin’s claims, on the
ground that overall group differences
ought not determine the selection
chances of individuals, but his argu-
ments are at least more cogent than
those of Dunn and Davy.
If one really wished to compensate
university applicants who had received
a poor education, it would be necessary
first to classify all schools according to
their educational standard and to
handicap students from schools other
than the least efficient. This would be a
very invidious and divisive exercise.
Many parents would furthermore, while
no doubt ensuring some private coach-
ing during the critical period, seek an
advantage for their children by moving
them toward the end of Year 12 to those
high schools in receipt of the largest
boost of marks on the basis of past
ghastliness. Abuse without end surely
would result from any fiddling with
actual marks gained by an individual
student.
Equalisation by adjusting marks has
just received the blessing of Hugh Hud-
son, a former Labor politician in South
Australia who is in charge of the Com-
monwealth Tertiary Education Com-
mission.
Hudson is a convert to the doctrines
of affirmative action, reverse discrimi-
nation and quotas which so delight fed-
eral Education minister Senator Susan
Ryan and Dr Anne Summers, head of
the Office of the Status of Women.
Hudson believes that, for instance,
every girl who takes Maths in HSC
should gain extra marks because girls
are in a minority among the candidates.
He would not, of course, dare advocate
the equally preposterous proposition
that every boy who takes a foreign lan-
guage should receive an equivalent
marks bonus although boys are in a
comparable minority there.
Hudson also believes that the way to
overcome what he holds to be excessive-
ly poor educational attainment in some
groups, such as Aborigines, is to give
them all extra marks because of the
color of their skins.
The United States is just recovering
from the worst onslaught of racism in
reverse. One case which highlighted its
absurdities was that of a white male
who, because of the quota system,’was
denied admission to the Harvard Medi-
cal School in favor of blacks with much
lower marks.
In Czarist Russia, a numerus clausus
operated to keep Jews out of the uni-
versities in the numbers to which their
individual talents entitled them (some
Soviet-watchers claim that an informal
version still persists).
In Australia today, not only Jews but
also Chinese, Germans and Dutch Aus-
tralians all are excessively represented
in what Hudson terms the “more
affluent groups in the community”
whose children have “about three
times” the likelihood of entering univer-
sity than of children from “dis-
advantaged groups.” Similar dis-
crepancies exist between other groups
such as the children of two-parent, com-
pared with single-parent, families,

advantage I have devised for handicap-
pers of university entrants may come to
pass, since I have learned that satire is a

The Reagan government established
a National Commission on Excellence
in Education in the US in 1981 to try to
combat a 20-year decline in national av-
erages on the Scholastic Attainment
Test. For the first time since the Pilgrim
Fathers, an American generation was
growing up worse educated than its im-
mediate predecessor. Under the title A
Nation At Risk: The Imperative For Edu-
cation Reform, that commission de-
nounced the “rising tide of mediocrity”
in American education and proposed
major reforms to counter indiscipline,
sloppiness and displaced priorities.
Some 35 states have provided signifi-
cant evidence that the decline has been
arrested, new hope given to students
and greater self-respect to teachers.
Sir Keith Joseph, UK Secretary of
State for Education and Science, called
in similiar vein last January for a “bold,
ambitious ... but realistic” effort to
raise levels of educational achievement
in England and Wales. He urged educa-
tors to plan ways in which 50 percent of
all pupils could be brought to the stan-
dard (five or more subjects in the Ordi-
nary Level of the General Certificate of
Education at the age of 16) which had
been achieved by only 20 percent and
ways in which 80 to 90 percent could be
brought to the standard (five passes at
Grade 4 or above in the Certificate of
Secondary Education at the age of 16)
achieved by only 50 percent.
The US and UK have a conscious-
ness of the technological weakness sym-
bolised by failure to meet the challenge;
the rhetoric of equal educational oppor-
tunity is seen in both to be hollow unless
students enjoy a calm atmosphere for
learning, efficient teaching and ad-
equate initiation into the central and
most significant forms of knowledge.
Australian education has been and
continues to be assailed by a tide of me-
diocrity as powerful as that which
thoughtful American and British lead-
ers are seeking to resist and to reverse.

In Australia, though, our leaders pro-
pose to weaken the few defences which
protect educational achievement.
The Participation and Equity Pro-
gram, the main educational innovation
of the present government, will further
erode the intellectual standards of Aus-
tralian schools. Its authors, the members
of the Commonwealth Schools Com-
mission, tell us in their folly that any
comparisons “drawn by opinion leaders
and the media between different types
of school” are “artificial contrasts”; no
non-academic programs are to be de-
scribed as “non-academic” because this
means that “they are often implicitly
represented as sub-standard by the use
of this terminology” push penny is
really as valuable as poetry and person-
al decision-making as good as Physics.
The program opposes “accreditation
and credentialling procedures devel-
oped as tertiary education criteria”
since these “can be a barrier to curricu-
lum renewal and, in turn, to higher par-
ticipation and equity in education. As-
sessment, credentialling procedures act
to discourage many students from post-
compulsory education both at school
and beyond.” We should all pass; all
should win the race, including those
who refused to enter.
Demanding that students actually
know anything “can not only inhibit
curriculum change and school organisa-
tion but can even influence methods of
teaching and learning, placing a pre-
mium on teacher-centred lecture-type
instruction.”
The people who control Australian
education might well get away with this
nonsense but they confess that “another
problem related to assessment in senior
secondary education is the willingness
of the community at large and em-
ployers and parents in particular to
equate successful completion of second-
ary education with scores in examin-
ations or related end-of-school assess-
ment procedures designed for the
narrower and more specific purpose of
tertiary entrance.” Most of us in the
community at large and employers
and parents in particular are indeed a
problem for our leaders.
The Commonwealth Schools Com-
mission claims that its objective is “to
encourage the majority of young people
to complete the equivalent of a full sec-
ondary education.” Their main pur-
pose, alas, is simply to keep more young
people in school irrespective of what
they are learning for the sake of the
education industry.
The tell-tale phrase is “the equivalent
of’ a fully secondary education. With
the addition of the mark adjustment
schemes devised by Dunn, Van Davy or
Hudson, the Participation and Equity
Program is a recipe for education disas-
ter in Australia. □

THE TRUE BtAITTY Of A MAZDA E THAT
Ask a jogger about his shoes, and
he’ll tell you they have to be light but
durable, cushioned but supportive. That is,
a runner’s footgear must be comfortable
as well as functional the recipe for
enjoyable hours on hard pavement.
At Mazda, we’re faced with much
the same sort of challenge in human
engineering: to design a car that is
not only completely functional
but utterly comfortable.
A car like our
Now Mazda 323.

Handling that’s tight, yet a ride
that’s right
The driving force behind the
original 323 was, quite simply, to
put the fun back in driving. To satisfy
demands for fuel efficiency, yet
build a car that would make
drivers want to take to
the road.
This resolve
confronted us
; with many
challenges,
including a
balance of
ride and
handling
no slight


lausvHUNYHiigmasjDMHSJj
feat since a supple ride and taut
handling were generally thought
contradictory design principles.
Our solution to this seeming
paradox was Mazda’s patented TTL
(Twin Trapezoidal Link) rear
suspension, an advanced system
that not only ensures a compliant
ride but increases stability. With twin
links slightly out of parallel, this
configuration counteracts the natural
tendency of the wheels to toe-out
during cornering or sudden braking.
Put to the test in the 1983 IMSA
(International
Motor Sports
Association)
0
Series, the TTL
design helped
the Now 323 to collect
the Rally Sport Manufac-
turer’s trophy. Straightening
out curves while absorbing
shocks, the configuration assured
the riding comfort essential to days
and nights of intense rally driving.
Evolution is the solution
The standard that wrought the
original 323’s comfort was an
exacting one: to accommodate four
adults along with their luggage and
make even long-distance travel
relaxing and enjoyable. But we
asked even more of ourselves.
We sought to build on the
original 323’s achievements to
design an even more satisfying
machine, the Now Mazda 323.
A greater balance
One key to this demanding
goal was a still greater balance of
handling and riding comfort a
challenge that prodded us to
reconsider both the suspension
and seating since these two factors
inevitably affect each other.
Particular attention was paid to
the suspension system, especially
the tuning characteristics of the
at
r
r.
dampers, springs and bushings.
And testing on the seat design
spanned three continents as we
sought the optimum size and
shape. For maximum support and
comfort kilometre after kilometre,
the urethane padding’s density,
location, rigidity, damping
characteristics and shape were a
focal point.
Utility and the interior
environment were also re-evaluated
as we brought the Mazda tradition
of functional aesthetics to bear —an
approach that is evident in touches
such as the GT’s continuous front
and rear trim with built-in armrests.
Driving closer to perfection
The features that have
established the Now Mazda 323’s
new level of comfort aren’t
elements that can be just tacked
on; they take time, patience and a
lot of care.
This painstaking process of
refinement is evident throughout
the whole Mazda system, from
research and development to
assembly. So that we can be sure
that all of our cars have everything
you want. And more.
More than a responsibility, this
is our commitment to today’s
drivers.

‘Our agent in Los Angeles can easily

That was
most welcome
news for me.
The truth is I had been a little nervous
about setting up such a meeting. I had
imagined having to make a number
of phone calls and quite possibly a lot
of wasted time. After all, Los Angeles
is a big city and, as an individual,
I could hardly expect a big reception.
So what a relief it was when my
ANZ Business Travel consultant took
the whole problem off my hands and
turned a potential ‘Sorry too busy’
into a ‘Welcome to LA for me.
It was fantastic to find that ANZ’s
Travel Conference and Group Travel

meetings, seminars or trade tours -
tailor-made to your specifications.
At ANZ Travel they understand
the needs of the business traveller.
They look after all the usual travel
arrangements, things like passports,
visas, foreign currency and the
regular accommodation needs.
But they also think further ahead and
make the extra effort to eliminate the
little problems that can needlessly
occur. Their aim is to give business

Zippety-doo, aargh!
RON SAW
NEVER mind about your
Mix’n Matches, which are
said to be Thrilling this year,
or your Dirndls, which are
Back, or even your Pinstriped
Overalls for Women, which
are New ... the important
fashion news is that Fly-But-
tons are Still Here and are
possibly even Coming Back.
There is, then, a Threat. It
shrinks the soul.
The facts were given to me
by none other than J. H. L.
Cutler, the distinguished be-
spoke tailor of Sydney. Last
week he assured me, inter alia ,
that a couple of dozen of his
customers insisted on having
their flies Buttoned, not
Zipped; and their numbers
were growing, he said, for
very good reasons.
Inevitably he mentioned
the plight of the gentleman
whose zipper, suddenly and in-
explicably, closes only half the fly,
usually the upper half; the embarrass-
ment often the shrieks of the man
whose zipper gets caught in his shirt or
drawers, or worse.
He quoted the case of the dis-
tinguished conductor who always liked
to Go before mounting the podium. A
busted zipper could result in smirks and
leers all the way from the fiddles to the
French horns during the performance
and in indelicate howls of laughter from
the stalls when he took his bows.
A jammed or broken zipper could
mean full frontal exposure and grave
trauma; but a missing button, or even
three or four, was neither here nor there.
Draughty, perhaps, but not indecent.
I suppose he’s right, but I don’t want
to hear about it. I was marked for life by
fly-buttons.
No matter how careful you were
there always seemed to be one left un-
done, not just in the pub but at your
school dancing class or your amateur
theatricals, and few sights were more
humiliating. I can’t think why. An un-
done fly-button was no more than an
undone fly-button. You could rim it
with rhinestones or paint it with Day-
Glo and it was no less unremarkable.
But the easiest way to wreck the
peace of mind of an after-dinner
speaker or an actor it was a favorite
stage trick was to whisper, sotto voce,
“Flybuttonundone” or “You’vegotta-
medal.”
The result was that the poor swine
would try to hide himself behind his
menu or the epergne or sidle idiotically
behind the juvenile lead.
The only people who managed their
fly-buttons with composure nay, elan
- were the French; and that, surely, was
because they had so many of the damn
things.
The average French trousers fitted
snugly under the armpits and needed
between 20 and 30 fly-buttons. And the
Frenchman, because he actually en-
joyed them they were, I rather fancy,
a forerunner of worry beads used
every one of them as often as possible.
The Frenchman approaching and
leaving the sidewalk pissoir was a sight
no tourist should have, could have,
missed. He began unbuttoning, starting
about the breastbone, at least 100 m be-
fore he arrived; and he was still button-
ing-up, sometimes even polishing the
buttons, two or three blocks after he left.
His care was prudent: one protrud-
ing fly-button had the catching and
holding qualities of a shark-hook.
I once saw an elderly and dis-
tinguished editor catch a fly-button in
the space bar of his typewriter. His lead-
er, a thoughtful piece on the state of the
stock market, was confused with
xxxcons///prefszzall ordsnnnzz before
he burst free; and his typewriter, prob-
ably choked with a plastic button and a
piece of stout Donegal tweed, never
worked properly again.
As well as accidents there was the
deliberate frightfulness of the
schoolboy sport of fly-ripping
in which one well-timed
swipe unbuttoned the unwary
from belt-buckle to indecen-
cy.
A really deft fly-ripper,
moving swiftly in a crowd,
could rip a dozen flies in as
many seconds; and with poor
quality wartime threads, or
enough brand-new, tight but-
, ton-holes, buttons rattled
around classrooms like shot at
a duck-hunt.
I remember the relief with
which I wore my first pair of
zippered trousers and the
gloomy frustration of our
school’s champion fly-ripper,
a boy named Labster, or pos-
sibly Prawne.
That, the frustration, was
understandable: his was a re-
markable gift.
He once “got” no less than six sixth-
formers who, trying to look blase and
immaculate, stood in a stag line at the
Prefects’ Ball.
As a sergeant in the cadet corps he
ripped the flies of every boy in the front
rank of his platoon as they stood
defencelessly at attention and encum-
bered with firearms at the high port.
And he was threatened with expul-
sion when he got two house-masters
who passed him in the dark. The last
time I saw Labster he told me that his
swipe had been both automatic and, in
its way, pragmatic: there were male per-
sons, you ripped their flies what else?
I don’t suppose that adults would
have much to lose from the reintroduc-
tion of buttoned flies. I don’t recall ever
having seen grown men ripping away,
though crowded pubs and trains and
ferries would offer all kinds of tempta-
tion. But even if they didn’t, even were
the law in regard to indecency widened
to protect flies, fly-ripping, inevitably,
would become, again, a popular sport
for the young; and the young are
entitled to protection.
So, indeed, are people like Mr
Cutler’s conductor.
There can be no less damage to the
mind of a child with his loins laid bare
than to that of a man on view in white
tie and weskit, tails and a length of
white shirt hanging out of his fly.
All things considered it might be best
to do away with both forms of fastening
and examine the case for the kilt. □


A demagogue to manipulate dark prejudice
PHILLIP ADAMS
IT SOMETIMES seems that most
characteristic of Australian sounds, the
slap of the thong, is destined to be
replaced by the thud of the jackboot. As
The Bulletin’s recent cover story on the
New Right reminded us, the forces of
reaction seem to be gaining strength. So
I do not know whether to take solace or
alarm in the fact that things are decided-
ly worse in the United States and, lately,
in France.
Meet Monsieur Jean Marie Le Pen,
leader of the French National Front. In
a very short time, Le Pen has established
himself as a major threat to both liberal-
ism and democracy.
The French have, of course, a proud
anti-Semitic tradition pre-dating war-
time collaboration with the nazis and
symbolised in the Dreyfus affair. Le Pen
shows an alarming ability to
manipulate such dark preju-
dice.
Le Pen is literally (as well
as metaphorically) one-eyed,
as a result of a right-wing fac-
tion fight. (He has only recent-
ly replaced his raffish eye-
patch with a glass eye.)
Having started his political
career bashing communists in
the Latin Quarter, he
sharpened his military skills
with the French army in Indo-
china before fighting with the
paratroopers in Algeria. And,
despite his angry denials,
journalists keep dredging up a
story about Lieutenant Le Pen
torturing a 19-year-old Arab
youth by “attaching wires to
the lobes of his ears and per-
sonally turning a hand-driven
generator.”
Now Le Pen tortures lib-
erals with demands for capital
punishment, for a total ban on
abortion and for strong action
to “discourage” homosexu-
ality.
Just as the League of
Rights’ Eric Butler sells pro-
nazi material at his bookshop,
Le Pen’s backers include
notorious neo-nazis and he
owned until recently, a com-
pany which issued recordings
of nazi songs. On the record
covers, Hitler’s ascendency
was remembered as “a power-
ful, popular and democratic
mass-movement which tri-
umphed at the ballot box.”
Now Le Pen is calling for the repatri-
ation of all immigrants. One of his most
popular slogans is “Two million immi-
grants equals two million unemployed.”
All in all you have the sort of dema-
gogue that could unite and ignite the
growing number of angry, alienated
voters looking for scapegoats. There is
growing evidence that Le Pen may rep-
resent a major threat to Mitterrand.
So far, the New and Old Rights in
Australia have failed to come up with
an acceptable local demagogue but I
sometimes fear that Geoffrey Blainey’s
enthusiastic lamp-rubbing just might re-
lease a genie which could appeal to a
coalition of the angry and the ignorant.
AS RECENT revelations remind us,
you will find heroin addicts in the
Jean Marie Le Pen: a major threat to President Mitterrand
GAMMA
homes of the socially prominent. But
globally heroin remains foremost a
problem of the ghettos, a symptom
more of social than personal despair.
This is demonstrated by the fact that,
in Vietnam, almost one half of the Gls
used heroin with 20 percent believing
themselves to be addicted. But careful
follow-up studies showed that only 7
percent of Gls stayed on heroin on their
return to the United States, with only 1
percent feeling themselves addicted. In
other words, they used heroin because
they were in a set of circumstances that
they understandably loathed. Once re-
moved from that nightmare, the need to
escape even at the cost of self-destruc-
tion largely disappeared. In contrast,
the street addicts of the US, Britain and
Australia remain trapped in their cir-
cumstances.
It is impossible to stop the
traffic in heroin. The chances
of being caught by Customs
grow ever smaller Take
Heathrow, London, as an
example: until 1968, everyone
was stopped by Customs. This
was reduced to one-third and
is now at a level of 1 percent,
falling to 0.4 percent at peak
hour.
The only way to reduce ad-
diction is to increase opti-
mism to show people they
can escape from their night-
mares, from their alienation.
What is required are not
harsher laws for pushers or in-
creased Methadone programs
but fundamental work at so-
cial and political levels. As
English journalist Jock Young
puts it: “We must present
young people with the hope
that they can change their cir-
cumstances and involve them
in the process of that change.”
To keep talking about her-
oin addiction as a death sen-
tence is to compound the
helplessness of the addicts,
their friends and relatives.
We can escape from heroin
addiction and from the ad-
diction to nuclear weapons,
for that matter if we can
convince ourselves that hope
persists. Otherwise, we yield
to that most dangerous of
isms, the one currently
i embraced by both capitalism
and communism: Fatalism. □

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
How to survive until December 2
ACTUALLY, I DON’T know whether I
can face it right up to December 1. It
was very cruel of the Prime Minister to
give us an eight-week campaign. Al-
ready I suffer from a disease called
Printophobia, best described as fear of
headlines. When I see large headlines
my eye tends to skirt right round with-
out reading them.
There are some simple rules when I
pick up the paper. I don’t read any
stories about murder and mayhem.
Never read about Princess Diana, Prin-
cess Anne, Princess Caroline, the diets
of Prince Charles and, frankly, young
Harry is wearing pretty thin.
I don’t read stories about pop stars,
regurgitations about Marilyn Monroe,
John Wayne or Yoko Lennon. I allow
myself to skip tales about beauty
queens, bingo and lottery triumphs and
the whole vast acreage of football. Tales
of gigantic superannuation payments to
MPs and senior public servants also
make me nervous. You would be sur-
prised how little is left over.
Now, I am getting to the stage where
politics has to be added to the list. I
can’t stand it much longer. Do you re-
alise this is the eighth federal election
since 1970. It is our 38th since feder-
ation. Good grief, we have suffered one
almost every second year.
But wait a minute. It’s much worse
than that. One appreciates we are fortu-
nate to be democratic and have elec-
tions at all, but look here. We have six
regular state parliaments, a legislature
in the Northern Territory and the Aus-
tralian Capital Territory, plus the feder-
al parliament. That’s nine altogether.
You can take it for granted that at any
one time there is an election going on
somewhere in Australia.
It is the one beautiful growth indus-
try. We employ more politicians than
any country on earth always there is
somebody trying, promising, pleading
for your favors, Nor are we slipping
backwards. After this election the
House of Representatives will have a
bigger cast than Ben Hur.
This election clearly is establishing a
record. We had Andrew Peacock cam-
paigning for six weeks even before the
election date. The Liberal Party spent
half' a million dollars on ads during
which time Peacock’s rating dropped
from 34 to 22 percent. D’Arcy,
MacManus and Masius no doubt would
argue that the ads were very worthwhile.
But for them his rating might have
dropped to 2 percent.
We have been told that the Austra-
lian Labor Party is spending five million
dollars on its advertising campaign. The
Liberals and the Nationals will have to
at least match that to say nothing of the
Democrats. Just to give you some idea
how your senses get assaulted, during
the 1975 campaign the Liberal coalition
plus the ALP bought a total of 663 hours
of radio and Television time. Now with
the longer campaign we will get more.
We are at the mercy of these people.
Back in the glorious days before tele-
vision and radio it was so easy to avoid
politicians. They used to do their cam-
paigning in meeting halls or they had to
physically knock on your door. You
could make up your own mind whether
to let them in or not.
Because we saw so little of them we
looked upon them with respect, even
awe, and the newspapers reported every
word they said in parliament. It was as-
tonishing the number we cast in bronze
and placed in parks. We never do that
any more.
My theory is this, we would like our
politicians more and our electoral
judgment would be infinitely more
sound if we saw, read and heard much
less of them. If Peacock had kept out of
sight for the past two years very likely
his approval rating would be around 90
percent.
From here on politics will be solid on
Four Corners, Nationwide, Willesee, AM,
the National Today Show, the lot. What
you really need is a survival kit which
might prevent your brain being turned
to pulp before December 1.
Mail: Be careful. Your letter box will
be stacked. A handy tip is to turf every-
thing into the rubbish bin that doesn’t
carry a stamp.
Television: There are policy speeches
coming right through from 6 pm to 9
pm. Your best bet is to stick to 0-28 and
go for programs such as International
Cabaret, the Russians and Their People,
Yugoslav movies.
Radio: Very tricky. Scatter political
messages go on all day. I think you are
fairly safe if you tune in to the ABC’s
meditation at 11 pm. ABC FM is re-
markably secure. There is usually a fine
Bach Cantata to be had after 7 pm.
Newspapers: No hope at all. Start
reading them gingerly from the back.
Movies: An excellent form of escape.
Could one suggest almost anything
rated R or X. You rarely get any politics
in good clean pornography.
But people will be your biggest prob-
lem. Even in unlikely places such as the
supermarket, Bible reading discussions
or aerobic dance class, they will throw
politics at you.
The only hope is to throw in a totally
alien subject:
Do you think the RSL is riddled with
CIA perverts?
Would it be a good idea to elevate
Neville Wran to the High Court?
Do you find fluoride in the water
good for your sex life?
Would the Pope make a good Pres-
byterian?
Should ABC homosexuals be
required to get married before they re-
ceive benefits?
If circuses should be banned as cruel
to animals, then shouldn’t horse racing
be banned also? The Queen’s stud could
be sold off to start a fund for dis-
advantaged corgis.
Isn’t it time that one of our Royals
took a black spouse to improve Com-
monwealth relations?
Do both football and boxing pulp
the mind?
Paste this survival kit on your re-
frigerator and use it during all emergen-
cies during coming weeks. □

In the gloomier Pecksnifferies of the
parliaments of Victoria and New South
Wales it was being claimed that “the
failure of the R-rated Bo Derek movie,
Bolero" was due to the message spread
recently on the tour of the distinguished
British wowser, Mary Whitehouse. In
London the more likely reason that,
R, X, Y or Z-rated, it was just a lousy
movie came from the office of ...
Mary Whitehouse.
The Windies like to relax after a hard
day’s cricket; and judging by the way
Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards and the team
razzed Big Bird Joel Garner at a press
conference on their arrival in Sydney,
Garner is some player off the field as
well. Garner, looking spaced out after a
32-hour flight from London, said it was
all lies and that the team singled out
somebody new to tease each year. Team
manager Wes Hall, the mach-1 bowler
who is now senator, doesn’t issue ulti-
matums about being home by midnight.
“Fitness is the aim,” says Hall. “I sup-
pose booze is the worst offender and
you know it yourself next day about
3pm when it’s hot out there. I don’t
think women affect your performance. I
say limit yourself to one and make it
early.”
A few miles off Jervis Bay, a newsman
named Gary O’Neill was being flying-
foxed between two RAN warships,
watched by a prime minister named
Hawke: the self-same Hawke who, in a
cricket match a few days earlier, had
allowed himself to be hit in the eye by a
ball bowled by O’Neill. And the PM
was quoted as telling O’Neill: “Now
they’ll be calling you Lipton’s.” What
on earth, you ask, did that mean? Well,
when the line goes slack, in the afore-
mentioned exercise, the passenger tends
to get dunked; and in the navy it’s
called tea-bagging. So . . . Bushell’s
Twining’s, Kinkara, Harris, Lipton’s ...
There was a time when the very whiff of
royal blood would have brought all but
the most dogged republicans into the
streets, beating their breasts and waving
tiny Union Jacks; a time when a hint of
the proximity of Phillipses would have
caused excited whinnying, neighing and
lashing of hooves. These days the nation
is blase. A Sydney public-relations firm
now advises that Capt Mark Phillips,
who is in Australia nearly as often as
he’s in the UK, will be here again this
month. Possibly it has something to do
with the fact that he will open a Jaguar-
Rover dealership in Homebush, NSW.


The Bishop of Durham’s reference to
British Coal Board supremo, lan
McGregor, 72, as an “old, clapped-out
American” has raised the ire of Sheila
McGregor, of the Clan McGregor So-
ciety, who says: “The members of this
tribe are renowned for their longevity
and personal vigor. They don’t die off
that easily.” With so many McGregors
living on into their 80s and 90s, the so-
ciety has decided, cannily, to stop life
membership.
At a New York City Friars Club tribute
to Dean Martin, Lucille Ball recalled the
night when it was her turn to be roasted
by the Friars. The dinners had always
been so raunchy that women had never
been invited. So all hands were urged to
tone down their language and Johnny
Carson promised to do so. “Ladies and
gentlemen,” he began, “what a thrill it is
to present Miss Lucille Testicle.”
The UK Arts Council, whose chairman
is ex-Times editor William Rees-Mogg,
has banned dogs from its premises since
an employee was bitten by one. The ban
has upset the council’s literature direc-
tor, Australian Charles Osborne, who
was in the habit of taking his dog, Asta,
to work. “It’s very unfair,” he growled.
“Everyone loved Asta. He was known
as William Rees-Dogg because of his
impeccable manners.”
The Mater the Mater Misericordiae
hospital on Sydney’s north side which
was dumped in 1982 for reasons appar-
ent to few but members of the govern-
ment of Nifty Neville Wran now has a
band of 25 charity workers who call
themselves The Mater Lives Committee.
They too, will need to live and work:
the hospital, under chief executive offi-
cer Sr Maureen Gleeson, plans a $17.5
million upgrading program and it’s un-
likely that more than half of that
amount will be raised by a ball at the
Regent Hotel on October 27, for tickets
are a piddling $4O a head. We may have
found a way to publicise this splendid
effort had not Rowena Hennessy an-
nounced, in a press handout, that she is
chairperson of the committee. Angels
defend us! Chairman ... it was good
enough for Mrs Kath Anderson when
she ran the Sydney County Council.
Chairwoman ... well, OK. But chairper-
son ugh! is rather like huntsperson
or black single spider, or grey para-
medic shark. Next it will be Pater or
Person Misericordiae; and unless some-
thing can be done to maybe stop this rot
we may find it difficult to mention the

OM A CLEAR DAY
YOU CAN MOW
SEE THE CITY


Just ten short years ago, our cities
were literally choking in the outflows
of our waste.
The smell and look of industrial
and vehicle smog hid the rise and fall of
the sun.
Yet it is clearer today, than it has been
for decades.
Why?
A groundswell of public opinion has
made for a cleaner, though not yet perfect,
Sydney. It has caused the establishment of the
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Demanded
a second thought about how Australia uses its
rain forests. And caused the first appearance
of the bream fish in Melbourne’s
Yarra River in 50 years.
Public opinion can move
mountains, it can move governments
- and it can kill products that are
packaged without reflecting the
community concern.
Who would have dreamed just a
few short years ago, that community
concern for the environment would
become a product attribute or
detriment for your favourite beer or
soft drink packaging.
Yet there is now clear proof of
where our community wants to go.
And it is a startling message
to all businesses perceptive enough
to recognise it.
Today, the environment is everyone’s
business.
Products and the packaging of those
products must not only satisfy traditional
demands but also satisfy the growing concern
for environmental responsibility.
And while packaging has been, and will
remain a focus of environmental consideration,
no form of packaging has answered the
concerns as has the Aluminium Can.
Nowhere has such a visible and effective
recycling programme succeeded like the
Aluminium Can Recycling Programme.
Currently in Australia Aluminium Cans
achieve around a 55% return rate, and in New
South Wales, in particular, the return rate on
Aluminium Cans has reached around a
staggering 67%.

Horror of
the 80s:
the death
march of
the child
soldiers
The use of children in
battlefields, as these graphic
pictures show, stands as mute
testimony to the shallowness
of the veneer of civilisation in
the 20th century.
THOUSANDS and thousands of
children in many parts of the
world are doing military service
mainly in Third World wars.
Nominally they are “volun-
teers.” In fact, they are pressed
into soldiering by all sorts of liber-
ation and resistance movements.
Though often smaller than the
weapons they carry, these
“fighters” are given almost every
military chore, including those
normally carried out by elite shock
troops.
At the start the young soldiers
can be excellent and enthusiastic
partisan fighters. Their command-
ers have every reason to be proud
of them. They hardly ever hesitate
to obey the most outrageous or-
ders, they never consider the pos-
sible wider consequences .of their
actions. Their inexperience of life
partly explains their high degree of
fearlessness and their almost unbe-

lievable cruelty. Because their own
minds are still underdeveloped
they become compliant uniformed
puppets of their commanders.
Child soldiers are robbed of the
chance to gradually develop their
own personalities in an
atmosphere of peaceful normality.
Instead, they become killers
trained to consider the horrors of
war and civil war as normal and
unavoidable phenomena of the
human existence.
In many parts of the Third
World in the miserable slums of
huge cities or the starving country-
side boys and girls of a tender
age are excluded from the paradise
of childhood long before they have
a chance to enter it. They are
neglected, exploited as cheap
laborers, they are ill treated and
abandoned.
For the teenage fighters a rifle is
not a tool for social improvement.
To them it appears to bridge the
biological gap between adult and
child.
To actually exploit that belief
and to lead him to fight for him, is
the most perfidious form of ex-
ploitation.
This kind of exploitation
abounds.
One example: In Iran officials
now regularly visit boys' schools
calling for “volunteers” for the
fighting forces. They are promised
instant transfer to paradise if they
fight in the jihad against “Satan in
a presidential garb” that is Iraq’s
President Sadam Hussein. And it
seems that so far there has been no
lack of takers.
Their training usually lasts two
weeks, during which they are given
rudimentary marching drill and
plenty of religious instruction.
They are taught slogans which
glorify Ayatollah Khomeini and
his closest associates. After this the
schoolboys are considered ready
to join the Khat-Tchekans (Battle-
front Piercers).
Thousands of children in this
unit have been (and probably are
still being) used as advanced
forces whose task is to storm mine-
fields detonating the mines, thus
opening a relatively safe passage
for the regulars who follow them.
The death toll suffered by the
Khat-Tchekans is said to be appal-
ling.
However, for some the sacri-
fices are worthwhile. “There are
parents," said Ayatollah
Khomeini, “who have lost five
children in the war and who are
sorry they hqve no more sons they
could send to the front.” □

WILDLIFE
Parrot plague plunders our crops
JOHN STACKHOUSE
investigates problems heightened by the ban on the export of native birds.
WHEN ACTOR Robert Blake played
Baretta in the New York detective series
on television, his trademark was an
Australian sulphur-crested cockatoo.
The success of the series resulted in a
mini-craze for the big, white birds push-
ing their price in New York to a re-
ported $3OOO each.
At that level, if Dubbo, NSW, farm-
ers were allowed to trap and sell the
hordes stripping their sunflower, maize
and sorghum crops, they could become
instant millionaires.
Prices abroad for this and other Aus-
tralian parrots are volatile be-
cause, bird traders say, we still
ban exports of birds that are
in plague proportions in Aus-
tralia.
Take the long-billed
corella, a slightly smaller
member of the parrot family
which, according to fanciers,
can be trained as a better
talker than the familiar cocky.
Farmers in Victoria’s West-
ern District claim the flocks
there can number up to 15,000
birds.
Victorian fisheries and
wild life scientist Bill Emison,
whose job includes the diffi-
cult task of actually counting
them, says he has not seen a
flock that big, although he
doesn’t discount they might
congregate in such shattering
numbers. He has, however,
counted flocks of up to 3000.
What brings them in
wheeling, shrieking masses is
the ready availability of a good food
source. In the grain-growing Wimmera,
the food is often germinating wheat
and, farmers claim, the havoc the birds
create as they feed on the tilled seedbeds
can reduce ultimate yields from a good
season’s 15 bags an acre to a mere seven
or so.
In the NSW coarse grain belt, the
depredations on sunflower, maize and
sorghum crops can also be financially
crippling.
In Victoria, hundreds perhaps
thousands of parrots die because in
many shires farmers are permitted to
shoot birds actually on their crops.
There are also persistent reports of pois-
onings, which allegedly wipe out not
only the marauding corellas but also
rarer species of parrots and other ani-
mals as well.
Licenced trapper Ray Ackroyd, who
comes from Bringelly near Sydney but
operates through the grain-growing
areas around Horsham, Victoria, for
much of each year, calls the official atti-
tude against sale of these pest parrots
abroad as writing a “death sentence”
against thousands of them.
Jim McGuire, field officer for Vic-
toria’s Fisheries and Wildlife division in
Horsham, doubts the reports of wide-
spread poisonings, which surface in the
local Press.
He and his staff run regular patrols in
Bird trapper Ray Ackroyd: farmers “beg” him to save their crops

helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to
survey the movements of the bird flocks.
The bodies of poisoned birds would be
a give-away, if poisoning were carried
out regularly, McGuire says.
“Very few farmers around here
would condone poisoning,” he main-
tains. “Our farmers, contrary to many
reports, care about the wildlife and we
would get a call from someone in the
district if an individual was irrespon-
sible enough to poison birds attacking
his crops.”
The trade organisation which advo-
cates a renewal of legal bird exports, the
Associated Bird Keepers and Traders,
which says it represents more than 6000
bird fanciers in New South Wales alone,
maintains that poisoning of pest species
is a common practice. The organisation
has linked with the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in
NSW to call for a non-emotional exam-
ination of the pest bird problem in Aus-
tralia and a debate on whether resump-
tion of native bird exports would help
prevent poisoning and other forms of
killing.
A joint statement put out recently by
the bird keepers and traders and the
RSPCA paints a frightening picture:
“Farmers and graziers throughout Aus-
tralia who have been fighting drought
and floods are now (dealing with)
plagues of native parrots,” the State-
ment said. “Flocks of pink
galahs, cockatoos and corellas
are roaming farming and gra-
zing areas of Australia, devas-
tating grain crops, cereal
crops, oil seed crops, nut
plantations orchards and gra-
zing pastures.”
It claims flocks of 15,000
have been reported and num-
bers of 5000 to 10,000 are
commonplace.
“Flocks in these numbers
will wipe out a crop of 100
acres (about 40 hectares) in a
week and cause such exten-
sive damage in a few days that
the crops become uneconomi-
cal to harvest...
“After numerous ap-
proaches to both state and
federal governments, the
plight of farmers is still being
ignored.
“The NSW, Victorian and
federal governments have
refused to allow the control of
these birds by trapping and export over-
seas where birds command large prices.
“Such exports would reduce the
farmers’ problem and provide a source
of excise to generate funds for research
into this problem and the funds for a
closely monitored culling, export indus-
try.
“The secondary benefits of this ar-
rangement are that the horrendous in-
ternational smuggling of these birds out
of Australia in shocking conditions
would be virtually eliminated.
“In addition, other peoples in the
world would have the benefit of some of
our beautiful native birds, creating
awareness of Australia and supporting
the large state and federal expenditure
of stimulating the tourist industry.”
Associated Bird Keepers and
Traders chairwoman is Barbara Devnie

A flock of galahs takes to the wing: becoming a familiar sight closer to the NSW coastline
AUSTRALIAN PICTURE LIBRARY
who, with her husband, runs a caged
bird business in Sydney’s western sub-
urb of Revesby.
Devnie says birdkeepers and the
handful of licenced trappers in Austra-
lia are basically conservationists. She
says an authorised export trade for ap-
proved species would be a more hu-
mane method of controlling numbers
than shooting or poisoning.
The need to comply with state and
federal regulations governing the cap-
ture, holding and possible export of
such birds means that the trade has high
costs and Australian birds would still be
expensive overseas, although much
cheaper than the price asked for the few
that are now smuggled out of the
country.
In the United States alone, she says,
there are thousands of “aviculturists”
those who keep and rear birds in
aviaries as distinct from small cages
who would be eager to get new stocks of
common Australian parrots. The ones
they have now are bred from those ex-
ported before 1951 when the trade was
legal. Devnie is quick to point out that
the ability to get Australian birds to
breed in captivity, which is the aim of
many American and local enthusiasts, is
a pointer to the fact that they are kept in
humane, free-flying conditions.
The bird keepers and traders and
other interested bodies have been re-
cently giving evidence to the Senate
Committee on Animal Welfare, chaired
by Senator George Georges which in re-
cent weeks has been conducting hear-
ings in various Australian cities. They
hope this committee will break what
they see as a deadlock: no individual
state or federal government is prepared
to risk an outcry by recommending the
resumption of native bird exports from
wild stock.
Devnie and Ackroyd vehemently
deny Animal Liberation claims that
trapping and holding wild birds is cruel
and maims them. They specifically deny
allegations that most are trapped by fine
mesh nets suspended in flight paths in
which birds become entangled.
Ackroyd says only scientists working on
bird population use this method which,
he claims, is largely ineffective as far as
parrots are concerned.
THE SCENE is a ripening sunflower
crop on the outskirts of Dubbo. The
nodding heads are reaching maturity on
the rich soil of the flats of the Macquarie
River.
In the distance are the huge gums
which mark the river and its billabongs
and form the nesting places for parrots
and other birds.
At dawn, shrieking in the still air, a
vanguard of cockatoos finds the crops
and starts feeding. With the noise and
the activity, hundreds more fly in to join
them. The activity draws even more
from further afield.
Soon the crop is a mass of white
birds. The sunflower heads are being
ripped apart and the crop lost,
The farmer tries to scare them off by
noise or shotgun blasts. The birds erupt
in a white cloud and shriek off to nearby
trees. After a while, the scouts return
and soon the horde is back in what ap-
pears to be a frenzy. The ripening heads
are literally being ripped apart,
In Victoria, the worst attacks are in
the early winter. The wheat has been
sown in the soft soil and the first rains
have started germination. Flapping over
from the big gums in the swamps and
watercourses, a few dusty-colored long-
billed corellas reconnoitre the pad-
docks.
They find the germinating wheat,
ideal food and readily available. Soon
the same pattern emerges: the noise and
feeding activity draws more and more
birds until eventually thousands have
congregated and the crop is devastated,
These are the occasions when farm-
ers turn to trappers like Ackroyd and
the time when he goes to work,
Ackroyd’s main weapon is a huge
net, which can cover about 300 square
metres. Between trapping seasons he
makes and maintains these nets in his
Bnngelly workshop. To get the size he
stitches together fishing nets and links
them to nylon rope around the margins
so that when he casts them, they will
throw properly and belly out to fall on
the feeding birds.
For propulsion he used strong rub-

ber bands, which came from horse-
racing starting stalls before these were
mechanised.
When protecting a crop, he chooses a
flat area on the boundary of the crop so
that his net can deploy, then baits it with
a lavish serving of grain. Near the grain
he stations a bird of the appropriate
species in a small cage.
The caged bird attracts the wild ones
who in turn discover the free lunch. The
shrieks and feeding birds attract more
and more on to the bait until, when
there are hundreds in the target area,
Ackroyd releases the net.
The net sails up and out and then
falls softly on to the birds, who can
move around under its meshes.
Frightened, they shriek. The fear
spreads and the rest of the flocks depart.
“This breaks up the flock numbers
and disturbs the feeding pattern,”
Ackroyd says.
Emison, the scientist who is shortly
to publish his findings on corella popu-
lations and feeding habits, says the
effect may not necessarily be to drive the
birds from one crop to another.
“There are a lot of other alternative
sources of food at this time it’s just
that germinating wheat is so easy to get
at and attractive,” he said.
In Horsham, McGuire believes the
corellas have developed a taste for the
agricultural weed, onion grass.
“It seems to be a staple of their diet if
they can get it,” he said.
Onion weed, an unfortunate import
from South Africa, is übiquitous in
south-eastern Australia and a major
pest. Cattle dislike it and will eat it only
if nothing else is left in a drought.
McGuire says, however, that corellas
will root along river banks digging up
the weed, largely destroying it.
Ackroyd has supplied much of the
data for Emison’s studies and for
McGuire’s day-to-day dealing with the
problems the corellas cause. The trap-
per is obliged to furnish returns to the
division, to band birds when requested
and to pay a royalty of $1 on each bird.
He must also extricate them from the
nest without hurting them a difficult
problem given the savage beaks of
corellas and cockatoos and put them
in individual holding pens, which are
transportable and look like a smaller
version of chook batteries. Within 24
hours they must be transferred to
aviaries where they can fly.
The requirement means Ackroyd has
a huge investment in plant: he puts the
basic cost at about $BO,OOO. The trapper
also has established his own base in
Western Victoria where he can live and
hold birds during the trapping season.
Ackroyd says farmers in various
parts of Australia call him and “beg”
him to trap the birds attacking their
crops. He says his observations show
that a regular pattern of trapping, even
with the birds released almost immedi-
ately, will break up the flocks and fright-
en them away from vulnerable fields.
After he has put the time into the
field, paid for his equipment and
operating costs (a new Toyota four-
wheel drive every couple of years) and
also the state royalty, Ackroyd has to
transport the birds back to Sydney
where he gets about $7-8 each.
Sometimes his catch includes some
interesting specimens. Recently at
Bringelly he was holding a hybrid be-
tween a sulphur-crested cocky and a
long-billed corella. The breeding of
different species could indicate a press-
ure of numbers either overall or on
nesting holes. Ackroyd says he has
found about 11 of these natural hybrids,
which appear to be sterile so they don’t
reproduce themselves.
Unfortunately from Ackroyd’s point
of view, the Australian parrot market is
limited to several thousand birds a year.
As far as he is concerned, a permit for
the trade to export would allow him to
trap many more birds than he can at
present, stay longer in the field and pro-
vide a service to farmers.
Scientists I spoke to were concerned
that export of a limited number of
i species might open the gates for rare
birds to be sold as well. Ackroyd and
1 Devnie deny this. They say health re-
! quirements would ensure all export
| birds were examined, they would all
; have to be accompanied by evidence
that a state royalty had been paid and
the trade would be centralised through
one or two air freight centres to make
inspection easier.
IT WOULD BE interesting if the royal-
ty funds could be used for surveys of
birds, particularly parrots, in Australia.
The bird trade goes mainly for parrots
and finches and the rare species are well
recognised.
But much less is known of the impact
of urban settlement on bird popula-
tions, although the annual Australia
Day census is yielding some interesting
information.
Around Sydney in recent years there
seems to have been an explosion in the
populations of rainbow and green lori-
keets, among the smaller parrots, while
sulphur-crested cockatoos are found in
nearly all the suburbs where there are
plenty of trees. In fact, some have be-
come a menace. They use their powerful
beaks designed to rip grubs out of
gum trees to pull apart wooden door
and window frames and wreck sub-
urban houses.
The pink galahs have moved into
Canberra and Sydney from the western
plains, probably because of the long
drought, and are now a common sight.
Some species of black parrots are also
on the increase in the Blue Mountains,
particularly where pine forests have
been planted.
But alongside this must be set the dis-
astrous impact of tree clearing for in-
stance in Western Australia where
pressure on nesting holes has reduced
the numbers of many of WA’s big par-
rots.
The impact of European settlement,
not only on birds but on many fauna
and flora species, is complex. It seems a
strange attitude to bar exports of a few
species of parrots, for which an obvious
market exists overseas, while permitting
the same birds to be shot and possibly
poisoned. □

“AND THEY
SAID IT COULDN’T
BE DONE...”
Pardon us for blowing our own horn, just a little. But
we’ve recently won the Institution of Engineers Australia
Award, in the Resources Development Section.
And we’re proud of it. Very proud.
Because we won it for the Sydney to Newcastle
Petroleum Products Pipeline...and that’s the project that
everyone kept telling us just couldn’t be done.
SAAWBI7/84
But we did do it...over, under, around and through
some of the toughest terrain in Australia. With innovative
river crossing techniques, tunnels, restoration of hills,
successful land-owner relations, and superior integration
of safety requirements in the computer-based control
systems. And hardly a trace of the pipeline’s presence on
the environment to tell the tale.
We at Williams Brothers feel an award is only worth
winning when the competition is tough, the standards
high...and the job challenging.
That’s why we can handle your project better than
anyone else. Talk to us. You’ll find it costs no more - and
often less, in the long run - to use the award winners.

The Montsalvat artistic colony in Victoria had the prudes fluttering
and clucking for years.
GEOFFREY DUTTON
outlines a new book
which profiles Justus Jorgensen, the leader who dared to be different.
JUSTUS JORGENSEN’S years of
reigning over the artistic colony at
Montsalvat, near Eltham in Victoria,
are one of the most extraordinary epi-
sodes in Australian history. The interest
is psychological rather than cultural.
Neither Jorgensen nor his disciples
were much good at painting or writing,
although there were notable craftsmen
among them. Montsalvat itself is an
amazing folly, something between rural
France and Disneyland. The Great Hall
is used for concerts and other functions
but people still live in the houses.
Jorgensen no longer presides over
the huge dinner table, where 30 or more
seated in order of rank with wife,
Lily, at the bottom once waited for
him to be given the best cut of meat. His
mistresses and his illegitimate children
accepted his orders as meekly as did his
legitimate family.
Mervyn Skipper, Melbourne corre-
spondent of The Bulletin and father of
Helen, one of the mistresses, wrote
down the words of the master and
refused to listen to the edict of The Bul-
letin management that he must choose
between a life of virtue befitting a Bul-
letin correspondent and the infamy of
the Jorgensen establishment.
H. B. Prior wrote to Skipper on May
2, 1940: “We have been warned that a
weekly paper {Truth) threatens to print
a front page story about Jorgensen and
his associates and that you will figure
prominently in it and, from the public’s
point of view, none too favorable at that
... It boils down to this. You cannot be
loyal to the paper and to Jorgensen at
the same time. It is for you to say which
you prefer.” The Melbourne Herald
forbade any mention in its pages of
Montsalvat and its immoral inhabitants.
Betty Roland, as lively at 81 as a
much younger woman, has written an
uninhibitedly full account of Mont-
salvat in her autobiographical book The
Eye of the Beholder.
Her knowledge is based on several
periods of residence at Montsalvat and
a love life involved with those living
there (although not with Jorgensen).
Perhaps the most fascina-
ting question arising from the
book is how Jorgensen kept
his hold over those at
Montsalvat from the mid-
-1930s to the 19505, when the
numbers began to dwindle.
He was undeterred by the ex-
odus. “Should anyone be un-
kind enough to remark on the
steady decline in the numbers
of his followers, Jorgensen
replies that Jesus Christ had
only 12 disciples.”
Jorgensen began as a dis-
ciple, one of Max Meldrum’s
devoted band who followed
the dubious artistic pro-
nouncements of this opponent
of modernism. Meldrum’s
strict moral principles were
too much for his favorite pu-
pil, Jorgensen, who to
Meldrum’s fury established
his own school in Melbourne
before the vast building pro-
ject at Montsalvat began.
Fortunately Roland has
prefaced her book with a list
of “People.” There are the Jorgensen
brood, 11 strong, including Justus’ child
Max by his wife, Lil, and his children
Sebastian and Sigmund by his mistress
Helen Skipper. There is nothing very
daring in the open acknowledgement of
such relationships today but there cer-
tainly was in the 19405.
Then there were the seven Skippers,
including Helen’s brother Matcham;
Percy Leason, one of the great cartoon-
ists of The Bulletin and a fine artist; Sue
Vanderkelen, a rich and devoted pupil
of Jorgensen’s who for years travelled
from her Toorak home to cook for the
hordes at Montsalvat; Glen Tomasetti,
Sebastian’s first wife; the great guitarist
John Williams, Sebastian’s closest
friend; W. Macmahon Ball and his wife,
friends of Lil and once of Jorgensen;
Colin Colahan, pupil of Max Meldrum,
devoted friend of Jorgensen and suspect
in the grisly murder of Molly Dean, one
of the girls attendant on the Meldrum
Morris West with Betty Roland at the launching of
The Eye of the Beholder
Justus Jorgensen with Helen Skipper, his mistress


and mother of two of his children
Justus Jorgensen’s Montsalvat at Eltham in Victoria
students; Clarice Beckett, original
member of the Meldrum school whose
importance £s an Australian painter is
now recognised; and a host of others,
from the jovial, fat nationalist Bill Cook
to Helen Lempriere, Jorgensen’s favor-
ite pupil and Nellie Melba’s niece.
Roland and her lovers, especially the
communist Guido Baracchi, reach out
far beyond Montsalvat to Castlecrag
and Walter Burley Griffin, to early radio
and Sumner Locke Elliott, to the theatre
and Doha Ribush, with notables such as
Jim McClelland and Alan Marshall
breezing in and out of the action.
But the magnet remains at
Montsalvat, with that ultimate male
chauvinist pig Jorgensen, his adoring
and brawling women and his disciples
who were more like slaves. Arthur
Munday, for instance, who “must be the
most aristocratic green-grocer in his-
tory,” got up at 3am every day to take
his truck to the market, all profits going
to Jorgensen. Roland built a house at
Montsalvat, accepting Jorgensen’s edict
that as the land was his the house was
hers only to live in and would revert to
him.
John Olsen suggests, in a perceptive
forward to The Eye of the Beholder, that
Jorgensen “gave an alternative style of
how to live, how to build and how to
escape from the economic strictures of a
society (in the 19305) whose status was
entirely conditioned by wealth and pos-
sessions.” He points out that
Jorgensen’s ideas of rural romanticism
were akin to those of Tolstoy.
Jorgensen’s building styles and ma-
terials, such as the use of mud brick,
have been copied widely.
Jorgensen did have some of the attri-
butes of genius and the eccentricities.
He kept his paintings locked away and
when James Mollison was interested in
looking at some for the Australian Na-
tional Gallery he was told he would
have to come to Montsalvat if he
wanted to see them.
But Jorgensen destroyed, in one way
or another, many of the people who
came under his influence. Leason went
off to America to die in obscurity. Helen
Skipper, a talented painter, gave it all
up to bear Jorgensen’s children and live
in a squalid cottage where the Master
deigned to visit her occasion-
ally. Lily suffered for years
from multiple sclerosis while
Jorgensen told her it was all in
the mind and watched her
drag herself to meals on hands
and knees. Mervyn Skipper
never realised the talent he
had shown in that strange
book, The Melting Pool, and
spent more time working for
Jorgensen than for The Bul-
letin.
Roland kept diaries and
recorded some of the
Montsalvat conversation
around the dinner table after
the Brown Bros wine had
done the rounds. The Master
would be indulging in remi-
niscences, Helen seated next
to him, half-asleep:
“ What did you think of me
the first time I made love to
you?” he asked.
“/ thought you were the
most disgusting and repulsive
beast that I had ever known. ”
This answer seemed to
please him and he went on: “If
a lover is to be successful with a girl, she
must hate him. Because, to be successful,
he must violate every prejudice she has
acquired from her mother. ”
Helen’s mother Lena was living at
Montsalvat. As for Lil, when Max was
two years old she took him to Brisbane
and Jorgensen wrote her mawkish let-
ters begging her to come home. He
needed people as much as they needed
him.
Perhaps this is the secret of the loves
and hates at Montsalvat. Those who
came there were unhappy because of
personal failings or looking for a happi-
ness not available in the bourgeois life
of Melbourne society in the 19305. With
his theories of art and of life and the
strange buildings he inspired people to
make and decorate, Jorgensen had the
capacity to take and give punishment.
He was so sure of his authority that he
could tolerate abuse as well as hand it
out. And the peck-order around the
table gave people a cause for satisfac-
tion and despair tempered with hope.
As for practical details, “Mr
Jorgensen,” Roland noted in 1941, “has
a fine disregard for things like that, a
flush toilet and hot shower rating very
low in his system of priorities.” And, of
course, the more Meldrum denounced
Jorgensen as a blackguard and a liber-
tine, the more pupils came to him.
It was all very different from the
hippy and drop-out communes of the
60s and 70s. Australians have never
seemed to care for dictators but perhaps
there are quite a few who like a tyrant
and all in the name of Art and Philos-
ophy. □


Now a slow
death for
dance, theatre
By BRIAN HOAD
THE AUSTRALIAN Cultural Revol-
ution is revving up. Following the sen-
tence of “death by slow strangulation”
passed on the Australian Opera, the
Hawke government, through its arts
funding body, the Australia Council,
has now decreed similar fates for the
Australian Ballet, the Australian Dance
Theatre, the Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany, the Sydney Theatre Company, the
Nimrod Theatre Company and the
State Theatre Company of SA quite a
crop of tallish poppies.
Ip brief, their funding has been fro-
zen (in the case of the MTC, cut back).
For the drama companies, a ceiling of
$300,000 each has been proposed for
1986 - meaning cutbacks across the
board of nearly $1 million. The fate of
the Australian Ballet and the Australian
Dance Theatre are separate matters for
discussion. As might be imagined, the
air is shrill with shocked protest.
In fact, the master plan which is now
being put into operation has been on the
cards for more than 18 months. It has
never been publicly discussed. Perhaps
the companies now under attack
thought it would just get lost, like so
many master plans in the past. It didn’t
even though the policy paper
involved was penned by a former Lib-
eral Party functionary before the
Hawke government came to power.
In January 1983, the chairman of the
Australian Council, Dr Timothy
Pascoe, decided that the general winds
of social change demanded a change in
arts policies too, and came up with sev-
eral thousand words on “setting
priorities for the second decade.” It was
circulated privately from then onwards,
and published a year ago in the Austra-
lia Council’s journal, Artforce (No 44).
Artforce promised at that time to pub-
lish the ensuing debate. No debate
ensued.
When the Hawke government came
to power in March last year, Pascoe, as
a Fraser appointee, dutifully accepted
the realities of political life and submit-
ted his resignation. Yet why sack a man
who had already eloquently en-
capsulated the woolly thinking of the
ALP on artistic matters into a seemingly
well-reasoned arts policy all ready for
putting into operation? Pascoe was
invited to stay on and work out his term
of office. His replacement, Donald
Horne, author, former editor of The
Bulletin and associate professor of Pol-
itical Science at the University of NSW,
takes over on January 1.
An important point is that Austra-
lia’s new arts policy was conceived by a
man with no background in the arts.
Pascoe’s training is in economics, com-
merce, business management and poli-
tics. He moved out of the backrooms of
the Liberal Party to bring his business
management skills to the arts in 1977,
and was appointed to the chair of the
Australia Council in 1981. His job was
to preside over the tricky (and lamen-
table) business of handling ever increas-
ing demands for ever decreasing funds.
It never seemed to occur to him that the
central job of the chairman was to pro-
tect the arts; to be seen to be fighting
government for more funds. He was,
after all, a hatchet man.
As such, in January, 1983, when he
sat down to draft new policies, his basic
assumption was that there would be no
more money (despite the fact that the
restoration of funding levels to pre-
Fraser levels was the central factor in
ALP arts policy and, at that time, the
ALP already seemed likely to win
power at the next election).
Pascoe’s central business manage-
ment problem was then to eliminate
some of the ever-growing demands for
money. And the most businesslike ap-
proach to that problem was to argue
that the big companies (the inevitably
costly performing arts companies) were
the bad companies.
That wasn’t difficult. After years of
Fraser cut-backs, standards had fallen
across the board. “Excellence” has, of
course, always been the guiding light of
the Australia Council and its clients,
Production standards were still holding
up, more or less. But if you applied the
criterion of excellence to content, a
different picture emerged. To survive
the Fraser years, the performing com-
panies had been forced further and fur-
ther into the market place seeking survi-
val. All too often they were seen to be
staging fatuous commercial crowd-
pleasers, increasingly avoiding the more
dangerous economic areas of the new
and the experimental, and thereby
undermining one of the basic arguments
for subsidisation. For sure, the govern-
ment had created this situation. But
now, it could be argued, the big corn-
panies were bad and did not deserve the
already diminished subsidies they were
getting.
And so it was argued. From such
generalities (based though they were on
value judgments which Pascoe as a busi-
nessman was rather oddly qualified to
make) a detailed plan of specific action
was developed. In brief, according to
Pascoe, by 1988 at least $3 million could
be saved in cut-backs to the major per-
forming companies to be redistributed
among the “new priorities” such as “art
and daily life” and “creativity.”
Flawed though it was, Pascoe’s new
Timothy Pascoe: trained in business and politics, but not in the arts


policy paper proved to be a persuasive
document within the ALP. There was, of
course, resistance within the council
and its eight boards. But, as detailed in
these columns last April, when seats on
council and boards fell vacant, the gov-
ernment took care to fill them with its
own sympathisers. A “dog-eat-dog” sit-
uation developed both within the
boards and between the boards.
“Elitism” became the fashionable term
of abuse aimed by the new breed of arts
militants at anything they did not
understand and/or anything that did
not fit the new theories of the “fusion of
art and life” which seemed to be the
old theories of William Morris and
friends of the Socialist League and the
Arts and Crafts Movement of the late
19th-century (a cultural aberration
whose major bequest was a nice collec-
tion of highly decorative wallpapers,
once fashionable among the rich).
At times it seemed that the new
guard wanted to toss several millenia of
cultural heritage out with the garbage,
and start all over again, dancing on the
village green. And “genius” itself was
denounced as “elitist” which, of
course, it is.
But, for the moment, a little reason
still prevailed. So it was that the theatre
board handed down its decisions, and
the pattern is more or less that laid
down in the businesslike Pascoe paper.
The “elitist” companies have been fro-
zen, with promises of heavier cuts to
come. Dancing on the village green is to
be encouraged throughout the land.
And under the heading of “creativity”
there is a flow of new funds into smaller,
experimental companies the only
patch of hope in an otherwise depress-
ing compromise.
For the arts in Australia are un-
questionably in decline. The big, bad
companies can now only get worse
and so justify the further, larger cut-
backs planned for the future. The
smaller, experimental groups have yet
to firmly establish themselves, let alone
find and hold an audience. While all
that dancing on the village green (and
all the other quaint aspects of “art and
daily life”) may offer some charming
solutions to “the leisure crisis,” they are
artistically irrelevant.
It is one of the deeper mysteries of
this mysterious land, that even in the
darkest ages of Australian barbarism,
an.inordinate amount of artistic talent
would suddenly emerge from nowhere,
and head off somewhere else. Only over
the past 20 years or so, through govern-
ment encouragement, has it been return-
ing home and, more recently, staying at
home to help lay the foundations for
some permanent artistic endeavours
here. Now, through government dis-
couragement, it will soon be leaving
again. □

DANCE
Joyous satire
can entertain
the masses
The Australian Ballet in Gaite Parisienne: a joyous satire
By JOHN CARGHER
A BADLY-NEEDED shot in the arm
has been provided for the Australian
Ballet by its first production of Gaite
Parisienne. Not that Maurice Bejart’s
version of Massine’s old classic is any
great ballet masterpiece, but it would be
hard to beat as sheer entertainment for
the masses and balletomanes alike.
Any resemblance between the old
favorite of the same name and the new
is non-existent, unless you count the
musical score by Offenbach. This is a
joyous satire on everything you ever
knew about ballet but were afraid to ask
unless you are a ballet aficionado, in
which case you know the answers and
laugh twice as loudly.
Let me split the case for and against
the new Gaite for the two kinds of audi-
ences (not that there is enough “against”
worth mentioning: “Incoherent, illogi-
cal and altogether too much of a good
thing” sums it up). But can you get too
much of a good thing? As in the case of
The Merry Widow, the answer is a de-
cided No.
For the layman: A boy is born in the
time of Napoleon 111 and Offenbach
and grows up to be a dancer. Along the
way, he meets every kind of classical
(but not modern!) ballet in embarrass-
ing detail embarrassing for him, not
us! The scenery and costumes are lavish
and the excellent dancing shows off the
huge stage of the new Melbourne State
Theatre to perfection.
For the balletomane, the timing of
the production two weeks before the
premiere of a new Sleeping Beauty is
ideal. The curtain rises on a typical
Sleeping Beauty palace of Maryinsky
Theatre scale. Centre-stage: a baby’s
crib. Enter Petipa’s six Good Fairies,
one at a time. Every one is a man, a very
macho man in body tights.
The Fairy Carabosse (usually played
by a man) is female, a reincarnation of
Olga Preobrajenska, imperial Russian
prima ballerina and the most famous
ballet teacher in Paris before the war.
Her curse on the child is that he will
never grow tall enough to be a dancer!
(The curse is spoken, as is much else in
the ballet, reflecting favorably on the
acoustics of the theatre.) But, wait, the
last Good Fairy has yet to appear to
mitigate the spell which she can not
undo completely. The Lilac Fairy has a
bald head and side whiskers and bears a
striking resemblance to Jacques
Offenbach!
The child Aurora, here named Bim,
in due course leaves his crib and grows
into a small man who (brilliant casting)
looks and acts remarkably like Rowan
Atkinson of Not The Nine O’Clock News
fame. Mark Annear, making his debut
in a major leading role, does not dance
like Atkinson but is mercilessly trained
by his Carabosse-Preobrajenska, the
Russian Janina Cunova, a teacher at the
Australian Ballet School, brilliantly be-
ing her faithful self.
With the help of his seven
“fairies” Bim finds his way
through the labyrinth of
balletic history. Along the
way, he meets an extraordi-
nary array of characters
balletic and otherwise, funny
and serious. The Australian
Ballet seems to have more
dancers on stage than it pos-
sesses and many are better
dancers than we had sus-
pected. The likes of Dale
Baker, Christine Walsh or
David Ashmole can be pretty
good but David McAllister
(Napoleon) is only a junior in
the ensemble as are the six
dancing “fairies,” making no
fewer than seven men of star
potential from the ranks,
(eight, if you count Annear).
Fortunately, Gaite is male-
oriented; the distaff side of the
ballet is not as strong. Joady
Chambers and Teresa Power
shine in tiny parts while
Andrea Toye evokes memories of a
great Australian dancer-comedienne,
Moyra Fraser. The singing of Barbara
Sambell (by courtesy of the Victoria
State Opera) is fine enough but she also
shines as a comedienne and even
dancer.
Long as it is, Gaite Parisienne does
not make a full evening. It is preceded
by the ballet’s first showing of Bejart’s
short Indian ballet Bhakti 111 and
Lifar’s Suite En Blanc. Bhakti uses
Hindu legends and Indian music but
classical dance a pointe, pirouettes and
the like in an ideal blending of opposing
cultures. The female leading role was
built on Maina Gielgud, the company’s
artistic director, who was on hand to
coach Andrea Toye in it. She succeeded
to a remarkable degree in the acrobatic
convolutions of the part. Bhakti is a
good addition to the repertoire, if a
short one.
The same cannot be said about Suite
En Blanc, even though it was danced
vastly better than in Sydney three years
ago when Lifar was in charge. A classi-
cal “white” ballet, it should be danced
to perfection as it almost was on this
occasion. But it needs more than an im-
peccable technique from more princi-
pals than the Australian Ballet has at the
moment; it requires a style of attack
alien to the softer English traditions of
the Royal or Australian Ballet.
David Ashmole’s stylishly smooth
solo made no more impact than did the
precise lines of the well-rehearsed
ensemble. Lifar was the last master in
the West of the “BANG! I am here;
now, bloody-well watch this!” tradition.
In its place, we had a genteel: “Look! I
am going to dance.” And that is not
what Suite En Blanc is all about. □

FILMS
Sly, adult
game-playing
on the beach
By SANDRA HALL
AS ONE of the most distinctive direc-
tors of the French New Wave, Eric
Rohmer staked out his cinematic patch
in the 60s. Except for a couple of diver-
sions, he has remained within its bounds
ever since, turning out graceful medita-
tions on love and morality enacted by
good-looking characters with immense
verbal facility and all the time in the
world.
Rohmer characters are celebrated for
discussing rather than for doing. They
mull over every option with meticulous
logic and an exquisite sense of anticipa-
tion. Action when it finally comes is fre-
quently an anti-climax, desire having
been fulfilled in the planning stage. In-
deed sometimes, as in Rohmer’s 1980
film The Aviator’s Wife, there is no ac-
tion. Nothing moves forward not
even the dialogue, so that the finished
film is circular and as shallow as a hu-
man navel of the recessive variety.
But with Pauline A La Plage, the
latest in the series of films he calls Com-
edies et Proverbes, Rohmer is at his best
and the result is as slyly ingratiating as
anything he has done an elegant farce
with plenty of wry observation and a
deftly administered kick in the tail.
The beach in question is on a pictur-
esque strip of the Normandy coast
where 15-year-old Pauline (Amanda
Langlet) is spending part of the summer
with her beautiful cousin Marion
(Arielle Dombasle) in the family hol-
iday house.
On the beach they meet Pierre
(Pascal Greggory), an old boyfriend of
Marion’s, who reluctantly introduces
them to the libidinous Henri (Feodor
Atkine) and during their conversation
after dinner that night Rohmer intro-
duces his favorite theme as the four dis-
cuss their differing attitudes to love.
Pauline maintains that she has never
been in love at least not since the age
of six. Henri explains that he and his
wife separated because she was content
to be treated as part of the furniture
while he wanted someone as “light and
moveable” as he feels himself to be,
“without luggage physically and moral-
ly.” Marion, who has gulped down all
the romantic cliches and is now
regurgitating them with starry-eyed
affectedness, declares that she wants to
“burn with love” while Pierre says sol-
emnly that love is love only when it’s
good for you.
With what passes for unseemly haste
in a Rohmer heroine, Marion translates
desire into action that evening and the
unhappy Pierre is brusquely rejected so
she can go to bed with Henri.
Pauline, meanwhile, studies the be-
haviour of the adults phlegmatically
not yet sure whether she is going to
learn anything.
As things turn out, she does learn
but only by standing back and refusing
to take part in the game-playing which
comes naturally to the machiavellian
Henri who can’t resist a challenge, even
on holiday.
Marion and Pierre are not nearly as
wise or as worldly or perhaps, Rohmer
implies, they simply enjoy being vic-
tims. Marion suggests as much in her
“burning for love” speech while Pierre
is a typical Rohmer character in recom-
mending one course of action and fol-
lowing another. “You must love me,
we’re so alike,” he tells Marion, stolidly
overlooking that her impulsive, theatri-
cal temperament is the very antithesis of
his own.
As is usual with Rohmer, all this
game-playing is carried on in an atmos-
phere of sunny sensuality. It is holiday
time, hedonism is the rule and all the
talking is done amid a casual display of
brown bodies against sea, sand and
white bedsheets. Rohmer and his cine-
matographer, Nestor Almendros, resist
the picture postcard approach to their
setting (one of their most evocative
scenes has Henri and Louisette, another
of his girlfriends, enjoying being gently
battered about in a muddy churned-up
surf on a windy day) and the interiors of
the beach houses are no more luxurious
than beach houses ought to be. Non-
etheless, it’s all very seductive es-
pecially when offset by Rohmer’s wry
talent for farce and his deadpan delight
in letting his characters gradually reveal
themselves.
A lot of this is in the casting. As
Henri says when explaining why
Marion fails to stir him as much as an-
other and less beautiful girl met on the
beach, Arielle Bombasle looks almost
too perfect golden, doll-like, yet
touchingly at a loss at the end when
everything has gone wrong and the tact-
ful and knowing Pauline finds herself in
the odd position of having to protect her
supposedly sophisticated cousin from
knowledge which would do her no good
at all.
Langlet, dark-haired, olive-skinned,
with a watchful air and a teenager’s
awkwardness, is perfect as Pauline,
gaining confidence as she goes, in the
realisation that the surrounding adults
are no more mature than she is. Atkine,
with his cool, slightly louche air and his
satyr’s eye, also looks the part while
Greggory is dolefully handsome as
Pierre, secure in the delusion that every-
thing he does is for the best.
Rohmer’s patch may be small, but he
works it well.
When it comes to comedies of man-
ners among privileged people in sal-
ubrious surroundings, few can do it
better. □

SUPER RESPONSIVE


FACT TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver 'super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the motoring writers
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
times.
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
“Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity., but all of mouth-
watering configuration.'' The Advertiser.
"The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning.'' The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological

The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement."
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It's a fact!

BOOKS
Romance and
a ruthless
perception
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Democracy, by Joan Didion.
Chatto & Windus, $19.95.
THIS NOVEL is so sharp, you could
cut yourself on it. At the same time it is
romantic, with that blend of ruthless
perception and fundamental human
sympathy which has brought Joan
Didion triumphantly along from Run
River, Slouching Towards Bethlehem,
Play It As It Lays, A Book Of Common
Prayer, The White Album and Salvador
fiction and non-fiction to this book
which can make you laugh and stab you
to the heart at almost the same time.
The novel is not for nothing called
Democracy. It is about democracy at
work in the life of an individual, in min-
iature and on a larger scale. Didion’s
enormous talent as a storyteller is used
to uncover and display the rules of
“democracy.” The individual may defy
these rules, with various results, but is
not in a position either to alter or revoke
them.
Inez Christian Victor, the principal
figure in the novel indeed, the cause
of it all, as explained by the novelist
when she introduces herself on the
fringe of the fiction defies the rules of
the game by refusing to play. She de-
taches herself but not ultimately be-
cause, by the nature of democracy, this
is impossible.
Her family, the Christians, are col-
onial Americans in the sense that the
whites of the Hawaiian islands are col-
onial. They are rich, greedy for more,
right-wing, provincial, uncultivated, a
bit shady, entirely confident. They can
fix anything.
When Inez’s father kills her sister
Janet and an Hawaiian-American sena-
tor by Janet’s swimming pool they can
fix that too, by bundling him off im-
mediately into a mental institution.
Inez moves, under the inevitable
amiable direction of her circumstances,
into marriage to a totally recognisable
left-liberal politician later a senator
who fails to gain nomination for the
presidency some time in the 70s. She has
two children, is a successful political
hostess, gets her name in newspaper col-
umns and her face on television. The
only person who knows what goes on
inside her head is Jack Lovett, a very
modern man of the world, “consultant”
to governments in other words, an
arms dealer. He understands war as a
commercial enterprise but does not talk
about it to Inez. Theirs is mostly a long-
distance love affair; they seldom meet
although, she says, “We were together
all our lives.”
But, as in Slouching Towards Bethle-
hem, “things fall apart, the centre can-
not hold,” which is Didion’s persistent
theme.
Saigon, where Lovett is deeply com-
mitted, is collapsing at the same time as
the Christian family’s always fragile
grip on stability.
After Janet’s funeral, Inez leaves for
Hong Kong with Jack Lovett without
ever saying she is going. In the last days
of the American presence in Vietnam,
Inez’s wayward daughter, Jessie, turns
up in Saigon to work in a cafe (still con-
fused in the head from a bout of drug-
taking) and is pushed by Lovett on to
one of the last evacuee aircraft. In a few
pages, Didion gives one of the best ac-
counts that you could find of the Saigon
debacle.
So, the daughter is safe but the son is
endangered: he will develop exactly
like his father who as husband, parent,
politician and human being is a pomp-
ous failure.
Didion comes in from the fringe of
her novel on page 160 and from then on
turns up occasionally to explain some-
thing or to make a statement for in-
stance, about how Inez must have been
planning to leave Hawaii without notice
Author Joan Didion: great talent as
storyteller, with stylistic tricks
because she kept her passport in her
handbag, instead of locked in a desk
drawer.
That figures, as they say.
For one who is moved against, rather
than moving, Inez Christian Victor (as
Didion keeps calling her; she has an
effective trick of using full names, prob-
ably to concentrate the reader on the
character) is an extraordinarily potent
figure especially as we never learn
what she looks like, except for a vague
impression of a long-stemmed Ameri-
can beauty. By the novel’s end, Inez and
Didion have met in Kuala Lumpur
where Inez (for reasons that had better
be left to the narrative) has gone to live
after Hong Kong.
Didion sustains her stylistic tricks in
Democracy and adds a few, not too an-
noying and adding to the urgency of
what she has to say. This is not a long
book 234 pages and I savored every
word. □
The manifold
talents of a
pioneer family
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
The Wished-For Land, by Bill
Manifold. Neptune Press, $24.95.
BILL MANIFOLD has not only written
a lively history of the migration and
settlement of one of the most successful
Victorian pioneer families, but in The
Wished-For Land he has made a valu-
able contribution to the much-needed
reassessment of the contribution of the
squattocracy to Australian history.
It has become accepted theory that in
the fine flood of Australian democracy
the squatters were obdurate islands of
greed, prejudice, conservatism and
cruelty to the Aborigines. The squatters
are supposed to have stolen the land
from their own people as well as from
the Aborigines, from selectors and small
farmers; then they despoiled the land by
overstocking and indiscriminate clear-
ing.
There were certainly among them
those who did all these things. But as
always in history, truth is in the study of
particulars. Bill Manifold has made ex-
emplary use of his family papers and
other documents to present a great
number of particular details which, like
that tough Western District bluestone,
make a structure which endures. The
three Manifold brothers were conserva-
tive in many ways, like most people on
the land, but they were upright, humane
and honest. They were also, like all
good farmers, conservationists. Finally,


What the well-dressed Australians wore to the beach in 1914, as seen by David Souter in Clothes in Australis, A Pictorial History, 1788-
1980s (Kangaroo Press, $25). Souter was one of the most prolific and longest cartoonists that The Bulletin ever had. He started
contributing in the late 1880s and averaged two a week until his death in the mid-30s.
they were on good terms with the Abor-
igines. The prolific and much-travelled
James Bonwick wrote in 1857:
“Few men are employed on a cattle
station. One is sufficient to look after a
herd of a thousand. The Messrs Mani-
fold prefer Blacks to Whites, as being
far better acquainted with stock, more
active in duty, more ready and willing,
and not more expensive, although in ad-
dition to 10s. a week wages, rations have
to be supplied to as many of the race
and connections as choose to hang
about. In the mustering, cut-
ting out and branding of
cattle, the natives exhibit sur-
prising tact, courage and en-
durance.”
The Manifolds were pros-
perous farmers and
businessmen in Cheshire
when they sent William
Barnes, William Manifold’s
young brother-in-law, as a
scout to Van Diemen’s Land
in 1824. His letters reporting
on his activities and advising
Manifold on emigrating are of
outstanding interest. No
doubt about it, the Australian
character was established
early; Barnes immediately
took in the appalling anomaly
that there was no brewery in
Launceston. In no time he had
found “a regular Maltster and
Brewer,” built a brewery and
was making £5OO profit a
year. He asked Manifold to
send him hops and a new cop-
per, together with furnishing
elaborate information on
what capital and equipment
were necessary for the emi-
grant wanting to settle on the
land.
Tom, aged 18, was sent out
first, followed in 1831 by the whole fam-
ily, led by William, by then 67. They
settled on the Tamar at what came to be
known as Kelso, but the boys were soon
off to Port Phillip. Towards the end of
1838 John and Peter headed west over
land already squatted on, got safely
through the Stony Rises and found Lake
Purrumbete, a collapsed crater with a
copious supply of that most precious
commodity in the Australian country,
good permanent water.
One is constantly amazed at the
John Manifold in his prime: he treated the Aborigines well
speed with which the pioneers con-
solidated their holdings. A four-roomed
pise house was built by 1843, by which
time the brothers were running 800
cattle, 9200 sheep (cursing them for scab
and footrot and intending to get rid of
them) and 30 horses. In 1844 Tom took
up Grasmere and left John and Peter at
Purrumbete. In 1846 a visitor, William
Adeney, in his diary gave a succinct de-
scription of the sort of man that made a
successful squatter.
“I found Mr Manifold sitting on his
verandah making a small
flour dressing machine. He
seemed to be a person of a
very ingenious turn, the very
man suited for a bush life be-
ing able and willing to under-
take any job light or heavy,
dirty or clean, required about
his station.”
In 1846 John was 35 and
Peter 29 and they had had 15
years of colonial experience.
They were coping with
bushfires, including those of
the terrible Black Thursday,
arguing about boundaries (in
one dispute a neighbour actu-
ally moved a whole hut that
was a survey point!), and all
this while still having no per-
manent claim to the land. A
14-year tenure came with the
Orders-in-Council of 1847.
Five years later the
Purrumbete brothers were
supplying the gold rush
through the Geelong market
with over 1000 fat cattle a
year, and prices had risen
from 3 guineas to £l2.
Soon there was more than
enough for Peter to go to
England to further his educa-
tion, which he did by most

Camera of the^ear.
Nikon’s unique Automatic Multi-Pattern (AMP) metering divides the picture into i ive segments, and then individually measures and
compares each segment, evaluating (actors such as contrast balance ot light and dark areas, and variations in brightness level.
Based on it’s assessment ol nearly 100,000 photographs programmed into its computer, the FA selects the optimum exposure lor your picture.
It.thin .MOMM.iI.


Here's why.
Nikon has consistently been the
leader in 35mm SLR photography
through constant product improvement
and innovation, which is why Nikon
35mm cameras and lenses are used by
more professional photographers than
all our competitors combined.
But never before has there been a
camera as revolutionary as the Nikon FA.
The Nikon FA has been described
as the greatest advance in photography
since automatic exposure.
When Japan instituted the Camera
Grand Prix, the inaugural award was
unanimously given to the Nikon FA.
And in England, two most respected
publications, Camera Weekly and
Practical Photography, each made the
Nikon FA "Camera of the Year.”
With features no other camera has,
the Nikon FA allows you to take
photographs no other camera in the
world can take...simply.
Its the only camera with a four bit
microprocessor capable of automatically
evaluating, not just measuring or
averaging light.
The FA gives the photographer
more choices than any other camera.
In “ Dual-Programme” mode, the
FA does it all; simply focus, and shoot.
Or switch to “Shutter Priority.”
With the FAs top shutter speed of
1/4,000th of a second and flash synch
speed of l/250th of a second, at least
twice as fast as our competitors, there’s
hardly any action you can’t catch.
If you’re more concerned about the
sharpness of foreground and background,
there’s “Aperture Priority”
And of course, you can assume total
creative control in “Manual.”
There’s even a switch for traditional
Nikon centre weighted metering, in
any automatic mode.
In essence, the FA utilizes the most
sophisticated and advanced technology,
to allow you to take better photographs,
more simply. What you see through the
viewfinder is what you get on film.
While the FA may look like other
cameras, any similarity ends there.
The only way to really appreciate
this truly remarkable camera is to hold it
in your hands, look through the
viewfinder and experience the Nikon FA
difference for yourself.

be the final judge

In 1854 Tom sold up the station at
Grasmere and also went to England. He
had had “an unequal battle for men
with whom to work Grasmere.” Not so

no more desire than their employers to

In Peter’s absence overseas, John

Manifold remarks justly on the un-
changing routine of country life. “One
hundred years is not enough to change
the country man’s outlook.” So the his-
tory of Purrumbete moves on through
familiar rituals, with interludes such as
the building of “rabbit-proof’ stone
walls (£5O a mile) by experts, not con-
victs as the story used to go; the visit of
the artist von Gue'rard to paint the
homestead and lake; the building of the
Camperdown railway.
The pioneering brothers had maybe
worked too hard to make old bones.
Tom died in 1875 at 66, John in 1877 at
65 and Peter in 1885 at 68. Peter left a
total estate of £332,089/10/B'/ 2 d.
Nothing went astray in those days, not
even a halfpenny. What a lot had been
achieved in a mere 45 years!
Readers of The Wished-For Land
will look forward to what must surely be
a fascinating sequel, the story of the
Manifolds since 1885. □

REVIEWING Jill Tweedie’s novel Bliss
in The Bulletin, Elizabeth Riddell re-
marked that the dustjacket was very like
that on Peter Carey’s novel Bliss. It was
nothing more than two graphic design-
ers, well separated by space and time,
lighting on much the same idea. There
is, however, a bit more to it.
Window Three Productions were
about to begin production of their film
of the Carey novel. After a bit of legal
kerfuffle, the Tweedie Bliss in this
country now bears a dustjacket sticker
making clear that it is not the book of
the film.
Filming of Bliss - with Barry Otto,
Lynette Curran, Paul Chubb and Helen
Jones (fresh from the Na-
tional Institute of Dra-
matic Art) as Honey
Barbara began two
weeks ago. The film is to go
to Cannes next year and be
released here toward the
end of the year. University
of Queensland Press
(UQP), with hardback
rights to Bliss, may publish
the screenplay by Carey
and the film’s director Ray
Lawrence. Picador plan a
new paperback edition
with stills from the film.
Carey’s next novel, ll-
lywhacker, is to come from
UQP next May. It is about a con-man
named Herbert Badgery, runs to 700 or
800 pages and covers 139 years.
Badgery is a great teller of tales and
where tales end and life begins is not
clear at times.
AT TIMES, some local writers have had
sacksful of roubles — earned as royalties
- but no desire to go where they can
spend them and no hope of getting them
out of Russia. This holds with most
communist countries. According to the
United States’ Publishers Weekly, a
group of translators in Yugoslavia has
found a way out. They are less con-
cerned with the incomes of western
writers than with the decline in theirs,
since writers will not bother selling
rights if they cannot get cash in hand.
A group of Serbo-Croat translators
has come to an agreement with a US
literary agency. The translators will pay
the author out of their foreign exchange
accounts. When the book is published
in Yugoslavia, they will be re-imbursed
by the local publisher. First to try this is
Norman Mailer.


NEIGHBORHOOD
All Blacks’ South African
tour could open old wounds
Protesters contront pollce in Auckland, 1981;inset: All
Blacks in action
The spectre of the Springbok tour of New Zealand in 1981 a visit which divided the country,
amid appalling scenes of violence is being resurrected by the projected visit to South Africa
next year by the All Blacks. lAN TEMPLETON reports on the ramifications.
THE NEW Zealand government is
mounting a strong campaign to prevent
the proposed All Blacks football tour of
South Africa next year.
Prime Minister David Lange says he
has asked the police to prepare a report
on the law and order implications of the
tour. That report, he added, would form
part of the basis for discussions with the
rugby union.
Lange is adamant that his govern-
ment will not directly block the tour. It
will not, for example, stop people get-
ting passports. Nor will it limit the free-
dom of New Zealanders to travel wher-
ever they want to go.
Police minister Ann Hercus re-
minded parliament of the appalling cost
of the Springbok tour of New Zealand
in 1981. “The communities were divided
and the bitterness and anger of that time
are something I have never seen in my
lifetime and something I never want to
see again.
“Because I am minister of Police, I
must tell the house that in my view the
Springbok tour severely damaged the
relationship between the police and the
community at the time and the
wounds, sadly are still there some
four years later. It is clear that, during
that tour, some police officers were de-
stroyed emotionally and physically.”
Hercus believes that protest activity
would be aimed against members of the
Rugby Union Council, against rugby
union property, against the pre-tour
trial matches and against the departure
of the team.
The minister told parliament: “I do
not want to spend 1985 in a pit of div-
ision and agony and, more importantly,
I do not want the men and women of
New Zealand to go through 1981 all
over again because the human cost is
too high.”
National Party member of parlia-
ment Norman Jones believes that pro-
test groups have plans for major disrup-
tion at rugby grounds and to block
motorways every time the All Blacks
play a match in South Africa.
Some New Zealanders have been
surprised at the concern the government


is showing toward the proposed tour.
Clearly, it wants to forestall the pre-tour
publicity build-up - which would
sharpen the disappointment of rugby
aficionados if the government were
forced to “heavy” the Rugby Union in
the weeks before the tour was due to
start.
In the long history of contest be-
tween South Africa and New Zealand,
the All Blacks have never beaten the
Springboks in South Africa.
Most rugby supporters regard the
current All Blacks as capable of win-
ning the first away-test series to confirm
their standing as undisputed world
champions.
It would be the first time that New
Zealand had enjoyed the benefit of neu-
tral and international-standard referees
in South Africa and that in itself is
sufficient to underpin the confidence of
New Zealanders that the All Blacks can
win the series.
Given the fierce desire of New Zea-
land rugby men to defeat the Spring-
boks, it is regarded as a mere formality
that the NZ Rugby Union will accept
the official invitation when it arrives.
Rugby Union Council chairman Ces
Blazey says his council has not yet dis-
cussed 1985.
Despite that view, most sports com-
mentators believe the Rugby Union
Council at this stage at least is com-
mitted to send a team to South Africa
without penalty.
Opinion polls show only about 40
percent support government policy to
stop the tour while 47 percent oppose
government policy.
It would be a severe blow to the gov-
ernment’s prestige, however, if the tour
proceeded.
The government has said that South
African sports teams will not be allowed
to compete in New Zealand. And it has
been forceful in stating that it does not
want New Zealand teams competing in
South Africa while that country prac-
tises apartheid. Yet it is conscious that
the last Labor government (in 1973) by
cancelling a tour, forfeited support from
many New Zealanders who traditional-
ly had voted Labor.
The government also is conscious
that, if the tour goes ahead and wide-
spread protest activity develops, it
might have to send in police squads
against those with whom it is basically
in sympathy.
Lange is on record as saying that de-
cisions on sporting matters will be left
to the sporting organisations. But he
also has consistently urged those organ-
isations to remember that New Zealand
always has opposed discrimination.
Lange has called for a dialogue with
the Rugby Union Council. It is a dia-
logue the government cannot afford to
lose. □
NEW CALEDONIA
The varying
faces of
apprehension
By STUART INDER
PEOPLE WHO are apprehensive pre-
sent their public face in different ways.
They may tough it out, be mellow about
it, become aggressive or fearful or
simply look worried. All the faces were
to be seen in New Caledonia last week
as the French overseas territory (popu-
lation 145,000) entered a six-week
period of mounting pressure that may
end in anti-climax or in disaster.
The week began with a barnstorming
tour of the territory by French Overseas
Territories minister Georges Lemoine,
aimed at encouraging voters to turn out
on November 18 to elect a new 42-mem-
ber territorial assembly. Lemoine’s pub-
lic faces were alternatively the tough it
out and the mellow as he asked, smooth-
ly and reasonably, why New Caledonia
should not be happy for starters with a
legislature that will choose its own
president of the territory. He will select
a cabinet and head down the road to
full self-government with independence
as an option. ■
The aggressive face was worn by
many of the Front de Liberation
Nationale Kanak et Socialiste, a politi-
cal conglomerate of four pro-indepen-
dence parties and other sympathetic
groups mostly representing New Cal-
adonia’s Melanesian (or Kanak) popu-
lation of 61,000, who plan to boycott the
elections.
Instead, on November 24 they will
vote selected politicians into a Kanak
provisional government to be installed
on December 1 with a prime minister
and cabinet. The provisional govern-
ment aims to re-name New Caledonia
as the state of Kanaky (“Land of the
people”).
The fear in the capital, Noumea, is
that the Kanak boycott will mean viol-
ence.
The Kanak groups have said that
they also plan to stop other people from
voting.
There is apprehension, too, that in-
stallation of the provisional government
as a champion of Kanak rights will at-
tract the retaliation of conservative anti-
independence forces rearing for a show-
down.
That trouble may lie in that direction
was indicated last week by Jean-Marie
Tjibaou who, as vice-president of the
government council (cabinet), holds the
territory’s top political post. He will not
hold it after the November elections be-
Georges Lemoine: tough, mellow
cause he is one of the leaders of the
front committed to the boycott.
Tjibaou told The Bulletin that 17
Kanaks were being trained in Libya as
security police for the provisional gov-
ernment.
“If somebody wants to get rid of our
government, we need to know how to
defend ourselves,” he said. “There are a
few people here who are very violent,
who served in Vietnam and North Af-
rica. We are planning no violence our-
selves.”
Lemoine foreshadowed “measures”
to see that every citizen can vote where
they live on election day a statement
which raised the level of apprehension a
few degrees further.
And further fears arose when, after a
series of meetings and tours that were
considered remarkable for their
smoothness and their atmosphere of de-
bate rather than confrontation, some of
Lemoine’s party including High
Commissioner Jacques Roynette
were bailed up on the offshore island of
Maire by a tough group of villagers
armed with makeshift clubs. They
spray-painted with independence
slogans and swastikas two military heli-
copters and a light plane being used by
the minister’s group.
Although the minister had departed,
television film of the High Commission-
er being confronted brought gasps from
Noumea viewers that night. □

VANUATU
The ploy that
changed the
South Pacific
By STUART INDER
THE KEY PART played by Papua New
Guinea Defence Force chief Brigadier-
General Ted Diro in a diplomatic bluff
aimed at having Britain and France use
their troops to end the Santo rebellion
of 1980 is revealed in a new book. The
bluff almost worked but PNG troops
eventually had to be flown in to put
down the revolt, which they did.
The Santo Rebellion: An Imperial
Reckoning, by John Beasant (University
of Hawaii Press and Heinemann Aus-
tralia), had the financial support of the
Vanuatu government and contains
much documentary information not
previously available on that nation’s
struggle for independence which the
rebellion almost wrecked.
Author Beasant was government
press secretary in Vanuatu before and
after independence on July 30, 1980,
and took a prominent part in the bitter
fights with British and French officials
to have the date agreed on.
He now sees the rebellion as having
been inevitable, in view of the “apathy
and neglect which was a consistent fea-
ture of the metropolitan powers’ dual
role in the New Hebrides” coupled with
their rivalries and especially the “wilful
exploitation of Santo rebel leader
Jimmy Stevens by the French for their
own ends.”
Beasant says the Walter Lini govern-
ment of the condominium before inde-
pendence was isolated and virtually
powerless because the main concern of
British and French governments seemed
to be to prevent the New Hebrides crisis
upsetting European relations. As a re-
sult, Britain and France delayed bring-
ing in troops.
Lini attended the South Pacific For-
um at Kiribati on July 14 that year.
There, PNG Prime Minister Sir Julius
Chan offered seriously to consider send-
ing in troops to help quell the revolt.
With Chan in Kiribati was Diro. At
the end of the forum, Chan sent Diro
directly to Vila for highly confidential
talks with the full Lini government.
“Diro’s visit was to be the turning
point in the negotiations between
Walter Lini’s government and the
metropolitan powers, since it was on his
advice that the initiative was finally
taken out of the hands of the British and
French governments,” Beasant writes.
“During a meeting with the Chief Min-
ister and the Council of Ministers, Diro
argued persuasively that the New
Hebrides government should stop
asking the British and French to quell
the riot before independence and con-
vinced the ministers that independence
would not be possible on July 30 unless
a new strategy was adopted.
“He said the metropolitan powers
had to believe that, once independence
had been achieved, the Papua New
Guinea Defence Force would arrive in
the new republic of Vanuatu ready for
active service. Only then, argued Diro,
would the British and French make any
attempt at restoring law and order on
Santo before independence.”
Diro took back to Port Moresby a
letter signed by Lini which formally
asked PNG for military aid and, as Diro
had predicted, the British and French
immediately moved troops into Santo.
But the rebels were left in control.
Diro and his troops arrived as the Brit-
ish and French troops departed two
weeks after independence and the rebels
and their supporters were immediately
on the run and the rebellion over. □
Santo rebel Jimmy Stevens: wilfully exploited by the French


BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Bond’s fight to revive
his retailing cash cow
Retailing activities in NSW have provided a stumbling-block over which profitable
components of the Bond Corporation tripped and bled. MICHAEL MEAGHER
reports on the continuing struggle to remedy the situation.
WHEN BOND Corporation Ltd issued
its annual report last week, the eyes of
the financial world inevitably turned to
what has been the millstone around the
group’s neck for the past four years
Waltons Bond Ltd. A perfectly respect-
able profit of $9.4 million generated by
Bond and its subsidiaries was converted
into a $l4 million loss after equity ac-
counting including the effect of as-
sociated companies for the first time.
The biggest loser was Waltons Bond
which weighed in with a loss of $17.6
million in the year to January after
lodging $10.3 million in the previous
corresponding period.
Norman Ross’s loss for the 11 months
to June was $ll.B million.
This week, major changes in Wal-
tons’ financial arrangements are due to
be announced in an on-going plan to
revive the retailer.
Bond Corporation shapes up well
without its NSW retailing activities. The
jewel in the crown and best performer
by far in 1983-84 was the Swan Brewery
subsidiary which accounted for no less
than 60 percent of Bond’s sales of $393
million (excluding those of Waltons and
other associates) and continued its key
role as the provider of cash for Bond,
funding a constant capital expansionary
program and helping pay for mounting
borrowings.
Low-alcohol beer Swan Special
Light was probably the hero of the bal-
ance sheet. More than two million car-
tons of the 0.9 percent brew were sold in
its first year and so encouraged is Swan
that it is spending $27 million to expand
facilities to produce more.
Bond’s balance sheet its frankest
to date shows just how dependent the
group is on borrowings.
In the June year, term advances in-
creased from $215 to $386 million while
shareholder funds fell from $251 to
$238 million (mainly because of $13.8
million goodwill associated with the
purchase of subsidiary Winthrop Invest-
ments).
Bond’s debt equity ratios have blown
out further.
Managing director Peter Beckwith: a “manageable” problem
Last year, the ratio of borrowings
(term advances and secured bank over-
drafts) to shareholder funds (excluding
minority interests and the negative
goodwill) was $221 million to $241 mil-
lion 48:52. The ratio this year is $389
million to $240 million 62:38. Gear-
ing, in terms of the chunk total which
external liabilities takes out of total
assets, rose from 52 to 66 percent. Exter-
nal liabilities are now $474 million,
compared to total assets of $712 million.
What Bond has going for it is its
thoughtful structuring of debt. Much of
it is long-term at least longer than one
year. Of secured borrowings, $ll6 mil-
lion of $179 million is repayable after 12
months and almost all $207 million un-
secured debt is not repayable within a
year. This is also reflected in current
assets exceeding current liabilities by
$37 million, at $169 to $132 million,
The bad news on Waltons Bond and
Norman Ross did not subdue the Bond
board at press conferences last week.
Nor did the growing level of borrow


ings. It is rumored that Bond has
arranged a $5OO million line of credit
with the object of further acquisitions.
Managing director Peter Beckwith ac-
knowledges that the group is looking for
another cash cow. (Beckwith is more in
charge now as Alan Bond concentrates
on raising capital with the America’s
Cup win still helping his identification
in business circles internationally.)
Mentioned have been Nicholas Kiwi
Ltd, now accounted for, and a brewery
with Castlemaine-Tooheys Ltd a
frontrunner, followed closely by Elders
IXL Ltd which controls the Carlton and
United Brewery.
The ABC television program Nation-
wide even broadcast a rumor last week
that Bond might take over Consolidated
Press Holdings, which publishes The
Bulletin. This false rumor was immedi-
ately and totally denied by Con-
solidated Press chairman and chief
executive Kerry Packer who called it
“utter nonsense.” Packer said he was
not selling to Bond or anyone else.
Bond’s Waltons cash cow has been
down with foot and mouth disease.
Such animals are normally shot but
Bond has stuck with the beast. It has not
been through choice. Beckwith has tried
on many occasions to sell the depart-
ment store chain but no one is interested
at the price and state of profitability.
As vet, Bond has spent heavily to re-
vive the cow. Beckwith acknowledged
last week that Bond had invested
around $lOO million on its retail activi-
ties. The annual report shows that in
1983-84 Bond pumped some $35 million
into the group in the form of a $25 mil-
lion loan and $9.8 million in preference
capital. The $25 million was converted
to preference shares in Waltons Bond
after balance date.
Support went further. Bond Corpor-
ation’s report shows contingent
liabilities of $56.6 million relating to the
Waltons group consisting mainly of
guarantees of Waltons borrowings of
which $31.6 million are secured by the
Waltons group’s assets. None of the
contingencies resulted in actual
liabilities being incurred subsequent to
balance date, according to Bond.
Beckwith says that Waltons Bond is
a “genuine problem but a manageable
one. “We are not about to take shortcuts
or short-term solutions. What we have
now is a solid base from which to turn it
around.”
As The Bulletin pointed out in
putting Waltons under the microscope
in June, Waltons’ main priorities are the
restructuring of its debt, the phasing out
of its credit operations and gradual dis-
posal of property. Turning the retail tide
is in the hands of Waltons’ executive
chairman Eric Greenhalgh who in seven
months has brought major merchan-
dising and buying changes to the com-
pany and its 50 percent-owned subsidi-
ary Norman Ross.
What should be remembered when
Watching from a ringside seat
GERRY HARVEY will not lose any
sleep over the struggle of Eric
Greenhalgh and his team to return both
Waltons and Norman Ross to profits.
With his partner lan Norman, Harvey
founded Norman Ross Discounts in
1961. He saw control pass on momen-
tarily to Grace Bros Ltd in mid- 1982 and
then to the present owners, Waltons
Bond and Bond Corporation.
Only three months after leaving
Norman Ross on what Waltons termed
an “amicable basis” although, in
retrospect, this looked like a handy eu-
phemism Harvey and Norman went
back into selling discount electrical
goods and furniture in setting up Har-
vey Norman Discounts. After collecting
a reported $6.5 million profit from the
fight over their old company, the two
men ploughed around $4.5 million back
into the new venture the first outlet a
43,000 square metre shopping complex
at Auburn in Sydney.
.In his inimitable, blunt style the Har-
vey Norman television commercial that
launched the discounter went: “Twenty-
one years ago, I owned the whole thing.
Then Waltons go and buy it. Then John
Walton gives me the sack ... Me, the
guy who started it all. Now I’m back
where I started starting a shop ...”
Harvey is back to haunt Waltons and
Norman Ross. He says that Harvey
Norman is “going like a rocket” sub-
ject, he admits, to a general slowdown
in retail sales. The discounter has five
stores opened at Auburn, Gosford,
Miranda and Penrith in the Sydney area
and at Lismore on the NSW north coast.
Two more are planned, for the Sydney
suburb of Gordon and for Newcastle.
Sales are running at $5O million a year
but the new stores should see turnover
at $7O to $75 million a year hence, ac-
cording to Harvey.
After just two years back in business,
he and Norman enjoy a pre-tax profit of
around $1.5 million. The partners are
gaining on Norman Ross although, with
a lack of prime sites to extend business,
Harvey Norman has little chance of do-
ing that. When Harvey and Norman
sold out of Norman Ross, its sales were
estimated to be running at around $220
million. Based on sales of $141.5 million
for the 11 months to June (given in the
Bond Corporation annual report),
Norman Ross sales are now in the vicin-
ity of $155 million.
Harvey says that he has no plans to
go public with Harvey Norman. More
than anything, he appears to be in busi-
ness for the euphoria that competition
gives him.
His other main interest is horse
racing and breeding. His prized pos-
session is a stake in Best Western, the
Gerry Harvey: back to haunt Waltons and
Norman Ross
best-performed son of champion sire
Bletchingly to stand at stud. The horse
has a syndicated value of more than $6
million, taking a line through the recent
sale for $150,000 of one of 42 shares in
him. Best Western stands at his property
at Armidale in NSW.
Harvey says he plans to open an out-
let at Fairfield, Sydney, next year. But,
tongue in cheek, he quips and repeats
it to let you know that there is a sharp
edge: “I’m holding off a bit on any ex-
pansionary plans because I reckon the
Norman Ross stores will soon come on
the market.”
MICHAEL MEAGHER


looking at the Bond Corpora-
tion accounts and effect of
Waltons is that Waltons actu-
ally balances at July 31.
The year that Bond has
equity accounted is for the
second half of Waltons’ year
ended July 31, 1983, and the
first half of its current year
ended January. Waltons can
be expected to be well in the
red when it announces its full
year results to July 31. From
January to July, it has been
clearing off stocks it no longer
wanted and building a new
range.
Greenhalgh who has not
been helped by a general
slowing in retail sales over the
past two months says that
the past half-year has been
one of selling much unwanted
inventory at big markdowns.
He goes as far as to say, in the
accent polished by his exten-
sive experience in English re-
tail trade, that: “It is fair
dinkum that there is a tremen-
dous optimism in Waltons. It
is not imaginary but real.”
Waltons’ retail business
can be expected to be down
on the sales of around $350
million recorded in the year to
July 1983.
Greenhalgh says: “Our
budget is based on a reduction
in sales volume. But we will
make profits. Pursuit of sales
for their own sake gets you nowhere.”
Restructuring debt should be a most
rewarding exercise for Waltons and an-
nouncement of major changes is ex-
pected this week. It revolves around the
retiring of a trust deed that has
governed Waltons’ borrowing and
funding activities since 1968. Waltons’
main bankers, the National and the
Commonwealth, hold their basic security
not through mortgages but by “creditor
debenture stock.” The banks are be-
lieved to be owed around $75 million.
Members of the public hold the same
debenture security and are owed around
$10.7 million.
The trustee for all the debenture
holders is Union Fidelity, headed up by
John Sweeney. The trust deed has been
very restrictive to Waltons. Among
other things, it has a 60:40:20 convenant
which stipulates that borrowings cannot
be more than 60 percent of net tangible
assets (NTA); secured borrowings can-
not be more than 40 percent of NTA
and mortgages cannot be more than 20
percent of NTA. If a company is losing
money as Waltons has been, assets are
reduced by losses. And, if borrowings
remain at the same level, the share-
holders must put more money in. Other-
Alan Bond: international business identification
wise, a receiver could be appointed.
An asset in question has been the
property which Bond Corporation sold
into Waltons. At July 31 last year, an
independent valuation showed it to be
worth $l3 million less than book value
of $Bl million. The $l3 million makes
up some of the $56.6 million in contin-
gent liabilities mentioned in Bond’s
latest report.
The $l3 million is guaranteed by
Bond Corporation and, as such, a con-
tingent liability.
As far as Union Fidelity is con-
cerned, the guarantee adds $l3 million
to Waltons assets.
Retirement of a trust deed is no
simple affair. If a party wishes to retire
debentures early, the trustee considers
what is best for the debenture holders.
The Bulletin understands that Beckwith,
as deputy chairman of Waltons, has
held discussions with the trustee about
retirement.
Union Fidelity is understood to have
insisted that all debenture holders be
paid out in full. The trustee was not
ready to accept any other arrangements.
This means that Waltons would have to
find about $B6 million to pay off the de-
benture holders. Looking at Waltons’
balance sheet, this would be
an impossibility.
It appears that Waltons
will arrange what amounts to
an overnight loan with its
bankers, probably guaranteed
by Bond Corporation. Thus,
the debenture holders —
which include the banks —
would be paid back, the trust
deed retired, the trustee would
sign off and the Waltons assets
be unencumbered and could
be pledged to 100 percent to
the financiers to increase lend-
ing power.
In the process, many of
Bond’s contingent liabilities
would be removed.
Increased borrowings
would be more than handy for
Waltons, for whom capital
raising in equity markets
looks to be out of the ques-
tion. Since July last year, the
retailer has raised $23.5 mil-
lion through a one-for-one
issue doubling ordinary
issued capital. In June this
year it announced a $47 mil-
lion equity raising to retire
debts and finance restructur-
ing of stores and manage-
ment. Involving the issue of
93.6 million preference shares
at 20 cents on a one-for-one
basis, at a premium of 30
cents with a cumulative an-
nual dividend of 10.5 percent,
the shares are convertible to
ordinary shares at 50 cents after a year
and redeemable in three.
Waltons has sought extensions to the
issue which closed at the end of Sep-
tember. Bond Corporation says in its
annual report that $25 million included
in “sundry loans and debtors” was con-
verted to preference shares after bal-
ance date. At the current price of 32
cents for a Waltons share, the pref-
erence shares look unlikely to be taken
up by anyone bar Bond Corporation —
the “underwriters” — or people who
owe the company a big favor or are
hoping for favors.
If no one else takes up the issue, it
will leave Bond with around 54.4 per-
cent of the ordinary and convertible
preference shares. This could mean
Waltons becoming a subsidiary of
Bond. Norman Ross also would be-
come a subsidiary.
Bond must make the announcement
of the result of the preference issue by
the end of the week. It may be that,
with more flexibility in the Waltons
debt structuring — and a conversion of
much of Waltons short debt to
longer maturities — Bond will find it
acceptable to let Waltons into bed as a
subsidiary. □

THE MODEST FARMER
A bigger cake but for Bruce
by Bert Kelly
I RETURNED from my weekend at
home to the wilderness headquarters of
the Rough Cruel World (RCW) group
with the simple message from Mavis
that we had to convince the Living in
the Past (LIP) people that we have to
cook a bigger economic cake if ordinary
people were to get bigger slices. This in-
formation was not new to the good and
great but they agreed that it was better
than Eccles lecturing the LIPs or Fred
belting them on the earhole. We are
convinced that we cannot get a bigger
economic cake until we have a more
flexible wage system and this is why we
are crying in the wilderness.
The RCW is not actually at war with
the LIP; we just want them to see things
more clearly. There is quite a lot of com-
munication between our two groups, in
the course of which we see many of their
activities both inside and outside their
city walls. For instance, we have been
very interested to see that they keep a
big and ancient animal which our Pro-
fessor Blandy says is an Industrial Rela-
tions Dinosaur but which the LIPs call
Bruce for some obscure reason. About
once a week they bring Bruce out of the
city into the wilderness, I presume for
exercise and a feed of grass. But poor
Bruce’s joints are so stiff and his feet so
big and clumsy and the ground in the
RCW so rough that the poor animal just
stands pathetically there while rabbits
run between his legs, eating his grass.
Either his front legs are too long or his
neck is too short, so he has to be fed in a
high manger where his dedicated hand-
lers give him bushels of grain to eat. I
was puzzled why they fed him so much
grain until I noticed that his handlers,
whom Blandy says are members of the
Industrial Relations (IR) Club, not only
ply Bruce’s front end with grain but
they also are assiduous with shovels and
sacks attending to his back end. The city
slickers in our group were puzzled
about this but we bushies understood
what the club members were about. You
may have heard the phrase: “Feeding
sparrows through horses.” This is a
practice very popular with both horses
and sparrows but it is not really the
most economic way to feed sparrows.
Then Blandy gave us a lecture about
the Industrial Relations Club. He says
that there are four main classifications
of members. First, there are the Arbitra-
tion Commission and their courtiers,
stiff with robes and other panoplies of
power. They have a great natural affec-
tion for the Industrial Relations Dino-
saur because they depend on him for
their position in life which is a lofty one
indeed. They live in Melbourne.
The staff of the Department of Em-
ployment and Industrial Relations are
important members of the IR Club.
They also live in Melbourne. Their main
duty is to look after Bruce with tender
loving care. They are essential to
Bruce’s health and happiness because
his maintenance manual, the Concilia-
tion and Arbitration Act, is so complex
that only departmental people can
understand it. So their future is assured
while old Bruce is with us.
By far the most important members
of the club come from the Australian
Council of Trade Unions. These, too,
mainly live in Melbourne. Although
they are in theory only ordinary club
members, they really rule the club roost.
It is well known that the commission’s
awards are not enforceable if the unions
do not approve of them. Only the em-
ployers have to obey the commission’s
judgments. For instance, when the com-
mission ruled in favor of wage indexa-
tion in October 1983, it admitted that it
knew its ruling would do the economy
harm but it felt that placating the unions
was necessary for the sake of industrial
peace.
The fourth and least important mem-
bers of the IR Club are the representa-
tives of the employers. These work for
the Confederation of Australian Indus-
try (CAI) or the big companies, as in-
dustrial officers. Most of them live in
Melbourne and they get on very well
with the other club members. They
drink in the same pubs and go to the
same VFL matches and so on. They
fight valiantly and ostentatiously for
their employers when fighting is neces-
sary but they are always careful not to
overdo it, lest they spoil the friendly at-
mosphere in the club. And they have
been far too quick to urge their em-
ployers to give in gracefully to wage de-
mands from unions and then to go to
Canberra to get another serve of tariff
protection to make it better. This is the
main reason why the National Farmers
Federation left the CAI.
This, then, is the picture Blandy gave
us of the IR Club which is so devoted to
the well-being of Bruce, the Industrial
Relations Dinosaur. They certainly love
him. It is a pity he won’t work any more.
He was quite useful in his youth, in 1907
or thereabouts, but is well past it now.
But he creates a lot of employment for
those who care for him. □

The world class Holden Commodore Executive sets a
standard in Australian company cars that's never
existed before.
It's the best value, 6-cylinder company car In Australia.
It enhances a company's prestige. And it satisfies those
who drive it The Executive is the definition of what a
world class company car should be. It has power
steering and automatic transmission. The 3.3 litre ,
6-c/linder engine now has Electronic Spark Timing
which gives 15% better economy in city driving*And
for 27% more power* there's the option of Electronic
Fuel In jection.
The driving environment has new levels of quietness ,
com fort and refinement. The seats are finely woven
cloth - the driver's is adjustable even for height.
There are electronic touch controls and electronic search
tuning for the AM/FM stereo radio. New panoramic
styling increases lightness and a sense of space.
Outwardly the Executive has an aura of style and
purpose which reflects well on both the company that
owns it and the person driving it. And it also offers the
best value for money in its class , either as a sedan or
wagon, plus Holden reliability and service.
The Commodore Executive is a world class breed of

WILDCAT
Sea World changes hands
PERTH businessman Peter Laurance
appears to have bought the Sea World
entertainment complex on the Gold
Coast cheaply at the announced price of
$35 million.
Laurance, for reasons of maintaining
confidentiality with the seller busi-
nessman Keith Williams says that ac-
countants advised he could pay up to
eight times net maintainable earnings.
As it turned out, he fared a little better.
This means that $5 to 6 million is a fair
guess at Sea World’s earnings. The pur-
chase was through Laurance’s private
company Pivot Investments and Bris-
bane-based Murphyores Holdings in
which Pivot recently took a 42 percent
share.
Laurance would not tell Wildcat just
how the investment was being financed
but says that Sea World is likely to be
run as a trust with Pivot and
Murphyores, the emerging property
arm of the Laurance group, as equal
shareholders.
The trust could eventually go public
in the same vein as the Jupiters Trust, to
run the Gold Coast casino, which has
been well received by the public.
Sea World is part of a major devel-
opment program planned by Laurance
for the Spit at Southport. Pivot acquired
the Tooth-D’Albora land tract on the
Spit and seabed lease for around $4 mil-
lion and is seeking approval to develop
a marina with restaurant and shopping
facilities. Stage one of the development
commences in Lebruary, with a 144-
berth resort and “associated facilities,”
and is to cost $6.5 million. Laurance ex-
pects phase one to be completed by late
next year.
The second stage involves a vacant
site between the D’Albora land and the
existing Fishermans Wharf marina.
Laurance is negotiating with the
Queensland government for lease of
vacant land and a seabed lease for de-
velopment.
Boosting the tourist drawing ability
of the Spit is the government’s $3O-mil-
lion Southport Bar stabilisation pro-
gram to open up the Broadwater, the
expanse of water separated from the
South Pacific ocean by the Bar or Spit.
The stabilisation scheme will see a
permanent entrance to the Broadwater,
dredged to around five metres and al-
lowing craft of up to some 45m to use
the waterway.
As Wildcat mentioned in a story on
Laurance and his bid for Murphyores in
June, the fast-moving businessman be-
gan trading property while a cadet jour-
nalist in 1965 and soon after ap-
proached Alan Bond for a job to learn
the property business. Laurance became
Bond’s personal assistant and opened a
London office for him in 1969.
Laurance could find himself directly
competing against his former boss, not
on a property deal but in 12-metre
yachts. Laurance does not have an Am-
erica’s Cup challenge syndicate
underway but says that one is likely to
emerge from the Gold Coast.
Dual celebration
RAY Porter and Partners had social
competition from across St Georges
Terrace when West Australian Premier
Brian Burke launched the firm as
Perth’s first new stockbroker to open in
16 years.
The Phoenix group of companies
headed by Phoenix Oil and Gas NL
was celebrating its move to new offices
in the Saint Martin Centre rooms
vacated by the Getty Oil group.
The Phoenix group includes the Gold
Explorers Charter Mining NL, Mistral
Mines NL and Cooper Resources NL.
Two of the most interesting projects
for brokers attending the office party
would have been Phoenix Oil’s new well
in ATP 303 in the Eromanga Basin, and
Cooper Resources’ Kurnalpi prospect
north-east of Kalgoorlie being linked
with Metana Minerals new alluvial gold
play.
The Wilson River no 1 well in block
2 of ATP 303 was spudded last week
and it has at least geographic signifi-
cance to the Tintaburra discovery, 25km
to the south-east.
Phoenix Oil and Gas has 45 percent
interest and is operator and, if Wilson
River 1 is even marginally as successful
as Tintaburra, it will be a boost for a
consortium of junior companies.
Others in ATP 303 are Zenith Ex-
ploration (12 percent), Churchill Energy
Ltd and National Oil NL (10 percent
each), Victoria Exploration NL (9 per-
cent), Claremont Petroleum NL (6 per-
cent), Kratos Minerals NL (5 percent)
and Conex Australia NL (3 percent). □

THE CHARTIST
Brambles catches a thermal
by Russell Lander
IN A generally buoyant industrial mar-
ket the rumor mill is grinding out a
number of potential takeover situations
such as Fielder Gillespie, Gordon &
Gotch and Brambles Industries.
The accompanying Bridge Data
charts show Brambles’ monthly share
price and volume over the past 10 years
adjusted for issues and over the past six
months on a daily basis. A striking fea-
ture of this stock is the fact that recent
buying enthusiasm has pushed the price
to record levels as attested by the long-
term chart. Another point of particular
interest has been the strong daily turn-
overs from about the middle of Sep-
tember, 1984. The breakdown to $2.50
in the June market slump appeared to
ring the death knell on the primary
uptrend dating from the middle of 1982.
However, the stock has since defied
gravity and is now back into its primary
trend channel.
An indication of a possible upside
objective is given by the broad rectangle
delineated on the monthly chart by
dashes. A linear measurement of this
large pattern points to a target of about
$4.25 which would call for a run
through the top of the trend channel.
APM’s recent move on Mayne Nickless
enabled that stock to reach a similarly
inferred upside objective.
Brambles could prove a tasty morsel
to companies seeking access to a sub-
stantial cash flow (depreciation pro-
vision in 1983-84 was a hefty $42 mil-
lion) and looking for avenues of diversi-
fication. Brambles is a big fish in the
materials handling pond in Australia
(“Chep” pallets and containers) and in
industrial services (including tugs) and
in security. This stock merits a close
watch.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A command performance
SPECULATOR gets his share tips from
a wide variety of sources. Mostly, of
course, they come from promoters,
brokers, share traders and other hustlers
and tipsters all trying to push their own
stocks. They frequently have a good
story to tell but must always be treated
with great caution because vested inter-
est is never far away.
Speculator also picks a lot of stocks
from his own sheer analytical skill and
every now and then he gets an interest-
ing tip from a reader.
A small investor in Tasmania this
week has asked Speculator to look at
Command Petroleum NL and, sure
enough, the company does appear to
have a bit going for it.
Command is a small oil explorer
with quite a few plays.
The explorer has invested in some
areas by itself and in others through a 35
percent interest in Golden West Hydro-
carbons Pty Ltd (in which the other 65
percent is held by Weeks Australia Ltd).
Command holds 16.25 percent of
EP-166, 3.5 percent of EP-137 and 15
percent of EP-41 in the onshore Car-
narvon Basin. EP-41 and EP-166, a
large and relatively unexplored permit,
include the structure on which the his-
toric Rough Range oil strike was made.
In the onshore Perth Basin, Com-
mand holds an interest of 15 percent of
EP-201, which borders the permit con-
taining the Dongara gas field and the
Mount Horner oil field.
Another good address is a smallish
block ATP-298 - in the Cooper-
Eromanga Basin.
Command also has interests in four
permits in the Surat Basin and 15 per-
cent in PEP-111 in Victoria’s onshore
Otway Basin.
But the real interest in this stock is in
its 3.5 percent holding in WA-149P. Oil
and gas discoveries have already been
made on this block in South Pepper No
1, North Herald No 1 and Chervil No 1.
A six-well program on this permit
last year produced oil on test from two
walls.
Command directors remain optimis-
tic, pointing out in the annual report
that already proven reserves in WA-
-149P amount to more than 50 million
barrels of oil and many targets remain
to be drilled.
By and large, oilmen are not too ex-
cited about Command’s portfolio of
permits even though some have appar-
ent potential. Command’s shares have
been languishing on the boards, ranging
between six and 16 cents this year, and
stand at nine cents.
This must be largely due to the
amount of paper on issue. With 55 mil-
lion shares out, Command has diluted
the value of its scrip rather heavily.
Nevertheless it seems to warrant a
market capitalisation of more than its
current $5 million. In a well-publicised
deal last year, Consolidated Press Hold-
ings Ltd (parent company of the group
that publishes The Bulletin ) bought 5
percent of WA-149P for $16.5 million.
This would put a notional value on
Command’s 3.5 percent stake in the per-
mit of $3.3 million. Speculator is aware
of the perils of this type of calculation
but, even taking a conservative view
of this valuation, the stake in WA-149P
remains a strong asset for Command.
Command’s other assets include a
stake of 9.5 millionaires in West Coast
Holdings, which are still worth around
the $1.3 million value attributed to them
in the June 30 balance sheet.
Just as Speculator finished pending
these comments, Quentin Cameron’s Oil
and Gas Bulletin arrived containing a
chart which showed Command trending
up on the charts. The bulletin said
upside strength would be tested at 12c.
But even that represents a 33% per-
cent gain on nine cents. I’ll take a few
aboard for a punt.

PIERPONT
Trade for the asking
THE LAST TIME Pierpont looked,
there appeared to be something like 2
million merchant banks in Australia.
Apart from sacred sites, Pierpont can-
not think of any commodity which our
nation possesses in such abundance.
How all these merchant banks sur-
vive, of course, is on the time-honored
Irish Village Laundry System. In this
economic model, which is more widely
practised than academic economists
would have you believe, Mrs Murphy
does Mrs O’Donovan’s washing for a
small fee, which Mrs O’Donovan raises
by doing the washing for Mrs
O’Connell, who can afford this service
only because she is paid for doing Mrs
Murphy’s. As a result the village econ-
omy is active, employment is full and
the velocity of money brisk.
Brooding about this over his diet
lunch of quail eggs and pate de foie gras
at the Croesus Club the other day, it oc-
curred to Pierpont that any merchant
bank which wanted to generate a little
fresh cash from outside the village could
do worse than put together a share
reshuffle for Trade Credits Ltd. This
share register has been in a state of un-
stable immobility for the past year and
your correspondent is waiting for some-
thing to crack.
Readers will be aware that Trade
Credits Ltd is a Sydney-based financier.
Societe Generale, of France, is the domi-
nant shareholder, with 30 percent of the
12.6 million shares on issue.
Next on the list, with just over 10
percent, is Milton Corporation, a well-
THE FINE old name of Blue Sky has been plagiarised by many foreigners, notably
Anglo-American, who have a mining subsidiary of that name, and an English Travel firm
which stranded a couple of hundred tourists in Spain last year. The latest to copy the
name are the Chinese, who are now marketing Blue Sky toothpaste. Unlike Pierpont’s
Blue Sky Mines, the toothpaste is claimed to be clean, pure and refreshing.
known investment company. Elsewhere
on Trade Credits register are two J. B.
Were nominee companies Moreton
and Torrens Nominees. A little over a
year ago, the CML decided to sell its 20
percent stake in Trade Credits. This
holding hung in the market unwanted
for a while until these two nominee
companies came in and picked up al-
most half of it.
There has been some speculation
around the market place as to the ben-
eficial owner of these shares. The
combined holding is fractionally below
10 percent, which means that the owner
does not have to identify himself as a
substantial shareholder. To Pierpont’s
eye, these shares look like a holding that
has been parked in friendly, but anony-
mous, hands until a suitable buyer
comes along. If there was any way of
settling the bet satisfactorily, Pierpont
would be prepared to wager that Societe
Generale knows who really owns these
nominee parcels.
Then there is a company called
Nafco Nominees Pty Ltd, which until re-
cently held some 450,000 shares, appar-
ently on behalf of a client or clients of
the Perth broking firm of Patersons. A
parcel of 400,000 sold by Hattersley and
Maxwell in Sydney recently was at first
thought to come from this holding but
Pierpont believes it more probably was
sold by one of the Were companies.
Then there are those well-known fig-
ures, Bob Somervaille and John
Ormandy. Bob, who is chairman of
Trade Credits, holds 82,000 shares in his
own name. A company called Reyite
Pty Ltd in which Bob and John are 50-
50 partners, holds a further 305,000.
It is a tight register, with the top 20
shareholders having 75 percent of the
stock at the date of the latest annual
report. But as can be seen from the fore-
going, there are several large, anony-
mously-held blocks which could be up
for sale at any time.
If a raider were to appear, and the
holder of the Were parcels decided that
he did not love Societe Generale any
longer, the situation could become pre-
carious.
Under the Acquisition of Shares
Code, the Societe could acquire only 3
percent of Trade Credits every six
months. Any more, and it would have to
make a formal takeover bid. Bob
Somervaille is under the same con-
straint because under the code he is de-
fined as an associate of Societe
Generale.
Even if the Societe (or Bob) decided


to make a formal or creeping takeover,
they would face another obstacle in the
shape of the Foreign Investment Re-
view Board.
Bob has told Pierpont that the FIRB
would almost certainly frown upon any
further purchases of Trade Credits
shares by them, and Societe Generale is
not about to get into an argument with
the FIRB at a time when it is contem-
plating bidding for a banking licence
here. The decision is likely to be made
in Paris in the next fortnight.
The whole situation appears rather
delicately poised. An added consider-
ation is that anyone taking over Trade
Credits would also acquire its 50 per-
cent share of the merchant bank Societe
Generale Australia Holdings Ltd (the
other half share is owned by Societe
Generale).
This is by no means an insignificant
pick-up. Societe Generale Australia in
calendar 1983 made a net profit of near-
ly $1.9 million. This is more than double
the $834,000 profit made by Trade
Credits in 1983-4.
Meanwhile, skimming through the
Trade Credits accounts, Pierpont noted
that one factor holding back Trade
Credits in its latest year was a nasty
little hiccough in an 83 percent-owned
subsidiary named Board Financial Ser-
vices Pty Ltd.
Item 15 of the directors’ report notes
that Trade Credits’ results were not
affected by any item of an unusual or
material nature except for Board Finan-
cial Services, where $450,000 was writ-
ten off in losses and $211,100 worth of
interest reserved. Pierpont would view
this as $660,000 subtracted from the
year’s profit. As Board is a factoring op-
eration, one expects a few bad debts,
but this was proportionately a large one.
All Bob would say was that it had not
built up over a few years, but was
confined to 1983-84. “It’s a weird one
and we’re still inquiring into it,” he said.
CHESS
They’re catching up!
by Kerrey Shaw
WILL a computer ever be chess cham-
pion of the world? Much as I would like
to do so, answering “No” to that ques-
tion with any conviction is be-
coming more difficult.
The programmers’ task proved much
tougher than they had expected but
finally, 30 years after the first chess pro-
gram was developed, the best have
reached the magical “expert” level of
2000 Elo rating points.
I keep telling myself that there is still
no need to panic. A handy buffer of
thousands of flesh and blood players
still exists between computers and the
world champion (more than 100 players
are rated above 2000 in Australia alone)
but even Karpov may have to start look-
ing nervously over his shoulder at the
advancing automatons before long.
The latest World Computer Chess
Championship, held in New York, pro-
vided evidence of general improvement.
The following encounter was the tense
last-round clash between defending
champion Belle (running on a PDP
11/23, with special hardware) and
new titleholder Cray Blitz (using a Cray
X-MP dual processor).
The standard of the game is quite
high but Belle’s continuation from the
diagram reflects the lack of positional
“understanding” which still haunts the
strongest programs.

The Case Against the Military
A hard-hitting report will blame the armed forces for Aquino’s assassination.
The time had come for a decision. For a
year, the citizens commission investi-
gating the assassination of Benigno Aquino
had plowed through mountains of testimo-
ny, much of it suggesting that the Philippine
military had plotted to kill the opposition
leader. Commission chairman Corazon
Agrava, 69, a retired appeals court justice, is
said to have drafted a document endorsing
the conspiracy theory, though her report
stopped short of pinning any blame on the
nation’s top officer, Chief of Staff Gen. Fa-
bian Ver. But the four other members of the
panel were all determined to name Ver in
some way. Stung by the conflict, Agrava
turned to the others and snapped: “Go
ahead and write your own report.”
They did just that. Working from a 479-
page memorandum prepared by the board’s
lawyers, the four panelists—a lawyer, a le-
gal scholar, a millionaire businessman and a
labor leader—last week neared completion
of a hard-hitting report that reportedly
points the finger at Ver and the military.
Sources close to the panel say the findings
were based on evidence indicating that a

military escort shot Aquino as he arrived
at the Manila International Airport. Those
sources said all five board members were
unanimously prepared to accuse up to 20
military men, including two colonels and
two generals, of participating either in the
plot to kill Aquino or in a subsequent cover-
up. But it was still not certain whether
Agrava would issue a minority report that
would not blame Ver. She was said to be
committed to studying the four-man re-
port —and her colleagues were pushing her
to make the report unanimous.
The findings are almost certain to embar-
rass and unsettle the government of Ferdi-
nand Marcos. For years the Philippine
president has relied on Ver, the nation’s
most powerful military officer and czar of
the regime’s intelligence apparatus, to help
him consolidate his hold on the Philippines.
Formal accusations against the chief of staff
and his men might, in the worst case, lead to
upheaval within the ranks of the military.
Ver and Marcos are so close that the report
will almost certainly resurrect questions of
how much the president himself might have
known about the alleged conspiracy. And it
could only further fuel popular dissatisfac-
tion with the regime. “Marcos cannot es-
cape at least the moral responsibility for
what happened,” says opposition figure
Jose Diokno. “If he has any decency left in
him he should quit.”
‘Saturnalia of Sadism’: Indeed, the com-
mission report seemed sure to stir up more
of the anti-Marcos protests that have now
become almost a way of life in Manila.
Last month, police cracked down on
marchers with truncheons and gunfire,
killing one and injuring dozens. Marcos is
clearly worried about the escalating con-
frontations. Three weeks ago he appeared
on nationwide television, accusing Mani-
la’s outspoken archbishop, Cardinal Jaime
Sin, of fanning the “flames of rebellion”
and inciting violence. Under one of Mar-
cos’s many decrees, that is technically a
crime punishable by death, but the arch-
bishop was not intimidated. He had called
on the president to stop the “saturnalia of
sadism and violence” by the security
forces. Last week Sin sent a message of
support to protesters who were rallying for
Marcos to reform or resign.
The unrest chips away at the Marcos
regime’s reputation abroad at a time when
the president can least afford it. He has just
concluded a tentative accord with the Inter-
national Monetary Fund to reschedule
some of the nation’s huge debts. The Agrava
report could upset future negotiations with


the country’s foreign creditors.
To ease the negative publicity,
U.S. officials in Washington
and in Manila were said to be
urging the Philippine govern-
ment to remove Ver from his
post. Diplomatic sources said
that the Marcos regime had
quietly approached a number
of Asian neighbors with the
idea of posting Ver abroad as
an ambassador. Indonesia evi-
dently rebuffed the proposal,
while Thailand and South Ko-
rea were said to be giving it
serious consideration.
Throughout the months of
commission hearings, Ver and
his men have consistently de-
nied that members of the
armed forces killed Aquino.
The military has, in fact, held
fast to its own original account
of the murder. At least 11 sol-
diers have testified that a small-
time hoodlum named Rolando
Galman somehow penetrated a
2,000-man security cordon at
the Manila International Air-
port and then shot Aquino as
he was being led under armed
guard to a waiting van. Troop-
ers of the elite Aviation Securi-
ty Command (Avsecom) have said that they
reacted by killing Galman immediately. In
his own testimony, Ver said that intelli-
gence agents reported to him shortly after
the assassination that Galman was acting
on the orders of high-level members of the
outlawed Communist Party of the Philip-
pines. But under close scrutiny, that ac-
count seerrted to unravel. Galman’s two
children testified that their father was taken
away by an Air Force colonel four days
before the assassination. Military witnesses’
accounts were full of inaccuracies about
where they had been and what they had
been doing when Aquino was gunned down.
Several civilian witnesses testified that
Aquino appeared to have been shot on the
staircase leading down from the plane while
he was flanked by military escorts.
Fatal Shot: The most comprehensive evi-
dence came from videotapes, sound re-
cordings and 150 still photographs all tak-
en in the vicinity of the assassination. A
photo-and-sound chronology was assem-
bled by experts. That display was then
matched against accounts of the assassina-
tion by military witnesses. The soldiers
consistently failed to account for a period
of 17 seconds—the critical segment right
after the fatal shots could be heard on the
tape recording. The board’s general coun-
sel concluded that one bf Aquino’s five
military escorts was the trigger man —al-
though evidence was sufficient only to
point out the two most “probable” candi-
dates: Rogelio Moreno of the Philippine
Constabulary and Avsecom intelligence
agent Sgt. Filomeno Miranda. Both had
Soldiers on parade: Would Marcos crack down on the military?
testified that they had not even seen the
actual shooting of Aquino.
The question of how high up the conspir-
acy went was the main puzzle for the board
members. After their recent argument with
Agrava over naming Ver, the four dissent-
ers went to work writing a lengthy “body of
pertinent evidence” to support their conclu-
sions. General counsel Andres Narvasa and
other lawyers supplied the
board with a memorandum
that was crammed with facts—
but it was written in a fast-
paced, almost novelistic style.
To make sure that “all the
analysis and recommendations
would be clearly backed up,” as
one board member put it, the
four members used very cau-
tious prose and studded the
text with footnotes. At one
point, a somewhat mollified
Agrava evidently softened her
stand. “It became a ‘convince
me’ attitude,” said one col-
league. Last week it was agreed
that when the other four were
finished with their writing,
they would give Agrava 48
hours to study the report. Her
endorsement of the document
would depend on her evalua-
tion of the strength of its legal
argument.
Separate Opinions: Agrava’s
concern was that there was not
sufficient evidence to implicate
Ver directly in the conspiracy.
Some other board members
conceded that point, but they
felt that as the top military
commander, he should be held
responsible for the activities of his men —
and possibly for being involved in a cover-
up. One board member said the panelists
might wrap into their report individual
opinions regarding the degree of Ver’s in-
volvement. The majority report might also
contain separate opinions on matters that
require further investigation as well as
recommendations to prosecute some of the
Agrava with a witness: The commission was divided over how high the conspiracy reached


Bucking the System
Yap (third from right) and Philippine Air Force comrades: ‘How can I stand to wear my uniform in public anymore?’
Col. Adelberto (Bert) Yap had the right stuff. He graduated
first in his class at the Philippine Air Force Flying School. He was
the first cadet to receive the Bronze Cross for bravery. Over the
years he won so many combat medals that he was embarrassed to
wear them all. His attractive and articulate wife, Lorna, was a
favored Air Force socialite. By Philippine military standards,
the young couple had everything going for them. But when Yap
fought back against his superiors’ abuse of military privileges, his
career started to tailspin. Then his wife joined the opposition.
Now the 36-year-old flier’s career is on permanent hold, and his
wife has been branded a national-security risk.
Ironically, Yap’s downfall began with a promotion. In 1982
the flier was made administrative assistant to Air Force com-
mander Maj. Gen. Vicente Piccio. Unfortunately for Yap, the
general’s wife apparently thought he was her as-
sistant as well. She began to order the colonel
around, demanding that he meet her at the en-
trance to the base and carry her packages. The
blowup came when a soldier, under a standing
order from Yap, refused to fill Mrs. Piccio’s car
with gasoline because she was a civilian. Mrs.
Piccio flew into a rage and demanded that her
husband fire his assistant. Yap was immediately
transferred to the 35th Air Division in Manila.
Ice Cream: A few months later Yap got into
trouble again. First Lady Imelda Marcos was
throwing a wedding for her youngest daughter,
Irene. The celebration, which took place in Presi-
dent Marcos’s hometown in Ilocos Norte prov-
ince, was a gala showcase for Imelda’s extravagant
tastes: according to one account the First Lady had the homes of
Marcos’s relatives razed and then rebuilt into replicas of 17th-
century Spanish colonial mansions. But when General Piccio
tried to requisition an Air Force C-130 transport plane to fly a
load of ice and ice cream to the party, he ran head-on into Yap.
The colonel, as the Yaps tell it, refused to sign the requisition
order, although the cargo eventually flew anyway.
Such high-powered abuses may have angered Yap, but the
Lorna Yap: ‘Arrest me’
assassination of Benigno (Ninoy) Aquino was the last straw. The
day the opposition leader was shot, Yap was on “red alert” in
Manila. He came home tired and dejected. “They fixed up
Ninoy,” he told his wife. “They even used the Air Force to do it.
How can I stand to wear my uniform in public anymore?” Three
months after Aquino’s murder, Mrs. Yap brought her husband
to a meeting of some reform-minded military men and represent-
atives of the opposition. Yap’s superiors quickly found out, and
transferred him again to a desk job at a far-flung outpost.
In the wake of Aquino’s death, Mrs. Yap became an active
member of the opposition. She became a prized speaker at protest
rallies and took to the hustings for opposition candidates during
last May’s parliamentary-election campaign. “I am the wife of a
colonel who used to bomb your homes,” she told an audience of
Muslims in Mindanao. “Now I come on bended knees to ask your
forgiveness.” That anti-Marcos line finally got Mrs. Yap in
trouble with her husband’s bosses. During a Sept. 21 demonstra-
tion in Manila, she told thecrowd that her husband
had dropped napalm on towns in Mindanao from
1971 to 1975 during the Muslim secessionist rebel-
lion. The next day a general came to the Yaps with
an order for them to leave their home on Villamor
Air Base becase Mrs. Yap was a “security risk.”
‘Freezer’: The Yaps decided to hang tough.
“You’ll have to arrest me first,” Mrs. Yap told the
general. Yap himself is determined not to quit the
military, even though he is officially in “the freez-
er,” militaryjargon fora soldier without an assign-
ment. “I refuse to resign,” says the colonel. “And I
won’t come up for retirement until 2001.”
What Yap will do until 2001 is a good question.
Some friends have suggested a political career;
opposition leader Agapito (Butz) Aquino, Ninoy’s
brother, jokingly calls Yap his “chief of staff.” But Yap himself
shows a soldier’s reserve about politics. By most standards, Yap
would qualify as the sort of officer who might help form the
backbone of a professional military under a democratic govern-
ment. For now, the big question is how many others like him
there are in the Philippine military—and what role they might
play in any post-Marcos scenario.

people named in the report. Concerns over
how to present the evidence were more than
just legal nit-picking. If the board directed
accusations against high-level officers and
then failed to back them up, the Philippine
government could find it much easier to
dismiss the entire report as groundless.
The case against Ver was built mainly
around the question of whether the general
had been monitoring Aquino’s movements
shortly before the opposition leader flew
into Manila from his exile abroad. Some
testimony apparently indicated that the in-
telligence network that Ver heads had infor-
mation on Aquino’s journeys through var-
ious Asian cities before he boarded a China
Airlines flight from Taipei to Manila. Ver,
however, told the board that he personally
had made no attempt to keep tabs on
Aquino. The Narvasa memorandum char-
acterized the general’s statement as “ab-
surd.” The lawyers found it difficult to be-
lieve that the nation’s intelligence chief
would pay no attention to the travels of the
president’s principal rival. Further evi-
dence contradicted Ver’s longstanding as-
sertion that the military did not know on
what flight Aquino was arriving.
Cover-Up: The final report may also pre-
sent evidence against two other top military
officers: Brig. Gen. Luther Custodio,
Avsecom commander and head of the air-
port-security operation on the day that
Aquino was killed, and Maj. Gen. Prospero
Olivas, head of another elite military unit
known as the Metropolitan Command. Ac-
cording to the legal panel’s memo, Custodio
was in “direct contact” with Ver over prep-
arations for Aquino’s return. Custodio was
relieved of his command immediately after
the assassination. The board’s evi-
dence reportedly pointed to him as
a key conspirator. Olivas was the
officer who prepared the mili-
tary’s official report on the killing.
The legal memo said he should be
named by the Agrava board as
having submitted false evidence in
an effort to cover up the military
involvement in the case. Both Oli-
vas and Custodio have denied any
wrongdoing.
The panelists believed that the
alleged cover-up began immedi-
ately after Aquino’s murder. The
government’s Office of Media Af-
fairs “borrowed” all the news film
taken by local photographers.
From the start, civilian witnesses
were intimidated, and the cam-
paign to silence witnesses may still
be in progress. In a peculiar inci-
dent last week, a key civilian eye-
witness to the murder recanted his
testimony, possibly under pres-
sure from the government. Celso
Loterinia was a ground mechanic
for Philippine Airlines. On the day
of the assassination, he happened
Visiting rebel turf: What did Marcos know?
AP
to be standing near the China Airlines plane
that had brought Aquino to Manila. In his
initial testimony, Loterinia said that he
heard shots ring out—and that he promptly
fainted. But later, in a private talk with the
Agrava panel, Loterinia said he saw one of
Aquino’s military escorts shoot him.
Then last week an affidavit bearing Lo-
terinia’s name—and carried by a military
Anti-Marcos protesters in Manila
SYGMA
chauffeur —charged that the board had
broken promises they had given him when
he testified. The letter said that the board
had promised to provide him with safe pas-
sage to the United States and a job there if
he, in turn, said that he saw Aquino killed
on the stairs of the plane. “Because of your
promises,” the letter states, “I acceded hesi-
tantly to confirm whatever statement you
wanted me to make.” The letter added:
“Please consider my statements withdrawn
and as of no effect.” Loterinia himself con-
firmed the affidavit last week. But the board
declared that his letter was “a desperate
attempt by some quarters to discredit the
board and its findings . . . We are appealing
to whoever is using Loterinia not to harass
or harm him.”
The five board members themselves
worked under considerable pressure. Their
chambers at the Social Security Systems
headquarters were reportedly found to be
bugged by more than a dozen eavesdrop-
ping devices. Bienvenido Tan, public coor-
dinator for the board, said that when the five
panelists traveled to Los Angeles to inter-
view witnesses who had fled the Philip-
pines, they were trailed by a “team of hit
men” who were in turn kept under surveil-
lance by agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation. One board member re-
ceived threatening phone calls from anony-
mous speakers who warned, “You’ll be sor-
ry if you don’t come up with the right
finding.” But the board member said the
callers never stated whether they supported
the military or the opposition.
The full extent of the campaign of fear
may never be known. Newsweek has
learned that close relatives of two soldiers
who escorted Aquino off the
plane have died in recent months.
The brother of another soldier
present at the assassination suf-
fered the same fate. Family mem-
bers feared that the deaths —two
of them in ambushes by alleged
communist rebels —may be part
of a continuing plot to suppress
the truth about the murder.
Mysterious: Four civilians who
may have had crucial informa-
tion about the assassination have
never been heard from. All were
closely linked to Galman, the
original suspect. Galman’s com-
mon-law wife, his girlfriend, his
girlfriend’s sister and his close
friend have all disappeared under
mysterious circumstances. Mean-
while, suspicion continues to sur-
round the strange case of Gen.
Tomas Aguirre, who died with
his wife in an early-morning auto-
mobile collision not long after the
assassination. The general, a for-
mer college fraternity brother of
Aquino’s, had reportedly tipped
off the opposition leader or one of
his associates about the assassina-
tion plot by telephone before the


airliner carrying Aquino left Taipei.
The board has skirted the one major ques-
tion that troubles Filipinos: how much did
Marcos himself know about the plot to kill
Aquino? It seemed clear from the start that
the president and his wife, Imelda, knew
some things that the public didn’t. The First
Lady met Aquino in May 1983 and report-
edly pleaded with him not to return to Ma-
nila because, as Aquino later recounted her
words, there were “people loyal to us” who
could not be controlled. Mrs. Marcos later
denied to the Agrava board that she had
made such a statement. But on Aug. 2,1983,
the president issued his own warning: he
ordered Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enri-
le to cable Aquino in the United States to
ask that he delay his return by one month
because “we are convinced beyond reason-
able doubt that there are plots on your life
upon your arrival in the Philippines.”

AP
The First Lady apparently believed that
the warnings had persuaded Aquino to put
off his trip. Opposition leader Salvador
Laurel recently said that he had a conversa-
tion with the First Lady in the National
Assembly on Aug. 15 in which he told her
that Aquino was still determined to come
home on Aug. 21. As Laurel tells it, Mrs.
Marcos again mentioned the death plots
and commented bitterly that no one was
taking them seriously enough. “Let him
stay there [at the airport] one hour,” she
said, according to Laurel. “We’ll see what
happens.”
Behavior: At the time of the assassina-
tion, Marcos himself was said to be ill, weak
and under heavy medication. But well-in-
formed sources disclosed that the president
was still fit enough to be up and around his
Malacanang quarters practicing his golf
grip. At one point in the day, several maids
rushed into the living room to tell him that
they had heard of Aquino’s death on the
radio. “They firing-squadded him, Sir,” one
of the maids said in broken English, appar-
ently referring to the first reports, which
had mentioned that Aquino still faced a
sentence of “death by musketry.” For the
rest of that day, Marcos met with officials
and quizzed them about the events of the
day. His behavior led close aides to believe
that he had not organized the plot. But, as
one said, “Maybe that’s the way it was
meant to appear.”
The questions about Marcos may never
be answered. While Marcos has consistent-
ly denied any knowledge of the assassina-
tion, suspicions about him mainly turn on
loose premises of guilt by association. His
relationship with General Ver goes back to
the 1950 s when Marcos, an up-and-coming
congressman, chose Ver —then a captain in
the Philippine Constabulary—as a body-
guard and driver. When Marcos was elected
president in 1965, Ver was installed as head
of what was then the modest Presidential
Guard Battalion. Ver’s influence blos-
somed in the period after martial law was
declared in 1972. He was entrusted with the
National Intelligence and Security Admin-
istration, which gave him far-reaching pow-
ers. He once boasted to an interviewer that
former Philippine Foreign Minister Carlos
P. Romulo “sends me Christmas cards so
that I won’t tail him around.”
That approach didn’t endear Ver to oth-
er officials, but it evidently suited Marcos.
The president appointed Ver chief of staff
in 1981, granting to him a uniquely power-
ful role as head of both the regular and the
covert security forces. Those forces possess
broad military, political and economic
powers. Critics charge that they are also
corrupt and undisciplined. Today, in re-
gions where both Muslim and communist
rebels operate, military men run gambling
and smuggling rackets. In guerrilla terri-
tories, soldiers are notorious for looting
civilian homes. “After some military oper-
ations, everything is gone, even the fruit on
the trees,” complained one mayor in a re-
gion of Mindanao, which is frequently a
battleground between the soldiers and
the rebels.
Gratitude: Despite all the corruption and
mismanagement, Marcos is unlikely to
crack down hard on the armed forces. He
feels he owes his commanders and troops
utang na loot —a debt of gratitude—for
keeping him in power throughout the trou-
bled times since martial law was first de-
clared. But Marcos may feel compelled to
replace Ver. A likely successor would be the
deputy chief of staff, a West Point graduate
named Fidel Ramos. General Ramos is re-
garded as an essentially apolitical, profes-
sional soldier. He is well liked by Washing-
ton, and his appointment could ease some of
the pressure the United States has placed on
the Marcos regime. On the other hand,
specialists in Manila said it was equally
possible that the president wouldn’t replace
Ver at all, or would ease him aside gradually
while keeping all of his own loyalists
in place.
No one was quite sure of the potential
fallout of removing Ver from his command.
The general himself has said that he would
abide by any verdict from the Agrava panel.
But in a magazine interview, he seemed to
contradict that position. Asked if he would
resign if the board found the military re-
sponsible for the assassination, he said, “Of
course not... I had nothing to do with [the
murder].” Some Filipinos and diplomats
were afraid that the chief of staff or his
supporters would react explosively if Ver’s
position were threatened. Others disputed
that idea. “Ver is just not the coup type,”
said one Western specialist in Manila. At
the least, such speculation unnerved mem-
bers of the investigative commission. One
panelist flatly stated that coup rumors were
“obviously circulated in an attempt to scare
the Agrava board.”
Whether or not Marcos replaces Ver,
many Filipino people are likely to continue
to demonstrate for more far-reaching
changes. That had been Aquino’s purpose;
he returned to Manila to try to lead a mass
movement that would press for the aboli-
tion of Marcos’s authoritarian powers and
for the return of electoral democracy. Now
the Agrava commission is doing something
more than simply naming his assassins.
The panel seems to be indicting the whole
authoritarian military structure that Mar-
cos has created. Aquino himself would
undoubtedly have approved of that conclu-
sion. The findings are bound to intensify
the movement that he came home to
initiate.

The Illusion of Technology.
Many cameras today are electronic mar-
vels. Some can even speak. They will tell
you what to do and what not to do.
The only decision left to you is in which
direction to aim the camera.
It is fantastic. But is it photography?
It may give you the feeling that you are
creating a photograph. But who is the crea-
tor?
The technology of a Hasselblad camera
goes in another direction. It is advanced
enough to be used by the astronauts in
space, but humble enough to let the photo-
grapher be the photographer.
That is one of the reasons why most of
the worlds great photographers today use
the Hasselblad.
Another reason is simply Quality. It
takes a full year to build a Hasselblad, be-
cause it’s built mainly by hand.
No robot can match the ability and dis-
cernment of a human being who knows his
job.
And so it is with photography.

WORLD AFFAIRS
A Nobel for the Bishop
Arriving in Johannesburg to a hero’s welcome: Trying to change the country before it is torn by a violent ‘blood bath ’
Tutu wins the peace prize for his fight against racism.
Bishop Desmond Tutu and his wife,
Leah, sat nervously in their room at
the General Theological Seminary in New
York last Tuesday morning. The black
Anglican church leader knew that he was
being considered for a Nobel Peace Prize,
and he had slept poorly the night before,
But when Tom Eric Vraalsen, Norway’s
chief delegate to the United Nations, ar-
rived with a bright bouquet of red, yellow
and blue flowers, the wait was over. Semi-
nary chapel bells pealed wildly, and
students and faculty stopped by on their
way to classes for a service of thanksgiving,
Tutu stressed that the peace prize belonged
not only to him, but to all who shared
his struggle against racial injustice in
South Africa. “This is a tremendous affir-
mation that our cause is just and our meth-
ods are praiseworthy,” he said. “Justice is
going to win.”
The Nobel committee’s selection of
Tutu, 53, was as much a political gesture as
an individual honor. Like last year’s recipi-
ent, Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
Tutu is a respected advocate of nonviolent
dissent in a nation divided by government
oppression. The honoring of these men in
successive years is clear evidence that the
committee considers the peace prize to be a
potentially pursuasive vehicle to promote
human rights. Sources close to the five-
memberzNobel committee in Oslo* said
TuttrWas the unanimous choice. (Others
considered reportedly included Argentine
President Raul Alfonsin and Romanian-
born Elie Wiesel, who has written exten-
sively on the Nazi Holocaust.) The an-
nouncement said the committee had
chosen Tutu as “a gesture of support” for
his work as leader of the South African
Council of Churches, and for “all individu-
als and groups in South Africa who, with
their concern for human dignity, fraternity
and democracy, incite the admiration of
the world.”
Hero’s Welcome: After learning of the
award, Tutu left New York—where he is a
visiting professor at the seminary—for Jo-
hannesburg to “be with my people while
the eyes of the world are focused on me.”
There, accompanied by his wife and two of
his four children, he received a hero’s wel-
come from friends and fellow clergymen,
<,and joined the crowd in singing the black
nationalist anthem, “God Bless Africa.”
The bishop also planned to give the Sun-
day sermon in his small red-brick church
in the black township of Soweto, where he
has chosen to live.
Word of the honor filtered down slowly
to South Africa’s 17 million blacks, many
of whom are forced to live in remote,
impoverished “homelands.” But the news
bolstered the spirits of the country’s black
leaders and liberal whites. “lam delighted
for Tutu, who deserves it, but also for what
he represents: the struggle for justice,
peace and freedom,” said Allan Boesak,
president of the World Alliance of Re-
formed Churches. “It will bring together
all those who have struggled both within
the church and state.”
In Pretoria, the government did not
comment publicly on the bishop’s honor.
But an editorial in Johannesburg’s Afri-
kaans-language newspaper, Beeld, gave
some indication as to how the regime and
its supporters viewed the award. Calling
Tutu “one of the strangest recipients yet,”
the newspaper attempted to portray the
bishop as a supporter of radical black na-
tionalism. And, said the editorial, “this is
not the first time the award has been uti-
lized as a political thorn in the flesh of
some government.”
House Arrest: In fact, it is not even the
first time that South Africa had been stung
by the Nobel committee. Tutu’s peace
prize is the second to go to a black South
African opposing the government. Zulu
chieftain Albert J. Luthuli, president of the
black nationalist African National Con-
gress (ANC), won the award in 1960. The
government banned the ANC soon there-
after, however, and the organization even-
tually turned from nonviolent resistance to
guerrilla warfare. Luthuli, who was al-
ready under house arrest at the time of
*Alfred Nobel, who endowed the prizes, chose Norway
as the home of the peace prize because the country had been
less involved in 18th- and 19th-century wars than Nobel's
homeland of Sweden, where the other prizes are awarded.

A Word from Sanwa’s Senior Managing Director:
Masahiko Inoue, Senior Managing Director in charge of international banking business.
“Sanwa bankers everywhere stand out
for their responsiveness to change and
their capacity to innovate.”
The face of international banking today
bears bttle resemblance to the one it wore
yesterday or the one it will wear tomor-
row. As companies and governments adopt
an increasingly international approach to
their activities, their financial requirements
are becoming more sophisticated. And
everywhere, the high-tech revolution is
redefining the very essence of banking
transactions.
All over the world, highly specialized Sanwa
bankers are responding to these challenges
with innovative financial services.
By keeping ahead of the times, Sanwa has
grown to become one of the world’s largest
banks, with an extensive global network
and total assets of over $lOO billion. Its
bankers are even now pushing back the
frontiers of international finance in order to
better serve your needs in the fast-changing
world of today. And to anticipate those of
tomorrow.
Sanwa bankers are working for you everywhere.

his award, remained confined
until his death in 1967.
Tutu has devoted his life to
the cause of social justice.
Born in the town of Klerks-
dorp in 1931, he sold peanuts
in suburban railway stations
to finance his studies. He be-
came a schoolteacher but left
to enter the clergy in 1957
after the government took
over the country’s black mis-
sion schools. He was ordained
as an Anglican deacon in
1960, the year of the first
Sharpeville riots. After three
years of study in London,
Tutu returned to South Afri-
ca, where he rose quickly
through the church hierarchy;
in 1975 he became the first
black Anglican dean of Johan-
nesburg. Three years later he
was named secretary general
of South Africa’s Council of
Churches, which represents 12
million, mostly black, South
African Christians. It was a
powerful pulpit for Tutu, who
immediately took advantage
of the position to speak out
against apartheid.
‘Moral Issues’: Throughout
the years Tutu has carried a blunt and
forceful message. He has called the Bible
“the most subversive, the most revolution-
ary book” because it teaches that “all peo-
ple are created in the image of God.” He
also contends that “it’s easier to be a Chris-
tian in South Africa than anywhere else
because the moral issues are so clear.”
Tutu has compared the forced relocation
of blacks in South Africa with Nazi Ger-
many’s “final solution,” and has repeated-
ly called on other countries to sever ties
with the government in Pretoria. Though
he opposes the use of violence, the bishop
has warned repeatedly that a “blood bath”
is inevitable if the country cannot bring
about change peacefully. “I accept that
things may come to such a pass that people
feel compelled to resist them
violently,” he said in 1982.
“My purpose is to try to keep
that to a minimum.”
Tutu’s moderate approach
has won him the sometimes
grudging support of some
prominent South African
whites; in 1980 the South Afri-
can Foundation, an organiza-
tion of moderate businessmen,
named him one of the nation’s
five “key men.” But militant
South African blacks criticize
Tutu for what they see as
his play-by-the-rules mental-
ity. Certainly, the bishop’s
commitment to a peaceful res-
olution of the country’s diffi-
culties sets him apart from
South African students protesting apartheid: ‘A tremendous affirmation that our cause is just’
more militant black nationalists such as
Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela. But at
the same time, Tutu’s nonviolent methods
and his position as a church leader have
made it difficult for the government to
silence him. He has never been “banned,”
in the South African sense, which would
prevent him from attending meetings, be-
ing quoted in newspapers or traveling out-
side of prescribed areas.
Even so, Bishop Tutu’s antiapartheid
campaign has made him a target of period-
ic government harassment. Pretoria has
seized Tutu’s passport twice: in 1980 after
a trip to Denmark, when he had urged
Danes to boycott South African coal, and
again in 1981 after he toured the United
States and Europe and called for economic

sanctions against the country and the com-
panies that do business there. Since then
Tutu has been allowed to travel, but only
with a document listing his nationality as
“undeterminable at present.” He has been
prevented twice from going abroad to re-
ceive awards, most recently in 1982 when
Michael Sovern, the president of Columbia
University in New York, had to travel to
Johannesburg to present Tutu with an
honorary doctorate. Tutu does not expect
that Pretoria will interfere with his plans to
travel to Oslo in December to receive the
$192,000 award, most of which he plans to
put in a scholarship trust fund. “[The gov-
ernment] may be a lot of things,” he said
before leaving New York, “but I do not
think they are that stupid.”
Tutu wanted very much to
win this year’s Nobel Prize,
which he believed would draw
greater attention to the plight
of South Africa’s black ma-
jority. “Without international
pressure,” he reiterated last
week, “the chances of peaceful
evolution are nil.” The peace
award is hardly likely to im-
prove Tutu’s relations with
the government. But the add-
ed stature it bestows on him
will undoubtedly provide
new support in his fight
against apartheid —wherever
it may lead.

Testing the Kremlin’s Limits
Western-style cafe in Bulgaria: Living standards have improved enormously , but the sense of discontent is palpable
OWENFRANKEN—SYGMA
The Soviet empire in Eastern Europe is slowly beginning to stir and to change.
By SCOTT SULLIVAN
and
DEBBIE SEWARD
When Austrian Foreign Minister Leo-
pold Gratz came to Warsaw last
week, he was greeted like a long-lost broth-
er. His trip marked the first visit by a rank-
ing Western diplomat since the Polish au-
thorities crushed Solidarity and imposed
martial law nearly three years ago. While
Gratz was making his rounds, the leaders of
three other East bloc nations were also on
the move: Hungarian party leader Janos
Kadar traveled to France; Romanian Presi-
dent Nicolae Ceausescu visited West Ger-
many; and East German party boss Erich
Honecker went to Finland. Only last
month, the Soviet Union successfully bul-
lied Honecker into abandoning a much-
touted visit to West Germany. The gesture
was probably temporary, but the flurry of
diplomatic contacts shows that the old rules
in Eastern Europe are changing.
After four decades of tightly enforced
political conformity and economic rigidity,
the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe is
beginning to stir and to change. One com-
munist regime after another is rejecting the
inefficient, overcentralized economic mod-
el that Moscow still imposes on its own
citizens. Throughout the nations of East-
ern Europe, government leaders are voic-
ing nationalistic sentiments that were long
condemned in the name of “socialist inter-
nationalism.” A vigorous peace move-
ment, which condemns both Soviet and
American participation in the nuclear
arms race, has risen up in every Warsaw
Pact country. Even the most loyal and
committed of the Soviet Union’s allies are
striving openly to achieve a degree of inde-
pendence from Moscow’s foreign-policy
dictates —and are expressing a yearning
for closer ties with their neighbors in West-
ern Europe.
The Warsaw Pact is far from dissolution.
By forcing Honecker to call olf his Bonn
visit at the very last minute, the Kremlin
proved that it is still capable of working its
political will in Eastern Europe. In the eco-
nomic area, Moscow also continues to hold
most of the cards. The satellite states receive
the bulk of their energy and raw materials
from the Soviet Union, and the six East
European party leaders are all staunch
champions of the Marxist cause. For all
that, the mood of Eastern Europe is clearly
changing. While the Soviet leaders can still
call all the most important shots, they can
no longer count on blind obedience.
A Complex Tangle: The situation that the
Soviets face today bears little resemblance to
the revolts that flared in Hungary in 1956, in
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Poland in
1981. Those could be handled with force —
and were. This is not a Prague Spring. The
latest discontent reflects a complex tangle of
national concerns, unfulfilled popular aspi


rations and a nearly universal conviction
that the Eastern alliance has not lived up to
its promises. The discontent takes widely
different forms in each country. The new
challenges are posed by governments re-
signed to remain in the Soviet system
even while they insist that the system
must change.
Economic tensions underlie much of the
new discontent. After decades of steady, if
unspectacular, growth, every country in the
Eastern bloc is now suffering the effects of
worldwide inflation and recession. Export
markets have been shrinking, and growth
has been minimal or negative for the past
four years. Moscow no longer is willing to
buy the shoddy, bottom-of-the-line goods it
once readily accepted from its allies. Soviet
oil was once cheap and plentiful; now War-
saw Pact nations have to pay more for it
than they do for OPEC crude. By now it has
become a byword among economists and
planners from East Berlin to Sofia that re-
covery can only be generated from the West.
Missiles: East Europeans are also begin-
ning to question the Soviets’ ability to guar-
antee their security. The Kremlin’s decision
to respond to the NATO deployment of new
nuclear missiles by installing its own, nucle-
ar-tipped SS-22 rockets in East Germany
and Czechoslovakia has spawned some-
thing like a war psychosis in those coun-
tries. “If we have the rockets,” one Czech
citizen wrote to the Prague daily Rude
Pravo earlier this year, “don’t we become
targets, too?” Such fears are increasingly
expressed at the official level. East Europe-
an leaders have insisted on the need to “limit
the damage” of superpower hostility and to
“isolate the European situation” from the
perceived dangers of the outside world.
In the past, the alliance provided some
real advantages. Under Russian sponsor-
ship, the war-torn economies of central Eu-
rope were rebuilt: for three decades average
growth rates ran between 3 and 5 percent.

Shopping for consumer goods in Hungary: Success has sparked a brush fire of imitation
million, rose to become the 10th largest
industrial power in the world. Living stand-
ards doubled in primitive Bulgaria and by
the early 19705, Hungarian and Czechs
were enjoying more high-quality consumer
goods than Soviet citizens have ever seen.
Now, however, there are problems. From
the Soviet standpoint, East Europe no long-
er provides industrial exports of acceptable
quality. For each of the past three years,
Moscow has run a $3 billion trade surplus
with the satellites, effectively subsidizing its
allies’ economies. Yet some East-bloc lead-
ers feel that the Soviets are not providing the
support they urgently need.
The prospects for the future are even
gloomier. Economists and planners in the
East bloc desperately want to join the tech-
nological revolution that is sweeping the
West. But they have been frustrated by the
United States, which has severely curtailed
transfer of many high-tech items, and by
orthodox Soviet leaders who fear the politi-
cal consequences of too much cooperation
with the capitalist world. “The technologies
we need are in the West,” says Czech plan-
ner Jaroslav Jirasek, and every single East-
bloc nation is seeking to tap them. That
desire is causing serious problems within
COMECON, the East European version of
the Common Market. At a summit meet-
ing last June, the Soviets urged their
COMECON partners to work toward
greater “socialist integration.” The East
European delegates countered that it would
be better to sell an increasing share of their
best products to the West. The
meeting ended with two incon-
clusive communiques that paid
lip service to the notion of eco-
nomic cooperation but im-
posed few new obligations on
the restive allies.
Red Carpet: Leaders in every
East European capital are
watching warily for signs that
the Soviets will seek to curtail
their trade with the West. And
so they are scurrying to lock up
as many deals as possible. East
Germany has signed an agree-
ment with France aimed at
increasing bilateral trade four-
fold in the next six years. Bul-
garian officials roll out the red
carpet almost daily for busi-
nessmen from Japan, Sweden
and Austria, in their search for
new technology.
East European countries


are also quietly shelving Marxist central
planning in favor of a wide range of per-
sonal and group incentives. Hungarian
party leader Kadar has transformed his
country into an economic hybrid in which
more than a third of all Hungarians earn at
least a part of their living from the private
sector. “Economic rationality consists in
making decisions on the basis of market
input, not your own opinions,” says econo-
mist Thomas Backsai of the Hungarian
National Bank.
Hungary’s relative success has created
imitators throughout Eastern Europe. Bul-
garia’s “new economic mechanism” copies
the Hungarian model step by step. In 1982
the Polish government announced an am-
bitious plan to decentralize the economy,
essentially by “Kadarizing” it. Even in
hard-lining Czechoslovakia and East Ger-
many, where the official rhetoric still ex-
tols Marxist-Leninist principles, reform is
creeping in by the back door. “What we
are aiming for,” says Wolfgang Heinrich,
senior economist at the East German
Academy of Science, “is a profit-oriented
economy from the bottom to the top.”
As the superpower hostility grows more
intense, East Europeans are increasingly
dubious about the old promise of military
security under the Soviet umbrella. Nuclear
jitters are apparent everywhere. In Hunga-
ry, academics and intellectuals are calling
for denuclearization throughout the conti-
nent and the removal of all foreign troops
from both sides of the ideological divide.
With strong backing from the reformed
churches, thousands of young East Ger-
mans have begun protesting both Soviet SS-
Warsaw’s Independent Spirit
The Soviet Union may have imposed its political system on
Warsaw, but the city still retains a spirit of independence.
Newsweek’s Debbie Seward, who has reported from both Mos-
cow and Warsaw, recently visited the Polish capital and offered
her impressions of how life in the two cities differs:
A joke making the rounds in Eastern Europe has two travelers
converging on Warsaw. The first is from Moscow; the second
from Paris. Exclaims the Muscovite on his arrival: “Ah, Paris!”
Groans the other traveler: “Ugh . . . Moscow.” The Solidarity
movement couldn’t transform Warsaw into Paris. But even after
three years of the repressive regime of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
Warsaw isn’t Moscow either. The au-
thorities may have dampened the Polish
people’s aspirations for political plural-
ity, but the breadth of undisguised public
contempt for the authorities has para-
lyzed the party’s once übiquitous control
over daily life.
That rebelliousness seems almost a
part of the national personality. Anyone
familiar with the surly and submissive
conduct of most Russians is struck by
the special Polish mixture of cordiality
and insolence. At Warsaw Airport an
unkempt passport official barely glanced
at my visa. He was too busy listening to
the rock music blaring from his transis-
tor radio. Even the baggage inspector,
who winced when I spoke to him in
Russian, politely addressed me as pani
(Miss) —a welcome change from the
Russian devushka (girl).
At first glance Warsaw seems like
Moscow in miniature. Armed border
guards patrol the weedy airport tarmac.
The star-topped spire of the 42-story
Palace of Culture dominates the Warsaw
skyline, a replica of the wedding-cake
structures built in Moscow under Stalin.
Aging trucks and buses spew clouds of
carbon monoxide into the broad avenues
that cut through the central city. Massive apartment buildings
line the streets for miles, almost indistinguishable from streets in
Leningrad or Kiev. At night the city falls dark and silent.
But looks can deceive. Warsaw, as it turns out, is so profound-
ly different from Moscow that it is almost in another universe.
On Sundays local artists display their works in Warsaw’s Old
Town. Longhaired youths strum guitars. “Rosemary’s Baby,”
“Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “The Blues Brothers” were
among the many Western films playing.
There are still small signs of political
resistance. Slips of paper scrawled with
messages of support for Solidarity litter the sidewalk around a
cross made of flowers.
Many of the conventions of socialism are strikingly absent in
Poland. Huge banners glorifying the working class, Lenin and
communism, so common in the Soviet Union, are nonexistant in
Warsaw. Poles address each other as Miss, Mr. or Mrs., not
comrade, girl or young man. In a country where meat and other
staples are in short supply, flowers are bought and given with
affection and abundance. While Polish officials may be less than
forthcoming in answering a journalist’s questions, at least they
do talk off the record over tea. (Their Soviet counterparts are for
Warsaw market: A city of independent spirit
AP
the most part completely inaccessible.)
These small, human gestures are proud-
ly preserved—reminders of a not-so-dis-
tant, more civilized past —and are part of
a Polish struggle to protect individuality
and identity within a system that values
neither.
Another major contrast is the way in
which dissidents live in each of the cities.
In the years after I left Moscow, the
Kremlin cracked down heavily on Sovi-
ets seeking contact with foreigners. Few
of the remaining Soviet dissidents now
venture into the special housing com-
pounds set aside for foreign diplomats,
journalists and businessmen. Even Sovi-
et friends with whom I once enjoyed
picnics in the countryside now shy away
from such contacts. While on assign-
ment last summer, I met with them, but
quietly, in private homes behind closed
doors. The political chill between the
superpowers and a recent spate of beat-
ings of foreigners by Soviet security po-
lice has made American diplomats less
inclined than ever to venture out into
Soviet society.
The situation is quite different in War-
saw. Prominent Polish dissidents an-
swer their own telephones. One resident
of Warsaw even told me that the communist government was
the minority and represented the dissident view. Foreigners
can live anywhere they choose. Poles can and do visit them,
publicly and privately. For Westerners on business assign-
ments, Moscow is considered a more prestigious post than
Warsaw. But few foreigners will confess to enjoying life in the
Soviet capital. Warsaw, though a far cry from Paris, is at least a
more livable city.


20s and American Pershing missiles. Last
year 10,000 young men refused active serv-
ice in the East German Army, up from an
average of only 700 during the 19705. The
nervousness is shared at every level. “It is
possible that the United States would come
out of a nuclear war with 20 million dead,
but a surviving economy,” says Jurgen
Ebert, the official in charge of disarmament
issues at the East German Foreign Office.
“The same may be true for the Soviet Union.
But for us, in this part of the world, there will
be no survival. It will be the end.”
Political leaders have responded to their
countrymen’s concern by trying, always
cautiously, to edge away from Moscow’s
hostile line. In a speech last November,
East Germany’s Honecker insisted that po-
litical dialogue must be maintained with the
West, precisely because of the state of inter-
national tension. East Germany would do
everything it could, he pledged, to limit the
damage caused by the impasse between the
superpowers. Then, Matyas Szuros, the
Hungarian Communist Party secretary for
international affairs, suggested that “small
countries” have a special role to play in
bridging the East-West gap. At a pan-Euro-
pean conference in Stockholm last winter,
the Bulgarian and Romanian foreign minis-
ters devoted much of their speeches to a
proposal for a “nuclear-free zone in the
Balkans.” Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko simply noted their proposal
“with interest.”
Nationalism: The Balkan scheme was just
one more sign that Eastern leaders are in-
creasingly stressing their national, rather
than collective, interests. Hun-
gary’s Matyas Szuros has gone
so far as to claim that “national
interests should be subordinate
to common [Soviet bloc] inter-
ests only in extraordinary situ-
ations.” The new nationalism
takes many forms. Every coun-
try in the area is promoting a
renewed interest in its own na-
tional history and culture, un-
derlining the qualities that dif-
ferentiate them from the Soviet
Union and from each other.
East Germany has revived the
memory of Frederick the Great
and lesser Prussian figures, not
to mention Martin Luther, who
is now presented as a force for
social-change and progress in
Reformation Germany. This
year, in connection with the
40th anniversary of communist
rule in Romania, Ceausescu
launched a campaign to prove
that it was Romanian patriots,
and not the Red Army, who
kicked Nazi troops out of the
country in 1945. “Many of the
Eastern Europeans feel they
are culturally superior to the
Buying books in Romania: ‘Many East Europeans feel culturally superior to the Russians’
Russians,” says Patrick Moore, an area spe-
cialist for Radio Free Europe, “and now
they are showing it very clearly.”
Ironically, the Soviets initiated and en-
couraged the movements that have now
taken an independent turn. A massive East
European peace movement was intended to
stiffen Warsaw Pact resolve against West-
ern missile deployment. Nationalistic feel-
ing was fostered with a view to channeling
patriotic sentiment into harmless localism,
During the period of detente in the middle
19705, Moscow offered the example for
more relaxed and frequent contacts with the
East German port: Export markets have been shrinking
EASTFOTO
West. Now, however, all these tendencies
have plainly gone too far in the view of
Soviet leaders. Last April, Gromyko
warned that some of the allies were “weak-
ening bloc unity.” Ever since, the Soviets
have been doing what they could to tighten
the reins.
East Germany’s Erich Honecker was the
first and most important target of the
Kremlin crackdown. After years of lock-
step conformity to the Soviet line, Honecker
has begun to build new bridges to West
Germany. Despite Moscow’s increasingly
shrill opposition, he pressed ahead with
plans to travel to Bonn to meet with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the first
such visit since the two German states came
into existence. It was not until two weeks
before Honecker’s scheduled arrival that he
was pointedly ordered not to make the trip.
A few days later, Soviet politburo member
Mikhail Gorbachov flew to Sofia and or-
dered Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov to
postpone the visit he was planning to make
to Bonn. But as last week’s visits demon-
strate, East bloc leaders seem determined to
continue their Western overtures. For now,
the next move is up to Moscow.
Tension: To some extent, the tension and
the ferment that are now clearly visible in
the East bloc are the natural outcome of the
passage of time and the shift of generations.
Like their Western counterparts, young
people in Eastern Europe have no direct
experience of war. Many are highly educat-
ed by any standard, and despite efforts to
limit their horizons, they are pretty much a
cosmopolitan lot, identifying their universe
with Western Europe and the world at large.
East-bloc citizens have also gained an
impressive range of qualitative advantages
over the Soviets. In Poland, the regime has
been forced to grant almost complete free-
dom to the press. “The East Germans have
everything on their shelves and nothing in


Warsaw Pact maneuvers in Czechoslovakia: ‘If we have rockets, don't we become targets?'
their newspapers,” runs a current bitter-
sweet Warsaw joke. “We have nothing on
the shelves and everything in the papers.”
The Western press is on sale throughout
Hungary, and it is avidly read. Three out of
four East Germans watch West German
television every day, and party cadres who
are asked to move to parts of the country
where reception of Western programs is bad
have been known to refuse a new assignment
on that account. In Poland, the Catholic
Church has survived as a major force,
though the churches are far weaker in East
Germany and Hungary. Still, they do take
independent positions, and the govern-
ments have little choice but to live
with them.
Rich and Poor; The six Warsaw Pact
countries have reached dramatically differ-
ent levels of economic develop-
ment, and their human-rights
practices vary even more widely.
East Germans need a visa to go to
Hungary or Poland. Czech and
Bulgarian newspapers read like
Pravda. But Hungarian newspa-
pers, while not given to criticizing
the regime, include serious report-
ing on problems such as pollution
and drugs. Ordinary Hungarian
citizens are keenly aware of the
differences that have occurred
among the East-bloc countries,
and between their countries and
the Soviet Union. They see grow-
ing divisions between the rich and
the poor, the ideologically strait-
jacketed and the relatively free.
The new mood in Eastern Eu-
rope offers risks and opportunities
alike to the United States and its
NATO allies. Despite Ronald
Reagan’s claim that he does not
“accept” the postwar division of Europe
into two contending blocs, the West has
demonstrated again and again it is not pre-
pared to intervene in the Soviet sphere on
behalf of any insurgent nation or group,
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former U.S. State
Department specialist on East-West affairs,
argued in 1976 that the West must avoid
giving the impression that it will come to the
aid of East-bloc dissidents. That wasaprag-
made statement. Overt support for reform
in Eastern Europe usually has had little
effect—and may indeed render a disservice
to the very movements it seeks to foster.
One problem for the United States is that
it lacks genuine economic clout in Eastern
Europe. Because of the Reagan administra-
tion’s restrictive stance on technology
transfers, East-bloc countries have largely
On the farm: Technology has advanced, but old ways die hard
CARLOS FREIRE
written off the United States as an ally in
their struggle for industrial modernization.
One thing the Americans can do, however,
is to give favorable consideration to coun-
tries that have decent human-rights records
or semi-independent foreign policies. That
technique infuriates the Soviets and greatly
encourages the satellites. But there are lim-
its to the effectiveness of differentiation, and
there are some risks as well. Vice President
George Bush caused a storm of criticism
across the East bloc last September when he
lavished praise on Romania because of
Ceausescu’s independent foreign policy.
The Hungarians, in particular, were out-
raged to be mentioned in the same breath as
the Stalinist Romanians.
Fragile Ties: Erich Honecker has justified
his advances to West Germany on the
ground that they might lead to a reversal of
Bonn’s support for new NATO missile de-
ployment. The argument is not entirely fan-
ciful. A sudden relaxation of tensions be-
tween East and West Europeans would
undoubtedly boost the Western peace
movement, especially in West Germany,
Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. And it
could impel such fringe NATO allies as
Greece, Denmark and Spain to loosen their
fragile ties to the alliance.
The West may have the opportunity to
exert some influence. To do so, Western
policymakers will have to accept Eastern
Europe for what it is and is becoming—a
patchwork of very different countries at
widely varying stages of economic and po-
litical development. The West can also en-
courage the very strong European sense of
identity in all the Soviet satellite countries.
America’s allies can serve themselves and
the alliance alike by building bridges to
those Europeans in the East. Washington
can speed up that process by compromising
somewhat on the flow of nonmilitary tech-
nology. A. stronger Eastern Europe will be a
far greater headache for Moscow than for
the West.
Regardless of what the West
does, the East Europeans are sure
to go on testing the limits of Mos-
cow’s forbearance. The Kremlin,
and in some cases the local com-
munist parties, will do their best to
stem the tide. Some kind of crack-
down on the Hungarian economic
experiment or on Ceausescu’s for-
eign-policy vagaries is almost in-
evitable. But the conditions that
have nurtured change in Eastern
Europe can hardly be altered now.
The region is deeply involved in a
world economy. Its people have
achieved a standard of living that
can only prompt them to demand
more. The maturing of the com-
munist system has exposed its
limits and its vulnerability. The
people in Eastern Europe have
regained a sense of self —and the
desire to face the future on
their own.


BRITAIN
The Agonizing Aftermath
It was a lovely morning and the sun was
streaming through the stained-glass win-
dows onto some flowers, and it occurred to
me that this was a day I was not meant to see.
Margaret Thatcher went to church on
the Sunday after terrorists bombed
the hotel in Brighton where she was staying.
It was only then, she said, that she compre-
hended “the enormity of what happened”
days earlier, and how close the Irish Repub-
lican Army had come to murdering her and
much of her government. Not everyone at
the Grand Hotel survived, and Thatcher
was moved to reflect on those
who were killed in the blast.
“There are some of my dearest
friends who are not seeing this
day,” the prime minister said
quietly.
Last week Britons mourned
the dead, soothed the injured
and, most of all, wondered how
such a thing had happened. In
Brighton, police investigators
sifted through the rubble of the
hotel, where four people were
killed and 34wereinjured. Brit-
ish authorities say that the
bomb contained about 20
pounds of Frangex, a commer-
cial explosive made only in Ire-
land, and that it was hidden
behind the paneling in the bath-
room of room 629. Evidence
has been hard to come by, how-
ever. Cmdr. William Huck-
lesby, chief of Scotland Yard’s
antiterrorist squad, says the
search for clues is “a race
against time.” Tons of debris
from the hotel are now rain-
soaked, and clouds of danger-
ous asbestos dust from the
damaged boiler room have oc-
casionally forced workers to
break off their search. New
cracks have also appeared in
the facade of the 122-year-old
building, causing some to won-
der if it can be restored.
False Lead: British authori-
ties appear to be having no
better luck in their search for
the IRA bombers responsible
for the attack. At one point
last week police issued a de-
scription of a possible suspect
who they said had been seen
carrying a metal camera case
into room 629 three days be-
fore the bomb blast. But fur-
ther investigation showed that
to be a false lead. Police de-
tained and questioned—but fi-
nally released —at least two
men since the bombing. To date, they have
charged no one.
While the British government has
stepped up security, Thatcher’s advisers
and the prime minister herself seem reluc-
tant to resort to the sort of elaborate pro-
tective measures that surround many other
government leaders. Thatcher has main-
tained that the hotel was adequately
guarded during the week of the Conserva-
tive Party conference. “No matter how
many police, no matter how much equip-
ment they have,” she said, “there is always
something that will get through.” Few

changes of any kind were in evidence last
week at the prime minister’s office and
residence at 10 Downing Street. There
were no additional policemen, no metal
detectors, no searches of visitors, and only
the usual flimsy waist-high fence stood
between the building and the street. “To-
tal, impregnable security,’’ Deputy Prime
Minister Lord Whitelaw told the House of
Lords last week, "is not compatible with
the free society we enjoy.”
The terrorist attack has dredged up an-
other controversial issue in British politics:
the death penalty, which was abolished in
Britain in 1965. Tory M.P. Peter Bruinvels
is leading the fight for its reinstatement,
and he plans to introduce legislation when
the House of Commons returns to session.
But even with the impetus provided by the
bombing, those who want to
bring back the death penalty
appear to have little chance of
carrying the day. Parliament
overwhelmingly voted down
the death penalty just last
year, even for terrorists who
kill. And despite Thatcher’s
support, many conservative
Tories are likely to vote
against a bill that could make
martyrs of convicted IRA
guerrillas.
Pit Deputies: The bombing
will not soon be forgotten, but
the government has already
turned its attention to other
pressing problems. Last week
leaders of the nation’s 17,000-
member pit-deputies union
broke off talks with the Nation-
al Coal Board and voted to join
the eight-month-old coal min-
ers’ strike by the end of this
week if no progress was made.
The pit deputies, who supervise
the safety of the country’s 175
mines, have stayed clear of the
bitter strike up to this moment.
By staying on the job they have
helped maintain production of
some 500,000 tons of coal a
week from pits where miners
are crossing picket lines. A
walkout now by the pit deputies
would immediately close every
one of the country’s mines,
endangering the country’s en-
ergy supply just before win-
ter. If they do walk out, and
if transportation workers re-
fuse to move coal stockpiles
already above ground, the gov-
ernment may have to start cut-
ting some power next month —
which could mean a cold winter
in Britain.
A walkout would give Ar-
thur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Minework-
ers, an added bargaining chip
in his battle to prevent the


Coal Board from closing 20 unprofitable
mines and laying off up to 20,000 miners.
In 1974 a mine workers’ strike cut energy
supplies to the point where Tory Prime
Minister Edward Heath put the country
on a three-day workweek. In an attempt to
settle the issue, Heath called an early elec-
tion —which he lost. The circumstances
are different now. Public-opinion polls
show that the violent strike is highly un-
popular among the British people, and that
they largely blame it on Scargill and the
union. Nevertheless, no government —not
even the Iron Lady’s—wants to run the
risk of that kind of confrontation.
A new round of price cuts on the oil
market delivered a second blow to
Thatcher’s economic program. Norway
started the move when it lowered the
price of its North Sea oil by about $1.50
a barrel. The British National Oil Corp.
was forced to follow suit and dropped its
North Sea price by $1.35. The announce-
ment sent the British pound into a tail-
spin; it hit a record low of $l.lB. The
prospects of lower government oil rev-
enues and a sagging currency shook the
stock market, where the leading index fell
a record 27.9 points on Wednesday. Dr.
Paul Neild, chief economist at the broker-
age house of Phillips and Drew, said there
had been too much negative news for the
market to bear. "The markets could have
withstood either the pit deputies’ decision
or the oil-price cut,” Neild said. “But with
both coming together things are looking
very bleak.”
Far more bleak is the prospect of height-
ened activity by the IRA. Last week the
“routine” terror continued in Northern
Ireland. Two persons, one of them a Brit-
ish soldier, were killed on Friday in sepa-
rate shoot-outs. They will certainly not be
the last to die.
WILLIAM BURGER with TONY CLIFTON in London
The Attack Was a Boost to Morale’
Adams: ‘I presume the IRA will view any British minister as a legitimate target ’
Gerry Adams is the president of Sinn
Fein, the legal political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, and a British M.P. —
though he has never taken his seat in what
he regards as a foreign parliament. Last
week he discussed the IRA bombing with
Newsweek’s Tony Clifton. Excerpts:
CLIFTON: Who were the targets of the
bombers, and was it counted as a success,
since no ministers were killed?
ADAMS: I should think it was obvious
that the target was the British cabinet; the
IRA have said this was the case. I think
the shock waves that have followed testify
to its success.
Q. How would you justify the killing of
two nonpolitical victims
A. I have never attempted to justify
civilian casualties. It is regrettable that
anyone was killed, but the responsibility
lies with the British government, which
can end this war at any time.
Q. How did the Catholic minority in
Ulster react to the attack?
A. Nationalist reaction was one of un-
derstanding. The attack was a boost
to the morale of those who suffer
every day from British oppression.
Many people would consider it justifi-
able, considering British actions. Nu-
merous British atrocities, like the recent
murder of John Downes [an unarmed
protester killed by police] are fresh in
people’s minds.
Q. Does the bombing help Sinn Fein
politically or hinder it?
A. The bombing will make very little
difference, although I would expect an
increase in British oppression against
Sinn Fein, and Republicans in general.
There is also the danger that the British
will seek vengeance.
Q. You have been elected to Parliament.
How would you justify the use of bombing
to effect political change? The charge is
that the bombing was an attack on
democracy.
A. The British government has no re-
spect for democracy in Ireland. By their
partition of Ireland, and the maintenance
of the colony [Ulster], the British govern-
ment deny democracy to the people of
Ireland. That is why I say the Brighton
attack was the inevitable result of the
British presence in Ireland.
Q. Do yon believe that Prime Minister
Thatcher is a special target of the IRA ?
A. I would imagine that Margaret
Thatcher, while universally detested by
nationalist people, is no more of a target
than any other British prime minister, or
member of the British cabinet, past or
present. While the British and their forces
remain in Ireland, I presume the IRA
will view any British minister as a legiti-
mate target.
Q. How would you describe the
bombers?
A. Those involved in the Brighton op-
eration were freedom fighters trying to
seize Irish independence and national
determination from a government de-
termined to withhold them from the
Irish people.
Q. Was this bombing part of a long-term
campaign?
A. The IRA have said that they envis-
age a long war, so I would presume
the attack was part of a long-term
campaign against the British occupation
of [Ulster],
Q. What would happen if hanging were
reintroduced for “terrorist” crimes, as
many Tory M.P. ’s are now demanding?
A. You must understand that capital
punishment has been in use by the British
in Ireland for a very long time, in the form
of the “shoot to kill” policy [against sus-
pects] and in the use of plastic bullets.
Therefore the introduction of hanging
would make very little difference to the
daily facts of life.

thirty years has changed
the way the world dresses.
Your name’s Pierre Cardin.
You’ve just bought Maxim’s in Paris,
possibly the world’s most famous and
exclusive restaurant.
A thought strikes you.
Why not open a cheaper sister-
restaurant to Maxim’s?
Brilliant.
But what will you call this sister
restaurant.. .Max’s? Maxine’s? Maxelle’s?
As you ponder, you might let your
mind wander back over your career.
How you started at Christian Dior’s

How your bubble dresses triumphed
all over the world.
You smile as you remember the
shock you caused in haute couture circles
when you became the first top designer
to launch a ready-to-wear collection.
And then you had the nerve to open
ready-to-wear departments for both men
and women, bringing style and elegance
to people without limitless money,
particularly the young.
(Just as you hope to do with this
restaurant you’re trying to name.)
Then came those wonderful ’6o’s.
Your simple geometric shapes dom

WORLD BUSINESS
OPEC, Meet Adam Smith
The free market’s ‘invisible hand,’ rather than a cartel, now sets world oil prices.
Great Britain, welcome to the free mar-
ket for crude oil. Nigeria, say goodbye
to fixed “official” prices. Saudi Arabia, pre-
pare to relinquish your role as top dog in
world oil politics.
Never has it been quite so clear: the price
of oil is no longer determined by a wave of
the OPEC scepter but by the manipulations
of Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.” In star-
tling succession last week, three major oil-
producing nations cut their official prices to
match free-market quotations. Norway and
Great Britain, looking more like de facto
members of OPEC as they struggled for
months to prop up prices, caved in first.
Then Nigeria, a dues-paying member of the
cartel, reduced its prices, undercutting Brit-
ain in the process. But even reductions in
posted prices seemed too little, too late: in
the spot market, prices for British and Ni-
gerian oil quickly fell anew, pushing the free
market well below the new official rates —
and leading to speculation that an all-out
run on oil prices was at hand.
That prospect dismayed oil-producing
countries —the British pound fell to an all-
time low —and major petroleum companies
as well. But Wall Street’s hopes for lower
fuel prices helped spark a sharp rally in stock
prices. OPEC immediately called a special
meeting for next week to plot new strategy.
Mani bin Said al Oteiba, oil minister for the
United Arab Emirates, said the cartel would
“try to defend the market by all ways and
means, even if it means reducing national
quotas and the official [price] ceiling.”
The fact that OPEC was reacting rather
than dictating says a lot about how the oil
market has changed. For the better part of a
decade, oil supplies were tight and the oil
companies were virtual beggars at the
OPEC throne. But in recent years, recession
and conservation have reduced oil con-
sumption (chart) and contributed, along
with increased exploration by non-OPEC
nations, to a buildup of inventories and a
huge surplus in worldwide crude-produc-
tion capacity; now the major companies can
shop for bargains on the spot market, where
prices reflect true supply and demand.
Freedom ofAction: Today once-treasured
long-term contracts to buy OPEC oil are so
loaded with loopholes that they can be set
aside at will —and, in effect, are little more
than insurance policies that the majors can
get oil in a pinch. In fact, many prices fixed
in these contracts are adjusted periodically
to reflect spot-market conditions. “We are
moving away from the contract world to one
where you just buy what you need at a
market price,” says John Lichtblau, presi-
dent of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation. The spot market once handled
no more than about 5 percent of all world oil
trading, basically sopping up whatever oil
wasn’t subject to contract deals. Today it’s
estimated that the market accounts for 25
percent to 40 percent of total trading.
A precise figure is difficult to determine:
the spot market is not an actual place, like a
stock exchange, where bid and ask prices are
matched and volumes are tabulated. Rath-
er, it is more analogous to the over-
the-counter stock market —with dealers,
brokers and oil-company representatives
from around the world contacting each oth-
er by phone or telex to trade oil cargoes.
Changes within the oil industry have con-
tributed to the market’s popularity. With oil
profit margins squeezed, each separate divi-
sion of a major oil company is pressured to
cut costs. A refining subsidiary, for in-
stance, often can do so by bidding for low-
cost crude supplies on the spot market rath-
er than buying from the producing entity
of its own company. OPEC members them-
selves abet the market’s growth by selling oil
there when they can’t peddle it at official
prices. The producer countries also generate
spot-market activity indirectly when they
barter oil for jet planes or weapons: the
recipient company usually converts the oil
to cash by selling it on the spot market.
Despite the current downward pressure
on the spot market, few experts are predict-
ing a crash in crude-oil prices. Theodore
Eck, chief economist for Standard Oil Co. of
Indiana, believes that right now the world is
consuming more oil than it is producing—


and the winter heating-oil season is about to
begin. Eck and other oil insiders are more
inclined to think that last week’s dust-up on
prices had more to do with an aberration on
the official OPEC price list than with
the current supply of crude. Ironically,
while the price of low-sulfur “light” oil—
the mainstay grade for Norway, Britain and
Nigeria—has been declining, the price of
“heavy” oils, with large sulfur content, has
been strong. Arabian heavy, for one, is sell-
ing on the spot market at a premium over the
official price.
Refinery Conversion: The anomaly re-
sults from changing oil-industry tactics in
recent years. The major oil companies had
always preferred light oil because their re-
fineries could “crack” it into a higher pro-
portion of high-priced products (gasoline
and jet fuel) than they could with heavy oil.
But sensing a scarcity of light crude and also
looking for ways to cut refining costs, the
majors spent billions of dollars to convert
refineries to handle lower-priced heavy
crude. Chevron, for instance, spent $1.3
billion to overhaul its Pascagoula, Miss.,
refinery. In 1980, only 22 percent of the
crude running through the noncommunist
world’s refineries was heavy oil; today the
figure is 30 percent and climbing. Still,
OPEC’s official price differentials have nev-
er reflected that fact. Arabian heavy oil is
still listed at $3 a barrel lower than Arabian
light, even though the differential on the
spot market last week was less than $ 1.
OPEC members have reacted to market
conditions in part by changing the mix of
crudes they offer. Saudi Arabia once sold
cargoes made up of 60 percent light oil,
20 percent medium-grade and 20 percent
heavy; it now offers a “cocktail” made up of
40 percent light, 25 percent medium and 35
percent heavy. The problem for the oil pro-
ducers is that while countries like Saudi
Arabia and Mexico have plenty of heavy oil
to meet the new demand, others do not —
and they can’t replace revenues lost because
of the declining demand for light crude.
While few experts foresee a sharp price
tumble, most agree that the market’s basic
North Sea oil rig: Britain and Norway bow to a new reality—but will consumers benefit?
outlook remains bearish. William Randol,
an oil analyst for First Boston Corp., says
prices in the months ahead will be de-
pressed by slower economic growth, in-
creased production by the new Canadian
government and the increasing export of
finished oil products from new refineries in
the Mideast. Most expect the price of Ara-
bian light, OPEC’s “benchmark” crude, to
keep fading until it reaches a real market
price of about $25 a barrel. Currently, the
crude sells on the spot market for about

$27, while the official price remains at $29.
The public stands to gain little from a
continuing decline of crude prices, howev-
er. In the United States, heavy competition
has already reduced product prices by sev-
eral cents a gallon and refiners are likely to
use any break they get on crude prices to
improve profit margins. Elsewhere, prices
are actually rising. Since oil is sold for dol-
lars and the dollar has been amazingly
strong, the International Energy Agency
says that the cost of oil for European nations
rose 9 percent in the second quarter; in
Japan, the price increased 8 percent.
Credibility: OPEC, of course, will do
what it can to stem the overall price decline.
The cartel may want to keep its official
prices intact to save face, but it must at least
adjust the differentials between light and
heavy oil to reality. And if it is to retain its
credibility, it will have to lower its produc-
tion levels to assure that the total floating
supply of oil remains fairly tight. That’s a
tall order —Nigeria already wants to in-
crease its quota to offset its new lower
prices. OPEC may avert disaster but still
come out a loser. The fact that the cartel has
to meet at all shows that the real power to set
oil prices is moving from OPEC’s closed-
door sessions to the open play of the market.

WORLD BUSINESS
A Touch of 'Made in America'
For more than a decade, the good-old-
American Arrow shirt increasingly has
been made abroad: 90 percent of the sport
shirts sold under the label have been pro-
duced in places like Hong Kong, Taiwan
and South Korea. The brand’s manufactur-
er, New York-based Cluett, Peabody Co.,
had little alternative; wages for Asian fac-
tory workers were just a fraction of those in
the United States—and an influx of cheap
foreign-made garments threatened to ruin
U.S. companies unless they contracted out
work overseas. But with rising Asian wages,
high shipping costs and long production
schedules, Cluett, Peabody’s patience was
eventually frayed. When it turned to a con-
sultant for help, the advice was simple: ret-
rofit U.S. plants with state-of-the-art tech-
nology—and bring some business home.
Cluett, Peabody followed that counsel;
since 1979, it has shifted some of its produc-
WHY THE YANKEE GOES HOME
Asian labor still comes relatively cheap but hourly wage rates there
have increased sharply—and many American companies have
returned production to highly automated U.S. plants.
BOB CONRAD
tion back to the United States. Now the
company isn't the only one returning to its
roots. The Delco Electronics Division of
General Motors has brought much of its
semiconductor and car-radio production
back from Singapore and Mexico, and Gor-
ham, a division of Textron Inc., has repatri-
ated some stainless-steel flatware produc-
tion from Japan. American businesses are
hardly abandoning their Pacific Basin oper-
ations wholesale, but for individual compa-
nies in certain industries, the decision to
bring back manufacturing—and some
jobs—makes both dollars and sense.
There are many reasons for the shift. The
tensions of operating in some countries have
turned out to be greater than some compa-
nies bargained for: in 1982, for example,
Control Data Corp. shut down a plant in
South Korea after striking workers seized
American executives and held them hos-
tage. Companies like Motorola, Inc., have
objected to high transportation costs; still
others are frustrated by their lack of control
over production overseas. Henry Henley
Jr., Cluett, Peabody’s chairman, says he is
also irritated that his Asian contractors per-
form work for Arrow's American competi-
tors —“all in the same room at the same
time,” he says. “That makes me feel that I
don't have the control over my product that
I feel is absolutely necessary.”
Closing the Gap: But most
companies are migrating back
because of changes in labor and
technology. As foreign wages
have increased in recent years
(chart), the gap between Asian
and American wages has nar-
rowed; according to a study by
Wharton Econometric Fore-
casting Associates, average
hourly industrial wage rates in
1973 ranged from 28 cents in
South Korea to 74 cents in Sin-
gapore, but a decade later had
climbed as high as $1.42 to
$2.19. What’s more, the use of
robots and computer-aided de-
sign and manufacturing tech-
niques in the United States has
dramatically cut dependence
on labor. In its American
plants, Arrow now uses com-
puters to design patterns for
men’s shirts and sophisticated
new stitching equipment to as-
semble the garments. As a re-
sult, while it was once 25 per-
cent cheaper to make a basic
white shirt abroad than in the
United States, the gap has now
narrowed to 10 percent.
Many companies say that
the convenience of having
plants in America offsets whatever cost dif-
ferences remain. Sophisticated technology
demands plenty of electricity, and black-
outs are still common in many less-devel-
oped countries in Asia. Some U.S. compa-
nies, moreover, have adopted the “just in
time” system of keeping inventories low to
cut expenses. As a result, assembly lines
must be located as close as possible to com-
panies’ suppliers—and that often means in
U.S. semiconductor plant: Assuring quality
the United States. Finally, the need for
high-quality products has taken on new
importance, particularly in computer chips
and consumer electronics. Some companies
think it’s far easier to assure quality when
production takes place at home.
Bringing industry back to America may
raise employment, but just how much is an
open question. Employment in the electron-
ics industry rose nearly 9 percent from
March 1983 to March 1984, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics; Mark Ro-
senker of the Electronic Industries Associ-
ation says that at least some of the increase
appears to be a result of production return-
ing home. But in the apparel industry em-
ployment has been flat —and despite the
tightening of quotas by the Reagan adminis-
tration, imports are actually on the rise.
According to Walter Mankoff, a spokes-
man for the International Ladies’ Garment
Workers’ Union, apparel imports rose 27
percent in the first eight months of this year.
“For each producer who shifts work back
home,” he says, “10 are going overseas.”
Stability and Health: Other experts agree
that migration back home is likely to remain
a trickle. Richard Buczynski, head of
Wharton Econometrics’ Pacific Basin Serv-
ice, thinks that Asia will continue to draw
manufacturers: most Asian countries are
relatively stable politically and economical-
ly healthy—and are automating quickly.
What’s more, he adds, given the prospects
for the strength of the dollar, many compa-
nies will continue to get more bang for their
buck by buying materials and labor abroad.
“We’ll never be able to bring every job back
here,” agrees the electronics association's
Rosenker. But the fact that some companies
have come home at all is a welcome surprise.

Europe’s Sad
Wine Harvest
Rain, hail and frosty weather have bat-
tered most of Europe recently, and a
result has been one of the saddest wine
harvests in recent memory. From the Ital-
ian Piedmont to France’s Bordeaux, from
the Rhone Valley to the Rhine, the 1984
vintage is likely to be lackluster in both
quality and quantity. An
llth-hour bit of sunshine
last week may have rescued
Europe’s vineyards from
an outright disaster. But
production will be off by
roughly half from last year’s
spectacular crop. For the
world’s wine drinkers, that
will mean higher prices.
“You’ll see a price explo-
sion,” says Lucien Dieg, a
wine dealer in Burgundy.
“Beaujolais is going up
by 15 to 40 percent, Chablis
by 25 percent and Cote d’Or
by 50 percent.”
Wine-growers in France
sensed a catastrophe as ear-
ly as May, when a frigid
spring nipped the country’s vines in the bud
and prevented many from flowering. The
cold snap wiped out the merlot grapes of
Bordeaux, the country’s most celebrated
wine district, and chateaus such as Cheval
Blanc and Ausone in St. Emilion and Petrus
in Pomerol expect little, if any, production
this year. The devastation was not as drastic
elsewhere, but few vineyards can expect a
vintage crop. Frost and hail have destroyed
almost half of the harvest in the Piedmont,
home of the barolo and the barbera, and in
West Germany one resident says that the
grapes are unfit even for birds. “They would
break their beaks,” he says.
Bringing in the grapes in Burgundy: Miserable weather takes its toll
There are some bright spots in the pic-
ture. Baron Philippe de Rothschild, pro-
ducer of the famous Chateau Mouton Roth-
schild Bordeaux, says that the quality of his
crop is “not as bad as we feared.” In south-
ern France, some experts say that the wines
have actually improved; the lack of sun-
shine has lowered their normally harsh al-
cohol and acid content and has given them a
more mellow taste.
Europe’s growers also point out that the
harvest is not yet over, and a few weeks of
sun could still rescue what remains of their
crop. In the meantime, officials in hard-hit
regions of West Germany and French Al-
sace have asked the European Commission
to relax its rules on “liquid sweetening.”
That process allows winemakers to ferment
their grapes artificially by augmenting them
with sugar to increase their alcohol content.
Two weeks ago the commission complied—
despite the fact that the Common Market is
still struggling to dispose of the “sea of
wine” left over from the record harvests of
1982 and 1983. Neither the Alsatians nor
the Germans are willing to predict how
much that will help. More rain or an early
frost could still turn a near-disaster into a
complete disaster.

A Walkout Spreads South
The auto industry is still not quite in gear. The United Auto
Workers recently came to terms with General Motors and then
Ford in some of the smoothest negotiations in years. But last
week 36,000 GM workers in Canada walked off their jobs,
beginning a strike that could affect a dozen GM plants in the
United States and lead to the layoff of as
many as 30,000 UAW workers.
Unlike the domestic union, which made
job security a higher priority than wages,
the Canadians are focusing on the pay-
check, demanding an annual base pay in-
crease of 3 percent in each of the next three
years. GM has made an offer similar to the
American agreement: a raise in base pay of
2.25 percent the first year with lump sum
payments of 2.25 percent in years two and
BEV MACKENZIE— WINDSOR SJAR-AP
three. (Lump sum payments are less costly to the company
because they do not increase overtime and benefit levels.) The
Canadians are also seeking reinstatement of the nine paid
holidays they gave up in 1982. That issue didn’t arise in
the U.S. talks.
The UAW leadership in Detroit is pressuring the Canadian
unit to settle quickly. Many of GM’s American manufacturing
plants depend on parts made in Canada. On Friday GM told
workers at a small-truck plant in Moraine,
Ohio, not to show up Monday because of a
lack of V-6 engines; three other plants
have also been affected. Ironically, GM’s
adoption of a Japanese strategy has made
the automaker more vulnerable to the
strike. GM is using the “just in time”
inventory control system, which calls for
eliminating parts stockpiles to cut ware-
housing costs and increase manufacturing
flexibility.


FASHION
Clashing With Convention
The fashion buzzword for fall was
androgyny. At the spring/summer
ready-to-wear collections that kicked off in
Milan a fortnight ago and moved on to Paris
last week, the emerging theme was the “new
femininity.” But the Jean-Paul Gaultier
show —the hottest of the season —suggest-

The layered look: Mocking a man's suit
PHOTOS BY GEORGE SMITH—VISUALIZING
ed yet another alternative. The
colossal head shots stationed
above the runway—half boy,
half girl, in identical glasses
and ties —provided the first
hint. Then the models came
into view—men in sarongs or
trouser skirts, women in lay-
ered vests and jackets that
made a mockery of the tradi-
tional man’s suit —and re-
moved all doubt. This was
cross-dressing, couture style.
Gaultier, 32, is high fash-
ion’s latest bad boy, a quirky,
talented designer who trans-
forms the rags of bag ladies and
street urchins into humorous,
richly textured and, needless to
say, expensive ($B4O for a
sweater) clothes. Foremost
among his iconoclastic beliefs
is that men and women can
dress alike and still look differ-
ent. “Masculinity is not a ques-
tion of a skirt or a trouser,” he
says. “It is in the head.” His
fashion shows are theatrical
events that invariably attract
hordes of groupies and serious
buyers as well; his more cele-
brated fans include Isabelle Adjani, David
Bowie and Prince. Often, he uses amateur
models because they are more natural than
professionals. “He puts clothes together in a
bizarre way to show that fashion need not be
taken too seriously,” says Dawn Mello,
president of Bergdorf Goodman, which last
month presented Gaultier’s fall line in a
circus tent in lower Manhattan.
‘Fun’: For such an original, Gaultier in-
vites plenty of comparisons. His playful ir-
reverence reminds some observers of a
young Kenzo. For others, his creativity and
deft tailoring hold the promise of an Yves
Saint Laurent. “People thought Saint Lau-
rent was crazy at first because he was so
daring,” says stylist Cathy Lempert. “Now
Gaultier, too, is creating a li-
brary for other designers.” Sev-
eral recent trends —notably,
clashing paisleys with plaids
and layering cropped jackets
over longer shirts —began on
hisdrawingboard. “Heisoneof
the biggest influences in ready
to wear,” says Vogue fashion
editor Polly Mellen. “In the
shows, he takes on an eccentric
quality but underneath the fun
and games, there are real
clothes, wonderful clothes.”
Gaultier was born to middle-
class French parents, but
weaned on more exotic stuff: as

BERNARD GOTFRYD— NEWSWEEK
Playful: ‘Beneath the games are wonderful clothes'
a child, he lived for a time with his grand-
mother, a faith healer and fortune teller
whom he credits with forming his odd sensi-
bility. By the time he was 15, Gaultier was
drawing his own haute couture collections,
writing glowing reviews of them for his pri-
vate amusement. (“It was a very Parisian
collection and we loved it.”) On his 18th
birthday, Pierre Cardin, to whom he had
submitted some sketches, offered Gaultier a
job. After a brief stint chez Cardin and sever-
al years at Jean Patou, Gaultier struck out on
his own, staging shows with characteristic
outrageousness: at one, he had Edwige, a
reigning Paris punk, dress up in ostrich
feathers and vinyl to sing a wicked parody of
Frank Sinatra’s hit “My Way.”
It was an apt anthem for a
designer who finds convention-
al good taste depressing. “I
prefer something awful to
nothing,” says Gaultier. “Peo-
ple, even if they have no mon-
ey, should be individualistic.”
There are limits, of course, and
most men will no doubt place
them at the knee. But even if
Gaultier never gets men to
wear skirts, at least he’s added a
new dimension to that tired old
debate over what length they
should be.

DISCOVER
THAILAND
THE MOST EXOTIC
COUNTRY
IN ASIA


The Most
Exotic Destination
From first arrival, Thailand
confronts the visitor with
a multitude of images both
splendid and startling.
The country is blessed
with fine gifts of nature:
lush jungles in the moun-
tains of the north, fertile
green plains in the heart-
land, shimmering beaches
and arcadian islands in the
south.
And for five thousand
years rich civilizations
have existed under
Thailand’s tropical sun.
Because of its location at
the crossroads of Asia, the
area has experienced a
flux of cultures from India,
China, Burma, Malaya and
Indo-China.
All have left their traces,
but by far the most impor-
tant are the Buddhist reli-
gion, and a naturally toler-
ant attitude in the people.
Around the beginning of
the twelfth century, a
group called the Thai Noi
moved down from Yun-
nan Province in China to
settle on the northern
plains. Based around a city
called Sukhothai, their cul-
ture developed a unique
character that became the
foundation of modern
Thailand.
The Thai people reflect
the traditions of their
exquisite, centuries-old
culture. Despite adopting
some Western dress styles
and technologies, they
proudly retain their own
ways, their own identity.
That’s just one of the
reasons why Thailand is
among the great travel
destinations of the world.
Visitors have always
been enchanted by the
beauty of the land, capti-
vated by the serene grace
of the people and their
friendliness.
Thai cultural achieve-
ments have a special attrac-
tion, from the spectacular
flowerings of architecture
and sculpture, through the
intricate beauty of Thai
music and dance, to the
accomplished splendour
of the weaving, carving,
metalwork and other
handicrafts.
The Warmest
Hospitality
Hospitality is a major fac-
tor in the success of any
holiday, and no people are
more warmly hospitable
than the Thai.
Two of the sayings
you’ll hear most frequent-
ly are “maipen rai” - it
doesn’t matter - and “sanuk ”
- to enjoy or have fun.
This is how the Thai
people like visitors to
experience their land:
relax, enjoy, have fun.
And while you’re in
their country, they’ll do
everything they can to
make sure that your stay is
everything you want it to
be.
For example, whatever
your accomodation needs
and tastes, you’ll find
them well covered in vir-
tually every part of Thai-
land.
And although the Thais
are justifiably proud of
their own fine cuisine,
you’ll have no trouble
finding restaurants that
serve good Western food.
But be certain not to
miss the great tastes and
sensations of Thai cook-


ing. The seafood is at least
the equal to any in the
world, the fruits are a
mouthwatering delight,
and the spiced dishes offer
a vast spectrum of taste
surprises. If you like your
food hot, watch out for
the potent green and
yellow peppers!
With your every need
catered to by your friendly
hosts, you’re free to relax,
enjoy - and take in the
rich variety of experiences
this land has to offer.
Bangkok
As heir to the great heri-
tage of Thailand’s past, the
city contains many of the
finest achievements of
Thai culture.
Most outstanding is the
Grand Palace and the
adjoining Temple of the
Emerald Buddha, one of
the great architectural
wonders of Asia. It was
built by King Rama 1, and
completed in 1785.
Nearby is the National
Museum, a treasure house
full of art and artefacts
from Thailand’s rich
history.
All around the city are
the beautiful temples -
called Wats - of Thailand’s
Buddhist religion. Places
of peace and serenity, vir-
tually all have something
to offer, be it fine architec-
ture, evocative paintings
and sculptures, fascinating
rituals or simply oases of
tranquillity.
Shopping Bargains
Shoppers always have a
great time in Bangkok.
Well known bargains are.
Thai silk, precious stones
and jewellery, but you’ll
find good value in many
other items. Traditional
handicrafts like wood-
carvings, silverware, Thai
dolls and temple rub-
bings are excellent buys,
along with modern items
like tailormade clothing -
you can still get a good
suit or dress made up in
twenty four hours - and
fine leatherware.
Good shopping venues
abound, from traditional
markets to massive
modern complexes, and
in many places bargaining
is an accepted practice.
It’s well worth making a
special shopping expedi-
tion to the Weekend Mar-
ket, an enormous bazaar
where you’ll find every-
thing from cut-price cloth-
ing to tropical fish on
sale.
And don’t miss the
Floating Market, where
Thai water dwellers
do their buying, selling
and trading. It means an
early morning trip, but
this is one of the truly
unique experiences of
Thailand.
To fully appreciate Bang-
kok, it’s essential to save
some energy for when the
sun goes down. From
superb restaurants to
swinging bars and discos,
Bangkok offers a nightlife
to please and delight
everyone.
Around Bangkok
Bangkok is the centre of
an alluvial plain so rich
and fertile that the visiting.
Europeans of the nine- /
teenth century referred to
it as “The Garden of Siam”)
A trip down any of the '
myriad canals that run
through this area provides
the ideal way to experi-
ence the beauty of rural
Thailand, and may well be
the highlight of your
entire stay.
Also near Bangkok are
two complexes that pro-
vide a good insight into
the traditional culture and
way of life of the country.
The Rose Garden has daily
presentations of Thai
dances and ceremonies, as
well as staging demonstra-
tions of age-old work rou-
tines - including elephants
in action! The Ancient City
is a vast area of private
parkland with replicas,
many full size, of Thai-
land’s most historic monu-
ments.


Beaches and Islands
Stretching out along the
Gulf of Thailand on the
east coast, and lapped by
the crystal waters of the
Andaman Sea on the west
coast, are 3,000 miles of
glistening beaches.
Most famous is Pattaya,
a comprehensive interna-
tional resort complex a
short drive to the south of
Bangkok. Here are clear,
quiet waters, miles of
sand, waving palms,
hotels for all budgets -
and a nightlife to rival the
big city.
But if you really want
your own private paradise,
you’ll love the idyllic
southern islands of Phuket
and Koh Samui.
Ancient Cities
Remnants of Thailand’s
long and glorious past are
everywhere throughout
the country, but none are
more impressive than the
mins of the old capitals
Sukhothai and Ayutthaya.
Sukhothai, deep in the
north-west, presided over
the birth of the first Thai
state in the twelfth centu-
ry. It was eclipsed by the
rise of Ayutthaya, but
Thais still nostalgically
regard its achievements as
the purest expression of
their culture.
Ayutthaya, near to Bang-
kok, was once a glittering
city that dominated the
whole region and awed
visitors from the courts of
Europe. When it was
sacked and burned by
invaders in 1762, much of
the priceless heritage of
the country was lost.
Chiang Mai
and The North
Chiang Mai is known as
“The Rose of The North ”.
Situated in a cool valley
800 kms. north-west of
Bangkok, visitors come to
enjoy its mild climate,
relaxed pace and friendly
people.
Though distinctly Thai,
the area has its own cultur-
al character. Look for the
Burmese influence in the
beautiful old wats (notably
Wat Prasingh, founded in
1345), visit the local vil-
lages specializing in fine
craftwork, or shop in the
markets for artefacts from
the region’s hilltribe
people.
Above all, Chiang Mai
possesses a special ambi-
ence and exerts a subtle
charm that leaves an
indelible impression on
the visitor.
Jungle Adventures
Thailand’s jungles offer
special adventure opportu-
nities for those who like
outdoor action.
Best known are the treks
into the highlands north
of Chiang Mai to visit the
colourful ethnic minority
groups known as the Hill-
tribe People.
A more leisurely experi-
ence is drifting on a spe-
cially constructed raft
down the River Kwai in
Kanchanaburi Province.
Or witness the extra-
ordinary spectacle of the
elephant roundup in
Surin.
Whatever you have in
mind for a holiday, you’ll
find it in Thailand - and
so much more.

DESIGN
A Marine Treasure Chest
If John Steinbeck returned to California’s
Cannery Row this week, he’d be pleased
to note that the old Hovden cannery sports a
fresh coat of paint and still hums with activ-
ity. On closer examination, however, the
author would detect a radical change: the
weathered gray building where sardines
once met their fate has been replaced by a
sleek sanctuary that glorifies fish, rather
than tins them.
The newly opened Monterey Bay Aquar-
ium is the most technically sophisticated
—and perhaps most esthetically success-
ful —public aquarium yet built, a fortunate
combination of superb setting, seven years’
planning, and 40 million high-tech dollars,
donated by David and Lucile Packard, of
the Hewlett-Packard computer empire.
This is the largest aquarium in the United
States, and it boasts a stunning centerpiece:
a huge tank, three stories tall, that is the first
to contain a living kelp forest —permitting
visitors to see a world previously accessible
only to adventurous divers.
Crescent-shaped Monterey Bay, two
hours south of San Francisco, is a popular
tourist stop that also happens to be one of
the richest marine environments on the Pa-
cific Coast. The reason is Monterey Can-
yon, an immense offshore trench so long
and deep that it could easily swallow the
Grand Canyon. Even if Monterey Bay dried
up tomorrow, notes Steven Webster, the
aquarium’s education director, tourists
would still visit. “Only instead of watching
sea otters,” he says, “they’d be riding mules
down that canyon.” As is, the canyon pro-
vides an “upwelling” of cold, nutrient-filled

water that supports an unusually wide
range of marine life —from shore birds to
sea lions, salmon to squid.
This is the aquarium’s purview, and
the open, airy three-story building devotes
separate areas to each of Monterey Bay’s
habitats, re-created with almost spooky
reality. A freshwater stream, surrounded by
aspens and filled with steelhead and salm-
on, actually meanders through
one wall and out onto an expan-
sive deck overlooking the bay.
Nearby, a long gallery contains
an open-air salt marsh, com-
plete with sand, shore birds,
and dune grasses. The intent,
explains aquarium director
Julie Packard (daughter of Da-
vid and Lucile), is to avoid dim
corridors and preset guided
tours: “Rather than the usual
experience of going from tank
to tank, this is more like actual-
ly wandering from one habitat
to another.”
Sharks: The aquarium de-
sign is understated in gray
tones, with stone flooring and
natural wood trim. “The ex-
hibits must come forward,”
says project manager Linda
Rhodes, and indeed, two huge
tanks, among the largest in the
world, dominate the building.
One contains a 90-foot-long
slice of Monterey Bay, from
deep reefs through sandy sea
floor, populated by sharks,
rays and salmon. Two circular
windows, each six feet across,
provide appropriately fisheyed
views of the entire tank. At one end stand
tall wooden pier pilings, recently re-
moved from a nearby wharf and encrusted
with 50 years of accumulated sealife.
Along the bottom are artificial rocks, new-
ly brought in from a year gaining veri-
similitude out on the real sea bottom.
Most spectacular, however, is the kelp-
forest tank, open to the sky and viewable
from three levels. Behind acrylic windows
(each weighing nearly three tons), lacy
brown kelp plants, the largest of their kind,
tower above visitors, waving gently in what
appear to be rhythmic tidal surges. In fact,
the hypnotic surge is artificial —generated
The kelp forest: Towering plants, artificial tides
by a motor-driven cylinder buried in the
rocks—and it provides more than mood.
Kelp can only take nourishment from
moving water, and have previously per-
ished in tanks.
The aquarium improves on nature in one
key respect. At night the tanks are filled
with unfiltered seawater, to provide neces-
sary nutrients; during the day, however, the
water is filtered, to provide clear viewing.
At a preview tour last week, a veteran scuba
diver stood transfixed in front of the kelp
tank as schools of shiny sardines, yellowtail
rockfish and iridescent sheepshead swam
amid the swaying forest. “It’s as if they took
the best day for diving in the last 10 years,”
she said, ‘‘and then put all the interesting
fish in one place.”
The aquarium’s high-tech genesis is evi-
dent everywhere. An award-winning heat
exchanger uses only ocean water to warm
and cool the building. Sophisticated plas-
tics are used throughout—even plastic
nuts and bolts —to prevent corrosion.
There is, however, one exception: the de-
signers refused to computerize the system
that provides seawater to the tanks. “It’s a
life-support system,” says Linda Rhodes,
“and we want to control it ourselves.”
What did computer mogul Packard say
about that? “Oh,” says Rhodes, “he under-
stood completely.”

INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS ORGANIZATION
CONCLUSIONS AND JUDGEMENT OF THE BRUSSELS
TRIBUNAL ON REAGAN’S FOREIGN POLICY
The International Conference on the Rea-
gan Administration’s Foreign Policy con-
vened in Brussels from 28—30 September,
1984 under the auspices of the Internatio-
nal Progress Organization. Reports were
submitted by international jurists and
foreign policy specialists on various aspects
of the Reagan Administration’s foreign
policy. Among the participants of the con-
ference were Sean Macßride (Nobel Peace
Laureate, Ireland), Prof. George Wald
(Nobel Laureate, Harvard University),
General Edgardo Mercado Jarrin (Peru),
General Nino Pasti (former Deputy
Supreme Commander of NATO) and Hor-
tensia Bussi de Allende (Chile). The reports
were presented before a Panel of Jurists
consisting of Hon. Farouk Abu-Eissa
(Sudan), Attorney, former Foreign Mini-
ster, Secretary-General of the Arab Law-
yers Union; Prof. Francis A. Boyle
(U.S.A.), Professor of International Law
from the University of Illinois, Chairman;
Dr. Hans Goeran Franck (Sweden), Attor-
ney, Member of the Swedish Parliament;
Hon. Mirza Gholam Hafiz (Bangladesh),
Former Speaker of the Bangladesh Parlia-
ment and currently a Senior Advocate of
Bangladesh Supreme Court; Hon. Mary
M. Kaufman (U.S.A.), Attorney-at-Law,
prosecuting attorney at the Nuremberg
War Crimes Trial against I. G. Farben; Dr.
Jean-Claude Njem (Cameroon), Assistant-
Professor at the Faculty of Law, Uppsala
University, and a Consultant of the
Government; Prof. Alberto Ruiz-Eldredge
(Peru), Professor of Law, former Presi-
dent of the National Council of Justice;
and Dr. Muemtaz Soysal (Turkey), Profes-
sor of Constitutional Law, University of
Ankara. An accusation against the interna-
tional legality of the Reagan Administra-
tion’s foreign policy was delivered by the
Honorable Ramsey Clark, former U.S.
Attorney General. The defense was presen-
ted by a legal expert of the Reagan Admini-
stration.
Based upon all the reports and documents
submitted and the arguments by the advo-
cates, the Brussels Panel of Jurists hereby
renders the following conclusions concer-
ning the compatibility of the Reagan
Administration’s foreign policy with the
requirements of international law:
A. Introduction
General Introduction. The Reagan Admi-
nistration’s foreign policy constitutes a
gross violation of the fundamental princi-
ples of international law enshrined in the
Charter of the United Nations Organisa-
tion, as well as of the basic rules of custo-
mary international law set forth in the
U.N. General Assembly’s Declaration on
the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the
Domestic Affairs of States and the Protec-
tion of Their Independence and Sove-
reignty (1965), its Declaration on Princi-
ples of International Law Concerning
Friendly Relations and Co-operation
Among States in Accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations (1970), and
its Definition of Aggression (1974), among
others. In addition, the Reagan Admini-
stration is responsible for complicity in the
commission of Crimes Against Peace, Cri-
mes Against Humanity, War Crimes and
grave breaches of the Third and Fourth
Geneva Conventions of 1949.
B. Western Hemisphere
Grenada. The Reagan Administration’s
1983 invasion of Grenada was a clearcut
violation of U.N. Charter articles 2 (3), 2
(4), and 33 as well as of articles 18, 20 and
21 of the Revised OAS Charter for which
there was no valid excuse or justification
under international law. As such, it consti-
tuted an act of aggression within the mea-
ning of article 39 of the United Nations
Charter.
Nicaragua. The Reagan Administration’s
policy of organizing and participating in
military operations by opposition contra
groups for the purpose of overthrowing the
legitimate government of Nicaragua viola-
tes the terms of both the U.N. and O.A.S.
Charters prohibiting the threat or use of
force against the political independence of
a state. The Reagan Administration has
flouted its obligation to terminate imme-
diately its support for the opposition contra
groups in accordance with the Interim
Order of Protection issued by the Interna-
tional Court of Justice on 10 May 1984.
International Court of Justice. The Panel
denounces the patently bogus attempt by
the Reagan Administration to withdraw
from the compulsory jurisdiction of the
International Court of Justice in the suit
brought against it by Nicaragua for the
purpose of avoiding a peaceful settlement
of this dispute by the World Court in order
to pursue instead a policy based upon mili-
tary intervention, lawless violence and
destabilization of the legitimate govern-
ment of Nicaragua.
Mining Nicaraguan Harbors. The Reagan
Administration’s mining of Nicaraguan
harbors violates the rules of international
law set forth in the 1907 Hague Convention
on the Laying of Submarine Mines, to
which both Nicaragua and the United Sta-
tes are parties.
h \
Nobel Laureate Sean Macßride addressing the
internation conference on Reagan’s Foreign Policy in
Brussels (28 September 1984)
C. Nuclear Weapons Policies
Arms Control Treaties. The Reagan
Administration has refused to support the
ratification of the Threshold Test Ban
Treaty of 1974, the Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty of 1976, and the SALT
II Treaty of 1979, in addition to renoun-
cing the longstanding objective of the U.S.
government to negotiate a comprehensive
test ban treaty. As such the Reagan admini-
stration has failed to pursue negotiations in
good faith on effective measures relating to
cessation of the nuclear arms race at an
early date and to nuclear disarmament as
required by article 6 of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty of 1968.
Pershing 2 Missiles. The deployment of
the offensive, first-strike, counterforce
strategic nuclear weapons system known as
the Pershing 2 missile in the Federal Repu-
blic of Germany violates the Non-Circum-
vention Clause found in article 12 of the
SALT II Treaty.
No-first-use. In accordance with U.N.
General Assembly Resolution 1653 of 24
November 1961, the panel denounces the
refusal by the Reagan Administration to
adopt a policy mandating the no-first-use
of nuclear weapons in the event of a con-
ventional attack as required by the basic
rule of international law dictating propor-
tionality in the use of force even for the
purposes of legitimate self-defense.
D. Middle East
Lebanon. For the part it played in the
planning, preparation and initiation of the
1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Rea-
gan Administration has committed a Crime
aga'inst Peace as defined by the Nuremberg
Principles. Likewise, under the Nuremberg
principles, the Reagan Administration
becomes an accomplice to the Crimes
against Humanity, War Crimes and Grave
Breaches of the Third and Fourth Geneva
Conventions of 1949 that have been com-
mitted or condoned by Israel and its allied
Phalange and Haddad militia forces in
Lebanon. Such complicity includes the
savage massacre of genocidal character of
hundreds of innocent Palestinian and
Lebanese civilians by organized units of the
Phalangist militia at the Sabra und Shatila
refugee camps located in West Beirut that
were then subject to the control of the
occupying Israeli army.
The Palestinian Question. The Reagan
Administration’s policy towards the Pale-
stinian people as well as the Reagan „Peace
Plan" of 1 September 1982 violates the
international legal right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination as recognized
by U.N. Charter article 1 (2). As recogni-
zed by numerous U. N. General Assembly
Resolutions, the Palestinian people have an
international legal right to create an inde-
pendent and sovereign state.
Israeli Settlements. The Reagan Admini-
stration’s declared position that Israeli sett-
lements in the Occupied Territories are
„not illegal" is a violation of U.S. obliga-
tions under article 1 of the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949 to ensure respect for
the terms of the Convention (here article
49) by other High Contracting Parties such
as Israel.
Libya. The Reagan Administration’s
dispatch of the U.S. Sixth Fleet into the
Gulf of Sidra for the purpose of precipita-
ting armed conflict with the Libyan
government constitutes a breach of the
peace under article 39 of the U.N. Charter.
The Reagan Administration’s policy to
attempt to destabilize the government of
Libya violates the terms of the United
Nations Charter article 2 (4) prohibiting
the threat or use of force directed against
the political independence of a state.
E. Africa, Asia and the Indian
Ocean
Apartheid. The Panel denounces the Rea-
gan Administration’s so-called policy of
“constructive engagement" towards the
apartheid regime in South Africa. This spe-
cious policy encourages discrimination and
oppression against the majority of the peo-
ple of South Africa; it hampers effective
action by the international community
against apartheid, and facilitates aggres-
sive conduct by the South African apar-
theid regime against neighbour states in
violation of the U.N. Charter. As such, the
Reagan Administration has become an
accomplice to the commission of the inter-
national crime of apartheid as recognized
by the universally accepted International
Convention on the Suppression and
Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of
1973.
Namibia. The Reagan Administration has
refused to carry out its obligations under
Security Council Resolution 435 (1978)
providing for the independence of Nami-
bia, as required by article 25 of the U.N.
Charter. The Reagan Administration has
no right to obstruct the achievement of
Namibian independence by conditioning it
upon or “linking" it to the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola in any way.
Both the U.N. General Assembly and the
Organization of African Unity have recog-
nized SWAPO as the legitimate representa-
tive of the Namibian people, and the Rea-
gan Administration is obligated to nego-
tiate with it as such.
Indian Ocean. The Reagan Administra-
tion’s-continued military'occupation of the
island of Diego Garcia violates the interna-
tional legal right of self-determination for
the people of Mauritius as recognized by
the United Nations Charter. The Reagan
Administration has accelerated the rapid
militarization of the U.S. naval base on
Diego Garcia as part of its plan to create a
jumping-off point for intervention by the
Rapid Deployment Force into the Persian
Gulf. As such the Reagan Administration’s
foreign policy towards the Indian Ocean
has violated the terms of the U.N. General
Assembly’s Declaration of the Indian
Ocean as a Zone of Peace (1971).
F. Conclusion
United Nations Action. From the fore-
going, it is clear that the Reagan Admini-
stration has substituted force for the rule
of international law in its conduct of
foreign policy around the world. It has
thus created a serious threat to the mainte-
nance of international peace and security
under article 39 of the United Nations
Charter that calls for the imposition of
enforcement measures by the U.N. Secu-
rity Council under articles 41 and 42. In the
event the Reagan Administration exercises
its veto power against the adoption of such
measures by the Security Council, the mat-
ter should be turned over to the U.N. Gene-
ral Assembly for action in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Uniting for
Peace Resolution of 1950. In this way the
Reagan Administration’s grievous interna-
tional transgressions could be effectively
opposed by all members of the world com-
munity in a manner consistent with the
requirements of international law.

TECHNOLOGY
Are VDT’s Health Hazards?
Measuring radiation from a VDT at Guy’s bioelectromagnetics lab: Dangers?
A decade ago the video-display terminal
(VDT) was an oddity in the work-
place; the low-tech typewriter was king.
Today there are more than 15 million
VDT’s in offices and factories in the United
States, and soon the glowing computer
screen may be as commonplace as the tele-
phone. From the beginnings of the age of the
electronic office, however, there have also
been complaints that VDT’s are harmful,
causing health problems ranging from eye-
strain and backaches to cataracts and mis-
carriages. Most experts have attributed the
problems to poor design of VDT’s and the
office environment and to the stress some
workers face using the machines; in a major
study last year of research into the potential
hazards, the National Research Council
concluded “VDT’s . . . are highly unlikely
to be hazardous.” Still, the questions per-
sist. “We don’t know if there are any long-
term health effects, such as reproductive
problems,” says Mark Pinsky of VDT
News, a newsletter covering VDT health
and safety topics. “That’s the wild card.”
So far the evidence is mixed. Researchers
have confirmed complaints of workers suf-
fering eyestrain, backache and other mus-
culoskeletal disorders from poorly adjusted
work stations. “There are enough studies —
between NIOSH [the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health], the Cana-
dian Labor Council and The Newspaper
Guild —that show there are clearly prob-
lems associated with the ergonomic aspects
of these machines,” says Dr. Arthur Frank,
chairman of the Department of Preventive
Medicine and Environmental Health at the
University of Kentucky.
But the issue of possible reproductive and
longer-term health problems is not as clear.
9 to 5, the National Association of Working
Women, set up a hot line for health com-
plaints from VDT operators and found a
high rate of reproductive problems; only 32
percent of pregnant callers reported normal
pregnancies. There have also been reports of
15 clusters in the United States, Canada and
Europe of problem pregnancies—where a
high percentage of VDT operators in a given
office suffered miscarriages and had chil-
dren with birth defects. “We aren’t saying
we have conclusive evidence on reproduc-
tive hazards,” says Karen Nussbaum, direc-
tor of 9 to 5. “But we don’t want to wait 20
years to find out we were right.”
Irons: Like television sets, VDT’s emit
low levels of nonionizing radiation, which
differs from the known hazards of ionizing
radiation like X-rays. VDT’s emit negligible
amounts of ionizing radiation, though color
screens emit somewhat higher levels. Most
experts believe that the very low levels of
radiation are harmless. “The measured lev-
els from VDT’s have been found to be less
than those emitted by hair dryers, irons and
other typical household appliances,” says
NIOSH director Dr. J. Donald Millar.
Moreover, VDT’s must comply with federal
standards. “Modern VDT’s, the ones that
have to pass FCC tests, are below even
the most conservative safety standards in
the world,” says Arthur Guy, director of the
Bioelectromagnetic Research Laboratory
at the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle.
In experiments that are attracting the
attention of researchers in the United States,
however, Dr. Jose Delgado, of the Centro
Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid, Spain,
studied the effects of very low levels of
pulsed magnetic fields on chick embryos.
Delgado, whose work was published in the
British Journal of Anatomy and reported in
the United States by VDT News, found that
the weak pulsed magnetic fields caused mal-
formations in the chick embryos. “The Del-
gado findings have some scientists excited
because of the similarities between his wave
shapes and [those produced by] VDT’s,”
says Guy. “But the Delgado research is
inconclusive.” Nonetheless, research is in-
tensifying because the experiments showed
biological effects at such low levels of mag-
netic fields. “Delgado’s effect,” says Guy,
“could apply to many other devices besides
just the VDT’s, any type of device that
produces interrupted magnetic fields.”
Those devices include such things as light
dimmers and TV sets.
Most modern VDT’s are shielded to cut
interference with other electronic equip-
ment; the shielding reduces some emissions.
“In our office,” says Guy, “the secretaries
watched me take measurements from the
machines, which are old and known for their
leakage. They asked how the levels could be
reduced. I told them Reynolds Wrap would
do it. The next thing I knew they had the
machines wrapped up.” Blocking the mag-
netic fields is more problematic. The manu-
facturers insist that there is no cause for
alarm, since alternating-current appliances
have been around for decades. “Low-fre-
quency pulsed radiation has existed in the
U.S. since about 1898 on a very substantial
basis,” says Vico Henriques, president of the
Computer and Business Equipment Manu-
facturers Association.
Stopwatch: There is no argument, how-
ever, that some VDT users experience high
levels of stress. A NIOSH study found that
full-time VDT operators had the highest
stress levels among workers —more stress
than air-traffic controllers. In part, that
may be due to the way the machines are
used; the computer can monitor every key-
stroke, like an electronic supervisor stand-
ing beside the worker all day with a stop-
watch. At a House Health and Safety
Subcommittee hearing in June, Rebecca Al-
ford, a VDT operator with Equitable Life
Assurance Society in Syracuse, N.Y., testi-
fied: “Electronic monitoring is one of the
most pernicious aspects of our jobs.. . .We
clock in at 7 a.m. and from then until the end
of the day the VDT is counting every key-
stroke. Managers have a complete readout
from which productivity is determined and
then averaged with subjective factors such
as attitude to determine our rate of pay.”
When reached by Newsweek, Equitable
had no comment.
Given the growing complaints about
VDT screens, NIOSH plans to do an exten-
sive three-year epidemiological study to de-
termine whether the worries about problem
pregnancies may be valid or simply statisti-
cal abnormalities. “Anything that involves
millions and millions of people should be
very carefully studied,” says Dr. Irving Seli-
koff of the Environmental Sciences Labora-
tory at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New
York. “It is not being adequately studied
now, but it will be.”

Beaches and Bruised Loves
Drewe: A skillful chronicler of a world inhabited by lonely, battered people
OLIVER STREWE
The Bodysurfers. By Robert Drewe. 165
pages. Faber and Faber. $6.95.
On a day in which a spilled cup of coffee
has been something of a high point, Austral-
ian architect David Lang decides to take
advantage of the “electric cleansing of the
surf.” He plunges into the waves at Bondi
Beach and is just starting to feel revitalized
when he is hit by a stingray. Stunned by the
enormity of the pain and upset that the surf
he reveres harbors a killer instinct, David
muses: “This country is world champion in
the venomous creatures department. The
box jellyfish. Funnel-web spiders. Stone-
fish. The tiny blue-ringed octopus . . . the
land and sea abound with evil stingers.”
In Robert Drewe’s powerful collection of
short stories, “The Bodysurfers,” his char-
acters repeatedly hurl themselves at life
and at lovers —only to be stung again and
again. In tales that chronicle the traumas
of the Lang family through three genera-
tions, Drewe nevertheless shows love to be
as expendable —or replenishable —as the
beer on tap at the local pub.
Americana: Although Drewe’s stories
are set primarily in Australia, the psychic
terrain —broken marriages, disintegrating
love affairs, troubled children —will be fa-
miliar to readers in any number of coun-
tries. Drewe’s Australia seems particularly
saturated by the American influence.
Stacks of old issues of The New Yorker
and The New York Review of Books clut-
ter the sunrooms of his characters’ homes,
and names like Sherry Lansing and Bob
Hope are dropped without embellishment.
There is something very poignant in
these stories. Yes, there is the colorful
backdrop of beaches where nude bathing is
popular, picnics are enjoyed on the sand
and exuberant surfers ride the waves. But
Drewe’s world is much more than that. It
is not just frolic; it is a world place princi-
pally populated by lonely, bruised people.
Perhaps it is the failed promise of the
beach paradise that heightens the charac-
ters’ inner turmoil, or perhaps it is simply
that Drewe is a skillful chronicler of
desperation.
Baby Oil: He has a shrewd eye for the
small hurts that, like the stingray’s poison,
foster pain “out of proportion to the minor
nature of the wound.” The husband in a
failing marriage fastens with disgust on the
lipstick on his wife’s teeth; a son feels
betrayed when he discovers two cham-
pagne glasses beside his divorced mother’s
bed; three children who recently lost their
mother cringe when a barmaid in a local
pub calls their widowed father by his first
name. In one of the more disturbing sto-
ries, a bottle of Johnson’s Baby Oil as-
sumes monumental significance in a crum-
bling love affair. The oil is both the agent
of pleasure during many afternoons of sen-
sual delight and the agent of destruction as
a suspicious lover comes to regard each
disappearing drop of oil as further evi-
dence of his partner’s infidelity.
It is a tribute to Drewe that through all
the suffering, his stories and his characters
never become maudlin. In the final conver-
sation of his collection, a woman tries to
reassure David Lang that he has not over-
reacted to the pain of the stingray. “They’re
actually very poisonous,” she says gener-
ously. “People are thought to have died.”
“Let’s keep it a stingray,” he says, mean-
ing: “Let’s not make it worse than it is.”
Even life’s roughest waves, Drewe seems to
be saying, can be conquered by the agile
bodysurfer.

The Original.
Rado. A name that means far more
than a product, a trademark or a com-
pany. For behind this name there lies a
philosophy which forms the basis for
the unique reputation enjoyed by Rado
throughout the industry and around
the world.
A true pioneering spirit and an unmis-
takable independence of expression
are the pillars upon which this philo-
sophy rests. The pioneering spirit
achieved world-wide recognition and
meaning with the invention of the
scratchproof watch. For the first time it
became possible to construct a watch
of both lasting beauty and permanent
value. The independence of expres-
sion is reflected in the unmistakable
Rado design; an unceasing intellectual
and spiritual dialogue with matter,
form and function.
Every Rado DiaStar has that extraordi-
nary quality. It is water-sealed with a
Swiss quartz movement that is state-
of-the-art. Its case-top - made out of
scratchproof hardmetal - is so incred-
ibly durable, its brilliant lustre will
remain unblemished forever. And its
sapphire crystal is so hard, only a dia-
mond can possibly mar its mirror-like
surface. This is why every Rado
DiaStar remains to be a precious
piece of jewelry - today, tomorrow and
always.
Rado. Inimitable and constantly setting
new standards in watchmaking excel-
lence.

Modem Watchdogs for Home Security
Not long ago, most home security
systems consisted of no more than a
burglar alarm that shrieked if someone
tried to break into a house. No longer.
Today’s sophisticated devices are not
only intended to ward off burglars, but
also to detect fires and floods, monitor
power failures and measure changes in
the temperature. Moreover, these new
security systems make use of modern
telecommunications technology to alert
someone outside the home not only that
a problem exists, but what it is.
The Guardian, made in Dallas, Texas,
by TeleSecurity Inc., monitors various
parts of the house with sensor modules
that communicate with a control unit by
radio wave, eliminating the need for ex-
tensive wiring. To detect intruders, the
Guardian uses both motion and body-
heat sensors to reduce the often high rate of false alarms with
some systems. Once activated, the Guardian waits 10 seconds
to be disarmed before setting off a loud siren and flashing light.
The system then automatically dials a 24-hour dispatch center
in Dallas, where a computer can notify local authorities of the
problem. Smoke sensors operate similarly. A carry-along mod-
ule is also available to allow someone who is injured, or can’t
get to the telephone, to activate the alarm. The basic system
costs about $ 1,000, plus a $ 10-to-$ 15 monthly fee for the tie-in
to the dispatch center.
Anova Electronics of San Mateo, Calif., manufactures a
similar modular radio-wave system that calls the prepro-
grammed numbers of friends or relatives instead of contacting a
central dispatch center. The machine can call different people
Guardian: More than a burglar alarm
to report various emergencies and tell
them in a recorded message what the
problem is. If they are not at their phone
to receive the call, the system is unable to
redial later or call another number, but
will set off an audible alarm. Like most
security systems, Anova’s Master Sys-
tem has a component to turn lights on
and off during the evening to make it
appear as if someone is home. The three
basic components to the Anova system
cost about $9OO.
The Sensaphone, unlike the Guhrdian
and Anova systems, hooks up to existing
telephones and is connected by wires to
sensor modules in the house. When the
device detects a problem, such as a flood,
it announces what it is by referring to a
voice-synthesis vocabulary of 165 words.
If the machine is not disarmed within 25
seconds, it will begin calling preprogrammed telephone num-
bers. In the event of a power failure, the system waits five
minutes before calling. When someone answers, the system will
tell him what phone number it is calling from and what the
problem is. It will then switch to a microphone so that the
person on the phone can hear what is going on in the house. If
the Sensaphone completes none of its maximum of four calls, it
will wait 10 minutes and try again, continuing the process until
it gets through or is shut off. The system also allows homeown-
ers to call their own phone number when they are away and hear
a status report that gives the time, temperature and whether
any alerts have been triggered. The basic Sensaphone system,
which is made by Gulf & Western, sells for about $250.
WILLIAM BURGER with CYNTHIA CATTERSON
More Than Meets the Eye
No two eyes are exactly alike. Based on
that fact, EyeDentify, Inc., is moving
into the increasingly lucrative field of
office security. The Oregon-based com-
pany has developed a way to allow people
to enter restricted areas —or prevent
them from doing so —by analyzing the
distinctive pattern of their eyes in the
same way as police analyze fingerprints.
The EyeDentification System 7.5 can
store between 20 and 1,200 retinal im-
ages. People seeking to enter a room or
building are first “enrolled” in the sys-
tem by looking into the binocular-shaped
“eye camera,” which takes a picture of
one or both retinas. That image is con-
verted into a mathematical representa-
tion and stored in the system’s memory.
To gain entry, a person who has been
enrolled simply looks into the eye cam-
era, focuses on a central point and presses
a button to start the retinal scan. The
EyeDentification system: Unique patterns
scan is taken with an ultralow-intensity
infrared beam, which the company says
is harmless. That image is then compared
with the “eye signature” on file in the
system’s memory. It takes only 1.5 sec-
onds to search the file and grant access if
the images match. Users may also be
given a personal identification number to
reduce the chance of misidentification.
Company officials estimate the prob-
ability of error at less than one in a
million using the retinal scan alone. Eye-
Dentify executives also say that the sta-
bility of the retina makes their system
more accurate than those that use finger-
prints, which can be damaged temporar-
ily by cuts and bruises, thereby increas-
ing the chance of error. The company
plans to begin marketing the system this
autumn. Each terminal costs about
$lO,OOO. For an additional $B5O, its en-
rollment capacity can be expanded to the
maximum 1,200.

As a forum, club
is debatable
ANDREW Peacock’s staff be-
gan an immediate study of
tapes of the Reagan-Mondale
television exchanges in the
United States as soon as
Prime Minister Bob Hawke
agreed to a national campaign
debate.
They do not much like the
idea of the National Press
Club as a forum. All party
leaders are to speak at the
club during the last week of
the campaign, in accordance
with a long tradition, and they
think a discussion there would
lack drama.
The format for the Reagan-
Mondale debate had Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan and
challenger Walter Mondale
standing at separate rostrums
with moderator Barbara Wal-
ters, the TV news anchor, and
a panel of three journalists in
attendance.
Each journalist was al-
lowed a question to the Presi-
dent, plus a follow-up ques-
tion. Then there was another
question and follow-up ques-
tion to Mondale on the same
issue, with Reagan and
Mondale each having one
minute to rebut his opponent.
So it went for 90 minutes,
with separate debates on dom-
estic and foreign affairs.
There were to have been
four journalists, drawn from a
list of 100 by mutual agree-
ment, but they could only
reach agreement on three.

The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, October 16
Politicians sitting pretty
THE LID on a secret that
politicians have kept for years
is about to be lifted in Vic-
toria. The Parliamentary
Superannuation Scheme,
having been designed for poli-
ticians by politicians, gives
generous retirement benefits.
But the cost to the public of
that generosity has been hid-
den from the public eye.
The Economic and Budget
Review Committee of the
Victorian parliament is about
to reveal all. A report by the
committee is to be tabled in
state parliament next week
and will show the cost of poli-
ticians’ superannuation is
equal to 113 percent of politi-
cians’ salaries.
By way of comparison, the
cost of generous private sector
schemes is around 10 percent
of salaries.
Exposure of the cost of
parliamentary pensions is one
thing; action on the report is
another. Self-interest is as
strong in politicians as in any-
one else in the community
and no fancy price is being
offered against the report re-
maining in a pigeonhole.

Behind-the-scenes story of a man who broke them
ONE OF Australia’s most
skilled and maligned journal-
ists died of a heart attack last
week in New York. Bruce
Rothwell, originally of Mel-
bourne, later of the London
Daily Mail, the Sunday Aus-
tralian and The Australian,
was editorial page director of
Rupert Murdoch’s New York
Post.
Rothwell was in charge of
The Australian during the
1975 Kerr crisis and many
journalists and others blamed
him for at least contributing
substantially to the fall of
prime minister Gough
Whitlam, if not causing it.
The accusation probably
flatters Rothwell, though he
was quite fond of the hand he
played to the extent of
having published a small
edition of The Australian’s
editorials, many of which he
penned.
The Bulletin's London rep-
resentative Bob Darroch, who
worked as The Australian’s
London reporter in 1975, tells
of an odd coincidence involv-
ing the Rothwells. Bruce’s
wife Anna had heard on the
radio that an anonymous Aus-
tralian had completed an
unfinished book named
Sanditon by Jane Austen.
Rothwell thought it sound-
ed like a good story and
told Darroch to trace the
authoress.
Although rebuffed by the
publishers, Darroch insisted
on leaving his name and ex-
plained the Australian con-
nection.
A few days later, he got a
call from a lady named Marie
Dobbs who invited him to her
home in Detroit in the United
States. There, she told
Darroch her story.
She had joined the old
Sydney Daily Telegraph soon
after the start of World War
11. She went to London and
wangled a job on the Daily
Express. When she heard that
a planeload of journalists was
going to Greece, she talked
herself into a seat.
She teamed up in Athens
with two male colleagues, one
of whom was also an Austra-
lian and of whom Dobbs be-
came rather fond. But then he
went off to Jerusalem to cover
the crisis there while she went
back to London where she got
a job as a typist.
She met and married an
English diplomat and, out of
boredom, resumed her literary
career. She wrote romantic
novels (hence the invitation to
complete Sanditori).
It was a nice little story
but, at the time, it had a
punchline Darroch could not
put in. For, as Marie ex-
plained, the name of that Aus-
tralian she had met and fallen
a little in love with was Bruce
Rothwell. That was the reason
she had agreed to see
Darroch. Could he send her
regards to Rothwell?
Rothwell and Dobbs met
again a few years later in New
York. Rothwell told of how he
had gone to Palestine and
been on hand to cover the
bombing of the King David
Hotel the report which got
him a job on the Daily Mail
and launched his executive
career, which made him the
Mail's number two before he
joined News Ltd.

BACKGAMMON
by Micbael Lloyd
THE Crawford Rule states that in
a tournament, when one player
gets within one point of the match,
the doubling cube may not be
used in the next game only. It is a
very good rule yet can change
completely the tactics to be
adopted. Consider the illustration:
White, in a tournament match to
11 points, leads 10-8. The Craw-
ford Rule is in force. White rolls a
4-2. What is the play?
Beginners might see merit in
making the 3 point (W 7 to W 3 and
W 5 to W 3) but there is none. The 3
point is useless at this stage but,
more importantly, it puts the
builders on W 7 and W 5 effectively
“out of play” and, if ever there
were a time when White needed
attackers, this is it!
The more seasoned player
might bring a man from the mid-
point (812 to W 7). This, too, is a
“nothing” move probably made
in accordance with the spurious
reasoning of trying to “save the
gammon.” To make it, virtually
surrenders the game to Black (or
relies on hopes that Black will roll
nothing higher than a 4 and there-
fore remain locked in White’s
home board). The correct move is
to hit on W 4 and send a man to
Wll, as shown by the arrows.
The clue to the correct move
lies in the score. At 10-8, it matters
little whether White loses a single
game or a gammon. If White loses
one point, Black will automatical-
ly double at 10-9 down; if White
were gammoned now, the score
would be 10-10. The next game is
the final one, whatever the case.
To make an apparently daring
play which will not alter the state
of the match if it backfires does
not take courage. Making the in-
dicated play gives White the best
possible chance of winning the
game.

Opening lead eight of
hearts.
THERE ARE plays a declarer
must resist despite their magnetic
attraction. Here is a case where it
would be easy to go wrong.
South was in six hearts and
West led a trump. Declarer drew
three rounds of trumps, East dis-
carding a low spade, and then
cashed the A-K of diamonds,
learning that East had started with
four to the jack.
South continued with a dia-
mond to the queen and ruffed the
fourth round of diamonds, thus
establishing dummy’s 10 as a trick.
Declarer now had to decide
whether to take a spade or a club
finesse, but in the actual case it did
not matter which one he chose be-
cause he would go down one
either way.
South should not have gotten
himself into this pickle. He could
have assured the slam earlier by
adopting a slightly different meth-
od of play.
After he had cashed three
rounds of trumps and the A-K of
diamonds and learned of the 4-1
diamond division, South should
have played a diamond to the
queen and another diamond back.
But instead of ruffing the fourth
round of diamonds as he did,
South should have discarded a
spade or a club.
East would have found himself
on lead with the jack of diamonds
and no place to go. He would have
been compelled to return a spade
or a club into one of dummy’s A-
Qs, and this in turn would have
handed declarer the slam.
It may run against the grain for
declarer to lose a trick he can eas-
ily win, but it surely must be right
in the present case to concede a
diamond trick to East in exchange
for a 100 percent certainty of
making the slam.
