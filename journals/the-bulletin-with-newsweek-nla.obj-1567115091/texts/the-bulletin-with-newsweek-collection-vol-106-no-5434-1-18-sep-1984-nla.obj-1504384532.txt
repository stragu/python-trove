THE SPORT OF TMNKMG
At BMW we have a definite
attitude to motor racing. We would
rather return from the track with an
innovation than with a trophy.
For to us, every race is an
opportunity to test a theory or improve
a component.
Every car we build for the track
is an experiment in automotive
technology.
And every lesson we learn on the
track we apply directly to our
production cars.
We believe it is this philosophy
that distinguishes a car that carries the
BMW symbol from all others.
For while others regard factors
such as peak performance and
superlative manoeuvrability as
desirable, to us they are absolutely
compulsory.

But perhaps even more impor-
tant than our commitment to research
and technological innovation is our
intrinsic certainty that without
individual brilliance and disciplined
creativity, cars such as the 318 i, the
323 i, 520 i, 528 i, and the 735 i would
never have seen the light ot day.
Let alone produce the sheer
pleasure experienced by those who
drive them.
These demands on the creative
capacities of our designers are the
most important reasons for our
involvement in motor sport.
When we are asked what we
think about sport we reply:
Thinking is our sport.

For a long time a lot of people thought that the
only thing Australia had plenty of, was nothing.
Mainly because they didn’t know where to look.
The truth is, when you get to know your way
around, you soon find that there are many different
precious resources, just waiting.
But to get to them, you have to call on a few

BP Australia is continuing to invest in
this country’s potential, and its future.

The Quiet Achiever.


THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
John Stone’s convictions
One might feel that the oft quoted and
(almost) cliche lines of the bard
Shakespeare concerning over-reaction
may well apply to our “leading” Labor
pollies and union officials and John
Stone’s delivery (a yorker) at the
Edward Shann Memorial Lecture. To
question his loyalty to the government is
tantamount to an implied censorship on
integrity. And that is surely outside the
ALP censorship plank their platform
on censorship seems to have shrunk re-
cently; so let’s call it a plank.
Right or wrong, the man has made a
statement with the courage of his con-
victions, in an open place and for those
who will to chide or cheer him.
Are they suggesting that a person in
such an elevated position (ret) who en-
counters, within his beliefs, a soreness
in our governmental loins should re-
main mute?
If that soreness is not relieved, will
not the referred pain to the people be
even greater? And is not loyalty to the
country greater than loyalty to a politi-
cal party?
Perhaps, if the pollies consider that
there is no case to answer, then THEY
should remain mute.

Call to stop the rot
I take no pleasure in the fact that my
pessimistic view of the future, based on
our past and present stupidity, is now
supported by the public utterances of
Mr John Stone, the retiring Secretary of
the Treasury, when he delivered the
Edward Shann Memorial Lecture.
Rather than a gloating “I told you
so,” I would urge all Australians con-
cerned by our headlong rush to corpor-
ate fascism and a one-party Socialist
State to wake up and act now to reverse
the rot.
The directors and managers of big
corporations, snowed (if you’ll pardon
the pun) at Hawke’s economic summit
of 1983, remained silent when the Arbi-
tration Commission confiscated the
financial reserves and their share-
holders’ funds to impose a retrospective
burden of debt and labelled that uncon-
scionable action “just and fair redun-
dancy provisions.” They remain equally
mute as the architects of industrial and
economic chaos, the AMFSU leader-
ship, now put forward their plan for
economic recovery.
The unholy trinity of big govern-
ment, big unions and a blithely stupid
Arbitration and Conciliation Commis-
sion has visited a plague upon our land.
It is, in the eyes of many media chief-
tains, a heinous sin of heresy to question
the Hawke-inspired myth of consensus,
reconciliation and the “accord”: How-
ever, the inescapable truth is that the
legislative processes such as public-
funded political propaganda, electoral
manipulation and now blatant electoral
bribery which the Treasurer calls a re-
sponsible and an economic stimulatory
budget, are part of a well-conceived
plan to deliver Australians into the
“Not the examination results! The pregnancy-test results.”

Broadbeach Waters Qld
Not before time
Surely the words of Treasury chief John
Stone should have been uttered long be-
fore this.
He is saying what most of us knew to
be true: business is being drowned in a
sea of red tape, kids are not being em-
ployed because of union strangleholds
on industry and penalty rates.
We will be overrun by the ASEAN
countries and business will no longer
belong to the entrepreneur unless we
heed his warning. As a shadow one-off
reply to the budget, I think the speech
imperative reading for all Australians.

Question of loyalty
Federal Treasurer Mr Keating, when
speaking on the ABC program AM
(Tuesday, August 28), expressed dis-
pleasure with the outgoing Treasury
Secretary, Mr John Stone.
He stated that Mr Stone, by speaking
“Give me a fag, any day!”
out as he did in Perth, did not demon-
strate the loyalty he should have shown
toward Mr Hawke and Mr Keating.
The Hawke Government’s actions of
accelerating the growth in the public
debt, of intervening in free markets and
wage fixation, surely are of sufficient
moment to warrant a strong expression
of concern particularly from one so
eminent.
Mr Keating claims that Mr Stone’s
comments are a “poor reward” for the
government’s loyalty to him.
To the contrary, Mr Stone’s loyalty
to the nation to the Australian people
transcends any so-called loyalty due
to our politicians.

I can imagine a percentage of idle
layabouts being in the number of New
Zealanders who stay in Australia. Un-
fortunately, they spoil the reputation of
the majority.
It’s the old story: “when the cat’s
away, the mice will play.” It’s probably
the first time these young people have
been away from parental control and
they make the most of it.
But in the same breath I would like
to remind Mr Gillies that some of the
young Australians we get over in NZ
don’t always behave like saints, either. I
remember a group of rowdy roos whose
behaviour constantly upset the sober
drinking habits of some of us kultured
Kiwis at my local pub back home.
I have pleasant memories of my
working holiday in Sydney and my Aus-
tralian friends there, especially at the
Eastern Suburbs Rugby Club.
By the way, when are you Aussies
going to produce a decent rugby side
and keep the beerstains off the Ameri-
ca’s Cup? I can understand the tear-
stains after the race but we want it nice
and clean when we take it away in ’B7.

No rift-Perkins
The article by Fia Cumming (B, Sep-
tember 11) calls for some comment
from me as head of the Department of
Aboriginal Affairs.
Your correspondent seems to have
discovered a “serious rift” between the
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and this
department. In truth, no such rift exists.
The minister and the department have a
close, proper and harmonious working
relationship directed to advancing the
interests and expressing the legitimate
concerns of Aboriginal people.
Ms Cumming makes much of two re-
lated matters. The first is the develop-
ment of the government’s policy on Ab-
original land rights and the second is
the way in which we have sought to
build up a public awareness program to
give the community a better under-
standing of the important issues which
arise in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.
On coming to office, the main prin-
ciples the government wished to devel-
op in relation to land rights were quite
clearly set out. These assumed the form

Great expectations.
Anticipation is a high point of any
culinary experience, but to satisfy even
modest expectations can require a
relatively high order of cuisine.
At Hilton, the subjects of prepara-
tion, presentation, taste and texture
are a matter of some ceremony, for
their role is not merely to satisfy but to .
elevate the expectations of even the
most enlightened epicurean.
From the garnish on a humble
hamburger to the consistency of a
souffle or the delicate balance of a
sauce, we strive for perfection. And
although our standards may seem
obsessive, with a name like Hilton we
should not only be equal to great
expectations, but ready to surpass
them.
In our grand dining rooms, bust-
ling coffee shops or ever-ready room
service, there is only one standard-

thing more than first class.

of five principles as set out below:
■ Aboriginal land to be held under
inalienable freehold title.
■ Adequate legal protection of Abor-
iginal sites.
■ Aboriginal control in relation to
mining of Aboriginal land.
■ Access to mining royalty equiva-
lents.
■ Compensation for lost land to be
negotiated.
The minister and the department
have always recognised these principles
as goals to be pursued. We have recog-
nised that each principle requires care-
ful thought and discussion among all in-
terested parties to work out, in a spirit
of reasonable discussion, just how they
should be given legislative expression.
The minister decided that it was ap-
propriate for Aboriginal people to be
consulted first about what they saw as
desirable in these respects and there
have been consultations over the last
several months. There was always an in-
tention and there remains the inten-
tion that, once Aboriginal aspirations
have been more clearly formulated in
this complex area, these would be open
to discussion with all elements in the
community who saw themselves as
having an interest in the matter.
Your correspondent correctly notes
that there have been delays within the
Aboriginal community in reaching
“ It’s our latest strategy -Jehovah’s wittnessagrams.”
settled views on this matter. The minis-
ter and the department have been con-
tent for the timetable originally
proposed to be rescheduled as a result. I
find it hard to understand that the de-
lays ought to be the subject of criticism
as your correspondent implies.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister
and the minister particularly have made
it clear to mining and rural groups that
there will be the fullest possible consul-
tation with them at an appropriate time.
Many formal and informal discussions
have already been held; more are to be
organised. The minister has made it
plain, for instance, that private land will
not be open for claim under any legisla-
tion eventually brought down.

It’s precisely because of the exposure
of the community to misinformation
much of it malicious which has
prompted the department and the min-
ister to give consideration over the last
year to what we have come to call the
“public awareness program.” The min-
ister wants and the department entire-
ly agrees to make sure that the Austra-
lian community is kept informed fairly
and impartially of the issues in Aborigi-
nal affairs and gets the opportunity to
see and hear first hand from Aboriginal
people themselves what their hopes and
aspirations are.
Naturally, there are a number of
ways in which those general objectives
can be achieved. Naturally, too, there
has been discussion and advice to and
fro between the minister and the depart-
ment on this sensitive question.
As you note, the vehemence and
virulence of some of the attacks has
come as something of a surprise and the
minister and the department have seen
it as their duty to look for useful and
cost effective ways of countering the
more extreme and unfounded claims
being made.
One way to do this is quite simply to
keep putting the facts before the public
when misinformation is peddled. The
minister has suggested, and the depart-
ment has never disagreed, that factual
errors noted in local media can be
answered by officers of the department
on the spot. It is nothing new. No one
has refused to undertake this duty.
The portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs
has never been easy and great sensitivity
is needed in its administration. Not in-
frequently, Aboriginal people may dis-
agree quite sharply on issues and on the
ways their objectives may be achieved.
It is the task of the minister and the de-
partment to try to understand what may
be behind these differences, at the same
time pursuing established policy. Abor-
iginal disagreements are not always
criticisms of the minister. They were
there before he took office and will be
with us for a long time yet.
It will be apparent from what I have
said that your correspondent has been
badly misled by access to incomplete in-
formation held on our files. But clearly,
she has displayed a poor understanding
of the real situation. There is no “rift”
between the minister and the depart-
ment. We look forward to a continued
productive association with him.

Wine tax pledge
Mr R. J. L. Hawke, in delivering the
Labor Party’s rural policy speech at
Griffith NSW on 20/2/83, stated:
“Labor is pledged not to impose a sales
tax or an excise tax on wine.”
The Hawke Government’s budget of
21/8/84 imposed a sales tax of 10 per-
cent on wine.
Disastrous as such a tax will be to
small grapegrowers and despicable as it
is to have a prime minister who was un-
truthful, surely the real tragedy in this
act of dishonesty is that there has been
hardly any public outcry or media reac-
tion.

Dr Havryliv (B, August 21) draws atten-
tion to Soviet Russia’s regular castiga-
tion of western, particularly US, “im-
perialism.”
However much the inhabitants of
“bourgeois democracies” agree with the
definition of imperialism as total or
near-total political domination of one
nation by another, this is NOT the
Marxist-Leninist definition of imperial-
ism. By Marxist-Leninist definition, im-
perialism is domination only by capital-
ist countries. Comparable action by the
Soviet Union or its allies is “liberation,”
“assisting the class struggle,” “liberating
the proletariat” or “advancing the cause
of socialism.”
Similarly with the word “Peace.” By

Distinctive and
Rewarding
Having achieved a rare level of
success, its only fitting to consider the
rich rewards of the Ford LTD.
As you may expect in a motor
vehicle of such luxury, creature
comforts abound. The sumptuous
front seats have a range of power and
manual adjustments to provide superb
comfort. The LTDs moon roof has a
power operated tinted glass panel, and
a manually operated inbuilt sunshade.
Electronic controls operate the power
windows, central doordocking system,
exterior rear-view mirrors and bootdid
release - all from the comfort of the
drivers seat.
LTDs designers have specified the
refined power of the Ford electronic
fueLinjected EH 4.1 litre engine as
standard equipment. This engine,
together with the advantages of the
Watts link rear suspension system and
power steering, provide a feeling of
quiet confidence.
Your success may be reflected in
many ways. But few are as rewarding
or as satisfying as the Ford LTD. Have
your Ford dealer arrange a test drive

Consequently, the “Peace” the

Passport investigation
In his letter (B, August 28) titled “Pass-
port Problems,” Mr Tony Baer, of
Manly, NSW, stated that he had picked,
up a “registered parcel” (actually a Cer-
tified Mail packet) from his local post
office, containing his passport, without
having to sign for it.
Australia Post’s investigation of Mr
Baer’s allegation shows that his recol-
lection of the incident is incorrect.
Mr Baer did sign for his Certified
packet.
In accordance with Australia Post
practice, he signed the Certified Mail
Delivery Journal held by the post office
concerned before being handed his Cer-
tified packet on August 1, 1984.
When contacted by an Australia Post
officer, on August 22, 1984, Mr Baer
agreed during their discussions that he
had, in fact, signed for the article at the
time he collected it.

Rousing entertainment
Brian Hoad’s severe criticism (B, Sep-
tember 4) of the previous production of
Aida at the Sydney Opera House be-
trays his own elitist proclivities, much
the same ones he so praises Verdi for
condemning.
By his own statistics, the 1975-77
production was a great success pri-
marily because it was rousing good en-
tertainment; Verdi’s principal aim, I’m
sure.
We plebeians loved it and if Mr
Hoad finds the subtler political and so-
ciological themes of the opera more
suited to his tastes, perhaps he should
just stay home and read the libretto.

Case for family taxation
It strikes me as very odd that in an elec-
tion year neither the government, which
is so proud of its innovative approach,
nor the opposition which is desperately
in need of some sort of an economic
policy that can be hailed as an alterna-
tive has taken the opportunity to intro-
duce the idea of family taxation. In my
view, a system in which a worker’s in-
come could be averaged between
worker and spouse offers distinct ad-
vantages to several groups at very little
expense to the government.
Consider the case of the average
skilled tradesman with a wife and two
children. The tradesman earns about
$15,000 a year in my part of the world
and on that he pays $2726.25, leaving
him with an income of $12,273.75
scarcely enough to pay rent, let alone
buy your own home.
So his wife, usually unskilled, takes a
job and can expect to bring in about
$9OOO on which she pays $1174.54 as
well as costing him an extra $309 as a
result of losing the dependent spouse re-
bate. Total family income is now
$24,000 of which $4209.79 goes in tax,
leaving $19,790.21 for the family. For-
gotten in this example are the costs of
babysitting and the “kennel syndrome,”
so often recognised by doctors among
the children of working mums!
So dad elects to do a lot of overtime
and earn the $24,000 himself. (Actually,
with penalty rates, that entails a maxi-
mum of another 16 hours a week.) But
now his tax bill is $6278.26, leaving a
family income of $17,271.74. Now, if
the government allowed the averaging
of income between spouses, the tax
would be $3949.02 and leave a family
net of $20,050.98. At the very worst, this
leaves the government $2329.24 and
more likely $260.77 worse off.
Now, the unemployment benefit for
young people is around $4OOO a year
and the young person taking our
spouse’s job would pay $1174.54 tax so
the government would gain at least
$2,845.30 from the exercise!
I wonder why this obvious system
has not been introduced. Certainly it
benefits the worker and the unemployed
and it removes the right to enter that
most exalted and demanding of pro-
fessions, MOTHERHOOD, from the
privileges of the well-to-do without
compelling anyone to accept it.

Tobacco on the defence
The letter in your columns from Mr
A. A. Wood, representing Rothmans of
Pall Mall (September 4), attacking Earle
Hackett’s article, “Lady Bones,” is a
blatant example of the tobacco industry
defending its image and its dollars.
All your words, Mr Wood, do not
alter the fact that tobacco company ad-
vertising is designed to sell cigarettes

first in home lending.
In its last financial year, ended
May 31,1984, St. George lent a record
amount of $506 million to home buyers.
Around twice as much as the next
largest building society.
In fact, no other financial institution
- including any bank - claims to have
provided more home loan hinds in New
South Wales during that time.
That’s a good indication of the
St. George dedication to adhere to its
original objective.
St. George pioneering
home loan ideas.
St. George has always recognised
that helping average Australians to buy
their own homes is its reason for
existence.
H 6 75 Left
New home lending schemes to
help first home buyers who could not
otherwise obtain a home loan have been
of paramount importance to St. George.
St. George has pioneered a number
of great lending ideas including, only
recently, an innovative No Deposit Loan
initially in conjunction with a leading
home builder as a forerunner to a much
wider offer.
St. George part of
a worldwide growth trend
Building societies emerged in
England at the time of the Industrial
Revolution when groups of workers
needed to find a means of funding
additional housing.
Since those austere beginnings,
building societies have developed into
the major financial institutions in many
developed countries.
St. George is growing, too.
Currently, St. George assets exceed
$2.2 billion, making St. George the largest
building society in Australia.
And St. George is continually moving
into adjacent financial areas in order to
further help its customers.


StGeorge
Australia Wide Service.
St. George is now linked with other
major building societies in all States of
Australia j a carefully matched group of
seven societies all sharing the same ideals.
This link is called the
Australian Societies Group.
Already this link is
providing tangible benefits to customers
... such as home loan assistance for
customers who relocate interstate.
Now with their Freedom Cashcard,
StGeorge customers have access to
the largest network of Automatic Teller
Machines in Australia.
And there are more good things to
come, such as new customer loans for
any purpose, and the ability to make
purchases in retail stores by using the

It may be a little surprising to some

country’s largest Cash Management Trust.
StGeorge always in
sight of the objective.
St. George is continually moving
forward to offer better and better service
as customers’ expectations develop.
But St. George also makes the firm
promise that it will never forget its basic
objective to improve the living standards
of Australians by providing finance for
homes.
To do this, StGeorge recognises that
it must continually offer the very best
reasons to invest, otherwise there will be
no money to lend.
Consider St. George.
If you are looking for the best
investments, consider this:
St. George is not a conventional
financial institution.
The St. George “shareholders” are its
customers, not a select group of people
wanting to pocket the profits.
So St. George customers benefit.
Better investment products and
more opportunities to provide
home loans.
Now that’s got to be a
great idea, St. George.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Murphy inquiries
FOLLOWING a compromise
between the government and
the opposition in the Senate,
two inquiries will be held into
allegations against Justice
Lionel Murphy of the High
Court. The government will
ask the Director of Public
Prosecutions, lan Temby, QC,
whether a charge should be
laid against Murphy. A Sen-
ate committee inquiry will
consider the wider question of
impropriety or misbehaviour.
The two investigations will be
simultaneous.

UNEMPLOYMENT rose by
5800 to 8.9 percent, a 0.1 per-
cent increase over July’s rate
of 8.8 percent. The Bureau of
Statistics showed that Tas-
mania was hardest hit with
11.2 percent unemployed, fol-
lowed by Queensland (9.7),

NSW Premier Neville Wran
said the state government
would open a major assault
on violent and anti-social be-
haviour by minority groups.
The new measures would in-
clude stricter gun laws and
wider police powers against
consorting. All gun users
would be licensed and serious
breaches of firearm legislation
would be punishable by up to
seven years in jail.

COVER STORY/AUSTRALIA
The trials of
Justice Lionel Murphy
Once more the business of the national government has turned into a pre-
occupation with the whiff of scandal in high places. This week no less than two
federal inquiries are underway into allegations concerning High Court judge Lionel
Murphy. In the following articles Bulletin journalists profile the three central
characters in this current drama. RICHARD FARMER, a longtime close observer
of the scene and our chief Canberra correspondent, looks at the accident-prone,
enigmatic man who could well have given his name to Murphy’s law. DEBORAH
HOPE tells of the man who has alleged that he believes Murphy tried to wrongly
influence the course ofjustice, NSW Chief Magistrate Clarrie Briese, and
ANTHONY HILL looks at a little-known West Australian who has been rapidly
projected into one of the country’s hottest seats, lan Temby, recently appointed to a
new federal position, Director of Public Prosecutions.
LIONEL MURPHY was
playing father last week
while federal parliament
was dominated by political
activity about accusations
that he had sought to inter-
fere in a court case involv-
ing Sydney solicitor
Morgan Ryan. The two
sons of the High Court
judge were on holiday
from the Forrest Primary
School in Canberra and
dad had promised to take
them to Sydney. Senate in-
quiry or no, that promise
was going to be kept. So
while the politicians debated the mean-
ing of Section 72 of the constitution,
Murphy went shopping with Cameron
and Blake. That experience, Murphy
quipped when he returned to his office
at the court, gave him more trouble than
any group of senators.
The Murphy sense of humor has cer-
tainly not deserted him in the months
since he became, not for the first time, a
figure of public controversy with the
publication of transcripts of telephone
conversations purportedly featuring
him. On the wall behind his desk there
still hangs a picture of the Murphy
Nebulae, a part of the galaxy captured
by telescope that has an amazing simi-
larity to the Murphy nose. But it is a
sign of the times that the desk itself is
covered with press clippings that deal
with those transcripts and their political
consequences.
Even the joke about senators has a
slightly hollow ring to it. Murphy knows

how dangerous politicians become with
the scent of blood in their nostrils. He
knows that truth, accuracy and fair play
are the first casualties in an election
campaign. He knows the arrogance that
the Senate has about its powers. Lionel
Murphy has been there and done that
himself.
It is one of the ironies of his present
predicament that he, more than any
other person, created the activist Senate
that is now investigating whether he
should remain as a High Court judge.
Murphy entered the Senate in 1962
when it was a rather sleepy chamber.
For his own Labor Party it was often a
retirement home for faithful retainers
a place to send officials when you could
not afford to pay them a pension. De-
bate was languid and the role well and
truly secondary.
Lionel Murphy did not fancy
playing second to anyone. He brought a
brash confidence into the house of re-
view. He brought a sche-
ming cleverness into the
Labor caucus. By 1967
Murphy was bored with
being a backbencher; he
wanted to play in the big
league and flirted with
transferring to the House
of Representatives. The
right wing controllers of
the New South Wales
branch thought otherwise.
In those days, as now, the
machine didn’t make safe
seats easy for left wingers.
Murphy turned his frus-
trations into actions. In
February 1967 the caucus met to elect a
successor to Arthur Calwell. Gough
Whitlam won comfortably and the
centre and the right of the party were
delighted when Lance Barnard became
the deputy. But these ballots were of
minor interest to Murphy. He con-
centrated the left’s energies on the race
for Senate leadership. With some su-
perb organising in the face of a compla-
cent opposition he won the job.
Now armed with a title of opposition
leader in the Senate, Murphy turned to
giving it substance. He did so by devel-
oping a network of active committees.
Graham Freudenberg in his book A
Certain Grandeur tells of the Senate be-
ing lifted from “the torpor of genera-
tions.”
Freudenberg, an observer of the
period as press secretary to Whitlam,
said: “It may have been laudable to try
to raise the prestige of the Senate; its
real result was to raise its pretensions.”


Justice Lionel Murphy: unashamed reformist
Never have those pretensions been
more evident than in the Senate’s ac-
tions this year. The publication by The
Age of transcripts of supposed conver-
sations involving Morgan Ryan and
Murphy was seized on by the Liberal,
National and Democrat parties that had
spent 12 months as an opposition with
very little to oppose.
With a stated concern about the pro-
priety of Murphy remaining a High
Court judge, the three parties combined
to set up a Senate committee to inquire
into the tapes. The purpose was to deter-
mine if the conversations showed be-
haviour that could be construed as
“proved misbehaviour” on Murphy’s
part in the terms of Section 72 (ii) of the
Constitution.
The committee met for some five
months and unanimously decided at the
end of it that it was unable to conclude
that any or all of the tape recordings
and transcripts were authentic. It fur-
ther reported that even if they were
authentic, they revealed no misbeha-
viour by Murphy.
That would have been the end of the
matter but for late evidence given to the
committee by the Chief Stipendiary
Magistrate of NSW, Clarrie Briese. Al-
legations made by Briese about conver-
sations he had with Murphy were not
the subject of the unanimous report
from the committee. The Liberal and
Democrat senators believed that further
investigation of those conversations was
justified.
Last week a compromise was
reached, whereby the suggestion that
Murphy had attempted to interfere with
the administration of justice was refer-
red to another Senate inquiry and to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, lan
Temby, QC. Within the Labor Party
caucus, there were some misgivings
about allowing government senators to
be associated with the further Senate in-
quiry.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke over-
came those doubts with the very prag-
matic approach that he did not want
any government of his to look as if it
were party to a cover-up. Hawke might
have some sympathy with the position
in which Murphy finds himself, but cer-
tainly does not want any of the mud
slung by the opposition to stick to him
or his government.
This is not an outcome Murphy
wanted. He has challenged Briese to lay
charges against him, believing that a
jury is the proper forum to decide alle-
gations of criminality. The investigation
by Temby could lead to that, but only if
he finds that a prima facie case exists.
On what has been published so far, in-
cluding an earlier report by Temby, this
must be considered doubtful. If Briese
laid charges they would be tested in
court without having to go through the


filter of the prosecutor first examining
the strength of the case.
Murphy’s counsel, including Sydney
barrister Tom Hughes, QC, who, like
Murphy, is a former attorney-general,
are now considering how they should
handle the Senate inquiry. There is a
natural suspicion of the motives of the
Liberals and the Democrats. Murphy
the politician made few friends within
the conservative side of politics and his
judgments since joining the High Court
have troubled the business establish-
ment as well. Murphy certainly believes
that he is but a pawn in the sordid side
of politics and that the attacks on him
are really designed to discredit all Labor
governments.
Because of that belief, Murphy is un-
enthusiastic about admitting that a Sen-
ate committee is a proper body to deter-
mine whether there has been “proved
misbehaviour.” He might yet argue that
parliament does not have the power to
even try to do so. Parliament’s role in
removing judges should, it is argued, be
confined to determining whether, after
misbehaviour has been proved in a
court, that misbehaviour is sufficiently
serious to justify removal. If this line is
taken, then a High Court challenge by
Murphy is likely.
Senators of all parties, as inheritors
of the increased role that Murphy pion-
eered, are adamant that they do have
the power to determine what proved
misbehaviour means.
The scene is thus set for what would
be a major test of the powers of parlia-
ment. And in political terms, the conse-
quences of taking the legal point to the
High Court would be damaging to the
government. It would look very much
as though Murphy was resisting to the
last the truth coming out.
It is a difficult judgment that Murphy
must make in the days before the Senate
committee begins its hearings. But he is
no stranger to making hard decisions
that involve him in controversy. As at-
torney-general he is perhaps best re-
membered for his morning raid on the
headquarters of the Australian Security
Intelligence Organisation in Mel-
bourne. That raid, justified by him on
the gound that there were doubts
whether ASIO was telling him every-
thing it knew about Croatian terrorist
organisations, quickly became a symbol
of what was wrong with the Whitlam
The kindly man at the epicentre of it all
IT WAS A WINDY day in August and
Clarrie Briese, chairman of the bench of
magistrates in NSW, was clearly ner-
vous. Nervous about his job, nervous
about Neville Wran and nervous about
journalists. The morning newspapers
had brought him the news that the NSW
Premier had failed to reaffirm his confi-
dence in his chief magistrate. Briese felt
defenceless. With Wran in a foul mood
over the magistrate’s allegations of cor-
ruption in high places, Briese
felt damned if he spoke out
and damned if he did not.
Sitting in his large, un-
adorned chambers at the un-
fashionable end of Castle-
reagh Street, his beagle eyes
sagging with worry, Briese
seemed again the timid
Lutheran boy from Temora,
in NSW’s Riverina, weighing
up his chances in life and not
liking the prospects. Now, a
month later, he is finding pub-
licity oppressive and has pol-
itely closed his door to report-
ers.
Briese’s journey from de-
pression-born child of Ger-
man immigrants to chief sti-
pendiary magistrate in NSW
in 1979 had taken 48 years.
Now 53, he joined the pub-
lic service in Forbes as a clerk
of petty sessions and began
the slow grind to the magis-
tracy. After five years of part-
time legal studies to complete
the barristers admission board
course, he was appointed to
the NSW magistrates bench in
1966. An Arts degree at Syd-
ney University and a
Churchill Fellowship to Cambridge to
study criminology paved his way to the
top job. His studies also cemented his
liberal ideas on justice, or the lack of it,
in the Australian legal scene.
On his apointment to the position of
chairman in May 1979, Briese declared
that courts alone could not be expected
to deal with a society characterised by a
rapidly rising crime rate and rapidly
changing outlook on questions such as
JOHN FAIRFAX
Clarrie Briese, SM: Church goer
drugs and alcohol. He said: “What hap-
pens in homes, in schools, in churches
and other social and learning agencies
has a great bearing on the values devel-
oped by the community. If there is a
serious breakdown and the accepted
values are no longer taught and
encouraged, then courts cannot correct
that situation through the use of in-
creased penalties ... At present there
are not enough alternatives ... magis-
trates need a greater range of
sentencing options.”
The irony of the Briese
controversy is that he is the
least likely protagonist. Mem-
bers of Sydney’s legal pro-
fession describe him as, “not a
great thinker,” “a nice, kind,
compassionate man,” who is
quietly spoken and humble on
social occasions and who has
a strong aversion to confront-
ing people or being nasty.
Clarrie Briese likes to be
liked. Some of his magistrates
feel he wants to be liked too
much and that this has pre-
vented him being tougher on
the “mad and bad” members
of the bench who, it is said,
prefer to spend spring after-
noons at the race course in-
stead of in a courtroom.
Briese does not have direct
powers to control his magis-
trates, but some suggest he
exerts less pressure on his
bench than did his predeces-
sor, Murray Farquhar, to
achieve adequate working
standards.
Briese’s home and social
life is quite separate in style


Government. It was impetuous at the
very least and the sight of an attorney-
general personally supervising the
searching of filing cabinets certainly
frightened the United States Govern-
ment.
But amateurish bungling was only
one side of Murphy, the minister. He
was an unashamed reformist and the
title of Humanist of the Year given to
him by the NSW Humanist Society in
1982 is now proudly dis-
played on the wall of his
chambers. That commemora-
tive plaque lists such things as
changing the divorce laws to
do away with the concept of
guilt, the appointment of mar-
riage celebrants and his con-
cern for international rela-
tions, social equity and peace. While
Humanists might not rate it worth a
mention, Murphy’s political legacy in-
eludes changes to the trade practices
law to abolish resale price maintenance.
That legislation certainly led to a great-
er competitiveness in Australian busi-
ness.
Murphy is also remembered as the
man who introduced Junie Morosi into
Canberra political society, and it is cer-
tainly true that as attorney-general and
later as a judge he had a wider and less
conventional circle of friends than most
politicians and High Court judges.
Morgan Ryan, the man whose phone
was illegally tapped by NSW police,
certainly fits into that category. And the
alleged transcripts of conversations be-
tween Murphy and Ryan display lan-
guage which most Australians would
believe judges should not use. They per-
haps become less sinister and
more understandable when it
is realised that some of the
people they talked about were
involved in the private pros-
ecution of Murphy and some
former ministerial colleagues
over the Khemlani loans
affair. □
from the rough and tumble of
the magistrates courts. He
lives with his wife and three
children in Cammeray and is
still a regular church goer,
who once considered be-
coming a Lutheran mission-
ary. In tune with his rather
low-key manner, he has a
small, but close circle of
friends.
For relaxation he likes to
read English novelists es-
pecially Jane Austen, play a
game of tennis (he’s a me-
diocre player), or listen to
classical music. Briese travels
to work by public transport
and prefers buying
sandwiches to indulging in
restaurant meals at lunch.
As a magistrate, Briese has a reputa-
tion for leniency. However, Roger West,
a solicitor with the Redfern Legal
Centre, has appeared before Briese on a
number of occasions. He disagrees
whith those who describe him as lenient,
preferring instead the adjectives “fair,”
“broadminded” and “deliberate.” Ac-
cording to West, Briese is polite to law-
yers and their clients and is sympathetic
to the circumstances leading to an
offence being committed.
Being mild-mannered has not di-
verted Briese from his almost single
handed campaign to establish the inde-
pendence of the magistrates bench. (In
NSW the magistracy is still part of the
public service). Convincing his magis-
trates to support him was no pushover.
“He was not exactly leading a band of
enthusiasts,” said one legal identity. The
magistrates feared loss of seniority, or,
worse, that they would lose their jobs
Morgan Ryan: part of Murphy’s wide circle of friends

once the lower court was opened up to
outsiders. Ensuring that these fears were
unnecessary, or that loss of jobs would
be compensated for, was the big factor
delaying the implementation of the Lo-
cal Courts Act, the legislation for inde-
pendence.
Once this task was fulfilled, Briese
had then to turn his attention to the one
of minimising opposition to the plan
from the clerks of petty sessions - those
public servants most likely to lose out in
the fight for positions on a new bench.
There have also been fears to contend
with inside the Attorney-General’s De-
partment over the potential petty tyran-
ny of a magistrates bench that is less
than wholly accountable to the public
service.
During this time Briese spoke to as-
sociates about the pressures on him as a
result of these tasks and the low morale
Seine- ''PMsed am* the
the delays in implementing
the new law. However, ac-
cording to one colleague, he
also spoke in vague terms
about another kind of press-
ure. Vagueness of speech, he
said, was a Briese trademark.
“You often left a conversation
with him feeling very con-
fused,” he said. On at least
one occasion Briese left his
colleague with the impression
that he was as jittery about his
position as were his junior
magistrates. The NSW cabinet
announced in December that
Briese would be reappointed
to the equivalent position
under The Local Courts Act.
Briese’s zeal in pursuing
the independence issue has at-
traded almost universal respect and ad-
miration from the legal world. One
senior NSW judge described him last
week as “a very honorable and respon-
sible man” with “a visionary commit-
ment to securing the independence of
the magistracy.” His previously divided
bench has now swung behind Briese in
the face of attacks on his integrity.
Since his 1977 sojourn to Cambridge,
Briese has been pushing the government
for a series of reforms aimed at
streamlining the presently clogged and
cumbersome court system. These in-
clude extended use of community ser-
vice orders in place of stiffer penalties
for minor offences, especially where
there is no victim; reducing the neces-
sity of court appearances by instituting
a system giving people the option of
automatic, on-the-spot fines for minor
offences where no challenge is in-
Ud f he introduction of “telephone


mentions” so that setting hearing dates
need not require a court appearance;
and introduction of “paper committals”
to avoid lengthy committal hearings
over less complex matters.
These reforms have generally been
supported in legal circles. Less wel-
come, however, is Briese’s push for the
summary right of appeal from the
magistrates courts to the District Court
to be abolished. At present proceedings
in the lower court carry an automatic
right to a new hearing.
Many lawyers regard this as a poten-
tially dangerous step, since it would re-
move the present check on “sausage ma-
chine law” at the overcrowded magis-
trates courts.
Just why Briese should have chosen
to raise his allegations years after the
alleged events occurred is a mystery to
many people who know him. According
to Bulletin sources, Briese has a naive
streak and is impressed by important
people. It is understood, however, that
Briese has been haunted by his attend-
ance at the now famous dinner at
Morgan Ryan’s home in 1979. It was
suggested to The Bulletin that Briese is
trying to make amends.
Briese himself has maintained that it
was only on reading the transcripts of
what is now known as The Age tapes
that he realised the importance of what
had occurred. But according to Briese,
he had mentioned his concern to people
unofficially in the 18 months previously.
One legal associate of Briese ex-
pressed surprise that Briese should have
been so concerned about the ap-
proaches he alleges occurred: “You
have to expect pressures to be exerted
when you’re in that kind of job, even if
it’s just lobbying. You just tell them to
get lost.” □
Unconventional prosecutor cool amid controversy
FOR A senior public official
caught in a political hot seat,
the Director of Public Pros-
ecutions, lan Temby, QC, is
showing a good deal of cool.
It is only seven months
since the 42-year-old Perth
lawyer was appointed the
Commonwealth’s first Direc-
tor of Public Prosecutions.
And he is well aware of the
potentially damaging effects
on his office, of the contro-
versy surrounding his report,
on the current allegations in-
volving High Court Judge,
Lionel Murphy.
Yet he shrugs off sugges-
tions that he is being used as a
dumping ground for problems
that ultimately have to be
solved by politicians them-
selves.
Temby says: “There are
other things I see as being of
far greater importance . . .
such as the prosecution of her-
oin importers or perpetrators
of fiscal frauds. The whole set-
ting up of the office of DPP is
a very large task.
“But if allegations of feder-
al criminality come in from
any quarter, we must assess
them. We do not go out look-
ing for work.”
His office, among the func-
tional, bureaucratic hives, is
only a short walk from Parliament
House. It is still in the process of being
refurbished, and the predominant color
scheme of blue and off-white reflects not
only Temby’s sense of “cool,” but a dis-
tinct air of modernity.
Which says something about the man
himself.
He is one of the generation of intelli-
gent, politically conscious and active
lawyers attracted to the Labor Party -
NEWS LIMITED
Ian Temby, QC: Robust independence
men who were in many ways unconven-
tional in a conservative profession, and
yet who managed to scale the legal
heights. Temby was only 38 when he
took silk, and when appointed Director
of Public Prosecutions was president of
the Law Council of Australia.
In his case, unconventional be-
haviour meant riding to court on a
motorcycle. Temby still rides his
motorbike, a Honda 350, when weather
permits but so far Canberra’s
coo) winter climate has
stopped him. For relaxation
he plays tennis and indulges
in a little light fiction reading.
He lives in a house in the
trendy Perth suburb of Sub-
iaco and most unusually
shows a pleasant willingness
to make himself available to
reporters to discuss points of
legal difficulty.
Temby was a partner in an
established Perth legal firm
that included the present Sen-
ate Opposition Leader, Sena-
tor Fred Chaney. Chaney says
they not only took in a good
deal of corporate work, but
cases for Aboriginals seeking
their share of justice as well.
“It was just too bad if the
businessmen objected to
sharing the waiting room with
our Aboriginal clients,” says
Chaney.
Together with another law-
yer, Chaney and Temby
founded the first shop-front
legal advice bureau in Perth.
For $2 anyone could come off
the street to consult the team
of volunteer lawyers. The bu-
reau has since been absorbed
into the legal aid system
and Temby was a foundation
member of the West Austra-
lian Legal Aid Commission.
Chaney owes Temby a debt of grati-
tude. At a time when he was becoming
actively involved with the Liberal Party,
Chaney believes that Temby “with
great generosity of spirit” held back
on his political activities to lessen the
workload on Chaney.
“I had no idea he was a Labor sup-
porter for many years,” Chaney says.
He was later to become a member of
the Subiaco City Council, and two years


ago contested for the ALP Sir Charles
Court’s state seat of Nedlands. It is
blue-ribbon Liberal and Temby did not
win it. And while he says he holds no
present political ambitions, people who
knew him say that in the long-term this
could change.
Temby grew up in Claremont, a
middle-class Perth suburb. His father
was a civil engineer working in the pub-
lic service who rose to become the state
director of industrial development.
Despite his middle-class upbringing
Temby chose to spend a year jackaroo-
ing straight after leaving school. At the
end of that year he joined, as an articled
clerk, the law firm in which he was later
to become a partner.
Temby took an honors degree in Law
from the University of Western Austra-
lia. People who remember him from
those days, say he did not find the stu-
dent initiation pranks terribly amusing.
Climbing a ladder with your trousers
unbuttoned may be funnier for the ob-
servers than it is for the observed.
Temby is a man a little above av-
erage height, not solidly built, but with
fine, well-chiselled features enhanced by
a head of thick hair, now turning a dis-
tinguished steel-grey.
He is at pains, when talking about
this side of his work, to stress the inde-
pendence of his office. Like a High
Court judge, he can only be removed by
an address from both houses of parlia-
ment. His salary is the same as a Federal
Court judge.
Temby’s robust independence has al-
ready been attested to by Attorney-Gen-
eral Senator Gareth Evans. It caused
something of a crisis when his report on
the Age tapes was tabled in parliament
last month.
It seems Temby wanted his report,
and that of the Australian Federal
Police tabled in their entirety. Cabinet
wanted to withhold the Federal Police
report and delete all names from
Temby’s report except those of Murphy
and Sydney solicitor, Morgan Ryan.
When Temby threatened to go public
on the issue, a special cabinet meeting
was held late on budget day and both
reports were tabled in full later that
night.
This independence seems to have
been a legacy of the Perth Modern
School where he was educated. It is a
quality shared, for example, by such
other old boys as Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and the departing Secretary of
the Treasury, John Stone.
The establishment of the office of the
Director of Public Prosecutions will not
be completed for at least another 12
months. At present, head office in Can-
berra has a staff of six lawyers, and the
Melbourne branch about 30, taking
over the functions of Special Prosecutor
Robert Redlich.
Senator Lewis replies to The Bulletin
LIBERAL SENATOR Austin Lewis
told parliament last week he had been
misrepresented in two stories published
recently in The Bulletin. “These articles
state my position most inaccurately and
then proceed to use these inaccuracies
as a basis for criticism,” he said.
Lewis, a senator from Victoria, was a
member of the select committee inquir-
ing into the conduct of
the High Court’s Justice
Lionel Murphy.
Lewis told the Senate he
objected to comments
about him in stories in the
September 4 issue. The first
was headed: “Exclusive:
Justice Murphy’s next
move.” The second was
titled: “Liberals are
undermining the High
Court.” The first story ac-
cused Australian Demo-
crats’ leader Senator Don
Chipp and two Liberals on
the committee, Lewis and
Senator Peter Durack, of
failing to pay regard to
submissions put to the
committee by Murphy’s
counsel - Sydney QCs Tom Hughes
and David Bennett.
“I deny this allegation,” Lewis said.
“I had regard to all the submissions,
oral and written, of Mr Justice
Murphy’s counsel. I refer to ... my dis-
senting report in which I specifically
mention part of the submission put to
the committee by Murphy’s counsel and
then I accept and adopt that sub-
mission.”
The story said the Labor Party would
argue that the conduct of the Liberals
on the committee was unjust and would
point out that the committee had written
to Murphy’s solicitors assuring them
that no adverse finding would be made
without first giving the judge the chance
to answer them.
Lewis said he rejected the suggestion
that he had been unjust. The Liberal
senators’ dissenting report had said:
“We stress that we are not finding that
misbehaviour has been proved.”
He also rejected as false the implica-
tion that only the Liberal senators had
decided that NSW Chief Magistrate
Clarrie Briese was a sincere and honest
witness. “This was the unanimous
finding of the committee,” he said.
Lewis said the second story defamed
him and was in contempt of the com-
mittee and the Senate.
Senator Austin Lewis
The allegation in the headline was
grossly unfair and untrue. “I have acted
as a member of the ... committee in
accordance with the requirements of a
resolution of the Senate and I believe it
is outrageous that I should be so ma-
ligned for having performed my duty.”
He added: “The article asserts that
my report was based on ‘pathetically in-
adequate’ evidence. The
article then purports to
outline that evidence.
However, that outline has
such serious inaccuracies
and omissions that it con-
stitutes a complete distor-
tion of the evidence.”
Lewis said the sugges-
tion in the story that he was
prepared to undermine
such an established institu-
tion as the High Court for
the sake of temporary pol-
itical advantage was false,
unfair and offensive.
The story said that if
Briese believed Murphy
had tried to interfere with
the course of justice he
should try to have the
judge committed for trial. It said: “If
Briese won’t do it, then presumably
Senators Peter Durack and Austin
Lewis will as they believe there is a
prima facie case against Murphy. But,
of course, the two Liberal senators
probably won’t want to take advantage
of the court system. The fashionable
thing nowadays is to have kangaroo
court inquiries where everything will be
alleged and nothing will be proved and
the tedious technicalities of a fair trial
will be set aside.”
Lewis told the Senate: “I am
outraged by the suggestion that I should
in any way be associated with a kanga-
roo court. I refer to ... my dissenting
report in which I make it clear there
should be a public hearing of a charge
in accordance with the principles of nat-
ural justice. Every member of the com-
mittee was concerned to ensure that, if
the committee moved into a judicial
phase (which we did not do), then, the
hearing should be in accordance with
(these) principles. So the suggestion of a
kangaroo court is contemptuous of
every member of the committee.”
Lewis said later the articles went be-
yond fair comment on him and were a
serious attack on his integrity. “These
assertions are false and are extremely
damaging to me,” he said. □


The Sydney branch office will open
at the end of this month with 50 lawyers
and take over the work of Special Pros-
ecutor Robert Gyles, QC. Both Gyles
and Redlich were appointed by the
Fraser government following the
Costigan royal commission reports.
“By the end of next year we will be
doing prosecuting work through our
own people in all states except the
Northern Territory,” says Temby. “We
will have about 150 lawyers, and rather
more than twice that number of support
staff.”
Temby has little time for court work
himself although a few weeks ago he
led the prosecution in a West Australian
drug case involving heroin worth $5O
million. Four out of the five defendants
were convicted. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Best-received
budget for
10 years -poll
LAST MONTH’S federal budget was
the best-received for 10 years.
In spite of the new tax on wine, it
was regarded more highly by voters
than last year’s which was the most
popular since the early years of the
Fraser government.
According to the Morgan Gallup
Poll, only 9 percent of Australians
thought the budget was bad. Almost
two-thirds (64 percent) rated it as av-
erage and 16 percent said it was good.
The Fraser government’s most popu-
lar budget was in 1976 when 23 percent
said it was good, 16 percent said it was
bad and 49 percent judged it average.
Only 20 percent (down 16 percent on
last year) of Australians think the
budget will increase the inflation rate
and only 16 percent (down 15 percent)
Treasurer Paul Keating: his second budget better-received than first
think the budget will cause unemploy-
ment to worsen.
In this Australia-wide survey taken
on the weekends of August 25/26 and
September 1/2, 1735 men and women
aged 14 and over were interviewed.
Those surveyed were asked: “Altogeth-
er, would you say the federal budget
was a good budget, an average budget
or a bad budget?”

People who believed it would in-
crease the rate of inflation made such
statements as “Won’t help in the long
run” and “Give $7 and take $23.”
Few reasons were given by those who
believed it would reduce the rate of in-
flation.
People who believed it would have
little effect on the rate of inflation
observed that “one budget cannot in-
crease inflation” and “Hard to control
prices.” □
Bruce Brown, SM
The Bulletin of August 28, 1984 pub-
lished an abridged version of the report
made by the New South Wales Solici-
tor-General, Mary Gaudron, into cer-
tain allegations by Chief Stipendiary
Magistrate Mr C. R. Briese concerning
committal proceedings against Mr
Morgan Ryan.
In the abridged report, reference was
made to Mr Bruce Brown, Deputy
Chairman of Magistrates. Mr Brown
has pointed out to us and has also pro-
tested to the Attorney-General that part
of the report could have been read to
suggest that he might have been ex-
pected out of friendship with a judge to
participate in a conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice. Neither the Solici-
tor-General nor The Bulletin intended
any such suggestion.
The Bulletin recognises the integrity,
high standing and reputation of Mr
Brown as Deputy Chairman of the New
South Wales Bench of Magistrates and
apologises for any hurt or embarrass-
ment which may have been caused by its
publication of the abridged report. □

Inside the brotherhood of bikers
Bikie mourners at the burial of a Bandido gang member at Sydney’s Rookwood cemetery.
By BRUCE STANNARD
and
SUSAN MOLLOY
VAAROOMING through the traffic on
his big, blue, laid-back Harley-David-
son last week, Laurie Keets looked not
unlike your typical hard-as-nails biker
long brown hair streaming in the
wind, a bushy Zapata moustache flying
from scowling jowls, black leather jack-
et with matching leather chaps.
Pulling up at lights beside a family
sedan brought the usual furtive glances
from a suburban mum and dad out for a
drive with the kids. But now some of the
kids were giving him the old biker salute
the middle finger of the right hand
jerked sharply upward. Others mim-
icked pistols and pow, pow, powed him
from the safety of the back seat.
Watching all this from a cab not far
away, I worried that Keets would
bounce off his bike and at the very least
kick in a door of the car and probably
bite an arm off a kid or two. Instead, he
shook his head, gunned the Harley and
roared off leaving them at the lights.
“That,” he said when I met him later
at the Harley-Davidson Riders Club, “is
typical of the kind of ‘s ...’ bikers are
copping after the Milperra shootout.
The assumption is that we’re all half-
crazed loons with shotguns.”
So far as Keets and most of his “out-
law” mates are concerned, nothing
could be further from the truth.
But uncovering the “truth” about
biker gangs and their intimate, rigidly
structured lifestyle is not easy. In an at-
tempt to gain at least some understand-
ing of the phenomenon, I sat down with
four men who had been members either
of the Comancheros or of other outlaw
gangs. Keets, Skull, Crankcase and
Gruntsy now are members of the editor-
ial staff of Ozbike, a glossy, well-
produced bi-monthly (circulation
25,000) which is the official publication
of the outlaw clubs.
Crammed with raunchy color pic-
tures of “birds, boobs and bikes,”
Ozbike tells only part of the story.
What emerged after an afternoon of
conversation were glimpses, and
glimpses only, of an organisation at
least as tightly run as any of the secret
lodges or private clubs we take for
granted in the so-called real world.
“The outlaw world is the real world
for us,” Skull said. “Once you’re into
this life, there’s no way you’re ever go-
ing to be straight again.”
According to Skull, outlaw society
rules are a lot tougher than those “on
the outside.” Loyalty absolute,
unquestioning loyalty to the brother-
hood is the single most important
rule. “With us,” Keets said, “loyalty lies
in the fact that we actually do care for


each other. There’s no make-believe in
it. If I got a phone call at 2 o’clock in the
morning from any one of the blokes I’m
associated with, saying they’re in
trouble, there’s no way I could say ‘No,
it’s too late to get involved at this hour.’
“The feelings of love and tenderness
and loyalty that develop within a good
family are exactly the same as we have,”
Keets said. “What we’ve got here is a
family.
“If some turkey came up and bashed
s ... out of your mother or brother or
sister, would you stand back and say,
‘OK, so what?’ You’d jump in there and
kick s ... out of the bastard, right? If
you’re going to share the blood and
sweat with someone, you’ve also got to
share the tears. The trouble with society
as we see it is that not many
people are prepared to make
that commitment to one an-
other or to themselves.”
According to Keets, the
public’s negative image of the
outlaws is based on fear
“fear of the unknown,” he
said. “The further and further
you get toward the outlaw
groups,” he said, “the more
emphatic the mateship be-
comes because you’re getting
further and further away from
society’s norms.”
Getting into an outlaw
club is not simply a matter of
paying a $lO membership fee.
A “prospect” or “nominee”
has to steel himself for up to
12 months as a“s .. .-kicker,”
a “gopher” and a “nobody.”
Skull said: “Starting off as
a prospect can be pretty hair-
raising, because there is every
possibility that you’ll be
bashed, for starters.” You had
to prove that your mates come
first, conform before being ac-
cepted.
“In the old days the initiation rituals
included being p .... don by all the
members and usually they’d throw up
on you and tip buckets of s ... over you
and you were expected to cop it. We
never washed our denims in those days.
The worse you stunk, the better it was. I
think we’ve all grown up since then.
“Initiation these days probably
means getting p .... d with the boys
and probably have beer tipped over
you. It’s more a celebration, a belated
‘bar mitzvah,’ than a rort these days.”
Keets, a former fireman in Sydney,
recalled his first meeting with the out-
laws: “I took one look at these blokes
and I thought, ‘Jesus, they’re a pack of
tough bastards.’ And they were. But I
was making the same mistake everyone
makes about bikers. Looks deceive.
“Once I got to know them, they were
great.
“The media love to portray all out-
laws as packs of brawling mongrels.
Physical violence is what gets into the
headlines.
“I’m not saying violence isn’t there
but it doesn’t exist to the extent that the
media make out.
“The Milperra thing is definitely the
exception to the rule.
“If we go to a pub, we don’t look for
trouble. But, at the same time, if trouble
comes our way, we don’t take any s ...
either. If someone tries us out, we’re not
going to back off.
“In some of the outlaw clubs the
tendency is to go out looking for fights.
It’s a great buzz for these guys to roar
around and punch people out. I’ve
reached a stage where I don’t have to

prove myself; I know how tough I am.”
To the outlaws, the bike invariably
a Harley-Davidson is honored above
everything else except outlaw brothers.
“The motorcycle is you,” Skull said.
“There is no separation: You’re one
with the machine or you’re not a fair-
dinkum biker.
“There are blokes who see their bikes
as a shortcut to manhood but you can’t
just walk into a bike shop, plonk down
$7OOO for a Harley and ride out a Hell’s
Angel. To us, that’s a . . .-about-face:
The bike doesn’t make the biker. You
develop an affinity for your bike and, if
you’re at one with it, you don’t thrash it.
People tend to think of bikers tearing up
the freeways but that’s a load of crap.
Blokes who really care for their bikes
are quite happy doing 40ks. They know
what a Harley-Davidson can do; they
don’t have to prove it to the world.”
HARLEY-Davidson-riding former
schoolteacher, former Methodist minis-
ter John Smith says: “A lot of the
women in the bike scene are there be-
cause, I think, like it or lump it, they
want men who are men. Whether that is
right or wrong, that is reality. A lot of
them want to see men being strong.
And, boy, some of the women in the
bike scene are aggressive. Unlike in the
straight world, women in the bike scene
are allowed to be violent or angry. The
order of importance in most bikers’
lives are bikes, beer and boobs in that
order. But there are some beautiful rela-
tionships. You can find bikers who
would die for their kids, who love their
de facto or wife. They have learned ag-
gression from an aggressive society,
from being pushed to the edge in so-
ciety.”
Smith 12 years ago formed the God’s
Squad. He has been addressing himself
to a problem other than the Milperra
shootout which is worrying the Hell’s
Angels of Melbourne.
The secretary of the city’s chapter of
that club, Ball Bearing, was in court last
week appealing against a conviction for
possession of heroin. He lost. By Thurs-
day night, Bearing was in jail for three
months.
Smith, who does counselling, sat
with him in court.
Victoria has about 40 biker gangs.
The Hell’s Angels, whose numbers are
small probably only about 150 genu-
ine members in Australia and 1000
worldwide are of the old school.
The original Hell’s Angels were born
of American soldiers who found them


selves to be outcasts after
World War 11. They took to
the highways in defiance of a
society which had spurned
them. Similarly, some of the
Comancheros in Sydney are
Vietnam veterans.
Bruce Ruxton, head of the
Victorian branch of the Re-
turned Servicemen’s League,
observed on radio last week
that the brutal battle between
Bandidos and Comancheros
had shown that such men
needed to be in the armed
forces to direct undisci-
plined violence into a dis-
ciplined training for the good
of society. Bikers in Mel-
bourne sneer at this, although
they often have publicly and
angrily expressed fierce patri-
otism.
Meanwhile, they battle it
out in their sub-culture. The
God’s Squad is a sub-culture
within the sub-culture.
“Many bikers are intellectually as-
tute nihilists who are angry,” Smith, 42,
and a father of three, says.
“What our society says is that there is
no meaning in life but we must live
meaningfully. The bikers say there is no
meaning in life. ... Bikers are often
working-class guys who get whacked ort
alcohol to kill the meaning of exist-
ence.”
With his band of up to 30 God’s
Squad members, Smith tries to show
that there is a meaning to life not only
to the biker gangs but also to students,
to inner-city squatters and punks, to the
unemployed and the lost.
Smith says: “I would plead not just
at the level of the bike world but for all
of society to see the problems we can
locate in the biker shootout are endemic
to our society. Bikers are just one of
dozens of groups in society. They are all
an escape in which to express their rage.
“Bikers are one part of society which
is allowing itself to live as it believes.
“A football club will make a bigger
mess in a hotel than a biker club will.”
Smith refuses to be typecast.
He is a pacifist with a photograph of
an F-l 11 fighter-bomber on the wall. He
hunts wild goats but keeps pet ones in
the spacious back garden of his outer-
suburban home. Three well-polished
Magnum guns are on the walls of a
study choked with books on Australian
literature and history, theology and 60s
pop culture essays. He is anti-war but
fascinated by modern ballistics. He
preaches Christian love and a philo-
sophical and spiritual meaning to life to
those who see no meaning and whose
notions of love rarely extend beyond
the fierce loyalty and brotherhood of
biker gang camaraderie. □
The mountain men come to town: a political match for the conservationists
CONSERVATION
Greenies feel
the lash of the
mountain men
By TIM DUNCAN
RURAL AUSTRALIA would do well
by taking to heart the lessons of the
struggle of Victoria’s high country
cattlemen to retain their traditional ac-
cess to the alpine runs.
Of course, it helps to have a bard
such as Banjo Paterson pen a useful
poem and it’s mighty convenient if that
poem can be turned into a blockbusting
film just when governments are mutter-
ing ominously about proclaiming alpine
national parks.
But, despite these advantages, the
modern heirs of the Man From Snowy
River do not trust governments and es-
pecially do not trust “greenies.” So the
Victorian government’s announcement
of its intention to create a single, linked
alpine national park was greeted by a
public relations coup that left the
greenies gaping and the government
miffed.
In effect, the cattlemen used a politi-
cal success as a springboard for a drive
into the hearts of metropolitan Mel-
bourne.
With the announcement that the gov-
ernment would create a park that would
accommodate high country cattle gra-
zing immediately condemned by con-
servationists as a fatal compromise of
what a national park should be the
cattlemen set in train a planned ride
through Melbourne to the steps of Par-
liament House.
No wonder the government was an-
noyed. Despite intensive lobbying from
conservationists, it had agreed to rec-
ommendations that preserved for the
high country graziers access to 95.5 per-
cent of the runs to be included in the
park.
Given that Australian Labor Party
policy was to eradicate cattle from na-
tional parks, concessions to the graziers
might reasonably have been expected to
have prompted at least the breaking out
of a high country side of beef with a
couple of kegs thrown in.
Not so. Instead, the cattlemen rep-
resenting about 100 families or-
ganised themselves with military preci-
sion and put 300 riders with another 200
people on drays and four-wheel-drive
vehicles into every Victorian television
room for the best part of a week.
Their message hardly required com-
mentary. With broad-brimmed hats,
moleskin trousers, Williams boots and
impressively battered “Dryzabone” oil-
skins, they were the genuine Australian
pastoral article.
Fronting for them was Graeme
Stoney, an articulate landowner from
Mansfield and chief tactician of the
Mountain District Cattleman’s Associa-
tion of Victoria. Stoney looked into the
cameras, proclaimed that the alpine
national park legislation inevitably
would result in the extinction of some-
thing truly Australian and laid the
blame squarely on the greenies.
It was an exercise in audacity de-
signed to guarantee that the city popula-
tion would defend the Australian cul-
tural heritage.
“We took a very aggressive stand the
minute we got the news that the park
was going ahead,” Stoney said.
Over recent years, the graziers have

campaigned for their survival against
conservationists who argued that cattle
were damaging the fragile ecosystems of
the alpine plains. Now that the
cattlemen have held off moves against
them in the short term, they are thinking
about the long term.
Explains Stoney: “Once they declare
that park despite their assurances
there’s no avoiding that, under present
national parks structure and attitudes,
grazing is seen as a non-conforming use.
So we have to oppose the park.”
They simply turned the tables on the
greenies and employed public relations
techniques which would have done the
Franklin dam protesters proud.
The graziers organised a 10-strong
executive and delegated police liaison
to those with State Emergency Service
experience. Clive Hodge set up a gath-
ering point at Dandenong. Jack and
Charlie Lovick brought in 60 riders with
mounts from Mansfield; Rusty Connley
organised 20 riders from Omeo, Don
Kneebone brought in nine truckloads of
horses and riders from Mount Beauty.
Stoney and Jack Commins worked on
the tactics.
“We were going to ride at the begin-
ning of the spring session (of parlia-
ment),” said Stoney, “and we thought
that the government had decided to an-
nounce the park and our part in it in
.order to stop us from riding. So we de-
cided to use the impetus of their an-
nouncement to announce our ride. They
gave us a tremendous launch and it was
poor tactics on the government’s part.”
As it turned out, the national park
announcement which culminates some
10 years of controversy, conservationist
lobbying and local criticism and vol-
umes of land use reports and recom-
mendations was entirely overshadowed
by the ride of the high country grazing
families into Melbourne and the con-
servationists were put on the defensive
now being held responsible for the
potential demise of the mountain men.
To describe the reaction of the direc-
tor of the Australian Conservation
Foundation, Dr Geoff Mosley, as sour
grapes would be an understatement.
“It’s greenie versus greedy,” he said.
As Mosley sees it, the cattlemen have
presumed a divine right to exploitation
of crown land for private gain putting
the state’s chief water catchments and
precious alpine ecology at risk.
What seems to matter more to both
sides, though, is the extent to which the
cattlemen have changed and want to
change further government views of
what a national park should be.
“The idea of a national park as we
have it in Australia does not include the
grazing of cattle: It’s quite foreign to
our concept of a park,” Mosley said. As
he sees it, a national park follows inter-
national conventions to which Australia

The following
corporate stones
are true, only
the names have
been changed.
fcfcCoopers & Lybrand were asked
to look at a proposed acquisition,
Jamison Fabrications* buying Amal
Sheet Metal*.
Jamison’s merchant bank had
recommended the deal and was
standing ready to provide the funds.
We discovered that Amal’s stock
and work in progress was vastly
overvalued, a matter of $2 million
in $6 million.
Secondly, Coopers & Lybrand
noticed that the plant and
equipment (which is tax deductible)
was priced below market value.
So we told them to pay more
for the plant and less for goodwill,
which isn’t tax deductible.
By restructuring, we saved
Jamison $4 million out of $l5
million.^^
Parsons & Co. Ltd!, an old well
established company, had an
enviable profit record.
But lately, the management had
become uneasy that perhaps
future prospects weren’t so bright.
However, they couldn’t tell if
their worries were justified.
Certainly their auditing,
taxation and legal advisers hadn’t
reported any warning signs.
And Parsons had no strategic
planning adviser.
So they had no orderly method
of assessing what would happen
DDB 3277.033
in the long term if they continued
their business as it was.
Fortunately Parsons decided to
call in management consultants
from Coopers & Lybrand.
We observed that Parsons were
overly dependent on one market.
And our investigations proved
that the products and methods
that had served them so well in the
past were now inappropriate for
that market.
The company was, in fact,
marching towards a precipice.
Parsons’ auditing, taxation and
advice had been the very best.
But without a strategic planner
to complete the picture, it could
have been fatally incomplete.
Coopers & Lybrand proposed
a forward plan that has now set
Parsons on a path to secure the
company’s future.
%% Several major companies
were well advanced in their merger
plans when they decided to get
Coopers & Lybrand involved, just
as a precaution.
We found that their method of
merging would have caused
significant tax liability to certain
shareholders.
The very people whose consent
was needed if the merger was to
happen at all.
Coopers & Lybrand not only
devised an arrangement that
avoided the tax liability.
We had it approved in advance
by the tax commissioner.
The shareholders were never
aroused to become obstructive,
and the deal went ahead.^^
From these stories, one thing is clear.
Getting piecemeal advice from
bankers, management consultants, tax
advisers and lawyers can be hazardous.
Because each sees your business
from his own limited viewpoint.
Advice which may be sound in one
area, can seriously disadvantage you in
another. A unified strategy is needed.
That is why Coopers & Lybrand retain
highly qualified professionals in finance,
tax and management consulting, under
one roof. So they can consult with each
other, and with your legal advisers if
necessary, before advising you.
Although you may know us only as
chartered accountants, fully 60% of our
business is nowin giving business advice.
Finally, if you need money, it’s our job
to find it in the market as cheaply as
possible. Rather than to push you into
borrowing from us.

is a signatory and the cattlemen’s con-
tinued access in the proposed alpine
park shows Victoria to be way out of
line.
“A national park should be an area
that is maintained in a natural condi-
tion. Uses that result in a change in the
environment are not acceptable,”
Mosley adds.
Sitting between the two groups, the
government is very careful about what it
says of the cattlemen’s demands, accept-
ing that grazing practices have
improved this century on the high
country. “Our view is that the cattlemen
of today are very careful,” a spokesman
for the ministry involved said.
The cattlemen are delighting in stick-
ing in the boot. As Stoney sees it, the
Australian Conservation Foundation
has become the “BLF of
the academic world . . .
People look to the conser-
vation movement for guid-
ance. If it promoted sen-
sible and practical conser-
vation philosophies, in-
stead of selfish and elitist
aims, then their member-
ship would quadruple and
their credibility with gov-
ernments would rise.”
By “sensible and practi-
cal,” Stoney means the art
of the possible not the
locking away of a major re-
newable resource. He has
in mind the rights of
timbercutters, graziers and beekeepers
in short, production.
Mosley, on the other hand, is con-
cerned that people such as Stoney see
the high country as a private resource.
Mosley refers to Stoney’s use of his
cattleman’s hut for his commercial tours
guiding cross-country ski parties into
the alps.
Running cattle on the crown land of
the high country is a closed shop. The
licence fee is low perhaps a fifth per
season of comparable agistment fees.
Not surprisingly, the families zealously
guard their grazing runs.
The same names crop up throughout
the alpine region ... the Faithfulls of
Omeo and Benambra, the Commins
family of Ensay, the Lovicks of Mans-
field and the Treasures of Dargo.
There is no auction system for the
annual licences to take cattle up to the
high country for summer fattening and
rationalists within the bureaucracy
doubtless would like to impose such a
system.
On the other hand, the high country
families are uniquely skilled in the ways
of the runs they manage. They are tough
and resourceful and because of this they
have quickly developed into a political
match for the conservationists they dis-
trust. □

Whitehead finds
the Senate
a bullring
By ANTHONY HILL
AUSTRALIAN Broadcasting Corpora-
tion managing director Geoffrey
Whitehead was forced very much on the
defensive when he faced a hostile
session last week in a Senate estimates
committee hearing.
The hearing, in the Senate chamber,
was marked by heated questioning over
the ABC restructuring and the decision
to recognise homosexual
relationships for staff en-
titlements.
There were barbed ex-
changes between the sena-
tors at one stage, Indus-
try and Commerce Minis-
ter Senator John Button re-
ferred to “fundamentally
narrow-minded racist atti-
tudes in respect of the
people who might be ap-
pointed to the ABC” an
expression he later with-
drew.
To people there, it
seemed Whitehead was be-
ing put through the
shredder and while he was surrounded
by a phalanx of ABC executives none
intervened to help him during the most
difficult sections of the examination.
For example, Whitehead said that in-
ternal legal advice was that the decision
to regard homosexual relationships as
much the same as heterosexual ties was
soundly based and that there were pre-
cedents within the Australian Public
Service, adding “that may now be in
doubt... I do not know.”
And when he told Senator Brian
Harradine (Ind, Tas) that the ABC
Board had received no requests from
members of parliament to reverse the
decision, there was absolute silence in
the chamber when Harradine said:
“You have received one from me.”
Whitehead replied that he had not per-
sonally seen it.
At one stage, Whitehead denied that
he was “throwing his hands up” over
the line of questioning. He said he had
appeared before estimates committees
in other parliaments but found his ex-
perience before the Senate “a rather in-
teresting chapter for my future mem-
oirs.”
Whitehead said he believed it would
be one or two years before there was a
sense of “corporate loyalty” following
the restructuring of the ABC. He also:


■ Acknowledged there were “indi-
vidual concerns and worries” among
the staff but disagreed with Senator
Peter Rae (Lib, Tas) that the sense of
disillusionment was other than among a
small minority.
■ Clashed repeatedly with Harradine
over the homosexual decision, saying
that it was “a routine development” of
equal opportunity, anti-discrimination
and affirmative action policies.
Whitehead would not be drawn on
statements by deputy ABC chairwoman
Wendy McCarthy that too few Austra-
lians were capable of filling the top jobs
in the country’s public broadcasting sys-
tem. Instead, he told Rae that when the
total management structure was devel-
oped there would be “a reasonable bal-
ance” between people appointed from
inside and outside the ABC.
Rae then questioned Button over
concerns that “a large number of non-
Australians” had been introduced to the
ABC ... at which point Button made his
remark about racist attitudes.
(Whitehead, an Englishman, was ap-
pointed to the ABC from the New Zea-
land Broadcasting Corporation.)
When Rae strongly objected to the
use of the word “racist,” Button with-
drew. But asked if he had any further
questions, Rae said: “I doubt if there is
value in asking further questions.”
Afterwards, Whitehead said many of
the “perfectly reasonable, understand-
able concerns” among ABC staff would
be removed by Christmas. Invited by
Senator Peter Cook (Lab, WA) to say if
the problems here were different to
those in the restructuring of the NZBC,
Whitehead replied: “The only thing that
is different is the amount of speculation,
which is wholly inaccurate in parts of
the press, and some of the public com-
ments by people in Australia which go
far beyond anything I experienced in
nine years in New Zealand.” □
AVIATION
Overshadowed
by a battle
of the titans
A short-haul British Aerospace 146-200 in Ansett Airlines of Western Australia colors
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
HAD ALAN BOND been at Farn-
borough Air Show last week, he may
well have ordered a swift repaint of the
two huge lighter-than-air machines that
his companies are about to finance.
As tens of thousands of people
watched, Airship Industries’ cigar-
shaped Series 500 and experimental
Series 600 models drifted almost noisily
in the Indian summer sky over the latest
jets and military aircraft on display in
this international showcase. Bond
would have been tempted to paint gi-
gantic beer cans on the airships to get
extra promotional value out of them.
Meanwhile, as development costs
run off the graph, he has taken virtual
control of the British company and
pledged another 10 million pounds
(about $l5 million) for development of
the 600 model.
Commercially, the Swan promotion
would have been worthwhile. Farn-
borough 84 opened in weather which
would have done credit to an Australian
February and beer has been selling in
Britain like a brewer’s dream. But it is
still regarded as awfully bad form to
promote anything apart from aviation
at the hallowed venue.
Even the traditional pattern of
Farnborough, however, like England’s
cricketing pride, has been sliding down-
hill because of the economic transform-
ation increasingly calling the tune in the
aviation business.
Sikorsky, bidding for the Australian
navy and air force orders, used the show
to announce a ploy to get its helicopters
as well into the Royal Air Force long
the tied market of Britain’s independent
manufacturer Westland, which also is
bidding for the Australian order.
Sikorsky advanced a strategy both
manufacturers have used in Australia: it
announced a partnership agreement
with commuter-plane manufacturer
Shorts of Belfast and that other most
hallowed of British institutions, Rolls-
Royce Aero Engines. “We staged this
announcement for Farnborough be-
cause winning is what the commercial
game is all about,” Bob Carroll, spokes-
man for Sikorsky, told me. “After the
conference, several of your colleagues
in the British press told me it was bad
A DC3 rule
applied to
today’s jets
IF YOU want to fly a long way, sooner
or later you have to venture over water.
Strangely, the international rules for so
doing are confusing and irrational. Aus-
tralia subscribes to the International
Civil Aviation Organisation’s “90-min-
ute” rule which says that, with a twin-
engined plane, you must be within 90
minutes flight time of an alternate air-
port if one engine fails.
In the United States, it’s a 60-minute
rule although changes are being
pressed.
Today’s big twin-jets, the Airbus
A3OO, the A3lO and the coming A 320,
are capable of immense ranges which


An airship goes through its paces: no Swanning around
form to promote something non-British
at Farnborough.”
In the British aviation establishment
dwelling on the glories of de
Havilland, Bristol, Handley Page and
other names which have been sucked
into the black holes of the Rolls-Royce
and British Aerospace conglomerates
Farnborough is still largely a British oc-
casion for the greater glory of an indus-
try which has vied with shipbuilding,
steel, car-making and now coal to waste
the maximum amount of national re-
sources.
The cool change of privatisation and
accountability, however, is sweeping
through these industries despite the
head-in-the-past views of members of
the handlebar moustache brigade.
British Aerospace (BAe) is genera-
ting a lot of money, mainly in work for
European consortiums in both military
and civilian projects, and has been
strongly pushing two ideas of its own. It
used Farnborough to launch a single-
seater attack fighter version of the Hawk
trainer (selling well to many buyers, in-
cluding the United States navy) which
could be attractive to smaller air forces.
Also, for Farnborough, it painted up in
Ansett’s Airlines of Western Australia
colors its prototype 146-200 four-
engined short-haul jet of which Ansett
has bought two and taken options on
more.
Ansett is getting the extended 146-
200. The -100 is widely in service. And
BAe also announced at Farnborough a
-300 version which soon will be on offer
to Australia.
Apart from the white 146 with the
shooting star Southern Cross emblem
on the tail, the only other Australian
presence was a mock-up of the Austra-
lian Aircraft Consortium’s A-20 trainer
(a development of the A-10 Wamira,
which the RAAF is buying). It was a
limp display with no spirit, un-
fortunately. Westland, which will build
the aircraft in Britain if it gets the RAF
nod, does not seem to be promoting it
very hard.
The word is very strongly out that
Switzerland’s Pilatus, with which BAe
has teamed, is by far the front-runner.
The British aerospace giant is trying
to sell its Hawk trainers to the Swiss in
are being extended to 10,000 to
12,000 km. Boeing is aiming at the great-
er distances with its 737, 757, and 767
twins. Qantas is buying a 767-200 ER,
with the ER standing for “extended
range.” Sooner or later, operators will
want to fly over oceans on twin engines
virtually without limit.
Under the 90-minute rule, Qantas
could fly easily to near-Pacific and
Asian destinations; the only no-go areas
are in the mid-Atlantic and in the Pa-
cific, notably between the US mainland
and Honolulu. Operators are seeking
dispensation from the regulatory au-
thorities to open up these services.
Doubts and “what ifs” have been touch-
ing off a major aviation debate.
Engines are reliable and the odds
against shutdown of two for different
reasons (which means excluding recent
instances where aircraft have been
underfuelled and run out of kerosene)
are astronomical. But, argue the oppo-
nents, there is little experience in over-
water twin operations.
When one engine goes, the other
must be put under strain. The electrical
and hydraulic systems, which depend
on the remaining engine, will be under
greater strain.
A big difference in philosophy has
developed between the two major
manufacturers.
Airbus says that the four-engined air-
craft will be needed, partly because of
increased reliability but also because of
the high weights involved in carrying
fuel to fly 12,000 km or so.
A twin-engined aircraft must be
capable of completing a take-off at
maximum weight on one engine if the
other fails at take-off. Airbus argues that
the super-power engines needed would
be impractical and uneconomical.
Boeing believes that twins capable of
the take-off hurdle can be designed.
Both sides agree that reliability of en-
gines and systems can be improved to
where operation of 90 minutes from an
alternate is possible. An early extension,
after much proving of reliability, would
be to a 120-minute alternate which
would virtually open up the world to the
big twins.
It is ironic that the 90-minute rule
was a patched-up compromise that
arose out of the reliance placed on the
DC3 in postwar years and since has
taken on the semblance of holy writ.
That is not to say that it should be
thrown aside but, rather, that the relia-
bility and hazards involved should be
explored systematically.
The evidence could well emerge that
90 minutes is too long for general appli-
cation and that a shorter mandatory
time should be introduced to allow
specific exceptions to individual carriers
and aircraft which have demonstrated
technical and maintenance excellence.
John Stackhouse


an order far bigger than that for the
helicopters Westland hopes to sell the
Royal Australian Navy.
All other things being equal, the
commercial imperative is likely to prove
much stronger than the lingering (and
often patronising) ex-colonial ties,
which is how the Australian industry is
regarded here.
The most fascinating spectacle wher-
ever they come into conflict is the battle
between the titans, Boeing of Seattle
and the European upstart Airbus In-
dustrie. It has come to resemble a
mating display by dinosaurs, each try-
ing to woo the big world airlines, some
of whom could well become extinct in
the next year or so.
Although some carriers are still
struggling, many are firmly back in
profit. But, as they are at last generating
money, they will also be spending.
Because of age, costs and restrictions
such as those on noise, some 1200 air-
liners will need to be withdrawn by
around 1990.
Estimates of passenger and cargo
growth, which forecasters say will come
in waves rather than as a steady in-
crease, point to an average of between 5
and 6 percent on a cumulative base.
This points to the need in the next 10
years or so for some 7000 aircraft worth
about $450 billion. With such orders in
the offing, the rivalry is reaching an in-
tense level.
The poignancy of Farnborough this
year was the possibility of it being a last
hurrah for two of the major players of
the Sporty Game (after the book of the
same name).
First to make a pitch was Boeing’s
top marketing man Joe Sutter.
His message was the 757, 767 and the
747 were going to fly further and do
more for the fortunate airlines that
chose them. To take an example, he dis-
closed that after the 747-300 (the
stretched upper-deck version which
Qantas is buying) will come a super 747.
It may not be any bigger than the -300
but it will be lighter, have better engines
and electronics and be capable of flying
Sydney-Los Angeles or Singapore-Lon-
don non-stop with full loads.
Sutter also spoke strongly about ex-
tending the range of twin-engined 767 s
and 757 s over oceans including the Pa-
cific and the Atlantic (see panel).
Here Boeing comes head on against
Airbus Industrie which is talking about
a four-engined, 200-passenger aircraft
so far designated TA-11 for this role. It
would, in effect, be an extremely long-
range version of the smaller A3lO
Airbus.
The star performers next day were
Airbus president Bernard Lathiere and
executive vice-president Roger Beteille.
Airbus this year launched its twin-
engined A 320, with 150-seat capacity,

which it would dearly love to sell to
TAA and Air New Zealand. It repre-
sents the state of the art in technology
which now means airframe construction
of lightweight materials, engines and
flight controls. This sort of development
is immensely costly but it pays off in
reducing fuel consumption.
In the future are the TA-11 long-
ranger and a stretched version of the
A3OO Airbus (designated the TA-9 at
this stage), to lift about 350 passengers.
The sweep of passenger aircraft
encompasses all the objectives of which
Beteille and Kracht dreamed in the 60s.
At that stage, it seemed impossible to
create a commercial industry that could
compete with the Americans one that
would be technologically advanced and
which would unite Europe. All this has
been done.
With change in the wind, the back-
ward and dependent status of Austra-
lian industry was a sadness. A bit of
Bond brashness was the touch we
needed. □
WELFARE
Assets test
start likely for
next March
By ANTHONY HILL
AFTER LAST year’s false start, the fed-
eral government’s assets test on pen-
sions seems likely to pass through par-
liament during its budget session. The
modified test will apply from next
March if it gets through the Senate.
Senator Janine Haines, speaking on
welfare for the Australian Democrats,
says that she thinks the current version
generally speaking “is an improve-
ment.” Asset exemption levels have
been indexed for inflation a sticking
point last year and the
family home is not inclu-
ded in the test.
If the Democrats decide
to support the bill (as the
government expects them
to do), the attitude of the
Liberal and National par-
ties in the Senate will be
largely irrelevant. The
numbers will be there to
pass legislation.
But the decision to in-
clude the assets test in
budget legislation to in-
crease overall welfare pen-
sions has left the coalition
in a delicate political situa-
tion. They oppose the test
Janine Haines
but to vote against it would be to vote
against a budget bill something that
Opposition Leader Andrew Peacock
has said he would not do.
High level talks are taking place
within the coalition to decide tactics.
Peacock’s inclination is to move to with-
draw that section of the bill dealing with
the assets test but this would expose him
to charges of going back on his word.
The coalition voted for all bills
flowing from last year’s
budget including, for
example, new tax scales on
lump sum superannuation
payments even though
opposed to the principles of
some legislation.
The assets test puts coali-
tion members into something
of a bind. To vote for the
legislation, given the volatility
of the issue in the run up to
the election, might equally ex-
pose the opposition to claims
of a “sell-out.”
Social Security Minister,
Senator Don Grimes, is not
tying the budget pension in-
creases to the passage of the
assets test even though they
are included in the same bill.
If the Senate wants to deal
with the assets test separately,
he says, he will go along with
it.
The legislation would
affect about 40,000 people,
most in the upper income
bracket, and the test would save an es-
timated $5O million in a full year. Its
features are essentially those Grimes
outlined months ago.
The test is to apply to income or
assets not both and the benefit to be
paid on whichever test gives the lower
pension. The family home and perma-
nent fixtures, including a swimming
pool, are excluded as are military
medals and a pre-paid cemetery plot
but furniture, jewellery and other per-
sonal affects count.
Single pensioners
would be able to have
assets worth $70,000 and
couples $lOO,OOO before
the test applied. Those not
owning homes would have
the limit increased by an
extra $50,000.
The pension reduces on
a sliding scale, by $2 a
week for every $lOOO of
assets over these limits,
cutting out at $116,000 for
single homeowners and
$177,000 for couples.
Again, the limits are
$50,000 higher for those
who don’t own homes.
Pensioners would have
to estimate the net market value of their
assets and shares would be valued at the
last sale price.
As from June 1 this year, gifts to fam-
ily members or charitable donations
worth more than $2OOO a year or $4OOO
for couples will be included as part of
the assets test. This rule also applies to
any assets disposed of over these limits
without what is described as adequate
financial return. □

of the staggering costs $1 million a
day in the development stage and $2.1
billion overall. The expenditure did not
falter as the world gas market softened,
but the smiles in Western Australia van-
ished as the short-lived resource boom
of the early 80s foundered, taking with
it several West Australian developments
that supposedly would be operating
today on North-West Shelf gas.
Another savage blow came with the
Japanese tardiness about the liquid nat-
ural gas export phase. Development of
the second offshore platform was put on
the backburner and Perth engineering
companies earlier convinced they were
on the wave of progress suddenly found
themselves on a big dumper.
The pessimism appears to have eased
and the capital investment created by
the project has outshone the benefits
created by the earlier nickel and iron
ore booms. The project also has created
from scratch a significant offshore ser-
vice industry.
Slowly and steadily primarily be-
cause the state government and the
State Energy Commission of WA are
locked into the project the energy use
position in the state will change. A 10-
year projection on energy use shows
that oil-based fuels (mainly for trans-
port) now represent 62 percent usage,
coal holds 20 percent, gas 15 percent
and wood and others the balance. In 10
years gas is expected to take up 40 per-
cent while coal usage, mainly because of
the shelf’s influence, should cease to
grow.
The shelf has already halted the for-
ward march of coal after its renaissance
in the late 70s, despite the significant
new discoveries in Western Australia
outside the Collie basin. These include
the Hill River deposits in the Northern
Wheatbelt and those in the Grass Patch
region north of Esperance.
The shelf also has destroyed the
search for gas elsewhere in the state and
companies with some recent discoveries
have conceded they have virtually no
hope of a domestic market.
Strata Oil’s Woodada field has been
able to provide a transitional supply to
the state grid until the shelf supply
builds up on the 1500 km Dampier to
Wagerup trunk line.
North-West Shelf gas has been mov-
ing south since mid August. After July
next year the energy commission will
face take or pay provisions. It could be
saddled with a surplus resulting from
the over-estimations of a few years
which could mean at least 30 percent of
the gas will not be needed.
That predicament, on top of some
apparent heartburn over government
financing of the Dampier-Wagerup
pipeline, eroded relationships between
the commission’s hierarchy and the in-
coming Burke government.

The relationships appear to have
improved, though the commission has
had some of its energy planning powers
trimmed. The most significant move be-
ing the task force for the proposed alu-
mina smelter in the south west of the
state having the ear of cabinet ahead of
the commission.
Eventually the smelter is destined to
be coal-fired but it would solve a big
government headache by utilising the
excess gas in the formative stages.
One politician told The Bulletin the
style of last week’s opening fanfare was
largely for the benefit of the Japanese
guests who seemed impressed with the
turnout.
Even if the Japanese had been only
even slightly swayed by the occasion
then it would have been money well
spent because the export phase of the
operation would dramatically improve
economics for the shelf partners, boost
Australia’s flagging engineering indus-
try and produce state royalties which
Premier Brian Burke said “should gen-
erate more revenue and state royalties
than the iron ore industry” which is
worth about $lOO million annually.
The shelf’s Rankin A platform is the
biggest of its type, and is state-of-the-art
in terms of electronic monitoring, sys-
tems control, safety procedure and
handling cyclones. The product of years
of planning and studying case histories
in the North Sea and elsewhere, Rankin
A is still talked of proudly by project
people for the first major engineering
feat it provided dropping the 16,000
tonnes platform jacket into 125 metres
of water to within a metre of the target
position.
Rankin A is producing from two
wells, has just perforated a third of a
total 34 planned production wells, tap-
ping a sandstone reservoir 3km below
the seabed.
It is 134 km offshore and has to be
serviced by helicopters and by regular
supply ships. There has to be a ship al-
ways on standby for emergencies. □

package tours
to a war zone
By ANNE WOODHAM
THE IDEA of a Northern Ireland
Tourist Board does seem a little farcical.
Come to tranquil Belfast for a peaceful,
get-away-from-it-all holiday. Yet the
Northern Ireland Tourist Board exists
and a delegation led by its chairman, Sir
John Swinson, is visiting Australia and
New Zealand this month to drum up
business.
Public relations director lan Hill ad-
mits their image suffers from a handi-
cap. The recent tour of Noraid leader
Martin Galvin and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary’s over-enthusiastic recep-
tion, seen on world-wide news bulletins,
did nothing to make his job easier. Men-
tion plastic bullets and he whimpers.
But as many as 850,000 Australians
and 200,000 New Zealanders are of
Downtown Belfast: better hospitality is promised for Australians
Northern Irish stock. The Victorian
premier William Irvine came from
Newry and Sir Samuel McCaughey,
who pioneered irrigation, was born near
Ballymena. Less respectable, perhaps,
but infinitely more renowned, bush-
ranger Ned Kelly’s family hailed from
County Tyrone.
In 1983 6800 Australians visited
Northern Ireland, many to see family
and trace their roots. Hill believes the
ancestor quest that attracts hundreds of
thousands of Americans, Canadians,
Australians and New Zealanders to Eire
could be exploited in the north and per-
haps with greater rewards for the de-
scendants. Irish genealogy is notorious-
ly haphazard because of a lack of writ-
ten records but the parish clergy of Prot-
estant Ulster kept meticulous accounts
of births, deaths and marriages which
are traceable through the public records
office in Belfast.
Ancestral voices apart, many tourists
are unaware that at least two of Ire-
land’s most famous beauty spots are in
Ulster. The mountains of Mourne sweep
down to the sea in County Down and
Giant’s Causeway, one of the most spec-
tacular rock formations in the world, is
on the north coast of County Antrim.
But 14 years of The Troubles, as the
province’s sectarian war is known eu-
phemistically, have inclined the Austra-
lian traveller to the belief that Northern
Ireland might not be the healthiest place
to visit. “We haven’t lost a tourist yet,”
Hill said with a certain black humor. It’s
true. Only the unfortunate Northern
Irish have suffered.
There is good news for the Northern
Ireland Tourist Board, however. Deaths
from The Troubles are de-
clining. According to statistics
from the Northern Ireland In-
formation Service, since 1978
the annual total of people
killed has been well under
100, compared with nearly
500 in 1972.
This is fewer than the an-
nual road toll. One has more
chance of being hit by a car
than a sniper’s bullet.
Ironically, it is the very
lack of traffic, queues and lit-
ter that makes Northern Ire-
land a joy to visit. Ulster’s
lakes and mountains are tran-
quil, its coast line beautiful.
The people, on both sides
of the sectarian divide, are
among the friendliest and
most hospitable on Earth.
Tables groan with food,
glasses are filled constantly.
An Australian accent will
make you welcome at every
hearth, every inn, every vil-
lage. It’s just each other they
can’t abide. □

QUEENSLAND
Parliamentary
summons threat
to professor
Queensland Speaker Warner: sought advice
THE COURIER MAIL
By DENIS REINHARDT
WHILE THE Queensland parliament is
in recess for a fortnight, Speaker John
Warner taking a few days respite on
the Gold Coast may well be ponder-
ing his next step in a war of words with
a Queensland University academic,
Professor Ken Wiltshire, which has seen
veiled threats to take the rare step of
summoning Wiltshire before the bar of
the parliament.
Government sources say that former
Toowoomba farmer Warner has taken
the unusual step of seeking constitution-
al advice from, among others, Queens-
land Supreme Court Chief Justice Sir
Walter Campbell. The Attorney-Gener-
al’s office also has provided advice.
The clash between Warner and Wilt-
shire, associate professor of Govern-
ment erupted when the academic at-
tacked the Speaker’s parliamentary per-
formance. In interviews with reporters,
Wiltshire said Warner had made errors
which had damaged the independence
of parliament.
Warner has been advised either to
take civil action or to take Wiltshire be-
fore parliament which would be only
the second such event since statehood in
1859. The previous occasion in
August 1956 concerned the chairman
of the Land Commission, Mr V. R.
Creighton, who had accused his minis-
ter of corruption. Notwith-
standing a royal commission-
er’s finding the minister guilty
and forcing his resignation,
the Gair government hauled
Creighton before the as-
sembly in a scene described
by the then opposition leader
and later Country Party prem-
ier Frank Nicklin as “a cal-
lous and indecent farce.”
Asked whether he would
call Wiltshire before the bar,
Warner told The Bulletin he
would “not even comment on
that.” But he added: “It is the
option of the parliament. It’s
my role as Speaker to protect
the interests of the parliament.
“My concern is for the in-
stitution and public confi-
dence in the parliament. I be-
lieve any campaign for reform
must not diminish public con-
fidence. It is his undermining
of public confidence which is
worrying me.”
Wiltshire specifically has attacked
parliamentary procedural changes, in-
troduced a fortnight ago, banning sup-
plementary questions. In practice, the
changes block opposition members
from sustained cross-examination of
ministers during question time.
Warner defended the restriction of
members to two questions, saying Wilt-
shire misunderstood the workings of the
Queensland parliament and sometimes
talked “absolute rot.”
Wiltshire’s latest criticism follows an
exchange of letters last month in which
the Speaker commanded: “I require
that you tender to me forthwith a com-
plete and full apology and retraction.”
Wiltshire replied, offering to give War-
ner lessons in how to run a parliament.
Warner had sent his first letter on
August 13. He quoted a comment at-
Professor Ken Wiltshire: breach of privilege claimed
SHAR ADAMS
tributed to Wiltshire in The Courier-
Mail: “The Speaker, Mr Warner, has
been hopeless. He’s probably one of the
worst in the history of the state. He’s
made a number of errors which have
been tragic for the independence of par-
liament.”
Warner also quoted Wiltshire from a
television interview: .. frankly, the
current Speaker isn’t worth two
bob ...”
Warner advised the academic, who
describes himself as a “parliament en-
thusiast,” that “these statements consti-
tute a clear and grave reflection upon
myself as Speaker of the parliament.
“The allegations contained in the
statements are unfounded, grossly
offensive and a breach of the privilege
of the House.”
Wiltshire’s reply, on August 27,
alluded to his consultancy experience
with the commonwealth parliament and
with overseas legislatures and his aca-
demic works (more than 60). He said:
“Arising out of this research and my
own deeply-held beliefs about parlia-
ment/executive relationships, I believe
there have been long, serious
deficiencies in the Queensland system
including the role of Speaker.”
Wiltshire said that he had been over-
whelmed by public support for his
stand.
He had even received approving
calls and messages from “past and
present members of parliament, inclu-
ding four current parliamentary mem-
bers from your own political party.”
Wiltshire concluded, offering his
phone number. He wrote, “The most
constructive course of action would be
for the two of us to meet and discuss
some points I would like to make about
the conduct of Queensland parliamen-
tary business.”
The Speaker is known to have been
unimpressed with what he saw as an-
other gratuitous insult.
If Warner has his way, the
next time the two will meet
will be over the bronze bar on
the left of his ornate chair.
Wiltshire says he would
welcome the opportunity if
he were allowed to speak. He
has been rehearsing points for
his speech:
“One of the worst, blatant
things I’ve seen is that this
Speaker has thrown members
out incorrectly. I remember
the day I was there ... Tom
Burns had just been thrown
out, absolutely incorrectly,
and he’s the opposition whip.
Now, if you throw out the op-
position’s whip, it’s tanta-
mount to preventing any
healthy debate in the whole of
the parliament.” □

SPORT
England’s summer of shame
West Indian supporters make a succinct point about the series against England
English cricket is shell shocked. There was the five-Test thrashing by the West
Indies followed by a lesson from the Sri Lankans. SCYD BERRY, the cricket
writer for The Observer, looks for the reasons for England’s disastrous decline
AS A consequence of a recent Test
match we know that there is a green and
beautiful island, much troubled at the
moment, whose people are gradually
learning to play cricket and who one
day might even be able to play it quite
well: England. Why, next time they
might even give Sri Lanka a decent
game, instead of the novices dictating
its course throughout.
The inaugural England-Sri Lanka
Test was not, after all, a light at the end
of England’s tunnel. “Malaise” and
“disgrace” echoed around the empty
stands at Lords, and the condemnations
were far stronger than anything during
the series against West Indies. “The
most abject cricket,” thundered The
Times', “an England performance of
surpassing poorness sans life, sans en-
terprise, sans everything.”
If these were reviews of a play, they
would be death notices, but David
Gower’s show is booked to take to the
road again in a couple of months and
must win at New Delhi in November to
avoid the distinction of being the least
successful team in England’s history.
There must indeed be something wrong,
if not rotten, about the state of English
cricket and we don’t have to go outside
the perimeter brick wall of Lord’s to
find out why.
Firstly let us hear the views of the
man of the match about the English
game. Siddath Wettimuny, though he
now holds the record for the longest in-
nings on the ground, has not developed
any superstar complex and talks freely
on the pavilion balcony while the game
is in sepulchral progress down below.
He talks especially, being the son of an
engineer, about technique: and it would
be no exaggeration to say that the au-
thor of some of the most handsome
cover drives seen this summer is aghast
at the technique of English batsmen
(who have produced, if you discount
Allan Lamb, a single Test century all
summer).
Siddath remembers that his father
was a follower of Buddha and C. B. Fry
in about equal measure, and that his old
volume of Fry’s Batsmanship (1912) was
so well thumbed that a typed copy of it
had to be made. Then the father built an
indoor school for his sons, and in-
culculated the old but eternally valid
principles as expounded by Fry.
Wettimuny recalls, in particular, the
chapter on wristwork: “The wrist is a
small member, but it is credited with
great doings,” Fry begins oratorically. A
key sentence, however, reads: “The
most important function of so-called
wrist-work is the acceleration of the bat
as it meets the ball” which, to
Wettimuny, means that a flick of the left
wrist at the moment of impact is the
secret of batsmanship.
But, as Wettimuny has observed
during county games, this is not what
wrist-work now means to the majority
of English batsmen. Instead they use the
right, or bottom, wrist as a way of shov-
elling the ball to leg. Too many, because
of one-day cricket, make the most el-
ementary mistake in batting: they do
not play straight any longer, in the land
which devised batsmanship.
No less surprising to Wettimuny is


A season that the English cricketers and their supporters will find hard to live down
the lack of interest which English crick-
eters seem to have in the entire subject
of technique.
We have only to turn our gaze to the
England players’ balcony to see an illus-
tration of his point. Where are the old
masters, the former internationals?
Have none of them dropped in to say
“well played” or “good luck,” and to
pass on a piece of advice? like “You
have got to pitch it fuller and straighter
at these short Sri Lankan chaps,” which
England’s think tank did not crack until
the third morning.
But the England dressing-room door
is rarely opened nowadays to outsiders.
Inside the belief is that they are playing
a different game (which may be true
against West Indies, but not when Sir
Lanka or India are the opposition) to
that which old timers knew. Therefore,
regrettably, the game’s lore, the ac-
cumulated wisdom of past generations,
is not being passed on.
So there they sit on the balcony,
alone, on the defensive, clinging to their
jobs and places, their sense of isolation
heightened by relatively high Test fees.
Or are the Test fees in fact too low?
John Arlott argued recently that the
root cause of England’s malaise lay in
the higher salaries offered to footballers.
Outside the radio commentary box
Trevor Bailey can help on this one,
having played both games himself. His-
torically, he says, the best time to be a
professional cricketer was the 19305:
£4OO a year with one of the stronger
counties, and £6OO for a major overseas
tour, at a time when a fair-sized house
cost £3OO. Right into the 50s Bailey al-
ways advised a lad to choose cricket as
the more lucrative profession.
Then in the 60s football salaries
soared with the abolition of the maxi-
mum wage, while cricket salaries re-
mained static: £9OO in 1969 for one
Leicestershire player who had just
played for England. Yet from 1968 to
1971, when cricket was worth peanuts,
England enjoyed the longest unbeaten
run in their history: no apparent corre-
lation between money and success.
Nevertheless, there are signs that
cricket is not drawing upon the full re-
sources of Britain’s population, if not
for financial then for social reasons. For
watch the England team as Gower leads
them out: no less than eight of them
went to private school and/or univer-
sity eight out of 10 in effect, since
Lamb was schooled abroad. If that fig-
ure is anything to go by, it suggests the
game in England remains middle class,
not open to all as in the West Indies or
Australia.
Peter May’s era as chairman of selec-
tors has been characterised by a pref-
erence for fellows from this sort of
background, yet there must be more to it
than snobbery. This has surely to be a
reflection of the fact that cricket is
neglected in our state schools and inner
cities, where few artificial or grass
pitches are to be found.
Talking of selectors, one of the four
is over there in the Press Box bar,
mulling over a few names for the winter
tour. Tim Robinson is being mentioned
as a possible reserve opening batsman,
and Martyn Moxon amongst others.
Yes, whatever happened to Moxon? Sir
Len Hutton advocated his selection for
Australia in 1982/3, everyone praises
his talent, and he is already 24 so why
isn’t he playing out there? Well, com-
mittees always tend to go for the safe
conservative choice.
Sri Lanka on the other hand selected
an 18-year-old batsman, de Silva, to
play at Lords in only his seventh first-
class match.
“The basic reason is the lack of lead-
ership, both on and off the field,” says
Wisden's editor. England drifts listlessly
because there is no Brearley, no
mastermind, no “oomph,” no drive, no
hunger for success. And such primitive
urges are likely to remain alien to the
easy-going Gower, however long he is
captain. One answer, therefore, is that
he needs a motivating manager beside
him, as well as Mike Gatting as his vice-
captain for the winter.
Then next summer Gooch and
Emburey will be back, perhaps one or
two other rebels as well, and everything
on the field should be, if not rosy, then
at least brighter by the time the Austra-
lians arrive to defend their Ashes. And
as the Grace Gates close on the last
day’s Test cricket of the season at Lords,
there is the consideration and consola-
tion that England’s embarrassment will
have been worthwhile if it brings a mo-
ment’s harmony to that other green and
troubled island, Sri Lanka. □


THE MEDIA
ABC takes a desperate news gamble
The people on whom the ABC pins National hopes, (left to right) lan Carroll, Geraldine Doogue, Richard Moorecroft and Glyn Patrick
By GLENNYS BELL
ON SUNDAY, September 2, the night
of the Fathers’ Day bikie killings in Syd-
ney, ABC television news made a mess
of its report.
At 7pm, the Sydney newsroom at
Gore Hill opened the news with the
story but failed to show any pictures.
Not until about six minutes later did
viewers see film. Many may have won-
dered whether it was worth it. Appar-
ently, the ABC current affairs team on
Nationwide did not think so. The next
night, Nationwide ran a follow-up story
on the shootings with borrowed
videotape from the news division of
Channel 9.
News and Nationwide are the two
Australian Broadcasting Corporation
departments which will be joined for
better or for worse in the ambitious,
multi-million dollar, one-hour news and
current affairs program the ABC is plan-
ning to launch next year.
The ABC board recently was shown
what was essentially a preliminary pilot
of the proposed program and was so
pleased that it gave the man who
thought it up, lan Carroll, executive
producer of Nationwide, a round of ap-
plause. Carroll has approval to proceed
with planning the program with the
same authority and considerable re-
sources that the ABC devoted to its
coverage of the Commonwealth Games
of 1982. He even has the Games tele-
vision co-ordinator, lan McGarrity, to
assist him.
The program, tentatively named Na-
tional, has been planned as “the most
authoritative, intelligent and informa-
tive news program yet seen on Austra-
lian television.” It will be shown in
prime time, possibly 6.30-7.30 pm, and
feature such stars as Geraldine Doogue,
Maximilian Walsh, Mary Delahunty
and Richard Carleton. It will cover “na-
tional and international news, inter-
view, analysis and current affairs fea-
tures.”
Though described as a national pro-
gram, it will be launched initially only
in New South Wales, Victoria, ACT and
the Northern Territory which comprise
around 70 percent of the viewing popu-
lation. The other states will continue to
produce their own programs. The com-
promise was forced on the ABC board
because of persistent state loyalties and
lobbying within the ABC. As a result,
any economies of scale which would
have resulted from tying the country
together under an Australia-wide net-
work have been lost.
Because Queensland, South Austra-
lia, Western Australia and Tasmania
will continue to produce their own pro-
grams, the cost of the new program
said to be around $23.5 million vastly
underestimates the real cost of tele-
vision news and current affairs to the
ABC. Even the “national program”
costing is probably highly conservative,
if the costs of commercial television
news are a guide. Budgets for the com-
mercial channels, for half an hour, five
days a week, plus weekend news and
back-up bulletins, are estimated at up to
$l5 million.
The ABC may well be able to justify
the cost of the program if it does what it
aims, “to give the ABC a vigorous news
and current affairs program directed at
winning a minimum of 20 percent audi-
ence share within 12 months and for the
ABC to retain the initiative in news and
current affairs coverage.”
What the proposal does not say but
what it does in effect is eliminate the
primacy of the Television News depart-
ment, along with its struggling Gore

Hill newsroom, as one means
of regaining the initiative it
has lost to commercial tele-
vision news.
The failure of the TV News
adequately to cover the
Fathers’ Day killings is just
the latest in a series of disas-
ters which has dogged ABC
News over the past decade, to
the point where it has lost
both credibility and viewers.
The problems of TV News
(acting TV News director
Grahame Irvine refers to the
bikie mess-up as “the hazards
of the business,”) have be-
come commonplace, la-
mented as much inside as out-
side the ABC.
Last February, for
example, one of the ABC’s
television journalists, David
Hastings, acting line-up pro-
ducer in the Melbourne news-
room, sent a biting memo to
the Sydney news department
complaining about the “the
abysmal incompetence” of TV
News at Gore Hill. He said:
“Yesterday, they had all day
to prepare their piece about
the Martin Report. The piece
arrived at four minutes to
seven. It was rudimentary and
incomplete ...
“During the past few
months, Gore Hill has failed
with nearly every big story
that’s come their way.”
The memo listed as failures
the coverage of stories such as
the retirements of Greg Chap-
pell and Dennis Lillee, the
Cross report on lan Sinclair’s
allegations and the Hyatt
Kingsgate Hotel bomb threat
drama. It also named as fias-
cos stories from the previous few years,
among them coverage of the
Woolworths bomber, the Israeli consul-
ate bombing, Blue Mountains bushfires,
riots at Canberra’s Anzac Day march,
the death of Leonid Brezhnev.
One of the reasons Carroll’s propo-
sal was taken up with such alacrity by
the ABC board is that it provides a sol-
ution to the problem of TV News.
But it is still a proposal. Although
Carroll was applauded, the “pilot” of
which the board so approved took three
days to produce. One of the main stu-
dios at Gore Hill was taken over, a mas-
sive set was built and Geraldine Doogue
of Nationwide and Richard Moorecroft,
a newsreader, were the presenters. Two
days were spent in post-production
polishing. The final result was a 45-min-

The tentative target date for National
is next March. By then, Carroll and his
ABC chairman Ken Myer: time is running out
implementation unit McGarrity;
Allan Hogan, formerly Nationwide and
Channel 9’s Sunday; and Glyn Patrick,
a studio director should have put
together their one-hour, five-days-a-
week program.
Whether the concept will work and
become a reality is naturally of concern
to the commercial channels. The news
director at ATN in Sydney, Vincent
Smith, admits his station is wondering
what impact it will have. At TEN, news
director Collin Segelov believes that
whatever happens the ultimate benefici-
ary will be the viewer since the competi-
tion means better and more news. lan
Cook, in charge of Nine Network
News, points out that the commercial
stations are already providing the ma-
jority of viewers with news. He wonders
not only what sector the ABC will serve
but how it will compete.
lan Muir, chief executive of the
McNair Anderson rating sur-
vey firm, queries whether the
ABC can achieve the audience
share of 20 percent it wants
without competing directly
with the commercial channels.
And this, he believes, means
becoming like them and pack-
aging news in an entertaining
way with drama and excite-
ment. As Muir sees it, the line
between news and informa-
tion and entertainment is be-
coming increasingly blurred.
“Will the ABC be comfortable
with this kind of format?” he
asks.
Nor will the commercials
stand still while the ABC at-
tempts to steal rating points
from them. TEN’s Segelov
suggests the ABC could win
its audience by enlarging the
current market. At the mo-
ment, about 80 percent of
households with television
sets are switched on during
prime news time between 6pm
and 7pm.
Muir doubts that the mar-
ket will grow. As he sees it, the
world is divided into those
who watch the ABC and those
who watch the commercials.
The ABC will have to steal
from the commercial audi-
ence.
It will not be an easy task.
As Smith found when ATN
hired former ABC newsreader
Ross Symonds, he was largely
unknown to commercial
viewers and had to be “sold”
to them.
The ABC is challenging the
commercial stations for a
share of the territory it once
regarded as its right but lost.
The ABC chairman, Kenneth Myer, re-
cently announced that the ABC was
seeking to build its audience: “We are
Australia’s nationwide service and we
aim to serve all Australians of all ages.”
One of the ABC’s goals, he added, was
to “seek the most cost-effective use of its
resources so that the Australian public
receives the best possible return on its
investment in national broadcasting.”
That investment is running at more
than $3OO million. Aware of the disen-
chantment of the Labor government,
the growing irrelevance of ABC pro-
grams and the continuing erosion of its
audience, the ABC board and manage-
ment are backing the National program
as a dramatic idea that will work. They
have little choice. As both Myer and
managing director Geoffrey Whitehead
concede, the ABC has to justify its cost
and its existence to the public and it is
running out of time. □

The bow is back
with a vengeance
can deliver the coup de grace
Photographs by JEAN-CLAUDE FRANCOLON/GAMMA
Bowhunting, with its hideous new arrows, is booming in
North America but few countries in Africa permit it.
BRIAN JACKMAN reports on an exception.
BOWHUNTING is a barbaric affair.
The powerful broadhead arrows can in-
flict hideous wounds but seldom kill
outright. Although bowhunting is enjoy-
ing a boom in North America, under
licence, few countries in Africa the
home of big game hunting will allow
such atrocities in the name of sport.
The Central African Republic is a
dramatic exception. There, in the dense
bush beyond the scruffy town of
Ouanda-Djalle, only 80km from the
Sudanese border, French bowhunters
fly in from Paris to shoot buffalo and
other prized trophies.
Hunting animals with bow and ar-
row is forbidden in Europe by the
Federation Internationale de Tir a l’Arc
the world body which governs ama-
teur archery but no such rules extend
to the republic where men such as
Patrick Lallour, president of Gastinne-
Renette, France’s most famous gun-
smiths, can hunt with impunity.
LALLOUR’S buffalo hunt began at
dawn. With him were Georgio Grasselli,
an expatriate professional hunter, two
African trackers and French camera-
man Jean-Claude Francolon. In the dis-
tance was a river, reduced by drought to
a trickle. Beyond it, in the long grass,
three buffalo were grazing.
Grasselli kicked up dust with his foot
to gauge the direction of the wind. Then
they began their approach.
Lallour had put woollen socks over
his boots to muffle the sound of fallen
leaves underfoot. The men crouched
and waded silently into the shallow riv-
er, hugging the bank for cover as
Lallour slid an arrow from his quiver
and set the nock against the bowstring.
His arrows are a far cry from the
medieval clothyard shafts which slew
his countrymen at Crecy and Agincourt.
The modern hunting arrow is a fine-
tuned missile of drawn aluminium,
made in America. The tubular shaft is
fletched not with the medieval archer’s
grey goose feathers but with flexible
waterproof nylon vanes and armed with
a multi-bladed broadhead of shatter-
Patrick Lallour takes aim on the hunt
proof stainless steel designed to slice
through major arteries. Released at an
explosive speed of 58 metres a second,
its razor-sharp cutting edges will shear
through the toughest hide like butter.
Some multi-blade broadheads are made
to punch a 10cm square hole in their
target so that the hunter will have a bet-
ter blood trail to follow.
His bow, too, bears little resem-
blance to the kind of weapon that Robin
Hood might have carried. Gone is the
traditional longbow of solid yew or
hickory. In its place aerospace technol-
ogy has spawned the synthetic com-
pound cam bow, a sinister-looking con-
traption bristling with pulleys, cable-
guards, sophisticated sights with cal-
ibrated tracks and stabilisers which
steady the bow.
The compound bow scorns old-
fashioned wood. Instead, its handle is

The bow appeals to “passionate hunters,” says Lallour


made of diecast magnesium alloy and
its polished limbs of laminated graphite
and epoxy resins are fitted with cables
and aluminium cams which take the
strain until the bow is fully drawn. Only
then, at the point of release, does the
bowman hold the full draw-weight of
25kg or more by muscle power alone.
(Ironically, this type of bow was de-
signed for elderly or disabled archers
who could no longer draw a strongbow
unaided.)
As the men crept forward, the sound
of rough tongues scything the grass car-
ried clearly from the bank above where
the buffalo were feeding only 20m away.
Grasselli slipped a cartridge into his
hunting rifle to provide covering fire if
anything went wrong.
Lallour raised his bow. The arrow
sang and the buffalo flinched as it
thudded home behind its shoulder.
Then the animal slowly collapsed, spit-
ting streams of blood. Lallour fired a
second arrow into its belly as its two
companions turned and crashed away
into the bush.
The animal flailed its legs and
Grasselli stepped forward to give the
coup de grace. Two shots in the spine
and it was finished.
An autopsy proved what was already
known: that to kill cleanly is almost im-
possible with a beast weighing three-
quarters of a tonne. The first arrow had
broken a rib, sliced through lung and
lodged itself in the spleen. The second
had pierced the liver but it took two
bullets to kill the buffalo. That is why
the Africans have always used poisoned
arrows. Even the Wata, the legendary
elephant-hunters of southern Kenya
who could draw bows other men could
scarcely bend, would not have been able
to hunt so efficiently without their dead-
ly toxins.
Arrow power alone is not enough to
stop dangerous game.
During the rest of the safari, Lallour
managed to bring down a second
buffalo. He also killed two antelopes
and a couple of guinea fowl. For the
guinea fowl, he abandoned his hollow
tubes of light alloy for wooden arrows
without sharp pointed tips; the impact
of the arrow alone is enough to pierce
small game.
Why hunt with a bow when you can
kill more efficiently with a gun?
“Because it is very difficult,” says
Lallour. “Because the rate of success is
low and the waiting and stalking is con-
siderable. It is real hunting, simple and
so charged with emotion that it appeals
to all truly passionate hunters.”
THE HOME of bowhunting is North
America. There, you can walk into any
big department store and buy a com-
plete bowhunting set for around $lOO.
With something like two million

bowhunters taking to the woods each
year, it is big business.
Devotees of the sport have their cult
magazines, stuffed with advertisements
for bows and arrows, leather guards that
protect the forearm against bowstring
burns, second-hand Vietnam jackets
and bottles of “doe-in-rut” deer urine to
lure bucks within shooting distance.
Elk, whitetail and mule deer are the
favorite trophies but just about every-
thing that moves is considered fair game
from black bear to ground squirrels.
Some American bowhunters even go to
sea to hunt sharks.
In Britain, where bowhunting is il-
legal, the closest equivalent if you dis-
count the lunatic fringe who go deer-
poaching with crossbows is field arch-
ery, in which simulated hunts in rough
country are organised using cut-out ani-
mal figures as targets.
The Grand National Archery So-
ciety, the governing body of the sport in
Britain, presides over 850 clubs most
of whose 16,000 members practise the
traditional sport of target archery. As a
result there is little demand for hunting
bows, although some archery specialist
shops such as Quicks of Portsmouth im-
port a range of compound bows from
the United States which sell for between
$175 and $450.
But how cruel is big game hunting
with bow and arrow? Perhaps the last
word should go to David Jones, senior
veterinary officer at the London Zoo
and a man with extensive experience of
humane culling.
“Against an animal the size of a
buffalo, it is simply unacceptable,” he
says. “They are hard enough to knock
down with a heavy hunting rifle. The
normally accepted method of killing big
game is to get as close as possible and
do it first time: a quick, clean kill. A
heart, neck or brain shot is virtually im-
possible with a bow and the wounds are
bound to be a lot nastier than a clean
bullet hole.
“That is why no hunter worth his salt
would even think of it.” □

The Divine Miss C
invades the Midler ground
Linda Cable aims to go on breaking new ground in Australian jazz something
she has been doing since her career as a singer began unexpectedly. SHELLEY
NELLER reports on Cable and her music.
AFICIONADOS have tagged her the
Bette Midler of Australian jazz a
mixed musical metaphor which accu-
rately intimates Linda Cable’s vocal
range and stamina, if not her personal
performing style.
The petite, elfin-faced singer is 30
and has toured with the Daly Wilson
Big Band and sung with Australia’s top
jazz musicians in our premier haunts.
With one of Australia’s top drum-
mers, David Jones, she recently devised
an experimental (do not read “avant
garde”) act which marries their melodic
and structured music with theatrical
effects and movement (do not read
“dance”).
The purists may be horrified when
the pair perform this new act at the
Prince of Wales Hotel in Melbourne’s St
Kilda this month. But, as Linda says
emphatically: “I’m definitely not a pu-
rist. I’ve always wanted to break out of
tradition and break new ground in
jazz.” Her ability to break new ground
professionally was first put to the test
more than a decade ago long before
she became interested in jazz and just
before she discovered that she could
sing at all.
She was a satisfied bass player with
15 years’ experience and no singing as-
pirations when the singer in her band
suddenly left without notice. Linda was
asked to stand in.
“I was horrified,” she recalls. “I’d
never sung anywhere. The advice they
gave me was: ‘Open your mouth and go
for it!’ Looking back, I know I sounded
terrible. I used to sing in a raunchy way,
guttural and loud enough to be heard
above the noise of the band.”
The band, Rotary Connexion, was
sufficiently impressed with her perform-
ance to ask her to tour with them in
Europe for a year. Playing in ritzy Ital-
ian clubs with the Lambhorginis lined
up outside, Linda was impressed and
inspired by Europe.
But when she returned to Australia
she determined to concentrate seriously
on her singing and immediately started
voice training.
Linda Cable: “I like to ham it up, too. I can’t deny it”
After three years of consistent study,
she had increased her range from one to
two and a half octaves. Which makes
her a firm believer in the adage that stars
can be made as well as born.
“Range is obtainable if you put the
work into it,” she says.
“And training is essential if you want
to have command of the instrument.”
To this end, she jogs and exercises at
home daily “to maintain my stamina,
range and lung capacity.”
With her new singing range came a
desire to sing jazz not traditional or
dixie, but a more creative, structured
and melodic kind which would give her
the scope to “use all the emotions you
can think of on stage.”
The notion that she is taking a tem-
porary break from bass-playing to ex-
plore singing has been totally dropped.
“I’ll never go back to bass again. I’m
too into my singing now that I have the
scope to sing the jazz I really love.”
Recently she appeared with a group
of top jazz musos at The Basement, Syd-
ney’s jazz mecca. And in October she
will sing with Don Burrows at his sup-
per club now at Sydney’s ritzy Regent
hotel.
She does regular television work: the
Bert Newton, Daryl Somers, and Mike
Walsh Shows feature her regularly. Un-
likely venues, it must be admitted, for
Linda’s kind of music. But they do give
performers a more public profile.


“Sometimes you have to compro-
mise,” she admits. But, lately, even these
commercially oriented shows have
softened their demands for her to sing
contemporary rocky numbers.
Like Bette Midler, Linda has worked
in various areas (no, not the downtown
Turkish baths) to supplement her jazz-
singing income. She does session work
to afford her the luxury of singing as
much jazz as she wants.
Behind her amiable, low-key manner
lurks a firm belief in her professional
stature and future. She and Jones are
putting their money where her mouth is
and backing the new Prince of Wales
Show.
How will Melbourne fans react to it?
“I’m not sure,” she replies. “Mel-
bourne audiences are less accepting of
innovation in jazz than Sydney fans.”
Elaborating on the style of the show,
she says: “The props we’ll use will be
simple and effective. The lighting will be
designed to catch the eye. The costumes
and masks are eastern in keeping with
the segment called ‘Eastology.’
“David and I have written some mu-
sic to this theme. We always knew we’d
do something theatrical together. Our
music evokes visual images and this
show is a natural progression in that di-
rection.
“The audience will see something
more diverting than a group of musos
just standing in the background.”
Recently Linda has written some
songs of her own, a process she finds
“tremendously artistic and creative.” A
few of these will be included in the new
show.
Although she is dedicated to jazz, she
rejects the “narcissistic, introverted
style” which some singers adopt. Like
Bette Midler, she prefers to give gener-
ously to her audience.
“We play around with the music.
You can get a lot of lighthearted humor
out of it.”
Smirking at the ongoing compari-
sons between herself and the Divine
Miss M, Linda admits semi-coyly: “I
like to ham it up, too. I can’t deny it.
Unlike most singers who just sing, I’m
trying to tone down into not over-per-
forming.”
Unlike Miss Midler, Linda has an
additional consideration in the pattern
of her artistic career a husband who is
a saxophone player.
“We haven’t had dinner together for
four weeks,” she says with a sigh.
“He’s a studio musician and our ca-
reers are going in different directions
right now. It’s hard to co-ordinate our
time.”
His name is Bill Harrower.
“And that,” quips the Divine Miss
C, with perfectly underplayed wit, “is
why I kept my maiden name for
showbusiness.” □

ART
War paintings
with no need
for bodies
Arthur Streeton, watercolor with pencil: 60-pounder gun off Albert Road, 1918
By GLENDA THOMPSON
WATERCOLORS painted by Sir
Arthur Streeton in France in 1918 have
returned there for an exhibition starting
this week at the Australian embassy.
Streeton (1867-1943) is one of Aus-
tralia’s best landscapists. He was com-
missioned as a war artist and spent three
months in the Somme, until his paints
and paper ran out, then another month
at Peronne. He worked under shellfire
at times.
This work has “considerable power,
freshness and spontaneity” in the view
of Anne Gray, the curator of pre-1939
art at the Australian War Memorial
which is exhibiting the collection.
“They include some of the largest
Australian watercolors I’ve seen,” says
Gray. “They have made a lot of people
reconsider Streeton. They show a com-
pletely different side of
him, as a very capable
watercolorist. Most of his
paintings people have seen
are his oils and some of the
best known and loved are
the little nine by five cigar
box panels.”
Before being sent to
France, Streeton spent two
years at a London hospital
doing what he called “the
hardest and best work of
my life dressing the
wounds of the veterans
from Mons and the
Marne.” So he was pre-
pared for the destruction in France yet
was still struck by the “desolation and
horrible litter of war.”
“Guns feature heavily in his work,”
says Gray, which is interesting as ma-
chinery just wasn’t a subject for paint-
ing in 1918. Rather than creating just
illustrations, Streeton manages to cap-
ture the menacing power of the guns. In
60-pounder gun off Albert Road one
looks right down the barrel. It is almost
too close for comfort. The daringness of
his compositions contrasts with the
wonderful colors he is using. The im-
ages appear almost sweet because of the
colors.
“The impression, confirmed in
Streeton’s writing later on, is that the
Arthur Streeton
war has destroyed the
man-made world of guns
and houses but nature is a
far more powerful force
that will regenerate.”
In letters to fellow artist
Tom Roberts, Streeton was
full of admiration for his
countrymen.
“It is wonderful what
the Australian batman can
do,” he wrote. “They fos-
sick around, and soon you
have an old stove put in,
pipes roughly joined to it,
and a fire burning in no
time. They are resourceful
to a degree wonderful men.”
And more seriously: “Australians I
thought I understood at the 3rd London
(hospital) but it’s necessary to see and
know them here to properly appreciate
the manhood of Australia. Absolutely.
The fights against fire and flood and
thirst in the Bush all tell in the field here,
and bring out the finest in them.”
Yet few human figures people his
work; or if they do, they are tiny as in St
Gratien: General Birdwood bidding fare-
well to headquarters staff. “Everyone
says why aren’t there any people in his
paintings,” says Gray. “My answer is
because they’re all dead or gone away.
He makes his statements in a very
understated way. You could say he’s


St Gratien: General Birdwood bidding farewell to headquarters staff, 1918: few human figures in his work
just painting pretty pictures in France
he should be noticing more of what the
war’s about. In fact these images are al-
most more powerful than dead bodies.”
Streeton was over 50 and worried
about surviving a winter in France. Yet
he wrote cheerfully to his wife: “All I
need is one good long sleep. I’ve slept in
my boots for the last two nights. But
that’s nothing to Michelangelo who
once slept in his boots for two months,
so keen was he on his job.”
The son of a schoolmaster, Streeton
was born at Mount Duneed, Victoria.
He was apprenticed to a lithographer
when, at 19, he met and painted with
Roberts and Frederick McCubbin. His
painting blossomed and he made it his
career. He was knighted for services to
art in 1937.
Streeton loved strong light for his
work and once wrote: “If I have any
deity it is the sun.” That shows in this
collection.
After Paris the collection travels to
Amiens (November 9 to December 9),
Comptegne (January 8 to February 28),
Ypres (March 29 to April 30) and to
London (June 1 to July 31). It was last
shown in Europe in 1919. □

FILMS
Tackling a
taboo, bravely
but grimly
John Hargreaves restrained during a confrontation in My First Wife: no jokes
By SANDRA HALL
AMONG Australian film-makers, mar-
riage and divorce have never been
popular subjects for treatment.
The preferred themes have been
childhood, adolescence, mateship and
the Australian’s relationship with his
land and his car.
When it has occurred, love between
men and women has been treated fairly
perfunctorily as part of the scenery
tentatively, as something which
flourishes only in unusual circum-
stances, or as a game as lively as war or
Australian football but slightly less in-
teresting.
Middle-class marriage and divorce,
in particular, have been taboo as if
just the idea of educated people display-
ing emotion or, far worse, talking about
it is enough to clear the house. Sixteen
years have passed since Tim Burstall’s
2000 Weeks, which gave expatriatism
and adulterous love equal time, but the
failure of that film still seems to be one
of the most potent cautionary tales in
the business.
Even so, Melbourne directors con-
tinue to be braver than anybody else
when it comes to introspection and Paul
Cox has finally taken on Australian cin-
ema’s most neglected theme in an in-
tensely morose but perversely fascin-
ating film called bluntly My First Wife.
It is a film in which people sit around
gloomily in richly furnished houses
(whose decorators disapprove thor-
oughly of overhead lighting) or tramp
about outside under flannel skies just
one step ahead of the next rainstorm.
John, the tormented hero, is a composer
with Russian parents and the crisis
comes when he discovers that his lacon-
ic Australian wife has been having an
affair with somebody cheerier and more
phlegmatic. The mood, then, is con-
fessional the implication being that
Australians are too damned stoical for
their own good. In explaining the film
in interviews, Cox has invoked W. H.
Auden’s line: “We must love one an-
other or die.”
So John Hargreaves’ very Australian
features have been obscured by a beard
and his tendency to make engaging
jokes out of the most unpromising lines
has been banned. Although some
humor along with a little more light
would have done wonders, there are no
jokes here.
Helen, John’s wife (Wendy Hughes),
intensifies his torment by choosing as
her lover one of his friends. Even worse,
the man is a member of the choir per-
forming John’s newest composition;
love, sex and work are bound up
together in his feelings of betrayal.
He is disbelieving at first, then angry,
then grief-stricken he tries suicide, he
kidnaps his small daughter (Lucy
Angwin) for a night and is finally con-
vinced, to his despair, that Helen is so
thoroughly out of love with him that she
finds sex with him not only boring but
also repellent.
Cox tries to be even-handed about
all this, building with hints about the
difficulties that come with John’s artistic
temperament something of a case for
Helen’s indifference. But Cox’s heart is
not in it.
This is John’s story and Cox tells it
with such intensity and with such atten-
tion to the fine detail of each stage of
suffering that, if the character were a
woman, chauvinists would call the film
a “weepie.”
But Cox has not merely reversed the
stereotypes: He has done something
trickier with them. The contrast is
not between so-called masculine
undemonstrativeness and feminine
emotionalism but between European
sensitivity and what Cox sees as that
Australian reluctance to make a fuss
about anything that does not involve
money.
At his father’s funeral, John’s
Russian family sobs uninhibitedly over
the grave while his Australian mother-
in-law primly excuses her husband’s ab-
sence at a board meeting.
John stands at a bar, all his artistic
sensibilities offended by the sight of
Australian drunks blotting out their
hopelessness with beer and rock ’n’ roll.

Helen show anything more profound
than sullen exasperation.
All this point-scoring adds up to a
kind of censoriousness which dim-
inishes the film’s considerable power,
much of it derived from Hargreaves’
portrait of a man whose coating of intel-
lectual arrogance cannot protect him
when he finds himself going suddenly
out of control.
THE OTHER Australian film of the
week, Richard Lowenstein’s Strike-
bound, is no less powerful but much
more exuberant a beautifully crafted
piece of left-wing history as touching as
it is entertaining.
This is the first feature by Low-
enstein, 24-year-old son of oral histor-
ian Wendy Lowenstein, yet it is tremen-
dously assured.
Strikebound owes much of its tech-
nique to the British social realists Ken
Loach and Peter Watkins (something
Lowenstein freely acknowledges) but
Lowenstein is so at ease with his ma-
terial that he puts his own stamp on it.
His story is about a strike on the
South Gippsland coalfields in Victoria
in the 30s and has been drawn from the
memories of Wattie Doig and his wife,
Agnes, Scottish immigrants who helped
organise the miners’ campaign for a
minimum wage and safer conditions.
Wattie was a miner, Agnes a member of
the Salvation Army and her radicalisa-
tion during the strike is a well-handled
sub-plot. These two, now in their 80s,
appear in a prologue to the film and at
the end. During the action, they are
played by Chris Haywood and Carol
Burns.
Lowenstein chose to work where it
all happened, going so far as to re-open
a coal mine near Wonthaggi. (Hence the
film’s Australian premiere in the town
last week.) There he and crew re-created
the appalling atmosphere in which the
men worked and the strike’s climax
when, in a highly successful attempt to
attract attention to their cause, 25 of
them broke into the mine and
barricaded themselves underground to
fight off police and management.
Lowenstein and his cinematogra-
pher, Andrew de Groot, have given the
film a look unlike any other period film
shot in Australia. Instead of the usual
bright and clear Australian light, de
Groot uses a muted tone with a blue cast
to it. This, together with the Scottish ac-
cents and the Welsh folksongs which
punctuate the action, is a persistent re-
minder that Strikebound is very much a
story of immigrant Australians.
The visual style also underlines Low-
enstein’s commitment to realism. He is
telling a fierce story and, while he never
leaves you in doubt that he is on the
unionists’ side, he presents them pretty
much as they must have been hard-
nosed, hot-tempered and brutal in their
treatment of scabs. Yet he displays a
casually graceful sense of humor along
with his strong feel for characterisation.
Haywood (who can overplay the lar-
rikin) is fine as Wattie, the kind of man
whose reckless style is complemented
by a pragmatic instinct as to how far is
too far. And Carol Burns is a nice blend
of softness and steel as Agnes.
If there is any flaw in the mix of
documentary and narrative styles, it’s in
the ending which is allowed to tail away
to anti-climax. But Strikebound is still
one of the most intelligent Australian
films to come along in some time. Low-
enstein is a talent to watch. □

THEATRE
Nimrod: new
house but
no warming
John Bell as Lear: the audience is spared nothing
BRANCO GAICA
By BRIAN HOAD
READERS IN Kununurra may not yet
have heard the news but, after a month
and more of previews and on a tidal
wave of pre-publicity, Sydney’s Nimrod
Theatre Company has finally taken up
official residency in its third and largest
home the Seymour Centre with a
grim production of that grimmest play,
Shakespeare’s King Lear.
Opening night was a vice-regal occa-
sion but, lest lesser mortals present
should have feared that the company
had gone so far up-market as to put
away childish things altogether and
turned its back on its larrikin past, there
was a rock band and an early music
ensemble and clowns and things in at-
tendance to give assurances otherwise.
Anyway, before King Lear which so
ruthlessly exposes the vileness in the
hearts of all humanity (particularly poli-
ticians) there are no high and mighty.
All are lesser mortals.
This great granite mountain of a
tragedy presents one of the most de-
manding and difficult challenges in all
theatre, so much so that many have ar-
gued that it is unproducable. For the
sake of performers and audiences alike,
it is best to recall Hazlitt: “All that we
can say must fall far short of the subject
or even what we ourselves conceive of
it.”
The challenge is seldom taken up.
There was at this same theatre in 1978 a
heavily-cut version by the Queensland
Theatre Company, designed for audi-
ences of the electronic age with short
attention spans. It was memorable only
for its display of the late-flowering tal-
ents of Warren Mitchell in the title role,
presenting a querulous and bigoted old
king who through purgation by the evil
in humanity which he himself unleashed
finally found redemption in a new-
found simplicity costing not less than
everything.
But in Aubrey Mellor’s production
for Nimrod the audience is spared
nothing. Here is four hours of almost
unrelieved misery with but one interval.
John Bell’s Lear withholds even the
comfort of pathos. There is no final re-
demption, only a defeated whimper
from a foolish old man.
In 1972, England’s Prospect Theatre
Company also offered this play. It was
one of those stark, brightly-lit, timeless
productions which in avoiding any par-
ticular interpretation allowed the com-
plex text to speak for itself to cathartic
effect. The result was too raw for many.
Timothy West’s Lear was just an ordi-
nary man who died in bewildered, lone-
ly despair. And yet, when all was said
and done, when this terrible theatrical
storm was over, the world did seem a
little cleaner. There is no sense of cath-
arsis in Nimrod’s version.
Mellor has chosen a modern setting
perhaps yesterday, more probably to-
morrow. At least, the world is in ruins;
it’s a concept that narrows the play and
emphasises its pessimism.
Set in some distant past, or even out
of time, there is always the implicit but
assuring fact that humankind somehow
goes on managing to survive its wicked
ways. Set in tomorrow, there is no such
assurance there is no hope.
This sense of hopelessness pervades
Bell’s Lear. He is old, he is self-centred,
he is demanding, he is crochety but all
in an absent-minded sort of way. Driv-
en into the wilderness by his scheming
daughters, there is bewilderment but
little agony. As the storm breaks in his
mind, he is reduced to whimsy rather
than to madness. His heart cannot break
over the death of Cordelia for it has al-
ready withered away. He does not die so
much as just crumple up. Nothing, ab-
solutely nothing is left. Even the final
words of hope for a world restored by
feeling ring hollow in the mouth of the
lugubrious and doleful Edgar of Robert
Menzies.
Evil dominates, led by a powerful
Edmund (Colin Friels). Kris
McQuade’s Regan is colder than Gillian
Jones’ Goneril but both are vicious ani-
mals. Regan’s husband Cornwall (Peter
Kowitz) and Goneril’s steward (Michael
Gow) make the skin crawl.
Ranged against this mob, John How-
ard’s bluff, honest, plain-spoken Kent
seems hopelessly simple-minded to the
point of stupidity. The tough, deter-
mined honesty of Judy Davis’ Cordelia
is flawed with pride. Only in Lear’s Fool
(Davis again, in larrikin mood) does
honesty merge with truth and wisdom to
become at all effectual. There is a little
warmth there, too, as there is in John
Ewing’s moving Gloucester until this
bleak, cold world destroys them both.
Mellor and his cast of 14 are never
less than competent, often potent. Such
is the elusiveness of meaning in this rich
and complex play that their interpreta-
tion, in all its ruthless consistency, is be-
yond criticism. Yet the result is so pro-
foundly depressing that many may find
it pointless. □

OPERA
AO comes
back to
this century
By BRIAN HOAD
THE Australian Opera gets peeved with
people who dismiss it as a museum, a
repository of frilly 19th-century fan-
tasies signifying nothing. The company
points out that no fewer than 30 of the
94 operas it has presented since 1970
have been from the 20th century. But
this evades the point. The company’s
latest 20th-century offering, this year,
was Cilea’s Adriana Lecouvreur a
frilly 19th-century fantasy signifying
nothing even if it was first staged in
1902. And now there is Poulenc’s The
Dialogues of the Carmelites, from 1957.
The point is that all opera should
mean something to its audiences no
matter when it was composed. An 18th-
century opera can mean a great deal de-
pending on how it is produced. The de-
mand is simply that opera should be
good theatre, which is why directors
have come to dominate the operatic
stage over the past 30 years or so.
If it is good theatre, audiences will
usually accept it. In competition with
Mozart, Rossini and Puccini, the oper-
atic box-office success in Melbourne in
1953 was Menotti’s The Consul of 1950.
Menotti does not write particularly
good music but this bureaucratic night-
mare (ending in suicide) makes for very
good theatre which meant a great deal
to a great many people.
In more recent years the AO has won
considerable popularity for works by
Britten and Janacek. On the other hand,
its superb production of Berg’s in-
novative masterpiece of 1925, Wozzeck,
bombed badly in 1976. Local public
taste was not then prepared to accept
Berg’s atonalities.
There are no such musical problems
with Poulenc’s Carmelites. The score is
dedicated for obvious reasons to
Monteverdi, Verdi, Debussy and
Moussorgsky. He might just as well
have added Wagner and Massenet and
Stravinsky. The score is almost bewil-
deringly eclectic and rather light-
weight. But it is only a part of a fine
theatrical whole. Theatrically, Poulenc
saw the future of opera in vaguely cine-
matic terms lots of short fragmentary
scenes. Luckily, for The Carmelites he
was handed a film script some 16
scenes in all.
The Carmelites had its origins in a
footnote to the French Revolution when
16 Carmelite nuns were sent (singing) to
the guillotine. The footnote inspired a
novel by Gertrud von Le Fort, The Last
to the Scaffold, in 1931. It is about fear
of life in threatening times and fear of
death at all times and the spiritual con-
quest of such fears. It was an allegory of
life in Germany at that time.
In France in 1947, with the fearful
memories of the French resistance still
fresh, the novel was turned into a film
script. The devout Catholic writer
Georges Bernanos elaborated on the
spiritual significance of the story. The
film was delayed, Bernanos died but his
script was staged as a play in 1951. It
Isobel Buchanan as Sister Blanche in The Carmelites
BRANCO GAICA
was this play which Poulenc set to
music.
The work’s central character is
Blanche de La Force. Terrified by life,
she retreats to a Carmelite convent.
There she is faced with the even more
terrifying prospect of martyrdom. There
she is known as Sister Blanche of the
Agony of Christ. It is the nature and the
meaning of that agony at Gethsemane
which pervades the opera.
The spiritual drama is brought alive
by the domestic drama of prayer and
work in an enclosed society all too hu-
man in its petty jealousies and annoy-
ances, its flashes of pride and obstinacy.
And then there is the drama of the out-
side world which invades the convent
and finally executes the nuns.
The opera is very much alive with
vividly realised characters. There is the
granity old prioress, Madame de
Croissy, stoically approaching death
(from natural causes) yet finally crum-
bling on her deathbed into a state of
utter aloneness, abandoned by God,
overwhelmed by the agony of Geth-
semane a shattering performance by
Lone Koppel.
Her successor as prioress, Madame
Lidoine, is a much warmer soul
patient, humble, rather homely, yet firm.
The quiet courage and natural nobility
with which she finally leads her flock to
the scaffold provides the heartfelt cli-
max to this extraordinary work, in a
rare vintage performance by Joan Suth-
erland who first (and last) tackled the
role at Covent Garden in
1958.
There is more strong
characterisation in Heather
Begg’s sub-prioress, Mother
Marie, a rather severely
aristocratic figure flawed by
pride and arrogance. For yet
more contrast there is Anne-
Maree McDonald’s Sister
Constance, a delightful por-
trait of high-spirited, good-
humored innocence.
Yet the most difficult, the
most complex role is that of
Sister Blanche. Isobel
Buchanan is completely con-
vincing. She does not hesitate
to show all the human imper-
fections of this neurotic little
mouse grumpy, timid,
proud, vain. Her inner path to
the scaffold and salvation is
indeed seen to be hard and
difficult.
John Bury’s sparse sets
make bold gestures toward re-
alism but are primarily geared
to shifting the action along
from scene to scene as quickly
and smoothly as possible,
helping director Elijah
Moshinsky to maintain a
strong and steady pace in an austere
production of great sense and sensibil-
ity.
In the event, Richard Bonynge and
the band demonstrate that Poulenc’s
odd orchestral score is usually support-
ive, seldom intrusive and sometimes
inspired while the distinctively individ-
ual vocal lines are both beautiful and
psychologically apt.
The English translation is not always
comprehensible but that detracts little
from the sum of the many parts which
makes powerful theatre. With com-
mendable taste and foresight the ABC
declined the AO’s offers of such oper-
atic pops as Aida and The Tales of
Hoffmann and has chosen instead to
telecast The Dialogues of the Carmelites
on September 15.

BOOKS
A benchmark
in local
letters
By EDMUND CAMPION
Serpent’s Tooth , by Roger Milliss.
Penguin, $9.95
YOU KNOW you’re getting old when'
your contemporaries start publishing
their memoirs.
I remember Roger Milliss coming up
to Sydney University in 1952. By that
time, most of the ex-servicemen had
graduated and student politics had been
given back to youngsters. It was the
time of the Cold War in Europe, in Asia
the Korean conflict and the Malaysian
emergency, and in Australia Menzies,
national service and the educational
boom year.
Already a committed leftist, Roger
Milliss hopped straight into the action.
He was a genial, if passionate, arguer
who had a gift for steering discussion
into his own territory. But the left never
had the numbers to gain student power.
Instead, they became dissidents who
kept up a running critique of the way
things were run by others.
Despite that, those were good years
for Milliss. Alongside his arguing, he
was reading widely his Anthropology
lecturer give him what was virtually a
free pass in an examination because of
the width of his reading. And in the
Communist Party, which he soon
joined, for the first time he found true
friends.
Discreetly, he gives only their first
names. But there will be plenty of
readers in or nearing their 50s who will
know well those first comrades of his:
Frank, the swimming champ who car-
ried on the class war against the daugh-
ters of the North Shore; Greg, who left
the party to join the Church and marry
a Catholic girl; Jimmy, who became a
judge; the poets, John and Julian; the
scientists, Simon and John; and another
Roger, sent up from Melbourne to whip
the Sydney communists into shape ...
Well, nostalgia is the stuff of any
good autobiography. What makes Ser-
pent’s Tooth special is its ability to go
beneath that surface level of easy remi-
niscence. This long (200,000 words),
dense (each chapter is one huge para-
graph) book is a passionate coming to
terms with the single major influence in
his life, a salute beyond the grave to the
man who made him, his
father.
Bruce Milliss was a
Katoomba draper who had
left Catholicism for commu-
nism in the 30s. He was a
prominent activist in Blue
Mountains affairs and in com-
munist circles something of a
theoretician. His real value to
the party, however, was his
business expertise. In the
early 50s, despite official poli-
cies, he found ways of open-
ing Australia to trade with the
Soviet Union and China. Not
only did the socialist home-
lands profit by this, local
party coffers swelled too.
He could have made a for-
tune but he didn’t because he
lived for the cause, not
money. The dedication of
Bruce Milliss was religious in
its purity, a rebuke to modern
consumerism. Above all else, that is
what he passed on to his son.
Not that they agreed about every-
thing. As the split widened between
China and the Soviet Union, father and
son took opposite sides. By then, Roger
was in Moscow in the press there and he
carried on the arguments with his father
through the mail. On his return, the ar-
guments erupted into blazing confron-
tations. Running through the book is a
lasting regret at the venom of those fam-
ily rows.
And yet, as they came to realise at
the end, father and son were on the
same side. His years in Moscow had
shown Roger Milliss the inhuman face
of communism he knew people who
had endured years in Stalin’s camps. In
a remarkably honest autobiography
nothing is more honest than the way he
depicts his hesitations as he works
towards a belief in pluralism, albeit so-
cialist pluralism. Yet his faith in com-
munism is never in doubt. At Lance
Sharkey’s funeral he knows that he is
marching with history.
On a par with this political honesty is
the way he explores changes in his own
personality. His father’s tutelage had
made him a stitched-up ideologue, un-
able to enjoy, to relax, to let go. Women
shied away from this dogmatic iceman.
Brief encounters led nowhere.
Then he fell in love with a commu-
nist girl in Melbourne and pursued her
relentlessly. She seemed to offer him the
chance to liberate his sunken self. Re-
pelled by his impatience, she was also
attracted to his dedication. At last he
wore her down and they were married
in Moscow by a puzzled Australian am-
bassador. The marriage lasted only four
years but it softened him and made him
more human.
As with his writing about his father,
Roger Milliss in 1968: now come the memories
the account of his marriage is highly
emotional but never mawkish. The long
streaming Australian-idiom sentences
are an interior dialogue Milliss con-
ducts with himself.
At times, the honesty is overpower-
ing and he seems too ready to confess
his own faults, too angry with himself.
At times, too, the prose falters and runs
dead. Make no mistake about it, how-
ever, all in all this is a distinguished
Australian autobiography, one that is a
privilege as well as a delight to read. For
years to come Serpent’s Tooth will be a
benchmark of local letters.

That was William Wordsworth’s

of Australian poets lapsing into despon-

liberately cast off the world. For in-

dead now either by their own choice or
from such poet-related causes as cir-
rhosis of the liver or heart disease. Their
work, fortunately, lives on in edition
after edition. A generation and a half of
post-graduates has gained its PhDs
from study of their poetry.
But, then, they themselves lived off
the poets before them teaching litera-
ture for meagre salaries and uncertain
tenure in colleges all over America,
picking up European travel and re-
search grants here and there, accepting
advances for definitive studies of the life
and times of Hart Crane or Walt
Whitman and not delivering, taking
three-month teaching jobs at Harvard
or Princeton in preference to assistant
professorships in Florida or Nebraska,
joining the writing school at Yaddo,
standing in for the editor of a sponsored
art magazine.
Most had wives who worked.
Simpson was the working wife of
John Berryman. They married in the
early 40s and parted in the early 50s. In
the 10 years they were together, Sim-
pson knew the closed, neurotic, am-
bitious group of United States East
Coast poets of whom Berryman was
one.
Among the poets were Randall
Jarrell ( Pictures From An Institution ),
Delmore Schwartz ( Summer Knowl-
edge), Theodore Roethke ( The Waking),
Robert Lowell ( Lord Weary’s Castle),
R. P. (Richard) Blackmur ( Jordan’s De-
light). Berryman, Jarrell and Lowell
(most of all) have become American
modern classics. Blackmur has been
virtually relegated. Schwartz’s body of
poetry is smaller than that of his friends
and his novels received more notice. He
died in 1967, aged 52.
Simpson writes: “Delmore, a recluse,
who had once been ‘flagrant with young
male beauty’ and so gifted it was
thought he would be the star of his gen-
eration had fallen dead in the hallway
outside his squalid room in a fleabag
hotel at Times Square.” As Saul Bellow
(friend of these poets) wrote of his
character Humboldt in Humboldt’s Gift,
“he lay unclaimed for two days in the
morgue because there were no readers
of modern poetry around to recognise
him.”
Roethke died in 1963. He had spent
periods of his 55 years in mental institu-
tions. Jarrell threw himself under a
truck at the age of 51. Berryman, after
many suicide threats, finally pulled it
off; he jumped from a bridge on to the
frozen Mississippi River. Lowell (who,
like Roethke, had seasons of madness)
died of a heart attack in a taxi on his
way from the airport into New York
City. Lowell, Berryman, Jarrell and
Roethke all won Pulitzer Prizes for
poetry.
These Americans poets are not as

quite a name for ourselves.
Padthaway
In 1969,Lindemans
discovered a potential new
wine growing district near
the small rural town of
Padthaway, 80km north
of Coonawarra, in the
cool south east of South
Australia.
The soil was rich and
red. The climate ideal.
Lindemans chose to use this new district
to produce some very special wines.
Exotic varietals.
Wine styles many Australians wouldn't
even hear about for another ten years.
From 1981, Lindemans' foresight paid off
with wines that took the Wine Shows by storm.
Padthaway wines have since won a Special
Trophy and a staggering
39 Gold, 36 Silver and 41
Bronze medals.
The 1983 Chardonnay
is elegant yet powerful,
having distinctive varietal
aroma and flavour enhanced
by its maturation in oak.
A Gold Medal winner with
excellent cellaring potential.

The ultimate balancing act.
Riders from all over the world meet at the
Rolex Kentucky International Three-Day Event
to find not one champion but two: the horse and
rider that together form a perfect unit.
And few riders better demonstrate this ideal
of unity than the World Champion, Lucinda
Green. For Lucinda uniquely balances the many
talents that make a champion in her field.
Certainly Lucinda’s Rolex, a Lady-Date
Oyster, combines qualities not unlike her own -
style, precision and hidden stamina. A becoming
watch for a World Champion.

well known to Australians as are their
contemporaries from Britain. This is
possibly as a result of the publishing
system by which most American writers
come to us via English publishers, often
after long delays, because those school-
children brought up on English poets
tend to continue with more English
poets or the Australians.
This is a heart-breaking book in
many ways. The poets, although some-
times drunkenly contentious, admired
and loved each other, wished for one
another’s success. They were of an age
and the bond was their obsession with
the writing of poetry, with the writing of
the perfect poem. Which, of course, was
never written.
The poet’s idea of his or her place in
the world has always been hard for the
world to understand but Simpson was
right to try to explain. I hope that
people other than poets, critics and the-
sis-manufacturers read her book. □
BOOK BULLETIN
The history of the loud shirt
by Patricia Rofe
JUST WHEN we thought we had seen
the last Labor politician wearing his last
Hawaiian shirt at a party conference,
the shirt becomes a collectable. Thames
and Hudson in January will publish The
Hawaiian Shirt in which Thomas Steele
traces the history of the shirt with details
of fabrics and methods of manufacture,
the Hollywood stars who made them
famous and the fine points which make
a shirt particularly collectable.
The book has 150 shirt designs and
labels in all their gaudy glory. Steele ex-
plains the significance of Polynesian
legends portrayed, with notes on other
details of design.
Exploring north-eastern Brazil: Germaine Greer on the sternwheeler Sâo Francisco
BOOKSHOPS may be awash with
books on rivers this Christmas. On Sep-
tember 21 Hodder and Stoughton pub-
lish Great Rivers of the World and in
November BBC-Pitman have River
Journeys.
River Journeys is the book of a joint
BBC-ABC TV series, to be screened
early in 1985. There are six rivers and
six authors. It comes closer to home
with Russell Braddon doing the Murray
and Christina Dodwell exploring the
Sepik and Wahgi in Papua New
Guinea. Germaine Greer visits Brazil on
the last trip of a vintage paddle-wheeler.
According to the publisher, Greer
analyses the social and economic prob-
lems of the people who live along the
river no mean feat from a paddle-
wheeler.
AS SOON as the Prime Minister an-
nounces the election date, several mem-
bers of the Canberra press gallery will
write their stories and then phone their
publishers. The quick campaign book is
an institution; people such as Brian
Johns of Penguin would as soon come
to Sydney and not lunch at EJ’s as let a
federal election go by without a book.
These are paperback quickies and pub-
lishers can be moderately satisfied if
most of the sales are around Canberra
and in political science departments.
In the United States, however, where
publishers expect a far greater invest-
ment and return on such a book, the
campaign biography is vanishing.
Ronald Steel, in The New York Times
Book Review, traces its history. He takes
as the high point Theodore White’s The
Making of the President in 1960: “Part
civics teacher, part political junkie, part
grizzled newsman, Mr White breathed
drama into an event that lacked form
and defied rational understanding.”
By 1968 it was Joe McGinniss, “a
child of Marshall McLuhan,” who
called his book The Selling of the Presi-
dent. This time round, the nearest thing
to a campaign biography is Kathleen
Hall Jamieson’s Packaging the President
which not only looks at the effects
of television campaigns but also at
how political television advertising can
distort.
Steel makes the obvious point that
when elections become spectacles, cam-
paign literature becomes entertainment:
“The books we get reflect the politics we
have. Having had our living room war,
we now have our living room cam-
paign.”

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
Melbourne’s crisis -the vanishing herd instinct
YOU MUST appreciate there is a crisis
in Melbourne. We are suffering from a
grave deprivation of the herd instinct.
Our crowds are beginning to fall off.
Now, there is a well developed the-
ory that Melburnians are the most
passionate sportwatchers on Earth.
If you want to stage something to
raise money whether it be football, ten-
nis, cricket or even something crude
such as motor racing hold it in Mel-
bourne. It has always been so.
A Carlton-Melbourne match in June
1880 drew 15,000 people. Novelist Nat
Gould was astonished by it all. He said:
“It is no uncommon thing on a Satur-
day afternoon in Melbourne, when the
famous clubs meet in a Cup Tie, to see
from 25,000 to 30,000 spectators pre-
sent. Considering the population as
compared with some great English cit-
ies, this, I think, is an extraordinary at-
tendance.”
Even by 1860 the Melbourne Cricket
Ground was the best in the world and
Flemington race track also became a
phenomenon. The official crowd figure
for the Melbourne Cup of 1880 was
100,000. When you consider that the en-
tire population was only 282,000, better
than one in every three people were at
the races on that day.
Is it possible that we are losing our
passion for watching? VFL football, tra-
ditionally the biggest crowd-puller in
Australian sport, unquestionably is
losing its appeal. VFL crowds are down
by more than 240,000 this season, a 7.6
percent drop on 1983.
Various reasons have been put for-
ward for all this. The weather has been
wet and horrid. But it is not unusual for
weather to be wet and horrid in Mel-
bourne during June, July, August.
It costs $6 a game to get in while the
fellow who is playing very likely is com-
plaining because he is only getting
$lOOO a throw to be there.
There is a further complaint that the
game has lost its beauty and excitement
as a spectacle. The modern trend is to a
high-speed dash toward goal by hand-
ball. A generation is being developed
that does not know how to mark or how
to kick. You might get something like
650 handballs a match. It is not aerial
ping pong any more; it is terrestrial
keepings-off.
The situation is even more parlous in
racing. Between 1961 and 1981, the
number of galloping races in Mel-
bourne increased by 30 percent but at-
tendances dropped 25 percent. Between
Barring added culture, something for Melbourne sports officials to consider: at Sydney’s
Taronga Park zoo, keeping up the flamingo array is all done with mirrors
1979 and 1983, metropolitan crowds
went down by 12.2 percent and down by
3 percent in the country.
For the 10 months to May 31 this
year, it has been even worse: 8 percent
less than for the same period in 1982-83.
As for harness racing, back in 1947-
48 the Showgrounds averaged crowds of
23,400. The average in 1983 was 8200.
They have been down another 12 per-
cent this season. Greyhound racing has
been just as unfortunate. Attendances
fell by 33 percent between 1977 and
1983.
According to a special report by a
Victorian racing industry working party
all sorts of inducements, advertising
and marketing gimmicks have failed.
Although one would suggest that the
racing industry has not run short of
publicity in recent weeks.
Of course many people blame all this
on the TAB. There is a suggestion that
people don’t really go to the races for
the fashion or the pure beauty of horse
flesh. Why pay $5 to get in to the races
and a dollar for a racebook when you
can be so comfortable doing your bet-
ting at home?
Maybe too, the citizens are finding
other things to do with their spare time
such as touring in their increasingly
comfortable cars or staying at home
toying with their videos, enjoying per-
haps a re-run of the 1952 grand final
when football was football.
And who knows perhaps it is
more than a coincidence that there has
been an extraordinary swing to culture
in Melbourne. The new Melbourne Arts
Centre is booming. On Saturdays when
some people still go to the football and
the races, the theatres at the Art Centre
are scoring an average of 12,000 people,
day and evening. Jim McPherson, pub-
licity director at the Arts Centre, said:
“I don’t care where you are ... 12,000
paying patrons is good business.”
He said further: “The number of sub-
scribers to the Australian Ballet is up by
45 percent, subscribers to the State Op-
era also are way up.”
He said a poor show at the Arts
Centre was death, like anywhere else,
but you couldn’t get into an Australian
Broadcasting Corporation concert at
the concert hall. It has been so busy that
600 people last week paid $3.50 just to
get into a rehearsal. Then there were
those who wanted only to look upon the
trappings of culture: between 2000 and
3000 a week wanted to go on guided
tours.
Oh, I tell you it is a very busy Arts
Centre. The National Gallery is still
holding its Picasso exhibition. It had
72,000 people in the first 29 days and
those crowds are building all the time.
It might be something for the VFL
and the VRC to think about: Why not
an art show, why not an ensemble
playing Mozart, why not a scene from a
Greek tragedy at half-time or between
races? □

Edited by c ßim Saw
Lady Helen Windsor, buxom 20-year-
old daughter of the Duke of Kent, has
been forbidden to become a pop star.
Apparently she had been offered a re-
cording contract but had to reject it for
protocol reasons. Fact: Helen’s nick-
name in society circles is “Melons.”
The accident-prone Allan Moult (the
only journalist in history to have been
carried, enstretchered, from assignment
in the Australian Alps, suffering from
gout) has achieved a remarkable double.
First, he spent six months writing a re-
markable, well magnificent book,
Australian Adventuers in Leisure, cover-
ing and photographing remarkable
sports, of many of which the average
Australian has never heard. There are
bushwalking, cycling, abseiling (climb-
ing to you), canoeing, sailboarding ...
well, okay. But then there are rafting,
scuba-diving, hard-hat diving, camel-
riding, ice-climbing, caving, cross-
country skiing and canyoning (which
seems to include everything from walk-
ing, talking, sliding and swimming to
common or garden whistling and yodel-
ling). With diver Neville Coleman,
Moult also managed to photograph the
all-new, ring-a-ding-ding Lord Howe
Island yellow kingfish. All this and in
six months he broke, sprained, gashed,
bruised, contused, walked into and fell
over nothing.
Boys at Sherborne, one of Britain’s top
private schools, are somewhat envious
of the holidays of fellow pupil Prince
Makhosetive. He went back to Swazi-
land, where he is the crown prince, and
there attended the reed dance. This
tribal ceremony climaxes with a parade
of hundreds of nubile maidens, naked
to the waist, from whom the 15-year-old
lad chose one of his wives. Alas, he
couldn’t take the lucky princess back to
Sherborne as wives are forbidden in the
dorms.
Jennifer Darvall has been elected chair-
man of Barnardo’s, which used to be Dr
Barnardo’s, the charity which annually
brings about 800 young Poms to Austra-
lia brings them here and cares for
them, too, at a cost of about $2 million.
She is the wife of Chum Darvall, the
Sydney QC, and the mother of Young
Chum who is the senior manager in
charge of Bank America’s second series
of “Dingos.” So it is entirely possible
that the young Poms, who might not in
the UK be in touch with such matters,
will learn that “Dingos” are Discounted
Investments in Negotiable Government
Obligations. Is that all clear?
In Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and
wherever trousers are polished in the
country’s defence, the great brains of
the nation writhed over a choice of heli-
copters: a few dozen US Sikorskys at
$l6 million a time or the same number
of Brit Westlands which would be a
steal at only $8.5 million each. Mean-
while, in Sydney, Dr Victor Chang, the
brilliant heart surgeon, was hoping that
somebody would stump up the $5 mil-
lion he needs not to kill people but to
start keeping them alive with bionic
hearts.

If Bruce The Boss Springsteen, the 34-
year-old big deal in American rock,
does indeed tour Australia AND if his
saxman Clarence Clemons comes with
him AND if Clarence kisses Bruce bang
on the lips on-stage, as he does in their
US concerts, the Festival of Lighters
could be in a tremble of indignation.
The wowsers needn’t worry. It’s no
more than showbiz fun; at the average
Springsteen concert there is no dope,
nothing stronger than beer, and next-to
no groupies and the wildest activity is
the yawning of the cops.


In Surfers Paradise, where he was in-
specting an exhibition of his works, art-
ist Pro Hart had a problem. Pro, despite
his Rolls-Royce, his priceless collection
of books and, above all, his remarkable
talent, is an unvarnished, unsophisti-
cated Broken Hill boy who washes
down his larks’ tongues and oysters-
stewed-in-honey with honest, uncomp-
licated beer; none of this juice of the
berry for Pro. But recently he did a bit
of a job for the Perrier champagne
people and what on earth was he to
do with $6OOO worth of fizz?
Between Adelong and Batlow, in
southern NSW, Kerrie Bunter, 24, on
her way to get flowers for her wedding
next day, was involved in a car smash
that put her in Wagga Base Hospital. It
seemed that she might be there for
weeks, unwed. But Bunter went to the
altar anyway, the “something new”
stitches and bandages, the “something
blue” bruises that made her look
not unlike an ancient Briton and the
“something borrowed” the arms of
nurses who carried her to the altar. The
“something old” was the almost courtly
and heartwarming attitude of husband-
to-be Alan Wild who told her: “I don’t
care what you look like; I love you all
the same.” So they both went to the re-
ception, began their honeymoon
together in hospital back in Wagga.
No sooner had Edgar Degas painted his
immortal picture The Absinthe Drinkers,
than fin-de-siecle French wowsers, prob-
ably led by forebears of the Rev Fred
Nile, decided that absinthe was a sin
and a shame and a prime cause of the
effete in French society. By 1915 it had
been banned in France; though, as its
main flavoring was wormwood, nobody
kicked up a very great fuss. Substitutes
included Pernod, anis and pastis. And
then some thinker reasoned that there
was probably as much pleasure in a
drink that tasted nice as in one that
knocked you orry-eyed. So Dubonnet
was born: as mother’s milk to strych-
nine when compared with absinthe but
Oh, what a drink! The Australian im-
porters, arguing that it is not strictly
necessary to go along with only those
tipples beer, dry wines, whisky that
make you hold your nose while you
swallow, have begun a big promotion
which was highlighted this week by 100
people browsing and sluicing and being
entertained in Double Bay by the splen-
did Gaye MacFarlane. They called it
Dubonnet avec Moi ce Soir. With the
idea of making the ce Soir something
like Toujours.

In the yoke of Mr Bullock
PHILLIP ADAMS
“DEAR Mr Adams,” fawns the letter,
“I am pleased to inform you that you
are one of a very select number of
people whose standing in the commu-
nity qualifies them for (roll of drums)
American Express Cardmembership.”
Cardmembership. One word. The
penultimate accolade. The ultimate be-
ing Gold Cardmembership.
“In recognition of this, the American
Express Card has been set aside for you.
Upon receipt and final approval of the
enclosed request form, we will issue you
with the Card.”
The Card. Doesn’t it give you goose
bumps?
I’m quoting from the opening para-
graphs of a letter signed not by Uriah
Heep but by Mr Martyn Bullock Mr
Bullock being Vice-President, Con-
sumer Financial Services, American Ex-
press International Inc.
I don’t know what I’ve done but Mr
Bullock is very fond of me. You see, he
keeps sending me these letters. I’ve had
dozens of them. Full of flattery and
blandishments, they go to my home ad-
dress and my various office addresses.
I’ve been under a lot of
pressure from Mr Bullock. I
get the feeling that his letters
are not really invitations at all
but demands that Card-
membership is combloody-
pulsory.
The trouble is that I
achieved my American Ex-
press Cardmembership many,
many years ago; it was just
after I abandoned Card-
membership of the Commu-
nist Party. Joining Amex was
sort of symbolic of leaving
Moscow.
As it happens, I have no
fewer than four American Ex-
press cards, for the sake of ac-
curate accounting. But can I
persuade Mr Bullock of this
fact? No, I am destined,
doomed, to be dragooned into
having a fifth and a sixth and
a 10th and a 100th card from
his insatiable organisation.
Mind you, there’s every
chance that Mr Bullock
doesn’t really exist. Perhaps
he’s just a floppy disc or a
microchip in an IBM 360.
Frankly, I’ve always doubted
whether Electrolux has a Mr
Jolly. But if you are there, Mr
Bullock, on the 93rd floor of
the American Express building, hear my
plea ...
Please, please, Mr Bullock, leave me
alone!
Aren’t I spending enough? God
knows, I try. I book everything to my
Amex card: Hotel bills, taxis ... The
last time I was robbed, I was delighted
to find that the mugger accepted Amex.
(He had one of those plastic printing
machines in his pocket.)
Mr Bullock, if you leave me alone,
I’ll even have my Amex number tat-
tooed on my forearm. But, for pity sake,
give me a break. Because, if you don’t,
I’ll come up to Sydney and beat you to
death with my Diners Club.
I used to be so proud of my Amex
card, flashing it at head waiters like
Efrem Zimbalist junior exposing his G-
man badge in The FBI. And there’s no
question that one’s first Amex card is a
significant Rite of Passage, like being
circumcised or wearing long trousers.
I well remember being in Bond
Street, London, years and years ago
with Barry Humphries when we were
new to cardmembership when we
Sydney’s American Express Tower: is Big Bullock watching?
took the view that it was compulsory to
make a purchase from any shop boast-
ing the familiar blue measles. Barry
would sail in the door and say: “We’ve
got to buy something. We’re members.”
It’s the truth, Mr Bullock: I joined 20
years ago when the American Express
was a mere Puffing Billy. Can’t you ac-
cept that? Can’t you give me some res-
pite for good behaviour?
It has been worst of all in 1984. I
have the feeling that Big Bullock is
watching me.
I feel sorry for the forests that Amex
put to the axe just so they can print the
letters Mr Bullock writes me. I feel like
one of the heroines in an old-time serial
who has been tied to the railway tracks

As a part-time archaeologist, I dis-
covered a fascinating thing: that ancient
civilisations were buried in
their own rubbish. Because
the garbos didn’t come round
on Mondays and Thursdays,
people just tossed their refuse
out the kitchen window.
Little by little, slowly but
surely, your civilisation disap-
peared beneath its detritus.
And the new city was built on
top.
This is why excavations re-
veal up to nine or 10 cities,
one beneath the other.
Well, it’s my belief (or my
fear) that modern civilisations
will not be destroyed by nu-
clear weapons but by invita-
tions to join American Ex-
press that, by the end of the
century, only Mr Bullock and
his colleagues sitting up there
on the 93rd floor will be safe.
The rest of Sydney, the rest of
Australia, will be submerged
in their paperwork. The once
lovely harbor will be so much
wet papiermache, the bridge
and the Opera House a wistful
memory ... Which means that
the wretched card won’t be
any use as the entire 47,500 re-
tail outlets that accepted it
will long since have been
suffocated. □

Too many courtiers hurt sport of kings
DAVID M c NICOLL
DECLINING attendances are the prin-
cipal and continuing worry for Austra-
lia’s turf clubs. The problem is roughly
equal in all states - more and more
people are finding alternative ways of
spending their Saturday and Wednes-
day afternoons.
The “decline” figures are remark-
able. Fifty years ago, 60,000 people at
Randwick was not a matter for particu-
lar comment. Now, a crowd of 20,000
sends racing administrators into trans-
ports.
At Randwick, I ran into Alec Gray
(whose father introduced the six-strand
barrier, the great bridge between the
single strand and the automatic gates).
Alex had a racebook of Chelmsford
Day in 1933 when the crowd at
Randwick was huge. On that day, 86
bookmakers were operating in the Pad-
dock, 104 in the Leger and 140 on the
Flat. On Chelmsford Day this year there
were 95 bookmakers operating at
Randwick, of whom 33 were betting on
interstate races.
It is not a question of racing being
any cleaner in the old days. Or better
conducted. Or better horses. In my
view, it is the extraordinary variety of
alternative attractions plus that so many
people of various ages own motor cars.
The decline in bookies is merely a
result of TAB popularity plus heavy tax-
ation and, one hopes, smarter punters.
THE APPALLING carnage of the Syd-
ney bikies produced possibly the most
gripping, if ghastly, news story for
years. One interesting outcome was that
the print media came out way ahead of
television in coverage of the melee.
It was also an occasion when the
Murdoch press gave the Fairfax press a
most unholy shellacking. Both The Aus-
tralian and the Daily Telegraph beat the
Sydney Morning Herald badly in every
facet of coverage. The most extraordi-
nary feature of Granny’s coverage was
that the carnage was not even made the
page one lead!
WHEN the Wran government came to
power, about 95 percent of Supreme
Court judges had been appointed
during the Askin regime. Since Premier
Wran took office, in 1976, appointments
to the bench have resulted in between 55
and 60 percent of current judges being
Wran government selections. And, ac-
cording to the Chief Justice, the Su-
preme Court bench is well balanced and
most effective.
Bikie carnage: it failed to make the page one lead of The Sydney Morning Herald
The question of political appoint-
ments will always be controversial.
There have been suggestions that an
outside judicial panel should present a
preliminary short list. But this would
not be desirable because it would tend
to estrange the government of the day
from the bench of the day.
High Court appointments are sup-
posed to be made only after the federal
government consults the states. But, in
practice, the federal government makes
its choice irrespective of any state views.
(In America, of course, prospective ap-
pointees to the Supreme Court have to
be approved by Congress.)
Attorney-General Senator Gareth
Evans should take a good look at him-
self when he attacks the federal Opposi-
tion over the pursuit of Justice Murphy.
It was Evans who introduced judge-
baiting for political purposes when he
set his sights on former Chief Justice
Barwick.
THIS TIME last year I was in Canada
and had the pleasure of talking to the
new Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney. A
charismatic type, a sort of cross between
Bob Hawke and John F. Kennedy.
I asked him why he was confident of
success. He said that Canadians were
tired of Trudeau’s harassing of small
business. The Trudeau Liberal (which
means socialist in Canada) government
imagined that the economy was so rich
and powerful that it could withstand
any amount of interference by a govern-
ment.
He also told me that he hoped to visit
Australia at the earliest opportunity.
I AM a non-cigarette smoker but I do
not believe in the high-handed way in
which the anti-smoking brigade tries to
enforce its beliefs.
It was encouraging to ride in a cab
the other day driven by a hale and
hearty veteran named Ernie Boman
which contained a notice “Smoke if you
want to.”
THE AJC committee election turned
Tattersall’s meeting into an afternoon of
heavy lobbying by the five aspirants. By
the end of the day, I had been obliged to
make some revisions to my “book”
about the result.
Tony Allport still holds his position
as a short-priced favorite. But Arthur
Fitzgerald had firmed dramatically after
some remarkable track trials and
presses Allport. Messara has blown out
to 3 to 1. Peter Morris who is, in a
fashion, running in tandem with Tony
Allport has firmed to 6 to 1. Joe Gazal,
who will have strong support from Tatts
Club, is still my outsider.


What should you
expect from a
working partnership
with Hewlett-Packard?
"To keep up with
the costs of running
a packaging business
these days, you have to
keep up with technology.
At Visy Board we have
established a national
network of Hewlett-
Packard personal and
business computers to
help us manage more
efficiently."
Kevin Bamford, General Manager,
Visy Board
Visy Board's integrated system
of HP3OOO computers throughout
Australia provides uniform
financial reporting information for
their 13 autonomous plants. Their
many HP personal computers
provide both local processing and
interfacing to the central computers
for costing orders, estimating
and quoting.
Four HP3ooo's allow Visy
Board to analyse sales, market by
market, and study segment usage.
There is a complete run down of
the history on customer accounts
m
and an analysis of the cost of
each job.
With Hewlett-Packard
systems, outstanding debtors
have been reduced because of
the speed at which customers
can now be invoiced. Hewlett-
Packard computers allow direct
invoicing at the time of delivery,
hence shaving down the time
factor between delivery and
payment. Computerised
machine scheduling has led to
significant reductions in wastage
of raw materials and stock-
holding of paper.
It's been easy for Visy Board
to develop this and other
programs in-house, as they are
constantly kept in touch with the
latest program developments
from Hewlett-Packard.
Increased productivity hasn't
been confined to computer
programming. On the factory
floor each shift can now provide
up to date information on order
progress through the factory.
Computerised shop floor control
systems are now becoming an
integrated part of the manu-
facturing network. These advances
lead to increased productivity,
customer service and direct control
of the manufacturing process.
And when it came to the
America's Cup Visy Board backed
its confidence in Hewlett-Packard
by equipping its challenger with
Hewlett-Packard personal
computers from Damar
Management Systems, Geelong.
As Kevin Bamford says,
"In order to manage a business
these days, you need to keep up
with the latest technology. Visy
Board, together with Hewlett-
Packard, is doing just that"
Assured Results.
At Hewlett-Packard we believe
that you should have the same high
expectations of the company who
supplies your computer as you do of the
equipment itself. And it is Hewlett-Packard's
commitment to optimising our customers'
investment in computers that has earned
us a reputation internationally for reliable
performance with our products and services.
Hewlett-Packard brings to its computers
the same quality of manufacture, and
support services that customers have come
to expect from Hewlett-Packard's electronic,
medical and analytical instruments and
systems, and personal computers.
In Australia we have offices in every major
city and a sales and support service
employing over 530 people.
Hewlett-Packard have deliberately chosen
to work on the very frontier of technology,
to innovate rather than emulate. But this
doesn't mean we make our own products
obsolete, rather our software and hardware
are designed to be easily upgradeable and
ready for long term growth.
And because you can't expect to make
all of your staff computer experts,
Hewlett- Packard makes computers
that are people experts. Each piece of
equipment is designed to be "user
friendl/ and "talk" in a language that is easily
understood by the user.
We also arrange special training seminars
to show you and your staff how to get the
best performance from your equipment.

Coming within a whisker of vanity
RON SAW
“WHAT about Andrew Peacock’s eyes,
eh?” said Trumpet, the lion of the Can-
berra press gallery. “Hur-hur-hur.”
“So what about them?” asked
Shirley, the barmaid.
“Well, all that plastic surgery to get
rid of the bags. Hur-hur. Hur-hur-hur.”
“So what about your teeth?” asked
Shirk
“Eh?” said Trumpet, in such alarm
that his eye-teeth jumped on their loose-
fitting plate.
“Well, I bet you don’t hear Andrew
Peacock telling people you had to get
rid of the holes in your smile. I bet you
don’t make jokes about Hawke’s awful
hair or Lionel Murphy’s nose.”
Hawke and Murphy can wear their
hair and their noses any way they please
as far as I’m concerned but I had to
agree with Shirks message generally.
Once upon a time it was considered
rude to make personal remarks. You
considered it a lot ruder if somebody
made personal remarks about you.
I had never really worried about it
though I’m as vain as the best of ’em
until about a day before I sailed my
boat into the Seychelles and one of my
crew asked me: “Aren’t you going to
shave off your whiskers?”
“Why would I want to shave off my
whiskers? It’s taken me three months to
grow ’em.”
“But your missus is going to meet
you. You wouldn’t want her to see you
looking like that.”
I asked him what was the matter with
my whiskers but I suppose he thought
he’d gone too far. He just shrugged and
went up to the foredeck and looked out
to sea for a few hours.
As soon as I could, I hurried below
and inspected my whiskers in a mirror. I
don’t suppose they were very pretty.
Well, for that matter, I don’t suppose
you’d be far wrong if you described
them as hideous.
Most people I know manage to grow
beards of an even color. If they’re of
middle years their beards will be dis-
tinguished, usually, with streaks of sil-
ver but that’s about as colorful as they
get. My beard, I saw now, was not so
much a beard as a collection of tufts of
many ghastly colors. My hair had never
been black, never white, but now the
tufts ranged from black through orange,
mouse, blond and grey to icy white.
I realised that my friend was right: it
would be wrong to frighten my wife
with a nasty sight like that. I would have
to do away with it.
The immediate solution was shaving.
But that beard was the result of three
months’ work, growing and trimming,
that was, in fact, far more trouble than
I’d have had if I’d remained clean-
shaven. That beard was my pride let’s
face it: my vanity like 99 percent of
all beards.
Had there been some dye aboard, I’d
have given it the treatment but there was
none.
I had to go ashore with a brown fore-
head and cheeks like a baby’s bottom. I
felt wretched but at least I had ensured
that my wife, small Seychellois children
and nervous dogs remained calm.
I’ve no doubt that Andrew Peacock
was afraid that children and dogs would
run from him, too. It’s possible that
they, too, would have remained calm
but what on earth is all the fuss about?
If Andrew Peacock wants his eyes
debagged, why not let him go for his
life? Frankly, I can’t notice much differ-
ence; but, then, I’ve not spent much
time examining him closely. He’s al-
ways seemed a reasonably good-looking
joker but, if he wants to suntan his face
or wear a corset or paint his nose like a
carrot, it’s simply chawbaconish for
other people to guffaw.
It’s okay for not only women but
also surfies, golfers, cricketers,
footballers, actors and, I wouldn’t mind
betting, a few politicians to dye their
hair. Why not? What’s wrong
with a bit of vanity?
It’s okay to cap your teeth,
to have bridgework, to have
hair transplanted to your thin-
ning or bald patches, to have
your nose bobbed, your chins
and warts removed. So why in
heaven’s name the fuss about
a simple cosmetic job on a
bloke’s eyes?
For years now, I’ve been
thinking of getting either a
hair transplant or a hairpiece.
Vanity? Certainly that’s part
of it but not all. The hair on
the top of my head is so thin
something like the hair on a
vulture’s neck that every
summer my scalp broils and it hurts like
hell. I don’t mind wearing hats but too
often I forget and, in about half an
hour, a pate which has been an attrac-
tive fishbelly white turns a vibrant but
painful fuchsia.
I’ve tried anointing it with block-out
unguents but they make my head sweat
and there are few sensations, let alone
sights, more loathsome.
The answer could be that adopted by
dear old Bill Joy when he was writing
feature articles for the Sydney Daily
Telegraph.
Bill’s hair was fairly thick around the
back and sides but on top he was simply
ovate. I don’t think he got sunburned
but in winter he got cold.
His wife’s hair was exactly the same
grey as his, so she chopped off enough
to make a neat little wig which Bill wore
with pride and great comfort.
When the hot and humid weather
arrived, Bill would simply take the thing
off and put it in his pocket.
For those who didn’t know him it
was unnerving to see a crop that was
luxurious grey at, say, elevenses turn to
a desert of skin at lunch. But Bill didn’t
care what people thought and the result
was that nobody ever said “Hur-hur.”
I think I might try it that way, al-
though my wife’s blonde hair might
look a bit odd on top of my grizzled
mouse.
With that done I’ll have my eyes
debagged, my teeth painted with that
whitener they use now, my nose
straightened, a few chins chopped off
... oh, all right: I’ll have my hair and
wig blonded like Greg Norman’s or
Thommo’s.
It’s going to be a busy summer.
Hur-hur-hur. □

ASIA
Old Enemies, New Friends
The leaders of South Korea and Japan make history—and a fresh start.
Many Koreans had waited 39 years for
this moment. Some Japanese would
have preferred not to see it happen at all.
There, as the guest of honor in the banquet
hall at Tokyo’s Imperial Palace, sat South
Korean President Chun Doo Hwan. As a
boy he had grown up under the fist of Japan’s
wartime colonial rule. Now his host was
none other than Japanese Emperor Hirohi-
to, whose troops once brutalized Korea. But
the time had finally come for a carefully
couched apology to Chun and his country-
men. “It is indeed regrettable that there was
an unfortunate past between us,” said the
white-haired, 83-year-old emperor before
he lifted a glass to toast his onetime subject.
“I believe it should not be repeated.”
In emotional and symbolic terms, the
emperor’s act of atonement last week was
the undoubted high point of Chun’s three-
day state visit to Tokyo, the
first such trip by a South Ko-
rean leader. Although the two
countries have had formal
diplomatic relations for near-
ly 20 years, the former colony
and its onetime conqueror
still view each other with
deep-seated suspicion and
mistrust. Given the tension,
Chun’s trip was understand-
ably controversial. Even be-
fore he left Seoul, thousands
of South Korean students
took to the streets of the capi-
tal to protest what they called
“sell-out” diplomacy. And
last week many Koreans dis-
missed Hirohito’s apology as
too little and too late. Never-
theless, the emperor’s words
seemed to conjure up a mood
of reconciliation. They also
set the stage for the real busi-
ness at hand: ongoing talks be-
tween Chun and Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Na-
kasone aimed at bridging the
troubled diplomatic waters
that stretch across the Sea
of Japan.
Political Risks: The two
leaders clearly faced an ardu-
ous passage. Nakasone had
made the first gesture last year
with his own unprecedented
trip to Seoul. But the compre-
hensive talks last week be-
tween senior officials of the
two governments managed to
accomplish little more than to
restate a daunting agenda of continuing
problems: Japan’s $2.6 billion annual trade
surplus with South Korea, its reluctance to
share high technology with Seoul and the
discrimination suffered by Japan’s 675,000
ethnic Koreans, many of whom have lived
there since the war. As demonstrators in
Seoul and Tokyo alike made abundantly
clear last week, all these issues carry heavy
political risks for both countries. Neverthe-
less, the specter of conflict between North
and South Korea that could haunt North
Pacific peace was a powerful force bringing
Chun and Nakasone together. “Maintain-
ing and developing” cooperative relations
between their countries, the two leaders
noted in a final communique, would contrib-
ute to “the peace and stability of East Asia
and hence to the peace of the world. ”
The Japanese began scrupulous security
Chun and his wife with Hirohito at the Akasaka Palace: ‘A new era'
SHUNSUKE AKATSUKA— UPI
precautions well before Chun’s Korean Air
Lines presidential jet touched down. An
estimated 23,000 Japanese police threw a
tight security net over much of Tokyo. Their
mission was to shield Chun from any violent
protests, ranging from possible demonstra-
tions by Japanese rightists—who authori-
ties feared might take umbrage at the emper-
or’s expected apology—to plots by North
Korean agents who might attempt a replay
of the assassination bombing that narrowly
missed killing Chun on a state visit to Burma
last October. The police did not stop all the
protesters, however. Shortly before Chun’s
arrival, 2,000 helmeted left-wing radicals
marched outside Haneda Airport shouting,
“Smash Chun’s visit.”
But that did not mar his arrival. Chun was
met at the airport by Japanese Foreign Min-
ister Shintaro Abe. Then —while the heli-
copters in which Chun and
Abe had been expected to
travel sat on the runway—the
party sped into Tokyo in a
heavily guarded motorcade
along a closed-off, 15-mile
route to the Akasaka Palace,
Japan’s state guesthouse. Na-
kasone was waiting, and Hiro-
hito himself joined the party
shortly after the South Kore-
an leader’s arrival. Police had
cordoned off a seven-square-
mile area of downtown To-
kyo, encompassing both the
Imperial Palace and the prime
minister’s official residence,
Chun’s only other destina-
tions in his 49-hour stay.
Courtesy Call: While a giant
police blimp floated silently
overhead, the president and
his wife, Lee Soon Ja, accept-
ed formal greetings from their
Japanese hosts. Chun walked
briskly in review past an hon-
or guard of troops from the
Japanese Self-Defense Force,
a far cry from Hirohito’s im-
perial forces that once rode
roughshod over Asia. Later
that afternoon, the South Ko-
rean president paid a return
courtesy call on Hirohito at
the Imperial Palace. Then
Chun and Nakasone went be-
hind closed doors at the Aka-
saka Palace for the first of
their two scheduled formal
meetings.
Until the formal palace


banquet that evening, there
was widespread specula-
tion, but no official hint,
about the form that the em-
peror’s official statement
might take. Hirohito, once
regarded as divine, is still
revered by the Japanese, and
by tradition his speeches are
extraordinarily understated
and circumspect. (He an-
nounced Japan’s 1945 sur-
render, for instance, by tell-
ing his subjects that “the war
situation has developed not
necessarily to our advan-
tage.”) His mention last
week of the “unfortunate
past” occupied only a single
brief paragraph midway
through a 500-word address
that was otherwise devoted
largely to formalities and
praise for Japanese-Korean
cultural ties going back to
the sixth century.
The Right Wing: Part of
the reason for that delicacy
was the Tokyo govern-
ment’s concern that any
stronger statements would play into the
hands of some Japanese—especially those
on the country’s noisy right wing—who feel
that neither they nor their emperor have
anything to apologize for. The phrasing of
Hirohito’s expression of regret was essen-
tially the same as had been used in similar
imperial toasts to other representatives of
Japan’s former wartime opponents, includ-
ing U.S. President Gerald Ford in 1974 and
Chinese strongman Deng Xiaoping four
years later. Chun replied to the emperor by
saying he had “listened solemnly” and then
quoted a Korean proverb, “The ground
hardens after a rainfall.” That, he said,
meant that “close friends, after a quarrel,
become more friendly than ever. ”
Many other Koreans reacted less charita-
bly. In Seoul, where hun-
dreds of students had earlier
taken to the streets to burn
Rising Sun flags and shout
anti-Japanese slogans, the
tightly controlled press car-
ried front-page pictures of
the imperial banquet, with
the headline emperor ex-
tends APOLOGY TO CHUN.
But Muk Yo Sang, spokes-
man for the opposition
Democratic Korea Party,
said: 7We are greatly disap-
pointed . . . We expected
a stronger apology.” A
spokesman for Chongryun,
the North Korean residents’
association in Japan, said
that the emperor’s apology
was “meaningless,” because
it was made to Chun, “who
cannot represent the Kore-
Japanese leftists protest the visit outside Haneda Airport: Tight security
SUSUMU TAKAHASHI— UPI
an people.” And from Pyongyang, the offi-
cial North Korean news agency attacked the
entire notion of an imperial apology, calling
Chun a “pro-Japanese stooge” and de-
nouncing Hirohito as a “war criminal” who
now has “no real power.”
At lunch the following day, Prime Minis-
ter Nakasone seemed determined to mute
some of the criticism with his own, more
direct admission of Japanese guilt. Citing
what he called the “great sufferings” that
Japan had inflicted on Korea, Nakasone did
not go significantly further than some of his
other recent comments on the war. He was
undeniably forthright—a trait he shares
with Chun and which may well account for
partofthesuccessthatthetwoleadershadat

KAKUKURITA
Japanese-Korean relations.
The two leaders give ev-
ery appearance of getting on
remarkably well. They seem
largely free of the colonial-
era bitterness that many of
their compatriots still cling
to. Nakasone, 67, served
during the second world war
as an officer in the Imperial
Navy’s paymaster corps; he
saw no combat action.
Chun, 53, was still a child
when the war ended, but old
enough to have learned
to speak schoolboy Japa-
nese —which, like most Ko-
reans of his generation, he
now prefers as a point of
honor not to use. The two
men are reportedly in regu-
lar communication, using a
telephone hot line that was
installed between Tokyo
and Seoul following Naka-
sone’s visit to South Korea
last year. The Japanese
prime minister had original-
ly wanted to invite Chun and
his wife to a closing private
luncheon at the mountainside villa where he
had been host to Ronald and Nancy Reagan
last November. But security advisers said
no, and the two couples had to settle instead
for lunch together on Saturday at the prime
minister’s official residence in down-
town Tokyo.
A High Road: It will take more than a
personal entente to cut through the thicket
of bilateral issues that complicate friendly
relations between Japan and South Korea.
In last week’s summit talks, Chun and
Nakasone gave the most troublesome prob-
lems—trade, technical aid and the com-
plaints of Japan’s ethnic Koreans —a com-
fortably wide berth. They kept instead to a
diplomatic high road; their formal meet-
ings, which lasted nearly three hours, fo-
cused on the broader con-
cerns of peace in the North
Pacific region, particularly
the ever-continuing prob-
lem of tensions between
North and South Korea.
Even on that issue, there
were differences. To the
Seoul government’s obvi-
ous displeasure, Tokyo has
continued in recent years to
carry on a variety of quiet
dealings with the North
Koreans, renegotiating
fishery treaties and extend-
ing hundreds of millions of
dollars in trade-financing
loans, now technically in
default. At the first of their
two sessions last week, Na-
kasone assured Chun that
his government had no in-
tention of upgrading its


Strangers in Their Own Land
Shin Inn Hah, a 17-year-old high-school coed, seemed an
unlikely fugitive from justice. But two years ago the shy, raven-
haired Korean found herself in a confrontation with Japanese
immigration officials when she refused to let them fingerprint
her. Shin, technically a foreigner in the country where she was
born and raised, is required by law to have her fingerprints
recorded on an alien-registration certificate she must carry with
her at all times. Criminal charges against her were eventually
dropped. But authorities threatened to refuse to give her the
travel documents that would enable her to attend a high school
in the United States. Two weeks ago, after constant harassing by
officials, Shin reluctantly gave in. “My [Japanese] classmates
don’t have to be fingerprinted,” she says bitterly, “Why do I?”
Shin is just one of many ethnic Koreans in Japan who have
refused to comply with what they view as official discrimina-
tion. Fingerprinting is only one example of the prejudicial
bureaucratic red tape that Koreans contend exists beneath the
surface of Japan’s outwardly homogeneous society. The first
generation of Korean residents was forcibly brought to Japan
before the end of World War II
to work as miners and factory
laborers. Today their descend-
ants continue to occupy the bot-
tom rungs of the country’s rigid-
ly hierarchical social ladder.
They are discriminated against
in jobs, housing and education.
They are often crowded into
squalid slums. Many of them can
find work only in small sweat-
shops or as day laborers. On the
average, they earn only 60 per-
cent as much as their Japanese
compatriots.
Hamstrung: Officials in Tokyo
tend to deny that any ethnic
problems exist. But many Kore-
an residents argue that preju-
dice against them runs so deep
there is no point in trying to
become naturalized Japanese
citizens. Instead, they have or-
ganized themselves into two
tightly knit self-help organiza-
tions that run everything from
their own schools and banks to publishing companies. One,
called Mindan, represents those Koreans who are sympathetic
to capitalist South Korea; the other, Chongryun, supporters of
the communist North. But the same hatreds and hostilities that
divide the two countries on the Korean peninsula have kept the
two groups at odds, and have hamstrung all efforts to form a
united front.
The division has been a special headache for younger Korean
residents who worry more about building a life for themselves in
Japan than about the byzantine politics of a homeland many
have never seen. But the coming of a new generation of Korean
residents may yet bridge the gap between the two factions, and
perhaps even ease Koreans’ entry into Japanese society. “We
second- and third-generation Koreans are tormented by the
split,” says Kwon Chung-Ji, head of Mindan’s student section.
“We may be divided politically, but we all have the same
problems.”
Almost all Korean residents, especially the young, speak
fluent Japanese, and often have little or no command of their
Korean mother tongue. But they continue to struggle against
barriers that block their entrance into
schools and jobs. The Japanese govern-
ment refuses to accredit the 154 Korean
schools run by Chongryun, which has an estimated 200,000
members, nor the five run by Mindan, which has about
450,000. Yet even if a Korean graduated from the prestigious
Tokyo University, argues Choo Yeong Sang, Mindan public-
relations director, “he couldn’t join a top Japanese corpora-
tion. Koreans can’t even take entrance exams for companies
like Mitsui & Co. and Sumitomo Corp.”
Sumitomo Corp. officials say the firm has hired Koreans in
the past but refused to specify how many. Mitsui & Co. officials
say they have no foreign employees, Korean or otherwise, and
that if a Korean applied they would have to discuss what to do
about the application.
Brutalities: Japanese animosity toward the Korean immi-
grants stretches back over decades. When the great Kanto
earthquake leveled much of Tokyo on Sept. 1, 1923, panic-
stricken residents turned on the Koreans, killing an estimated
4,000 to 6,000 people in random lynchings, beatings, and
street-side executions. During Japan’s colonial domination of
the Korean peninsula, many Koreans were stripped of their
A Korean slum in Japan: Years of prejudice and ill will have not yet been erased
land and brought to Japan. Japanese brutalities during the war
made matters much worse —so much so that the two coun-
tries did not even establish diplomatic ties until 1965. At that
time, Koreans whose allegiance was to Seoul were permitted to
hold South Korean passports and given special-resident status.
Even so, the insular Japanese still look at the Koreans as a
people apart.
While their numbers are still few, some Koreans do choose to
become naturalized citizens of Japan: 5,532 did so last year.
Nearly 80 percent of the children of Korean residents now
attend Japanese public schools, and an estimated 60 percent of
Koreans marry Japanese. Still, the barriers remain. “There is a
burden of 35 years of prejudice and ill will that has yet to be
cleared away,” says Mindan’s Choo. “If it did finally end, we
would all become Japanese citizens on the spot. But there is this
wall that will not go away.” It will take more than vague
promises by the Japanese government to remove that wall and
give the Koreans full participation in Japanese society.

still-unofficial contacts with the Pyongyang
regime. But the Japanese prime minister
also took the occasion to discuss what he
called the importance of trying to “move
North Korea from its position of isola-
tion” —an admonition that his Korean
counterpart met with silence.
The second round of talks was originally
scheduled to be a discussion of purely bi-
lateral issues. But in a move that seemed to
catch his Japanese hosts off guard, Chun
suggested that such matters be delegated to
working-level officials. For his part, Naka-
sone offered a seemingly innocent diplomat-
ic nicety, promising Japan’s cooperation in
helping to ensure the success of the 1986
Asian Games and the 1988 Summer Olym-
pics, both to be held in Seoul. But Naka-
sone’s comment was more than just a polite
remark. Chun’s government sees the Games
as an important leg up in its bitter rivalry
with North Korea for international recogni-
tion. But it also fears the possibility of yet
another ideologically based boycott by
Pyongyang’s communist allies. And Chun
was clearly pleased by Nakasone’s sugges-
tion that Tokyo could use its influence in
Peking and Moscow to run interference.
Reunification: At the final dinner of the
summit conference, a meal given by the
Koreans at the Akasaka Palace, Chun
touched off a brief flurry of excitement when
he brought up what may well be the most
difficult issue of all: Korean reunification.
Chun repeated his standing offer to meet
face to face with North Korean President
Kim II Sung, but then offered the tantalizing
suggestion that Tokyo might be a possible
venue for such talks. Pyongyang has repeat-
edly rejected such proposals; it wants three-
party discussions that would also include the
United States. Japan, which has publicly
supported Seoul’s position in the
past, would undoubtedly be will-
ing to make its services available as
a host for reunification talks. Even
so, Japanese officials last week
were quick to point out that the
chances for such a meeting are re-
mote, in Tokyo or anywhere else.
Despite their obvious interest
in closer relations between two
important American allies, U.S.
diplomats maintained a studiedly
low profile throughout Chun’s
time in Japan. In Washington the
most notable reaction was simple
relief that the trip had gone off
without any provocations or
problems. Even the lingering
questions left by Hirohito’s ob-
lique apology were viewed as only
a minor, and predictable, glitch.
“People in Korea will carp about
it,” said one U.S. official, “but
basically the issue is now closed.”
But as all involved were painful-
ly aware, many pressing problems
between Tokyo and Seoul re-
Students in Seoul were forced to bow to a Japanese shrine in the 1930s: Many are still angry
mained to be solved. Even when it came to
the simplest of these, the murky legal status
of Koreans living in Japan, last week’s talks
went virtually nowhere. Korean officials
repeated Seoul’s longstanding demand that
Tokyo abolish compulsory fingerprinting
for resident Koreans, many of whom have
lived in Japan for generations. The Japanese
reply, rooted in centuries of deeply ingrained
insularity, was the same as always: nothing
could be done as long as fingerprints were
needed to keep track of foreigners living in
their country.
There were also snags when it came to
higher-stakes issues such as trade and the
transfer of advanced industrial technology.
Meeting Nakasone: Difficult issues to talk about
The two leaders, as expected, expressed their
interest in reaching an agreement to increase
scientific cooperation. They also pledged to
provide more support for bilateral cultural
exchanges. But Seoul’s efforts to right the
massive trade imbalance between the two
nations by means of tariff reforms and more
Japanese purchases of Korean manufac-
tured goods were met only with bland assur-
ances. Tokyo officials contend that Seoul’s
deficit will right itself when Korean industry
becomes more competitive. Seoul’s de-
mands for higher levels of technology trans-
fer got a similar hands-off response. Japa-
nese officials insisted that the matter was
best left to individual companies rather than
governments. That is hardly an
encouraging suggestion given the
growing reluctance of Japanese ex-
ecutives to allow potential Korean
competitors into their lucrative
high-tech markets.
But for the moment, the sheer
symbolism of Chun’s visit may
have been enough. “The visit [was]
not expected to producemiracles,”
said one senior Japanese official
last week, “but to improve the
emotional content of our relation-
ship.” How important that will be
to the future cannot yet be judged.
On his return to Seoul, Chun
echoed one of the week’s dominant
themes, hailing what he called “a
new era of friendship and coopera-
tion. ” If that partnership is to pros-
per, both sides will have to back up
their hands-across-the-watersum-
mit with a greater willingness to
meet each other halfway.

EUROPE
A Shake-up in the Kremlin
As Chernenko reappears, a high-ranking Soviet general abruptly loses his job.
The mystery had built up slowly since
midsummer, and it contained all the
familiar ingredients: an absent leader, ru-
mors of ill health, speculation about who
was in charge at the Kremlin. Soviet Presi-
dent Konstantin Chernenko tried to clear
up almost everything last week. He shuffled
into an ornate reception hall, awarded the
Order of Lenin to three cosmonauts and
wheezed his way through a five-minute
speech without coming conspicuously a
cropper. But the next day, the Soviet leader-
ship was enveloped in a new and bigger
mystery. Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, chief of
staff of the armed forces, was
unceremoniously fired.
No reason was given for the
sudden and stunning dismiss-
al, but the purge of Ogarkov
may have been a sign that a
power struggle was intensify-
ing inside the Kremlin. The
main issue, presumably, was
the eventual succession to
Chernenko himself; the scuf-
fling probably began last Feb-
ruary, when Chernenko was
selected to succeed the late
Yuri Andropov. Ogarkov’s
downfall could mean that the
power struggle was further
along than anyone who is not
privy to Politburo secrets had
suspected. But as usual, out-
siders had no way of knowing
how the political battle was
being fought, or who was win-
ning or when it might end.
Honor: To all appearances,
Ogarkov had been cut down in
his prime. He is only 66 —
young for a top Soviet offi-
cial—and since 1977, he has
been a forceful and unusually
visible chief of staff. When a
Soviet fighter plane shot down
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 a
year ago, it was Ogarkov who
went before the foreign press to
defend his country’s military
honor, insisting that the air-
liner had been on a spy mission
for the United States. When the
Soviets walked out of the arms-
control negotiations in Geneva
last fall, Ogarkov faced the
press to justify the action. Even
those who did not accept his
rationalizations gave the
stocky marshal credit for pos-
sessing a cool, quick intellect.
Thus it was a shock when the evening
news program “Vremya” announced blunt-
ly that Ogarkov had been “relieved of his
duties as chief of the General Staff of the
Soviet Armed Forces and first deputy de-
fense minister of the U.S.S.R. in connection
with his transfer to other work.” There was
little doubt that Ogarkov had been sacked.
No details of his “other work” were includ-
ed in the original announcement, as they
would have been in the case of a promotion.
Ogarkov was not thanked for his service to
the state, as is usually the case when a Soviet
official leaves his post voluntarily. The mili-
Chernenko at a reception for the cosmonauts: Uncertain health
UPI
tary newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda devoted
its headline and a photograph to Ogarkov’s
successor, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, 61;
it did not mention Ogarkov himself until the
last sentence of the article. As a marshal and
a member of the Communist Party’s Cen-
tral Committee, Ogarkov is likely to receive
a new assignment of some kind, but in his
case, “other work” seems to be a euphe-
mism for political oblivion.
Akhromeyev’s appointment was the only
aspect of the affair that did not surprise
foreign military attaches in Moscow. Ogar-
kov’s principal deputy in recent years and
an authority on arms control,
he had been a rising star in the
Soviet military establishment.
Some analysts counted him as a
friend and protege of Ogarkov;
in any case, he seemed to be cut
from the same cloth. In Wash-
ington, one U.S. official de-
scribed Akhromeyev as “a
clone” of Ogarkov, adding:
“What we’re seeing is a lock-
step promotion of another very
able, sophisticated Soviet mili-
tary man.” But Akhromeyev’s
impressive credentials did not
explain the ouster of his boss.
In the Soviet system, older in-
cumbents rarely lose their jobs
to bright young men —at least,
not on merit alone.
Final Price: In the absence of
public facts, there was no
shortage of theories to explain
Ogarkov’s dismissal. A sudden
health problem was one of the
explanations put forward, but
that seemed to be ruled out by
the humiliating manner in
which Ogarkov was relieved.
One military attache suggested
that the chief of staff had paid
the final price for Moscow’s
embarrassment over the KAL
affair. But a year seemed like a
long time to wait for retribu-
tion, in the unlikely event that
Ogarkov had taken the blame.
And if his dismissal had any-
thing at all to do with the KAL
affair, Ogarkov probably
would not have been dumped
at a time when people all over
the world were still observing
the first anniversary of the
atrocity.
There was always the possi-
bility that Ogarkov had fallen

Akhromeyev, Ogarkov confronting the press after the downing of Flight 007: Two military men cut from the same piece of cloth
because of a disagreement over policy. One
U.S. analyst recalled “the party’s great
sensitivity to the issue of military subordi-
nation” and suggested that Ogarkov’s dis-
missal might have been part of a civilian
effort to keep the military in line. The trou-
ble with that hypothesis was that Ogarkov
had his differences with the civilian leader-
ship before and had managed to smooth
them over. In 1979 he wrote an article in
which he seemed to suggest that the Soviet
Union could survive and win a nuclear war.
He was slapped down by Defense Minister
Dmitry Ustinov —a party man, despite his
marshal’s rank —and by President Leonid
Brezhnev, who declared that such thinking
was “madness.” Ogarkov quickly toed the
line, and it was difficult to imagine a current
policy dispute any more fundamental than
the one he had already survived.
So far, the most plausible explanation for
the purge of Ogarkov was the theory that he
had been caught on the weaker side of a
political struggle within the Soviet leader-
ship. If so, Chernenko may not have played
a major role in the dismissal; the Soviet
president himself had dropped out of sight
for 53 days. It was likely, however, that
Ustinov had been deeply involved; a chief of
staff could hardly be fired over the objec-
tions of his powerful boss.
Theory: Ogarkov may have been hit in the
cross fire between two upwardly mobile,
and relatively young, Politburo members:
Grigory Romanov, 61, and Mikhail Gorba-
chov, 53. Romanov is the Central Commit-
tee secretary in charge of the military-in-
dustrial complex, and he is thought to have
close ties to the officer corps, including
Ogarkov. Gorbachov seems, for the mo-
ment, to have an edge on his rival in the
maneuvering to succeed Chernenko. Last
week Gorbachov had another advantage:
Romanov was away on official business—in
Ethiopia. The theory circulating in Moscow
was that Gorbachov, backed by Defense
Gromyko (center) flanked by Ustinov and Chernenko: Some intriguing signals
Minister Ustinov, had taken the opportuni-
ty to fire the chief of staff, thus depriving
Romanov of a valuable ally.
The most intriguing signal of Gorba-
chov’s rise came after Soviet Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid Kostandov died on a visit
to East Germany. Kostandov was given a
state funeral and buried in the Kremlin
wall, an honor usually accorded only to
Politburo members. The point of the exer-
cise may have become apparent the next day
when Soviet newspapers published a picture
of the funeral honor guard. Gorbachov was
in the most prominent position, followed by
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Us-
tinov and Moscow party leader Viktor Gri-
shin. Though he had appeared on television
the day before, Chernenko was absent.
The real significance of Ogarkov’s ouster
may not be known until the struggle to
succeed Chernenko has played itself out.
Viewed from afar, the Soviet president, who
turns 73 this month, seemed reasonably fit.
He reappeared in a carefully controlled
setting—before an invited audience at a re-
ception that was videotaped for Soviet tele-
vision. Chernenko looked ruddy, like a man
who had been on vacation, but thinner
around the jowls, like a man who had been
ill. On the whole, he seemed a bit steadier
than he had been last spring. He managed to
stand and read a five-minute speech without
losing his place or gasping loudly for breath,
as he had done in the past.
Test: His speech was vaguely conciliatory
toward the United States. Chernenko repeat-
ed the Soviet offer to negotiate a treaty ban-
ning weapons from space. “We would hope
that the United States in the final analysis
will display political farsightedness and see
the worth of the constructive approach of the
Soviet Union,” he said. “An agreement
might in some measure bring to Soviet-
American relations some missing elements
of mutual trust.” The Reagan administra-
tion will test Soviet intentions later this
month, when Secretary of State George


Shultz meets with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko in New York dur-
ing the fall session of the
United Nations General As-
sembly. That will be the first
such high-level contact since
last January, and if the talks
go well, the American side is
eager to arrange a follow-up
meeting between Gromyko
and Ronald Reagan.
It seemed unlikely, how-
ever, that Chernenko was
sending any important dip-
Gorbachov: Getting an edge?
lomatic signals last week.
His return to public view
was tentative at best, and it
didn’t prove much. “I think
that there is still a wide-
spread perception that he is
not commanding the Polit-
buro, that power is divided
into relatively independent
fiefdoms,” a U.S. diplomat
in Moscow said after Cher-
nenko had put in his
appearance.
The uncertain state of
Chernenko’s physical and
political health may have encouraged the
princes of the Politburo to pursue their own
objectives more vigorously. A man of Ogar-
kov’s stature probably could not have been
removed from office unless a power struggle
had progressed beyond the preliminary ma-
neuvers. If the infighting has indeed accel-
erated, there may soon be other casualties.
And at a time when Moscow already has
withdrawn somewhat from world events, it
is likely that Soviet leaders will be more
preoccupied than ever with their own by-
zantine affairs.
RUSSELL WATSON with ROBERT B. CULLEN
in Moscow and ZOFIA SMARDZ in Washington
An Economic Debate
A new round of political squabbling is the last thing Konstan-
tin Chernenko needs if he is to cope with the Kremlin’s major
domestic problem —the economy. Soviet industrial growth is
running at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, but serious defects lurk
just below the surface. Traditionally, Moscow has achieved
economic growth by voraciously exploiting the country’s vast
natural resources and throwing hordes of laborers into grandi-
ose projects. But the nation’s birthrate has been dropping for
years, and labor is becoming scarce. New deposits of oil, coal and
metal ore are locked away deep under the Siberian ice, where
they will be expensive to tap.
To continue to grow, the economy has to become more
efficient —a tall order for the lead-footed Soviet system. A
debate on how to spur productivity has been bubbling in the
Soviet press —and it indicates that Chernenko and his Politburo
are getting advice from two conflicting factions. One group calls
for decentralization at the expense of the government ministries
that run the economy; a second faction favors modernizing the
economy from above.
The intellectual champion of the first faction is Abel Agan-
byegyan, director of the Institute of Economics and Industrial
Organization in Novosibirsk. He advocates getting the minis-
tries off the backs of producers —a radical notion in a country
where all factories are subsidiaries of “ U.S.S.R., Inc.” “A
[government] ministry should have
no right to interfere in the activity of
an enterprise,” he recently wrote in
the Soviet newspaper Trud.
Profit Incentive: Aganbyegyan
proposes that enterprises sign con-
tracts to deliver certain quantities of
goods, and then decide on their own
just how to produce them. Wages for
both managers and workers would be
based strictly on how effectively the
plant worked. That sounds suspi-
ciously like the profit incentive, al-
though Aganbyegyan shies away
from calling it that. The payoff, he
predicts, would be an end to the
chronic featherbedding that is a ma-
jor cause of the labor shortage in the
Soviet Union.
Similar reforms in the agricultural
sector were credited for the rebound
in the 1983 Soviet grain harvest after
two disastrous years, though good
weather may have accounted for
most of the increase. Whatever the
case, the Soviets have had no such luck this year: a dry summer
followed by an early cold snap has already dimmed the projected
harvest totals. In fact, according to estimates from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, the Soviet grain crop for this year
could be as low as 180 million tons, 25 percent below Moscow’s
official target —forcing the Soviet Union to depend even more
heavily on American grain imports.
A second economic faction favors an approach that is vastly
different from Aganbyegyan’s. An article in Pravda outlined the
strategy last week. The idea is to send out government inspectors
to certify that the country’s shops and factories were using the
most up-to-date methods and equipment. Where necessary, the
inspectors would prescribe new technology, such as industrial
robots. Not surprisingly, the Pravda piece was written by a
member of the Moscow bureaucracy—a group whose power
would be enhanced by such a plan.
When the Central Committee meets this autumn to approve
the 1985 economic plan, it will probably carve out a cautious
middle ground. During his long political career, Chernenko has
displayed little zeal for innovation. Even if he were inclined
toward drastic changes, he would not have the power to impose
them on a hidebound system. So his main advantage now is
rather ambiguous: economic growth, almost negligible two
years ago, is perking along at a level that will probably be just
good enough for him to imitate Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri
Andropov—and to leave-tough reforms to his successor.

Harvesting the wheat crop: Conflicting proposals for improving productivity


Toeing Moscow’s Line
Honecker (left) at the Leipzig Trade Fair: A snub to the Bonn government
z
o
<
By SCOTT SULLIVAN
European Regional Editor
Erich Honecker stopped by the West
German pavilion at the Leipzig Trade
Fair last week—but he was no longer in a
marketing mood. The East German leader
declined to tour the exhibit. Nodding po-
litely at a West German official’s expressed
hope that 1984 would be a good year, he
stayed for only two minutes and left with-
out a word. But at the Soviet pavilion, he
suddenly became effusive, embracing Rus-
sian generals and toasting East Germany’s
“forever indestructible alliance with the
Soviet Union.”
Startled by the snub, West Germany
asked whether Honecker still meant to keep
his date with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
Bonn on Sept. 26. In reply, Ewald Moldt,
East Berlin’s envoy, said the debate in the
federal republic over Honecker’s visit had
become “extremely unseemly [and] abso-
lutely unheard-of in relations between
sovereign states”—and he announced that
the date was “no longer realistic.”
From the Kremlin’s vantage point, the
visit had never been realistic. For months
Moscow had waged a propaganda campaign
against “revanchist” West Germany—no
fit place for an East German comrade to
hang out. But the East Germans stressed
that they had postponed—not canceled —
the visit. And the two Germanys’ shared
interest in improving relations suggested
that they would try again. Indeed, no matter
what the outcome of the power struggle that
appeared tobe under way in the Kremlin, the
Soviet leadership faces the prospect of in-
creasingly difficult and ambiguous relations
with its East European allies.
To be sure, Moscow had made its point by
brutally forcing Honecker to postpone his
visit. The crusty old men in the Kremlin
amply demonstrated that they remain the
masters in their East European empire.
When they say “nyet, ” they mean
“nyet, ” and they can make it stick. Their
heavy-handed intervention will no
doubt intimidate Honecker and other
Soviet clients. It will slow down efforts
by East Germany and other Warsaw
Pact countries to cut independent deals
with the West. But it will not eliminate
the underlying malaise that fuels those
East-West efforts.
From the Soviet perspective, the situa-
tion in the East bloc is as uncomfortable
as it has been in 40 years. Romanian
leader Nicolae Ceausescu openly dis-
sents from Moscow’s foreign-policy line.
Hungary is quietly but constantly enlarg-
ing the free-market sector of its economy.
while claiming the right to an independ-
ent role for “small countries.” In Poland
the government of Gen. Wojciech Jaru-
zelski has plainly failed to establish its
legitimacy. Czechoslovakia toes the
Moscow line but grumbles when the
Soviets deploy new nuclear missiles on its
territory. Even Bulgaria, the model satel-
lite, is pressing for joint ventures with
Western firms. Throughout Eastern Eu-
rope, the Chernenko regime is derided as
weak, unimaginative and incapable of
dealing with its allies’ severe economic
problems.
Tough: There are, of course, no signs of
open revolt or imminent disintegration in
the Warsaw Pact. The crisis atmosphere
that surrounded the Hungarian revolt in
1956, the “Prague spring” in 1968 and
the rise of Solidarity in Poland in the early
1980 s is absent. All the European satellites
are ruled by tough, experienced leaders who
remain entirely loyal to Moscow, out of
ideological conviction, or opportunism, or
both. The Soviets’ ultimate authority re-
mains unquestioned. Indeed, what the Sovi-
ets proved by blocking the Honecker trip
was a point that no one in the East bloc had
ever questioned. Rather, it is the wisdom and
effectiveness of Soviet policy that is coming
into question. Like America’s Western al-
lies, the Soviet satellites increasingly argue
that they should make national policy in
their own national interests.
Cold: These claims have been sharpened
by the economic and political developments
of the 1980 s. Protected for a number of years
from the full force of rising oil prices and
world recession, the Eastern European
countries have finally had to face the realities
of stagflation, spiraling debts and obsoles-
cent industries. Whether the Soviets like it or
not, every East European country is now
looking to the West both for indispensable
technology and hard-currency markets. At
the same time, even the most committed
communist leaders in Eastern Europe re-
gard the glacial relations between Washing-
ton and Moscow with horror. Their deepest
wish is to “isolate” their own dealings with
Western Europe from the gathering cold
war between the superpowers in order to
continue reaping the fruits of detente.
Among Western Europeans, the recent
East-bloc developments have produced
considerable interest. West Germans see
Warsaw Pact troops: No signs of open revolt


the possibility of improving the lot of their
cousins on the other side of the wall. The
French have always maintained that the
medium-size powers in Europe should
stand up against the giants to the East and
West. They are delighted now to hear such
prestigious figures as the Hungarian foreign
minister saying the same thing. Down the
road a way, many Western Europeans—
especially on the left —foresee a situation in
which a community of economic and cul-
tural interests would grow up with Western
Europe and gradually undermine both
NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Intimidation: Theoretically, the Soviets
could satisfy their allies’ aspirations and
stifle their stirrings toward independence
by offering a better economic deal: low oil
and gas prices and a guaranteed preferential
market for Comecon goods. But Moscow is
in no position to do any such thing. On the
contrary, it has recently been increasing
energy prices and tightening up the terms of
trade. The Russians could also calm East
European concerns about a growing cold
war by resuming disarmament talks with
the United States. But the current Soviet
leadership is clearly determined to continue
the freeze. Their options are reduced to the
exercise of direct intimidation and the open
assertion of force. But while that technique
may work in the short run, it does not touch
upon the deeper problems of the East bloc.
Warsaw Pact leaders will go on seeking
direct deals with the Western Europeans,
and the French, the West Germans and
others will be eager to accommodate them.
For the moment, the newfound independ-
ence of the Eastern-bloc states may be seen
primarily as an annoyance to the Russians.
But it could also be a problem for the United
States. It will tend to reinforce the pacifist
movements in northern Europe. It could, in
the long run, undercut Western unity on a
whole range of European security deals. It
has already revived the notion of reunifying
the two Germanys—a prospect that neither
the Soviets nor the Americans can view with
much equanimity.
The fluid new situation forces the Unit-
ed States to confront some tough policy
choices in its relations with Eastern Eu-
rope. In 1976 Helmut Sonnenfeldt, then
Henry Kissinger’s chief adviser on East-
West affairs, warhed that the United States
should never encourage independence
movements in the Eastern bloc because,
ultimately, it had no way of supporting the
people it was encouraging. The “Sonnen-
feldt doctrine” remains as valid today as it
was nearly a decade ago. It is still in the
American interest to build bridges to the
subject nations of Eastern Europe. But it is
in no one’s interest to bring Moscow’s
wrath down on them. A principal object of
American policy in the short run should be
to ensure that the malaise in the East bloc
remains—as it clearly is now—Moscow’s
problem, not Washington’s.
FRANCE
Mitterrand’s Mystery Tour
Ifrane Palace, the summer residence of
Morocco’s King Hassan 11, is knqwn for
its regal golf course. When a French golfer
named Frangois Mitterrand showed up se-
cretly late last month, the Moroccans made
the announcement. Paris’s spokesman, Ro-
land Dumas, could only say lamely, “The
president is ... on a private visit.” French
newspapers quickly ridiculed the notion of a
long holiday. Said the tabloid Le Matin,
“No Frenchman believes Frangois Mitter-
rand went to Morocco like you or I would
go with the Club Mediterranee.” And by
last week, the truth had filtered out: Mitter-
rand was in Morocco to talk with King
Hassan about a new effort to end the desert
war in Chad.
Paris believes that Hassan can be a
helpful partner in attempts to work out a
withdrawal of Libyan—and French —
troops from Chad. Hassan signed a “union
of states” treaty last month with Libya’s
ruler, Col. Muammar Kaddafi, and the
French believe that Hassan can now be a
moderating influence with Kaddafi. Mo-
rocco could also be useful in
policing a Chad peace accord,
either by supplying troops to a
peacekeeping force or by pro-
viding facilities for French re-
connaissance planes guarding
against further Libyan infiltra-
tions. So far, however, Kaddafi
remains publicly hostile to
France. In his latest speech, he
recalled France’s debacle in
Vietnam and warned that
Arabs “will give France an
even bigger lesson than Dien
Bien Phu.”
Still, France is determined to
Mitterrand: Secret
BRUCE HOERTEL
grab what it sees as a diplomatic opportuni-
ty. Kaddafi’s union with Morocco —his sev-
enth attempt at a political liason with an-
other Arab nation after six failures —is
universally expected to fizzle. But until it
does, there is a potential trade-off: Kaddafi
stops supplying the Polisario guerrillas in
the Sahara war against Morocco and Has-
san helps Kaddafi achieve a face-saving set-
tlement of the long stalemated war in Chad.
Mitterrand visited Hassan at the risk of
souring ties with Algeria, Morocco’s re-
gional rival. A former French ambassador
to Libya, Guy Georgy, was sent to Tripoli
last week for direct talks on Chad with
Kaddafi’s deputy, Maj. Abdel Salam Jal-
lud. Hassan was expected to travel to Trip-
oli soon for talks with Kaddafi in an attempt
to reinforce the French peace initiative.
Time: Bargaining will be long and hard.
One problem is that to go home Libyan
troops need only cross the Chad border
while French forces must leave Africa.
Some peacekeeping machinery will
be needed to discourage Kaddafi from
ordering Libyan troops back
into Chad yet again. Time will
also be needed for a political
reconciliation between Hissene
Habre, the Chad leader, and
various opposition forces. In
the understatement of the
week, French Prime Minister
Laurent Fabius warned that
“nothing spectacular is expect-
ed” from Mitterrand’s trek
down the road to Morocco. But
at least the search for peace
in Chad was taking a step
forward.

Brian Mulroney’s
Tory Landslide
The outsiders of Canada’s Progressive Conservative
Party leave the once unbeatable Liberals in ruins.
The winner and his wife, Mila, on election night: A natural talent for conciliation
M. PONOMAREFF —PHOTOREPORTERS
The little city of Baie Comeau had never
seen anything like it. The hockey rink
was packed with revelers until the small
hours of the morning, and there were so
many journalists on hand that the towns-
people had to put them up in spare rooms
and basements. Baie Comeau, a remote in-
dustrial enclave carved out of the endless
pine forest on the north shore of the St.
Lawrence River, was about to send one of its
sons off to become prime minister of Can-
ada. Over and over, a brass band played his
campaign song: “£a va changer!” In fact,
the election of a bilingual Irishman named
Brian Mulroney amounted to more than
just a change; by Canada’s well-mannered
standards, it was a revolution.
With a landslide victory, Mulroney’s
Progressive Conservative Party swept into
power a coalition of outsiders who were
united mostly by their resentment of the
Liberal Party, which has governed Canada
for 42 of the past 50 years. The Tories won
211 of the 282 seats in the House of Com-
mons and a stunning 50 percent of the popu-
lar vote in a three-party race. The Liberals,
the party of Pierre Trudeau, were left in
ruins; they won only 40 seats, 10 more than
the perennial third-place finisher, the New
Democratic Party. The Tories’ triumph
was so complete that some Canadians ex-
pected them to remain the dominant party
for the rest of the century.
Top Priority: The outcome was good news
for the Reagan administration. Mulroney’s
government will be probusiness and pro-
American. In an interview with News-
week (box), the prime minister-elect said he
would invite President Ronald Reagan to
make an informal visit to Canada, and he
declared that his top priority was “to refur-
bish the relationship of trust that must exist
with our greatest friend, neighbor and ally,
the United States of America.” But Canada
was swinging only slightly to the right. Al-
though Mulroney’s faith in private enter-
prise makes him sound like a Reaganite, on
most issues he is a conservative in little more
than name. The Tory party as a whole is far
closer to Walter Mondale than it is to Rea-
gan, and where it differs with Mondale, it
generally stands to his left, not to his right.
The Conservatives won votes the old-
fashioned way: they made promises. Mul-
roney toured the country offering a share of
power to those who felt disenfranchised and
promising $3.8 billion worth of new govern-
ment programs to everyone who felt neg-
lected.* Paying for all of that won’t be easy.
Despite a worldwide upturn, Canada’s
economy is still in the doldrums. Unem-
ployment hovers at more than 11 percent,
interest rates are painfully high and infla-
tion continues to run at 4 to 5 percent a
year. The Canadian dollar is worth about 77
cents in U.S. currency, compared to $ 1.03 in
1976, and the budget deficit of about $3O
billion is half again as big as Reagan’s defi-
cit, on a per capita basis.
The Tories offered no specific plans for

Supporters celebrating as the returns come in: A sweeping political victory earned the old-fashioned way —by making promises
M. PONOMAREFF—PHOTOREPORTERS
curing the economy. They won the election
because they are not responsible for the
mess —and because Brian Mulroney is not
Pierre Trudeau. Although Trudeau retired
last June after 15 years as prime minister,
many Canadians still resented his long grip
on power, his supreme self-assurance and
his endless feuds with Canada’s powerful
provincial governments. Where Trudeau
was rough, Mulroney is smooth. Growing
up Irish in Quebec, he learned tolerance
along with his perfect French. As a labor
lawyer in Montreal, and then as president of
an iron-ore company, he displayed a talent
for negotiation. “That’s his great strength,”
says Michael Meighen, a Toronto attorney
who has known Mulroney since they were
law-school classmates. “He spreads a great
blanket of conciliation over everything.”
Bum Rap: As he ran for office, Mulro-
ney’s opponents gave him unwitting assist-
ance. Trudeau’s successor, Prime Minister
John Turner, ran a clumsy campaign. He
called an early election for which he was
utterly unprepared. When the date was set
back in June, the Conservatives had 210
candidates ready to run, while the Liberals
had only 40. Turner hurt himself by meekly
agreeing to 17 lucrative appointments with
which Trudeau had rewarded his most loyal
aides just before leaving office. There was
also a flurry of unfavorable press when
Turner was caught greeting Liberal Party
president lona Campagnolo with a gentle
pat on the backside during a political rally.
In contrast, Mulroney’s campaign ran
like clockwork. He benefited from the
charm and campaigning skill of his wife,
Mila, 31, the mother of his three children.
The bilingual Mulroney also won over
French Canadians in droves, with the result
that he conquered the Liberal citadel of
Quebec. Before the election, the Conserva-
tives held only one of Quebec’s 75 seats in
the House of Commons; when Parliament
convenes next month, they will occupy 58 of
Quebec’s seats.
Turner’s debacle is likely to drive the
Liberal Party to the left. Even before Elec-
tion Day, some party leaders were openly
blaming Turner for the impending defeat
and complaining that his conservative tend-
encies had allowed Mulroney to out-liberal
the Liberals. Quebec’s Jean Chretien and
other survivors of the disaster will push for a
return to Trudeau’s brand of Keynesian
economics—and perhaps to some America-
bashing, as well.
For Mulroney, as for many successful
politicians, governing may turn out to be a
lot more difficult than campaigning. Cana-
dians enjoy a web of social programs that
would give Reaganites apoplexy. The prin-
ciple of “universality”—government bene-
Turner in defeat: A clumsy campaign
ANDY CLARK— UPC
fits for all, regardless of income—is sacred
in Canada, and most Canadians are devout
believers in big government. The state pro-
vides one-third of Canada’s jobs and ac-
counts for the same portion of its gross
national product. Many Canadians believe
that their country has suffered lately not
because government has grown too fat, but
because Trudeau was a poor administrator.
But some economists insist that Canada’s
robust growth after World War II was
fueled by circumstances that may never
arise again. “We rode a wave of negative
interest rates and high commodity prices,”
says William Mackness, vice president and
chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia
in Toronto. He and other analysts believe
that, with a budget deficit equal to about
one-fourth of GNP, Canada may be only
two or three years away from a full-blown
financial crisis. “In the second year of a
recovery, the Canadian government is
spending 50 percent more than it is taking
in,” says Mackness. “It’s a mathematical
certainty that we’ll hit the wall. There’s no
way we can get through the next recession
without a fiscal crisis if we stay on the course
we’re on. Draconian measures are needed.”
No Barriers: Mulroney hopes for eco-
nomic help from the United States; he ex-
pects that the Reagan administration will
exempt Canada from any new barriers
against imports of steel. He also will mend
fences with the Americans and strengthen
Canada’s profile within NATO by improv-
ing the pathetic state of the country’s armed
forces. Mulroney’s military buildup will be
extremely modest, by Reagan’s standards:
2,200 new recruits and an additional $146
million for the defense budget—some of the
money will be used to buy new uniforms.
But with barely 83,000 men and women in
Canada’s armed forces at present, almost
anything would be an improvement.
Mulroney also proposes to put an end to

the regional squabbling that has hamstrung
the country in recent years. But exactly
how he will put Canada together again is
another of those subjects that never became
clear during the campaign. Instead, Mul-
roney made some promises that could prove
to be divisive; for example, he won political
support from Quebec separatists by promis-
ing to negotiate the troublesome question
of whether the French-speaking province
should have the power to veto amendments
to the Canadian Constitution.
Mulroney is eager to get to work on the
task of reversing Canada’s fortunes. He is
expected to take office next week. One of his
first decisions will be whether to go ahead
with a 1 percentange point increase in the
federal sales tax that was proposed by the
Liberals and scheduled to take effect on
Oct. 1; aides say that Mulroney will prob-
ably implement the increase. They also pre-
dict that he will shake the entrenched bu-
reaucracy to its roots by firing the heads of
some government-owned businesses and
perhaps by putting some of the enterprises,
such as Air Canada, up for sale. But if he is
to succeed, Mulroney may have to do some-
thing that is contrary to his own nature and
to the strategy that brought him to power.
He may have to take unpopular measures —
and tell Canadians that they can no longer
live in the style to which they have become
accustomed.
JOHN WALCOTT in Canada
‘The Answer Is in a Bigger Pie’
The day after his landslide victory,
Brian Mulroney flew to Ottawa from his
birthplace, Baie Comeau, Que. Aboard his
chartered Boeing 727, he granted a private
interview to Newsweek’s John Walcott.
Excerpts from their conversation:
WALCOTT: You grew up in a town in
which American investment was very im-
portant. How has that shaped your view of
the relationship between Canada and the
United States?
MULRONEY: I don’t think my view is
different from the majority of
Canadians’ views. I have said right
from the beginning that if I were
chosen leader, my first obliga-
tion would be to refurbish the rela-
tionship of trust that must exist
with our greatest friend, neighbor
and ally, the United States of
America. Period.
This doesn’t imply any subser-
vience. This doesn’t diminish
our national integrity. And this
doesn’t diminish the obligation of
the United States to be no less
conscious of the value of that bi-
lateral relationship.
Sniping and snarling at the
United States is fashionable in
some quarters in Canada. Fortu-
nately, those quarters . . . don’t
exist in the Conservative Party,
and they don’t exist with me.
Now, we just came from Baie
Comeau, my hometown, and
there are three main industries
there. One is the Quebec North Shore
Paper Co., which was built by the Chica-
go Tribune. Another is Canadian Reyn-
olds Metals. And the other is Cargill
Grain. It is a prosperous town. That pros-
perity, in large measure, has been induced
by the investment of foreign capital. Now
what, may I ask, is wrong with that? . . .
[The] fact of the matter is that there is not
enough money in this country to create
the 2 million [new] jobs we need. I want to
send out a signal around the world that
this is a good and an honorable place to do
business.
Q. There is a host of other problems
that need to be resolved by the United
States and Canada, including trade dif-
ferences and acid rain. How will you
tackle them?.
A. At the highest levels. I hope to accel-
erate the quarterly meetings between
cabinet officers of the two countries. I
don’t think that when the prime minister
of Canada sees the president of the United
States it has to be a state occasion. This is
not some guy riding in from outer space,
right? This is a neighbor.
With Reagan in Washington: Good-neighbor policies
JOHN FICARA— Newsweek
Q. Will Canada continue to permit the
United States to test cruise missiles over
Canadian territory?
A. Yes.
Q. What about Canada’s commitment
to NATO?
A. It will be enhanced.
Q. Do you intend to invite President
Reagan to come to Canada for an infor-
mal visit?
A. I would think so. A number of the
president’s top aides —Donald Regan,
George Shultz, Mac Baldrige, Jim Ba-
ker —have a great understanding of Can-
ada. I can tell you that in my meeting with
the president in June, I was genuinely
impressed with the breadth and the inti-
macy of his knowledge of Canadian
problems.
Q. With a budget deficit in the neigh-
borhood of $3O billion, why did you
promise even another nickel’s worth of
new government programs during your
campaign?
A. You’ re not serious?
Q. Yes, I am. There are some Canadian
economists who warn that the
country can’t remain on its present
course for more than two or three
more years without a serious fis-
cal crisis.
A. That’s why the economists
don’t run Canada. This country is
operating at 60 percent of its ca-
pacity. What is wrong with a $3O
billion deficit is that we don’t have
economic growth, so a combina-
tion of prudent management at the
top and a re-energized industrial
base in this country is going to
pay down that debt in a reason-
able time.
Look at it this way. If we lower
our unemployment rate by 1 [per-
centage point], first of all our
payout in unemployment insur-
ance would be $1 billion less be-
cause we’d put 125,000 or 130,000
people back to work. They gener-
ate $3 billion in new income, a
third of which goes back into the
Treasury, so we’re up $2 billion. We’ve
saved a billion, and we’ve got a billion
coming in. There’s the answer; the answer
is in a bigger pie. Now there are structural
deficiencies that we’ve allowed to grow
over the years, and [difficulties with] pro-
ductivity and labor relations. . . . These
are all made-in-Canada problems, so the
solutions can be made in Canada as well.
So while I’m realistic about the difficul-
ties that lie ahead, I’m an optimist. This is
an extraordinary country with remarka-
ble potential, but it has to be properly
directed and properly managed.

Bloody Return to Sharpeville
A township in flames: No one believes that Botha’s reforms can prevent more violence
RAND DAILY MAIL— UPI
The prime minister advertised it as a
great day for South African democra-
cy. But when Pieter Botha inaugurated a
new Constitution granting limited represen-
tation to the country’s Colored and Indian
population last week, South Africa’s black
majority attacked it as a sham. In the black
townships outside Johannesburg, hundreds
of protesters took to the streets, looting
stores and firebombing beer halls and ga-
rages, perceived as symbols of white owner-
ship. Police moved in with tear gas and
rubber bullets, resulting in dozens of bloody
clashes. In Sharpeville, the scene of the heav-
iest fighting, rioters went after the town-
ship’s black deputy mayor, Sam Dlamini. As
his family looked on, they hacked Dlamini to
death on the veranda of his home. Then they
built a pyre of floorboards and window shut-
ters and set his corpse on fire.
The violence raged, then subsided, then
flared up again at the weekend. In all, it left
32 people dead and more than 300 injured—
and deepened the credibility problems con-
fronting Botha’s National Party. Botha was
scheduled to take the oath of office this
week in the newly created position of execu-
tive state president. U.S. officials still hoped
that his power-sharing arrangement could
ease racial tensions. But in Cape Town,
Western officials and white opponents of
the apartheid government warned that real
progress was unlikely as long as the ruling
Afrikaner minority insisted on retaining all
the important levers of power—and on de-
nying political rights and economic justice
to the country’s 20 million blacks.
Ironically, the latest unrest began in
Sharpeville—the site of the 1960 massacre
of 69 blacks that focused world outrage
on apartheid. This time, two other black
officials besides Dlamini were killed when
youths firebombed their car. The violence
quickly spread to the townships of Sebo-
keng and Evaton. Then
in Johannesburg, a bomb
ripped through a govern-
ment building, injuring
three white employees
and causing extensive
damage. Another explo-
sion wiped out a power
station 40 miles from
Johannesburg. A clean-
ing lady found a third
bomb in the Johannes-
burg Supreme Court; it
was removed by an Ar-
my bomb-disposal unit.
Along with the dead and
wounded, the toll included dozens of stores
shut down by arson and looting, homes and
businesses left without electricity and thou-
sands of blacks rendered homeless.
Indignation; The causes of the riots were
not just political. Recently the board that
administers the townships announced a 15
percent increase in municipal rents. That
angered blacks who were already suffering
from high unemployment and inflation,
and who have long chafed at the disparity
between their shantytown accommoda-
tions and the comfortable housing in white
areas of South Africa. The violence also
reflected continuing indignation at the
country’s education system, which man-
dates segregation and spends five times
more on white students than blacks. Among
the demonstrators were 120,000 high-
school students who boycotted classes to
join the township riots.
The most conspicuous reason for the
unrest, however, was the new Constitution.
It allows for three separate Parliaments:
one for whites, one for Indians and one for
Coloreds, or South Africans of mixed race.
Each house will vote separately on its
“own affairs,” such as housing, which affect
only its group. “General affairs,” like eco-
nomic policy, will be voted on by all three
chambers. But whites will retain control of
all major parliamentary committees. And
blacks will still have political rights only in
their “homelands,” the destitute regions (13
percent of South Africa in all) that have
been set aside for blacks. When elections for
the new houses of Parliament were held last
month, black leaders called for a boycott,
and 70 percent of Colored voters and 80
percent of Indians registered their protest
by staying away from the polls.
Whether the Colored and Indian politi-
cians who do servein thenew Parliament can
do anything to impress the doubters remains
to be seen. Rev. Alan Hendrickse, whose
Labor Party captured 76 of 80 seats in the
Colored chamber, says he plans to push for
political rights for all nonwhite South Afri-
cans. But he will have to wait: after a brief
organizational session this month, the Par-
liament is scheduled to adjourn until Janu-
ary. In the meantime, although the govern-
ment finally revoked its latest rent increases
Fallen rioter: Issues of rent —and political injustice
last week, there was talk of an upcoming rent
hike in Soweto. Soweto is the township
where 376 blacks were killed in 1976 in the
largest race riots in South African history.
And despite all the ceremony in Cape Town,
no one was betting that Botha’s new Consti-
tution could prevent a similar bloodletting
from happening again.

CAMPAIGN'84
Politics
And the
Pulpit
Reagan and Mondale fought the first big battle of the
fall campaign last week on a surprise issue—religion.
The president addressing the B’nai B’rith: Turning the other cheek to controversy with some soothing commonplaces about the First Amendment
It wasn’t exactly the first presidential
debate, nor did it turn out to be as much
of a head-to-head confrontation as Walter
Mondale had hoped. But at a time and place
that no one had expected, and over a totally
unexpected subject, Mondale and Ronald
Reagan finally began the rat-a-tat-tat dia-
logue of the fall campaign with back-to-
back speeches to the B’nai B’rith conven-
tion on the proper role of religion in public
life. Religion? Yes, religion-—a resurrected
issue that embodies the ideological schism
that divides the two candidates.
Rather than offering piety-in-the-sky
promises, Mondale was on the attack,
charging that Reagan was “trying to trans-
form policy debates into theological dis-
putes” and was attempting to suggest “that
political dissent from him is un-Christian.”
Alluding to the rhetoric of the Religious
Right at the GOP convention, Mondale
declared, “Most Americans would be sur-
prised to learn that God is a Republican.”
With loaded phrases like “moral McCar-
thyism,” Mondale had hoped to goad the
president into a spirited defense of his recent
power-to-the-pulpit rhetoric that had origi-
nally sparked the church-state debate. But
Reagan turned the other cheek. This time
there was no reprise of his explosive claim

debates into

dissent from him is

I don’t doubt Mr.

patriotism and his
family values. And

his supporters to

that foes of school prayer were “intolerant
of religion.” Instead, when he touched upon
the controversy at all, Reagan offered
soothing commonplaces about the First
Amendment.
Nonetheless, it was a strange kickoff for
what had seemed a one-sided campaign with
Reagan dominating the airwaves. Mondale
was working feverishly to prepare his tax
plan for release early this week and was
about to launch his first strike of TV com-
mercials. But the Democratic candidate did
not hesitate to speak out on the religion
issue—and it was a God-given opportunity
to gain equal footing with Reagan on the
evening news. Even Mondale aides conced-
ed that the church-state question was not a
“voting issue” apt to galvanize the elector-
ate. Rather, they viewed the dispute as a way
of illuminating what they see as the “dark
side” of Reagan: his rhapsodic rhetorical
embrace of the New Right’s controversial
social agenda.
Divisions: Although largely abstract, the
sermonizing over religion and politics was
not without substance: religion has become a
code word symbolizing serious divisions in
American society. Just as he did in 1980,
Reagan has mobilized a political crusade
among the evangelical right and fervent
anti-abortionists. Their primary causes —
school prayer, abortion and financial sup-
port for parents who send their children to
parochial schools —all require governmen-
tal action to alter what they see as the permis-
sive status quo.
The Democrats are far from an exclusive-
ly secular party —rather their views are
much closer to the traditional social gospel
of Christianity. Mondale himself is the son of
a Methodist minister, and his principal ri-
vals for the nomination were a former divin-
ity student (Gary Hart) and a charismatic
clergyman (Jesse Jackson). Even now,
Democratic hopes for victory depend, in
large measure, on using the highly politi-
cized black churches to spur voter registra-
tion and turnout in November. And it was
Geraldine Ferraro who helped bring the

debate to a high level of intensity last July,
when she claimed that Reagan was not “a
good Christian” —an ill-chosen way to
dramatize her contention that cutbacks in
social programs violated traditional reli-
gious notions of charity and compassion.
All the talk about a constitutional wall
between church and state has never prevent-
ed religious leaders from dabbling in poli-
tics, and the First Amendment protects their
right to speak out. A century ago a Presbyte-
rian minister called the Democrats the party
of “rum, Romanism and rebellion” —and
thereby cost Republican James G. Blaine the
1884 election. Leading Protestant clerics
such as Norman Vincent Peale questioned
John Kennedy’s independence from the
Vatican during the 1960 campaign. In 1964
the bulk of America’s mainstream religious
leaders were arrayed against Barry Gold-
water, as many used the pulpit to press
political pieties on their parishioners. Jim-
my Carter, the first presidential nominee to
stresshis “born again” Christianity, forged a
1976 populist alliance of black churches and
Southern white evangelicals. But in 1980,
aided by Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority,
Reagan won an estimated 61 percent of the
votes of white born-again Protestants.
These strands have long been part of the
American political fabric, but there is some-
thing new and different about the way reli-
gion has become so ensnarled with the 1984
campaign. Three different religious groups
have become increasingly vocal partici-
pants within the political arena —the black
churches, the Catholic bishops and the evan-
gelical Christians.
■ ‘Big Church.’ During his primary cam-
paign, Jackson scoffed at the need for money
or endorsements, saying, “We’ve got Big
Church.” Black churches not only provided
Jackson with money and volunteers, but
they were his chosen pulpit for preaching the
political gospel. The religious roots of the
campaign were a dramatic manifestation of
an age-old tradition within the black com-
munity. As African Methodist Episcopal
Bishop H. H. Brookins of Los Angeles ex-
plains, “No black politician of note can say
he or she has been elected without the black
church.” While white ministers generally


reflect the views of their congregations,
many blacks take their political cues from
their pastors. Now blessed with the active
support of Jackson, Mondale hopes that Big
Church will deliver a record black turnout.
■ Battling Bishops. Liberals of all faiths
beamed approvingly when the nation’s Ro-
man Catholic bishops issued a warning last
year about the danger of nuclear war. But the
reaction was far different in June when
Archbishop John O’Connor of New York
said, “I don’t see how a Catholic in good
conscience can vote for a candidate who
explicitly supports abortion.” New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Catholic, imme-
diately challenged the archbishop for taking
a partisan political position. O’Connor later
clarified his views—and the nation’s Catho-
lic bishops issued a statement deploring
abortion but strongly urging the clergy not

to support political candidates. But Arch-
bishop Bernard Law of Boston reignited the
controversy last week when he said that
voters should make abortion “the critical
issue in this campaign.” These remarks were
partly and pointedly directed at Ferraro, an
observant Catholic who says she is personal-
ly opposed to abortion but will not legally
restrict it. Throughout the campaign, Fer-
raro has been shadowed by small claques of
anti-abortion protesters.
■ The Fundamentalist Factor. The Religious
Right is Reagan’s counterpart to the black
churches. It is a constituency that the presi-
dent has assiduously courted, appearing, for
example, on Jerry Falwell’s “Old-Time
Gospel Hour” last March. Fundamentalist
churches in the South are now an integral
part of GOP registration drives. But all
through the first term, the Reagan team
scrupulously avoided risking political capi-
tal in an effort to achieve the evangelicals’
social agenda. It was almost as if Reagan was
following the dictum: groups that are largely
concerned with symbolic issues like school
prayer can be bought off with symbolic ges-
tures. “It’s a very mixed reccord,” said
Connaught Marshner, one of the Religious
Right’s leading political operatives in Wash-
ington. “There’s been a lot of good rhetoric,
no question about that. But beyond that, it’s
very nebulous.”
The current debate over piety and politics
has its roots in the GOP convention, which
was, in effect, a consecration of the Religious
Right’s entry into the mainstream of Rea-
gan’s Republican Party. Falwell gave a
benediction to the convention in which
he described Reagan and Vice President
George Bush as “God’s instruments in re-
building America.” Reagan, of course,
chose a prayer meeting in Dallas to make
his now-famous declaration that “religion
and politics are necessarily related” and to
call opponents of school
prayer “intolerant of re-
ligion.” At roughly the
same time, Sen. Paul
Laxalt wrote a political
letter to fundamentalist
ministers claiming that
“President Reagan has
been faithful in his sup-
port of issues of concern
to Christian citizens.”
Fighting Words: To
supporters of Reagan,
these were not themes
for the fall campaign:
rather, they represented
the last stages of a con-
scious effort to solidify
the president’s political
base. But to Mondale,
watching the convention
on TV, these were fight-
ing words. “When some
Republicans and others
began to suggest that
some of us were not genu-
ine in our faith, and not
legitimate in our point of view,” Mondale
told Newsweek’s Margaret Garrard
Warner in an interview, “I felt I had to speak
up and clear the air—for myself and for the
others.” According to aides, the flashpoint
came when Mondale viewed newsclips of
Reagan’s speech to the Dallas prayer break-
fast. “That’s insulting,” Mondale snapped.
“He’s calling me un-Christian.”
From then on, Mondale was unswerving
in his resolve to respond to Reagan in a
major address. Mondale’s underlying
theme was simple: religion and faith were
private matters, not symbols to be exploited
by partisan politicians. But his arguments
were honed as carefully as his acceptance
speech. Marty Kaplan, his speechwriter,
canvassed religious leaders and theolo-
gians; Mondale himself laboriously studied
the issue. Political considerations were, of
course, eventually weighed: the Mondale
campaign conducted focus groups on the
Jackson at the National Baptist Convention: Money, volunteers and a pulpit for his gospel
religion issue. “The survey data shows that
the very people both campaigns are trying
to reach —independents, young people —
don’t like Reagan’s wrapping himself in
religion,” explained a ranking Mondale
aide. “They agree with Reagan on certain
issues, primarily economic ones, but they
shrink from his social issues and the fervor
with which his supporters push them.”
But Reagan strategists believe only a
small Eastern elite cares about ethereal is-
sues like church and state —and that group
is not inclined to support Reagan in the first
place. Mondale, observed a senior White
House adviser, “is approaching this from a
classic liberal position, almost as if it’s for-
bidden to talk about religion or faith.”
Reagan voters, in contrast, like a candidate
who wears his religion on his sleeve. “Mon-
dale can make political hay for a while,”
Classroom prayer: The voters approve


Money, volunteers and a pulpit for his gospel
JACQUES M.GHENET— Newsweek
said a Reagan tactician. “But he’s in effect
written off the South.”
A sidewalk survey of conservative Jewish
voters in the Williamsburg section of
Brooklyn suggests that the religion issue is
not winning Democratic converts back
from Reagan. “I voted for him in 1980, and
will vote for him again in 1984,” said 22-
year-old Sarah Einhorn as she pushed a
pram along Roebling Avenue. “As for Rea-
gan talking about Christianity, why should
I care? As a Christian, he has right to speak
in the context of his own values.” Herman
Deutsch, who runs a small decorating shop,
even liked Reagan’s speech to the prayer
breakfast. “He is good for Israel and good
for our country,” Deutsch said. “And we as
a community will stay with Reagan.”
Within days, God will be dead as a politi-
cal issue. At least, that’s the view from the
Reagan camp. But Mondale is dubious.’
“I’m not sure that this hasn’t set down roots
in the country’s consciousness that we now
have to deal with,” he says. But barring
more inflammatory statements by Reagan,
the Mondale campaign has no immediate
plans to continue the attack. “That issue has
been given a full week,” says campaign
manager Bob Beckel. Mario Cuomo, how-
ever, intends to re-enter the fray this week
with a speech on religion and politics at the
Gipper’s celluloid alma mater, Notre
Dame. Cuomo concedes that he has been
unimpressed by the tenor of the debate so
far. “People don’t know the difference be-
tween values and morality, religion and mo-
rality, and church and religion,” he con-
tends. “These are all different terms being
used interchangeably.”
Religion aside, the ceremonial kickoff's of
both campaigns last week captured the jux-
taposition between Rose Garden Ronnie
and Frenzied Fritz. The president, carefully
insulated from the press, was all soft sell and
moral uplift, as he campaigned mostly in
California. After one exuberant rally of
42,000 supporters in Cupertino—complete
with skydivers waving red, white and blue
contrails —a Reagan aide couldn’t resist
saying, “I almost feel sorry for Mondale
having to go up against this.”
Red Meat: Empty sidewalks greeted
Mondale and Ferraro as they marched in
New York’s Labor Day parade—and
House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O’Neill
complained that the Democratic nominee
was being “pushed around” by Reagan.
Mondale later mollified O’Neill during a
visit to Capitol Hill, but other red-meat
Democrats begged for passion, not position
papers. Mondale strategists, however, be-
lieve that for now the Teflon President is
immune to personal invective. Instead, they
are stressing issues on which, according to
their polls, more voters agree with Mondale
Rev. Falwell: Boosting ‘God’s instruments’
than Reagan. Mondale’s TV ads, for exam-
ple, are partly designed to raise questions
about what Reagan would do in a second
term. Equally important will be the unveil-
ing of the Mondale tax plan, reviving an
issue that was the centerpiece of his accept-
ance speech. Even before the details of his
deficit-reduction package were out, Mon-
dale had his rhetoric ready. “This tax we’re
talking about,” he declared in Chattanooga,
“that’s Reagan’s tax. That tax is to pay otf
his deficits.”
Beginning with taxes and the deficit —
and extending through nuclear arms, Cen-
tral America, the environment and domes-
tic social programs —Mondale and Reagan
are awash in issues that highlight their
bitter ideological disagreements. Why
then, skeptics might ask, was last week
devoted to the sharpest religious debate
since 1960? The irony is compounded
when it is noted that both men, at best, are
indifferent church-goers. There is no sim-
ple answer: just the observation that for
many voters, as well as candidates, religion
and politics often share the same ethical
imperatives. As long as there are issues
that have a moral component —war, pov-
erty, injustice—no arbitrary dividing line
can ever completely separate religious be-
liefs from political passions.

The Religious Flash Points
While there can be a religious component
to questions ranging from nuclear war to
domestic poverty, this year three issues have
dominated the debate over the proper role of
the pulpit in politics.
■ Abortion. Since the freedom-of-choice
position was enshrined by the U.S. Su-
preme Court in 1973, Catholic groups have
been in the forefront of the fight to overturn
the ruling with a constitutional amend-
ment. Of late, the Religious Right has also
taken up cudgels in the cause. Reagan has
been outspoken in his opposition to abor-
tion, but it is a position supported by only a
minority of the electorate. Both Mondale
and Ferraro have consistently supported
the legal status quo.
■ School prayer. In 1962 the Supreme
Court banned school prayer, and ever
since, religious leaders have been divided
on the issue. Jewish groups and some main-
stream Protestants support the ban on
school prayer; evangelicals have crusaded
to overturn the court with a constitutional
amendment —a goal Reagan supports. Al-
though a lopsided majority of the voters
endorse voluntary school prayer, Mondale
and Ferraro back the court’s position.
■ Tuition tax credits. To get around the ban
on federal support of religion, backers
stress that this program would provide fi-
nancial aid to parents —and not parochial
schools. Catholics, fundamentalists, some
Orthodox Jews and about half the public
support the tax credits —and Reagan
agrees. Ferraro, too, supported them while
in Congress, but Mondale is opposed.


RELIGION
Liberation Theology on Trial
Leonardo Boff: Using the rhetoric of class struggle to challenge the church hierarchy
The future of the institutional Church lies
in this small seed that is the new Church
growing in the fields of the poor and the
powerless. . . The new Church will have to
remain faithful to its path. It will have to be
loyally disobedient. . . [lt] will also have to
listen to the old Church ’s questioning of the
truth of its interpretation of the Gospels.
—Leonardo Boff,“Church: Charism and
Power—Liberation Theology in the
Institutional Church.”
Last week it was Leonardo Boff’s turn to
listen—and explain. Summoned to Rome,
the Franciscan friar from Brazil defended
his immersion in liberation theology during
a four-hour meeting with Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, the conservative German head of
the Vatican’s Sacred Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith. In an attempt to
defuse mounting tensions between the Vati-
can and the Latin American church —and to
forestall any suggestion of an inquisition—
both Ratzinger and Boff were careful to call
the session a “dialogue” in which there were
“no winners or losers.” But if they managed
to avoid open confrontation, conflicts re-
main: Boff unrepentantly said that Rome’s
attack on liberation theol-
ogy was the work of “Euro-
peans who see the Latin
American reality from the
windows ofbuildings.”
Dangers: The Vatican’s
examination of Boff came
hard upon the release of its
report earlier last week on
the dangers of liberation the-
ology, a doctrine that bor-
rows from Marxist sociolo-
gy and has encouraged
political activism among
Roman Catholic priests and
nuns in the Third World.
Ratzinger: ‘Confusion ’
UPI—BETTMANN ARCHIVE
The interrogation, it seems, was motivated
in part by a concern that Boff’s work chal-
lenges the traditional church hierarchy. In-
sisting that “liberation is first and foremost
liberation from the radical slavery of sin,”
the 3 6-page document, written by Ratzinger
and his staff with the approval of the pope,
warned liberation theologians against rob-
bing the church of its spiritual content by
turning it into a mere instrument of secular
politics; such beliefs, Ratzinger wrote, lead
to “a disastrous confusion between the poor
oftheScriptureandthe/>/'o/eta/7arofMarx.”
To the surprise of many, however, the
Vatican at the same time delivered an un-
precedentedly fierce condemnation of eco-
nomic and political oppression in Latin
America, home to more than half the
world’s Catholics. “What’s interesting is
that, in critiquing liberation theology, the
document affirms its deepest premises,”
says the Rev. Virgilio Elizondo, an editor of
the liberal Catholic journal Concilium. In-
deed, Rome seemed eager to demonstrate
that it was not ignoring the poverty and
political violence that led to the develop-
ment of liberation theology in the late 19605:
“The warning against the serious deviations
of some ‘theologies of liber-
ation’ must not at all be tak-
en as some kind of approval,
even indirect, of those who
keep the poor in misery,
who profit from that misery,
who notice it while doing
nothing about it, or who re-
main indifferent to it.”
Despite last week’s ex-
citement, liberation the-
ology isn’t new. It got its
first impetus from Vatican
Council 11, which encour-
aged the clergy to adopt a
“preferential option for the
poor,” and from the 1968 meeting in Me-
dellin, Colombia, of the Latin American
hierarchy, which blamed economic condi-
tions there on the developed nations. It took
its name from the 1973 book “A Theology of
Liberation,” by Gustavo Gutierrez, a priest
recently investigated by the Peruvian epis-
copacy under orders from the Vatican.
While conservative clergymen within the
Latin American church welcomed the
pope’s criticisms, many prominent theolo-
gians, including Brazilian Cardinals Aloisio
Lorscheider and Paulo Evaristo Arns, who
in a gesture of support accompanied Boff to
Rome, remain outspoken advocates of a
politically engaged Christianity.
Boff says he is no Marxist, and is consid-
ered a relative moderate by other theolo-
gians. But in his most recent book,“Church:
Charism and Power” (due out in English
from Crossroad Publishers by the end of the
year), he makes ample use of the rhetoric of
class struggle to argue for an end to political
oppression. Without citing Boff by name,
the Vatican report implies that it is im-
possible to invoke Marxist principles and
terminology without ultimately embracing
Marxist methods and goals: “To attempt to
integrate into theology an analysis whose
criterion of interpretation depends on this
atheistic conception is to involve oneself in
terrible contradictions.” But some leading
U.S. Catholics believe the church is drawing
too rigid a line. “It simply doesn’t make
sense to claim that you can’t make use of any
part of Marxist analysis without becoming a
Marxist-Leninist, ” says the Rev. David Tra-
cy, a priest and professor of theology at the
University of Chicago. “That’s like saying a
Christian theologian cannot use Aristotle
[as Saint Thomas Aquinas did] without be-
coming an ancient Greek pagan.”
Ruling Class: At bottom, the disturbing
element may be Boffs use of Marxist catego-
ries to question the institutional church’s
authority. Classical theology, he has said, is
like capitalism; the church has “its own
ruling class, with all power in the hands of
the Pope, the bishops, and the priests.” Bra-
zil’s 150,000 “base Christian communities”
constitute a practical challenge to the
church’s structure, with their emphasis on
lay participation and admixture of prayer
and political instruction.
Balancing Roman Catholic doctrine with
the Third World perspective may well be the
heart of the matter. In his critique of Rat-
zinger’s document, Boff suggested that the
cardinal include contributions from Third
World theologians when the congregation
prepares its next report on liberation theol-
ogy. And, according to the Brazilian friar,
Ratzinger was receptive. Boff, meanwhile,
who is still waiting for the Vatican’s ruling
on his controversial book, is holding to a
position of “loyal disobedience.” “I prefer
to walk with the church than alone with my
own theology,” he says. “The church lasts,
theologians pass.”

WORLD BUSINESS
Starship ‘Free Enterprise’
High-flying businessmen are trying to turn space into a booming industrial park
Unlike Neil Armstrong, Charles Walker
spoke no memorable phrases. But his
very presence on the six-day mission of the
space shuttle Discovery that ended last
week was every bit as historic as Arm-
strong’s lunar stroll. Walker was the first
delegate of private enterprise to travel into
space, dispatched by Johnson & Johnson
and McDonnell Douglas to test a prototype
of what may well become the first orbit-
ing commercial-production facility. In that
role, Walker was the forerunner of the next
generation of pioneers: highly specialized
versions of factory hands and laborers hop-
ing to turn the earth’s outer precincts into
an extraterrestrial industrial park.
Two days after Discovery set down in
California last week, the White House her-
alded the new era with a conference on
space at which NASA Administrator James
Beggs promised that “as industry picks up,
we intend to move out of the arena.” Even
now, the field encompasses as many as 350
companies pursuing an array of enterprises.
One, communications satellites, is already
considered a mature industry, with $2 bil-
lion in revenues expected this year. An-
other, the sale of data from satellite images,
is about to turn profitable. The most explo-
sive growth may come from the production
of drugs, computer chips and other prod-
ucts that simply can’t be made as well, or as
efficiently, on earth. And growing along
with all of them is the business of sending up
and servicing the equipment. Space is now a
land of opportunity. Says Arthur Dula, a
Walker operating a prototypical space factory on Discovery: The future is starting to arrive
NASA
Houston lawyer specializing in space issues,
“The next generation of billionaires is going
to come from the business of space.”
The chief commercial attraction of space
is its lack of gravity, which facilitates deli-
cate operations, such as the formation of
perfect crystals and hormone separation,
that are difficult or impossible on earth.
Firms may also capitalize on the high de-
gree of vacuum that occurs naturally in
space, or the fact that satellites can spend 24
hours a day in total sunlight or darkness.
Space offers an environment free of friction,
vibration, sound —and people. In sum, Da-
vid W. Lippy, president of the Center for
Space Policy, a consulting firm based in
Cambridge, Mass., calculates that commer-
cial space operations could be a $65 billion-
a-year market by the end of the century. Yet
once space is opened up for exploitation, the
sky will no longer be the limit. “No matter
what we think the figure is today, we are
wrong,” says Milt Copulos, a space special-
ist at the Heritage Foundation. “We are
grossly underestimating the potential.”
Mundane Obstacles: The future has a way
of arriving in bits and pieces, so many people
don’t realize that most of the barriers to
the commercialization of space have al-
ready been conquered. Despite occasional
glitches, the space shuttle’s 12 flights have
demonstrated the feasibility of regular com-
muting between earth and space. President
Ronald Reagan has called for the construc-
tion of a permanent space facility, for which
much of the technology already exists. Most
of the remaining obstacles, in fact, are rather
mundane. Washington must resolve its role
in the future of space development. And
Wall Street must be persuaded to plunk
down millions of dollars for projects that
may not return a dime in profits for years.
McDonnell Douglas and Johnson &
Johnson are in it for the long haul. The
machine that Walker operated on Discov-
ery uses a technique called continuous-flow
electrophoresis to separate a natural hor-
mone from surrounding biological material
500 times more efficiently than on earth,
where gravity interferes. The identity of the
substance being made is still a trade secret,
but enough was produced aboard Discov-
ery for submission to the Food and Drug
Administration for approval. By 1987 the
firms expect to use the shuttle to launch an
orbiting manufacturing plant. It will be a far
cry from the standard brick-and-smoke-
stack factory: a 5,000-pound, 14-foot-long
module similar to the one Walker operated
in last week. Ideally, it would be delivered to
a permanent space station to function auto-


“Why should my cargo
fly less punctually than I do?”
This is an authentic customer statement.

Divorce isn't easy
You're going to be with the next copier you buy for
quite a while. So getting hitched to an unreliable
copier can be a marriage of inconvenience.
Especially when your boss discovers the
frustration and disruption your unreliable new
plaything is causing.
Next time you buy a copier, take a look at
Panasonic first.
Because we realised that most copiers were
pretty much alike feature for feature, we drew on
the world's most advanced copier research
and manufacturing expertise to develop
copiers with ultimate reliability as their
primary feature.
The result is a range of Panasonic
copiers that do everything other copiers do, except
break down as often.
If you're tired of the frustration of the "Out
of Order" sign, you're ready for Panasonic. And a
copier marriage founded in heaven.

Satellite image: Scanning the earth’s surface for profit
COURTESY RYDER GEOSYSTEMS, DENVER, COLO.
A model of Fairchild’s Leasecraft: Looking for customers
matically for six months before being re-
placed with a fresh module. McDonnell
Douglas has a “shopping list” of a dozen
hard-to-isolate pharmaceutical products,
including interferon, blood-clotting agents
and skin-growth factors, that may be suit-
able for profitable manufacture in space.
Microgravity Research Associates, a tiny
Florida-based firm, hopes to have its own
space factory in orbit by 1988. It will make
crystals of gallium arsenide, which can be
turned into computer chips far more power-
ful than the current silicon models; they can
also be used to make efficient lasers for
fiber-optic communications. Again, it is
the lack of gravity that makes space the
ideal place to produce them. Making them
on earth is “like trying to
line up molecules in a
windstorm,” says Rus-
sell Ramsland Jr., exec-
utive vice president of
Microgravity. The value
of the crystals makes
the trip worthwhile: to-
day they would sell for
$50,000 a pound. Micro-
gravity believes the an-
nual market for crystals
will exceed $lOO billion
within 20 years; Rams-
land expects the firm to
earn its first profit in four.
Vanderhoff with spheres: Perfect
LEIF SKOOGFORS
Neither chips nor
drugs, however, will be
the first space product
sold commercially. That
place in history—and
Trivial Pursuit —will go
to tiny (10-micron, or
one four-thousandth of
an inch) latex spheres,
made in an apparatus de-
signed by scientists at
Lehigh University. They
will be used to determine
the size of objects under
the microscope and cali-
brate the porosity of fil-
ters. The U.S. Bureau
of Standards will soon
begin selling vials of
them for about $350.
Eventually, NASA will
turn over the operation
to Particle Technology,
Inc., formed by Lehigh’s
John Vanderhoff and
others, who hope to sell
$ 1 million worth of
measuring balls annual-
ly. Perfect spheres larger
than three microns can-
not be made on earth:
gravity distorts them as
they form.
Research: The absence
of gravity has lured a
number of other firms
aloft. John Deere Inc. is
doing research on metal
formation and has already applied some
findings to its foundry operations. Minne-
sota Mining and Manufacturing is about to
conclude a two-year agreement with NASA
to perform experiments on shuttle flights.
3M has no clear goal in mind, and expects
no quick results, says Charles Podsiadly,
who heads the research team devising the
experiments. But “now’s the time to get in
there and learn,” he says. If the pattern of
past scientific progress is any guide, space
research will lead to products and processes
now undreamed of.
One area in which the future has ar-
rived is remote sensing—the enhancement
and interpretation of electronic images
made by satellites. More than 40 firms
are selling analytic da-
ta to petroleum compa-
nies, crop-market ana-
lysts and others who
need detailed readings of
the earth’s surface. By
one estimate, the market
may be worth $2 billion a
year by 2000.
All this activity is go-
ing to require a lot of lift-
offs, and dozens of com-
panies are lining up
to provide them. Some
will work in conjunction
with the shuttle. Orbital
Sciences of Vienna, Va., for example, has
teamed up with Martin Marietta, an experi-
enced aerospace firm, to develop “upper-
stage components” that will ferry payloads
from the shuttle’s relatively low orbit to
higher altitudes or other spots in the sky.
Fairchild Industries is developing a per-
manent space platform—called Lease-
craft—that will be serviced by the shuttle.
According to vice president Emanuel
Fthenakis, Fairchild will launch its first
platform in 1987 or 1988. It has no paying
customers as yet, but it hopes to sign
up the McDonnell Douglas/Johnson &
Johnson joint venture, and others like it.
In the style of no-frills airlines, Space
Services of America, based in Houston,
plans to carve a niche for itself by offering
Delta rocket: Competing for light launches
cheap, flexible trips to space. Space Serv-
ices, whose president is former astronaut
Donald (Deke) Slayton, became the first
private company to build and launch a
space vehicle when it tested its Conestoga I
in 1982. Using off-the-shelf technology,
Space Services has designed a 693-foot-
high rocket that can launch from almost
any site and carry almost any payload.
Unlike some firms, Space Services will
compete with the shuttle, not complement
it. With the shuttle, a customer has to wait
for a mission that will fly the orbit he
needs. The shuttle has not yet flown a
polar orbit, for example, the kind remote-
imaging satellites use. “Our mode of busi-


3M scientists ready a space experiment: Long shots
BILL NELSON— 3M
ness,” says Slayton, “is, ‘Have Rocket,
Will Travel’.”
The government itself is fostering com-
petition for the shuttle. NASA has recently
turned over the job of launching Delta
rockets, which have carried more than 175
satellites into space, to Transpace Carriers
of Greenbelt, Md. NASA refers to this
type of transfer of existing activities
as “privatization” to distinguish it from
“commercialization”—the initiation of
projects by private industry. After making
its first launch in 1986, Transpace antici-
pates doing six a year, concentrating on
lightweight satellites. Shortly after that,
the shuttle itself may go private: Beggs has
told Congress that the shuttle could be
ready for corporate operation by 1988 or
1989 and has promised to complete a pri-
vatization plan by mid-1986.
Ariane: Additional competition is com-
ing from overseas. Last month France’s
new Ariane 3 rocket put its first satellite
cargo into orbit; it already has 28 orders for
future launches. The French are also con-
sidering the establishment of a manned
space shuttle and space station of their own.
West Germany conducted some promising
commercial space research on a previous
shuttle mission and is planning more.
In Japan, four large trading companies
have organized consortiums of interested
firms—from drug makers to seed compa-
nies—to study the uses of zero-gravity man-
ufacturing and other technologies.
Yet for all its promise of dollars as numer-
ous as the stars, space has yet to capture
fully the imagination of Wall Street. “As it
stands now, you have a lot of ideas chasing
money,” says Wolfgang De-
misch of First Boston Corp. “It
would take a considerable degree
of faith by the investor, and most
investors are not known for a
high degree of faith.” One prob-
lem with space ventures is that
the up-front costs are enormous
and the paybacks uncertain and
far off" at best. The recent failure
of two communications satellites
has underscored the risks and
raised the stakes: insurance pre-
miums went up when the satel-
lites didn’t. George Washington
University space expert John
Logsdon thinks that few inves-
tors have the patience required
for space speculating. “There’s a
danger of overselling when peo-
ple are not sophisticated enough
to understand the long time
scale,” he says. “It will turn nas-
ty if the payoffs are not there.”
Venture-capital firms usually
contribute no more than $5 mil-
lion to new companies, but the
typical space project requires
$25 million to $5O million. Nev-
ertheless, two venture firms have
sprung up to deal exclusively in
space projects, and several major
financial institutions have helped arrange
some space financing. So far, though, most
of the money that’s gone into space has
come from the profits of large, well-estab-
lished companies, rather than freshly capi-
talized start-ups. For big firms, the difficul-
ty of launching projects may turn out to be a
blessing, giving them that much more of a
head start on the competition.
Another unknown is what role the
government will play. NASA has
been actively encouraging commer-
cialization, luring companies into
space with offers of low-cost flights
on the shuttle and other incentives.
But some observers believe that
NASA should stick to research and
not try to determine the direction of
space commercialization. Says Gregg
Fawkes of the National Chamber
Foundation: “Somebody will find a
way to do it for a fraction of what it
costs the government.”
Anyone seeking to do business in
space has first to penetrate a jungle
of government regulation—as Dula,
who helped arrange Space Services’
test launch of the Conestoga I, can
attest. At first, the Federal Aviation
Administration insisted that the
rocket land within the territorial
waters of the United States; it lat-
er granted an exemption. The FAA
also had to issue an order designat-
ing temporarily restricted airspace.
Because the rocket was leaving the
country, the State Department re-
quired Space Services to obtain an
export license. The firm also had to
get an experimental radio license. “We
didn’t have final clearance for that launch
until 24 hours before the thing went
up,” says Dula.
Gradually, the clouds have been clear-
ing. The Department of Transportation has
been designated as the agency responsible
for private space vehicles. And a bill in
Congress would classify American space
ventures as domestic activities, eliminating
the need for export licenses and making
certain tax incentives apply.
Bargain: Of course, without the govern-
ment there would be no space industry.
Billions and billions of taxpayer dollars
were poured into the foundation that pri-
vate enterprise will now build on. That’s just
as it should be, says Max Faget. After run-
ning NASA’s manned-flight division for 20
years, Faget became president of Space In-
dustries, Inc., a Houston firm that hopes to
build a space factory. When space business
begins to blast off, he argues, the nation will
reap the rewards of its investment in the
form of increased jobs and improved
products and technologies. Says Faget:
“Ultimately, the taxpayers are getting a
bargain.”
America’s thrust into space has been
powered by a couple of mighty engines:
government spending and the dedication of
great scientists. It has been a splendid ride,
putting men on the moon and spinning off a
dazzling array of technology from comput-
er chips to wide-body jets. Now we will find
out how much farther we can go with a
really powerful engine: the profit motive.

The Ghost in the Machine.
Some cameras today are so full of electro-
nic gadgetry that they even tell you with a
voice what’s right and what’s wrong.
All you need to know is how to push a
button.
The ghost in the machine will stop you
from taking bad pictures. The question is:
will it help you create good photographs?
At Hasselblad we believe it is the eye
and the talent of the photographer that
should determine what to do. Therefore
the Hasselblad doesn’t talk to you. It lis-
tens.
That is one of the reasons it is chosen by
most of today’s great photographers.
The advanced technology of a Hassel-
blad (advanced enough to be used by the
astronauts in space) is created to be your
servant, not your master.
And its Quality is created to stay that
way for a long time. The Hasselblad is built
essentially by hand, and it takes a full year
to finish it.
Yet we don’t build a ghost into it.
Just a servant.

BOOKS
Like a Rolling Stone
Dance with the Devil. By Stanley Booth.
383 pages. Random House. $16.95. Sym-
phony for the Devil. By Philip Norman.
413 pages. Linden/Simon & Schuster.
$17.95.
“The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the
World.” That’s how the Rolling Stones have
been billed for years. For all the criticism
directed against this raffish group in the 20-
odd tumultuous years since they first began
offending propriety, it’s a boast that few can
challenge. It comes down to this: if the
Stones have never sent a shiver up your spine
or made you want to get up and dance, you
just don’t like rock. Conversely, if the band’s
on- or offstage antics have never made you
just a bit queasy, you’ve got no sense.
Perhaps it’s inevitable, then, that Booth’s
overblown, even preposterous “Dance with
the Devil” and English novelist Philip
Norman’s penetrating “Symphony
for the Devil” —titles derived from
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards’s
“Sympathy for the Devil”—should
represent antipodean poles of biogra-
phy. Booth practices a brand of apoca-
lyptic jive that, for all its intermittent
vividness, seems to have come intact
and virtually unedited from a time
capsule buried just after the 1969
Stones tour it chronicles. That’s the
one that ended in the disastrous Alta-
mont free concert, in which a horde of
Hell’s Angels stomped, kicked and
stabbed a pistol-wielding black
youth—and with him put the more
fatuous delusions of the “mellow”
’6os to death. The power to summon a
mob, the Stones learned, does not con-
fer the power to control it.
Enduring Power: The trouble is,
that tour has been done before, and
better, most notably in the Maysles
brothers’ documentary film “Gimme
Shelter.” Worse, Booth has no sense
of humor at all, a flaw that prevents
him from even beginning to make sense of a
band whose enduring power (and, arguably,
greatest limitation) derives from an irony so
pervasive it borders at times on self-parody.
(“I know, it’s only rock and roll,” runs the
lyric of a characteristic Stones anthem of the
’7os, “but I like it, like it, yes I do.”) Yet
Booth, invoking nuclear dread, thinks the
band personifies “the most Damoclean time
yet seen on earth (‘This could be the last
time,’ says an early Stones record).” Unfor-
tunately, the song in question is quite trans-
parently about the end of a love affair and
nothing else.
It’s with relief then, that readers will turn
to Philip Norman’s “Symphony for the Dev-
il,” a well-researched and cleverly written
book that uses a novelist’s eye and fine-tuned
sense of social history to give a consistently
fascinating version of the Stones’ career to
date. From the band’s earliest days as rebel-
lious schoolboys who earnestly mimicked
the black American blues singers they idol-
ized, to their later incarnation as decadent
anarchist princelings wandering the world
with a ragged and fluctuating band of court-
iers, Norman fashions a balanced and often
surprisingly intimate narrative.
Central to the book’s success are Nor-
man’s convincingly drawn portraits of Jag-
ger and Richards, the calculating mind and
soul, respectively, of the band. With the
evident cooperation of Jagger’s onetime
lover Marianne Faithfull, a tragic figure in
her own right, Norman gives us a fuller
picture of that “dancing paradox of athlete
and stripper”—shrewd, complex, impu-
dent, mercurial, indulgent father and some-
KEN REGAN— CAMERA 5
Jagger: ‘A dancing paradox of athlete arid stripper’
times softhearted womanizer—than we are
likely to get from that gentleman’s forth-
coming autobiography. As for Richards,
writes Norman, “for all [his] gypsy squalor
and reek of suicidal decadence,” he remains
“strangely and resiliently alive. He seems,
within his own ghastly parameters, a happy,
even a healthy man.” Norman’s account of
founding member Brian Jones’s accidental
death in 1969 tells that sad tale without the
necessity of blaming his survivors (as Booth,
among others, would like to do) for an event
over which they had no control. “Symphony
for the Devil” is a book for fans, yes, but for
adult fans who can make the elementary
distinction that eludes so many who pontifi-
cate about rock: that between the artists and
their art.

I’ve done it lots of times.
It’s easy as hitting a tennis ball,
riding a bike or playing the piano.
The truth is lots of things are easy
for some people. That’s why Sir
Edmond Hillary climbed Mt.
Everest while the rest of us stayed
firmly at sea level. Smoking is like
anything else.
Clearly if you’ve never really
enjoyed cigarettes it’s easy to give
up. On the other hand, twenty years
of dedicated smoking can’t be
changed overnight.
So you want to give up. What
do you do? A week at Warburton is
the answer. The Warburton Health
Care Centre runs a professionally
supervised, residential, one week
stop smoking programme. The
programme is the famous McFarland
Falkenberg stop smoking system. It
has been used by over 20,000,000
people throughout the world. And the
majority have been able to stop
smoking as a result.
Courses begin with a complete
health and fitness assessment and
include daily massage and
hydrotherapy. In your free time you’ll
be able to use the centre’s large heated
pool, tennis courts and many other
facilities or just enjoy a ramble
through the beautiful tree covered
foothills of Mt. Donna Buang.
The Centre itself is set in
landscaped gardens just beyond the
picturesque village of Warburton.lt’s
an easy 77 km drive from Melbourne.
So if you’re a smoker and
would like to give up as easily as
possible, telephone (059) 66 2404 or
fill in the coupon.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Speedy, Filmless Electronic Cameras
Anyone at the Los An-
geles Olympics who
took the time to watch the
photographers along the
sidelines could have seen
one part of the future in
action. Among the hun-
dreds of clicking, whirring
single-lens reflex cameras
were two strange, boxy de-
vices used by photogra-
phers from Japan’s Yomiuri
and Asahi newspapers. Yo-
miuri’s photographers used
a camera manufactured by Canon Inc.; Asahi’s used a model
made by Sony Corp. The odd-looking cameras are the first of a
new generation that record their pictures not on film, but on
miniature versions of the floppy discs used in computers.
The electronic cameras are a hybrid of Japan’s high-quality
optical cameras and video technology. They use interchange-
able optical lenses and have “through the lens” viewfinders like
ordinary cameras. But the images picked up by the lens are
focused on a charge-coupled device (CCD), a light-sensitive
semiconductor that converts the image into an electronic
signal. The signal is then recorded magnetically on a small
floppy disc that is inserted into the camera like a film cartridge.
The electronic camera’s biggest selling point is speed. Photo-
The Sony and Canon cameras:
The first of a new generation
journalists can put the flop-
py disc into a scanner and
instantly see their pictures
on a television screen. Yo-
miuri and Asahi photogra-
phers at the Olympics trans-
mitted the data from their
discs via telephone lines to
their offices in Tokyo,
where it was transferred di-
rectly onto automated
platemaking equipment.
The electronic still cam-
era has been a long time
coming. Sony Corp. first announced its Mavica prototype in
1980, saying that the new camera would go on sale by 1983. But
problems with image resolution and high cost forced the
company to miss that deadline. That gave Sony’s competitors
time to catch up. At the Olympics, Canon may have had the
edge. Its camera takes both color and black-and-white pic-
tures, while Sony’s takes only black and white. The Canon
camera’s high-density CCD, which has approximately
400,000 picture elements, also provides finer image resolution
than the Sony prototypes. Both firms expect to begin market-
ing their cameras for news and other professional applications
in late 1985. Neither company has set a price for its camera.

Stratospheric Phones
Airline travelers, separated from the
realities of everyday life by a 30,000-foot
wedge of space, are nearly as isolated as
seafaring voyagers were a century ago.
Some passengers find that distance frus-
trating. Now they can bring the worka-
day world aloft by picking up a highflying
version of that übiqui-
tous terrestrial device:
the telephone.
The Airfone is a radio-
operated pay phone that
allows airline passengers
to make calls anywhere
in the United States —
including Alaska and
Hawaii —during flights.
The Airfone, Inc., phone
system, developed joint-
ly by Goeken Communi-
cations Corp. of Oak
Brook, 111., and Western
Union, has been con-
tracted by nine major air-
lines and will be tested
this fall. It sends conver-
sations via a special radio
Airfone: Sky talker
frequency to one of 37 ground stations
that transfer the call to local phone lines.
A computer on board the aircraft selects
the ground station farthest ahead of the
plane’s flight path that will give the
strongest signal, minimizing costs.
To make a call, a passenger walks to
one of several Airfone units mounted on
the aircraft cabin wall, slides in a credit
card and waits until the
card number is verified.
The caller can then
take the cordless handset
back to his or her seat to
dial. The calls, which
cost $7.50 for the first
three minutes and $1.25
for each additional min-
ute, are billed automati-
cally to the customer’s
credit card. Because calls
cannot be transferred
from one ground station
to another, they are limit-
ed to a maximum of 40
minutes. Conversations
should come across al-
most as clearly as they
do on the ground; if for
some reason a call is in-
audible, Airfone, Inc.,
will refund the cost to the passenger.
The company, which is operating the
system under an experimental license
from the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission, is installing Airfones on
large aircraft designed for long flights;
eventually they may be available in small-
er planes. Passengers using the phones
should be able to make international calls
by the end of 1985; in the future they may
be able to field incoming calls from land-
locked clients and friends as well. Other
twists are in the offing. Passengers may be
able to scan an on-board computer termi-
nal linked to an Airfone for lists of current
hotel vacancies; stockbrokers may hook
up the Airfone to their own personal
computers to print out the latest stock-
market quotations.
Other firms are moving into the sky-
talker field. New York’s Millicom Inc. is
seeking FCC approval for a rival system
that will allow passengers to make calls of
unlimited duration from hookup connec-
tions located next to their seats. Goeken,
meanwhile, is looking earthward for new
markets for its radio-operated phones. It
hopes to bring out a Railfone system for
conversation-starved Amtrak commut-
ers next year.

THE BULLETIN
NEIGHBORHOOD
Australia netted into
tuna boat tug-of-war
With the Solomon Islands maintaining its threat to sell off a confiscated US tuna
boat, DENIS REINHARDT and STUART INDER report on moves to have
Australia use its diplomatic muscle to smooth troubled waters.
AUSTRALIA has intervened on behalf
of the United States in a diplomatic
showdown between Washington and
the Solomon Islands over the seizure
and confiscatioh of the 103-tonne tuna
fleet mothership Jeanette Diana.
The US has imposed sanctions on
Solomon Islands fish exports worth
around $l2 million a year and forming
one-sixth of its export trade follow-
ing the calling of international tenders
for the boat at a reserve price of $3.5
million.
The owners of the San Diego-regis-
tered boat had offered to pay the Sol-
omons government $250,000 for its re-
lease, after the Solomons High Court
ordered it impounded and fined the
master and owners.
The US sanctions were imposed
automatically under the Magnusson
Act, legislation passed by Washington
after pressure from the American Tuna
Boat Association. The Magnusson Act
provides for economic embargos on any
nation impounding a US-owned fishing
vessel.
The Jeanette Diana was captured
under extraordinary circumstances and
continues to be held under armed guard
by the Royal Solomons Police Force
at Tulagi, the former British colonial
capital.
The armed seizure took place in late
June off Santa Isabel, one of the north-
ern walls of the wartime “slot” where
naval battles with Japanese forces for
the control of Guadalcanal saw the loss
of the cruiser, HMAS Canberra.
The Jeanette Diana had been located
by a light aircraft within the Solomons
200 nautical mile offshore economic
zone. It ignored detection of its unli-
censed intrusion as had other US and
Taiwanese registered fishing craft on
the presumption that the Solomons did
not have the naval capabilities to give
chase.
By coincidence, the 25-metre
fibreglass prototype patrol boat Pioneer
built by a West Australian consortium
had been placed on
charter to the Solomons
government for a pepper-
corn rental after complet-
ing a sales tour of nearby
South Pacific island
nations.
The Solomons govern-
ment urgently telexed the
consortium of Wigmores,
Agnew Cluff and M. G.
Kailis seeking permission
to use the boat for a high
seas pursuit.
Crewed with an armed
police boarding party,
Pioneer located Jeanette
• t>
Diana in the early hours of
June 28. The American
boat tried to flee, ignoring
orders to heave to. Shots
were fired and a boarding
party sent to the bridge of
the Jeanette Diana before
the captain surrendered.
For the sales consor-
tium it was a windfall entry
into the valuable 8-10 pa-
trol boat contract Can-
berra is to let among 13
Australian shipyards as
part of its South Pacific aid
program.
Soon after, the Sol-
omons bought Pioneer for $BOO,OOO. But
with the capture of the Jeanette Diana
the trouble began for the caretaker gov-
ernment of Prime Minister Solomon
Mamaloni who faces a general election
on October 24.
Intense American pressure, inclu-
ding the Magnusson Act sanctions,
turned relations sour with Mamaloni.
The Solomons ambassador to the
United Nations, Francis Saemala, was
called home last week for consultations.
Saemala, who is also ambassador
designate to Washington, was sent back
to New York with a toughly-worded
message for the US State Department
via America’s mission at the UN.
Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni: under pressure
Reiterating early public comments,
Saemala was instructed to tell the US
that his tiny nation (pop 265,000) would
refuse to issue any fishing licenses to US
corporations and would ban access to
its waters by any US owned, registered
or captained vessel. As well, it would
now entertain requests from Soviet
authorities for fisheries access.
At this stage, according to Solomons
sources, Australian pressure on behalf
of the US started to emerge.
The US does not maintain a perma-
nent mission in Honiara and diplomatic
traffic is handled by its embassy in Port
Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The Sol-
omons governrtteht during the past two


Tuna fishing in the South Pacific: troubled waters
SOUTH PACIFIC COMMISSION
months has refused to meet senior Am-
erican diplomats in the region and has
allowed access to only a consular officer
from Port Moresby.
Australian diplomats have put to
Solomons Foreign Minister George
Talasasa the suggestion that, during
talks, in Suva this week on a fisheries
treaty between South Pacific forum
members and the US, the Solomons
should indicate her willingness to com-
promise on the return of the boat.
The Solomons government has told
Australian mediators that it is deter-
mined to go through with the tender
process (tenders closed on September
10) and then it “will be in a position to
review the situation.”
The US Information Service in Syd-
ney fired the latest shot late last week in
the war over the Jeanette Diana. The
service released a statement warning
potential buyers of the vessel, that the
US considers it to be “legally a US flag
vessel, irrespective of any Solomon
Islands government action” and that the
US “would not recognise the validity of
any transfer of registry of title.”
The blast continues: “The US gov-
ernment considers that, if the Solomon
Islands government attempts to either
use the vessel or to sell it to another
party, potential buyers should be aware
of the cloud on the title. The US govern-
ment has available legal remedies to re-
cover the vessel.
“The US government also considers
that aggrieved US private parties will
continue to have enforceable rights to
recover the vessel, as well as damages
resulting from seizure. The vessel would
be subject to seizure and forfeiture pro-
ceedings in the US” (if it were to be
sailed there by a new, unrecognised
owner).
The statement added that “the US
hopes that this problem can be resolved
amicably,” which is a view that was
shared by the South Pacific forum mem-
bers meeting in Tuvalu the previous
week.
There, Solomon Islands delegates
Vanuatu Prime Minister Walter Lini: critical
pressed the forum countries to support
its stand by putting a ban on all US fish-
ing vessels in Pacific Islands ports and
withdrawing licences for the US to fish
in their area.
Such retaliation was seen as being an
over-reaction by the Solomons and the
forum would not go along with it con-
fining itself to expressing concern at the
US failure to recognise the 200 mile re-
stricted zone for tuna and at the US try-
ing to enforce its position through a
trade embargo.
(“Hardly a considerate way of deal-
ing with a small, helpless nation like the
Solomons,” said Vanuatu Prime Minis-
ter Walter Lini.)
Generally, the forum shared the Aus-
tralian view that the immediate problem
was between the Solomons and the US
but that the long term had to bring some
multilateral fisheries agreement with the
Pacific islands and the US.
Australia’s opinion won it some un-
expected flak a few days later when
Prime Minister Bob Hawke made an
official visit to Suva and was boycotted
by Solomon Islands students at a uni-
versity ceremony.
As Australia’s views were no more
influential than anybody else’s at the
forum, the student boycott was more
particularly a demonstration of the
strong feelings aroused in the Solomons
by the Jeanette Diana affair.
That the forum did not support the
Solomons’ proposals on this occasion is
not to say there are not equally strong
feelings against present US policy by
Pacific island states who see fishing re-
sources as almost their only hope of im-
proving living standards. □


NEW ZEALAND
Lange carries
nuclear issue
to the Soviets
Prime Minister Lange: a fresh initiative
AAP
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALAND’S Prime Minister
David Lange plans a fresh initiative in
his crusade against nuclear weapons
when he goes to New York this month
to address the United Nations General
Assembly.
Already scheduled to meet the Am-
erican Secretary of State, George Shultz,
to discuss the New Zealand ban on
visits of nuclear warships, Lange has set
up meetings with the Foreign Minister
of the other major nuclear power and he
aims to present the New Zealand view
that the nuclear arms race is “insane.”
It will be the first time that a New
Zealand Labor Prime Minister has
talked with long-serving Foreign Minis-
ter of the Soviet Union Andrei
Gromyko.
As Lange sees it, there is no point in
merely communicating the New Zea-
land nuclear concern to the United
States it must do so to all the nuclear
powers.
“I am anxious to see Mr Gromyko to
tell him that New Zealand does not ac-
cept this escalating tension and to tell
him of the responsibility of his govern-
ment to see there is climb-down from
that awful brink,” Lange told a news
conference.
Opposition leader Sir Robert
Muldoon dismissed the Lange initiative
as another example of the Labor Prime
Minister “big-noting” himself. “Those
foreign ministers probably do not know
who Lange is,” Sir Robert said.
Yet Lange’s determination to per-
severe with his anti-nuclear stance, after
the discouraging response he has had
from the US and from Australia, indi-
cates the depth of his commitment to
the cause.
There is a consistency about the
Lange anti-nuclear campaign that ele-
vates it above mere politics. He sought
to persuade the recent South Pacific for-
um in Tuvalu, that it should make the
issue of a nuclear-free zone in the South
Pacific the subject of a United Nations
resolution.
The forum instead decided to set up
a working party to draft a nuclear-free
zone treaty and left it to individual
nations to decide whether to accept
visits by nuclear-powered ships.
There seems little doubt that Lange
will bring the issue to the forefront
when he addresses the General As-
sembly. At the same time, he is aware
that Australia is disturbed that New
Zealand’s policy could diminish the
American commitment to ANZUS.
Lange showed some tetchiness over
newspaper reports that he and Austra-
lia’s Bob Hawke were not on the
friendliest terms. The speculation sur-
faced at Tuvalu where Hawke argued
strongly against Lange on several issues.
On his return to New Zealand Lange
said there had been “no rancor.” He
added: “Anyone who can do a dance
with the same man two nights in a row
hasn’t fallen out.”
Nevertheless, it seems that the nu-
clear issue may be driving a wedge be-
tween Labor governments in Canberra
and Wellington just when bureaucrats
in both capitals believed that the ill-feel-
ing which persisted in the later years of
the Muldoon regime had been
eradicated.
So much of the popular success of
the Lange government has been pat-
terned on the Hawke model, it is curious
that the chemistry of the two leaders has
failed to “catch.”
Without this element, New Zealand
may have to work harder at other levels
to secure its trade objectives.
New Zealanders have been subjected
to a massive propaganda campaign on
the parlous plight of the economy. That
has preceded the economic summit
where Lange hopes to achieve a consen-
sus on how the country can pull itself
out of what he has described as “the
gravest economic crisis” New Zealand
has faced.
New Zealand will need all the help it
can get from its friends as it hauls itself
up by the bootstraps.
The question is whether, in pursuing
the anti-nuclear crusade so diligently, it
is antagonising those best-placed to as-
sist.
National Party president Mrs Sue
Wood, returning from a US visit, sug-
gested that a trade backlash could be
one of the serious results of the govern-
ment’s nuclear warships ban. She said
the Reagan administration had no wish
to impose trade sanctions in retaliation
for the ban but could not control Con-
gress and those congressmen represen-
ting cattlemen and sheepfarmers had
been particularly critical.
It has not been all bad news for New
Zealanders, though. The Rugby Union
has cleared Andy Haden of 10 charges
of infringing amateur rules.
Haden, who did not tour Australia
recently with the All Blacks, faced being
banned from rugby. Instead, he can
continue to captain the Auckland team
which last week thrashed premier prov-
incial side Canterbury and he may even
be persuaded to turn out again for the
All Blacks.
Rugby, like the economy, could be
on the road to recovery. □

Do-it-yourself with ISD.
Efficiently.
Direct-dialling overseas calls frees
your staff to do the jobs you pay them to
do. At the same time new ISD efficiencies
now allow you to control costs you had
previously considered uncontrollable.
If your company executives’ access to ISD is
blocked, consider the number
of people it currently can take
to make an overseas phone
call. Then consider the obvious
advantages of ISD.
You can call direct,
without unnecessary delays
and fmstrations, to over 150
worldwide destinations. You
interrupt nobody from their
important work. You gain
greater securities by eliminat-
ing unnecessary parties.
A very businesslike
approach to cost
management.
Modern PABX and telephone management systems
allow you to use ISD as you want it, with total
control over the who, when and how, of ISD access
and use.
These systems give you new securities through
new controls and new accountability Most ISD
accounts can itemise each call by cost, duration
and destination.
You can also benefit from the ISD Ring-Back
Price Service that is now available to most
metropolitan phones. So whoever uses ISD in your
business, however they use it, you can monitor,
control and allocate costs, call by call.
A new control on costs.
Whenever and wherever you call, with ISD you can
significantly reduce your communications costs.
Simply, ISD is your cheapest way to call overseas.
Oust $1.30 a minute to New Zealand and the
South Pacific, $1.90 a minute to other countries.)
In fact, ISD is at least 10% cheaper than an
operator-connected call. Dialling overseas direct
yourself is the quickest, cheapest, most convenient
K’l?s?v V.^'SS
m
way and you will not tie up
your secretary and switchboard
operator each time you call
overseas.
It adds up to a simple,
cost-efficient equation. The
more calls you make by ISD,
the more you eliminate the
wastage of time and money.
And the less you interrupt
the workflow of others in your
company.
If all these cost savings
and efficiency advantages come
as something of a surprise,
consider this. ISD benefits are
available to most businesses now, at no additional
cost. If you’re on the phone, you should be
switched to ISD - now

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The strategist behind
Boral’s corporate bite
Boral Ltd last week became Australia’s lOth-largest listed profit earner and with
digestion of its $220 million takeover of Blue Metal Industries is poised for further
expansion. DA VID HASELHURST looks at the man behind this remarkable growth.
AFTER ANNOUNCING Boral’s re-
cord $95.1 million profit last week, man-
aging director Sir Eric Neal topped off
his usual 11- or 12-hour working day in
the office by going home and drawing
up graphs on its 10-year performance.
Aged 60, Neal keeps up the pace he
has maintained since becoming chief
executive of the building materials sup-
ply group 11 years ago.
Boral has in that time swallowed a
string of other companies and boosted
itself up the ladder of listed companies
from around No 30, with a market capi-
talisation of about $7O million, to No 13
today, with a market capitalisation of
some $857 million.
Growth, however, has not been for
growth’s sake as Neal is quick to
point out. The emphasis is on earnings,
not on size. Under his leadership in the
past 10 years, net profit has risen 13-fold
to $95.1 million, revenue 12-fold to
$1364.4 million and earnings per share
(adjusted for issues) by almost 4/ 2 times
to 41.4 c.
Investors who have stayed with
Boral have reason to be satisfied. An in-
vestment in 1000 shares in mid-1974
would have cost around $l3OO. A one-
for-four issue at $1 in that year plus one-
for-five bonus issues in 1977, 79, 80 and
82 would have boosted the original
holding to 2592 shares, worth today
$9590. The present shares are pregnant
with another one-for-five free issue.
Boral began moving into building
materials and quarrying in the mid-
-1960s while founding chief executive Sir
Elton Griffin was still in the chair a
position he held for 27 years from the
company’s beginning as Bitumen and
Oil Refineries (Australia) Ltd in associa-
tion with Caltex in 1947. From its un-
certain start as a bitumen supplier, it
gradually moved away from depen-
dence on that business into successful
portfolio investment, basic construction
materials, quarrying and the acquisition
of gas supply companies.
That’s how Boral acquired Neal who
was manager of the Ballarat Gas Supply
Co when Boral took it over in 1963.
Neal’s background is in engineering.
He completed an apprenticeship in the
metal trades after leaving Thebarton
Boys’ Technical School, matriculated at
night school and studied mechanical
and electrical engineering at the South
Australian School of Mines.
At 25, he got a trouble-shooting job
as engineer at the Broken Hill gasworks.
In three years, Neal rebuilt the plant
which turned around to profits and in
1959 he was promoted to manage the
Ballarat gas supply operation.
By 1970 he had become chief of
Boral’s gas division and three years
later, under the guiding hand of Griffin,
moved into the chief executive’s chair
while Griffin retired to deputy-chair-
manship of the board under Sir John
O’Neill.
The last takeover in which Griffin
played any part was Boral’s successful
$l6 million bid for Cyclone Co of Aus-
tralia Ltd launched the day after his
death on June 16, 1975.
Since then, Boral has undertaken a
string of acquisitions including $5O mil-
lion invested in takeovers in the late
1970 s to establish a presence in the
United States brick and tile market, a
$57 million bid for Australian Gypsum
Industries undertaken in 1978, the take-
over of Pacific Brick in 1980 for more
than $lO million, Quarry Industries
for $55 million in 1981 and in the same
year the Launceston Gas Co for $2.35
million.
It made the big bite in 1982 and
acquired Blue Metal Industries in a bid
that valued the quarrying-concrete
group at $220 million.
Digesting BMI caused Borahs earn-
ings per share to dip for the first time in
years in 1983 down from 32.2 c in the
previous year to 23.6 c because only
eight months of BMl’s trading was in-
cluded in the consolidated result.
Sales of surplus BMI assets are
understood to have recouped some $7O
million by the end of the latest June
year and the interest bill was trimmed
from almost $4l million to $36 million.
The latest mix of Boral’s business
will not be clear until the annual report
is available in a month but it appears
that, of total sales of $1375 million, the
biggest contributors would be pre-
mixed concrete (around 15 percent-
plus), road surfacing, quarrying and
Cyclone products (each more than 10
percent), clay bricks and concrete prod-
ucts (about 10), sales of liquid petro-
leum gas (about 8), plaster products (8),
US operations (7.5) and United King-
dom operations (less than 4). The re-
mainder of the group sales is spread
over insulation products, timber, win-
dows, engineering equipment and fabri-

cation, steel, scaffolding and transport.
It is difficult to speculate where Boral
might make its next major acquisition in
Australia. It is already in a major pos-
ition in many of its markets. Any sug-
gestion that Boral is about ready to go
on the takeover trail, however, is affably
deflected by Neal, whose friendly smile
and somewhat self-effacing manner bely
a reputation for setting and demanding

“We’ve still got further polishing up
to do here,” he said, “not only in the
BMI business but also in Boral opera-
tions like the new tile plants in Cali-
fornia and Florida.
“We’re not short of things to do but,
if an opportunity comes along, no
doubt the board would look at it.”
Boral is reputed to have the financial
data on some 100 companies under sur-
veillance in a sophisticated computer
program known as the Interactive
Financial Planning System. They are
either competitors or potential takeover
targets.
Looking at Boral’s main areas of op-
erations:
■ In quarrying, there doesn’t seem to
be room for a really major acquisition,
although there will be further op-
portunities to take over local operations
particularly in Queensland and NSW.
Since balance date, Boral has acquired
the Avon Quarry Group of companies in
the LaTrobe Valley, Victoria.
■ In brick and clay products, Boral is
probably the largest operator on the east
coast of Australia, with a bit more than
20 percent of the market in Victoria,
and about 20 percent in NSW, closer to

UNBEATABLE PERFORMANCE.
Whether you compare ABC circulation figures, McNair or Morgan readership figures, the
answers are clearly the same. The Australian Women’s Weekly dramatically outperforms New Idea.
UNBEATABLE REACH.
The dominance of The Weekly is unsurpassed. To achieve a comparative net reach of one issue
of The Weekly will take two to three issues of New Idea depending upon the target audience
selected. This means that to achieve The Weekly’s delivery at $12,800, the new advertising rate
effective with the November issue, it will cost in New Idea somewhere between $16,840 and $25,260.

30 percent in Queensland. This is one
area which may provide further op-
portunities to expand.
■ In concrete, Neal agrees there is
room for rationalisation but he does not
believe it will happen. Behind the big
three Pioneer, Readymix and Boral
the market is crowded with smaller op-
erators and it is very competitive.
■ Liquid natural gas: This market
does not appear to have lived up to its
growth expectations in recent years and
remains fairly static at around 500,000
tonnes a year, of which the Gas and Fuel
Corp of Victoria has about 40 percent
and Boral and Shell each about 25.
■ Overseas operations appear to
offer the best scope for expansion by
acquisition but, while Neal agrees that
the US operations are likely to become a
bigger percentage of the total, overseas
operations are not likely ever to become
dominant in Boral.
“We are a very Australian company,
with 45,000 shareholders of which 98
percent are Australian,” he said.
Further investment in oil and gas ex-
ploration and production would not
surprise, following the recent bid for
control of Oil Company of Australia Ltd
which valued that entity at $B4 million.
Boral has about 64 percent of OCA.
Just as Griffin put Neal through the
hoops and ultimately into the chief
executive’s chair, so he must groom po-
tential successors.
However, he made clear that he had
no early plans to retire.
“The managing director’s job is to
build as strong a team as possible, to
build a pool of strong executives,” he
said. “Then, at the appropriate time, the
board will decide who will replace me.”
Neal (who is also on the board of
Wormald International) is the only
executive director on Boral’s exception-
ally strong board of professional direc-
tors. They include:
■ Chairman Sir Peter Finlay who
chairs the boards of all major sub-
sidiaries and is also chairman of Email,
deputy chairman of AWA and a direc-
tor of the National Australia Bank, Cus-
tom Credit, Cadbury Schweppes and Hy-
gienic-Lily.
■ Keith Halkerston deputy chair-
man and also chairman of Peko Wall-
send and a director of Santos, Cadbury
Schweppes, Mcllwraith Davey and chief
executive of merchant banker Baring
Bros Halkerston.
■ Other board members and their
directorships are: Alan Coogan, Gove
Alumina (chairman) and Peko Wall-
send; Sir Bruce Macklin, Advertiser
Newspapers (chairman), South Austra-
lian Gas Co, Herald and Weekly Times;
Sir John Rowell, Castlemaine Tooheys;

THE CHARTIST
Tasminex stands
out in a flat
mining market
by Russell Lander
REMINISCENCES of the mining
boom of 1968-1970 invariably conjure
up two names, Poseidon and Tasminex.
Poseidon’s magical run to $2BO was
based on the Windarra nickel discovery
whereas Tasminex’s astonishing run up
to $9O (adjusted on the chart to $72 to
reflect subsequent issues) was founded
on the fleeting belief that the company
had made a nickel discovery bigger than
Poseidon’s. So much for history.
The monthly range on Tasminex
shows that the stock has been in a pri-
mary uptrend since the middle of 1982,
having risen sixfold in the interim. The
price has outrun any projections which
could have been made on the basis of
the measurement of the reversal pattern
and is within an ace of eclipsing the
stock’s best level since the mining boom
the $1.46 set in October 1978.
The fundamentals behind the neat
and sustained Tasminex uptrend are to
do with the Kara Tungsten desposit
near Burnie, Tasmania. Tasminex has a
50 percent interest in the property, the
other party being Mclntyre Mines which
has undertaken an extensive study of
the prospect.
Tasminex has until October 15 this
year to elect to maintain its 50 percent
interest in the joint venture develop-
ment which is expected to cost some
$5.7 million (Tasminex $2.85 million)
or to take a 20 percent carried interest.
On August 20, it was announced that
Hampton Areas Australia NL had sold
its 19.99 percent stake in Tasminex but
the buyer or buyers have not yet come
to light.

The tiny portable computer you see below can
do everything the average desktop can do* And more*
Meet the EPSON® PX-8*
We believe this is the first real computer you
could call a “portable”.
As you can see, it's smaller than a transportable
and considerably lighter - weighing 2*3 kg. Yet at the same
time, it has a massive 64K RAM (expandable to 184 K), a
full 80-character Liquid Crystal Display and an excellent
full-sized keyboard*
Normally you'd expect to find those specifica-
tions on a desktop computer*
But there's more. The EPSON PX-8 has
inbuilt business software for word processing, graphics,
speadsheet, communications and many more custom
programmes on simple plug-in ROM units* It also uses
an extended version of Microsoft Basic and a CP/M*
operating system - which means you have access to one
of the world's largest software bases*
As well, the EPSON PX-8 can be used as a low
cost, space saving, intelligent terminal that can be plugged
directly into a mainframe or any high performance micro-
computer like the EPSON QX-10*
And then it has features which you will never
find on a desktop* Rechargeable NiCad batteries (with
built-in back-up batteries to preserve data with a trickle
of current until you resume operation). An inbuilt micro-
cassette recorder for data storage while you're on the
move. In fact, everything you would require for complete
portability* The EPSON PX-8 and screen folds into a
book-sized package that easily fits inside your briefcase.
PERIPHERALS. The EPSON PX-8 is more
than just the first portable that performs like a desktop.
A complete range of portable peripherals has
been designed to go with it.
There is a 3.5" battery-operated floppy disk
unit with 360 K formatted capacity. (There is also a
standard 5.25" mains-driven version.)
There is a battery-operated Acoustic Coupler
which allows you to use any phone - even the one in
your car - as a direct communication line to your office
or national data base.
There are 60K and 120 K battery-operated
RAM packs which can be permanently added to the
PX-8, greatly enhancing its memory capacity, without
sacrificing its portability.
There is also the EPSON P4O compact
thermal printer which operates on NiCad batteries, as
well as a complete range of dot matrix printers.
Personal computing has just taken a great
leap forward. Although the EPSON PX-8 was designed
from the ground up as a portable computer, ifs going to
make a lot of desktops look like dinosaurs.
And at only sl,3oo** you could very easily
make it your secret of success.

man); and Frank J. Sweeney, City
Mutual, Ballarat Brewing and the Gas
and Fuel Corp of Victoria.
That is the team of heavyweights
who ultimately will decide the pea for
one of the top corporate jobs in Austra-
lia if and when Neal stands down.
The most likely candidates will be
drawn from the seven chief general
managers of Boral’s major subsidiaries
or divisions.
Could it be Roger Pysden, in his
mid-40s, who joined Boral seven years
ago from an executive position at rival
Monier? He has a marketing back-
ground and last year was switched from
being manager Boral Concrete Products
to become chief general manager Boral
Bricks.
Then there is Bruce Kean (51), who
has been chief GM of both the gas and
brick operations and last year moved to
chief GM of Boral Cyclone Ltd. He is a
chemical engineer who joined Boral 16
years ago.
Another potential starter is civil en-
gineer Terry Oakes-Ash (47). From na-
tional concrete manager, he became
chief GM of Boral Resources Ltd and
last year switched to chief GM of BMI
Ltd, which manages all concrete and
quarrying in NSW.
David Sullivan (60) conversely
swapped places last year from BMI Ltd
to Boral Resources Ltd, which manages
concrete and quarrying in all other
states but NSW.
Kevin McCall (60) is chief GM of
Australian Gypsum Industries Ltd the
plasterboard making subsidiary and
also responsible for timber operations
and steel.
Don Bone (54) is a mechanical en-
gineer who 35 years ago joined the en-
gineering subsidiary N. J. Hurll and Co
(Aust) Pty Ltd, where he is chief GM.
The seventh chief general manager is
46-year-old Peter McDonell, a first-class
honors graduate in Law from the Uni-
versity of Adelaide who became Mobil’s
NSW marketing manager, joined Boral
12 years ago and is chief GM of Boral
Gas Ltd.
One of the five lieutenants in the 40-
50 age bracket is favored for the suc-
cession with some possible starters
among the corporate staff including:
Brian Saunders (50), general manager
of corporate development, now doing a
course in international corporate plan-
ning in Zurich, Switzerland; and John
Leeman, general manager, finance, who
at 44 has spent 24 years with Boral.
Leeman won praise from Neal last
week for being in charge of a head office
team that was able to produce a con-
solidated, audited profit statement in-
volving 170 subsidiaries including
more than 100 trading worldwide
only eight weeks after the end of the
financial year. □
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Months of action in prospect
ABROLHOS Oil and Investments Ltd
will give share punters a good run for
their money over the next few months.
The company is participating in 11
wells to be drilled between September
and May. One of the most interesting is
the first the Lynwood No 1 due to
spud any time now, on ATP 270, in
south-western Queensland. This block
overlies the Cooper/Eromanga basins
immediately to the north of excellent oil
flows reported last week.
Once the Lynwood well is underway,
interest focused on the companies ac-
tive over the Queensland areas of the
Eromanga Basin should rub off on Ab-
rolhos’ stock market rating.
Followers of oil reports in the daily
press will recall that a consortium
headed by Hudbay last week reported a
new onshore flow record for Australia
when the Bodalla South No 2 well
flowed an aggregate 5928 barrels a day
from two separate formations. This well
is on ATP 269 P, immediately south of
the block on which the Abrolhos con-
sortium will drill.
Some 60 km south-west of the
Bodalla South No 2 well, another con-
sortium led by Hartogen reported
last week an encouraging flow of 2520
barrels a day from Tintaburra No 2.
(One of the portfolio stocks, Home En-
ergy, has a 10 percent interest in this
block and although the share price
firmed on early news of the find it weak-
ened later as the market realised that the
flow was through a one-inch choke with
a surface flow pressure down to 601b/sq
in. While still very pleasing, it doesn’t
rank with the Bodalla South find where
the well flowed through a half-inch
choke at 2633 barrels a day with a sur-
face flow pressure of 135 psi from the
Jurassic sands and at 3295 barrels a day
with a surface flow pressure of 223 psi
from the Hutton formation.
Abrolhos has an interest of 15 per-
cent in the forthcoming Lynwood No 1.
Crusader (50 percent) is the operator
and other participants are Utah (15 per-
cent), the unlisted Ladd Oil (16), Sover-
eign (5) and lan Sykes’ XLX Petroleum
retains an 18.75 percent overriding roy-
alty.
Within a month of the Lynwood well
spudding, Abrolhos also is to feature in
the drilling of another well in the area
the Pinkilla No 1, 60 km south-east of
the Bodalla South No 1, on ATP 298 P.
Abrolhos had a 6 percent participating
interest in this block which has since
transferred to Victoria Exploration NL
in exchange for $1 million plus a re-
tained 15 percent net profit interest on
the 6 percent farmout.
All up, for the period to next May,
Abrolhos is participating in 11 wells
plus nearly 1300 km of seismic surveys.
Abrolhos has on issue 80.697 million
fully-paid 20c shares selling at 16c,
which gives the company a market capi-
talisation of $12.9 million. Hawkstone
Investments Ltd holds 46.2 percent of
the capital.
Abrolhos also has 72 million options
exercisable up to December 31, 1986,
which traded late last week at 6c. The
options, with their long life and low
price, pr esent excellent leverage in the
event of a “strike” during the course of
the 11 wells to be drilled.
Apart from that, punters might have
some interest in a well (Fortescue No 1)
being drilled on an area generally re-
garded as non-prospective east of the
Pilbara iron ore province on EP3O4.
The well, with a target depth of 1500
metres, will test a shallow sedimentary
basin where government drillers seeking
water in 1972 recovered below 178
metres rock “oozing oily hydrocarbons”
according to official reports.
The listed Transcontinental Holdings
is earning 47.5 percent drilling the well
for the tenement holder, John Roberts’
Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd. TC
Ltd, at 27c, is valued at $13.75 million
one for the game.

THE MODEST FARMER
A proper way to behave
by Bert Kelly
ECCLES, FRED and I are back home
after looking at Australia’s sick rural in-
dustries.
Fred returned satisfied that the farm-
ers he had seen on his travels were even
worse off than he was and this made him
as happy as you could expect him to be.
Eccles was happy, too, because he loves
being miserable about industries. I was
the only sad one,.
I suppose I have enough political in-
stincts left to want to be loved by all but
spelling out the problems of sick indus-
tries is not the path to popularity. When
I moaned to Eccles about this, he told
me that becoming unpopular was a
proper way to behave. “You must ex-
pect to be disliked, Bert, if you are do-
ing your duty,” he warned. “Remember
what the famous British economist,
Alfred Marshall, said last century: ‘Stu-
dents of social science must fear popu-
lar approval; evil is with them when all
men speak well of them. It is almost im-
possible for a student to be a true patriot
and have the reputation for being one at
the same time.’ So stop being sorry for
yourself, Bert. You are not the first per-
son to discover that telling people what
they do not want to hear is not a popu-
lar pastime.”
I suppose Eccles is right. The worst
thing about him is that he usually is.
In the middle of April we began four
articles setting out the problems and
general principles that we expected to
run into. Some of these were the inabil-
ity of governments to set wise produc-
tion goals, the dangers inherent in pro-
duction quotas and cost of production
marketing arrangements. There were
some plaintive pleas that some industry
leaders found it difficult to understand
the convolutions in their own industries,
let alone in others. You can imagine
then how nervous members of parlia-
ment must feel about exposing their ig-
norance in public. This is why some in-
dustries have got into the mess they are
in; no one has been game to give them
the nasty medicine they need.
And remember what the Tasmanian
Dairy Council said about its industry:
“The whole system results in advantages
for organisations and companies who
are represented on boards and commit-
tees and, in doing so, tends to divide the
industry into those ‘in the know’ and
those on the outside.”
Having got all that off our chests, we
did four articles about the Riverland,
three on dairying, two each on eggs and
sugar and one each on rice and tobacco.
What did we find?
There was one common problem
the damage done by the European
Economic Community to all our indus-
tries. Although it may make us feel bet-
ter to castigate their wickedness,
nothing we can say or do will alter them
particularly when we are not
lilywhite. We will just have to adjust our
production to their perfidy, unless we
are prepared to go to war or something.
A pathetic belief persists that govern-
ment and industry groups can set wise
production goals. Limitations on pro-
duction are set by allotting quotas, en-
titlements or assignments to particular
producers while denying them to others.
This worries me more than it appears to
worry producers, though we should re-
alise that it is the industry leaders
those with quotas who speak for their
industries. The poor sods who are de-
nied quotas are hard to hear; they are
usually scared of criticising their indus-
try leaders for fear of being regarded
when the next quotas are handed out as
not being fit and proper persons.
However, apart from the morality
problem of giving one person a quota
while denying one to his neighbor, there
is a bigger problem in the system. A let-
ter from a representative of the sugar
millers said: “Production in the sugar
industry is controlled to regulate output
to meet available markets.” Well, their
efforts have been singularly unsuccess-
ful as this table shows.

Prices have fluctuated widely while
production remains about the same.
When the price was $lBB in 1977, pro-
duction was almost the same as in 1980
when the price was $375. I am not criti-
cal of them for making mistakes I
make them all the time but I am criti-
cal of their thinking they can give wiser
guidance than the market signals.
My mistakes are cancelled out by the
mistakes of other farmers, some of
which are often in opposite directions.
But the mistakes that industries and
governments make are always big ones.
Also, the desire to be popular is usually
stronger than the desire to be right.
Most of the industries in trouble
were heavily regulated. The question is:
Was this cause or effect? □

Presenting the NCR Tower.
This year, a lot of businesses will go out and buy
personal computers only to discover thousands of dollars
later that they need something more to handle their
problems. Something more powerful. More
expandable. More economical.
That something is the NCR Tower.
When Personal Computers
Aren’t Powerful Enough.
Compare the Tower with a personal computer
like the IBM XT and you’ll find there’s no
comparison.
The Tower processes information at
twice the speed. It comes with over four times
the storage capacity. It can stand alone or as part of a large"
distributed data processing network. It runs all the different
types of software that personal computers do. And a whole
lot more. They can help you control inventory better.
Run a data processing department better.
Even manage a nationwide network of hospitals or auto
parts stores better.
In short, whether you run a small business, a
I
department of a large business or a nationwide network
of businesses, the Tower will help you do business
better. Why does the Tower perform so well?
Because it’s built so well.
It is powered by the Motorola 68000, one of
the most powerful 16-bit micro-processors around.
It comes with other guarantees of high performance
like a Winchester hard disc and the Intel Multibus*
And it offers you the UNIX* operating system.
So it’s simple enough for general
managers (just plug it in and go) or
sophisticated enough for systems
analysts (you can do your own thing).
When Personal Computers
Aren't Expandable Enough.
Any small business computer will grow as you grow.
■ The question is, how far? The Tower’s storage
capacity expands from 40 million characters to 214 million.
Translated, that means it will hold anywhere from 13,000
to 71,000 pages of text (it’s not for short story writers)
or from 260,000 to 1,420,000 names and addresses
■ Multibus is a registered trade mark of Intel Corporation. UNIX is a registered trade mark of Bell Laboratories." Manufacturer’s recommended price.

.
(you’d better have plenty of friends). Even more important,
up to twelve people can work on the Tower at once with
additional work stations. On different projects.
Or the same project.
When Personal Computers
Aren’t Economical Enough.
Of course, you may save money in the short run by
investing in a personal computer. But if it can’t do
everything you want it to do, it could really cost you in the
long run. What’s more, the Tower becomes more
economical as you add more work stations. With eight
work stations, for example, it ranges from less
than $36,000. Eight IBM XTs, on the other
hand, could cost you $54,304." Networking
them all together would set you back even
more. And you still wouldn’t have anywhere near the power
of the Tower. Quite simply the Tower gives you something
no single personal computer or group of personal
computers can: enough power, expandability and
economy to handle your business problems. Put another
way, the Tower is a computer you can grow into, not out
of. No other machine on the market offers everything it
does at the price it does.
And finally, it comes to you from NCR. A company
committed to applying innovative computer technology to
today’s business problems. And one which offers its
customers support and service from 50 offices
throughout Australia.
For more information contact the following
NCR Tower Dealers or your NCR State Office.

WILDCAT
Bringing home the bacon for CRA
FINDING ANY positives about CRA
Ltd’s future by listening to chairman Sir
Rod Carnegie and his directors at a
gathering of institutional and merchant
bank heads at Sydney’s Regent Hotel
last week was difficult. Carnegie an-
nounced the miner’s 50 percent profit
lift to $31.9 million in the first six
months of the year but could not see
much relief from depressed metal
prices. No one seems to know where
they will go.
Carnegie offered: “I have a number
of people in front of me (CRA direc-
tors) with crystal balls all looking pretty
cloudy at the moment.”
Copper, silver and aluminium prices
were all lower in the latest half than in
the two just before that. The only win-
ners were zinc and lead prices.
Coal was in poor shape, with subsidi-
ary Kembla Coal and Coke recording a
$3.5 million loss and caught with a pro-
duction stockpile of a year valued at
SIOO million and costing $9 million a
year in interest.
Hamersley Holdings was a flickering
bright spot with earnings of $45.5 mil-
lion up 13.6 percent on the same
period of 1983 and good prospects in
the 1984 second half.
But Wildcat did manage to extract
one area of excitement from CRA’s ac-
tivities its research subsidiary Bio-
technology Australia Pty Ltd. The com-
pany into which CRA has injected some
S2O million expects to market its first
product next year. Biotech has no fewer
than 30 PhDs and 34 other university
graduates in a staff of 80.
The product is a vaccine to prevent
pig scouring a chronic disease that
brings on diarrhoea and dehydration in
piglets and causes the deaths of 7 per-
cent of Australian pigs.
Carnegie points out that, in all its
high-technology ventures, CRA is inter-
ested only in products which can com-
pete in the world market. Biotech mana-
ging director David Harrison estimates
the global pig scouring market con-
servatively at SSO million and reckons
Biotech could take at least 10 percent of
that. He says the local vaccine has the
edge on anything overseas.
Float sinks to halfway
THE DEPRESSED gold price has cut
the proposed Gold Securities of Austra-
lia Ltd float in half.
In a revamped prospectus before the
Corporate Affairs Commission, the
underwritten amount has been slashed
from sls to $7.5 million. The maximum
of oversubscriptions also has been
halved to $7.5 million.
GSA originally sought up to S6O mil-
lion through the issue of 60 million $1
shares at par, of which sls million was
underwritten. The joint underwriters
who thought again include the Austra-
lian Resources Development Bank,
brokers Peter Wallman & Co and A. C.
Goode & Co and merchant bankers
Kleinwort Benson Australia.
The prospectus changes were pos-
sible through escape clauses allowing
the underwriters to terminate the issue
including the AASE metals index fall-
ing below 450 and the London Metals
Exchange price of gold piercing
SUS3SO. Both levels have been breached
on several occasions since the prospec-
tus was issued.
GSA is a specialist gold investment
vehicle. It plans to invest in bullion,
shares in Australian and overseas gold
producers, put and call options on gold
companies, futures (for hedging only),
bonds and other gold-related invest-
ments.
GSA’s “piggy-back” option is one of
the attractions of the float.
Options will be offered at 1 cent each
on a one-for-one basis, exercisable at $1
a share any time up to June 1987. When
he exercises an option, a holder receives
another option exercisable at $1.25 at
any time up to June 1989. The options
make good sense for those who think
that gold is likely to have a run some
time in a five-year period.
Basket of technologies
WITH FEW exceptions the notable
one being the mercurial Vapocure the
best course for holders of high-technol-
ogy shares has been to stag at least part
of their holding on the first day of
listing.
Your broker, of course, must act fast.
The performance of Newtech Develop-
ment Corporation, which has a basket of
technologies including a gallium arsen-
ide substance for use in semi-conductor
chips, is perhaps the best example.
Newtech, with 16.4 million vendor
shares and 15.9 million ordinary shares
on issue, listed at a top price of $1.60
last month and has settled to 95 cents.
Most stags sold out for $1.30 to $1.40.
Other stocks such as Memtec Ltd and
Gene Link Ltd (formerly Gentech Ltd)
have had similar but less dramatic share
price movements. The newest high-tech
stock exchange entry, International
Food Technology Ltd (IFT) came on
over 50 cents late last month but has
settled to just above a par price of 40
cents a share. Along with another hope-
ful, Hitek Ltd, which issued a prospec


tus last week, IFT is looking to sell new
food technologies internationally.
Hitek has developed two patented
technologies, cuspation and cuspa-
tion/dilation. A type of thermoforming
of plastics, the technology has distinct
advantages over other plastics produc-
tion. Advantages include lower material
and production costs, continuous pro-
cessing and lighter and stronger con-
tainer quality.
Underwritten by Potter Partners, the
float is seeking $3.45 million through 6.9
million 50 cent shares with a further
16.1 million shares issued to interests as-
sociated with the directors. Hitek has a
joint venture arrangement with ACI for
the worldwide marketing of the pro-
cesses outside Australia and New Zea-
land where ACI subsidiary Nylex Corp
has exclusive rights.
Licence agreements have been
signed with major companies in the
United Kingdom, United States and
Canada. Hitek’s major opportunity ap-
pears to be a licence agreement with the
world’s largest food packaging com-
pany (turnover $5.5 billion), Continental
Packaging Company Inc of the US. CPC
has ordered a plastic forming machine,
under construction in Australia.
Hitek expects to deliver the machine
this year when full production trials are
due to start.
A large part of Hitek’s income is to
come from royalties from licensees. A
shareholder can gauge a rough idea
from the prospectus of royalties that
may flow to the company worldwide.
PA Consulting services estimates the
total market value of the dry-food,
metal can market in the US, western
Europe, Japan and Australia at about
$1.6 billion.
For each 1 percent market share it
gained, Hitek would earn royalties (at
2.5 percent net) of $245,000 a year.
Total royalties from margarine, ice
cream, yoghurt, cans and drainage
products are estimated at $783,000 an-
nually for each 1 percent.
If the dry liquid/moist canned food
area is included in the available can
market, the total is worth $8.2 billion
according to PA. It points out that sig-
nificant development work will be
required to penetrate the dry
liquid/moist can market. □
Reward for valor
CREDIT for the remarkable success of
Kidston Gold Mines Ltd, which gave
stags handsome profits last week,
should go in no small measure to Bris-
bane broker Wilson and Co, and par-
ticularly its principal, John Wilson.
Wilson stepped into the breach when
Ord Minnett, and some others wilted
like last month’s gold price. He kept the
exercise alive.
Fortune, justly, favors the bold.
CHESS
Getting to know your onions
by Terrey Shaw
THE STUDY of chess, according to my
ever-philosophical mate Karl Kibitzer,
is like peeling an onion: removing each
layer of obscurity only reveals another
layer underneath and you tend to
shed a lot of tears in the process.
Many players become confused be-
cause they don’t realise that the middle
game and end game are two distinct
phases, each requiring the application
of totally different principles.
In particular, the ideas governing the
Rook and the King undergo a peculiar
reversal. In the crowded board condi-
tions of the opening and middle game
your Rooks don’t often get much activ-
ity and your King hides as quietly as
possible in the corner.
The end game brings about a striking
metamorphosis, with both King and
Rook adopting decidedly higher pro-
files. Your monarch can be centralised,
like any other piece, and your Rooks
tend to rush almost of their own volition
towards the enemy’s seventh rank.
An active Rook and King often are
more than adequate compensation for
being a pawn or two down it’s notori-
ously difficult to convert extra material
into a win in such endings. However, as
a result of bitter experience, Karl Kib-
itzer has develped his own philosophy
on this too. According to Karl, Rook
endings a pawn up always tend to be
drawn but Rook endings a pawn down
are invariably lost.
The genius of Cuba’s Raoul
Capablanca was never more evident
than in Rook endings. This game from
the 1924 New York tournament is gen-
erally recognised as a masterpiece.

De ja vu
”IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE ,SIR—
WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY
FOR A NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE"
QUEENSLAND police are
investigating a repeat of the
Russel Island scandal of 1978
in which a Moreton Bay
island subdivision of man-
grove swamps was foisted on
unsuspecting buyers.
The two year hearing of the
resulting charges ended as a
mistrial. During the case one
surveyor gave evidence that
he was unable to check survey
pegs because “it was a very
high tide that day.”
One of the 16 defendants
charged with conspiracy to
defraud the public over
Russel Island has recently re-
emerged as the figure behind
two coastal land develop-
ments north of Brisbane,
where unserviced blocks are
being retailed to the public.
Censor’s help for tribunal hits a snag
THE FILM Censorship
Board has not had an increase
in its staff numbers, yet soon
will have to classify video
tapes under a new compul-
sory scheme. An estimated
25,000 tapes will require
classification in the first full
year of operation of the
scheme.
The board classifies im-
ported television programs
submitted by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation, by
the commercial stations and
by independent distributors
the Special Broadcasting Ser-
vice (0/28) does its own classi-
fying.
The board is not strictly
obliged to do the TV program
classifying but does so under
a delegation from the Austra-
lian Broadcasting Tribunal
which legally is responsible
for carrying out the work.
Chief censor Janet
Strickland went on the public
record in August to express
surprise that an independent
statutory body such as the
ABC would want an outside
body doing its work when no
legislative requirement exists
that the ABC submit imported
programs to anyone else.
Without additional staff,
the board may have to ask
that the delegation be with-
drawn and that the tribunal
take on the classifications. In
such an event, it seems unlike-
ly that the tribunal could
carry out the task.
Some degree of self-regula-
tion has been suggested to
permit the commercial TV
stations to do their own classi-
fication of imported programs
as they classify those that are
locally made.
It’s all go!
WE THOUGHT Queensland
could go one better: A sign
over a new takeaway food
place near Yawalpa, on the
Gold Coast Highway, reads:
FASTER FOOD!
Temple of hope
THE NEW Mormon temple
in Carlingford, Sydney, open
to the public for the first and
last time (after it is dedicated,
it will be open only to the
faithful dressed in white), is
not quite finished. The church
is battling the local council for
permission to mount a man-
sized fibreglass angel on the
spire of the $4 million build-
ing. An independent body
will probably have to settle
the dispute but the church is
showing faith the angel is
made and in a box on site, ac-
cording to Parramatta stake
president Ron Innis.
Taking CER too far
ONE OF the first election sou-
venirs from the Liberal Party
is a large blue and white
ballpoint pen with the party’s
logo prominently displayed.
It’s stamped: “Made in New
Zealand.”
We all know the last Fraser
Government pioneered the
Closer Economic Relations
agreement. But this is surely
taking it a little far?


Numbers are in the frame
NEWSPAPERS generally are
inclined to get a mite touchy
when their circulation figures
are questioned. For heights of
eloquence on this matter, we
give the palm to the Sunday
Observer of Sri Lanka, which
has been warring with the
Island.
In a recent front-page box,
headed “Stick to the figures,”
the Observer said: “Cheap
puns and chop logic are hard-
ly the devices one would ex-
pect of a newspaper claiming
superlative splendours for it-
self in much plainer language.
The Island’s reply to our facts
on circulation was a damp
squib, if it was anything at all.
“One clearly must not con-
fuse cause with effect when
studying the Sunday Ob-
server’s statement that because
of our higher sales we attract
the most advertising.
“If the obituaries have
their own message for our
contemporaries, so let it be.
But let them not disturb the
dead in their rest nor slink in
the shadows of innocent rag-
tag and bob-tail or scare-
crows to get away from a
straight challenge. We repeat
the latter.
“If they deny that our Cir-
culation figures exceed their
own by 40,000 and more, as
shown in our table, let them
challenge us before the Press
Council or support their
own claim with audited fig-
ures.
“Surely our reading public
can recognise the truth? We
have heard of drunken men
clinging to empty bottles,
even empty labels, but not
drowning men, not quite as
yet!”
-The Australian, August 30
Robin Hood gets
the treatment
Judi Trott and Michael Praed in Robin of Sherwood
THE mythbreakers have been
at work again, shattering the
legends everyone grew up
with. The latest target is
Robin Hood.
Robin Hood, we are about
to be told in a new TV series,
was not the happy-go-lucky
do-gooder who robbed the
rich to give to the poor.
Rather, he was a resistance
fighter conducting a campaign
against the Norman op-
pressors of the Saxons a
Middle Ages Chairman Mao.
His “Merry Men” were not
a jolly lot who sat round
strumming lutes and occa-
sionally poaching the king’s
deer: They were a fierce crew
who took great pride in their
martial skills and their
weapons.
Such is the picture which
emerges in Robin Oj
Sherwood, a five-part series to
be shown on the Channel 9
network. The series will be
shown in Sydney next week
and later in other cities.
The most drastic character
revision involves Good King
Richard. We wouldn’t want to
give too much away but it can
be said that Richard and
Robin do not end up the best
of chums.
The Channel 9 people tell
us that this adult version of
the Robin Hood saga includes
much romance. Are they try-
ing to suggest that Marion was
not a maiden?
Thankfully, one character
remains unchanged. The
Sheriff of Nottingham is still a
baddie.

by Michael Lloyd
The ease with which top expo-
nents take points off unseasoned
players is truly astounding. In
comparison, taking candy from
babies requires the skill of compli-
cated neurosurgery.
The number of times I’ve
watched seasoned players pass the
cube (often accompanied by a
phrase such as, “Ah, well it’s a bit
risky but I’ll give it a go”) and
been absolutely dumbfounded to
hear their opponent accept.
Look at the illustration it’s
quite a common occurrence.
White had been behind in the
race, waiting for a hit which never
eventuated. When all chances of
the hit had gone, White got his
men home as fast as he could.
It wasn’t as one-sided a race as
it may now appear, except on the
previous roll. Black threw a
double 5, allowing him to bear-off
three men. White countered by
bringing home his remaining men.
It is Black to roll and he smoothly
doubles. Is it a take?
White might think he’s in with
a chance but, frankly, his victory
possibilities are nothing short of
illusory. The cube, on 2, is being
passed to him on 4 to accept
would be to give Black the easiest
2 points of his career.
Black has borne-off three men
already; his distribution is such
that it is unlikely he will miss on
subsequent rolls he will clear
therefore in six more rolls.
As it’s Black to roll and he (as
we have just seen) will be finished
in six rolls, White has five rolls left,
with which to snatch the game. He
has fifteen men and five rolls to
go, which means he must roll at
least three lots of doubles in the
next five rolls, assuming of course
that Black doesn’t roll any. He’s so
far behind it’s not funny a take
shouldn’t even be considered.

Opening lead king of clubs.
ONE OF the most important prin-
ciples of dummy play is founded
on what is called Murphy’s Law.
According to this law, declarer as-
sumes that anything that can go
wrong will go wrong.
Here is an examples of the
principle at work. West leads a
club against four spades and
declarer wins with the ace. South
then plays the ace of spades and,
after both defenders follow low,
continues with the two of spades!
It is obvious from South’s low
trump play that he is a firm be-
liever in Murphy’s Law. He makes
this play because he realises that
the only real threat to the contract
is the possibility of finding the
trumps divided 4-1.
So, in an effort to guard
against this danger, South plays a
low trump at trick three. When
West shows out, declarer plays the
nine from dummy losing the
trick to East’s jack. Declarer later
enters dummy with a diamond
and takes a trump finesse to wrap
up the contract. His only losers
are two diamonds and one trump.
Note that South loses nothing
by his two of spades play if the
trumps prove to be divided 3-2.
The opponents get a trump trick
early, rather than late, and the
safety play proves to be unneces-
sary.
Note also that the safety play is
ineffective if it turns out that West,
instead of East, holds the Q-J-8-4
of trumps. Even Murphy’s Law
would not help in that case be-
cause the contract would go down
whatever South did. Actually, this
possibility should be ignored by
declarer who concerns himself
only with matters over which he
can exercise control.
