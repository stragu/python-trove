THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Aboriginal claims
Because more than half the politicians
in the federal government represent
New South Wales and Victoria, brutal
expediency makes the government see
all issues from the point of view of these
states.
Half of Western Australia is under
claim from Aborigines at present. The
same applies in the Northern Territory.
There is an irony here. When the white
man came to this country, the Aborigi-
nal population was concentrated in the
fertile south-east of the country (New
South Wales and Victoria). One would
assume that sacred sites would be most
numerous in these areas. If 50 percent
of Western Australia is up for grabs, I
can’t understand why a greater percent-
age of New South Wales and Victoria
should not be claimed by Aborigines.
But Aborigines and their advisers
practise an expediency similar to that of
the federal government. They know that
they can take from the weaker states
what they would never be granted by
the stronger.
Justice should demand that, if we do
not allot land to the Aborigines on the
basis of the density of their occupation
of land at the time of white settlement,
we should at least allot an equal propor-
tion from each state.

naming individuals without attempting
to check with me as chairman of the
company, is inexcusable and grossly un-
fair to individuals. The fact that the in-
formation was in error only compounds
the fault.
Santos had only one consultant
involved (not two, as you reported) and
that consultant no doubt approached a
number of people to ascertain whether
they had any interest in the position. As
is normal, many people declined for
their own reasons.
The decision to appoint Ross Adler
was taken at the Santos board meeting
on July 3; that is, some six weeks prior
to the date of your article. No negotia-
tions were held with or offers made to
any other individual. No other individ-
ual indicated a willingness to accept any
offer.

Perhaps it is because the Goodwood Park was
originally built as an elite club for the comfort and
recreation of its members.
Or perhaps it is because we have always taken
great care to preserve the elegant structure of the
original building.
Then, it could also be that the Goodwood Park
stands on sprawling green lawns, yet is a mere stone’s
throw from Orchard Road.
Adding to all this is our most recent remodelling
programme. We have not only refurnished the rooms
in soothing pastel shades, but also added little touches
like an electronic key system and remote control
television. Thus has been created a sublime balance of
grand hotel heritage and very modern amenities.
Quite simply, the Goodwood Park Hotel is unique.

Human dignity
As an Australian who has been studying
in the United States for the past three
years and who now plans to return to
Australia with a disabled wife, I looked
with sadness at the picture of Justice
Watson being carried in his wheelchair
by four burly men down a flight of
stairs.
Perhaps if the Australian Govern-
ment, instead of talking about equal op-
portunity and equal access, were to start
taking some action as they have done
here in the US, Justice Watson, my wife
and thousands of other disabled Austra-
lians would be able to live independent
lives.
It is a violation of human dignity to
have to say: “There is no ramp into this
building; please carry me up those
stairs.”

Don’t hold your breath
I agree with Nick Erby’s belief in the
potential for radio networking (B,
August 28) but don’t hold your breath.
In a special budget program from
2CA Canberra last week, I had as my
studio guests Prime Minister Hawke,
Paul Keating, Andrew Peacock, Don
Chipp and Eric Risstrom. No Mac-
quarie station, apart from 3AW, picked
up an offer to broadcast it not even
the Canberra station.

don’t even fire the guns you’ve got?

Locating and evaluating the vast mineral
resources at Olympic Dam in South Australia has
meant years of hard, constant work.
The next stage in the project could well mean
more work for many other Australians.
Before you can develop the deposits of copper,
uranium, gold and silver, you first need to develop a
new way of life in this harsh, isolated area.
SSBM/8P245
Already, roads are being constructed, and a
new town is being planned to house 9,000 people.
Taking part in the Olympic Dam ,
project is just one more way that BP I
Australia is continuing to invest in this
country’s potential, and its future.

AUSTRALIA
The Quiet Achiever.


He is as spring rain to a farmer but,
Bert, the sugar industry is not the way
you attempted to caricature in “Sugar
sweet and sour” (B, August 21).
Production in the sugar industry is
controlled in order to regulate output to
meet available markets on an annual
basis and to conform to the obligations
undertaken by the commonwealth
under the International Sugar Agree-
ment. Production control is managed
through a land-licensing system known
as assignments and both cane farmers
and sugar millers have production
quotas known as peaks.
However, you and Eccles are avid
students of Industries Assistance Com-
mission reports and know that all of
that basic information is available from
two recent lAC reports into the sugar
industry: No 332 of 1983 and No 209 of
1979.
The Central Sugar Cane Prices
Board, presided over by a Supreme
Court judge, must be satisfied as to the
price of terms or conditions of the sale
of an assignment for basic economic
reasons but particularly to avoid in-
flated land values for the purchaser,
which could impinge on domestic
pricing.
The board also has a responsibility
for allocating new assignments and in
the past two decades 1250 new farmers
have come into the sugar industry. Ad-
ditionally, each year some 5 percent of
cane farms change hands many being
sold to new farmers. So please tell Fred
there are farms for sale and, with a rec-
ommendation from Bert Kelly, he
would have little trouble in being ac-
cepted as a fit and proper person to hold
an assignment.
By the way, sugar cane is a perish-
able crop and it is highly desirable to
regulate harvesting of cane to ensure
freshness of cane supply and a resultant
high quality sugar export to all those
markets developed through quality and
reliability.
Perhaps Fred could be induced to in-
vest in sugar milling after he reads the
next article.

Good rowing
The article “Our Olympic heroes the
start of a comeback” (B, August 21)
made one startling omission: the rowing
squad. With three medals (one silver
and two bronze), they equalled the sec-
ond contributor track and field (one
gold, silver and bronze) in number.
They were also equal fourth with West
Germany in the medal count of the 15
medal-winning rowing countries and
each crew improved its times in the fi-
nals, notably the eight (heat 5.56,
repecharge 5.51, final 5.43).
And what a spectacle the final races
provided. The women’s coxed fours and
the men’s eights fought off determined
opposition to win their bronzes while
the quad sculls led all the way to be
overtaken by 0.4 of a second in a photo
finish with West Germany. Neverthe-
less, three sterling efforts.
Now to be parochial: The crews were
all of interstate composites and NSW
had one representative in the quad
sculls and women’s fours, both mem-
bers of St George Rowing Club. They
are the first-ever Olympic rowers from
the club which, at 27 years of age, is the
youngest in the NSW association. Fur-
ther, Tim McLaren of the quad sculls
brought a silver medal to the City of
Wollongong.

Off with the veil
McLachlan’s cartoon “Unfortunately,
our country’s just gone over to Funda-
mental Islam” (B, August 14) is quite
fitting.
The Moroccan winner of the
women’s 400 m hurdles must be a very
proud woman indeed. She not only
clocked an Olympic record of 54.61 sec

The Hilton Experience
In Tokyo:
Something More Than
Tranquility, And More
Than First Class.
V'J

In the midst of Asia’s largest city, and a business
environment which appears to be in perpetual motion,
Hilton has created a tranquil oasis.
In Shinjuku centre a skyscraper city within a
city is a new hotel of quiet distinction. Within its
38-storeys are 858 guest rooms and suites, four
restaurants and three cocktail bars.
A business centre provides a comprehensive array of
services to keep you prepared, informed and in touch.
The top three executive floors feature separate
check-in, bar lounge, snack service and concierge.
Fitness facilities include sauna, gymnasium, indoor
swimming pool and tennis court.
All this and more you’ll find in the new Tokyo Hilton
International. But, above all, you’ll find tranquility,
and an experience that is, in every way, something
more than first class.
For reservations and information call the
Hilton Reservation Service on (008)222255

Disagreement shown
I refer to the public opinion item on

Surely the second paragraph should
have read “but the majority disagreed
with Aboriginal ownership of minerals
found on Aboriginal reserves.”
The table shows a nearly 60/40
national ratio against.

table was correct. Asked whether Aborigi-

Blast for Telecom
John Stewart-Moore (B, August 14) has
voiced the concern of people living
in remote areas with regard to the ap-
palling attitude and behaviour of
Telecom.
Telecom is becoming the major en-
emy of people who choose to live in re-
mote communities so as to develop this
great nation.
The lack of service and its disregard
for communication outside the south-
eastern corner of Australia has left a
large number of Australian citizens at
the mercy of a totally inept organisation
that deals in half truths and manipula-
tion and forgot a long time ago, the re-
sponsibility of communication.
Burketown, on the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, is serviced by Telecom with a
single-strand eight gauge wire line that
runs between Burketown and Norman-
ton, 300 km away.
It is not uncommon for this obsolete
phone system to be out of service for
days at a time. The average waiting time
to be connected to the outside world
can be three to five hours. The odds on
being able to hear the other person
would be five to one and the chances
that the call will “drop out” would be
similar.
Now Telecom is increasing charges
and it isn’t a year since the last increase.
What remote areas will receive from this
increase will still be no service and a
wild and flimsy story about the future of
communications in Australia.

PARIS


For years people in the remote areas
of the Gulf were told the satellite should
be the panacea to all our communica-
tion problems by 1984. We believed it
then and we still do. In fact, from my
position as a potential communications
user in need of up-dated hardware,
Telecom is doing some fancy footwork
by downgrading the satellite in favor of
its own Digital Radio Concentrator Sys-
tem.
The first priority for isolated areas is
a communications system but the sec-
ond is a communications system that
works and last, but not least, a com-
munications system that works all the
time.
It is time that the minister for Com-
munications made a public statement
on how Telecom costings are achieved.

Smoking fire
Lady Bones by Earle Hackett, dissected
by Mary Rose Liverani (B, August 14),
is a thoroughly entertaining tome.
Here is a medical doctor with a great
sense of fun who knows his Greek
alphabeta. Pity, though, his wonderful
command of English, common in the
Irish, produces metaphors such as
smokers “spitting cancer at their fel-
lows” the literal interpretation reveal-
ing the selectivity of this author’s
knowledge of the scientific evidence
concerning smoking and health. He is
indeed solemn when he blames the
deaths of millions on “half a dozen or
so major tobacco companies” and
labels workers in that industry “people
who are killing other people.”
The religious fervor of anti-smoking
is said to be motivated by messianic or
power-seeking desires.
Maybe not Dr Hackett, who de-
scribes smoking as “unbiological” and
“perverted behaviour,” but societies
cope with ambiguities and anomalies
either by attributing danger or in-
corporating into ritual. Smokers and
non-smokers alike view the efforts of
anti-smokers as deviant, rather than
viewing smoking as such.
The suggestion that lung cancer is
somehow related to tobacco company
advertising is an insupportable devi-
ation of an otherwise splendid humor.

No mystery
Regarding the article by Denis
Reinhardt, on HMS Pandora (B, August
14), in which he mentioned La Perouse
as having vanished mysteriously in the
Pacific: “vanished” is correct, “mysteri-
ously” is not.
La Perouse was wrecked on the reef
surrounding the island of Vanikoro, in
the Santa Cruz group of the Solomon
Islands.
The survivors got ashore with stores
and tools saved from the wreck and set
up camp at the mouth of the river.
Here they built a boat from the kauri
pine available nearby. The boat com-
pleted, they embarked and were again
wrecked on the reef. This time, there
were no survivors.

Simple fact
Oh, how absolutely, how desperately I
agree with the Modest Farmer (B,
August 14) when he tells us that the real
value of labor is like the real value of
everything else what the market will
bear.
How, oh how can that simple fact be
inserted into the heads of those into
whose heads it must be inserted if this
country of ours is not to continue its
slippery slide down to Third World,
third rate status?
How long must our workforce, and
our doleforce, be deceived that the fun-
damental law of supply and demand
can be somehow over-ridden by bureau-
crats, the ACTU or Sir John Moore?
How can we make it known absol-
utely, how desperately naked the em-

DRIVE A LEGEND.
The legend began in 1885.
With two brothers and a
bicycle.
By [lB9l, the brothers
Peugeot had turned the bicycle
into the first motor car ever sold
A Peugeot won the very
first car race. Paris to Rouen.
And ever since Peugeots
have won a reputation that’s
legend.
At Le Mans and
Indianapolis. And rallies from
Redex to the East African
Safari.
This latest Peugeot is the
STI. And the legend lives.
The STI will do 0-100 in
just 10.5 seconds. (It’s fuel
injected.)
It takes corners as if on
rails. (Its tyres are MichelinTßX
on alloy rims.)
And it looks like it’s flying
even when it’s standing still.
(Pininfarina styled it.)
Yet it has all the manners
that make Peugeot drivers take
the long way home.
Power steering. Fully
independent suspension.
And seats rated the most
comfortable in the world.
The air conditioning has
a split cycle to keep your face
cool but your feet warm.
The Pioneer FM/AM
stereo radio/cassette is
standard.
So is the central locking
system. And the hydraulically
adjustable headlights. And the
electrically operated front
windows.
No wonder the STI has
become something of a legend
in just a few months.
Test drive a legend. Call
your nearest Peugeot dealer.

fessedly conscientious bands of “do-

And may one ask why they are so
opposed to United States defence instal-
lations in Australia? They tend to forget
that, if it were not for American inter-
vention, Japan would have invaded
Australia in World War II with enor-
mous loss of American lives to prevent
such happening.
And just where would many of these
protesters be today had we lost the war?
Of course, the more astute would have
survived by turning Quisling as did so
many after the Nazi occupation of Eur-

how many would welcome a Soviet

Troubles of a speculator
Will I or won’t I take a punt on the
Speculator’s weekly special?
Over the past few years, I’ve lost a lot
of money buying shares after reading of
grand possibilities for quick profits in
the Speculator’s column. While he
usually does quite well out of his
trading, my timing lacks finesse and I
often make losses.
He has brought me nothing but
trouble. Still I have a soft spot for the
wretch.
He flies his colors proudly, takes his
losses like a man and puts his winnings
straight back on the table.
Oh, what the hell! Look out, widows
and orphans, here I come!
PHILIP LICHTWARK

Holocaust claim wrong
The statement by Phillip Adams (B,
August 21) that I claim the Holocaust
“was a Jewish propaganda trick” is in-
correct.
I have claimed there was a “Holo-
caust” in the sense that more than
750,000 Jews died from all causes
during World War 11, mainly from dis-
eases such as typhus, and there was a
“Holocaust” in the sense that more than
a million German and Japanese civ-
ilians died from saturation bombing.
Research by Professor Butz, Pro-
fessor Faurisson and Dr Staeglich has
established that the extent of the “Holo-
caust” of Jews has been exaggerated
and there is no credible evidence of a
plan to exterminate Jews or of gassings
in gas chambers. I suggest that, if Mr
Adams applied the same standards of
proof to the “gas chamber” and exter-
mination allegations that he applies to
the para normal, he would come to the
same conclusion. He could then call
himself a sceptic.
Although the “Holocaust” of Jews
has been greatly exaggerated, I have
never described it as a “propaganda
trick.”
I have said that the Holocaust is Is-
rael’s number one propaganda weapon,
used on an almost daily basis to pro-
mote support for Israel.

Jews to arms
As a Jew and refugee from nazi terror I,
like thousands of others of my race, am
indebted to Phillip Adams’ masterly ex-
posure of Eric Butler and his League of
Rights whose major objective clearly is
“to deny rights to a lengthening list of
people.”
It may interest some gentile readers
to learn that the overwhelming majority
of those Jewish refugees against
whom Butler ranted in the late 30s
volunteered for and, by early 1942, were
accepted for service in the Australian
army where they tried their best to con-
tribute to the national war effort of the
Curtin and Chifley governments in
my case for almost four and a half
years.
With the Japanese aggressors at Aus-
tralia’s doorstep, our generation of
Jewish refugees (many of them only
teenagers at the time) threw itself
along with everyone else into the na-
tional war effort with a zeal and enthusi-
asm matched only by that of an earlier
generation of Jews who also flocked to
the colors in defence of their mother
country (or fatherland) in another part
of the world from 1914-1918.
What dreadful fate awaited the Jews
of Germany, Austria and many other
European countries only 25 years later?
My father, for instance, a decorated
non-commissioned officer of an Im-
perial Prussian infantry regiment that
fought in northern France during World
War I, was cruelly put to death by SS
mercenaries who had been whipped
into a frenzy of hate by the Eric Butlers
of National Socialist Germany. He,
along with many other members of my
family, was but one of millions of Jews
from Bordeaux to Smolensk and from
Athens to Narvik who suffered a similar
fate between 1938 and 1945.
There is a significant difference, how-
ever, between the earlier and the present
generations of Jews. The former went to
the gallows, the ovens and the
crematoria like sheep to the slaughter.
Those who survived, and others, have
determined that Jewish blood shall
never again be spilled with impunity.

Decker in the wrong
I cannot accept your rather biased atti-
tude toward Zola Budd (B, August 21).
You failed to mention that those thou-
sands who blamed Zola for Mary
Decker’s misfortune were only the wild-
ly-partisan Americans. Many impartial
observers and most Australian daily
papers believe that, if anyone was to
blame for the fall, it was Decker herself.
I feel sorry for Decker. However, I
cannot consider Budd as a villain.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Split decision
THE six-member senate select
committee on the Age Tapes
failed to agree whether the
conduct of High Court Justice
Lionel Murphy should be in-
vestigated. The majority three
Labor senators said it
shouldn’t. Two Liberal sena-
tors said it should and the
sixth, Australian Democrat
Senator Don Chipp, said that
the investigation had to con-
tinue before even a prelimi-
nary finding could be made.
In a further development,
Murphy challenged NSW
Chief Stipendiary Magistrate
Clarrie Briese to bring crimi-
nal charges against Murphy if
Briese persisted with allega-
tions that Murphy tried to in-
terfere with the conduct of a
court case.

year will be $63,948 million
(up 11.5 percent) while re-
ceipts should total $57,203

Ring-in claim
HAYDEN HAITANA, the
trainer at the centre of the
Fine Cotton horse-racing
ring-in scandal in Brisbane,
appeared on TV’s 60 Minutes
and claimed the fraud has
been set up by one of Austra-
lia’s leading bookmakers.
Haitana also claimed his life
and that of his family had
been threatened unless he
took part in the conspiracy.
Trains out
STRIKE action stopped all
trains in three states New
South Wales, South Australia
and Tasmania. In New South
Wales, where the strike
coincided with the school hol-
idays, locomotive drivers de-
cided to stay out for at least 10
days.
Commission opens
THE royal commission into
the British atomic tests con-
ducted in Australia between
1952 and 1963 opened in
Sydney. The three commis-
sioners are Justice James
McClelland, Jill Fitch, senior
health physicist of the South
Australian Health Commis-
sion and Dr William Jonas,
lecturer in geography at the
University of Newcastle. The
session was adjorned after
three different groups claimed
to represent Australian ex-ser-
vicemen allegedly affected by
the tests. Justice McClelland
ruled that the three commis-
sions would have to agree on
a common representative. No
date has been fixed for the
next, sitting.
Army proposal
NEW SOUTH Wales Premier
Neville Wran proposed four
areas for army manoeuvres in
the far west of the State. The
sites, two of about 2 million
hectares, and two of 1 million
hectares are to the north and
west of Cobar and around the
Broken Hill area.

AUSTRALIA
Superannuation scandal:
$2.5 billion unfunded
Over-generous superannuation benefits awarded to government employees,
coupled with inadequate investment policies, have left the NSW government
with a massive unfunded liability, TREVOR SYKES reports.
THE UNFUNDED liability of New
South Wales government superannu-
ation schemes is around $2.5 billion, ac-
cording to an estimate made by the Pub-
lic Accounts Committee. The commit-
tee’s report on the superannuation lia-
bility of statutory authorities, tabled in
state parliament this week, will send
shock waves through the NSW public
service.
The implications are:
■ That past governments have
awarded over-generous superannuation
benefits to their employees without en-
suring that they were properly funded.
■ That the liabilities will continue to
escalate, confronting the authorities
with ever higher bills.
■ That the taxpayers will find them-
selves subsidising the whole
mess to an even greater extent
unless the authorities take
prompt steps to improve both
their funding and investment
policies.
It has been known for
years that NSW, in common
with probably every other
government in Australia, has
a huge and growing unfunded
liability for public service
superannuation.
The committee’s report
contains the first serious at-
tempt to estimate the de-
ficiency. It should be empha-
sised that, depending on fu-
ture factors such as employ-
ment levels and inflation
rates, the estimate of $2.5 bil-
lion could be either too high
or an alarming thought
too low.
Committee chairman Bob
Carr (former industrial rela-
tions writer for The Bulletin)
says the problem investigated
by the committee was one of
undisclosed, inadequately
costed expansion of public
sector superannuation ben-
efits.
“The problem has arisen
because public sector superannuation
has been allowed to become at least two
times as expensive as private sector
superannuation,” he says. “It has been
aggravated by the inadequate disclosure
and costing of increases in public sector
superannuation benefits. As a rule, pub-
lic bodies have not been accounting rig-
orously for their accrued superannu-
ation liabilities and consequently the
unfunded liability has been growing un-
noticed.
“While deferred superannuation
commitments continue to accumulate,
as they will do under present arrange-
ments, the people of NSW are not being
charged the true cost for the goods and
services they consume which are sup-
plied by public authorities. Until these
Public Accounts Committee chairman Bob Carr: investigating
deferred commitments are properly dis-
closed and accounted for, we are living
in a fool’s paradise.
“The issue that strikes me as the most
important of all concerns the proper
costing and public disclosure of
proposed benefit changes. Because the
costs of benefit increases do not have to
be paid for until some time in the dis-
tant future, there seems to be a predis-
position to increase benefits to levels be-
yond what the community can bear.”
The extent of the problem is in-
dicated by the accompanying two tables
from the report. The first table shows
the unfunded liabilities of 22 statutory
authorities in the State Superannuation
Fund. The first column of figures shows
the gross liability for past service. The
second shows the net liability.
The total superannuation
liability of the 22 authorities
at the time they were
examined was $1494 million.
Of this, they have only recog-
nised some $285 million
leaving them unfunded to the
extent of $1209 million.
In reality, the situation is
worse than this because $7B
million of the $285 million
consists merely of internal
provisions and many of these
provisions are only book en-
tries and do not represent
money physically set aside or
invested.
The second table shows the
superannuation liabilities of
14 statutory authorities in the
NSW Retirement Fund. Out
of a gross liability of $707 mil-
lion, they are unfunded for
$655 million. Again, the pic-
ture is worse than it looks be-
cause $47 million of the $52
million gap consists of inter-
nal provisions.
The State Rail Authority is
the biggest offender with a
total liability of $577 million
which is almost entirely un-
funded.

However, the performance of the ter-
tiary institutions is notable. The Univer-
sity of Sydney is unfunded for $166 mil-
lion of its total $197 million. The Uni-
versity of NSW figures are almost iden-
tical. The Newcastle College of Ad-
vanced Education has an unfunded lia-
bility of $lB million out of $2l million.
In the case of Sydney University,
part of the liability arose from its prof-
essorial scheme. Many years ago, as
part of its terms of employment for pro-
fessors, it offered a non-contributory
pension, on retirement after age 60 with
15 years of service, of 25 percent of pro-
fessional salary. The liability was met
on a pay-as-you-go basis and for many
years there had been an unfunded lia-
bility and it was still large despite recent
attempts to build provisions.
The committee report finds that the
large unfunded liability has arisen be-
cause improvements have been made
from time to time in scheme benefits
without corresponding increases being
made in contributions. Further, the in-
adequate accounting procedures of
statutory authorities have prevented the
increasing liabilities from becoming
public knowledge.
Under current funding arrangements
for the state superannuation scheme as
a whole, the annual cash payments by
employers were projected to increase by
136 percent in real terms from 1983 to
the year 2012 and to continue to in-
crease.
A major component of the unfunded
liability is accounted for by automatic
indexation of superannuation pensions
to the Consumer Price Index.
Largely for this reason, the scale of
superannuation payments had risen
dramatically in NSW in recent years.
Employer payments had doubled from
$9O million in 1978-9 to $lB3 million in
1982-3.
To paint this black picture a little
darker, the committee was also con-
cerned about the relatively poor invest-
ment performance of the state funds.
This is an important factor because their
shortfall will be even greater than the
estimated $2.5 billion if the funds are
earning significantly less than the norm
on their investments.
Part of this inadequate performance
has been caused by statutory restrictions
on the investment powers of the funds.
The committee has recommended that
restrictions on state investment fund
managers should be removed, apart
from restrictions on internal invest-
ments, and that the authorities should
be allowed to employ professional fund
managers from both the public and pri-
vate sector.
To help prod the authorities along
in this direction, the committee’s next
inquiry will be into their investment
practices. □


SCIENCE
‘Bone rights’
now an issue in
Tasmania, too
NEWS LIMITED
Professor John Mulvaney: likened burning the bones to Nazi book burning
By TIM DUNCAN
FULLY AWARE that its decision may
lead to the destruction of ancient Abor-
iginal sub-fossil remains, the Tasmanian
government has decided to hand over to
local Aboriginal groups all its museum
holdings of human skeletal material.
Although the government says that it
hopes Aborigines will take scientific
considerations into account, the
chances of that are slight. Aborigines,
archaeologists and government officials
contacted by The Bulletin all agree that
Tasmania’s archaeological heritage
probably will be burned if the govern-
ment goes ahead with its enabling legis-
lation.
The cabinet decision to hand over the
remains requires changes to the state’s
museums legislation and parliament is
expected to vote for the changes during
the second week of September.
At risk are remains from Eagle Hawk
Neck, including two complete skulls
and some post-cranial remains prob-
ably 9000 years old; remains from New
Year Island whfch are probably 6000
years old; and almost-complete skeletal
material, probably 4300 years old, from
Mount Cameron West. These are irre-
placeable. They are the evidence for es-
tablishing the racial links between Tas-
manian and mainland Aborigines
which provide an essential context for
evaluating the cultural contrasts be-
tween the island and continental
societies.
The remains are of tremendous inter-
national scientific significance.
Rising seas separated Tasmania from
continental Australia about 10,000 years
ago. Isolated at the end of the last ice
age, the Tasmanian Aborigines re-
mained cut off for longer than any other
known group. Research on the remains
at risk, however, shows that no physical
contrasts emerged during that time of
isolation.
According to Dr Alan Thorne, who
has worked on some of the remains,
these findings contradict evolutionary
theories which predict that physical
differences should result from environ-
mental differences.
Thorne says that the remains help
define what was a genuine Tasmanian
Aborigine. They show, he argues, that
the major differences between mainland
and islander Aborigines were cultural
and not physical.
The minister responsible for Tas-
mania’s museums is John Beswick. He
is the Minister for Education. Professor
John Mulvaney, Australia’s pioneering
pre-historian from the Australian Na-
tional University, told The Bulletin re-
cently that burning of their ancestors by
contemporary Aborigines could be
likened to the burning of books that
took place in Germany in the 19305.
Beswick said that “human consider-
ations outweigh whatever scientific
value the remains may have.” Asked if
such a view might contradict his res-
ponsibilities, as Education Minister, for
the teaching of Tasmanian Aboriginal
pre-history or for the training of Abor-
iginal curators, Beswick replied that
most of the material had been in the
care of the state’s museum for some time
and that scientists had had ample time
to work on it.
Such an outlook displays little ap-
predation of how anthropological re-
search takes place.
Evidence is not normally destroyed
once it has been employed in support of
an interpretation: it is kept to enable
better interpretations in the light of any
new theories or with the help of new
dating techniques.
The Gray government has not been
on side with the anthropological com-
munity since the battle over the Frank-
lin dam. Mulvaney, for instance, was in-
strumental in publicising the existence
of ancient Aboriginal caves at the dam
site and anthropologists are concerned
that Premier Gray is unfairly discount-
ing their views.
They do not understand how the
government could entertain the possi-
bility that remains not cremated thou-
sands of years ago might suddenly be
subject to a “traditional cremation”
when cremation obviously was not tra-
ditionally universal.
The anthropologists feel that the
ancient remains have little relationship
with the contemporary Aboriginal com-
munity in Tasmania, which is over-
whelmingly of mixed race.
The government says that its consul-
tation with Tasmanian Aborigines
showed they were united in favor of
cremation of all remains. However, a
spokesman for Gray told The Bulletin
that the consultation had been made
only with the Crowther collection in
mind. That collection was put together
as a result of digging up the remains of
known historical persons and the
anthropologists are saying that the col-
lection should be returned. It seems,
however, that the Gray government has
gone overboard and decided to give
away the lot.
Cheryl Brown, speaking on behalf of
the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, said
that the Aboriginal community
welcomed the opportunity to cremate
the ancient remains. “They were once
human beings, they have suffered
enough and they should be put to rest,”
she said.
Asked if future Aboriginal scholars
might curse the day that such a heritage
had been destroyed, she said she
doubted whether Aboriginal people
ever would regard the remains as scien-
tific objects.
But why cremate remains that were
not cremated in the first place?
“If they were re-buried, there would
be nothing to prevent them being dug
up again. Cremation is the only
answer,” she said.
In Tasmania, as in Victoria, bone
rights have apparently become a substi-
tute for land rights.
The Gray government is implacably
opposed to granting land rights to Tas-
mania’s 4500 people of some Aboriginal
descent. □


QUEENSLAND
Government and
police union on
collision course
By DENIS REINHARDT
RELATIONS between the Queensland
government and the union representing
the state’s 4800 police below the rank of
inspector are moving toward outright
confrontation.
The showdown is likely during this
session of parliament which opened last
week to claims by Opposition leader
Keith Wright that Mount Isa
police had railroaded a mur-
der suspect into life imprison-
ment for a crime to which an-
other person later confessed.
A government which once
prided itself on good relations
with police ranks has can-
celled payroll deductions of
union subscriptions. The gov-
ernment also has promised to
provide funeral and legal ben-
efits now offered by the union.
Scheduled monthly meetings
between union executives and
Police Minister Bill Glasson
or Commissioner Terry Lewis
have either been cancelled or
drastically circumscribed or
have degenerated into heated
exchanges.
At the centre of the feud,
which surfaced publicly last
November with the transfer of
police pilots to the beat and
other duties, is union frustra-
tion at politically motivated
and disciplinary transfers culminating
in the re-posting of a young Stock
Squad constable who alleged high-level
police involvement in northern Queens-
land cattle duffing.
Union executives readily admit that
their membership represents a strong
National Party-voting portion of the
public service but undeclared war has
witnessed the formation of remarkable
political alliances historically warn-
ing signals of a troubled government.
Labor’s Police spokesman Wayne
Goss, a former civil liberties lawyer, has
found himself the recipient of a pleth-
ora of police leaks. “None of these
issues relates to police benefits: they are
all concerned with irregularities in
police administration and justice,” says
John O'Gorman: “Our only weapon is publicity”
SHAR ADAMS
Labor’s Police spokesman Wayne Goss: a plethora of police leaks
Goss. On the same side now is union
executive Detective Sergeant John
O’Gorman, head of the Bomb Squad
and in 1977 one of the most energic offi-
cers in mass arrests following the gov-
ernment’s street march ban. O’Gorman
last week accused the state government
of triggering his union’s destruction by
discouraging membership.
According to union executives, who
have recently taken block advertising
space in both metropolitan and provin-
cial papers, “our only weapon is publi-
city.”
One officer of the union, Gary
Hannigan, said it had no choice but to
seek publicity because it had been
stonewalled by ministers lacking the
political will to make any decision
which might offend either the
Commissioner or Premier Sir
Joh Bjelke-Petersen who
maintain a close working rela-
tionship.
“In the past, we had reg-
ular sessions with the premier;
now we have been unable to
see him for 12 months,”
Hannigan said.
Friends say that Hannigan,
an outspoken police prosecu-
tor, has been told “to keep his
big mouth shut.” His union
has taken the extraordinary
step of referring the northern
Queensland cattle duffing
affair to the police complaints
tribunal a body set up to
hear public grievances against
police.
The case centres on a com-
plaint by a Townsville man,
Quirk John Costello, that two
police officers had been prin-
cipals to the removal of cattle
to which he claimed owner-
ship.
In a statement to investigators on
May 26, Costello described a scene at a
provincial saleyard in December 1982
when a calf bearing his brand was put
up for sale ...
“I went into the sale but found the
mickey (a bull calf) was missing from its
pen. I could not find the mickey in the
saleyards. I saw a young Stock Squad
man, in ordinary clothing. He took me
to a truck parked near the saleyards in
the car parking area.
“I knew this to be ’s truck.
“On looking in the crate on the back
of the truck, I saw the mickey there. I
identified the mickey as my property.
“The detective told me he would
have to take the mickey to the police
paddock. The detective also told me he
would have to book me for some
offences he said I had committed in re-
lation to brands and the weigh bill (a
consignment note).
“I then saw quite a distance


away, while I was still talking to the
young detective. He did not come over
to the truck while I was there.
“I never received any summonses for
the alleged brands or weigh bill
offences.
“I never saw the mickey again.”
Costello’s original complaint and
others had been investigated first by
Constable G. L. Hurrell from the Char-
ters Towers Stock Investigation Squad.
Hurrell subsequently was ordered to
Brisbane to take up a mobile police job,
a relative demotion.
On May 15 this year, a union execu-
tive deputation raised Hurrell’s transfer
in a meeting with Glasson. Deputy
Commissioner Syd Atkinson sent In-
spector John Huey to North Queens-
land the next day.
In a confidential report to the depu-
ty superintendent of police at Towns-
ville, dated June 22, Huey recom-
mended that a total of up to 26 charges
be laid against the two officers, one still
serving.
Referring to one of them, Huey said
“on the evidence available (he) has lied
on several matters in his efforts to excul-
pate himself. These lies can be proved
by evidence in the courts.”
Apart from criminal
charges, Huey also recom-
mended the laying of
police departmental
charges. Among the crimi-
nal charges to be laid, said
Huey, should be stealing,
conspiracy to prevent the
course of justice, unauthor-
ised possession of brands
and 19 offences under the
Queensland stock acts.
Huey also alleged that,
“at its highest,” a senior
police officer an inspec-
tor had been a party to
“a conspiracy to defraud
and mislead (the police commissioner)
to transfer Constable Hurrell.”
Huey went on to recommend “some
form of official apology to Hurrell for
what was wrongfully done to him.”
He suggested that “consideration
then be given to re-opening investiga-
tions into the death of Detective
Sergeant J. Connor at Mareeba, because
of statements made ... which indicate
(an officer) did not properly investig-
ate this death and/or drug related
matters ...”
Connor’s mysterious gunshot death,
six years ago in the Atherton Tablelands
town, was the subject of a closed
coronial inquiry which released a
finding of suicide.
Three days after Huey filed his rec-
ommendations, Lewis telexed the north-
ern region superintendent: “On the in-
formation supplied and acting on the
advice of the Solicitor-General, it is not
Commissioner Lewis
intended to prefer any of the proposed
19 (stock act) charges ...”
Coinciding with a decision to trans-
fer a Mareeba detective, Ross Dickson,
to Townsville allegedly for over-
zealous pursuit of drug offenders the
cattle duffing case created a furore with-
in the police force incensed by Opposi-
tion claims that cattle stealing was rife.
On July 2, Lewis issued a 16-page
telex marked “Attention all district offi-
cers for the information of all police
personnel.” While expressing his will-
ingness to continue encouraging police
officers to maintain contact with the me-
dia, Lewis noted: “I believe it is time to
bring to the notice of all our police offi-
cers the biased reporting by some sec-
tions of the media during the wide pub-
licity which has been given in recent
weeks to the transfer of two police offi-
cers in North Queensland.
“I am taking this course to enable
individual officers to decide for them-
selves whether they should trust those
few journalists involved in the biased
reports to faithfully and accurately re-
port and interpret anything a police offi-
cer may tell them. However, you may
wish to give deep consideration as to
whether you should risk
your integrity by trusting a
handful of journalists who
seem to work on the prin-
ciple of not allowing the
facts to spoil a good story.”
Lewis quoted at length
from one metropolitan
newspaper report and con-
cluded that “the author has
also freely quoted an
unnamed Queensland
police union spokesman
who, if he exists, is an un-
mitigated liar in claiming
that Constable Hurrell was
transferred to Brisbane as
a result of reporting his
findings to me.”
One influential northern Queensland
parliamentarian, Aboriginal Affairs
minister Bob Katter, has confessed to
being in “a terrible position” over the
duffing investigation.
Katter, the most junior minister in
the Bjelke-Petersen cabinet, is believed
to have met with both his Premier and
the Police Commissioner over Hurrell’s
transfer.
He described Hurrell’s transfer to
Brisbane as “not a promotion, and, be-
cause of the distance involved, the offi-
cer could not usefully participate in any
future investigation.”
Hurrell’s transfer was diverted in
July to Townsville but the case remains
a focus of police discontent.
A spokesman for the complaints tri-
bunal told The Bulletin last week that
the tribunal had exercised its discretion
to proceed with the union complaint. □
VICTORIA
Cain’s spending
fuels the
state economy
Premier Cain public service-led recovery?
By TIM DUNCAN
IN NORMAL terms (not allowing for
inflation) the Victorian government is
spending 86 percent more than it did
five years ago.
This is probably a record. Estimates
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
show that over the same period the out-
lays of all state authorities in Victoria
(this includes items such as railway
spending not now included in state
budgets) have increased 72.3 percent,
compared to 60 percent in New South
Wales.
Look at the real growth rates of gov-
ernment expenditure in the table of
Consolidated Funds outlays (page 31).
It is obvious the Cain government has
made its mark. During its first year
(1982-83) it increased the economic ac-
tivity of state government by 11.1 per-
cent after allowing for inflation. This
past financial year it expanded the
economic activity of government by a
further 7.4 percent. Explosive expan-
sion of this sort is an achievement in the
annals of Australian public policy.
During the past two years the
Victorian public sector has been
booming. In its first budget year the
Cain government increased capital ex-
penditure by 24 percent. Last year this


rose by a whopping 69.3 per-
cent. Consumption expendi-
ture (including wages, salaries
and supplements, and pur-
chases of goods and services)
increased by only 8.5 percent
last year, which seems moder-
ate. But this was on top of the
17.3 percent rise of the year
before.
The Victorian government
has been happy to describe
the state as leading the na-
tion’s economic recovery.
With public sector stimulation
on the scale it has pursued,
one would be surprised if it
wasn’t. In the last two years
Victorian government outlays
have increased by 43 percent
in nominal terms (compare
this to the national CPI move-
ment of about 18 percent).
Since the next state budget
(due in September) will pre-
cede an election, there is
bound to be some pork-barrel
ling. In this context a spend-
ing level of “maximum con-
straint” is unlikely to drop lower than
an allowance for inflation plus around 2
percent. Assuming that such a conserva-
tive figure is around 10 percent, then in
its first term the Cain Government will
have increased its outlays by at least 50
percent in nominal terms. On current
estimates government is Victoria’s great
growth industry.
How has the expansion been
financed? Table 2 (page 32) shows the
most important sources of state income
have been taxes and charges, proceeds
from borrowing, and Commonwealth
government transfers.
State taxes and charges have risen by
38 percent in two years. This is what
Victorian Treasurer Rob Jolly euphem-
istically calls “restoring the tax base.”
Victorian Treasurer Rob Jolly: reaching the tax limit
There is some dispute over whether the
statutory corporation payments should
be called a “dividend” or a “tax.” Since
the authorities do not choose to distrib-
ute the payments, and since the State
Electricity Commission, the Gas and
Fuel Corporation and the Melbourne
Metropolitan Board of Works handle
them in their balance sheets as costs, the
tax definition would seem to win out.
But after some communication with
government officials, the Australian Bu-
reau of Statistics has informed them that
it will in future classify the payments as
“income transfers,” which is extremely
obliging.
Over the last two years, land taxes
have increased by 64 percent, although
less than the estimate was raised this

year due to collection prob-
lems. This, together with in-
creased business franchise
charges and stamp duties on
real estate transfers running at
twice the NSW rates for ex-
pensive properties, have fall-
en heavily on the corporate
sector.
So too did increases in gas,
electricity, water and sewer-
age charges. These were raised
steeply as soon as the Cain
government won office, pre-
paring the way for the govern-
ment both to impose its statu-
tory corporation “tax-divi-
dend” and to hold energy
charges constant in real terms
for the year following the in-
itial rules.
The election of the Hawke
government has helped enor-
mously to finance expansion
of the Victorian public sector.
Table 2 shows Common-
wealth grants increased 34
percent over the past two
years, still well below the rate
of increase of state outlays, but compar-
able with the rise in state taxation.
The really significant increases in
state receipts, however, have come from
sources such as “sales of assets” and
“other financial items” shown in table 2.
Some of the sales include land from
disused railway sites or set aside for
never-to-be-constructed roads. But
other transactions involve the sale and
subsequent lease-back of railway and
tram rolling stock, which will result in
heavy future lease payments. Chief
among the other financial items is the
operation of the “hollow log,” whereby
statutory corporation reserves have
been borrowed at market rates by the
government.
State governments are unable to
print money, so the deficit is a future
charge on all contributors to Victorian
revenue. Taking the deficit as the sum of
sales of assets, advances from the Com-
monwealth and other financial items
listed in table 2, it can be seen that the
deficit has grown from $154 million in
1979-80 to $946.2 million in 1983-4, a
growth of 514 percent.
Where has the money gone? A look
at table 1 suggests some clues. In 1982-
83 the big rise in consumption expendi-
ture, according to budget papers of that
year, “almost entirely reflects wage and
salary movements and related pay-
ments.” The official record added that
wages and salaries were also apparent
in the rise in transfer payments to public
enterprises (the groaning railways were
cited for special mention).
Clearly a hefty portion of Victorian
government spending has been going
into the pockets of public servants. In

the Cain government’s first year, Vic-
torian public sector employment grew
by about 10,000, although it has
stabilised since. That stability largely
explains why consumption expenditure
grew by only 8.5 percent last year.
But the expansion has been taking
place most noticeably on the capital ac-
count. Some of it could easily be
redefined as consumption expenditure,
most obviously the $6O million included
in last year’s capital spending on rail-
ways that constituted a generous early
retirement plan for railway employees.
Another $24.4 million went into Vic-
toria’s Employment Initiatives Pro-
gram, which is hard to accept as invest-
ment.
Nevertheless, about half of last year’s
massive capital spending involved
building and construction, with its
labor-intensive employment spin-offs.
The multiplied impact of this spending,
together with the impact of direct
spending on manufactured goods de-
riving from the other half of last year’s
investment, has undoubtedly main-
tained demand and preserved employ-
ment.
This was precisely the object of the
strategy. Orchestrated by Dr Peter
Sheehan, Victoria has been experien-
cing an unprecedented experiment in
what the government calls “state coun-
ter-cyclical policy.” Deficit financing
and the setting of fiscal policy indirectly
towards social ends are normally the
province of federal budgets. Perhaps, if
Ralph Willis had retained control over
the shadow Treasury portfolio and
Sheehan gone to Canberra with him,
then the national budget might look
more like the Victorian budget. But at
least, if that had taken place, Sheehan
might have been practising economics
with more tools, especially monetary
tools. For without monetary options in
Victoria, questions of loan repayments
and revenue raising are much more im-
mediate.
Reviewing the past few years Jolly
accepted that, in terms of increases in
state taxes and charges, Victoria has
probably gone as far as it can go. “Cer-
tainly it’s got to the point where it’s a
very sensitive issue for any govern-
ment,” he told the Bulletin , “and ob-
viously you have to watch that you
don’t get to a position where you have
resistance from the business sector ...
I’m saying that the Liberal government
and the Labor government over the last
five years have gone very close to that
position.”
Some of the costs of public sector ex-
pansion in Victoria are beginning to
show up. Broadly, the taxation burden
has been shifted to the business sector
and pressure points are emerging. For
instance, land taxes levied at higher
rates on corporations with large land
holdings are being passed on to small
business tenants not in the position to
bear the higher rates.
Inflation in Melbourne over the past
financial year ran consistently higher
than the average of the eight capital cit-
Peter Sheehan: counter-cyclical policy
ies, and prices in both housing and con-
struction materials are rising faster than
outside the state. In the immediate fu-
ture, much will depend on the move-
ment of energy prices, and how the gov-
ernment balances its revenue needs
against Victoria’s future com-
petitiveness.
Overall, the costs of the expansion
are yet to bite. When the asset sales
cease, the government will have to re-
place income through further borrow-
ing, and as well it will be paying expens-
ive lease charges for property it once
owned. Borrowing from the statutory
authority reserves, if it continues, will
result in accumulating interest charges.
A larger public service, together with
the maintenance of wage rates of teach-
ers and public hospital employees, may
be harder to sustain over the next dec-
ade when Victoria will still be paying
for its counter-cyclical policy of the
early 1980 s.
Interestingly, Victoria’s chief manu-
facturing lobbyists seem remarkably
sanguine. The Victorian Chamber of
Manufacturers directed the Bulletin to
its specialist on the Victorian economy,
Greg Turnidge, for comment on the im-
pact of government expansion.
Turnidge was formerly a researcher
with Melbourne Univerisity’s Institute
of Applied Economic and Social Re-
search, once the home of Peter Sheehan.
When Sheehan set up Jolly’s Depart-
ment of Management and Budget,
Turnidge began to work for the govern-
ment and was in fact involved in the
preparation of the very budget papers
the Bulletin asked him to comment
upon. Taking Turnidge, now general
manager of policy and research at the
chamber, as a guide to the chamber’s
thinking, the idea that the private sector
might be crowded out by public sector
growth is discredited in Victorian
manufacturing circles.
Victorian producers, especially those
dependent upon protection and those
supplying the construction industry
seem to have enjoyed both the govern-
ment contracts and the general expan-
sion in the same way that the work-force
has enjoyed the employment, and the
public servants have enjoyed the expan-
sion of their numbers and the improve-
ments in their salaries and conditions.
The test will come when the govern-
ment cuts back its capital spending, as
Jolly has foreshadowed. The private
sector will then have to make it happen
under its traditional tariff umbrella but
without the added state support of the
past two years. But then it will be paying
more in taxes and charges, and the
Victorian price level will be
correspondingly higher.
If there are calls for more protection
all around the rest of the nation will be
asked to pay. □


TAXATION
Wine impost
ferments trouble
for industry
“A well-rounded little tax, with a pronounced after-taste, distinctly on
the nose, but not expected to age well!”
By LEN EVANS
IT WAS INEVITABLE, they said: You
can’t tax beer and spirits and not wine;
why should soft drinks be taxed and not
wine? SHARED TAX IS A FAIR TAX,
trumpeted the beer lobby.
Well, they won and wine sales must
fall as a consequence. Jobs will be lost
and marginal and perhaps even com-
mitted grape growers will suffer even
to losing their livelihoods.
The small business “company
boutiques” which make up more than
90 percent of all wine activities (though
not in volume terms) are already
undercapitalised and one shudders to
think of the future for many of them.
But economic reality is part of all our
lives and, though dire events may be
precipitated by the tax announced in
last week’s budget some rationalisation
would have been taking place anyway.
What, then, is unfair or unrealistic
about the tax?
In the first place, there probably
would have been no such tax if the beer
companies had not fought such a long
and hard campaign. Now, I like beer
and I drink it and I think I pay too
much for it. Yet I fail to see why beer
tax problems should be the wine indus-
try’s tax problem, too.
The beer industry has an almost in-
stantaneous product, one which can be
regulated against demand. Sales are
down, so buy less grain and make less
beer. The winemakers are linked inex-
tricably with the grape growers. Even
the simplest wine takes time to mature
and develop and regulating supply
against demand is not so easy.
What happens to vines in a recession
year? They keep growing. And they
have to be pruned and pampered and
picked. And, of all the dozens of wine
grape varieties, only the negatively-fla-
vored sultana has another use.
Enter Senator Peter Walsh, replying
on behalf of federal Treasurer Keating.
He resents criticism of the wine tax,
stating that the coalition parties have al-
ways hated beer-drinkers. This is plain-
ly gratuitous, attempting to define a
“them and us” situation the poor, op-
pressed beer-drinking worker on the
one hand and the “silvertail” wine
drinker on the other.
Walsh obviously has little knowledge
of the drinking habits of any socio-
economic group. The question remains:
Why should the over-taxed beer indus-
try have power to effect a wine tax?
Why should two wrongs make a right?
Of far greater worry are the implica-
tions of support of mediocrity: No ex-
cise tax because that would be unfair to
Labor-voting cask drinkers. A sales tax
may affect the price of a wine cask by
only 10 cents a litre whereas the price
rise of a top chardonnay could be as
much as $3 a litre. That’s discriminating
and stifling to those who try to make
top-quality wine.
The industry is in enough trouble al-
ready. Eighty percent of all still table
wine is sold in cask, flagon or bulk. The
remaining 20 percent contains all the
popular brand lines.
It would be fair to say that the top-
quality wines of Australia comprise less
than 3 percent of the total made, even
though they are the subjects of most
wine-writers’ prose and the praise we re-
ceive overseas from our efforts.
The implications seem ominous: it
doesn’t matter about this small percent-
age; tax it heavily because the silvertails
can pay. What is wrong in Australia
when excellence is so decried? What is
wrong with being a silvertail? I want to
be one and, if some include me in that
category now, I want to be even more
silvery.
I want to make money so that I can
distribute it more, spending and cre-
ating jobs. I want to spend money get-
ting better, becoming excellent at my
job and even more excellent. And, es-
pecially, I don’t want to make cask wine
because it bores me to death or, at
least to a higher consumption of beer.
I am also amazed by the ignorance of
the “them and us” attitude. As founding
director of the Wine Bureau in the ’6os,
I tried to spread the word of the quality
of the top wines of Australia. These are
enjoyed today by the discriminating
and that does not necessarily include
many of the rich. In any case, are the
downtrodden members of the working
class forever condemned to cask wine?

Can he or she not enjoy a good bottle
from time to time?
The small, high-quality section of the
wine industry is immensely important
to Australia in all sorts of ways. The
country has more than 360 wine com-
panies. Seven or eight of them are large
and many are part of multinational
groups.
I am told that some in the industry
sought a sales tax on wine. The implica-
tions are obvious.
The battling “boutique” operations
are a fair representation of the small
businesses of Australia which are so
ignored by government and by the big
boys of the private sector yet so vital.
Given the opportunity to expand, they
could take up much of the unemploy-
ment slack which exists. Small wine
businesses are labor-intensive. In one
small company with which I’m
involved, 60 people are employed to
make 20,000 cases of wine. The same
number could deal with at least a
10,000-tonne crush of cask wine
700,000 cases equivalent.
The industry is in two sections that
totally concerned with price and that
totally concerned with quality. I doubt
that either can bear the imposition of
the new sales tax without hardship but I
know that the quality section will suffer
most. I am so sick of the meddling and
posturing of government in not allow-
ing us to get on with our job that I won-
der if the past 25 years of effort have
been worth it.
And I wonder if some of my younger
colleagues will be encouraged to con-
tinue. □
THE CONSTITUTION
Exclusive: Justice
Murphy’s
next move
By RICHARD FARMER, ALAN REID
REID
and
MALCOLM TURNBULL
HIGH COURT Judge Lionel Murphy
has no intention of taking part in any
further Senate inquiry into allegations
against him. At the weekend Murphy
broke his silence to challenge the New
South Wales Chief Stipendiary Magis-
trate, Clarrie Briese, to lay a charge
against him. In an exclusive interview
with The Bulletin he said if Briese did
not persist with his claim and lay a
charge then the honorable course was
for him to publicly withdraw his allega-
tions.
Murphy’s strong stand
increases the likelihood of
a major constitutional cri-
sis if the Senate goes ahead
with plans to hold a further
inquiry. Liberal and
Democrat senators insist
they will use their majority
to force Murphy to give
evidence in a hearing to
determine whether there
has been proved misbeha-
viour under Section 72 of
the constitution.
Counsel for Murphy are
Clarrie Briese
NEWS LIMITED
prepared to take the matter to the High
Court. Leading Sydney QC Tom
Hughes, a former Liberal Attorney-
General, and Sydney constitutional
lawyer David Bennett, QC, will argue
that parliament can only exercise its
powers under Section 72 after a court
has convicted Murphy of an offence.
There is no doubt that Murphy be-
lieves the actions of the Liberal senators
are a political attack on both him and
the Labor Party he used to represent as
a senator himself. But he feels con-
strained to keep his own public com-
ments cold and formal. He told The Bul-
letin:
“Mr Briese attacked my integrity on
the assumption that the Age Tapes were
genuine. All six members of the Senate
committee which investigated the mat-
ter have concluded the tapes were not
authentic and that, even if they were,
they revealed no misbehaviour on my
part. If Mr Briese perseveres with the
belief that I attempted to
interfere with the adminis-
tration of justice by a mag-
istrate, he should lay a
charge against me. If he
does not persist with his
claim, the honorable
course is for him to say
so.”
Hughes and Bennett
told the Senate committee,
which reported last Friday
on Murphy’s role in a con-
versation with Briese that
they believed the commit-
tee had no power to decide
OPINION
Liberals are
undermining the
High Court
By THE OFFICIOUS BYSTANDER
THE DECISION of the Liberals on the
Senate Select Committee that the evi-
dence of the New South Wales chief sti-
pendiary magistrate, Clarrie Briese, jus-
tified a finding that there was a prima
facie case of proved misbehaviour on
the party of Justice Lionel Murphy is an
incredible one.
The evidence given by Briese to the
committee is pathetically inadequate to
justify such a finding. Briese’s evidence
appears to be:
1. Murphy expressed his doubts
about the strength of the Crown case
against the Sydney solicitor Morgan
Ryan. Briese does not say that Murphy
asked him to make inquiries. Neverthe-
less he did and told Murphy that the
responsible magistrate believed there
was a prima facie case against Ryan.
2. Murphy’s response to this news
was to say: “The little fellow will be
shattered.”
3. A few days later Murphy re-
marked to Briese, “And now, what
about my little mate?”
The last alleged remark of Murphy’s
can only be interpreted as a general in-
quiry about the progress of Ryan’s case
in which Murphy as a friend was inter-
ested.
It cannot suggest an attempt to influ-
ence the magistrate unless it is connec-
ted with a prior unequivocal attempt to
suborn Briese. No evidence of such an
attempt has been given by Briese or
anyone else.
One may well quibble that High
Court judges should not discuss, even
by way of inquiry, cases concerning
friends of theirs with members of the
same magistrates’ bench before which
the friend is being tried. But the fact of


Justice Lionel Murphy: Briese should do the honorable thing
for itself whether there was any breach
of Section 72.
The relevant part of that Section
says: “The Justices of the High Court
and of the other courts created by the
Parliament:—
(i) Shall be appointed by the
Governor-General-in-Council;
(ii) Shall not be removed except by
the Governor-General-in-Council on an
address from both Houses of the Parlia-
ment in the same session, praying for
such removal on the ground of proven
misbehaviour or incapacity.”
Briese, giving evidence to the Senate
committee, originally set up to inquire
into implications of the so-called Age
tapes, detailed conversations he said he
had with Murphy. Briese said he felt sig-
nificant pressure was put on him by
Murphy to take some action which
might be of assistance to Sydney solici-
tor Morgan Ryan. In a statement to the
committee, Murphy gave an account of
the conversation with Briese which dis-
agreed with Briese’s version.
In their findings last week a majority
of the committee three Labor senators
found that Briese’s evidence was not
strong enough to establish a prima facie
case of misbehaviour by Murphy. Two
Liberal senators said there was a case to
be answered. They said:
■ “Mr Justice Murphy should be
granted the opportunity to have Mr
Briese cross examined in his presence
and in public;
■ “The opportunity for the judge to
give evidence and face questioning
should remain open;
life is that judges and lawyers regularly,
incessantly discuss cases before the
courts.
It would have bordered on impropri-
ety for Murphy to mention Ryan’s case
to the presiding magistrate, but what he
is alleged to have done is no worse than
what is done every day of the week in
every legal community throughout the
world.
I have often heard judges expressing
strong views about cases before their
colleagues on the bench. If there is a
cause celebre before the Supreme Court,
everyone in the legal community dis-
cusses it and has views of one kind or
another. They would be careful not to
discuss it with the particular presiding
judge, but anyone else on the bench will
be party to conversations concerning
that case.
Murphy did not discuss the case with
the presiding magistrate. He is not al-
leged to have asked Briese to intervene
to assist Ryan’s cause. The case against
Murphy is the worst sort of political
over-exaggeration and it is all the more
astounding that it has been promoted by
Liberals who, far from defending the es-
tablished institutions of this country,
seem determined to damage them for
the sake of a temporary political advan-
tage.
Every day judges give decisions
alfecting our lives. The High Court is at
the apex of the national power pyramid
and it decides the highly political ques-
tions arising out of the interpretation of
the constitution.
The High Court’s ability to have its
decisions accepted depends on public
confidence in the institution itself. It is
for that reason that responsible people
should be slow to criticise the integrity
of High Court judges and should do so
only when there is the clearest case of
impropriety.
Murphy’s response is the only proper
one.
If Briese believes Murphy has tried
to suborn him or otherwise interfere
with the course of justice let him lay an
information before a magistrate'and at-
tempt to have him committed for trial,
If Briese won’t do it, then pre-
sumably Senators Peter Durack and
Austin Lewis will as they believe there is
a prima facie case against Murphy,
But of course the two Liberal sena-
tors probably won’t want to take advan-
tage of the court system. The fashion-
able thing nowadays is to have kanga-
roo court inquiries where everything
will be alleged and nothing will be
proved and the tedious technicalities of
a fair trial will be set aside,
There should be no inquiries
mounted by the Senate or the govern-
ment. Murphy cannot, in accordance
with the constitution, be impeached by
the parliament until his misbehaviour
has been proved in a court of law.
Those attacking him should start
proceedings before a magistrate as soon
as possible. If they do not, and, in par-
ticular, if Briese does not, then it is not
Murphy who should step down, but
Briese. □


■ “The Senate should decide how
and by whom such a hearing should be
conducted.”
The Liberal call for a further hearing
was backed by Democrat leader Don
Chipp, a member of the committee.
Neither Chipp nor the two Liberal
Senators paid regard to the submissions
put to the committee by Murphy’s coun-
sel. These will form the basis of the High
Court challenge if the Opposition par-
ties in the Senate go ahead with their
threat of a further investigation. Bennett
argued that there was no suggestion of
misconduct in the judge’s judicial ca-
pacity. “There has been no suggestion
of neglect of judicial duties,” Bennett
said. “There has been no suggestion of
an actual conviction and, even if a con-
viction is unnecessary, the material sup-
plied to the judge by the committee
would not sustain a charge for any
offence ... to maintain the indepen-
dence and standing of the judiciary, it is
necessary to refrain from damaging the
standing of a person who is to remain a
judge.” Bennett added: “No federal
judge can be independent and fearless if
he faces the possibility of roving inquir-
ies on the conduct of a judge by com-
mittees of the legislature.”
The whole affair is a huge embarrass-
ment to the Labor government in the
run up to the election. Not only is there
a general identification of Murphy with
the ALP but it also raises the suspicion
surrounding the administration of jus-
tice in NSW into a national issue. If the
hostile Senate persists with what is fore-
shadowed, the government will have an
enormous task to find a solution. It
would add further to the constitutional
issue which is serious enough on its
own. The Senate would be advocating
further investigation of the affair with
the House of Representatives refusing
to have any part of such inquiries.
Not only would you have a conflict
between Murphy, as representative of
the High Court, and a chamber of the
national parliament but there would
also be conflict on the same issue of ju-
dicial propriety between the Senate and
the House of Representatives.
The Labor Party is bound to argue
that the conduct of the Liberals is un-
just. Labor will point out that the Senate
Committee wrote to Murphy’s solicitors
in May and assured them that no ad-
verse finding would be made against
Murphy by the committee without any
proposed adverse findings being put to
him first so that he could answer them.
The Liberal senators were presumably
aware of this letter, but nonetheless
made as adverse a finding against
Murphy as could be imagined. It is
understood his legal advisers were
under the legitimate impression that no
adverse finding of any kind would or
could, in fairness to him, be made since
they had received no prior warning.
The Liberal senators’ findings are
doubly curious in that they positively
conclude that Briese was an honest and
sincere witness, notwithstanding that
the committee would not recall him to
be cross-examined on his credit by
Murphy’s counsel. Further one of the
Liberal senators, Senator Austin Lewis,
was not even present when Briese gave
his crucial evidence to the committee. □

Trouble looms
over ALP
pre-selections
By DEBORAH HOPE
BACKROOM manoeuvring is under
way in the NSW branch of the Austra-
lian Labor Party to prevent a major
public brawl over pre-selections on the
eve of the federal election. The tussle
highlights again the deficiencies of
NSW’s cumbersome rank-and-file selec-
tion system and places new pressures on
the national executive to intervene to re-
solve the issue.
Such federal intervention to reform
the NSW system is one solution to the
dilemma but it is unlikely to eventuate.
A likely result is that the national execu-
tive will move to restore all sitting MPs
in NSW as unchallenged candidates.
Rank-and-file ballots could then be di-
rected to fill the vacancies.
The background to the dispute is a
potential fight over four safe Labor
seats: Banks, Prospect and Werriwa in
western Sydney and the Wollongong
seat of Cunningham. These are held by
ALP right-wingers John Mountford
(Banks) and Dr Dick Klugman (Pros-
pect), the independent Primary Industry
minister John Kerin (Werriwa) and left-
wing Immigration minister Stewart
West (Cunningham).
The recent national redistribution
has changed the left/right balance of
power in ALP membership in these
electorates and as a consequence has
placed three of the incumbents under
threat. In the fourth seat, Werriwa, the
left is trying to manoeuvre Kerin into a
newly-formed seat, Fowler, where the
numbers favor the right-wing centre-
unity faction.
This has infuriated the NSW ALP
head office which has an opportunity to
place a candidate of its persuasion in
the new seat.
Faced with an early election, the
Labor machine in NSW is pitting its de-
termination to keep control of the pre-
selection process against the left wing’s
determination to maximise its gains
under the redistribution.
While every other ALP branch in
Australia has its pre-selection process
under way, the NSW branch office is
refusing to move until the final bound-
aries of the NSW electorates are drawn.
The left in NSW views this reluc-
tance as an ominous sign that party
headquarters plans to circumvent the
rank-and-file ballot system, using the
shortage of time as an excuse to hand
over pre-selections to the machine-con

we can nelovou pick it.
That’s Fleetcard efficiency.
Fleetcard isn't just a credit card. It's more. Much more.
It's a unique management tool that provides central control
and a complete overview of your fleet running costs.
It also provides detailed information on the individual
running costs of each car in the fleet. So if there's one car
that's needing more attention, more repairs,than the others,
Fleetcard lets you know.
Each car in your fleet is issued with a Fleetcard. The drivers
use it to pay for all fuel, oil,tyres, batteries or repairs. They can
use Fleetcard at 2,500 outlets throughout Australia. So it's
very convenient for them.
Each month, the total costs are compiled and you pay with
one cheque. So it's very convenient for you too.
At the same time, you get a computer analysis and
comparison of the costs of each and every car in the fleet. In a
fleet of ten, twenty or thirty cars, it's difficult for you to spot a
lemon. As the fleet gets larger, it gets even harder. But
Fleetcard spots it for you. And you can act on the information.
Fleetcard saves you management time. It eliminates the
need for cash floats, log books and numerous
reimbursements, and can cut your fuel bill by at least 10%.
Best of all Fleetcard provides detailed information.
And knowing where you're spending money is the first step
towards being able to save it.

trolled administrative committee. (Be-
fore rank-and-file ballots, voting eligi-
bility for each seat must be revised and
electorate councils elected.)
Head office has rejected the left’s
proposal that the pre-selection process
have the safeguard of a 48-hour period
of grace to rearrange nominations after
final seat boundaries are drawn.
Its real nervousness, however, is in
the prospect of a slight shift in electoral
boundaries in suburban Sydney throw-
ing its master plan into chaos. This ner-
vousness is exacerbated by the left’s po-
tential to pick up two or three safe
Labor seats and the possible loss to the
Opposition of Calare and Macquarie,
held by centre-unity supporters.
To illustrate the point that rank-and-
file ballots at short notice may be
against everyone’s interests, head office
has made clear that, in any free-for-all
contest, West the left’s only represen-
tative in federal cabinet would be
beaten by Rex Connor Jnr, the centre-
unity son of Gough Whitlam’s Energy
minister.
Although the left has discarded this
threat publicly, at least as black-
mail to force a compromise to save
Mountford and Klugman, right-wing
numbers men put the count at almost 50
percent each in West’s electorate. They
believe that with West preoccupied with
ministerial duties, Connor would have
won the race by the time a ballot occur-
red.
In the face of this scramble, the left is
attempting to organise a petition signed
by all state and federal members of par-
liament in NSW to pressure the national
executive to intervene in the state’s pre-
selection process. The executive, how-
ever, is not due to meet until September
28 and in any case is unlikely to order
across-the-board ballots.
One reason for this is to protect sit-
ting members an irony, in that
Mountford won Banks in 1980 after de-
posing sitting ALP member Vince Mar-
tin. Another, perhaps more important,
reason is the widespread concern in the
ALP that the rank-and-file system in
NSW consistently produces the worst
parliamentary Labor delegation to Can-
berra by favoring good operators over
genuine talent.
Strong proponents of change in
NSW look to Victoria and Queensland
where the ALP combines local branch
and higher level representation from
state conferences and councils to pre-
select candidates.
The prospects of any move toward
such systems in NSW, are slim. The
pre-selection debate has preoccupied
the NSW branch for years but no action
has been taken because of fears of
strong local reaction. At the 1984 state
conference, party delegates voted to re-
affirm the rank-and-file policy. □
LIFESTYLE
There’s nothing
fragile about
this Glass
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
SINCE he relinquished six years ago
the day-to-day management of Austra-
lia’s largest car dealership, Sydney’s
Capitol Motors, Arnold Glass’s life has
been a Boy’s Own Guide To Retire-
ment. The man who built Capitol from
scratch in 1946 and collected $l4 mil-
lion for his 49 percent share when Aus-
tralian National Industries Ltd bought
out the car empire in 1977 has not
departed from a hectic, flamboyant
lifestyle from his home in the Monte
Carlo end of Monaco.
Glass is renowned for his pursuit of
money, women and speed he raced
cars and powerboats successfully in
Australia and was an accomplished
pilot and retirement has been a series
of adventures for the 57-year-old play-
boy.
But last week Glass was in Sydney to
announce his resignation from his posts
as chairman of Capitol and deputy
chairman of Australian National Indus-
tries. From Capitol’s Auburn head office
he said that for the first time he wanted
time to plan his future.
He said: “I’ve got so many things to
do and I’m not as young as I was. I
haven’t got that much more time to do
them in.”
He leaves the two boards just as the
Nissan Motor Company is gearing up
to take over the NSW distributorship of
Nissan vehicles, a step ANI and its re-
cently-retired chief executive John
Leard fought strongly when it was an-
nounced by the Japanese last year.
Capitol lost the battle but the result is
not a catastrophe for the company,
which plans to develop its Bha Auburn
site into a motor supermarket selling ve-
hicles from Nissan, BMW (for which it
holds the NSW distributorship) and one
of two other retail franchises under
negotiation.
Glass will have more time to plan
European jaunts from his modern
apartment on the 33rd floor of one of
Monaco’s tallest blocks. He said: “I can
see through to Italy and right down to
the Monaco port.” He is negotiating to
buy a new apartment, which will not be
cheap. A reasonably-priced modern 20-
square apartment in Monaco costs
around $500,000.
Monaco suits millionaire Glass: “It
is a wonderfully-run area. You can walk
around dripping with jewels and
nothing is going to happen to you. It’s a
fabulous place. The policemen are very
powerful. When they walk up to you
they salute you. They are very helpful.”
The current apartment has been
headquarters for Glass’s sports activi-
ties.
A keen hunter and a director of Sa-
fari Club International of the United
States, he has stalked and killed buffalo
and lion in South Africa, crocodile in
Zimbabwe and big bear in Alaska. On
the walls of his part-time Auburn office
are photographs of his prey back-
grounded by the hunter kneeling, rifle in
hand, displaying a boy-scout grin with
two sparkling, gold-capped front teeth.
Glass was reluctant to provide The
Bulletin with the photographs. “Many
people would not understand. All the
hunting is done under licence and they
are animals that have to be culled.
Arnold Glass and his Gnat jet: he “does a few airshows”


Glass at Capitol’s Auburn headquarters: he is still the largest private shareholder in owner ANI
People are brainwashed about conser-
vation.” He pointed out that a dead alii-
gator had eaten four men.
“In South Africa the word is that if
you’re happy to pay a licence fee of
around $l2OO you can shoot any leop-
ard you like because they are a bloody
nuisance. There are thousands of them
but they are hard to get. You can hunt
them as long as you don’t use a spot-
light. I’ve heard them growling in the
bush but I’ve never seen one.”
His other main indulgence has been
car racing. He has retained one of two
McLaren grand prix racers, a Formula 1
model 29, and has driven a Lola an
ex-Alan Jones car in a couple of Can-
Am races in the US. Glass also drove a
Ferrari into placings in Britain’s Super
Sports Series.
In the Indianapolis 500 he has run
Geoffrey Brabham’s pit crew. Racing
has brought mixed fortunes, the best re-
suit being a win in a Formula Libre race
in Europe.
Lately car racing has given way to
the current whim, high-speed flying. The
toy is a small jet: a Gnat, once the plane
of the leader of the Royal Air Force’s
Red Arrows precision flying team. Glass
“does a few airshows.” This week he
flies to a display in Austria. There is also
a Learjet in Australia which has been
lying idle and which he plans to take to
Europe shortly.
Glass has found time for one or two
months snow skiing each year at a
French resort 90km from Monaco. With
the exception of last year he has spent a
few weeks each year on the US slopes as
well.
The pace of life has meant he has had
little time for powerboat racing but he
says he is negotiating to buy an 18-
metre, 65-kilometre-an-hour launch. It
will mean selling a smaller boat.
One drawback of life on the run has
been that Glass has not had the time to
treat Monaco to any of the parties that
kept social columnists’ typewriters tap-
ping in Sydney.
Through the 70s the Capitol Motors’
Christmas party was an event not to be
missed. Oysters, prawns, hams, whole
suckling pigs, saddles of beef and roast
lamb were washed down with litres of
champagne served by flimsily-clothed
hostesses.
Glass recalled: “The girls had little
white shirts that kept popping open. I
had a little pair of scissors and I warned
them that if I saw one more button done
up than I permitted I’d cut off all the
buttons. I did it a few times and they
knew I meant it.
“The big parties have not been hap-
pening in Monaco because I haven’t
been there long enough to do it yet. I’ve
been running backwards and forwards a
bit.”
As for the possibility of courting a
member of Monaco’s royal family, he
says he is not interested. “You have to
understand that everyone in Monaco is
trying to do that number. I don’t try to
do it. A lot of people try this business of
being noticed. I never did it in Austra-
lia. The people I asked to my parties
were the people I did business with or
just friends,
“I have some titled friends in Mon-
aco but they are like me; they don’t
want to know about this sort of stuff
either. They are much happier out on
boats. I have seen Princess Caroline ski-
ing. She’s a good-looking girl but
people are always trying to find some-
thing wrong with her. If they would just
leave her alone everything would be all
right.”
Glass, a divorcee, has no plans for a
second marriage. “I shall never get mar-
ried again. Some people need it. I don’t.
It’s a decision I made a long time ago
and I don’t see any reason to change it.”
While he has opted out of manage-
ment, Glass still has investment plans in
Europe. He will not elaborate or put a
price on his personal wealth, much of
which is tied up in property in Europe,
One of his major Australian invest-
ments remains ANI. He is the largest
private shareholder on the register
ahead of the übiquitous Queensland in-
vestor Charles Viertel. At today’s ANI
price of $2.35, Glass has a holding with
a market value of around $2.5 million,
ANI and Capitol will never lose
Glass completely,
He said: “I’m an old warhorse. If
someone blows the bugle I start padding
my hooves on the ground. I’m always
interested.” He is as close as his Mon-
aco phone. □

Probe into
bureaucrat
efficiency
A Leopard tank on exercise: centre of a public service squabble.
By ANTHONY HILL
AN IMPORTANT parliamentary in-
quiry will start hearings next month on
ways to review management efficiency
within the Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice and correct what are seen as gaps
and fragmentation in the system.
The inquiry follows a decision by the
Auditor-General, Keith Brigden, to dis-
band his efficiency audit division
after a four-year trial and absorb it
elsewhere in his office. It reflects grow-
ing tensions between the Auditor-Gen-
eral and the House of Representatives
expenditure committee. The move led to
sharp exchanges between Brigden, al-
ready under some government pressure
to resign before his due retiring date in
June next year, and the committee
chairman, Labor MHR Leo McLeay.
Brigden has referred to the efficiency
audit division as having inexperienced
staff picking the wrong topics to investi-
gate. But Mcleay says the move to dis-
band the division will “negate the
spirit” of the 1979 amendments which
set up efficiency audits. It is unclear, he
says, who has responsibility now for
efficiency in the public service and,
hence, next month’s inquiry.
When efficiency audits were set up,
following the Coombs Royal Commi-
sion, they were seen as a significant de-
parture from the regular financial
audits. Based on a US model, they were
to review management practices and the
economic use of government resources.
Yet there have been many reports of
problems within the division. Sources
speak of a high staff turnover, “person-
ality clashes” at management level and
a “constipation” in getting reports writ-
ten and published.
So far, about 14 efficiency audits
have been tabled in parliament, with an-
other four or five to come. They have
taken, on average, 2/ 2 years to complete.
But the issue really came to a head
with an efficiency audit last year on the
purchase of 103 Leopard tanks for the
army. It took five people, working on
and off, more than three years to finalise
the audit at a cost of $185,000 yet it
filled only nine pages of the Auditor-
General’s report.
The result has been described as al-
most worthless. The expenditure com-
mittee found that the audit lacked depth
and analysis and left critical questions
on the management of the tank unex-
plored. Nor did it recommend a follow-
up review on deficiencies in the repair
and supply system.
It is known that the original draft
audit was at least five or six times longer
than the one published.
Sources who have seen the draft
document say that it did address many
of the questions raised by the expendi-
ture committee, including differences
between military “chain of command”
management and conventional prac-
tices. They say most of these issues were
edited out of the final report by higher
management during the three years it
took to produce the paper. Officials
were questioned constantly on the lack
of documentary evidence to support
their findings when it was the absence of
documentation they were criticising.
In evidence to the expenditure com-
mittee, the Auditor-General acknow-
ledged there had been lengthier draft re

ports but said there was insufficient evi-
dence to support the criticism made.
Questioned about the time, manpower
and cost involved in producing a nine-
page report, Brigden remarked: “We
can be more turgid in our prose if that
would make the committee happy.”
The problems behind the Leopard
tank report are symptoms of the wider
dispute over efficiency reports. There is
no doubt that, in the two years since he
became Auditor-General, Brigden has
had a lack of faith in the reports.
Brigden told The Bulletin he ac-
cepted that the Leopard tank report was
“unduly protected, the final writing
wishy-washy and the project badly
managed.” But this was because it was
too wide-ranging in scope and was the
wrong issue to resolve questions about
military project management.
He says that his department is doing
efficiency audits already whether they
are called that or not. But audit tech-
niques have changed over the past 20
years.
“We cannot afford to pay people just
to flick and tick,” he said. “Our auditors
are systems-based. They look at the
financial and management systems to
get an overview, to test the controls and
see whether they are effective. It is about
good management and good manage-
ment is based on efficiency.”
Brigden says that the regular audits
take between six and nine months to
produce, against the 254 years for the
efficiency audits. They have found 10
defence projects with management
shortcomings, now being investigated
by the Public Accounts Committee.
He said: “If the expenditure commit-
tee looks at the audit reports over the
past two or three years, they will find the
parliament has been better served by
more timely and narrow-ranged re-
ports.”
The expenditure committee has res-
ervations about this. Its report on the
Leopard tank showed it was not con-
vinced about the decision to disband the
efficiency audit division.
The report said: “Efficiency audits
were seen from the time of their intro-
duction as something beyond tradition-
al audit functions and as an activity for
which normal auditing skills were inad-
equate.
“To draw efficiency audits back into
the line functions of the Auditor-Gener-
al’s office and to ensure that most
efficiency audits are carried out by
people with more than five years’ audit-
ing experience seems, to the committee,
to be a dilution of the purpose for which
efficiency audits were introduced.”
It was these doubts, and questions
whether the Public Service Board is
exercising its responsibilities to check
efficiency, that led to the decision to set
up an inquiry in to the system. □

ABC and PNG
remain at
cross purposes
By STUART INDER
A STATEMENT made by Australian
Broadcasting Corporation chairman
Ken Myer in Townsville has weakened
the chances of the ABC quickly resolv-
ing its dispute with the Papua New
Guinea government.
The government was still firm in Port
Moresby last week that there would be
no change in its decision that the ABC
staff correspondent there Sean
Dorney must depart on September 21
when his work permit will be revoked,
that no visa will be issued automatically
for his replacement and that ABC re-
porters are not welcome to visit PNG
meanwhile.
The government’s ban was an-
nounced in May, after the ABC Four
Corners television program screened an
interview by Sydney reporter Allan
Hogan with Irian Jaya rebel leader
James Nyaro despite efforts by PNG to
prevent the interview taking place and
despite ABC management having
undertaken not to screen it.
As a condition of lifting the ban, the
government demanded from the ABC
an apology and undertakings as to the
future conduct of its reporters PNG.
The ABC since has given assurances
as to the conduct of reporters, but has
not made the apology required.
Myer was an official guest in Port
Moresby for the opening of the new
Parliament House in August, but, in a
busy week for Prime Minister Somare,
had no opportunity for talks to resolve
the difficulties.
Two ABC Canberra correspondents
covered the opening but their visas were
issued on the understanding that this
was not a precedent.
Returning from Port Moresby, Myer
gave an interview to the ABC in Towns-
ville in which he said it “would be a
disaster if Dorney were forced to leave
PNG.” Myer went on to say that the
“ABC would not publicly apologise” to
the PNG government over the affair and
added that he was “confident there
could be a satisfactory solution to the
problem because of Sean Dorney’s high
reputation as a journalist throughout
the South Pacific.”
Myer’s interview was carried as an
item on Radio Australia on August 9.
Next day, the PNG National Broadcast-
ing Commission seized on part of it and
led its main 7am national bulletin with
the blunt news that Myer had refused to
apologise.
The NBC report quoted one of its
political roundsmen as saying that the
government saw Myer’s statement as
meaning that the ABC staff correspon-
dent certainly would have to leave the
country on September 21.
That still was the position last week.
And, barring personal intervention by
Somare, it’s likely to remain that way.
PNG Foreign Minister Rabbie
Namaliu stressed in Port Moresby that
the departure of Dorney would not
mean the closure of the ABC office, as it
was also manned by a local reporter. □

BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR
Candidates for the glittering prize
Nominations for the 1985 Bulletin-Qantas Business Woman of the Year have opened
and will he accepted until October 10. Nominees are expected to be diverse in their
interests, their activities and achievements. GLENNYS BELL profiles two of them.
VALMAI HARDY never
thought in terms of just work-
ing for a living. She wanted to
do something which would
benefit others but when she
started work in 1950 she had
few choices. She tried com-
merce, but soon realised there
were few prospects for a sat-
isfying career. So she became
a nurse.
In the years since, her ca-
reer has covered most aspects
of nursing. She is director of
nursing at the Bendigo Home
and Hospital for the Aged,
and part-time commissioner
with the Health Commission
of Victoria.
She was nominated for the
award by the Nursing Admin-
istration Group of the Royal
Australian Nursing Feder-
ation because of her “out-
standing achievements and
contribution to nursing and
health care services.”
Hardy began nursing at
Broken Hill in 1950 and by
1958 was senior tutor sister at
the Adelaide Children’s Hos-
pital. She was responsible for
the practical training of 290
students but also introduced,
for the first time to South Aus-
tralia, a training method known as the
study block system.
In the mid-60s, her career began to
change direction. She spent some time
in the United States as an exchange stu-
dent after which she became more
involved in research, though she con-
tinues to emphasise the primary care
level of nursing. She returned to the
Adelaide Children’s Hospital, first as
co-ordinator of nurse training and later
became director of nursing.
In 1971, Hardy was invited to join
the project team planning for the Flin-
ders Medical Centre, a 700-bed hospital
and medical school that was to be incor-
porated into Flinders University. She
helped plan the structure and organisa-
tion of the nursing staff and facilities.
An international firm of architects,
town planners and health service con-
sultants, Llewelyn-Davies Weeks
Forrestier-Walker & Bor, of London,
were consultants to the project. As a re-
sult of the work, the firm asked Hardy to
Valmai Hardy: taking nursing to limit in theory and practice
DON McPHEDRAN
join its overseas operations as nursing
consultant.
In 1972, Hardy went first to Greece
where she assisted in the reorganisation
of a hospital in Athens and in 1973, to
Singapore to help plan a new hospital.
Her next project was nursing adviser
to a team appointed to build and up-
grade hospitals and establish health
centres in the Gulf state of Qatar, a task
which was to last three years. “It was an
exciting period of my life,” she says.
“Health consultancy was at its height
and I was fortunate to be a part of it. It
was big business. I was responsible for
setting budgets and working on projects
with all the other disciplines involved in
the program.”
In July, 1974, she was transferred as
associate director to the Sydney office
which was set up as Llewelyn-Davies
Kinhill. The projects she worked on in-
cluded initial planning of the Westmead
Hospital and two studies for James
Cook University of North Queensland
to identify medical education
facilities at the Townsville
General Hospital and a feasi-
bility study for the develop-
ment of a teaching hospital in
Townsville.
Then the time came to con-
sider returning to nursing in
Australia. She decided on the
job at the Bendigo Hospital
and Home for the Aged to sat-
isfy a need to return to basic
nursing and to move into an
area which she believes is of
growing importance. “Be-
cause of my time overseas, I
could see the extent of the
problem of the aged at a
world level, not only in the
Western cultures but the
Third World. The fact is
people are living longer and
health care needs to be ex-
tended with increasing num-
bers of aged posing chal-
lenges.”
The Bendigo complex has
470 beds, 56 of them in a hos-
pital for the elderly and the
remainder in the nursing
home and hostel for the aged.
In addition, there are two day
hospitals, one with 50 beds
and the other with 30 beds, ac-
commodation for 44 in a vil-
lage and domiciliary services to the
aged in the district. Hardy regards it as
one of the leading geriatric centres, not
only in Victoria, but Australia. Its
budget for the coming year is $2O mil-
lion.
Dr Rhonda Mclver was a project scien-
tist with the University of NSW in the
early 70s carrying out research into the
treatment of wool scouring effluent.
Little did she realise that one day she
would be concerned with the treatment
of all kinds of effluent in the Sydney
region in her role as chairperson of the
Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and
Drainage Board.
During her career, Mclver has been
in the habit of acquiring knowledge and
skills which eventually lead her into
new areas of expertise. She was orig-
inally a food technologist which led her
into management consulting and onto a
task force which reviewed the Sydney
Water Board in 1983. From there she

More than just
ANOTHER TURBO.
Isuzu turbocharged trucks
have earned a reputation for
reliability that’s almost
legendary
It stems from countless
miles of road testing,
meticulous attention to
quality control and years of
research and development.
This unbeatable formula
has produced the outstandingly
successful JCR and SH Series
of 6-cylinder turbos that deliver
more power and torque without
the usual stress and power
waste associated with average
“bolt-on blowers”.
To achieve this unique
balance, Isuzu engineers
tailored the turbo boost to
match each engine’s
operating requirements.
The end results are less
engine wear, reduced driver
fatigue from fewer gear changes,
minimum downtime, lower fuel
bills, and day-to-day savings that

moved to her present position which she
carried out on a part time basis. Mclver
also runs her own management consult-
ing business with clients as varied as the
NSW Totalisator Agency Board,
Rexona Pty Ltd and the Veteran Affairs
Department.
Mclver was always good at science
which was encouraged at her school, St
George Girls High School in Sydney.
When she told her careers adviser, an
English teacher, she wanted to do some-
thing in science, the teacher suggested
she become a food technologist because
the teacher knew another student who
had done it. She checked out
the subject at the University of
NSW, liked the idea, and en-
rolled.
A bright student, she did
an honors degree and gained
a university medal, then went
on to do her doctorate in
chemical engineering while a
teaching fellow with the uni-
versity. She was 28 before she
had her first commercial job
as research scientist with Mars
Inc & Master Foods which
later became Mars Inc and
Uncle Bens of Aust Pty Ltd.
Though she worked in the
factory and laboratory in
charge of the formulation and
maintenance of the product
range and then as market re-
search officer, Mclver found
herself becoming more inter-
ested in the organisation it-
self, how it worked and its
functions.
“I found my problems
were not so much the technical issues as
people issues because I had to introduce
new things into the factory and negoti-
ate the changes involved.”
She did what has also become a habit
whenever she wants to find out more
about a subject. She enrolled for an-
other degree, this time a Master of Busi-
ness Administration at the University of
NSW. Mars Inc not only encouraged
her to add to her qualifications and
training but allowed her to reorganise
her schedule and flew her from Albury
where she was working, to Sydney every
fortnight to combine study and work.
In 1977, she joined J. R. Norman &
Associates as a senior consultant. She
decided to go into her own business in
1978. “I had a lot of ideas I wanted to
put into practice,” she says. The only
way she could do this was to take the
risk and go out on her own. “It wasn’t
an easy decision to make, but I haven’t
regretted it,” she adds. She also decided,
because she valued the opportunities
given to her by her former employer,
not to raid his clients nor to work in the
same consulting area for two years.
She decided to work in general or-
ganisational development. She was also
interested in equal employment oppor-
tunity.
In 1978, women in business, affirm-
ative action and anti-discrimination
legislation were being discussed as
ideas, concepts and issues but little ac-
tion was actually being taken. Mclver
was interested in the problems facing
women in the work force. She was one
of the first to provide consulting ser-
vices for companies concerned with
opening up opportunities for women in
their organisations. In 1979, she con-
ducted a study into the situation of
ERNIE McQUILLAN
Dr Rhonda Mclver: multi-talented
women at Esso Australia, which led to
its equal opportunity initiatives. She
ended up developing a training pro-
gram in the areas of management, com-
munication, career development and or-
ganisation for companies which ranged
from the ABC, the Australian Public
Service Board, ANZ Bank and Volvo
Australia. She also held training
sessions for various companies such as
Tooth & Co and Unilever Australia.
In 1983, in her role as a management
consultant, Mclver was asked to chair
the task force reviewing the Sydney
Water Board. When the team reported
to the NSW Government she was then
asked to implement the report by be-
coming chairperson.
She works a 9-10 hour day divided
between the Water Board, her board
positions and her consulting firm. She is
also taking on added responsibilities
with her great public profile. She had
just been appointed a board member of
OTC and is a board member of the
Australian Meat and Livestock Cor-
poration and a council member of the
New South Wales Institute of Technol-
ogy. □

DEFENCE
Cost of F-18
scheduled
to nosedive
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
DESPITE THE need to strengthen the
tail structure of the F/A-18 Hornet
fighter, the cost per aircraft in the
United States was scheduled to come
down by more than 10 percent by next
year, according to senior Royal Austra-
lian Air Force officers in Canberra.
The disclosure that cracks
have been detected in the fin
(rudder) support structure of
the F-18, which meant that
temporary limits had been
imposed on its operations,
was one of two disturbing de-
velopments concerning the
fighter.
The other was a claim by
the Parliamentary Public Ac-
counts Committee that the
cost of the F-18 program has
risen from $3.4 billion to more
than $4 billion.
This was erroneously inter-
preted in some press reports
as indicating that the cost of
each of the 75 aircraft the
RAAF had ordered had risen
from $32.4 million in October
1981 to $53.4 million.
One commercial implica-
tion of these calculations has
already surfaced. Representa-
tives of Britain’s Westland
Helicopters, which is bidding
for the Royal Australian
Navy’s order for helicopters
to operate off its frigates, have
circulated the committee’s cal-
culation to support the British
company’s claim that the
“fixed-cost” deal Westland is
offering is preferable to that of its rival,
Sikorsky of the United States.
The Australian reaction has been
somewhat exaggerated. A detailed
analysis of the crack findings in the
F-18s, in the authoritative United States
weekly Aviation Week & Space Technol-
ogy, indicates that the problem is not
catastrophic.
The cause is related to a radical de-
sign feature, the leading edge extension
of the wings (LEX), which gives the
fighter its ability to manoeuvre at ex-
treme angles. This provides a major ad-
vantage in combat against most other
fighter aircraft flying today, including
the US Air Force’s F-16 which was the
rival for the RAAF order.
In the F-18, the angle at which the
aircraft’s nose can rise while it can still
be flown and controlled is virtually un-
limited. In practical terms, however, the
US navy (which is the US customer for
the F-18 and Australia’s agent in deal-
ing with the supplier, the McDonnell
Douglas Corp) suggests this “angle of
attack” should be limited to 35 degrees
because the drag increase beyond that
degrades the fighting performance.
But I have flown in an F-18 when it
was fully controllable at an angle of at-
tack of 65 degrees.
The F-16 is limited to an angle of 25
degrees the limitation temporarily
imposed on the F-18.
The airflow over the aircraft resulting
from the LEX of the wing has led to
AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY
unpredicted stresses and, hence, the
cracks in the fin structure which were
detected in routine maintenance. The
unpredicted pressures followed changes
to the original design, which incorpor-
ates a slot in the LEX to smooth out air
flow. With development, the slot was
found to cause unwanted drag; so it was
eliminated. This swept the airflow wave
back along the fuselage to the area
where the twin rudders rise out of the
flat rear-fuselage surface. The pressure
at high angles of attack created extra
stresses.
The remedy has been simple. The
lugs which join the fins to the fuselage
will be strengthened. There will also be
a band of reinforcing applied along the
support part of the fuselage. And the
fins, made from composite, will be
strengthened with additional resin ep-
oxy. Little weight penalty will result
from these modifications.
The RAAF says that all the Austra-
lian aircraft will incorporate the modifi-
cation before it takes delivery of them.
“We will not accept any aircraft with
performance limitations,” a senior pro-
ject officer said.
In the US, McDonnell Douglas has
announced it will bear the cost of the
modifications within the present pricing
schedule. This provides for the “fly-
away” cost of each F-18 to come down
from $22.5 million in the fiscal 1980-81
order to $20.8 million this year and
$20.2 million next year.
The RAAF rejects the par-
liamentary committee’s as-
sumption that the program
cost will rise automatically be-
cause of the change in the re-
lationship between the Aus-
tralian and US dollars and be-
cause of inflation.
The $3.4 billion program
estimate, officers said, was
made just after the Hawke
Government came to power
and devaluation reduced the
SUS worth of the Australian
dollar. Rates have see-sawed
since and, as of late last
month, were at approximately
the same level as when the es-
timate was made.
The officers pointed out
that the fly-away cost repre-
sented only about half the
total project cost. Other com-
ponents were spares and sup-
port equipment, the cost of
gearing Australian industry
up to participate in the manu-
facture of the F-18 (which is
regarded as an essential if it is
to be supported independent-
ly by Australia) and capital
works at RAAF bases at
Williamtown and Tindal.
Many of these costs, of
course, are in Australian dollars and not
subject to exchange rate fluctuations.
The modifications required to
strengthen the rear section and the fins
are of considerable interest technically
to Australia.
Australian manufacturers are
making parts in the same area as those
which have to be modified (although
they do not have to make any changes at
this stage) and as a result they have an
intimate knowledge of this portion of
the structure and the problems
involved.
Both industry and the Air Force are
also heartened by predictions that the
cost of maintaining the F-18 in service
will fall as the aircraft builds up hours
in service. □

COVER STORY
The cancer that is eating
our high-rise buildings
Ranelagh in Sydney: concrete cancer, leaking windows, damp walls and falling tiles
Hi-Surf apartments, Surfers Paradise: rust-stained concrete
Concrete cancer, caused by rusting reinforcement rods, is only one of the
diseases afflicting modern high-rise developments. Repair costs can be
staggering, even after compensation payments, WILLA McDONALD reports.
LIFE SHOULD BE idyllic in Ranelagh,
the prestigious Darling Point home-unit
block with incomparable views of Syd-
ney views that for the past year have
been obscured by thick scaffolding.
Instead of gazing peacefully over the
harbor, residents have to endure drill-
ing, hammering and loss of privacy
while workmen clamber around the 30-
storey building from 7am until 3pm.
The reason is concrete cancer and
other diseases which affect modern
high-rise development diseases
which, according to Dr Lex Blakey,
chief of the CSIRO division of building
research, cost Australia $3 billion a year
in maintenance.
Concrete cancer is caused by cor-
rosion of embedded steel reinforcement
rods. They expand as they rust, cracking
the concrete and causing it to break up.
Fifteen-year-old Ranelagh also
suffers from leaking windows, damp in-
ner walls, falling window tiles and brick
growth. (All bricks, because they are
baked, absorb water and expand with
age. Unless sufficient room is left for
this, brick panels will crack and cause
concrete or other material hemming
them in to break up.)
Repair costs have risen to a con-
servative estimate of $2 million costs
not covered by Ranelagh’s ordinary
building insurance. Nor can residents
look to the NSW Builders Licensing
Board which can make payments to
home-owners, up to an aggregate of
$40,000, for poor workmanship in con-
struction done after 1972. (There is no


stained concrete
equivalent board for commer-
cial building.)
Repair costs have been ag-
gravated by the discovery of
asbestos left behind in the
building after having been
used as a cement mould. Sep-
arate working sheds and
showers for the two or three
asbestos handlers cost $lOO a
week while the workers re-
ceive an extra $57 weekly al-
lowance each.
Causes of corrosion are
still being investigated but
four causes isolated by the
CSIRO are proximity to - sea
air, air pollution, additives
used in the concrete and poor
workmanship.
Ranelagh is close to the city and the
view from the roof extends in all direc-
tions across the smoggy Sydney basin.
But the pollution and salt air do not
seem to affect older buildings. They re-
main largely unaffected, according to
Blakey, because “the fashion of using
concrete bare on the facade of a build-
ing only started in the 19605.”
New additives, he says, can be partly
at fault. Builders mix additives with
Westfield Towers in Sydney: another sufferer from concrete cancer corrosion
Seacrest apartments, Gold Coast: more rust-stained concrete
concrete to help moulding and setting
properties but some, such as fly-ash, are
known to increase the risk of corrosion
seriously.
Additives thin the mixture. “When I
first started in this business,” said
Blakey, “you would say there would be
six bags of cement per cubic yard of
concrete or one bag of cement to two
of sand to four of stone; these days,
they’re probably down to five and may
even be down to four for a lot
of standard mixes.
“You must be reducing the
durability of the surface layer
— that’s what’s involved in
protecting the steel,” he said,
pointing out that concrete
corrosion attacks the facades
of buildings rather than inner
support columns.
Blakey believes that “some
people are trying to write the
whole problem off by saying
it’s bad practice but I don’t
agree one little bit. Bad prac-
tice is not the whole story.”
Others, such as John
Burke, managing director of
Rescrete Industries Pty Ltd,
blame cost-cutting by specula-
tive developers. “In most
cases,” he said, “developers
get precisely what they paid
for — rubbish ... If you make
bad concrete, it will fail; if
you make good concrete, it
will not.”
David Beal, senior lecturer
in concrete technology and
design with the Queensland
Institute of Technology, says
that the problem has a combi-
nation of causes but that concretes are
chosen for strength rather than for dura-
bility. “There are standards in the de-
sign code for durability but no one is
taking any notice.”
(A spokesman for the Australian
Standards Association said the code
had been incorporated into building
regulations in all states but was being
revised.)

Board of Works building, Melbourne: cladding fell off
Commonwealth offices, Brisbane: more cladding problems
to air and moisture unless sufficiently
covered by concrete. George Lytton, job
foreman for repair company A. W. Ed-
wards Pty Ltd employed at Ranelagh,
says that rods in some parts there were
covered only with paint; in others, there
were merely 10mm of concrete instead
of the required 30 to 50mm.
Ranelagh’s body corporate is suing
the builder, the architects and the
Woollahra Council in a bid to recover
costs.
A spokesman for the council said
that it was known in the building indus-
try in the 60s, when Ranelagh was built,
for being “too careful” in checking such
things as cover of reinforcement rods.
He said the council would have checked
the frames containing the rods before
the concrete was poured to make sure
that they were positioned correctly. “At
the time of inspection, it would have
been right because we are just so care-
ful. It moved after the inspection was
made .. . the reinforcement may have
been knocked while the concrete was
being poured,” he said.
The architect was unwilling to com-
ment. The directors of the builder were
unavailable for comment.
While Ranelagh's problems are par-
ticularly severe, they are not uncom-
mon. The Boulevard Hotel and
Westfield Towers in William Street,
Sydney, also suffer from concrete can-
cer. The joined buildings were built by
Westfield Design & Construction 11
years ago and are owned by the Com-
monwealth Superannuation Fund In-
vestment Trust.
Both have facades of pre-formed
concrete panels but on the Boulevard
these reach only to the podium level.
About $l.B million will be spent on re-
pairing the concrete and some small
maintenance but Westfield is using the
corrosion as an opportunity for a total
$5 million refurbishment, inside and
outside, of both buildings but mostly the
hotel.
Concrete corrosion is well known on
the Gold Coast. The body corporate of
the Seacrest Quality Apartments at
Main Beach, one of many buildings
affected, is tendering for removal of rust
stains on its concrete walls. Building
manager, Jeremy White, estimates the
stains began to appear on the five-year-
old building 18 months ago.
Tenders for cutting out the rust and
repainting have ranged from $32,000 to
$68,000. According to White, the body
corporate approached the Builders’
Registration Board of Queensland
earlier this year but was told the board
would treat the problem as one of on-
going maintenance.
Negotiations are in progress with the
developers, to share the cost of rectify-
ing the rust. Repairs needed previously
to some balcony railings in the building
were done by the developers without de-
lay, said White.
To meet fire regulations, Seacrest’s
54 units were built with specially
reinforced aluminium windows but,
during strong winds in recent storms,
several of the windows burst and blew
out. Links in the windows had de-
teriorated with heat and moisture. Re-
placement of whole windows will cost
$64 a unit. Where that isn’t necessary,
replacement of the links will cost $32 a
window.
Hi-Surf Quality Apartments on the
Esplanade at Surfers Paradise are treat-
ing the repair of rust-stained concrete as
routine maintenance. The 28-storey,
five-year-old building needs to have rust
cut out, then roofing and re-painting.
The quote for repainting alone is
$60,000.
Metal bolts were one of the causes of
concrete corrosion in Allawah, a tower
block of residential and holiday flats
fronting the beach at Surfers Paradise.
The bolts, used for lifting concrete
panels into place, were fitted during
construction of the 16-storey building
11 years ago. Repairers recently spent
about 3 months removing rust, resurfac-
ing and repainting the exterior.
Repairs to the Melbourne and
Metropolitan Board of Works building
in Little Collins Street cost roughly


ICI House, Melbourne: defective glass panels fell off
Hyde Park Tower, Sydney: three of its windows fell out
$17.5 million when its bluestone (basalt)
cladding began to come away in 1975. A
piece of cladding fell from the 22-storey
building two years after completion.
Spacer bars which should have been
removed had been left between the clad-
ding and the concrete building. In-
consistencies in the concrete surface,
differing expansion rates between sur-
faces and an ineffective adhesive took
their toll. The bluestone was eventually
replaced by anodised aluminium.
The architects, builders, consulting
engineers and stonemasons were sued
and an out-of-court settlement allowed
the board to recoup about $2.5 million
in money and kind leaving a shortfall
of about $l5 million to be met by rate-
payers.
The 20-year-old Commonwealth
offices at 145 Eagle Street, Brisbane,
owned by the Hammerson Group of
companies, also have cladding prob-
lems. The white cement and marble chip
facade was bonded to the concrete
building using a polyvinyl acetate bind-
er which weakened with the effects of
age and moisture. The cladding is now
being fixed to the building mechanic-
ally. The repairs, half completed on the
16-storey building, have cost about
$200,000 so far.
The four-storey College of Law
building in Chandos Street, St
Leonards, Sydney, was another victim
of brick growth which in turn caused
much of the concrete to fail and
loosened the aggregate finish. Much of
the brickwork had to be rebuilt to allow
sufficient joints for movement between
the brickwork and concrete frame.
Large sections of broken concrete and
aggregate finish were repaired or
replaced. The college sued various com-
panies and contractors but the matter
was settled out of court on terms which
may not be disclosed.
Leaking, cracking and popping win-
dows are a fact of life in modern tower
blocks. Probably the best-known Aus-
tralian example is the 20-storey ICI
House in Nicholson Street, Melbourne.
Its 2300 colored glass panels were
defective and a taxi-driver was injured
when a protective panel fell from the
building in November 1960.
The glass had been imported from
Belgium and contained traces of nickel
sulphide which changed with heat and
enlarged, causing the glass to break. Oli-
ver-Davey Industries Ltd, the suppliers,
replaced the glass.
Glass manufacturers do not guaran-
tee that every sheet will be perfect. Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass, the largest US manu-
facturer, estimates that eight to 10
panels in every 1000 will fail.
The 18-month-old Qantas building
in George Street, Sydney, has about
4000 floor-to-ceiling panes of Pittsburgh
glass of which 39 sheets have failed so
far. Each sheet, costing $lOOO, was
replaced under warranty,
Hyde Park Tower, at the corner of
Park and Elizabeth Streets, Sydney, was
wired up for one and a half years. Three
of its 1200 windows, supplied by Pitts-
burgh, fell out in 1979 and every win-
dow then was put behind wire screens
for safety reasons,
Extensive tests were conducted at
Melbourne’s La Trobe University but
John Bowen, building engineer, said
that not one test had been able to pin-
point the cause. He added that cracking
windows are “par for the course” in
high-rise buildings,
High-rise design and construction
has problems unknown in smaller
buildings. While technology has raced
ahead outstripping experience in
many cases it will never develop the
perfect glue, concrete or pane of glass,
The problems this helps create are
rarely observable in brand new build-
ings. Even years later, in the case of
concrete cancer, the only sign that it is
beginning may be a small rust spot on a
concrete wall. Because of this, some cor-
porate owners have become philosophi-
cal treating repairs as merely part of
essential, on-going maintenance. But
that is not so easy for the owner/resi-
dent or small investor, the real victims
of high-rise diseases. □

THE ARTS
Jill Perryman gets a buzz
out of the business
Regarded by many as Australia’s first lady of musical comedy, Jill Perryman is
facing a new challenge in a dramatic role. But, as GLENDA THOMPSON
reports, everything will be fine as long as there are no more wandering blowflies.
THE WAY Jill Perryman tells it, her life
has been one long and uproarious
blowflies’ revenge.
Before she became a theatre star, she
worked as a junior in a Sydney dress
shop brushing the flies out of the win-
dow. “I must have killed a close relative
of one of them because in the first show
I did, Call Me Madam , I was centre-
stage in the chorus line and Miss Evie
Hayes (I always like to give her a men-
tion because she’s a darling) was the star
and doing her bit and suddenly I had
a decollete neckline; it wasn’t a deep
plunge but it was open this blowie
went zap, right down the front of me
dress.
“I felt it walk down my cleavage,
round under my bra because it must
have been able to fit and all up the side
and oooarrgghgh it was terrible.
Oh, it was so slow!
“I was one of the peasants right in
the front row, kneeling in one of those
[arms wide-stretched, smile fixed], I
thought, ‘I can’t stand this,’ so I had to
pretend to cough and Evie’s going
Welcome to Litchenbourg’ [breaks into
song] and I’m going [coughing sound
effects] and I thought, here it goes [big
cough] and I was trying to beat the
breast and KILL it because the
TICKLE was all round the bosom.
“So eventually it was the end of the
number and I could see Evie looking,
thinking ‘What is that poor girl doing?’
because I was in agony.
“I came off and took the bra off and
there was this mangled heap which was
the dead blowie.
“Years later, I’m doing Funny Girl
and I’m standing on the steps singing
People which is the only quiet moment
in the show. With the character of
Fanny Brice, I could have turned it into
a funny situation if it had been any
other moment but I couldn’t even do a
quick involuntary movement because it
would have mucked up everything.
“I hear ... zheerrr; I think, ‘Oh,
God, it’s a blowie.’ My life is haunted by
them. I saw it: It was one of those heavy
ones and, so help me God, it landed
Jill Perryman: the moment the curtain comes down it’s “Put the kettle on”


Centre stage: Perryman as the blushing and very pregnant bride Fanny Brice in the J. C. Williamson production of Funny Girl
there ... I looked like Hitler. It landed
on my top lip and it stayed there.
“Now, I’ve got a big mouth and I
was frightened of swallowing it. Bruce
Barry, my beautiful leading man, is
[peering], I sang the rest of the song
through tight lips, very nasal production
[demonstration] because it would look
up my nose, round the outside of the
nostril. It must have been drugged or
something because it was not an ener-
getic blowfly and I was just terrified.
“At the end, the orchestra goes [clap,
indicating crescendo] ‘are the luckiest
people in [clap] the [clap] world’ and the
lights went out and I nearly knocked
myself out.”
Having checked out the Perryman
file, I had seen something of these
stories before. But, with her sparkling
delivery and with lots of taps on my
knee, she played it to the hilt and
laughed aloud.
The chatty suburban housewife with
orange lipstick a little askew turned into
the musical comedy entertainer who has
earned her renown.
The latest show is her “first serious
play without music.” The Pulitzer Prize-
winning ’night Mother has struck good
responses across the nation since it
opened at the Perth Festival last March.
It has been to Geraldton, Adelaide,
Hobart, Launceston, now Sydney. It
may play Melbourne next year.
Perryman is a suicidal middle-aged
daughter to June Salter. Director Edgar
Metcalfe has brought out the humor in-
tended by playwright Marsha Norman
which was missing in the American pro-
duction, Perryman said.
“In the role I’m doing, the woman’s
been preparing for 10 years to kill her-
self. She’s come to the end of her tether.
This is the day she’s going to do it. She
gets herself going and she’s almost
happy about it.
“The two women in America used to
cry for an hour before they went on. I’ve
never heard such rubbish. You’ve got a
heavy show to do; why exhaust yourself
before? I can understand, in an emo-
tional role, you’ve got to unwind. I can
unwind in a second. The moment the
curtain comes down, it’s ‘Put the kettle
on and let’s go home’.”
She is lucky that she is this way, she
says, because she has had a family to
look after for most of her theatrical life
... “I haven’t had time to indulge in
that kind of thing; I’ve had to get home
to babysitters or to cook tea.
“I’ve been able to have a happy
home life. I hate separations but they
might have made me a happily married
woman, because my husband and I
don’t get sick of each other.”
She has lived in Perth for the past
nine years with son Tod (now 22),
daughter Trudy (19) and dancer-chor-
eographer husband Kevan Johnston in
a big old house once owned by a secre-
tary to former prime minister John
Curtin.
A Perth friend of a friend suicided
after seeing ’night Mother but that does
not get the cast down. He would have
done it anyway, Perryman believes.
The play has given her more confi-
dence as a dramatic actor but she says
that she would give “a bummy perform-
ance with a bummy director. ... That’s
the difference even if June had a
bummy director, she’d come out tops.
I’m trained for musicals and my instinct
helps me out.”
This reminds her of her worst mo-
ment on stage.
“In Funny Girl, Fanny is one of the
Ziegfeld Follies’ beautiful girls. Well,
she’s not a beautiful girl and she says to
Mr Ziegfeld, ‘You can’t put me up there
will all those gorgeous-looking sheilas,’
you know. So it’s a bridal number and
she has this Edwardian bridal dress with
a beautiful bustle and he’s presenting
her as [sings] ‘I am the beautiful reflec-
tion of my love’s affection’ and she’s
centrestage.
“When the lights go up, unknown to
Ziegfeld, she’s put the bustle round the
front and she’s got this pregnancy
mound. It used to get a wonderful
laugh. I used to then walk down about
40 steps, with all the brides in their
gorgeous gear.
“This was in the days before strong
Velcro and my dresser must have
misfired. I stood at the top, I breathed in
to sing and I felt the Velcro open,
“As I came down the stairs, each step
it got lower and lower and by the time
I’d got to the bottom it looked like Birth
Of A Nation because there was this
awful mound underneath my skirt
which I then had to pick up, put under
my arm and walk off stage. The audi-
ence was paralytic. They thought it was
part of the show.
“I walked on in a revue once and got
a terrific laugh and didn’t know why.
There was this big pink bra, a comedy
extra OS one from the dressing room
attached to the hook of my black dress,
It was like two sails.”
Showbiz is thick in her veins. Perry


man’s career started 49 years ago when,
aged two, she made a surprise entrance
into her parents’ show.
Recently she was given a 78 record
featuring her singing father, William
Perryman. He has died and she had
never heard the suave though scratchy
tones of They Say by the Grace Grena-
diers, circa 1930. It was a gift of one of
the band members. “When I first heard
it, I got all lumpy in the throaty. When I
get home, I’m going to play it to my
Mum.”
As I left, Perryman kissed me on the
cheek and gave me a generous spray of
her Cacharel perfume. □
LITERATURE
The beloved
‘gasfire
Dickens’
By ANTHONY BURGESS
I REMEMBER J. B. Priestley denying
to me that he was a genius, but claiming
that he had “a hell of a lot of talent.” He
was not being just to himself. Talent is a
small fiddling capacity for producing
the conventional and the well-shaped. It
rarely means volcanic ebullience.
Priestley was volcanic, fertile, often
careless but never dull. It was said that
he wrote too much but that has been
said of everybody who was not a costive
product of Bloomsbury. I think
Priestley had genius and that it was
never appreciated sufficiently.
He died at a ripe age and was per-
haps able to see the start of the swing of
the tide of appreciation in a new genera-
tion that was discovering him. My own
generation had been warned off him by
the intellectuals, who derided or
patronised him.
My first publisher, who was also and
always his, spoke of him as “the gasfire
Dickens.” The fact is that Priestley was
an intellectual himself, a man of wide
erudition, the .width of whose reading
and understanding of what he read can
be seen in his admirable Literature and
Western Man. He knew what the avant-
garde novel was all about but he prefer-
red to work in the tradition of Smollett
and Fielding, producing works with a
picaresque flavour, crammed with
characters bordering on caricature.
He liked the pose of the earthy, pipe-
smoking Yorkshireman who had never
lost his accent, never gave a hang about
literary style and wanted to entertain or-
dinary decent people with the same
down-to-earth tastes as himself.
Of course, he was always more subtle
than he wished to appear. If he scorned
experiment in his novels, he produced
in the 1930 s a series of plays which
brought something wholly original to
the theatre. Johnson over Jordan pre-
sented life after death, drawing on what
Priestley learned from the Egyptian
Book of the Dead. The time plays, begin-
ning with Dangerous Corner, were bold
enough to bring the J. W. Dunne con-
cept of the serial universe into work that
was meant to entertain and did.
His plays always had ideas in them,
though some of the ideas have dated,
like most ideas. If he was not quite a
Bernard Shaw, it was because he never
wrote memorable stage dialogue. Acting
him, I always found him easier to para-
phrase than to get by heart. This is
strange, because Priestley had a good
ear and was a reasonable musician.
I don’t think he’d want to be remem-
bered, anyway, as an ideas man. When
he was didactic, it was in the blunt man-
ner of a popular, secular preacher who
wanted us to use our common sense, not
be taken in by the spurious; to cherish
the beef and pudding tradition of an old
England he looked at with the ambigu-
ous eyes of a George Orwell. There was
a lot of the old Tory in both and a good
deal of that non-ideological socialism
which stood for the rights of the com-
mon man and was closer to non-
conformism than to Marx.
The novels, most of them, remain
good entertainment. I read The Good
J. B. Priestley: good Yorkshire common sense
Companions when I was a boy and re-
read it recently as an old man. It has
worn well, as has Angel Pavement. The
strength lies in the gusto for the physi-
cality of life pies with a dark crust,
real ale.
He hated the life-deniers mostly
the state bureaucrats whom he called
“the grey ones.” In his best novel, a
work of his old age, The Image Men,
there’s a quiet lament for the nutty taste
in grilled mutton chops.
One reviewer said: “What a clever
old thing Jack Priestley is.” This was
unworthy. He was too genuinely clever
to be patronised by admirers of Beckett
and Borges. His cleverness shows in a
novel such as Bright Day but he was
happier when it was concealed behind
uncomplicated heartiness, romance
without too much overt sex in it and a
positivist philosophy which extolled
decency and couldn’t really accept
downright wickedness. He liked his de-
testable characters to be reformed and
his nice characters to be rewarded.
He turned his back on the moral am-
biguities of life and was content, as the
18th-century novelists were, with a sim-
plicity, both ethical and psychological,
which the ordinary reader could handle.
He was not like Henry James. He
started off by admiring Hugh Walpole,
who wanted to be James’s catamite but
otherwise seemed wholesome enough.
Priestley hardly advanced the novel be-
yond Walpole. There have always been
critics ready to sneer at his being too
wholesome.
Well, we expect our Yorkshire pud-
ding and pork pies to be wholesome, so
why not our novels? There is,
of course, a very good answer
to that and Priestley knew it as
well as anyone. But he prefer-
red to appeal to what used to
be called a middlebrow audi-
ence, and not only in his fic-
tion and drama.
Some of us remember,
during the war, the series of
postscripts he gave on the
BBC after the Sunday nine
o’clock news. He spoke com-
mon sense in a comforting
Yorkshire accent husky with
pipe smoke. He spoke of
decency; he told us why we
were fighting the war.
He was perhaps the last of
the literary men willing to
spill out of the confines of his
study and dare to be a public
figure revered for what he
stood for and not just what he
wrote. What he wrote, at least
a good half of it, ought to sur-
vive.
The young seem to be

TELEVISION
A chilling
portrait
of a zealot
Jerry Falwell, left, in Sydney with clergyman Fred Nile and politician Jim Cameron
AUSTRAL-INTERNATIONL
By GERALDINE WALSH
IF YOU stupidly thought that television
was intended to entertain and occasion-
ally to inform, you can be put straight
by the first program of the new Encoun-
ters series on ABC TV (Thursday,
August 30, 9.25 pm).
The subject of Portrait Of An Ameri-
can Zealot, Ed McAtee, asserts with all
the confidence of the self-proclaimed
morally-righteous that “God gave us
television and radio to propagate the
gospel.”
For the lapsed, the atheist, the agnos-
tic or the religiously apathetic, religious
television normally promises the pros-
pect of being bored to sobs. It can be
something of a turn-off even for the de-
vout or the moderately-believing. But
not for McAtee: for him, it is a market-
ing tool the message is the medium.
McAtee is a leader in that strange,
recent American social phenomenon
the Moral Majority.
Portrait Of An American Zealot is
one of the most chilling programs ever
to go to air on Australian TV.
Tennessee-born McAtee was for 28
years a toothpaste salesmen. He pro-
claims that he “can sell anything” and
that his selling record was “tremen-
dous.”
The hard-eyed, podgy little hustler
struck paydirt when he met like-minded
religious conservatives such as the
Moral Majority’s Jerry Falwell. McAtee
realised that marketing skills could fur-
ther “the cause” and that a coalition of
right-wing politicians, businessman and
religious leaders would have consider-
able political clout.
With money, people and know-how,
as well as clever use of the media, they
could “hold the line against the moral
drift of America.”
In one shot, a dewy-eyed (or is it
rheumy-eyed?) Ronald Reagan has a
beatific look as Falwell whips an audi-
ence into an avowal to vote for the
Chief.
McAtee and his mates are against
abortion, integration, busing, radicals
(anybody who isn’t one of them), social
welfare and liberal economic policies
all predictable positions for the far
right. But the viewer’s blood may run
cold when he describes how he sees
himself as a latter-day David propelling
himself to the forefront of battle. No
slingshots for Ed; he’s a man of the 80s
and knows all about nu-clear weaponry
which he believes is no accident but
God’s design. He believes that nuclear
warfare may be God’s way to rid the
world of evil and make it a better place
for people.
Anyway, McAtee says cheerily, if it
comes to that: “Before we go, they go.”
Whether “they” are the Russians or
everyone else bar saved Americans and
Israelis (from the only other great na-
tion he says was founded for the glory
of God) is not clear.
McAtee is cunning, aggressive,
under-educated and very frightening.
He does not do a lot to heighten the
humor of Reagan’s “joke” about
bombing Russia in five minutes.
TWO OF the local programs previewed
from the Encounters series Friends
And Foes (October 18) and In Constant
Pursuit (November 8) - look, respect-
ively, at Christian Chinese in the
Peoples Republic and at the Salvation
Army in Australia.
Just as Ed McAtee sees the propaga-
tion of his non-Christian Christianity as
a battle, the Salvationists see themselves
as a military unit who with old-
fashioned, born-again morality wage
war on the evils of drink and drugs.
Producer/director Brian Nicholls
and reporter Vaughan Hinton have
cleverly brought out the dilemma facing
the modern practitioners of “Christian-
ity with its sleeves rolled up.” Genera-
tions of pure living have made many
Salvation Army families eminently re-
spectable and economically middle-
class. Where once they faced disrupters
hired by breweries and brothels, they
have become part of the smooth work-
ing of society.
One Sally interviewed contends that
“we’ve lost the cutting edge to our evan-
gelism ... we don’t offend people the
way we should ... the dilemma for the
Salvation Army is strategy. The enemies
are the same but their attacks are
oblique.”
A retired major speaks of revolution
being the original idea behind the for-
mation of the army but says that some
of the revolutionary spirit has been lost.
REVOLUTION looms large in Friends
And Foes where Marxism, ergo atheism,
crossed the Yangtse in the China of
1949 and the Christian missionaries
gradually had to leave.
One ex-missionary estimates, how-
ever, that the Christian population of
China now is somewhere from 10-20
million. Francis James, who was de-
tained in China for three years and four
months and 16 days from 1969, has no
sense of contradiction: “Some Commu-
nists I know are better Christians than
some Christians,” he says. James be-
lieves that “the Chinese are closer to
original Christianity than we are.”
In the program, Bishop K. H. Ting is
reunited with James during a visit to
Australia with the Chinese Christian
Council. Ting is an impressive religious
thinker who sees 1949 as having truly
liberated his country.
He has no time for what he terms
narcotic religion, aiming to help people
forget their suffering so that they may go
to heaven when they die. Ting is first
and foremost a Chinese and believes
that Chinese communism seeks to find
common ground on major issues that
being the only way to make the nation
prosperous. Seeking common ground
has made it possible for the communists
and the Christians in China to find their
accommodation. □


OPERA
A new Aida
beauty without
the elephants
By BRIAN HOAD
AFTER AN absence of seven years that
most popular of grand operas, Verdi’s
Aida, has returned to the repertoire of
the Australian Opera in a new produc-
tion by Christopher Renshaw. It is bet-
ter, much better than its vulgar prede-
cessor which was consumed in a ware-
house conflagration of 1978. It remains
to be seen whether it proves as popular.
It could hardly prove more popular.
From its launching in the concert hall of
the Sydney Opera House in January
1975, the old Tom Lingwood/Stephen
Hall circus managed a total of 32 per-
formances over three successive seasons
before fate intervened tastefully. It
chalked up a company record in the
process 96.9 percent of all seats sold.
As the production which pioneered
the use of the concert hall for staged
opera (and which established
the Sydney summer season on
a permanent basis) it holds an
honored place in the history
of the company’s en-
trepreneurial development.
On an artistic level, it was a
shallow exercise in bombastic
spectacle at the expense of the
work’s human significance;
and when you lose Verdi’s hu-
manity you lose his essential
genius.
As crowd-pleasers, the
1975-77 performances of Aida
were on a par with those per-
ennial tourist attractions
staged in the Metro-Goldwyn-
Memphis manner at that mel-
ancholy monument to im-
perial decline and fall, the
Baths of Caracalla in Rome
or, even more appropriately,
at the Roman arena in Ver-
ona. A premature climax in
the military triumphs of Act
11, scene 2, was usually pre-
sented and received on the
level of a nazi rally.
The ensuing human drama
was lost in the vast settings.
And the majority of the audi-
ence, by this time rather
bored, usually wished they
could have had a re-run of Act
11, scene 2 instead.
Faced with this grotesque if popular
misinterpretation of Verdi’s intentions,
some directors attempt to redress the
balance by emphasising the anti-fascist
therne of the opera; for when the trum-
pets blow in Act 11, scene 2, they an-
nounce the emptiness of all imperial tri-
umphs and comment on every regime of
oppressive and persecuting clerics.
As demonstrated so brilliantly in
Elijah Moshinsky’s new production of
II Trovatore for the company last year,
Verdi’s inspiration was bound up inex-
tricably with the human experience of
the political turmoils of his own times.
Aida may well have been commissioned
for a new opera house in Cairo but fore-
most in his mind at the time of composi-
tion in 1870 was the resistance of the
papal states (and the machinations of
the “shrewd priests”) against the unifi-
cation of Italy; above all, the Franco-
Prussian war.
Verdi’s distrust of the Germans was
impassioned. In Bismarck he saw the
new Attila. He condemned the attacks
on France as “a racist war.” And he
prophesied with a heavy heart that Ger-
many would over-run all Europe.
No director should take such back-
ground too literally. Audiences do not
take kindly to being confronted with the
idea that in enjoying the pomp of the
piece they are in any way nazi-minded.
But what the background does em-
Ermanno Mauro as Radames in Aida
phasise is that, in Aida, Verdi was deal-
ing with themes close to his heart;
themes such as love of liberty, both per-
sonal and national; and a detestation of
tyranny, both political and ecclesiasti-
cal. Its characters are enmeshed in a
web of church and state where their de-
cisions affect one another and the fate of
nations.
It is such themes which Renshaw’s
new production pick up, emphasising
the complex conflict of personal emo-
tions. This intimate approach is dictated
largely by the intimate nature of the
small opera theatre for which this pro-
duction is designed. But these limita-
tions do not preclude a broader, politi-
cal overview as well. The Pharaoh
(Bruce Martin) and his daughter,
Amneris (Margreta Elkins), stiff and
white-faced, carried around on litters
like tin gods, are merely the puppets of a
masked and sinister priesthood. And
the triumph scene on a small scale is all
the more hollow for that.
Traditionalists will be relieved to
learn that the setting by Kenneth
Rowell is strictly Egyptian, massively
monumental, authentically detailed but
never fussy. Only a wood and steel stair-
case in the final act jars as an anachron-
ism.
The major innovation is to join
together the four spectacular scenes of
Acts I and 11. It is confusing to call the
resulting display Act I and re-number
the following two acts (while the pro-
gram notes refer to the original four-act
version). But the gain in getting all the
pomp and circumstances over in one
fell swoop, leaving the rest of the even-
ing free to concentrate on the individual
destinies of the characters, is consider-
able.
And it is in the final two acts that the
strong casting of this production domi-
nates the stage. In the American so-
prano, Marilyn Zschau, the company
has found a fine, strong Aida of great
warmth. In the Italian/Canadian tenor,
Ermanno Mauro, there is a brazen-
voiced Radames of thrilling clarity and
power. And both have that springy at-
tack in voice and action which makes
for very exciting opera.
The Amneris of Elkins, well-known
from the previous production of Aida, is
all the more powerful in close focus (if
somewhat misdirected in her writhings
around the wood and steel staircase of
the final act). And it is power again, ani-
mal power, which distinguishes the
Amonasro of John Shaw, at the top of
his finest form.
The considerable pleasures of this
fine night of opera are completed by the
orchestra under Stuart Challender who
draws so much marvellous beauty, often
of great delicacy, from Verdi’s richly
melodic score that it all sounds fresh
and new again. □

After pushing new Toyota Camry through a course
of witches hats, one thing will be obvious.
It handles like you're driving something sophis-
ticated and expensive from Europe.
All you need do is take a look underneath Camry
and you'll discover why.
You see, the new Camry has gas pressure shock
absorbers at the front and fully independent suspension.
With the control of rack and pinion steering and
front wheel drive.
ALL VERY ADVANCED. ALL VERY SPORTY.
And better than a lot of other cars with similar
features. That's because Camry's advanced features are
specially tuned to work together in complete harmony.
The result is new Camry now handles even better
than the previous model that won Car of 'B3.
So even though Camry is a family car, you could be
excused for actually enjoying a winding mountain road.
You could even be excused for
enjoying Camry on the open road.
After all - you do have a Super
Responsive 2 litre engine with elec-
tronic fuel injection under your right foot.

Camry now has more luxury appointments.
There's a new tilt steering column for a more
comfortable driving position.
Further improvements have been made in-
side with a redesigned dash and seats with new cloth

Australians
take to
the streets
By SANDRA HALL
SATURDAY Night Fever, Flashdance,
Beat Street, Streets of Fire, and now
Street Hero, the first Australian contri-
bution to the school of urban rock.
It has the slick, neon-lit look of its
forebears; a stylish, driving soundtrack
organised by Paul Dainty and worked
smoothly into the narrative; and a tor-
mented hero who finds his salvation
when he stops punching heads to punch
out rock ’n’ roll.
It was shot in Melbourne but that
hasn’t been allowed to spoil anything.
Brian Thomson’s designs and Vince
Monton’s cinematography give every
location the gleam and glow endemic to
the genre; and to heighten the cosmo-
politanism Vinnie, the hero, is Italo-
Australian with Mafia connections and
haunting memories of his father, a
promising boxer and part-time stand-
over man for the mob, who died young.
The interesting thing about this cal-
culated artificiality is that it works up
to a point. Michael Pattinson, who di-
rected, and Jan Sardi, who wrote the
script, have learnt the language of this
particular fantasyland well enough to
feel at ease with it. There is none of the
cringing associated with Australian
films trying to disguise their origins.
Australian accents are heard where it’s
natural for them to be heard; the for-
mula has been not copied but adapted.
But the slickness has exacted a price.
The narrative skims along, sliding from
episode to episode, and while the im-
pressions pile up the characters remain
somewhere in long shot but lacking the
energy level to bridge that vital space
between screen and audience.
As Vinnie, Vince Colosimo has
everything it takes to be a teenage hero
but humor. And to audiences brought
up on the street-wise kids from Brook-
lyn and the Bronx, that has to be a cru-
cial disadvantage. He has the right walk
he’s learned to strut a la Travolta
but there’s none of the self-parody that
helped Travolta to take the audience
with him in Saturday Night Fever and,
since the script has neglected to give
Vinnie any lines worth repeating, he
needs that kind of dazzle.
Vinnie is a nice boy who loves his
mother (Peta Toppano, doing a fair job
of looking care-worn) and his younger
half-brother and sister, while justifiably
hating his thug of a stepfather. He has
also inherited both his father’s job of
errand boy to the mob and his father’s
old boxing trainer, George (Ray Mar-
shall). George thinks the boy’s future is
in the ring. Vinnie’s mother just wishes
he would listen to his music teacher
(Sandy Gore) and join the school band.
Music wins, of course, and Vinnie is
soon beating out his frustration on the
drums. After wrecking one rehearsal, he
stays on alone drumming through the
night and emerges next morning know-
ing it all.
But in films such as this, self-taught
musicians constitute permissible mir-
acles. They fit in with Thomson’s stagey
set, which has been built to contain and
symbolise all the dubious temptations
of Vinnie’s night-time world. It takes the
shape of a single red-lit street, looking a
little like sideshow alley. Located within
it are the Mafia hang-out, the boxing
gymnasium and the place where
Vinnie’s girlfriend, Gloria (Sigrid
Thornton) is trying mysteriously to earn
enough money to escape all this.
She seems a little too classy and
sophisticated both for Vinnie and West
City High, which is somewhere between
the utterly believable Australian high
school of Ken Cameron’s film, Fast
Talking, and the showbiz delinquency
of Grease and Welcome Back, Kotter.
Amanda Muggleton, with clipped
tones and button-up manner, does well
as the school villain, Miss Reagan, and
Gore is best of all as Bonnie Rogers, the
music teacher, who dresses with spec-
tacular appropriateness in army camou-
flage gear. When she’s on screen, the
right connections are made; tensions
and sympathies start to build. When she
goes they go with her and all you’re left
with is style which is not quite enough.
SUGAR CANE ALLEY, one of the
most popular films of this year’s festival
season and now in commercial release,
is another story about growing up but its
style is casual, discursive and slyly in-
gratiating. Its director, Euzhan Palcy
(making her first feature film), takes her
time in telling it, displaying all the con-
fidence of someone convinced of the
quality of her material.
Adapted from the novel, La Rue
Cases Negres, by Joseph Zobel, it is set
in the 30s in one of the “black shack
alleys” of Martinique, the makeshift
plantation villages where the cane-
cutters live. Jose (Garry Cadenat), who
is 11, has his playmates, his grand-
mother M’man Tine (an actress blessed
with the name Darling Legitimus) and
an intelligence keen enough to win him
a scholarship in the nearby town of Fort
de France if he can only get there.
M’man Tine is determined that he
will and that he’ll have his chance at a
much larger life than either of them
have known so far. Palcy turns their ad-
ventures into a vital and touching film,
imbued with the kind of colloquial inti-
macy that engages audiences wherever
they happen to live.
Street Hero could have used some. □

ema City; in Melbourne at the Capitol

Imagine
soper
it could reduce
a grown musician
to tears.
FROM PHILIPS
THE CREATORS OF
COMPACT DISC
DIGITAL AUDIO
a grown musician
to tears.


Danny Beckerman is one of the real
renaissance men of modern music, He has
orchestrated for Rick Wakeman, produced
for Alex Harvey, composed for Status Quo
and worked with Rod Stewart.
Not to mention composing several
film scores, including the recent Australian
hit "Moving Out".
Here Danny notes his impressions
upon hearing ''The Concerts in China" bv
Jean-Michel Jarre on a Philips Compact
Disc Player.
"The things I could have done, the
sounds you could have heard, if only Philips
had been able to give us their remarkable
creation earlier,
It brings a tear to my eye, to think of
what might have been.
You see, in the recording studio, it is
always vital for me to know that whatever
sounds I create, the listener will hear them in
exactly the same way,
But until recently that has never been
entirely possible.
The modern electronic synthesisers
that I find I most often work with have an
incredible range from ultra-low pulsating
throbs through to the most delicate
high-pitched sounds. Conventional
records are hard pushed to cope
with them without compromising
the overall dynamics.
The Philips Compact Disc
Player has put an end to all this.
Listening to "The Concerts in
China" on Compact Disc, one can
truly appreciate the clarity and
subtleties of an ever-changing
stereo soundscape.
Jarre's music drifts and flows
through "Fishing Junks at Sunset" to the
attacking synthesisers of "Magnetic Fields".
His unique style of electronic music and the
haunting magic of the Peking Conservatoire
Symphony Orchestra although vastly
different in timbre and technique, complement
each other all the more magnificently on the
Philips Compact Disc Player.
I have been inspired by hearing this
recording. At least from now on, thanks to
Philips, I can record in the studio fully
confident that what I hear is what you will
hear on Compact Disc."
Classical, jazz, rock, no matter what
your taste, many hundreds of titles are
already available on compact disc.
Music that will last forever, because the
disc will last forever. The music is stored in

BOOKS
Secrets of
a haughty
couturier
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
Hardy Amies: Still Here.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson/Hodder
and Stoughton, $24.95.
IMPROBABLE though it may seem,
Hardy Amies best known as the
Queen’s dressmaker was a spy in
World War II: a sort of M to real-life
007 s.
He ran the Belgian section of the
Special Operations Executive HQ in
Baker Street, London, putting the fin-
ishing touches on spies as they learnt the
genteel arts of sabotage and etiquette
under torture before parachuting be-
hind enemy lines. He kept his dress-
making business going, too, commuting
daily between pins and grenades, and
built up a flourishing business to South
America.
Major Amies, as he was then, felt so
awful sitting behind his desk instead of
jumping with the chaps (officers had
more to reveal under torture) that he de-
veloped an inferiority complex. So he
took a parachute course in Manchester
and five successful jumps later won a
badge. He sewed this on with pride be-
cause, as he put it, “... it counteracted
the softness of my green Intelligence
Corps cap.” It annihilated his inferi-
ority complex. The subject never came
up again.
This year the 75-year-old haughty
couturier celebrates 50 years in the
fashion business, a golden time for the
man who can still rely on loyal clients to
buy haute couture ($2OOO plus 15 per-
cent VAT for a good cloth coat), prod-
uce a variety of goods from factory
overalls to semi-expensive ready-to-
wear and handle 48 menswear licensee
operations abroad. The world, it seems,
is full of tacky men wishing they were
Beau Brummel wearing a Hardy Amies
good taste suit. Enough, anyway, to
make the designer $l5 million a year.
Nowadays when Amies drops in
with his status label at affordable prices
it is by first-class jet, not parachute. In
one hand he carries his tennis gear, in
the other his petit-point : the hallmarks
of the ultimate globetrotter.
Like Pierre Cardin, another of the
few designers who travel, he knows the
value of keeping in touch with the
peasants and licensees. Amies’ gang of
48 cannot compare with Cardin’s army
of 500 but Amies doesn’t care. He won’t
market any old thing. Gentlemen don’t
wear jewellery.
Besides, he has the Queen not so
much a product as the most desirable
client in the world. And the most deter-
minedly frumpish.
He has made clothes for 58 royal
tours and state visits and a nerve-wrack-
ing, stomach-knotting 30 years they
have been. What do you do when the
Queen announces that she intends wear-
ing boots to the King of Saudi Arabia’s
picnic in the desert and you had
planned a seductive Marlene Dietrich/
Gary Cooper look?
You and I would get ulcers. Amies
wrapped her head to toe in chiffon crepe
so the boots would not be seen.
Sometimes, in his darker moments,
he feels like chucking it all and moving
to New York. Then he remembers his
friend Bill Blass, the American designer,
criticised to death for giving his name to
chocolates.
If there’s one thing Amies would
adore, it’s a chocolate licence. They
would be bitter dark on the outside,
piercingly sweet in the middle. And if,
like the Queen, he had his way (and he
would) he would ban all milk chocolate.
Forever.
He would quite like to design flower
pots, too. □

Just what
makes the
famous tick?
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
In The Psychiatrist’s Chair, by
Anthony Clare. Chatto and
Windus/Hogarth Press, $12.95.
ANTHONY CLARE is a 42-year-old
Dublin-born professor of psychological
medicine at St Bartholomew’s Medical
School, London. He is engaged in
teaching, research, clinical work and
administration inside and outside
Bart’s. He has a wife and six children.
Through BBC contacts he began to
do book reviews for radio and then
ventured into assisting on a three-part
series called Thicker Than Water, about
family relations.
In 1982, in answer to what he calls
the “burgeoning boom in self-explora-
tion” which started in California and
has been exported, he began an on-air
series of interviews with people whose
names were presumed to be known to
the listeners.
He said: “I had met a lot of people
who were curious as most of us are
about what drives, sustains and motiv-
ates others through their lives; how they
survive setbacks and if and
how they cope when disaster
does occur in other words,
what makes them tick.”
Following the series, Clare
became a popular success but
he does not go in for pop psy-
chology. He had doubts about
the whole exercise. He knew
he would be charged with
voyeurism.
“And, of course, people do
get a vicarious pleasure from
listening to the defects and
problems of others hence
the agony columns in news-
papers and magazines,” he
has said.
This book contains nine
unedited interviews from the
series. Everybody will have
heard of two or three of the
people: actress Glenda Jack-
son, Spike Milligan, the play-
wright Arnold ( Chicken Soup
With Barley ) Wesker. Then
there is Judge Christmas
Humphreys, founder of the
British Buddhist Society, a
judge at the Old Bailey, son of
the barrister who was junior
counsel for the defence at the
trial of Oscar Wilde; Nell
Dunn, author of the play
Steaming which toured a year


ago in Australia with great success;
David Irving, the non-historian who in
his book Hitler’s War expressed the
view that the Jewish holocaust did not
occur; Hugh Dudley, professor of aca-
demic surgery at St Mary’s Hospital
Medical School in London (“a surgeon
still wields great personal power in
these days of the committee man”);
Peter Marsh, advertising man, perhaps
the star of the English practitioners; and
Nemone Lethbridge, lawyer, writer,
wife of a convicted murderer.
The substance of these interviews
cannot be expressed in capsule form.
Perhaps the flavor of each can be con-
veyed in question and answer quotes.
Clare to Jackson: How worried do
you get?
Jackson: I worry to the point of actu-
ally growing an ulcer, to the point where
it physically expresses itself and I
physically shake, go into a kind of rigor.
Clare to Irving: Looking back, there
is nothing for which you feel ashamed?
Irving: I think it was a mistake get-
ting married. Getting married takes 20
years off your life. Dedicating your re-
sources to raising a family is like blood-
letting.
Clare to Wesker: In view of your
central European background, would
you describe yourself as an English-
man?
Wesker: Everywhere but in England.
I feel very English abroad but I don’t
feel English in England.
Clare to Dunn: You say you haven’t
allowed sex to take you over. Have you
put it into a compartment?
Dunn: No, I’ve always been very in-
terested in sex. I think it’s funny as well
as moving. It has given me a tremen-
dous amount of warmth and closeness
and fun.
Clare to Dudley: What is the tempta-
tion like to play to the gallery in the
surgical operating room?
Dudley: There is, of course, great
temptation and wholly to suppress that
temptation may well be wrong. An el-
ement of showmanship may well en-
hance performance.
Clare to Lethbridge: When you were
called to the Bar, how much did you use
the fact that you were an attractive
woman?
Lethbridge: As much as I could. I’d
no scruples at all.
Clare to Humphreys: How did you
feel about your wife not being able to
have any children?
Humphreys: Not the slightest worry.
I think I would have been almost an-
noyed if we’d had children because they
would have got in the way of my life.
Clare to Marsh: Does your ability to
manipulate people give you a certain
pleasure?
Marsh: Yes, all successful people
have got to be like that.
Clare to Milligan: Are you a tolerant
man?
Milligan: Not of idiots and fools. If
anything is retrograde and pulling the
world down and destroying the future
for children or imposing suffering on
animals, I will combat it.
If that’s called intolerance, then I’m
intolerant. I wouldn’t say it’s intoler-
ance, though. □
The magazine
as a mirror
of its times
Glenda Jackson: worried to the point of ulcers
CAMERA PRESS (LN/POST)
By GERARD WINDSOR
Just City And The Mirrors:
Meanjin Quarterly And The
Intellectual Front 1940-1965, by
Lynne Strahan. University Press,
$25.
WITH SUCH a title, a book can only
improve. And it does. But not before Dr
Strahan has waged a stout campaign to
keep readers at bay. This is perverse be-
cause the subject itself might seem to
confine the book to the specialist. How
many Australians subscribe to or read
the literary magazines?
Compared with its colleagues, the
Brisbane-born but long Melbourne-
based Meanjin has a high profile but it
touched a circulation peak of 4000 in
1945 and 40 years later is considerably
below that. Who is going to read a book
about a magazine which so few people
read?
Dilemmas exist to be tackled and
Strahan grasps this one very deftly.
Meanjin, she argues, was a superb mir-
ror of the times between 1940 and 1965
(which is not to say that it is not still).
Look at Meanjin its publishing
struggles as much as its contents and
you will have a true picture of
the major intellectual and
ideological concerns of that
era. And her argument, gross-
ly as I have simplified it, is
convincing. Her book should
stimulate and be enjoyed by
anyone with an interest in
Australian history, politics or
cultural life.
Why, then, is it an exasper-
ating book?
The nub of the problem is
the style: At best, it might be
called fruity; at its worst it is
mixed metaphor and linguis-
tic arcana run riot.
A fair example of the fruity
might be Strahan’s contention
that “nationalism is to culture
what carbonation is to lemon-
ade.”
When the language gets
further into its stride, it prod-
uces gems that are as
obfuscating as they are enjoy-
able such as “the Catholic
right, and several of their pol-
itical burrs, were in the pro-
cess of earning a loose-leaf
folder of heavenly dispensa-
tions.” The welter of meta-
phor to which Strahan is ad-
dicted clouds her sense. She will not let
a noun come within reach without
nailing one or two adjectives to it.
The work of Melbourne historian
Kathleen Fitzpatrick is referred to
twice. On page 226, she “crafted enam-
elled prose”; 15 pages later in the
same era, articles, etc she is crafting
“kid-skin prose.” What the heck!
But the style is seductive. Perversely,
I find Strahanese fun. Swallow the first
few pages womanfully and, after a
while, the taste grows on you.
The Just City part of the title is, odd-
ly, straightforward: it sums up the
vision of Dr Clem Christesen, the
founding and 34-year editor of Meanjin.
And The Mirrors is infinitely more prob-
lematic and sums up Strahan’s vision of
the atmosphere in which the magazine
lived and, probably, of the editor him-
self. It is a composite notion, cobbled
together from one of Yeats’ knottier
poems, The Statues (where “knowledge
increases unreality ... Mirror on mirror
mirrored is all the show”) and Hans
Andersen’s The Snow Queen in which a
wicked goblin (not, one presumes, Dr


Christesen) invents a distorting mirror
that makes good things shrink away but
magnifies bad things enormously. The
Strahan thesis is that the 50s was “a dec-
ade when the lines between the political
and the non-political, engagement and
detachment, objectivity and subjectivity
were unclear ... language was pushed
to extremes and became a confusing
mirror in which character and meaning
were deformed, rather than clarified.”
More simply perhaps, Meanjin
above all has represented the orthodoxy
of the Australian intellectual a slight
but constant list to the left. The ortho-
doxy of the common man (including the
politicians) has been a little the other
way. Hence conflict, etc, etc.
If you like a bracing wrestle with a
book, here’s your chance. Just City is
rich in suggestiveness about Australian
life; eg, that modernism and national-
ism were seen as opposed, that the pessi-
mistic, cosmopolitan vision of incoher-
ence, rootlessness and desolation of a
work such as Eliot’s The Waste Land
was not what a young country needed
for its art. Just City is peppered with the
acute, testy, aphoristic, rhetorical,
bitchy remarks of Australian writers
and intellectuals culled from what must
be the magnificennt correspondence
files of Meanjin. (It is a matter for
headshaking that some very dull
poetasters could write most salty, ex-
pressive prose.) Give this book the close
encounter it deserves. As it records one
writer saying of another, it’s “the eel’s
eyebrows for crankiness.” □
BOOK BULLETIN
From horror to horror
by Patricia Rolfe
THERE’s a character for any novelist in
the boy who used to play over to himself
an old 78rpm record of the summing-up
speech his father, British chief prosecu-
tor, made at the Nuremberg war crimes
trials and who in manhood witnesses
and writes about events in Kampuchea
in the late 1970 s “holocaust” or not, it
was a great deal of suffering. William
Shawcross’s Eclipse: Cambodia, Holo-
caust And Modern Conscience has just
been published by Andre Deutsch but
local agents are unsure if and when it
will be here.
Shawcross, who covered South-east
Asia for the London Sunday Times for
years, in 1979 published Sideshow an
account of how President Nixon and
Henry Kissinger flouted international
and United States constitutional law by
ordering the secret bombing of neutral
Kampuchea in 1969.
In Eclipse, Shawcross looks at the
sometimes gullible and muddled inter-
national aid agencies and their some-
times self-seeking and competitive field
workers and concludes that in Kampu-
chea this work may finally have done as
much harm as good.
“The humanitarian instincts of
people around the world and the man-
Richard Walsh: subduing the “floridity and syntactical eccentricity” of Miles Franklin
dates of the organisations that are sup-
posed to protect and to implement our
collective co nscience were exploited by
almost all sides to serve political ends,”
he writes. It’s an interesting point as to
whether international aid organisations,
supposed to represent our “collective
conscience,” should feed the hungry,
clothe the naked and hang the conse-
quences or whether they can any longer
avoid being part of politics.
Allen and Unwin have just published
Cambodia by Michael Vickery, an Am-
erican working at the Centre for Asian
Studies in Adelaide. South End in the
US and in Britain will publish it.
Vickery’s first-hand knowledge of the
country dates back to 1960 and his wife
is Cambodian.
SALMAN RUSHDIE and his publisher
Jonathan Cape have apoligised to the
Indian High Court for references in
Midnight’s Children. An incident in
which Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s
son Sanjay accuses her of contributing
to her husband’s death by neglect will
be cut from future editions. The action
will probably make many people look
up exactly what Rushdie wrote gener-
ally the value of such libel cases.
THIRTY YEARS after the death of
Miles Franklin, her original publisher
Angus and Robertson has, according
to its Richard Walsh, tried to “subdue
the floridity and syntactical eccentricity
that are the hallmarks of Miles Franklin
at her worst” (ie, she’s been edited) and
next month will issue a new version of
Up The Country.
Up The Country was published in
1928 by Blackwoods of Edinburgh,
after Franklin flounced out of A and R
Blackwoods issued the other two books
of the trilogy, Ten Creeks Run and Back
To 800 l 8001, within a few years. Frank-
lin was reconciled with A and R in 1951
and Beatrice Davis edited a new edition
of Up The Country. This probably be-
cause of difficulties with the author is,
Walsh says, “often clotted by over-
blown verbiage.”
The new A and R edition, edited by
Sue Phillips, is an earlier manuscript
found among the Franklin papers held
by antiquarian bookseller Berkelouw.
Similar ms exist of the other two books
in the trilogy and A and R plans to issue
them. Walsh is among the most alert of
publishers at selling film rights. The
strong storyline of Up The Country
should make it a good prospect. □

AN ANNUAL REPORT BY THE BULLETIN
COMMUNICATIONS
AND EOUIDMENT


BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT
THE END OF THE
AGE OF INNOCENCE
BUSINESS computer buyers are losing
their innocence.
It started about 12 months ago. Per-
haps it was just one too many meretri-
cious advertisement about “user friend-
liness” or “integrated software” or how
you master spreadsheets in one easy
lesson.
Or perhaps it was the high school
whizz-kids or the ex-photocopier
salespeople “advising” prospects on
their business computing needs.
Whatever the cause, business buyers
are bewaring. Many are still confused
about computers and computer-soft-
ware but the naivety is on its way out.
To a business buyer, whether a prod-
uct or service can whistle Annie Laurie
through a keyhole or is the cheapest
around is largely irrelevant. It must do
the job for which it was bought, it must
not become obsolete before its (de-
preciated) time. It must cope with
changing or expanding needs. And the
seller must stand by the product.
In 1984, one computer product out-
standingly meets those criteria: it is a
software program called Lotus 1-2-3.
Described by the New York Times
newspaper as “the wave of the future in
business computing,” Lotus 1-2-3 com-
bines an advanced electronic spread-
sheet and electronic filing holding a
couple of thousand or so records with
the ability to produce sophisticated
business graphics. The program has out-
sold every other software package in the
United States and is said to account for
more than 40 percent of all business
software currently sold. Sales have ex-
ceeded $B5 million in the first 18
months.
It’s a complex package and, thus,
takes time to learn. Experienced users
say that you need six months to a year
to become “fluent” but at least the docu-
mentation is in English, rather than
the pseudo-mathematical dialect of
Sanskrit that computer technocrats
force on an incredulous world.
Lotus 1-2-3 is not perfect but it is so
good in so many different ways that it
has set a standard for business software.
Business people now know that you can
obtain software which does what busi-
ness needs, with instruction manuals
As in previous
years, this
feature has been
prepared and
written by
COLLYN RIVERS.
Rivers was the
founder-editor of
the now
worldwide
Electronics
Today International. He is managing
director of Vernon Rivers Associates
Pty Ltd, a specialised technical
writing organisation. Within Australia,
Vernon Rivers & Associates prepare
business computing features
exclusively for The Bulletin and its
associated publication Australian
Business.
which business people can understand.
The program does not include word
processing but the developers have re-
leased a more advanced version called
Symphony which includes word pro-
cessing and other facilities. Existing 1-2-
3 users may have their software updated
for a nominal charge.
Lotus was written specifically for the
IBM PC in the first place. The writers
realised that that product, too, was just
what business people sought: a down-
to-earth device supplied by a company
which understood business needs and
would still be in business next year.
The IBM PC is the silicon equivalent
of a Volvo car and is bought for similar
considered reasons. The PC dominated
the market within months of release and

Laboratories
has changed the nature of business com-
puting.
A substantial section of the small-
computer industry has still not worked
out why.
The rapid acceptance of the IBM PC
as a serious business machine caused
unexpected problems for some major
equipment manufacturers who did not
have personal computers in their prod-
uct range or under development for
many businesses and other organisa-
tions have learned of the difficulties of
interfacing equipment from different
suppliers and now insist upon buying
all the bits and pieces from one source.
“Badge engineering” has been the
solution. AT&T bought a 25 percent
shareholding in Olivetti and sells that
company’s personal computers in the
US. Burroughs and NEC market Con-
vergent Technologies’ small computers
under their brand names. Control Data
and Honeywell are taking products
from Columbia Data Products. Sperry
has a joint development agreement with
Mitsubishi and ICL has various ar-
rangements with Logica, PERQ and
RAIR.
REDUCING USER HOSTILITY
THE CURRENT year has seen a con-
certed and welcome attempt by several
manufacturers to make their products
less “user hostile” at least on first ac-
quaintance.
Apple Computers has taken this ap-
proach further than most with its
technically innovative Macintosh and
Lisa. With both machines, moving a
handheld “mouse” causes an electronic-
ally-related screen pointer to move to
various icons which illustrate functions
available. When the desired function
has been selected, pressing a button on
the mammal causes that function to be
executed.
Hewlett-Packard has taken another
approach. That company’s excellently
engineered HP 150 enables a user to sel-
ect and perform a wide range of tasks
by pointing a finger at indicated areas
on the screen, just in front of which tiny
infra-red beams form a matrix of verti-
cal and horizontal beams. The user’s
finger breaks one vertical and one hori-
zontal beam. Sensors then calculate
which part of the screen the user is
pointing at and call up or move data
accordingly even, perhaps, to “lure it
back to cancel half a line.”
Attempts have also been made to
have software quicker and easier to
learn. The challenge is to make software
acceptable to the constant user (who
can become infuriated by having in-
exorably to follow a sequence of menus
to enter routine data) yet still avail those
who do not use it often enough to be
able to memorise the various functions,
key sequences and commands. The re-
sults so far have tended to be software
which is easier to learn but tedious once
mastered.
The ideal is probably “forgiving”
software with two or three levels of ac-
companying assistance.
Quick-to-learn software has one out-
standing advantage: it shortens the
“MTA” (Mean Time to Anger). This is
the time taken for the user to discover
that the machine and/or software is
fundamentally incapable of performing
the task for which it was purchased. The
current MTA is seven weeks.
WINDOWS
THIS also is the year of the “window,”
basically a new breed of software which
enables programs to interlink and be
displayed (but not used) simultaneously
in windows on the screen either over-
lapping, as papers on a desk, or in sep-
arately divided areas as items in a news-
paper.
The concept is a logical extension of
Xerox’s Star computer workstation and
Apple Computers’ Lisa and Macintosh.
Tranferring data between programs
is achieved by a handheld “mouse”
which moves an electronic pointer to
the window containing the data to be
moved and then to the destination area


A silicon wafer 100 mm in diameter, used by Northern Telecom, contains 234 microchips. INSET: Wang’s pioneering PIC computer
of the receiving program held in a sec-
ond or further window.
The currently in-use window dis-
plays material overlapping that pre-
viously in use, a procedure which some
say merely transforms the mess on one’s
desk into a mess on one’s screen. Only
faster.
Visi On, from Visicorp, is one of the
first such programs. It runs on Wang,
Honeywell, TI, Eagle and IBM ma-
chines. The product is expensive to in-
stall for it needs a lot of memory and
hard disk storage plus graphics facilities
(including a graphics monitor).
Windows, according to the prelimi-
nary announcements, is a remarkable
piece of software from that equally
remarkable piece of liveware, Micro-
soft’s founder, 28-year-old Bill Gates.
The package will enable many other
programs (which will require re-writing
to suit) to interact and be displayed sim-
ultaneously.
EXECUTIVE NEEDS
MARKETEERS still need to place a
computer on every executive’s desk (if
not necessarily including their own) but,
as our communications feature indi-
cates, this may come about through
smart telephones connected via new-
generation digital switchboards and as-
sociated cabling.
Also becoming clear is that what
executive users need is not so much
computational ability but, rather, quick
access to corporate and other infor-
mation.
Public access data-bases exist in
many countries, accessible from any-
where in the world via a personal com-
puter and a device called a modem
which changes the computer’s bits and
bytes into a form acceptable to the tele-
phone system.
Accessing corporate data-bases via
personal computers is becoming in-
creasingly common but the procedures
are more complex than is desirable. An
international press audience saw this
demonstrated in Silicon Valley, Cali-
fornia, last January when a senior
executive whose role was to demon-
strate the technique’s simplicity failed
three times in a row to make it work.
STANDARDS LACKING
THE YEAR is passing by with inter-
national standards or industry agree-
ments on some of the most fundamental
aspects of computing still not struck.
The situation in some areas is ab-
surd. For computers in opposite parts of
the world to intercommunicate at mil-
lions of bytes a second is routinely feas-
ible, yet it is rarely possible to take a
floppy disk from one microcomputer
and use it in another unless the ma-
chines are of identical make and type.
The disks are interchangeable mech


An ordinary personal computer that
handles one person at one time is fine - if
you want to operate like a one-man band.
However, your
performance
suffers.
That’s why
we have developed ICL
multi-user microcomputer
systems.
ICL computers bring jj
people together by
letting them share
their information
whilst working
on a number of separate
functions at the same time.
For instance, the ICL Personal
Computer handles not one, but
four people at once, without
waiting or confusion.
And it doesn’t stop there.
As your business performs
better together, it will probably
grow. So ICL have a whole range of
microcomputer systems to take
you into the future - like the brand new MCL Clan’
that handles up to sixteen operators at once,
without loss of power.
ICL’s experience in mainframes has made us
Europe’s leading, and one of
Australia’s major, computer
companies. (We began
operating here
in 1921.) And
it’s that expertise
that ICL have brought
to the field of multi-user
micro-computers.

anically but not electrically. Printers
present particular difficulties. If they
had four wheels, they’d be as tricky as
second-hand cars. Printers must be
chosen very carefully to ensure they
work with the intended computers.
Even then, long and complex installa-
tion may be required.
When buying a printer, take your
computer with you and absolutely insist
on having it connected and set up there
and then.
There is an industry-common con-
nector (R 5232) but no general agree-
ment on which wires go where.
Interfacing computer equipment can
be like buying a record-player, finding
that it will only work with an amplifier
from the same manufacturer, will only
play records from one producer and
that you’ll need a degree in electro-
acoustics to connect the loudspeakers.
You’d better believe this printer
nightmares can come true.
THE PIC COMPUTER
WANG Computers will be remembered
this year for their admirable support of
Australian performing and other arts,
from the Australian Opera to the
Nimrod theatre and especially for
their arrangement to sponsor the
Courtald exhibition of Impressionist
paintings in the National Gallery in
Canberra. But Wang also will be re-
membered for introducing the PIC
computer.
The PIC computer machine allows
users to scan, store, edit and retrieve
and transmit images which may be
anything from photographs to hiero-
glyphics. It handles images much as a
word processor does with text and for
less than $30,000.
With the PIC, Wang are pioneering a
technology which will be used in-
creasingly as computer storage de-
creases in price which it does at ap-
proximately 40 percent a year.
There has been a major break-
through in storing data optically.
Toshiba in Japan, Storage Technology
and Shugart in the US and Philips in
Europe each have developed a generally
similar technique for scanning image in-
formation and storing it digitally on op-
tical disks. Each disk holds about 10,000
A 4 pages.
The hardware costs from $175,000
up but the disks are less than $2OO each.
Data stored on optical disks cannot
be edited yet but that very fact makes
the present technology an ideal medium
for archiving. Organisations such as
banks and insurance companies are
among the first users. □
A YARDSTICK, AT LAST,
FOR SALES CLAIMS
Michael McHugh, QC: appeared in a benchmark court case
SALES OF small business computer
systems in Australia this year should be
almost double those of 1983 an in-
crease from 25,000 to a probable 45,000.
These estimates are lower than some-
times claimed one distributor told us
last year that his company alone had
sold more than 65,000 systems in 1983!
Completely accurate figures are im-
possible to provide. Some vendors are
paranoid about revealing details.
Others’ claims are so romantic that they
would better be presented in iambic
pentameter.
This year, however, Apple Com-
puters fortuitously, if not intention-
ally provided a yardstick against
which to assess claims. It came about in
that company’s appeal against Justice
Beaumont’s ruling on software copy-
right when Michael McHugh, QC, told
the court there were 20,000 Apples in
Australia.
Bearing in mind the draconian pen-
alties for misinforming a court, we may
be confident that the figure was as close
as could be ascertained. As Apple’s
market share is fairly accurately known,
we have a rough method of assessing the
validity of others’ claims.
The estimates that follow are the av-
erage of those quoted by several inde-
pendent and authoritative sources and
accord with each company’s assessed
and claimed market share on the
“Apple Scale.”
The Bulletin believes these estimates
to be correct within 20 percent but no
greater accuracy than that is implied.
Factual corrections are welcome.
Apple is almost certainly the leader.
It has about 13 percent of the market
and is expected to sell some 7000 sys-
tems.
IBM probably will be close, with
sales (mainly of IBM PC variants)
around 6000. This figure does not neces-
sarily reflect local buyer demand, as de-
mand worldwide has been much greater
than IBM appears to have anticipated


with the result that adequate stock has
not been available. However, produc-
tion in the Boca Raton plant has been
increased and the Australian plant at
Wangaratta is in production so sales in
the latter part of the year will reflect de-
mand more closely.
Most industry observers expect IBM
to overtake Apple in this sector of the
market next year.
With less expensive systems, Apple is
expected to maintain a lead over IBM <
particularly with the flat-screen versions
of the Apple He. IBM’s PC Junior,
the United States at least, has not yeP
achieved the success of its larger rela-
tives. This may be caused in part by the
general dislike of its unconventional
and untactile plastic keyboard, soon to
be replaced.
Commodore and Tandy are believed
to be about level pegging, sharing some
15 percent of the market about 4000
units apiece. Both product lines may
suffer from a “hobby” image, although
Tandy is believed to have substantial
sales in the business and large or-
ganisational sectors.
DEC, NEC and Sirius probably have
4 to 5 percent each (about 2500 apiece)
with Hewlett-Packard just ahead at 5.5
to 6 percent and a bit under 3000 sales.
Wang a latecomer to this market
probably holds a shade under 4 percent,
with sales mainly to existing Wang
equipment owners.
The largest percentage gain in 1984
almost certainly has been by Hewlett-
Packard, Wang and Commodore next.
The nine companies mentioned so
far account for about two-thirds of the
reasonably assessable sales round
33,000 units. On top of this, a probable
The range of choice is wide: now we can do better estimates
13,000 sales are shared by IBM PC
lookalikes (claims for some of these are
wild and varied) and a smaller number
shared by the systems vendors (such as
ICL, Philips, NCR, Sperry, Rank
Xerox, TI, etc).
Surprisingly, considering their
strength in other technical markets and
general price competitiveness, Japanese
computer manufacturers with the ex-
ception of NEC have made only a
minor impact in this section of the mar-
ket. This may be due to a shortage of
software or, as appears is more likely
(and almost certain, in the case of
Hitachi), the Japanese use Australia as a
test market. A few clearly use it as a
dumping ground!
Australian manufacturers such as
Applied Technology, with their Micro-
bee range, are producing good small
systems on equally small budgets. As
other Australian sunrise industries have
discovered, local venture capital is thin
on the ground and most local hardware
manufacturers consequently are under-
capitalised.
Some major exceptions occur in the
THE SIDE EFFECkTS OF PIRACY
THE AMOUNT of software actually
pirated with a view to re-sale or casu-
ally copied is unknown, as is the loss
to the genuine industry.
The Yankee Group quotes legit-
imate worldwide sales as about $1
billion a year, with a further $2 to 3
billion worth pirated. The industry
sees the second amount as revenue
lost. But is it?
We are not for one moment justi-
fying illegal copying but it is reason-
able to ask if those who accepted a
“casual” copy or bought a $3O pirate
version would have paid $5OO-plus.
And to justify amounts still asked
for programs written years ago
and often only marginally improved
seems difficult from outside the
industry.
The price of software often is de-
fended on the grounds that develop-
ment costs are high.
Yankee Group senior analyst
Chris Christiansen told a Sydney
audience that it cost $3 to 4 million
in the Unites States to produce and
market a software package and
that much again to market it proper-
ly. This could well be so but while
Australian and European companies
use a few bright people to solve a
problem it is not unknown in the
USA to employ a hundred: not so
much to solve problems as to trample
them to death.
Zardax proves a point. One of the
world’s best word processing pro-
grams, it was written by one man
lan Phillips working in Brisbane.
Not all software companies
charge high prices. The US’s four-
year-old Software Publishing Cor-
poration’s range of PFS business
software sells for less than $l5O a
program, about one third of that
asked for competitive products. De-
spite this, the company is making ex-
ceptionally high profits and IBM is
selling its own versions under the
label IBM Assistant Series. □


Divorce isn’t easy
You're going to be with the next copier you buy for
quite a while. So getting hitched to an unreliable
copier can be a marriage of inconvenience.
Especially when your boss discovers the
frustration and disruption your unreliable new
plaything is causing.
Next time you buy a copier, take a look at
Panasonic first.
Because we realised that most copiers were
pretty much alike feature for feature, we drew on
the world's most advanced copier research
and manufacturing expertise to develop
copiers with ultimate reliability as their
primary feature.
The result is a range of Panasonic
copiers that do everything other copiers do, except
break down as often.
If you're tired of the frustration of the "Out
of Order" sign, you're ready for Panasonic. And a
copier marriage founded in heaven.

larger system field where companies
such as Hartley, Webster, et al have a
good share of the market.
LARGER SYSTEMS
THE BIGGEST growth market this
year will be in the upper end of the
small business systems area systems
from about $12,500 to $35,000. Here,
the increase is expected to be around 75
percent and the market $125 million.
The leader in this field, in terms of
installed systems, is probably North
Star with Archives, Cromemco,
Hartley, IMS, MAI, Onyx, Sirius, Uni-
son, Webster, Wicat and others sharing
the rest.
Next year probably will see a differ-
ent result. Prices in this area are falling
and the performance of smaller systems
is rising.
Many applications previously
needing plus-$ 15,000 systems may well
be met by the IBM PC-XT (hard disk)
and similar machines.
SOFTWARE
JUSTICE Beaumont’s decision, that
software is not subject to copyright, and
that decision’s over-ruling on appeal,
complicated the software market during
the early part of this year. But, despite
the probable setback, sales will rise to
an estimated $4O to 45 million from the
previous year’s figure of a bit under $2O
million.
Total world sales of business soft-
ware were about SUSSOO million last
year and sales this year will be at least
twice that. These were dominated by
Microsoft, Lotus, Digital Research,
Micro Pro and Ashton Tate probably
in that order.
The fortunes of previous industry
leader Visicorp (of Visicalc fame) are
sadly plummeting. This is partly due to
their now-dated product but primarily
to a massive feud between product de-
signer Daniel Bricklin and marketeer
Daniel Fylstra. Their separate compan-
ies are so thoroughly locked in legal
combat that development and selling
activity appears to have all but ceased.
In Australia, two companies
Imagineering and Computerland
share well over 40 percent of the mar-
ket. These organisations reveal their
sales figures. Regrettably, they are the
only two.
Wordstar continues to be the top-
selling package, with a probable 17,500
sales, but Lotus 1-2-3 is catching up fast.
The Australian-written Zardax word-
processing program is likely to sell 6000
to 7000 copies. □
HOW THE WORLD
(AND COSTS)
kEEP SHRINKING
Man on the Moon - and the world knew in a flash
FOR HIS SPONSOR Isabella of
Castile, Queen of Spain, to learn of
Christopher Columbus’ discovery of the
New World took six months. The speed
at which news travelled was little
improved four centuries later: 12 weeks
elapsed before the British government
learned of the assassination of Abraham
Lincoln. Yet, by 1965, Neil Armstrong’s
landing on the Moon was known
around the Earth 1.3 seconds after it
happened. And a substantial part of the
world’s population watched the Olym-
pics this year within a third of a second
of transmission from Los Angeles.
Instantaneous global communica-
tion, if not universally affordable or pol-
itically acceptable, is a technical reality.
Two factors have made this possible.
The first is integration of digital (com-
puter) technology with telecommuni-
cations engineering.
Telephones have worked for more
than 100 years by transmitting electrical
replicas of the original sound (ie, volt-
age rises and falls correspondingly to it)
and then using those replicas to recreate
the original sound waves at the receiv-
ing end.
Alexander Graham Bell would
understand a modern telephone im-
mediately.
Old though it is, the technique works
adequately. But, over long distances,
signals are progessively degraded de-
spite sophisticated technology to mini-
mise the losses. And, while the system is
just adequate for voice communica-
tions, it is inherently unsuitable for
transmitting large quantities of com-
puter data and totally unsuitable for
transmitting video. To cope with these
needs, hopefully for decades to come,

(Attached Resource Computer®), the
original local area network. Today ARC is
the most thoroughly proven local area
network in existence, bringing distributed
processing and desktop computing to
offices around the world.
The electronic ARC
that’s launching
office automation
Local area networks (LANs) provide the
ability to communicate between office
stations within a well defined office commun-
ity at typically high data rates. Datapoint,
building on their ARC (tm) local area network
technology, supply users with the vast array
of data communications products that are
necessary to provide connections into widely
distributed office and computing systems.
Innovation brings leadership
With well over a decade of highly innova-
tive product development, Datapoint has
earned an acknowledged leadership position
in the information processing industry.
The basis for much of this rapidly evolving
technology is the concept of dispersed data
processing. Introduced by Datapoint in the
early 1970’5, dispersed data processing repre-
sented an alternative to the prevailing notion
of computer power as something big, central-
ized, and expensive. The proliferation of de-
sktop computers in business attests to the
acceptance of this approach.
By the mid 1970’5, Datapoint designers
began to work on the next generation of
dispersed data processing technology. This
early research led to the development of a
unique method of linking small computers.
This system, called the ARC (Attached Re-
source Computer) local area network, embo-
died a new computer architecture that allowed
the power and resources of a business compu-
ter to be used in an entirely new way.
Acceptance in the marketplace was im-
mediate. Since 1977, Datapoint has installed
over 6000 ARC networks worldwide. Since
1981, a number of independent computer
companies have adopted the linking tech-
nology used by the ARC network as their
standard for local area networks. And now, in
1984, the same ARC networking capability
that evolved from Datapoint’s expertise in dis-
persed data processing is serving as the
foundation of office automation.
The ARC network today
The ARC network provides a means of
interconnecting individual Datapoint com-
puters, terminals, disk storage devices, prin-
ters and other peripherals. These devices
typically are located throughout an office or
building, with coaxial or fibre optic cable
serving as the physical link. Over this cable
the computers transfer information and share
the peripheral resources of the network. The
ADVERTISEMENT


computers and terminals can be used to per-
form data processing, word processing, elec-
tronic message services, financial modelling,
data communications, and printing.
The ability to transfer information among
computers is one of the key strengths of the
ARC local network. The computers can send
and receive electronic messages, can ex-
change files, can assess the same data, and
can combine certain types of information
contained in different programs. This type of
information exchange would be impossible
without integration of the software.
The dispersed architecture of the ARC
network has additional inherent advantages
over traditional computer systems. One con-
siderable economic benefit is the ease with
which the network can grow. When a business
decides to increase computer power, the ARC
network can expand modularly. The new com-
puter is'simply placed where it’s needed and
then attached to the network with coaxial
cable. A user can even start with a standalone
computer system and grow into an ARC net-
work by the same process. This type of system
growth can be accommodated indefinitely as
new computers are added one at a time or in
groups.
The dispersed architecture of the ARC
network also provides a high degree of relia-
bility. The network cannot be disrupted by the
malfunction of one component. If one ele-
ment fails, the network as a whole continues
to function. Computers and other devices can
be added, disconnected, or serviced without
interrupting network operation.
Automating the office
Much of the labour force is engaged in
some form of office work. That labour force
needs more than paper and pencil. Office
automation seeks to equip these workers with
the most productive tools available, typically
in the form of desktop computers that support
managerial and clerical tasks.
Communications are the backbone of the
automated office. Datapoint discovered very
early in the marketing of the ARC network
that there was a need to deliver more than data
processing capability with the network.
Once the computer power was dispersed,
the next logical step was to increase the
number of tasks that each computer could
perform. This diversification within a sys-
tem’s framework was Datapoint’s entry into
the field of office automation.
Datapoint provided the methods necessary
to move information from workstation to
workstation on a local network or from
network to network in a distributed office
environment. Datapoint protocols allow
information transfer between Datapoint
systems and mainframe computers. It is this
broad range of communications compatibility
that has made Datapoint the industry leader in
networking. □

SOIW bKI SVIM I


Australia’s first communications satellite is to be launched next July, to 36,000 km up
system is being converted to digital op-
eration.
Eventually, all signals speech, mu-
sic, text, video, as well as computer data
- will be turned into and handled in the
form of the sequences of electrical
pulses which computers understand.
Each sequence of pulses represents a
number, a character or a segment of a
picture or a sound. Accents and inflec-
tions, as well as the most intricate musi-
cal or visual detail, are all faithfully
transmitted digitally.
These sequences of digital pulses can
be regenerated as often as required
without loss of quality: neither distor-
tion nor noise is multiplied as it is with
the earlier technology. So long as the
original sequence is transmitted and
received correctly, the original form will
be re-created without the slightest loss
of intelligence or identity and, for all
practicable purposes, regardless of dis-
tance; it works as far as Jupiter at least!
Digital technology has the further
and unique characteristic that the basic
principles are unlikely to become obsol-
ete for centuries. The technique breaks
down all information, data, image,
sound and text, to the lowest common
denominator single digital bits.
Telephone engineers have long
realised the overwhelming advantages
of changing to digital technology but
only in the past few years has the fall in
costs of the required technology made
this financially possible.
Communications engineering is pre-
dicated on transistor and associated
technology and the cost of this has
dropped steadily for the past 15 to 20
years and dramatically over the past
four or five.
The amount of processing power that
can be placed on a single chip doubles
each year. About 10 transistors could be
placed on a single chip about half a
centimetre square in the early 19605.
Were the same component density to be
used today, many recent VLSI (Very
Large Scale Integration) chips would be
the size of a city of about 100 square
kilometres having a population of some
300,000 and with about 8000 km of
roads.
The cost of satellite communications,
too, is falling rapidly. In 1965, when the
first communications satellite was
launched, the cost per channel was
about $U523,000. This fell to SUS6OO a
channel six years later and to $6O a
channel a year or two ago. The price is
still falling and the number of channels
per satellite still rising.
Earthbound communication also has
become cheaper. Costs decrease by 11
percent a year and have done so since
1965. The number of telephones has in-
creased by about 7 percent a year, from
49 million in 1945 to 565 million in
1983.
Australia has some 5.8 million of
those phones, including half-a-million
added in the past 12 months.
Suddenly, then, the technology has
become affordable and we have for the
first time the ability to interchange im-
mense quantities of numerical, textual,
visual and aural information across our
planet (and beyond) at almost the speed
of light. And without distance causing a
loss of quality.
Nor does distance affect the cost of a
call going via a satellite path with
such links, all calls travel the same dis-
tance: about 72,000 km.
Whether users will pay less for long-
distance calls remains to be seen for,
despite the falling costs, changing to
digital technology is staggeringly ex-
pensive.
For this year alone, “the cost is
SUSS9 billion,” says Ed Grabhorne,
managing director of Arthur D. Little’s
world telecommunications information
program. “This will increase to nearly
SUSB9 billion each year by 1988.”
Already, says the United Nations’
International Telecommunications
Union, “the USA, France and Japan’s
investment in plant and equipment rep-
resents 9 percent of their total gross
domestic product.” Expenditure by
users for telephone calls, telex and other
services “is three to four times that
amount,” estimates Grabhorne. That
revenue is derived mainly from a small
number of large customers.
The United States’ Southwestern Bell
Corporation says that 60 percent of its
revenue comes from the top 8 percent of
its customers. And in Australia, accord-
ing to communications consultant
Trevor Housley, “about 100 companies
spend over a million dollars each.”
Economic development and tele-
phone density seem to share an orderly
relationship. The growth of telecom-
munications exceeds the gross domestic
product in virtually every fast-growing
or developed economy in many
countries (such as South Korea) by a
factor approaching two. The slower in-
crease in less-developed countries is
partly due to the costs of establishing
terrestrial networks in rural areas. How-
ever, the rapidly increasing use of satel-
lite links will reduce the cost of com-
munications in such lagging countries
and with no existing massive investment
in an older system they are more likely
to choose the latest techniques. Saudi
Arabia, for example, has one of the
most advanced telecommunications sys-
tems in the world with satellite earth
stations at Riyadh, Taif and Jeddah.
Globally, the opportunities for the
telecommunications industries are im-
mense. Ninety percent of all those tele-
phones in the world are owned by a
mere 15 percent of the nations. The US


No more expensive and time consuming
tape transfers. If you are receiving tapes
from overseas which have been recorded
on the PAL NTSC or SECAM system you
need the JVC Multiple System
VHS Video Recorder.
Multi-System Playback. The multi-system circuitry of this technologically
advanced JVC Video cassette recorder allows you, in conjunction with a
compatible monitor, to playback any type of VHS cassette, be it PAL NTSC
or SECAM. An automatic detection system identifies the standard to which
a tape was recorded in Britain, Europe, Asia or America and plays it back
through the correct circuit.
Multi-System Recording. The multi-system circuitry is also capable of
recording SECAM NTSC or PAL.
Special Effects Playback. The JVC Multiple System Recorder also
provides a high speed shuttle search in either direction to visually locate,
quickly and accurately any part of the tape.
Playback may be accelerated up to twice normal speed, or slowed down to
anywhere between 1/5 and 1/25 normal speed. Additionally, for a more
detailed inspection, the action can be frozen completely and then advanced
frame by frame.
Full Function Remote Control. The convenient and compact
cordless remote unit controls all functions including shuttle search,
channel selection and all special effects.
Additional features are: Full logic tape transfer control, Motorised front

Canada; Fujitsu and NEC in Japan;
and CIT-Alcatel, Ericsson, GEC,
Philips, Plessey, Siemens and Thomson

Monitoring in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: one of the world’s most advanced systems
In Australia (as elsewhere), business,
more than the domestic sector, will gain
the initial benefits of the digital trans-
formation particularly following the
launching next July of the first of Aus-
tralia’s communications satellites.
The satellite is to be positioned
36,000 km above the equator, just to the
east of Australia, and rotate there, with
the same angular velocity as the Earth
(as if affixed to the top of an Earth-
based tower 36,000 km tall) receiving
and re-transmitting signals throughout
Australia and beyond.
The space equipment and associated
ground control facilities will be owned
by Aussat.
This is a limited liability private
company with a share capital of $lOO
million of which $49.5 million has been
paid up by the Australian government.
Telecom has a 25 percent shareholding.
A major proportion of the cost will
go to Hughes Aircraft, the USA’s third-
largest and least-known private corn-
pany whose founder was recluse How-
ard Hughes.
Hughes Aircraft has an excellent re-
cord in producing satellites for AT&T,
Satellite Business Systems, Western
Union and Intelsat as well for the US
defence forces.
Thirty percent of the spacecraft and
ground control equipment is to be made
here. Contracts total almost $5O million.
Each of the 12 Mitsubishi major
earth stations has 50 percent local con-
tent (worth about $l6 million) and
AWA and STC share a $5.4 million con-
tract for supplying wiring harnesses.
The Melbourne and Hobart earth
stations are being built by Hansen and
Yuncken and those in Canberra and
Adelaide by Civil and Civic who also
are constructing the two main control
centres in Sydney (at Belrose) and Perth
(Lockridge).
Total cost of the ground stations,
says Aussat’s Graham Gosewinckel
“including buildings, satellite antennas
and communications equipment is
between $25 and 30 million.”
Once the main structure is complete
and the satellite in position, the system
becomes inherently flexible.
All that is required is to install and
align appropriately-sized earth stations
and associated equipment. The cost of
transmission is essentially independent
on distance, so a satellite link and small
earth station can service isolated areas
where the cost of a terrestrial link would
be prohibitive. If that service were no
longer required, the station could be put
on the back of a truck and moved.
TELECOM’S Iterra Network Service,
planned to be operational from January
1986, will be one of the satellite’s first
large-scale users. This service will use it
to interconnect isolated and other users
of telephone, data and text services to
existing and future Telecom services.
The network will complement and ex-
tend Telecom’s existing terrestrial voice
and data systems. It will enable for
the first time total practical, economic
and full-service coverage for our re-
mote, sparsely populated and off-shore
areas. In addition, it will provide dom-
estic telecommunications within Papua
New Guinea.
Individual earth stations, with up to
14 channels, will be located throughout
Australia (or off-shore) wherever traffic
needs dictate. These stations may be
used for telephones, small business
systems, PABXs (Private Automatic
Branch Xchanges) or for local tele-
phone exchanges.
A main earth station, at Bendigo
(Victoria), will interface all Telecom-
carried communications to and from
the satellite with the terrestrial network.
Mining companies will be among the
first Iterra users.
Mining exploration has become so
complex that access to large mainframe
computers is essential. An urgent re-
quirement also exists for rapid and reli-
able communications in the event of an
accident or equipment failure.
A portable two-channel earth station
(costing about $5000) will enable survey
teams to transmit field data directly to
and from office computers for analysis
and evaluation.
If an area appears commercially vi-
able, that earth station can be expanded
to provide local-area facilities for the
company and for subcontractors em-
ployed during subsequent construction
stages.
“Outback” and other remote tourist
developments will avail themselves of
Iterra’s potential, as will isolated pas-
toral stations.
All Telecom services telex, fac-
simile, STD and ISTD telephone calls,
call diversion, etc will be accessible
through the Iterra network from any
part of Australia and beyond, no matter
how remote.
Telecom will not have a monopoly
on satellite communications.
Business and other users may own
and operate earth stations but only for
their own use third party traffic will
be forbidden.

manager of NEC Satellites, told The
Bulletin that, “for hardware, a news-

Reuters would need to spend about
$5OOO plus the cost of installation. Basic
voice and data services start around
$30,000.”
Aussat will be leasing television,
radio program, telephone and data links
using the organisation’s earth stations in
each of Australia’s state capital cities
and also in Canberra and Darwin.
Rates start at $667 a month for a single
two-way voice channel and at $833 for a
(9.6 k/bit/s) data channel.
While the satellite and its associated
services provide news headlines, a huge
quantity of equally important but less
glamorous equipment is being installed
or planned for use with digital teleph-
ony and other services.
This year alone, 43 new digital tele-
phone exchanges (using Ericsson AXE
switching systems) are being installed at
various sites in Australia. A further 30
transit switching centres are being in-
stalled as the first part of the plan to
convert the entire national network to
digital operation. The cost will be about
$lB million. AWA will take $l6 million,
with GEC Australia and L.M. Ericsson
sharing the rest.
Telecom’s radio links, too, will be-
come digital. One from Melbourne to
Sydney is to be completed soon and
links between the other capitals are
scheduled for completion by late next
year. Further links, two to three years
from now, will extend the service to
many major towns.
The technology used in terrestrial
links also is changing.
Bundles of extremely clear glass
fibres enable light beams to carry mas-
sive quantities of data over long dis-
tances. Light, of a single specific wave-
length, travels in a series of zig-zags
along the fine glass thread by innumer-
able and almost total internal reflec-
tions.
Just one fibre about a tenth of a milli-
metre in diameter (the width of a human
hair) can carry thousands of messages at
the speed of light. Hewlett-Packard says
that a fibre can transmit the equivalent
of about 70 complete versions of the
King James Bible (or one-and-a-half
encylopaedias) each second.
Apart from its speed and informa-
tion-carrying capacity, fibre optic trans-
mission is largely immune to electrical
or other forms of interference. In par-
ticular, it is not affected by the electro-
magnetic pulse which accompanies nu-
clear explosion and wipes out most con-
ventional electrical and radio trans-
mission. What value the data would be
with no one left to heed it is a question
not yet answered.
Recent improvements (if three or-
ders of magnitude can be termed an
“improvement”!) in the optical clarity
of silicate glass have enabled this tech-
nology to become a practicable reality.
Most fibre optical material used in Aus-
tralia (by Telecom) was produced in
Japan or contained Japanese-made
fibres but AWA produces a wholly Aus-
tralian-made fibre which, the company
says, equals anything from overseas.
One hundred and sixty kilometres of
this material have been supplied to Aus-
tral Standard Cables to fabricate into a
cable for use in the tail end of a Telecom
radio link between its microwave
station at Waverley in Sydney’s eastern
suburbs and the main city exchange 7
km away.
All major terrestrial trunk lines are
expected to use optical fibres in the very
near future. Dr Donald Nicol, head of
AWA’s physical laboratory, says that
the fibres will have extensive use
“they are cheap to install and have a
transmission capacity much superior to
wire cables.” This has been shown in
Saskatchewan, Canada, where a 3200
km network provides voice, data, fac-
simile, video and cable TV to a large
and widespread community.
Recent developments in fibre optic
technology particularly using several
light beams each of a discrete wave-
length in a single fibre may multiply
the already-huge information-carrying
capacity of this medium.
While most of the terrestrial part of
the world’s telecommunications net-
work is technologically obsolete, its
sheer size and the enormous invest-
ments therein mean that the change to
totally digital operation must be grad-
ual. In the US, for example, current in-
vestment in the existing public switch-
ing network is approaching SUSIOO bil-
lion. Nevertheless, most new develop-
ment uses digital techniques and the
network and equipment which follows
become increasingly cost-effective as
each piece is added. This is particularly
apparent with the new generation of
PABXs.
All but the smallest of offices has a
switchboard and a PABX is basically a
large switchboard with the ability to let
people originate and receive telephone
calls without operator assistance.
A technique called Stored Program
Control, introduced a few years ago, ex-
tended the PABX’s facilities to include
abbreviated dialling, last number re-di-
alling, the ability automatically to re-
route calls from one extension to an-
other and similar useful or amusing
facilities.
Now there’s the digital PABX. These
systems differ from their predecessors in
that they switch voice traffic as does a
computer by converting it to bits and
bytes. Eventually, they will able to
switch all data directly onto Telecom’s
all-digital networks but that’s at least six
years away probably longer. (The US
expects to have 90 percent of all local
and metropolitan lines digital by 1990
and roughly the same percentage of ex-
changes.)
Another useful characteristic of digi-
tal PABXs is that they may be used in
master/slave configurations to intercon-
nect premises which may be hundreds
and more of kilometres apart by leased
digital lines (or future satellite link). In
such configurations, the PABXs work as
if they were one large system.
The digital PABX is more than a
computer: The unit and its associated
cabling within a building is inherently
capable of interconnecting and switch-
ing traffic between all manner of busi-
ness computing equipment data ter-
minals, word processors, printers, fac-
simile machines, etc. That ability, which

the industry calls “local area network-
ing,” is what many experts believe will
determine the future of business com-
puting. Networking is essential but it
must be simple to use and it must be
cheap. The digital PABX (and all
PABXs ultimately must be digital) offers
just these characteristics and offers
them now. It also has the massive ad-
vantage, for computer switching, of not
being remotely concerned about the for-
mat of the data flowing through it. To
use the latest industry buzz-phrase, it’s
“transparent.” This means that virtually
any computer equipment can communi-
cate through it.
The sending and the receiving bits
must be able to “understand” each other
but compatibility of the switch need not
be a consideration. A digital PABX also
has ample and unused computer ca-
pacity to undertake this work and more.
Honeywell Information Systems’
Rex Lehmann cautions and advises
that, “because all switching of data and
voice is through one ‘box,’ the entire op-
eration of the network is dependent
upon the integrity of that one unit
some manufacturers have reduced this
weakness by sub-dividing the primary
PABX into several distinct sections;
however, the principle remains.”
NEC’s NEAX 2400 IMS (Informa-
tion Management System) is typical of
the latest digital PABXs. Apart from the
basic switchboard functions, this device
has user-selectable modules which pro-
vide data communications, electronic
mail, teleconferencing, facsimile trans-
mission and voice mail.
Voice mail is exceptionally useful for
large organisations; it provides auto-
matic delivery of recorded messages, in-
cluding sending the same one simul-
taneously to any number of people.
Facsimile mail enables organisations
to store information and arrange for it
to be forwarded when and where
required. This eliminates problems
caused by differences between time
zones and can arrange for information
to be sent at off-peak periods.
As with other digital PABXs, the
NEAX performs many of the functions
which telephone exchanges did: calls
may be switched, records kept of calls,
callers billed.
Telecom Australia has spent $2.5
million on NEAX 2400 s for resale to
Telecom customers. The first was in-
stalled recently at Victoria’s Gas and
Fuel Corporation.
Other contenders for shares of the
Australian PABX market include L.M.
Ericsson, Plessey, Philips, Siemens and
STC.
Selling PABXs in differing countries
involves far more than marketing, how-
ever. Technical requirements vary, as
Plessey (UK) discovered when it first
looked at the US market.
American PABX users require their
equipment to select and route all long-
distance calls automatically by the
cheapest of the range of alternative car-
riers. But Plessey’s PABX did not have
this facility because Britain and other
European countries do not have compe-
ting carriers.
Huge sums are going into designing
PABXs and modifying them for other
markets. Developing ITT’s System 12
cost that organisation more than $750
million.
But the market is equally large rev-
enue from selling PABXs in 1983 was
SUSI 2 billion, according to the Organ-
isation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
Philips Industries’ Integrated Busi-
ness Communications System typifies
what is available (and legally may be
used) right now. This system, shown at
the latest Australian Telecommuni-
cations Users’ Group exhibition in Mel-
bourne, handles up to 520 outlets in-
terconnecting word processors, small
computers, facsimile machines, etc. It
also has a facility for central dictation.


Can you be ruth
and a loving paren
There are many ways for you to be
more competitive in the way that you
go about your business. (The faint-hearted
would call some of these ploys ruthless.)
But there is one way that allows you
to improve your business efficiency, and give
your kids a head start at the same time.
It’s the new Apple lie.
Apple lie. The 8 pound heavyweight.
For such a powerful, capable machine,
the Apple lie is extremely compact.
The new Apple weighs just less than 8
pounds, half as much as computers with half
its power. It has been designed to be the same
size as a 3-ring binder, not a 3-ring circus.
It has over 10,000 software programs
written for it. With educational programs
that graduate from Spelling to Acid-Based
Chemistry.
And with business programs that range
from Inventory Control to Sales Analysis.
Apple lie. The perfect business partner.
When you take your Apple to work,
you’ll find there’s an Apple program to help
you keep records, manage finances and
prepare, file and retrieve documents. There
are many Apple programs written for spec-
ific use by people such as farmers, doctors,
lawyers and accountants.
With an Apple printer you can easily
turn screeds of information into graphs and
charts in seconds, not in hours.
Should your office possess a mainframe
computer, your Apple can connect into it.
Whether you’re working directly with
a mainframe program or transferring wads
of information onto a program disk for your
later use, you will soon see that having an
Apple lie on your desk is a lot smarter than
having a dumb terminal.
In no time, your nights and weekends
of being office bound, simply because the
computer’s there, are over.
Apple lie. The perfect teacher.
When you take the Apple home
you’ll realise that a perfect, patient inspiring
teacher is never far from hand.
After plugging the Apple into a normal
television or an optional monitor, the first of
6 self-explanatory programs can be inserted
into the built-in disk drive.
Young and old will very quickly realise
how simple Apple has made it to master the
personal computer.
And in no time at all, young people
will find themselves at the door of one of
the most unusual libraries ever assembled,
the Apple software library.
Even though there are new programs
written for the Apple every day, there are
currently over 2000 education based prog-
rams available.
At their own pace, with the new found

concentration that a computer creates, your
children can take themselves on a private
tuition course that covers virtually every
subject on the school curriculum.
Whether they’re learning to read
music or a foreign language, your children
will be enjoying the considerable advantages
of a student to teacher ratio of 1 to 1.
Whatever the subject however, many
people believe that familiarity alone with a
computer is going to be a tremendous
advantage in the future of a young person
growing up today.
Who knows, an Apple may give your
kids such a head start, they may never even
have to be ruthless in business.

THE DIGITAL PABX could solve one
of the computer industry’s biggest prob-
lems: how to place terminals on execu-
tives’ desks without their egos being
threatened. The size of this problem can
be gauged by how few computer mar-
keting executives use personal com-
puters even those they try to sell their
peers.
However, the communications in-
dustry is well aware that sitting on every
executive’s desk is at least one tele-
phone.
“Everyone talks about putting com-
puters on executives’ desktops,” says
James Day, AT&T’s director of systems
engineering and networking, “but
what’s already there? Telephones!” So
why not, says the $58.2 billion-turnover
AT&T, forget desktop computers as
such just make the telephone pro-
gressively more clever? And that’s what
AT&T and many other companies in
the telecommunications industry are
preparing to make smart telephones
with display terminals and simple com-
puting facilities.
It has also occurred to the more
aware companies in the computer in-
dustry that, if a telephone company can

design and build something as complex
as a digital PABX, making smart tele-
phones would be a breeze.
Many computer companies are
rethinking their position. “Communica-
tions and information processing are
becoming increasingly integrated,” said
John Opel, chairman of IBM which re-
cently bought a SUS22B million (19 per-
cent shareholding in gigantic telecom-
munications manufacturer the Rolm
Corporation.
Philips has a joint venture with
AT&T (AT&T & Philips Telecommuni-
cations) which is trying to sell switching
equipment to telephone companies in
Africa, Europe, Latin America and the
Middle East.
Hewlett-Packard is talking hard with
[Canada’s Northern Telecom as are
'DEC, Data General, Sperry, Wang, et
al. Wang recently acquired part of In-
tecom, another fast-growing PABX
manufacturer.
Combination telephone/computer
workstations will be in use soon and will
allow voice and data operation simul-
taneously.
Mel Ward, general manager of
Telecom’s commercial services division,
says that “new generation PABXs inte-
grate voice and data facilities allowing,
for instance, a facsimile or video picture
to be interposed in a business dis-
cussion.”
Northern Telecom’s range of “Dis-
play Phones” blurs the distinction be-
tween telephones and computer termin-
als. Data and text can be called up
(from memory), displayed while the
user is talking and transmitted instantly
to the terminal at the recipient’s end.

meric keypad (not an entirely satisfac-
tory arrangement, as a numeric keypad
has a totally different key layout from a
touch ’phone). The device will operate
with digital PABXs from Northern
Telecom, Rolm and AT&T and is
simply plugged into the local telephone
connection.
Hugh Daniels, Sperry’s Australian
and New Zealand product manager for
communications and terminals, told
The Bulletin that this unit would be
ready to market in Australia by the end
of this year.
David Starr, network marketing
manager for ICL, told us that undoubt-
edly there would be “voice and data
from one machine on an executive’s
desk and this machine will plug into the
telephone socket.” But Starr sees a need
for two separate network systems in
many organisations. He agrees with the
concept of “clever telephones” for
executives but believes that other staff
may need computers and networks
capable of handling more data more
quickly than can a PABX and its as-
sociated cabling. He points out that
digital PABXs may be more than
capable of handling the great majority
of inter-organisational computer traffic
but they do have a maximum data hand-
ling speed of 64 kilobaud (the equiva-
lent of about 1500 words a second).
Northern Telecom and, no doubt,
others will have equipment operating at
twice this speed very soon but even that
will not be fast enough for “number
crunching” or most video transmission
and that a second form of data-carrying
network hence will be required.
And there’s the rub. There are more
than 50 competing systems (called local
area networks or LANs) for in-
terconnecting computer equipment.
Few are compatible one with another.
To compound the problem, each manu-
facturer’s equipment has its own “pro-
tocol” a set of rules which governs its
operation. Equipment from different
manufacturers can rarely be linked
together to interchange or share infor-
mation due to such protocols they
effectively speak different languages.
The incompatibility often is deliber-
ate. Each manufacturer would like to
each buy into its range and making
equipment non-compatible is a way of
doing that. ’’Helping customers make
the correct buying decision” is the in-
dustry doublespeak for the practice.
Buying all system components from
one source makes a lot of sense for
small non-technical companies but, as
Philips Industries points out, “no big or-
ganisation can possibly stick with just
This cartoon and the one of page 102 are

one manufacturer. No manufacturer
makes the best possible piece of equip-
ment for each and every task, so big or-
ganisations use equipment from several
suppliers. As a result, a large organisa-
tion’s expensive information handling
equipment all those mainframes,
data-bases, word processors, teleprin-
ters more or less work in isolation.”
Philips’ recently introduced Sopho-
Net provides an answer for large com-
panies faced with this problem those
who need to interconnect, for example,
large-scale IBM and DEC based sys-
tems.
Sopho-Net theoretically can connect
any devices, via any transmission me-
dium, to any other devices. Un-
fortunately, the system admirable
though it is is only practicable for big
organisations. Interconnecting several
sites and two different mainframe com-
puters costs $1 to 2 million.
The LANs most commonly used
are Datapoint’s Arcnet and Xerox’s
Ethernet. They are not strictly competi-
tive. The former is cheaper but slower.
The Australian and New Zealand
wool-buying industry is one of the
major users of Arcnet. A local company
Talman Ltd recently completed in-
stallation of a system, using Datapoint
computer equipment, linking more than
25 companies representing 75 percent of
the buyers and sellers of Australia’s clip.
The Talman system is exceptionally
interesting in that regulations oblige in-
voices to be produced and in the buyer’s
hands within 24 hours of a sale. The
Talman system enables this to be done
within eight hours even though, say, a
wool sale in Goulburn (NSW) may be
attended by five brokers whose offices
are in different cities of Australia and
whose clients could be in other areas.
Each lot sold requires five records to
be sent from buyer to seller, creating
about two million records to be handled
by the network each year. Talman’s
George Waldthausen says that the sys-
tem charges are about 16 cents for each
lot sold (a lot being worth $4OO to
$50,000).
Ethernet’s most famous local client is
the Australian Security and Intelligence
Organisation. It has been evaluating a
system at its Melbourne headquarters
and is installing a $1 million version in
time for its transfer to new headquarters
in Canberra in January 1986.
The federal Department of Adminis-
trative Services also is installing
Ethernet systems to link a multiplicity
of devices including Xerox laser
printers over five buildings in Canberra.
This system will be the largest Ethernet
installation outside the USA.

There's only one courier who can beat
the Voca-Dex 5200 facsimile system. He wears
a skin tight blue suit and is, unfortunately, only a
comic strip hero. Fortunately, there is a system
that's even better.
The Voca-Dex 3200 facsimile system will
deliver your important documents anywhere in the
world, in just 60 seconds per A 4 page. Which is much
faster than the fastest speeding bullet But the impact of
such swift and sure delivery is even greater. Written,
signed agreements and instructions arriving within
minutes of an important decision, means greater
competitiveness,faster results. For many kinds of business
and industry. Overseas financial agreements, vital board
documents, monthly accounts, computer printout and
personal data complete with photograph, can be sent around
the world, interstate or across town. In less time than it takes to
address an envelope, insert the document and call a courier. And
it all happens in total security and with delivery certain.
The Voca-Dex 3200 system even gives you a receipt to prove
your document arrived. It can even interface with a computer and
function as a printer.
There are many ways the Voca-Dex 3200 system can be adapted
to your business. The 3200 creates more time for you and maybe even
makes you more money. However, you really need to
see it in action, in your office, to fully appreciate what
it can do for you. Consequently, we make this
irresistable offer.
The Voca 7-Day Free Supertrial:
We will give you a Voca-Dex 3200 for 7 days.
Free. Absolutely no cost But we're confident
you'll keep it, once you see what it can do for
you. Another big advantage of the Voca-Dex
3200 is that it’s half the size of comparable
machines. And half the price. And it's twice
as good. Take the 7-Day Supertrial and
find out why.
Then, for urgent documents, the Post

Unfortunately, while Arcnet and
Ethernet are excellent LANs for large-
scale users, neither is of much help to a
small-business user who wants only to
interface two Apple lls, an IBM PC and
a daisywheel printer without spending
an arm and a leg.
In this area, most of the small com-
puter industry is waiting to see what
IBM intends to do, for that company
has announced its intention to imple-
ment within three years a local area net-
work for use with various combinations
of small business equipment.
To avoid redundancy in buildings
under construction, IBM recently re-
leased details of the future system and
the cabling required.
IBM’s system will use ordinary two-
pair twisted wire (costing a couple of
dollars or so a metre) and simple ($4.50)
outlet sockets to connect groups of up to
64 devices in a “ring” configuration. A
special electrical signal called a “token”
travels continually at very high speed
around the ring. If a user commands a
desktop computer, for example, to
transmit information to another device,
the computer “captures” the token sig-
nal which then functions like a mail
truck. The computer inserts the data,
along with the address of the receiving
device, into the token which then con-
tinues to move around the ring until it
reaches a receiving device. The token
delivers the information to this device
and continues to circulate, seeking fur-
ther “drops.”
In the US, 10 IBM buildings have
been wired for this system and have it
up and running. The system is being in-
stalled in IBM’s new headquarters at
West Pennant Hills in Sydney. □

DATA-BASES:
STILL TAXING
BUT MORE HELPFUL
DATA-BASES are simply ordered col-
lections of recorded knowledge and
have existed since people first sought to
record and retrieve information. The
early Chinese and Romans maintained
data-bases censuses of nativity, age,
sex and possessions to aid collecting
taxes. The information was recorded on
scrolls in a manner which was highly
structured it could be practicably ac-
cessed only in the original order of in-
dexing.
The Romans could not readily estab-
lish how many Egyptians aged 30 to 40
owned more than 10 sheep let alone
who they were any more than we can
tell by checking the directory who has a
particular telephone number.
America’s census of 1890 required
the ability to sort the data in a variety of
ways. Dr Herman Hollerith’s punched
card machine provided the answer.
The machine used holes, punched
selectively in 288 locations, to represent
specifics. An electrically-operated mech-
anism enabled the cards to be sorted in
any order of hole patterns and, hence,
data.
Electronic data-bases are com-
puterised versions of Hollerith’s system,
enabling information to be stored and
accessed selectively and massively
faster.
Their essential characteristic is the
ability to select data which meets any
criterion required: list all references that
include China and bicycles or all people
earning less than $25,000 who bought
Mercedes cars last year.
Even in its infancy, data-base tech-
nology is an extremely powerful tool for
it multiplies that which both computers
and humans are best at doing. American
economist Leo Cherne foresaw this
years ago: “The computer is extremely
fast, accurate and stupid. Man is incred-
ibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant. The
marriage of the two is a force beyond
calculation.”
Electronic data-bases take a myriad
of forms and have myriad applications.
Simple data-base programs running
on personal computers enable people to
Herman Hollerith’s tabulating machine,
used in America’s 1890 census
categorise their income and expendi-
ture; slightly more complex versions,
such as dßase 11, are ideal for maintain-
ing club membership lists (that program
can handle more than 65,000 records
with 32 separate categorisable items
each).
Major retailers are beginning to de-
tail stock and prices on data-bases ac-
cessible by customers who, in turn, or-
der goods through home computer ter-
minals.
Knight-Ridder’s Viewtron system
has 100 southern Florida shops and
travel agents offering this service in the
US. Dick Smith Electronics did so in
Australia more than four years ago.
Large organisations maintain data-
bases for storing corporate data, access-
ible via data terminals, to those author-
ised to use it.
Mail order companies maintain lists
of all customers who have bought
goods. A record will be kept for each
customer, detailing under separate

Data-base technology may be used
on a grander scale. The increase in re-
corded human knowledge is unpre-
cedented and telecommunications en-
able us to transmit it anywhere on Earth
(and beyond) at speeds approaching
that of light. However, the sheer amount
of knowledge has become so vast that
many professionals cannot even keep
up with the abstracts in small parts of
their disciplines. Data-base technology
can assist by establishing what informa-
tion exists about specific matters or
events or combinations thereof: It’s an
electronic extension of what Boswell
had in mind when he wrote that
“Knowledge is of two kinds; we know a
subject ourselves or we know where we
can find information on it.”
Whereas data-bases are essentially
stores of information, the ways of ac-
cessing that information vary.
VIDEOTEX
VIDEOTEX enables subscribers to dial
up a central data-base computer and
specify, by keyboard, what information
or service they require and have that
sent via the telephone to their display
terminals or modified television re-
ceivers. The services also can be ac-
cessed through a few personal com-
puters.
Videotex, the generic term for a
number of similar services, should not
be confused with teletext a service
which on first acquaintance seems simi-
lar and has been operational in Austra-
lia (Seventext) for years.
Just to confuse things further, an-
other service called Teletex (no final‘t’)
is a modern version of the older telex
service.
Teletext is a simpler system in which
information is sent via normally unused
lines of a TV signal to suitably adapted
receivers. Teletext is not interactive. The
user cannot directly influence what data
is available choices are limited to the
currently transmitted material, usually a
maximum of 500 “pages.”
The essential difference between
videotex and teletext is that the former
is “interactive” the user not only can
draw information from a huge range of
material held in gigantic computers but
also can send instructions back, using a
keyboard.
Videotex is a complementary con-
cept: it requires on the one hand com-
panies and organisations (such as air-
lines) which need things known or can
sell information about products, ser-
vices or activities and on the other hand
people who need that information.
Information is shown both textually
and graphically but, with current sys-
tems, the definition varies from poor to
acceptable. No videotex system yet
offers graphics which equal a normal
TV picture.
Videotex was launched in London in
1979, as Prestel. It took off like a con-
crete 747, at best attracting 10 percent of
the hoped-for subscribers. Prestel since
has found limited favor with the busi-
ness community. About 90 percent of its
users are businesses including agricul-
ture, finance, insurance and the motor
industries.
Public videotex services are in use in
West Germany (Bildschirmtext); Hol-
land (Viditel); Finland (Telset); France
(Teletel); Canada (Telidon); Japan
(Captain); Italy (Videotel); and South
Africa (Beltel).
One of the more dramatic uses of
videotex is in France where Annuaire
Electronique provides continually up-
dated electronic telephone directories.
These eventually will replace standard
books.
Australia was all set to have videotex
three years ago but Telecom’s arrange-
ments were torpedoed at the last mo-
ment by the Fraser government.
The federal Labor government since
has authorised Telecom to re-institute
the service to be called Viatel late
this year.
Viatel is to use a developed version
of Prestel, adopted as a standard by
more than 26 countries.
This decision has met with the disap-
proval of organisations with vested in-
terests in the French and Canadian sys-
tems which are claimed to offer technic-
ally superior graphical performance.
However, Telecom believes that the
advantages of having a “standard”
system outweigh a marginal technical
superiority.
Information provided by Viatel
should become progressively available:
stock market and commodity prices,
currency exchange rates, airline arrival
and departure times, economic indica-
tors, company data, etc. Telecom’s Yel-
low Pages may be included eventually.
There will be many private services,
some of which may require special re-
ceivers or adaptors. Two such services
exist: Control Data/Computer Power’s
Cybertel and ICL’s Bulletin.
Cybertel was the first Australian na

Copy sizes to your heart's content.
The Minolta EP4SOZ, the world's first compact-sized plain
paper copier with automatic zoom enlargement reduction,
allows you to pick any of 781 magnification ratios between
0.640 X and 1.420 X. This means you can reduce any original
approximately 60% in image area... or enlarge it approximately
100%... in one step.
The EP4SOZ also offers two automatic selection
capabilities. Automatic Magnification Selection chooses the
exact magnification ratio required according to the size of
the original in use and the size of the copy paper
you're using.
Automatic Paper Size Selection chooses the most appropriate
loaded paper size according to the magnification ratio you've
selected and the size of the original in use. Both of these
automatic selection functions speed copying and reduce the
time and paper wasted in making copying errors.
Fora vivid demonstration of the incredible EP4SOZ, bring
some different-sized originals along to your nearest Minolta
office products dealer and make copies—in any sizes —to your
heart's content.

General Motors-Holden’s uses Cy-
bertel to advise dealers of what vehicles

ICL’s Bulletin includes services from
Prudential Insurance, the South Austra-
lian department of Education and the
Victorian department of Agriculture.
Elders Pastoral will have its own
videotex service for primary producers.
It is to start this year, after trials by 200
farmers Australia-wide. The company is
using its own Prestel-based system with
a DEC VAX 750 computer accessed
through Telecom’s Auspac service.
Apart from marketing and oper-
ational information for farm manage-
ment, Elders has arranged for Deloitte
Haskins and Sells to provide informa-
tion on taxation, accounting and econ-
omic forecasts affecting the rural com-
munity. This group also will provide a
“hot line” for answering specific tax-
ation queries.
A subscription to the service will cost
$5OO a year, with a “connect” charge of
$8.35 an hour.
Elders also will provide services
from Agriculture departments nation-
wide, the Bureau of Meteorology, the
Australian Wool Corporation, the
Grain Handling Authority and mer-
chandise suppliers.
Similar farm services exist overseas.
Britain’s Prestel has 500 farmer sub-
scribers and the Winnipeg area of Can-
ada has 2300 subscribers to the
Grassroots service.
TELETEXT
TELETEXT IS the generic name for an
information system in which data to be
transmitted is encoded on otherwise un-
used lines of a normal TV receiver and
decoded by a special adaptor costing a
few hundred dollars.
Pages are selected from a hand-held
keyboard.
Teletext has been more successful in
Europe than in Australia. We have 8000
to 10,000 users compared with a million
or so in the United Kingdom, about
300,000 in the Netherlands, 150,000 in
Austria and about 120,000 in Sweden.
Time Inc (US) planned a 5000-page
service using a fully dedicated TV chan-
nel but abandoned it (and all other
teletext activities) after three years of
experiments.
ELECTRONIC ENCYCLOPAEDIAS
GENERAL encyclopaedias, such as the
Americana or the Britannica, present a
wide realm of recorded knowledge
from the humanities and literature; ap-
“Waddaya mean, user error!?”
plied, fine and performing arts; science
and technology; history and social sci-
ence. But printed encyclopaedias have
inherent limitations. Their sheer size
precludes regular updating; hence they
will rarely contain material of transitory
interest. The Britannica is unlikely ever
to include breakdancing.
Accessing can only (practicably) be
alphabetical, with integrated cross-ref-
erences or, as with the most recent
Britannica, by breaking the work into
three integrated but separate resources.
It is thus impossible, for instance, to col-
late specific discoveries made in 1786 or
obtain an overview of French culture in
the 1900 s. The data is there but a mech-
anism selectively to extract it is not.
Realising that the solution lies in
electronics, Grolier acquired the rights
in 1982 to the then newly-prepared 20-
volume Academic American Encyclo-
pedia. Having been typeset electronic-
ally, it existed in computer-readable
form.
The text of 30,000 articles and nine
million words (updated every six
months) is available on data-bases in-
cluding CompuServe, Dow Jones, BRS,
Dialog and Vu/text and southern Flor-
ida has a Viewtron videotex edition.
Using BRS or Dialog, every word is
indexed individually and can be located
almost instantly as can combinations
of words, even if volumes apart.
This provides an unprecedented
ability to collate facts. For example,
hundreds of references to Einstein exist
in 69 separate articles. But, if research-
ing the physicist’s latter years (at Prince-
ton), instructing the program to extract
only these references to “Einsten” and
“Princeton” produces just paragraphs 1
and 4 of the only (14 paragraph) article
containing the data required.
Grolier, in company with British
publisher Longman, is researching the
feasibility of producing specialised sec-
tions of encyclopaedia material in the
form of video disks (each of which
holds about 54,000 frames). Also under
investigation are audio-visual versions.
Similar facilities are under way in Aus-
tralia where the background data used
in compilation of the Macquarie Dic-
tionary already is available on a public-
access data-base.
Grolier is not the only organisation
to exploit text that has been typeset elec-
tronically. The American Chemical So-
ciety has a program which searches the
original text of its publications for
typesetting codes and replaces them
with data tags recognisable by data-base
software. The society uses this technique
to produce 18 journals, in full text form,
on the BRS data-base. Elsevier’s IRCS
Medical Science, too, is alternatively
available in electronic form.
COMMERCIAL DATA-BASES
TWO THOUSAND or so major data-
bases worldwide provide information
particularly relating to business, engin-
eering and scientific activities. Some of
these bases are gargantuan.
The largest of them all is Lockheed
Corporation’s Dialog which has more
than 100 million records held in 200
separate data-bases categorised by main
subject matter. Dissertation Abstracts
Online, for example, contains every ac-
cepted American doctoral thesis since
1871. There are 842,500 records.
Metadex’s 537,500 records cover inter-
national literature on metallurgy.
Medlines indexes articles from more
than 3000 journals in the field of
biomedicine and has 4,250,000 records.
More than 250,000 are added each year.
Dow Jones provides the text of the
Wall Street Journal and Barrons plus
data from the Dow Jones News Service.

computer, so you could build
a better mouse trap.
If you’re a manufacturer, you’re
always working towards a better product
and more effective marketing.
And that involves integrating many
aspects of your business.
So we give you the NCR 9 300.
The NCR 9300 can pinpoint and plan
production ‘hotlines’ monitor materials,
workloads, sales force performance and
control financial accounting and
customer processing.
In effect, increase manufacturing
efficiency and improve customer service.
Moreover, with its advanced 32-bit
VLSI chip, it does it more quickly, more
reliably, more economically and in a
space 4-5 times smaller than any
comparable mainframe. And it’s not only
manufacturing companies that the 9300
can streamline.
Through its VLSI technology, the
9300 can revolutionise such
diverse operations as local
government, wholesalers,
legal, insurance and construction
companies.
NCR develops, manufactures,
markets, installs and services total
business information systems from small
business systems to the most powerful
general purpose processors and event
driven transaction processors with the
broadest range of terminals, peripherals,
services and software in
the industry.
That is NCR.

ACl’s Ausinet has 25 data-bases of
which 23 are exclusively Australian.
One of the latest, ICAA, is an indexed
data-base of accounting journals.
ICAA also contains selectively in-
dexed articles culled from other publi-
cations including Australian Business,
Australian Director and Australian Law
News.
The CSIRO operates many scientific
data-bases with information ranging
from crystal structures to a directory of
the organisation’s libraries.
Of AAP-Reuters’ 130 data-bases,
about 80 are specifically Australian.
There’s a wide range of services many of
which provide financial data. Two of
the less usual are Formguide, which de-
tails the track performances of 70,000
horses since 1975, and Formguide Sires
Record which tells how well their
progeny run.
Software Sciences, an offshoot of
Thorn-EMI, has a data-base called
World Reporter which contains news
items culled from the British Broadcast-
ing Corporation’s overseas news broad-
casts, the BBC’s monitoring services
and the magazine The Economist.
Australia’s first legal retrieval data-
base is being compiled by Computer
Power (into which Rupert Murdoch’s
News organisation has injected $l2 mil-
lion). Computer Power has an exclusive
three-year licence from the federal gov-
ernment to use state and crown copy-
right material. Other legal publishers
can supply their own copyright material
and receive royalties thereon. The sys-
tem, CLIRS, is to be available early next
year. As well as containing primary
source material, it will be extended to
include the NSW register of business
and company names, a 90-day on-line
Control Data/Computer Power’s Cybertel videotex service: in use in Australia
file of dealing lodgment records
produced by the Land Titles Office and
an electronic diary of listings of the Su-
preme Court of NSW. Similar facilities
are nearing completion in Victoria.
The University of Wollongong’s de-
partment of Accountancy and Legal
Studies is developing a data-base of
Australian corporate law which eventu-
ally should record relevant cases and
published journal articles and provide
on-line access for concerned parties.
The NSW Registrar-General’s office
is converting all its records to data-base
format to which the public will even-
tually (meaning 10 years hence) have
access.
This long-term project will reduce
progressively the amount of work
required when researching property
titles for conveyancing.
While a wealth of material is con-
tained in these and other data-bases, ex-
tracting meaning from them requires
special training. A few, such as the 1971
census data, are totally inaccessible to
anyone without a thorough grounding
in Fortran.
Most people require days of tuit-
ion, particularly in learning search-
ing strategies to reduce connect
time which for many exceeds $l5O
an hour (plus MIDAS’ 20 cents a min-
ute if accessing an overseas facility).
An alternative to learning retrieval
techniques is offered by Infoquest, a ser-
vice run by Myer Communications.
This uses experienced researchers who,
drawing on 200 data-bases worldwide,
provide answers and data relating to
specific queries. Typical searches cost
$lOO to $3OO and might include: provi-
ding information on potential acquisi-
tions in the solar energy field; establish-
ing the cat population of Australia
and the number in metropolitan areas;
supplying all published articles about
the recent wine scandal in France; or
establishing the cost and sweetening
power of xylitol.
A worldwide directory of on-line
data-bases is published quarterly by
Cuadra Associates (Santa Monica, Cali-
fornia) and an Australian one, Directory
Of On-Line Services, is published by the
South Australian College of Advanced
Education. The press-shy Australian
Data-Base Association is also believed
to be producing one.
COMPANY DATA-BASES
SECOND only to the industry’s dream
of placing a computer on every execu-
tive’s desk is having as many of those
computers as possible not only connect-
able to external data-bases but also to
the organisations’ internal data-bases.
This gives executives instantaneous ac-
cess to accurate and presumably up-to-
date data.
Instantaneous access is a strong ar-
gument. Extracting non-routine data
from a mainframe computer requires a
data processing professional to write a
highly technical command sequence
once the request has reached the head of
the queue. “Information is held captive
by the technocrats,” says Dennis Valen-
tine of American Standards Inc. Now,
though, software such as Omnilink from
OnLine Software enables an executive

to use a personal computer to pull
financial data from a corporate
mainframe or minicomputer and load it
into a spreadsheet program.
Peachtree software from Manage-
ment Science America enables data to
be copied from a mainframe computer
to IBM PCs as does Software Inter-
national’s Smart Link, a program devel-
oped following experience gained by
General Electric Information Services
which has installed hundreds of IBM
PCs in financial applications.
The technology exists but its intro-
duction is posing massive potential se-
curity and organisational problems.
Existing computer security methods
may be fine theoretically but they only
work if enforced. “You’ve got to stop
people taping the password to the ter-
minal,” says Ervin Elsnic, of Deltak.
And it’s surprising how many small
computer systems can be accessed by
using the word “system.”
Limiting information to those auth-
orised to access it will became a major
problem when thousands of eager
executive fingers tap away at keyboards.
Concern extends from staff seeking to
establish colleagues’ salaries to stealing
details of mineral discoveries and po-
tential yields or to sabotage.
To design programs so that access is
selectively limited has become routine
but not all software is bug-free apart
from which, human capacity for ran-
dom behaviour is always greater than
expected.
A famous British museum had a
computer display which allowed visi-
tors to enter text. With admirable fore-
sight, a “dirty-word” data-base diverted
unwanted entries from the screen. But,
one memorable day, a visitor entered an
instruction which caused every dirty
word in the machine’s memory to be
dumped on the screen. Despite weeks of
subsequent effort, no programmer was
able to replicate that apparently ran-
dom instruction.
A further major area of concern is
about maintaining the integrity of the
original data.
Most micro/mainframe interfacing
programs enable data to be copied from
the mainframe and manipulated on the
personal computer but not re-copied to
the mainframe.
But some people must be allowed to
make changes in corporate data and de-
ciding whom these people should be
could stop many a large organisation in
its corporate tracks for years.
This area of data-base technology
has problems but there is a belief that
the advantages are so great that accept-
able solutions will be found. □
A LOOK AT THE SHAPE
OF THE FUTURE
Modern Xerox copying system: graphics merged with text, printed rapidly
A TYPICAL personal computer today
costs about $3500 and has 128 kbytes of
random access memory (RAM). Within
12 to 18 months, a unit intended for the
same market will cost about $2500 and
have 256 kbytes of RAM. By 1987,
there’ll be a megabyte of RAM and the
price will have dropped to about $2OOO.
The cost of data storage has fallen at
some 40 percent a year for the past 20
years and the fall seems to be steepen-
ing. Expect to see 5 Mbyte floppy disk
drives by early next year and 10 Mbyte
drives a year later. Both will cost the
same as or less than present 5% inch
(13.3 cm) and 8 inch floppies (and the
computer industry will still be using im-
perial units).
More software programs will be
produced in the chips known as ROM
(Read Only Memories). These devices,
already used for this purpose in video
games, are physically rugged and (un-
like floppy disks) impossible to wipe out
by incorrect keyboard commands. The
software industry likes them because
they are impossible for a non-electron-
ics engineer to copy. Apple uses them in
the Macintosh and Hewlett-Packard
may follow soon probably with Lotus
1-2-3.
Entering the industry is becoming in-
creasingly difficult and will be harder
yet when more Japanese companies
work out how to make good computers
which they will by 1986.
“New companies entering the field
have less than one chance in 10 of
making it,” the Yankee Group’s direc-
tor of research, Dale Kutnick, told a
seminar in April this year.
Companies particularly at risk ap-
pear to be those seeking to make IBM

“AMP FIRE & GENERAL LOOKS AT
ITS INVESTMENTS VBIY CAREFULLY.
WE WENT WITH PERKIN BJIER COMPUTERS
Mr. J.K. Staveley, Managing Director, AMP Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd.
If your company is considering upgrading
its computer facilities and wants a cost effective
solution, consider how AMP Fire 8c General
and Perkin-Elmer Computers work together.
Consider 600,000 general insurance
policies Australia-wide and a computer system
which enables rapid response to customer
queries.
Consider a general insurance computer
system working on a real time updating basis in
one of the most volatile areas of insurance.
Because in the business of general
insurance, you deal with policies which are
continually changing.
Policyholders buy and sell cars, houses and
other assets, and change addresses and
coverages.
A fast updating computer system with
absolute efficiency and reliability is
mandatory.
Working together since 1981, AMP
Fire 8c General and Perkin-Elmer Computers
developed a system based around four
Perkin-Elmer 3200 Series Computers.
A system which is currently being expanded
to bring New Zealand and another 100,000
policies on lineduring 1984.
Right through the system's development,
both companies worked as closely together as
any two companies can.
Developing, refining, testing, installing.
The result?
A general insurance computer system as
advanced as any in Australia.
But then, this isthe Kind of resultyou
expect when you deal with the company which
revolutionised the information industry with
its pioneering of the 32-bit minicomputer.
A company which today employs over
14,000 people world-wide and turns over more
than $1 billion annually.
It was exactly this Kind of stability and
reliability that a stable and reliable company liKe
AMP Fire 8c General wanted.

COMPUTERS
WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER.


IBM having underestimated PC’s sales.
But IBM’s clout assures the giant of
components ahead of its imitators and
production of the PC has caught up.
A faster, multi-user, multi-tasking
version of the PC has been announced
with deliveries starting early next year.
The price in Australia probably will be
about $lO,OOO.
The trend to “badge engineering”
will strengthen.
Convergent Technologies (CT) is
proving to be the answer to a silicon
maiden’s prayer to many a company
caught with a micro hole in its product
range, as ever-increasing numbers of
disenchanted customers insist on buy-
ing all system components from single
suppliers. That company is producing
microcomputers for various major
equipment manufacturers who market
the CT product under their names.
Dedicated word processors are all
but defunct. Wang no longer makes
them and IBM probably will drop them
next year, adapting its Displaywriter
program to run on the PC. If you can
buy a word processor at a good price,
do so but they’ve no long-term future.
Personal computers with word process-
ing software have taken over.
The buzz phrase of 1985 will be
“management support systems.” This
implies interfacing personal computers
with company and external data-bases
so that staff who need to know things
can do so quickly and accurately.
By the end of this year, even low-
priced computers should be able to run
more than one program at a time. Pro-
grams such as Concurrent CP/M al-
ready allow this.
There will be a continuing move
toward “integrated software” busi-
ness software which combines functions
in one package.
This year sees the writing on the wall
for traditional photocopiers and prob-
ably for the present generation of elec-
tromechanical computer printers, par-
ticularly “daisy wheel” and “thimble”
machines.
Current printers, like reciprocating
petrol engines, are improbable examp-
les of an inappropriate technology
pushed beyond realistic limits.
Future printers almost certainly will
use some form of laser or other non-
mechanical-impact device.
A few top-of-the-range (and still
horrendously costly) electronic printers
such as the IBM Information Processor,
the Xerox 9700 and just-released 8700
series machines use a laser to create im-
ages on a photosensitive drum from
which the images are transferred direct-
ly to paper using traditional xerograph-
ic techniques. These machines are essen-
tially high-speed printers and require
the data to be entered in computer form
from a word processor or other form of
computer.
The latest machines in the photo-
copier world scan the material to be
copied, converting pictorial or textual
material into electrical digits control-
ling a printing stage conceptually simi-
lar to the electronic printers.
That the photocopier and the printer
industries are making two versions of a
similar product has not been over-
looked by either, particularly by com-
panies such as Xerox which make both
types of machinery, and soon we shall
see “office printers” beginning to do the
work performed now by the two separ-
ate devices.
We shall also see facsimile machines’
functions included within “office
printers.” Rank Xerox calls its model
295 facsimile machine a Telecopier.
This office typewriter-sized machine can
transmit anything than can be written,
typed or drawn on an A 4 sheet of paper
to anywhere in the world within 30 sec-
onds over standard telephone lines.
SILICON EXPERTS
DURING the past three years, US ven-
ture capitalists have invested more than
US $lOO million in developing “expert”
systems. These are computer systems
which, by drawing conclusions from
huge stores of data, emulate human ex-
perts in specific fields. One, an “elec-
tronic geologist” called Prospector, has
proved dramatically effective it has
accurately located a rich molybdenum
ore deposit under Mount Tolman
(Washington) which human geologists
had been trying for more than 60 years
to find.
Another, called Help, from Control
Data, integrates data obtained on
patients from doctors, pathologists,
pharmacists and nurses and advises
most probable diagnoses and treat-
ments.
By the end of this year, we shall see
at least 30 “expert” systems. □

How many staff
will it take to make your next
overseas call?


Do-it-yourself with ISD
Efficiently:
Direct-dialling overseas calls frees
your staff to do the jobs you pay them to
do. At the same time new ISD efficiencies
now allow you to control costs you had
previously considered uncontrollable.
If your company executives’ access to ISD is
blocked, consider the number
of people it currently can take
to make an overseas phone
call. Then consider the obvious
advantages of ISD.
You can call direct,
without unnecessary delays
and frustrations, to over 150
worldwide destinations. You
interrupt nobody from their
important work. You gain
greater securities by eliminat-
ing unnecessary parties.
A very businesslike
approach to cost
management.
Modern PABX and telephone management systems
allow you to use ISD as you want it, with total
control over the who, when and how, of ISD access
and use.
These systems give you new securities through
new controls and new accountability. Most ISD
accounts can itemise each call by cost, duration
and destination.
You can also benefit from the ISD Ring-Back
Price Service that is now available to most
metropolitan phones. So whoever uses ISD in your
business, however they use it, you can monitor,
control and allocate costs, call by call.
A new control on costs.
Whenever and wherever you call, with ISD you can
significantly reduce your communications costs.
■
Simply, ISD is your cheapest way to call overseas.
Oust $1.30 a minute to New Zealand and the
South Pacific, $1.90 a minute to other countries.)
In fact, ISD is at least 10% cheaper than an
operator-connected call. Dialling overseas direct
yourself is the quickest, cheapest, most convenient
way and you will not tie up
your secretary and switchboard
operator each time you call
overseas.
It adds up to a simple,
cost-efficient equation. The
more calls you make by ISD,
the more you eliminate the
wastage of time and money.
And the less you interrupt
the workflow of others in your
company.
If all these cost savings
and efficiency advantages come
as something of a surprise,
consider this. ISD benefits are
available to most businesses now, at no additional
cost. If you’re on the phone, you should be
switched to ISD - now.

Toshiba introduces
9 printers in 3.
You use your computer for more than one purpose.
Why shouldn’t you use your printer the same way?
With Toshiba’s P 1351, P 1350 and P 1340 you can. A
text mode uses a 24-pin dot matrix printhead to give
you clean, letter-quality copy. A draft mode accelerates
the pace for long jobs or jobs that are required in a
hurry. And graphs are no problem either. The exclusive
printhead delivers a high 180 x 180 dots-per-inch
graphics density pattern. Each printer is really three
printers in one.
The P 1350 and P 1351 double the speed of a
standard daisy wheel printer, producing high quality
copy in the text mode, at 100 cps. The draft mode races
along at 192 cps.
They also offer subscripts, super-
scripts, variable pitch and a variety
of fonts selectable by software
command. And both printers
have extra wide platens. Perfect
for spreadsheet and Lotus
1-2-3 data processing. If
space and budget are a bit
tight, choose the P 1340. It gives you
most of the features of the other two, for less.
With all these advantages, and proven reliability,
it’s little wonder that IBM PC users the world over are
choosing Toshiba printers. No matter which one
you choose, it’s all the printers you need.

Why Brisbane is the bane of bookies
DAVID McNicoll
ARTHUR BROWNING, Bookmaker
Emeritus, who for years was one of the
leaders of Sydney’s interstate ring, tells
me that the bag boys have always been
wary of Brisbane.
Arthur’s only surprise about the Fine
Cotton goings-on was at the amateurish
way it was executed.
For a long time the interstate bookies
have been wary of betting on Brisbane.
Time and again, according to Brown-
ing, there seemed to be only one horse
in whom punters were interested. With a
sinking feeling, the bookies would enter
bets against the horse, knowing that it
was a near certainty.
Why? Is control sloppier in Queens-
land? Are there fewer checks on the
horses and the way they are handled?
As Browning pointed out to me, if
something such as the Fine Cotton
caper can be attempted at Brisbane’s
No l course, Eagle Farm, what
shenanigans have been tried at meetings
at the smaller courses, of which some
are covered by Sydney bookies?
The last point. Certainly the “rung
in” winner had to be disqualified. But
did bets on Fine Cotton have to stand?
If, for instance, you had been an inno-
cent punter at Warwick Farm and had
noticed the plunge on Fine Cotton and
ventured a few dollars on it, quite un-
aware of any malpractice, you would
probably feel hostile that you should do
your money and that the bookies should
reap the benefit of the misplaced caper.
Surely it would have been better to de-
clare it no race. After all, if you can’t
win you should not be able to lose.
MALCOLM FRASER, if you didn’t
know, is one of Australia’s best judges
of red wine. Who can tell? If this attri-
bute had been widely known, he might
have soared in the ratings and even
eclipsed the incumbent teetotaller.
The reason for bringing this up is
that we have just had our annual dinner
of the Single Bottle Club. Why the
writer who knows next to nothing
about wine and dislikes red wine
should be a member is more than any-
one can fathom. Notwithstanding, as
they say when they haven’t anything
else to say, I was present in Melbourne
last week when the members fore-
gathered to worship the grape in its ulti-
mate glory, accompanied by the quite
remarkable food of Hermann Schneider
at the Two Faces restaurant (his quail
pie in truffle glaze would have raised
him to the top echelon at the Versailles
Single Bottle Club offerings: Back row (I to r) 1913 Chateau Suduiraut: 1900 Chateau

kitchens, if we could have wound back a
few centuries).
The former PM was, for his sins,
seated alongside me. My bottle of 1949
Chateau Latour was voted slightly su-
perior to his offering of 1948 from the
same stable. The wines being analysed
by the members ranged from an 1890
Chateau Mouton Rothschild to a
cheeky and fairly recent (1953) and de-
lectable Chateau Petrus. If all the wines
offering had been put up to auction, I
estimated they would have been worth
at least five first class, round-the-world
air tickets.
As the activities of the club are not
generally bruited abroad, I will confine
my remarks to saying that the former
Prime Minister looked extremely well
and relaxed and has been to Canberra
only once in 15 months. Tony Street,
another wine buff, looked the healthiest
gremlin out of parliament. Gino Merlo,
the Brisbane restaurateur, was able to
gaze on the whole scene benevolently,
knowing he has the best cellar in Aus-
tralia. Murray Tyrrell was a bit miser-
able, because his 1945 Mouton
Rothschild was “corked.” May I add
this: the tucker, as well as the magnifi-
cent quail pie, was fabulous cold lob-
ster souffle with caviar; larded fillets of
venison and hare; pear in grapefruit
juice with house-made ice-cream.
THE FIELD for the two Australian
Jockey Club committee vacancies is
now in the starter’s hands and will jump
from the barrier very soon.
There are five starters: Tony Alport,
a Southern Districts and Canberra
racing enthusiast and administrator,
who has the committee nod and in my
view is past the post. Then there is
Arthur Fitzgerald, involved in business
(Caltex) and charitable endeavors, as
well as being a keen racegoer. John
Messara, stockbroker and breeder, is
saddling up for the second time. Peter
Morris, studmaster, and Joe Gazal, suc-
cessful businessman, make up the rest of
the field.
It wll be an interesting contest and in
my opinion it will be fought out be-
tween Alport, Messara and Fitzgerald.

A ghostly search for the spirits
RON SAW
FOR THE last 20 years of his life, my
father was fascinated by spiritualism:
fascinated but not obsessed.
He didn’t make a big deal of it. He
didn’t try to convert anybody but he
read whatever he could on the subject
and discussed it seriously from time to
time and it was through him, I suppose,
that I heard about astral planes, finite
cosmic forces, mysticism, H. G. Wells,
Conan Doyle and the levitations of the
English spiritualist Daniel Home.
In my way, I became as intrigued as
he was; particularly when, after his first
seance, he claimed that he had been
spoken to by his Uncle Henry.
One Friday night when I was about
15,1 was going home for weekend leave
from school looking forward to a
couple of days of orgiastic gluttony and
I was irritated to be asked to “meet your
father with his haunts” on the way
home.
He would be, my mother told me, at
a seance but it was the sort of thing that
might go on for hours and he wanted
me to arrive and get him out of it in time
for dinner.
Mere mention of the feast to come
unsettled me so that my chops were still
awash when I called to rescue him from
the haunts.
It was a nice old house somewhere
near the junction of North Perth and Mt
Lawley and the door was opened by a
pleasant girl of about my age. “They’re
having the seance in the sitting-room,”
she said. “Go on in.”
“But I can’t butt in there and break it
all up, can I?”
“You won’t be breaking anything up.
Any moment now they’ll be having a
cup of tea. I’ve got the kettle on for it
now.”
I walked into a sitting-room with
curtained windows that looked out over
a verandah and a big back garden. The
only light came from one small,
undraped window of leaded, stained
glass.
About eight people, among them my
father, were sitting in a circle. To my
disappointment, there were neither
clasped hands nor disembodied howls.
A middle-aged woman, presumably
the hostess, left the circle and came over
to me. “Victor is just waking up,” she
said. “Then we’ll have a nice cup of
tea.” I said “Yes’m” and salivated anew.
In an armchair with his back to an
ornate marble fireplace sat or
slumped a thin, red-headed man
about 30. It occurred to me that he
should be in the army you tended to
think that way then but that he was
probably kept out by some frightful dis-
ease, which accounted for his emacia-
tion. It also occurred to me that these
people looked remarkably silly sitting
around in a circle waiting for some
clown to snap out of what was, no
doubt, a fake trance.
As I stood there, just inside the door
that had been closed behind me, the me-
dium said in an authoritative voice that
didn’t seem to go with a trance: “There
is somebody here who does not be-
lieve.”
Heads turned, eyes inspected me,
faces moved with distaste. It was my
turn to look silly and I did until the
same voice said: “Come on, let’s show
him.” And the circle became complete
as all the sitters and the medium joined
hands.
The room, as I recall, wasn’t very big
and at one side of it, against the wall,
was what seemed to be a heavy dining-
table, its cloth halfway to the floor, its
top heaped with cups, saucers, cakes
and cookies and a stack of bread-and-
butter-size plates. I am prepared to be-
lieve that what I saw next was an illu-
sion but I’m sure that I did see it and I
can’t think why anybody would want to
create such an illusion.
That table rose perhaps 30cm from
the floor, then fell back with a crash. I
do remember that the top plate of the
pile shot into the air and smashed as it
fell back.
My father and at least one other of
the people present looked genuinely
frightened. I thought nothing of it. I
suppose I had expected something like
that to happen and it wasn’t until we
were driving home that I asked my
father: “How d’you reckon they did
that?”
“Search me,” he said. “Maybe they
didn’t do it at all. Maybe it was some
psychic power. It’s all a bit beyond me.”
That’s the way I’ve thought of it ever
since. I’m prepared to believe that I was
tricked, hypnotised or otherwise conned
though I can’t, for the life of me, im-
agine why anybody would bother. I’m
prepared to believe that the haunts
really were on the job but I’d like some-
body to tell me why they, the haunts,
would want to impress a pimply ado-
lescent.
The people at that seance were spiri


tualists and what I recall of the conver-
sation that followed the levitation cer-
tainly involved spiritualism and so-
called psychic manifestations.
A few years later, then a cadet re-
porter, I went back to the house in
North Perth hoping to get the material
for a feature story. But, though the host-
ess was still there, though she was still
pleasant, she wouldn’t help me.
I’ve had almost no help on the sub-
ject since. I’ve heard the stories of Fish-
er’s Ghost and the ghost of the wife of
Solomon Wiseman but that’s all. Once I
got a rather spooky story about mysteri-
ous travellers on the New England
Highway in NSW and I even wrote it
but nobody came along to back it up.
I’ve heard stories from colleagues and
pretty convincing stories they were but,
there again, nobody is willing to put a
name to ghostly affairs.
The churches, apparently devoted to
the Holy Ghost, ebb and flow on the
subject. Some denominations insist that
it’s all mumbo-jumbo. A few, mostly
Anglican priests, claim to have
exorcised evil spirits or poltergeists.
Fewer still talk easily of things beyond
the grave.
In Sydney, the Psychic Research So-
ciety refuses even to discuss the matter
with journalists and there’s nothing I
can do about that.
From that house in suburban Perth, I
move forward 20 years.
Now I was a married man, working
on the Sydney Daily Mirror and renting
an apartment near the Bridge in
Kirribilli.
Over in Perth, a few years before, my
father had suffered a stroke. He seemed
to be childlike but he was still alive.
One afternoon, I was writing a piece
when my father’s face seemed to come
out of the keys of my typewriter. I sup-
pose you would say that I “came over
queer.” I rubbed my eyes and shook my
head and got back to work but the type-
writer disappeared and so did every-
thing around it and there was only that
face.
At the desk in front of me, drawing
layouts, sat Douglas Flaherty now the
editor of the Brisbane Telegraph.
“I’m feeling a bit strange,” I told
him. “I keep seeing my old man’s face
in this damn typewriter.”
He looked at me intently. “You’d
better push off,” he said. “Push off and
have a drink. Where’ll you be? The
Newcastle?”
I went down to the Newcastle, at Cir-
cular Quay. There I explained to Walter
Sullivan, the actor-writer, what had
happened. He bought me a drink,
watching me carefully. He probably
thought I might bite him on the leg.
About an hour later, I was called to
the telephone. It was the switchboard at
the Mirror. “I’m afraid we’ve got some
bad news for you, dear,” a telephonist
told me.
“It’s my father, isn’t it?”
“Yes, dear, he died this afternoon.”
THAT NIGHT, something awoke me at
Kirribilli. I looked to my left, then sat
up quickly. There, between my bed and
the wall, stood my father. Well, it was
what seemed to be my father.
In my half-awake state, I didn’t re-
member that he had died that afternoon.
I didn’t even remember that he had
been ill. It just seemed a bit odd that he
was there. I sat up.
“When did you arrive?” I asked.
And I may have asked how he arrived.
But, by the time I had collected my wits,
he had gone.
The telephone rang again early the
next morning. It was my mother, calling
from Perth. She sounded terribly upset.
“Dad died,” she said, brokenly.
“Yes, I know. Yesterday afternoon.”
“How did you know, Ron?”
What on earth was I to tell her? □

Laurent Stefanini:
red carpet for a man on

KEITH BARLOW
Naturalist Vincent Serventy says the
book The Living Planet, a companion to
the television series, is magnificent with
“minor flaws.” Author David Atten-
borough, here on a hectic promotion
tour, says all the attention is “very flat-
tering. But, as that shows an insatiable
appetite for compliments not attrac-
tive I’d better say it’s all a frightful
bore.” His clowning endears him to his
crew which zaps around the world
filming television epics. “We did a little
thing in Georgia on forest fires in the
smoking aftermath of a fire. I thought it
was getting hot but I kept waving my
arms around. When I stopped the cam-
eraman fell over laughing because my
trousers were on fire.” Attenborough
does not drive a car or smoke or use any
skin care products to preserve his
English complexion: “Only a bit of Brut
the gorillas think it’s nice and nutty.”
There are schools and schools. But
probably nowhere else in the world is
there one with the influence of France’s
Ecole National d’Administration. Its
classes of 150 or so move into the public
service and eventually run the country.
The different classes form a network the
equivalent of Britain’s old boy system.
So, when Laurent Stefanini turned up at
the Australian Embassy in Paris this
year saying his ENA project was the
South Pacific with a particular focus on
Australia’s role, our people in Paris
rolled out a red carpet. They arranged
for him to work with Pacific Islands
Monthly in Sydney and the Attorney-
General’s department in Canberra.
Stefanini celebrated his 24th birthday in
Sydney, showing that he is moving fast
even for the ENA, which normally
recruits older people.
Mavrick Alf Bussell is again standing
for the federal seat of Forrest in West-
ern Australia, his seventh tilt at a parlia-
mentary post, this time on the sole plat-
form of a new Australian flag. A flirter
with the three major parties, Bussell
claims that as an independent he will
hold the balance of power between Lib-
eral Peter Drummond, 53, who has been
in office for 12 years and the newly-
endorsed Labor hopeful, Perth’s popu-
lar ABC newsreader, Peter Holland, 39.
Bussell says his preferences will go to
the first one who supports a new flag. “I
don’t care if it has a dingo or a beer can,
as long as there’s no Union Jack,” says
: Bussell, 46, a bachelor antique dealer,
i He has stood previously for no nukes
(in Wentworth, NSW) and for saving
the jetty at Busselton, his home town,
founded by his forebears.


Holland has stood down as newsreader
but, if he is unsuccessful, is confident of
remaining with the ABC “even as an
office boy.” Not so inclined is Brisbane
City Extra host Janine Walker, 34, who
resigned to fight the recent Stafford state
by-election for Labor only to be beaten
by Liberal Terry Gygar. An industrial
advocate before taking to talkback
radio, Walker is handling the media for
the Australian Workers Union. Her re-
placement on City Extra is English-born
former doctor Eccles Smith, 59, who has
lived in Australia for 10 years. Wonder
if Smith will wander round the corri-
dors singing “Ying tong ying tong ying

Francois and Marithe Girbaud were

Ky Due Cao was 21 when he arrived in
Australia as a boat person. Within two
years he was a student at WA University

has been published quietly by Artlook.
Cao, now 26, completed a Bachelor of
Economics honors degree last year and
is in Canberra with the statistics bureau.
British miners’ leader Arthur Scargill
was attending a Labor function in Lon-
don when he spied a boy in the throng.
“Hello, young man,” said the avuncular
Scargill, “what do you want to be when
you grow up?” Five-year-old James de
St Croix said: “A policeman.”
Rodney Fox, 43, has had an inordinate
interest in white pointer sharks since
one bit him almost in half off Aldinga
Beach in South Australia in 1963.
“When you’re in the water, you really
have to control that fear,” says Fox. “I
probably have less fear of sharks than
most people because I know more about
them.” He worked on the underwater
sequences for Jaws 1 and 2 and his cur-
rent 46-minute documentary with Justin
Milne (he made Ash Wednesday ) is up
for sale to television. It’s the tale of aba-
lone diver Herb Ilic testing a self-pro-
pelled shark cage with a few playful six-
metre man-eaters.
Ninety-four Canadian bikies have
started a run through Australia from
Cairns to Adelaide. They’re not ex-

Ivan Buchanan, is 75.
The troubles and struggles of getting a
novel published seem to be the same
whether you are 16 or 60. Melbourne
Year 11 student Sonya Hartnett’s effort,
Trouble All The Way, published this
week, was not all plain sailing. She
offered her manuscript to two publish-
ers but the reply from Rigby seemed
more friendly than Hodder and
Stoughton’s. That didn’t stop Rigby
from changing the hero’s name (Tim
was originally Bow but that was thought
too effeminate) and improving some of
the slang. But Harnett resisted pressure
to change Jason (“too aristocratic”), the
older brother’s appellation. And she’s
not mad about the cover. No wonder
she’s gone back to training her whippet,
Zac.

The do-it-yourself universe
PHILLIP ADAMS
AT THE END of World War 11, Arthur
C. Clarke dreamed up the communica-
tions satellite. His first essays on the
subject were tentative, as if Clarke
feared a wave of ridicule. Even now,
with satellites bumper-to-bumper in the
freeways on the fringe of space, he’s
cautious about his next speculations,
which he taps out on his word processor
in Sri Lanka and transmits via satellite
to his publisher in New York.
For Clarke complains that great
ideas frequently have been bedevilled
by failure of nerve and failure of im-
agination. Thus, in 1878, when Thomas
Edison announced that he was working
on an electric light bulb for home use, a
British parliamentary committee was
enormously unimpressed. It described
the idea as “unworthy of the attention
of practical or scientific men.”
We know that experts pooh-poohed
the idea of heavier-than-air flight, fortu-
nately failing to convince the brothers
Wright.
More recently, in the mid-19505,
newly-appointed Astronomer Royal Dr
Richard Van Dereet Woolley confident-
ly assured the press that space travel
was “utter bilge.” Unfortunately for Dr
Richard Van Dereet Woolley, Sputnik
was launched the following year.
Clarke recalls a surprising failure of
imagination on the part of the great
New Zealand physicist Lord
Rutherford “who more than any man
laid bare the internal structure of that
atom.” Rutherford decried those who
thought the energy trapped in matter
could be freed and harnessed. He failed
to consider the possibility of a nuclear
reaction that would release more energy
than it used. The first chain reaction oc-
curred just five years after his death.
I found myself thinking about
Clarke the other day when I saw a
trailer for the sequel to 2001: A Space
Odyssey. “On your screens this Christ-
mas.” Starring good ol’ Hal, the sinister
computer, with Also Sprach Zarathustra
for the theme once more. The book
enormous fun was written by Clarke
in his Sri Lankan exile where he sits
staring into the stars and imagining the
most extraordinary things.
Clarke has always seen space provi-
ding both boundless energy and a vast,
inexhaustible quarry. We are, he re-
minds us, surrounded by infinite
supplies of everything; any shortages
are clearly short-term. “The time may
come,” he writes, “when the twin prob-
lems of production and distribution are
solved so completely that every man can
almost literally possess anything he
pleases.” And he means literally any-
thing, from a Maserati to a Mona Lisa.
As he patiently explains, everything
is made up of something. If you have a
sufficiently detailed “recipe,” you can
cook up an exact duplicate. Make
clones, as it were, of what you fancy. We
think of clones in terms of living organ-
isms. Animal or vegetable. He’s talking
about clones of inanimate objects.
Mineral.
Clarke dreams of building a
replicator a device that could scan an
inanimate object atom by atom, record-
ing it, storing it, so that we could play
back the original any time, anywhere.
He sees “no philosophic contradic-
tions or absurdities” in the idea, re-
minding us that photography would
seem a miracle to an artist of the Middle
Ages. In any case, a primitive version of
his replicator at least in its storage
and playback functions exists with
micro-electronics.
Components too small to be seen
with the naked eye, sometimes too small
to be studied with microscopes, are
“built up by controlled displays of
atoms, literally layer by layer.”
Clarke argues that it’s only a matter
of scale. Simply build your replicator
and you have created Aladdin’s Lamp,
released an endlessly regenerating ge-
nie, giving yourself not three but three
billion wishes. The replicator would
simply scrutinise the object of your lust
and re-create it. Countless clones, on
command.
Naturally, the replicator would begin
by cloning itself. That’s the beaut part:
you’d only have to build one replicator.
As soon as the first came off the as-
sembly line, it would produce the sec-
ond and so on exponentially.
No more work, no more manufactur-
ing. Everyone would have a replicator
in their home (which would be a replica
of a favorite Frank Lloyd Wright or the
Taj Mahal or Buckingham Palace)
where they’d cheerfully churn out what-
ever took their fancy.
I’d stop fiddling around with minor
Egyptian antiquities and replicate a few
dozen of the country’s 80 pyramids.
You might prefer to clone a favorite
Bentley or Bugatti or to give your child
a Stradivarius for violin lessons. Pro-
vided that you could borrow the origin-
al, the rest would be idiot-simple.
The replicator would work from
recipes, from programs produced else-
where. Companies would organise
atomic analyses of appliances, objets
d’art, of any and every artifact from
venerable antiquity to electronic today.
There’d be a last-ditch stand from copy-
right owners, the Louvre not wanting to
see a million Mona Lisas flooding the
market particularly when they’d be as
authentic as their own.
Indeed, to tell which was Leonardo’s
and which the copy would be quite im-
possible.
Every blemish on the paint, every
crack in the panel, every wormhole in
the frame would be re-created so that
the famous enigmatic smile could be
seen above a multitude of mantelpieces.
From Sri Lanka to Shangri-la. But
wouldn’t the world, if not the entire uni-
verse, sink beneath the weight of cloned
objects? Would not our insatiable appe-
tites produce such a surfeit of goodies
that we’d be buried? Crushed beneath
the weight of our own greed?
Possibly not.
Clarke believes that we would regain
our priorities and establish new ones
“where material objects are all intrinsi-
cally worthless. And perhaps only then
will a real sense of values arise ... and
then our descendants, no longer clut-
tered up with possessions, will remem-
ber what many of us have forgotten
that the only things in the world that
really matter are such imponderables as
beauty and wisdom, laughter and love.”

Future, published (or, rather, replicated)

The action at the Paris end
BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
THIS IS the most beautiful time in his-
tory to be in the brothel business. We
don’t even have to call it massage, rub-
bing or kneading any more.
Last June, the Victorian Government
legalised brothels. Massage parlors
would have to be called (shudder)
brothels. Indeed, one company Pituri
Pty Ltd appeared before the Planning
Appeals Board last week. Pituri had
asked for a permit to run an “exercise
and relaxation centre”; it changed the
application to say “brothel.”
The relaxation centre
brothels would be banned
under the legislation from
residential areas and not al-
lowed to operate within 40
metres of kindergartens, pri-
mary or secondary schools,
scout or guide halls.
Ah, but they would be al-
lowed to operate in office,
business and industrial zones
if they had council permit. In
effect, parliament shovelled
the ghastly problem out of
Spring Street and put it in the
hands of local government.
And here was the rub: There
was a twilight settling-down
period. All brotheldom had 12
months to relocate or obtain
council permits. So, you see,
this is a vintage year in which
to start your brothel.
There has been much recrimination
particularly in South Melbourne, one
of the finest relaxation areas. The sug-
gestion has emerged that King’s Place,
one of the busiest brothel areas, have its
name changed to Cain Lane in honor of
the Premier.
The state opposition launched an as-
sault last week, saying that the official
estimate of 150 brothels in Melbourne
was hundreds below the actual figure
and that under the new legislation
they were opening up all over.
The Planning and Environment min-
ister, Evan Walker, denied this. He said
that police were under instructions to
act against new illegal brothels during
the moratorium.
However, opposition spokesman on
the environment Bruce Chamberlain,
shadow minister for planning and con-
servation, took up the attack. Isn’t it fas-
cinating what conservation covers at
this time?
Chamberlain said that there was a
brothel within 200 m within a minute’s
walk of the Premier’s office in
Treasury Place. Chamberlain did not
name the brothel, so it was most embar-
rassing for everyone within a minute’s
range. After all, the Windsor Hotel, a
Baptist Church and St Patrick’s Cathe-
dral are all less than a minute off.
However, The Age newspaper identi-
fied the street (Collins), the madam (Ms
Rita Milroy) and the Herald made it
more convenient for everyone: Suite 2,
15th floor, 15 Collins Street. Some
would say that such an establishment
only adds charm to the so-called legend
of the “Paris end” of Collins.
However, this is a narrow-gutted, ut-
terly unlovely, 22 storey building near
the corner of Spring Street and almost
opposite the Melbourne Club. It went
up in the early 70s and was among the
first to contribute to the demise of the
Paris end. The building, one might say,
is full of all sorts of professionals den-
tists, doctors, gynaecologists and psy-
chiatrists many of whom are very up-
set about the other profession on the
15th floor.
Milroy employs five girls who oper-
ate round the clock. The charge is $75
through to $95 for “fantasy” with exotic
gear and lingerie. If you want two girls
at the one time, it is $l5O. There are two
bedrooms with very large beds and
brass bedstead. The living-room sports
much velvet and chrome and a bar.
From a balcony, you can wave down
toward the Treasury.
Naturally, those of us with a sense of
history are fascinated.
Melbourne, despite its prim reputa-
tion, always has been a strong city for
prostitutes. In 1885, according to the
Victorian Government Year Book, there
were 597 prostitutes in Melbourne
21.10 per 10,000 people which beat
the hell out of Sydney (27.34); Brisbane
(31.82) and Adelaide (48.14). Although,
the Methodist Spectator said our true
figure was 2000 prostitutes.
The most famous establishment, less
than a minute from Parliament House,
was run by Madame Brussells from
1876 to 1908. She had a series of houses,
complete with secluded gar-
den, that went right through to
Little Lonsdale. According to
Truth, Madame Caroline
Brussells employed 30
“nymphs”; she had a labyr-
inth of elegantly furnished
rooms, sumptuous marble
bathrooms and all sorts of
cosy nooks. The showroom
was her own bedroom, fur-
nished at a cost of 2000
pounds.
Then, of course, late of
Thursday night, October 8,
1891, the parliamentary mace
disappeared. Three papers
took up the scandal Mel-
bourne Punch, Table Talk and
the Ballarat Courier. The
Courier, which was called be-
fore the bar of the house,
claimed that the mace had dis-
appeared into Boccaccio House.
Boccaccio House was the “bagnio” of
Madame Brussells’ greatest rival, Annie
Wilson.
Legend had it that some members
had got drunk that night, taken the
mace to Annie’s place and ran a mock
parliament in the presence of all her
nymphs. The government launched an
inquiry. All four members of the board,
including the chairman, were members
of the Legislative Assembly. Nothing
ever was proved. The police also made
an investigation but not a line of their
report was made public.
Parliament ordered a new mace in
1901 but what happened to the one
which went astray on October 8, has not
been revealed.
I do not know the exact location of
Boccaccio House. It may well have been
at the Paris end of Collins Street. If any
of our readers are visiting a nice bagnio
within a minute’s walk of the Premier’s
office and come across a long and or-
nate object with a golden crown on the
end of it, we would be very grateful if
they would call the editor. □

U.S. AFFAIRS
CAMPAIGN' 84
Here They
Go Again
Confident and ready for combat, Reagan begins his
campaign hoping for a landslide. The Ferraro furor
is fading away, but could Mondale pull an upset?
The fate of the Democratic ticket hung in
the stuffy atmosphere of the Starlight Gar-
dens Ballroom in Queens. As a national TV
audience watched, Geraldine Ferraro put
history, her career and her family on the line
before 250 reporters. She handled challenges
to old tax returns, to intricate property deals,
to sloppy financing. The tension flowed free-
ly. “Answer it!” a questioner interrupted
rudely; Ferraro smiled patiently. After 90
minutes the session broke up—and the re-
porters applauded. Out in North Oaks,
Minn., Walter Mondale materialized on his
driveway to congratulate his running mate.
As newsmen gathered close, the candidate
from the shadows joked: “Did you miss me?”
Mondale in Minnesota: ‘Did you miss me?’
LARRY DOWNING— Newsweek
“Is there any doubt they will raise our
taxes?” “No!” came the explosion at the GOP
convention in Dallas. “That they will send
inflation into orbit again?” “No!” “That they
will make government bigger than ever and
deficits even worse?” “No!” Ronald Reagan
was on the stage, Democrat-bashing was in
the air—and the Republican pulses were
pounding. For his finale, the Gipper suddenly
switched tempos to a sentimental journey
along the path of the Olympic torch. It led
from New York (cheers in that delegation), to
Boston (more glee), to Chicago, south to At-
lanta, through the arch at St. Louis, from
“the stark beauty of the Southwest ” to “the
greening Northwest” and on to California.
Little pockets ofregionalpride erupted across
the floor. Reagan's real refrain was under-
stood: that in 1984, this land is his land.
Two contestants took the blocks last week
for the final, 75-day dash to decision—but
the Republican president started with the
inside track and a long lead. Reagan’s vale-
dictory to convention politics ignited his
true believers and sent him off with national
ratings that already soared past the dead
heat won by Mondale in San Francisco. The
South and West were Reagan country.
Healthy economic numbers gave him weap-
ons in the North and East. His master plan-
ners counseled against complacency, then
fell prey themselves to talk of “blowouts”
and “slam-dunks.” Reagan faced the voters
with his usual quick nod and folksy smile.
Yet 20 years of presidential ambition steeled
him for any trench warfare his opponent
might choose. Against the Democratic “tale
of two cities”—one rich, one poor, he eager-
ly evoked again his own America, a “shining
city on a hill.”
Reagan heralded the “clearest political
choice of a half century”—and the evidence
suggested mean, starkly ideological and fla-
vorful politics down to Election Day. After
the final GOP gavel in Dallas, Mondale
ventured into the Republican heartland:
Abe Lincoln’s Springfield, 111. His best
hopes assumed that Ferraro had quelled the
Nancy and the Gipper greet their fans in Dallas:
furor over her finances, that some of his own
attacks on Reagan’s deficit, tax plans and
“unfairness” might thus sink home—and
that his campaign staff, preoccupied by Fer-
raro’s tax forms, can now focus full blast on
the opposition. Mondale has shown a capac-
ity for comebacks, for dramatics and for the
style of one-on-one debates he is seeking
from his opponent. Mondale caught Reagan
off guard with his choice of Ferraro and put
him on the defensive over the incumbent’s
so-called secret tax plan. The president’s
operatives worry that Mondale might man-
age to further rearrange the chessboard, as
one puts it, before Nov. 6. Their consolation:
the Mondale campaign has run out of afford-
able mistakes.
For now, the chessboard could hardly
look better for Reagan. His preconvention
numbers put him comfortably ahead in such
key Mondale targets as Texas (28 points),
New Jersey (23) and Michigan (16). Even
Democratic surveys concede a 20-point
Reagan lead in many Southern states. The
Reagan strength leaves Mondale with little


The incumbent faced the voters with a quick nod and a folksy smile—eager to beat the Democrats in any style of trench warfare they might choose
room to maneuver. He must win six of the
“big eight” swing states —California, Texas,
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. In addition, he
must scrape up 70 of his 270 electoral votes
from the South; Mondale will focus on Mis-
sissippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Ten-
nessee and Kentucky. Beyond his base in the
industrial Northeast and Midwest, he will
fight it out in Texas, in Washington and
Oregon, and—pressing his luck —on Rea-
gan’s home turf in California.
Mondale must somehow find chinks in
the armor of an incumbent whose House
polls show that 56 percent of his constit-
uents believe he has put the country “on the
right track”; the approval rating is even
higher among younger voters. For now,
Mondale is targeting moderates distressed
with the hard-right leanings of the GOP
platform, women whose support for Reagan
still lags behind men’s and farm-belt con-
stituents who have not enjoyed the economic
recovery. The Mondale camp is ready for
new openings. Reagan scored points with his
“stroll down memory lane” to attack the
Carter-Mondale administration. But that
GOP backward glance “left the future open
to the Democrats, which both surprised and
pleased me,” claims Mondale’s polltaker,
Peter Hart. “They seemed to spend all of
their time blasting the Democrats. ”
Reagan’s persistent enemy is overconfi-
dence. In Dallas, Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York and other right-wing architects of the
Republican platform were already assum-
ing his victory, game-planning a way to turn
it into a generation of Republican predomi-
nance and plotting the next term’s 100 Days.
They envisioned a blitz of tax and program
cuts amounting to the mirror image of
FDR’s —and posing Mondale as the Her-
bert Hoover with outdated remedies. Vice
President George Bush seized the status of
1988’s front runner for Republican moder-
ates, berating his own party’s “furthest-out
fringes” with an intensity just short of his
attacks on Mondale. The convention’s out-
pouring of affection for Reagan was tinged
with sadness. Delegates knew that their
champion was fighting his last battle —and
that their 1988 meeting might well feature
rancor and division.
Reagan gave his own solemn warning that
complacency now could set back every Re-
publican’s cause. He has already disdained a
Rose Garden strategy and laid on a heavy
campaign schedule. “Reagan can play po-
litical offense a lot better than he can play
political defense,” says his public-opinion
expert Richard Wirthlin, adding that the
president’s style “dictates an aggressive,
bold campaign.” The incumbent’s advisers
recall well that his race against Jimmy Car-
ter was settled only in the final days. Since
1968, 11 to 15 percent of the nation’s voters
have made their choice within a presidential
campaign’s last three days—and 1984 will
surely tighten up as well. As decision time
approaches, Ronald Reagan will bash the
Democrats’ “statism.” Walter Mondale will
sound an eloquent call against Republican
injustice. The starting gun has sounded—
and America loves a good race.

Can Mondale
Come Back?
After a stunning convention and a searing August,
the Mondale-Ferraro ticket must now confront the
real problem: how to dethrone a popular incumbent.
Once again the Democrats are staring
into the abyss: confronting a confident presi-
dent comfortably astride the polls while
their own nominee seems hesitant and near-
ly invisible. Other Democrats have been in
deep trouble before Labor Day—such as
Adlai Stevenson in 1956 and George Mc-
Govern in 1972, two of the biggest losers in
history. But so was Hubert Humphrey in
1968—and he nearly won. Still, it might be
appropriate for Walter Mondale to ask him-
self, “Can this campaign be saved?” Instead,
he seems to be radiating what-me-worry?
detachment. Mondale spent most of last
week cloistered in North Oaks, Minn.,
watching with bemusement as the Republi-
Desperate days for a once dynamic duo: Ticketed for defeat?
LARRY DOWNING— Newsweek
cans ripped him asunder in Dallas—and
laughing over a video cassette of “Monty
Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl.”
Democrats—even the gloomy ones —ar-
gue that the electorate is volatile and Mon-
dale has 10 weeks to turn things around. But
judging from the recent national polls, that
may require one of the largest mass conver-
sions since the glory days of revivalist Aimee
Semple McPherson. Political strategists
from both parties agree that Mondale trails
Ronald Reagan by 10 to 15 percentage
points, and a state-by-state analysis (map)
could be entitled “Wipeout. ” Mondale leads
in just four states and the District of Colum-
bia. “What we have is a growing indifference
to Walter Mondale,” said consultant Ray-
mond Strother, who had worked for Gary
Hart. “He’s not seizing the initiative.”
Adept: Mondale’s public support for em-
battled running mate Geraldine Ferraro was
muted—almost tentative —as she fought to
quell a crescendo of criticism over her fam-
ily’s finances (box). Behind the scenes, Mon-
dale aides shepherded the preparation of
Ferraro’s disclosure forms, as Mondale him-
self consciously shied away
from pressuring her. Fortu-
nately for Ferraro, she
proved adept at handling
her own public relations.
For 90 minutes she radiated
composure as she tenacious-
ly defended her integrity
and that of her husband,
John Zaccaro, during one of
the most hostile press con-
ferences since Watergate.
Even after the disclosures
there were still unanswered
questions about the couple’s
finances. But Mondale aides
were hopeful that the worst
was over. Still, as Reagan
polltaker Richard Wirthlin
pointed out, “They have lost
the most valuable of all as-
sets —time.”
Many of Mondale’s other
problems stem from his own
miscalculations and those of his sometimes
hermetic campaign staff. The troika of John
Reilly, Jim Johnson and Bob Beckel does not
seem fully prepared for the rigors of the fall
campaign. The maladroit treatment of Bert
Lance has caused lasting repercussions in
the South; Reagan-Bush operatives now
claim to be leading by a stunning 26 percent-
age points in Georgia. In recent weeks the
Mondale campaign has antagonized Jesse
Jackson and black leaders like Atlanta May-
or Andrew Young. Only on Saturday did
Mondale finally meet with 15 Democratic
governors. Democratic strategists in key
states also claim to have been shut out by the
bunker mentality displayed by the Mondale
camp. “You don’t hear them calling for
advice, asking us how to work it,” groused a
top T exas Democrat.
So far, only one issue has worked for
Mondale: his contention that Reagan has a
“secret plan” to raise taxes. Mondale’s
freshly minted persona as Fiscally Frugal
Fritz was the toast of San Francisco. But
now the campaign seems flummoxed over
how to exploit it. There is no word on when
Mondale will release his own revised tax
program designed to show his superior abili-
ty to cut the deficit fairly.
Pallid: When Mondale finally emerged
from seclusion to address an outdoor rally in
Springfield, 111., it was a pallid rejoinder to
the president’s pyrotechnics. Mondale’s
strategy was to depict the Republican con-
vention as a tribal reunion of fat cats —the
spiritual descendants of the tycoons who
sneered at FDR over lunch at the Union
League Club. He claimed that the theory
behind Reaganomics was “a rising tide lifts
all yachts.” He labeled the GOP delegates
“uppies” who “made out like bandits under
Ronald Reagan.” And hoping to attract
Republican moderates, Mondale unveiled a
new theme: the GOP platform was written
by the “kook right.” The Republicans, said
Mondale polltaker Peter Hart, “have a plat-
form that even the president’s daughter
couldn’t vote for.”
But it was Ferraro’s resurrection that
provided the week’s only solace for the Dem-
ocrats. The tide of public opinion began to
turn late Monday night when she released
her disclosure forms and the family’s tax
returns since 1978. Confounding the skep-
tics, they showed that the couple had paid
hefty taxes on their combined incomes.
There were none of the expected real-estate
shelters; in fact, the couple paid a slightly
higher percentage of income to the govern-
ment than did the Reagans.

grueling 90-minute press conference: She conceded almost nothing—save for the sin of hiring a mistake-prone accountant, a real ‘sweetheart’
The disclosures also contained several
awkward admissions. The family had un-
derpaid its joint 1978 taxes —and Ferraro
wrote a $53,459 check to the IRS. John
Zaccaro had repurchased a piece of proper-
ty (231 Centre Street) that Ferraro herself
had sold at a hefty profit to repay illegal
loans made to her 1978 congressional cam-
paign by her husband and her children’s
trust funds (Newsweek, Aug. 27). More-
The dismal political landscape for Mondale-Ferraro: ‘They have lost the most valuable of all assets—time’
over, Ferraro forever belied her populist
image as just a typical Queens housewife
when it was revealed that she and her hus-
band have combined assets of $3.8 million.
They seem to be worth about $1.7 million
more than those exemplars of country-club
Republicanism, George and Barbara Bush,
whose own tax returns remain hidden be-
hind a blind trust.
At her press conference, Ferraro immedi-
ately took the offensive by claiming—with
some justice—that she had released more
financial information than “any other can-
didate in history.” She acknowledged only
one sin—relying on the advice of a mistake-
prone accountant, a man whom she de-
scribed as a “sweetheart.” But she turned
even that into a just-folks virtue: her hus-
band, despite his assets, had not patronized
high-priced accountants and lawyers.
During the detailed cross-examination,
Ferraro all but admitted that Zaccaro’s de-
cision to repurchase the property at 231
Centre Street had been an error in judg-
ment, since it could call into question the
funding of her 1978 congressional cam-
paign. She recounted that she learned of
the 1979 transaction only recently—and
promptly asked her husband, “Why did you
do it?” Zaccaro’s response was that it was
perfectly legal. “Sure it was,” she recalled
saying, “but it doesn’t look so hot.” None-
theless, Ferraro never budged from her
contention that everything they had done
“was legal.”
Occasionally, Ferraro would deflect a
hostile question with impatience. There
were a few jokes about her new accountants
from the Arthur Young firm—“ They hold
themselves out to be experts. I sure hope
they are. Just kidding, guys.”
In perhaps her most inventive
argument, Ferraro added a
phrase to the political lexicon:
the “two refrigerators” princi-
ple. She contended that she was
entitled to use a loophole on her
congressional disclosure form
to avoid revealing her hus-
band’s finances; otherwise the
exemption would only apply to
couples that had so segregated
their finances that they used
separate refrigerators.
Jostling: The Republicans
had piously proclaimed a
hands-off attitude toward Fer-
raro’s finances —hoping that
the press would do their dirty
work for them. But as the story
faded from the headlines, they
couldn’t resist the temptation
to do a little jostling behind the
scenes. Republican operatives
in Dallas began suggesting new
avenues of inquiry for report-
ers. Reagan adviser Drew Lew-
is, for example, suggested that
the media should keep search-
ing for Zaccaro tax shelters.
Even without new Ferraro disclosures,
GOP strategists are confident that the
wounds will be lasting—for Mondale. “It
highlights his further vacillation and his
inability to lead,” said a top Reagan adviser.
“He hasn’t shown any support for his nomi-
nee. He’s let his staff trash her. It’s been a
really shabby performance all around.”
There was some backstabbing of Ferraro
by Mondale aides, but she herself did little to


The Ferraro Finances
The tax forms and disclosure statements
were piled more than one inch thick—and
they contained no smoking guns. What
they did reveal was a host of minor errors,
sloppy reporting practices and allegedly
bum steers from lawyers and accountants.
Mostly, they provided a rare if clouded
glimpse into the complex world of a family-
owned real-estate business in New York.
The questions raised had more to do with
John Zaccaro’s financial dealings than
Geraldine Ferraro’s qualifications for vice
president. Still, a few loose ends could trip
up Ferraro—politically at least —through
November and beyond.
Real-estate veterans were surprised to
see that the couple had paid substantial
personal-income taxes since 1978, making
no use of tax shelters. That may not always
have been the case. According to income-
averaging figures in their tax returns, they
reported remarkably little taxable income
from 1974 to 1977 —averaging only about
$29,000 a year jointly. Ferraro and Zaccaro
refused to discuss their pre-197 8 finances in
an interview with Newsweek, butjudging
from their comfortable Forest Hills life-
style, the most plausible explanation is that
they were sheltering their income heavily.
If so, they ceased this practice after Ferraro
was elected to Congress in 1978. Even apart
from that, Zaccaro’s business income
soared several-fold, but Ferraro and Zac-
caro flatly denied that his business bene-
fited from her political in-
fluence. In fact, Zaccaro
stopped doing business in
her Queens district, he said,
to avoid even the appear-
ance of a conflict.
Loans: Ferraro’s financial
statements to the Federal
Election Commission also
revealed that starting in
1978 Zaccaro began making
no-interest loans to himself
from one family business;
they totaled $152,926 as of
last month. There, too, there
was no suggestion of impro-
priety. The IRS has tried for
years to tax the imputed in-
terest on such transactions,
but the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled only this year that tax-
es are applicable. Zaccaro
refused to release some doc-
uments filed with the IRS
detailing his business inter-
ests. But that information
presumably would be more
useful to Zaccaro’s competi-
tors than to Ferraro’s politi-
cal opponents.
The $53,459 check Fer-
raro sent the IRS last week
for a 1978 tax error —plus
interest —was far less than the $250,000
some Mondale aides had
fearfully anticipated. They
apparently speculated that
the IRS might assess civil-
and criminal-fraud penal-
ties as well, but that is high-
ly unlikely, since Ferraro’s
accountants voluntarily re-
ported the underpayment,
and all sides claimed it
stemmed from a simple ac-
counting error. In 1979 the
FEC fined Ferraro $750
for a related campaign loan
from her husband and chil-
dren it deemed improper—
but last week George Wash-
ington University law Prof.
John Banzhaf filed a cit-
izen’s complaint asking the
commission to reopen the
matter. Banzhaf also asked
Attorney General William
French Smith to appoint a
special counsel to inves-
tigate the Ferraro case for
possible criminal violations,
but a formal Justice De-
partment probe is doubtful.
Ferraro’s claim that her

finances are separate from Zaccaro’s will
also be scrutinized further. Last week the
conservative Washington Legal Founda-
tion asked the House Ethics Committee to
investigate her decision not to disclose his
assets —under a loophole in the Ethics in
Government Act —as well as her failure to
report that she was an officer and part
owner of the P. Zaccaro Co. Ferraro main-
tained the exemption was proper because
she knew nothing of the company’s oper-
ations —and legal experts agree that the
rules are confusing. The Ethics Committee
will discuss the issue when it meets Sept. 12.
But the panel probably will not resolve the
question before Ferraro leaves Congress.
After that, she could no longer be subject to
a House review.
Zaccaro, meanwhile, was in a Queens
courtroom last week explaining how he
came to borrow $175,000 from an elderly
woman’s estate he managed as a court-
appointed conservator. He had repaid the
funds, at 12 percent interest, and he swore
“before ever-loving God” that no one had
told him such borrowing was improper.
(The prohibition against such self-dealing
is so well understood in the legal communi-
ty “it’s like saying when you drive on a road,
driveon the pavement,” scoffed court refer-
ee Jonathan Weinstein.) Queens Supreme

According to the statements released last week, Ferraro and Zaccaro
reported surprisingly little taxable income before 1978—the year Ferraro
won her seat in Congress, Whether they used tax shelters or whether the

win the boss’s confidence. In a Newsweek
interview (box), Ferraro conceded that she
had never informed Mondale that Zaccaro
was balking at releasing his tax returns.
About three weeks ago she had told the
Texas congressional delegation about the
problem during an olf-the-record lunch. But
then for four days she said nothing to Mon-
dale—and it didn’t come up again until she
was asked about it at a weekend press confer-
ence. “Maybe I should have anticipated the
question,” Ferraro said. “I did not. One
problem I still have is when the press asks me
a question directly like that, I feel compelled
to give an honest answer.” Ferraro contends
that the reason she left Mondale in the dark
was “because I didn’t expect that question
was going to come up.”
For his part, Zaccaro seemed profoundly
uncomfortable over the media attention.
During the Newsweek interview, he sat in
a stiff-backed chair with his hands on his
knees looking as if he desperately yearned to
be somewhere else. “I wanted my privacy,
basically,” he said in explaining why he
had originally objected to releasing his
tax returns. “Being in the real-estate busi-
ness, appreciation [of properties] was one
problem; competitors were another prob-
lem. And I didn’t want to talk about other
properties that I had partners in.” Forced to
choose between privacy and his wife’s ca-
reer, Zaccaro opted for disclosure. Ferraro
later said in a TV interview that she might
have turned down the nomination if she had
known the pain it would cause her family.
‘Rev Up*: Beckel, Mondale’s campaign
director, proclaimed the Democratic cam-
paign about ready to “rev up” and leave the
Ferraro furor in the dust. But another top
strategist is less sanguine: “Can we achieve
it? Yes. But the clock is ticking and we have
to come out hard and fast.” One of Mon-
dale’s first steps on the road back will be a
meeting in North Oaks this week with Jesse
Jackson, Andy Young and other black lead-
ers designed to repair strained relations.
Mondale recently antagonized Jackson by
saying, in a voice loud enough to be over-
heard on his campaign plane, that he had
hired one of Jesse’s campaign aides—“and
that wasn’t enough.” Mondale quickly add-
ed, “I can win this thing on my own. ” Young,
in a recent speech, attacked the highhanded
tactics of Mondale aides, whom he called
“smart-ass white boys.” He later apologized
for the remark.
The Republican convention and Rea-
gan’s hard-right rhetoric did not change the
Democrats’ fall strategy —they enhanced it.
The Mondale-Ferraro duo will stress their
vision of America’s dismal future in a second
Reagan term: a nation run by an aging fig-
urehead president who clings to right-wing
ideology because he doesn’t understand the
world. Some of the Mondale themes were
already product-tested in San Francisco:
nuclear war, taxes and the budget deficit.
But the most sensitive element in the Mon-
dale strategy will be exploiting the age
issue. Mondale won’t talk about the subject
directly, but campaign surrogates will. Last
week party chairman Charles Manatt used
Reagan’s “bomb” joke as an excuse to bring
up the president’s age, claiming that it was
“on the minds of the American public.”
Dotty Lynch, a Mondale polltaker, said that
the strategy was getting the voters to con-
trast “the stability of Mondale versus the age
thing with Reagan.” She contends that “a
73-year-old right-wing president is terribly
vulnerable by definition. ’’
Retreat: Victory, for now, appears prob-
lematical. And it would require Mondale to
again seize the olfensive. The Mondale high
command has tentatively identified the
swing states where it will concentrate its
energies. Aside from their base in the North-
east and Midwest, Mondale and Ferraro will
campaign intensively in California, Wash-
ington, Oregon and Texas and six Southern

states —Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,
Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Mon-
dale plans to campaign five days a week until
October, though there is concern that he will
compound his isolation if he spends week-
ends in North Oaks. Mondale’s Minnesota
retreat has become emblematic of his cur-
rent status as the invisible man of Campaign
’ 84. Unless he pulls off - a comeback worthy of
Harry Truman, Mondale will have plenty of
time to enjoy Monty Python movies there
after November.

Court Justice Edwin Kassoff is expected
to rule on the case this week—and he
could force Zaccaro to forfeit his conser-
vator’s fee or remove him from the post.
How did Zaccaro, who is not a lawyer,
come to win the lucrative appointment—
along with three other conservatorships?
Some Queens politicians said such awards
are a common form of patronage, but
Ferraro denied that political influence
was involved.
Tabloids: Still more questions about Zac-
caro’s business affairs emerged as eager
tabloid reporters scoured the dusty record
rooms of New York City. The New York
Post trumpeted that Zaccaro once made a
false statement to a bankruptcy judge ex-
aggerating the P. Zaccaro Co.’s role in
managing three huge Manhattan housing
projects. The New York Daily News re-
ported that Zaccaro had managed a build-
ing on behalf of an Orthodox rabbi convict-
ed of swindling a federal food program.
Exasperated, Ferraro told Newsweek
that in its 49 years of operations, the P.
Zaccaro Co. had had literally thousands of
tenants —any of whom might have been
involved in questionable activities that had
nothing to do with her husband, his in-laws
or her vice presidential ambitions.
By late last week many news organiza-
tions had reached the same conclusion,
and Ferraro’s political fortunes seemed
likely to survive intact. But Zaccaro’s trial-
by-media may have done lasting harm.
Zaccaro attorney Murry Kalik speculated

that potential business partners might
“steer clear” of Zaccaro to avoid press
inquiries, and Ferraro said her husband
had not been able to do a full day’s work
since her nomination. Success in New
York real estate often depends on bluff and
bluster —and some family acquaintances
said that Zaccaro had been reluctant to
reveal his holdings all along because he did
not want business associates to know how
small his operation really was.

Zaccaro: Well, it was pressure. And my
wife was going to be hurt by it if I didn’t
give my tax returns —and I decided to do
it. I said, “Listen, I don’t want to hurt you.
I’ll have to do it, regardless of my privacy
and whatever else happens.”
Ferraro: But the pressure certainly
wasn’t from me and it
wasn’t from Fritz Mondale.
It was from the press.
Q. The press?
Zaccaro: We’re talking
about the press because they
were hounding me all week
long in my office.
Ferraro: I mean, it’s just
terrible How much long-
er are we going to be re-
sponding, because with a
business like this, God
knows, you might be re-
sponding on a daily basis.
How much time is going to
focus on that and draw
away from the fact that I’m
the vice presidential candi-
date? How does that go to
my capacity ... to partici-
pate in the government of
this country?
Q. Ms. Ferraro, what was
Vice President Mondale’s
reaction when you told him that your
husband would release his tax returns?
Ferraro: Fritz Mondale is a very fine
man. And Fritz Mondale had said to me,
“The decision is yours and John’s.” Now,
Fritz Mondale had to know that it was
very difficult for us. . . . He knew what
was happening on the national news.... I
knew how he felt. He didn’t have to come
out and tell me.
Q. Did any of his advisers pressure you?
Ferraro: No. They knew what we
were going through. And they knew the
decision had to be John’s. And I want to
tell you something: ... I was confident
that John would do what he did. I mean,
he’s never let me down in 24 years of
marriage. So no one had to say any-
thing—l knew.
Q. Was there ever a point when that
confidence in him grew at all shaky?
Ferraro: No. You know, the one thing
about our marriage is that I totally respect
him.. . . John’s a very emotionally secure
person—and financially secure, too. So
he’s able to be mature about where I’m
going and what I’m doing, and he’s able to
handle it. ... Not too many husbands
could put up with all this stuff all the time.
But I knew where he was coming from
and we’ve never had a problem.
Q. How do you react to George Bush’s
crack that you claim to be Edith and
Archie Bunker, but your assets are more
like Pam and A verell Harriman’s?
At home in Forest Hills: ‘Why are they doing this to Daddy and to you?’
JACQUES M. CHENET— Newsweek
Ferraro: I love Pamela and Averell
Harriman. If I were in that category, I
would say, “I don’t know how much I
really have, either. I’ve never seen the tax
returns.” But they’re wonderful people—
and that’s the American dream. We’ve
done OK. We’ve worked hard. We’ve
earned it. We’ve paid our fair share of
taxes.. . . And I want my kids to grow up
the same way, doing that as well. But let
me tell you about Edith and Pam. Whoev-
er George Bush thinks I am —whether it’s
Edith or Pam or Geraldine —one of us
would like to debate him.
Q. What was the worst part of this
ordeal?
Ferraro: The worst part is watching
my family and what it’s doing to them.
My husband is a fine, decent man. And I
ache for him. I can’t tell you what it has
been like for him because he is private, he
is good. His mother called up on the
phone last night and was crying. [My
mother also called.] I said, “Just keep
praying.” She said to me, “I’m afraid God
isn’t listening to my prayers anymore.”
.. .My girls [were] saying, “Why are they
doing this to Daddy and to you?” That’s
the toughest part.
Q. Do you think it’s over?
Ferraro: ... A lot depends on what the
media decides to do. John’s in a business
where they can find a building or a lease or
something to write a story about every
day. I mean, how do you protect yourself,
your kids, from that? That’s the worst
part. I have to tell you: I’m capable of
getting through it. I felt badly about the
effect it was having on the
campaign. But we’re tough.
Just my family, I feel badly
for. And it’s because of me
that they’re suffering.
Q. What are the political
pluses and minuses?
Ferraro: Someone said
to me, “This is terrific.” I
said, “If you’re going to tell
me it builds character, for-
get it.” My mother used to
tell me that when I was
little. I don’t believe it for
one minute. The political
pluses are perhaps two: one
is that the American public
has had the opportunity to
see everything there is to
see about me. They’re go-
ing to be judging me, I
think, by a slightly higher
standard than they have
others. ... I think the
American public will be
satisfied. Secondly, I think
the other plus is that it did give me an
opportunity to show the American pub-
lic that this member of Congress—this
“Edith,” as my friend George Bush
would say—[has] got the character and
the guts to stand up and take charge
when I have to.
Q. And the minuses?
Ferraro: The negatives are, as men-
tioned in the press conference, that so
much attention is focused on this that it
took attention away from a really, really
marvelous [campaign] trip.. . . And, sec-
ondly, another negative is the effect upon
my family.. . . And the third thing, quite
frankly, is that I’ve caused Fritz Mon-
dale, who is the most wonderful of human
beings, I’m sure a great deal of anxiety.
And for that, I’m sorry.

U.S. Tribal Politics
A Democrat looks at the importance of a party’s roots.
By BEN J. WATTENBERG
I was 11 years old during the election of
1944, growing up in the Bronx —and I never
saw a Tom Dewey for President button.
But, as the old people in my neighborhood
said in Yiddish, “afem velt, yenam velt, und
Roosevelt” —this world, the next world, we
were all for Franklin Roosevelt, and we
would be for him, and his party, forever. It
wasn’t only Jews who would be Democrats
forever. It was blacks, ethnic Roman Cath-
olics, Southern good ole boys—and all the
rest of the fabled “FDR Coalition.”
To be sure, there were also important
issues involved: a federal government that
helped out, an internationalist foreign poli-
cy. But beneath it all was —I hesitate to use
the word —tribalism. Tribes are self-con-
tained cultures, bands of brothers and sis-
ters speaking the same language. In politics,
it was our tribe versus their tribe, outsiders
versus insiders, plain people versus elitists,
little guys versus fat cats. Tom Dewey was
the exemplar of the Republican tribe. A
smile seemed to require an act of will.
Squeaky clean, he always looked as if he
were arriving at the country-club dance
with the banker’s daughter. Not fair, you
say? Of course not. But Democrats won
elections on the basis of that sort of image.
The GOP, the party of homespun Abe Lin-
coln, had developed a tribal problem.
‘Happy Days’: It’s a long way from the
sidewalks of the Bronx in 1944 to Dallas in
1984. In the ensuing years, the Republicans
have embraced internationalism. They
have —most of them —sort of accepted the
welfare state. But they still have some prob-
lems, tribewise. They know it, and it was
good fun to watch them in Dallas
put their convention podium to
work on it. See the rabbi intone
the benediction. See the Hispanic
keynote speaker. See the black
football player. See the Vietnam-
ese girl recite the Pledge of Alle-
giance. See all the women. Listen
to the strains of “Happy Days Are
Here Again,” the Democratic
theme song.
Whatever happened to Tom
Dewey? Squeaky clean, his spirit
marches on among most of the
Dallas delegates. They are very
nice people: freshly starched, all
combed out, every hair in place,
coats and ties, nice dresses, in their
seats when they’re supposed to be.
No, thank you, sir, I have enough
insurance. Doesn’t anybody here
talk with his hands? Do they
sweat? Argue? They are not Dem-
ocrats, for sure.
If you didn’t know that, go to
Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum fashion
show, assembled by Sakowitz of Houston.
The models are mostly wives of GOP offi-
cials and legislators. The clothes dazzle, not
exactly homespun: Halston, Valentino,
Adolfo, in deep, rich colors. Here’s a suit for
Republican workers: “very feminine, yet
very executive,” the announcer says.
Oops—and here’s a jacket made of python
and sable. Among the bicoastal knits and
the pale pink hacking jackets, there’s a
Schlafly campaign button: “Pro-family,
Pro-woman, Pro-Reagan, Pro-High Fron-
tier.” Star wars at a fashion show! Other
parties feature the crown prince of squeaky
clean, Pat Boone, and the Rev. Jerry Fal-
well, carefully coiffed even atop Nelson
Bunker Hunt’s saddle-broken bull.
Politics is issues and substance —and
tribe and culture, too. At times when Dem-
ocrats desert their own best issues, the
Squeaky Cleans can win the support of the
earthier tribes. But the Republicans are
after more this time —they want Demo-
crats’ hearts as well as their minds. Only
that can bring them the long-term political
realignment they seek. Ronald Reagan isn’t
Tom Dewey. Imagine a Republican presi-
dent with a sense of humor! Sensing a
window of Democratic vulnerability—
which may be closing as Walter Mondale
tries to move his party toward the center of
the spectrum —the Republicans are trying
to move out of the country club.
Jack Kemp understands something that
it took the Squeaky Cleans a while to figure
out. If the tribe won’t come to the Republi-
cans, take the Republicans to the tribe.
Kemp calls himself a populist, and is quick
to say that the antonym of populist is elitist.
Falwell rides the bull: ‘A long way from the Bronx sidewalks’
Scene on the floor: ‘Out of the country club’
He talks with his hands. So does Congress-
man Newt Gingrich of the Conservative
Opportunity Society. They are sort of neo-
ethnic Protestants; they like to argue. They
know ideas are the currency of the new
media politics, and the keys to lure the lost
tribes. Listening to Kemp talk, it’s clear that
some of his populism is linked to solid con-
servative activist constituencies: prayer in
school, anti-abortion. But most of his thrust
is directed at the little guys and the plain
people. Kemp pitches black leaders on ur-
ban enterprise zones, doesn’t beat up on
unions, doesn’t stress cutting government
spending or even cutting government.
Battleground: Above all, he is an apostle
of more and still more economic growth. To
Kemp, growth is magic. It avoids putting
Republicans in the trap that Mario Cuomo
has set for them: social Darwinism. A vigor-
ously growing economy doesn’t screw the
Democratic little guy, and that’s who Kemp
wants to capture for the Republicans. Many
economists say his tax-cutting
arithmetic is straight from the fun-
ny farm. But politicians ultimately
yield to arithmetic if they have to.
In the meanwhile, Kemp’s heart is
in the right place to bring the Re-
publicans to the battleground of
tribal politics.
When they get there, they will
find Democrats attempting to re-
claim a proprietary interest in the
politics of the little guy. As they
might have said in the old neigh-
borhood: so what’s wrong in a
democracy for both parties to go
after the little guy?
Wattenberg is chairman of the
Coalition for a Democratic Majori-
ty and author of the forthcoming
book “The Good News Is the Bad
News Is Wrong. ” He advised
Democratic tribal leaders Lyndon
B. Johnson, Hubert Humphrey
and Henry Jackson.


Reagan’s Roaring Start
The candidates respond to their party’s ovation after their acceptance speeches: As one presidential confidant putit, ‘lf we come out of here with a
After a clockwork convention, he plans to play tough—and to play everywhere.
It was the video presidency gone expo-
nential. After finishing her plea to “make it
one more for the Gipper,” Nancy Reagan
stood on the podium and waved to the image
of her husband on a huge screen above her.
Millions of television watchers viewed the
president, sitting in a hotel room, viewing his
wife view him view her with the delegates,
who in turn viewed it all —except the com-
mercials. Ronald Reagan could be excused
for not immediately waving back through
the endless layers of images. When he did, it
was as if a circuit suddenly connected
throughout the convention center and tele-
vision audience. The 1984 Republican Na-
tional Convention had become an electronic
hall of mirrors. It was theperfect synthesis of
Reagan’s larger-than-life affability and mas-
tery of his medium —the very qualities that
may make him unbeatable this fall.
The moment was painstakingly planned
—like everything else at the Dallas conven-
tion. “Spontaneous” floor demonstrations
turned out to be as carefully choreographed
as the rangerettes who high-kicked in the
aisles. The orchestration of press contacts
was so thorough that important GOP lead-
ers were sent printed “themes” each day and
asked to spew forth the party line of the
moment in all interviews. Every convention
speech except Sen. Barry Goldwater’s was
fully vetted by Reagan campaign officials;
even the clothes worn on the podium were
checked beforehand for taste and color. Lef-
tover balloons floating near the ceil-
ing were removed—by air-rifle-toting
marksmen.
Script: Politically, there was little to shoot
over. The conservative wing of the GOP
controlled every detail. While Rep. Jack
Kemp and Sen. Robert Dole watched plac-
ards bearing their names fill the hall, Sen.
Howard Baker, a relative moderate, found
that the Reagan-run print shop in the con-
vention-hall basement wouldn’t make any
signs for his supporters—it wasn’t in the
script. Even the presidential suite featured
stage directions. After Missouri put the tick-
et over the top, a cameraman for the Repub-
lican National Committee, noticing insuffi-
cient emotion among the candidates and
their wives gathered in the hotel suite, yelled,
“Wave at the camera. Let’s have a big smile.
Be happy!” A reporter chimed in: “Doesn’t
anybody feel like kissing anybody?” The
Reagans quickly obliged.
But for all the contrivances, the conven-
tion also produced huge, genuine enthusi-
asm—and with good reason. Some political
analysts now believe that Ronald Reagan
will not just win, but score one of the biggest
victories ever. The message passed last week
within the GOP was to go for a knockout.
Mondale-bashing and reruns of the 1980
election began in earnest. Everything else —
from the New Right platform and the battle
to win congressional seats, to the future
of the party in 1988 and beyond—took a
back seat. “Ronald Reagan has one obliga


solid 10>point lead [in the polls], it’s all over’
BEN WEAVER— CAMERA 5
tion to the Republican Party,” says senior
Reagan strategist Stuart Spencer, “and
that’s to win.”
The current game plan for “America’s
Party,” as Reagan now calls the GOP,
sounds like something out of a Dallas Cow-
boys chalk talk: play tough, play everywhere
(including the industrial Northeast, Mon-
dale’s turf) and keep running the ball against
big, bad Washington—even though the star
now lives there. That the Cowboys have lost
some football games in recent years doesn’t
seem to faze the president’s advisers. “If we
come out of here with a solid 10-point lead
[in the polls],” exulted one confident Reagan
confidant, “it’s all over.” While publicly
heeding Reagan’s warning that the election
will not be a cakewalk, the private view in the
Reagan camp is that it may soon turn into
just that.
Blood: There are a few blips on the radar,
but Reagan advisers believe they are easy-
enough to control. One is overconfidence,
which the campaign has taken pains to
avoid. Another is interest rates, which may
rise, but probably not high enough to cause
serious harm to the president. Then there are
the two or three debates Reagan will have to
hold with Mondale. (The campaign simply
won’t agree to any more than that.) The
Democratic challenger is a skilled debater
and could draw blood. But Reagan aides do
not believe he could annihilate the president.
Similarly, they cannot imagine a gaffe that
would cost them more than a few percentage
points. Reagan has bounced back in the polls
from his open-mike joke about the Russians,
and aides are convinced they have the “mad
bomber” image problem under control.
About the only major worry left is a bad case
of presidential flu —“an October disease,”
as some Republicans call it.
Given his wide lead, Reagan has some
choice about just how ideological a cam-
paign he wants to run. White House aides
report that the original draft of his accept-
ance speech was even tougher than the one
he delivered. The president is said to have
been so agitated by the Democratic conven-
tion that the speech took on a more combat-
ive tone than some aides
thought wise. Searching
for just the right mix of
principles and appeals to
Democrats and undecid-
eds, Reagan spent more
time on the speech than
on any since his Inau-
gural Address. “He con-
siders this speech his
political valedictory,”
explained speechwriter
Kenneth Khachigian.
If the speech was a pre-
view of what Reagan will
use in the campaign this
fall, voters won’t learn
many of the president’s
specific plans for a
second term. Amid wild
cheering, he defended
his record and expound-
ed vintage Reaganisms
about little schoolgirls
and the Olympic torch.
But the main point of the
speech was a bald effort
to label the Democrats as
irresponsible, unpatriot-
ic and afraid of the fu-
ture. They live “in the
past,” he said. The Re-
publicans, by contrast,
are the party of “hope,
confidence and growth.”
Grenada: Some of the
blows Reagan landed in
his acceptance speech
had a cheekiness Mon-
dale can only envy. “We
could say [Democrats]
spend like drunken sail-
ors,” the president dead-
panned to the delegates.
“But that would be
unfair to drunken sail-
ors.” Reagan, of course,
has himself sent deficit
spending soaring. At an-
other point, the president seemed to cross
out of bounds when he noted caustically that
“Democratic candidates have suggested
that [the invasion of Grenada] be likened to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the
crushing of human rights in Poland or the
genocide in Cambodia.” In truth, Walter
Mondale, the implied target of that philip-
pic, dallied in his reaction to the Grenada
invasion but never made such comparisons.
Reagan’s convention audience was strict-
ly white bread —97 percent white, to be
exact. The handful of blacks wore pinstripes
and looked at ease among their well-
scrubbed, pray-and-golf fellow delegates.
For a party that 100 years ago boasted a
black temporary convention chairman (well
after the end of Reconstruction), the figure
rankled —though not enough for anything
to be done about it. Hispanics fared better at

qDelegates on the final night: ‘One obligation—and that’s to win’


the convention —in part because the GOP
hopes to win as much as a third of the
Hispanic vote. Katherine Ortega, who holds
the largely ceremonial job of treasurer of the
United States, delivered the keynote ad-
dress. While her speech did not compare in
candlepower to New York Gov. Mario Cuo-
mo’s in San Francisco, her choice proved
again the campaign’s flair for the symbolic.
The convention’s other major speeches
didn’t match the rhetorical heights of San
Francisco, either —although United Na-
tions Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick’s im-
age of Democrats as acting like an “ostrich”
with “its head in the sand” came close.
Kirkpatrick’s professorial defense of the
Reagan administration’s foreign policy took
aim at those who “blame America first”
when aggression takes place around the
world. Ironically, several speakers who fol-
lowed Kirkpatrick did just that —blaming
the Carter administration for foreign ag-

gression. The incon-
sistency was little no-
ticed, in part because
many speakers and
delegates at this con-
vention do not view
Carter and Mondale
as part of their Amer-
ica in the first place.
Echo: Sen. Barry
Goldwater is clearly
of that mind. As he
took the podium amid
a wave of nostalgic
cheers for his unsuc-
cessful 1964 presiden-
tial campaign, his
choice was an echo —
of himself. “And let me remind you,” Gold-
water said, partly repeating his famous line
of 20 years ago, “extremism in the defense
of liberty is no vice.” Goldwater went on to
haul out an old but hardy GOP campaign
charge: that “every war in this century began
and was fought under Democratic adminis-
trations.” Former President Gerald Ford —
who, with his wife, Betty, won warm cheers

from the crowd —ripped into Carter,
the man who defeated him in 1976.
The younger crowd at the convention
took heart from firebrand Republicans so
conservative that they are happy to be
known as “radicals.” Led by Reps. Newt
Gingrich and Vin Weber, their most promi-
nent candidate for 1988 is Kemp but their
real meal tickets are ideas —and the muscle
to push them. They took over the platform
committee, ramming through a document
so close to the fringe that many Republi-
cans —including Senator Dole —felt obliged
to condemn it. The president’s own daugh-
ter, Maureen, voted against it. Reagan’s
chief of staff, James Baker, says Reagan will
run on his record —not the platform—
though he is “comfortable” with the docu-
ment. Many other Republicans hope it goes
the way of most party platforms—into the
wastebasket.
For those paying attention to official
GOP doctrine, the “opportunity society”
program, as Gingrich calls it, features a
curious mix of policies that simultaneously
slash the government’s authority over the
economy and greatly expand its authority
over private life. The platform recommends
a return to the gold standard, denounces the
Federal Reserve Board, advocates school
prayer, ignores the equal-rights amendment
and insists that all judicial appointees be
opposed to abortion. Gingrich says he ex-
pects Reagan to start pushing the conserva-
tive agenda immediately following his sec-
ond Inaugural. Even if he doesn’t, come
1988, conservative delegates will almost cer-
tainly continue to greatly outnumber mod-
erates. This year’s moderates practically
could have fit into Reagan’s vest pocket,
Movie: But they don’t seem too bitter
about it. Even Mary Louise Smith, who was
forced out as chairman of the Republican
National Committee in 1977, remains com-
mitted to the president. “Now they need
[women] more than ever,” Smith says. In the
end, not one of the party leaders who object-
ed to the platform voted against Reagan’s
renomination. His “leadership” of the na-
tion made any doubts evaporate. Now that

quite a name for ourselves.
PafthawayHlH
In 1969,Lindemans
discovered a potential new
wine growing district near
the small rural town of
Padthaway, 80km north
of Coonawarra, in the
cool south east of South
Australia.
The soil was rich and
red. The climate ideal.
Lindemans chose to use this new district
to produce some very special wines.
Exotic varietals.
Wine styles many Australians wouldn't
even hear about for another ten years.
From 1981, Lindemans' foresight paid off
with wines that took the Wine Shows by storm.
Padthaway wines have since won a Special
Trophy and a staggering
39 Gold, 36 Silver and 41
Bronze medals.
The 1982 Pinot Noir
has outstanding full varietal
aroma and flavour, enhanced
by its maturation in oak.
Already a Gold Medal
winner, it has excellent cellar-
ing potential.

Republican Women
Maureen Reagan on the convention floor: ‘lt’s OK to be Republican and ignore this platform’
They were more visible —and divided —than ever.
Her humor bounded from bedroom to
birthing room, from Dolly Parton’s body
to Jane Fonda’s sex life. By the time Joan
Rivers had finished her routine, not a ta-
boo was left untouched. She even managed
a joke about John Kennedy’s life in the city
of his death: “It’s no big deal to have a
woman in the White House. John F. Ken-
nedy had a thousand of them.” And Rivers
didn’t spare her audience. “I don’t do
housework,” she told nearly 2,000 mostly
middle-aged GOP women at a luncheon
honoring First Lady Nancy Reagan.
“That’s the fun of being a Republican.”
The fun of being a Republi-
can woman in Dallas was that
the party was finally paying at-
tention —or at least putting its
women on display. They were
paraded to the podium for
speeches, organized into new
national groups, named to
Reagan-Bush campaign posi-
tions and generally showcased
as the GOP answer to Geral-
dine Ferraro. “This Republi-
can Party has a record of wom-
en’s involvement that is not
rhetoric, but historic,” said
Health and Human Services
Secretary Margaret Heckler.
Still, many of the Republican
women delegates were less
than happy with their party.
Despite the GOP’s attempts to
portray the convention as a
lovefest, divisions among its women were
deep—and visible.
The women were divided even about
comedienne Rivers, who was invited to
entertain them because Nancy Reagan is a
fan. Though she called her routine “mild,”
about half the audience responded to the
ribald humor with stony silence. Illinois
delegate Kathleen Sullivan said she was
“livid . . . disgusted” following the per-
formance. But that was perhaps the only
time all week that the GOP’s burgeoning
group of conservative women delegates,
many of them handpicked by the party

hierarchy, found anything to be
distressed about.
By contrast, moderates were
frequently angered by the right
wing’s hegemony. Like moderate
men, they lost every one of
their platform battles —including
a struggle for any mention of an
equal rights amendment. And
they were not appeased by either
the public prominence of women
speakers (including U.N. Ambas-
sador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who is
nominally a Democrat) or the
conspicuous increase in the num-
ber of women at the convention
(44 percent of all delegates). For-
mer Republican National Com-
mittee Cochairman Mary Crisp
said the GOP’s attentions to wom-
en were “strictly cosmetic ... al-
most insulting. This administra-
tion has made the gender gap a
gulf, and they’re trying to com-
pensate for what they know is a
real problem.”
Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum
declined a starring role in the proceedings
because she didn’t want to be just one of
“the baubles” in the carefully orchestrated
show. Susan Catania, a delegate from a
largely black Chicago district, was the only
woman who refused to vote for Reagan’s
renomination. Catania, a mother of seven
who lives in a middle-income housing proj-
ect, said, “If more delegates lived in places
like [mine], we’d have a different kind of
platform.” Though many women congratu-
lated Catania on her stand, she said, “I
guess they’re not unhappy enough to make a
fuss.” First Daughter Maureen Reagan,
who advises her father on women’s issues,
was a notable exception. She denounced the
platform as “very exclusionary” and spent
much of her time on intraparty diplomacy.
“It’s OK to be Republican and ignore this
platform,” she counseled fellow moderates.
Clout: But those moderates
who are still committed to the
GOP may have to ignore future
platforms also. A Los Angeles
Times survey showed many
more women delegates ap-
proved of the Moral Majority
(46 percent) than of the Nation-
al Organization for Women (21
percent), and more wanted a
constitutional amendment pro-
hibiting abortion (34 percent)
than supported the ERA (29
percent). With the party now
set on a rightward course, its
Phyllis Schlaflys appear des-
tined to be far happier—and to
have far more clout—than its
Maureen Reagans.

Did the Military Kill Aquino?
The Agrava Commission studies evidence that strongly suggests a conspiracy.
The disenchanted hit the streets of Ma-
nila again last week, nearly a million of
them. On the first anniversary of the assassi-
nation of opposition leader Benigno (Ninoy)
Aquino, the protesters were unconvinced by
the government’s account of his death.
Crowds cheered a skit that parodied the
government-appointed commission investi-
gating the slaying. In the burlesque, a sim-
pering actress playing First Lady Imelda
Marcos was fawned on by the ‘‘commission
chairwoman,” while actors depicting
Aquino’s “military escorts” killed him and
then testified that they “hadn’t been look-
ing” when Ninoy was shot. It was gallows
humor —but to more and more Filipinos, the
satire played all too true.
The commission, headed by former ap-
peals court Judge Corazon Agrava, prom-
ised to issue its findings in September and
despite widespread fears of a whitewash, its
conclusions may not be all that bland.
Newsweek has learned that the board was
studying evidence that may strongly suggest
Aquino was shot by military conspirators,
Sources close to the investigation report that
the commission is paying particular atten-
tion to the five-man airport security force
that escorted Aquino off a plane from the
United States. Four of the escorts were test-
edforevidenceofpowderburns.Thetestson
two men—Sgt. Arnulfo de Mesa and consta-
ble Rogelio Moreno—proved positive, al-
though they maintained that they had prac-
ticed target shooting the day before Aquino
was slain.
The sources say that investigators are
even more interested in the fifth man, intelli-
gence agent Filomeno Miranda. According
to testimony, he was never tested for powder
burns because he was not authorized to carry
a gun. Some military men were reluctant to
testify that he had been with Aquino at all,
but other witnesses said that the agent joined
the party at the last minute. He was the only
escort known to be wearing a polo barong, a
common Philippine shirt. Sources close to
the board say private testimony suggests a
man in a polo barong shot Aquino. Miranda
denies any wrongdoing in connection with
the Aquino murder.
Any suggestion of military complicity
would contradict the government’s view
that Aquino was slain by Rolando Galman,
a lone hit man. There was no confirmation
that the panel would name names or suggest
how high in the government an alleged con-
spiracy might reach. Ninoy’s brother, Aga-
pito (Butz) Aquino, predicted that the re-
port would be a “graywash. The board
might state it was a military conspiracy on a
limited scale.” Still, even a restricted find-
ing would rock the beleaguered government
of President Ferdinand Marcos, and, said
one commission lawyer, require “one hel-
luva lot of guts.”
Wild Applause: The demonstrators were
clearly demanding hard answers. Multi-
tudes of middle-class protesters —business-
men, housewives, children, doctors, law-
yers and society matrons —marched along-
side militant labor unionists, farmers and
Marching through Manila to commemorate Aquino’s death: Demands for hard answers from thousands and thousands


A witness testifies before the investigating board, Butz Aquino with his slain brother's statue: Even a ‘graywash ’ would take guts
students. The main demonstration began
at the airport, where people burst into wild
applause as a bronze statue of Aquino was
flown in from abroad. (Marcos personally
waived $5,000 in customs duties on the
sculpture.) Then, with the statue at the
front of their procession, the marchers
wended their way to downtown Rizal
Park, where they heard speakers ranging
from strident leftists to Aquino’s widow
Corazon and several opposition members
of the National Assembly.
Military and police officials had done
their utmost to limit the extent of the activi-
ties, or to prevent them altogether. Anti-riot
forces broke up several marches during the
preceding weeks and officials had argued
before the supreme court that communist
infiltrators would wreak havoc if massive
demonstrations were permitted on August
21. But surprisingly, the court overruled the
police and granted a rally per-
mit for the anniversary—in ex-
change for protest leaders’
promises that demonstrations
would remain peaceful.
Barricades: After that the
government went out of its way
to avoid a confrontation. Mar-
cos ordered security forces
back to the barracks. And
though marines barricaded the
gates to Malacanang Palace
and lurked around other gov-
ernment buildings, residents
were left with the impression
that the regime had simply ab-
dicated the streets.
Probably for that very rea-
son, the ceremonies were al-
most entirely peaceful. It may
also have helped that the princi-
pal speakers were preaching
nonviolence. At a morning
mass in remembrance of Aqui-
no, tens of thousands of demon-
strators gathered in and around Santo Do-
mingo church to hear Cardinal Jaime Sin.
He urged Filipinos to reconcile “with those
who killed, with those who pillaged, with
those who assaulted”—and then he called
on the Marcos government to forgive “the
political offender, the dissident, and
the exile.”
Opposition politician Salvador Laurel jet-
tisoned his prepared address on Aquino’s
murder and instead called for cooperation
“between the red and the yellow”—the radi-
cals and the moderate critics of Marcos who
have rallied around the yellow banner that
has become Aquino’s symbol. “Unity with
the left is unity for the cause for which Ninoy
died,” stated Laurel. “If the left wants to join
us in that, it’s okay.”
Above all, the one question that ob-
sessed the crowd was whether Aquino’s
killers would be brought to justice. The
The First Couple: The Agrava report could shake the regime
SYGMA
demonstrators found original ways to ex-
press their contempt for the official ac-
count of the murder. In one somewhat
bizarre tableau, the chubby 11-year-old
son of Rolando Galman joined the anni-
versary march wearing a shirt with simu-
lated bloodstains and a sign around his
neck that said, “Fall Guy.”
Chronology of Murder: The findings of
the commission might well bear out the
idea on the sign. The conspiracy theory
may be supported by apparent inaccura-
cies in the testimony of military men, a
carefully derived chronology of the mur-
der—and the secret testimony of a witness
who was so frightened that he had to
interrupt the questioning to retch. Sources
close to the investigation confided that the
commission’s own lawyers have written
memos recommending saying the evidence
indicates a military conspiracy.
The commission’s most pro-
vocative public evidence is a
chronology assembled from
photos and tapes of the killing.
General Counsel Andres Nar-
vasa examined some 150 pho-
tographs, giving each one a
time sequence on the basis of
factors such as the amount of
blood under Aquino’s head or
the progress of a soldier’s cap
as it tumbles to the ground.
Narvasa then matched those
pictures with a sound se-
quence culled from journal-
ists’ tapes. According to the
sequence, when they left the
plane, Aquino and his escorts
turned down a utility stairway
leading to the tarmac and a
security van parked about five
meters away. A shot rang out
about nine seconds after
Aquino’s exit; four more shots

Washington Walks the Line
Clark Air Base: A devastated economy and a surging guerrilla war raise qthe specters of Vietnam and Nicaragua
For the United States, it is an all-too-familiar scenario: an
autocratic ally is plagued by massive protests, a devastated
economy and a surging guerrilla war. That is precisely what is
happening to President Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. As
opposition to Marcos builds week by week, the Reagan adminis-
tration has been forced to try to strike an increasingly delicate
balance between propping up an aging ruler and pressing him to
relax authoritarian rule. “We can’t push so hard,” says one
senior Washington official, “that we destabilize the government
and bring about chaos.”
It took the assassination of Benigno Aquino to jar Washing-
ton from its once uncritical embrace of the Marcos regime. To
the surprise of many observers, the Reagan administration
quickly joined the chorus of those calling
for an impartial investigation of the kill-
ing. State Department officials began
holding talks with Filipino opposition
leaders. President Reagan himself can-
celed a state visit to Manila, and sudden-
ly American relations with the Philip-
pines seemed to have a new set of rules.
Tailspin: Aquino’s assassination also
sent the economy into a tailspin and trig-
gered widespread civil unrest. During the
past year the Philippine peso has lost 40
percent of its value, and unemployment
has skyrocketed to 30 percent. A stream
of public protests has prompted the coun-
try’s moneyed classes to send as much as
$4 billion overseas. And as mass demon-
strations swept the cities, the leftist New
People’s Army (NPA) began to maneu-
ver more boldly through the countryside.
Against that backdrop, some analysts
fear that Washington’s initiatives were
too little and too late. “When Marcos and
his cronies were milking the country dry,
our diplomats danced at Malacanang
Palace,” says a veteran U.S. official in
A sub at Subic Bay: U.S. stakes are high

bringing about genuine reform.”
Most American officials would reject
that assessment. They point to last May’s National Assembly
elections as one event that opened up the political process and
gave at least some reason to hope for a peaceful transition from
Marcos’s authoritarian rule. Washington also points to the
investigation of Aquino’s murder by the independent Agrava
Commission as an encouraging sign—though it is awaiting the
commission’s findings with some sense of concern.
If anything has spurred Washington’s reassessment, it is the
NPA insurgency. A year ago many American analysts shared the
Marcos regime’s view that the guerrillas posed little threat to the
government. But now U.S. officials acknowledge that the rebels
are a genuine threat. “The insurgency is a very serious problem
indeed,” U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Stephen W. Bos-
worth told Newsweek last week. The
U. S. stake is high. Two key facilities in the
Philippines —the naval base at Subic Bay
and the Clark Air Base—are the only
secure American military installations
between Japan and the Indian Ocean.
The cost of replacing them has been esti-
mated as high as $ 1 billion.
limit: The United States does have a
few cards to play. The most obvious are
its aid packages to the Marcos govern-
ment, including $ 1 billion in trade credits
and a $2OO million loan over the past year
alone. In a carrot-and-stick gesture, $ 180
million in aid has been tied up in the U.S.
Congress by critics of Marcos’s human-
rights record. But there may be a limit to
how strongly Washington can wield its
influence. “The Americans know that if
we do not get the help we need, Marcos
may be toppled,” says a senior Philippine
official. That is the one thing Washington
would like to prevent.

Taking technology
(c
r


me step at a time.
Technology is just another word for tools.
A ladder and a silicon memory chip are equally
elegant illustrations of what that means. They allow people
to do work that might otherwise be beyond their reach.
IBM is in the business of improving tools (though we
do spend more time on memory chips than on ladders).
Our million-bit chip has the largest capacity ever
produced on an existing manufacturing line. We
developed disk and tape drives for transferring data at a
record rate of three million characters per second. The
electronic packaging in our largest computers is the
densest in the industry.
That IBM can claim these individual accomplishments
is really not the point. New records are set all the
time in our industry and we expect to continue setting
them ourselves.
But there is a message in them.
It’s a message about a company’s resolve and its
ability to recognize what kinds of tools you need.
Resolve means having the right people and giving
them the right kind of support.
Resolve also means committing to the tough business
of technology: exploring promising but uncertain ideas,
pursuing flashes of insight but never straying from
the certain rewards of improving tools one step at a time.
Recognizing the kinds of tools you need means
understanding the kind of work you do. That’s true whether
our tools serve you, your company or your country.
If you’re looking for a company that will provide the
technology you need when you need it, you can look at the
records we’ve set today.
But you might also look at the IBM record itself. It’s
an unparalleled display of the tools you’ve needed.

followed, and Aquino and Galman were
next photographed lying on the tarmac.
The Narvasa chronology differed mark-
edly from the testimony of military wit-
nesses. According to the consistent account
of the military men, Aquino hadjust reached
the tarmac when the alleged assassin Gal-
man shot Aquino at close range in the back of
the head. And at that point, according to the
military’s story, Sgt. Rolando de Guzman
emerged from the security van, shot Galman
in the head and then pumped six more bullets
into the body as Aquino’s escorts scrambled
for cover. Other soldiers then emerged from
the van and began shooting, filling what was
left of Galman with lead.
Discrepancies: But the board’s chronolo-
gy reveals something very different. Ac-
cording to Narvasa, for some time after the
first five shots were fired there was no one
on the tarmac “anywhere within a radius
of several meters around the [security]
van.” It was not until approximately 17
seconds after the initial shots —a long time
in an emergency—that a group of soldiers
came out of the van to pump approximate-
ly 20 shots into Galman’s fallen body. And
there were other discrepancies in the mili-
tary testimony: “Earlier pictures prove
Galman was already prostrate on the
ground even before de Guzman emerged
from the van,” said Narvasa. According to
one source close to the investigation, the
military’s uniform insistence on its ver-
sion-—despite physical evidence to the con-
trary —convinced the board’s lawyers that
there was a conspiracy among the soldiers.
There were also indications that Aquino
may have been shot before he reached the
tarmac: a re-enactment suggests the first
shot rang out before he reached the bottom
of the stairs. If so, Aquino was slain while he
was supposedly alone with his military es-
cort. Two civilian security guards testified
Sin at mass, cheers for the arrival of the Aquino statue: Preaching forgiveness
Corazon Aquino addressing the protesters: Calls for a more unified opposition
that they saw Aquino slump on the staircase
and, according to his widow, one witness
saw Aquino receive a blow at about the time
the first shot was fired.
Disappearance: If the board does con-
clude there was a conspiracy, there is no
telling how high it might point its finger.
Certainly the names of prominent military
officials have been mentioned in public tes-
timony. The name of armed forces Chief of
Staff" Fabian Ver popped up in testimony
when the 16-year-old daughter of Galman’s
common-law wife said her mother had told
her she was going to see the general just
before she mysteriously disappeared. Ver
denied the charge. Another officer named
in the testimony is Brig. Gen. Luther Custo-
dio, the chief of airport security. A self-
described professional hit man told the
board that Custodio had asked him to kill
Aquino—and said that Custodio had told
him that the orders came from Ver. Custo-
dio denied the whole story.
It remains to be seen how much the
board’s formal report will say —and the in-
quiry remains open to additional evidence.
“Agrava would probably like to support the
government theory,” said Raul Gonzales,
head of the National Bar Association in the
Philippines and until July an officially accre-
dited observer to the hearings, “but she
might be overwhelmed by the evidence. I
think there is overwhelming evidence that
Galman didn’t do it.” But even if the panel
does issue a damning report, it is simply a
fact-finding body. Any move to prosecute
would have to be made by the military itself.
“The follow-up, whatever it is, is up to Mar-
cos and only Marcos,” insisted one of the
board’s lawyers. But that may not be entirely
accurate. Last week’s demonstrators were in
no mood for easy answers. If the investiga-
tion into Ninoy’s murder ends in what is
perceived as a whitewash, the dissidence will
only grow more intense.
HARRY ANDERSON with MELINDA LIU and
RICHARD VOKEY in Manila


WORLD BUSINESS
Keeping the Banks Afloat
A growing U.S. economy will not cure all the ills of a bruised and battered system.
Thanks to brisk economic growth, rising
profits, low inflation and other rosy
indicators, 1984 has in many ways seemed
the best of times. So why has this year
brought 65 failures among financial institu-
tions, more than any year in recent histo-
ry —not to mention a run on large deposits
at the country’s biggest thrift, American
Savings, and the forced “nationalization” of
giant Continental Illinois? It’s a daunting
question with a score of possible answers —
BOB CONRAD
and one that is spurring intense debate
among legislators, regulators and bankers.
In turn, that discussion has raised another
profound question: how can the nation in-
sure that its banking system stays sound?
The issue is one of paramount impor-
tance. A healthy banking system is the
lifeblood of the economy; without it, contin-
ued growth would be impossible. But many
banking experts are growing increasingly
worried that major structural problems in
the system are simply not being addressed.
The problem isn’t that financial deregula-
tion has gone too far, many maintain; rath-
er, it’s that with deregulation well under
way, there aren’t enough incentives to en-
courage wise banking practices. Some argue
that the network of regulatory agencies is
too antiquated and unwieldy. Others con-
tend that the industry has too little capital
and is too insulated from the penalties of
excessive risk. There isn’t wide agreement
on how to remedy the problems, but there
are now serious proposals for change.
The reasons for the banking system’s re-
cent failures are almost as varied as the bank
buildings that dot America. Recognizing
the inevitable contraction under way in the
industry, regulators have lately allowed
many small, troubled institutions to fail.
This has obliged the government to pay off
depositors at a cost of hundreds of millions of
dollars (chart). The Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation is estimated to have com-
mitted over a quarter of its $16.5 billion in
reserves to bail out Continental—victim of a
run when large investors lost faith that it
could survive huge losses on bad loans,
There is just one “common thread” in these
instances, says FDIC chairman William
Isaac: each was “a poorly managed bank.”
Part of the problem is that it’s getting
easier to be a poor bank manager.
The freedom that banks now
have to pay any price for deposits
has sparked unparalleled compe-
tition and high, volatile costs for
funds. With their powers to in-
vest those funds still largely re-
stricted to making loans, many
banks have stuffed their books
with lower-quality loans. Ameri-
can Savings, owned by Finan-
cial Corp. of America (FCA),
headed by brash Charles Knapp,
has sought to play other risky
games—gambling in part that it
could “match” fluctuating, high-
interest deposits by writing bil-
lions of dollars of fixed-rate
mortgages, then selling many of
these loans off and servicing
them for a fee. That would have
worked if interest rates had fall-
en, but their continued high level
has caused the strategy to falter.
‘Gap and Overlap 5 : But if man-
agers have trouble playing by the
new rules, regulators may have it
even worse. The six federal and
50 state agencies charged with
overseeing the financial system
are plagued by chronic problems
of “gap and overlap,” says Rich-
ard Pratt, a Merrill Lynch exec-
utive and former chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. Many of the agencies
seem understaffed: the Comp-
troller of the Currency, which
regulates national banks, has
only 2,200 examiners to oversee
4,700 institutions. And because the turn-
over rate among examiners is high, much
of the watchdog role necessarily falls to
relatively inexperienced staffers. H. Joe
Selby, the comptroller’s senior deputy for
bank supervision, says that few of the
agency’s examiners would have had the
confidence to challenge the risky energy
loans made by Continental —especially
amid the hoopla about the bank’s bril


liance that pervaded the late 19705. “That’s
not an excuse” for poor regulation, says
Selby, “but that’s a fact.”
The difficulties caused by “overlap” are
equally severe. A single financial institution
may have to answer to as many as five
different agencies, and one agency may
serve as the watchdog for five different types
of institutions. Inevitably, conflicts over
bank practices arise. Vincent Tese, New
York State’s banking superintendent, cites
instances where state-chartered banks re-
gulated by his department got one set of
instructions if they were also regulated by
the comptroller and another if they were
regulated by the FDIC. Faced with differ-
ent demands, some institutions go “forum-
shopping”—changing their charters to
come under the aegis of the most lenient
agency. Many banks simply get lost in the
shuffle. Andrew Carron, a former Brook-
ings Institution economist now with Shear-
son Lehman/American Express, thinks
regulatory “balkanization” is the main rea-
son the Tennessee-based banks owned by
Jake and C. H. Butcher got into trouble and
eventually failed.
To redress some of these problems, a
commission chaired by Vice President
George Bush earlier this year recommend-
ed overhauling the existing regulatory net-
work. Under its proposals, which could be
submitted as legislation to Congress next
year, the comptroller’s office would be re-
placed by a new Federal Banking Agency.
The FBA would regulate all national banks
and all but the 50 largest bank-holding com-
panies, which in turn would still be overseen
by the federal Reserve. The FDIC would
abandon all regulatory responsibilities un-
related to deposit insurance, while any secu-
rities activities that banks got into would be
monitored by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Those proposals represent some im-
provement over the current system, but
many banking experts argue that the banks
are plagued by problems that no amount of
more vigilant oversight can correct. Among
the remedies they envision:
■ A Need for New Capital. Economist Alan
Greenspan argues that a central problem
for the industry is that its assets are mainly
long-term, its deposits are mainly short-
term —and it has inadequate capital (main-
ly shareholders’ equity and retained earn-
ings) to guard against the disasters that
could result. Recognizing this, regulators
have recently moved to require some banks
to increase capital as a percentage of overall
assets. Isaac of the FDIC thinks capital
requirements should be raised to as high as
9 percent of total assets from the current
average for commercial banks of 5.5 per-
cent. But Robert Albertson, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., doubts
that such a change would make much differ-
ence: no amount of increased capital, he
says, would have stemmed the run on Conti-
nental Illinois once depositors made up
their minds that the bank was finished.

■ A Better System of Deposit Insurance.
Many banking experts argue that for the
federal government to insure deposits up to
$lOO,OO0 —and frequently to bail out still
larger depositors, as in the case of Continen-
tal —encourages banks to take undue risks
with depositors’ funds. Some have suggest-
ed revamping the system to impose “market
discipline” on the banks. One proposal
would compel institutions to pay the federal
government different rates for deposit in-
surance based on their level of capital or the
quality of their assets; another would
exempt the first 1 to 2 percent of a deposi-
tor’s assets from insurance coverage. Insti-
tutions taking big risks would thus incur
some financial penalty, while depositors
Sign for American Savings: Lifeblood
would be forced to be more watchful of bank
policy. But Harvard Business School Prof.
Samuel L. Hayes 111 argues that removing
full insurance coverage from small deposits
would sharply undermine confidence in the
banking system. “We still are not that far
away from the 19305,” he says. And Tim
Campbell, professor of finance at the Uni-
versity of Southern California, maintains
that many institutions —especially thrifts—
would quickly go broke paying premiums
pegged to their level of risk.
■ More Disclosure of Information. Many
regulators believe that confidence in the
banking system could be increased by forc-
ing banks to disclose more detail about their
business. Last year the SEC demanded that
publicly owned bank-holding companies
reveal more information about the health of
foreign loans, and the FDIC recently asked
banks to divulge more detail in their quar-
terly reports to the agency. But the federal
agencies have encountered some opposition
from the Office of Management and Budg-
et. Charged with overseeing the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, the OMB has de-
nied some of the requests for information on
the ground that they will increase red tape.
None of these proposals represents a
panacea for the industry, and given the
problems inherent in implementing them, it
is unlikely many of them will ever be en-
acted. At best, Campbell of USC expects an
evolution toward new methods of regula-
tion: “We’re going to see one problem af-
ter another, they’ll be managed one after
another and gradually the system will
change,” he says. Meanwhile, last Friday,
the tiny Hereford State Bank of Hereford,
Colo., became the 65th financial institution
to fail in 1984. The FDIC paid off $2.5
million in deposits—and a tiny piece of the
banking system died.

EUROPE
Putting the Chill on a Thaw
BOSSU— SYGMA
East Germans arrive in West Germany, Glemp, Honecker: A mini-detente —and grumbling from the Soviets about ‘revanchism ’
Moscow’s heavy-handed pressure may be creating new cracks in the East bloc.
In Czestochowa two weeks ago, Polish
Cardinal Jozef Glemp was preaching to a
crowd of2oo,ooopeople, many of them car-
rying Solidarity banners. The people had
expected the cardinal to talk about the out-
lawed union. Instead, Glemp delivered an
odd sermon about Poland’s ethnic Germans,
some of whom, he suggested, were unpatri-
otic people who refused to regard themselves
as Poles. He told of an elderly woman whom
he had met on a visit to West Germany; she
had begged him to save Poland’s German
minority from “ injustice. ” His reply, he told
the congregation, was, “What Germans?. . .
What injustice?”
The surprise sermon evoked a painful
chapter in the history of Eastern Eu-
rope: Adolf Hitler had used the alleged
persecution of German minorities in Po-
land and Czechoslovakia as one of his pre-
texts for invading those countries at the
outset of World War 11. But Glemp was
probably not simply flogging old memories.
More likely the cardinal was looking for a
quick way to please the communist authori-
ties in Warsaw and ease the strains on his
church. The Germans were a convenient
target. The Polish government has joined a
Soviet propaganda campaign against the
mini-detente that East and West Germany
are presently conducting on their own ini-
tiative. The result is that Polish citizens are
suddenly hearing much more loose rhetoric
about Germans, German history and Ger-
man dreams of reunification.
The Soviet campaign is overtly aimed at
the Bonn government, which Russian pub-
lications are now accusing of “revanch-
ism”—a desire to reclaim Germany’s lost
territories. The latest Soviet cartoons depict
West German leaders goose-stepping in
Nazi uniforms. But the unnamed target of
the propaganda is Erich Honecker, the East
German party leader who was once regard-
ed as the most loyal of all of Moscow’s
satellite chieftains. Now, for economic and
political reasons, Honecker is bucking the
Kremlin by cultivating trade and other ties
with Bonn. He tentatively plans to visit
West Germany this month; if he makes the
trip, it would be the first time that an East
German Communist Party chief crossed
the border, and Moscow is unhappy about
it. By whipping up anti-German feeling, the
Soviets are evidently trying to turn up the
heat on Honecker in an obvious bid to talk
him out of the trip.
The heavy-handed pressure may be
backfiring and reinforcing divisions within
the East bloc. In Hungary last week, an
official statement backed the German-
German detente as being “in the interest of
all Europeans.” In Bulgaria, party leader
Todor Zhivkov has scheduled a visit of his
own to West Germany, despite Soviet mis-
givings about trips to the land of so-called
revanchism. In Bucharest, President Nico-
lae Ceausescu last week found a character-
istically original way to twit Moscow; as
Romania celebrated the 40th anniversary
of its liberation from the Nazis, the festivi-
ties deliberately downplayed the Soviet
role in the liberation. The Soviets had
anticipated that sort of ceremony and had
tried to convince East-bloc leaders not to
attend—but Honecker defiantly showed
up. And he and Ceausescu lauded each


other for maintaining a dialogue with the
West during a period of rising tensions
between the superpowers.
That left the Poles and the Czechs press-
ing the Kremlin’s revanchism issue. Both of
those countries harbor old and abiding an-
tagonisms toward Germany. Beyond that,
officials in Warsaw say they are genuinely
worried that a thaw in German-German
relations might one day lead to a German
effort to reclaim territories that were ceded
to Poland by the Allied powers at the end of
World War 11. That may sound farfetched.
But Polish officials point to such right-wing
West German officials as Interior Minister
Friedrich Zimmermann, who, they say,
makes no secret of his interest in reopening
the question of the lost lands.
Homelands: The issue is kept alive in
West Germany by the 2 million-member
Federation of Expellees, which looks after
the interests of Germans who were forced
by the Russians to leave their Eastern
European homelands after the war. Her-
bert Czaja, the federation’s president and a
Christian Democratic member of the Bun-
destag, told Newsweek that he continues
to think of western Poland as “the German
east provinces.” The federation focuses on
the “plight” of 1.25 million ethnic Ger-
mans who it claims now live in Poland.
One out of every six of these people, the
federation says, wants to emigrate to West
Germany.
The fate of the ethnic Germans in Poland
is one subject that Moscow could hardly
care about. The Soviets are only fanning
fears of German reunification because they
are afraid that West Germany might gradu-
ally seduce East Germany away from the
Warsaw Pact. Interestingly, there seem to
be two factions in the Kremlin at the mo-
Children of ethnic Germans expelled from Poland after the war: Painful memories
ment and two divergent views on German
policy. One group, supposedly led by For-
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko, is said to
consist of hard-liners who opppose the Ger-
man mini-detente. Gromyko’s group uses
Pravda as its mouthpiece; the Moscow daily
recently denounced a $333 million West
German bank loan to East Berlin as a means
of tying East Germany to Western “eco-
nomic levers.” The second group, said to be
headed by party chief Konstantin Cher-
nenko, takes a more lenient approach.
Chernenko’s faction uses IzVestia as its
outlet; that newspaper recently argued that
there was nothing wrong with the West
German loan.
For now, even the Gromyko hard-lin-
ers —who seem to have the upper hand—
must be puzzled by the problem of how to
deal with Honecker. If Moscow does force
him to cancel his trip, that will upset the
normally quiescent East Germans. It may
also result in further outbursts of disloyalty
toward the Soviets from the Romanians and
Hungarians.
New discord in Eastern Europe is the last
thing the Kremlin needs. But the alternative
is for Moscow to stand back and watch
while East Germany, for the first time in
four decades, steers its own foreign-policy
course. Few observers in the East or West
think that such a course will lead to German
reunification any time soon. But it might
well inaugurate a new period of cooperation
between Eastern and Western European
states —with Moscow glowering from the
sidelines.
KIM ROGAL with MAKS WESTERMAN in Bonn
A KGB Home Movie
The 20-minute videotape was shot with a telephoto lens, and
its quality ranged from watery color to fuzzy black and white.
But there was no mistaking the propaganda show’s unwitting
stars last week: Soviet dissidents Andrei Sakharov and his wife,
Yelena Bonner. Opening like a travelogue, the tape served up a
hydrofoil skimming the Volga into Gorky, then focused on an
apartment building on Gagarin Prospekt. A healthy-looking
Sakharov leaned out of a ground-floor window to talk to some-
body. A narrator explained that the
Sakharovs live on 800 rubles ($960) a
month. More images of everyday life:
Sakharov planting a sapling, Bonner
tanking up their car and shopping, Sa-
kharov eating a bowl of soup and glanc-
ing at a July issue of Newsweek.
With that tawdry little documen-
tary, the Kremlin hoped to dispel ru-
mors that Sakharov was still on a hun-
ger strike and in frail health. Russian
journalist Victor Louis, a sometime
salesman for the KGB, gave the cas-
sette to the West German tabloid Bild
Sakharov, Chernenko: Where are they now?
YANKELEVICH— SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
REGIS BOSSU— SYGMA
Zeitung—which sold it to ABC News for screening in the United
States. The montage was a home movie cooked up by the KGB:
it nearly always showed Sakharov and Bonner apart, and most of
the natural sound had been deleted. After viewing the tape,
Sakharov’s son-in-law Efrem Yankelevich said, “What hfcve
they done to him? He looks many years older.” The State
Department, meanwhile, said it had a report that Bonner had
been sentenced to five years’ internal exile for “slandering the
Soviet state.” It said its fears for the couple would not be stilled
“until reliable observers are allowed to meet with them.”
If Sakharov was on tape, Konstantin Chernenko was nowhere
to be seen. The Soviet leader left Mos-
cow for his Black Sea retreat on July 15.
Since then his only public statements
have been letters to Irish peace activist
Sean Macßride and to a mayor in Eng-
land. By one account, Chernenko, 72,
entered a Moscow hospital for a mild
heart ailment early this month. Long
absences by Soviet leaders are not un-
usual. But if Chernenko fails to make
an appearance this week to close the
Kremlin’s Friendship ’B4 games, some
very familiar alarms will start buzzing
around Moscow again.


SOVIET UNION
World Records, But Few Fans
Moscow really hasn’t caught the in-
tended spirit of the Friendship ’B4
Games. Yes, colorful banners line the
city’s streets, and Soviet television is giving
extensive coverage to the action. But Lenin
Stadium and the sites of the swimming and
cycling events have been half empty since
the opening ceremonies, de-
spite ticket prices of less than
$l. Even some of the events
have fallen a little flat. Last
week all of the preliminary
heats in the women’s rowing
competition and five of the
eight heats in the men’s events
were canceled because so few
teams were participating that
none had to be eliminated be-
fore the finals.
Mismatches: So far, the level
of competition at the games—
which are taking place in sev-
en countries besides the Soviet
Union —has been mixed. In
track and field, women ath-
letes bettered Olympic gold-
medal performances in 12 of
17 events, including a world-
record throw of 240 feet 8
inches in the discus by East
German Irina Meszynski. The
men, however, managed to
beat the top Los Angeles mark
in only 8 of 24 events and set
no world records. Soviet cy-
clists broke three world bests,
and in the swimming races,
Eastern-bloc athletes toppled
another five world records,
one by Russian Sergei Zabo-
lotnov and four by East Ger-
man women: the 400-meter
free-style-relay and medley-re-
lay teams, Ina Kleber in the
100-meter backstroke leg of
the medley relay and 15-year-
old 100-meter breast stroker
Sylvia Gerasch. In Gerasch’s
race, the three top finishers all
swam faster than the Olympic
gold medalist Petra Van Sta-
veren of the Netherlands.
But in other events, the top
performers were poorly tested.
Soviet swimmer Vladimir Sal-
nikov finished 30 seconds
ahead of one paddling Syrian
in a qualifying heat of the 400-
meter freestyle. The reason for
such mismatches is obvious.
Just 29 nations, fewer than ex-
pected, are represented, and
many of them have sent only a
few athletes—in some cases
those who had failed to make
their own Olympic teams.
Because of the thin field,
Soviet and East German athletes have had
little trouble dominating the games (to-
gether they have won all 19 swimming
events). At times they seem to be compet-
ing less against the men and women along-
side them than against their absent foes
from the United States and the 143 other
Zabolotnov (top), discus champ Meszynski: Thin field
countries who participated in the L.A.
Olympics. Few can question that the ath-
letes both in Moscow and Los Angeles
would have preferred to compete against
each other. “It’s sports, so why not partici-
pate,” says Joseph Sacre, who leads the
10-member Lebanese team taking part in
the Friendship Games. Undeniably, the
world’s athletes feel that way; unfortunate-
ly, for them, politics has interfered. It takes
little imagination to comprehend the loss.
“If they had participated in Los Angeles,”
said Sacre with a wistful smile, “it would
have been a beautiful match.”
WILLIAM BURGER with DEBBIE SEWARD in Moscow
BRITAIN
A Brush With Nukes
In the Falklands War?
At the early stages of the Falklands war,
Margaret Thatcher may have been even
tougher than anyone thought. In London
last week, the left-wing New Statesman re-
ported that Thatcher’s government consid-
ered nuking Argentina. The magazine said
that Britain deployed a Polaris nuclear sub-
marine to the South Atlantic and contem-
plated “a threatened or demonstration nu-
clear attack” on the Argentine city of
Cordoba with the submarine’s missiles.
According to the article —based on
leaked government documents —Thatch-
er’s cabinet ordered the Polaris deployment
after the sinking of HMS Sheffield. They
reportedly considered using the nuclear op-
tion if the Argentines destroyed any of Brit-
ain’s principal ships. Thatcher, on vacation
in Switzerland, refused to comment on the
charges. But members of her naval staff
have adamantly denied them. “We did not
contemplate a nuclear attack,” said Admi-
ral of the Fleet Sir Henry Leach, who was
chief of naval staff during the conflict.
“[We] did not make any even potentially
preparatory moves for such action.”
The New Statesman also said that the
Argentine cruiser General Belgrano—
which was outside Britain’s 200-mile exclu-
sion zone around the Falklands —was head-
ing home when it was sunk by a British
torpedo. Thatcher has said that the ship was
“not sailing away” from the islands when it
was hit. But the New Statesman printed an
unsent letter from Defense Secretary Mi-
chael Heseltine to a Labor M.P., acknowl-
edging that the ship had reversed course.
Taking the Belgrano case even further,
the article claimed that three days before the
ship went down, Thatcher ordered the sink-
ing of the Argentine aircraft carrier Veinti-
cinco de Mayo. After the Royal Navy was
unable to find its target, Thatcher’s cabinet
authorized a strike on the Belgrano. The
Belgrano issue has been simmering for two
years, but the new evidence stoked it to a
rollingboil. Labor and Liberal M.P.’s imme-
diately called for a full investigation, which
is likely to spark lively debate when Parlia-
ment reconvenes in October.

ARCHITECTURE
Reaching for the Sky
When the Communists took power in
China in 1949, one of their first acts in
neighboring Hong Kong was to install a
flagpole with their red-star standard atop
the local Bank of China offices. That made
the building just a shade taller than the
nearby headquarters of the decidedly capi-
talist, British-run Hongkong & Shanghai
Bank. Three years ago the rivalry was re-
newed when “The Bank,” as everyone
knows it, began construction of a new, 47-
story building. Now, however, it appears
that Peking has decided to reach for the sky.
Last week American architect I. M. Pei
unveiled his model for a new Bank of China
headquarters—a 70-story tower that will be
the tallest building in Asia. The project is a
homecoming for the Canton-born Pei. In the
1920 s his father was the first manager of the
Chinese central bank’s Hong Kong office. “I
am not keen to travel,” says Pei, “but this
is a project I had to take on. ”
Pei has given the Chinese bank—and
Hong Kong’s architecturally undistin-
guished business district—one of his most
innovative designs. A two-story granite base
will house the main business area. Above
this will soar a central column supporting
the building’s four sections, each a different
height. Pei’s extensive use of diagonal steel
trusses will distribute the building’s weight
to its corners, leaving the interior virtually
free of columns to allow greater flexibility in
laying out the interior space. But the new
structure will not be merely functional: the
main business area, for example, is to be
topped by a 15-stdry atrium.
Pei’s intention was to provide a symbol of
China’s drive toward modernization. When
he was planning the building, Pei clearly had
in mind one of China’s next big international
steps: the assumption of control over Hong
Kong when the British lease on the colony
runs out in 1997. “Hong Kong is very impor-
tant not only to the world, but to China as
well,” he says. “China must come out of its
shell, and the only way to do it is to use Hong
Kong to say,‘We’re ready.’ ”
Despite the flights of design fancy, the
building is solidly practical. Its interlocking
sections will help it withstand winds up to
150 miles per hour, an important consider-
ation during Hong Kong’s typhoon season.
The Bank of China gave Pei no design pre-
conditions, but he did have to work within
the constraints of a modest $l2B million
budget. Even so, the architect sees a good
chance of coming in under budget for the
2 million-square-foot building. In a city
where, as Pei put it, “money is almost king,”
that would be no small accomplishment.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Sewing Enters the Age of Computers
The sewing machine, a fixture of
domestic life for more than a cen-
tury, is going high tech. Companies in
Europe, Japan and the United States
are integrating microchips, program-
mable memories and even synthe-
sized voice response in machines that
can store scores of programmed stitch
patterns, memorize an embroidered
design and still sew on a loose button.
Perhaps the most sophisticated of
the new models is the Memory Craft
6000, manufactured by the New
Home Sewing Machine Co. of Carl-
stadt, N.J. It features 147 prepro-
grammed stitches and patterns that
an operator selects by pushing a button or punching in a
corresponding number. The machine can sew block and script
letters for monograms, names or complete sentences and store
sequences for repetitive work. It can do intricate embroidery
that would otherwise have to be done by hand and can enlarge,
shrink or produce mirror images of embroidered patterns. The
machine also can be programmed to sew individually designed
patterns made up of combinations of the standard stitches. New
Home, a subsidiary of the Janome Sewing Machine Co., Ltd., of
Japan, sells the Memory Craft 6000 for $ 1,429.
A similar new machine, the model 980 from Husqvarna AB
of Sweden, uses flat cassettes that select stitches and patterns
from the machine’s memory. The cassettes, which fit into a slot
in the machine, contain the instructions for more than 100
stitches. The machine can be programmed to reproduce cus-
The Husqvarna 980: A stitch in no time
tom-designed stitches, as well as se-
quences of up to 52 letters and num-
bers. The model 980, which retails for
$ 1,500, will also automatically set the
best combination of stitch, stitch
length and thread tension for a par-
ticular type of fabric.
Although it is best known for its
high-tech typewriters, Brother Indus-
tries of Japan will soon introduce a
sewing machine that informs users
audibly if they make a mistake. Broth-
er’s Compal Galaxie has 10 synthe-
sized voice warnings, similar to those
now found on some automobiles and
cameras, that tell the operator when
the memory is full, when a sequence of stitches is entered
incorrectly or when a particular pattern cannot be sewn in
reverse. But the most innovative feature of the machine is its
ability to memorize and reproduce whole sewing patterns
designed by the user. To do this, a design is plotted on special
graph paper and its coordinates fed into the machine’s memory,
after which the pattern can be sewn automatically. Like the
New Home machine, Brother’s model has programmed stitch-
es numbered for easy recall. When it is introduced this autumn,
the Compal Galaxie is expected to sell for $B4O. *
What’s next? New Home plans one day to make its sewing
machines compatible with home computers. That would allow
custom programs for complex patterns and stitches to be stored
on a floppy disc, checked on the computer’s monitor and then
sewn by the machine.
Look Ma, No Telephone!
Companies often have problems com-
municating with employees working
away from the office. The effectiveness of
pagers and portable computers depends
on ready access to a telephone. Now,
Motorola, Inc., one of America’s largest
electronics companies, has developed a
portable, two-way communications sys-
tem that can transmit data and messages
throughout a metropolitan area,
independent of any phone link.
The key element in Motorola’s
PCX Portable Data Communica-
tions System are the battery-
powered, hand-held terminals that
communicate with the home office
or dispatching center via radio
waves. Each terminal has a two-
line, 27-character liquid-crystal
display to read incoming messages
and a full keyboard to type in out-
going information. The device
beeps when there is a message,
which can either be read immedi-
ately or stored for later retrieval. A
person with a terminal can also alert the
sender that the message can’t be taken at
that time and should be sent later or
passed on to another person in the field.
The transmission range is 7 to 15
miles, depending on terrain, but a net-
work of relay stations allows the system
to cover far larger areas. Special access
codes and different frequencies also al-
low several companies in the same city to
use Motorola systems without interfer-
Motorola terminal: Communicating by radio wave
ence. A city-wide system, which can cost
upwards of $165,000, can support more
than a thousand remote terminals, each
priced at about $3,000.
So far, the only company using the
Motorola system is IBM. The computer
manufacturer began using it last spring
for its service departments in Chicago
and Los Angeles and plans to install it in
300 other U.S. cities. Today 360 IBM
customer-service representatives in Los
Angeles and 507 others in Chicago
use their terminals to communi-
cate with dispatchers, locate need-
ed parts and ask advice from other
service representatives. Also, all
repairs and parts orders are fed
automatically into a computer
and relayed to IBM’s central serv-
ice center in Colorado. When the
system is in place nationwide, it
will allow the company to detect
chronic breakdowns or part de-
fects more quickly and take steps
to correct them.

In Australia too, Bosch
Fuel Injection travels in
the best of companies.
Now, two of Australia’s leading car
manufacturers offer you the luxury and
efficiency of Bosch Fuel Injection in
their latest 6 cylinder models.
Over 30 years ago, Bosch
Fuel Injection was introduced
to Australia in imported
cars. Today, it’s no longer a
novelty, but <r vital high
technology-feature of every
sophisticated high performance car.
In addition to Ford and GMH, there are
currently over 21 European and Japanese
vehicle manufacturers offering Bosch Fuel Injection.
In fact, every car with fuel injection on Australian roads
has either a Bosch made or Bosch licensed Fuel Injection
System under the bonnet.
When you drive a car equipped with Bosch Fuel Injection, you’ll

experience a surge of power you usually expect only from a much
bigger engine. When you check the fuel gauge, you’ll discover fuel
economy you perhaps didn’t think possible in a 6 cylinder car. And,
you’ll warm to its instant start (no matter what the weather),
and recognise the low exhaust emission factor (very
environmentally conscious).
The sophisticated Bosch LE Jetronic
Fuel Injection system in the latest
Australian cars has been custom
designed for each, in close
collaboration with Ford and
GMH design engineers. A fine
blend of German design and
Australian enterprise.
No matter which you choose,
each car has its own distinctive
strengths. But there’s a happy
consensus on one point close to our
hearts - Bosch Fuel Injection Systems.
The name for the best in German design
and Australian enterprise.

THE BULLETIN
NEIGHBORHOOD
The Red challenge in the Pacific
and the American response
The Soviet build-up in the Asia-Pacific region is disturbing the United States.
FEDOR MEDIANSKY outlines how the two superpowers are jockeying for
supremacy in a region which is assuming increasing importance in the world.
SENIOR MEMBERS of the United
States’ Reagan administration have be-
come increasingly alarmed by the build-
up of Soviet military power in the Asia-
Pacific region. US Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Defence James Kelly has
told congress that the Soviet strength
“for the first time poses a significant di-
rect conventional threat to US forces,
territory and lines of communication”
and, consequently, “our Pacific friends
and allies must now weigh the benefits
of co-operation with us against the real
risks of thereby becoming Soviet tar-
gets.”
Competition between the two super-
powers and the relentless drive for stra-
tegic advantage is intensifying pressure
on the countries of the Pacific region.
One example is the pressure on Japan to
expand its military capabilities against
Soviet forces in the Pacific.
? At the same time, the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
capitals are finding themselves visited
more frequently by US officials than
was the case a few years ago.
Even more remote countries such as
Australia and New Zealand are being
drawn in. Canberra has been subjected
to Soviet pressure over the hosting of
US bases while the new Lange Govern-
ment in New Zealand is finding Wash-
ington uncharacteristically inflexible on
the question of visits from nuclear ships
of the US navy.
The growth of Soviet military power
represents one of the major regional
military build-ups of recent times. The
Pacific fleet, with headquarters in
Vladivostok, has emerged as the largest
in the Soviet navy. It has about one-
third of Soviet submarines and a little
under one-third of the navy’s manpower
and surface combatants. In addition,
the Soviet Pacific fleet now has about 27
percent of the navy’s aircraft.
Recently, the modernisation of
Soviet forces in Asia has proceeded at
about the same rate as that of forces on
the European front a clear reflection
Soviet seapower: the 43,000-tonne carrier Minsk heads south past Japan
of the importance now attached to the
Asia-Pacific region. Modernisation has
moved in tandem with expansion. The
Pacific fleet has been transformed from
a largely coastal force into a blue-water
navy. At the same time, deployments on
the disputed islands in the Japanese
chain have been strengthened and fa-
cilities have been established in Viet-
nam, South Yemen and Ethiopia.
While the US concern with Soviet
military expansion is quite recent, Mos-
cow has been building its forces in the
region over the past 20 years. The build-
up began as a result of Soviet concern
over China. The USSR has also, with in-
creasing self-assurance, taken advan-
tage of strategic opportunities which
often were not of Moscow’s making
for example, the Sino-Vietnam conflict.
Since 1978, Soviet naval expansion
has been more qualitative than quanti-
tative. The US fleet commander in the
Pacific, Admiral Sylvester Foley, said
recently that while in the past the Soviet
Pacific fleet has got “the leftovers and
cast-offs from other fleets, today it gets
the most modern ships.” The fleet now
has two of the Soviet navy’s four Kiev
class carriers. The number of major sur-
face ships has gone from 64 to 84.
Soviet long-range aircraft in East
Asia include 70 Backfire bombers with a
combat radius of 5500 kilometres. Forty
of these are used as long-range strike
aircraft and 30 are used by naval avi-
ation in an anti-shipping role. In ad-
dition, there are also the older and
slower TU-95 Bears with a greater com-
bat radius.
According to US Assistant Defence
Secretary Richard Armitage, the US is
expecting the most advanced strike air-
craft, the Blackjack, to be introduced
into the region “over the next several
years.” These aircraft would improve
Soviet combat capabilities and, accord-
ing to Armitage, would put US forces in
Alaska, Hawaii and the Western Pacific
within range.


One of the most alarming aspects of
the Soviet military build-up in the Pa-
cific is the increasing number of nuclear
weapons being introduced into the re-
gion. The Soviet Union has deployed
more than 100 land-based SS-20 mis-
siles in the eastern USSR. These have a
range that extends to targets as far south
as northern Thailand.
Recent US figures count more than
120 submarines in the Pacific fleet, .31 of
which are classed as “strategic”
meaning they can fire nuclear weapons
from Pacific waters. The latest submar-
ines, the Delta class, reportedly are
stationed to the west of Japan and are
capable of striking the US mainland
even when deployed in Soviet home
waters. The patrol area of the older,
Yankee class submarines includes the
waters off the US west coast, from where
they can reach targets on the western
part of the US mainland.
The build-up of Soviet nuclear
weapons in the Asia-Pacific region has,
according to the 1983 annual report of
US Defence Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, reached the stage where
“the nuclear balance in the region has
. . . shifted in favor of the Soviet
Union.”
The US in turn is responding by
building up its own regional stockpile.
The commander of US forces in the
Pacific (CINCPAC), Admiral William
Crowe, told the Senate last February
that “my highest priority is strategic
modernisation.” William Arkin, direc-
tor of the Arms Race and Nuclear
Weapons Research Project at the Insti-
tute of Policy Studies in Washington,
wrote recently that the “upgrading of
the Pacific Command’s nuclear war-
fighting posture has become a top pri-
ority under the Reagan Adminis-
tration.”
The access to military facilities in
Vietnam is undoubtedly an important
plus for Soviet commanders. The use of
the naval base at Cam Ranh Bay has
expanded since the Vietnamese inva-
sion of Kampuchea. According to
CINCPAC reports, up to 20 Soviet sur-
face ships and four or more submaries
can be found at Cam Ranh “on any
given day.”
Naval long-range Bear aircraft have
been deployed in Vietnam since 1979.
These aircraft conduct intelligence and
anti-submarine missions. According to
Crowe, over the past year “ground sup-
port facilities were developed for a
much larger aircraft presence ... in late
November early December, the
Soviets began deploying Badger aircraft
to Cam Ranh. Currently, about nine
bombers are stationed there.”
The facilities in Vietnam provide
valuable but limited support for the
Soviet Pacific fleet when its vessels are
far from home ports. Cam Ranh and
other ports in Vietnam provide modest
repair facilities and the opportunity for
rest and replenishment.
A sophisticated electronic intelli-
gence and communications complex
also has been established at Cam Ranh.
The facility is among the largest outside
the Soviet Union. Its main tasks are to
monitor US military communications to
Clarke air base and the Subic naval base
in the Philippines, as well as trans-
missions from these to the US fleet and
to the Diego Garcia base in the Indian
Ocean.
According to Crowe, Soviet power
projection in the Pacific and Indian
Oceans is capable of putting “in jeop-
ardy” all of the West’s main sea lines of
communication. In addition, Soviet nu-
clear weapons “can reach any point in
Asia; while specific Asian-oriented
theatre nuclear forces include SS-20s
and Backfire bombers.”
Through Soviet military capabilities
have grown enormously, many limita-
tions persist. Geography continues to


hamper operations in the Asia-Pacific
region. The home ports of the Pacific
fleet are subject to arctic conditions
which hamper naval and air operations
in winter.
Vessels from fleet headquarters at
Vladivostok must pass through one of
three narrow waterways which can be
interdicted by Western forces operating
from Japan. When moving from the Pa-
cific to the Indian Ocean, Soviet naval
vessels must move through the Malacca
or other straits controlled by Indonesia
which, along with the rest of ASEAN, is
hardly hospitable to the Soviet navy.
Distance is another major problem.
Ships leaving Vladivostok must travel
more than 3200 kilometres mostly
through unfriendly waters before
reaching hospitable conditions in Viet-
nam.
The operational capabilities of the
Pacific fleet also are hampered by the
limited ability to project power ashore;
by limited capabilities to provide ad-
equate air cover for naval units and by
the need for units to trail a long logistic
tail. In short, the Pacific fleet is essen-
tially a peacetime navy with
limited capabilities for con-
ducting sustained operations
when it is deployed far from
its home ports.
The poor logistical support
for Soviet ships has not
escaped US commanders in
the Pacific; according to the
previous US Commander-in-
Chief, Admiral Robert Long,
the US Pacific command does
not “credit them with a large
supply of ammunition. It
might seem they are oriented
toward a one-punch affair.”
By contrast, he noted that the
support for Soviet ground and
air forces was much better.
While the Soviet Union is
trying increasingly to convert
its military posture into politi-
cal leverage in the Asia-Pa-
cific region, its ability to do so
remains limited.
For its part, the Reagan
Administration is enthusiastic
about the Pacific. Earlier this
month, Secretary of State
George Shultz told a Hono-
lulu audience that “to under-
stand the future, you must
understand the Pacific.”
Bright economic prospects,
dynamic allies and friends
and the Soviet military build-
up, together with President
Reagan’s determination to
“re-arm America,” add up to
the driving force behind
Washington’s determination
to regain its supremacy in the
Asia-Pacific region.

US re-armament in the Pacific has
been impressive. Major additions to the
US Pacific forces include the assign-
ment of a new Nimitz class carrier, the
Carl Vinson introduction of the long-
awaited Trident submarine and the con-
tinued addition of Los Angeles class at-
tack submarines; the introduction of
Perry class guided missile frigates;
upgrading of naval fighters on aircraft
carriers; and the planned introduction
of additional fighters F-16 squadrons to
Japan.
Monitoring the other side: the Soviet spy ship Balzam
UPI
By most yardsticks of military
strength numbers, flexibility and sus-
tainability the US maritime power is
comfortably ahead of the Soviet Union
in the region (see table).
What these naval figures show are
two quite different navies in the Pacific.
The Soviet emphasis on attack submar-
ines reflects an anti-shipping or sea de-
nial orientation while the substantial
number of strategic submarines indi-
cates clearly the use of Pacific waters for
the targetting of the major nuclear ad-
versaries China and the US.
The Soviet emphasis on support
ships highlights the logistic problems
that a fleet deprived of on-shore sup-
port would face.
The US navy, on the other hand, is
far better off for shore facilities its
own as well as access to allied ports. The
US emphasis on major combat surface
vessels points to an interest in sea con-
trol capabilities and the drive for naval
superiority.
When ship numbers are converted
into military capabilities, the US lead
becomes unmistakable. According to
Armitage, the US force struc-
ture in the region enables it to
maintain:
■ A continuous air and
naval presence in the Western
Pacific ... with the capability
to project and support a US
presence at Diego Garcia in
the Indian Ocean.
■ Air and naval capability
to meet contingencies beyond
the region ... such as in the
Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea,
East African waters and the
Middle East.
While expansion of US
military power in the region
comes in response to the
Soviet build-up, it cannot be
understood as being simply
that.
Rather, the aim is to re-es-
tablish the superiority that the
US enjoyed after the defeat of
the Japanese navy at the end
of World War II and which it
lost more because of the Viet-
nam disengagement than be-
cause of the Soviet build-up.
There is also the element of
US Pacific commanders
taking full advantage of Presi-
dent Reagan’s policies to “re-
arm America.”
But above all, the build-up
of US regional power reflects
the belief that, as a Pacific na-
tion with great and growing
Pacific interests at the dawn of
the Pacific age, the US should
resume the place it likes best
in the Pacific the centre
stage. □


NEW ZEALAND
Lange popular
but he still
faces problems
David Lange: an approval rating comparable with Bob Hawke’s
JOHN SELKIRK
By lAN TEMPLETON
THE FIRST opinion poll since the gen-
eral election in New Zealand shows
support for the Labor Party up and for
the National Party down. But perhaps
the more interesting point is that, while
56 percent of those polled approved of
the performance of the government,
Prime Minister David Lange gained a
67 percent approval rating.
That runs close to the kind of ratings
Australia’s Bob Hawke has enjoyed
since he was elected. Hawke took office,
however, as a nationally known and
popular figure whereas Lange was rela-
tively inexperienced and an unknown
quantity to some New Zealanders. Yet,
in a few weeks, he has impressed his
compatriots not only with his style of
leadership but also with his enthusiasm
for tackling the country’s problems.
The opinion poll reflected, too, a dis-
enchantment with former prime minis-
ter Sir Robert Muldoon who ruled for a
decade. His approval rating stands at 28
percent while 57 percent disapprove of
his performance.
The danger for Lange is that his ap-
proval rating is so high that the only
direction possible is down.
The government soon is to encounter
the major test on seeking consensus
when it stages the national economic
summit conference. That event is to be
modelled closely on Hawke’s successful
summit in Canberra, even down to
holding it in the parliamentary cham-
ber.
Yet one essential ingredient may be
missing. Where Hawke had in his pock-
et an accord with the trade unions on
wages policy, Lange is still searching for
that understanding. And the omens are
not as bright as he would hope.
The trade unions are restive over
what they see as shrinking pay packets.
They have been unable to negotiate
either wages or conditions since 1982.
They have been constricted first by the
wage freeze of the previous government
and now of the Lange administration,
which says its first priority is assistance
to low-income family groups in the
budget in late October.
In his first major speech, Minister of
Finance Roger Douglas spelled out the
realities: “Our first priority is employ-
ment and the key to this is our inter-
national competitiveness.” He said the
need to improve this competitiveness
ruled out any significant wage increase
“for some considerable time.” Another
wage and price spiral would make any
major improvement in the employment
situation impossible.
Douglas clearly believed that the
unions would recognise that a return to
full employment had to take precedence
over wage increases.
However, not all the unions are
willing to tighten their belts again. They
consider that the devaluation alone en-
titles them to compensation of $l2 to
$l4 a week. Some even suggest that a
rise of $3O a week is needed to recover
ground lost since the previous wage rise.
The Federation of Labor was re-
lieved to be rid of the Muldoon govern-
ment and it has fostered a spirit of co-
operation with the new administration.
It seemed that the FOL would be
prepared to go along with the govern-
ment’s plan to draw up legislation to
reform wage-fixing machinery and pre-
pare for a wage round next year. But the
FOL soon found itself caught in a
pincer. From one side, unions not
affiliated to it demanded action. On the
other, trade unionists were disconcerted
by the praise being lavished on the new
government by big business.
One senior trade union official was
quoted as saying: “When you see every
other sector leader saying what wonder-
ful policies the new Labor government
is following, you have to be a bit
stunned.”
In the wake of the emerging feeling
that the workers were being asked to
pick up the tab, the Prime Minister
launched a series of meetings with
union leaders. He called for more talks
between the government, employers
and unions on wage reform.
Lange also may have sensed that,
without a prior agreement on wages, the
trade unions would go into the summit
conference on the defensive, fearing
that they would be conned.
Clearly, if a sensible prices and in-
comes policy is to be achieved, some
heavy negotiations will be required be-
fore the summit meets for three days"
from September 11. The government’s
dilemma is that without the trade
unions the summit will be a failure. But,
if it concedes even a moderate wage
rise, it risks failure of its economic pol-
icy based on the 20 percent devaluation
which is intended to stimulate invest-
ment and create jobs.
Lange does have some leverage. The
unions desperately want the govern-
ment to repeal the legislation enacted by
the previous government which in-
troduced voluntary unionism. Some
unions are said to have lost up to 40
percent of their dues-paying members.
They could be in dire straits if the Labor
government does not go back to some
form of compulsory unionism.
Because of the tight legislative pro-
gram, it seemed nothing could be done
until next year. By then, some unions
could no longer be financially viable.
The government could offer a higher
legislative priority for that measure,
providing the unions agree to its wage
strategy. The hard issue then for the
union movement would be to decide
whether the financial future of the
unions is more important than an im-
mediate wage rise for their members. □


The snow was painful to look at even
through our tinted glasses.
Ahead and behind, the slalom of marker
poles indicated the unsealed road which Range
Rover’s unique self-levelling suspension
effectively made as smooth as the fresh snow that
covered it.
Though we’d set out for the snow before
dawn, it certainly didn’t feel as though we’d been

sight of snow, and we were looking forward to
coming to grips with it.
Grips being the operative word.
The transition from sealed road to hard-
packed snow was imperceptible.
Due in no small part to the Range Rover’s
all purpose radial tyres which virtually ate up the
mud and snow.
We did stop once, but that was only to extract
one enthusiast who had fitted chains to the rear
wheels of his front-wheel drive car.
Our diff-lock was engaged even before we’d
stopped rolling, so the extraction was completely
painless.
By the time we hit Smiggins, we realised that
this time we were in luck with the snow.
But Guthega with its uncrowded slopes was
our destination. And the day wasn’t getting any
younger.
Having opted for the shorter link-road
(something that pre-Range Rover we’d never
even considered) we turned up the cabin heat and
set off up the mountain.
Then, as we crested the rise, the light started
playing its tricks and the world, as we’d gotten
used to it, ceased to exist.
To all intents and purposes, we could have
been on the moon.

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The recommended shares
in the wake of the budget
Stockbrokers are maintaining their optimism after Paul Keating's financial
statement and they have selected a few promising buys for the prudent investor, as
DA VID HASELHURST reports in this survey of the experts.
STOCKBROKERS of necessity are
perennially optimistic and in the wake
of the latest federal budget that mood
remains largely intact.
A Bulletin ring-around among a
cross-section of brokers revealed a
broad consensus that the budget was
good for the market and particularly for
big business represented by the large
listed companies.
We asked the panel to pick their win-
ning selections for the coming year. The
shares they chose are spread from re-
sources to industrials, with broad em-
phasis on retailing, building and prop-
erty development.
The major direct pluses for business
in the budget are:
■ Companies will be able to offset
losses in wholly-owned subsidiaries
against profits in others, thus reducing
taxable income and improving cash
flows.
■ Depreciation on new non-residen-
tial, income-producing buildings will be
increased from 2.5 percent to 4 percent.
■ The former government’s invest-
ment allowance on new plant and
equipment ordered before June 30,
1985, remains but the present govern-
ment has extended until June 30, 1987,
the date by which plant must be in-
stalled to qualify. This is a significant
plus for projects with long lead times,
such as the Portland aluminium smelter.
■ Money spent on general mining
exploration will be deductible, from last
Wednesday, against income from any
source, whereas formerly it was deduct-
ible only against mining income.
This concession was something of a
surprise and the Treasurer’s one-sen-
tence announcement left questions un-
answered, particularly in relation to
gold exploration expenditure.
Inquiries by the Australian Mining
Industry Council produced the under-
standing that gold exploration expendi-
ture would remain non-deductible while
gold mining income remained tax
exempt. That raises the possibility that
new money raised for exploration will
be earmarked for base metals with any

gold discoveries being incidental to the
stated aims of the enterprise.
CHRIS TRUMBULL, partner in the
Sydney broking firm of Potts West
Trumbull and Co, said: “Initially we
thought the resources market would re-
act quite positively to the business in-
centives, especially the group tax initia-
tive and the decision to make mineral
exploration deductible from any source.
But on receipt of the budget papers
we’re a bit confused as to the extent of
incentive implied in the budget esti-
mates.
“Either we and the market in general
are wrong in our estimate of how much
money would flow into mineral ex-
ploration or the budget planners have
completely misunderstood what they’re
offering the mining industry.”
The budget planners estimate that
the cost to receipts of the mineral ex-
ploration incentive will be nil in 1984-
85 and only $lO million in 1985-86.
As Trumbull points out: “BHP alone
could well choose to divert $2O million
of its $BOO million-plus pre-tax oil earn-
ings to mineral exploration. What about
the rest of the now-profitable oil indus-

try, the cash-generating industrial sector
and high tax-paying individuals?”
Trumbull has three buying recom-
mendations and a sell.
In anticipation that a tax might yet
be introduced on gold mining income
after the forthcoming elections, he
would sell major producers such as Cen-
tral Norseman. If a tax were extended to
gold mining profits, however, he would
expect that gold exploration expendi-
ture would then become deductible
from any income source.
On the other hand, to cover possible
gold price moves he would recommend
positions in the undervalued junior gold
explorers and potential developers. His
pick is Australian Consolidated Min-
erals NL, now capitalised at $l5 million,
with $8 million cash on deposit and
undertaking the development of the
Golden Crown mine and Big Bell open
cut in WA. With no mining income yet,
it has been paying tax on its investment
income. (In 1983, ACM reported a loss
of $417,000 yet paid $329,000.)
Trumbull’s other picks are:
m North Broken Hill, with a sug-
gested entry through buying EZ Indus-
tries’ shares and accepting North’s cur-
rent takeover offer. North BH will ben-
efit from offsetting losses at its Broken
Hill mine and group exploration expen-
diture against profits in its industrial
subsidiaries, such as Associated Pulp
and Paper.
m White Industries, at around $2.15,
is a stock he sees as undervalued. It has
developing coal interests where any in-
itial losses may be offset against its high-
ly profitable building activities.
Jim Dominguez: industrial resource stocks
TOM TOOTELL, equities director at
J. B. Were and Sons, also plumps for di-
versified resource stocks which will ben-
efit from the group tax initiative, such as
CSR, MIM, CRA and again North
Broken Hill. He also suggests Western
Mining could be a candidate to do as
North BH has done and buy non-
mining earnings.
Tootell believes the new tax offset-
ting concession will have considerable
impact on those small mining explora-
tion companies with significant cash re-
serves where interest income can be off-
set against operating losses. Two of his
picks in that category are Aztec Ex-
ploration (with 18.6 c in liquids for every
share issued) and Hunter Resources (14c
a share in liquids).
He suggests, too, that companies
with high industrial income could be at-
tracted to acquiring small mining com-
panies and, conversely, companies with
exploration expenses but no income
will be looking to acquire profitable
non-mining operations.
DENNIS TRICKS, Melbourne con-
sultant to the broking firm of Hattersley
Maxwell Noall and Co and former
chairman of the Australian Associated
Stock Exchanges, also sees further
rationalisation and mergers to take ad-
vantage of consolidating losses against
income.
He sees any benefits to business in
the budget as mainly going to large pub-
lic companies while small business,
where confidence has been eroded by a
plethora of legislative actions over the
past year, goes “slowly down the plug
hole.”
He selects three listed property trusts
which will be enhanced with their future
investments in new non-residential, in-
come-producing property Stockland,
Westfield and General Property Trust
plus International Income Property Inc,
the Lend Lease-managed operation that
invests in shopping centre development
in the United States.
Three industrial stocks he favors are
Castlemaine Tooheys (due for some ben-
efits out of the relaxation of excise on
low alcohol beer), the milling and
baking group Allied Mills and AWA,
electronic equipment maker and oper-
ator of broadcasting and TV stations.
For an assets situation, he likes the Her-
ald and Weekly Times “which looks ter-
ribly cheap if you look at the price tele-
vision stations are fetching today.”
808 ELMSLIE, partner in Valder
Elmslie and Co, sees the budget having a
favorable effect on the market for the
rest of this calendar year but sees
dangerous implications for the medium
term in the continuing budget deficits.
Nevertheless, he picks two industrial
stocks as beneficiaries of the govern-
ment’s business initiatives James
Hardie Industries and Clyde Industries
plus the optical firm OPSM Ltd to
benefit from an uplift in consumer
spending. He favors, too, the National
Australia Bank as the highest yielder
(7.3 percent) among the bank stocks
with benefits still to come from its
merger with the CBC.
RENE RIVKIN, now returned to
£tockbroking in Australia as Rivkin Ltd,
said it was a good budget.
He sees the tax cuts giving some
stimulus to the retail sector where he
fancies Woolworths and David Jones.
His pick as a beneficiary of the group
tax arrangements is Boral Ltd which
also will benefit from the stimulus to
building. Another company with


Tom Tootell: sees impact on small mining explorers resulting
DON McPHEDRAN
growth potential is Humes Ltd which
also could appear vulnerable to take-
over.
JIM DOMINGUEZ, chief executive
of the investment banking firm
Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu Ltd,
favors three diversified industrial-
resource stocks to benefit from the
group taxing arrangements BHP,
CSR and ACI plus the oil and gas
producer Santos Ltd.
Dominguez has sobering words on
the growth of the public sector deficit.
He said: “The conventional wisdom
in the general euphoria which has fol-
lowed the budget is that interest rates
will fall further in 1984-85. Some back-
ing for this view may be derived from
the fact that the money growth target at
8 to 10 percent (hedged in with certain
provisos) seems relatively generous
compared with a non-farm gross dom-
estic product forecast of a nominal 9.5
to 10 percent. Last year nominal GDP
grew at around 13.4 percent and actual
M 3 growth came in at 11.4 percent.
“But, before the bond dealers reach
for the champagne, there is another and
more sinister element in the budget
public sector debt interest.
“The budget papers suggest that total
public sector borrowing requirements
will be some 7 percent of GDP, or $14.4
billion. Total interest payable on those
new borrowings plus all other govern-
ment debt is estimated to be $9.2 billion.
“Converting those figures to market
relativities, it means that for every $lOO
that the public sector borrows this year,
approximately $64 will be required to
do no more than meet the interest bill.”
On recent growth in public sector
borrowings, it would take only two
years before interest payments repre-
sented 100 percent of annual public sec-
tor borrowing requirements. He said:
“This position could be reached even
earlier if there is a reduction in public
sector borrowing, for the interest on
existing debt will not be reduced.
“At a time when ‘structural deficit’
are buzz words around Canberra, one
can only be concerned at this rising
mountain of interest payments.” □
THE MEDIA
Bingoism hits
new heights in
Fleet Street
By ROBERT DARROCH
ONE OF the world’s longest-running
and most bitter battles has flared up
again into overt warfare. It’s the great
Fleet Street Bingo War, a new front and
three new offensives of which have
opened in the past fortnight or so.
The initial shot in the latest cam-
paign, was fired on August 17 by the new
proprietor of the London Daily Mirror,
Robert Maxwell, who has sworn a
financial oath to defeat his hated rivals
in the Street’s 3M trifecta Murdoch
(of the Sun, News Of The World and The
Times ) and Matthews (of the Express,
Star and Sunday Express).
Calling a press conference in the
Mirror Group Newspapers’ headquarters
Maxwell announced Britain’s first real
(his emphasis) £1 million ($1.5 million)
bingo competition.
The irony was not lost on the as-
sembly. Since Matthews’ newly-
launched Star introduced bingo a few
years back to boost its fledgling circula-
tion a sales gauntlet taken up with
alacrity and success by the Sun bingo
has challenged news as the main fare of
Fleet Street’s cheapies, the Mirror, Ex-
press, Mail, etc having to follow suit.
So far, so good: old-timers recalled
previous Street give-away battles most
of which petered out as readers rumbled
to the remoteness of their chances.
Then, precisely a year ago, a new el-
ement was introduced: Sir Larry Lamb,
editor of the Express, upped the ante by
claiming to offer £1 million in the
paper’s “Millionaires’ Club.”
The Express’s 1.9 million circulation
spurted 400,000 ahead of the Daily Mail
(whose “Casino” game then looked
pretty tawdry). Some slippage occurred
but the benefits, in sales and advertising
revenue, were considered to be worth
the candle. So things roughly stood until
Maxwell hove upon the scene.
Maxwell’s promised offensive began
with his August 17 press conference
where he told startled reporters that he
was spending £6 million to boost circu-
lation, the centrepoint of which was his
word that a Mirror (or Sunday Mirror,
People, Scottish Daily Record, etc, etc)
reader would win £1 million “within
weeks, not months” in a “bingo-type
game” called WHO DARES WINS -
an enigmatic appelation that is also the
motto of Britain’s elite commando
group the Special Air Service (SAS).
He forecast that the promotion
would boost its 3.36 million sales
“100,000” above the Sun’s 4.18 million
(and well above the Express’s, the Mail’s
I.Bm and the Star’s 1.37 m).
First away from the do was the Ex-
press’s man to inform Lamb that
Maxwell had stolen his thunder. But the
Express next day poured cold water on
the Mirror promo, saying: “This is the
Big One. This is the only one. You can
win £1 million today and every day.”
What Lamb, however, omitted to
mention was that no reader had actually
joined the Millionaires’ Club in the pre-
vious 12 months mainly because the
odds against doing so were around
500,000,000,000 to one and the average
reader would need to wait 1.37 billion
years before having a decent chance of
receiving the magical cheque.
Such statistical niceties were lost in
the subsequent bingo bonanza barrage
exchange. Over the next few days:
■ The Mail, “Casino” notwith-
standing, mounted its high horse to an-
nounce that it was now the only
newspaper in the Street. The Sun, said a
page 3 editorial, “was the world’s most
successful comic.” And the Mail went
on to bag all its popular rivals.
■ The Sun announced “the
BIGGEST instant bingo game in the
galaxy,” a £1 million event, the winner
of which would be flown to New York
by Concorde jet to get the cheque from
Rupert Murdoch personally.
■ Maxwell came up with an editorial


calling all the Mirror’s bingo rivals liars
and dragging up past scandals about
faked stories, chequebook journalism,
etc. “The Mail is the house magazine of
the Tory party,” it sneered. “And the
Express the Titanic of Fleet Street and
sinking fast.”
■ Then all the bingo cheapies began
running “What I’d do with a million”
stories to keep readers’ interest while
cards were printed and distributed. The
Sun informed readers that they could
buy 100,000 bottles of £lO champagne
with the prize.
Even before anyone hit the top jack-
pot, bingo had cost the Sun £7 million
in payments, the Mirror £3 million, the
Star £3.7 million, the Mail £ 1.38 mil-
lion and the Express £ 1.5 million. Ancil-
lary costs could double those figures.
And then bingo! out of this caul-
dron of competition popped the first in-
stant millionaire. The Sun announced
last Friday that it had found a winner.
He is David Parsons, aged 39.
Considering that the game only
started on Monday, the Sun has beaten
its rivals hands down. The other two did
not even have their cards out yet.
As it turned out, though, Parsons was
a small businessman not in dire need of
money. He arrived at the subsequent
press conference with an attractive
young woman who was not his wife.
Then he surprised Sun executives by an-
nouncing that he would give half the
money to her, Sarah Rose.
After hurried talk behind the scenes,
Bruce Matthews, managing director of
News International, told the assembled
scribes: “Mr Parsons is separated from
his wife and the arrangements for a div-
orce are being made.”
Wife, Mary, 40, told relieved Sun
staff: “I’m overjoyed for David. I don’t
expect a penny.” □

Robert Maxwell: opened a new front
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Sundowner’s valuable swag
SUNDOWNER Minerals NL has
produced some extraordinary gold re-
ports in recent weeks, yet the stock has
hardly budged in the past month.
The company is in a 50:50 joint ven-
ture with Hector Ward’s Coronet Re-
sources NL on two gold mining leases
incorporating the old Siberia Consuls
mine, 75km north-west of Kagoorlie.
On July 25, Sundowner announced
that assays on materials from a drill
hole revealed on average grade of 7.7
oz/tonne over 21 m from a depth of 35m
to 56m. The drill ended in ore grading
better than two-thirds of an oz/tonne.
The report went into the stock ex-
change late and, as with many little
companies, appeared to get lost in the
system not a line appeared in the
papers next day about the richest gold
intersection since the late 60s.
Later, check fire assays were released
to show an average of 11.5 oz/tonne
over 22m. Subsequent publicity has
given the main credit to Coronet and
most reports have dismissed the find as
a freakish pod. But it is on the line of
strike of a gold-bearing quartz reef.
The two gold mining leases cover
430 m of parallel reef on which the Si-
beria Consuls is located. It strikes east-
west and dips at 50-70 degrees south.
The blocks are surrounded by Western
Mining ground and are skm south-west
along strike from WMC’s operating
Sand King mine.
The old Siberia Consuls was worked
to not much more than 30m deep and
produced 5662 oz from 2394 tonnes of
ore an average of 2.3 tonnes. The
workings are accessible and I under-
stand a drive below goes to within 6m of
the rich intersection.
Of an 18-hole drilling program just
completed on 40m spacings, four holes
intersected gold and three were con-
sidered significant, including the sensa-
tional Hole No 17.
The joint venture now plans to com-
plete mapping of the old underground
workings and bulk sampling under-
ground including a drive on to the rich
ore intersected to test its extent.
Sundowner has on issue 12.87 mil-
lion fully-paid 10c shares trading at 13c
and 17.84 million lc contribs trading at
4c giving a modest market capitalisa-
tion of $2.3 million. Calling power on
the contribs is $1.6 million and a call of
2c or 3c can be expected soon for the
company will need to replenish its
funds. With a bit of luck the capital will
be tightened up as shareholders renege
and forfeit. It also has outstanding 9.86
million November 1986 options trading
at 6c/7c.
The largest shareholder is Caris Cor-
poration (controlled by Ron Wise and
Yosse Goldberg), with 20 percent. Wise
and Goldberg are withdrawing from the
board this week to be replaced by one of
their executive directors geologist
Malcolm Mason who, before joining the
Wise-Goldberg group last year, spent 11
years with Selection Trust. The other di-
rectors are Sydney solicitor Frank
Pieterse and Reg Coote. (The latter two
control Antimony Nickel NL which has
8 percent of Sundowner. In turn, Sun-
downer has 16.6 percent of Antimony
Nickel and 16.6 percent of Tern
Minerals NL, an active unlisted gold
prospector.)
I’ll take a position in the options.
THIS WEEK I also took a stake in Bal-
larat Brewing Ltd which is near its low
point for the year at $3.20 and well
down from its high of $4.40. The com-
pany, which owns 67 hotels in Victoria,
reported a $13.7 million extraordinary
profit last week on the sale of its CUB
shares and net asset backing has more
than doubled to a disclosed $3.16 a
share. Elders-IXL holds 25.8 percent
and, with all that cash in there, it may
well move to take the lot.

WILDCAT
The French go for the palate
THE FRIENDLY French vintners
splashing beaujolais around at a public
wine-tasting at Sydney’s Hilton Hotel
last weekend are likely to give the Aus-
tralian wine industry another headache.
For the French aim to win 5 percent
of the $6OO-million-a-year Australian
market a heady slice in the face of
predictions that the local market will
shrink by as much as 20 percent follow-
ing last week’s budget slug of a 10 per-
cent sales tax on Australian wines. (For-
merly Australian table wine carried no
tax while imported wine carried a 20
percent sales tax now converted to a
10 percent customs duty and 10 percent
sales tax.)
A group of seven wine shippers from
the Beaujolais region has been touring
Australia for a month on a French-gov-
ernment-subsidised promotion tour.
They are showing more than 40 wines
from 14 shippers to retail in the range of
$5 to $lO.
But there’s a sporting chance that
Australia might sell them something in
return. Marketing manager of ACl’s
packaging division Taco Kuiper told
Wildcat that a carbonic maceration pro-
cess developed by ACI in conjunction
with the Hickinbotham wine family had
caught the attention of one of the
beaujolais shippers. Baron Henri de
Rambateau, whose family has been pro-
ducing wine for 750 years, will take the
process (which enhances aroma and
taste) back to France for trials.
Kuiper said the French told him they
thought it was a fair thing that they lift
their wine sales from less than 1 percent
to around 5 percent of the local market,
since Australia had a positive trade bal-
ance with France.
The imposition of a sales tax on local
wine, which should boost the retail price
of a $5 bottle to around $5.75, will pos-
ition the French in the premium end of
the market.
Grain moguls
WORKERS on NSW grain export ter-
minals now earn more than five times
the average income of Australian farm-
ers.
This apparently cock-eyed situation
was endorsed last week after arbitration
ended a dispute that delayed the ship-
ment of half-a-million tonnes of wheat
worth some $BO million.
The dispute began after the NSW
Grain Handling Authority sought to in-
troduce a third shift on the Sydney and
Newcastle terminals to clear the 3.5 mil-
lion tonne carry-over from last year’s
record wheat crop ahead of receiving
this year’s expected crop of up to 6.2
million tonnes. It would have meant
jobs for another 79 employees. It would
also have reduced overtime payments to
existing employees, some of whom have
earned up to $l2OO a week.
NSW shadow minister for agricul-
ture lan Armstrong told Wildcat last
week that one group of workers at New-
castle was paid 17/4 hours’ pay for 14
minutes’ work when they went into a
second shift at double rates to finish
loading a ship on the weekend.
The dispute was settled last week
after a 12-day strike in Sydney and a
work-to-regulations campaign waged in
Newcastle in June.
It has now been agreed that a third
shift will be introduced but it will be
paid at the rate of time-and-a-half.
Armstrong told The Bulletin that the
grain handling workers had a base rate
pay of $317 a week but an average pay
of double that, or more than $6OO a
week before the new agreement. They
will now get 50 percent more for a third
of their shifts.
That stands in mind-boggling con-
trast to the average earnings of the Aus-
tralian farmer estimated in a recent
Bureau of Agricultural Economics sur-
vey at $6900 a year for the latest year.

Lyle Dayman, told Wildcat that MDA’s
listing was an “even money bet.” With
billings exceeding the $lOO million
mark, MDA is the country’s largest Aus-
tralian-owned agency. The Fortune
Communications Group a merger of
the Schofield Sherbon Baker and as-
sociated agencies and the Fortune
Group comes second with billings of
around $75 million.
Monahan says that MDA’s lawyers
and bankers are putting their heads
together to decide the possibilities of
listing. The advantages as Monahan
sees it are that “it enables you to stay
Australian and expand through access
to other cash reserves. Finance is easier
to structure.” A key attraction is that
listing gives the agency shareholders a
chance to recoup some of the profits of
years in the industry by selling part of
their shareholding on the market. Tra-
ditionally a sell-out to a big US-owned
agency has been the way out for suc-
cessful Australian agencies.
Monahan says: “Listing would also
give us the chance to expand the num-
ber of shareholders on staff.” MDA now
has eight shareholders, all on the na-
tional board. The founding trio are the
major holders.
An event rare in the advertising
world happened last week when
Magnus Nankervis & Curl announced it
had bought back the 35 percent interest
held by Clemenger Australia since 1968.
The buy-back means that MN&C is
again wholly Australian-owned. Clem-
enger is 45 percent owned by the US
giant BBDO.
For MN&C the repurchase es-
timated to have cost around $1.5 million
allows the agency, the fourth-largest
locally-owned house with billings of $2O
million, to compete for accounts that
previously may have conflicted with
Clemenger.
MN&C principal Michael Magnus
cited the example of the time MN&C
pitched for and won the BMW business
only to find that it had to abandon the
account after discovering that
Clemenger has won the Mercedes-Benz
business. □

Beach back in fashion
by Russell hander
A FEATURE of the stockmarket at pre-
sent is the strength of the medium sized
and small oil exploration stocks. With a
market capitalisation of around $7O
million, Beach Petroleum falls into the
former category.
The Bridge Data charts show Beach
on both a monthly plot over 10 years,
adjusted for issues, and on a weekly plot
over two years. Beach performed a hair-
raising descent in 1981-82 as a result of
the failure of the company and its part-
ners to turn up a commercial oil discov-
ery in the much-vaunted offshore
Gippsland Basin block Vic P 11. After
consolidating throughout 1983 Beach
began building a new uptrend in
January 1984 which recently has been
nourished by the Bodalla South No 1 oil
discovery in ATP 269 P in the
Eromanga Basin, Queensland.
Beach has a 20 percent working in-
terest in that portion of the block which
accommodates the discovery well and
has interests in a number of other per-
mits located in the Gippsland, Otway,
Pedirka and Surat Basins. The company
has two distinguished shareholders
Peko with a 19.9 percent equity and
North Broken Hill with a residual 23.6
percent stake.
The monthly chart on Beach high-
lights the neat base formation from
which the current primary uptrend has
sprung while the weekly chart brings
out the fact that Beach has an estab-
lished trend channel and is testing the
top line.
The Santos move on AOD has
tended to strengthen the oil and gas sec-
tor of the market with investors contem-
plating who might be next.

THE MODEST FARMER
A case of mistaken identity
byTSertKjdly
I WENT to Deniliquin in NSW to talk
to a group of farmers this year about
tariffs. They put a name badge on my
lapel and turned me loose to mingle.
Normally, I enjoy this but on this par-
ticular occasion last February I could
not help noticing that people were giv-
ing me not only a wide berth but also
jaundiced glances.
I thought for a while that my person-
al hygiene had let me down but, after
anxiously sniffing myself all over, I was
reassured on that score.
Then a large, sunburnt, raw-boned
bloke came up to me and said
belligerently: “I think you have a nerve
turning up here today, among all us
ricegrowers. If I were you, I would nick
off before we get nasty.”
This reception saddened me. I have
been out of politics since 1977 so, I sup-
pose, I had forgotten how unpopular
politicians are. I explained that I was no
longer a member of parliament and that
there was no need to be nasty.
“I know that,” he snapped, “but you
are the man who is growing rice where
he shouldn’t and we regular ricegrowers
dislike you.”
I explained that I was only a poor
broken-down politician who had come
from South Australia to talk about tar-
iffs and he filled with remorse and took
me away and plied me with beer.
It seems that he had me confused
with a man who had been growing rice
away from the usual areas using his
water right.
Evidently, this is thought to be an
awful thing to do though it is hard for
an outsider to understand why.
When I returned home, I wrote to the
ricegrowers’ association to find out, but
these people are too busy to write to
Modest Farmers.
The rice growing industry resembles
the sugar industry in many ways.
Both were tenderly nurtured by gov-
ernments when they were infants and
both grew into lusty progeny, both ex-
porting about 80 percent of what they
grow and both receiving comparatively
small consumer subsidies. Yet both
groups still cling tenaciously to the gov-
ernment skirts, even when their ability
to compete in the outside world has
been demonstrated.
The Industries Assistance Commis-
sion estimates that ricegrowers get a
consumer subsidy of about $lO million,
though the industry says that it is nearer
$5 million. It is certainly not generous
assistance compared to handouts to sec-
ondary industry. But rice-growers seem
fearful that, if other farmers start grow-
ing rice outside the tightly-controlled
system, the whole orderly marketing
house of cards may come crashing
down. So they are determined to keep
others out.
This they have been able to do in
NSW with the co-operation of the State
Water Resources Commission which
will let its water be used only by
ricegrowers in the club.
I don’t think that even Eccles would
be much concerned about the size of the
subsidy. The federal government does
not hesitate to make ricegrowers pay $1
million extra for the duty on their har-
vesters.
But they have three bigger problems
to face soon.
■ What will happen if rice growing
expands on the Ord River (in Western
Australia) and, particularly, on the
Burdekin (Queensland)? What will hap-
pen when the new election dam is built
on the Burdekin and it is found to be
not profitable to grow sugar there so
they grow rice instead? At the very least,
it must mean more ricegrowers over
whom to spread the subsidy.
■ What will happen when the gov-
ernment starts to charge water rates
more closely related to the true cost of
supplying water? With water becoming
an increasingly scarce resource for
home consumption and recreational
purposes, governments soon will be
pushed into charging much higher rates.
Most of the water for rice costs about
$lO a megalitre, compared with the $l3O
the Israelis pay for theirs. Irrigators
would use water more carefully if it cost
more.
■ Third, much rice land is porous
allowing too much water to drain from
the bays and so raising the water table
to dangerous levels for other crops. And
the water that is drained from rice land
at the end of the season has degrading
effects on the quality of the Murray sys-
tem a serious matter for Adelaide
which depends on the Murray for drink-
ing-water.
Some rice-growers are worrying
about these matters. I think they all
should be.
The best book about the Murray I
have read is Man And The Murray by
Peter Davis which can be bought for
$12.95 through Box 89, Rundle Mall
PO, Adelaide 5000. It is beautifully
illustrated and very responsible; a rare
combination. □


The widow’s mite gets mightier
PIERPONT
HAVING SPENT four hours in the
budget lock-up reading Treasury state-
ments this year, Pierpont feels sadisti-
cally motivated to pass on some of the
suffering to his readers.
Being a merciful chap, however,
your correspondent will confine himself
to two thoughts. Then Pierpont prom-
ises he will drop the whole subject in
favor of something more interesting,
such as snail farming.
1: On the morning after Paul Keat-
ing’s deed was done, your correspon-
dent heard some professional whinger
on a radio station saying that the
Treasurer had not done enough for
those on social welfare.
On Pierpont’s count, those on social
welfare already are getting considerably
more than the community can afford.
Consider the table which shows the
amount of cash benefits paid by the fed-
eral government to individuals, com-
pared with the net amount of pay-as-
you-earn tax collected.
Year Cash Net 1 as
benefits to PAYE % of
persons collections 2
(sbn) (sbn)
1975- 6.2 7.0 88.6
1976- 7.5 8.5 88.2
1977- 8.4 9.6 87.5
1978- 9.3 10.4 89.4
1979- 10.1 12.2 82.8
1980- 11.4 14.1 80.9
1981- 13.3 17.4 76.4
1982- 16.1 18.8 85.6
1983- 19.0 19.6 96.9
1984- (est) 21.7 22.4 96.9
In other words, almost 97 cents in
every dollar every Australian citizen
pays in pay-as-you-earn tax goes
straight into the pocket of one of Aus-
tralia’s allegedly indigent persons.
This means the government’s largest
single source of revenue is absorbed al-
most entirely catering for insatiably
greedy widows, orphans and de facto
spouses. There is almost nothing left for
the government’s other urgent purposes
such as buying submarines or helping
the homosexual partners of ABC staff to
move house.
To be fair, Pierpont should point out
that the benefits paid to individuals in
the table above are not entirely social
welfare benefits. Some of the money
represents the unfunded portion of em-
ployee retirement benefits.
This brings us to the sordid matter of
the Commonwealth Superannuation
Fund Investment Trust. Our federal
public servants contribute from their
salaries every week to the fund and
thereby qualify to receive benefits from
it. To woo the public service vote, vari-
ous governments have raised the ben-
efits provided by this scheme to a level
which no private employer could hope
to match.
Also, a private employer has to make
contributions out of his profits towards
his employees’ super funds but the com-
monwealth government, which insists
on everybody else obeying this law,
does not. Whenever a public servant re-
tires, the government simply takes its
share of the payment out of con-
solidated revenue.
This unfunded liability being borne
by the taxpayer accounted for $lO6 mil-
lion of the $6185 million paid out to
individuals in 1975-6. In 1984-5, it will
have risen to $355 million. Undoubted-
ly, it will continue rising exponentially
for the rest of eternity.
2: Any entity created by the federal
government rapidly acquires a life of its
own and grows like wheat strewn with
phosphate fertiliser. If an example is
needed, the Australian Legal Aid Office
will serve.
For the first 74 years after federation,
somehow we struggled past without a
legal aid system. Pierpont does not re-
member this as a time in which peasants
and workers were ground under by a
despotic legal system, although histories
doubtless will be written by left-wing
academics proving him wrong.
Anyhow, in 1974, Gough Whitlam
bestowed the first commonwealth
money on a legal aid system. In mid-
-1976 it was costing around $lO million a
year and attorney-general Bob Ellicott
considered abolishing it.
He did not (the Liberals have a lot to
answer for over the way they governed
between 1975 and 1977) and, in the
1976-7 budget, Phil Lynch increased its
vote to $2O million.
In 1984-5, the legal aid system is go-
ing to soak up $76.2 million. Some of
this is a result of the commonwealth
taking over the funding of various state
schemes but, as none of them was of
significant size when Gough entered the
fray, for most practical purposes we
might regard the legal aid scheme as go-
ing from a cost of zero to $76 million in
11 years.
It may be of some arcane interest
that in the budget statements this item
comes under the heading of “Law, Or-
der and Public Safety.” The title illus-
trates neatly the impartiality of modern
government. It funds the police in the
hope that they will catch the criminals
and then it funds the lawyers so that
they can set the criminals free again.
Anyone with nothing better to do
can read the budget papers all day de-
tecting similar examples of the organic
growth of government bureaucracies.
Readers wishing to test their skill at
analysing modern government are
invited to guess which of the following


will be the first to break the $5O million
barrier:
■ The National Institute of Dramatic
Art. This had $5.4 million provided in
the current budget and on all trendy cri-
teria would appear to be a good chance.
However, its parent, the Australia
Council, has shown only average form
- merely doubling its grant from $23
million to $43.6 million between 1977
and 1984. Currently quoted at 5 to 2.
■ The Australian Institute of Sport.
Hot favorite. Funding in the current
budget has been lifted to $8.9 million,
double the amount of only two years
back. If it can fulfil its primary purpose
of manufacturing winners for prime
ministers to be seen with, it should lead
the field not only to the $5O million but
also to the $lOO million mark. Two to
one on.
■ Australian Law Reform Commis-
sion. One of the best performers in the
1984-5 budget with an increase of 37.4
percent to $2.5 million. May lack stay-
ing power now its best publicist has
gone to the bench. 10 to 1.
■ Human Rights Commission. Fast
out of the stalls, this pacy nag registered
an 82.5 percent increase to $4.5 million
in the latest budget. Students of form
have noted the HRC is a busybody with
heavy support from trendies and every
vocal minority group in the nation. It
also has a marvellously cumbrous and
illiberal piece of legislation to adminis-
ter in the Sexual Discrimination Act.
Once it sets a racial defamation Act in
place as well, it will become an even
more fertile breeding ground for tyran-
nical sociologists. Seven to 4.
Pierpont thought of including the
Multicultural Television Service, which
is costing us $2B million a year ($25 mil-
lion last year) but it seems to have too
big a head start.
It’s just a thought but if we abolished
the lot of them we might be able to pay a
few more mites to Australia’s widows
and perhaps cut Pierpont’s tax as
well. □
CHESS
Tiger tamed at last
by Terrey Shaw
TIGRAN (“Tiger”) Petrosian, who died
of cancer in Moscow on August 10 at
the age of 55, was probably the most
underrated world champion of the post-
war era.
His patient, manoeuvring style was
respected grudgingly rather than ad-
mired. The placid Armenian perhaps
did not have the attacking flair of a
Mikhail Tal, who could bring spectators
to their feet with the brilliance of a
single move, but in Petrosian’s heyday
in the 1960 s he was as difficult to beat as
the legendary Capablanca. A single loss
by Petrosian would make headlines in
chess magazines, just as a loss by Capa
made a headline for the New York Times
in 1924.
Petrosian’s style teaches us that there
is no point in brilliance for its own sake.
A combination which is unsound is
wrong, no matter how it dazzles as it un-
folds.
In 1949, Petrosian made one of his
best moves when he left his native Tiflis,
Georgia, for Moscow. Home of roughly
half the world’s top players at that time,
Moscow was the ideal city for anyone to
hone his natural talent. In 1963, he
wrested the world title from Mikhail
Botvinnik and held it until Boris
Spassky defeated him six years later.
In a determined bid to regain his title
in 1971, the former champion met a
stumbling block in the form of Bobby
Fischer, a brash young New Yorker at
the height of his powers. Although
Petrosian lost the match, probably he
would like to be remembered for his fol-
lowing incisive win from game two
the only loss Fischer suffered in the
playoff matches leading up to the world
championship.

INTELLIGENCER
This week’s
name for
Upper Volta
RECENTLY it was an-
nounced that the African state
of Upper Volta one of the
world’s poorest countries
had changed its name to
Bourkina Fasso. In local par-
lance, this was thought to
mean Land of Incorruptible
Men.
But now some confusion
has arisen and the govern-
ment has ordered a further
change to Burkina Faso,
which apparently means the
Popular and Democratic Re-
public of Burkina.
Ouatomon Lamien, direc-
tor of the Bourkina Fasso
sorry, Burkina Faso nation-
al radio network, explained
the reason for the error:
“It was due to the fact that
we are not yet quite used to
the national alphabet, in
which the sound ‘ou’ is spelled
‘u’ so it is normal that Burkina
is spelled ‘B-u-r’ instead of ‘B-
o-u’ as some people are in-
clined to write. So Burkina is
spelled with ‘u’ and not ‘ou.’
“Concerning Faso, some
people often use a double ‘s’
but it is spelled with a single
‘s.’ Thus Burkina Faso is
spelled with a ‘u’ for Burkina
and a single ‘s’ for Faso.”
He said the confusion
would iron itself out.

Not dead yet
IS Rose Kennedy, mother of
John F., still alive? American
correspondents of Australian
publications appear divided
on the issue.
The Sunday Tasmanian of

about the Kennedys from

which said: “His wife Rose
... died after a series of
strokes last year, at the age of
93.” Woman’s Day of August
27 carried a full-page photo of
her, headed “Rose Kennedy’s
Triumph Over Tragedy” and
said: “She had nine children
and, at 94, has survived the vi-
olent death of three sons, a
daughter and, recently, an
adult grandson.”
Just to settle any doubts,
Rose is still alive.
When you are not
harassed
AS THE official blitz against
sexual harassment mounts,
the New South Wales Anti-
Discrimination Board has
seen fit to reverse tack and
give some examples of what is
not sexual harassment.
Readers both male and
female, we presume will be
pleased to learn that “it is not
sexual harassment to develop
friendships, sexual or other-
wise, with other workers
where both people consent.
“Nor are actions that
would be unlawful in one
context covered in others. Be-
ing wolf-whistled or proposi-
tioned at a party or the pub
may be offensive to the sub-
ject. But it’s not covered by
anti-discrimination law.”
The board also offers the
enlightening information that
women are usually the objects
of sexual harassment. Except,
perhaps, in the ABC.
Jobs for
the buoys
IN A week when the emphasis
was on pruning government
spending, it was an inspira-
tion to all Australians to see
the federal government was
prepared to spend $6 million
to “upgrade facilities” in Fre-
mantle, WA, to handle the ex-
pected America’s Cup chal-
lenge crowds. It also was rare
to see Finance Minister John
Dawkins being so generous.
But, then, he represents Fre-
mantle very capably, we
would say.
Peacekeeping
is dangerous
PEACEKEEPING service in
the 2200-man Multinational
Force and Observers which
stands between Israel and
Egypt in the Sinai and in
which Australia, New Zea-
land and Fiji have contin-
gents, is distinctly hazardous.
The MFO’s annual report
shows that in the first year
(from Anzac Day 1983 to
Anzac Day 1984) seven mem-
bers died, all in traffic acci-
dents. And the first director-
general, Leamon R. Hunt, was
shot dead in Rome.


Changes are
no small beer
FEDERAL government esti-
mates of the cost of lowering
the excise on low-alcohol
beers may prove way off the
mark if British experience is
any guide.
Last week’s budget split
beer into three categories. For
beer above 3.8 percent alcohol
by volume, the excise remains
at 66 cents a litre equal to
$5.94 for a dozen bottles or
two dozen 375 ml cans. For
beers between 1.15 percent
and 3.8 percent alcohol the
new excise is 58 cents a litre
$5.22 a case.
Below 1.15 percent no ex-
cise is payable but there is a 20
percent sales tax.
In Britain, which has simi-
lar differential rates depend-
ing on alcohol content, brew-
ers have taken advantage by
producing more low-alcohol
brands.
Look out for similar
changes to the strength of
Australian brands.
There is unlikely to be any
dithering with the alcohol
content of big sellers such as
XXXX but the temptation to
move minor brands into the
category where they pay 72
cents a case less duty will un-
doubtedly be considerable.

from American biographer

unlike previous hatchet jobs
with Murdoch’s permission.
Indeed, Kiernon boasts
positive encouragement. He

“I’ve completely lost touch
with my kids; I’m at a com-
plete loss to figure them out.”

BUDGET night was an even
greater scramble for Treasurer
Paul Keating than many
realised.
Immediately after deliver-
ing the budget speech he went
on the ABC program Nation-

The ABC, having got the
Treasurer, hung on to him,
with the result that he was late

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
THE Newcastle Blotters Back-
gammon Club is holding the in-
augural Newcastle Open on Satur-
day, September 22, at Newcastle
University. Entry forms and de-
tails are available from Miss
C. Byrne, Lot 4, Six Mile Rd,
Raymond Terrace, NSW 2324. It
promises to be a top event, well
worth catching if you are near the
Hunter region.
Such tournaments are full of
tough decisions and none much
tougher than the one illustrated.
White leads 8-3 in a match to 11
points.
Black is to roll, he is on the bar
and owns the cube on 2. Should he
double and, if so, should White
accept or reject?
First, let’s look at the situation
from Black’s point of view. If he
fails to roll a 4 from the bar, white
will cover the blot on that point
with any 3, 4 or 9 so he is odds on
to do so. Futhermore, if White
does close out Black, then Black
probably will be gammoned and
will lose 4 points, making the
score 12-3 against him. Black’s
position, therefore, may be
summed up simply: if he doesn’t
roll a 4, he will lose the match.
On the other hand, it’s not all
plain sailing for White. He is
ahead in the race and the odds are
against Black rolling a 4 from the
bar. But, if Black does produce the
4, White’s other blots on his 7 and
8 points will come into the firing
line. If Black doubles and rolls a
4, White faces a gammon loss, 8
points and the match in one
swoop.
Black should realise White’s
predicament and he should
double; he has little to lose. But
White cannot afford to turn the
match into a “one roll contest.”
He should drop, going into the
next round 8-5 ahead.

Opening lead five of clubs.
LET’S ASSUME you’re West and
you lead a trump against six clubs.
Declarer cashes the A-K, East dis-
carding a low diamond, and plays
the A-K-x of hearts, putting you
back on lead with the queen of
hearts.
So there you sit with the K-J-4-
3 of spades and K-J-4-3 of dia-
monds and you must decide which
suit to return. Note that if you
play a spade, declarer makes the
slam; if you play a diamond,
declarer goes down one.
“This is a pretty kettle of fish,”
you say to yourself, “and how can
I possibly tell which suit to lead?”
Well, as in most cases where there
appears to be a level bet, there is a
clue to guide you.
Let’s see what you know so far.
South has shown up with five
clubs and three hearts, leaving
him with probably three cards in
one suit and two cards in the
other. If you can somehow con-
trive to lead South’s shorter suit,
you will eventually make your
king in the other suit.
How about East? He has
shown up with one club and three
hearts but what you really need to
know is whether he has five spades
and four diamonds or four spades
and five diamonds and therein lies
the answer to your problem.
This can be answered on the
basis that East would be far more
inclined to discard from a five-
card suit at trick two than from a
four-card suit.
Since East discarded a dia-
mond on the second trump lead, it
follows that he had five of them
and declarer, hence, two. It is
therefore safe to lead a diamond
at trick six.
