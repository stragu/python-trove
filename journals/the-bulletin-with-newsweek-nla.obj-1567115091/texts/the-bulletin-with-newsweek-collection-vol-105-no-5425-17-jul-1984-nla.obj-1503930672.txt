This
System 12
contract is
the most
significant
trade
agreement
since
Marco Polo.


Recently, the People’s Republic of China signed an historic agreement
with ITT’s Belgian subsidiary, Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company, and
the Belgian government.
Together they formed a
joint venture company to
handle the transfer of tech-
nology for the world’s most
advanced digital telecommu
nications switching system,
ITT System 12.'"
With the full approval of
the United States and
Belgian governments, this
contract will help set a new
standard for telephone
systems in China.
After first importing
100,000 equivalent lines,
China will then produce up
to 300,000 equivalent lines
of System 12 a year.
But it’s not the digital
equipment alone that will
help the People’s Republic
of China meet the increased demand for telecommunications.
It’s the System 12 technology itself, a patented process called fully
distributed control.
It uses many microprocessors in a modular design to control the
network, rather than a large central computer.
So more lines or service can be added easily and economically. Without
upsetting the entire system as it grows.
Fully distributed control is an outgrowth of over $7OO million in research
and development by ITT engineers all over the world.
It’s also why the People’s Republic of China is one of 17 countries that
has ordered System 12.
It’s the kind of trade agreement that would have made Marco Polo proud.

THE TIME TO GET IN IS LONG
BEFORE THE BUILDERS GET OUT
Rialto is now leasing. More than
27,000 m 2 is already committed and
further areas will be ready for
occupation before the end of
the year.
The time to have initial
discussions with the sole leasing
agents is now. While the builders are
still hard at work. You’ll have an
excellent choice of floor areas. And,
possibly, even make considerable
savings on fit-out costs.
Australia’s new landmark is, not
surprisingly, attracting considerable
interest. For instance, its sensitive
blending of history and the future is
just one of the benefits the develop-
ment offers Melbourne. Without it,
the Rialto and Winfield buildings
would not now be undergoing a
transformation which will give them
a new lease of life as Melbourne’s
grandest hotel - Menzies-at-Rialto.
And then there’s the range and
adaptability of the floor areas, the
advanced systems and facilities, the
convenience of the building and its
uniqueness in so many different
aspects. All these make Rialto a very
desirable proposition.
Now is the best time to discuss
your requirements with the agents.
If you would like to know more or if
you would care to visit the new Rialto
Marketing Centre, where you will be
given a comprehensive presentation
on Rialto please phone sole leasing
agents, Richard Ellis or Jones Lang
Wootton.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Support for the IPI
I was pleased to note (People, B, July 3)
that strong Australian representation on
the executive board of the International
Press Institute, the world’s leading me-
dia organisation, is to be continued by
the election of Tom Farrell to succeed
David McNicoll.
To make clear the continuous record
of Australian influence in the IPI, may I
recall that the late Rohan Rivett was a
force in the IPI from its inception. He
served on the board for several years
and was executive director for two years
at headquarters in Zurich. I had the
honor to follow him as Australian board
member.
After seven years I handed over, on
retirement from newspapers, to Ranald
Macdonald.
It is most gratifying to note the pow-
erful interest the Packer and Fairfax en-
terprises are now taking in the IPI. I
commend the IPI to all Australian me-
dia, as I have done for 30 years. It is one
of the few voices heard worldwide in
defence of freedom of speech.

Fed on fertiliser
May I have the privilege as a Bulletin
subscriber of congratulating Katharine
West on her excellent “Where the Lib-
erals have gone wrong” (B, July 3).
At grass roots the Australian elector-
ate is fed a lot of fertiliser. At present, it
is difficult to separate many areas of
Liberal and Labor philosophy.
Positive identity is essential in poli-
tics and consensus is no solution. “A
new kind of constructive radicalism in
Australian political debate” is our
greatest need.
The Fraser government gave the
opinion it didn’t want to continue in
office and the Peacock opposition that it
doesn’t want to govern.
In this progressive part of Queens-
land, we have been nurtured on de-
cisiveness. Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen
has been our local member for 37 years.

Rural thanks
I write to express my thanks for your
recent series of articles on Australian
agriculture.
It is encouraging to find an urban-
based publication looking beyond the
drought, fire and flood cycle.
I look forward to more of the same
showing the positive, as well as the
negative, aspects of our industries.

Rationalising holidays
Ron Saw (B, July 3) has highlighted the
absurdities of our current public hol-
iday dates.
My personal gripe is public holidays
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays
“All those in favor of
putting women in their
place before it’s too late
say, ‘Aye’.”

The highly respected “Your Computer”
magazine has just named the Apple Lisa as
Computer Of The Year, 1984.
In their own words, “People will remember
1983 as the year that Lisa revolutionised
personal computing.”
Surely good news for the business on the
verge of choosing the ideal system.
In the frantic, fast-moving world of micro


technology, where new models are here today
and gone this afternoon, Lisa seems to be a
reassuring exception.
This is the most advanced personal
computer in the world, with up to one million
bytes of internal memory.
Unlike conventional computers, Lisa
works visually, the way you do. Those complex
computer commands are replaced with familiar
symbols and a palm-sized mouse.
Countless man-hours are saved because
Lisa starts being productive from the moment
it’s switched on. (Even for staff who’ve never
used a computer before.)
Little technical miracles like these don’t
exactly happen overnight.
Considering they’ve taken us a good five
years to perfect, even if our competitors simply
copy, they should be kept busy for some time.
There are three Lisa models of varying
price and capacity, any one of which your Apple
dealer would be proud to demonstrate.
You probably won’t be the only company
moving to Lisa technology this year.
We expect quite a few of our
competitors will be doing likewise.

which do little more than interrupt the
flow of the working week.
The first step to reforming our public
holidays would be to move such days to
a Monday or Friday, thus enabling us to
enjoy more long weekends. More long
weekends means a boost to our tourist
industry and less disruption to work.
Why is it that unions and employers
have never spoken out on this subject?
Is it so sacred that the Melbourne Cup
must be run on a Tuesday rather than a
Monday or that Show Day must be on a
Thursday in Melbourne?

Folklore protest
I have read The Bulletin on and off for
55 years or more. However, I must make
a protest. The article by Peter Ellingsen
on folklore made many old shearers bite
the boggi and thousands of others turn
in their graves.
The Jackie Howe was a thick, grey,
short-sleeved flannel worn until post-
war years by shearers and bush workers
alike.
The blue athletic singlet now favored
by truckies and others is a comparative-
ly modern garment originated by Bonds
and the famous “Chesty.”
Although not a shearer, I seek to rec-
tify this misquote on their behalf.
HARRY BRITTEN
Watson A Cl
Gloves are off
The erosion of professionalism is oc-
curring at an ever-increasing rate, typi-
fied by the current debacle created by
Mr Wran and Dr Blewett.
If groups of people are expected to
behave in a professional, ethical and re-
sponsible manner then they must be
treated as such by government.
Wran may or may not realise that his
pigheaded antagonism will only create
problems.
The medical profession as a group
are dedicated, responsible profession-
als. To treat them in such an insulting,
offensive manner is ridiculous and will
only invoke antagonism.
The care of patients has always been
the prime concern of the profession.
Wran and his Health department are far
more concerned with playing politics as
a means of introducing nationalised
medicine part of Blewett’s long-term
plan, hand in hand with Wran.
Every profession in this country
“There’s nothing I can do for you-you are a duck. ”
should feel threatened by this frontal at-
tack. If the medical fraternity is stripped
of its professional code in this abusive
manner, further inroads will occur into
other professions; undoubtedly Labor’s
aim.
The gloves are off!
DR JOHN GLUER
Mackay Qld
No kidding
Teachers, parliamentarians, journalists
and TV commentators have been worry-
ing me with their endless references to
the plight of “kids” or, more poignantly,
“kiddies.” Whatever happened to the
offspring of homo sapiens? Sorry per-
son sapiens? Or should it be homo
persons? I remember when they were
known as children. My wife and I had
six of them. I am not a billy nor my wife
a nanny.
I have very good boots made of kid,
from the hide of a young goat. I shudder
to think the leather may have come
from the pelt of some unfortunate child.
This is not a matter to be treated with
“kid gloves” (a soft touch, gentle ap-
proach). Some people quite easily may
make asses of themselves and finish up
being a bit of a goat. Perhaps it is these
who produce kids who, when old
enough to read and write, send letters to
the editors of some newspapers for pub-
lication in the “Kiddies Korners” of
those rags.
One way and another, I have had a
fair bit to do with kids and can assure
the concerned media personnel they
need have no concern for their well-be-
ing. They thrive on a diet of old news-
print, cigarette butts, defoliate shrubs
and fatten on anything they can masti-
cate. They grow up to be goats and ask
nothing more by way of entertainment
than for someone to leave a car parked
for them to climb over and use as a
skating rink.
I suppose I’m an old goat for bother-
ing to write to you, even a galah per-
haps, but I’m serious. No kidding.
T. H. SCOTT
Barcaldine Qld
Iniquitous tax
With the government’s abject decision
to recant the tax on fortified wines, per-
haps now it will lift another equally in-
iquitous impost. I refer to the tax on
patriotism.
Many reserve soldiers fulfil their ser-
vice obligations at considerable finan-
cial loss. The deleterious effects of this
tax on morale, parade attendance, re-
engagement and enlistment have been
felt already.
The minister of Defence has the op-
portunity to show the defence forces
that he has as much influence within
cabinet as has the Premier of South Aus-
tralia by having this tax revoked.

First for Darwin
With reference to Michael Llewellyn-
Smith’s letter (B, June 26) regarding fe-
male lord mayors, I would like to point
out that Doctor Ella Stack became may-
or of Darwin in 1975 and became the
lord mayor in 1979, so Wendy Chap-
man is not the first female lord mayor.
Sorry to disappoint all those
southerners but Darwin is an Australian
capital city, believe it or not, so I think
we can claim this as a first.
It might also interest readers to know
that we have just elected a new mayor,

The day you join the Air Force you start
receiving a salary. Even though you’re a Rill time
student either at the RMIT (Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology) or the WAIT (Western
Australian Institute of Technology).
At the WAIT you can study communications
or electronics. At the RMIT you can study
aeronautical, electrical or communications/
electronics engineering.
All of them lead to a degree.
When you graduate as an officer you will
be posted to one of several RAAF bases.
There you will undertake design projects,
supervise maintenance and have the
management of maintenance resources for some
of the most sophisticated equipment in
the country.
BECOME MUCH MORE THAN
AN ENGINEER.
As a graduate officeryou have more than
merely an engineering degree. Because in the
RAAF you are also given training in
management and administration.
So by the time you’re about 22, you will be
much further advanced than your civilian
counterparts. Not only because of your technical
expertise, but also your capacity to accept
responsibility. After all, by then you could be in
charge of a hangar full of aeroplanes and
anythingup to 30 technicians.
To enter the Engineer Cadet Scheme you
must be an Australian citizen under 20 on
February Ist ofyouryear of entry and meet our
selection requirements.

The real franchise
I was interested to read Howard Beilin’s
letter on franchising as a way “to raise
the standards of the black man in South
Africa” (B, June 26).
It’s good to hear that black South
Africans are to be enabled by franchis-
ing to sell hamburgers and hotdogs.
When are we going to hear that they
are also enfranchised in the sense of be-
ing able to vote?

In reference to Bruce Knapman’s com-

Papua New Guinea (B, June 19), I have
a problem. I thought the joke was very

A bum comment
T. M. Burvill, lecturer in English, Mac-

his last paragraph to putting “bums” on
seats. I assume he means putting “pos-

If T. M. Burvill has any say in the
instruction of our children’s schooling,
then it is not surprising that that school-
ing is deteriorating.

fashionable to write obscure, unconnec-
ted, incomplete sentences without punc-
tuation, without capital letters?
What would happen if Longfellow or
Wordsworth were alive today and sent
in their poems to The Bulletin’s Literary
Supplement, poems which had the tem-
erity actually to rhyme and had the aud-
acity to conform to some sort of metre?
If Wordsworth and Longfellow had
enclosed a stamped addressed envelope,
would they have received their poems
back?

Barriers to the deaf
I am pleased that Brian Hoad brought
much-needed attention to Australia’s
Theatre of the Deaf in his review of
Children of a Lesser God (B, June 19). A
surprising amount of effort has been
required in gaining recognition from
factions of the government funding
bodies, as well as from our own parent
organisation, the Australian Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust.
But Hoad’s sharply critical review of
the play goes off the mark when he criti-
cises the production and the production
team as examples of “processed Ameri-
can theatre.” The production is British,
with British designers and director.
The British producers have worked
the play in England for two years and
have seen first-hand that the insistence
the play always be performed in Am-
erican sign language was badly
shortsighted, leading to dissatisfied pro-
tests from the deaf community in Brit-
ain. Your readers also should know that
members of the AETT managing staff
were warned in December 1983 that the
Australian deaf community would cer-
tainly voice its anger over a decision
which denies it full access to a play
purportedly dealing with deaf relation-
ships, language and social status.
That neither the British producers
nor the AETT addressed this situation
in their production, publicity or pro-
gram decisions reflects their own dis-
pirited approach to these issues.
The attitudes Hoad criticises are so-
cial barriers not limited to one nation.
They are barriers Australia’s Theatre of
the Deaf approaches daily.

THE SUMMIT
OF MUDGEERABA
ON THE GOLD COAST
Would you like to smell the morning dew
on the top of the world, with 360° views of
ocean, valleys and green, green hills?
The Summit is a unique development
fourteen homesites along the top of a ridge
twenty minutes from the central Gold Coast,
Queensland.
Large hill top homesites, with acres of
tranquillity, views of the ocean and easy ac-
cess, are becoming priceless, and will soon
be just a memory.
The Summit is not pioneering territory.
All the attractions of the Gold Coast, the Pa-
cific and the fabulous waterways are close
enough to be enjoyed, but not so close they
intrude.
Naturally these 3 hectare to 6 hectare
lots are exclusive, in position and in price.
There are fourteen, and prices start
around $lOO,OOO.
If you feel that your success deserves
the ultimate recognition, give yourself the life
style that others dream about.

Back to the desert?
I wish to protest the push, particularly
in our national magazines (B, June 26),
to take funding away from the success-
ful members of our culture the Aus-
tralian Opera, the Australian Ballet and
the symphony orchestras and give it
to the unlistenable, the unreadable, the
untalented and usually pornographic
bodies and persons seeking such funds.
I wonder whether the critics remem-
ber the cultural desert of 30 years ago.

Narrow view
I write as a committee member of an
association which fights for sense in the
debate “pine trees versus native forests”
in the hinterland of the Noosa Shire.
We are not a group of avid anti-loggers;
nor is the “sister” association, the Con-
ondale Range Committee. As a group,
we believe in sustained yield and mul-
tiple use of state forests and have a firm
view of the employment prospects of all
aspects of forest use.
So it was with great amazement that I
read (B, May 1) the letter from the
Queensland Conservator of Forests in
which he decried the “promotion of the
viewpoint that native forests per se are
for complete preservation and that tim-
ber utilisation should be confined to
plantations ...”
This narrow point of view is certain-
ly no tenet of ours; any blanket attempt
“As far as we’re concerned, boss,
you’re all bloody immigrants. ”
to preserve areas entirely stems from the
well-deserved ecological significance of
those areas.
What is even more risible and ironic
in the conservator’s letter is his sugges-
tion that there are “more pressing con-
servation problems in our farming and
grazing lands such as salination,
dieback and soil erosion.”
Surely he knows full well that all of
these problems result from careless thin-
ning of native forests; so much for his
view of logging as scientific forest man-
agement.

Charting gold
I found the chart on gold (B, June 26) a
fine example of the craftsmanship of
your Chartist. However, in order that
the serious investor can make a mature
decision in this matter, could he now
make a chart informing readers of the
price of gold relative to the mean costs
of extracting it out of the ground in, say,
the past 100 years?

“The finest reward for our research:
happy, healthy children?
■*“ Scientists and advisers at Hoechst.
Today, doctors can defeat
many diseases that only a few
years ago were regarded as
incurable, e.g. tuberculosis,
diphtheria and typhoid fever.
Now we can also protect
our children from polio, small-
pox and tetanus. But while
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetics,
high blood pressure, cancer and
many other devastating diseases
remain unconquered there is
no room for complacency.
The quest for a cure must
not waver.
That is why Hoechst
scientists are dedicated to
eliminating these scourges of
mankind.
The cost of course is
considerable; Hoechst spent in
1982 alone the equivalent of
A 5624 million on research.
Our efforts however are
being rewarded. One significant
example is a new vaccine
against various meningitis
pathogens with which doctors
are saving the lives of many
children.

Land rights referendum
Poor old Pierpont has to cop the usual
accusations of racism when he com-
ments on the matters which are of in-
creasing concern to the public.
If P. I. O’Shane and her ilk had their
way, there would be a mass of legisla-
tion passed preventing any comment by
the press on matters she disagrees with.
This, of course, would leave the min-
ority to implement more of the ratbag
policies on this country.
Isn’t it time we had a referendum on
such matters as Aboriginal land rights
and Asian immigration?
DAVID BRIANT
Glenbrook NSW
Film-making experience
In her article “A case of art imitating
anguish” (B, June 19), Susan Molloy
states that I wrote a screenplay about
the threatened collapse of my marriage
which resulted in the film My First
Wife. This is not accurate. But so be it.
Malcolm Smith, the general manager
of Filni Development at the Australian
Film Commission, in his letter of July 4,
writes that My First Wife is about my
“marriage problems” and that I seem to
have forgotten about the substantial
financial assistance “provided” by the
commission for this film. This is also
inaccurate.
Allow me to put the record straight.
1. No one has yet seen the film ex-
cept the cast and crew and adminis-
trative staff. My wife has also seen it.
She appreciates it, while being dis-
appointed that the character of the
wife (played by Wendy Hughes) did
not reflect her at all whereas the hus-
band (played by John Hargreaves)
did seem to display some of my
traits.
2. I am well and reasonably happy liv-
ing in Melbourne with my wife,
child, two dogs and two goldfish.
3. The faith shown by the commission
was encouraging but their offer was
complicated by the following condi-
tions:
A: My wife was required by the
commission to sign a letter re-
leasing the production company
from any future potential legal
action; and
B: I was not to depart from the final
draft of my own scenario (adapt-
ed for the screen by myself and
Bob Ellis).
Of course we went in search of fur-
ther finance without (at that point) dis-
charging the commission’s offer. The
show must go on. However, all produc-
tion funds were secured before princi-
pal photography commenced. The com-
mission did ultimately see the ignorant
nature of clause B, above, and deleted
it. But clause A above remained.
It is most humiliating for any artist
“Some art gallery. This room’s empty!”
who uses some of his or her personal
experiences (what else does he/she have
to offer?) to have to ask the people who
love and trust him/her to allow him/her
to express him/herself. David William-
son, for example, has been accused of
“using” his friends and relations in his
stage plays and screenplays. But it’s
more like Ingmar Bergman having to
ask his former wives (I think there were
five of them): “... Can I please go and
play with my camera, Mummy; I want
to make a film called Fanny And Alex-
ander ...”
I regard myself very much as an Aus-
tralian film-maker and would love to
make a film with the full backing of the
Australian Film Commission. My rec-
ord has proven that I’m a responsible
and most economical film-maker. So
why doubt it?

Supplementary poetry
In some dark niche of memory
I remember once upon a time
When poetry had a beat all its own
And as a rule would rhyme.
I’ve heard of nouveau literature
Each day heralds something new
But surely that oughtn’t change the fact
That poetry has a meaning too!
Truncate your phrases if you will,
Massacre syntax, make grammarians
scream,
Torture and shred English if you must,
But don’t, oh DON'T forget the theme!
For only a theme could redeem
What this magazine’s poetic sages
Have wrongly called poetry and al-
lowed to “grace”
The Bulletin's literary pages.
Yours sincerely in poetry that at least
has some credibility in the areas of
rhythm, rhyme and theme (words that
you will probably have to explain to the
poets of your supplement). ..

The peaceful sex
The cartoon on page 22 (B, June 19)
raises an interesting point. “What would
the world be like if women ran it?”
An immediate answer might be: “No
different than it is now.” However,
experience states otherwise. Upon
examining the records of three major
nations ruled by women in recent years,
one finds Indira Gandhi, Margaret
Thatcher and Golda Meir all embroiled
in war after gaining power.
Let’s leave the world in the hands of
men, the peaceable sex.

Information, please
The National Park and Wildlife Service
is seeking information concerning the
history of Rodd Island, now part of
Sydney Harbor National Park, which
will assist in the conservation and res-
toration of the buildings and grounds.
Rodd Island was dedicated as a re-
serve for public recreation in 1879.
In 1888 the NSW Government chose
Rodd Island as the site for rabbit exter-
mination experiments. Most of the
buildings still standing date from this
time.
Early this century Rodd Island again
became a popular picnicking spot, with
ferries calling every hour. A stone swim-
ming enclosure and three timber
summer houses survive from this
period.
The service would particularly like
to hear from readers who have old
photographs of the island, perhaps
taken on picnics or outings. Any ma-
terial supplied would be copied and re-
turned to the owner.
Anyone who has information they
feel may assist are asked to contact the
Service research historian, Jane
Foulcher, cultural resources section,

PO Box NlB9, Grosvenor Street, Syd-
ney 2000 or telephone 237 6759.

Tap into the financial
thinking of one of Australia’s
most successful corporations.


As an investor, how would you like
to possess the knowledge and investment
skill of the financial planners at Elders
IXL? If you haven’t got it, there’s a sure
way to get it: become a unit holder in
Elders Equity Trust.
An equity trust is a pooling of
investments which enables the investor
or unit holder to become part owner of a
range of equities. These generally
comprise shares or securities, but may
also include debentures or money
market instruments.
The difference between trusts is the
difference between the skill, experience
and insights of the people who manage
them. That’s why Elders Equity Trust is
such an outstanding opportunity for you:
it enables you to tap into the financial
thinking of Elders, one of Australia’s
most successful corporations.
The unique credentials
of Elders IXL.
You know Elders for its size, for its
diverse range of interests, and for its
success. What you may not know is that
Elders enjoys a long and enviable record
in the specific area of investment man-
agement. Recent surveys from Campbell
& Cook, consulting actuaries, highlight
Elders’ impressive record and extensive
experience.
In the management of superannuation
funds that have assets in excess of $5O
million, Elders’ superannuation fund has
rated as one of the top two performers in
the country over the last three years.
A second survey indicated that
$l,OOO invested in December 1979 in
Elders’ superannuation fund had risen in
value to $2,533 at the end of 1983. By
comparison, a $l,OOO investment in the
Stock Exchanges Share Accumulation
Index rose in value to $1,862 over the
same period.
A unique opportunity
for you.
Elders Equity Trust can bring this
unique experience to bear on your
investment. The minimum investment
requirement is $l,OOO, and, while Elders
Equity Trust has been designed to suit
medium to longer term investors, you
may withdraw all or part of your invest-
ment funds at any time on short notice -
normally within three business days.
When you become a unit holder you
incur a once-only service charge of 5%
of the price of each unit. A management
fee of 1 % per annum is chargeable on
the net asset value of the Trust.
So, if your objective is attractive
capital growth, combined with an
income component, through a carefully
constructed portfolio of investments,

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
New union move
THE controversy in the Labor
Party over the affiliation of
four right-wing unions with
the Victorian ALP took a new
turn last week. The national
executive decided on Prime
Minister Hawke’s motion to
set up a committee “to con-
sider the question of the cri-
teria to be applicable for the
affiliation of trade unions to
the Labor Party.” The com-
mittee will consist of one rep-
resentative from each of the
party’s three factions and the
ALP national secretary, Bob
McMullan.
Judge’s home bombed
A POWERFUL gelignite
bomb wired to the knob of the
front door of Family Court
judge Raymond Watson’s
home unit in the Sydney sub-
urb of Greenwich exploded,
killing Mrs Pearl Watson, 58.
The explosion knocked out
and wounded Justice Watson,
injured three other people,
devastated the home unit
building and severely
damaged nearby houses. It
was the fourth crime of its
kind since Family Court judge
David Opas was shot dead in
1980. A special police task
force with a “limitless brief’
to track down those respon-
sible was established and all
43 Family Court judges were
put under a 24-hour police
guard.
Cease fire in NSW
VISITING medical officers of
New South Wales public hos-
pitals suspended industrial ac-
tion after reaching agreement
with the State Government on
negotiations which may end
the NSW hospital dispute.
The doctors agreed to return
to their posts until the end of
the first week of the state par-
liament’s August session. The
government has pledged to re-
peal during that week the
seven-year ban on the re-em-
ployment of doctors who re-
signed from public hospitals.
The government has also
agreed to negotiate points in
earlier legislation which led to
the resignations of many
specialist surgeons from pub-
lic hospitals.
Big deep freeze
A DEEP freeze descended on
Victoria, New South Wales
and parts of Queensland last
week. In NSW snow was re-
ported all along the Table-
lands from Tenterfield to the
Snowy Mountains. In the
middle of the week in Sydney
the temperature rose to only
9.1 a record breaker. Heavy
snow fell in south-east
Queensland and in some
places 10cm covered the
ground. In Victoria, tempera-
tures plummetted below zero
and rain fell over large areas.
It was welcomed by graziers
fearing a return to drought
conditions.
THE WORLD
Kidnap attempt
A DIPLOMATIC row be-
tween Britain and Nigeria was
brewing after former Nigerian
cabinet minister Umaru
Dikko, in self exile in
England but wanted in his
own country on corruption
charges, was abducted by a
gang near his London home.
Police found Dikko uncon-
scious in a diplomatic crate,
addressed to the Nigerian
Foreign Minister in Lagos, at
Stanstead airport near Lon-
don. Two Israeli mercenaries
and two Nigerians were
charged with attempted kid-
napping.
Sikh hijack
A GROUP of Sikhs hijacked
an Indian airliner with 255
passengers and nine crew
during a flight from Srinagar
to New Delhi and forced the
pilot to land at Lahore in Pak-
istan. The hijackers, armed
with pistols and explosives,
threatened to blow up the
plane unless the Indian Gov-
ernment met their demands,
including payment of $3O mil-
lion and the release of 20 Sikh
extremists. Eighteen hours
later, however, they freed
their hostages and surren-
dered to the Pakistani author-
ities.
Moruroa report
AFTER TWO months of
on-the-spot investigations of
the consequences of French
nuclear testing at Moruroa
Atoll, a mission comprising
scientists from Australia, New
Zealand and Papua New
Guinea reported well below
world average radiation levels
from the area. The report
added that there was little
expectation of detecting radi-
tion-induced diseases. Leak-
age of contaminated material
from detonation chambers be-
neath the sea will not occur
for 500 to 1000 years. Despite
the findings the Australian
Foreign Minister, Bill
Hayden, said his Government
remained firmly opposed to
the French testing.
Big shipping losses
SINCE the first Iraqi attack
on shipping in the Gulf on
March 27, more than 2 million
tonnes of shipping have been
damaged or destroyed by
military action in the area. In-
surance companies, mainly
Lloyd’s of London, have paid
or will have to pay tens of mil-
lions of dollars for the losses
suffered.
Fortune for art
THE DUKE of Devonshire
put on auction at Christie’s of
London 71 of his collection of
2000 drawings by old masters.
The auctioned items included
works by Raphael, Leonardo
da Vinci, Rembrandt, van
Dyck, Rubens and Holbein


the Younger. The top price
$5.1 million was paid for a
study of a man’s head by
Raphael. Altogether the 71
drawings fetched a record
$32.8 million.
Masses starving
ACCORDING to the latest
UN Food and Agriculture Or-
ganisation (FAO) report,
masses of people will starve in
24 drought-stricken African
countries unless food is made
available quickly. However,
aid deliveries are slow. The
need in cereals alone is 5.4
million tonnes. Donors had
pledged to supply 2.35 million
tonnes but so far only 1.65
million tonnes have been de-
livered.
General Salan dies
GENERAL Raoul Salan, who
in 1961 plotted to over-throw
and kill President Charles de
Gaulle and to keep Algeria
French, died in a Paris hospi-
tal aged 85. Sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1962 he was
freed two years ago.
Civil war goes on
HOPES for an early end to
the nine-year-old Lebanese
civil war rose in Beirut and
were dashed in the port city of
Tripoli, 67km north of the
capital. In Beirut, government
troops took over Christian
and Moslem militia strong-
holds without firing a shot.
But in Tripoli fighting flared
up between Moslem funda-
mentalists and pro-Syrian
Wimbledon: women’s singles winner Navratilova with trophy
militiamen. By the weekend
about 30 people had been
killed and some 100 wounded
in street battles.
Dame Flora dead
BRITISH character actress
Dame Flora Robson, the star
of many stage and screen
plays over more than half a
century, died in her sleep at
Royal Sussex Hospital in
Brighton from an undisclosed
illness. She was 82.
BUSINESS
$A crashes
THE Australian dollar fell
through the US 85 cent barrier
to an all-time low against the
American currency, a victim
of the US dollar’s strength
and higher US interest rates.
Beirut: government troops remove barriers dividing the city
At the same time gold
plummetted to SUS34S, after
breaking the SUS34O level.
Nicholas Kiwi bid
DIRECTORS of the diversi-
fied multinational Nicholas
Kiwi Ltd rejected Castle-
maine Tooheys Ltd’s cash and
share takeover offer which
valued the company at $307
million. The cashed-up
Castlemaine offered one of its
own shares plus $3.75 cash for
every two Nicholas Kiwi
shares or, alternatively, $4
cash for each share. The
stockmarket also felt that the
Castlemaine bid was on the
low side and at the end of the
week Nicholas was trading at
around $4.10.
Ok Tedi leak
THE $1 billion Ok Tedi mine
stopped gold production in-
definitely on the orders of the
Papua New Guinea Govern-
ment after some 1000 tonnes
of cyanide solution leaked
into the Ok Tedi River. The
government said it will not al-
low gold processing to resume
until it is satisfied that the in-
cident cannot be repeated and
that procedures are imple-
mented to detect any leakage
immediately.

The deal Hawke did
on conference eve
On the eve of Labor’s national conference this week, Prime Minister Bob Hawke
struck a deal which not only sent him in in better political shape but also was set to
swing the party’s balance of power to the right. Richard Farmer tells how it was done.
A LITTLE OLD-fashioned
wheeling and dealing in the
Prime Minister’s office on the
eve of Labor’s federal confer-
ence has laid the foundations
for a major change in the
ALP’s power structure. Last
Wednesday, Hawke reached
an agreement with Foreign
Minister Bill Hayden and
seven other members of the
centre left that will swing the
balance of power in the Labor
Party very much to the right.
The formula arranged be-
hind closed doors almost cer-
tainly will lead to the reaffilia-
tion of four right-wing unions
in Victoria from October.
Under the guise of the federal
executive drawing up a set of
criteria governing trade union
affiliation, Hawke and the
centre left also made it easier
for right-wing unions in Tas-
mania and other states to join
the Labor Party.
The end result should be that future
federal conferences of the party will see
the left with diminished influence.
Hawke began last Wednesday’s
Senator Graham Richardson: helping Hawke with the numbers
meeting in a somewhat diffident mood.
The pressures of preparing for his first
party conference as leader seemed to be
worrying him more than the pressures
of his office as Prime Minister.
John Button and Bill Hayden: supporting Hawke on union reaffiliation
ROB WALLS/RAPPORT
Before the meeting he was
determined at last Thursday’s
federal executive to press for
that body to overrule the
Victorian State Labor Confer-
ence decision not to let the
four right-wing unions back
into the fold. At the end of the
meeting he could see the wis-
dom of waiting a little longer
to get not only the result he
wanted in Victoria but also
the possibility of affiliations
by unions to other state Labor
branches.
The centre left urged
Hawke to refrain from push-
ing for reaffiliation now, on
the grounds that such action
would create a climate of ten-
sion and crisis at this week’s
conference. They feared the
conference would spend a lot
of its time trying to re-exam-
ine and overturn the decision
of the executive. If we take the
decision after the conference, they ar-
gued, there will be no appeal to the con-
ference against it.
Hawke agreed only on the basis that
he would have the support of the centre
left for the reaffiliation of the four
unions when the matter next came be-
fore the executive. This commitment
was given.
Hawke has been pushing for changes
in the Labor Party’s power structure
virtually from the day he succeeded
Hayden as leader. However, Hawke has
shown considerable patience. He was
prepared to allow the Victorian branch
to hold its own inquiry into whether the
Amalgamated Society of Carpenters
and Joiners, the Federated Clerks
Union, the Shop Distributive and Allied
Employees Association and the
Federated Ironworkers Association
were fit to be allowed back into the
Labor fold.
Hawke knew that the outcome of
that inquiry would be a division on
strict factional lines. The right would
say the unions were fit to return and the


left would say no. Hawke also knew that
the Victorian conference would uphold
the left-wing view and that the fight
eventually would have to be won by him
in the federal executive.
After the Victorian conference made
the predictable decision against re-
affiliation, Hawke flirted with pushing
the issue to a vote last week at the feder-
al executive. His final decision not to do
so followed assurances by the centre left
members that they would support him
when the executive next met.
For Hawke, waiting another couple
of months for the result he wants was a
cheap price to pay. Thus it was that the
Prime Minister himself moved the mo-
tion that established a committee “to
consider the question of the criteria to
be applicable for the affiliation of trade
unions to the Labor Party.”
Evidence that the left knew what
deal had been done was clear from the
fact that its representatives spoke and
voted against the committee proposal.
The left realises that it is impossible to
lay down criteria that keep right-wing
unions out of the party because some
of their officials had or have associa-
tions with a body such as the National
Civic Council without the same cri-
teria affecting unions which have com-
munist connections.
Within hours of the federal executive
decision, Victorian branch president
George Crawford was talking angrily
about preparing a legal case challenging
the right of the federal executive to in-
tervene.
Crawford really will have something
to protest about after the next executive
meeting unless there are some amazing
changes of heart.
Hawke has conducted negotiations
on the reaffiliation question himself,
with the help of Senator Graham
Richardson. The decision to be patient
for another couple of months followed
PUBLIC OPINION
A trend
against Labor
emerges
A TREND against the Federal Govern-
ment has emerged in the latest Morgan
Gallup Poll. In the poll, support for the
government slipped 3 percent to 50 per-
cent.
At the same time, approval of Prime
Minister Bob Hawke fell 2 percent to 67
percent, his lowest ranking since mid-
December.
Approval of Opposition leader
Andrew Peacock rose 3 percent to 34
percent.
These figures came from asking 1984
electors throughout Australia on the
weekends of June 23 and 30 which party
would receive their first preference if “a
federal election were held today for the
House of Representatives.”

the talks on the eve of the executive
meeting with eight members of the
centre left faction: Hayden, Energy
minister Senator Peter Walsh, Finance
minister John Dawkins, the South Aus-
tralian party secretary Chris Schacht,
Tasmanian Michael Tate, South Austra-
lian Senator Margaret Crowley, West
Australian Senator Peter Cook and
Queensland AWU official John Black.
Hawke finished that meeting with the
assurance that the centre left’s members
on the executive Schacht and Tate
would support him when the matter
came up finally for decision. Before
agreeing to a postponement, Hawke
also spoke with his Senate leader John
Button and Social Security Minister
Don Grimes. They also agreed to sup-
port Hawke when the day came.
There is no doubt that Hawke would
have preferred to have the reaffiliation
question in Victoria resolved before this
week’s federal conference began.
Postponing it until September or
October just prolongs the agony and the
challenges from Victoria that will follow
the decision make a December election
less of an option.
With the assurances of support under
his arm and perhaps a personal pref-
erence for a March election in any case
Hawke was prepared to go along with
the argument that a showdown last
week would just make this week’s con-
ference unnecessarily difficult.
It is one of the ironies of political life
that at the conference Hawke and
Hayden are cast as allies on most of the
major matters to be resolved.
In many ways, the man Hawke
replaced as leader has acted more as a
leader than the leader himself. While
Hawke was involved in the back-room
dealing before the conference began, his
public profile at party functions was
limited because of his realisation that
his rating with party members is much
lower than it is with the public.
With Hayden, the reverse is true. His
standing within the party is much higher
than it is with the public. He was of
great assistance to his Prime Minister in
the conference lead-up and these were
not the circumstances under which
Hawke could refuse to go along with the
reasonable proposals about affiliation
made by the faction Hayden leads.
In addition, there is an undoubted
bonus in having the federal executive
determine a set of criteria which will
govern affiliation attempts not only in
Victoria but also in other states.
Hawke’s numbers man, Richardson,
has his mind set on changing left-wing
control of the Tasmanian branch as well
as in Victoria. The executive decision at
its next meeting will make federal inter-
vention in Tasmania much easier when
right-wing unions there apply for re-
admission to the party. □
PICKERING’S CONFERENCE


PUBLIC OPINION
Strong reaction
to nature of
migrant intake
Anti-Asian immigration graffito at the University of NSW
THE NUMBER of people in Australia
who regard the country’s immigration
intake as too big rose in June despite the
announcement that the program was be-
ing cut. The Morgan Gallup Poll also
recorded a small rise in the number ob-
jecting to the size of the Asian migration
intake, in spite of a slight cut in that
program.
Australian-born people were firmest
in the opinion that the immigration pro-
gram was too big. But 44 percent of
those classed as Asian/others agreed.
The poll found firm support among
those opposed to the size of the intake
for the proposition that Australia
should not take any migrants at all. A
slightly higher proportion favored stop-
ping Asian immigration.
The Morgan Gallup Poll conducted
two series of interviews Australia wide
on the subject, one in May and one in
June. Each poll covered about 2000
men and women aged 14 years and over.
In May, 58 percent said that the
number of people who migrated here in
1982-83 93,000 was too many. In
June, after debate had flared on the
level of Asian immigration, 62 percent
said that the planned intake of migrants
for 1984-85 72,000 was too big.
In the first survey 57 percent thought
the 1982-83 intake of 24,500 Asian mi-
grants too big. In the second, 59 percent
said that the planned 1984-85 intake of
24,000 Asians was too large.
On the evidence of the two polls, the
debate on Asian migration sparked by
criticism by Melbourne University his-
torian Professor Geoffrey Blainey has
hardened anti-immigrant feeling es-
pecially anti-Asian feeling.
People surveyed in May were told
that about 93,000 people came to Aus-
tralia in 1982-83 to live permanently
and then asked: “In your opinion, were
93,000 people too few, too many or
about right?”
Respondents then were told that
about 24,500 of the total were Asians
who had received permanent residential
status.
They were asked: “In your opinion,
were 24,500 Asians too few, too many or
about right?”
People surveyed in June were told
that about 72,000 people would come to
Australia in the next 12 months to live
permanently. They were asked: “In
your opinion, are 72,000 people too few,
too many or about right?”
Told that about 24,000 of the number
would be Asians who would receive
permanent residence status, they were
asked: “In your opinion, are 24,000
Asians too few, too many or about
right?”
The first table shows that 58 percent
of people said that 93,000 immigrants
last year were “too many.”

POLITICS
The Liberals
plan their
uphill fight
By ANTHONY HILL
THEY WILL barely have cleared the
tables from the ALP national confer-
ence at Canberra’s Lakeside Hotel be-
fore setting them again for a special Lib-
eral Party federal executive meeting
called for next week.
There will be differences, of course.
The executive will not meet over a full
exhausting week. There will be less than
half the number of delegates. And it will
be held behind the decent privacy of
closed doors not under the glare of
the television lights where every nuance
and shift in the factional alliances are
noted and analysed.
As a measure of the importance the
Liberal Party attaches to the results of
the conference, the special executive
will be held over two days instead of
one, and the numbers attending have
been expanded from the usual 18 to 40.
Invitations have gone to all state parlia-
mentary leaders, most of whom intend
to be there.
The first day will be spent looking at
the implementation of last year’s Valder
report into the party organisation and
structures, including questions of fund-
raising and pre-selection.
The party’s advertising agents,
Masius, will also be making a detailed
presentation of a possible campaign
strategy. Indeed, according to Liberal
federal director Tony Eggleton, plan-
ning for the election has been under
way since the end of last year and cam-
paign headquarters have already been
prepared in Melbourne.
Privately, opposition strategists con-
cede there is little prospect of their win-
ning the next election, whether it’s held
in December or March. Publicly, there
is no concession of failure. You don’t
win many votes by giving up before a
campaign has even started. In fact,
Andrew Peacock will spend much of the
next month visiting all states some of
them twice including several of the
more important marginal electorates.
He’s planning a heavy schedule of
radio and television interviews in an at-
tempt to lift what has been a fairly low
profile, with the possible exception of
the immigration debate.
And over the next few weeks the op-
position will be releasing its policies on
Trade, Resources and Energy, Science
and Technology, Sports and Recrea-
tion, agreed to at a two-day joint party
meeting in Canberra last week.
Hopefully, the release will not be ac-
companied by the public relations de-
bacle that attended the Foreign Policy


platform and the public embarrassment
over the omission of a reference to
South Africa and apartheid. In politics,
things have a habit of turning up, but
not always for the best.
For the government, of course, econ-
omic indicators could hardly be better,
with both the unemployment as well as
the inflation rates continuing to fall. It’s
here that the opposition can only wait
for something to turn up.
Peacock has already begun to lay the
groundwork for his attack during the
budget session beginning on August 21,
by arguing that the recovery is due
to “one-off’ factors the breaking
of the drought, US recovery and
the Fraser Government’s own wage
pause.
By late next year, he says, the econ-
omy could well be into recession should
the prices and incomes accord break
down.
But since, by popular acknowledge-
ment, people still vote according to the
hip-pocket nerve, that is of small com-
fort to an opposition facing an election
well before then. □
THE MEDIA
Magazine
alliance praised
by PM
THE MERGER of the South Pacific
edition of Newsweek with The Bulletin
was celebrated at a lunch at Sydney’s
Regent Hotel on July 4.
By coincidence the first day of sale of
The Bulletin in its new format was US
Independence Day.
ACP’s Kerry Packer with Westpac’s Bob White
The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke,
officially launched the magazine with a
speech to 300 businessmen, political
leaders and journalists.
Hawke described the move, in which
24 pages of the best of Newsweek are
incorporated as a separately identifiable
segment in The Bulletin each week, as
“an alliance of two independent forces
to complement the strengths of each;
and by this declaration of interdepen-
dence, the better to maintain and ensure
the independence of both.”
The Prime Minister, who was due to
come under attack at the national con-
ference of the ALP a few days later for
— among other things — his support of
the US alliance, said: “This is the sort of
alliance where Australian and Ameri-
can interests are involved that I can al-
ways endorse and support.
“Australia must maintain a coherent,
credible and realistic foreign policy, an
Washington Post Company’s Richard Simmons and Bob Hawke
approach to foreign relations which is at
once principled and sensitive, flexible
and responsive and adequate to the de-
mands of the complex and fast-chang-
ing world around us.
“The maturity required in the con-
duct of our foreign relations requires an
increasingly sophisticated public. And
this will, I believe, be further nurtured
by the product resulting from the
merger of The Bulletin and Newsweek."
The editor-in-chief of The Bulletin,
Trevor Kennedy, said that Con-
solidated Press, under the leadership of
Kerry Packer, had been in the vanguard
of virtually everything bold and in-
novative in the media industry in Aus-
tralia in recent years.
This was another bold and in-
novative step in Australian publishing.
The merger made sound sense for
many reasons, but three in particular.
■ It provided readers with a better
service.
■ It provided advertisers with a bet-
ter service.
■ It strengthened enormously The
Bulletin’s stranglehold on the weekly
current affairs market in Australia.
The president of the Washington
Post Company, Richard Simmons, said
his company had admired The Bulletin
for its aggressive coverage of domestic
affairs and its business success.
“The merger will constitute a re-
source for readers that is, in our view,
unique,” he said. “For advertisers, it
will be a resource that has no equal.”
Other senior Newsweek executives at
the launch were the president of
Newsweek International, Howard
Smith; the editor of Newsweek Inter-
national, Larry Martz; senior vice-
president and international publisher
Peter Luffman; vice-president and pub-
lisher Pacific, Shinyoku Sai; and gen-
eral manager Pacific, Art Gurwitz. □


THE LAW
Family courts
too much of
a revolution?
The bomb-damaged home unit building in which Justice Ray Watson’s wife was murdered
By WILLA McDONALD
THE SHOCK waves are still reverberat-
ing from last week’s bombing of Justice
Raymond Watson’s home, the fourth at-
tack in as many years against the Family
Court.
The attacks began with the killing of
Justice David Opas in 1980. Then, in
March this year, Justice Richard Gee’s
home was bombed and a month later a
bomb exploded in the Parramatta
(NSW) registry of the court.
These atrocities obviously are the
work of unhinged minds, but they have
drawn attention to fundamental faults
in our family law system faults which
infuriate many people but do not drive
them to murder.
Justice Watson, the latest victim, was
involved with the establishment of the
Family Court, the drafting of the law it
administers and the development of the
philosophy behind the whole family
court structure, none of which has
escaped criticism over the years.
The Family Law Act, which came
into effect in 1976, created a machinery
for the resolution of marital conflict by
the parties themselves, based heavily on
counselling. Under the Act, recourse to
a court is a last resort.
Its success is borne out by the figures.
In 1983, the court dealt with 43,000 div-
orce applications and nearly 41,000
other matters of which about 85 percent
have been or will be settled.
However, although few people
would welcome the return of the old
divorce laws (the private detectives,
“adultery raids” and lurid affidavits that
went with them) the “no fault” divorce
under the Family Law Act has been
criticised for removing the parties’ op-
portunity to air their bitterness in a
court. Since October, it has been pos-
sible to receive a divorce order by post.
Margaret Topham, family therapist
and president of the Family Therapist
Institute of Australia, feels that much of
the anger which the husband and wife
feel for each other, but are prevented
from expressing in court, is then di-
rected to matters which the court will
hear, particularly custody of, and access
to, the children.
According to Trevor Nyman, a Syd-
ney lawyer with considerable experi-
ence in the Family Law jurisdiction, the
parties to the marriage may see the real
issues in the divorce litigation as infidel-
ity or cruelty, but the court may find
these irrelevant to the questions with
which it has to deal - the division of
family property and the custody of chil-
dren. He says the parties are left
enraged over issues which are never re-
solved because they are not relevant to
the court.
Professor David Hambly, Australian
Law Reform Commissioner in charge of
the reference on matrimonial law,
believes the changes in the family law
may have been too quick and are not
meeting people’s needs. The passing of
the Act required a complete and sudden
restructuring of the whole family law
system.
The marital relationship is very com-
plicated, he says, and it is difficult for
the parties to the marriage “to separate
out the stress and pain in their own sit-
uation and how the legal system has
treated them ... Rightly or wrongly,
there is a lot of self-justification. The
more you think about it, the more
blameworthy your spouse becomes and
the more wronged you are in your own
eyes.”
But, a point on which all are agreed
is that the family court is understaffed
and overburdened. Every day the courts
are jammed with people, standing and
sitting, waiting their turn for the court to
decide the fate of their families.
There isn’t enough money the
courts are housed mostly in unsuitable,
commercial buildings which make it
difficult to provide proper security for
court staff. It is not uncommon for a
judge to have to ride in a lift with a
party to a matter in which he or she has
just made a decision.
There are 43 judges and 87 counsel-
lors, part of the total court staff of 452
Australia-wide which deals with the
enormous workload. In the registries in
the larger cities there may be an 18-

month wait before a contested custody
or property matter can be dealt with by
the court.
John Wade, senior lecturer at Sydney
University Law School, says: “The
physical environment and insufficient
funds create for the litigants, the feeling
of being a name on a list, sitting in a
cattle shed before appearing before a
judge who doesn’t have time to hear the
case properly.”
He says morale among court staff is
low and affects their efficiency. Con-
stantly dealing with people in crisis can
be exhausting.
The judges and practitioners have
the added strain of working in a juris-
diction which is looked down upon by
colleagues in other jurisdictions. It is a
common belief that family law requires
fewer technical legal skills than other
fields and the work brings in less
money.
A person trained in rigid, legal reas-
oning and the dusty tomes of the law is
likely to run when faced with a client
who weeps, rings in the middle of the
night and who changes his or her in-
structions frequently.
It is often said that marital problems
should be removed from the courts alto-
gether, although the proponents provide
no workable alternative. Wade believes
that neighborhood centres, mediation
centres and other proposals aimed at
getting parties talking and removing the
conflict from the adversarial grasp of
the courts, will work only with people
who want to be counselled. There will
always be a certain percentage
who must have their decision
imposed upon them. “You
can’t escape a coercive el-
ement at some stage,” he says.
Ignorance in people
involved with the system has
also been blamed for causing
unnecessary frustration and
anger. For many, says Wade,
there is an expectation that
“after I go to court a judge
will decide who the good guy
is and who the bad guy is and
the judge will say publicly that
my wife or husband is at fault
and all will be justified in the
eyes of my neighbor.” But,
that does not happen.
Nor are many people
aware that marriage break-
down, for most, is a financial
disaster. “One income
stretches to two,” says Pro-
fessor Hambly. “The house
goes to one or is sold .. .
People tend to assume in
some way, especially if they
regard themselves as not
having been to blame, that
they ought to carry on life as if
nothing had happened.
Neither the court nor the system can
create assets that don’t exist for the
couple.”
He adds that, if a couple cannot
come to their own arrangement as re-
gards the children, any arrangement
imposed by the court is bound to be
“lopsided and will involve a degree of
stress.”
Justice Watson said, in a recent
newspaper interview: “It is the lack of
equality between men and women in
our relationships that is the problem.
“Men have been walking out of mar-
riages since time began. However, the
patriarchal concept of marriage, in
which the woman must obey the man, is
gone.
“Now that there are supporting
mothers’ pensions, women don’t have to
put up with the trash in a marriage and
they can walk out too. Men are a bit
shocked by this and they don’t know
where to hit.”
But, looking at the family law system
as a whole avoids the fact that all the
violent attacks on the Family Court
seem to have been aimed at the Par-
ramatta registry.
John Wade describes what he calls
the “racial thesis” for the bombings. The
Parramatta registry is situated in an area
of great racial mix where there is a
greater likelihood of a clash between the
system and people from another culture
who do not have an understanding of
the Australian legal system.
“For a court to tell a Turkish father
that he can’t have access to his children
because he spanks them so hard can be
intolerable.” But, he warned against
adopting the thesis lightly.
Some have held the judges generally
to blame for the problems. Wade has
heard it argued that the passing of the
Family Law Act suddenly required the
appointment of more than 40 judges,
when only one or two judges, in the nor-
mal course, would be appointed each
year. The argument goes that probably
only 10 were truly qualified.
He says that such “personal” attacks
sometimes arise from the rivalry be-
tween the State courts and the Family
Court (federal). When the Family Court
came into existence it took over a sub-
stantial area of work already being done
by the State courts. “There are some
state courts,” Wade says, “that want to
put the boot in and put it in very hard.”
Wade warns against such verbal attacks
claiming that they foster a “ghetto men-
tality” in a court already isolated from
the other jurisdictions.
So what is to be done to stem the
violence and restore people’s faith in
the family law system?
Trevor Nyman believes an immedi-
ate improvement would be to restore the
formality of the court by restoring wigs
and gowns, increasing the size of the
court rooms, raising the height of the
bench where the judge sits and
reintroducing the practice of standing
when addressing the judge.
He believes that such symbols help to
clarify the division between authority
and the litigant and help the person be-
fore the court to accept any decision
handed down.
Nyman says that the judges are too
often seen by the parties as part of the
conflict rather than the figure which re-
solves it.
Wade says the judicial costumes and
the distance of the judge from the liti-
gants is also thought to act as a disguise
for the judge.
Other solutions which have been
proposed include the rotation of judges
to help resolve the problem of the status
of the Family Court at the judicial level
and give the judges a break from the
demanding and exhausting family law
work; a publicity campaign on the role
of the court and what people can expect
when they come into contact with it;
greater publicity on the need for early
counselling in marital problems; better
instructions in the law schools for in-
tending practitioners to help remove the
stigma of the jurisdiction and to help
them cope more adequately with clients
in crisis situations; and, finally more
money for the system, quickly.
It is doubtful there is any single sol-
ution to the family law problem, but it is
time for public debate on the effective-
ness of the court and the philosophy be-
hind it. □


ELECTIONS
Democrats to
gain, Labor to
lose ground
By MALCOLM MACKERRAS
THE FEDERAL Government would
lose ground in an election for half the
Senate and would fail to gain control of
the Upper House, according to the latest
Morgan Gallup Poll.
On the poll figures the Australian
Democrats would become more firmly
entrenched. I assume that the forth-
coming Senate election will take place
early in 1985 (although I admit to the
possibility of late 1984).
The present 64-member Senate is
composed of 30 Labor senators, 28 Lib-
eral-Nationals, 5 Democrats and the In-
dependent, Brian Harradine.
The balance of power thus is held by
Harradine plus the five Democrats
Don Chipp (Vic), Jack Evans (WA),
Janine Haines (SA), Michael Macklin
(Qld) and Colin Mason (NSW). Of
these, Evans, Macklin and Mason face
re-election at a half-Senate poll.
And it will be a half-Senate election.
Contrary to some journalistic predic-
tions, there will not be a double dissol-
ution. Everything Prime Minister Bob
Hawke has said publicly points to a
House of Representatives plus half-Sen-
ate election.
Labor could get a majority in the
Senate (39 seats) if it could win in every
mainland state four of the seven
vacancies to be contested. Such a result
is possible but not likely.
The latest Morgan Gallup Poll on
Senate voting intentions, taken during
June, shows Labor in every state with-
out the magic 50 percent need to pick up
four seats.
On those figures the Democrats have
a reasonably good chance of winning
the seventh vacancy in all six states.
Were that to happen the Democrats
would have eight senators one in each
of New South Wales, Queensland,
Western Australia and Tasmania and
two in Victoria and South Australia.

Although such a result would sound
marvellous for the Democrats there
would be a headache for them because
every one of their senators would have a
short term expiring on June 30, 1988.
With seven from each state to be
elected in 1985 the quota for election
will be 12.5 percent. Since, according to
the Morgan Gallup Poll, there is no
state where the Democrats have that
level of support any Democrats elected
in 1985 will fill the seventh vacancy
after the distribution of preferences.
The first six elected in each state in
1985 will have terms expiring on June
30, 1991. The seventh elected will have a
term expiring on June 30, 1988. □

‘Slave labor’
allegations
in workshops
By ANTHONY HILL
SOCIAL SECURITY minister Senator
Don Grimes has ordered an upgrading
in the surveillance of sheltered work-
shops for the handicapped following
disclosures of fraud and mismanage-
ment.
His department has uncovered two
serious cases where, according to
Grimes, boards of directors have
realised too late that they have been
“taken for a ride by unscrupulous
conmen.”
In one case, the management of a
NSW workshop subsidised by the com-
monwealth employed two able-bodied
family members, one of whom spent
most of his time travelling in South Aus-
tralia on a substantial salary.
This particular racket has been
stopped. But, according to Grimes,
there is disquiet that similar malpractice
is going on; that too many sheltered
workshops are getting into trouble and
have to be bailed out because of poor
management.
So far, Grimes says, the department
has lacked the resources to police the
sheltered workshop program although
this arm of the department is being
strengthened and special management
teams are being formed.
The disquiet extends to the way
many sheltered workshops are run or
not run for the benefit of the handi-
capped. Too often, it seems, the dis-
abled are not being encouraged to use
them as a training ground before taking
a job in open employment. Instead,
fears of losing the security of a Shel-
tered Employment Allowance are being
used to keep people in work that often is
demeaning and even exploitive. In
some cases, workshops are paying em-
ployees as little as $l a week in addition
to the allowance.
Proposals to reform the sheltered
workshop program will form a key part
of the interim recommendations of the
Handicapped Programs Review, set up
by Grimes last September and due to
report during the budget session. It is
one of the most comprehensive reviews
of a welfare program for many years
and major changes are predicted in
commonwealth-funded services for the
handicapped.
With spending on the handicapped
running at more than $1.4 billion a year
of which $1.2 billion is allocated for
the invalid pension officials are begin


ning to talk of a new deal for the dis-
abled.
Over the past few months, two three-
member review teams have visited 65
cities and towns in all states, holding
public meetings and informal dis-
cussion groups in an attempt to consult
with not only the larger benevolent or-
ganisations but also the handicapped
themselves.
Of the 1650 written or oral sub-
missions received, nearly two-thirds
were from individuals many of whom
were being asked for the first time what
they wanted from the system.
Stories ranged from a six-month wait
for a hearing aid to the woman whose
boss told her he had to “throw up in the
gutter” because he “couldn’t bear to
touch her.”
Grimes has said he will be looking
closely at the question of sheltered em-
ployment and the Victorian Govern-
ment is planning an inquiry. The ACTU
has been approached to co-operate with
such an investigation and it can hardly
refuse since its charter speaks of the
need for sheltered workshop payments
to be “commensurate with the work car-
ried out.”
In fact the charter goes further and
calls on the workshops to be regulated
and supervised properly, with the dis-
abled taking some part in their manage-
ment. It is a particularly relevant clause,
since sheltered workshops in Victoria
and some other states are excluded from
award wages and conditions and a
Victorian Sheltered Workshop Em-
ployees’ Union (VSWEU) is being
formed to press for changes.
The commonwealth subsidises about
200 sheltered workshops where condi-
tions vary enormously. Some employ
the disabled in furniture-making, bike
repairs and even circuit board assembly
and pay rates based on an award or pro-
ductivity. Others are devoted to assemb-
ling clothes pegs or tying knots in abat-
toir ropes.
The formation of the VSWEU re-
flects the growing mood of self-advo-
Don Grimes campaigning: talk of a new deal for the disabled
NEWS LIMITED
cacy among handicapped people con-
tent no longer to rely on patronage
of well-meaning officials or volunteers.
Three years ago, a group of intellec-
tually disadvantaged people in Victoria
formed an organisation known as Re-
inforce. Branches have since been
formed in Tasmania and Canberra and
the group plans to send nine members
and five support staff to Washington
this month for the first international
conference on the disadvantaged.
The trend towards greater out-
spokenness and self-help by the dis-
abled was noted by the review teams.
One result is the acquisition of more
group houses where up to six handicap-
ped people may live reasonably inde-
pendently in the suburbs, usually with a
full or part-time residential care worker.
Then there are other disabled
persons for whom institutional care
provides a degree of security and cer-
tainty of tenure.
It comes down to a question of
choice for the handicapped. For in-
stance, it means encouraging parents to
place handicapped children where pos-
sible in the normal school system.
Even this involves problems. One
Sydney mother who spent S6OOO for her
intellectually disabled son to attend a
regular secondary school applied for
the Handicapped Child’s Allowance of
$B5 a month. She was told that because
the boy was going to a normal school he
could not by definition be sufficiently
handicapped to qualify.
Educational discrimination can take
more subtle forms: refusing to supply
special resources in country schools un-
less there are enough handicapped chil-
dren; the lack of interpreters and
notetakers for the deaf at some universi-
ties and TAFE colleges. Then there is
the obligation on parents with children
at special schools to engage in constant
fund-raising, a burden which the review
teams found was resented increasingly.
One of the most distressing cases en-
countered by the review team was in a
country town hundreds of kilometres
from the nearest capital city hospital.
A couple attended a meeting with a
six-month-old baby suffering from pro-
found facial disfigurement, including a
split skull. The child would need regular
surgery for at least the next six years
which would mean constant travel and
board in the city while maintaining a
home in the country for the family’s
other three children.
All this on a cleaner's pay. The
couple sold their car and motor cycle to
raise money. While they received some
assistance under the Isolated Patients
Travel and Accommodation Scheme,
they were refused the Handicapped
Child’s Allowance because a common-
wealth medical officer had not seen the
baby. The problem has been rectified. □


DEFENCE
Readiness among the lambs
By JOHN STACKHOUSE*
WOMEN’S PROTEST tents
huddle incongruously on a
lawn at the entrance to the
Defence Research Centre at
Salisbury, in South Australia.
The peace slogans call for de-
struction of nuclear weapons
and for the government to
spend money on the poor and
hungry of the world rather
than on defence.
Some 20 tents are in the
cluster but only one or two
demonstrators are visible. The
2700 scientists, engineers,
technical officers and other
workers passing through the
solid security gates pay little
attention to the pickets.
The centre is the most im-
portant installation of the
shadowy Defence Science and
Technology Organisation
(DSTO), one of the biggest
employers of civilians in the Defence
department’s empire. Behind high wire
fences, the centre’s three laboratories
occupy a scatter of small brick buildings
that once comprised Australia’s biggest
munitions factory.
Between the cottages are Hans
Heysen gums, fruit trees and green grass
speckled with the gold of the soursops
that add color to winter on the Adelaide
plain.
Keeping the grass down are sheep.
Running with them at this time of the
year are tottery, white lambs a symbol
of the peace and gentleness that the
women at the gates are preaching.
But, since World War 11, this spread
of 1200 ha has been dedicated to war.
There was explosives and munitions
manufacture initially, then the guided-
weapons establishment (a joint venture
with Britain postwar) and now scientific
research and engineering development
designed to extend the capabilities of
the Australian Defence Force.
The DSTO is one of the keys to an
independent defence capability. It is
built on the premise that conditions in
Australia and the military problems
these generate are different from those
of any other part of the world.
If we are to buy imported weaponry,
for instance, it will come either from
Europe or the United States. The major
defence priority of these suppliers is the

electronic decoy system away from a ship
under threat of attack by a missile such as Exocet
or Harpoon. It is seen as part of
a complete anti-missile defence system, fooling
the enemy through radar transmissions

(NATO) alliance. By definition, the
weapons systems are designed for use in
cold northern climates against a mas-
sive Russian attack.
Australia’s defence needs are per-
ceived to be directly related to the en-
virons, possibly in the continent itself.
Our front line would be in the tropics.
Conditions could be either desert or
tropic bush. And the adversary could
well be small groups of harassers
operating in many places separated by
hundreds, if not thousands, of kilo-
metres.
Research work has established that
not only land conditions are different.
The seas are warmer and often shallow.
Coral reefs complicate navigation for
both ourselves and any potential en-
emy. The tropical atmosphere, too, has
characteristics entirely different from
the cool and temperate northern hemi-
sphere regions. Even our communica-
tions would differ. They have to take
into account a relatively underdevel-
oped infrastructure, vulnerability of re-
lay links such as microwave towers and
future satellite stations and radio-
propagation conditions which differ
markedly from those of any other part
of the world.
It is against this background that
Henry d’Assumpcao, chairman of the
centre’s management committee (and
director of the Electronics Research
Laboratory), comments on the presence
of the women at the gate.
“We who know are horrified at the
prospect of nuclear war,” he told a sem-
inar organised for a visiting press
group.
“Australia is not involved with nu-
clear weapons. But, when it comes to
national security, our nation is safer
with our weapons in our hand rather
than standing naked and helpless. Our
role is to support the armed services
who give us this protection.”
The press visit was the first look at
the top-secret Salisbury establishment.
The doors to the three laboratories
Electronics Research, Advanced Engin-
eering and Weapons System Research
were thrown open.
These establishments, together with
the Aeronautical Research Laboratory
at Fishermens Bend, Melbourne, and
the Food Laboratory at Scottsdale in
Tasmania and test centres throughout
Australia, make up the major part of the
DSTO.
d’Assumpcao and his colleagues ex-
plained that their main function was to
provide specific support for the defence
forces, such as testing new bombs and
munitions or developing and adapting
sensors and communications. About a
quarter of their effort is devoted to basic
research and development, which is
providing some ingenious weaponry
and back-up for the forces. It also pays
up our dues in the scientific agreements
with friendly countries such as the US,
Britain and Canada, with whom we ex-
change information.
*John Stackhouse flew to Adelaide and back in

UNLIKE the cold northern oceans, our
shallow continental shelf seas play
many tricks on navigators and sub-
mariners. Coral reefs, layers of warm
water and the swirl of currents are a
marine jungle through which submar-
ines can prowl like tigers.
We have learned that northern anti-
submarine detection systems are inad-
equate when we probe the waters
around Australia. The warm surface
layer, for instance, can provide a screen
under which submarines hide. Sound
waves, the best way of detecting under-
water objects, bend and bounce in
strange ways. These are major reasons
why a considerable part of our defence
effort is concentrated on anti-submarine
technologies.
One of our biggest successes has
been Barra. The system consists of two
parts: the Barra sonobuoy, which we de-
veloped, and the computers and signal
processors which our British partners in
the project have built.
The sonobuoy is a cylinder carried in
a patrol aircraft such as the Royal Aus-
tralian Air Force’s P3C Orions, which
the crew drops in a pattern to listen
underwater. It is an intensely compli-
cated piece of mechanical and electron-
ic gear that has to survive a drop from a
high-speed aircraft into the sea, extend
its array of underwater microphones at
a pre-determined depth and then relay
the eavesdropping back.
Barra not only performs the tricky
mechanical task near-perfectly but also
passes on much more information than
equivalent American or European
buoys. It has become a key part of the
NATO anti-submarine effort. About
$l2O million worth of the throwaway
buoys have been sold and they look like
being a steady earner for years.
The same expertise in listening
underwater has led to the development
of Mulloka, our new shipborne sonar.
Unlike Barra which is passive (it just
listens), Mulloka punches out sound sig-
nals that return from underwater
objects such as submarines or mines. It’s
an idea navies have used for decades.
But, in our conditions, Mulloka simply
works better than do foreign systems.
The ocean is a cacophony. There is
physical noise generated by waves or
water crashing on beaches or coral.
There are singing whales and beeping
dolphins. There are also many ships,
most of which are friendly. The art of
sonar surveillance is in detecting from
this orchestra the faint sounds made by
deliberately quietened intruders. The
experience gained in Barra and
Mulloka is being applied with some
ultra-modern technological trickery to
what are called towed sonar arrays.
The idea began with the tubes carry-
ing microphones that oil companies use
for undersea seismic surveys. They have
been developed to the stage where war-
ships can tow them at depths of up to
300 m in lengths of a kilometre, provi-
ding a new degree of sensitivity and ac-
curacy to underwater surveillance.
Early models had problems: the
tubes were filled with kerosene and
sharks bit them. They were also of com-
paratively large diameters and this
required huge winches. Australian tech-
nology has produced thinner and
stronger towed arrays and miniaturised
their complex electronics.
The new Australian towed array will
be made out of the high-strength plastic
Kevlar, woven like rope and maintain-
ing the important neutral buoyancy fac-
tor with flotation cables. The hydro-
phones and electronic switches and am-
plifiers which speed up and simplify
data transmission down a single line
have been miniaturised into roughly the
diameter of an adult finger. To do this
the Electronics Research Laboratory
has designed its own very large-scale in-
tegrated (VLSI) chip. In this, it is
exercising design skills and also making
an important contribution to the Aus-
tralian VLSI project sponsored by the
CSIRO. Sharks still bite it but it may be
more than they can chew.
Advanced anti-submarine warfare
techniques have spun off other major
projects. The Ikara anti-submarine mis-
sile torpedo launcher also has sold well.
The use of rocket propellants in this sys-
tem was a major contributor to the
Winnin anti-ship missile decoy.
The other part of the system, sorting
between a multitude of confusing sig-
nals to determine the ones that count,
can be traced in the data-processing
the key to the Jindalee radar which is
expected to go into service soon.
Another fascinating electronics de-
velopment is the jammer-resistant radio
communications system for the navy,
also exciting interest worldwide.

warfare and electronic
counter-measures (EW and
ECM), hostile forces are
turning to the use of
jammers to swamp radio
signals. With a fleet at sea,
an aircraft can shadow the
ships at a distance, identify
the radio frequencies they
are using and blast out
kilowatts of energy to
drown out their traffic.
That’s the EW side. The
standard ECM is to change
radio frequencies at ran-
dom to try to beat the
jammer. This has led to the
electronic counter counter-
measure (ECCM) riposte
of making the jammer as
agile as the transmitters it
is attacking.
The new Australian
measure of dodging this in-
terference is to speed up
the frequency changes to
such an extent that the ad-
vanced jammer cannot
keep pace. The jammer
then has to adopt a less
efficient strategy and trans-
mit broadband inter-
ference. Because it is
blanketing so many
frequencies, the jamming noise on a
single frequency is much less and the
normal signal can penetrate the arti-
ficial static.
The technique the Australian device
uses relies on synchronisation within a
millisecond (/j 0 00 of a second) between
transmitter and receiver. This is not
only advanced and ingenious electron-
ics but also offers a significant advan-
tage: a single transmitter can be used
simultaneously for four separate trans-
missions.
A MAJOR PART of the work of the
DSTO is to extend the capability and
the length of service of the defence
force’s principal items of equipment.
This can cover such techniques as
life-extension for RAAF aircraft, no-
tably the Mirage and the Macchi
trainers, but also repairing and rebuild-
ing items which long ago went out of
production in the country of origin.
This work has included maintenance
of naval radars originally supplied by
Philips of the Netherlands, various
items of US equipment and the rocket
motors of the Matra missiles on the Mir-
age which long since have passed their
storage life without being fired in train-
ing or in anger.
The RAAF offers some good
examples of extending the capability of
weapons systems.

intention of using their equivalent
planes in the same way. This has
involved matching the older electronics
of the F- 111 with the digital electronics
of the Harpoon and also investigating
weapons release in wind tunnels and in
flying tests. For the latter, a special
mechanism was developed to allow
dummy Harpoons to be dropped in-
stead of real ones at $600,000 a shot. It
was conceived, built and put into suc-
cessful tests within a few months.
In the army, the overseas cost of
maintenance and test equipment for
laser rangefinders in the Leopard tanks
was put at $3 million a unit. The
Salisbury boffins developed for a frac-
tion of the cost an equally good unit
that can be used on other laser range-
finders as well.
The army is also taking a keen inter-
est in infra-red surveillance equipment
that uses radiated heat from persons
and objects to image them in special re-
ceivers. American and European equip-
ment generally uses systems with a nar-
row view, largely because of the require-
ments of massed armored warfare
which is the scenario for NATO.
Australian conditions require a 60-
degree field of view with a high degree
of detail.
Salisbury scientists set up their
equipment in Sydney recently and
photographed the harbor at 2 am. The
results show detailed images of the
bridge and harbor traffic. The intelli-
gence value of infra-red is demonstrated
in images of ships where the radiated
heat of the object shows a difference be-
tween old and repaired plating on the
superstructure. As the devices are pas-
sive they image the heat which all
objects radiate ordinary camouflage
is useless. Analysts can pick the differ-
ence between vehicles which have been
used recently or are cold.
And, in the civilian field, they can
play a major role in determining the
seat of bushfires through smoke and
cloud or whether there are intruders in a
darkened warehouse or encampment.
The need to create weapons also
arises. One of these is the Karinga clus-
ter bomb, rated superior to others devel-
oped overseas. The 750 kg bomb, which
can be carried on the underwing pylons
of the F- 111 and the new F-18s, is
dropped at low level and lays a path of
destruction over a wide area. It is de-
signed to attack such targets as vehicle
parks and fuel or supply dumps through
shedding about 1000 bomblets in a pre-
determined pattern (see diagram).
To study the way the bomblets fell, a
mini-movie camera was designed and
engineered to fit inside one of the
bomblets and dropped in test runs.
Karinga has cost about $l7 million
to develop. It hasn’t been put into pro-
duction because we have no immediate
need to deploy the weapon but this
could be done quickly. □

SPORT
The Iron Man of football
plays his last Test
They call Ray Price Mr Perpetual Motion. For more than a decade he has run and
tackled his way around the rugby union and league grounds of the world. Ron Saw
profiles the indestructible man who, on Saturday, played his last international.
THIS, I’M afraid, will be not so much a
story about Ray Price, the great rugby
league footballer, as an outpouring of
hero-worship from one of his most awe-
stricken admirers.
Wrong, I know and have known
since my first flesh-eating sub-editor
showed me how to write the facts in or-
der of importance, of objectivity.
But how on earth can I, can anybody
with even a passing interest in rugby
league, pretend to be objective about
Price?
I, raised in an Australian rules state,
know almost nothing of the science of
league; yet for almost as long as I can
remember for the past eight years,
anyway I have needed only to watch a
football match involving the Parramatta
team to become lost in admiration for a
comparatively small, light, bearded man
who seems to take on the whole oppo-
sing 13 by himself.
The number of tackles he gets
through in -a match is simply bewilder-
ing; and here it should be pointed out
that a tackle in league or union is not
the almost formal grabbing of waist or
sweater or, at most, shoulder charge that
it is in Aussie rules or soccer but, in its
classic form, a dive, low, at a ball-car-
rier’s ankles; something that changes
him in a trice from a charging jugger-
naut into a squirming, jerking heap at
one with the mud and oafishness.
But to tackle head-on is to risk fright-
ful punishment or, at best, merciful
death, from pistoning knees, flying
boots, defensive elbows and, you can’t
help feeling, gnashing teeth; and Price,
who seems to be making these terrible
tackles all the time, is not so much a
human being as a creature of breaks and
bruises, cuts and dislocations, blood
and guts.
Price has played for Parramatta and
Australia at both league (the pro game)
and union (theoretically amateur).
Among his games were 23 league Tests
for Australia and last Saturday’s was the
last.
Now, he says and you can’t help
thinking of Lionel Rose or Tony
The Warrior: John Elliott’s award-winning shot of Ray Price, NSW-Queensland, 1983


NEVILLE WALLER
After years of beating England (left) and battling Queensland (centre) Price has handed over his Test jumper to Wayne Pearce (right)
Mundine or even Nellie Melba now I
can get to see my family once in a while.
His wife, a pretty blonde named
Christine, and their children, Benjamin,
6, and Kasey-Anne, 4, haven’t seen as
much as they should see of Price.
Long, or so it must seem, before he
played league he was one of the greatest
breakaway forwards ever to play union
for Australia.
The job of the breakaway, and the
diagram on page 42 may make it rather
clearer than my scholarly terms, is to get
up and get the ball away from the oppo-
sing five-eighth or centres, possibly
maiming the opposing halfback on the
way. If the occasional hulking forward
gets in the way it’s handy to be able to
dispose of him, too.
Price disposed of them, long and
short and tall. He perfected a sort of
judo toss called the Cumberland throw
with which, pulling opponents over his
knee, he could handle hulking 16-
stoners as if dandling infants. It was, he
says, “a way of bringing the big blokes
back to my size.”
(He is about W/ 2 stone and not quite
6ft, which is almost dainty for a union
forward. Even for league, a faster, some
say cleverer game, he is a lightweight.)
“I still use it occasionally in league,”
he says, “but you’ve got to be careful.
Some referees interpret it the wrong
way.”
Anyway, in union, or just plain rug-
by, as they smugly call it, in 1974 Price
had played against the All Blacks and
come away from it with a broken hand.
A few months later, by then 1975, he
was playing against Scotland. He put
himself into hospital to have the hand
patched, and there, in bed, he read a
Reader’s Digest story about hernias:
probably something like How I Made
Friends, Lost Weight, Found God and
Discovered My Hernia.
As he read he felt around ... a burn-
ing sensation here, a swelling there ...
ouch ... God almighty! Maybe HE had
a hernia. He had. The doctor who sewed
him up told him: “You’re lucky you
didn’t get a kick in the crotch: you could
have died from it.”
Price was playing four weeks later.
In the following year he was snapped
up by the Parramatta league club
(known, not very attractively, as Eels,
Parramatta meaning, in Abo dialect,
“Place of eels”). And a jobbing carpen-
ter and amateur footballer-cum-punch-
ing bag became a highly-paid pro. And
punching bag: from his earliest years
Price was a glutton for punishment.
Now he played lock, league having
no breakaways. The lock’s responsibil-
ity is the opposing five-eighth, centres or
half, as in union. He is a utility player, a
cover defender who, in a flash, can be-
come a speedy, penetrating back.
Price’s tackling, his cheerful viol-
ence, was once examined mathematical-
ly by a football diagnosis team. It found
that in just 18 matches he had made 475
tackles. And, as usual, he looked like it.
There is no really accurate way of
enumerating the injuries Price has
suffered; the breaks, sprains, strains,
bruises, cuts, dislocations, gouges, corks
and concussions; from ankles to calves
to knees, thighs, crotch, belly, ribs, col-
larbones, shoulders, ears, eyes, nose and
scalp he has taken far more than the
average heavyweight, more than the av-
erage fighting bull.
Two days before the last Test I told
him that he could expect the usual cam-
eramen waiting for the usual pictures of
Pricey in a mess of blood and guts.
“Ar, not this time, mate,” he said.
And, incredibly, he seemed to mean it,
seemed to mean that your league
footballer was really a decent sort of
joker doing his best for the people who
paid him and not much interested in
making life hard for a bloke doing the
same.
He must have known something. It
was a dreary Test, the only vaguely exci-
ting aspect being Price carried from the
field on the shoulders of his captain,
Wally Lewis, when it was over.
Astonishingly there was no blood,
even though the Poms were thrashed 20-
7. They tend to let loose a few punches
and elbows when they look like losing
but there was the almost unbelievable
sight of one of them patting an Austra-
lian on the back for a clever bit of play;
and as far as could be seen nobody, not
even Price, was bloodied.
Next day, to make the anti-climax
complete, he went with Parramatta to
play Canberra and Canberra won.
After that he went on to the snow to
unwind: he had no need to cool off.
And as if to add insult to tedium the


How league and union teams line out: Price played breakaway in union and lock in league
NSW selectors that night omitted Price
from NSW’s final State of Origin team
to play Queensland. And the only com-
forting thing was that it may have saved
him from leading NSW to the kind of
shellacking given to the Poms.
Price himself is no angel and is not
above putting in a swift smack in the
eye once in while. But he’s not a dirty
player. His violence is of the kind ap-
proved by people such as Rex Mossop
and Bob Fulton, who say that league is
not a game for maniacs any more than
it’s a game for girls, that the gladiator
syndrome is what makes a player, and
thus the game, popular.
Price is sought, too, by Messrs Mojo,
the people whose TV commercials tell
people that they feel like a Toohey’s or
two and that mothers who slather their
families with Meadow Lea margarine
orta be congratulated. They want him,
obviously, because he’s such a spectacu-
lar player, because his play, typified in a
real-match attacking run, crashing,
spinning, jinking, stepping, is so
exhausting to watch that anyone would
want revival-through-ale.
No, his violence is not reprehensible.
A Sydney league five-eighth (“Don’t put
me name in, for Christ’s sake. It’s hard
enough to play against him as it is”)
summed it up this way:
“He’s the sort of bloke who’s always
there to balls things up for you just
when you think you’re maybe getting
through a hole in the defence. I’m not
actually scared of Pricey he’s not a
dirty bugger like some but every-
body’s got to ... I mean everybody
from fullback to halfback to your
winger to your forwards, fer Chrissake
... everybody’s got to look out for
him.”
Price is NOT out there upholding the
dignity of Parramatta or of the working-
man against the silvertails as the cliche-
grabbers so often suggest. He’s out there
to make his life better. He likes playing
football and if somebody pays him a lot
of money to do it, well whacko!
And he does like league. He likes it
more than union.
“League’s by far the better game,” he
says. “You don’t get the injuries you do
in union.” That being the case, God
help the rah-rahs. “It’s faster and it’s a
better game to watch. And to play, come
to that.”
It’s an argument that will get no-
where in a hurry. It is much safer to
agree that football is like beer: none of
it is bad.
Last week Les Boyd, the Manly sec-
ond-rower who was rubbed out for 15
months for gouging, swore bitterly that
league was not as exciting as Aussie
rules.
I say nothing. But I think that was so
much hogwash, about as sensible as
comparing cricket with croquet. All of
them are marvellous games; and a fast-
hands backline movement is just as ex-
citing to some as a bullet-like, 30m pass
to a full-forward or a square cut to the
fence or .... or whatever it is they do
with those balls and hoops ... is to an-
other.
The price that Price has been paying
is his separation from his family.
“My wife doesn’t bag the game,” he
says, “but I wouldn’t really blame her if
she did. I mean, we go into camp for
weeks at a time, months if big games
and Tests come close together . . .
(“Camp” in this case meant the Cam-
perdown Travelodge. Every camp
should be so rugged.)
“Well, at night you can run your own
race. I go home every night, except for
the last two or three before a Test when
we’re getting right down to the hard
stuff. But you can’t blame the wives for
going crook.”
There was even a time when Price
junior called his father not Daddy or
Pop but “Ray Price,” aping the auto-
graph hunters who used to knock at the
door of Price’s home at George’s Hall, a
south-western suburb.
Certainly Chris Price would prefer to
see her husband in his own business
which, he says, is his ambition or in
something like his present job.
He is sales manager for Davco, the
people who make ...
“Adhesives for carpets, ceramics,
tiles” he goes into his sales talk, his
eyes suddenly alight, the battered face
smiling “slate, tennis courts. They’ve
been bloody good to me.
“I’m still on contract to Parramatta
but I don’t finish up with much money
that way. The tax man takes most of it.
“But Davco pays me good money
and I don’t mind working hard for
Davco. It’s a bit like football: I mean, if
somebody’s going to pay you good
money to play you don’t mind busting
your arse for them.”
“So how d’you feel how does your
wife feel about all your injuries?”
“Well, there’s nothing much she can
do about it.”
You couldn’t blame her if she felt
like a Toohey’s or two or a slug of med-
icinal brandy or a sniff of sal-volatile.
But she won’t have to feel that way
much longer.
That, touch wood, was Pricey’s last
Test. And, Pricey: You ... orta be ...
con-grat-ulated. □


TENNIS
Superbrat,
the flawed
perfectionist
By ROBERT DARROCH
HE’S THE player everyone loves to
hate. Superbrat. Megamouth. With that
petulant lower lip, blazing eyes, wild
temper and a vocabulary of on-court
abuse that can reduce the toughest offi-
cials to sobs, he’s universally seen as the
worst thing that has happened to the
once-proper game of tennis since
Wimbledon went professional.
He’s also the best. At 25, he is at the
peak of his powers and virtually unbeat-
able. “Awesome” was the
word which press and tele-
vision commentators used
most to describe his play
last week at the world’s
most coveted titles.
But why, oh why, ask
lovers of the game, doesn’t
someone give him a swift
cuff over the ear? Why
didn’t his father do some-
thing about his behaviour?
He did. John McEnroe
junior is his father’s son in
more ways than one. If you
want to know why
Superbrat acts as he does,
you don’t have to look
much further than John
McEnroe senior. And then
only as far as Mrs McEnroe.
At the age of two John junior was in
a park near his home in leafy
Douglaston, New York, catching balls
thrown by his aggressive father. The first
racquet was thrust into a willing hand at
four. He was brilliant at all sport at
school (and excelled at his studies, too).
His father used to shout
abuse at any basketball ref-
eree who dared penalise
junior.
John senior grew up the
hard way on the streets of
New York, later working
his way through a Jesuit
school and finding a post
in a prestigous Park Aven-
ue law firm. “I always tried
very hard,” he once said. “I
think John gets that from
me.”
Part of John junior’s
disdain for the establish-
ment and the polite way of
doing things also stems
from a father who had to
learn the trappings of be-
ing a gentleman and re-
gards them even now as in-
cidental to what’s most im-
portant in life, which is
winning. “All our kids got
the same instructions,”
said John senior: ‘Play
your best. Don’t quit.’ ”
John junior showed his
determination to succeed
and to impress his
parents from an early
age. He reached the semi-
finals of a local junior tour-
nament at 11 years of age
two weeks after his first
proper game of tennis.
“His hand and eye co-ordi-
nation was uncanny,” recalled one of
his first teachers. McEnroe won his first
tournament six weeks after his first
game.
His parents made sure that he had
every opportunity to exploit his obvious
talent. They arranged for him to be
coached by Australia’s Harry Hopman
and enrolled junior in the district’s best
tennis club. He was a veteran of the US
junior tennis circuit by 14.
Though a boisterous lad, he did not
always have a penchant for disputing
line calls. He used to “throw” points if
he thought an opponent had been
robbed but coaches and parents talked
him out of that trait. “I was brought up
to be serious,” he said.
McEnroe’s rise through the
junior tennis ranks culminated in 1977
when, at the age of 18, he became the
first person to reach the Wimbledon
singles semi-finals from the qualifying
rounds.
His mother, who is known (and
laughingly admits it) as “The Wicked
Witch of the West,” was there to cheer
him on.
It had not taken long for him to pick
up the combative attitude to his chosen
game. “John is a perfectly normal
teenager,” said his father, “except for
one thing the way he plays tennis.”
Yet, off-court, he con-
tinued to be a shy and pri-
vate even nice person.
On-court he became a liv-
ing terror.
Perfection was his goal
and for anyone who did
not achieve that standard
he held only contempt and
contumely.
It was on umpires in
particular that John jun-
ior’s sense of perfection
was visited. He was
incensed by unprofession-
al attitudes that persisted
in the arenas of his chosen
career even in the post-amateur days.
John junior’s idol was not his father,
who did not play tennis, but Rod Laver.
McEnroe modelled his play on that of
the Australian fellow left-hander. But it
was his mother to whom McEnroe was
always looking for support. “Perhaps
I’ve spoiled him for other women,” she
said recently.
John junior is the loneliest tennis
player in the world. His only outlets and
recreations are his music (he’s a
passionate and accomplished guitarist)
and the Irish bars which he visits in
Manhattan. Yet his father
still has a major impact in
his life.
For the press the
McEnroes have nothing
but contempt. They are
worse than linesmen: not
only blind but also biased.
They don’t understand the
one point that John junior
sees as being obvious: that
he is the best player in the
world.
One thing you can say
in his favor: he does not in-
dulge in gamesmanship.
He is strictly fair, except
about his own failings
which he castigates ruth-
lessly.
It is not his character that is in ques-
tion but his personality. And he doesn’t
see that as being important. He knows
his failings “Maybe I need to be de-
faulted; maybe that would straighten
my head out” but he believes, honest-
ly, that there are larger failings around.
But it is his will to perfection that is
his achilles heel as well as making him
so good.
As full-time manager and agent,
John senior’s aim is to make his son not
only the best but also the most-highly-
paid athlete in the world. And he’s well
down the path to that goal. John senior
is highly protective of his son, genuinely
loving him. And the feeling is returned.
Says John junior: “I have someone I
can trust, someone who cares about
me, who’ll do what’s best for me.” □


WINE
T ravels
with
my nose
By LEN EVANS
TO SAY that the trip started pro-
misingly would be like mentioning that
Jack Nicklaus plays golf. It was a tre-
mendous start: 38 great Burgundies, all
of the top 64 vintage, a definitive tasting
of all the communes and major
vineyards of the renowned slope. That it
was held in the hills of the Napa Valley
in California, at the winery of Donn
Chappellet, added a certain piquancy.
The redoubtable Madame Lalou
Bize-Leroy, the most famous living lady
in the world of wine, gave the tasting
and people travelled from all over the
world to attend.
If nothing else, it proved that 20-
year-old Burgundies can be
full of life; that Leroy has the
greatest treasurehouse of wine
there is and that Madame can
teach us all a thing or two
about flair and presentation.
But one should start a wine
buying and selling trip in such
a fashion. It sets the tone, you
know, and it’s nice to see a bit
of style especially when we
so lack it today.
Bordeaux was busy. The
wine capital of the world
glows with the success that
only a series of top vintages
bring. Eighty-one, 82 and
83 have all been very kind to
them and 84 looks good.
In spite of all the talk,
prices don’t look like tum-
bling much the weak franc
and the strong dollar com-
bining to see much of the top
stuff going to the United
States.
The continued question is,
just how good are the 82s? I
think they are unlike any
other vintage of the past 100
years. They are as exquisitely
flavored as any in memory,
yet are very fleshy and soft,
with far less tannin and acid
than usual. Whether they will
live for 30 years or more (like
the 61s, for example) doesn’t
really matter, unless to
oenophiles of the next cen-
tury. However, those intend-
ing buyers who seem to want to look at
only famous vintages should not devote
themselves to 82 to ignore 81 and 83.
Some really good wines have been made
in both straddling years Lascases,
Pichon-Lalande, Grand-Puy-Ducase,
Cos d’Estournel, Montrose coming
quickly to mind as well as the more
famous names such as Margaux,
Latour, Cheval Blanc, Petrus and so on.
Between Bordeaux and Champagne
is a place you must visit Moulin le
Roc, near Brantone, between Angou-
leme and Tours. It’s a carefully restored
mill, crammed with revered antique fur-
niture, run by a lady who is said to be
one of the great chefs of France.
Prices in Champagne have stabilised
somewhat after the huge lifts of recent
years and another good year will settle
them more. The size of the vintage is the
most important thing in this district and
stocks are high again.
Business is very good internation-
ally, with the United Kingdom and the
US neck and neck as chief importers
the 50 percent rise in the consumption
of the latter again being due to its strong
dollar.
Australia doesn’t do a bad job,
either, being firmly in the top 10 and
said to be the largest consumer of cham-
pagne per capita of any country outside
France.
Champagne has a new three-star res-
taurant, Les Crayeres, run by Gerard
Boyer, set in the magnificent chateau of
the princes of Polignac who used to own
Pommery. A fortune has been spent on
house and park and the accommodation
is quite remarkably lush and comfort-
able. Rheims has long needed such an
establishment and obviously it’s full of
entertaining Champenois busy enter-
taining.
Christian Pol Roger and Henri Krug
both allowed us the privileges of friend-
ship by showing wines other than (and
as well as) their great champagnes a
1915 Vosne-Romanee and a 1911
Vertus, respectively. And Mo6t et
Chandon, as hospitable as ever,
declared (in the person of president
Yves Benard): “We intend to be number
one in Australia.” Yes, the Champenois
are very aware of the growing sophisti-
cation of our local palate and I believe
this will lead to considerable discount-
ing among the lesser names.
Much debate has been proceeding in
Burgundy regarding the quality of the
83s. Quality in the Cote d’Or is variable
at any time, to say the least, as
the big shippers work hard to
keep up with the demand for
FAQ wines. The wise buyer
limits inspection to those
trusted people who specialise
in each corner. Hence, do not
go to a Gevrey Chambertin
grower to buy Santenay but
rather pick out those in each
commune or small village
who know their locality best.
Such a one is Louis Vallet,
of Pierre Boure in Gevrey,
who honored us with both a
luncheon en famille and a dis-
course on the 83s during
which he summed up the
whole essence of buying:
“Some very good even great
wines have been made.
Some great names are not so
good and some good names
are extremely good. But there
is no consistency. You must
taste everything and decide
for yourself.”
Hail was one of the prob-
lems of the 83 vintage and
Vosne-Romanee, the home of
the majestic Domaine de la
Romanee Conti wines, was
hard hit.
Madame Bize-Leroy is
half-owner of the Domaine
and worried about “the hail
taste.” Well, I’m prepared to
lend my vast experience
anytime at a tasting of

Conti wines and I can report that I
found no hail taste at all. The 83s im-
press, with Romanee Conti absolutely
outstanding, and Richebourg and
Grands Echezeaux very good indeed.
For those of you who would like to
dip your oenological toe (so to speak) in
the Pool of Great Names, I suggest you
try the Echezeaux (just that, not the
Grands) from the Domaine de la
Romanee Conti of the 80 vintage. Not
expensive and an excellent example of
the depth, complexity and intensity of
flavor to be found in these wines.
Beaujolais provided a contrast.
There, young wines achieve only up to
18 francs (about $A2.50) a bottle against
the 80-plus of the Domaine. But the air
is clear and people are happy because
the wines are selling so well.
George Duboeuf, the king of
Beaujolais, makes not a single bottle yet
sells more than a million cases a year.
Of his wines I particularly like the
Moulin a Vent, Fleurie and Chiroubles,
plus a fantastic Blanc de Beaujolais
1967 which was quite extraordinarily
fine. The grape? Chardonnay, of course.
The interesting thing about
Beaujolais is the evenness of price. We
stayed with Jean de St Charles at
Chateau Bluizzard (worth $2 million)
who gets 18 francs a bottle for his
Brouilly. We visited Francois de Roussy
de Sales, at Chateau la Chaize (worth $5
million), who gets 18 francs for his.
Then, after a riotous sing-song with the
mayor of Vaux the home of
Clochmerle I asked the price he ob-
tained for wines from a small patch near
his unpretentious home. You guessed it:
18 francs. You don’t buy fancy labels in
Beaujolais.
So having bought Bordeaux,
Burgundies and Beaujolais, finessed
with futures and channelled some
champagne our way it was on to Lon-
don to lay down the lore regarding Aus-
tralian wine.
The occasion was the International
Wine Trade Fair at Kensington. Now
that the wine centre, situated opposite a
brothel in Soho has closed, we have to
depend for UK representation on those
sturdy folk who are prepared to go it
alone. Those few Hill Smith, Berri,
Chateau Remy, Browns, Baileys, Orlan-
do and Rothbury among them
combined to give top buyers a lunch at
which I extolled our virtues and
minimised our vices.
Back to the strong dollar: As the
pound has weakened, it has become
more difficult to push those Californian
wines which have become quite popular
in the UK. This weaning-off from Euro-
pean which Californians have part
achieved may be useful to us.
There had been two attitudes: either,
“You can’t expect colonial wines to be
much good” or better informed
“You keep the best wines for your-
selves.” Now, minds are more open ...
“We liked the Californian, which have
become quite expensive, so let’s try the
Australian.”
Also, top writers who have visited us
from time to time Hugh Johnson,
Michael Broadbent, Pamela Vandyke
Price, Oz Clarke, etc have been un-
failing in support.
If the Wine Corporation can’t afford
to keep the wine centre open, at least it
should bring out a writer or two a year.
One of the more interesting new
sights in London is to be found at the
Metro, the recently opened wine bar
under L’Hotel in Basil Street, which is
owned by David Levin of Capital Hotel
fame. Installed there is one of those
newfangled contraptions which sell a
glass of wine at a time. You plug in any
bottle and a nitrogen cap keeps it fresh
for weeks after you have pulled the
cork.
Finally, a week of giving lectures and
tastings and lunches and dinners this
time, pushing our own products. Fin-
ished up selling a container of our top
stuff.
Which is not a bad way to end a trip,
either. □

THE ARTS
How Banks’ deadline
was met 200 years later
After more than two centuries, Sir Joseph Banks’ original engraved
plates from Captain Cook’s voyage have been captured in print and
on television. SANDRA JOBSON reports on this landmark achievement.
AN AUSTRALIAN television film, re-
cently premiered in London at the Mu-
seum of Natural History to an audience
of academics, art historians and scien-
tists, will be shown in Australia by the
ABC in October.
The Flowering Of The Pacific. Banks’
Florilegium, directed by Brian Adams
and written and narrated by Robert
Hughes, is a reconstruction of the voy-
age of Sir Joseph Banks with Captain
Cook through the Pacific to discover
Australia in 1768-1771. (It is a joint
ABC-TV, NZ-TV and RM Arts Munich
production.)
The film also chronicles the printing,
more than 200 years after the voyage, of
the original engraved plates made from
drawings and watercolors done on the
voyage of the 3607 species gathered by
Banks and his colleague Carl Daniel
Solander. By showing the care which
has been taken to reproduce in color
these original line engravings, the film
documents an important piece of print
archaeology. The resulting Alecto
Edition of Banks’ Florilegium is a
unique publishing venture, unlikely to
be repeated.
Each of the 100 copies of this restric-
ted edition consists of 35 Solander
boxes designed by Solander in the 18th
century, measuring 31 inches (about
80cm) by 24in by containing 738
color prints taken from the original cop-
perplates. Each copy costs $lOl,OOO.
Some of the plates which Banks com-
missioned were on display (B, August
18, 1981) at the State Library of NSW in
1981-82.
Hughes, Australian-born art critic of
Time magazine, has pinpointed what
was so remarkable about Banks’ expedi-
tion. “The men who were shot into
space in the 1960 s met nobody and
brought back nothing in the way of arts
or literature,” Hughes says at the begin-
ning of the film. “By contrast, the men
who sailed off into the Pacific 200 years
earlier did a lot of drawing, a lot of
writing and a staggering amount of col-
lecting.
“Not having cameras to passively re-
Banksia serrata, as captured by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770


Castanospermum australe from Banks’ Florilegium
Preparing the prints: workers in the London studio
cord what they saw, they had to look,
scribble and remember.”
A space capsule seems palatial com-
pared with the cramped quarters and
unsanitary conditions of the 32 metre-
long Endeavour with its crew of 86 offi-
cers and men as well as Banks’ party of
eight botanists including Solander and a
young English artist, Sydney Parkinson
not to mention Banks’ two pet
greyhounds.
The film shows how the men contrac-
ted malaria and other tropical diseases
which eventually killed a third of those
on board. One victim was Parkinson
whose original watercolors and sketches
almost miraculously reproduced Aus-
tralia’s native flora in an age when other
artists were unable to recreate the true
coloring of alien landscapes. Parkinson
died having completed 269 of the 942
drawings he had begun before contract-
ing fever.
The film also delves into the mystery
of why Banks never got around to
making an edition from the copper
plates he commissioned from a team of
the finest line engravers in England on
return from his voyage. An indepen-
dently wealthy man, he had spent the
equivalent in today’s currency of
$500,000 in getting the plates made.
Why did he stop there?
Hughes suggests that a combination
of factors led Banks to let the edition
slide. “He was president of the Royal
Society, a successor to Isaac Newton
himself... His colleagues already knew
about his work and Solander’s in the
South Seas. Besides, wool prices
Robert Hughes: narrates the film
dropped in the 1780 s and his income
dropped with them.”
The publishers of the edition today
are very sympathetic to Banks’ inability
to get the edition off the ground.
Looking back on their costly and
mammoth venture, Joe Studholme,
chairman of Alecto, says he is grateful
that the Natural History section of the
British Museum where the original
plates are housed has ruled that there
will be no further printing from them
for 50 years although he feels that the
risks involved ensure that no other pub-
lisher would be tempted to do it any-
way. “Nobody else would be lunatic
enough,” he says.
How Alecto won the job of publish-
ing the edition is an example of enter-
prise rather akin to the story of Banks’
voyage.
In the 19605, a group of Oxford and
Cambridge undergraduates conceived
the idea of making some spare cash by
selling prints of public schools to old
boys. After finishing university, mem-
bers of the group found that they had a
potentially lucrative business on their
hands. They diversified and started
printing Hockney and Allen Jones
paintings as prints became the art form
of the swinging 60s.
They crossed the Atlantic and started
printing American artists, too, such as
Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg and George
Segel. Then came the economic slump
in the 1970 s and Alecto found the mar-
ket for modern prints drying up.
Unlike Banks, financially thwarted
by the drop in wool prices, Alecto was
fortunate in finding a patron in the form
of the Tate Gallery which commis-
sioned it to publish 306 prints from
DanielPs Voyage Round Great Britain
a 19th century story which had appealed
to Studholme, fascinated by Daniell
who had set out in a ship to record the
shoreline of Britain. Finding himself
prone to seasickness, he had ended up
trudging on foot for 12 years around the
bluffs and coves of the isles.
This project led Alecto to suggest the
Banks edition to the British Museum. It
began in 1978 a painstaking business
with 20 artists and craftsmen recon-
structing the technique of 200 years ago.
The resulting edition had not only
the longest publishing deadline in his-
tory; it was also the biggest. Each copy
of the edition weighs 20kg and a stack
of only half the Solander boxes making
up each set of 35 towers well above
Hughes’ head. □


VIDEO
The marketing
of Michael
Jackson
Michael Jackson in his Thriller video clip: cured the sickest game in town
By PAUL GARDINER*
MICHAEL JACKSON’S ability to shift
merchandise is rapidly elevating him to
the same class as film-maker George
Lucas. First came Jackson’s Thriller al-
bum. That from what, in retrospect,
were meagre beginnings is the largest-
selling single album of all time. Now
Jackson has emerged as the champion
of the music video business, particularly
in Australia.
One of the features of Jackson’s as-
tonishing market penetration has been
his use of video. Four video clips have
been out of songs from the Thriller al-
bum. First was The Girl Is Mine , then
Billy Jean , then Beat It and finally
Thriller itself. The album’s success was
greatly aided by these clips.
Jackson’s twist of the knife was to
prepare and release a full-length (60
minutes) video cassette called The
*Paul Gardiner is the publisher of Rolling
Stone Australia
Making of Michael Jackson’s Thriller.
Until this semi-archival “music video”
had been released, the music side of the
video business was in the doldrums.
Michael has changed all of that. (In 12
weeks the company distributing
TMMJT shipped an astonishing 60,000
copies of the cassette. At a retail price of
$34.95 triple the price of an album
this was a singular and probably non-
repeatable piece of marketing, even
taking into account that the video was
released on a sale-or-return basis to
video stores and music outlets.
Jackson’s little masterpiece was 15
times as successful on the raw figures
as the next-biggest-selling music video
to that point, Duran Duran’s self-titled
release from Thorn-EMI which shipped
(for those of us with lousy arithmetic)
4000 copies.
What the video-buying public got for
its money was the uncensored version of
the made-for-TV Thriller video clip, all
11 minutes of its cast of werewolves,
ghouls, arm-dropping cadavers and
Michael in horror movie drag. On top
of that was around 45 minutes of ar-
chival material and mini-documentary
on the making of the clip itself.
The obvious aim of all of this was
quite straightforward and predictable
to make what one will of Jackson’s pro-
digious talents as a singer, composer,
conceptualiser and ultimately as a
dancer. To give the boy-man his due,
the video demonstrates that Jackson’s
talent was a gift and that long years of
practice and performance have elevated
it to the status of performing genius.
That alone is a lesson worth digesting:
Jackson is not the Peter Pan of the mu-
sic world springing fully made from the
fairy lights; he has made and remade
himself from the tip of his surgically
amended nose to the toes of his well-
practised feet.
The consequences of Jackson’s mu-
sic video success are beginning to roll
like a tidal wave across the video busi-
ness in Australia.
Until The Making, the merchandisers
and the retailers had been content to
stick their music videos at the back of
the catalogue and the back of the store.
There had been virtually no promotion
of them and the slimmest of advertising
budgets had been allocated to them. The
consensus was that music video might
catch up with everything else by 1985 or
that it might linger as the also-ran of the
video business forever. All of this was
both understandable yet naggingly at
odds with what might have been.
Australia is, after all, one of the
world leaders in the application of TV
to the marketing of music.
Shows such as Countdown have set
the world standard for providing rock
and roll artists with saturation coverage.
Australian television audiences have
been bombarded like no others with
music on TV. As well, the penetration of
video into the Australian market has set
a world industry standard.
Yet music video was the sickest game
in town until Jackson came along. The
reasons had a lot to do with the avail


Divorce isn't easy
You're going to be with the next copier you buy for
quite a while. So getting hitched to an unreliable
copier can be a marriage of inconvenience.
Especially when your boss discovers the
frustration and disruption your unreliable new
plaything is causing.
Next time you buy a copier, take a look at
Panasonic first.
Because we realised that most copiers were
pretty much alike feature for feature, we drew on
the world's most advanced copier research
and manufacturing expertise to develop
copiers with ultimate reliability as their
primary feature.
The result is a range of Panasonic
copiers that do everything other copiers do, except
break down as often.
If you're tired of the frustration of the "Out
of Order" sign, you're ready for Panasonic. And a
copier marriage founded in heaven.

ability of the product itself, its cost and
its quality. With the singular and pion-
eering exception of Thorn-EMI, very
little attention had been given to music
video. That was largely a function of
priorities: what has changed things for
the foreseeable future is the evidence
that, if music videos are strategically
priced and readily available, they can
swamp sales of conventional product.
The Making has been at least twice as
successful as any other video product.
The nearest competitor is the feature
film Raiders of the Lost Ark, with sales
of 25,000. Another video from the
Thriller distribution (Video Classics), by
David Bowie, called Serious Moonlight,
is expected to top the 20,000 mark and a
third released two weeks ago of
Boy George and Culture Club (Kiss
Across The Ocean) is expected to do bet-
ter than that. In each case, the price has
been held at the bottom end of the scale.
And market expectations are being cau-
tiously rewriten. All of the music-re-
lated companies with potential product
Festival, RCA-Columbia and
Polygram Musicvideo have set about
closing the product gap.
There is a second string to this bow.
So far, most of the music videos finding
their way to the back of the shop have
suffered from a problem universal to
television: lousy sound. It’s all very well
to have the images but any music con-
sumer would be thoroughly peeved at
the quality of the musical reproduction
that’s possible from many of the MV’s
so far released. Adding to that problem
has been the sub-transistor quality of
the speakers in most television sets. The
combination is enough to send the av-
erage music freak back to AM radio.
There have been broadcast solutions
to the tinny interface between image
and music already. In both the
rock/pop and operatic fields, synchron-
ous broadcasts of material involving co-
operation between television stations
and FM broadcasters have shown the
way.
In the case of video, the problem is
about to be half-solved for those with a
spare $lOOO to $l5OO. The answer is
stereo hi-fi video cassette recorders. The
Australian market is being subjected to
a successive series of launches of these
machines from all of the major VCR
companies. One is already available:
Blaupunkt’s RTV 424 is being gobbled
up by a market in which the first genera-
tion of VCR’s are approaching the end
of their life. Stereo hi-fi VCR’s can be
operated through a stereo television or
more expeditiously hooked up to a
stereo hi-fi sound system. The result is
first-rate sound.
Furthermore, this new technology
has emerged when consumers are
making other hardware decisions. The
hi-fi market which has in the past few
years developed into a largely replace-
ment business people upgrading their
equipment, rather than buying for the
first time is set for something of a
refresher with the advent of compact
disc. CD hardware has been available
for some time but the software is only
now reaching the market in quantity.
The irony is that CD may find itself
competing with stereo hi-fi VCR’s for
business. The reason for this wrinkle is
that the sound reproduction quality be-
ing claimed for the VCR’s is only just
short of the compacts. Stereo hi-fi
VCR’s can be used like an audio
cassette deck. And you can also get pic-
tures with your sound.
Of course, the MV producers are
acutely conscious of the jarring note
(between their tapes and the hardware)
and doing their level best to close the
specifications gap. The one certainty is
that this happy conjunction of hardware
and software can be expected to main-
tain the video industry’s head of steam
for a while yet. □

FILMS
Adolescent
sex without
the smirks
John Albasiny, Mark Brelsford and Chris Karallis in P’Tang Yang Kipperbang
By SANDRA HALL
WHILE American film-makers are
treating adolescent sex with a mixture
of soft porn and slapstick in films such
as Porky’s and My Tutor, the British are
being determinedly idealistic and old-
fashioned about the subject.
Scottish director Bill Forsyth helped
to establish the tone three years ago with
the success of Gregory’s Girl, his gentle,
humorous and ingenuous story about
life, love and football in a Glasgow
co-educational high school. David
Puttnam and London’s Channel 4 have
turned it into a trend with First Love,
their series of telemovies which is going
into commercial release.
The first was Experience Preferred
But Not Essential, about a university
student falling in love during a summer
spent as a waitress at a Fawlty Towers-
like hotel on the Welsh coast. Now
comes P'Tang Yang Kipperbang, set in
the summer of 1948.
The film’s odd title comes from the
invented phrase its schoolboy charac-
ters use in greeting one another. It’s an
expression, like their obsession with
cricket and their dismissive talk about
their female classmates, of solidarity in
the face of the great mystery sex.
What will it be like? When will it hap-
pen? And how?
The script was written by the editor
of the First Love series, Jack Rosenthal,
who has drawn before on his wartime
childhood for his award-winning BBC
play The Evacuees.
Rosenthal’s 14-year-old hero, Alan
Duckworth (John Albasiny) naturally
known as Quack Quack is a serious
lad with a hangdog look who ap-
proaches life’s challenges with John
Arlott’s voice forever in his ears a
symptom both of his preoccupation
with England’s efforts to win the Ashes
and Duckworth’s solemnly idealistic at-
titude to life in general.
He lectures anyone who will listen
about his hopes for the post-war world
and grapples in secret with the fact that
his most profound desires are not sexual
but sentimental. Distractedly in love
with Ann (Abigail Cruttenden), a girl in
his class, he dreams continually of
kissing her even though kissing is
considered by his peers to be a dreary
substitute for the real thing.
They are even less interested in
Alan’s ideas about world peace al-
though he has a sympathetic listener in
Tommy, the school groundsman, a re-
turned serviceman whom Alan regards
as a hero.
But Tommy (Garry Cooper) has
troubles of his own. Miss Lang, the
English teacher (a wonderfully ruthless
performance by Alison Stead) thinks he
has made her pregnant and, since the
interest these two have in one another is
strictly sexual, neither can imagine any-
thing worse than being married to the
other.
Their predicament is a bracingly acid
antidote to the sweetness that spreads
over everything else. Miss Lang is all
steel and sexual pragmatism, shrugging
off the entreaties of her old lover the
headmaster (Robert Urquhart).
P’Tang Yang was directed by
Michael Apted ( Coal Miner’s Daughter,
Agatha and a lot of British television)
and while there are a few anachronisms
in Rosenthal’s script it’s a gently persua-
sive evocation, for escapists of all gener-
ations, of one particularly golden post-
war summer.
SOCIOLOGY rather than nostalgia is
the stuff of Almonds and Raisins, a film
which documents an obscure yet fasci-
nating episode in American cinema
the birth and decline of the Yiddish
talkie. It flourished in New York during
the early years of sound, inspired by the
success of that famous non-Yiddish
Yiddish talkie The Jazz Singer, and was
kept alive by the enthusiasms of a
homesick immigrant population unable
to resist stories in their own language.
Between 1927 and 1938, 300 Yiddish
films were made for American audi-
ences melodramas about life in the
streets and sweatshops of the Lower
East Side. At least, that’s how it was in
the beginning. As time went on and the
audiences grew more sophisticated and
the characters more affluent, the Lower
East Side was replaced by mid-Manhat-
tan. A doctor-nurse romance, says nar-
rator Orson Welles, was no mere melo-
drama. It was the very stuff of upward
social mobility.
Forty years before Blazing Saddles
there was a Yiddish Western and the
Yiddish re-make of The Jazz Singer re-
jected the line proffered by the “Holly-
wood assimilationists” by having the
hero turn down stardom in America to
go back to Eastern Europe and marry
the Jewish girl next door.
The films may not have reflected life
as led by the New York Jewish commu-
nity but they were vivid dramatisations
of its dreams and its nightmares. The
theatre, says one of the film-makers in-
terviewed, became a second home for its
audience creating a Yiddish-speaking
world.
Almonds and Raisins another film
backed by Channel 4 was directed by
Russ Karel from a literate treatment by
Wolf Mankowitz. □

TELEVISION
Bodyline:
it’s not
just cricket
By GERALDINE WALSH
BODYLINE. The word is as deeply
etched in the Australian psyche as is
Gallipoli or the name of Phar Lap or
Les Darcy. They each evoke strong
emotions, epitomising occasions when
as a people we were “done in” one way
or another, although we’ve managed to
turn Gallipoli into a negative plus.
Film-makers, with a sense of what will
turn superficially cynical Australians
into weeping sentimentalists, have
“done” Gallipoli and Phar Lap. Now
the brilliantly successful Kennedy
Miller production team has capitalised
on the next sure-fire winner the
bodyline test cricket series of 1932-33.
So Australia will have the opportu-
nity to watch this outstanding home-
grown mini-series on Network Ten on
July 16-19 inclusive.
A media preview of Bodyline was
held at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Not
the warmest of places in the off season
at the best of times. They unwittingly
chose the coldest July day in Sydney
since 1896 and the coldest Sydney day
in 22 years. The weather was not in-
ducive to a warm reception but
Kennedy Miller and the network don’t
have to worry they have a hot proper-
ty on their hands.
For those who weren’t around in the
30s, it’s difficult to understand the na-
tional hysteria the bodyline series
aroused until one stops to recall a
more recent event which also had el-
ements of bad sportsmanship, the Am-
erica’s Cup.
Perhaps it is more than co-incidental
that the infamous cricket series and the
battle for the cup both occurred when
people needed something to take their
minds off the stark realities of the times
respectively the great depression and
the worst Australian recession in the
past 50 years.
These sporting battles gave the
people a chance to re-direct their anger
and frustration, from intangible econ-
omic slings and arrows to an “enemy.”
Kennedy Miller has constructed the
story of the test Series around three
characters: Douglas Jardine, the
English captain, our Don Bradman and
English fast bowler Harold Larwood
who followed orders and bowled in-
timidating bodyline deliveries.
Jardine and Bradman are introduced
as children and their background
juxtaposed. Jardine’s childhood gives
the producers the chance to dip into the
TV and film flavor of the year, India
under the British Raj.
The rot sets in when the little chap is
sent off on his lonesome to endure the
rigors and lovelessness of an English
public school education to ensure that
he will turn out an English gentleman.
Bradman, on the other hand, is de-
Bodyline: Gary Sweet as Bradman, Jim Holt as Larwood, Hugo Weaving as Jardine
picted as being as Australian as billy tea
surrounded by a loving family.
The series concentrates on two
themes playing the game and whether
the individual should become more im-
portant than the team.
Fittingly for a story about teams,
Kennedy Miller has brought together a
talented team of writers and directors.
Produced in 10 hour-long segments,
Carl Schultz (TV’s The Dismissal and
the cinema’s Careful He Might Hear
You) directs the first two, the seventh
and the final two. Versatile opera, ballet
and theatre director George Ogilvie is
responsible for the third and the fifth.
Lex Marinos, in his first screen directing
venture, does the eighth episode and
Denny Lawrence the fourth.
Terry Hayes, one of the producers,
scripted the first two episodes as well as
the last two with Francine Finnane. The
rest of the series was written by Marinos
and Lawrence.
The script, apart from a few school
lectures on the history of the time and
how cricket is played and scored (no
doubt with an eye for export), is better
than we’ve been offered in an Australian
production for quite a while with
lovely touches of light humor. It is at
times so clever and witty that you know
the real characters could not have had
such facility with the language.
The class-consciousness of the Eng-
lish of those years is beautifully evoked.
It begins within the touring team,
with the distinction between “gentle-
men” and “players.”
The English regard the Australians
as being totally beyond the pale, such
uncouth characters that they could not
be fitted into any known class.
Under Dean Semmler, the
photography can only be de-
scribed as beautiful. The ar-
chival material is all turned
into sepia tones and the col-
our soft. Hayes said that they
had aimed for a look which
would evoke a softness and
nostalgia.
The tension builds to a
point where there won’t be a
dry eye when Bradman sal-
utes the crowd with his bat
and it, in turn, celebrates him
in song.
The ill feeling the Austra-
lian crowd possessed for the
English is borne out by an in-
terjection from the famous
SCG hill barracker, Yabba.
Jardine, at the crease, was
brushing insects away from
his face when Yabba bel-
lowed: “Leave our bloody
flies alone.”
Don’t you leave this series
alone. Cancel all engagements
for four nights next week. □


DANCE
Re-enactment
of a star’s
emergence
By JOHN CARGHER
HISTORY repeats itself but usually
only after a substantial lapse of time, all
the more so in ballet where dancers in-
cline to hang on for dear life long after
the vital spark has gone.
Last week, it happened in a startling
juxtaposition when the Australian Bal-
let opened its first season in the new
Melbourne State Theatre with John
Cranko’s Onegin.
In August 1970 I wrote in these pages
about a 19-year-old from the same com-
pany’s corps de ballet who had shown
spectacular promise when pushed into
the deep end of the ballet pool. Young
Gary Norman danced Albrecht in
Giselle., I said, “not as a potential star
but as a fully-fledged one.”
Fourteen years later, Norman’s
dancing of the title role in Onegin still
dominated the stage through personal
magnetism and a technique worthy of
any overseas Onegin. Yet, he also wit-
nessed a re-enactment of his emergence
from the ranks.
Stephen Heathcote as Lensky in Onegin: an indefinable quality of “presence”
BRANCO GAICA
Lensky is a far from secondary role,
created in Australia in 1977 by Kelvin
Coe, then the company’s leading
dancer. (John Meehan was the “guest”
Onegin then, as Norman is a “guest”
Onegin now.) The new Lensky was
Steven Heathcote who is pictured in the
program among the corps of the com-
pany. Heathcote, like Norman, is a
graduate of Dame Margaret Scott’s
Australian Ballet School. Born in Perth,
he is emerging at the same age as
Norman 19 and confirms the
qualities which first gained him promi-
nence when he created the central
character in Equus in Sydney in April.
But that was modern dance and the
parallel with Norman has only now
emerged, for Onegin uses the classical
steps of traditional ballet. Heathcote
passes the test with flying colors.
The line is pure, the technique is
sound and faults restricted to youthful
exuberance; time will teach him that
four superbly executed pirouettes don’t
need a lesser fifth, even when that fifth is
better than the third of other dancers of
his age.
What Norman and Heathcote have
in abundance is that indefinable quality
“presence.”
Both are good-looking, though total-
ly different. Norman’s smouldering
sexuality is the opposite of Heathcote’s
boyish charm, yet they project per-
sonalities of equal power.
And the company desperately needs
a new male star for Norman, at the ripe
young age of 32, has opted for life as a
husband and father in preference to
public acclaim. He appears as a wel-
come guest for his faithful public but
behind the public facade he is building
another career which emerges only
when the likes of Heathcote suddenly
appear.
Norman is a full-time teacher at the
Australian Ballet School and an associ-
ate director of the National Theatre Bal-
let School. There, his macho image con-
vinced no fewer than 37 Australian
fathers this year to allow their young
sons to take up dancing instead of foot-
ball as a career!
Norman is proud of having taught
Heathcote during his last year at the
ABS and predicts that “he will be a
dancer Australia can be proud of.”
Asked the ideal classical role for
Heathcote, Norman unhesitatingly
says: “Albrecht in Gisellel ”
History does repeat itself but to see it
do so on one stage, in one ballet, with
the senior and the junior partner com-
plementing each other without jealousy
or rancour is a cause for rejoicing and
hope for an early rebirth of the Austra-
lian Ballet as it was in its days of glory
when youngsters such as Norman arose
from the ranks ... But that is where we
came in, isn’t it? □

BOOKS
Son plumbs
the depths
of Wells
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
H.G. Wells, Aspects of a Life, by
Anthony West. Hutchinson,
$26.50.
THIS IS really two books. The first, of
154 pages, is an entertaining, often il-
luminating if carelessly written account
of Wells in the years after he began his
affair with Rebecca West, the author’s
mother. The second, of 250 pages, is a
rambling series of chapters on Wells’
parents (disappointing) and on various
once-well-known figures who are best
left in the literary graveyard.
George Gissing turns out to be as
sleazy and tedious as his novels;
Dorothy Richardson’s novels have
survived somewhat better but in person
she is intolerable. The chapter on Wells’
fights with the Fabian Society
does not live up to the prom-
ise of a wonderful photograph
in the book of Beatrice and
Sidney Webb, those dauntless
defenders of Stalin and the
working class, being served
tea in their garden by a maid
in full gear. The fragments of
a self-portrait that appear
show Anthony West, under-
standably, as shy and easily
wounded.
It is a pity that the book is
a failure as a whole, for West
worked on it for more than 10
years after ending a 20-year
stint as book-reviewer for The
New Yorker. He also is the au-
thor of some forgettable
novels and several biog-
raphies.
It is odd that a man with
such a literary background, let
alone such genes, should tol-
erate so many cliches in his
own writing, which is spat-
tered with all his eggs in one
basket in the thick of the fray
when the dust began to settle
as George Bernard Shaw put
his oar in, etc.
This is a pity, as the book
begins promisingly with an
exasperated candor toward
his mother that is reflected in
his comment on her early let-
ters to his father: “The tone is that of a
Russian novel that has been passed
through the mind of a Woody Allen.”
Rebecca West was the most formid-
able, if not the most attractive (Moura
Budberg, Countess Zakrevskaya-
Benckendorff, was surely that), of the
liberated ladies who were invited, or
invited themselves, into Wells’ bed. His
wife of many years, Jane, was only too
happy to see the dear tubby little man
happy and the ladies doing what she
was not interested in doing herself. She
arranged households for them and
looked after H.G.’s financial arrange-
ments for their accouchements and sub-
sequent pensions.
The mistress who emerges as the
most likeable, and one of the most tal-
ented, is Amber Reeves, whom Rivers
Blanco White amiably married, know-
ing she was pregnant with Wells’ child.
He was not so amiable when Wells’
novel Ann Veronica appeared, based ob-
viously on his wife. By a sort of legal
blackmail he forced Wells to sign an
undertaking that he would not see Am-
ber or attempt any communication with
her for a term of years.
Rebecca West was determined to get
H.G. She got him. He got her with child.
Then the fights began. Rebecca didn’t
want to be Anthony cannot resist the
cliche second fiddle to Jane, which
would have pleased H.G. as long as he
was not prevented from having his
usual ration of liberated Americans,
Russians or hybrid Dutch-Greeks such
as Odette Keun on the side. Rebecca
wanted H.G. to divorce Jane and marry
her. Instead, H.G. offered her £5OO a
year to clear off to America. She settled
for £5OOO cash down and Anthony’s
education expenses.
H. G. Wells is a defence of Anthony’s
father, which is odd coming from a man
who as a child was not allowed to call
H. G. Daddy even though everyone
knew who he was. H.G. never seems to
have taken much interest in the boy, or
indeed in any of his children, legitimate
or illegitimate, but the sprightly, “short
and stout with the build of a teddy-
bear,” dapper Edwardian with his sense
of fun and his “enterprising promiscu-
ity” seems to have been irresistible to
almost everyone except those with
whose opinions he disagreed, such as
Winston Churchill, G. B. Shaw or
Kingsley Martin.
One is left with a great deal of re-
spect for Wells’ judgment, as well as a
desire to go back to Kipps, Tono-
Bungay, The World of William Clissold
and other novels. Wells was right to
have opposed Churchill and Clem-
enceau in their attempt to use troops to
put down the Russian revolution. He
was right to prefer Franklin
D. Roosevelt to Stalin, even
though, as West points out
shrewdly, Wells lost a lot of
popularity with the left for
preferring the US to Soviet
Russia in the 19305.
What makes at least the
first half of this book well
worth reading is the fascina-
ting portrait it gives of a man
who was a writer of penetra-
ting mind with a clear prose
style but who at the same time
was (as he knew himself to be)
a master of the “language of
self-deception,” to use West’s
words.
He is at his worst when
Jane is dying of cancer and he
does not want to cut short his
holiday with Keun in the
South of France. “I left her in
London not three weeks ago,
smiling and alert, but looking
a little tired ...,” he writes to a
new mistress, Margaret
Sanger, whom he has
arranged to meet in Switzer-
land.
At his best, which is as
West wishes to remember him,
Wells is as appealing as he is
intelligent. He is also kind
and loyal to his friends, such
as Maxim Gorky, in distress.
Wells visited Australia


when he was 73; Canberra gave him
pneumonia. West mentions nothing else
about that 1938 visit.
But Wells said some good things
about Australia, as when he demolished
Prime Minister Joe Lyons for castigat-
ing Wells for criticising Hitler in 1938.
And he made this remark about censor-
ship: “A barrier of illiterate police-
men and officials stands between the
tender Australian mind and what they
imagine to be subversive literature.”
Like a lamb
to the
Slaughter
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Doctor Slaughter, by Paul Theroux.
Hamish Hamilton, $14.95.
THIS NOVEL has to be reviewed with-
out giving away the game because sus-
pense whatever will Dr Lauren
Slaughter, PhD, do next? is import-
ant. Lauren Slaughter, formerly Mopsy
Fairlight, of Culpepper, Virginia, US,
where she was runner-up in a beauty
queen contest, advances her career as a
graduate student in Arabic studies at the
Hemisphere Institute in London by an
amazing series of sexual coups. What
she really wants is money, lots of it. The
beauty queen business and the Arabic
studies are simply incidentals.
I can believe in Slaughter’s
strategies. They have the ring of brutal
truth.
Theroux’s writing is dazzling
whether his subject is the dark side of
travel ( The Old Patagonian Express),
unglamorous crime ( The Family Ar-
senal), colonialism ( Girls at Play) or
failed heroics {The Mosquito Coast).
And even his relatively benign stories
such as The Consul’s File and Picture
Palace have a ferocious element.
This comes out on top in Doctor
Slaughter. There were times, reading
what Mopsy/Lauren was up to, when I
felt like saying: “Come off it, Theroux;
you’ve over-programmed her.”
We meet Slaughter on page one,
standing in her mink-lined Burberry
coat in her freezing room in Brixton
recalling what Hugo Van Arkady had
said at the previous night’s dinner party.
“There are five thousand people in
the world,” he had said, then had quali-
fied the statement for the amazed faces
around the table with: “That is reality.
It is a fact. It has nothing to do with the
other billions.” He had added: “Two of
these men are in China and I know
them both.”
Slaughter knows what he meant; she

decides to get to know the five thou-
sand, or as many as can be managed.
Van Arkady becomes one of the men
in her life, along with Julian Shuttle
(poor Julian, also into Arabic studies at
Hemisphere Institute); General New-
house, who runs Hemisphere; a mer-
chant banker named Guy, his uncle
Lord Bulbeck and Mr Karim. Lord
Bulbeck is quite an appealing character.
He has a speech defect which causes
him to say “litoo” for “little” and
“horriboo” for “horrible.”
He comes to a sticky end. Slaughter
learns about it when she goes to the
news-stand at the Charles de Gaulle air-
port and his photograph is on the front
page of every paper.
“The fallen man had an expression
surprise, anguish and his eyes were
whitened with fear. His hand was folded
crookedly beneath him and great stains
soaked his coat. One shoe was twisted
away from his foot and his narrow eld-
erly ankle was showing. His frailty was
obvious in his thin legs and in his brittle
posture he looked as if he had been
thrown on those stairs, and broken.”
In Doctor Slaughter Theroux has
created a kind of innocent, ignorant
monster lucky to have two or three
skins more than most people so that
what she is doing does not destroy her
no matter what it does to others and
set her in the context of a thriller. There
is nobody in the novel who, from the
point of view of value to society, is
worth a button. This relentless attitude
should be depressing but somehow is
not. It is instead exciting.
Doctor Slaughter is not a book for the
library list of Aunt Maude, that mythi-
cal, durable, elderly relative of drama
critics and book reviewers. It may even
astonish some members of Theroux’s
considerable fan club. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Trickle will swell into a flood
by Patricia Rolfe
THE FIRST slow trickle of what will
become the flood of bicentennial books
(some of them, alas, likely to be swept
straight from the shop window through
to the remainder table) has begun. What
seems to be the first project off the
ground is one of the major ones. The
first two volumes of The Art of Captain
Cook’s Voyages will come from Oxford
in October. These are The Voyage of the
Endeavour and The Voyage of the Resol-
ution and Adventure, at $75 each.
These have been compiled by Dr
Rudiger Joppien, of Cologne, and Pro-
fessor Bernard Smith. Smith has written
the introduction. Both have been work-
ing on the material for many years.
When Smith began to get the project on
the way in the early 19705, the two de-
cided to join forces. Smith says that they
have sighted 98 percent of the original
material between them. There is another
volume of the art to come and three vol-
umes of maps and charts. The maps and
charts are being done by Englishman
Commander Andrew David. Publication
should be complete by 1987.
The Australian Academy of the Hu-
manities has adopted the project offi-
cially and grants from the Utah Foun-
dation and the society have enabled it to
get under way.
TALL POPPIES, a series of interviews
with some notable Australian women by
Susan Mitchell, has been an “unpre-
cedented” success according to publish-
ers Penguin Books. Published in May, it

has reached its fourth printing with
35,000 copies in print. Orders have been
flowing in from booksellers at the rate
of 1000 a day and the third printing was
reached within a month. Mitchell is
planning a similar book on Australian
women in sport.
WARNER BOOKS are claiming credit
(or will take the blame) for the first com-
puter-written book, to be published in
the United States in October. Author is
Racter (a computer nickname for ra-
conteur) and the book is The Police-
man’s Beard is Half Constructed, which
suggests that someone fed in Monty Py-
thon and The Secret Policeman’s Ball
but something went wrong with the pro-
gramming.
One thing which Racter seems to
have in common with some writers is
that it needs no input once running.
Asked why anyone would buy its books,
Racter replied in terms not unlike some
writers when they get a rush of publicity
to the head: “The book is about delight
and satisfaction and joy. Stories, essays,
dissertations, tales are in this book.
There is also meat and tomatoes, con-
tracts and agreements. This book is my
consciousness, my awareness, my world
view.” Well, at least it won’t be on the
Mike Walsh Show discussing its sex life.
A US company called Sunday Novel
this year will begin running modern
classic novels as inserts, carrying adver-
tising, in various Sunday papers. Papers
will include The New York Times, Los
Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and
San Francisco Chronicle; authors will in-
clude Virginia Woolf, John Steinbeck
and Thornton Wilder. Publishing a
novel as a magazine and supporting it
with advertising was successfully pion-
eered by The Bulletin in 1980 by novelist
Thomas Keneally and Trevor Kennedy,
then editor of the magazine, with The
Cut-rate Kingdom.
COLOMBIAN Nobel prizewinner
Gabriel Garcia Marquez is reported to
be furious that his Bogota publisher an-
nounced that his new novel would be-
come the country’s principal export in
1985. “Not even I know when I shall
finish this novel,” he said, “because it is
an arduous and elusive labor which
could arrive at a happy conclusion with-
in six months or end up in the waste-
paper basket in six years.” As an export
commodity, it will be up against co-
caine. Colombia is one of the US drug
market’s principal suppliers. □


DANCE
A work to
stiffen
the sinews
A scene from Glen Tetley’s Revelation and Fall: mind-boggling dance theatre
BUSBY
By BRIAN HOAD
THERE ARE moments during the glum
period through which the arts are at
present shuffling when critics feel like
picking up their marbles and going
home. But Pollyanna still lives, good
things do crop up every now and then,
and it only needs persistence and stam-
ina to track them down.
As a matter of fact, after 104 visits to
theatre of every conceivable shape and
form during the first six months of this
year, your correspondent can recall 10
that were truly memorable.
The most recent shaft of inspiration-
al sunlight in the current gloom occur-
red at the end of an evening with the
Australian Dance Theatre on a brief
visit to Sydney from its home in Adel-
aide. Three tedious works had to be
endured before this happened a chal-
lenge beyond the stamina of some.
For the resilient, however, the sinews
were suddenly stiffened, the attention
grabbed and the imagination sent spin-
ning by the theatrical power of Revel-
ation and Fall , a new work created for
the company last March by that Ameri-
can genius of the dance, Glen Tetley.
The evening had got off to a deadly
start with Ghost Dances, by a rather
effete English choreographer, Chris-
topher Bruce. It purported to be another
of those sentimental tributes to “the in-
nocent people of South America who,
from the time of the Spanish Conquest,
have been continuously devastated by
political oppression.”
In the event, three strapping young
chaps of apparently Indian origin,
sporting death’s heads reminiscent of
the worst excesses of the Aztec empire,
kept rudely terminating the efforts of a
bunch of European migrants to dance
to the music of pan pipes, flutes and
guitars.
It cast serious doubts on the chor-
eographer’s political and ethnographi-
cal grasp of his subject.
Even more ludicrously, Bruce
brought his bland English approach to
the tortured, lovelorn world of that
great American blues singer, Billie Hol-
iday. In Holiday Sketches, as that inimi-
table voice spilled its rough melancholy
out of a rather wonky sound system to
express a sorrow too deep for words,
three white women and two white men
sashayed around to demonstrate yet
again that the choreographer was out of
his depth.
Pretentiousness had even more vapid
results in Still Life, a recent work by
trendy New York choreographer Ruby
Shang. Pseudo-scientific program notes
seem to suggest that Shang is here
groping her way toward some chor-
eographic interpretation of the laws
of electromagnetic induction. Alas, the
six dancers who ran around, jumped
about and occasionally stood still on a
collection of small boxes generated no
electricity, not even a spark.
Still Life and Holiday Sketches are
nonetheless claimed to be among the
ADT’s most popular works and have re-
cently been included in a one-hour tele-
vision special on the company which is
apparently destined for world-wide re-
lease where it is surely going to create a
curious picture of the current state of
Australian dance.
Popularity is usually akin to super-
ficiality; and superficiality is only too
easily summed up in words, “But art
wasn’t meant to be easy.” Revelation
and Fall is a mind-boggling, bone-
shaking piece of dance theatre, but it’s
hard to say why.
Tetley, like all great choreographers,
prefers to let his works speak for them-
selves. On this occasion he offers a little
guidance in a cryptic quote from Robert
Graves’ extraordinary book on the
matriarchal religions of the remote past,
The White Goddess : “Myth begins in the
blasted landscape where the god of the
dying year and the god of the rising year
struggle for the love of the muse and
their elusive quarry, the snow-white
deer.”
At least that sets the scene, a scene
created to perfection on stage by Aus-
tralian designer Michael Pearce with
powerful, monumental simplicity. And
at least the protagonists have been
named with Simone Clifford as The
Muse, Guy Detot as The Old God,
Robert Canning as The Young God and
Margaret Wilson as The Snow-White
Deer. And at last you can say with con-
viction that these four members of the
company are very good dancers indeed.
But you will have to go back to
Graves to understand why all true art-
ists are still subject to The Muse, who is
a personification of The White Goddess,
who is both creative and destructive,
both to be loved and feared.
The music by Peter Maxwell Davies,
composed in 1965, is a shockingly sav-
age setting for soprano, megaphone and
chamber ensemble of a horrific poem by
Georg Trakl from 1912 called Revel-
ation and Fall.
The Muse gave Trakl no rest, bom-
barding him with revelations of death
and decay in an age of anguished chaos.
In Revelation and Fall she appears as
the spectre of a nun in a storm of blood.
In 1914 she finally came to him on a
battlefield with revelations so ghastly
that he killed himself at the age of 26.
The potent combination of Trakl,
Davies, Graves and Tetley is more than
enough to chew over until the next bit of
art crops up. □


Great expectations
A

: , ;
life


And how to make them
come true.
If it’s always been your ambition to become a leader and achieve success in
a challenging, mentally-stimulating professional career, you’re obviously a young
man with great expectations.
The question is whether you’re willing to wait years for them to come true.
Or whether you’re already getting impatient.
In January, 1985 eighty young people will commence an intensive
44 week training course at Officer Cadet School, Portsea. When they graduate with
a commission as a Lieutenant, each Officer can expect to command men in areas as
diverse as Armour, Artillery, Engineering, Survey, Signals, Transport, Infantry,
Intelligence and Aviation.
They can also expect to be constantly involved in learning and mastering
new skills. Using their experience and training to help team members achieve the
best possible results. Realizing their full physical and mental potential. Gaining
recognition for their ability to lead men in a responsible, constructive manner.
And, of course, meeting every expectation their parents ever had for them to
succeed in a leading profession.
Life as an Army Officer is exhilarating, varied and very satisfying. Simply
because it’s one career where your great expectations can become a reality instead
of 4 pie in the sky’.
If you’re aged between IBV2 and 23 on the first day of the month in which
the course commences (or up to 25 with a degree or diploma), have your HSC or
equivalent, (at a level
acceptable to the Army),
and expect a lot from
yourself, contact your

Jim
Wills: a
retiring
man of
money
In 1946, Jim Wills joined the St George
Building Society not really because he
wanted to see battlers in homes but be-
cause the job paid an extra 10 shillings a
week. That may not sound much but it
was roughly one-tenth of the basic wage
and was considerably better than a poke
in the eye with a sharp stick. Wills be-
came company secretary and his job ex-
panded: he flogged timber, baths,
basins, sinks, stoves, refrigerators,
washing-machines, etc, to St George
members. The job was a long way from
that of the Wills who retired last week
with St George lending its members
$506.5 million in the past 12 months.
Two Britons, Ann Hatton and Ed Dun-
can, are trying to sail round the world in
a boat made of driftwood, 5000 plastic
bottles and an old Christmas tree. Their
trip, alas, has been dogged by misfor-
tune. Soon after they set out, they had to
be towed out of a military firing range
off Dorset. They said: “Nothing will
stop us achieving our dream.”
Kiama
post
office:
makes
some
locals
see red
It has been described as a “boeotian
brouhaha,” which is a bit tough on
Kiama, a pretty little town and traffic
jam on the Princes Highway, in NSW.
The Postal Commission repainted the
local post office and, instead of painting
it off-white or brown or grey, made it a
pink which in bright sunlight is salmon-
pink and in duller weather is much
darker. Those objecting few of whom
offer any definite alternative but insist
that anything would be better than this
are led by Jane de la Vega. She has
stirred up (a) Arthur Campbell, the may-
or; (b) Colin Hollis, the federal member
for Macarthur; and there have been
dark threats of making life even more
hellish for Bob Hawke. Calmer souls say
wait: time will mellow the color. A few
even like it. City cynics tend to say pink-
schmink: first and foremost, make sure
the place can handle mail.
Candice Bergen: the lady’s not for burning
Candice Bergen, who has graced more
than one movie with her combination of
brains and beauty and also is a photog-
rapher of note, recently spoke of death:
“Since I was 14, I’ve wondered what
will happen to my body when I die. I
don’t want to be buried. I’m claus-
trophobic. Cremation seems rather viol-
ent to me. I’ve thought maybe it would
be preferable to be blown up by a
landmine, camera in hand.”
Literary notes: Perhaps the strangest
book produced anywhere this year
is I Dream Of Woody, by Dee Burton.
She has a PhD in personality social psy-
chology from New York’s New School
for Social Research, which may or may
not help to explain why she would want
to write a book about people whose
dreams involve Woody Allen. She ad-
vertised, she says, received answers
from 144 people whose dreams she con-
sidered valid ie, not just inventors
and screwballs and printed 80 of
them. In the dreams, Allen hires people
for his movies, rejects them, sleeps with
them, escorts them to the Moon, turns
into Marlon Brando and shows up on a
football field full of snakes. Burton has
never met Allen.
In Punch magazine, Barry Humphries
delighted still more Brits by “confess-
ing” that he had let “no opportunity
pass when I could portray my people as
oafish tosspots, sentimental, inarticulate
boors, shrill, mindless harridans and
gross, slobbering, flatulent, flag-waving
blatherskites.” For all that, there were
legions of Humphries fans who remem-
bered him more as the man who
achieved fame by wearing a dress and
changing a beautiful flower into a socio-
logical weed.


Annette Funicello: taking the mickey
There can be hardly an American or
an Australian or a Brit or a Hairy Ainu,
for that matter between 30 and 45
years of age who hasn’t, at one time or
another, had a crush on Annette
Funicello. And any girl who can win
hearts while wearing a pair of plastic
Mickey Mouse ears is a winner indeed.
She’ll need to be if her first disc in near-
ly 20 years is to sell: Of The Annette
Funicello Country Album, US reviewer
Ralph Novak wrote: “The best thing to
be said about this is that she doesn’t
sound as if she’s singing with a mouth-
ful of peanut butter. She does, however,
sound as if she’s singing with a
clothespin on her nose ... Sorry, An-
nette; you’re sweet and you can get us to
buy just about anything but there are
limits.” Novak may have to hire a secre-
tary to do nothing else but. take book-
ings for dawn appointments pistols or
swords.
In the Chinese city of Xian, Walter
Mondale was, by repute, a real swinger.
After his 1979 vice-presidential visit,
there was a story that he had shopped at
the peasants’ market and come away
with two concubines. It puzzled a Mr
Meng, a local tour guide not because
he disapproved but because he didn’t
know that concubines were for sale.
Eventually, Meng found that one of his
fellow guides, who showed Mondale
around town, had somehow mixed up
the words concubine and cucumber. Re-
counting the story recently, in English,
at Xian Jiaotong University, Meng said:
“Until it was straightened out, we shook
our heads and said ‘Americans!’” But
even his grasp of the language wasn’t
strong enough to make clear whether he
approved or disapproved.
Half-a-century can play hell with a
reputation. In describing Douglas
Jardine, the English bodyline captain,
the Sydney Daily Telegraph last week
described him as “one of the greatest
cricketers ever to enter the SCG.” The
last time Jardine did enter the Sydney
Cricket Ground, as England’s chief vil-
lain, the Australian press was more like-
ly to have described him as the illegit-
imate offspring of a female dog. Yet still
the name lingers on at the old ground.
Bob Jardine has a polite but no more
than passing interest in the TV series
Bodyline which starts soon. He is the
SCG’s functions manager.
Pierre Cardin, the Paris designer-cum-
restaurateur-cum-publicity seeker, is
opening the up-market equivalent of a
McDonald’s in Peking where he has a
branch of his Maxim’s chain. It’ll be on
the ground floor of his Peking Maxim’s
and will serve gazpacho, spaghetti,
quiche and croissants (called jiao mian
bao ox-horn rolls in the local
patois). Cardin, who confesses himself
“a true communist,” is calling his new
eatery Minim’s.

The Hyde Park Club, the plush gymna-
sium, in midtown Sydney, was being
done up like a sore thumb for the
good-enough reason that it was cel-
ebrating its first birthday. Part of the
sore-thumbing involved tossing dry ice
into the swimming pool, the spa and
plunge pools. Which did not win the in-
stant approval of George Graham, the
man who looks after the pools, sauna,
steam bath, squash courts, etc. As earn-
est workmen approached, bearing
buckets of carbon dioxide, George
stood like Horatius at the bridge until
all was evenly explained. The party
went ahead anyhow, illuminated by
Kerry Packer and Tony Greig. And lots
of dry ice.

The case for human kindness at death’s door
PHILLIP ADAMS
FOR MORE than 20 years I’ve been
using my columns to discuss the inabil-
ity of western society to deal with mor-
tality, with death. Some 15 years ago,
Elizabeth Kubler-Ross arrived to in-
fringe my copyright and intensify the
debate. Elizabeth’s missionary zeal was
enormously influential, here and over-
seas. (How sad that she’s reneged on her
beliefs and fallen victim to a particular-
ly repugnant religious cult.) But with
her help and the pioneering work of
Cecily Saunders at St Christopher’s in
England, hospices have been estab-
lished all over England, Canada, the
USA and finally Australia.
In Australia, programs of every na-
ture have developed without the protec-
tion of consumer guidelines. I note with
disquiet that funeral parlors are moving
into the hospice business.
But most programs here, as in other
countries, centre on the “hospice” as an
in-patient residential building where
patient and family receive a quality of
care more appropriate to the terminally
ill.
Now the pendulum is swinging from
the overly romantic notion of wisteria-
covered shelters where the dying hear
soft guitar music and enjoy “meaning-
ful” conversations. Now the focus shifts
to the real world problems of symptom-
control and care at home. It’s now
realised that the best place for the dying
is at home. Best for the patient, best for
the family, best for society. Best for the
patient because it minimises alienation
and disturbance. Best for the family be-
cause it reduces feelings of helplessness
and guilt, thus minimising the difficult-
ies of bereavement. And best for society
because it is, quite simply, the cheapest
way to do the job. At its most expensive,
home care costs one-fifth of care in
hospital.
I’m particularly impressed with a
program in the making based in Vic-
toria’s Mornington Peninsula. The
Frankston Hospital, the Royal District
Nursing Service, the Chisholm Institute
and the division of general practice are
creating PHP the Peninsula Hospice
Program.
PHP has applied to the state and fed-
eral governments for sufficient funds to
provide 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-
week care for the dying and bereaved.
It’s founded on the simple belief that all
members of our society are entitled to
the best health care available even when
that care cannot cure the underlying
disease.
To quote Dr David Frey, the director
of the program: “The time is long past
when hospice can be seen as the hu-
mane alternative for the lucky few. It’s
in the government’s interests to keep the
dying out of the hospitals but it cannot
be done without resources.”
The PHP is also anxious to have a
voice in government legislation. “At the
moment, anyone without restriction
can open a hospice or become a ‘be-
reavement counsellor’. Look at the fu-
neral parlors. Yet the care of the dying
is not a field for well-meaning amateurs.
It requires highly skilled nurses backed
by the best medical symptom control
available.
“Care of the dying is not about hold-
ing hands, community singing or Man-
tovani playing in the background as the
sun sinks slowly over the West Gate
Bridge. It’s about the elimination of
pain and nausea, about opening com-
munication lines in the family, about
explosions of anger and grief and most
of all about living and dying with ques-
tions that have no answers.”
Talking about answers, Frey hopes
for the right answer from the Cain and
Hawke governments so that the pro-
gram can be running by August of this
year. “I am hopeful that the govern-
ments will choose to listen to the ‘still,
small voice’ of the dying,” he says.
“Self-interest suggests it and common
humanity demands it.”
I hope our politicians are listening.
However it must be recognised that the
dying are probably the least persuasive
pressure group. On the other hand, as
this column has reported, the dead have
some clout. Look at the way they kept
voting, for year after year, in Richmond
council elections. □

Fun and games around the Cape
DAVID M c NICOLL
MOST PEOPLE have heard the cry on
departing ocean liners: “All ashore
that’s going ashore.” Well, this was a bit
different. The voice was soft over the
intercom and the message was: “The
Blue Train is about to depart in five
minutes. Would all not travelling please
leave the train.”
This was Cape Town station, 10.25 in
the morning, and the gleaming, world-
famous Blue Train all 16 carriages
and 84 passengers was about to start
its one-day journey to Johannesburg. A
few curious passengers were still
examining the list of fellow travellers on
the platform notice board, seeing if they
knew anyone or if there was anyone
aboard they wished to avoid. At exactly
10.30, with no whistles or shouts and
scarcely a whish of movement, the Blue
Train sidled out of the station and we
were away.
To say the Blue Train is luxurious is
a fair statement. It claims, and achieves,
five-star hotel standards. Its service,
cleanliness and comfort put it among
the great train journeys of the world, if
not the most adventurous. It uses diesel
and electricity so there are no fumes.
The rails are welded so there is no rattle.
The soundproofing works. And because
the coaches are coupled permanently,
there is no apparent join between the
carriages. What’s more, the water in the
showers is piping hot.
The passengers: three Australians
(the other two were from Tamworth,
NSW), some Germans, many Ameri-
South Africa’s Blue Train: uncompromising luxury
cans, a couple of French, the rest South
Africans enjoying a $3OO (minimum)
train ride.
The South African landscape, in the
main, is majestic without being lush.
That’s how it is between the Cape and
Jo’burg: great mountains, stony valleys,
kilometres of Australian-looking semi-
desert country, with a few raggedy
sheep doing their best to get a feed from
the bushes.
But from the comfort of the compart-
ment it all looks wonderful as you lie
back and make a selection from the
radio channels in your room and take
an early peek at the menu. Then the
train turns a corner and you are con-
fronted by a fertile valley, studded with
white farmhouses and poplar trees.
Bophuthatswana’s Sun City: a multi-racial exhibition piece
Next valley, you’re back with the stony
outcrops.
The stations, when the Blue Train
pulls up for a moment’s contemplation
(it’s not to get water or take on passen-
gers but there must be some reason),
look like stations the world over: the
buildings a bit battered, the flowers
drooping.
Accommodation runs from singles to
three-room suites with their own lounge,
bedroom and private bathroom. The
train’s main lounge, outside the dining
car, holds 34 and is supervised by a bar-
man skilled at his work and surrounded
by bottles and masses of protea and
other flowers.
Conversation in the lounge car be-
fore lunch was a bit stilted but by the
time dinner came round you would
have thought the passengers had all
gone to school together. The food, inci-
dentally, was extremely good and the
wines (the magnificent products of the
Cape) quite outstanding.
The winter nights in South Africa put
up the shutters early, as they do in Aus-
tralia, and by six o’clock the Blue Train
was sliding forward in the dark, which
meant passengers didn’t see historic
Kimberley and the Orange River
bridge.
In the morning the attendants were
bustling round with tea and orange
juice and by Bam the overfed passengers
were being urged to stoke up again in
the dining car.
As the train neared Johannesburg,
the inevitable signs of a city’s industry
started to appear. Then the suburbs; a
strange interlocking of old English and
Afrikaner names Mayfair,
Grosvenor, Maraisburg, Westbury,
Langlaagte. You put aside your morn-

ing paper (which came aboard during
one of those mysterious stops) and pack
your bag. Then, at 1 lam on the dot, the
remarkable Blue Train gives a faint
whoosh of relief and pulls up in Johan-
nesburg station. A great train.
SUN CITY is in the independent inter-
nal state of Bophuthatswana, which in
deference to readers I shall refer to as
Bop. In a few words, it is unbelievably
inventive, extraordinarily garish with-
out being offensively so extremely at-
tractive, in some ways breathtaking
and it makes any Las Vegas hotel-casino
complex look like a Salvation Army
People’s Palace.
It is not merely the scale of the place
which makes you catch your breath. It is
the entertainment offered and ac-
cepted hungrily by the South Africans
living in the more restricted and often
suffocating atmosphere of the republic,
which borders Bop. It is no wonder the
South Africans pour in to Sun City in
their tens of thousands.
Before you get the idea that Sun City
is merely a gambling and cabaret set-up,
let me say that the South Africans who
pour in bring their children with them.
Sport is unlimited: the Gary Player-de-
signed golf course (one of the best in the
world), the man-made lake for water
skiing, the tennis and the play areas.
Around the resort is a game park where
wild animals roam almost to the Sun
City fences. There are cinemas, discos,
art galleries, shops, squash courts, bowl-
ing alleys and health studios. Sun City
has everything including facilities for
prayer and contemplation.
I flew into Sun City by night, landing
at Mmabatho international airport,
where passengers from all over the
world now jet in for fun and games, and
had dinner with the remarkable Peter
Wagner, the general manager who
keeps this incredible kingdom running
efficiently and completely Mafia-free.
What did I want to see first? Well,
the huge auditorium where Sinatra per-
formed. It holds 7000, in booked seats,
and the night before I arrived the Aus-
tralian lads known as Air Supply had
just finished a most successful season.
From there to the Extravaganza, where
I saw a stage show as good as any at the
Paris Lido or the Folies Bergere: Not
only the staggeringly attention-grabbing
chorus girls but also the settings. And
the special effects. In one sketch a huge
dragon comes out of a cage back-stage
and stretches his smoke-breathing
mouth 10 metres into the somewhat ap-
prehensive audience. It was hard to
choose, for enjoyment, between the Ex-
travaganza and the Dancing Machine,
the extraordinary attraction next door.
Gambling? Of course there’s gam-
bling, which is one of the reasons (plus
its platinum mines) that Bop is one of
the few affluent independent states.
There are currently 36 roulette tables, 21
for blackjack, two for craps and seven
for punto banco, to say nothing of 1000
one-armed bandits which display far
more solicitude towards the player than
any machines in Australia. There also is
bingo huge games where, for certain
combinations, lucky winners may walk
away with an Audi or a Porsche (and
the cars are right there for all to see).
The Sun City hotels provide accom-
modation for well over 1000 people,
with more opening soon.
But these rapidly-expanding ameni-
ties are only a small part of the reasons
for Wagner’s satisfaction. Wagner and
his team have proved that the black
African is capable of taking over white
responsibility in many directions. At
Sun City Wagner has a training school
and most of the Sun City staff are black,
every day showing ability to take over
supervisory jobs and even moving into
the intricate world of the croupier.
Sun City is a multi-racial exhibition
piece right on South Africa’s doorstep, a
place where black and white mingle to
enjoy themselves and where there is
complete equality and total absence of
tension. □

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
I bet you don’t gamble as much as us
WE HAVE just had Gamblers Anony-
mous Public Awareness Week. It was
launched very nicely in St Luke’s
church hall, South Melbourne, by'
Pauline Toner, minister for Community
Welfare Services.
Gamblers Anonymous, presumably,
is similar to Alcoholics Anonymous.
When you are in fearful trouble, about
to take another plunge, your 30th
Tattslotto for the week, you call up an-
other member of Gamblers Anonymous
and ask him to talk you out of it.
Victorians have become the biggest
addicts on Earth. Already we are fas-
tened to our TV screens every Wednes-
day and Saturday passionately fingering
our pieces of yellow paper drawn with
green squares. Tattslotto has even
higher ratings than cultural marvels
such as Sale of the Century , Perfect
Match and Love Boat.
It’s a state-wide fetish. Our corner
store is a Tatts agency. It’s almost im-
possible to buy anything, for all the
mums lining up filling out their Tatts
form the bi-weekly ultimate dream.
Just as Toner was launching
GAPAW, Tatts was launching a new
game called Tatts Two. This is a simple,
daily, cosy fix. You just select two num-
bers for 50 cents and, if that’s too diffi-
cult, you can get a Quick Pick entry
which does it for you. The minimum
prize for a correct entry is $5OO.
It is just marvellous what gambling
bargains are around, a sort of splendid
K-Mart range. There’s the Tattslotto on
Wednesdays and Saturdays, the weekly
Super 66 draw, the Instant Tatts scratch
numbers, the Tatts $1 and $2 lotteries,
the $lO Black Cat tickets, the $4 Quick
Draw and the Melbourne Cup Consola-
tion to say nothing of the TAB plus
Footy Bets and Footy Quadrella.
One can only trust that Premier John
Cain is a member of Gamblers Anony-
mous and that whenever he thinks of a
new form of gambling he calls Neville
Wran to talk him out of it.
Tattersall’s in Victoria has a turnover
of nearly $4OO million a year and the
revenue to the government from gam-
bling is $lB7 million, $47.90 from every
man, woman and child; 12 percent of
the total tax collection. According to the
Gallup Poll, we are the most devoted
gamblers: 55 percent of Victorians take
part in the weekly Tattslotto draw,
against a national lotto average of 41
percent.
But we are going in harder.
Tattslotto is planning all sorts of new
ideas. We have been promised Take 5, a
system where a player has to get only
five numbers to win. Normally to carry
off a Division 1 prize you have to get six.
What with this new world of high
technology, the time is not far off when
you will be able to get your gambling fix
quicker and more efficiently. Jim Fair,
chief executive of Tattersall’s, said last
week that the latest invention was the
instant lottery by courtesy of a video
screen.
You have your own consumer-ac-
tivated terminal and if you want to play
lotto you touch the screen and it dis-
plays a coupon. You pick the six num-
bers you want and instantly you know
whether you have done your money.
Another development is the magnetic
card. Every week your numbers are in
your magnetic card and, if you want to
play, you put your card into the termin-
al and your account is debited auto-
matically.
Already we are the most devoted lot-
tery people on Earth and we cast our
lots at double the rate of anyone in Eur-
ope. We may be slipping behind with
some skills failing to make cars,
losing the technological battle but our
gambling is superbly efficient.
The Victorian TAB is expected to hit
a record $1 billion turnover by racing
season’s end on July 31. The TAB has
promoted itself very well during the
year, urging us at all times to bet more.
We have a new chairman, American
business computer and management ex-
pert Robert Nordlinger. He calls the
TAB a sleeping giant. He says it has one
of the finest computer systems in the
country but it is using only a small pro-
portion of capacity.
He wants betting for other sports and
customers to use TAB facilities for pay-
ing gas bills and electricity bills or
maybe even booking theatre tickets.
It will be fascinating to see how this
works. Would you go down to the TAB
and say to the teller: “I’d like double my
gas bill on Son of Pongo for the third”
or “Could I bet two tickets in the dress
circle for Medea on Neville’s Pride for
the Futurity Handicap?”?
You have a deep feeling of sympathy
for governments trying to talk people
out of dangerous habits on the one hand
yet collecting money on the other.
There’s a problem of the smokers.
Health minister Tom Roper has just
spent $283,000 on a “No Butts” anti-
smoking campaign. But it would be a
disaster if people actually stopped.
Smoking is worth $BOO million a year to
the federal government alone.
Cain has the most savage legislation
in the world against drink-driving but it
would be the ruin of us all if we stopped
drinking.
Every time you and I take a drink
we are helping to support a public
servant, pay the pension of a member of
parliament or keep a boy in uniform.
Drinkers contribute $ll9 million a year
to the federal coffers and make further
contributions to every state.
Maybe the real drug is taxation. We
should have a Taxers Anonymous.
Whenever Paul, John, Joh, Neville et al
feel an insatiable urge to raise another
tax to cull our weaknesses such as gam-
bling, smoking and drinking, they could
call a fellow member and get a quick
serve on not doing it. □


A few coins for the mountin’
RON SAW
LONG BEFORE he became a
sharebroker in Perth, my grandfather
was a bank manager at Southern Cross,
WA, and it was to his branch of the old
Commercial Bank that two bug-eyed
prospectors bore the Big Ben nugget
one night in 1894.
(It is on record that Charlie Saw
answered the door of the manager’s
residence wearing long-johns, looked at
the nugget, which was 850 oz gross
weight, and delivered the deathless line
“Jesus Christ!” But already I digress.)
Gold wasn’t worth $4OO an ounce
then but Ben was worth enough to
finance a damn good party and that
party was held at “Mrs Harrison’s”
whorehouse in Southern Cross.
A whorehouse! Eheu! Even now the
noisier wowsers will be dipping their
pens in horror. Why a whorehouse?
they will ask. Well, why not?
The prospectors and their bankers
wanted to enjoy themselves. In those
days, the eastern goldfields of WA bore
almost no resemblance to Bellevue Hill
or Peppermint Grove or Toorak. As my
grandfather told my father, who told
me, “Mrs Harrison’s” at least had a few
polished tables and chairs, a few carpets
and curtains. And soft beds: nobody
went there to drink tea.
“The nearest they could get to
luxury, even a sort of respectability,”
said my father, “was an old-fashioned
cat-house. I suppose you call them
brothels now.” We didn’t: we called
them drums or knockers.
Anyway, the party lasted nearly a
week and I daresay Mrs H allowed her
girls to offer a few bargain rates for ex-
tended business; and a whoopee time
was had by all.
There! I’ve said it! I’ve been vaguely
approbatory about prostitution, have
even suggested that the sex act might be
enjoyable. Will somebody burn feathers
under the snout of the Rev Fred Nile?
Lately there has been a wailing of
wowsers, a howling of hypocrites, such
a stirring of the pros and cons of prosti-
tution that even the Rev David
Haselhurst, The Bulletin’s ascetic-in-
chief, has been sent to shrive the sinners
of Hay Street, Kalgoorlie.
Having enjoyed myself in the odd
knocker never having “made an ex-
cuse and left,” as is the practice of so
many investigative reporters I asked a
few women’s libbers what really was so
wrong with prostitution.
Brutal and dehumanising, I was told.
Ninety percent of the girls and probably
as many of the boys in the profession
are selling their bodies to support drug
habits.
But what about prostitution per se?
To have a drug habit is certainly a
shame. But to stop a junkie hustling to
raise the price of a fix is the same as
asking her or him to go out and steal or
kill to raise it.
And what is so wrong with paying
for an undeniable pleasure?
Wine is enjoyable whether you pay
for it or not. So is music. And going to
the movies, watching TV, reading books
or emptying one’s bowels. I don’t hear
many people wailing about the
dehumanising of the vignerons, the pro-
ducers, the publishers or the manufac-
turers of good, fibrous breakfast foods.
So what in God’s name is wrong with
enjoying sex? What’s wrong with a good
whore or a good whorehouse?
About 50 years ago, I believe, there
were some beauts in Perth. By the time I
started shaving more or less regularly
there was but one old-fashioned
knocker left. Old-fashioned meant that
one of the girls played the piano and the
others danced with the customers for as
long as they could wait before rushing
off to get at it.
And if you didn’t behave yourself, if
you were foul-mouthed, violent or
drunk, you were denied the pleasures of
the house and forever you bore the
shameful label: “Sorta bloke who gets a
knockback in a brothel.” Even that title
tended to suggest that there was some-
thing dreary about going to a brothel,
whereas it was a lot of fun.
The newspapermen in Perth used to
have parties in the old Press Pavilion of
the WACA ground and most parties
would wind up with a knocker raffle. All
hands reporters, photog-
raphers, artists, editors
would buy tickets at two
shillings a time, which was
the equivalent of about $l,
I suppose. The raffle would
be drawn and the winner
carried off, often scream-
ing, to Roe Street. He was
pushed in with a saucer of
40 or 50 florins. It wasn’t
the conventional way of
hiring a whore but the
loose change could appeal
to the girls who had piggy-
banks.
It meant waiting around
for a while but those who
didn’t care for waiting in
the street could, and often did, drop in
for a quickie or even a longie at an-
other, or even the same, knocker.
The knocker raffle usually was rigged
in favor of the party’s guest of honor
and perhaps the most famous raffle of
all favored a young photographer who
was to go to the altar, almost certainly
virginal, the next day.
He was carried howling and strug-
gling to the wired door and the dish of
florins was passed in. He didn’t break
and run but went to his defloration like
a man.
About 20 minutes later, there was a
ragged cheer as he emerged and as we
left Roe Street then came the inevitable
questions: “How was it? ... good sort?
... Get yer two-bob back?” the last a
reference to Guy de Maupassant’s im-
mortal story of the cadet from St Cyr,
one of thousands who entered a franc-a-
ticket knocker raffle, who won and who
pleasured a rich and famous whore so
splendidly that she gave him his franc
back.
“I s’pose it was okay,” said the young
photog, “but I’ll never go back with a
plateful of two-bobs.
“The madam was away when I went
in and if the girl could get all those
coins into her piggy-bank good and
quick she wouldn’t have to cough up her
50 percent commission.
“Well, we got on the cot and ... you
know ... all that and she was lying there
pushing all these coins into her piggy-
bank. Clink ... clink ... clink.
“It was ‘C’mon, luv .. . clink, ping,
clink ... hurry up, luv ... clink ... ping
... the madam’ll be back any minute.’
Well, we got it over but...
“Somehow that pinging seemed to
take all the romance out of it.” □

See You in September?
Dobrynin dines with President Reagan: 'I am hoping for the best, ’ the Soviet ambassador said later,‘but I am not a magician'
Washington is ready for arms talks, but Moscow won’t take ‘yes’ for an answer.
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin
isn’t exactly a pampered favorite of the
Reagan administration, but last week he
found himself being courted like an unde-
cided voter in a close election. At a White
House barbecue for foreign diplomats, Do-
brynin, the dean of the diplomatic corps, sat
between President Reagan and Secretary of
State George Shultz, chatting amiably with
them for the better part of an hour. That
evening, and again two days later, Do-
brynin met privately with Shultz, who as-
sured him that the administration was eager
for arms talks with the Soviet Union. When
he carried the American message back to
Moscow, Dobrynin told reporters noncom-
mittally: “I am hoping for the best, but I am
not a magician.”
By the end of the week it still wasn’t clear
whether any diplomatic legerdemain would
enable the two superpowers to start negoti-
ating again on arms control. Reagan had
accepted Moscow’s proposal for a meeting
in Vienna next September to discuss limita-
tions on weapons in outer space. But he also
wanted to bring up the subject of reviving
the stalled talks on long-range and interme-
diate-range nuclear weapons. Moscow ac-
cused Reagan of setting “preconditions” for
Vienna and said his acceptance of its in vita-
tion was unacceptable. But the Soviets also
said their offer was still open, and senior
U.S. officials expected that the Kremlin
eventually would agree to go ahead with the
Vienna talks. In any case, White House
spokesman Larry Speakes promised: “We
will be there in September.”
Windfalls: Whether or not the Soviets
show up, Reagan stands to gain. By quickly
accepting Moscow’s offer, he may have tak-
en the edge off the arms-control issue in the
presidential campaign, undercutting those
who accuse him of being an intransigent
hard-liner with a “button problem.” The
Soviet initiative was the latest in a series of
foreign-policy windfalls for Reagan. In the
Middle East, Lebanon was cooling down, at
least for the moment, and Israel appeared to
be on the verge of electing a Labor Party
government that will try to revive the peace
process. In Central America, El Salvador
had a robustly democratic new president,
while Reagan’s “secret war” against Nica-
ragua seemed to be running out of steam.
The president deserved little or no credit for
those developments, but they were likely to
improve his re-election chances anyway.
The prospective talks on weapons in
space may yet confront Reagan with some
new pitfalls. The Soviets, who are genuinely
worried about U.S. advances in space weap-
onry, already have added a precondition of
their own: a moratorium on the testing of
antisatellite weapons. If he is to get the
Vienna talks started—and keep them from
collapsing before Election Day—Reagan
may have to override his own hard-liners,
who believe that the best deal on space
weapons would be to have no deal at all.
When it issued its invitation two weeks
ago, Moscow specified that it wanted to
“prevent the militarization of outer space”
and completely ban antisatellite weapons,
Reagan quickly agreed; most of his arms-
control advisers were out of town, which cut
down on the in-house debate. Although
Washington promised to talk about weap-
ons in space, it seemed to be more inter-
ested in looking for ways to resume the
Geneva talks on strategic-arms reductions
(START) and on intermediate-range forces
in Europe (INF), which were halted late
last year by Soviet walkouts. Last week
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
accused the United States of trying to
“bury” the space talks by bringing up the
subject of START and INF. A quick rebut-
tal came from British Foreign Secretary Sir
Geolfrey Howe, who was visiting Moscow.
After checking with his allies in Washing


ton, Howe assured Soviet President Kon-
stantin Chernenko that there were no
American preconditions. But later, at a
news conference, Howe said the men in the
Kremlin seemed “unwilling to take ‘yes’
for an answer.”
Arrest: Moscow’s line seemed to harden
on the Fourth of July. Soviet officials
abruptly canceled plans for a routine televi-
sion address by U.S. Ambassador Arthur
Hartman. And on a Moscow street, a dozen
Soviet security agents pounced on a pair of
U.S. diplomats just after a purported wom-
an dissident handed them some documents.
The diplomats, political officer Jon Purnell
and consular official George Glass, were
manhandled, held for two hours and were
not allowed to call their embassy promptly;
they never learned what was in the docu-
ments. The woman, later identified by the
authorities as “citizen L. B. Tumanova,”
was accused of giving Purnell and Glass
information “of interest to American intel-
ligence and centers for ideological sabo-
tage.” U.S. sources worried that, as a result
of the incident, Moscow and Washington
might get involved in tit-for-tat expulsions
of each other’s diplomats.
The Soviets may have been blustering
because they had painted themselves into a
corner on arms control. They insisted for
months that they would not resume the
START and INF talks unless NATO re-
moved the new intermediate-range missiles
that it began to deploy in Western Europe
late last year. Then the Reagan administra-
tion cleverly attached START and INF to
the proposed talks in Vienna on weapons in
space. The Soviets are eager for those negoti-
ations. They want to head olf an astronomi-
cally expensive arms race in outer space, and
evidently they are concerned about recent
U.S. progress in developing new space weap-
ons. It seemed to be no coincidence that
Moscow proposed the meeting in Vienna
only two weeks after a U.S. Minuteman
U.S-Soviet arms talks: ‘We’ll resume the count after the election...okay?’‘Okay!’
rocket was used to shoot down an incoming
missile—a successful test of the theory be-
hind Reagan’s “Star Wars” defense plan.
The United States also appears to be on
the verge of developing a workable antisat-
ellite (ASAT) system. Last January it suc-
cessfully test-fired a rocket that would be
launched from an airborne F-15 jet fighter
against satellites in low orbit. Another test is
expected in November —which helps to ex-
plain why the Kremlin wants to hold the
Vienna meeting before then and insists on a
testing moratorium. The Soviets have an
ASAT weapon of their own, based on the
elderly SS-9 missile. But the U. S. Senate was
told in secret session last month that the
Soviet system has a success rate of only
about 45 percent and doesn’t seem to be
getting any better.
Thaw: If the White House is to have any
chance at all of getting the arms-control
process moving again, it will have to steer a
course between hard-liners in both Moscow
and Washington. The Kremlin said late last
week that there could be no talks on space
weapons unless the United States promised
to keep other items off the agenda. Officials
at the Pentagon and the CIA, meantime,
aren’t sure they want the Vienna talks at all.
They oppose a moratorium on antisatellite
testing, much less a treaty banning those
weapons; they argue that such arrange-
ments would be unverifiable and would pre-
vent Washington from making a great leap
forward in ASAT technology.
White House officials are still hoping for
some evidence of a superpower thaw on
arms control before Election Day, and that
means finding a formula that will at least
permit the Vienna talks to begin. Beyond
that, Washington doesn’t yet have a negoti-
ating strategy. So far, however, Ronald
Reagan has done pretty well for himself just
by saying that he’s willing to talk.

An Old Bolshevik Returns
Molotov with Stalin: Mindless obedience
SOVFOTO
The little man with the mustache
and the pince-nez was the kind of
communist Joseph Stalin liked. In
30 years at Stalin’s side, Vyacheslav
Molotov embodied mindless obedi-
ence. In 1949 an anti-Semitic Stalin
purge even swept Molotov’s wife, Po-
lina Zhemchuzhina, into exile. Molo-
tov did not protest. The purge, he said,
was a matter of “party discipline.”
Last week the Soviet Foreign Min-
istry confirmed that, at 94, Molotov
had been readmitted to the Commu-
nist Party. Molotov’s career foun-
dered in 1957, when he and other old
Stalinists lost out in a power struggle
with Nikita Khrushchev. He was ex-
pelled from the Politburo and, in
1962, from the party. But Khru-
shchev was kinder to Molotov than
Stalin was to his victims. Molotov
was allowed to retire in Moscow,
where he worked on his memoirs.
Molotov’s reinstatement may be
a sentimental gesture to an old Bol-
shevik, but it has a symbolic impact
as well. Soviet political debate
often takes the form of oblique argu-
ments for—and against—Stalinism.
By reinstating Molotov, the present
Politburo signals that it leans to the
hard-line side of the Soviet spectrum.


U.S. AFFAIRS
CAMPAIGN'84
Can Mondale
Pull It Together?
With blacks, Jews and women restive and still no
No. 2, the Democrats slouch toward San Francisco.
Walter Mondale spent much of last
week in the comfortable surround-
ings of his home on Thrush Lane in North
Oaks, Minn., immersed in the pleasant and
faintly regal process of interviewing poten-
tial vice presidential nominees. He talked to
Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins and
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York; he
had a congenial chat with Henry Cisneros,
the young Hispanic mayor of San Antonio,
who is among the Democratic Party’s rising
stars. Mondale wore his favorite lumberjack
shirts and crew-neck sweaters, found time
for a sandlot softball game and clearly en-
joyed the respite from the rigors of the pri-
mary campaign. But he ended the week with
his most urgent task, naming a running
mate, not much closer to completion than
when the selection process began. And with
his all-but-certain nomination by the Demo-
cratic Convention less than a week off, there
were disturbing signs that the November
election could be slipping away.
By nearly every measure, in fact, Mon-
dale’s interlude in North Oaks had become a
political quagmire. His much-ballyhooed
search for a running mate looked like a
parody of affirmative action: he seemed bent
on mollifying every subconstituency in the
Democratic Party, and he appeared to be a
prisoner of his own methodical political
style. Last week he was further embarrassed
by the late-blooming threat of a feminist
insurrection in San Francisco, and he was
clearly having difficulty in finding a suitable
running mate of any description; as the days
wore on he went beyond the public list of
interviewees, and there was every chance
that he would look still further this week.
Even though Mondale’s wary rapproche-
ment with Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson
seemed to have achieved a peaceful conven-
tion, the truce was very fragile. At the week-
end, Hart criticized Mondale for “pander-
ing” to women and minorities. He later
retreated, but the damage was done. And in
the deepening rift between blacks and Jews
over Jackson’s role in the party, Mondale
faced the risk of alienating both groups.
Most of all, Mondale’s campaign seemed
stalled: it was slouching toward San Fran-
cisco as if time and the electoral tides were on
his side, when clearly they were not.
The proof of his predicament was in the
polls: since the end of the primary season,
Mondale has slipped badly with mainstream
American voters, the ultimate target of any
presidential campaign. By one national poll,
he has lost fully 10 points in trial heats
against Ronald Reagan since clinching the
nomination —an ominous trend rare in the
history of recent presidential campaigns.
The same Gallup Organization survey put
Mondale 19 points behind Reagan—the
largest margin at this stage in any presiden-
tial race since the McGovern debacle of
1972. A CBS-New York Times poll, mean-
while, showed that naming Hart as his run-
ning mate would help Mondale cut the mar-
gin almost in half —hardly good news, given
the Mondale team’s deep misgivings about
Hart’s suitability for the ticket.
Mondale stuck to his script, immersed in
the necessary details of intraparty business.
He flew to Kansas City for a subdued meet-
ing with Jesse Jackson, just back from Cuba
and now contemplating other high-visibility
strategems. He also flew to Boston for talks
with Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachu-
setts and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
both said to be on his wish list for the vice
presidential nomination. Mondale also
picked up 18 more delegates to firm up the
nomination itself, and his staff was working
on stage-managing an orderly convention.
“Considering where we were a month ago,”
said top aide John Reilly, “we’ve made tre-
mendous progress.”
Help: That was true up to a point—but it
overlooked the void on the other half of the
ticket. Mondale’s requirements were clear:
he desperately needed a running mate who
was an experienced campaigner, who would
add regional appeal to the ticket, and who
could fire up the troops. Despite the self-
created hoopla of his “historic” exercise in
equal opportunity, the question of whether
his choice would be a woman, a black, a
Hispanic or an Anglo-Saxon male was essen-
tially beside the point. Mondale defended
the process as “breaking new ground” for
women and minorities. But given his dismal
standing in the polls, he simply needed
help—and not all of his interviewees seemed
to be vice presidential, let alone presidential,
timber. “They’ve taken a good idea and run
it into the ground,” complained one Demo-
cratic strategist. The better-known national

politicians reportedly under consideration
for veep at one time or another were unavail-
able or uninterested: Sen. Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas, Florida Gov. Robert Graham
and Cuomo of New York all were saying no,
at least for the moment.
Meanwhile, Mondale was forced to fend
off incipient rebellion by the eager feminists
of the National Organization for Women,
which had endorsed him early on and ec-
statically welcomed his promise to seriously
consider a woman running mate. Mondale
reiterated that promise at the NOW conven-
tion in Miami on June 30: on July 1, NOW
approved a resolution threatening a floor
fight in San Francisco if Mondale’s nominee
was unacceptable. By the end of the week,
the seriousness of that threat seemed to have
faded —but the spectacle of a feminist revolt
on prime-time television was clearly the last
thing Mondale needed. At midweek, a dele-
gation of leading women Democrats jour-
neyed to Minnesota to help defuse the situa-
tion. “We wouldn’t presume to tell him what
to do,” said New York City Council presi-
dent Carol Bellamy. “It is his decision.”
Mondale also downplayed the ruckus.
“Why should women be expected to be less
assertive in pursuing an objective that had
been long delayed?” he asked.
But the impression that Mondale’s veep
parade, as Hart said, was “a little like pan-
dering” seemed to be taking hold —the more
so since Mondale was considering candi-
dates who had not made the pilgrimage to
Thrush Lane. Indeed, the talk of North Oaks
was that three of the seven pilgrims were
already fading. Collins and Mayor Wilson
Goode of Philadelphia both have been in
office only a short time, and Ferraro, the
consensus favorite among women’s activ-
ists, failed to demonstrate anything more
than political savvy. That left Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley, San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and Cisneros.
Hart’s ‘Spiritual Adviser '
Who is Gary Hart? What really makes
him tick? Political reporters have been
scrambling all over Kansas, Colorado and
Washington in the last year to answer that
question with varying degrees of success.
Enter Gail Sheehy, a chronicler of con-
temporary emotional development (in
books like “Passages”), on assignment for
trendy Vanity Fair magazine and deter-
mined to find what others had missed. The
result: a controversial article in the cur-
rent issue that, in mapping Hart’s guarded
psychic terrain, highlights Indian mysti-
cism, primitive ceremonies, the brushing
of eagle feathers and an attractive Indian
woman described by Sheehy as “perhaps
[Hart’s] closest friend, a soul mate” from
197 Bto 1980 —and by Hart himself as “my
spiritual adviser.”
“Terribly inaccurate,” complained
Hart. “. . .lam not a mystic.’’But some of
his aides saw it in part as a self-inflicted
wound —stemming from the senator’s dry
humor, sincere interest in matters spiritu-
al and real affection for the woman in
question, a devoted supporter named
Marilyn Youngbird. Whatever the facts,
and whatever the distortion in Sheehy’s
psychojournalism, Walter Mondale’s ad-
visers were amused by any hint of Hart as
an oddball subscriber to Teepee Guide—
and by Hart’s defensive
denials. “The guy always
manages to dig himself in
deeper,” said one.
How important Young-
bird is or was to Hart may
be debatable. But most of
the key points in Sheehy’s
story seem roughly cor-
rect. Sheehy is hardly the
first to paint Hart as a man
whose difficulty in open-
ing up emotionally to most
people has limited his po-
litical appeal. Youngbird
was an exception, says
Sheehy. A lively grand-
The controversial issue
mother who works at the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, Youngbird has for years supplied
Hart with prophecies (including one of his
surprise triumph in New Hampshire), re-
ligious articles (the prayer shawl on his
office wall) and spiritual prescriptions.
“Get away from everybody. Hug a tree,”
said a note from Youngbird that Hart was
carrying when he talked with Sheehy.
‘Lighthearted’: Youngbird, who was
avoiding reporters, is an infrequent visitor
to Hart’s offices, and Sheehy sensed that
the woman actually was using her as a
communication channel to him. Still,
Hart did not deny calling Youngbird his
spiritual adviser. “I suppose I meant that
she had offered interesting or positive ad-
vice,” he said in a TV interview. Later,
Hart called his description “lightheart-
ed,” but another reporter involved in that
discussion of Youngbird agrees that Hart
had spoken “with great fondness of her as
an old friend and someone whom he took
very seriously.”
Hart also confirmed an encounter with
eagle feathers in a ceremony several years
ago. But he noted that it was a well-attend-
ed public affair—a dedication ceremony
in a Denver park—that he had joined as
part of his Senate campaign. Sheehy never
mentioned those details, relying instead
on overheated recollec-
tions that —according to a
review of interview tran-
scripts made available to
Newsweek —she helped
prompt from Youngbird:
“So romantic, so beautiful.
It was like poetry.” Says
Sheehy: “It sounds sen-
sual, almost.” “Oh yes,”
Youngbird replies. Sheehy
adds to the confusion with
some steamy details of
a “purification” ceremony
that Hart declined to at-
tend —as he apparently de-
clined other such invita-
A man of the West: Overly defensive
tions from Youngbird. “To pray with the
Indians, you must take off your clothes
and shed your public mask,” writes
Sheehy, though it seems that saronglike
garments —not nudity—are de rigueur.
‘Change’: Sheehy says her piece was not
intended to be a hatchet job on Hart. She
sees the candidate as an engaging intellect
willing to explore the unconventional and
continually “redefine” himself in many
areas. “In a world where changes are so
stunningly rapid ... it would be tragic if
we prevent change and development in
our national leaders,” says the author. The
pace of change today disturbs many
Americans. Ronald Reagan, Sheehy says,
“is a finished product . . . comforting.
There are no surprises.” That, as her own
article demonstrates, is something that
still cannot be said about Gary Hart.

It also left Mario Cuomo, the convention
keynote speaker and a politically hot proper-
ty. Mondale’s stated purpose in meeting
Cuomo in Boston last week was to confer
about his speech —but he was also eager to
see if Cuomo was ready to change his mind
about the vice presidency. Aides said Mon-
dale was ready to pounce if Cuomo brought
up the subject; Cuomo didn’t, and the search
for a veep candidate with star quality went
on. “If it’s pizzazz they want,” grumbled
Lloyd Bentsen, “I’d like to suggest another
Texan —Willie Nelson.”
Mondale’s Jesse Jackson problem, how-
ever, was no laughing matter —for it was a
somber example of the difficulties he faces in
keeping the Democratic coalition together.
Making peace with Jackson was the easier
part: in Kansas City last week, Jackson
glumly acknowledged Mondale as the par-
ty’s nominee, and Mondale aide Bob Beckel
worked out a rough agreement to give Jack-
son the ‘ ‘respect” (and the television time) he
wants in San Francisco. But Jackson has also
come to symbolize the simmering tensions
between blacks and Jews —and in the end,
there may be no way for Mondale to keep
both groups happy. The crux of that dilem-
ma is of course Jackson’s erstwhile alliance
with Black Muslim Louis Farrakhan; al-
though Jackson recently repudiated Farra-
khan’s anti-Semitic slurs, a handful of influ-
ential Jewish leaders want Mondale to
repudiate Jackson. He cannot do it; theblack
vote is too important in November. And
when, at the NAACP convention in Kansas
City last week, Mondale tried to equate
Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism with the racism
of the Ku Klux Klan, he was greeted with
stony silence and a single, sullen boo.
Toe to Toe: Difficult as his current prob-
lems within the party are, Mondale must
soon go toe to toe with one of the better
campaigners in modern times. Last week,
Ronald Reagan was on a re-election roll,
finding blue-collar voters surprisingly sym-
pathetic in traditionally Democratic areas
of the Midwest and the Deep South and
basking in the June unemployment statis-
tics, which showed that the nation’s jobless
rate had dropped to 7.1 percent, the lowest
level since 1980. Mondale needs more than a
vice presidential nominee to get back in the
race: he needs unity in San Francisco, and he
needs to focus the nation’s attention on the
vast ideological gap that separates him from
the most conservative president in years.
Late last week Mondale finally began to
do just that, jumping to attack Reagan’s
suggestion that the finances of the social-
security system still need shoring up. “Once
again he raises the question that they’re
going to alter it and undermine seniors’
security,” Mondale said. “After the ’BO elec-
tion that’s exactly what they did. I wonder if
they’re getting ready again.” It was a faint
rallying cry for Democrats —and for the
happy warrior of Thrush Lane, it was the
first step down a very long road.

Jackson at the end of the rainbow: An ‘option’ and a ‘lifetime dream’
And Now, Senator Jackson?
Jesse Jackson had ostensibly gone to
South Carolina for a holiday visit with his
family—and to rest up for the upcoming
Democratic convention in San Francisco.
But the platoon of key staffers and advisers
accompanying him to Greenville hadn’t
come for a July 4th picnic. And at the week-
end, a whiff of a dramatic new political
scheme was mingling with the scent of left-
over barbecue. Jackson, whose rainbow co-
alition will fall short of the pot of gold next
week, is seriously considering running for
the U.S. Senate in his native state against
venerable South Carolina conservative
Strom Thurmond, 81.
In a coy approach reminiscent of his early
presidential campaign, Jackson would only
concede that a Senate bid is “an option . . .
not an option that I am pursuing at this
point, but it certainly is a live option.” The
legal obstacles to a Jackson candidacy in
South Carolina are remarkably few; all Jack-
son—a Chicago resident—must do is an-
nounce his intention to reside in South Caro-
lina, which he has already done, and collect
10,000 valid signatures before Aug. I—a
meager effort for the man who outpolled
Walter Mondale and Gary Hart combined
in the South Carolina Democratic caucus.
For now, Jackson insists that his South
Carolina efforts are on behalf of Cecil Wil-
liams, a black photographer who alleged
voting irregularities in his close Senate pri-
mary loss to Melvin Purvis, a white minister
and son of the famed G-man who captured
John Dillinger. Williams himself tele-
grammed Jackson proposing his candidacy
“in case I’m not able to run.” Still, Jackson
couldn’t conceal his glee over the prospect of
challenging Thurmond. “Given his posture
and mine,” Jackson said, “I would find a
chance to debate Strom Thurmond several
times an absolute delight, a lifetime dream. ”
Thurmond’s re-election team appeared
indifferent to the challenge—and they
scoffed at the idea of a head-to-head debate
between the two. “The people know where
Strom Thurmond stands after 20-some-odd
years in the Senate, ” said campaign manager
Terry Hill. That could prove to be the ieast of
Jackson’s disappointments. For one thing,
his candidacy would contradict his recently
stated commitment to party unity: state
Democratic chairman William Young-
blood has declared publicly that the party
would have to support Purvis over Jackson
“if the two-party system is to have any mean-
ing.” Even more important,
Jackson would almost cer-
tainly lose. Only 28 percent
of South Carolina’s regis-
tered voters are black, and
Democratic sources believe
Jackson wouldn’t attract
more than 5 percent of the
white vote.
Vow: Jackson is unlikely
to announce his decision un-
til after the convention —
and hints that what happens
in San Francisco will go a
long way toward making up
his mind. The not-so-veiled
LARRY DOWNING— Newsweek
Thurmond
threat is that if he doesn’t get enough of what
he wants, he won’t be motivated to work
hard for the national ticket this fall, leaving
him free to pursue other options. Still, it is
hard to imagine Jackson confining his jet-
stream to any single place. Last week, de-
spite pointed diplomatic objections from
Ronald Reagan, he vowed that before the
election he will take his moral crusade to the
Soviet Union —this time on behalf of Andrei
Sakharov and other Soviet dissidents.

Cutting Off the Contras
Contras training in Costa Rica: Dwindling funds, military losses and hard feelings
CLAUDE URRACA— SYGMA
The rebels suddenly find themselves on the defensive.
Little more than a month ago, Nicara-
gua’s CIA-backed contras seemed to be
making progress in their war against the
Sandinista government. With 12,000 men
under arms, they had driven deep into
northern Nicaragua, once destroying gov-
ernment facilities in the provincial capital of
Ocotal. But last week the contras were back
on the defensive —and on the verge of de-
spair. Their Honduran hosts had forced
them to close two key installations and to
adopt a lower profile in the Honduran capi-
tal of Tegucigalpa. And the U.S. Congress
had voted down the $2l million in “emer-
gency” aid the rebels had counted on to
keep the war alive. “The United States is the
worst ally a democratic force can have,”
Oscar Leonardo Montalban, a spokesman
for the Nicaraguan Democratic Forces
(FDN), charged bitterly. “We are going to
see another Bay of Pigs in Nicaragua.”
Both rebel officials and American intelli-
gence sources insisted that the contras
could survive the latest setbacks. They
pointed out that the Sandinistas had prob-
lems of their own: the Nicaraguan military
has been compelled to conscript young men
forcibly, and the drawn-out campaign
against the rebels has severely disrupted the
local economy. But the aid cutoff seems sure
to hurt the rebels badly: one FDN source
said they had already run out of money and
were barely able to provide food for their
men in the field. Stockpiles of arms and
ammunition should keep the contras going
for a while. Administration sources also
said the contras were engaged in an active
effort to secure funds from private sources.
But for the time being, the rebels will almost
certainly have to curtail their offensive op-
erations to conserve resources.
The cutoff of U.S. funds was also worri-
some to Honduran officials, who feared that
thousands of FDN rebels might soon aban-
don the mountains of Nicaragua and seek
refuge in Honduras. “What am I going to do
with 12,000 fighters here?” demanded Gen.
Walter Lopez Reyes, the Honduran com-
mander in chief. After the Sandinista revo-
lution in 1979, several hundred National
Guardsmen loyal to former President An-
astasio Somoza Debayle fled to southern
Honduras. They supported themselves by
stealing chickens, rustling cattle and com-
mitting acts of petty thievery. All of that
remains fresh in Honduran memories.
Flood: That recollection was clearly a fac-
tor in Tegucigalpa’s new crackdown on the
contras. The military said it ordered the
rebels to close a field hospi-
tal and a command center
near Tegucigalpa. Foreign
Minister Edgardo Paz Bar-
nica also hinted that further
restrictions might soon be
imposed. “Honduras will
never be used as a trampo-
line for aggression,” he de-
clared. “This is a country
with a government that ori-
ents its policies toward
peace.” Most of the contra
fighters are now based inside
Nicaragua. But the FDN
still relies on staging areas
and refueling depots inside
Honduran territory to run
its small fleet of Huey heli-
copters, light aircraft and a
C-47 cargo plane. Any fur-
ther Honduran restrictions
would severely hamper lo-
gistical support for FDN
troops across the border.
The Honduran crack-
down may also have been
Pastora: A bid for support
J. L. ATLAN— SYGMA
meant as a warning to the Reagan adminis-
tration. At a special meeting of the Hon-
duran National Security Council last week,
cabinet ministers and top military officers
weighed the possibility of demanding
changes in a 1954 military-assistance treaty
between Tegucigalpa and Washington.
They were particularly annoyed that U.S.
advisers had used a military camp in Hon-
duras last year to train 1,500 troops from El
Salvador, but only 700 Hondurans. Lopez
Reyes has demanded that the training ratio
be adjusted to favor Honduran troops. He
may also insist that a longstanding border
dispute between Honduras and El Salvador
be settled before allowing Salvadorans to
continue using the training camp. The Hon-
durans can also be expected to ask Washing-
ton for more money. Officials in Teguci-
galpa have complained that the United
States proposes to provide as much eco-
nomic aid per capita to neutral Costa Rica
as it does to Honduras in 1985.
Over the short term, the best hope for the
contras still appeared to lie in an alliance
between the FDN and the Democratic Rev-
olutionary Alliance (ARDE), the other
Nicaraguan rebel group operating out of
Costa Rica. Until recently, ARDE leader
Eden Pastora had blocked such a union. But
two weeks ago Pastora broke with ARDE;
now ARDE leaders are expected to meet
with FDN officials to announce an alliance
within weeks. Still, with ARDE battered by
internal strife and repeated military set-
backs, the union may give the contras only a
limited amount of new strength.
Pastora himself was in the United States
last week, sending strong signals that he
might abandon the battlefield for a political
campaign against the Sandinistas. Still
limping after a bomb attack that almost
killed him last month, Pas-
tora held a press conference
with Arturo Cruz, the re-
spected former Nicaraguan
ambassador to Washington
who broke with the Sandin-
istas in 1981. He also called
on the junta to permit open
participation in elections
scheduled for next Novem-
ber —and hinted that he
might run for president. But
U.S. officials doubted that
the Sandmistas would allow
Pastora to run. And they
predicted that with or with-
out U.S. aid, the contras
would go on fighting. Hav-
ing once lived on pilfered
chickens and cattle, the con-
tras should be able to lie low
again—and wait for their
luck to shift, both in Wash-
ington and in Nicaragua.

The Cargo-Crate Kidnapping
The large crate at London’s Stansted
Airport looked suspicious. It was
marked as diplomatic baggage, and an offi-
cial from Nigeria’s High Commission in
London had shown up to watch it loaded
onto a Nigeria Airways cargo plane bound
for Lagos. But it lacked the requisite seals
and papers. Curious British customs agents
pried it open. What they found was far from
a routine diplomatic shipment. There was a
crouching figure, holding drugs and sy-
ringes. Next to him was another man, un-
conscious, with tubes sticking out of his
The Nigeria Airways plane: Phony baggage, syringes and four mysterious suspects
body. He was quickly identified as Umaru
Dikko, the transport minister in Nigeria’s
last civilian government. Someone had kid-
napped Dikko from a street in front of his
London home —and apparently hoped to
smuggle him out to stand trial as the Nigeri-
an military junta’s most wanted man.
That was only the first twist in the bizarre
kidnapping case uncovered in London last
week. British police arrested four people in
connection with the plot, including two
men found in a second crate.
According to news reports, two
of the suspects were Nigerians
and two were Israelis. The re-
ports said the man in the crate
with Dikko was administer-
ing drugs to him and was an Is-
raeli paramedic. The arrests
touched off speculation that
Nigeria had hired Israeli mer-
cenaries to handle the abduc-
tion. But the Israeli Embassy in
London denied any involve-
Dikko: Wanted man
UPI
ment, and there was no evidence linking the
Israeli government to the plot.
The kidnapping quickly escalated into a
tense diplomatic standoff between London
and Lagos. Nigerian officials took a posi-
tion of wounded innocence. “My govern-
ment doesn’t get involved in things like
that,” Nigeria’s high commissioner in Lon-
don, Maj. Gen. Haldu Hananiya, told re-
porters. But after Dikko was discovered,
Nigerian authorities requested a British
Caledonian airliner en route to London to
return to Lagos. They detained the plane
and crew overnight, refusing to release
them until Britain allowed the Nigeria Air-
ways cargo plane to leave Stansted. The
standoff ended Saturday, when both planes
took off.
Charges: Nigeria’s military government
had long sought to try Dikko on corruption
charges before one of its secret tribunals.
Before the junta toppled President Shehu
Shagari in a coup last New Year’s Eve,
corrupt officials reportedly siphoned any-
where from $5 billion to $l6
billion out of the Nigerian
economy. Dikko, the presi-
dent’s brother-in-law, alleged-
ly got a large share —perhaps a
billion dollars. Dikko slipped
out of Nigeria when the Army
seized power. From exile in
London, he proclaimed a “ji-
had” against the junta, vowing
to “use any weapon God gives
me” to oust the officers.
Since taking power in Janu-
ary, the junta has managed to squander
much of its early popularity. The first three
politicians tried on corruption charges
come from the Christian, southern areas of
Nigeria, not the Muslim north; the appear-
ance of favoritism has underscored the
country’s chronic regional and ethnic divi-
sions. The officers have also alienated Ni-
geria’s press, which generally welcomed the
coup, by issuing a draconian decree en-
abling them to shut down any paper they
find detrimental to the government. After
an initial fall, food prices have risen again.
Whoever tried to kidnap Dikko may have
calculated that they could improve the gov-
ernment’s popularity by bringing Dikko to
justice. Instead, they may only have suc-
ceeded in hurting the junta at home and
damaging its credibility abroad.

ARGENTINA
Alfonsin Gets Tougher
With His Generals
Ever since Argentine President Raul
Alfonsin took office last December,
the country’s officer corps has grumbled
about his campaign to tighten civilian con-
trol over the military. But instead of back-
ing off, Alfonsin has only gotten tougher. In
his latest move last week, Alfonsin dis-
missed four prominent generals—including
Gen. Jorge Arguindegui, the Army’s chief
of staff.
Arguindegui—an Alfonsin appointee —
was fired shortly after he announced on
Argentine radio that dissenting Army fac-
tions had threatened to “destabilize” his
command. Alfonsin also removed Gen. Pe-
dro Mansilla, commander of the powerful
Third Army Corps in the central province
of Cordoba, a center of military protests
against the government. The other ousted
generals, Mario Leoncio Camissa and Jorge
Julian Capanegra, sat on the board of Fabri-
caciones Militares, the nation’s largest
industrial complex. They had resisted Al-
fonsin’s efforts to move the complex from
military to civilian control.
The moves came amid other signs of dis-
content within the armed forces. When a
state-run television station in Buenos Aires
broadcast “Never Again,” a documentary
on the disappearance of thousands of people
during the military’s “dirty war” against
subversion in the 19705, a bomb was thrown
at the station’s roof. Meanwhile, shooting
broke out between guards and unknown
attackers at the Navy Mechanics School, a
notorious former detention center. There
were also reports of armored vehicles mov-
ing toward the capital. The Ministry of
Defense said the tanks were only preparing
for independence-day ceremonies on July 9.
But with the military up in arms and the
country groaning under a $45 billion for-
eign debt, Alfonsin may still need more than
toughness to stay in control.

THE PHILIPPINES
Mrs.Marcos Takes the Stand
It was her 55 th birthday, but Imelda Mar-
cos was in no mood to celebrate. Last
week the wife of Philippine President Ferdi-
nand Marcos took the stand to testify before
the board investigating the murder of oppo-
sition leader Benigno Aquino. With tears in
her eyes, she claimed she had twice tried to
save Aquino’s life: once when she recom-
mended his release from prison to undergo
heart surgery in the United States; then
when she warned him to delay his return to
the Philippines. But her plea did little to
dispel widespread suspicion that the Mar-
cos government was somehow involved in
the assassination. When the First Lady con-
cluded her testimony, commission chairwo-
man Corazon Agrava tried to lighten the
mood by striking up a chorus of “Happy
Birthday.” Many onlookers in the hearing
room refused to join in.
After eight months of public hearings
and testimony from 190 witnesses, the
Agrava board seemed little closer to a de-
finitive conclusion than it was at the outset.
The government continued to contend that
Aquino’s assassin was Rolando Galman, a
small-time Filipino hoodlum who it said
was hired by communists. But despite the
widely held view that Aquino was killed by
his military escorts, possibly on orders from
high-ranking members of the Marcos gov-
ernment, few Filipinos came forward to
testify against anyone in the government or
the Army. Opposition figures predicted a
whitewash, and Aquino’s family refused to
cooperate with the panel.
Silence: In her frustration, chairperson
Agrava, 68, a former appeals court judge,
teased and bullied and even threatened to
punch several low-ranking soldiers who
were at the scene of the killing but claimed
to have seen nothing conclusive. Commis-
sion lawyer Bienvenido Tan charged bitter-
ly that while millions of Filipinos claimed to
know who killed Aquino, only seven (in-
cluding two women and Galman’s nine-
year-old son) had the courage to contradict
the government’s story. The silence may
have stemmed as much from fear as forget-
fulness. Shortly after Aquino’s death,
armed men abducted Galman’s common-
law wife, his girlfriend and her sister. Some
believed that the women might have given
crucial information on Galman’s alleged
links to the military.
The extent of Galman’s military ties re-
mained the largest unanswered question in
the investigation. Galman’s 16-year-old
stepdaughter told the commission that Air
Force Col. Arturo Custodio escorted the
alleged assassin from his home four days
before the killing. But Custodio denied the
charge, admitting only that he knew Gal-
man. Witnesses were also unable to explain
how Galman managed to penetrate the
1,200-man security cordon at Manila Air-
port. The Villamor Air Force Base, which
adjoins the airport, could have provided one
route; several sources close to the military
told Newsweek that two days before the
assassination, at least six Air Force person-
nel saw Galman eating with Custodio at the
Villamor base. But, these sources said, none
of the personnel in question would testify to
what he saw.
When Imelda Marcos took the stand,
commission members focused on state-
ments she had made to Aquino regarding
The First Lady testifies: No happy birthday
his return. She confirmed that she warned
Aquino that he risked death if he came back
to the Philippines. But she denied as “pure
fabrication” a Newsweek report that she
had told him that “there are some people
loyal to us who cannot be controlled.” That
denial was disputed, however, by opposi-
tion leader Salvador Laurel. On a visit to
Tokyo, Laurel produced a tape recording,
allegedly made two months before Aquino’s
death, on which a voice said to be Aquino’s
quotes the First Lady as having told him:
“We have many loyal followers. They
might think that if they killed you they’d be
doing us a favor.” The commission plans to
produce its report by Aug. 21, the anniver-
sary of Aquino’s death. Its findings will help
determine whether the Aquino case will
help to stir up a second year of turmoil for
Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos.

ENTERTAINMENT
The lour,
The Money,
The Magic
After months of anticipation, Michael Jackson’s
troubled and controversial tour has finally kicked off
in Kansas City and the enigmatic star is living up to
his reputation as the reluctant Pied Piper of pop.
It was .Michael Jackson’s kind of
crowd—mothers with toddlers, teen-agers
with parents, blacks and whites together,
low-key, sober and friendly. They had paid
dearly for tickets and now here they were,
filing quietly into Kansas City’s Arrow-
head Stadium last Friday night for the
debut of the most widely touted and hotly
debated tour of recent years—Michael
Jackson’s “Victory” tour, his last with his
brothers, the Jacksons. As the sun set and
the lights dimmed, excitement mounted,
When the Jacksons finally appeared, rising
on a waffle grid of blinding lights, Michael
bestowed a benediction with a jab of his
trademark sequined glove, and the crowd
of 45,000 roared its appreciation. Racing
at full throttle, the band launched into
“Wanna Be Startin’ Something?”—and
Arrowhead Stadium: Grateful for Michael's appearance
MIKE MAPLE
Michael leaped into nearly two hours of
the giddy showmanship that has made him
perhaps the most popular musician in the
world today.
After months of confusion, controversy
and sporadic outbursts of popular hysteria,
often fanned by frenzied media coverage,
the Jacksons’ tour —billed as the most
lucrative rock and roll roadshow ever
mounted —was officially under way. The
tour is currently scheduled to visit some 13
cities, with a few more sites yet to be an-
nounced. Most of the dates —perhaps near-
ly 50 in all—will be in large outdoor arenas
like Arrowhead. The tour is expected to
gross around $5O million —though esti-
mates vary wildly—perhaps edging records
set by the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Who.
“Even my mom talks about the concert,”
laughs Bob Case of Seat-
tle radio station KUBE.
“This is going to be THE
event of the next 10
years. It’s like the Super
Bowl—you don’t care
about who’s playing, you
just want to see it.”
In many cities, the
Jacksons’ concert will
climax months of fever-
ish anticipation—and, in
some cases, increasingly
vocal complaints. Ev-
eryone had assumed that
the tour would present
complicated logistical
and security problems—
particularly since most
preparations had been
marred by byzantine, be-


WALLY McNAMEE— Newsweek
Jackson live in Kansas City: Blastoff
hind-the-scenes turmoil. Before last Thurs-
day, when Michael announced new ticket-
ing plans and the donation of his profits to
charity, reports of greed and incompetence
had outraged some fans and perhaps con-
tributed to sluggish ticket sales in Dallas.
But other fans loyally demonstrated their
enthusiasm. In Kansas City, the hoopla
began in June. When newspapers contain-
ing the first official ticket order forms rolled
off the presses in the early hours of June 19,
fans were lined up to buy them. “It’s ridicu-
lous!” said disc jockey Roy Leonard, who
has been following the Jackson craze for the
Chicago radio station WGN: “People were
stealing papers off other people’s front
lawns.”
Big Brother: As every newspaper thief
soon learned, Michael’s show was no easy
mark. Anxious fans were instructed to mail
a money order (four tickets for $120), with
no guarantee of a specific date, a good
seat —or even any tickets at all. Despite the
stiff price and chancey prospects (tickets
were to be randomly distributed), custom-
ers in Kansas City jammed into post offices
to buy money orders —15,000 in one day.
Elsewhere in the country, civic leaders and
local media petitioned Michael to make
their city one of his stops. In staid Boston,
the local tabloid sponsored a coupon drive
that garnered over 30,000 signatures, and a
radio station organized a rally of 5,000 fans,
who milled about on Boston Common be-
neath an outsize billboard of Michael—a
25-year-old Wizard of Funk looking un-
comfortably like Big Brother. In Jackson’s
native Gary, Ind., some 30,000 citizens peti-
tioned Michael, at the behest of Mayor
Richard Hatcher, to come home—at least
for a ceremony. Even the president got into
the act: when Jackson visited the White
House last May, Ronald Reagan personally
urged him to perform in Washington. Not
to be outdone, presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson made a point of meeting him last
Saturday in Kansas City.
Such is the magic of America’s newest
Pied Piper of pop. The most explosive phe-
nomenon since the Beatles, he defies easy
categorization. Like James Brown, he’s the
pre-eminent black pop musician of his era, a
master of soulful singing and impassioned
stagecraft, able to dance with a furious pre-
cision that is innovative yet steeped in black
tradition. Like the early Beatles, he’s a mas-
ter of upbeat musical confections, some-
times created in collaboration with the most
popular ex-Beatle of all, Paul McCartney.
Like Pat Boone, the prototype of rock teen
idols, he’s cute, wholesome and pious. He’s
a virtuoso of the modern recording studio;
but like Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra, he
aspires to be an old-fashioned entertainer.
He’s a stunning live performer, but also a
notorious recluse with an otherworldly
mystique—imagine Howard Hughes and
E.T. rolled into one. Like Judy Garland or
Johnny Ray, his appeal is freakish —he’s


Thefi ve brothers, led by Michael, in the ‘Victory* tour’s debut at Arrowhead Stadium: Presiding over what is one of the gaudiest, most grandiose
utterly unlike you and me, with a streak of
wildfire that unpredictably lights his eyes.
In Kansas City, first stop on the tour that
now goes to Texas Stadium outside Dallas
(July 13-15), the Gator Bowl in Jackson-
ville, Fla. (July 21-23), and Madison Square
Garden in New York (Aug. 2-5), Michael
presided over one of the gaudiest, most
grandiose spectacles in the history of pop
music. The show opened with a curious
costume pageant involving large, lumber-
ing pastel-colored Muppet-like monsters, a
magically glowing sword, and a visored
knight in shining armor—King Arthur
meets Luke Skywalker. (The knight was
Michael, of course.) There were lasers,
strobe lights and smoke bombs. There was a
spidery mechanical gizmo that nearly ate
Michael. (He escaped.) There was magic,
illusion, and fireworks —flares and explo-
sives onstage during the show and in the sky
overhead to end it.
But it was the music, after all, that had
brought the crowd here —and the smartly
paced set included a little bit of everything.
There was something old: the classic pop-
corn funk of “I Want You Back,” the Jack-
son s’s first Motown hit 15 years ago. There
was something new: four songs from
“Thriller,” Michael’s blockbuster solo al-
bum. Amid all the razzle-dazzle, there was
even something blue: an earthy, extended
gospel coda to “I’ll Be There” sung by
Michael a cappella—a touching reminder
of his roots in the soul stylings of Jackie
Wilson. Michael moved effortlessly from
ballads (a luminous “Human Nature”) and
rock (a ferocious “Beat It”) to skittish funk
(the salsa-spiced “Lovely One”). On
“Working Day and Night,” the group
flashed some whirling dervish choreogra-
phy, while by the show’s finale, “Shake
Your Body,” Michael had become a free-
lance blur of spins, stops and body-popping
turns. There was no material from the new
Jacksons’ album, “Victory,”—perhaps be-
cause, disappointingly, it is such a spotty
effort. Jermaine Jackson, a solo recording
artist in his own right, did perform three of
his songs; but he was in poor voice, and often
seemed off pitch.
Wispiness: From start to close, there is
only one real star of this show; it may be
billed as a Jacksons’ tour, but it’s Michael’s
all the way. When he sings a lachrymose
ballad like “She’s Out of My Life,” he
makes sentimental tripe seem like honest
passion. And when he performs “Billie
Jean,” he seems to glide weightlessly. He
dances with the breathtaking verve of his
predecessor James Brown, the beguiling
wispiness of Diana Ross, the ungainly pa-
thos of Charlie Chaplin, the edgy joy of a
man startled to be alive. The crowd gasps
and screams, savoring not a fussy high-tech
stage set but the grace and beauty of a
brilliant entertainer.
If all goes well, the Jacksons’ tour should
only intensify the storm of coast-to-coast
interest in the most famous Jackson of all.
At Ron Smith’s Celebrity Look-Alikes in
Los Angeles, owner Smith reports that the
craze —and the limited number of con-
certs —means booming business for his 20-
odd hand-picked Michael Jackson clones.
“This reminds me of the Elvis Presley fad,”
says Smith. “Only Jackson is bigger. It’s like
Marilyn Monroe, the Beatles.” In Miami,
bookstore owner Raquel Roque papered
the front door of her Downtown Book Cen-
ter with Jackson book jackets. “The funny
thing about him,” says Roque, “is that the
younger the kids —four and five years old —
the more they like him.” All across the

DEBRA TREBITZ— LGI
country, youngsters can purchase buttons,
posters, a “Thriller” painters cap, key
chains, duffel bags, bubblegum cards, a sin-
gle white sequined glove, and even a
Michael Jackson doll.
Sit-In: Such accessories aren’t taken
lightly. When high-school officials in
Bound Brook, N.J., tried to ban the glove
last March, students staged a sit-in —and
won a hearing over the right to continue
wearing it. (They lost.) Or consider the case
of Lillie Frierson, 13, of Los Angeles. Mi-
chael Jackson doesn’t eat meat. Neither
does Lillie. Michael sleeps on a mat on the
floor. So did Lillie, until her mother ordered
her back into bed. Michael wears beaded
jackets. So does Lillie, a $350 red one that
her mother, Doris, bought her for her birth-
day. “I must be almost as crazy as she is,”
Doris sighs. “I hope that nothing bad ever
happens to him because if it does, that child
is going to need to have help.”
In the nineteen months since News-
week first profiled Michael Jackson, he
has, if nothing else, proved himself a genius
at high-tech music marketing—raising his
personal fortune to an estimated $75 mil-
lion. Since “Thriller,” his most recent solo

A Tour With Too Many Chiefs
First there was only a flash of the se-
quined glove waving above the crowd of
bodyguards and advisers as a resplendent-
ly dressed Michael Jackson was whisked
into the press conference. In his whispery
voice, with brothers Randy, Tito and Mar-
lon standing behind him, he began reading
a statement. Tickets to the Jacksons’ “Vic-
tory” tour concerts would no longer have
to be ordered in blocks of four at $3O each,
with delayed refunds if the buyer lost out in
a computerized lottery for available seats.
The new procedures would mean “no one
will pay money unless they get a ticket.”
Then he announced that it had always been
his intention to donate his own tour earn-
ings to charity. Why? someone asked after
Michael quickly exited. “ ’Cause he’s a nice
guy,” said Frank DiLeo, Michael’s man-
ager. What he failed to add was that it was
only one day before the first concert in
Kansas City and, like a candidate who
suffers a sudden drop in the polls, Michael
seemed to feel the need to mend a few

fences with his public.
Last week, as one of the
biggest—and, on the face
of it, most disorganized—
tours in rock and roll his-
tory finally got under
way, it was still mired in
controversy. For months
the story of the tour
had been punctuated with
question marks. When
would it start? Where
would it play? Would it
happen at all? When tick-
ets finally went on sale,
fans complained about the
steep price and about not
knowing whether they
would even get them at all
until the last minute. And
there were widespread re-
ports of conflict within the
tour’s inner circle. Said
one top insider last week,
“This is potentially the
biggest disaster that ever
went on the road.”
Flamboyant: The trou-
bles began even before the
tour was announced last
November in New York City by Don
King, the flamboyant boxing promoter.
King was picked to oversee the tour be-
cause, according to his brother Jermaine,
“he was the only one who wanted to get my
mother and father [Katherine and Joe
Jackson] involved.” King’s lack of experi-
ence with rock tours —and the expected
difficulties of this one—led the Jacksons to
entertain bids from no fewer than six other
promoters early this year. At first, Frank
Russo of Providence, R. 1., appeared to
have an inside track; he is said to have
dazzled the Jackson brothers initially with
a $ 100 million guarantee. But no contracts
were signed, and he was dropped.
By the time Chuck Sullivan, head of
Stadium Management Corp. of Foxboro,
Mass., finally took over as promoter, guar-
anteeing the Jacksons $3B million with
$12.5 million up front, the start of the tour
was only weeks away. A man with plenty of
experience in NFL football but little with
rock events, Sullivan has in some ways
SONIA MOSKOWITZ
Promoter King and the Jacksons announcing nationwide tour: Months of frenzy and
negotiated the tour as he might a Super
Bowl. The rigid, nationally centralized
ticketing system that Michael has now
ordered dismantled was heretofore un-
heard of in rock and roll. Sullivan also
reportedly asked for such heavy conces-
sions from potential tour stops —discount-
ed stadium rental, partial waivers of local
taxes, a cut on parking fees—that some
cities, New Orleans for example, failed to
strike a satisfactory deal. He had, however,
managed to book the majority of the tour
into outdoor NFL stadiums, though no
firm provisions have yet been been made
for rain.
Large outdoor stadiums also pose a
heightened security risk, since fans tend to
push toward the stage in surges, especially
if there is open or “festival” seating. But on
the safety-conscious Jackson tour all seats
are reserved. In Kansas City those without
tickets couldn’t even get into the stadium
parking lot, and everyone passed through
one of 38 hand-held metal detectors. Five
hundred security personnel—about dou-
ble the usual number for a rock concert at
Arrowhead Stadium —were standing by.
The unwieldy stage, which had tour ad-
visers frantically calling for technical help
as late as last week, also caused problems.
With no single person in charge all spring,
no one seemingly noticed that the mono-
lithic set, built from Michael’s own
designs, threatened to get out of hand. The
vast 90-by- 150-foot stage requires a gar-
gantuan superstructure to support the
12,000-volt electrical system (5,000 volts
are usually the norm on such a tour) for the
lighting and special effects. One hundred
speakers (64 in any indoor arenas) are split
between two 70-foot towers. Not only is
the massive setup tremendously costly, but
it gobbles up a huge number of potential
seats. In Arrowhead, for example, the
Jacksons’ stage projects to the 35-yard line
(compared with the goal line for last year’s
Simon and Garfunkel tour), thus putting
some 42 percent of the 78,000 seats out of
the sight lines.
Competing Interests: At the root of the
tour’s problems is not just the inexperience
of many top decision makers but divisions
within the Jackson family itself. Joe Jack-
son and the brothers want to make the
most of this last lucrative tour of the Jack-
sons as a group. Their camp includes King
and Katherine. Michael and, to some ex-
tent, Jermaine, have differed with their
father and brothers on aspects of the tour.
Michael, for example, wanted a $2O ticket
price and had opposed the choice of King.
Michael’s allies are Frank DiLeo, his at-
torney, John Branca, and Irving Azoff,
president of MCA Records and former
manager of the Eagles, who was brought
into the tour as a consultant. “We’re deal-
ing with several different entities here,”
says Sullivan. “There’s Michael Jackson,
who’s a star in his own right; Jermaine
Jackson, who’s a star in his own right; the


album, was released in December 1982 on
Epic records, it has sold over 35 million
copies worldwide—making it the best-sell-
ing album by far in the history of the record
industry. In lieu of fresh solo recordings,
Jackson has doled out seven singles from the
album, and lent his uniquely histrionic vo-
cal style to four best-selling duets, the most
recent one, “State of Shock,” being a “Jack-
sons” record featuring Michael and Rolling
Stone Mick Jagger. An innovator in the use
of rock music videos, Jackson has become a
mainstay on MTV, the cable rock video
network.
A 60-minute documentary on the making
of “Thriller,” his lavish $ 1.2 million “I-was-
a-teenage-werewolf’ rock video, has al-
ready become one of the most profitable
prerecorded video cassettes ever made, sell-
ing 750,000 copies worldwide in less than
seven months. By creating an aura of con-
tinuous excitement, Jackson’s videos
helped him pull off an unprecedented feat:
for well over a year, with scarcely any new
music, few public appearances and without
any of the live performances that tradition-
ally have effected a symbiotic fusion be-
tween audience and artist, the interest in
him was not only sustained but intensified.
Paradox: What this suggests, of course, is
that it isn’t just Jackson’s undeniable show-
manship that has piqued the public’s inter-
est: it’s also the striking air of mystery and
paradox surrounding him, even as his music
videos seem to be everywhere. And, perhaps
above all, there is the allure of his curious
sotto voce manner. Ever since the heydey of
Presley, people have questioned the virility
of certain rock stars. But
never before have such
questions been aired so
widely, persistently and ex-
plicitly, in the face of con-
tinued denials. Even a fam-
ily magazine like Parade
fielded the questions and
tried to dispel the rumors:
was Jackson taking hor-
mones to keep his voice girl-
ish? Had he been castrated?
Was he undergoing a sex
change operation? (Michael
first heard this last rumor in
1977, when, as he described
it in an interview at the time,
a fan rushed up to him and
exclaimed, “It isn’t true, it
isn’t true!” “What isn’t true?” asked Mi-
chael. Blurted the fan: “You’re not a girl!”)
Since Michael has refused to be inter-
viewed in the last year and a half, recent
stories have had to rely on old quotes, sec-
ond-hand reports and sometimes surreal
sightings of the recluse. One reporter from a
prominent national publication, reduced to
accepting an interview with Michael’s par-
ents and a chaperoned tour of the singer’s
mansion in Encino, Calif., chanced upon
Michael and a pal in his bedroom —a “close
encounter” reported in clammy detail, with
tacky but typical innuendo: the lights were
dim, Michael’s hand felt “like a cloud,” his
friend’s hand was “damp.”
The media dogfight over such pitiful
scraps is understandable. Featuring Jack-
son has become a sure-fire way to grab
attention. Many local newspapers, in cities
like Omaha and Dallas, hoping to boost
sales, gladly printed the Jacksons’ official
tour-ticket order forms—for nothing.
Three competing mass-market paperback
biographies of Michael have already sold
more than 1 million copies apiece. “For
rock-star biographies, they’ve been phe-
nomenally successful,” says William Gold-
stein of Publisher’s Weekly. “The only re-
cent analogy is the books tied in with movies
like ‘E.T.’ and ‘Star Wars’.”
Sobriety: In these biographies, salacious
gossip is set aside. Instead, after recounting
his rags-to-riches saga—from sooty Gary,
Indiana, to sunny Hollywood, a star at 11—
each book sympathetically sifts through
some of the mind-boggling lore that has
turned Michael into a national conversa-
tion piece. Some examples: He has had cos-
metic surgery to give his face “a slicker,
almost European visage.” He is seen fre-

With all the competing interests and with
conflicting advice from batteries of law-
yers and accountants, every decision has
been made by committee. “They’re all
chiefs and no Indians,’’recalls an embit-
tered Russo, who’s suing the Jacksons.
A lot of money is at stake. Sullivan will
take 25 percent of the tour’s estimated $5O
million gross; the brothers divide the re-
maining 75 percent evenly. After they pay
their share of expenses out of the gate, the
brothers must first give 15 percent of any
profits to Don King and their parents. In
addition the brothers have been paid $5.5
million by Pepsi-Cola, the
official tour sponsor, and
they stand to gain much
more in revenues from Jack-
son souvenirs.
Family Loyalty: Michael
does not need the money.
He earned $45 million last
year by himself, and is now,
according to one friend,
planning two starring mov-
ie roles and a sound-track
album. Why then is he do-
ing this tour? The main rea-
son, according to insiders,
is that he wants to help his
family. A couple of his
brothers are said to be over-
extended financially, and
his father reportedly put
pressure on him to make
this tour happen. And yet
while his brothers outward-
ly display no resentment
of Michael’s phenomenal
solo success —“I’m happy that it’s him
and not anyone else,” says Jermaine —all
is not harmonious in family circles. Mi-
chael and his father, according to one
source on the tour, rarely speak directly
to one another in meetings.
Despite Michael’s sense of loyalty, his
last tour with his brothers (he’s never
toured without them) may end up distanc-
ing him from his family. Publicly he has
tried to be just one of the Jacksons. But the
adoration of his fans began to sour in the
controversy the tour generated. The last
straw was seemingly the open letter to
Michael, printed in a Dallas newspaper, in
which 11-year-old Ladonnia Jones said
that she couldn’t save enough to buy four
tickets and asked, “How could you of all
people be so selfish?” The letter prompted
his sudden stand on the ticketing—even if
it meant bucking his family. If you’re Peter
Pan, you never have to grow up. But if
you’re a multimillionaire star and busi-
nessman, you have to begin sometime.

Jackson Five in concert in the early ’7os: From Motown soul to razzle-dazzle rock
GLOBE PHOTOS
in an editorial have questioned whether it is
healthy to worship someone who seems to
live in a bubble of childish fantasy. “You
said that having Thriller’s sales entered in
The Guinness Book of Records made you
feel for the first time that you’d accom-
plished something,” rock critic Dave
Marsh wrote recently in “An Open Letter
to Michael Jackson”: “Michael, that’s
frightening. Are you so cut off" from the
pleasure and inspiration you’ve lent the rest
of us in the day-to-day world? Are the num-
bers more important than the joy?”
Role Model: The fact that Jackson is the
most prominent international black idol
since Muhammad Ali has given the debate
an unusual twist. Although President Rea-
gan has extolled Jackson as a model of
temperance for the youth of America and
the NAACP honored the Jacksons at its
convention in Kansas City last week, other
black leaders are frankly hostile. Louis Far-
rakhan, the controversial Black Muslim,
has castigated Jackson as a “female-acting,
sissified” influence on black youth. At a
national conference on the black family in
May, urban sociologist Asa
Hilliard asked “why Mi-
chael Jackson’s role model
is Peter Pan; why he cuts his
eyebrows and has nose jobs.
Then we must ask, Is this a
role model we want for our
children? Michael Jackson
with his sequined glove?
Michael Jackson who won’t
grow up?”
“The black intelligentsia
are suspicious of any black
figure embraced by white
America,” retorts Nelson
George, the author of “The
Michael Jackson Story”
and perhaps the best black
writer on black popular mu-
sic in America. “What’s im-
portant about Michael,”
says George, “is his dedication. He’s innate-
ly gifted, but also totally disciplined. Be-
sides, what is Superman if not a child’s
fantasy of omnipotence? Kids have always
liked that kind of stuff". Stephen Spielberg
and George Lucas thrive on it. Michael is
just symptomatic of an adolescent phase in
American popular culture.”
That’s true enough. Still, despite his very
real talent—and his insistence on perfec-
tion —there is something depressing about
the Michael Jackson phenomenon, quite
apart from the snafus of the tour and ques-
tions about his suitability as a role model.
Just compare Jackson to his forerunners.
Elvis Presley and the Beatles in their prime
both galvanized their fans and led them to
discover in themselves new desires, new
dreams, a world of new possibilities. With
Elvis, it was a matter of feeling free. Cut
loose from the pallid aspirations of Cold
War America, a generation of suburban
kids discovered a new kind of sensuality and
shared energy. The Beatles, of course, led
another generation on a magical mystery
tour that celebrated irony, wit, experimen-

tation, an openness to adventure and new
experiences.
How different the Michael Jackson phe-
nomenon is. Never before has a rock and
roll idol seemed so completely defined by
fear and evasion. It’s there in the content of
Jackson’s best songs: “Billie Jean,” after all,
is about a man in full flight from the talons
of a predatory woman, who has falsely ac-
cused him of siring her son. It’s there in his
videos: in the script for “Billie Jean,” Mi-
chael escapes the surveillance of a sinister
detective through his ability to vanish into
thin air. It’s there, finally, in Jackson’s com-
pliant willingness to take his music and turn
it to the crassest commercial purposes: the
motifs of harrassment and false accusation
in “Billie Jean” may reveal something of
Michael’s private nightmares, but by letting
it become a sales-pitch for Pepsi-Cola, he
drained it of all personal meaning and
turned the music into an empty jingle.
Gawky: Michael’s evasiveness, however,
is not simply a matter of manipulating im-
ages to create a marketable mystique. In
public, particularly on ceremonial occa-
sions when he dons one of his gaudy nauti-
cal outfits with sequins and epaulettes, he
appears, despite the blanked-out fagade cre-
ated by his trademark sunglasses, remark-
ably awkward, gawky, overwhelmed.
When he visited the president in May, Jack-
son briefly hid in a White House bath-
room—the prospect of meeting so many
strangers apparently unnerved him. Such
behavior excites sympathy; if he could be
purchased, like a Cabbage Patch doll, fans
would rush out to adopt him. These are the
same people who are intensely curious
about his inner life: his hopes, his habits, his
sexual identity. He chooses to keep such
things to himself, and his reticence suggests
an unapproachable fragility. Like a mirage,
he seems ready to evaporate before our eyes.
No wonder the crowd in Kansas City
screams in gratitude simply to behold him,
watch him move, bask in his bodily presence:
people want proof that he’s not simply a
conjurer’s trick—all pixie
dust and phosphor traces.
Yes, Virginia, there is a Mi-
chael Jackson. He’s a won-
derful singer, a great dancer,
a mesmerizing performer.
He’s there on stage now,
gliding across his Star Wars
stage set, going through his
moves. As Michael would
say, “It’s magic.” In a few
minutes, he will be whisked
back to safety and the co-
coon he feels comfortable in,
waiting to be airlifted to the
next stop on this most pe-
culiar of rock and roll odys-
seys. Maybe your town will
be next.

WORLD BUSINESS
Economic Theory in Reverse
Blastoff: Despite the general rise, monthly payments on new automobile loans are still up only a few dollars a month
Confounding many experts, high interest rates are not curbing consumer outlays.
Frank Varro just treated his family to a
flashy new car, a grand piano and even a
new house in suburban Houston. In doing
so, he ignored a classic economic rule: when
interest rates rise, consumers stop spending.
But Varro is just one of millions of Ameri-
cans who aren’t playing by the book any
more. Consumers all across the country are
on a buying binge, spurred on by a new
important source of personal wealth: inter-
est income. Every time lending rates rise, so
does the amount of interest paid on most
consumer savings. Says a confident Varro:
“High interest rates were a concern, but I
had more money coming in—and that was
partly because of interest rates, too. ”
The rules of the game have clearly
changed. Because of bank deregulation,
most individuals now earn high returns on
money-market and other savings accounts
that offer floating rates (chart). In the last
five years savers have switched three-quar-
ters of their total deposits to such accounts.
As a result, personal interest income has
skyrocketed by $4O billion since the first
quarter of last year—money that some econ-
omists say is helping to fuel the recovery.
Americans are snapping up new cars at the
fastest rate since 1978 —and sales for major
retailers are still surging ahead. By some
estimates, consumer spending rose more
than 6 percent in the second quarter.
Instead of dampening their enthusiasm,
argues Morgan Stanley economist James
Fralick, higher interest rates have actually
made consumers more willing to spend or to
borrow because they either have more mon-
ey or simply feel wealthier. That psycho-
logical uplift may bode well for the econ-
omy in the coming months. The Conference
Board’s latest survey of consumer sentiment
remains high —and the index has a good
track record for predicting economic trends
six months ahead.
Fat Returns: Not all the experts read the
numbers so optimistically, but interest in-
come is certainly far more important than
ever before. Consumers are bringing in more
from higher rates on their savings than they
are paying out to service their debt. In the
mid-1950s personal interest income totaled
less than 5 percent of total personal income.
That figure has since grown to 14 percent. In
comparison, the share of personal income
going to pay interest on mortgages has bare-
ly changed. That point has a negative color-
ing as well, however. High interest rates
starting in the late ’7os have put the cost of
buying a home out of reach for a significant
fraction of young Americans. Only about 3
percent of the nation’s 80 million family
units are expected to buy their first home this
year. But the overall effect is to increase
purchasing power. Consumers are also get-
ting a break on the credit-card front: fierce
competition among banks has prevented
those interest rates from rising too high. The
rates now range from 17 to 21 percent, com-
pared with 18 percent a few years ago.
All told, personal interest expenditures
for the first quarter of this year were $2OO
billion, roughly half the amount individuals
earned on savings in the same period. Con-
sumers obviously have the wherewithal to
take on additional debt. Installment debt,
which doesn’t include department-store
charges, now amounts to 13 percent of per-
sonal income, compared with the usual peak
during boom times of 15 percent.
Security Blanket: High rates have also
aided the nation’s pension funds. According
to a recent study by Wyatt Co., a consulting
firm, the rise in interest rates has dramatical-
ly improved the financial positions of these
funds. Primarily because of greater returns
on their investments in certificates of deposit
and other liquid assets, the number of pen-
sion plans that are fully funded has soared
from 25 percent five years ago to 64 percent
at the close of 1983. Consequently, many

Home building in California: ARM’s help to avoid a squeeze
CAROL A. FOOTE—GAMMA-LIAISON
consumers feel less concerned about spend-
ing more now, knowing that their future is
secure. “High interest rates may worry a lot
of people,” says Wyatt research director
Sylvester Schieber, “but it’s an ill wind that
has blown some good. ”
The popularity of adjustable-rate mort-
gages is another reason that pocketbooks are
fatter. The use of ARM’s has ballooned from
less than 20 percent two years ago, to more
than two-thirds of all new home mortgages.
At an average initial interest rate of 11.8
percent, these loans are much cheaper than
fixed-rate mortages that currently cost 14.8
percent. Many ARM contracts contain
built-in increases, and the rates could move
still higher if general interest-rate levels rise.
But the trend doesn’t bother some experts.
For example, Morgan Stanley economist
Stephen Roach calculates that every per-
centage point increase in interest rates could
cause a $2 billion jump in annual ARM
payments, but this would be offset by a rise of
$8 billion in interest income. Some experts
expect that the ARM concept will soon be
adopted on other consumer loans, initially
bringing those rates down as lenders offer
bargains to attract business.
PenniesaDay: Even rising auto-loan rates
have had only a minimal impact on consum-
er buying power. Ford Motor Co. analysts
point out. that a 1-point increase on a 36-
month contract pushes up monthly pay-
ments by only $3.50. Obviously, that hasn’t
discouraged car buyers. Houston auto deal-
er David McDavid, for example, expects to
sell more than 4,500 Oldsmobiles this year.
Future sales projections are so rosy, in fact,
that the major automakers plan to produce
1.8 million cars in the third quarter, 10
percent more than they did during the same
period last year. And even then, they claim
they cannot keep pace with demand.
The flow of interest income may have yet
another strong influence on the economy: it
may encourage Americans to save more, and
that increase in savings
could fuel additional eco-
nomic growth. For the mo-
ment, the U.S. savings rate
remains quite low. “It’ll take
time,” says Charls Walker,
a Washington economist
and lobbyist. “I’m confident
that as savers experience the
benefits of rising yields on
their investments, they’ll
be tempted to save a lit-
tle more.”
Winners and Losers: Still,
many economists remain
skeptical that high interest
rates —and rising personal
interest income—are help-
ing to sustain the recovery.
Critics point out that the
high cost of credit has sent
Wall Street into a tailspin,
causing the value of stocks
and bonds to plummet by
$lOO billion. (The optimists
counter that real household net worth has
declined only 2 percent in the last year,
not enough to curb spending.) What’s more,
nonsavers, such as the poor, many blue-
collar employees and most young workers
reap few, if any, benefits from higher
rates. Unfortunately, they are the nation’s
heaviest net borrowers, explains Robert
Ortner, chief economist for the Commerce
Department. In contrast, the big winners are
senior citizens and the wealthy, who tradi-
tionally amass substantial savings. The eld-
erly, however, seldom buy houses or big-
ticket items such as appliances—and neither
group assumes much debt. “The ones on the
receiving end,” insists Ortner, “are not nec-
essarily the ones on the paying end. ’ ’
Many economists insist that consumers
are actually reacting to an old confidence
booster: low unemployment. Since the be-
ginning of the recovery, more than 6.5 mil-
lion Americans have found jobs, and last
week the government reported that the job-
less rate fell again in June, to 7 percent. The
dramatic increase in personal income
brought about by the increased number of
workers —coupled with pent-up demand for
goods forgone during the recession—are the
primary reasons for the strong buying pat-
terns, says Under Secretary of Commerce
Sidney Jones. Consumers have also begun
buying in anticipation that rates will soon go
higher. For the first time in 35 years, con-
sumers are using interest rates as a barom-
eter of how and when to spend their money.
“Inflation used to be the looking glass of the
economy,” explains Richard Curtin, direc-
tor of consumer surveys for the University of
Michigan. “Now they see interest rates as
the crucial guidepost.”
But no matter what the reason for the
spending spree, none of the experts expect it
to last indefinitely. Economists predict that
the government’s rising credit demands will
soon clash with business-sector borrowing,
nipping advances by the housing market and
curbing industrial expansion that creates
more jobs. Some expect rates to soar to 17
percent or more by the end of the year. At
such levels, even the heartiest free spenders
are likely to cry uncle.
KIM FOLTZ with RICH THOMAS in Washington,
DOUG TSURUOK Ain New York and bureau reports
THE NEW CONSUMER BALANCING ACT
Rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing for such consumer needs as housing. But
fierce competition among banks has kept rates from soaring out of sight—and savings accounts now
earn more money as rates rise. So far, the net effect has been to increase individual purchasing power.

What should you
expect from a

"To keep up with
the costs of running
a packaging business
these days, you have to
keep up with technology.
At Visy Board we have
established a national
network of Hewlett-
Packard personal and
business computers to
help us manage more
efficiently."
Kevin Bamford, General Manager,
Visy Board
Visy Board's integrated system
of HP3OOO computers throughout
Australia provides uniform
financial reporting information for
their 13 autonomous plants. Their
many HP personal computers
provide both local processing and
interfacing to the central computers
for costing orders, estimating
and quoting.
Four HP3ooo's allow Visy
Board to analyse sales, market by
market, and study segment usage.
There is a complete run down of
the history on customer accounts
and an analysis of the cost of
each job.
With Hewlett-Packard
systems, outstanding debtors
have been reduced because of
the speed at which customers
can now be invoiced. Hewlett-
Packard computers allow direct
invoicing at the time of delivery,
hence shaving down the time
factor between delivery and
payment. Computerised
machine scheduling has led to
significant reductions in wastage
of raw materials and stock-
holding of paper.
It's been easy for Visy Board
to develop this and other
programs in-house, as they are
constantly kept in touch with the
latest program developments
from Hewlett-Packard.
Increased productivity hasn't
been confined to computer
programming. On the factory
floor each shift can now provide
up to date information oh order
progress through the factory.
Computerised shop floor control
systems are now becoming an
integrated part of the manu-
facturing network. These advances
lead to increased productivity,
customer service and direct control
of the manufacturing process.
And when it came to the
America's Cup Visy Board backed
its confidence in Hewlett-Packard
by equipping its challenger with
Hewlett-Packard personal
computers from Damar
Management Systems, Geelong.
As Kevin Bamford says,
"In order to manage a business
these days, you need to keep up
with the latest technology. Visy

us a reputation internationally for reliable
performance with our products and services.
Hewlett-Packard brings to its computers
the same quality of manufacture, and
support services that customers have come
to expect from Hewlett-Packard's electronic,
medical and analytical instruments and

Hewlett-Packard have deliberately chosen
to work on the very frontier of technology,
to innovate rather than emulate. But this
doesn't mean we make our own products

Doing Business in China
To Westerners, the ‘open door’ seems mostly closed.
Bottling Coca-Cola in Peking: A capricious view of the sanctity of contracts
LIU HEUNG SHING—CONTACT
When Peking opened its doors to for-
eign businessmen five years ago, it
seemed that the long-dormant China trade
was about to burst into full flower. The
country’s vast population, gigantic oil re-
serves and hunger for imported capital and
technology made China one of the most
attractive new markets in the world.
Today, however, that picture looks far
different. China’s foreign trade has bal-
looned from almost nothing to more than
$4O billion a year. But the bonanza that
many Westerners expected has not materi-
alized, and it shows no sign of doing
so. The obstacles range from Peking’s ca-
pricious treatment of contracts to bureau-
cratic infighting and China’s longstanding
aversion to borrowing money. As a result,
executives around the world are taking a
hard second look at the pros and cons of
doing business in the People’s Republic.
Their conclusion: if the China trade is
benefiting anyone, it is the Chinese them-
selves, not the outside world.
Numbers tell part of the story. Total
trade between the United States and Chi-
na, for example, slipped from a peak of
$5.5 billion in 1981 to $4.4 billion last
year—a drop of about 20 percent. Much of
the falloff resulted from a skirmish over
textiles that was resolved last autumn, and
trade now seems to be rebounding to near-
record levels. But there is a catch: most of
the boost comes from a surge in Chinese
exports to the United States, and this year
the United States is likely to run a trade
deficit with China. As one U.S. business-
man in Peking ruefully puts it: “China’s
door may be open, but a lot more is going
out than is coming in.”
A similar one-sidedness governs China’s
relations with other nations —a trend that
now seems inevitable, for several reasons.
For one thing, the Chinese have an abiding
fear of trade deficits and debt. The country
has accumulated more than $l5 billion in
foreign-exchange reserves, the second high-
est figure in the developing world. “They’ve
got a real money-under-the-mattress men-
tality,” says one American banker in Pe-
king. China’s tendency to hoard a large
share of its earnings, rather than spend
them all on development projects, arises in
part from a desire to avoid the debt prob-
lems encountered by many Latin American
countries. But it does not bode well for any
dramatic increase in Western imports.
Peanuts: Some Western businessmen also
say that they may have grossly misinter-
preted Peking’s intentions, especially in the
important area of joint ventures. In the last
five years, hundreds of foreign companies
have gone to Peking in the hope of striking
coproduction deals with Chinese firms to
manufacture everything from Pepsi-Cola to
Volkswagen automobiles. So far, only nine
Japanese joint ventures have been estab-
lished, and the United States has not fared
substantially better. “That’s peanuts,” says
a Western diplomat in Peking. “Foreign
investment has been minimal compared to
what it could be.”
Most of the partnership talks have foun-
dered on a wide, but often unacknowledged,
dilference in expectations. While foreign
firms have been primarily interested in
gaining a foothold in China itself, Peking
has generally seen things differently. Reluc-
tant to let foreigners produce or sell any-
thing that the Chinese could make them-
selves, Peking has looked at the joint
ventures as a way of increasing exports to
other countries and adding to its cache of
hard foreign currency. The problem, how-
ever, is that many Western firms already
have operations in the region. Rather than
launch a new operation that would dupli-
cate existing facilities in Asia, such firms
have often chosen to break off their negotia-
tions with China.

scrq


shop in China frequently have difficulty
doing business. The Chinese are generally
unwilling to allow foreign firms to repatri-
ate the full amount of their earnings. And in
some cases they have tried to skirt the com-
pensation issue altogether by pressuring
their foreign partners to accept shoddy Chi-
nese-made goods in lieu of hard cash.
Peking also shows a predilection for what
one Western diplomat calls “systematic
gouging and bloating.” In most contracts,
foreign firms are obliged to pay Chinese
workers a “premium” that is considerably
higher than the prevailing local wage. In
some instances, such as the oil industry,
these salaries are comparable to Western
pay scales. Under the most typical arrange-
ment, Chinese workers get about a 10th of
their pay. The rest is retained by the state for
its own use. Foreign firms are also com-
pelled to hire two or three times as many
local workers as they need. And many of the
laborers are not skilled enough to perform
the tasks required.
Reluctant: Not even foreign workers are
immune from exploitation. Living and
working quarters —generally government-
owned —are cramped and egregiously
expensive. Business executives are also
subjected to an array of bureaucratic frus-
trations. The U.S. Embassy reports that
some companies have been allowed to buy
office furniture and equipment only after
agreeing to transfer the title to the furnish-
ings to the Chinese. In most cases, China is
reluctant to acknowledge that foreign com-
panies are anything but a temporary pres-
ence. “There’s an underlying suspicion that
the Chinese don’t want us here,” says one
American businessman. “For now, only our
dollars are wanted.”
Taken together, such practices raise
questions about China’s good faith in busi-
ness dealings with the rest of the world.
Many foreigners, in fact, consider China’s
professed desire for “reciprocity” and “mu-
tual benefit” to be little more than cant. As
an example, one Western executive points
to the treatment of foreign banks in China,
They are prohibited from “direct profit-
making activity,” he says, “while the Bank
of China, our nemesis, merrily competes
against the home office back in New York.”
Peking’s unorthodox views on the sancti-
ty of contracts has heightened these doubts,
For Western companies, a contract is a
precise agreement to be fulfilled. For the
Chinese, general policies, good will and the
government’s appraisal of its own best inter-
ests are more powerful guiding principles,
The consequences of that difference can be
serious. In 1978, Coca-Cola struck an un-
derstanding with the Chinese that it would
be the sole foreign soft-drink producer in
the country. Not long afterward, however,
Pepsi-Cola, Coke’s prime competitor,
signed an agreement with Peking to build a
plant in the Shenzhen special economic
zone. Pepsi was supposedly going to export
all its products—but almost 20 percent of
the production has found its way to China,
Business deals that run afoul of Peking’s
political mood can also come undone,
Northwest Airlines and Pan Am are in
danger of losing their contracted routes to
China because they also fly in and out of
Taiwan. And last year, embroiled in a battle
with Washington over textile quotas,
Peking failed to fulfill a contract to buy
6 million tons of American grain,
Peking has tried to allay the West’s grow-
ing concerns about China’s reliability as a
business partner. Within the last year, the
Chinese have passed new laws protecting
foreign patents and joint ventures and re-
cently initialed a tax treaty with the United
States. But while these moves have been
welcomed by Western governments, busi-
Inspecting Chinese textiles: Business deals often run afoul of Peking’s political mood
A Shanghai electronics plant: No bonanza
nessmen remain noncommittal. “The laws
are pretty good,” says William Clarke of the
National Council of U.S.-China Trade.
“But are they going to be adhered to?”
Cross-Purposes: There are ample grounds
for skepticism. The bureaucracy overseeing
foreign businesses is almost uncontrollable.
In some ministries, old-guard Maoists qui-
etly express their opposition to China’s
“open door” policy by dragging out negoti-
ations and delaying supplies of raw materi-
als. Even under the best circumstances,
government bureaucrats often work at
cross-purposes. “To carry out an invest-
ment, you need the approval of a vast array
of ministries,” says one Western diplomat.
“Any one of them can throw your plans out
of joint or make the project unprofitable.”
In some cases, contract negotiations have
gone on for as long as five years. And when a
deal is at last in sight, a new chief negotiator
has been known to appear—making it clear
that the old team did not have final author-
ity to reach an agreement.
At bottom, it is becoming increasingly
clear that Peking’s openness to the West is
extremely tentative. While the country has
made great strides in modernizing itself, it
still has a long way to go before it becomes a
reliable —or even desirable —business part-
ner. “The Chinese keep saying that they
want a commitment from us,” says an
American businessman. “But the Chinese
themselves are the greatest discouragement
to our making one.” Until Peking takes
steps to improve the mixed record of the last
five years, the rest of the world will continue
to question the wisdom of doing business
with China.

WORLD BUSINESS
A Tough Man for a Tough Job
Jack Tramiel has always whipped
through the personal-computer market
at microchip speed. Following his Janu-
ary exit from Commodore International, a
company he had helped found, he lined up a
low-cost computer assembly line in the Far
East and raised $75 million in capital. Last
week Tramiel was right back on center
stage, taking over the hemorrhaging Atari
home-computer operation from Warner
Communications. After negotiating the
Tramiel: Buying a big-name company at a bargain price
© KIM STEELE
takeover deal well into the early-morning
hours on Monday, Tramiel typically did not
wait around to sign the final papers. In-
stead, he immediately took off from New
York for Sunnyvale, Calif. By taking advan-
tage of the three-hour time difference, he
was on hand at Atari headquarters in time
to begin the week’s work.
The Atari-to-Tramiel transaction was a
startling one even for the volatile small-
computer business. The sale of the troubled
video-games company had been rumored
for months, but the most likely buyer had
seemed to be N.V. Philips, the Dutch elec-
tronics giant. Equally surprising were the
terms of the deal: Warner all but gave Atari
away, prompting one Wall Street analyst to
call it “the most embarrassing” takeover
transaction of 1984. Tramiel put up $240
million in notes, but they carried below-
market interest rates. The two parties also
traded stock warrants. Tramiel got an op-
tion to buy 1 million Warner shares at $22
each, and Warner got an option to buy 32
percent of the new Atari operation—which
represents the seller’s only real chance to
profit on the deal. Under Warner, Atari had
been unable to make a successful transition
from games to computers, something the
smart, ruthless Tramiel may be able to do.
Tramiel, who likes to observe that “busi-
ness is war,” lost no time in exercising his
unique style of management at Atari. He
immediately put three sons into top man-
agement spots. Chairman James J. Mor-
gan, hired by Warner only last September
to turn Atari around, was gone by mid-
week —possibly to contemplate settlement
of his long-term contract or another job at
Warner. Virtually all of Atari’s marketing
and research people were fired —and with-
in a month Tramiel is ex-
pected to have pared the
company’s worldwide em-
ployment from about 5,000
to a skeletal operation of no
more than 1,500. The new
owner promised to cut
more than the payroll. He
is said to have insisted on
signing all checks himself,
and insiders say he will try
to get out of Atari’s $6 mil-
lion Olympics advertising
campaign and its $lO mil-
lion promotional deal with
actor Alan Alda. (Warner,
in fact, has set up a reserve
fund to cover contract
buyouts and any lawsuits.)
“The company is being run
almost as a start-up,” says
an Atari spokesman.
In effect, Tramiel has
bought himself a manufac-
turing and distribution infrastructure, a
famous brand name —and time. It might
have taken him two years to start up a new
company from scratch. A master of low-
cost manufacturing, Tramiel is now ex-
pected to shift at least some production of
the Atari 800 XL home computer to his
new plant in Hong Kong. Lower produc-
tion costs and sale prices might make the
800 XL competitive enough in the low end
of the market to help build up Atari’s cash
flow. Most experts then expect Tramiel to
raise his sights and produce a computer
selling for about $l,OOO that will be com-
petitive against Apple’s Macintosh and the
IBM PCjr. “People have figured out that
you need more computer to do something
interesting,” says Egil Juliussen of Future
Computing, a consulting firm, “and the
market is moving that way.” Some suggest
the new entry might be ready for this
Christmas season.
Atari has clearly no way to go but up. The
video-games fad has fallen as spectacularly
as it rose: in the last 18 months Atari has lost
nearly $ 1 billion, more than wiping out the
profits from its salad days. In recent weeks
Atari’s Silicon Valley headquarters has
seemed like Death Valley. Morgan trimmed
the payroll, creating tearful scenes in the
corridors; but insiders say real cost control
eluded him. The company’s budgeting sys-
tem made it easy to hide overruns, says one,
and “rarely could a product manager quote
you his unit cost or development cost.”
Atari announced new products at a frenzied
pace, hoping that, in the words of one offi-
cial, “something would be a big hit and save
us.” The introduction of the 7800 video-
game machine may have been the biggest
mistake of all. The market for “dedicated”
machines—which only play games—had al-
ready been destroyed by low-cost computers
that not only play sophisticated games but
do much more. Even Morgan’s attempts to
keep up employee spirits by announcing a
dress-as-you-like day and a Friday beer par-
ty backfired among employees who thought
he was making light of a dire situation.
No Relief: But Warner Communications
was dead wrong if it figured its problems
would end with the sale of Atari. The
company’s stock plunged more than $4 to
close below $l9 a share last week, and the
entertainment giant may not win back a
following on Wall Street until it finishes a
restructuring plan that includes the divest-
iture of other operations. One prime candi-
date to follow Atari to the disposal bin is
the Franklin Mint operation. And despite
his reputation as Mr. Fixit, Tramiel’s prob-
lems may be just beginning. The abrasive
new man at Atari may have trouble court-
ing independent dealers —they all remem-
ber how Commodore abruptly shifted
away from their outlets to mass merchan-
disers. What’s more, the $75 million that
Tramiel will invest in the new Atari is
small change compared with what’s in the
till at IBM and Apple. “I suspect he bit off
more than he can chew,” says Fred An-
schel, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. “But he has worked miracles before.”
It remains to be seen if Atari can fly again
or if it is destined to be remembered as one
of the best boom-to-bust stories of all time.

‘Nuclear Arms Are a Political Weapon '
INTERVIEW: EUGENE V. ROSTOW
Eugene V. Rostow, 70, was the Reagan
administration's director of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency until
January 1983, when he was fired after re-
peated clashes with the White House over
the conduct of strategic-weapons talks with
the Soviets in Geneva. A former under secre-
tary of state for President Lyndon Johnson
and a hard-line foreign-policy adviser in sev-
eral other Democratic administrations, he
remains bluntly skeptical about disarma-
ment. Last month in New Haven, where he
recently retired as the Sterling Professor of
Law at Yale University, Rostow talked with
Newsweek’s Peter McKillop. Excerpts:
McKILLOP: Both Moscow and Wash-
ington are considering talks on limit-
ing so-called “Star Wars” antimissile
systems. Is that encouraging?
ROSTOW: I’m not very keen about it.
Here you have a whole branch of science
that has the potential of reducing the men-
ace of the ground-based ballistic missiles,
the most threatening of all nuclear weap-
ons. These new weapons could provide a
defense, a nonnuclear defense. Why on
earth should we be opposed to it?
Q. But isn’t there reason for concern
over the militarization of outer space?
A. People react, “Oh my god, keep the
cold war out of space. ” But the cold war is in
space. Space is now part of the earth. Space
begins where you can’t reach it. In 1960,
when the U-2 was shot down over Russia at
64,000 feet, suddenly 64,000 feet was no
longer outer space.
Q. You opposed SALTII and are gen-
erally wary of arms-control agree-
ments with the Soviets. Why?
A. We, the United States, attach an enor-
mous and entirely misplaced importance on
nuclear-arms negotiations as a symbol of
peace. They are not a symbol of peace. If we
make a bad agreement, it would be extreme-
ly dangerous for us and very damaging. In
the 1970 s the United States had lots of
nuclear-arms agreements with the Soviet
Union and it was the worst decade of the
cold war. A dreadful period. A good nucle-
ar-arms agreement must be compatible
with “true detente.”
Q. How would you define that?
A. Having the Soviets respect the rules of
the United Nations Charter on aggression,
that would be real detente. The rest is a pure
fake, self-deception. Detente means a recip-
rocal respect for the rules against aggression
and confining nations to peaceful change.
Well, the Soviet Union has never accepted
that. When you talk to a Soviet expert about
Rostow: ‘No vision in U.S. foreign policy ’
JOHN FICARA— NEWSWEEK
it, he says you are asking the Soviet Union to
give up a policy rooted in its nature as a
society and a state. We are afraid to look at
the real issue—which is aggression, Soviet
expansion fueled by aggression.
Q. So you are saying that we should
not have substantive arms-control
agreements until the Soviets curb their
aggressive nature?
A. Yes, that’s right.
Q. Do you think there is any need for
arms control?
A. Not very much. It might be nice to
confine expenditures and confine weapons
to retaliatory potentiality. Lots of people
don’t realize that the purpose of nuclear
weapons is not [for them] to be used, but to
allow for the use of conventional weapons.
The model is the Cuban missile crisis. Ken-
nedy would have gone in with 250,000
troops, not nuclear weapons. Because we
had nuclear superiority at that time, the
Soviets could do nothing to prevent us from
doing so and they backed down. Nuclear
arms are a political weapon.
Q. Has American military prepared-
ness improved given the massive in-
creases in defense expenditures over
the past four years?
A. One point that very few people realize is
that we have fallen farther behind the Soviet
Union during the Reagan administration.
The Soviet rate of increase in their weapons
has been much more rapid than our own.
The rate at which the gap is increasing has
been reduced somewhat. However, the gap
itself is still bigger than it was in 1980.
Q. Is there much hope in limiting
arms development on both sides?
A. As a French official once said, “What
the world needs most is a trade union of
finance ministers to suppress the scien-
tists.” There is no way to control science.
Some new development is bound to create a
new military potential. The only way out of
this dilemma, and I’m not hopeless about it
at all, is for the Soviets to realize they have
expanded about as far as they can go.
Q. Has there been a change in the
Kremlin since the death of Andropov?
A. The relationship between the United
States and the Soviet Union has not changed
at all. It has been exactly the same since
1945. Of course, it has a different atmos-
phere or background music from time to
time. That’s all superfluous. What they are
doing now is perfectly clear-cut. They are
putting on a tremendously good show of
rage and wrath to try to get a better deal
from the United States in the nuclear-arms
talks. First they tried to mobilize opinion in
Europe to prevent the deployment of mis-
siles and now they are trying to exploit the
American presidential election.
Q. Are you satisfied with Reagan’s
first term?
A. As Clark Clifford has said, my candi-
date in 1984 is Harry Truman. Ithink things
have been accomplished, such as carrying
out the two-track decision on Euromissiles
that NATO made in 1979. But the greatest
shortcoming of the administration is its fail-
ure to articulate a foreign policy as a whole.
There is no vision in our foreign policy.
There is no answer to the question of what
our weapons are for, what we are supposed
to be defending and what our national inter-
ests are. The American system of govern-
ment depends entirely on the president . And
what has happened is that the president is
still pondering what our national interest is.
And it seems the president would prefer to
put this decision off until after the election.
He has also been hurt because some of his
advisers are very allergic to action. They
mistake rhetoric for action.
Q .Do you think Reagan himself has a
strongly defined world view?
A. Oh, yes. The ground is littered with the
corpses of people who underestimated Ron-
ald Reagan. His world view is that of Frank-
lin Roosevelt. He often says the great failure
of the ’3os was the fact that the leaders of the
West did not prevent World War II as they
could have.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Computer Screens: Something for Everyone
For better or worse, many people judge a computer by the size,
color and clarity of its display. Some users need oversize
screens for graphics or word processing, while others want small
but readable displays in compact computers no larger than a
notebook. Certain tasks require screens that can provide high
resolution and full color. And so, in the current deluge of
computers and peripheral devices, manufacturers are producing
monitors that meet the varied demands of computer users.
Some of the most intriguing innovations in display technology
are products of the boom in portable computers, which has
placed a premium on size and low-power usage. Most portable-
computer manufacturers are trying to enlarge and improve their
liquid-crystal displays (LCD’s) to show up to 25 lines at a time,
with enough contrast to make them easy to read. Several firms
also are experimenting with electroluminescent (EL) screens,
which provide a sharper image than the LCD’s, although at a
higher cost and a greater power requirement. And mindful of the
specialized needs of some users, manufacturers haven’t forgot-
ten the capabilities of the cathode-ray tube (CRT), which has
been around as long as television. As always, one drawback of
any of today’s state-of-the-art products is that the speed of
innovation could quickly render them obsolete.
Displays for Portables
The lap-size, battery-powered porta-
ble computer has come a long way since
Radio Shack introduced its Model 100
last year. Users complained about the
tiny LCD’s that typically showed just
eight lines of 40 characters. Now, porta-
bles with 16-line by 80-character LCD
screens are taking the lead. Such models
are being produced by computer giant
Hewlett-Packard and several newer,
smaller companies such as Gavilan
Computer Corp., Morrow Designs, Inc.,
and Visual Computer, Inc.
HP’s new model 110 is one of the most
powerful and versatile of the portables
that feature 16-line LCD’s. The 10-inch
diagonal screen rests in the machine’s
lift-up cover, which holds firm at any
viewing angle. This is particularly im-
portant with LCD’s, which create im-
ages by reflecting—rather than emit-
ting —available light. HP has also
designed its screen to display printlike
characters with thick and thin lines rath-
er than block letters. The nine-pound HP
portable, with word-processing, spread-
sheet and communications software
built in, sells for $2,995.
The development of LCD technology
can be seen in its most advanced stage in a
new computer from a small, Toronto-
based company called Semi-Tech Mi-
croelectronics. The STM Portable PC
boasts the first 25-line LCD screen to hit
the market. The leap to a 2 5-line screen is
especially important for makers of porta-
bles because it puts their products on a
par with the CRT’s used in desktop com-
puters. That removes the need to modify
software for the portables, allowing users
to insert the same discs that they use with
their desktop units. The 18-pound STM
offers a lot in a small package, including a
built-in thermal printer, modem and two
disc drives, for $3,449.

Hewlett-Packard’s portable: More to see
An Alternative to the LCD
Sharp Electronics Corp. is one of only
a few companies offering electrolu-
minescent displays to computer manu-
facturers, and the only one with screens
in existing products, including the Com-
pass portable from Grid Systems Corp.
of Mountain View, Calif. EL screens
create images by electrically activating
phosphorescent chemicals sandwiched
between glass plates so that they glow in
the desired pattern. The display quality
is comparable to many CRT’s. The Grid
display shows a full 25 lines of type. It is
narrow, however, and although it will
display 80 characters, readability is im-
proved by switching to a 53- or 65-char-
acter line.
To make its EL screens more versatile,
Sharp has just announced two larger ver-
sions that will comfortably display lines
of 80 characters. The larger version is
fully compatible with graphics software
designed for the IBM PC, which is ap-
proaching the status of the industry
standard. High cost and heavy power
requirements still limit the use of EL,
however. A typical EL screen requires up
to 100 times the power needed to run
ultraefficient LCD’s. And while time
and competition have helped lower the
cost of a basic CRT to about $125 and a
16-line LCD to less than $2OO, the small-
est EL display still costs about $7OO.
CRT’s for Special Uses
Not everyone is thinking small. A
Minnesota company has developed an
oversize, 66-line CRT screen. For word
processing, the immodestly named Ge-
nius monitor from Micro Display Sys-
tems, Inc., essentially emulates an B Vi-
by-11-inch sheet of paper. And splitting
the screen produces two conventionally
sized displays, which is especially useful
when working with integrated software
packages such as Lotus 1-2-3, in which
the user frequently has to flip back and
forth between word-processing and
graphics functions. With the Genius
monitor, these functions each can be
assigned to different halves of the screen
so they are always visible.
The high-resolution Genius monitor
is designed for the IBM PC or PC-com-
patible machines. The basic monitor
costs $1,150; with an added graphics
feature, it sells for $ 1,495. Micro Display
Systems expects to begin shipping the
monitor by the end of the summer.
For the ultimate in computer dis-
plays, Gould Electronics and Sony
Corp. have teamed up to develop a full-
color CRT monitor that they say comes
close to providing a photo-quality im-
age, with 4,096 possible colors. The
Gould monitor was designed to fit the
precise needs of air-traffic control-
lers, but it also could be used to improve
computer processing of satellite photo-
graphs and increase the resolution of
CAT-scan displays. Gould hopes to be-
gin production on the monitor later
this year.

The tiny portable computer you see below can
do everything the average desktop can do. And more.
Meet the EPSON® PX-8.
We believe this is the first real computer you
could call a “portable”.
As you can see, it's smaller than a transportable
and considerably lighter - weighing 2.3 kg. Yet at the same
time, it has a massive 64K RAM (expandable to 184 K), a
full 80-character Liquid Crystal Display and an excellent
full-sized keyboard.
Normally you'd expect to find those specifica-
tions on a desktop computer.
But there's more. The EPSON PX-8 has
inbuilt business software for word processing, graphics,
speadsheet, communications and many more custom
programmes on simple plug-in ROM units. It also uses
an extended version of Microsoft Basic and a CP/M*
operating system - which means you have access to one
of the world's largest software bases.
As well, the EPSON PX-8 can be used as a low
cost, space saving, intelligent terminal that can be plugged
directly into a mainframe or any high performance micro-
computer like the EPSON QX-10.
And then it has features which you will never
find on a desktop. Rechargeable NiCad batteries (with
built-in back-up batteries to preserve data with a trickle
of current until you resume operation). An inbuilt micro-
cassette recorder for data storage while you're on the
move. In fact, everything you would require for complete
portability. The EPSON PX-8 and screen folds into a
book-sized package that easily fits inside your briefcase.
PERIPHERALS, The EPSON PX-8 is more
than just the first portable that performs like a desktop.
A complete range of portable peripherals has
been designed to go with it.
There is a 3.5" battery-operated floppy disk
unit with 360 K formatted capacity. (There is also a
standard 5.25" mains-driven version.)
There is a battery-operated Acoustic Coupler
which allows you to use any phone - even the one in
your car - as a direct communication line to your office
or national data base.
There are 60K and 120 K battery-operated
RAM packs which can be permanently added to the
PX-8, greatly enhancing its memory capacity, without
sacrificing its portability.
There is also the EPSON P4O compact
thermal printer which operates on NiCad batteries, as
well as a complete range of dot matrix printers.
Personal computing has just taken a great
leap forward. Although the EPSON PX-8 was designed
from the ground up as a portable computer, it's going to
make a lot of desktops look like dinosaurs.
And at only sl,3oo** you could very easily
make it your secret of success.

Ever since that time, the shattering

It was Atlas Copco who developed the
noise suppressing compressor system.
Over twenty years of research and
experimentation with noise insulation
materials, muffler systems, anti-vibration
techniques and modern dust extraction
application has now produced Atlas

Muldoon needs a miracle
to wipe out Labor’s lead
Opposition leader Lange: mythology at work
Prime Minister Muldoon: back to the wall
With the polls forecasting a Labor win in New Zealand on July 14, Sir Robert
Muldoon faces his biggest challenge. lan Templeton looks at the potential new
leaders and how such a result would affect ANZUS.
WITH ITS best chance for 12 years to
win the Treasury benches, the New Zea-
land Labor Party had only one fear as
polling day approached: to keep leader
David Lange from a fatal stumble.
Lange, packaged artfully and at
times exerting a charismatic appeal on
the platform, looked a winner from his
campaign opening. Yet his campaign
managers knew that a leader with only
six years’ experience in politics could
trip as the pressure mounted. Their ob-
ject was to fend off the cameras at awk-
ward moments, to keep the press at a
distance and so let the magic of the
Lange mythology do its work.
Although he had recaptured some of
his old form, Prime Minister Sir Robert
Muldoon badly needed some major
gaffes by Labor to fuel his campaign. As
poll after poll showed Labor in the lead,
Muldoon did succeed in stiffening his
party and it was fighting hard in the last
few days.
By then, however, it was evident that
Labor had stolen much of the support
for the Social Credit Party while the
New Zealand Party had nibbled away at
Nationals’ right-wing support as well as
attracting some voters on the left with
its education and peace policies.
Muldoon was predicting a close result
but such an astute politican knew it
would take a miracle to close the gap.
If the swing to Labor proves as mas-
sive as one nationwide opinion poll in-
dicated, the result on July 14 could be as
great a landslide as the 1972 Labor vic-
tory. Some strategists were
confident of winning 15
seats to provide a comfort-
able majority in the 95-seat
legislature.
Although Lange is short
on experience, he has
shown himself to be a fast
learner. If the prime minis-
terial mantle does fall on
him, he soon will establish
his own style in the job
even if, in the first months,
he relies on that inner
circle which has guided
him toward the top.
Roger Douglas
JOHN SELKIRK
Some of those advisers will emerge
more prominently if Labor wins.
They include the party’s third-
ranking figure, Mike Moore, scheduled
to become minister of Overseas Trade
and Marketing, and the man who prob-
ably would become minister of Finance
Roger Douglas.
Moore entered parliament at 23 in
the 1972 landslide, lost his Auckland
seat in the Labor defeat of 1975 and re-
turned three years later in a
safe Christchurch seat. He
tackles politics with the
raw energy of an All Black
lock forward.
Douglas is more cer-
ebral. His father and
grandfather were Labor
MPs and he was the
youngest minister in the
Kirk government. Often at
odds with former Labor
leader Bill Rowling,
Douglas concentrated for a
time on expanding the
family health-food busi


ness before selling it to a German
multinational. He rediscovered his en-
thusiasm for politics as Lange’s leader-
ship potential flowered.
Douglas blends a sense of social jus-
tice with the clear view that it cannot be
achieved unless New Zealand has a
prosperous economy. He argues that for
the past 30 years New Zealand has
taken the soft options. Now the only
way out of the low-growth poverty trap
is to adopt bold, innovative policies
through the politics of reconciliation
and consensus driving the big lobby
groups into accepting that some pain
must be absorbed if the ultimate goals
of renewed prosperity and social justice
are to be achieved.
The Douglas strategy has been to
present the voters with only the
broadest outline of the party’s economic
principles, to stay clear of specifics and
to give the potential government the
freedom which previous Labor adminis-
trations have lacked to manoeuvre
through the immediate economic crisis.
Difficult as the economic problems
are, Lange also would be confronted
with serious issues in foreign policy
from day one. Some of his own candi-
dates have committed themselves to the
declaration of New Zealand as a nu-
clear-free zone within a month. The
party’s policy is to seek such a zone in
the South Pacific.
How that will appeal to the Hawke
government in Australia, which has re-
affirmed a commitment to retention of
American bases and the passage of nu-
clear warships, remains to be seen. An
ANZUS council meeting is scheduled to
be held in Wellington two days after the
Boeing’s 767 assembly line: trade factors a vital influence
election. It is already causing diplomats
some embarrassment as the likelihood
of a Labor victory becomes more
apparent.
Like the Labor Party in Australia be-
fore it, the New Zealand Labor Party is
pledged to seek a renegotiation of the
ANZUS treaty. The leftwingers in the
party go much further: they want New
Zealand out of the treaty.
American Secretary of State George
Shultz probably would greet a New
Zealand Labor request for re-negotia-
tion with the same kind of distaste he
showed for Bill Hayden’s initiative last
year. But the arrangements for the
ANZUS council are going ahead, even
though there will be red faces all round
if Labor wins on Saturday.
Should Muldoon triumph once
more, though, it will be business as
usual. □

Jail sentences
for children
enrage judge
By STUART INDER
PAPUA NEW GUINEA is proud that
its constitution defends civil liberties
and the rule of law but the country’s
ombudsman last week launched an in-
vestigation into a breakdown on both
counts.
He called for the country’s prisons to
report to him the exact number of chil-
dren who are serving jail sentences.
His call follows public condemna-
tion by PNG’s Chief Justice, Sir Buri
Kidu, of the number of children appar-
ently in PNG’s jails illegally. Kidu the
previous week had ordered released
from jail Marsol Timothy who had
served nearly four months of a sentence
for having stolen 1038 kina and the re-
lease of a girl for having stolen a
ballpoint pen. The girl is 10, Timothy 9.
“I was fuming with rage when I
found out these children were in jail,”
the Chief Justice said.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t the first time
that Sir Buri had cause to be enraged.
He revealed that in 1982 he had dis-
covered 42 other cases of juveniles in
jail when he was hearing cases at Mt
Hagen, in the highlands. Most had been
remanded for months without trial.
And last month he learned that 12
juveniles were in jail at Bomana, out-
side Port Moresby. All of them, he said,
were under 16; most were serving sen-
tences for minor offences and were first
offenders. A 15-year-old was serving six
months for being unlawfully on prem-
ises, a boy of 13 was serving five months
for carnal knowledge (although legally
too young for such a conviction), and a
14-year-old was serving one month for
stealing 20 kina.
The Chief Justice ordered the jail au-
thorities to appear before him with the
details. When they did, they reported
not on 12 juveniles but on 20 with more
waiting in the wings.
Kidu said the trouble was that chil-
dren under 14 were supposed to be dealt
with by children’s courts but they were
being dealt with illegally by district
courts or village courts and this had
to stop. In one case, a village court mag-
istrate had sent his 12-year-old son to
jail after a family fight.
Kidu found out about Timothy only
a few weeks ago.
The district court at Wabag, in the
highlands, had jailed him for five
months in March but the boy had first
appeared in court in February and two
other times before sentence. He had
been in custody during that time. The
money had been recovered. □


tium has put in a lower bid favored by
some government officials.
In announcing cabinet approval,
Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon
said that the government also had given
Air New Zealand the go-ahead to buy
another Boeing 747. That will take the
outlay on new aircraft up to $3BO mil-
lion and reflects the airline’s confidence
that it can become again the dominant
carrier in the South Pacific.
After the Erebus disaster when a DC-
-10 crashed into the Antarctic mountain
with the loss of 257 lives, Air New Zea-
land suffered a crisis of confidence. It
began to lose money heavily and at one
point those losses were running at more
than $5O million a year.
However, it embarked on a major re-
organisation following a decision to sell
its DC-10 fleet and re-equip with 747 s at
a cost of more than $4OO million. Hun-
dreds of staff were declared redundant
and the airline, which had limited its
services to within the Pacific basin,
opened up one to London. That has de-
veloped into one of the most profitable
routes in the network. The airline
achieved a surplus of about $5O million
on operations in its latest year.
However, one of the penalties in re-
equipping with long-range 747 s was that
Air New Zealand was left without a
plane to service Wellington in its trans-
Tasman services. The capital has had to
be yielded to Qantas, operating Boeing
SPs into the relatively short and difficult
airstrip on the Rongotai isthmus.
With the prospect of re-equipping
Air New Zealand will re-enter the Wel-
lington market which once was said to
generate 40 percent of the traffic across
the Tasman.
Trade factors could have a vital in-
fluence on the choice between the
Airbus and the 767. When Muldoon
went to France this year he visited the
Airbus factory and left President
Francois Mitterrand in no doubt that
New Zealand could be persuaded to
buy the aircraft if France dealt kindly
with problems in butter and lamb access
to the European Economic Community.
Besides approving re-equipment
plans, cabinet also has decided to buy
10 former Royal Australian Navy
Skyhawk fighters for the NZ airforce.
Minister of Defence, David Thomson
said that SNZ6B.S million would be
spent on the aircraft, associated spares
and support equipment, conversion to
RNZAF configuration and structural
work on both the Australian and 12
existing RNZAF Skyhawks to extend
their safe operating life.
The Skyhawk navigation and
weapons delivery systems are likely to
be upgraded and the air force also
wants to improve the effectiveness of the
aircraft through acquisition of an air-to-
air refuelling capability. □
Yoi\ havent really retire,

if you think that retirement means you can stop working,
you re in for a tig surprise. Make no mistake, retirement is a
full-time jot; a whole new career. Apart from the many things
you promised yourself you cl do when you had the time, you re
suddenly responsible, for what for most people, is the biggest
single sum of money they Ve ever had.
From looking after or making money for someone else all
your life, you re suddenly in business for yourself.
That s where Potter Partners come in. We can advise you
on how to make the most of your money. What is a healthy

Is your company
getting too big
for its boots?
There comes a time when the
growth of any successful
company becomes arrested by the
sheer lack of physical space for
further expansion. It also happens
that plans to implement more
efficient up-to-date production
techniques are often frustrated by an
outmoded building design.
If your company’s boots are
beginning to pinch you in this way
it’s time for you to take careful stock
of your requirements and to define
the way in which your organisation
will grow in the next decade or so.
Re-location the
painless answer
to future development.
Hooker Commercial Industrial
Developments are well equipped
to help you with these tasks. They
are responsible for an amazingly
advantageous pre-leasing scheme
that enables a company to
relocate into a brand-new building,
tailor-made for its needs, and
in a location of its choice.
How to obtain a new
building without buying it.
Like Johnson <Sc Johnson, Seiko, F.
H. Faulding, Alcoa, Remington, and
many other Hooker clients, you can
pre-lease your new building without
tying up any working capital. At the
same time your company can obtain
a welcome input of new capital when
you switch from an owner/occupier
situation to leasing your premises.
Are your present rentals
far too high?
Relocation has big advantages for
those companies who at present pay
excessive rents in areas where they
have no real need to operate. They
would be better off paying lower
leasing rates for a building situated in
an area where the company could
function more efficiently. For
example —where similar or
reciprocal industries already operate,
or where a pool of prospective
employees might be found.
Put your total operation
under one roof.
If the component parts of your
company are presently scattered all
over town, it’s probably wasteful in
money, efficiency, time and ease of
communication. Fitting the pieces
together into one harmonious whole
would have obvious benefits and
give you a new integrated image.
Your own building
designed for your efficiency.
Hooker will work with you to design
premises incorporating your specific
needs. We have experts in industrial
and commercial design who will not
only plan for your immediate
requirements, but for your future
expansion as well.
Our service is efficiency
plus, generally by direct tender
or construction management.
This is a cost saving method,
the benefits of which we pass
on to you. There is a 'turn key’
finance package also available
where you pay on delivery.
Hooker experts define
your problems and
mastermind your move*
We offer you the services of
relocation experts who will investigate
your operational techniques. They
have years of commercial and
industrial reahestate knowledge
behind them once your essential
requirements have been defined
they will recommend a choice of
locations and sites suited to you.
We can relocate you
anywhere in Australia.
Hooker have offices in every
Australian capital city. Companies
wishing to relocate or extend
interstate can call on our special
knowledge of local conditions.
Save worry and money.
With pre-leasing, your rental struc-
ture is known prior to construction.
So you can plan budgets, obtain
corporate approval for expenditure,
and know your tenancy is secure.

COVER STORY/BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The path our improving
economy is taking
A survey of leading Australian economists shows that confidence is rising. In this
report, David Armstrong, after having polled the pulse-takers, tells which sectors
of the economy should do well this financial year.
WITH THE ECONOMY picking up
healthily during 1984-85 a number of
industries are beginning, or poised, to
surge ahead.
Among them are the motor vehicle
industry, retail sales and service indus-
tries including entertainment, trans-
port, hotels, recreation and restaurants.
All depend on fickle consumer confi-
dence to free money being held as
savings. Confidence has been fluctua-
ting but should improve with the econ-
omy and pick up more rapidly after the
next federal election.
Others are road building; computer
programming and high-technology
areas generally; banking, finance and
business advisory services. Housing will
continue to grow during the year while
public sector spending, particularly by
state governments and their instrumen-
talities, will remain strong.
Farming overall will contract but,
within a flatter rural sector, wool and
meat could move forward. Even min-
erals, particularly iron ore and, later on,
coal should improve as the Japanese
economy returns to a more familiar
growth pattern.
These are the growth areas named by
a group of leading business and aca-
Professor Peter Dixon: profits to rise
demic economists whom The Bulletin
asked to outline the prospects for the
new financial year.
The economists surveyed are: Dr
Don Stammer, partner and chief econ-
omist with stockbrokers Bain & Com-
pany; Judy Sloan, deputy director of the
National Institute of Labor Studies at
Adelaide’s Flinders University; David
Michael, of the National Farmers Feder-
ation; John Macleod, of CRA Ltd; Pro-
fessor Peter Dixon, director of Mel-
bourne University’s Institute of Applied
Economic and Social Research; and Dr
Neville Norman, senior lecturer in
economics at Melbourne University and
adviser to the Committee for the Econ-
omic Development of Australia.
The Bulletin also asked federal
Treasurer Paul Keating for his assess-
ment of what 1984-85 holds in store.
Keating is not an economist: he is a for-
mer industrial advocate for the New
South Wales branch of the Municipal
Employees Union. But on the evidence
of a previous Bulletin survey, published
on February 14, economists hold him in
high regard. (See separate story.)
The economists’ levels of optimism
varied, with stockbroker Stammer being
the most bullish and Michael and


CRA’s John Macleod: labor costs a critical factor
Macleod (both of whom work in export-
oriented industries facing poor inter-
national demand and/or prices) being
the most downbeat.
All, however, saw overall economic
growth continuing through 1984-85
although not at the high levels of 1983-
84, which saw gross domestic product
rise by 7.6 percent in the nine months to
the end of March.
The general view was that inflation
should remain under control and some
thought it might fall a little from the
present underlying rate. The consumer
price index rose by 5.9 percent in the
nine months to March but the underly-
ing rate was about 7.75 percent because
of the subtraction of health insurance
costs from the index following the intro-
duction of Medicare on February 1.
Most also saw continued improve-
ment in company profits, assuming the
prices and incomes accord holds. Most
thought it would. Company profits have
jumped dramatically and by the end of
March had reached about 17 percent of
national income, up from less than 13
percent a year previously. This is the
business sector’s highest share since
1973. Macleod made the point that after
more than a decade of a shrunken profit
share business needed the improvement
to be sustained if it were to prosper.
In spite of the growth and the im-
provement in profits, none saw any dra-
matic change in unemployment which
in May had fallen to 8.9 percent, from
the peak of 10.4 percent last September.
Most thought unemployment might
come down slowly.
Following are the economists’ gener-
al forecasts and the areas they pick as
likely to show either strong or poor
growth. Their more detailed predictions
are summarised in Table 1.
Don Stammer: Economics may be the
gloomy science but Stammer has been
an optimist for some time and many of
his forecasts have proved correct. “In
the next 12 months the economy in Aus-
tralia and the world is going to improve
more rapidly,” he said.
The great dichotomy, as he called it,
was that financial markets would be
nervous because of fears about third
world debt levels, the US budget deficit
and world inflation.
He named retail sales, road building,
motor vehicle sales and capital spend-
ing in parts of the manufacturing, ser-
vice and finance sectors as growth areas
during 1984-85, with housing showing
some further improvement.
Retail sales have fluctuated greatly.
They rose strongly in the December
quarter to $12.3 billion, an increase of
almost $1 billion on the three months to
the end of December 1982. Since then
sales have been flat, largely because of
very warm autumn weather which de-
pressed sales of winter clothing and
heaters.
Stammer said they would show a
useful recovery in the spring and after
the election. “Australians put off buying
before an election, even when the result
is apparent,” he said. “It’s one of the
reasons retailers get so nervous about
December elections.” Sales would pick
up as disposable incomes and consumer
confidence rose. Consumer confidence,
as measured by the Institute of Applied
Economic and Social Research and Roy
Morgan Research, was high in March
but fell in April. The institute said, how-
ever, the general outlook was strongly
positive.
Road building will be spurred on by
the $2 billion Australian Bi-Centennial
Road Development Fund, set up by for-
mer prime minister Malcolm Fraser in
the 1982 budget. Contracts are coming


Bain & Company’s Don Stammer: “Confidence will slowly come back”
through and signs boasting of Can-
berra’s generosity are appearing beside
roadworks. “It’s taken the system some
time to start getting the money
through,” Stammer said. “Activity is
picking up.”
A recovery in motor vehicles sales al-
ready is apparent. In the year to May,
new vehicle sales rose by 13.6 percent
while the commercial vehicle sector
leapt forward by 22 percent. Industry
forecasts put total sales for 1984 at more
than 600,000 vehicles, after the disas-
trous 1983 sales of 568,000. Sales would
be boosted by greater demand from in-
dividual buyers and because businesses
had deferred fleet replacement pro-
grams, Stammer said.
Real capital spending increased by 5
percent in the March quarter, the first
rise since June 1982. But final figures for
1983-84 might show a fall and the out-
look for 1983-84 is uncertain.
Stammer forecast a rise in parts of
the manufacturing, services and finance
industries. “I think overall capital
spending by business will do better than
business is predicting,” he said. “Confi-
dence will slowly come back. Business
capital spending could rise by 6 to 7
percent in real terms in 1984-85. But the
recovery in capital spending here will
be a good deal weaker than in the US.”
Stammer also predicted a further ex-
pansion of housing which has leapt for-

ward strongly over the past year. Build-
ing society loans for new buildings in
the March quarter were 70 percent
higher than in the March quarter of
1983. Building approvals in April fell
back 5 percent from the March level but
still were almost 18 percent above the
April 1983 level.
In the 10 months to April, approvals
rose by 38 percent over the correspond-
ing period of 1982-83.
“Housing will expand a little further
but could have passed its peak by the
end of 1984-85,” Stammer said. “It was
the first to recover and could come off
the boil. The savings banks and building
societies are chock-a-block with liquid-
ity but by the end of 1984-85 they could
have used up the excess.”
He listed mining, particularly coal,
farming and oil exploration (which was
suffering from weak energy prices and
additional taxation) as black spots
during the coming year. But even in
mining and farming a hope existed.
Stammer thought the US dollar very
likely would stumble in the second half
of the financial year.
Historically, Australian commodity
prices improved when the American
dollar was weaker.
Judy Sloan: “We should be cautiously
optimistic that 1984-85 is likely to be a
pretty good year,” Sloan said. The main
risk factor was wages and what the
economists call on-costs including
compensation, superannuation and
payroll tax.
“We need to keep the growth of real
wages within reasonable limits,” she
said. “That will be crucial because, as
the economy recovers, the pressures
build up.”
Sloan predicted an overall growth of
between 3 and 4 percent. The stronger
areas would be building and public sec-
tor spending, the factors which led the
recovery.
The pick-up would flow through to
the tertiary sector, including entertain-
ment, hotels, restaurants and recreation.
She also thought that non-metal manu-
facturing would perform well.
According to the Australian Bureau
of Statistics’ index of manufacturing
production, output has been increasing
although it remains low. The December
quarter index showed that manufac-
turing had returned to the level reached
in the first half of 1978.
In its March quarter report the bu-
reau recorded the first signs of restock-
ing since the September quarter of 1982,
ending a stock rundown.
But Sloan said the metal industry
was one which would show poor
growth. On the bureau’s figures, basic
and fabricated metal products are be-
low the levels of output of seven years
ago. “Metals are half the manufacturing
Judy Sloan: predicts overall growth of between 3 and 4 percent
Business can’t blame wages
THE THESIS that much of Australia’s
recessionary economic ills were the re-
sult of a wages explosion is being put to
the test now that labor costs have fallen
in real terms to the levels of a decade
ago. Treasurer Paul Keating is delighted
with the latest figures which remove
much of the business argument that
“wages overhang” stands between them
and increased investment.
For the March quarter of this year
the government’s index of average real
unit labor costs hit a low of 98 com-
pared with the base of 100 for the years
1966-67 to 1972-73. The index has
declined dramatically from its high
point of 110 in the September quarter of
1982. As the real cost of labor has come
down there has been a corresponding
improvement in business profitability.
This is good news for a government
depending on the private sector to sus-
tain the economic recovery of the past
year. The corporate gross operating sur-
plus share of gross non-farm product in
the March quarter is estimated to have
been 17 percent. This is only marginally
below the 17.2 percent average in the
four years to 1972-73 which business
would look back on as being golden
years. In the September quarter of 1982
this profit share of companies dropped
as low as 11.8 percent.
The Treasury in its round-up of
economic statistics for June suggests
some caution about both the wages and
profit share figures. The statistics on
which they are based are “particularly
subject to revision.” In addition, the
March quarter figures naturally do not
show the effect of the 4.1 percent nation-
al wage rise in April. This could have
reversed the trend during the past three
months.
Nevertheless, there is no doubting
the generally favorable trend for busi-
ness of the corporate profit share of
gross non-farm domestic product.
The wages share of gross non-farm
domestic product has gone in the oppo-
site direction. The peak of 67.6 percent
in September 1982 has dropped to 61.
Predicting the course of the profit
and wages shares is difficult, depending
very much on growth. But, if the wages
indexation system continues, there are
grounds for optimism.

Treasurer Paul Keating: outlook for private business fixed expenditure much brighter
sector and they’re really under the ham-
mer,” she said.
Another subdued area in 1984-85
would be mining, partly because of de-
pressed overseas prices.
David Michael: “I think the overall out-
look is not as bright as it was six months
ago,” he said. He had two reasons for
his view: the rural sector would turn
down and he did not see the US recov-
ery flowing strongly to the rest of the
world and, therefore, to Australia.
He forecast non-farm growth to be
about 3.4 percent, with the rural sector
contracting by 1 percent, leaving an
overall growth rate of about 2.5 percent.
In the non-farm economy, Michael
tipped housing and construction to
keep growing, if only because it would
remain a target of government stimulus.
In the rural sector, he thought wool
and meat might improve. Sheep num-
bers and cattle slaughterings had risen
by about 10 percent and both commodi-
ties had benefited from exchange rate
movements, with the $A devaluing
against its US counterpart. If developed
economies continued to pick up, sales
and prices of both would improve.
But the dry spell over eastern Austra-
lia posed a threat to the farm economy
generally. Rainfall in June over much of
the south-east was at record or near re-
cord low levels although rain fell last
week during the cold snap.
Michael said the prospects for grain
were not bright, with the Bureau of
Keating tips private investment growth
FEDERAL Treasurer Paul Keating has
predicted strong growth in private in-
vestment over the next financial year.
He said government policies would be
directed to reducing pressures, wages
and interest rates to encourage private
sector investment.
“The outlook for private business
fixed expenditure the mainspring of
economic growth is far brighter than
a year ago,” he said. “Such a lift in pri-
vate sector investment is essential if the
recovery is to be sustained.”
Keating, who will present his second
budget on August 21, promised signifi-
cant tax relief for low and middle-in-
come earners. “These tax cuts will be
made against the background that,
under the principles of the prices and
incomes accord, there will be little if
any wage increase in the next half-
yearly indexation case,” he said.
“Such an outcome which means,
between April this year and April next,
business can expect to face a minimal
increase in award wages will make a
significant contribution to restraining
labor costs and further restore the com-
petitiveness of industry.”
He said the Federal government
would reduce the budget deficit and,
therefore, its borrowing requirement
significantly. The government already
had secured the agreement of the prem-
iers at last month’s Loan Council meet-
ing to limit states’ borrowing demands.
“The public sector borrowing re-
quirement as a proportion of gross
domestic product is set to fall in 1984-
85,” he said.
“I do not believe as my record on a
range of issues dealing with financial
regulation indicates that governments
can directly determine interest levels.
“But what a government can do
and what this government has done is
create the conditions that are conducive
to further interest rate falls.
“In such a climate the lift in private
sector investment that is already being
signalled by the business sector should
be encouraged further.”
Keating told The Bulletin he ex-
pected non-farm economic growth in
this financial year to be much the same
as the 1983-84 level.
“On the basis of present figures GDP
is likely to have grown by more than 10
percent between the June quarter of
1983 and the June quarter of 1984,” he
said.
“This means that total product in
1983- would be more than 6 percent
higher than in 1982-83.
“Although this outcome reflects in
part the breaking of the drought, it also
reflects very solid growth of more
than 5 percent when comparing the
whole of 1983-84 with the whole of
1982-83 in non-farm product.
“Continuing growth in business and
consumer demand requires that excess-
ive pressures on both the capital and
labor markets be avoided. If that condi-
tion is met we can expect year on year
growth in the non-farm economy in
1984- not very different from 1983-
84.” □

Agricultural Economics predicting a 30
percent fall in the value of the wheat
crop and drop in wheat output from last
season’s record 22 million tonnes to
16.4 million.
The bureau expects the gross value of
rural production to fall by $450 million
3 percent to about $14.5 billion.
John Macleod: The coming year, he
said, would be better than last year
which was better than the year before.
“The real worry is whether we have ad-
dressed the fundamentals or whether we
are enjoying the cream on the top of the
cake,” he said. “Labor costs are the
critical factor.”
The strong areas of the economy in
1984-85 would continue to be housing
and state government and state instru-
mentality spending. “The electricity
phase (of their expansion) is over but
the states seem to have plenty of pro-
jects coming along,” he said. The motor
vehicle industry also had started to pick
up and was beginning to show some im-
provement in investment.
The weak points would be agricul-
ture, heavy manufacturing industry and
heavy construction.
“I would put mining somewhere in
the middle,” he said. “It’s doing a little
better. Tonnages are higher but not the
prices. I would expect that, as the world
economy improves, we could have
higher prices as well.”
At the moment, metal prices were
lower than at this time last year.
Higher tonnages at least have the
value of reducing miners’ unit costs and
output was increasing as the Japanese
steel industry began to recover. “The
first sign is in iron ore,” he said. “But it
should flow into coal as well. But the
world has built a lot of new capacity in
coal.”
Peter Dixon: The most important devel-
opment in the economy was and would
be the fall in unemployment, he said.
The government’s strategy of using an
artificially reduced cost of living index,
combined with tax cuts promised in the
budget, cut the cost of employing labor
without reducing the purchasing power
of workers.
Dixon predicts that what he called
capitalist disposable income profits
plus the after-tax earnings of the self-
employed would rise by 5 percent in
real terms. The rise would not be as
spectacular as last financial year of tax
bills on 1983-84 profits.
Overall, he was optimistic about the
economy. He did not name any specific
strong or weak sectors, saying he looked
at the economy generally rather than
splitting it into industry areas.
Neville Norman: The general outlook
was good, he said, although growth
rates would taper off. The main concern
was that the government would not
tackle the size of the deficit, which he
thought would be about $7.5 billion.
After making a quip about drugs,
pornography and tax avoidance advice
continuing to grow, he listed computer
programming and high technology in-
dustries as ones which would move
ahead. Others were banking and finance
and the service industries.
In spite of the efforts of indefatigable
Science and Technology minister Barry
Jones, growth in the high-tech areas has
been slow. But the government is en-
Neville Norman: the main concern is the budget deficit
couraging investment in sunrise indus-
tries, particularly through so-called
management and investment compan-
ies.
Some companies already have been
listed on the stock exchange, notably
Vapocure which developed a revolution-
ary paint drying process the rights to
which were sold recently to DuPont of
America. Vapocure shares peaked at
$l7 before settling back to about $9. An-
other listed high-tech company is Nu-
cleus Ltd, makers of bio-medical prod-
ucts. A number of new companies inclu-
ding New Tech Development Corpora-
tion, which is in the field of micro-chip
technology, are expected to be listed in
the coming months.
Norman named agriculture and
capital equipment as areas of poor
growth, the latter because it depended
heavily on the mining industry. “There’s
no hope there, short of World War 111,
for three to five years,” he said.
THIS is the fourth time in 15 months
that The Bulletin has asked senior econ-
omists to assess the state of the economy
and give their forecasts. Although those
who have given their views continue to
have differences of opinion, one point is
clear: what we might call the index of
economists’ confidence definitely is
rising. □
MINING
Other countries
reap benefit of
uraninum politics
By LESLIE KEMENY*
A FUNDAMENTAL difference be-
tween uranium and Australia’s other
raw material exports is that Australia is
purely a supplier of uranium: it has no
domestic consumption. The market-
place is far from our shores and from
the understanding of average Austra-
lians.
Australia supplies 12 percent of the
world’s uranium. Other suppliers are:
%
Canada 22
US 16
South Africa 16
Nigeria and Gabon 11
Namibia 11
Europe and other 12
It is estimated that by 1990, if Austra-
lia’s policies remain in limbo, the pos-
*Leslie Kerneny is senior lecturer in Nuclear
Engineering at the University of NSW and a
fellow of the Australian Institute of Energy.


ition will change so that Canada will
supply 21 percent, the US will drop to
13 percent and the rest will stay roughly
the same. Therefore, although sitting on
the largest reserves in the world, Austra-
lia is expected to be second to Canada
and South Africa for the next two dec-
ades.
That situation is not due to lack of
demand.
Ranger has long-term contracts with
customers in Belgium, West Germany,
Japan, South Korea, Sweden and the
US. Nabarlek has contracts with Japan,
Finland and France.
Ranger, currently producing 3000
tonnes of uranium 308 a year, has the
ability to double plant capacity with
modest capital expenditure and elevate
itself to the largest producing mine in
the world.
Nabarlek, although only a short-
term project in terms of ore reserves, has
unsold capacity which could take it into
the next decade while exploring for fur-
ther reserves.
Roxby Downs is estimated to have
more than 1 million tonnes of uranium
in a single orebody the world’s largest
deposit.
Department of Trade figures placed
uranium tenth on the list of export in-
come earners in 1982/83, only slightly
behind nickel:
$m
Coal 3077
Wool 1713
Meat 1678
Iron ore 1601
Alumina 1352
Wheat 1343
Sugar 552
Barley 488
Nickel 375
Uranium 360
Without further expansion, uranium
income will stay around the $4OO mil-
lion a year mark in real dollars for the
life of the existing Ranger and Nabarlek
projects.
Thus, while Australia prevaricates on
the pros and cons of uranium, Canada
is ready to reap the harvest.
There is no doubt that Australia
could supply larger quantities to the
world market if production were pos-
sible and domestic commercial policies
became pragmatic.
Restrictive commercial policies and
public indecision about Australia’s fu-
ture development of uranium reserves
simply are transferring our comparative
advantage (arising from huge reserves at
relatively low production costs) to com-
peting countries.
As the competing countries increase
their investments in uranium mining, so
they entrench themselves in maintain-
ing market share in the face of new
competitors. □
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Sparklers with a golden bonus
WHEN Gem Exploration and Minerals
NL sought diamonds in the Kimberleys
it was not expecting to find gold. Now it
has both.
But the company’s prospects appear
to be under-rated by the market, despite
the general recession in resource stocks
and last week’s fall in the SUS gold
price to its lowest level for a year. The
shares are selling at a big discount on
their 12-month high price, yet they have
just undergone a capital reconstruction
that has eliminated a lot of cumbersome
paper.
Gemex, a member of the Magnet
Metals stable, had disenchanted inves-
tors through a proliferation of paper
issues which saw capital blow out to al-
most 110 million 10c fully-paid shares
and nearly 12 million options.
At their peak, in the 12 months ahead
of the recent reconstruction the com-
pany’s shares were valued in the market
at $16.5 million. The company’s issued
capital now, however, is 12.9 million
fully-paid 20c shares and 2 million ven-
dor options. At last week’s closing price
of 67c, the shares were valued at $8.6
million and the company has some
$2.6 million in liquid funds. Further-
more, at that price, j the shares were
“cum” a one-for-six free option until
July 10 to take up a further share at par
by August 1986.
The accompanying map shows the
location of the Argyle diamond pipe
and various claims in which Gemex has
an interest, including alluvial gravel
beds on the Bow River and lower Lime-
stone Creek. The headwaters of Lime-
stone Creek drain the southern part of
the pipe and the Argyle consortium has
reported proven reserves on ground
held on the upper part of the creek of
1.7 million tonnes of 3.6 carats/tonne,
plus another 300,000 tonnes of probable
reserves averaging 3 c/t.
For the past two years, Gemex, in
partnership with the US-owned
Freeport of Australia Inc, has been in-
vestigating the lower Limestone Creek.
Last year bulk sampling of 2350 tonnes
of gravels yielded 16.94 carats/100
tonnes with one sample of 100 tonnes
running as high as 101.6 c/t.
Although the grades are lower than
those being worked by the Argyle con-
sortium, the company reports they are
significantly higher than the grades be-
ing worked on many alluvial fields in
South Africa, the gravels have no over-
burden and the gem count is far greater
than the grades Argyle is recovering
from the Upper Smoke Creek gravels
being worked on the northern water-
shed of the pipe.
Freeport estimates there are 53 mil-
lion tonnes of prospective gravels in
four terraces on Gemex’s Limestone
Creek tenements and so far all bulk
samples have proved to be diamond
bearing.
Quite apart from the diamond play,
Gemex holds tenements up into the
headwaters of the Ord River (south of
the area illustrated in the map) and ex-
tensive gold mineralisation has been
found. I will look at buying options in
Gemex when they list.
In the meantime, Cord Holdings
jumped against the market from 32c to
46c last week with the certainty that all
of Epoch Minerals’ gold interests in WA
would now be bought for $600,000.

Takeover bids tipped to flow
THE RUMOR mills predict a rash of
takeover bids to emerge in the coming
weeks.
Already launched is Castlemaine
Tooheys’ $3OO million-plus bid for the
international pharmaceuticals and
household products group Nicholas
Kiwi Ltd.
Also under way are the Entrad-
Bradmill group’s $16.7 million bid for
Courtaulds Hilton Ltd, Hartogen’s $19.2
million bid for Australian Hydrocarbons
NL and Pan d’Or Mining NL’s share ex-
change bid for its associate Walhalla
Resources Ltd.
Imminent bids were also being
tipped last week for Alliance Oil Devel-
opment Australia NL (which would have
to be around the $BO million mark) and
a possible plunge by Peko Wallsend for
the shares it does not already own in
uranium miner Energy Resources of
Australia. If it eventuates it will be a
super bite, with a price tag of around
$5OO million.
And watch out soon for a new thrust
from Ron Brierley his Industrial
Equity Ltd has recently tied up a credit
line of $llO million from BT Australia
as part of a $3OO-million “bank” as-
sembled for possible takeovers this year.
FOREX coming on
JOSTLING for foreign exchange deal-
ing action is on in earnest following
“He says, ‘Sell BHP and buy IBM’.”
Treasurer Paul Keating’s granting of 18
licences. The scramble is on for good
FOREX dealers and support staff.
Wildcat heard last week that the Securi-
ties Institute of Australia, which already
provides certificate and diploma
courses in the money market, fixed-in-
terest securities, corporate finance and
the stockmarket, will be introducing a
FOREX course in the first semester of
next year.
Just how fast FOREX is expanding
is illustrated by the experience of one of
the new licence holders, Midland Inter-
national Australia Ltd (formerly As-
sociated Midland Group).
MIAL will come to the market with a
total FOREX staff of 18 (from the gen-
eral manager Phillip Prideaux to back
office personnel) compared with the six
previously which handled hedge oper-
ations. MIAL has given the operations a
capital base of $54 million, against the
government’s minimum requirement of
$lO million.
MIAL has seconded a dealer, Gavin
McKinley, and the chief manager
FOREX administration, Derek Bassi,
from parent Midland Bank’s Bahrain
and London operations. Of the other
two full-time dealers, John Jeffery was
an internal appointment while another
has been poached from a major bank
but is yet to be announced. Overseeing
, the dealers is the former manager of As-
sociated Midland’s foreign hedge oper-
ations, Wayne Daley.
MIAL will also be starting trainee
dealers. Another outside recruit is
Christine Pogonowski, manager of
FOREX administration, formerly with
Wardley Australia.
To woo clients, MIAL has estab-
lished four separate divisions: foreign
exchange (dealing), advisory services,
administration and business develop-
ment.
As is becoming the practice with
other FOREX groups, MIAL has estab-
lished “corporate FOREX dealers” in
Sydney and Melbourne. Their job is to
talk to corporate treasurers about such
things as exposure to fluctuations in ex-
change rates, interest rates and the
prices of goods. They may spend some
time behind their video terminals but es-
sentially they are front men.
A true stayer
ONE OF Australia’s quainter small in-
dustries must be mead-making the
fermenting of a honey-and-water brew
with yeast to produce a drink that was
very big in medieval times.
In the vine country 40km south of
Adelaide, mead-maker Mark Maxwell,
of McLaren Vale, told Wildcat he knew
of six practitioners of his craft in Aus-
tralia.
Another mead-maker is just around
the corner at Daringa vineyards and,
Maxwell says, there are four other
makers in eastern Australia at
Mudgee, Tamworth and Richmond in
NSW, and Oily’s Mead, in Brisbane.
They are no threat to the wine indus-
try, however, for between the lot of

Happy parting
ACI International Ltd must be pleased
to see the last of Borsimex Pty Ltd, a
subsidiary which sold among other
things, sailboards, leisure and camping
goods.
After an unsuccessful experiment,
ACI has gradually sold off Borsimex’s
operations. What is left now is a virtual
shell company under the name of ACI
Fibreglass Pty Ltd.
Borsimex is better known for its part
in a recent court scrap between
sailboard vendors than for its profit per-
formance.
Late last month, claims for damages
by the holders of the patent for the
sailboard craft or “wind-propelled ap-
paratus” in Australia against alleged
importers of boards dubbed in-
fringers were rejected by Justice
Waddell in the equity divison of the
NSW Supreme Court. The plaintiffs
were Windsurfer International and
Sailboards Australia Pty Ltd. The de-
fendants (in two actions run con-
currently) were Borsimex, which, when
Sailboards Australia initiated its action,
was importing the Dutch Wayler board,
and a small Sydney-based importer,
Madowind Pty Ltd, importing the
French Crit boards.
At the time, Borsimex was a 50-50
venture between a major Dutch trading
company, Borsintij Wehry, and ACI.
Borsimex became 95 percent owned by
ACI.
Despite the successful defence, the
irony for Borsimex and ACI is that they
are both out of the sailboard business.
While preparing its defence ACI ap-
parently decided to get out of Borsimex
and sailboards. The managing director
of Borsimex, Teo Schoenmaker, who
had been sent to Australia by Borsimij
Wehry, and another Dutchman, Hans
Muller, left Borsimex midway through
last year.
THE CHARTIST
How Jabiru hurt Ampol Exploration
by Russell Lander
THE disappointing drilling results on
the Jabiru oilfield have sunk the share
prices of Weeks Petroleum, Weeks Aus-
tralia, Bell Resources and Ampol Ex-
ploration. In contrast, BHP which has
a 50 percent working interest in the en-
compassing permit NTP26 has held
up quite well on the sharemarket, re-
flecting its wide spread of interests.
The point and figure chart on Ampol
Exploration takes us back to the second
quarter of 1983 and has been plotted on
the basis of 5 cent variations.
Having broken its uptrend in March,
the share price had a quick pull-back to
a new high as if to trick the market into
believing that all was well. However, the
break below $4.20 should have dispelled
all lingering, bullish sentiments as it has
had the effect of delineating a major top
pattern giving a downside reading to
$2.85.
The objective has been achieved but
a wider interpretation of the top pattern
illustrated by the larger arc gives a fur-
ther possible target of $1.85. a level last
seen in this stock in the first quarter of
1983.
Other large Australian oil explora-
tion stocks such as Vamgas, Crusader
and Santos also display bearish chart
patterns at present.
This is a reflection of fears that crude
oil prices will collapse and that the fed-
eral government will devise other ways
of sharing in revenues from crude oil
production.

THE MODEST FARMER
Upset with the greenies
by Bert Kelly
I SUFFER from seminaritis. This affects
older people, particularly retired mem-
bers of parliament. After years of prac-
tice in Canberra, I have learned to sleep
during seminars looking wise. I usually
drop off" during the afternoon session
but no one notices and often when I
wake I hear people mutter admiringly:
“Fancy old Bert turning up again. He
must be keen.” But I really come to get
away from Mavis and the farm not
much chance of having a sleep there in
the afternoon; the family keep prodding
me awake.
However, as I grow older I notice
that seminars make me more irritable
and I think I will have to give them up.
People take so long to say so little and it
would not matter if much of it were not
said.
I attended an arid zone pastoral sem-
inar in Adelaide in April and it made
me cross, even though I had a splendid
snooze after lunch. I suppose it was the
greenies. They always upset me. The
chief greenie started me off. He de-
manded that the government conduct a
cost-benefit analysis of the arid zone
pastoral industry the idea being, I
presume, to find out if it was worth per-
severing with.
Eccles got all excited when he heard
this suggestion. Evidently, not many
cost-benefit analyses are being done
these days so he was eager to get the
contract. But I poured scorn on the idea
because I knew even before he got
started what the outcome would be.
After running around with his clipboard
and feeding his information through a
computer, almost certainly he would
find that about a third of the pastoralists
were making money, a third were break-
ing even and a third were losing. This
seems a kind of law which I am told is
related to the price of land. Eccles is
cross with me about this.
But what would they do with the in-
formation when they had it? Many of
the lesser greenies probably hoped that
the pastoral industry would be shown to
be non-viable and then they could have
their land back and they would be
happy. But what would happen to the
country then? Who would look after it?
Who would keep the weeds, rabbits and
foxes down and the water improve-
ments up to keep the kangaroos con-
tent? Who would put out the bushfires?
And who would look after the dog
fence, to prevent the dingoes coming
into the sheep country and eating the
kangaroos?
Would this be done by civil servants
working from 9 to 5, five days a week?
Who would find the money for this
when SA’s Environment and Planning
Department cannot afford properly to
care for the reserves it has? Members of
the government know this; they are not
stupid. But I must admit that the E & P
Dept has a unique ability to get pastor-
alists and farmers off-side.
Gough Whitlam once admitted that
there was a dictatorial streak in Labor
philosophy which makes them prepared
to crash their way through. This has
been painfully obvious in our state’s
legislation to control land-clearing, in-
troduced and administered in such a
way as to make farmers furious.
Our Department of Agriculture
would not have handled these matters in
this ham-fisted way. But Agriculture has
a tradition of being able to work with
farmers while the E & P is new, still wet
behind the ears and pushed from
behind by half-crazed greenies.
Still, it is not fair to blame everything
on the greenies. At the seminar, I asked
a pastoralist whose property I had seen
two years before in the grip of a devas-
tating drought how things were on his
place now. He replied that he had too
much feed and was frightened of the
risk of fires.
Then he added: “We were lucky to
be able to squeeze in a double lambing
and this has given us some badly-
needed money but it also has given us a
chance to keep our feed under some sort
of control.” He knows that saltbush is
healthier if pruned wisely by sheep and
this goes for most of the vegetation in
arid areas. It is better if grazed carefully
and to do this requires enough but not
too many sheep.
Then I was shown a letter dated
November 21, 1983, signed by Don
Hopgood, the minister for both Lands
and the E & P. It concluded with this
splendid example of bureaucratic dic-
tion: “It is appropriate for me to advise
you that the level and incidence of Pas-
toral Board surveillance will not dimin-
ish in the approaching post-drought
period. As relief occurs in the respective
pastoral districts, Pastoral Inspections
will have particular regard for carefully
controlled return to normal flock num-
bers, preferably only after follow-up re-
lief rains; sheep purchases and preven-
tion of double lambing strategies, etc
particularly on Runs where lessees
failed to respond adequately during
drought onset.”
I gather from that that the minister is
against double lambing. It must be won-
derful to be so wise. □

THE BULLETIN
Newsweek
BLN/7380L


The Bulletin and Newsweek have
joined forces in a unique publishing
arrangement which has produced the
most outstanding magazine in
Australia.
By coupling The Bulletin’s unsur-
passed coverage of Australian affairs
and Newsweek’s vast international
news-gathering resources, the restyled
publication is extraordinarily compre-
hensive in its coverage of domestic and
international events.
This two-publications-in-one design
greatly increases the value of each
publication for readers and advertisers.
For Readers
It creates a totally new magazine
offering a unique integrated view of the
complexities of national and inter-
national issues. For sophisticated and
balanced news coverage there is no
other publication that provides the
news-gathering depth and skill of the
new Bulletin with Newsweek.
For Advertisers
The benefits offered by The Bulletin
with Newsweek include:
1. Substantially Higher Circulation
We expect the circulation of The
Bulletin with Newsweek will be much
more than 125,000, which alone will be
an increase of 34% on The Bulletin’s
previous circulation of 93,600.
2. Substantially Higher Readership
The unduplicated readership of The
Bulletin and Newsweek is estimated by
McNair Anderson at 1,413,000. This
represents an increase of 37% on The
Bulletin’s former readership.
3. Improved Cost Efficiency
The full page colour CPM circulation
drops from The Bulletin’s previous
$48.00t0 $41.60 - a reduction of 13.3%.
4. New Cost Effective Rates
Although The Bulletin with
Newsweek is projecting a massive
circulation increase of 34%, the new
rate structure will be held to a minimal
15% increase over The Bulletin’s former
rates. This represents a drop of $1,405
in the combined colour page casual rate
for both titles - from $6,605 to $5,200.
5. No Bleed Surcharge
The Bulletin with Newsweek will not
charge a premium for bleed.
The Bulletin with Newsweek now
becomes the indispensable news
publication.

PIERPONT
Head office sale sweetens the pot
DELICATELY, Pierpont picked the
last piece of flesh from the skeleton of
the third kipper; he pushed away the
empty toast-rack and drained the coffee
jug into his Sevres cup.
Having lingered as long as conscion-
able over his breakfast, it was time for
your correspondent to begin a morn-
ing’s hard work.
He swallowed the last mouthful of
Andronicus and opened the annual re-
port of CSR Ltd.
CSR produces a toe-crusher which
endangers the feet if dropped. As
Pierpont sat looking at the cover of the
CSR 1984 annual report (it shows some-
one planting sugar cane which, given
the state of the world market, is prob-
ably unsaleable), he felt a pang of nos-
talgia for the days when companies told
shareholders a few cursory lies, posted
them a stingy dividend and then pulled
the blind down on their affairs until next
year.
Pierpont once wrote a column in
which he advocated that all annual re-
ports should be read from the back
page. The one he chose as an example
was CSR’s 1980 accounts, which fea-
tured a remarkable pre-acquisition re-
valuation of Thiess Holdings.
As a result, your correspondent
received a pained letter of criticism
from then-general manager Gordon
Jackson. As the letter was accompanied
by a bottle of the general manager’s re-
serve rum, Pierpont was able to bear
this criticism with great fortitude. In-
deed, after consuming the bottle, he was
easily the most fortified inhabitant of
the Croesus Club. But he took a sacred
vow that henceforth he would begin
CSR reports at page one which meant
that this year he loosened up by absorb-
ing the company’s telephone number,
the venue of its annual meeting and the
information that the group had made a
profit of $91.7 million after tax and be-
fore extraordinaries last year.
Attacking the thing in this style,
Pierpont made fair headway until page
3 where the directors briefly mentioned
the extraordinaries. CSR enjoyed a sur-
plus on extraordinaries in the year to
March of $300,000. This apparently in-
significant amount is actually the differ-
ence between extraordinary profits of
$75.7 million and losses of $75.4 mil-
lion.
The profits were those realised on the
sale of non-current assets, notably $48.9
million on the sale of CSR’s head office.
The losses comprised various provisions
for diminution of value in assets, inclu-
ding “as previously reported, an adjust-
ment Of $ll.l million arising from de-
tection of irregularities in the Readymix
Farley contracting business since 1981
and the recognition of costs associated
with re-establishing that business.”
The previous report was last August,
when CSR made a brief statement to the
stock exchanges that a potential ac-
counting discrepancy was being in-
vestigated in Readymix. On September
7, they announced that the investiga-
tions had revealed an overstatement
affecting the three previous years’ after-
tax profits of CSR by $8.5 million. The
overstatement arose from irregular ac-
counting, not misappropriation, and it
did not affect the group’s cash position.
By the time these statements had
reached the Pierpont mansion, he had
read through to note seven to the ac-
counts. Note seven showed $93.9 mil-
lion losses in a few “big lick” items off-
set by $19.3 million of future tax ben-
efits. Faced by such an enormous deficit
in extraordinaries, Pierpont’s first reac-
tion was that its $91.7 million profit
would have been wiped out if CSR had
not sold its head office and a few other
fixed assets during the year.
Brooding over this, Pierpont rang
CSR and was greatly flattered when
general manager Brian Kelman took
five minutes off from trying to sell the
sugar crop to answer your correspon-
dent’s queries.
Brian explained that Pierpont had
the boot somewhat on the wrong foot.
After CSR had sold its head office and
chalked up some other extraordinary
profits, it had occurred to the company
that this would be a good opportunity to
write down some of the overvalued
assets.
“There are a number of areas where
we may have paid too much or allocated
too high a proportion of goodwill to
some segments of business that we have
purchased over the past few years,” he
said. “I was to some extent taking the
opportunity of extremely high surpluses
on the extrordinaries to bring these back
to values I was happier with.”
One example was Thiess-Petroses In-
ternational Holdings Ltd, a wholly-
owned Hong Kong subsidiary of Thiess
Holdings, which was written down by
$6.9 million. Pierpont permitted himself
a smug glow of self-justification. This
represented at least slight vindication
for your correspondent’s remarks about
the Thiess revaluation of 1980.
A $25 million writedown “in antici-
pation of loss on disposal” related to a
mix of long-standing and recently
acquired assets.
Brian would not tell Pierpont which
assets they were because he did not
want potential buyers to know that he
had written them down. This puzzled
Pierpont who thought that CSR could
have advertised a fire sale (“Buy sub-
sidiaries now while the prices last: only
slightly water-damaged”). Obviously,
someone up there doesn’t know much
about marketing.
A $l9 million provision for diminu-
tion in the value of investments related
almost entirely to non-Thiess coal
mines, such as Hail Creek, Brigalow
and Theodore. Perfectly understand


able, given the state of the coal market.
But Pierpont still did not understand
the Readymix Farley imbroglio. An $8.5
million loss after tax in September 1983
had grown to a net $ll.l million in the
annual report. Note seven revealed it to
be a gross $20.5 million offset by $9.4
million future tax benefits. What on
Earth, Pierpont asked Brian as one
rum-drinker to another had the
Readymix lads been doing? Tossing a
generous shovelful of dollar bills into
every batch of concrete?
Brian explained that this one went
back several years. After CSR took over
and merged Readymix and Farley, they
had decided to bring their provisions
particularly depreciation into line
with those of the CSR group. Deprecia-
tion on plant and trucks had been no-
where near adequate.
There had also been a big stockpile
writedown. Very large stockpiles of
crushed rock had built up over the
years, notably on railway work on the
Nullarbor in South Australia. All this
rock had been carried in the books at
values far in excess of its real worth.
It still seems a lot of rock to Pierpont
who would have thought that, for $2O
million, Readymix could have ballasted
several railway lines across the conti-
nent. However, like all the other extra-
ordinary losses, no cash was involved.
Shareholders can take comfort from
the knowledge that the CSR books are
more realistic than they have been for
some years past. But it is a sobering
thought that overvaluation of assets can
reach such a point in a large company
that it takes the sale of the head office to
straighten out the books. Or, to put it
another way, what would CSR have
done to its 1984 profit and loss account
if it had not sold head office?
But, by that time, Brian had gone
and Pierpont had done enough hard
work for the morning, anyway, so he
retired to the Croesus Club for an
aperitif. □
CHESS
The Sicilian takes time
by Terrey Sbaw
A FRIEND asked last week how any-
body could still work up the courage to
play the Sicilian Defence (1. P-K4 P-
QB4), as he had never seen a published
game which was won by Black with that
opening.
Does Black ever win in the Sicilian?
Of course he does. It could hardly main-
tain its status as the world’s most popu-
lar tournament defence otherwise. Why,
then, does one have to search patiently
through reams of published games to
find one where Black comes out on top?
The answer lays the blame partly at
the feet of that otherwise faultless
species, the chess journalist. The short,
brilliant win is the meat of columns and
in the Sicilian the full point usually is
brought home by Black only after move
40, in the end game.
This is because White normally takes
the initiative in this opening, due to his
more advanced centre pawn and
quicker development. But in pursuing
the attack he often incurs a weakened
pawn structure which can be exploited
by Black in the end game.
As I hate playing against the Sicilian,
I will continue to do my bit towards dis-
couraging its appearance by proferring
yet another annihilation of it, this time
from the recent Commonwealth Cham-
pionship in Hong Kong.

THE CONTINUING rela-

brought to the surface some of
the odder goings-on in
women’s professional tennis.
Some parents are be-
coming wary of allowing their
daughters to compete in the
company of a number of the
world’s top players.
Two of these recently
checked into a top European
hotel which allotted them a

elder of the two ladies im-
mediately rang down and de-

Film negative
MGM’s 1939 classic Gone

banned from the list of films

The reason, explained
Olympic committee vice-

that “it depicts the negative
aspects of the black experi-
ence.”
Helpful hint
WIMBLEDON has been try-
ing to make things a bit easier

The Daily

NEWS WEEKLY, the journal
of B.A. (Bob) Santamaria’s
National Civic Council
a publication never to be
confused with the august
Newsweek believes it has
uncovered the reason for
Phillip Adams’ left-wing pro-
clivities.
Indulging in Freudian psy-
chology, the magazine says all
is explained by what it calls
his “miserable childhood.”
Adams’ early flirtation
with communism; on-going
serial concerns ... all flow
from violence suffered as a
child.
The theory has one draw-
back. News Weekly fails to ex-
plain how Adams, columnist,
ad-man and chairman of the
Australian Film Commission,
writes regularly for such no-
torious red rags as The Bul-
letin and The Australian.


The price of dissent
North Shore Times (NSW), June 15
GEOFFREY BLAINEY is
paying the price for dissent.
He has suddenly cancelled
speaking engagements with
his home base the Univer-
sity of Melbourne commu-
nity. These include addresses
to the University Parents
Group and the Post-Graduate
Association.
Warns Blainey: “The uni-
versities, of their nature, can-
not adequately preserve the
right to speak and to listen if
violent demonstrations chal-
lenge that right.”
Preparing for
the worst
A GRISLY clue to the immi-
nence of a new Iranian offens-
ive against Iraq, by its 500,000
troops massed along the bor-
der, comes from Turkey.
The number of soldiers al-
ready killed in the war (es-
timated at 240,000) has
created an unusual shortage
in Iran that of burial cloth.
Islamic burial rites demand
that a body must be washed
thoroughly, then wrapped in
white cloth (cotton or linen)
before being put in a coffin or
grave.
The Iranians have run so
short of suitable cloth that
they have approached neigh-
boring Turkey to help out. Ac-
cording to Turkish sources,
the Turkish state-owned tex-
tile giant Sumerbank is doing
a brisk trade in exporting
burial cloth to Iran and is
working at full capacity to
meet this growing demand.
Already this year Sumer-
bank has exported a million
metres of the cloth to Iran
under an agreement signed at
the end of 1983.
Now, according to the
sources, Sumerbank has
received a new order from
Iran for an extra four million
metres of cloth.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Micbael Lloyd
THIS IS an example of situations
that beginners find unusual but to
seasoned players they are com-
monplace.
White hung back in Black’s
home board, waiting for the shot
which was a long time coming. It
came when Black had borne off 13
men and White picked up the last
two.
At the time of the hit, White’s
board was not as strong as it is
now. Black has re-entered and
anchored White’s 1 point. While
rolls a 3-1. What’s the play?
We have to look at Black’s
priorities and hopes. For one,
Black doesn’t want to move. He’s
content to sit where he is until
White relinquishes the bar or 7
point. Black’s best roll would be a
double 2, allowing him to anchor
White’s 3 point. But barring a
double 2, Black will sit and hope
for an early escape, some big dice
and a narrow win. Black’s pos-
ition is not the best but it is not the
worst, either; the worst would be
to have both men on the bar
facing a closed board.
Knowing the furthest Black
can get is to White’s 9 point (with
a 2-6) White may be tempted to
move as shown by the dotted lines,
giving himself three shots to hit if
Black makes it to the 9 point.
But look at the solid line play.
White now forces Black to play
twos and threes. Black, therefore,
is odds-on to be forced to split his
back men.
This is not a rash play at all; in
fact it is conservative. White has to
dictate the play. Allowing Black to
maintain his 1 point anchor is
fruitless. White must force Black
to split.

Opening lead queen of
diamonds.
THERE IS something sad about
bidding a grand slam and going
down when the contract can be
made.
Consider this deal in which
South was in seven spades and
West led the diamond queen.
Declarer won with the king
and played the A-K of spades.
Had the trumps been divided 2-2,
the contest would have ended then
and there.
But when East showed out on
the second spade, south had to
stop drawing trumps in order to
take care of his heart losers.
He decided to try to cash the
A-K of hearts, planning then to
ruff two hearts in dummy. But
West trumped the first heart lead
and south went down one.
Certainly declarer was unlucky
to run into such a dreadful heart
division. It cost him 2310 points.
But it is also a fact that he should
have made the grand slam. All he
had to do was ruff dummy’s 9-8-3
of diamonds in his hand, instead
of trying to ruff his heart losers in
dummy.
The correct play at trick two is
to ruff a low diamond with the
queen. South then leads a club to
the ace, ruffs the eight of dia-
monds with the king, plays the
trump four to dummy’s seven and
ruffs the nine of diamonds with
the ace.
South now overtakes his nine
of spades with the 10 and draws
trumps, easily making the rest of
the tricks.
Declarer’s 13 tricks consist of
three diamond ruffs in the South
hand, four trump tricks in the
North hand and the three sets of
A-Ks in the side suits. At no point
does declarer have to rely on a
favorable spade, heart or diamond
division. He simply collects the 13
tricks there for the taking.
