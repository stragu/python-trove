THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
The tide of tourism
In the Yulara tourist resort at Ayers
Rock, Central Australia has lost more
than it has gained.
I was impressed by the Centralian
friendliness and easy-going manner in
1982, when I first moved from Victoria
to work at Ayers Rock. Locals enjoyed
a quality of life rare in the more
populated areas of Australia. Now, I
can only express sorrow that most of
this charm has passed away.
Big bucks tourism is finally here.
The friendliness has given way to the
phony, plastic and glitter smile of mod-
ern tourist resorts in all their ugliness.
The $160 million sterile atmosphere at
Yulara is quite inappropriate to Central
Australia. Yes, it has created jobs; yes,
an update of facilities was sorely needed
— but the financial and social cost is just
too much.
As David McNicoll states (B, Oct
16), Yulara will “revolutionise” visitor
comfort. But I’m sure David will readily
admit that most revolutions these days
are for the worse.

The shadow of Orwell
As a woman (and proud to be so), I
heartily agree with the sentiments ex-
pressed by Ray Gibson (B, October 23)
about “De-sexing the language.”
I am a farmer and that is what I call
myself when asked. I have no intention
of calling myself a farmwoman or, even
worse, a farmperson! The whole subject
has been carried to the point of
ridiculousness.
When I first read George Orwell’s
Nineteen Eighty Four, I felt it could
never happen. How naive of me!
Now I wonder how much longer it
will be before the rest of his “predic-
tions” are insidiously realised. It is
frightening.
MAUREEN LEGG
Gympie Qld
From jangle to jingle
A small jingle to comfort Ray Gibson:
When persons inane make our language
insane
and threaten our sexual existence,
we won’t be obeying
this asinine braying;
we’ll continue our passive resistance.

Regulating power
(Former federal Treasury head) John
Stone’s comments about regulatory
bodies deserve more prominent treat-
ment than they have received. The phe-
nomena he points to are widely ignored
in public commentary.
For example, last week there ap-
peared on the ABC’s Nationwide pro-
gram the chairman of the Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal and a gentleman
from a liquor industry association. The
subject, of course, was the tribunal’s
proposed further restrictions on alcohol
advertising on TV.
The effusive Ms Doogue was quick to
challenge the liquor man’s bona fides,
pointing out that he naturally had a
vested interest in unrestricted adver-
“Hallelujah! I’m a born-again drunk!’’

Together, we’ve been finding answers to keep Kraft
happy. In fact, Kraft has been relying on Honeywell
computers for more than 10 years.
In this time, applications have ranged from
administrative, manufacturing and distribution demands
to a variety of specialised jobs. Such as keeping track
of the butterfat content of all the milk supplied by
dairy farmers.
Within the last few months, Kraft has decided to
upgrade its data processing equipment by adding the
new Honeywell DPS/8. This innovative system will
operate in parallel with their present one, allowing both
new development and the transfer of existing
applications to take place simultaneously.
We at Honeywell are especially pleased that Kraft
intend to implement our HMS manufacturing system
to handle all phases of their food processing operations.
An impressive endorsement, considering their
position in the industry.
Kraft has also decided to use our Distributed
Systems Architecture to link 12 factories and 2
distribution centres. In this way they can maintain an

tising. This was not denied there is an
interest, a perfectly legitimate interest
and one which no attempt was made to
conceal.
Throughout all this the regulator was
allowed to sit mute, implicitly accepted
as a paradigm of disinterest. That is
nonsense.
Why does nobody ever point out that
the very jobs of such people are depen-
dent upon the existence of a system of
regulation?
The more extensive, the more com-
plex, the more restrictive a regulatory
system is, the more people it employs
and the more the heads of such systems
attract prestige, power and substantial
pay packets.
That is not to suggest that any par-
ticular proposal ought necessarily to be
taken as being propounded for the sole
benefit of the regulators: what is sug-
gested is that, just as plants grow toward
light, human nature decrees that regula-
tory bodies are attracted by power and
the prospect of power.
The return to the community of some
healthy scepticism about “public inter-
est” regulations would do a great deal to
preserve our vanishing freedoms.

Arts funding crises
Once again, in The Bulletin (October
30), there is a story of arts bodies in
crisis this time, in the theatrical world.
Why is this so?
The tendency is to blame the man-
agement and boards of all these com-
“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have seen Jit to find the defendant
not guilty. I suggest, then, that you put your heads together and come up
with someone who is!”
panies covering most of the arts field,
but one notices a curious similarity
among all of them — they are all funded
by the federal government via the
Theatre Board, the Australia Council,
the Australian Film Commission or
whatever.
Public funding for the arts via the
federal government bodies has dropped
by an average 34 percent in real terms in
between 1981 and 1984. That is a hell of
a drop in anyone’s terms.
No culture body can hope to run
effectively under those conditions. Of
all the promises this government has
broken (and my list is far shorter than
Mr Peacock’s), the one that has been
broken that will cause the longest-term
damage is this one from Mr Hawke’s
policy speech: “Restore over our term
in office spending on all arts programs
to the level achieved in 1975-76.” It just
hasn’t occurred and our cultural bodies
are literally bleeding to death.
By my count, 14 minor bodies have
died under this government and most
major bodies such as the Australian
Opera, the Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany, the Australian Film Institute, the
Australian Dance Theatre and so on
are suffering major financial crisis. The
reason in every case is the drop, in real
terms, of federal funding.
So, how about it, Mr Cohen? Are
you going to let the arts die or are you
going to stick to your promises?

Family unsettled
I sympathise with L. Fitzpatrick’s “fam-
ily reunion” problem (B, October 23). It
may or may not be a comfort to know
that, even if your brother HAD a guar-
antee of employment on arrival, it
would make no difference.
Our family member arrived here as a
baby, lived here for 21 years, attended
school, did tertiary training, worked
and considered himself a permanent
resident. He went overseas to travel, do
further study and to gain work experi-
ence in his field. But, as he had been
overseas for more than three years, he
has to re-apply for migration.
He is the only remaining member of
the family in the United Kingdom. He
has full sponsorship and has more than
the required number of 60 points PLUS
a firm offer of employment in his field.
He has his mother, two professionally-
employed brothers, two professionally-
employed sisters-in-law, a niece and
a nephew. All the family are home-
owners.
However, after 13 months, he has
still not been granted a visa. Ridiculous
reasons are given each time enquiries

The difference between Philips Hi-Fi Stereo Video
and normal Low-Fi stereo VCR is something like watching
a concert with only one eye and one ear open.
You're missing out on half the action.
But slip a Hi-Fi video cassette of a favourite movie
or concert into Philips Hi-Fi Stereo VCR, hook up your TV
to your stereo speakers, and listen.
During the high notes your dog will sit up and howl.
During the low notes the floor vibrations will curl your toes
up. You'll hear sounds you've never heard before, effects
that enhance the visuals with added realism. Because
Philips Hi-Fi Stereo VCR represents the new dimension in
home entertainment.
Not only will it out-perform the most sophisticated
sound systems, its slim-line compact design means you
can file it into your home entertainment rack. You might
even want to use it just for audio recordings.
Where else can you record a 4 hour concert in
Hi-Fi guality without running out of tape? Of course you
can also record in stereo and mono as well as Hi-Fi.
Alternatively you can play-back pre-recorded cassettes in
Hi-Fi, stereo or mono. And Philips Hi-Fi Stereo VCR has
more features than M.G.M. Typical of Philips well thought
out design is the Dockable Remote Control that's never
further away than your fingertips.
Press the release button and the infra-red remote
control glides out from a concealed drawer. A clever idea
that keeps your remote control where you can find it and
safe from inquisitive little hands.
There are also many other labour-saving niceties.

We want you
to have the best.

Fraser’s priorities
I noted with interest the comment by
Bruce Stannard after a lengthy inter-
view (B, October 30).
You will remember that you asked if
one of your senior journalists could in-
terview me and I indicated that I was
prepared to be interviewed on inter-
national economic and political issues.
That part of my discussion with Mr
Stannard seems to have gone a little into
limbo and I only wanted to say with all
kindness that I believe, in the article Mr
Stannard wrote, the wish may be father
to his thoughts.
Simply because I do not like using
words such as “never” a case has been
built that I wish to re-enter politics.
Putting it bluntly, I don’t. For my family
and myself, life is much better out of
politics and I don’t want that situation
reversed.
MALCOLM FRASER

Rallying call
W. T. Oldham’s reference to Lionel
Bowen’s call for Catholics to join the
Labor Party as a “call to immorality”
(B, October 23) seems to have complete-
ly missed the Deputy Prime Minister’s
intention.
The call was made, as Mr. Bowen
pointed out in The Catholic Leader of
September 9, so that Christians would
stand up and fight for the very prin-
ciples W. T. Oldham claimed are lack-
ing in the Labor Party’s policies.
Surely, the more Catholics who join
the party, the stronger the opposition to
such un-Christian ideas.
Therefore, to accuse Mr. Bowen of
“Now, course, I’m going back a
bit - at half past eleven ...”


“We’re looking for someone who can lie convincingly. The hard part is
knowing when we’ve found him!’’
not practising Christianity is a grave
misconception because this is precisely
what he is doing and calling other
Christians to do.
PAT RODGERS

Catholics and Labor
I would like to voice my disgust and
abhorrence in the Deputy Prime Minis-
ter, Lionel Bowen, who has called for
Catholics to support the Labor Party.
Although Lionel Bowen may well be a
Catholic, how can he expect others of a
similar religion to join a political party
which opposes the basic principles of
the Catholic faith?
Issues such as abortion on demand,
anti-state aid, organised crime, legalised
prostitution, homosexuality and full
marital status granted in de facto rela-
tionships have gained the support of
people in the Labor Party. The support
of legislation dealing with such matters
can only be seen as contributing toward
the total destruction of the family unit,
which is of prime importance to the
Catholic way of life.
On looking at legislation which has
been proposed by the Labor Party, it
becomes obvious that Bowen’s Catholic
beliefs are overshadowed or, rather,
ignored by ministerial colleagues
whose beliefs are quite different.
I was a member of the Australian
Labor Party until 1956. This change of
political allegiance was due to the fact
that the party’s beliefs began to conflict
with my even stronger religious beliefs.
Now, at the age of 82, I have come to
the conclusion that an allegiance to the
Labor Party can only be seen as a total
rejection of the Catholic faith.

Foley, man of letters
Bravo to Douglas Welsh (B, October 30)
for asking the question that has been on
my lips for years: “Who the hell is Larry
Foley?”
I support Welsh wholeheartedly in
his quest for knowledge of this prolific
letter-writer from the north.
Foley has been plaguing the Letters
to the Editor section of The Australian
for years. I am sure he is also swamping
the Brisbane Courier-Mail and the
Townsville Bulletin but I am too terrified
to look for I am certain his name will
leap out at me.
In the same columns in which
Douglas Welsh sounded his desperate
plea for illumination, I notice that Larry
scored two letters (a wearisome
backgrounder to the word “Colli-
wobbles” and a silly swipe at Bob) and I
can only fervently hope that this was a
Freudian slip on your part.
Two letters in the one issue!
Strike a light, the rest of we poor
mortals are lucky if we score one in a
lifetime.

Conservatives and liberalism
Like Paul Barclay (B, October 23), I was
pleased to read Tim Duncan’s excellent
cover story on the resurgence of the lib-
eral right in Australia.
However, I believe that to categorise
the people or ideas concerned as “Con-
servative” is highly misleading and
ultimately destructive.
Duncan deserves credit for drawing
attention to the tension existing on the
right between the newer breed of lib-
erals and the older “Conservative tend-
ency, represented by Quadrant maga-
zine and Bob Santamaria’s National
Civic Council.
There is every reason to expect that
this conflict will continue, given the fun-
damental differences in outlook of the
two sides. “Conservatism” is not so
much a philosophy as a reaction against
philosophies, relying instead upon tra-
dition, superstition and resistance to
change.
If “Conservatism” means anything,
it is adherence to the status quo which
in Australia means the mixed economy
and the welfare state. The defence of the
free market, small government and indi-
vidual rights is liberalism however
many of its enemies try to appropriate
the title for themselves.
To illustrate the difference, it is only
necessary to note two of the stands
taken by The Bulletin (often labelled as
a “Conservative” publication) in recent
issues the defence of Asian immigra-
tion, and the attack on the Costigan
Royal Commission. Neither is likely to
appeal much to the “Conservatives,”
but both, I would argue, are sound lib-
eral positions.

Environmental fears
The statement by the Leader of the Op-
position, Andrew Peacock, that, if
elected, his government would never
use the external affairs power to over-
ride the wishes of a state government
has alarming implications.
Not only could the Franklin be de-
stroyed but all other World Heritage
areas would be at risk. The Queensland
government may mine or drill the Great
Barrier Reef without restraint and the
Northern Territory government create
more uranium mines in Kakadu Na-
tional Park.
Another implication is that the
Queensland government could be able
to mine Fraser Island.
Malcom Fraser carried on the en-
vironmental initiatives of the Whitlam
government and in some ways im-
proved on them. Now, all are threat-
ened.
The Australian Heritage Commis-
sion may be disbanded and the En-
vironmental Protection Act 1974 made
inoperative.
There is an urgent need for the oppo-
sition to clarify this statement and detail
exactly what they would do if elected,
on the matters outlined.
Unless this is done, every person and
every organisation that wants the
beauty and interest of Australia’s nat-
ural heritage kept intact must work for
the defeat of an opposition party going
unashamedly naked environmentally to
the electors.

Terrible testimony
Mr B. Morris (B, October 16) apparent-
ly bases his denial of the murder of six
million Jews by the nazis on the fairly
tenuous belief that the personal testi-
mony given to The Bulletin “seems no
more reliable than others.”
How does Mr Morris explain the fact
that the personal testimonies of my
parents and grandparents square exact-
ly with the accounts of many hundreds
of thousands of survivors in all parts of
the world?
Does he seriously think that my fam-
ily is taking part in an international
conspiracy designed to mislead the
world?
Does he really believe that many
thousands of survivors would delib-
erately mutilate their own bodies and
tattoo their forearms merely to give sup-
port to a wild conspiracy?
Does he think that the accounts
given by thousands of American and
British soliders who liberated the sur-
viving concentration camp inmates are
also “unreliable”?

While reading your cover story “Asians

to the photograph on Page 80 sup-
posedly “Springvale shops”. Having
spent some 20 years living not far from
Springvale, may I suggest that this
photograph was taken somewhere quite
some distance from Springvale: Rich-
mond perhaps?
Since when have there been tram

League of Rights right
That which is blasphemous and unlove-
ly in the eyes of Phillip Adams when it
comes to the League of Rights may well
result from the particular colored
glasses he looks through. Personally I
find much that is lovely and full of truth
in the league, which in the pursuit of
truth has to forsake popular acclaim.
The woes of the world today can be
traced very largely to the perpetuation
of historical perversion. Christ said,
“The truth will make you free,” and
prefaced his remark with necessity of
discipleship to his word. Humanity is
increasingly embracing perversions of
truth in political, economic and finan-
cial principles which destroy freedom
and establish slavery. Such principles
are promoted as orthodox and un-
challengeable and are often accepted as
such by our major institutions of
Church and Education. It is assumed
that anyone who does challenge such
principles is queer, unlovely and blas-
phemous.
The holocausts of the first and sec-
ond world wars which destroyed the
lives and hopes of millions of innocents,
have had a number of direct results on
historical development which would not
have been realisable without those wars.
I list the following:
1. The establishment, spread and
consolidation of international commu-
nism.
2. The destruction of Christian prin-
ciples in western governments and
economics.
3. The exploitation of the natural de-
sire of the Jewish people to a national
home in destabilising the most import-
ant strategic area in the world, the
Middle East.
4. The establishment of a prototype
world government agency to condition
the minds of people to the acceptance
of such a government with the conse-
quent loss of personal and national
sovereignty which are foundation


stones of truth and freedom.
The opposite concepts are to be
found in Christian social principles
which the league has continously ex-
pounded and which, quite naturally,
have been strenuously opposed and per-
verted by that large body of intelligent-
sia which has embraced atheistic social-
ism as its religion.

Beating the burglar
I was very impressed by your article on
burglaries (B, September 25). Let’s hope
that the general public will take note.
I believe a great deal can be done to
deter burglaries. The obvious:
1. Lock all doors and windows se-
curely.
2. If the house is empty for a great
deal of time, install an alarm system.
3. Don’t brag in public places about
buying VCRs, jewellery, or your new
computer.
And yet probably the best way of im-
proving the burglary situation is to do
something about the drug situation.

Denigrating the digger
It is a well established fact that all our
wars were started by politicans. In the
main, they generally omitted to attend
any of the dirtier aspects of them. Quite
understandable, no doubt.
During the tenure of this present
government, despite loud declaimers to
the contrary from the relevant minister
and other sundry politicians, we have
seen a rapid and unprecedented decline,
in fact a disintegration, of the medical
care doled out to war veterans of all
ages and all wars. We have now reached
the ultimate insult ... as from July 1,
1985, we are to be given almost the same
medication as the rest of the commu-
nity, including young unmarried
mothers, invalid pensioners of all back-
grounds and heavens knows who else.
Of course all these people have many
more votes than do war veterans.
Surely, we, as returned service
people, are entitled to something a little
better than this. Many of us suffered
dreadful physical and mental damage,
not forgetting the matter of very difficult
rehabilitation after any of the wars, es-
pecially when most of the good jobs
were then held down by cold-footers,
white feather merchants and war profi-
teers. “A land fit for heroes” what
rubbish!
The current government does not
give a “tinker’s cuss” about war vet-
erans; they never have and they never
will. There is a federal election in the
offing. Let all of us who served register
our protest at this shabby treatment by a
government which has no regard for us
whatsoever. They give vast sums to
themselves, all the perks in the world, a
new parliament house, any ragtail/
bobtail organisation which says it needs
money.
Forget the old diggers of all wars and
all services: let them rot. Why not let
them die? It’s much cheaper that way.
That’s exactly what this government
is going to do. They are just too anti-
service to care about the steadily de-
clining health of all the people who de-
fended this country.
Because they can not, or will not en-
sure that funds are available for war vet-
erans, but readily available for all sorts
of hare-brained vote-catching schemes,
we are to get the chop literally. A fine
case of ingratitude in anyone’s book by
an uncaring and heartless government.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Packer denial
KERRY Packer, chairman
and chief executive of Con-
solidated Press Holdings Ltd,
denied allegations by royal
commissioner Frank Costigan
QC that Packer was connec-
ted with murder, drugs and
the financing of a tax avoid-
ance scheme. He said allega-
tions against him in the report
of the royal commission into
the painters and dockers
union were unsupported by
any facts. Prime Minister Bob
Hawke said he was opposed
to the naming of people who
might not have charges laid
against them.
• The new McCarthyism, page

Trimbole moved
ON THE advice of Australian
police officers, Robert Trim-
bole awaiting extradition to
Australia in Dublin’s Mount-
joy Prison was moved to a
top-security section of the jail.
The reason: fears that the
Mafia would try to have him
killed by a professional assas-
sin. In Australia, the taxation
office petitioned for bank-
ruptcy, saying Trimbole owed
$1,956,038 in back taxes.
Plane shown
AUSTRALIA’S first F/A-18
Hornet air-to-air fighter and
air-to-ground attack plane
was “unveiled” at the
McDonnell Douglas works at
Rajiv Gandhi prepared to light the funeral pyre of Indira Gandhi
St Louis, Missouri. Each of
the 75 aircraft on order for
Australia will cost about $25
million.
Murphy verdict
BY A three-to-one majority, a
Senate select committee
found that by trying to influ-
ence a court case involving
the Sydney solicitor Morgan
Ryan, Justice Lionel Murphy
could have been guilty of be-
haviour serious enough to
warrant his removal from the
High Court. Only Labor
Senator Nick Bolkus dis-
sented. Chairman Michael
Tate (ALP), Janine Haines
(Dem) and Austin Lewis (Lib)
agreed in varying degrees that
Murphy did attempt to influ-
ence the course of justice.
Murphy went on leave for the
rest of the year, saying he
would fight any action to re-
move him.
• See story page 54
New stance
IN AN “unprecedented”
move to push the Builders
Laborers’ Federation into
line, the ACTU gave other
unions the right to cover the
BLF’s work at the Sydney
police centre site. The union
refused to obey an ACTU
ruling that the BLF should
end a two-month strike at the
centre and return to work
there without 14 sacked mem-
bers. The NSW government
introduced legislation to de-
register the BLF.
Divorce drop
BUREAU OF Statistics fig-
ures showed that Australian
courts granted 43,526 divorces
last year 1 percent fewer
than in 1982. This was the first
drop since 1979. The largest
category of couples divorced
47.7 percent of the total
had been married less than
nine years. The ACT recorded
the highest divorce rate with
5.8 marital breakdowns per
1000 people. NSW and Vic-
toria had the lowest with 2.6.
THE WORLD
Gandhi killed
THE INDIAN Prime Minis-
ter, Indira Gandhi, 66, was
shot dead by two Sikh mem-
bers of her own security guard
near her home. Her son Rajiv,
40, was hours later elected by
the ruling Congress (I) Party
to the Prime Minister-
ship. Anti-Sikh pogroms in
many parts of the country cost
hundreds of lives and con-
siderable material damage.

Priest’s body found
THE BODY of a Polish priest
abducted on October 19 by se-
curity police officers was
dragged by frogmen from a
water reservoir north-west of
Warsaw. Jerzy Popiel-
uszko, 37, was an ardent sup-
porter of the free trade union
movement Solidarity. The
Polish government con-
demned the murder.
Tory support grows
DESPITE mounting unem-
ployment, support for British
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher is rising. According
to Market and Opinion Re-
search International, the Con-
servatives are leading Labor
44 to 35 percent. The Social
Democratic-Liberal Alliance
is third, with 20 percent. In


August, the Conservatives and
Labor ran even and the Con-
servatives led Labor by six
points in September.
Fire in Jakarta
TWO DOZEN people died
and more than 100 were
injured when fire ignited an
ammunition dump at the In-
donesian Marine Corps head-
quarters in Jakarta. Tonnes of
bombs, grenades and bullets
exploded and rained on vil-
lages as far as 10 kilometres
from the blast. Authorities
suspect sabotage.
Stalin returns
Svetlana Alliluyeva Peters,
daughter of Soviet dictator
Joseph Stalin, returned to
Moscow after living in the
West for 17 years. A Kremlin
announcement said Soviet
citizenship had been restored
to her. She was stripped of her
citizenship after defecting and
publishing details of her
father’s private life.
Fuel embargo
THE SOVIET Union applied
a total embargo on fuel
supplies to Britain in support
of the striking British coal
miners. The move was an-
nounced on state television by
the secretary of the Soviet
coalworkers union, Alexander
Belousov. Last year, Britain
imported oil worth about $530
million and small quantities
of coal from Russia.
BUSINESS
Auction winner
AT WHAT was called the
“auction of the year,” the UK
group Reckitt and Colman
PLC and America’s Con-
solidated Foods Corporation
bid for Nicholas Kiwi Ltd at a
seven-hour meeting of the
pharmaceutical and boot pol-
ish group’s shareholders.
Consolidated Foods emerged
the winner in a deal worth
more than $450 million and
$5.25 a share for Nicholas
shareholders.
Walton’s loss
WALTONS BOND Ltd con-
firmed market expectations by
reporting a $17.9 million loss
in the 12 months to July 31.
This compared with a loss of
$8.6 million the previous year.
If the results of furniture-and-
electric-goods chain Norman
Ross 50 percent owned by
Waltons had been equity
accounted, there would have
been a loss of $25 million.
Going public
AUSTRALIA’S largest
locally-owned advertising
agency, Monahan Dayman
Adams, announced plans to
go public. The agency, which
has billings of about $lO5 mil-
lion, will float 30 percent of
its capital to the public
through the issue of 4.3 mil-
lion 20-cent shares, issued at a
premium of 60 cents.
Oil flows
THE Challis No 1 well in the
Timor Sea looked to have
strong commercial prospects
after strong oil flows during
the week. The well recorded
flows of 5000 and 4700 barrels
a day in separate tests over the
interval 1391.5 to 1403.5
metres. Unofficial estimates
put oil reserves at 50 to 100
million barrels.

COVER STORY/AUSTRALIA
The new McCarthyism:
trial by smear
Royal commissioner Frank Costigan, second from left; beside him, assisting counsel Douglas Meagher, QC
The lurid headlines about Kerry Packer have tended to disguise the more sinister
aspects of the Costigan royal commission’s final report. The implications concern every
citizen who cares for civil liberties, argues Yh. e Bulletin’s editor TREVOR SYKES.
THE IMPORTANT aspect of the treat-
ment meted out by royal commissioner
Frank Costigan to Kerry Packer, the
ultimate owner of The Bulletin, is that
Packer may be merely the first victim.
Costigan believes that the existence
and future menace of organised crime is
such in Australia that it needs to be
countered by methods which remove
much of the present tedious process of
justice, such as a trial in open court and
the right of the accused to defend
themselves.
Costigan’s ideas are set out in his
final report, volume 5, paragraph 9.005:
“The successful criminal will have
acquired substantial wealth. That
wealth necessarily is the product of
income illegally obtained. It is the
‘unexplained’ nature of that income
which should be the focus of the investi-
gation. The acquisition of it needs to be
the subject of both tax assessment and
public exposure. The criminal sanctions
hitherto applied have demonstrably
failed to contain satisfactorily the
trafficking in drugs.”
Perhaps the most disturbing feature
of this recommendation is that anyone
who was believed by an investigator to
have an unexplained source of wealth
could be subject to these penalties
without trial. He might not, if
Costigan’s methods were followed, even
be given a chance to explain where the
money came from. But first let us look
at the penalties themselves, starting with
public exposure.
Costigan’s proposals for this are put
in volume 2, chapter 14, entitled “Ex-
posure”. Costigan is a strong advocate
of publicity as a means of deterring and
punishing criminals (this attitude per-
meates the whole report and also his
conduct of the royal commission). He
points out that when he published, in his
fourth interim report, details of
“bottom-of-the-harbor” schemes, the in-
cidence of this form of tax evasion was
effectively stopped. But when details of
a different form of tax evasion were
given in his fifth report, publication was
suppressed on the grounds that it might
prejudice the trial of the participants.
Costigan says that similar fraudulent
schemes are still operating because this
case did not receive enough publicity.
He goes on to say (vol 2, para
14.022):
“The explanation given for not


publishing material of this type is that it
may affect reputations or may prejudice
the criminal trials that result. I shall deal
with the latter proposition now, leaving
the other for later. In the examples I
have given, the names were omitted thus
precluding any direct effect on reputa-
tion. The only way in which reputations
would be harmed was if the person
could be associated by extrinsic
material to the criminal scheme. Surely
that is not a concern.”
One would have thought it was a
considerable concern. Any report which
emanates from a royal commission al-
leging illegal activities immediately be-
gins a guessing game about
the names of the principals.
They are usually identified
accurately by extrinsic
material, ie facts about the
individuals which are known
to the public but not stated in
the royal commission report.
It is important to recognise
that we are not talking here
about a newspaper investiga-
tion which unearths some
criminal activity and prints
the details. I have undertaken
many such investigations in
the area of corporate crime
and am acutely aware of the
rights of the accused to sue for
defamation. Instead, we are
talking about a report issued
by a royal commissioner who
is covered by the protection of
privilege and cannot be sued.
No recourse in law is open to
the accused. All he can do is
make a public statement and
hope it will receive adequate
exposure in the media. Even
then, he may risk a contempt
action by the royal com-
missioner.
Costigan defends his pro-
posal by saying it is rarely suggested
that a magistrate or judge will be
affected by pre-trial publicity. The argu-
ment is usually that a jury will be
swayed. Referring to a case in which
The Age was alleged to have committed
a contempt during the trial of the
Zampaglione brothers in 1980, Costigan
points out that while the contempt was
found proven, an application to dismiss
the jury failed. “It seems these judges
had'a stronger regard for the integrity of
juries than do some of the com-
mentators today,” Costigan says (vol 2,
para 14.027).
He then goes on to say (vol 2, para
14.029):
“The second consideration advanced
against the publication of reports of
royal commissions is that they may
adversely affect the reputations of
citizens, with there being little redress.
That they can affect reputations is be-
yond question, and certainly there is no
redress. But reputations are not entitled
to absolute protection. A reputation is
something to be earned and retained by
the individual; it is not a right such as
liberty or property. Its protection in law
is limited.”
He then quotes as authority: “The
law recognises in every man a right to
have the estimation in which he stands
in the opinion of others unaffected by
false statements to his credit.” per Cave
J. in Scott v. Sampson (1882) 8 Q.B.D.
at p. 503.
Costigan continues: “This should be
treated with the qualifications now
Kerry Packer: innocence did not help him
found in the law of libel and I do not
propose a discourse on that subject
here. The point I make is that the right
to reputation is limited to protection
against untrue attack, not against any
attack.” (vol 2, para 14.030).
Wrong. When an individual is falsely
attacked under privilege he has no
redress under the laws of libel.
Costigan barely concedes that this
point could arise and certainly does not
appear to think it worth worrying about.
Here is what he has to say on the subject
(vol 2, 14.031):
“Commissions of inquiry are con-
stituted by people in whom the govern-
ment presumably has confidence will
discharge their duty in a proper manner.
If their findings affect reputation it will
normally be deservedly so. It would be
an extraordinary thing to find a royal
commissioner embarking on a cam-
paign of libel or slander. The complaint
that reputations are harmed by reports
of commissions is empty of relevance or
materiality unless by such a complaint it
is suggested that the reports contain
untrue slanders. If the reputations are
harmed by a report which is based on
fact, the harm is done by the exposure to
public view of those facts. It is the facts
that hurt; not the report. But there are
many avenues by which reputations
may suffer harm without any right of
redress being available. Further, if a
commissioner acts responsibly, there is
a great public interest in his being free
of threats of legal action thus allowing a
fearless report on matters of public
significance.”
It is in a sense fortunate for
the wider community that we
have to hand the first example
of how such a public pillory-
ing system would work. It is
the case of Kerry Packer.
Costigan has certainly
reported fearlessly on Packer,
being influenced neither by
his wealth, his status NOR
HIS INNOCENCE. The
report contains several
“untrue slanders” and the
“many avenues” of redress
are not apparent.
Anyone who knows Packer
could testify that he is not a
plaster saint but would also
agree that the implications
that he was somehow linked
to the drug trade or a murder
would be laughable if they
were not so serious. There is
even some evidence that
Costigan himself does not
believe them. Nevertheless, he
has presented a report in
which the implications are
made and he has taken no
opportunity to disavow them.
The allegations are made
without any evidence tendered by
Costigan. Costigan makes much of an
allegation that Packer removed a file
sought by his commission. The allega-
tion is false on all counts. Packer never
removed a file, nor ordered a file to be
removed. It was not even one of his
files.
Costigan never approached Packer
to test the truth of any of these allega-
tions. Packer has been given no op-
portunity to defend himself against
them. He cannot sue Costigan for libel
(he could sue anyone publishing an
unfair version of Costigan’s report but
the original report is so unfair that this
is cold consolation).
Costigan says it is the facts that hurt,
not the report: but he has then produced
a factless report, in which allegations
are not supported by evidence. He says:
“But there are many avenues by which
reputations may suffer harm without


any right of redress being available.”
This could equally well be put: “If
citizens can be slandered by other
means without legal redress, then it is all
right for a royal commissioner to do it
too.”
In Vol 1, para 3.o4s,Costigan says
(discussing Packer’s complaint about
his conduct):
“To suggest, in these circumstances;
that I am acting in a fashion similar to
Senator [Joseph] McCarthy (now
deceased) of the United States is.
patently ridiculous. At no time have I
publicised Mr Packer’s name or
suggested that he be dealt with by public
denigration in preference to the
ordinary course of the law. I still do not
do so. To the extent that he warrants
investigation, I recommend it be done;
to the extent that he warrants prosecu-
tion, I urge it be done.”
The implication is that Packer
warrants prosecution for something
unspecified. This implication is
repeated elsewhere in the report. Take
Vol 1, para 3.024: “The enquiries into
Packer-related matters quickly ex-
panded, taking into their breadth a
number of complex land transactions
and the death of Mr Cootp. These, and
other matters, are reported upon in
detail in volumes 9, 10 and 11 (all
suppressed). A perusal of these matters
quickly reveals their great ambit. Any
one of them warrants a major inquiry.
-None of them has been, finally com-
pleted. All require further investigation.
Upon completion, I expect there to be
proceedings in the courts for some or all
of the persons involved.”
The .words “or all”, taken with the
rest of the paragraph, imply that Packer
is somehow linked with a number of
matters requiring major investigation,
perhaps including the death of Mr
Coote, which Costigan elsewhere says
he is “satisfied” is murder (vol 1, para
5.082).
It is hard to imagine a graver allega-
tion which could be made against any
citizen. It is even graver when that
allegation is made from behind the
protection of privilege.
If the allegation is investigated and
the evidence found insufficient to
warrant a prosecution, there may never
be any form of trial or inquiry at which
Packer’s name can be cleared. (The
authorities, for example, might decide
not to hold any public inquiry because
the allegations were baseless and further
publication of them might thereby
defame people other than Packer.)
Despite Costigan’s protestations,
these are indeed the methods of the late,
unlamented Senator McCarthy. It is
trial by smear, with no redress. .
Take vol 5, para 8.007:
“The individual can be isolated by
adverse publicity whether of a formal or
informal (my emphasis) nature. Formal
use of publicity as a punishment has
been rare, that is, since the abolition
of the stocks. The US National Com-
mission on Reform of Federal Criminal
Laws (the Brown commission) in a 1970
draft study put the view that formal
publicity as a stigmatising, prestige-
lowering sanction be used in criminal
proceedings... Ultimately, this pro-
posal was dropped from the final report
of the commission. Nevertheless it
obtained substantial (and continuing)
support.” He. adds that “improvement
in the use of informal publicity as a
It was a Bulletin investigation which sparked the royal commission
means of controlling corporate crime
Was also the subject of suggestions.”
Costigan goes on to use this argument to
allow more public hearings where royal
commissions are examining suspected
offenders. This is more acceptable than
exposure by report but it still has flaws.
A witness on the stand can be attacked
by questions of the “Have you stopped
beating your wife?” type, with no op-
portunity to test the veracity of the
allegation. He may not necessarily even
be allowed to establish that he is un-
married.
Costigan does not spell out With
much precision what he envisages by
adverse publicity of an “informal”
nature. It appears, however, to include
“investigative journalism” (para 8.008)
One wonders whether this would in-
clude the leaking of confidential in-
formation to friendly journalists.
Throughout the Costigan Royal Com-
mission, The National Times was a
recipient of much confidential informa-
tion. Some of this was leaked by at least
one officer of the commission.
Worse is the procedure adopted in
respect of evidence. “There were a
number of people subject to those inves-
tigations who I feared, if they knew the
extent, would seek to frustrate them. Mr
Packer is one such person... His
suggestion that in such circumstances I
would countenance the public revela-
tion of my investigations into him, thus
equipping him with the latest informa-
tion on progress, is not acceptable.”
Certainly there is need for secrecy while
an investigation is progressing, but if
the investigation is going to culminate
in-a report of a most public kind, then
surely the investigator’s suspicions need
to be tested by interviewing the
principals. The Costigan method is to
take evidence in secret where his sus-
picions tell him he should and then to
publish his suspicions to the world
without ever giving the accused an
opportunity to explain his actions.
These are the methods of the Star
Chamber, not of a democratic society
under the rule of law.
Indeed, Costigan goes on to advo-
cate powers greater than those
possessed by the Un-American Activi-
ties Committee, which could defame
people but could not itself cripple them
financially.
Costigan advocates this extension of
power in the other penalty he advocates
for criminals the tax penalty.
Costigan proposes, in effect, that the
existing powers of the Australian Taxa-
tion Office and a royal commissioner be
combined to again in effect seize
the assets of a suspect.
The full details of his proposal are
set out in volume 5, chapter 9, titled “A
New Approach”. Costigan favors (vol 5,
9.004) “an approach which hits hard at


the financial structures built up by the
drug traffickers.” He continues: “This
might even be to the exclusion in some
cases of the imposition of criminal
sanctions where there can be great
difficulties in obtaining admissible
evidence and convicting the offenders.
With the attack on the finances which
would involve in the forefront the use of
income tax legislation would be
coupled public exposure.”
This raises a central principle.
Costigan proposes that a suspect whom
it would be too difficult to convict in a
court of law indeed, who could not be
convicted should be penalised by
exposure and tax assessment, thus
bypassing the criminal law entirely. The
horrifying part of this is that the suspect
could be anyone. The investigators
would only have to think he was guilty.
We have already seen how “public
exposure” could work and, in Packer’s
case, is working. Costigan advocates the
appointment of a Special Taxation In-
vestigator who would work in conjunc-
tion with a Taxation Investigation Tri-
bunal (the initials suggest some other
name would ultimately be chosen).
The Special Taxation Investigator
would have matters referred to him by
the Australian Taxation Office, the
National Crime Authority and other
bodies and could initiate investigations
himself. His role would be “to investi-
gate criminally-sourced income with a
view to the issue of assessments on
otherwise recalcitrant taxpayers
(ultimately, the intention being to col-
lect the taxes avoided by seizure of
assets where necessary).” (vol 5, para
9.018).
The investigator’s target will “not
necessarily be restricted to the proceeds
of drug trafficking” (vol 5, para 9.022).
It will include “any apparently un-
explained accretion of great wealth”
(ibid).
The tribunal would be an in-
quisitorial body with power to insist
that answers be given to questions even
if it meant a witness incriminating
himself. Witnesses would have the right
to be represented.
I would support Costigan in the
abolition of the defendant’s right to
remain silent if his answer might in-
criminate him. It has been said that, if
criminals were drafting the legal code,
this is the first provision they would
write in. Such a provision protects only
the guilty because the innocent should
have nothing to fear from it.
However, the Special Tax Investiga-
tor and the Taxation Investigation Tri-
bunal would have between them the full
powers of the tax office. Costigan re-
veals that he has used these already. In
vol 2, 13.019, he says:
“I was the first to make substantial
use of it (the tax weapon) as a weapon
against criminal organisations in this
country ... The methods of operation
adopted by my staff were directed at the
financial wealth of these principals. The
assessment of tax, and penalty, was
relatively straightforward in such cir-
cumstances. It was also quick. An as-
sessment could be issued within a
matter of a week of the initial warning
being given. Since the operations also
identified the properties and other
assets of the criminals, it was possible
for Mareva Injunctions to be obtained
to prevent the. disposal of those assets
and ensuring the payment of the tax.
Thus the criminal principals could be
relatively quickly relieved of much if
not all of their wealth.”
These powers are exercised under
Section 167 of the Income Tax Act,
under which the commissioner can
make a default or arbitrary assessment
of whatever tax he thinks should be
payable wherever he is satisfied that
there is undeclared assessable income.
It is a quite draconic power, under
. which an individual can be quickly
stripped of all his assets.
- In vol 5, para 9.009, Costigan notes
that the power of the Commissioner of
Taxation is greater than that of the law
enforcement agencies in some ways. For
example the burden of proof is reversed
under Section 190 (b) of the Income Tax
Assessment Act which says that, in an
appeal to a Supreme Court against the
disallowance by the commissioner of an
objection from a taxpayer, “the burden
of proving that the assessment is ex-
cessive shall lie upon the taxpayer.”
“It is a powerful provision,” notes
Costigan. “It enables the commissioner
to uphold assessments which, although
issued bona fide, may not be capable of


proof by the ATO [Australian Tax
Office] against the taxpayer to the
requisite standard of the courts.”
He adds (vol 2, para 13.021) that he
was disappointed that the National
Crime Authority would have in-
sufficient access to the tax records to do
this as effectively as he had done.
This is Costigan’s justice. Laid bare,
his argument is that it should be poss-
ible to revile someone publicly and seize
his assets without ever having to prove a
case against him in a court of law.
This is to be done in the name of
suppressing drug trafficking and major
crime. There can be no doubt that such
criminals are odious to Australians and
deserve such punishments, if not worse.
But what happens if an innocent in-
dividual is hit by such persecution?
Anybody who has had a dispute with
the ATO over what he or she feels to be
an unjust tax assessment is familiar with
the draconic and arbitrary way in which
the ATO handles objections and the
excessive time it takes to handle them at
all. And the public pillorying of Kerry
Packer shows how a citizen can be
reviled without redress.
‘ Packer ; who did
challenge Costigan’s
powers , gete rather
worse treatment
than anyone else
Fortunately, these things are not
going to happen in the immediate fu-
ture, because the National Crime
Authority has been set up with some
specific safeguards. But his recom-
mendations have gained support in
some of the media, and may well be
raised again if the authority comes
under attack for being “soft” on or-
ganised crime.
It is well, then, to look at the factors
which led Costigan astray on Packer.
How, after all, did an intelligent and
able lawyer come to bring down such a
report about a leading businessman
whose methods may sometimes be ag-
gressive but never criminal?
Personal factors should not be
overlooked. Costigan has throughout
been thorny with anyone who
questioned his powers or conduct. At
various times he has taken umbrage at
the federal and Victorian Attorneys-
General, and the Queensland Premier.
It is notable that Packer, who did
challenge Costigan’s powers, gets rather
worse treatment than anyone else in the
final report because the most sinister
interpretation appears constantly to be
placed upon his actions. Referring to
the Federal Court action taken by
Packer to block Costigan’s investiga-
tions of his affairs, Costigan says (vol 1,
para 3.018):
“By seeking to stop my enquiries
before giving his explanation, he
allowed the inference to arise that his
explanation was not one of in-
nocence ... His unwillingness to enter
the witness box and confirm it, but
instead to engage in costly court pro-
ceedings had the effect of heightening
my suspicions that the explanation was
not true.”
Contrast this with vol 1, para 6.002
where, referring to Federal Court
Packer’s reply to Costigan
ON NOVEMBER 2, the chairman of
Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd, Kerry
Packer, issued a statement denying the
allegations made about him in the final
report of the Costigan royal commis-
sion. We give the main points of the
statement here ...
4 MR COSTIGAN has concluded his
royal commission as unjustly as he con-
ducted it. It is unjust by the standards
Mr Costigan set for himself.
He has disgraced the institution of
royal commissions and his own pro-
fession as a lawyer. The Costigan report
has indelibly demonstrated that sub-
stantial power invested in a person pre-
pared to use it in a warped, arbitrary
and unprincipled way can decimate in-
dividual rights and totally over-ride
basic principles of justice.
His published report tabled yester-
day is a dishonest and malicious docu-
ment. It makes a number of explicit al-
legations against me which I have never
been given an opportunity to answer. It
gives rise to a large number of innuen-
dos and damaging inferences which,
again, I have never been given an op-
portunity to answer. The allegations
against me are based on nothing more
than Mr Costigan’s own supposition
unsupported by any facts.
Mr Costigan has alleged that I
financed a film tax avoidance scheme
promoted by Brian Ray and lan
Beames. He has suggested that I have
been involved in the financing of drug
transactions. He has suggested that I
was involved in the alleged murder of
Mr lan Coote.
I did not finance the tax avoidance
scheme. I gave sworn evidence before
the royal commission that I did not
finance it. Mr Ray gave sworn evidence
before the royal commission that I did
not finance it. Mr Beames gave sworn
evidence before the royal commission
that I declined to finance it on one occa-
sion and that he had no knowledge of
whether I had financed it or not. There
is absolutely no evidentiary basis for Mr
Costigan’s assertion.
Mr Costigan refers to the death of
Mr lan Coote. He alleges that Mr Coote
was involved in some dishonesties con-
cerning the sale of real estate through a
land development in which both Mr
Brian Ray and I held interests. So far as
Mr Coote is concerned, I do not ever
recall having met him. I can say posi-
tively that I did not meet him or indeed
know of his existence whilst he was a
bank manager at Capalaba. I have
never been to that bank. I have never
had an account there.
However Mr Coote died, I had no
involvement in his death in any way. Mr
Costigan has never explicitly alleged
that I did have any such involvement.
However, he has by innuendo and
wicked inference suggested that I had
some unspecified connection with the
death of this man.
So far as drugs are concerned, there
is no evidence to suggest that I have had
anything to do with drug trafficking. I
abhor drugs. I have always campaigned
strongly against the use of illegal drugs
and I will continue to do so. I have been
a substantial contributor to drug rehab-
ilitation schemes and it is a most sicken-
ing libel of me to suggest that I would
have anything to do with this dreadful
social evil.
Mr Costigan makes a finding that on
my instructions a file was removed to
Singapore and Hong Kong from my
Sydney solicitors’ offices for the pur-
poses of frustrating his inquiries.
I gave no instructions of any kind
that any file should be removed out of
Australia by any person. His allegation
is totally false. The file which Mr
Costigan is concerned about was not my
file, it was not a file belonging to any
company that I either owned or con-
trolled. I had no ability or power or
right to give any instructions to the sol-
icitors concerning the disposition of
that file. In fact, I did not give any such


challenges to his authority, Costigan
says: “These proceedings may be
regarded, and I do so regard them, as
the legitimate expression of a citizen’s
right to challenge the activities that are
perceived to affect his interest adversely.
I have no quarrel with this legitimate
and open conflict.”
It is important to remember that
Packer was examined by Costigan only
once. They had no other contact during
the inquiry.
Costigan by then was relying heavily
on documentary evidence in place of
viva voce. Thus, all subsequent evidence
against Packer has been compiled
without him ever asking Packer for an
explanation.
As a long-term investigator of
corporate crime, I can testify that docu-
ments are highly valuable but can also
be highly misleading. There comes a
point in any investigation when you
need to ask a few questions of a living,
breathing human being although
perhaps not the person you are tracking.
Costigan disagrees. In vol 2, 4.004,
he says: “It has been my sad experience
to find that witnesses coming from all
‘There comes a point
in any investigation
when you need to ask
a few questions of a
living human being ’
ranks in society showed scant regard for
the oath when pressed on difficult
matters.” (He ,goes on to dismiss
Packer’s statement that he liked to keep
large sums of money at home as
“humbug” and “nonsense” not an
opinion that would be shared by anyone
familiar with his gambling habits.)
Costigan therefore claims (vol 2, 4.007)
that this mode of acquiring information
is “not very lucrative.”
Later, talking about the uncovering
of an apparent “washing” operation
involving 20 or 30 people, Costigan says
(vol 2, para 12.011):
“To those who say, ‘Ask the particip-
ants’, I point out that if it were a
washing operation none of them would
be likely to admit it. Further enquiries
of a different kind were required. The
direction of those enquiries required an
operation head with some feel or intui-
tion for the ultimate answer.”
Intuition? Certainly a valuable tool
for any investigator seeking to
unscramble a complex set of transac-
tions or to link apparently unrelated
matters, but only valuable (or admiss-
ible as evidence) if later confirmed by
proof.
If intuition is allowed unchecked
rein say, in a royal commission report
in which individuals are accused of
wrongdoing with no opportunity to
know, let alone test, the evidence we
are on a slippery slope indeed.
To be fair, Costigan continued to
make a similar point saying that the
intuitive jump had to be followed by
meticulous attention to detail. This
meticulous attention seems somehow to
have been lacking in several instances
affecting Packer.
There would also appear to be a
social factor operating. The following
quotation is from vol 1, paras 2.044 and
2.045:
“I was taken to court, as is almost
always the case, by the wealthy and
intelligent; by the type of person who is
potentially the greatest threat to civil
liberties of the citizen. Such a person is
no stranger to the legal system nor is he
shy of employing the very best that
money can command to erect a formid-
able barrier against investigation. My
experience is no different from that of
law enforcement agencies. It simply
reflects the power of wealth and
privilege. Such people have enough
advantage without placing more in their
hands.” (The final sentence is a re-
ference to the preservation of civil
liberties.)
This displays an extraordinary at-
titude. Are the wealthy and intelligent in
Australia really the greatest threat to
civil liberties? Or are the various
totalitarian political movements and the
various non-elected areas of
officialdom? In the first sentence, just
after the words “wealthy and in-
telligent,” should the word “criminals”
have been inserted? Or was it
deliberately left out? Are the wealthy
and intelligent to be denied the right to
defend themselves and to be accorded
the same legal rights as the rest of
society? Costigan may have come closer
to the truth here if he were criticising the
Legal Aid system, which provides enor-
mous, costless funds to the other end of
society.
At least the wealthy are spending
their own money. There is a strong
contrast here between Costigan’s treat-
ment of Packer and the Federated Ship
Painters and Dockers Union. In vol 1,
instructions. One may add that, if I had
attempted to give any instructions, they
could not be complied with consistent
with the solicitors’ duty to their client.
The only connection between me
and the file is that it was held in the
offices of a large firm of solicitors who
acted for the foreign client who owned
the file as well as for me.
It is an important allegation for Mr
Costigan because he uses it to justify his
denial of justice to me. He says that,
because I was the sort of person who
deliberately removed files from the jur-
isdiction in order to frustrate his inquir-
ies, I could not be accorded that which
the law entitled me to namely, a right
to answer allegations made against me.
In defending himself for his admitted
denial of natural justice to me, Mr
Costigan commits yet another breach of
natural justice. I am not aware of the
basis of his conclusions concerning the
removal of the file. At no time did he
put th,at allegation to me. At no time did
he put that allegation to any of the sol-
icitors who were questioned in the royal
commission. He has arrived at this ex-
traordinary conclusion without any of
the persons against whom that finding
was made being given an opportunity to
state their evidence.
His finding on this matter is, quite
apart from being unjust, a cowardly
one. He has waited until his final report
to make this allegation, believing that I
am not able to sue him and that I am not
able to call any evidence in his commis-
sion to answer it. It is a vicious parting
shot hurled over his shoulder on his way
to France.
When I studied the transcript of the
hearing in Brisbane and saw the manner
in which the commission has set out to
smear both Mr Ray and myself, I
realised that Mr Costigan’s interest in
me was not bona fide. I did not, how-
ever, at this stage say that I would not
appear; I simply repeated my request
for details of the way in which he con-
sidered my activities to be related to his
terms of reference.
At this point, it is useful to consider
the extraordinary way Mr Costigan in-
terpreted his terms of reference. As is
well known, Mr Costigan’s commission
was set up to inquire into criminal ac-
tivities of the painters and dockers
union. The terms of reference were ex-
panded to include criminal activities of
persons associated with painters and
dockers.
So far as I am aware, I have never
met a painter and docker and I am cer-
tainly not a member of the union. But
Mr Costigan appeared to adopt a foren-
sic version of the old music hall song “I
danced with a man who danced with a
girl who danced with the Prince of
Wales ...”. 5


para 2.044, immediately before his re-
ference to the legal habits of the
“wealthy and intelligent,” Costigan
says: “It should be borne in mind that
the amateur criminal, the criminal of
low intellect or scarce reserves of
wealth, takes no advantage of the pro-
tective measures (the civil liberties pro-
vided under law). In my case, I was not
subject to challenge in the courts by the
union or its members, notwithstanding
their dissatisfaction with the progress of
enquiries.”
Indeed he was not, because the union
some of whose members could
scarcely be called amateur criminals
took a simpler and cheaper course.
They boycotted the royal commission
hearings. On July 1, 1981, following the
death of the Victorian branch secretary
Jack “Putty Nose” Nicholls, members
of the Victorian branch voted to refuse
to co-operate with the commission.
Henceforth no member of the union
ever gave evidence to Costigan. They
‘There is a strong
contrast here between
Costigan’'s treatment of
Packer and the painters
and dockers union '
were all in clear contempt of the royal
commission. Some of them ultimately
received $5OO fines, which amounted to
a slap on the wrist. In some respects,
Costigan is amazingly tolerant of the
union. He does not even recommend its
deregistration, arguing that this would
serve no useful purpose because the
same criminals would regroup else-
where (vol 3, paras 3.023 to 3.027). This
attitude is in sharp contrast to the
ferocity with which he believes white-
collar crime should be attacked.
The decision to downgrade oral
evidence and to follow instead the
document trail, inevitably led Costigan
away from his original brief and toward
white-collar crime. The Federated Ship
Painters and Dockers Union was not
rich in documents even by union
standards. Several are said to have been
destroyed in fires. The Bulletin’s original
series of articles which sparked the
royal commission made a point of the
fact that the union had for years failed
to lodge proper returns with the Arbi-
tration Commission.
I am not here alleging that Costigan
deliberately switched track, but to a
former office-bearer of the Victorian
ALP, white-collar crime must have been
a more socially satisfying target, par-
ticularly when he managed to enmesh
one of Australia’s most prominent
businessmen. The enmeshing occurred
simply because associates of Packer had
an account at a bank branch where
another person being investigated by
Costigan had an account. Thus was
Packer dragged into the Costigan
vortex.
A final aspect of his social attitude is
his view of reputation. On this Costigan
has somersaulted. In his fourth interim
report (vol 2, para 10.48) Costigan had
this to say about royal commission
reports:
“The third purpose that may be
contemplated is that which is found in
reports submitted by crime commis-
sions in the United States of America.
Those reports are designed to publicise
the nature of the criminal activity and
the identity of the criminals involved in
it. It appears that they are published
without there first being any charges
laid against the persons named nor any
proceedings in any court of any kind
being taken against them. Thus the
commission may destroy reputations
without there being recourse available
to the person harmed. I find that diffi-
cult to justify. I do not believe there is
any need for it to be done. I do not
believe it would be acceptable in
Australia. That is not to say that where a
person holds a public office, and mis-
behaves, he should not be identified in
such a manner. In that case it is the
price to be paid for the holding of the
office. It is a different matter where the
person subjected to such a report is no
more than a private citizen conducting
his private affairs in the community.
Again, it is a different matter if he is
charged and convicted of some offence.
There would then be sufficient grounds
for the publication of his name and a
description of his activities in a public
report.”
We have already seen how Costigan
has now swung 180 degrees to propose
the public exposure of whomever an
investigator identifies as a criminal. We
have also seen how small is his concern
for damage to reputation. He defines his
goals in vol 1, para 2.027:
“The time and place for concern for
■ the civil rights of those allegedly offend-
ing the law is at the point where they are
at risk of losing their rights. The basic
and most important rights are those
relating to liberty of the person and
possession of property. There are, of
course, many other rights but they are of
lesser significance and their protection
is not as important as is that of liberty
and property.”
Costigan’s report is liberally sprink-
led with the diverse quotations of a
well-read man. There is one missing. It
is from Othello:
He who steals my purse steals trash;
'tis something, nothing;
Twas mine, ’tis his, and will be slave to
thousands;
But he who filches from me my good
name
Robs me of that which not enriches
him,
And makes me poor indeed.
SP BETTING
Report may
prompt changes
in the law
By RICHARD FARMER
ROYAL commissioner Frank Costigan
obviously does not listen keenly to Sat-
urday afternoon racing broadcasts.
In his report on SP bookmaking,
Costigan outlined the importance of a
pricing service which sends betting fluc-
tuations to illegal bookmakers. Men
known colloquially as “wombats,” says
Costigan, illegally transmit prices to an
operator outside racetracks by talking
into radio devices in their pockets. This
information is passed in turn to an oper-
ational base and then phoned to SP op-
erators. In the bookmakers’ hands, it is
an important part of the service they
offer clients.
There is no reason to doubt that such
pricing services exist. And they are not
bought only by illegal bookmakers.
Trotting and greyhound racing clubs
used them for years when the Australian
Jockey Club refused to sell them its offi-
cial prices service which is telexed to
gallop clubs throughout the land. But
the advantage of this information in the
hands of SP and their clients is nowhere
near as marked as it used to be and
Costigan suggested that it still was.
Radio stations are by law allowed to
broadcast only prices on the totalisator
before a race is run. Yet race callers giv-
ing the tote odds constantly use little
euphemisms to indicate the book-
makers’ odds as well. A horse that is 3/1
on the tote is “half-a-point longer” in
the ring. All but naive punters know
that means bookmakers’ odds of 7/2.
And it is information that radio stations
ought to be giving to the TAB punters at
home. No one on course would be
taking the tote price when it was lower
than what bookmakers were offering.
Off-course punters should not have to
take under the odds, either especially
out of ignorance.
But Costigan is not really interested
in the punters. The theme of his report
on illegal bookmaking is tax avoidance
the avoidance by the SP operators of
federal income tax and state betting


turnover taxes. And, in these areas, it is
quite likely that his report will prod
governments into changes of the law.
The royal commissioner reached his
conclusions in these areas through case
studies of people who often came to his
notice initially for quite different
reasons. One of them was Harold
Edward Price who initially operated as
an SP in Victoria and moved to New
South Wales, perhaps after a conviction
in February 1975.
Price paid tax on at least some of his
winnings as a bookmaker but the au-
thorities in 1983 began putting “extreme
pressure on him with a view to assessing
him for close to $2 million in tax.”
Costigan reported that the signifi-
cance of Price’s difficulties with the
taxman was this: “It is often claimed by
the tax authorities that one of the bases
for the secrecy provisions contained in
Section 16 of the Income Tax Assess-
ment Act is the voluntary disclosure by
taxpayers of income earned from illegal
activities. That is, taxpayers are pre-
pared to disclose their illegal activities
and the income therefrom on the basis
that they are secure from that informa-
tion getting into the wrong hands
(namely law enforcement agencies).
“The evidence that I have taken
during the course of my commission
gives no credence to that philosophy.
Although SP bookmakers may well de-
clare some of their income and the il-
legality of the means of earning it,
nevertheless they also use all the tech-
niques of other tax evaders. Separately,
I might point out that I have no evi-
dence of any person who has earned in-
come from drug trafficking declaring
the source and fact of such income.”
In the face of such a strong state-
ment, the federal government will be
under considerable pressure to change
the secrecy provisions of the Income
Tax Assessment Act.
Secrecy has been an article of faith
but it will take some convincing argu-
ments from the taxation commissioner
to retain it. The commissioner certainly
will be asked for an estimate of how
much tax is paid by people whose in-
come is earned by illegal means. If the
amount is not considerable, in the light
of the importance which Costigan at-
taches to law enforcement officers
having access to taxation records to
combat organised crime, it is hard to see
how the public good is served by retain-
ing the secrecy.
The avoidance by illegal operators of
betting turnover tax has occupied the
minds of state politicians for many
years. In NSW, Premier Neville Wran
has taken advantage of Costigan’s re-
port to raise again the prospect of
legalising SP betting. By doing so, Wran
would open the way for substantial in-
creases in revenue.
The method which Wran is most
likely to follow is that recently ad-
vocated by Queensland Racing minister
Russ Hinze.
Hinze tried unsuccessfully this year
to get cabinet approval to allow regis-
tered bookmakers to have phones at
racecourses. Punters could ring in bets
during a meeting and both the govern-
ment and the race club would collect
their shares of the turnover tax. The ad-
vantage of such a system over establish-
ing off-course betting shops is that the
competition with the TAB would not be
direct. Supervision by the government
would be easier, as well.
The alternative to making provision
for legal betting with bookmakers from
off the racecourse is to try to gain the
revenue by forcing punters to the tote
by wiping out the illegal operators. In
his report, Costigan concedes that this
approach has not had much success in
Australia. Yet he recommends substan-
tial increases in penalties to make SP
bookmaking much riskier.
Not only those caught taking bets
would suffer under the Costigan plan:
Punters, too, would become liable to
fines of up to $25,000 if caught
putting on bets illegally. That prospect
is unlikely to appeal much to politicians
who realise that people use SP because
they like the service offered. Yet, to do
nothing but continue “to legislate for its
illegality whilst at the same time con-
doning it” is also an unattractive option
for politicians.
Public opinion, helped along by
Costigan, is concerned about the police
corruption which is a prerequisite for
SP bookmakers operating.
The political problem is at its most
acute in NSW. Costigan claims, with
some reason, that SPs have moved from
Queensland and Victoria to NSW be-
cause of more lenient penalties in that
state. The pressure on Wran to act is
now considerable. □

PICKERING’S ELECTION


POLITICS
Rural revolt threatens poll setback
By DAVID BARNETT
THE MOOD of anger in the bush has
become so strong that it must raise a
question mark about the government’s
prospects in its rural seats for the gener-
al election on December 1.
Forty-seven seats are classified as ru-
ral in the enlarged House of Represen-
tatives of 148 members. Of these, the
National and Liberal parties either hold
or would hold 32 on the basis of the
1983 federal election result. The other
15 are Australian Labor Party seats.
About half of these probably are at risk
for the government.
Another 19 seats are classified as
provincial, where more than half the
population lives in cities or large towns.
Examples are Cunningham (NSW),
which contains Wollongong, and
Herbert (Queensland) containing
Townsville.
The ALP holds 16 of these provincial
seats four of them comparatively
narrowly.
Australia has about 170,000 farms
and the anger of the farmers who live on
them is unquestionable. It
flows from actions taken by
the federal government, by
state governments particularly
in New South Wales and Vic-
toria and from the state of
world commodity markets.
The rural terms of trade,
the ratio of prices received by
farmers to their costs, has
been moving steadily against
the man on the land to the
extent of about 5 percent in
the past year.
Their revenues have gone
up 10 percent over the past
four years while the consumer
price index has risen 31 per-
cent, their costs have risen 36
percent and government
charges and taxes have gone
up by 54 percent.
The Bureau of Agricultural
Economics calculates that ru-
ral incomes over the past year
will have declined by 29 per-
cent. That means that the in-
come a farmer receives from
working his land for a year is
falling from about $11,500 to some
$B5OO less than half average weekly
male earnings, which are slightly more
than $20,000 a year.
Farmers benefit from government as-
sistance to the extent of about $l.l bil-
lion a year in subsidies, differential
Wal Fife with Liberal “heavy” Jim Carlton last week in Wagga.
Stephen Lusher opening his campaign office in Wagga
pricing, drought assistance and adjust-
ment schemes. However, the total bur-
den on the rural sector from the protec-
tion given to manufacturing industry is
$2.2 billion. If primary industry were
not supporting this load of secondary
industry protection, representatives ar-
gue, average rural incomes
would be about twice their
present level.
To blame such deep-seated
and long-standing structural
factors on a government
which has been in office for
only 18 months is, of course,
hardly reasonable. Nor is it
reasonable to blame the feder-
al government for increased
rail freight charges and for de-
lays at grain terminals or for
higher water rates, which all
are state responsibilities.
But the resentment created
by acts of God, the workings
of world markets and the
deeds of state governments
have prepared the ground for
ire over actions which are un-
questionably those of the
Hawke government.
Resentment is focused on
four specific actions.
New excise arrangements
for fuel add $25 million a year
to farm costs.
The government trebled meat inspec-
tion charges, from $l.BO to $5.40 a head
for cattle. Steps have been taken to re-
duce this charge and to split it into dom-
estic and export components, but the
political damage has been done.
To save 250 jobs in a factory, the


government imposed a tariff on grain
harvesters which increases their costs by
about $15,000 a header a total for the
wheat industry of $l4 million. Farmers
say that a bounty would have achieved
the same result at a cost of about $2
million, spread more appropriately over
the whole community.
The government also abolished the
Income Equalisation Deposit scheme
which was designed to enable farmers to
even out fluctuating incomes through
purchase of tax-deductible bonds which
were taxable when redeemed in later,
bad, years.
Farmers are the main section of the
community which does not consider the
ALP government to be a good economic
manager. The National Farmers Feder-
ation led the call for a low budget defi-
cit. However, the windfall jump of $2
billion in rural taxation when the
drought broke was used not to reduce
the deficit but to finance tax cuts to
wage-earners.
The public sector borrowing require-
ment which was about $45 billion two
years ago is heading toward $9O billion.
As a result, Australian interest and infla-
tion rates are above those of competi-
tors in the international food and fibre
markets.
Add to this anxiety about Aboriginal
land rights, produced by minister Clyde
Holding’s handling of the heritage bill
and of land rights legislation to be in-
troduced after the elections.
Add also the insecurity produced by
the search through 10 percent of the
land area of NSW for training grounds
and artillery ranges for the army. The
indignation produced by this process
led to a march which ended with the
“We don’t even have to ‘divide
and conquer’ they’re doing
it for us!”
gates of Parliament House in Sydney
being forced.
Yet, the greatest damage to the gov-
ernment’s standing among farmers has
been done by the assets test being
imposed on pensioners and by taxation
measures either taken or feared.
A farmhouse has no value except the
cost of its construction, less deprecia-
tion, while a house of the same standard
in Sydney or Melbourne may be worth
four or five times as much.
Thus, a retired city-dweller with a
$200,000 house and $50,000 in other
assets will pass the test and receive a
pension. But a farmer with a $50,000
house and $200,000 in other assets will
not.
A farmer who hands his farm over to
his son and moves to town to live in a
house bought with borrowed money will

SHAR ADAMS
fail the test. A farmer who lives poor all
his life while planning to sell up and
retire in comfort fears the prospect of
paying capital gains tax on 20 or 30
years of inflation-added value and of in-
vestment representing foregone con-
sumption.
A 1 percent weath tax would incur
annual taxes on the average farm of
about $4OOO.
It would halve the farmer’s income,
to some $BO a week.
Death duties strike at the process of
farm development on behalf of children
a large part of the motivation for
many farmers.
Since farmers are so few, the extent
to which their discontent translates into
lost seats is another matter. Neverthe-
less, whether the ALP can hold Burke,
Flinders, McEwen and the new seat of
Streeton (all in Victoria) must be in
doubt. As well, the result in the
Victorian provincial seats of Ballarat
and Bendigo can be expected to be
close.
The coalition parties must have a
chance of winning Eden-Monaro in
NSW, as well as Riverina-Darling
which was turned from a “coalition”
into an “ALP” seat by the redistribution
which enlarged the House.
Macquarie (NSW), too, could be lost
to the ALP on the assets test and tax on
superannuation.
The coalition parties also have a
chance of winning the new NSW seat of
Gilmore.
Redistribution has changed Hunter,
west of Newcastle, from blue-ribbon
Labor to a seat which the coalition par-
ties could win.
The contest in the NSW rural seats of
Farrer, Hume and Parkes is between
Liberal and National Party candidates.
As a result of the redistribution, both
coalition candidates for Hume are sit-
ting members the Liberals’ Wal Fife
against Steve Lusher.
The older, graver Fife would have to
be a slight favorite but the contest in all
three seats looks comparatively even.
In New England and Richmond
(NSW), respectively, both National
Party leader lan Sinclair and his prede-
cessor Doug Anthony’s heir Richard
Blunt have to work hard but are ex-
pected to get back.
The new seat of Hinkler in Queens-
land should be ALP on the 1983 result
but the Nationals expect to win.
Moncrieff is a contest between retiring
Liberal senator Kathy Martin and the
National Party’s Mrs Judy Gamin. Mar-
tin is favorite.
The rural revolt gives the coalition a
chance in eight rural seats and two
provincials. Redistribution and local
factors give the ALP a chance to redress
the balance in Kennedy, Richmond and
Gilmore. □

POLITICS
On the campaign
trail with
Hawke’s shadow
By DEBORAH HOPE
LIONEL BOWEN is the first to admit
he lives in the shadow of Prime Minister
Bob Hawke.
“If you were making a movie you’d
be mad if you didn’t put the best-look-
ing girl in the lead,” he observed last
week on the R. J. Hawke phenomenon,
accepting that television and image
have taken over where the old soap box
on the pub veranda left off.
As Deputy Prime Minister and Trade
Minister, Lionel Bowen has a public
profile that’s so low it’s almost invisible.
Nowhere is this more evident than on
the campaign trail, where The Bulletin
joined him last week for a day’s hard
slog in Ballarat, the Victorian seat held
by the ALP’s John Mildren since 1980.
Bowen is at his best campaigning,
which he enjoys as a break from the iso-
lation of parliament; it’s the essence of
politicking, a chance to gauge public
opinion. Bowen's services are especially
in demand in Queensland,
where his laconic style, slow
Australian drawl and lack of
pretension go down well over
a barbecue and a beer.
His backstage image was
summed up in a devastating
comment by a textile worker
he met during his visit to a
factory in the electorate. “I’m
glad to meet you,” she said,
“but I only wish you’d
brought that Bob Hawke with
you. He’s gorgeous.”
Bowen’s day in the elector-
ate was studded with similar
utterances, something which
gives him a good many laughs
and recyclable anecdotes. He
concedes there are no issues in
this election, just “R.J.,” as he
refers to him, and Andrew
Peacock. “The deputy’s job is
nothing,” he said. “Someone
has to do it.” There would be
no chance of the deputy party
leaders joining in The Great
Debate.
It’s just as well Bowen has a sense of
humor.
No one I asked during the day could
tell me what portfolio he holds and it
was the exception to hear someone say
they would recognise him on the street.
Lionel Bowen: what you get is what you see
And indeed no one did recognise him
on the street. No waves to his minis-
terial car, no tearful grandmothers or
teenyboppers rushed to greet him.
The most common response about
Bowen was, “He’s not as big as I

thought he would be. He looks much
bigger on television.”
This was a great disappointment to
one voter who said she liked her politi-
cians big, impressive, like Gough
Whitlam. But, I interrupted, Bob
Hawke is small in stature. “That was
different,” she replied. “He’s got charis-
ma.”
Charisma is not really a word you
would attach to Lionel Bowen. Old-
fashioned charm, but not charisma. His
off-the-cuff speeches to receptions and
dinners don’t stir crowds to brave
deeds, but they impress their audience,
who go away thinking, “what a nice
man.”
The day began with a two-hour flight
from Sydney to Ararat, central Victoria,
a farming district that has been shifted
from the blue-ribbon Liberal seat of
Wannon, formerly held by Malcolm
Fraser, to Ballarat in the redistribution,
cutting Mildren’s comfortable 4 percent
swing in half.
The first function on the itinerary
was a reception at the local council
chambers in full country style cups of
tea and Jatz savories, with potted or-
chids for decoration. About 20 local
identities ranging from unionists to
farmers were gathered to meet the new
political order.
“What you see with Lionel Bowen is
what you get,” said Mildren in his ad-
dress to the reception. The problem was
that a lot of people couldn’t see him.
People kept asking which one is the
Deputy Prime Minister. They were still
unaccustomed, they said, to a new set of
politicians.
A chalked up message on a black-
board in the ALP’s Ararat campaign
rooms announced the Deputy Prime
Minister’s visit and invited people to
meet him. A handful straggled over
from the council reception and a few
others were waiting. Earlier in the day,
Bowen had recounted an acecdote
about Hawke’s recent trip to Gladstone
where school children had formed a
guard of honor for his arrival and others
had lined the town’s streets just to catch
a glimpse of him.
Next on the agenda was a walk
through a textile mill where the ma-
chines meant there was too much noise
for conversation in most areas. Again,
np sign of recognition. A flight to Bal-
larat city and an interview with radio
3BA followed. The station’s news editor
bemused Bowen by asking him during
the interview when Ballarat could ex-
pect a visit by the Prime Minister. He
didn’t know.
On the way out the interviewer re-
counted a Great Moment in History.
Bob Hawke had been in Ballarat one
day and had signed his copy of Blanch
D’Alpuget’s biography. The next day he
was leader. Fantastic. There had been
no questions about Bowen’s trade port-
folio or his rather controversial views
on protection.
At the Ballarat railway workshops
many hands were shaken, but they were
accompanied by very few signs of rec-
ognition. “I think I’ve seen him on tele-
vision,” said one after he passed by, but
again no one said they would recognise
him on the street. Not like Hawkey.
“You always seem to see Hawke and
Paul Keating, not Bowen,” said others.
After more interviews it was off to
Timken’s ball bearing plant. A notice
board in the foyer announced The Hon
Lionel Bowen Deputy PM’s visit, but on
a walk through the office few heads were
raised. It was the same in the metal
shop, where for the first time during the
day Bowen looked tired, his suit sagged
in the heat and fumes of the plant. It
was probably just as well the visit took
place at shift change-over when there
were few employees around.
The editor of the Ballarat V/eekly al-
most stumped Bowen with a number of
questions about the government’s inten-
tions on tax rebates for child care costs,
but somehow the whole argument was
turned around to the success of the gov-
ernment and the planned general tax re-
view.
In his own laid-back way, Bowen has
a very convincing line of argument for
those that question the government’s ac-
tivities. The argument is that Australia is
a great little place and a democracy to
boot. We are surrounded by countries
that don’t know much about democracy
and where the chances to be heard and
participate in government are very few.
In other words, you’re bloody lucky to
be here at all.
Bowen used the point to great effect
at a dinner for about 150 McDonald’s
chain operators and suppliers at Ballar-
at’s La Scala restaurant where the host
launched an assault on the federal gov-
ernment’s record of assistance to small
business. Bowen expressed sympathies
with the discouragement of payroll tax
but ran the democracy line hard. It
worked and was followed by a call by
another speaker for a small business
lobby to be formed.
Earlier in the night, over champagne
cocktails, I had been met with “Lionel
who?” when I asked people for their
views on Lionel Bowen. “Oh, is he
here?” was the response. Others were
delighted to find the grey television per-
sonality was actually an affable, charm-
ing and well-informed (if short) man.
He could be your favorite uncle.
The real message of the night, how-
ever, came from the final speaker who
recounted a trip to a McDonald’s sem-
inar in Toronto, Canada, where the
founder of McDonald’s had been
“wheeled onto the stage” to say a few
words. His message was: “I don’t care
what you did last year and I don’t care
what you did this year. Just get out there
and serve it faster and serve it hotter,”
or words to that effect.
They let the Honorable Lionel go at
11.30 pm. Just in time to catch some
sleep, make the 6.30 VIP aircraft flight
to Sydney to prepare for his trip to In-
dia for Indira Gandhi’s funeral. On the
trip back he went over his campaign
itinery with his staff. A large dose of
Queensland’s north is again in store. “I
don’t know why they keep sending me
up there.” Just another day in the life of
the Deputy PM. □


OPINION
The left lags
behind a
bandwagon
Jack Mundey campaigning: Hawke suffers from a kind press and soft policies
During the election campaign, the
mainstream politicians and media com-
mentators have plenty to say. The Bul-
letin has asked a number of prominent
people to express their views, opinions
which might otherwise remain unaired.
The first in this series is JACK
MUNDEY, radical environmentalist,
Sydney City Council alderman and for-
mer New South Wales leader of the
Builders Laborers Federation.
PRIME MINISTER Bbb Hawke’s phil-
osophy can best be described as “prag-
matic conservatism”. It not only has
devastated the main opposition (thus
the Hugh Morgan and John Elliot call
for a more conservative Liberal Party)
but the left, for the time being at least,
also is in disarray.
In a parliamentary sense, since the
downfall of Dr Jim Cairns a decade ago
there has not been one federal politician
who has stood out as a consistent articu-
late voice of the left in the national for-
um.
The Hawke bandwagon has snowed
opposition and won the (previously-
considered) unlikely support of the
most conservative owners of the tightly
controlled media in this country. This
point of a generally favorable treatment
by the media is the most crucial factor
in the consistent high rating of our char-
ismatic Bob. Never before has a Labor
prime minister had such a kind press
and the soft policies of Hawke and his
followers are designed to ensure that the
support is maintained.
A resounding win by the Hawke
forces in these elections would further
strengthen the influence of the right-
wing NSW Australian Labor Party and
ensure that the next Hawke government
is even more right-wing than the present
one.
The Hawke forces have been very
fortunate. Their “liberal” policies, their
conservative stance on foreign policy
questions, have established on the one
hand their credentials not only with the
electorate’s middle ground but also with
part of the right.
Thus, Opposition leader Andrew
Peacock who likes to present himself as
a “progressive” Liberal is being threat-
ened by those to his right in that party.
A big Hawke victory will see enor-
mous pressure on Peacock. At the same
time, the left in the Labor Party is
having very little influence in the
Hawke government. They are scarcely
represented in the cabinet. Even more
serious is the apparent lack of coher-
ence both in their tactics and strategy.
I do not believe that the left in the
ALP has a clear ideological position
right now; it has not recovered from the
drubbing it received at the ALP federal
conference in July.
The Hawke presidential style is new
in Australia and political opponents
both within his party and the Opposi-
tion have not worked out a counter.
Jingoistic performances by our
Prime Minister have been many since
March 1983 .. . Cricket, football,
racing, film awards. And who can forget
his early-morning America’s Cup eu-
phoria all flag-waving and neo-
ockerism at its best.
Republicanism and Reagan are not
dissimilar to Labor and Hawke.
It has been very successful so far but
I doubt very much that it will be viewed
in the same light over the longer course.
The Lange anti-nuclear stance has
infuriated both the United States and
France. Not only are the people of New
Zealand behind Prime Minister David
Lange on the nuclear issue but many
Australians also are drawing compari-
sons between what is considered to be a
brave Lange and a blind US genuflec-
tion by our own Prime Minister.
What the New Zealand Labor Party
has done is to show how supine the Aus-
tralian government is on our foreign
policy matters and how different to the
Whitlam government foreign policies
which in the main were geared toward a
greater degree of genuine indepen-
dence.
Bill Hayden, one of the few genuine-
ly modest ministers in the Hawke cabi-
net, is becoming increasingly pompous
and boring as he faithfully defends the
pro-US position be it in Latin Ameri-
ca, Asia or Europe.
In the long run, the Hawke govern-
ment Achilles heel is going to be its soft
position on the anti-nuclear artd dis-
armament debate.
Elections will come and go but, as
long as humanity remains on the planet,
the nuclear weapons and disarmament
debate will continue to demand a much
higher priority. This applies to all in-
dustrialised countries, not only to the
superpowers.
The weakness of the Nuclear Dis-
armament Party (NDP), as a single-
issue party, could be outweighed by a
public concerned that both Labor and
Liberal have failed miserably to realise
the importance of anti-nuclear and dis-
armament policies.
The NDP was launched almost
spontaneously by a group of concerned
Canberra citizens led by Dr Michael
Denborough.
Insufficient preparatory work was
carried out in the fragmented environ-
ment, disarmament, women’s groups,
etc to ensure that the NDP had a
sufficiently wide base and suitable poli-
cies over a range of issues to attract
voters from the main parties in these
elections. However, if the NDP cam-
paigns well, even allowing for its single
issue character, its senate candidates
Peter Garrett and Jean Melzer could be
successful.
If Hawke wins both the House of
Representatives and the Senate, all pol-
itical observers agree, a considerable
shift to the right will follow.
The Democrats and NDP are the
only hope of preventing such a shift and
of preventing, as well, an even more
blindly US-oriented government.
The diverse but influential disarma-
ment and anti-nuclear movements will
suffer a very severe setback if Hawke

controls the Senate. Thus, these Senate
elections assume even more importance
than usually is the case.
On the industrial front, the prices
and incomes accord has held. Trade
unions are on the defensive. More and
more of them only service those of their
members in work. Unions have failed
lamentably to address themselves to the
structural unemployment problem
which has been with us since the oil cri-
sis of 1973 and, with millions of jobs
evaporating in all the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment countries as new technology is in-
troduced, no one even suggests now-
adays a return to full employment.
Instead, we speak of an “acceptable”
level of unemployment.
Trade unions have lacked creativity.
If the accord is to continue, unions will
have to produce initiatives or their influ-
ence will wane. They cannot forever
dodge their responsibility to the unem-
ployed. Empty rhetoric and tokenism
are all the unemployed receive.
Finally, as an ecologist, I can never
cease to be amazed at the scant atten-
tion which environmentalism receives
at election time. In the past 20 years,
there has been an enormous increase in
the public consciousness. No one be-
lieves that we live on an infinite planet.
Unrenewable resources are being con-
sumed at an alarming rate yet, at elec-
tion time, one would think that every-
thing must be measured in “economic”
terms. May I predict that, sooner rather
than later, political parties will be com-
pelled to speak of a need for a sustain-
able society in which ecological issues
are primary and future generations and
their needs are considered not only
the next three years. □
Matthew Strassburg: being tested by fire in a safe seat
JOHN ELLIOTT
THE CANDIDATES
Tilting at
windmills, for
experience
By WILLA McDONALD
ASPIRING politicians dream of stand-
ing for a safe seat. Few have the
patience and persistence to contest en-
thusiastically a seat with no chance of
winning unless, like Matthew
Strassburg, they are young, ambitious
and in need of political experience.
At 22, Strassburg is one of the
youngest candidates in this election. His
decision to stand as Labor candidate for
Bradfield, a blue-ribbon Liberal seat on
Sydney’s upper-crust North Shore, was
made largely because he had no chance
of winning.
He says: “It allows me more freedom
in that there’s no big expectations on
me; I don’t have to win the seat. It’s
good experience. It’s testing by fire. It’s
in no way punishment. It tests whether
you can organise a campaign, whether
you can organise yourself well and not
make mistakes.
“In a seat where there’s a 4 percent
swing, the chances are you will not get it
but you might get it.”
For Labor to win in Bradfield, a two-
party preferred swing of 20.6 percent is
needed.
Railway stations and supermarkets
are the main targets in Strassburg’s cam-
paign strategy nailing constituents at
peak hour for a chat and distributing
pamphlets. He does not believe that
door-knocking is appropriate in an area
made up overwhelmingly of Liberal
supporters who mostly would regard it
as an intrusion. More ambitious plans
are fettered by the small campaign
budget just over $2OOO.
Strassburg is looking forward to a
difficult campaign hard work, heck-
lers and abuse. He is determined to
learn as much from the experience as
possible.
The decision to stand for pre-selec-
tion was, he says, his own. He would not
discuss the possibility that he is being
groomed by the party for greater things.
“I really wanted to be part of this elec*
tion because it’s going to be a really ex-
citing victory,” he says. “I thought,
‘Why shouldn’t it be me?’; no-one else
stood for pre-selection. I announced my
candidature and left it open for anyone
else to stand but I think they could see I
was going to do a good job. 1 was an
acceptable, competent candidate.”
He made sure he had the support of
party organisers and the rank and file in
his local branch before he announced
his intention to run for office. The
Frenchs Forest branch has about 60
members, of whom he estimates three or
four are under 30 years of age. “The
younger people are moving back into
the city,” he says. “A lot of these people
appeared here in the late 60s and early
70s and joined when Whitlam was
around but their kids aren’t old enough
to join the party.”
Contesting a safe seat can, he says,
benefit the electorate.
The sitting member for Bradfield is
David Connolly.
“The whole concept of a local mem-
ber is that he represents you,” said
Strassburg, swinging into his campaign-
ing mode. “A Safe seat isn’t in any-
body’s interest...
“Out on the hustings, I can find out
and listen to what they are saying and
ask what they think the solutions are. If
it’s a good idea, it’s something the party
can use too.”
When asked for his views on the elec-
tion issues, Strassburg gives the party
line: “What we are looking at is just a
vote of confidence in the Hav/ke gov-
ernment.
“Do you think the Liberals could do
a better job? Very few people would
think so.”
Changes to the taxation system, he
says, will not be those the Liberal Party
claim will be introduced. Side-stepping
the issue of a capital gains tax, he says
that the system must be reformed as a
whole not piecemeal.
Aboriginal land rights receive similar
> treatment. He believes that 90 percent of
i the people will be satisfied with the gov-
: ernment’s planned reforms.
> Describing himself as right-wing,
Strassburg makes clear that he does not

favor extremism but nonetheless be-
lieves passionately in reformist govern-
ment. He cites Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden as successful reformist politi-
cians who put the needs of the commu-
nity before ideology. Hayden, he says, is
a good example of “how to be a success
after everyone has written you off.”
Strassburg denies having heroes (ex-
cept Dr Who) but lists among the
people he admires Julie Sutton, Chris
Lennon and Chris Develin, all party
members who have at various times
contested the NSW seat of Davidson.
Tom Webster, who lost the seat of
Wakehurst at the last state election, and
John Della-Bosca, one of the young or-
ganisers at party headquarters, have
also been strong political influences.
Strassburg’s politics were more rad-
ical a few years ago. Political awareness
and independence of spirit struck early.
Gough Whitlam, a politician Strassburg
admires, was sacked as prime minister
when Strassburg was in first form (year
7) at Sydney Grammar School.
“I had really thick glasses and was
really under-confident and couldn’t
play sport and tended to develop the
academic side more,” Strassburg says.
“I went to the marches. Mum said,
‘Look, I don’t want you to go ...
There’s going to be violence.’ During
the second period (at school) I said I felt
sick and even managed to look sick and
they sent me home and I strode straight
across to the march.”
Another time, a “giant third-former”
noticed Strassburg’s pro-Whitlam badge
pinned to his uniform. He “picked me
up and flung me against a wall, picked
the badge off and said something about
f—ing Whitlam ruining his father.”
The privileged atmosphere of the pri-
vate school did most to shape
Strassburg’s policies. “Equality of op-
portunity seemed to make good sense,”
he says.
He joined the Labor Party when he
was 16 and has found Young Labor a
good forum for learning the nuances of
politics, how to deal with people and
how to keep shtiim a Yiddish word
for knowing when to keep your mouth
shut.
Strassburg’s parents have long been
politically active and were particularly
' so during the Vietnam war years. Orig-
inally from Woodstock in the United
States, they migrated to Australia 14
years ago. His father, who teaches at
Sydney Grammar St Ives Preparatory
School, is active in his union: the Inde-
pendent Teachers’ Association.
His son has union activities of his
own. Between politics and studying for
a combined Arts/Social Work degree at
Sydney University, he is a casual worker
at Luna Park and is on the executive of

The bravest
of the
brave Liberals
By SUSAN MOLLOY
CHRIS GOWING, 22, straight out of
Geelong Grammar and Monash Uni-
versity, is the Liberal Party’s candidate
for the sprawling western industrial and
basically working-class electorate of
Gellibrand. It is the safest Labor seat in
Australia.
Employment and Indus-
trial Relations minister Ralph
Willis has held it since 1972.
In the last election 70.4 per-
cent of first preference votes
went to the Australian Labor
Party, 21 percent to the Lib-
erals and 4 percent to the
Democrats. Gellibrand’s pref-
erence for the ALP beats even
that of the Prime Minister’s
seat of Wills (67.6 percent first
preference votes to Labor in
the last election), the seat of
Sydney (67 percent) and the
seat of Melbourne (63 per-
cent).
According to the ALP na-
tional secretariat in Canberra,
Gellibrand has been Labor
“probably since 1901 actu-
ally,” although the seat was
created in the 1949 redistribu-
tion. It needs a swing of 26.4
percent for Labor to lose.
Such facts do not visibly
perturb Gowing. He says that
he is just happy that he was
asked to stand. He is “out to
win” but so far Gellibrand has
not felt his presence. He has
been working as assistant
manager at his brother’s hotel
in Mount Macedon and last week
moved to his sister’s flat in South Yarra.
Picturesque Mount Macedon and the
more than upper-middle-class South
Yarra are a long way from industrial
Altona, Footscray and Sunshine. Willis
lives in Williamstown, part of the Gel-
librand electorate, which is a mixture of
recently arrived migrants, the old-time
working class and a recent but minor
infusion of actors and directors (Paul
Cox’s latest film, My First Wife, a study
of the breakdown of a middle-class
marriage, was set in Williamstown).
Next week, with less than a month to
the election, Gowing will go door-
knocking in the electorate and distrib-
ute his campaign manifesto. When The
Bulletin spoke to him last week, he had
not yet written it. He hopes to open an
office and is contemplating hiring a
town hall in the area to give a few
speeches. So far, his speeches have been
confined to the Monash University Lib-
eral Club. He said he also understood
the Footscray Technical and Further
Education people wanted him to speak.
“I’m not sure what they’re interested
in,” he said. “I think it’s to do with the
way the education system is.”
He did say he had spoken with
“some individuals” in Gellibrand
through the help of his campaign man-
ager Matt Matich, a local who will stand
for Footscray in next year’s state elec-
tion for the Legislative Council.
Gowing agrees that he is from an up-
per-middle-class background but he
Chris Gowing: not visibly perturbed
DON McPHEDRAN
adds: “I can relate to the workers be-
cause I have washed dishes for months
and as assistant manager I worked in
the bar mainly so I consider myself a
worker in that regard.” When The Bul-
letin met him at the Southern Cross Ho-
tel, he was dressed in a plain grey suit, a
blue tie and brown boots. His mousey
hair is angularly cropped. He has the
occasional drink and does not smoke.
He likes seeing films and reading his
favorite book is Ayn Rand’s The Foun-
tainhead, also a favorite of Malcolm
Fraser. “All those books I had to read at
uni, Jane Austen, Steinbeck . . . they
were so boring. Fancy feeding kiddies
that,” he said.
His father, a former used-car sales-
man, owns Gowing’s Restaurant in East
Melbourne. His parents are separated,
his mother living in Greece. He has an
18-year-old sister and two brothers. His
eldest brother owns The Gowing’s Hotel
in Mount Macedon.
At school, Chris Gowing won
awards for sport and study. He was a
model pupil. At Monash University, he
joined the Young Liberals and studied
History and Politics for his Bachelor of
Arts degree. Next year if he does not
achieve a 26.4 percent swing in Gel-
librand he wants to return to univer-
sity and complete preliminary study for
a master’s degree in History. He would
like to own a small business but does
not yet know exactly what kind.
After university, the only career
which really interested him was
journalism but that has eluded
him so far. He wrote restaur-
ant reviews and football pre-
views for the Toorak Times,
then applied for a graduate
cadetship with the Melbourne
Herald. “They were not very
interested actually,” he said.
“At the time, my brother took
up the hotel so I went up
there. The only career plan I
had was to work for a news-
paper, but now I’m not so in-
terested.”
Recently he told a friend
from university that he would
be interested in politics and
the executive director of the
Liberal Party in Victoria,
Chris Rooke, rang him in
Mount Macedon three weeks
ago and asked would he be in-
terested in standing for Gel-
librand. “I said ‘Yes, I would
be’. Youth does not preclude
someone from standing for
parliament. I had seen what
was happening to small
businesses in the country and
I thought, ‘lf I ever want to
establish a small business, it
would be very difficult under
a Labor government.’ The


way the tax system is ... it seems that,
with each new wave of government
regulation, the free enterprise system is
dying.”
Gowing has identified the issues on
which he will campaign in Gellibrand
the assets test, free enterprise, keeping
the flag as it is.
“I’m glad they asked me to stand,”
he said. “It is not entirely a hopeless
task. If I can convince some people, it
would give Willis a shake. There is
nothing certain about Labor winning in
the main election itself. I am out to win,
put it that way. To be hopest, I don’t
know if I’ll win or not. The Liberal
Party does not have the resources to
support a candidate in depth in a safe
Labor seat but they’ve given me con-
tacts, past candidates. No, I haven’t
contacted them yet. I think the last one
is overseas. But there is enough support
from Liberal Party headquarters to keep
up my morale.
“Just because it is a working-class
area does not mean people will neces-
sarily cast votes for the ALP. Just be-
cause people have traditionally voted
Labor does not mean they will do it
again.” □
POLITICS
Compulsory vote
means few
party members
By DON AITKIN
WHEN launching journalist Laurie
Oakes’ new book on the Australian pol-
itical system, How Will I Vote?, Prime
Minister Bob Hawke called for Austra-
lians to join the political parties even,
if they must, those of the Opposition.
It was no good Australians criticising
the quality of public life if they did
nothing about improving it, Hawke
said. Since parties were at the centre of
the political process, one good way to
make the process better was for more
citizens to become party members.
' Good basic civics stuff and good
political reasoning behind it. Australia
has the highest level of turnout at elec-
tions in a competitive party system in
the world but it has one of the lowest
levels of party membership, if not the
lowest of all.
Making the most generous allow-
ances, somewhere between 250,000 and
300,000 Australians belong to political
parties. That is about 3 percent of the
electorate. The British figure used to be
about 12 percent, though it has fallen in
NSW Labor Party conference: problems in membership representation
recent years. In the Soviet Union, where
there is one party, the proportion is
nonetheless 11 percent.
If 11 percent of Australians were
party members, more than a million of
us would be enrolled. It is hard to be-
lieve that our political system would not
be better for it. What we have is best
described as “representative oligarchy;”
it would be nice to move a little way
toward representative democracy.
Behind Hawke’s call for participa-
tion lies a worry within the Australian
Labor Party, particularly in its centre
right, that it is poorly linked to the elec-
torate and that membership does not
represent its supporters.
A safe national figure for ALP mem-
bership is 50,000. The Liberals probably
have half as many again, the National
Party at least twice as many. It is a biz-
arre picture. The governing party has a
smaller membership than its rivals, yet it
is the party that talks of its historic role
in representing the Australian spirit and
makes much of participation.
It can be argued that membership
means more in the ALP, that a greater
proportion of members work for the
party and that the ALP is hard to get in
to. Members have to be vetted, turn up
to party meetings, put up with some
party discipline. That is true.
On the other hand, the National
Party, the best organised of the Austra-
lian parties (which is not to say much),
has achieved considerable penetration
in some of its electorates with up to one
in 10 of its voters also being party mem-
bers. The National Party lives off its
members, who pay a $2O annual sub-
scription. An income of $2 million or so
is not to be sneezed at.
The larger the membership, the more
likely it is to be representative of the
party’s supporters in the electorate.
Here the ALP has great problems. The
endemic factionalism of the party
means that points of view opposed to
the ruling faction are poorly repre-
sented all levels.
But on the principle that those who
are dissatisfied with the order of things
are more active than those who are con-
tent with it, the left is probably better
represented within the party organisa-
tion than its real presence among Labor
supporters let alone within the elec-
torate would justify. Hence the call
for participation. New members would
be likely to be from the centre and the
right and their influence should quickly
be felt at the higher levels. That is the
theory. But putting it into practice will
have its problems. What are all these
new members going to do once taken on
board?
Compulsory voting in Australia has
for 60 years removed the need for the
parties to get out the vote on election
day, to canvass every household, to do
the dozens of labor-intensive things
with which parties in other countries
have to contend.
So Australian political parties have
small memberships mostly because they
do not need large ones. As a result, the
parties have become career structures
for the politically active. Those already
in the parties do not want hordes of new
members pouring in they would only
disturb existing arrangements.
There was a big influx at the end of
1975 when all parties welcomed thou-
sands of new members disturbed by the
state of public affairs, wanting to do


their bit. Twelve months later most of
them had lost their zeal.
If the Labor Party, in particular,
wished to attract members it would
have to look hard at its organisation
and reshape it to provide a larger role
for rank-and-file members. But, if it did
that, there would be a risk of the left
obtaining even more organisational
power simply because its supporters
cared more about their point of view
than did their opponents.
And if Hawke were really serious
about getting more people into the ALP,
he might consider abandoning compul-
sory voting. That would create a great
need for new members very quickly. □
SPORT
Testing time
arrives
for the coach
THE Australian rugby team the
Wallabies triumphed at the weekend
when they met and beat England, 19-3.
The test result was most important for
coach Alan Jones, a former speechwriter
for prime minister Malcolm Fraser. For,
as Jones explains in this interview with
CHRIS THOWSON which was conduc-
ted just before the match, there is no point
in playing if competitors cannot win the
big ones.
THOWSON: The Times called you “a
very determined Australian gentleman”
and described your rugby philosophy as
“both hairy-chested and high-minded.” Is
this because you eloquently believe that
winning is the most important thing in
sport? And, in this respect, what is the
significance of the game against
England?
JONES: Of course winning is important
but I hope that the high-minded refer-
ence was meant to imply that we look
for other things - like the image of the
game, the image of Australian rugby,
which we seek to defend every time we
wear green and gold, and at the same
time an understanding of the fact that
this is a sport and that means entertain-
ment and adventure.
Sometimes, when one uses “high-
minded,” one may have a double-edged
tilt at you but I would accept that kind
of comment in relation to winning.
The only reason you keep a score is
obviously because winning is im-
portant. You can be as fancy as you like
and as successful as you like in the
minor games but you really have to win
the big ones and that’s true not only in
rugby; it’s true in any international
sport.
It is of no use breaking world records
in the heats of the Olympic 100 metres if
you can’t win the gold medal.
The game against England is the first
exam of four we face (Ireland, Wales
and Scotland follow). There always was
an intense rivalry between England and
Australia, which I described in an inter-
view over here as between the parent
Australian half-back Nick Farr-Jones beats tacklers in the first test
and the child. In some areas, the preco-
cious colonial child has stepped out of
line and has outstripped the parent. I
like to think that the eighth Wallabies
will be able to leave their stamp on
English sport in the same way other
great Australian athletes have done. We
must do that in a way that does justice
and brings dignity to the game and to
the people playing it. Now, for that
reason, England is important but it’s
important because it is the first.
Apparently you have rejected an offer to
stand for parliament because, to quote
you, “I had already given my commitment
to the side here and it would not have
been proper to take it.” At the same time,
you do not make a secret of your political
ambitions. How much of your political
future is at stake on this tour?
I don’t think like that. Orson Welles
said once that it is vulgar to think of
posterity, and I share this view. In rela-
tion to the elections, I simply said that I
was approached to stand and that I had
indicated the willingness to stand if it
did not in any way cut across my com-
mitment to rugby. It was felt that it
would not be proper for me to be over
here while standing for a seat back
home on December 1.
I had, therefore, to choose the tour
because it was the first I have encoun-
tered.
One must have certain ideas and
principles and one must live according
to them. It’s all very well being high-
minded about principles but when the
crunch comes and you cannot live them
out, you are seen as some kind of an
opportunist.
So I am happy to be here ... I think I
have got one of the best rugby teams in
the world and I believe I can prove that.
As to whether my future is tied up with
this tour, that always is for others to
judge and I am quite prepared to stand
by that judgment.
Predecessors at the helm of the
Wallabies have been criticised, one for
being too conservative and another for
being too adventurous. How would you
label your approach?
I don’t agree that Bob Templeton (I
presume) was a conservative in his ap-
proach. His team in 1980-81 here scored
more tries in the tests than the sides they
played against and he was let down by
goal-kicking. His contribution to Aus-
tralian rugby has been absolutely out-
standing. Bob Dwyer brought to it his
sense of adventure and I have said pub-
licly that his contribution and the chal-
lenge that he brought to the way in
which the game is played is also im-
portant.
The best expression to describe my
approach would be a “radical-conserva-
tive.” You have to know what to con

serve from the game and that’s very im-
portant but, at the same time, you have
to be radical enough to know at what
point you have to start breaking new
ground and pushing ahead. Here, for
example, we have to play a different
kind of game from the game we play in
Australia ...
In an interview with the London Standard,
you mentioned that you were regarded by
some as “painfully brash and arrogant”
in the early days of your career. You still
give a faint impression of intellectual ar-
rogance. You seem to be one of those who
does not accept fools gladly and who
would openly say so. If this is so, can I
put it to you that you may not be well
suited for a political career?
I seemed to have been pitchforked
into certain positions where age, I sup-
pose, was an obstacle. There are people
who think that, if you don’t dribble at
the mouth and if you don’t stumble
along with your language, then you are
trying to take the mickey out of some-
body. I am impatient when the argu-
ment is shabby or when people are pre-
tentious or when they pretend an intel-
lectual position which they cannot de-
fend. I don’t really see why I then have
to withdraw graciously and allow some
kind of intellectual sloppiness to win
the day. And, to that extent, I will take
the debate up to people. Whether or not
I am not given to resisting a temptation
to tell people what I think of them,
those who work with me .. . know that I
can be tough but I would also like to
think that I would try to be fair and I
hope that many of my players and
people I have managed would think I
was also very sympathetic.
Let’s end by saying that, between Satur-
day November 3 and Saturday the 10th,
you will probably experience the longest
week in your life. By Saturday evening
next week, you can be two tests up, two
down or even. That could mean, respect-
ively, paradise or hell or ...
What’s the other ... ? I suppose lam
lucky in one way because I never enter-
tain the notion of defeat. I work my
backside off to eliminate any of the vari-
ables that might contribute toward
defeat.
It is no use sitting on the fence and
saying it will be nice to win but, if we
lose, it wouldn’t matter. One has to put
his credibility on the line. What you did
not mention is that we have in between
those two another “test” against the
Midlands, which will comprise most of
the rejected England players.
And it was more than a week: there
are 10 days which started in Cardiff
which involved four games against
Swansea, England, Midlands and Ire-
land which I regard as being the cen-
tral pieces and the focus of this tour. □
THE LAW
Where Justice
Lionel Murphy
goes now
Murphy committee members Nick Bolkus, Michael Tate, Jeanine Haines, Austin Lewis
By RICHARD FARMER
and
ALAN REID
THE LABOR Caucus ballot for the
ministry after the December 1 election
should provide an accurate guide to the
future of Justice Lionel Murphy on the
High Court. Murphy faces the prospect
of resolutions being moved in the par-
liament for his removal from the bench
and he can no longer feel certain of ob-
taining unanimous support from the
Labor Party. ALP Senator Michael Tate
joined with a Liberal and a Democrat
senator last week to produce an adverse
finding on whether Murphy attempted
to influence a court case involving Syd-
ney solicitor Morgan Ryan. Tate’s ac-
tion reversed the finding he had made at
the end of a previous Senate committee
inquiry into the judge’s actions.
A division on party lines would not
have been a comfortable position for
Murphy but considerably better than
the one he is in. As long as the Labor
Party remained solidly behind him,
there was no prospect of a resolution to
remove him passing both the Senate and
the House of Representatives. With the
party divided, that prospect is real.
Just how real will be shown at the
caucus ballot after the election when
Tate is likely to stand for the ministry. A
good vote for Tate, even if he is not
elected, would suggest that there is con-
siderable support for the unexpected
stand he has taken. Members of the left
who remember Murphy fondly as the
last leader of substance the faction had
in the parliament. The right, like the left,
believes that it is close to a mortal sin to
vote with the opposition and even the
rightists’ dislike of Murphy’s politics
when he was Senate leader under
Gough Whitlam is not sufficient for
them to condone Tate’s actions.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke has a
more ambivalent attitude to the ques-
tion of Tate’s (and Murphy’s) future.
Hawke prides himself on his integrity
and hardly can oppose a colleague who
has acted in the way he thought was
proper. Equally, Hawke is known to re-
gard Murphy’s problems as being of his
own making. Some members of the
Centre Left faction have similar views.
For his part, Murphy does not intend
to take lying down any action that may
flow from the adverse finding of Tate’s
committee. In his formal statement
issued after the release of the report,
Murphy said that if the next parliament
wished to deal with the suggestion that
there was misbehaviour sufficient to re-
move him from the High Court he in-
tended “to exercise my rights.”
Among those rights are:
■ To apply to the Senate for per-
mission to appear before it to give evi-
dence on his own behalf evidence
which he refused to put before the Sen-
ate committee because he believed it
was inappropriate for him, as a High
Court judge, to appear as a witness.
■ To appeal to the High Court on the
basis that he had been denied natural
justice under the procedures followed
by the two Senate committees.
According to Murphy’s counsel,
Tom Hughes, QC, in his summing up to
the last Senate committee: “Any partici

pation on Mr Justice Murphy’s part by
testifying before this committee will
create a precedent or would create a
precedent which, in our respectful sub-
mission, should never be tolerated in the
relations between the judiciary and par-
liament.” Though Hughes did not say
so, there is a difference between giving
evidence before a committee and
seeking to make that evidence available
to the full Senate.
The Senate is part of the formal pro-
cedure under which justices of the High
Court “shall not be removed except by
the Governor-General in Council on an
address from both houses of the parlia-
ment in the same session, praying for
such removal on the ground of proved
misbehaviour or incapacity.” □
MEDICINE
Queensland
jumps the gun
on transplants
By DENIS REINHARDT
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED grants in
August of $363,000 for Ipswich baby
Paul McKee and $lBO,OOO for Adelaide
baby Martin van Arend, federal Health
minister Neal Blewett probably had an
inkling of the almost unseemly medical
rush which would ensue to establish
liver transplant facilities in Australian
hospitals.
Hospitals in four state capitals are
vying for the right to pioneer the ex-
tremely complicated liver transplant
surgical and recuperative techniques in
this country and the affair risks be-
coming a federal election issue.
Surgeons involved in the competi-
tion say that Australia can support one
and possibly two liver units.
But, as a seven-member common-
wealth committee headed by Mel-
bourne’s Dr lan Mackay and charged
with the job of recommending siting
wound up its last hearing in Adelaide
this week in time to rush a report to
Blewett by November 16, Queensland
was pressing ahead unilaterally.
The state may open adult and child
liver transplant units at Brisbane’s Prin-
cess Alexandra and Royal Children’s
hospitals by the end of this month. The
first transplant will take place irrespec-
tive of commonwealth funding or pref-
erence, state Health minister Brian
Austin explained to The Bulletin.
The Queensland government’s deter-
mination to press ahead with its own
program is inspired not only by a belief
that a clinical team headed by the Prin-
cess Alexandra’s head of surgery is
technically and proficiently ready but
also that a Labor Party deal has been
struck between Blewett and the
Victorian government.
The pioneering heart transplant fa-
cilities have been located in Sydney and
Queenslanders allege that the deal
would give Melbourne the kudos of
liver transplants.
The northerners say that the Mel-
bourne consortium of the Austin and
Royal Children’s hospitals is less pre-
pared than Brisbane’s institutions.
Victorian Health minister Tom
Roper denied strenuously any sugges-
tion of a deal. “That’s just extraordi-
nary,” a spokesman said.
Austin says the Brisbane team has an
18-month lead. He took the matter be-
fore cabinet a fortnight ago, primarily
to make that point. He is keen, however,
to downplay political aspects.
“These things don’t come about by
way of political decisions; they come
about by way of inclinations. The doc-
tors decide at some stage or another that
they ought to have the expertise to be
able to perform certain procedures.
They then move toward that. Govern-
ments can decide what they like about
setting up clinics and that sort of thing
but unless you have the personnel to do
it the clinic will never operate. All the
Queensland government really did was
approve funding for it.”
Funds had been included in the re-
cent state budget, Austin said.
“We have allocated so far $150,000
for equipment and, if we work on doing
Queensland babies only, the actual cost
of that wouldn’t be exorbitant within
the staff establishment. We can carry it
in our present hospital budget,” Austin
said.
But he is keen to point out that the
Queensland unit would be open to resi-
dents of other states.
Meanwhile, as the federal committee
writes its report, Austin has sent a team
to a British hospital to try to arrive at a
way of costing the program. If neces-
sary, he says, donations such as the
$254,000 contributed by the public will
be canvassed to fund the Queensland
unit. “When the committee were here,
they basically asked the same thing,”
Austin says. “I’ve also had the medical
superintendents at the Princess Alexan-
dra (Dr Russell Strong) over at Cam-
bridge and he brought back some cost-
ings.
“It is very difficult even to compare
costings of different countries. If they
say they are doing the procedures at
around $30,000, unless you know what
the $30,000 includes it is very difficult.
Obviously, the Paul McKee operation
cost a lot more than $30,000.
“Until you do a pilot program it’s
like one of those things ‘how long is a
piece of string?’
“We have now sent two anaesthetists
to the States because Dr Strong felt we
needed some extra expertise in that
area. They should be back in five or six
weeks.
“You can’t tell when the program is

going to start because you’ve got to get a
suitable donor. The advice that Dr
Strong has given me is ‘about six weeks’
if they can get a suitable donor and a
suitable patient. So you really are
talking hypothetically, especially when
you consider how long it took to find a
suitable liver for Paul McKee.
“All I can say is that within six
weeks, if all those things come together
and on the advice that they have given
me, we would be ready to go.”
The Queenslanders have switched
tack to arguing that theirs is more than a
pilot scheme: “As far as we are con-
cerned, we are not doing a pilot pro-
gram we are doing the program. If the
federal government wants to treat it as a
pilot program and give us some assist-
ance for it, then that’s fine.”
At the centre of the Queensland
scheme is Strong, a veteran of 25 trans-
plants at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Centre in the US.
Strong points out that experimental
work on liver transplants has been
under way at the University of Queens-
land for the past decade. Nevertheless,
he is not at all keen to see a medical
bunfight.
“It’s news now but in two years’
time it won’t even get on the back
page,” says Strong laconically.
He is worried that public perception
of the program may be tainted by the 30
percent failure rate, even with improved
surgical techniques and the advent of
the rejection suppressant cyclosporan
drugs. “What worries me is the public
will be let down. The possibility is that
people will die. You have to make the
equation that if they didn’t have the sur-
gery these people would be bound to die
anyway.
“The other thing that must be re-
membered is that getting a liver means
that somebody else must die.”
The Queensland government is to
equip Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s new jet
aircraft with facilities for transporting
human organs to meet the maximum
eight hours implantation deadline.
Austin says: “If you get a map and
fold it on the Queensland border, the tip
of Cape York Peninsula reaches down
to Tasmania. Those who say that
Queensland is not geographically suited
to do it have really lost contact with
today’s modern transport. We are not
talking about horse and buggy days any
more.
“You must have your own aircraft or
one available for charter.
“In Pittsburgh, they use a number of
Lear jets. The cost is astronomical and
the patient pays. This will be a totally
free service here. There will be no right
of private practice.
“In Queensland, it will be incorpor-
ated as part of a free service,” Austin
says. □
INSURANCE
Red faces
when the
boat comes in
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
INVESTIGATIONS OF mystery sink-
ings of insured fishing boats have
involved searches by a mini-submarine
and an underwater robot. Several
disputed cases have wound up in the
courts.
Insurance companies and owners of
the vessels show they are a long way
apart when it comes to paying out mil-
lions of dollars on the high number of
losses in recent years.
When a boat sinks in calm weather it
is described as “sinking in unexplained
circumstances.” The insurers have other
names such as “scuttling.”
Scuttling which is almost impos-
sible to prove in court is believed to
have cost the Australian marine in-
surance industry millions of dollars
over the past five or six years. Normally
it involves opening of seacocks or to
flooding the vessel or setting it alight.
Insurers took heart from a recent but
disputed decision in the South Austra-
lian Marine Court of Inquiry where the
court found that a vessel had been de-
liberately sunk. The owners have ap-
pealed to the Supreme Court.
One cynical fishing vessel insurer,
facing individual claims of $500,000 or
more said: “Unless the master goes
down with the ship, it’s thought to be a
scuttling.” Another said that even if
there were a fatality, it was not beyond
suspicion. Perhaps, he said, the scuttler
did not get off the boat in time.
The Australian fishing industry is de-
pressed and over-populated. For some
fishermen, sinking their boat is a desper-
ate way out if they cannot keep up pay-
ments to the finance company.
The insurance alternative is attrac-
tive when the insured value of a vessel is
as much as twice the market value.
Payouts for 18-20 metre boats can range
from $200,000 to more than $1 million.
Former policeman Ted Jarrat, who
works with the Sydney private inquiry
agency George Askew on underwater
“fishing expeditions,” says that a serious
problem in the fishing industry, particu-
larly in Queensland, is that fishermen
are undercapitalised.
A Department of Primary Industry
economic survey of the north Queens-
land prawning industry over the years
1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80 showed it
failed to return a positive net return on
capital.
Prices have improved since but there
is still over-capacity and low returns.
There appears to be a correlation be-
tween bad fishing seasons and the num-
ber of boat casualties or sinkings.
Fishing vessel insurance has been
disastrous for Australian underwiters
and their agencies. Associated National
Michael McEriane: a “very inquiring proposal form”


A wreck being raised in north Queensland: a crackdown on fraudulent insurance claims
Insurance Co (now part of Mercantile
Mutual Insurance) and Scandia In-
surance Ltd (part of the Carlingford
Australia Insurance Co Ltd) both
dropped fishing vessels after big losses.
Scandia claimed it had been losing
more than $1 million a year. Fishing
vessels were carrying a loss ratio total
payouts to premiums of 190 percent.
Insurers are still covering the boats,
but on stricter terms. Sydney underwrit-
ing agency Mackinnon McErlane
Booker Pty Ltd took on the fishing boat
business two years ago. The agency
“carries the pen for” (or represents) a
number of underwriters including
Lloyds syndicates and manages one of
the biggest portfolios of marine business
in Australia, from cargo ships to
pleasure craft and fishing boats.
Principal shareholder Michael
McErlane says that after early losses,
the agency is beginning to show profits.
In August the agency hired the (mini-
submarine Platypus 1, built, part-owned
and manned by Professor Charles
Phipps of the University of Sydney’s ge-
ology department, to look for a sunken
fishing vessel off Cairns in Queensland.
The professor filmed the boat standing
upright on the ocean floor, at a depth of
nearly 250 metres. Litigation is pending.
The insurer’s latest recruit is a remote
piloted robot called Benthos, which has
been tested to deeper than nine hundred
metres. Pacific Salvage had used the
Benthos, which is electrically powered,
connected to a mother ship by a cable
The mini-submarine Platypus 1
and is worth around $500,000. It can
take photographs. An operator using
video sensors, can control both the
robot and its salvage area.
McErlane plans to use the robot to
check whether a boat can be salvaged
rather than written off. In the case of
one boat, reported sunk in “unex-
plained circumstances,” Mackinnon
McErlane Booker arranged for it to be
refloated and planted squarely on
Cairns wharf.
McErlane and other agencies have
lifted premiums from less than 1 percent
of insured value five years ago, to more
than 5 percent.
“We have also developed a very in-
quiring proposal form,” he says. “It is
designed not only to provide informa-
tion about the insured master’s record at
sea but his ability or otherwise to make
a living out of the boat.”
The proposal carries a special sec-
tion on finance owing on the boat.
There is also a separate declaration by
the master covering personal, medical,
professional and insurance claim his-
tory. After a vessel sinks, the surveyor
makes a hard-eyed technical assessment
of the loss. A special investigator, like
Jarrat, is then flown in.
“His job is to investigate the person
rather than the vessel,” McErlane says.
“He checks the owner’s financial pos-
ition and catch rate against the informa-
tion given in the proposal form.”
Mackinnon McErlane Booker has
recorded about 30 sinkings or total
losses in two years and has litigation
pending in seven. Last month the agen-
cy and its underwriters won a case in the
Queensland Supreme Court.
Mr Justice Macrossan found that the
owner of a boat which had sunk near
Stradbroke Island off Moreton Bay, was
not entitled to a claim of $218,500. □

ABORIGINES
Flight of the sacred stones
Australia's most valuable Aboriginal heritage collection has been spirited out of the
country for safe-keeping. TIM DUNCAN tells how and why the “crown jewels of
national anthropology were removed.
A QANTAS JUMBO jet climbed off a
strip at Sydney Airport in mid-May this
year and made a lazy turn over the
ocean, toward Auckland. Some remark-
ably heavy tea chests were stacked in
the hold. They had come from Adelaide
and the consignment note described
them as “household and personal
effects.” And they were personal effects.
For the chests contained no less than the
sacred heritage of central Australia.
Ten thousand metres above the Tas-
man Sea were the crown jewels of Aus-
tralian Aboriginal anthropholgy the
sacred tjurunga stones of the Aranda
communities, entrusted since the 1930 s
with all proper ceremony to Professor
Ted Strehlow. Strehlow was the contro-
versial father of central Australian
anthropology and, while he lived, cus-
todian of its peoples’ sacred secrets.
The tjurunga were not alone in the
tea chest. Carefully packed with them
were the complete notes on the proven-
ance of each sacred object, comprising
kinship genealogies sometimes going
back well before European contact.
Some of the chests contained film,
shot in color by Strehlow, of ceremonies
that only he was privileged to witness
and which never will be danced again.
There were also sound tapes. The
ceremonies, like the tjurunga, were as-
sociated with songs as well as with
places and responsible mortal guard-
ians.
The hundreds of tjurunga in the chest
each the other-wordly representative
of an individual’s original body borne
in a previous existence were Aborigi-
nal title deeds to central Australia.
They left their ancient land first for
Auckland and then for somewhere else
only a few weeks before the Austra-
lian government enacted its interim
heritage legislation.
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Heritage (Interim Protection)
Act received royal assent on June 25,
after a stormy passage through parlia-
ment. Critics came chiefly from the pas-
toral and mining industries, arguing
that it would give the Minister for Abor-
iginal Affairs draconian powers over
matters affecting conservation and des-
ecration of sacred sites and objects.
The question of the sites took the
spotlight but the new act also would em-
power the minister, upon an application

DI CALDER
by an Aboriginal or group of Aborigi-
nals, to make a declaration containing
provisions for the preservation or pro-
tection of an object. Furthermore, the
act provided that an object should be
taken to be injured or desecrated if
“used or treated in a manner inconsist-
ent with Aboriginal tradition.”
“Aboriginal tradition” is an extreme-
ly loose term.
The heart of the Strehlow collection
left Australia because its owner, Kathy
Strehlow (widow of Ted), and members
of the Strehlow Research Foundation
advising her felt they could no longer
guarantee that the collection would be
maintained safe from political attack.
As they saw it, federal Aboriginal
Affairs minister Clyde Holding soon
would gain powers sufficient for him to
confiscate the collection should he be
convinced to do so by the land rights
industry that combination of jealous
advisors, white lawyers, anthropologists
and politically-motivated bureaucrats.
Rather than risk that activists might
persuade Holding to confiscate the col-
lection in order to return it to some
amorphous “Aboriginal people” and
thus rake in the kudos of some symbolic
victory over the forces of Australian
anthropology, the Strehlow foundation
decided to secure the collection. This
determination required that it leave
Australia.
Much was at stake. The tjurunga,
together with their documentation, still
hold the key to land rights politics in
central Australia. Lawyers and those de-
pendent upon the patronage of land
councils would gain power there by
taking possession. Elders would be un-
able to contradict their authority. But,
in the absence of traditional checks and
controls, political chaos would be likely
to ensue. Uninitiated men might sight
objects denied to them by traditional
right; men from the wrong kinship
groups might take possession of the
wrong tjurunga', men might avail them-
selves of some distantly appropriate
tjurunga but not know how to respect
their newfound secrets. Blood may well
have been spilled. The tjurunga still
command tremendous respect in central
Australia for their assumed supernatu-
ral powers.
In retrospect, the decision to remove
them seems by no means an over-reac-
tion.
Various attempts had been made to
confiscate the collection. Others inclu-
ding the Murray Black Collection of
14,000-year-old Aboriginal remains
housed at Melbourne University, were
suddenly exposed to arbitrary seizure
within months of the export of the
Aranda tjurunga. But the Strehlow col-
lection was even more vulnerable and
even more important politically.
Many lives and many communities
in central Australia faced complete dis-
ruption should Strehlow’s tjurunga fall
into ignorant hands. The foundation
had the tacit support of traditional com-
munities in central Australia in sending
the sacred stones out of the country.
In an interview with The Bulletin ,
foundation chairman John Bannon and
its secretary Barry Lindner explained
what happened.
“We put it into a few tea chests and
uplifted it,” said Bannon, “and then we
took it out of the country. There was
perhaps half-a-tonne of papers, film and
stone and wooden artifacts involved.”
Lindner added: “The secret stones
and wooden artifacts, the slides, the
films and a lot of other documentation
which is relevant to the artifacts - in-
cluding the genealogies they are all
out.”
Bannon and Lindner were aided by a
third party who has preferred not to be
identified. However, he consented to
talk with The Bulletin and explained:
“It’s an extraordinarily easy business to
air-freight stuff all over the world and
at a surprisingly reasonable cost.”
According to Bannon and Lindner,
the collection is quite safe. Asked if they
had put it at risk by sending it overseas,
they replied that it had been at risk in
Australia for political reasons. On bal-
ance, the risk of leaving it in the country
had been acceptable. “It might have
been destroyed or it might have been
denied to scholars or it might simply
have been left to be vandalised or ex-
ploited by various people in some back
shed in Alice Springs,” said Lindner.
So concerned was the foundation
executive that while they packed the
collection up, Bannon and Lindner


watched each end of the Adelaide sub-
urban street in which it was housed.
“We watched the neighbours and
looked for strange cars. This was be-
cause we thought that, with the legisla-
tion soon to be put in place, the collec-
tion was at risk,” said Lindner. “We
drove it to a locale whence it was
whisked to a safe house.” Bannon
added: “After a period of discreet
quiescence, somebody else came and
took it the rest of the way to the airport,
They didn’t know what they were pick-
ing up and we didn’t tell them.”
Bannon is leading the Senate ticket
for the National Party in South Austra-
lia at the forthcoming federal election,
Lindner was manager at the Yalata Ab-
original community in the state from
1960 to 1980. He was forced out of the
Pitjanjatjara lands recently by moves
which he says were prompted by law-
yers connected with the Pitjanjatjara
Land Council.
Bannon and Lindner said that they
had acted with the complete approval of
those Aborigines in central Australia
who could confidently communciate
with the elders in those communities
with a legitimate stake in the affairs of
Keepers of an ancient flame
TED STREHLOW was born at
Hermansburg in central Australia in
1908 and grew up speaking Aranda. His
father had built up the Lutheran
mission there and it served as a refuge
for Aranda people fleeing police bullets
and seeking protection.
Strehlow’s father died after the rigors
of a journey south from Hermansburg
for medical help a journey told in
Strehlow’s classic Journey to Horseshoe
Bend, a Weickhardt Award winner pub-
lished in 1969.
The young Strehlow was sent to
school in Adelaide and stood out as a
superb linguist. He returned to central
Australia in the early 1930 s as a re-
searcher, intending to study Aranda cul-
ture. He arrived at the perfect moment.
Tribal elders soon asked him to record
their ancient culture which they knew
was dying.
It began when Strehlow met Gura
Tjenterrarma in 1933. “He told me he
was the last of the great ceremonial
chiefs of the gura bandicoot centre
known as Ilbalintja,” wrote Strehlow.
“He told me that all the old men of the
tribe had held a conference that morn-
ing and had come to a decision that un-
less someone they could trust assumed
responsibility for the preservation of the
sacred secrets they would all die with
the old men.
Professor Ted Strehlow: the Aranda regarded him as a high ceremonial chief
MILTON WORDLEY
“Gura hastened to explain that
neither he nor any of the other old men
had sons or grandsons responsible
enough to be entrusted with the secrets,
the tjurungas and other objects. He told
me that he and the other old men had
heard about me, where I had been born,
and that I was showing a genuine inter-
est in their culture and that they wanted
me to accept responsibility for their
sacred things.”
From then on and for the rest of his
working life, Strehlow dedicated him-
self to the daunting task of recording as
much as one man could. His collection
of tjurunga grew year by year and he
documented each, relating it to a place,
a people and a song. One result was two
classics of Australian anthropology,
Aranda Traditions and Songs of Central
Australia. As time went on, Strehlow
himself became regarded as an ingkata
the highest ceremonial chief for his
knowledge of the myths, the kinship
systems and the geography of central
Australia was unsurpassed.
Perhaps because of his unique re-
sponsibility and the precise detail of his
knowledge, Strehlow stubbornly
refused to accept that Aboriginals as a
people had rights to land. Rather, as he
saw it, some Aboriginal individuals had
rights to land and the mythology and
symbols associated with particular
places. Any generality of claims, he
thought, would simply legitimise
usurpers and cause more trouble than it
was worth.
When Ted Strehlow died, the
Strehlow Research Foundation now
with his widow and research assistant
Kathy carried on the responsibility
for the preservation of central Austra-
lian Aboriginal culture. The list of the
foundation’s non-executive fellows is
. impressive. It includes both Mary and
| Elizabeth Durack and Professor

; anthropologist from Oxford University

When the office manager asked my
recommendation on new electronic typewriters
to replace our old electric models
I called up several of the better
known brands and arranged
demonstrations. I took the
comparison seriously-
typewriters are a high
cost item, and if I have to

say that Sharp impressed me most, for features, touch,
and a built-in understanding of what today's

important part of it. The office manager

the foundation. “After the action was
taken, it was decided that the Aborigi-
nals should be told,” Lindner said.
He flew to Alice Springs and there
met the Aboriginal representatives on
the foundation Bob Liddell,
Helmut Pareorultja and Rose
Kunoth-Monks.
Pareorultja is one of the elders of the
western Aranda people.
Kunoth-Monks is well known
around Alice Springs. She played the
title role in the film Jedda in her youth.
“There was a spontaneous ex-
pression of thankfulness and relief
when they were told that the action had
been taken and that the collection had
left the country,” Lindner said.
The explanation for the relief relates
to attempts, allegedly made on behalf of
the traditional communities but without
the consent of the community elders
involved, to have the tjurunga in the
Strehlow collection “returned to Abor-
iginal people.”
In 1977, Neville Perkins, a close rela-
tive of federal Aboriginal Affairs de-
partment secretary Charles Perkins,
made a play for the collection on the
grounds that Ted Strehlow then alive
had acquired it improperly and was
holding it improperly. The attempt
failed. No traditional Aranda elder
would back such a claim. The only rec-
ollection of the elders of the tjurunga in
Strehlow’s care concerned the handing-
over ceremonies in which their fathers
and grandfathers had taken part. As
they saw it, the tjurunga were specifical-
ly entrusted to Strehlow because he
an Aranda speaker, born in
Hermannsburg near Alice Springs
was the only individual upon whom
they could count to care for the stones
properly, to document their songs and
to conserve them for posterity.
At about the time that Neville
Perkins’ attempt to gain control of the
tjurunga failed, Phillip Toyne then
embarking on a career as a white land
rights lawyer was instrumental in
having censored the life work of anthro-
pologist Dr C. P. Mountford. It was ar-
gued that photographs in Mountford’s
Nomads of the Australian Desert were
sacreligious, although for anthropol-
ogists to publish pictorial representa-
tions of their work had been standard
practice. Later, anthropologist Daniel
Vachon was instrumental in preventing
the sale of some of Mountford’s slides.
Toyne and Vachon have felt them-
selves free to publish their own version
of contemporary Aboriginal reality, a
work promoting the cause of the land
councils of central Australia and those
who advise them.
Despite its matchless documentation
of Aboriginal associations with places,
myths and sacred objects, the Strehlow
collection remained unexplored by re-
searchers putting together ideas of how
the administration of Aboriginal lands
should operate.
Strehlow had opposed the idea of
representative land councils, on the
grounds that these had no basis in Abor-
iginal tradition. His view was that those
with legitimate claims to land were
those with legitimate claims to the
tjurunga associated with any particular
place and that these claims for the most
part could never be verified since the
tjurunga associations except for those
he had documented and preserved had
died with their traditional owners and
not been passed on. This view became
increasingly unfashionable as the land
rights movement gathered strength,
Strehlow became increasingly isolated,
Strehlow was a prickly character, by
all accounts, uncompromising in his
views and with a wealth of unfashion-
able things to say. He fell out with uni-
versity colleagues and with museum ad-
ministrators. After the attempt by
Perkins to get the collection, it remained
in Adelaide increasingly vulnerable
and coveted by those who knew little of
its significance for the older generation
still living in central Australia,

stark reminder that it was possible virtu-
ally to declare the Strehlow founda-
tion’s scholarly activities “sacreligious,”
the next attack was only a matter of
time.
In 1982, a flight of 15 “elders” to
Adelaide was organised to try to gain
access to the collection through the
South Australian Supreme Court.
Such access could have enabled
copying of particular tjurunga to gain
either land or influence simply on the
basis of what had been seen, rather than
on the basis of traditional entitlement.
And there would have been a high prob-
ability of tjurunga being seen by the
wrong people. According to lore, this
not only would put at risk the lives of
the wrongful viewers but also lives of
those related to them who were going
about their normal business in central
Australia unknowing of the activities in
Adelaide. Aboriginals see retribution
for transgressing sacred traditions as
not limited to the actual perpetrator.
Satisfaction may be obtained by acting
against a relative.
In any event, the attempt failed.
Gary Stoll, superintendent of the Finke
River mission in Alice Springs who at-
tended the court hearing, told The Bul-
letin that the elders had not been told
why they were going to Adelaide and
that some of them had been supplied
with alcohol to get them on the plane.
When they realised what was going on,
he said, many became plainly terrified
that they had dipped their toes into ex-
tremely dangerous supernatural waters.
Stoll said that, on return, the men
were subjected to an intense grilling by
angry elders who charged them with
putting at risk entire communities.
Liddell told The Bulletin that two of
those men had died within three months
of the episode.
“I got involved with all this when I
found that the traditional owners did
not want the tjurunga back,” Liddell
said. “Under strict Aboriginal law, the
tjurunga were given to Strehlow en-
trusted to him and he was the sole
owner. When I talked with the people in
the field, they said, ‘Oh, no, we don’t
want it because it’s all dangerous stuff’
They were quite fearful out in
Hermannsburg and places like that.
“See, under traditional law, you can’t
talk about anybody’s land or traditional
objects without knowing the stories
' otherwise you die. They don’t Tcnow the
stories anymore, because their fathers
and grandfathers gave them to
Strehlow.”
Liddell adds: “Every tjurunga in the
Strehlow foundation has a story at-
tached to it. But, if you bring them back
here, no one knows anything about
them and they fear that they may die in
droves. That’s the way it is.”
Then Holding’s legislation loomed.
Oscar Namatjira: his people would not know what to do with tjurunga
“The minister could quite easily have
come along and confiscated all the ma-
terial, which would have been disas-
trous if the tjurunga had got into the
wrong hands and people had brought
them back to Alice Springs without
proper authority,” Liddell said. “It
could have caused all sorts of problems
within the communities. People would
have died. And that’s what those bu-
reaucrats and those other trendies
around the place were not aware of.”
The threat to Strehlow’s published
works and especially to the 20,000 feet
of film and the hundreds of slides would
come, after precedents set by Toyne and
Vachon over the Mountford material,
once the foundation attempted to get
images of its treasures to a wider Aus-
tralian public. But there was more evi-
dence of what could be in store.
“I had a meeting with Charlie
Perkins,” Bannon said. “He told me I
knew nothing about Aboriginal affairs
and was very hostile and belligerent.
During the conversation, the Strehlow
matter emerged. He expressed the idea
that the Interim Heritage Bill would
take care of that. The message was
clear.”
Liddell and Pereorultja acted as links
between Bannon and Lindner and the
communities whose relatives had en-
trusted Strehlow with their heritage.
“We just left it to Bannon,” said
Liddell. “‘Whatever you do to get it
away from the hands of people who
have a vested interest, well, we’ll stand
by that’ ... The people out there said
that. They just said to me ‘You do what
you do’ and I said ‘Well, I’ll just leave it
in the chairman’s hands.’
‘We said to them that all we could do
was to get rid of a lot of stuff and hide it
somewhere.”
At Hermannsburg, the message was
clear also. Gus Ntjalka Williams, presi-
dent of the Ntaria Council which ad-
ministers the former Lutheran mission,
told The Bulletin that in his understand-
ing the elders were adamant that the
tjurunga given to Strehlow should stay
where they are safe. A grandson of
Johannes Ntjalka, one of Strehlow’s
most valued informants, Williams
chuckled that people at Hermannsburg
now were more interested in videos than
in sacred stones.
Respected elders confirmed Wil-
liams’ impression. “The tjurunga be-
longed to Strehlow,” Salamo
Renkaraka said. “We can’t take them
back. It would break an agreement be-
tween Strehlow and the old people.
They should stay with his kin.”
“Now we don’t know how to use it.
We don’t know all that, ” added Oscar
Namatjira, son of the artist Albert.
“Someone would pick up the wrong
one. Someone will say, ‘You took the
wrong one; you’ll die’,” said
Renkaraka. Cyril Motna agreed: “If the


young people got them, they’d be fight-
ing and killing each other.”
In the right circumstances, Liddell
would like to see the foundation formal-
ly established in the Northern Territory
where it really belongs. But this would
require extensive work on genealogies
to establish which people might by tra-
dition have legitimate access to the
tjurunga of certain places and the songs
associated with them. More likely,
thinks Liddell, those with legitimate
claims for specific tjurunga would not
make them having no quarrel with the
tjurunga being in the collection in the
first place.
Liddell, Bannon and Lindner say
that the sensible solution is to see the
collection as a repository for scholars
the world over and to use its films and
slides for the education of the Austra-
lian public with proper consultation
with any remaining elders who still
know what is sacred and why. Such a
prospect may be some years away,
It is not a comfortable thought but it
seems that Australia is not safe enough
for the sacred stones of the Aranda
people. So, for the time being, the
tjurunga are in exile. □
The man who took to the stepping-stones
808 LIDDELL is a remarkable man.
Born in the Alice Springs area, son of
an Alluywarra woman from the north-
east and a man who was part Scot and
part Aranda, Liddell sees life as series of
stepping-stones.
The eldest of six, he completed the
Leaving Certificate at Alice Springs and
then went to Melbourne as an 18-year-
old. He worked first as a linesman for
the State Electricity Commission but, in
the late 19505, boxing was the obvious
stepping-stone for fit young Aborigines.
Liddell was an extremely good fighter
who had 60 professional bouts.
In the early 70s, the bureaucracy
took a greater interest in Aboriginal
affairs. Back in Alice Springs, Liddell
found himself working with Charles
Perkins as one of the three senior liaison
officers in the Department of Aboriginal
Affairs. He became involved in the land
rights issue. He founded the Central
Australia Aboriginal Congress and be-
came its president from 1973.
As land rights legislation was put in
place he began to have some doubts: “I
was finding it hard to talk to people in
Alice Springs that I had gone to school
with. I organised a visit of A 1 Grassby
(ethnic affairs watchdog) here and I
found to my surprise that he was not
DI CALDER
Bob Liddell: another side to the land rights story
that radical . . . Until then I didn’t re-
alise that there was another side to the
story. I was inside the land rights bubble
and one day I pricked it.”
Liddell was removed from his new
position of director of the congress in
1978. The first step out was a job with
Aboriginal hostels as regional general
manager. “I used (the department) the
congress and the hostels as separate
stepping-stones,” he said.
In 1979, Magellan Petroleum offered
Liddell the unenviable task of organ-
ising liaison with Aboriginal communi-
ties affected by the oil and gas develop-
ment in the Mereenie, Palm Valley and
Amadeus Basin fields. He was spectacu-
larly successful.
“After I joined Magellan, I had an
arrangement sorted out with the tra-
ditional owners within 10 months,” he
says. A recognised troubleshooter, he
became in demand by companies fear-
ful of becoming hopelessly frustrated by
land rights negotiations.
“I read a lot. I study things and I
think carefully about them. I watch the
other executives, to see how they oper-
ate to see what I can pick up.”
Liddell has boldly identified himself
with the development of the Northern
Territory. He stood last year as the
Country Liberal candidate for a safe
Labor seat.
He is vice-chairman of the Country
Liberal Party central Australian branch
and recently was elected first Aboriginal
alderman on the Alice Springs City
Council.
Even more significant, he says, is his
recent appointment to the Aboriginal
affairs policy committee of the Austra-
lian Petroleum Exploration Association
the first such position occupied by an
Aborigine.
Liddell is doing extremely well but
he has no illusions: “Everybody likes
a winner. When you win, nobody can
get into the dressing-room. But when
you lose there’s just you and your
trainer.” □

HUMOR
Adrift on an
uncertain
economic sea
The floor of the Sydney Stock Exchange: what hope have the innocents
By ROBERT MAKIM
THE SOCIALIST cause in Australia
seems to be lost. Not only has the
dreaded “Socialist” Labor Government
set off on a course slightly to the right of
Ronald Reagan’s, but what with lump
sum retirement benefits, redundancy al-
lowances and a steady stream of win-
ners of lotteries, pools and lottos, the
nation is awash with petty capitalists.
Talk among retirees is no longer
about where the fish are biting or who
will win the footy, but is heavy with ref-
erence to capital gains, cash trusts,
property trusts, mortgage trusts, stocks,
shares, superannuation units and de-
bentures.
Cash is not to be left uninvested for
five minutes. Investment advisers are
thick on the ground, and we’re on the
way to becoming a race of greedy bores.
Who can forget those TV seminars
when a Mr Bond, (not the one from
Western Australia; he is too busy
making money to lecture other people
on how to do it), would pace up and
down, stick in hand like a school-
teacher, before serried rows of eager, al-
most slavering get-richers.
Cast suddenly adrift in this econ-
omic sea thick with sharks and shoals,
we innocents have had to come to terms
with all kinds of weird expressions pre-
viously the private domain of finance
experts and members of the leading
families. “All Ords are down again,” a
morose individual said to me at the RSL
club recently, clearly looking upon me
with my hallmarks of retirement (white
mo, white sideburns, red hooter and
studied casual dress), as being a person
knowledgeable in such matters. My
mind feverishly cast about. What on
earth was he talking about? Then I hit
on it. Of course; his wife was named
Audrey and he was suffering an inva-
sion of in-laws.
“What, the lot of them?” I replied
sympathetically. “Poor old Aud. How
long are they down for?” He looked at
me in some surprise, angrily muttered
something about me being a smart alec,
and stalked off looking back indignant-
ly over his shoulder.
Later I found out what “All Ords”
are, and in the process I came upon the
American equivalent, the crazily named
Dow Jones index. Armed with this piece
of economic erudition, I repaired once
more to the RSL club.
“Dow Jones is down again,” I an-
nounced solemnly to a chap who looked
appropriate. “That’s three days in a
row.” Unfortunately, I had chosen as
my confidant a fellow who, as it later
turned out, had some reputation as the
Club wit. “Don’t worry, old chap,” he
replied. “Welsh miners are like that.”
I told him not to be a smart alec and
went off to find somebody more serious
in outlook. I found a retired grazier
who, having sold his property, was re-
puted to have scads of money invested
in all sorts of bonds, trusts, shares and
things.
“I see Dow Jones is down again,” I
said, looking suitably serious. “That’s
three days in a row!”
“That’s bad news,” he replied, “But I
don’t play the stock market anymore. I
concentrate on Dingos. It’s the multi-
plying factor.”
I looked at him blankly. There
seemed to be a non sequitur here. Then
I twigged. Having been a man on the
land, he would be relating matters of
finance to natural phenomena.
“Blow me down,” I sympathised in
what I thought to be suitably rural
terms. “Poor bloody farmer; no sooner
does he get the mice beaten than the
bloody dingos start multiplying.”
“Very funny,” he replied sourly.
“Now if you’ll excuse me ...,” and off
he went with all the eagerness of a social
climber who has just seen somebody
much more socially acceptable on the
other side of the room.
Wrong again. I found out later that
Dingos are bonds of some kind or other.
While on the question of native ani-
mals, however, there is one piece of in-
formation which I know for a fact to be
right. Although our new dollar coins
show on the reverse side what look like
a row of euros hopping around in a
circle, they are not, in fact, Eurodollars.
Eurodollars, it seems, are part of the
currency-trading business in which
sharp characters all around the world
use their currencies to buy and sell, not
goods and services as one would have
thought, but the currencies of other
countries.
To do this profitably, they consistent-
ly have to back the winners in the great
Olympic Currency Games, and our dol-
lar is right in there, slugging it out with
the best of them.
“Dollar holds ground,” scream the
newspaper headlines, or “Dollar yields
to US dollar pressure,” or sometimes,
unlike our Los Angeles experience,
“Dollar surges ahead of US dollar.”
Difficult as all these goings-on may
be to understand, they are as nothing
compared to the intricacies involved in
measuring the money supply.
One would have thought that ex-
pressions like Ml, M 3 and M 6 referred
to expressways, or probably foreign
secret service agencies. Wrong again! It
seems that they, together with MO and
BM, are measurements of the amount of
money loose in the community.
Here, at last, I find myself in a pos-
ition of power. I have two of the new
dollar coins on which the Queen ap-
pears to have a slight case of acne on the
right cheek tucked away at the back of a
drawer and I have not told the Reserve
Bank or the Treasury about them.
I hug myself with secret glee. If they
are not taken into account in estimating
Ml, this will throw M 3 out, and this in
turn will affect MO, M 6 and eventually
BM, interest rates, and the value of the
Australian dollar in relation to a basket
of foreign currencies.
So, soar while you can, you high-fly-
ing usurers and money-changers! If the
Lord does not return and throw you out
of the temples of finance, I shall bring
you down with my two tiny blemished
dollar coins. □

AVIATION
Safety in the
air - a new
point of view
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
THE ORTHODOXY of aviation safety,
that regulation prevents accidents and
more regulation makes flying even
safer, is beginning to come under in-
creasing attack internationally.
Three internationally known experts
have chosen Australian venues to
preach the new doctrine that authorities
such as Australia’s Department of Avi-
ation may have done all they
can do in accident prevention
and that radical new ap-
proaches are needed.
The papers, generating
worldwide debate, go as far as
to point out that extra regula-
tion may be counter-produc-
tive. The suggestions put for-
ward include a closer under-
standing of human relations
and communications in the
cockpit and the realisation
that heading the doubts of the
lowly engineer on the hangar
floor may be the key to re-
ducing accidents.
vAll the seminars freely ac-
knowledge the major part that
orthodox regulation has
played in safety. This has in-
cluded establishment of air-
worthiness and performance
standards in certification of
passenger aircraft and control of crew
matters such as hours of duty and rest.
But the big reductions in the number
of accidents which marked aviation
through to the era of the big jets in the
mid-70s have ended in recent years.
Safety statistics are on a plateau.
Dr Dick Shaw, an Australian engin-
eer who is assistant director-general
(technical) of the International Air
Transport Association, was the first to
suggest a need for alternatives.
Shaw operates on the world scene
from the International Air Transport
Association’s technical headquarters in
Montreal, Canada.
Shaw chose Australia’s most import-
ant aviation occasion, the Kingsford-
Smith memorial lecture to the Royal
Aeronautical Society, to analyse airline
safety. His thesis is that the regulatory
approach to airline safety in effect,
official “thou shalt nots” was remark-
ably effective in drastically reducing the
incidence of accidents as civil aviation
grew at a tremendous rate and matured
as an industry.
The theory behind the requirements
which specified such matters as
maintenance, aircraft performance in
the event of engine failure, operational
minima and flight-crew hours of duty,
lay in “elegant” mathematical extrapol-
ations of then-limited operational data.
By 1984, Shaw argued, the body of
jet operational Experience had grown to
some 200 million flights spanning 220
million flying hours which now pro-
vided a statistically significant base for
analysis of accidents.
He cited as an example an analysis
of 120 of the 140 accidents occurring
between 1973 and 1982 resulting in
“hull losses” (the writing-off of an air-
craft after an accident) for which data
are available.
The causes of most of these are
Dick Shaw: human factors account for 35 percent of accidents
STUART SPENCE
shown in the accompanying table.
Setting aside the first 23 caused
either by inadequate facilities or cutting
corners already specified either in inter-
national regulations or recognised oper-
ational procedures and the eight due
to hostile action, the remainder do not
lend themselves to solution by fiat.
Noting that, while airline accident
rates had decreased, they still occurred
although the curve was flattening out
Shaw called for a new approach to
safety management. He cited the action
to counter “windshear” incidents as a
multi-disciplinary, multi-agency meth-
od that pointed the way to further im-
provement.
Joint airport weather studies in the
United States had established a
database on the “microbursts” which
cause such accidents. The program had
shown that a new form of airport radar
using doppler techniques (which
measure speed differences as police
radar traps do) could detect the phe-
nomenon so warnings could be issued.
Aircraft simulators had helped ex-
plore ways of flying out of microbursts,
which called for radically different tech-
niques from those to which pilots were
accustomed.
Shaw said: “I am happy to say that,
since preparing this paper, there have
been two cases at Denver where pilots
have rescued their aircraft from
microbursts in circumstances which
previously may have resulted in acci-
dents.”
He called for attention to be focused
on “human factors” which, he said,
once were pejoratively called “pilot er-
ror.” They accounted for 35 percent of
accidents by official count (and prob-
ably more in the belief of safety investi-
gators).
Such factors included confusing in-
struments, possible health problems and
even the relationship between
individuals on a flight deck
particularly when a junior
pilot notes that his captain has
made an error.
The second attempt to get
to grips with the persistent ac-
cident rate came at Surfers
Paradise at a seminar or-
ganised by Ansett Airlines.
The speaker was Michael
Ramsden, editor-in-chief of
Flight International, who has
kept the problems of civil and
military safety in the forefront
of public attention.
Ramsden looked at the
causes of major jet accidents
over the past 10 years and
concluded that many could be
traced back to maintenance or
ground-based faults.
He suggested a need for in-
dividual engineers on a no-
blame, no-fault basis to note proce-
dures which may seem to them to be
wrong or to report mechanical prob-
lems which could recur in operation in
other airlines and lead to accidents.
“Incidents are often thought to be
isolated, the result of someone’s care-
lessness,” Ramsden said. “This is not al-
ways so. When an accident happens and
an investigation takes place, it is sur-
prising how many other such incidents
have occurred.”
In the general debate that followed
his paper, Ramsden agreed with Shaw’s
thesis that human relations require to be
watched much more carefully and that
regulation for the sake of regulation
could cause more problems than it
might solve.
This week at an air controllers’ con-
ference in Surfers Paradise, Sydney’s
Dick Smith whose round-the-world
helicopter feat has won him internation-
al respect was due to make an even
sharper attack on the philosophy of
regulation.
His prepared paper included an at

tack on Australia’s Department of Avi-
ation as exhibiting “mental attitudes set
in concrete” when it came to recognis-
ing the changes that have occurred in
aviation in recent years and, in particu-
lar, the great increase in the number of
helicopters.
Australia, he said, was the only
country which still confined helicopters
to the flight paths of fixed-wing aircraft.
Smith has already fiercely attacked
the department on search and rescue
procedures and sponsored a Four Cor-
ners television analysis of the slow re-
sponse to an aircraft ditching in Bass
Strait which led the department to re-
vise procedures. □
What to do
when the
‘tiger’ pounces
CLOSE TO THE ground, windshear be-
comes the claws of the tiger of danger
that good pilots must assume is always
ready to pounce.
Some accidents at take-off and on
landing were put down for years to pilot
error whereas, after a series of such inci-
dents in the United States, experts
linked them with unstable atmospheric
conditions such as thunderstorms or
passage of a violent weather front.
These observations led to the discov-
ery of microbursts sudden, savage
bursts of wind that can wreak severe
damage on the ground and also can and
do cause big jet aircraft to crash. They
are not willy-willies or “twisters,” which
also have to be avoided because of their
destructive violence but which can be
easily seen.
In a way, they are the reverse.
When a thunderhead or a frontal
condition causes large amounts of warm
air to rise, the air cools and loses its
moisture and pounds out of the sky in
the burst of energy like the blow of a
sledgehammer. Typically, only a small
area is affected sometimes less than a

Northern Australia’s “morning glory” cloud: death in the sky
kilometre in diameter. The maximum is
usually around 3km but it has been
known to go to about skm.
This is roughly the area of an airport.
On the ground and to the distance of
100 to 200 m above it, microbursts can
lead to a reversal in wind direction over
the length of a typical 2.5 km airport
runway. The difference in wind speed
relative to an aircraft passing through,
has often been measured at around
150km/hour.
The example shown in the diagram
on page 74 is of a passenger jet on
take-off but the problem also exists on
landing.
In the first stage, while very close to
the ground, the pilot experiences a
strong headwind which gives ac-
celerated lift. As the aircraft moves
through the microburst, the headwind
suddenly becomes a downdraught and
the aircraft plummets.
The pilot’s natural reaction to this is
to put the nose down to pick up speed
and build up lift. The aircraft moves
within seconds into the tailwind stage
where airspeed (and, hence, lift) falls off
when the plane is nose down and
dangerously close to the ground. A
crash results.
The new procedure calls for pilots to
be made aware of the probability of
microbursts and to recognise the phe-
nomenon when it occurs. The pilot is
taught to apply maximum power, even
beyond the normal operational limits of
his engines, and to haul the nose up.
Although the plane will be fighting
for lift in the downdraught and tailwind
part of the cycle, it will probably remain
airborne until it re-enters stable condi-
tions and can climb out normally, under
the control of a shaken but wiser crew.
Microbursts, associated with thun-
derstorms, have also been observed in
Australia. But another phenomenon,
the solitary wave, is much more com-
mon and is beginning to worry meteor-
ologists and pilots.
The waves are induced by the flow of
air over the Australian land mass. They
can be up to 500 km long and the dis-
turbed air might occupy an area of
40km across.
Sometimes the wave is visible be-
cause it generates cloud. The classical
instance is the “morning glory” cloud of
the Queensland and Northern Territory
Gulf Country, which is a daily occur-
rence at this time of the year. More
often, however, the wave is invisible and
is discovered when an aircraft pen-
etrates the disturbed air and is tossed
around.
Like microwaves, the solitary wave
can generate severe disturbances close
to the ground.
Canberra scientists Don Christie and
K. J. Muirhead have made an intense
study of the phenomena and say that
solitary waves may be the cause of pre-
viously unexplained accidents. They
will publish their warnings in the Aus-
tralian Aviation Safety Digest. □

VICTORIA
Marvellous
Melbourne
preens again
By SUSAN MOLLOY
STRANGE scenes are unfolding in
Melbourne. Victoria’s 150th an-
niversary is approaching and the state
capital is under threat of being fes-
tooned with streamers and lit by laser
beams while the after-shock is still
reverberating from last week’s opening
of the Victorian Arts Centre, after more
than 40 years on the drawing-board,
which induced much public handclapp-
ing and a deluge of local newspaper
ecstasy.
An orgy of self-congratulation is
gripping the city.
Everyone from Premier John Cain
down is speaking of an immigration of
ex-Melburnians and Sydney types to the
Garden State. Arts minister Race
Mathews predicts that Melbourne will
“once more be truly marvellous.”
Accompanied by a snipe at the
Australian Council for freezing and
cutting money to arts bodies, the
Victorian ministry for the Arts last week
announced an 11.3 percent increase in
funds for 1985 to big and small arts
groups. The Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany, miffed by a 20 percent cut in
federal funding, will get an extra
$lOO,OOO to take its state grant for next
year to $675,000. The Victorian State
Opera will get $1 million, a rise of
almost 18 percent on last year.
Performers from the Victorian
Highland Pipe Band Association to
next September’s Spoleto International
Arts Festival got a slice of the $6.5
million arts pie.
The past few weeks have seen a flurry
of Victorian-centred book launchings, a
boost in funding to Film Victoria
(which is publicly jubilant that Vic-
torian films carried off so many honors
at the Australian Film Institute awards),
the much-publicised move from Sydney
to Melbourne of the institute and the
greatest shindig of them all the official
opening of the Arts Centre.
The 3500 guests for the opening were
first served culture. Inside the massive
State Theatre, the Australian Ballet
performed The Sleeping Beauty. The
Playbox Theatre offered The
Removalists in the studio and the
Melbourne Theatre Company per-
formed The Threepenny Opera.
Then, wham! in the State, the
scenery flew to the roof and the glitter
poured down and the audiences from
the Studio and Playhouse danced onto


the stage and the speeches began and
the applause grew fierce.
“Tonight,” Mathews declared.
“Melbourne re-instates itself tri-
umphantly in its rightful place as the
arts capital of Australia.” Applause.
Ken Myer, chairman of the Arts Centre
Trust, thanked everyone. Applause.
Cain spoke of “this great arts centre.”
Much applause. The 300,000 flowers
dripping from balconies and in foyers
began to wilt as thousands of people
scrabbled down to the stage and danced
to the Graeme Lyall orchestra if they
could find room. Fifteen overseas jour-
nalists joined in the party.
The Bulletin’s John Cargher last year
declared it a pity that the outside of
Australia’s great opera house had been
built in Sydney and the inside in
Melbourne. The magnificently opulent
interiors of the mainly underground
and certainly labyrinthine centre now
also boast an art collection the envy of
the National Gallery next-door.
Melbourne, said centre general man-
ager George Fairfax, would not be able
to cope with a sculpture symbol such as
the Sydney Opera House. “The Arts
Centre has been built on one of the
great boulevardes of the world (St Kilda
Road), close to the city, close to public
transport, on absolute hectares of gar-
den by a river which gets knocked right
left and centre. I see us as a very
fortunate community.
“I believe Melbourne was the capital
of the arts.
“Some of the initiative in the last
decade was snatched away from us but I
believe that the activities in this building
alone will make those initiatives happen
again.
“There is a danger of the Arts Centre
having a Hoover effect. We are not here
to swamp everyone else. To some
degree, we are newcomers. We must
work in co-operation.”
Acting as promoters, venue
operators, entreprenuers, investors and
sometimes producers, the centre boasts
hundreds of sponsors. The annual
budget is around $l9 million.
“Without forgetting that our artistic
policy is supreme, we must maximise
the profitability of our profit centres,”
said Fairfax a former actor and one-
time participant on television’s Consider
Your Verdict who, at 55, has been at the
helm of the Arts Centre for 15 years. He
is still a member of Actors Equity just
in case something pops up and has an
actress daughter.
For Fairfax, the official opening of
the centre last week was the end of the
rehearsal period.
The National Gallery of Victoria
opened in 1968. Some $225 million
later, the complex is complete and
Fairfax is looking forward to a long and
profitable season. □
THE ALP
Govt alienating
the workers,
says minister
By DEBORAH HOPE
LEFT-WING Defence Support minis-
ter Brian Howe has attacked the govern-
ment for paying more attention to
opinion polls than to Labor Party policy
when making decisions.
Howe’s criticisms are contained in
Class, Politics and the ALP, co-authored
with Renate Howe and published this
month in Labor Essays 1984*.
In his essay, Howe takes the ALP to
task for losing sight of its socialist
objective alienating traditional
supporters, the blue-collar workers.
According to Howe, it is time the
party re-evaluated its 1960 s conclusion

that its electoral survival depended on
shedding its working class image and
priorities. This prescription, he says,
was based on an inaccurate assumption
of where the political allegiances of the
expanding white-collar sector of the
workforce would lie.
The result had been a tendency to
paternalism toward blue-collar workers
throughout the ALP from rank-and-file
to government level, he said. Failure by
the party to address this problem could
hinder the success of some key areas of
government action, such as industry
restructuring.
“The tendency to vicarious represen-
tation of the manual working class
should be a matter of major concern to
the party,” Howe says.
“It is no longer enough for the party
to.assume that the links between the
political and industrial wings of the
movement are being made at a higher
level. While it is true that job security
cannot be achieved without changes in
our industrial structure ... it is also true
that we cannot re-shape our industry
without the active support of the labor
movement.”
Howe argues that the 1960 s argu-
ment that the Labor Party’s base must
be widened resulted from an assump-
tion that white-collar workers would
identify with middle-class politics
rather than with the general labor move-
ment.
However, he says, the subsequent
expansion of white-collar unionism and
evidence of significant ALP support
among non-manual and indeed pro-
fessional workers had reduced the argu-
ment’s credibility.
One example of this, he says, is to be
seen in a study of ALP candidates and
campaign workers in the
1979 Victorian election
which found that the
the white-collar and
professional “knowledge
elite” provided easily the
largest proportion of party
candidates and campaign
workers. And, despite
predictions of the
“embourgeoisement” of
the workforce, there was
no evidence that disparities
in the distribution of
wealth in Australia have
diminished. While the top
10 percent of male earners
received 20.2 percent of all
money received as income
in 1973-74, the figure had
Brian
Howe
risen to 24.5 percent by 1981-82.
As a result, white-collar workers
should be reassessed as part of a wider
working class.
A sign of something amiss in the
ALP, says Howe, is the growing separa-
tion between party and politicians at the
federal level “where opinion polls,
rather than party policy, often deter-
mine the direction of political decision-
making” and there is an increasing
tendency for non-party bodies to
formulate policy.
The extent to which policy was
binding on the government had been a
particular issue in the areas of economic
and resources policy.
The Howes offer a four-point pre-
scription of the Labor Party’s “pro-
blem”: action to develop a re-dis-
tributive tax policy to fund its social
security programs and investment in
industry competitiveness; determined
action to ensure rank-and-file union
involvement in industry planning; more
attention by branches to industrial and
economic issues and less to single-issue
politics; and care to avoid a
paternalistic attitude toward the union
movement. □

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
Communications
breakdown
in the Alice
By JUDY LOREN *
RACISM and Aboriginal self-determin-
ation are both going strong in Alice
Springs. Throw in a log of land claims,
the Northern Territory’s record in al-
cohol consumption and a tough crimi-
nal code and you have a powderkeg at-
tached to a long fuse.
The town has a laid-back look at first
glance catering to a well-developed
tourist industry but resentments sim-
mer under Alice’s casual exterior.
Every time a sacred site is claimed,
whites complain that their land is being
stolen with government consent. A
favorite white saying is that the quickest
way to find a sacred site is to dig a mine.
Blacks emphatically deny this. They de-
mand further redress for past injustices.
And government money is pouring into
the territory for just that.
“The Department of Aboriginal
Affairs poured around $l6 million into
the central Australian region last year,”
says Pat Turner, community develop-
ment senior director for the department.
And there is more: mining royalties, for
traditional owners, and social security
cheques.
“Only 30 percent of the Northern
Territory population is black, yet the
entire economy is supported by the Ab-
original dollar. Moreover, there are no
wholly black-controlled food and retail
outlets, so a lot of this money ends up in
white pockets,” says Turner, an Arunda
Aboriginal. “The social security pay-
ments are the only source of income for
many black people, who suffer from an
85 percent unemployment rate com-
pared with 15 percent down south.”
The department’s role is to give
blacks work and opportunities so that
they acquire personal responsibility and
can maintain their language and cul-
ture. “Work” is not defined by the white
Protestant ethic but can mean imparting
skills and history to the younger genera-
tions. That’s unacceptable to many
whites who would prefer to see blacks
assimilate. “Then we wouldn’t need per-
mits to go on our land,” a cattle station
owner complains.
“People down south don’t know
what’s happening up here,” Turner says.
“Aboriginals can’t live off the land any
more. They were put into settlements
and became sedentary. Now, there are
cattle stations everywhere so a lot of the
bush tucker is gone. Yet, small family
groups of Aboriginals are leaving their
centralised communities to return to
their traditional land. This is causing a
bureaucratic headache.”
It is easy to become submerged in the
pioneer romance of the outback. But a
closer look detects an urban reality of
high housing costs and an explosive
growth rate. Whites can cope with this
situation, blacks cannot.
Heavy drinking is one of the few
things shared by blacks and whites
alike. “Whites have always had access
to it but, for blacks, one day it was
forbidden and the next allowed. There
was no information about social drink-
ing,” says Pat Miller, Aboriginal Legal
Service director. Many black problems
are caused by alcohol ignorance.
Aborigines at Papunya camp near Alice Springs
“Alcohol abuse is resolved by educa-
tion,” Miller says. “It is naive to believe
that harsh penalties will stop this prob-
lem.”
The most common offences which
confront the legal service’s five white
solicitors are alcohol-related, from the
street.
“The basic imbalance in the (new
criminal) code’s provisions is that they
fail to recognise people’s problems,”
says solicitor John Tippet. “Many
offences are the result of the ‘two-kilo-
metres law’ prohibiting public drinking
within two kilometres of any licensed
outlet. Alice Springs’ many pubs and
even milk-bars carry such licences. This
means blacks are constantly being
harassed by police. Most crimes are al-
cohol-related.
“The imprisonment rate of 204 per
100,000 head of population is double
that of Western Australia. Victoria’s
rate is 60 to 70 per 100,000 people,” he
says.
Many Aboriginal communities have
been declared dry areas where alcohol
is forbidden by law.
Traditional Aboriginal law flour-
ishes, not withstanding white justice.
Banishment and leg spearing are re-
served for the harshest crimes. Payback
occurs even after the jail sentences.
“We want the Aboriginals to carry
on traditional law: it is the only way
that they are satisfied about penalty and
it restores community cohesion,” Tippet
insists.
“Answers will hopefully be found in
10 to 15 years’ time. The key lies in try-
ing different solutions.”
But time will not wait.
Negotiating with multinationals
through the Central Land Council and
grappling with modern technology are
becoming part of the Aboriginal
lifestyle.
Central Australian Aboriginal Media
Association, the territory’s Aboriginal
radio station, is a good example.
Funded by 11 bodies, including the de-
partment and Special Broadcasting Ser-
vice, it puts material to air in the
Aranda, Warlpiri, Pitjantjarra and
English languages. Its musical content
is an all-black mix of reggae, rock and
roll, choir and the big favorite -
country music.
Music often brings together people
from diverse backgrounds but Alice
residents are too deeply entrenched in
black and white thinking.
Competing business interests and
fierce determination on both sides have
drawn battlelines. “If you’re not with
us, you’re against us,” is the prevailing
mentality.
“People should just get to know
people” are Turner’s parting words.
But, in Alice, few are talking. □

TRADE
Coal and iron
fire up dealings
with China
Premier Zhao Ziyang in Australia: a growing special relationship
By FIA CUMMING
WHEN Prime Minister Bob Hawke an-
nounced last February that Australia
could double its steel industry by devel-
oping exports to China, few people in
this country took the claims seriously.
But just eight months later, trade with
China has become one of the most sur-
prising and least known successes of the
Hawke government’s first term.
Australia is now positioned to take a
key role in China’s massive modernisa-
tion program. The warm feeling be-
tween the two countries that began
under the Whitlam government now has
been translated into economic terms of
mutual benefit.
In the field of iron and steel, the facts
speak for themselves. The following
progress is more remarkable given the
traditionally slow operations of the
Chinese bureaucracy.
■ Sales of iron ore, manganese, steel
products and coal to China this year
now are expected to total $177 million
nearly 50 percent more than last year.
■ The first sales of manganese and
steeling coal have been made.
■ BHP sales to China this year will
be around 300,000 tonnes. The latest
sale of $2O million includes tinplate
from Pork Kembla and semi-finished
steel from Whyalla.
■ Hamersley Holdings and the
Chinese government have signed an
agreement on a feasibility study for a
new joint venture in the Pilbara which
would exist solely for the Chinese iron
ore market.
■ Western Australian interests are
conducting feasibility tests on a new
process of direct reduction of iron ore
to raw steel which would open up mar-
kets in China and Europe.
There is every prospect that sales and
joint ventures in iron and steel and re-
lated industries will continue to expand
rapidly. A technical mission to China
reported last week that great op-
portunities existed for Australian com-
panies to supply goods and services to
all sectors of Chinese industry, from
mining to finishing mills and as China
increased its steel production it would
need greater inputs of raw and semi-
finished steel from other countries.
Iron and steel was the right place to
start Australia’s entry into China’s de-
velopment program because it pro-
vided the foundations for development.
But as modernisation proceeds, spec
tacular opportunities are emerging for a
wide range of other Australian indus
tries to sell to China. They include dairy
processing, food processing, heavy en
gineering, energy and energy-support
equipment, building and construction
materials, metallurgy, agricultural and
mining equipment, coal and technical
education.
Australia’s biggest companies are
aware of the potential and are beating a
path to the trade department in Can-
berra for details of how to tailor their
services to the needs of the China mar-
ket. BHP, CRA, CSR, Woolworths,
Myer, Coles and Dunlop are among
many which have suddenly discovered
the lure of the Far East. Wormalds,
Jacques and ANDEL also have won
major export contracts with China.
Resources and Energy Minister,
Senator Peter Walsh, signed a memor-
andum of understanding on co-oper-
ation for the coal industry during his
trip to China last month. The memoran-
dum is the first step toward an agree-
ment on economic and technical co-op-
eration, similar to the agreement for the
iron and steel industry signed by the
Australian and Chinese governments in
August this year.
The memorandum on the coal indus-
try, like the iron and steel agreement,
covers every aspect and stage of the in-
dustry, from resources assessment and
open cut and underground mine design
to computer applications in mines and
plants and coal storage, handling and
transportation.
Personal contact between Hawke
and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang
played a part in the sudden strengthen-
ing of economic ties. But the initiative
came from Zhao, during his trip to Aus-
tralia in April, 1983, just after Labor
won government. In talks with the gov-
ernment, Zhao stressed that China’s
modernisation program, after some
false starts, really was going to proceed
and Australia could play a part if it was
prepared to make the necessary effort.
The result was the Action Plan for
China. It was a gamble, requiring a
doubling of resources within sections of
the department and other largesse at a
time of financial restraints on the gov-
ernment. But it was backed by Trade
Minister Lionel Bowen and Hawke.
The new head of the North Asia sec-
tion in the department, Denis Gastin,
had the task of putting it to work. He set
off to China alone to gain the confi-
dence of the Chinese. This required con-
vincing them that the Australians were
reliable and would follow up any agree-
ments reached; and that they had the
expertise and experience that the
Chinese needed. It was a painstaking
process. Five provinces were chosen as
the focus for Australian enterprise;
Gastin would approach the leaders,
usually the governor and keep going
back every month or more often
until they were convinced, “like water
dripping on a stone,” says Gastin.
Of the past 18 months, Gastin spent
about six in China on numerous trips.
He acquired an exotic bug that altered
his lifestyle but not his enthusiasm
about the action plan. He sat through
scores of 23-course banquets, politely
scoffing delicacies such as camel’s foot,
caterpillar soup, black moss, yak’s ribs
and fresh blood sausage that dripped
while he ate.
In many places, he was the first Aus-
tralian to visit. Everywhere, the con-
stant attention from the Australians
made an impact. By the time Bob
Hawke appeared in China, the action
plan was eight months old. He was able
to state quite truthfully that Australia


enjoyed a special relationship with
China and, when he raised the question
of iron and steel sales, he received a
favorable response.
To the Chinese, it was important for
the trade deals flowing from the action
plan to be conducted on a government-
to-government basis. This was one
reason for the plan’s success; through
the trade department, a constant flow of
Australian official delegations passed in
and out of China, impressing them im-
mensely. For example, eight Hawke
government ministers have visited
China in the past year; at the Fujian 84
provincial display this year, Australia
was the only country with a display
among dozens of international compan-
ies; an Australia-China Business Man-
agement Forum was held in Beijing in
June, the first of its kind; the Metal
Trades’ Industry Association took part
in the International Total Energy exhi-
bition in Guangdon in June. Lionel
Bowen visited every province, also the
Chinese Special Economic Zone which
he was the first international dignitary
to visit, a sign to the Chinese that Aus-
tralia was taking its new outward-look-
ing policies seriously.
Another element in the action plan
was balance in the resulting trade. The
trade department is not only promoting
Chinese goods within Australia and
sponsoring visiting delegations of
Chinese corporate leaders but actively
helping China to develop markets in
other western countries. It is giving
specific tips, such as appropriate
English names for products (not Red
Cock for condoms), and inspections of
Australian supermarkets, as well as
product improvement and marketing
instructions.
Gastin is convinced that now the
plan is off thp ground, it will continue to
grow and grow because Australian com-
panies have a particular aptitude for
dealing with £hina.
They know how to adapt technology
to Australian purposes and to China’s,
rather than trying to sell a ready-made
product which is quite unsuitable to
China. Gastin says the Americans have
created some ill-will by making deals
with a lot of razzamatazz, then walking
away and leaving the Chinese quite con-
fused about how to use their new equip-
ment but Australian companies are pre-
pared to take the time to explain.
An American company for instance
sold a bakery to the Chinese. They
could not get the bread to rise and be-
came convinced it was something in the
Chinese climate that prevented bread-
making. Australia’s Allied Mills has re-
cently built a demonstration bakery to
prove that there’s nothing wrong with
the air in China it was just that the
American bakery was built only for
American flour. □

HEALTH
Skin doctor
in a lather
about soap
By GLENDA THOMPSON
AUSTRALIANS are ruining their skin
by soaping and shampooing daily,
scrubbing their faces, using after-shave,
sleeping under continental quilts and
taking bubble baths ... This is a top
skin specialist’s opinion. He says that
soap robs the skin of its special grease
and this can lead to damage.
The doctor believes in moisturising.
He recommends that a
simple cream be used to
wash and to moisturise.
The doctor (who will
not be identified, on ethical
grounds) says he has not
used soap in the shower for
10 years. “I sometimes go
for months without using
shampoo: It doesn’t mean
you don’t wash; you just
don’t use soap.”
He tells patients that
they may use a little soap
once a day but should use
only water or moisturising
cream for subsequent
washes. He advises them to
apply the cream and some
water as a moisturiser after
washing, to “polish” the
skin.
Shampoo should be
used a maximum of once a
week, he says. At other
times, people should wash their hair
with water or with a little conditioner
but it takes about eight weeks for hair
and scalp to adjust to the new regimen.
He says his views are controversial
but are catching on.
“Society seems to get more maso-
chistic as it becomes more affluent and
the most masochism is inflicted on the
skin.” He lists as harmful heaters,
saunas, spa baths and most chemicals
applied to skin.
The skin has two kinds of natural lu-
bricants to protect it; they come from
the grease glands and the skin cells
themselves.
The lubricants hold the outer layer of
cells together, keep moisture in and
waterproof the surface.
Frequent washing stimulates extra
production of grease gland lubricant
but has the opposite effect on cell lubri-
cant, the doctor says. Cells manufacture
their lubricant during their four-week
journey across 0.05 millimetres from the
base of the epidermis or outer skin layer
to the edge where they fall off. Scrub-
bing cuts this time and less lubricant is
available.
Too-frequent washing dries out the
cells and leaves them open to irritation,
infection or injury. The skin doctor de-
fines injury as long-term damage
from sunlight, for example sometimes
leading to pre-cancer and cancer.
He warns against any kind of drying
agent, the “worst” being soap: “I would
estimate 70 percent of the world’s popu-
lation uses no soap as we know it. The
average Frenchman uses two bars a
year. The average Australian uses 21
bars and wonders why his skin gets into
trouble.
“I believe three or four bars a year is
enough for anybody.”
Drying chemicals include shampoo,
Skin cross-section: the epidermis acts as a protective barrier
bubble bath, chlorine, salt water, after-
shave lotion and anything “medicated,”
according to the doctor. He says: “I
don’t know what ‘medicated’ means. It
was invented by advertising people.
Anything labelled ‘medicated,’ ‘organic’
or ‘natural’ suggests it won’t sell on its
own merits.
“I don’t believe there is any place for
tonics, toners, astringents and cleansers
they are counter-productive.”
He lists other driers as the Sun, dry
winds, air-conditioning, heating, elec-
tric blankets and continental quilts.
People cannot throw off half a continen-
tal quilt, so they become hot and the
sweating for the whole body tends to be
done through the face and scalp, he ar-
gues.
The doctor says that people should
exercise their in-built temperature ad-
justment mechanisms by not warming
their beds before getting into them and
by sleeping cool. “There is nothing
wrong with feeling cold occasionally,”
he says, “yet people put extra clothes on
lest they get cold.”
Washing takes the waterproofing out
of sweat ducts and they become blocked
and inflamed. This gives rise in winter
to an itch and in summer to heat rashes.
Sweating is associated with climate,
electric blankets, quilts, fever, exertion,
stress, anxiety, boredom and anger.
Australian views on skin care are in-
fluenced by North American and Euro-
pean magazines, text books, advertising
and toiletries; yet the different climate
needs different solutions, the doctor
says.
“My meteorological adviser tells me
no city in the world has a greater daily
variation in temperature and humidity
than Sydney.
“If you want to look after antique
furniture, paintings, wine, computers
anything you put them
in constant temperature
and humidity. So, we start
at a disadvantage because
of climate.”
Most Asians have dry
skin, though it worries
them less in their climates,
the doctor says. Levantines
people from Turkey,
Greece and Lebanon in-
herit dry skin and, in those
countries, a gentle glycerin
soap is popular.
Atopies people with
potential for asthma, hay
fever and eczema and
the fair-haired Caucasians
who sport green to blue
eyes, red to fair hair and
freckles are at risk.
“People who are going
to look after their skin
should have a normal
diet,” says the doctor.
“There is no food that is particularly
good for skin and none that is particu-
larly bad, except in the case of some
individuals who have specific reactions.
“Humidify any room that is heated
or air-conditioned - one way is to keep
a wide bowl of water in the room.
“It is important to reduce the use of
soap.
“Use only water for a second and
third shower in a day, as long as the
water is not too hot. Don’t use only
water every time because it dries the
skin. Use a moisturising cream as soap
- as I do - and apply some after each
shower, bath or swim.
“I think people should half-dry
themselves and moisturise.
“This moisturising cream can be
used as a soap, facial cleanser and as
shaving cream.”
The cream the doctor uses, 10 per-
cent glycerin in sorbolene cream (aque-
ous cetomacrogol cream), is available
quite cheaply from chemists. Several
companies make it. □


Canyoube ruth
and a loving paren
There are many ways for you to be
more competitive in the way that you
go about your business. (The faint-hearted
would call some of these ploys ruthless.)
But there is one way that allows you
to improve your business efficiency, and give
your kids a head start at the same time.
It’s the new Apple lie.
Apple lie. The 8 pound heavyweight.
For such a powerful, capable machine,
the Apple lie is extremely compact.
The new Apple weighs just less than 8
pounds, half as much as computers with half
its power. It has been designed to be the same
size as a 3-ring binder, not a 3-ring circus.
It has over 10,000 software programs
written for it. With educational programs
that graduate from Spelling to Acid-Based
Chemistry.
And with business programs that range
from Inventory Control to Sales Analysis.
Apple lie. The perfect business partner.
When you take your Apple to work,
you’ll find there’s an Apple program to help
you keep records, manage finances and
prepare, file and retrieve documents. There
are many Apple programs written for spec-
ific use by people such as farmers, doctors,
lawyers and accountants.
With an Apple printer you can easily
turn screeds of information into graphs and
charts in seconds, not in hours.
Should your office possess a mainframe
computer, your Apple can connect into it.
Whether you’re working directly with
a mainframe program or transferring wads
of information onto a program disk for your
later use, you will soon see that having an
Apple lie on your desk is a lot smarter than
having a dumb terminal.
In no time, your nights and weekends
of being office bound, simply because the
computer’s there, are over.
Apple lie. The perfect teacher.
When you take the Apple home
you’ll realise that a perfect, patient inspiring
teacher is never far from hand.
After plugging the Apple into a normal
television or an optional monitor, the first of
6 self-explanatory programs can be inserted
into the built-in disk drive.
Young and old will very quickly realise
how simple Apple has made it to master the
personal computer.
And in no time at all, young people
will find themselves at the door of one of
the most unusual libraries ever assembled,
the Apple software library.
Even though there are new programs
written for the Apple every day, there are
currently over 2000 education based prog-
rams available.
At their own pace, with the new found


less in business
tat the same time?
concentration that a computer creates, your
children can take themselves on a private
tuition course that covers virtually every
subject on the school curriculum.
Whether they’re learning to read
music or a foreign language, your children
will be enjoying the considerable advantages
of a student to teacher ratio of 1 to 1.
Whatever the subject however, many
people believe that familiarity alone with a
computer is going to be a tremendous
advantage in the future of a young person
growing up today.
Who knows, an Apple may give your
kids such a head start, they may never even
have to be ruthless in business.

SPORT
The marketing of lan Baker-Finch
Ian Baker-Finch and caddy Phil Wright read a green during the NSW Open
lan Baker-Finch is golf s hottest prospect. GLENNYS BELL tells what makes him swing.
“LET’S BE honest. We’re talking about
the exploitation of lan Baker-Finch,”
his agent, Steve Frazer, says when the
subject of the commercial future of the
young golfer is raised. “We’re looking
for an upmarket image.”
Upmarket is the Lacoste crocodile
on the blue slacks and pink sweaters he
seems to favor. It’s a good idea. Pink
proved to be a distinguishing mark in
the British Open, making it easy to pick
him out. Blue is his favored color. Even
his golf glove is blue.
Baker-Finch is probably the best
commercial and sporting prospect
in Australian golf. This is due largely to
his remarkable performance in the Brit-
ish Open last July. Real fame, however,
could be as elusive as a hole in one. He
has to win the big tournaments, the Aus-
tralian Open, at Royal Melbourne, on
November 15-18, for example, and
crack the US circuit, to prove he is the
heir apparent to Greg Norman, our pre-
sent golf champion. With his successes
on the American circuit and his follow-
ing among the media and fans, Norman
can probably count on making $1 mil-
lion in prize money, endorsements and
sponsorships in 1985.
Baker-Finch is currently counting off
the length of the Royal Melbourne fair-
ways and the size of woods and irons to
play. He is so new to the circuits he
only started in 1980 - that he is still
learning from every experience. Baker-
Finch shares the obsession that leads so
many players to describe golf as the
greatest game in the world. He says:
“It’s an absolutely unbelievable game
Ian Baker-Finch: looking for an upmarket image
BRIAN FERGUSON
because you can never get on top and
when you think you are, it will knock
you straight down.”
HE IS playing a social game but he can-
not resist sharing his skill and knowl-
edge with his partners. It is a carry-over
from his days as a club professional and
he is a natural teacher. “I enjoy helping
someone who is hitting bad shots hit
good ones,” he explains. “I enjoy seeing
results.”
His partners include his agent, Steve
Frazer. He is an intractable
case, Baker-Finch confides.
No efforts on his part will
change Frazer’s bad habits
and bad swing. “With his
shoulders all out of plumb
you can tell he’s a sheer,”
Baker-Finch says. “Maybe he
should take up another
sport.”
Roger Gould, a photogra-
pher who partners Baker-
Finch in the foursome, is a
different matter. His game
suffers because he travels the
world on sports assignments
but improves rapidly over the
course as he follows Baker-
Finch’s suggestions. His fun-
damentals are basically cor-
rect. It’s a matter of practice
and a little help from his
friend.
Then there is Phil Wright,
who caddies for Baker-Finch.
“Great swing!” Baker-Finch
keeps calling, adding: “If only
he would stand up to the ball a little
higher, bring his hands up and swing
with a little more rhythm, a little less de-
termination.”
In return, Baker-Finch listens to his
caddie. Their huddles during tourna-
ments, with Baker-Finch on his
haunches and Wright hunched over
him, studying the green, have become
part of the Baker-Finch signature.
So, too, has his swing. He is tall, with
long legs and a barrel chest, the reason
he believes he looks different from most


golfers who are slim with wide should-
ers. His swing causes comments, but he
has learned to live with the comments
and the swing. With his gentle sway,
high backswing and balanced follow
through, he has more of the style of a
Nureyev than the brute force of a
woodchopper. It may not be classic, but
it works.
To a large extent, he is self taught,
picking up the game on his father’s farm
in Beerwah, Queensland. As a young
boy, his hero was Jack Nicklaus.
Last July, Baker-Finch, literally the
boy from the bush, happened to be in
the locker room of the home of golf, St
Andrews in Scotland, when who should
come up and congratulate
him? None other than
Nicklaus himself. Baker-
Finch likes to take a calm and
relaxed approach to most
things, including golf and
Jack Nicklaus. “He said I was
doing very nicely and told me
to relax and that sort of stuff.”
He sounds almost blase, then
betrays himself. “He’s not just
the greatest golfer in the world
but a hell of a nice guy.”
On the last day of the tour-
nament, Baker-Finch found
himself paired with Tom
Watson, another of his boy-
hood heroes. It was a dream
fulfilled. Here was lan Baker-
Finch, still only 23 years old
and playing on the most his-
toric golf course in the world
with the greatest golfers in the
world and in one of the
greatest tournaments, the Brit-
ish Open. And for two days,
he was leading.
Even before he started, he
had his following. As the New
Yorker remarked, “All the
good P. G. Wodehouse fans, who ap-
preciate the kind of double-barrelled
names one would run into at the Drones
Club, immediately announced that they
would be supporting this Baker-Finch
chap, and they were delighted to find
that he was a tall (six-foot three) good
looking fellow of 23 with a becoming
naturalness and modesty.”
The first day, a Thursday, the
Wodehouse fans must have been chort-
ling. Their hyphenated golfer came in
with 68, one stroke behind the leaders.
The second day, they were probably
snuffling into their pink gins. Contrary
to expectations, he was leading the field
after a 66. Saturday, there must have
been apoplexy at the Drones Club, and
the 19th hole. He was holding together,
with a 71.
On the last day everybody was ex-
pecting Baker-Finch to fade. He did,
but not without a struggle, and tied for
ninth place.
Something happened to him on that
last day, that even Baker-Finch finds
difficult to explain: “I was surprised at
how calm and relaxed I was. It was in-
credible. I didn’t believe I could win. I
had this doubt in my mind. I was think-
ing what am I going to do with a million
dollars. What are people going to say?
They’re going to think I got lucky. It
may ruin the rest of my life because
people are going to expect me to win
every tournament I play. A lot of things
like that went through my mind.”
At his age, with just the New Zealand
Open and the West Australian Open be-
hind him, he knew he was not ready for
overnight success. “I definitely didn’t
Jack Nicklaus: hero to the young Baker-Finch
want to win. If I had, I would have been
nervous. I was so calm and relaxed that
last day, but I could never work out why
until now ...- Subconsciously, I didn’t
want to win because I could see myself
going from a simple, inexperienced
young guy who has only won a couple
of tournaments to someone winning the
British Open on his first try and be-
coming the most famous golfer in the
world.”
Instead, he suffered the sting of criti-
cism. He faded, he was a choker, some-
one who loses the game he is leading. It
made the NSW Open all the more im-
portant. “If I had had the hunger I had
in the NSW Open, then I would have
been a little bit nervous and a little bit
jumpy at the British Open. The things
that went wrong for me at the beginning
of the last round wouldn’t have
bothered me so much. I would have had
the determination to get on with it.”
He won the NSW Open by 13
strokes, defeating the defending cham-
pion Greg Norman, US Open winner
David Graham and million dollar win-
ner Graham Marsh.
THE ROYAL Melbourne Golf Club is
not just another state away, but a whole
lifestyle away from the Beerwah Golf
Club where lan Baker-Finch learned to
play. His father and some friends from
the local RSL Club decided to build
their own nine-hole course, on land pro-
vided by the Forestry Department.
Every weekend, Baker-Finch, snr, a
farmer, and other farmers would bring
along their tractors to clear the land and
Baker-Finch, jnr, about 10 at the time,
would tag along to help.
He started playing golf on the course
his father designed, using his father’s
clubs. He was 12 before he was given a
set of his own.
He read voraciously about the his-
tory of the game and its theories and
everything he could find on, about and
by his hero, Jack Nicklaus. He started to
win a few events, schoolboy champion-
ships, and then he won the Gary Player
International Golf Classic in the under
16 division. It was then he decided to
take a few lessons. He also decided to be
a professional.
He was 15. It was not a decision his
parents automatically approved. They
wanted him to continue school. Be-
coming an apprentice meant leaving
home, travelling to the Gympie club two
hours away and living in a flat on his
own. But they finally agreed.
It is a decision he has never regret-
ted, not with the life he has won from
golf. After a couple of years, he moved
to Caloundra and then decided to try
his luck on the circuit.
It was 1980. To build up a kitty, he
worked on a tobacco farm and a pine-
apple farm then went on tour. It is a
gruelling round of professional tourna-
ments where some 150 to 200 hopefuls
hit off in the qualifying rounds for the
final cut. Few make it. Phil Wright, a
budding young golfer himself, has seen
the circuit and learned enough to stay
Baker-Finch’s caddie.
The two met when Baker-Finch
played at Wright’s club, Whittlesea, out-
side Melbourne, and Wright asked him
if he wanted a caddie. No payment
required. That was all right with Baker-
Finch, picking pineapples to float him
through the first few tournaments. He
estimates it costs a minimum of $lOOO a
week to play the circuit. For a growing
boy like Baker-Finch, food is a major
item. “If you’re eating well, that’s $2OO a
week. Then there’s accommodation in a
nice hotel for five or six days, $350 a
week, a caddie costs $2OO and airfares at
least $l5O, then there’s a car and inci-
dentals. It all adds up.”
Of those 150 or so aspiring golfers,


only about 20 can expect to make a de-
cent living from the tour.
There were times in 1980 and again
in 1982 when he must have wondered
whether he, too, would ever have “the
touch,” the magic that makes the differ-
ence between the winners and losers. He
finished 80th in the order of merit in
1980 but the next year climbed to 20th.
In 1982, however, disaster struck. His
swing left him. For golfers the holy grail
is the perfect swing, they are perpetually
seeking its secret.
Baker-Finch sought help from Peter
Thomson. “I knew my swing was get-
ting worse and worse and that’s where
Peter helped me out. Now I understand
my swing well enough to sort things out,
but a lot of golfers don’t and
that’s why they have coaches.”
He next saw Peter
Thomson at the British Open,
where the former winner
played a practice round with
him and generously gave him
a few tips. But the Thomson
tips have become part of the
growing mythology of Baker-
Finch. As he keeps saying to
journalists who mention the
Thomson connection, “A lot
of you blokes think I have to
consult Peter every time 1 go
to the toilet.” He doesn’t.
But he did learn from
Thomson and corrected his
swing and it all started to
come together in 1983. He
ended sixth in the order of
merit, which qualified him for
the British Open this year.
He uses video tapes to ana-
lyse his game. At present, he is
playing well, a result of work-
ing on his weak spot, his
rhythm. “If something goes
wrong with a shot, then I can
tell what it is.” It can be his
rhythm, his frame of mind or
his swing. “The best asset I
have at the moment is that I set it all up
very well, correctly. I’m a very good
putter and I have good rhythm.”
He generates a lot of power in his
swing, averaging 250 m, often getting
more. He can hit as far as Greg
Norman, though he concedes that in a
tournament Norman would probably
have more in reserve.
He can manufacture shots, delib-
erately fading left to right or right to
left. In a professional, it is an art. In an
amateur, it is a fault. In a Seve
Ballesteros, it has been the means of
winning the British Open.
He can maintain concentration over
five or more hours during each day of a
tournament, particularly in the closing
stages where a drive correctly pos-
itioned or a putt correctly played can be
the winning stroke. The crowd does not
worry him. He likes it. “Sometimes
people taking photos during your swing
or moving behind you can put you off
but concentration comes down to your
own frame of mind, positive thinking.
I’m lucky the crowd is normally with me
and I enjoy playing to them, thanking
them, smiling at them. That’s a big part
of it. Why I come across well. They
don’t put me off I love it.”
His favorite course is Kingston
Heath, in Melbourne, where he was run-
ner up to Peter Fowler in last year’s
Australian Open. Fowler’s only pre-
vious win was a NSW country tourna-
ment and he will have a tough time de-
fending his title this year against a field
that includes Tom Watson.
Peter Thomson: a little help along the way for Baker-Finch
BRIAN FERGUSON
Baker-Finch likes to practise on Mel-
bourne courses which he regards as
among the best in the world. He is plan-
ning to buy a house there. He practises
nearly every day, tournament or not,
and hits 200-300 balls in a practice
session before each tournament round
begins.
He shares with many golfers awe of
the 17th hole at St Andrews, the Road
Hole. “It’s daunting,” he says, but it was
not his downfall. St Andrews as a whole
proves a golfer’s mettle.
FOR THE FEW who do make it, golf
has glittering prizes. In Australia, it is
lucrative, though nowhere near as rich
as tennis. Both the Australian Open and
the PGA have total prize money of
$150,000 and most state championships
are worth $lOO,OOO. Baker-Finch’s share
of the recent NSW Open was $lB,OOO.
But the real money is in the United
States, where this year the professional
tournaments carried $2O million. For
Baker-Finch’s blond hero, Jack
Nicklaus, the title Golden Bear is
doubly appropriate. Baker-Finch says:
“He’s a great businessman as well. He’s
made millions and millions of dollars.”
In his 20 and more years of golf,
Nicklaus has won every major tourna-
ment at least once, most three or four
times. He has 20 major titles to his
name. But prize money has been the hit-
off point. Shrewd management and in-
vestment and the development of his
talent as a golf course architect, with in-
terests in the development of surround-
ing real estate, have made
Nicklaus the multi-million-
aire.
At this stage, Baker-Finch
barely thinks of the future,
though he sees no reason not
to emulate his hero. He is al-
ready under management by
Advantage International.
He belongs to a company
which originally concentrated
on entertainment and pop
stars, which might account for
the hype of agent Steve
Frazer, a former concert pro-
moter. The company was
started by Glenn Wheatley,
the impresario who created
the Little River Band before
affiliating with the Washing-
ton based sports management
group, Advantage Inter-
national.
Though Frazer is twitchy
; about Baker-Finch’s upmar-
! ket image, he actually has
1 only two companies tied up
! Dunlop for clubs and balls
; which Baker-Finch uses in
i Australia, Japan and Europe,
and Lacoste for the clothing
he wears in tournaments in
Australia and Europe.
The accounting firm Duesbury John-
ston & Marks also pays for its name to
appear on Baker-Finch’s bag and an in-
ternational airline looks ready to take
off while SAAB likes the look of Baker-
Finch at the wheel.
A lot depends on the next few tour-
naments, as Frazer concedes. “One of
the great difficulties in the early part of a
player’s career is that it’s easy to pick up
an arrangement then realise three weeks
later we could have done better.” One
thing is certain: “We want to be very
careful with the type of product he is
involved with,” says Frazer.
As Baker-Finch and his group come
up to the last few holes of their round he
is more interested in a lunch with his
mates to celebrate his 24th birthday and
whether he and partner Roger Gould


have won. There is at least $lO and a
beer riding on the results. Baker-Finch
is happy with his form though he can’t
resist a slight dig at his partners, “It’s
the only game where the world’s worst
players and the world’s best players can
play to the best of their natural ability
and have a good time.” □
RETAILING
Shop keeper
rebels take
on the rest
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
THE SAGA of Sunday trading in NSW,
dividing members of the retail industry,
looks set to continue as the NSW Gov-
ernment looks on. On one side is the
Retail Traders Association of NSW,
representing both big and small retail-
ing interests, but whose policies are
dominated by the wants of the big
chains and the Shop Distributive and
Allied Employees Association which
has generally shown opposition to ex-
tension of trading hours. On the other
are the rebels, retailers whose wares
usually include furniture and electrical
goods and who advertise that they are
open seven days a week. Ironically, the
rebels are, in the main, members of the
Retail Traders Association.
The NSW Government, specifically
the Department of Industrial Relations
and its Minister, Pat Hills, could be
called the referee. Legal Sunday trading
is governed by eligibility under the
NSW Factories, Shops and Industries
Act policed by Hills’ department. To
open on Sundays, shops are required to
satisfy the “small shop” provision of the
Act.
Some Sunday traders have been
granted “small shop” status by the gov-
ernment, others are trading as they wait
on applications and, apparently, others
are trading against the law.
What is turning retailer against re-
tailer is that the Retail Traders Associa-
tion has been the most active in policing
the rebels, many of whom feel they are
acting well within the law. Since
summonses were issued earlier this year
by the Retail Traders Association the
Shop Distributive and Allied Em-
ployees Association and the govern-
ment, through the undersecretary of the
Department of Industrial Relations, Joe
Riordan, several of the alleged law-
breakers face prosecution.
Both sides are critical of the govern-
ment. Barry Lord, general manager of
the Sydney furniture retailer Keith Lord
Discounts, claims that “You can only
blame the government, who else is
there?” Keith Lord’s four stores ceased
trading on Sundays earlier this year
along with a number of other stores in-
cluding Norman Ross Discounts, the
troubled furniture and electrical retail-
er, 50 percent owned by Waltons Bond
Ltd.
Leading the rebels is Harvey
Norman Discounts headed by the foun-
der of Norman Ross, Gerry Harvey,
who has several Sydney stores, the
largest of which is a complex at Auburn.
One of his neighbors in that suburb in
Sydney’s west is the Joyce Mayne Dis-
counts complex, a regular Sunday
trader. Being branded as a test case for
the rebels is the John Cootes Furniture
Warehouse, also in Sydney’s west at
Merrylands.
John Cootes, possibly best remem-
bered for his advertising line “The offers
of Norman Ross are genuine. I
wouldn’t do this commercial if they
weren’t,” is frustrated by the time and
energy he has spent establishing what he
feels are legal operations. Cootes
launched his business with another busi-
nessman, Terry Kennedy, in late 1982.

played rugby league for Australia, left a
job as sports director of Sydney’s Chan-
nel Ten to start the business.
After studying the legal ramifications
of trading on Sundays, Cootes and
Kennedy modelled their shops to con-
form with the “small shops” provisions.
But Cootes explains that after lodging
an application with the Department of
Industrial Relation’s undersecretary
two years ago, he has heard nothing
from the department.
The “small shop” status is at the
heart of any argument about Sunday
trading. Until 1977 the only businesses
which could trade as small shops were
virtual husband-and-wife teams with
operations such as garden and plant
supplies, florists and takeaway foods.
But 1977 amendments to the Act al-
lowed more operators. Businesses with
no more than two owners, a maximum
of two employees and whose owners
were not directly involved in the shop’s
management and had no interest in any
other business or undertaking, were
able to trade on Sundays.
After Justice Macken’s report into
retail trading hours in NSW was de-
livered to Pat Hills’ hands late last year,
further changes were made to the Act.
The definition of “small shop” was ex-
panded to allow for the employment of
no more than four full-time employees
together with “such part-time relief as is
necessary to make such employment
effective.” Maximum fines were lifted to
$lO,OOO.
The Retail Traders Association al-
leges that some of the Sunday traders
are no more than one business divided
into several smaller businesses. The
common practice is either the leasing or
franchising of separate shops in a com-
plex. Although the undersecretary has
chosen not to grant some shops “small
shop” tags, the present arrangements of
the so-called rebels have not been tested
in a court.
Cootes claims that the warehouse in
which he trades functions as two separ-
ate shops Cootes selling leather
lounges and “budget-type furniture”
and Kennedy selling bedding and
“middle of the market modules, lounge
furniture and cane furniture.” Cootes
says: “They are run as two separate
companies. I get my profit from my side
and Terry gets his profit from his.” In
order to satisfy the department about
the separateness of the two businesses
the two men constructed a permanent
wall between the shops with a gate
which the Department of Industrial Re-
lations officials permit allowing
people to walk between the shops. The
gate must be shut after business.
Cootes has not been vocal in the me-
dia, but the application for “small
shop” status has been encumbered by
bureaucracy. When Cootes inquired
about his application in mid-1983 he
was told by the department that it had
been lost. Another would be needed.
Cootes and Kennedy submitted fresh
applications but have heard nothing
still. Following Macken’s report, the
government has required that to trade, a
retailer must have been granted “small
shops” status rather than merely ap-
plied for one. With Harvey Norman
and others, Cootes and Kennedy have
received summonses and appeared in
the Industrial Court in Sydney last
month. After little more than a mention
the case has been put forward to March
next year during which time the two
men will continue to open on Sundays
without government approval.
Gerry Harvey is very much at home
Sunday traders Terry Kennedy (left) and John Cootes: seeking a small shop tag

as rebel. The Harvey Norman
businesses, he says, operate on a fran-
chise basis. After his “small shops” ap-
plication was knocked back, he ap-
pealed to the Retail Trades Tribunal,
headed by Justice Macken. The appeal
is in limbo.
Many of the 20 separate shops within
the Joyce Mayne complex are believed
to have been given the green light by the
government. The controversy is liable to
hot up through the busy Christmas
period.
IMMIGRATION
A guide to how
to get here,
and stay here
By WILLA MCDONALD
THE PROBLEM with the immigration
debate, says Sydney solicitor Adrian
Joel, is that few people know how mi-
grants are actually selected. “Nine
months this has been going on and I
have never once read an explanation
about how a refugee is chosen and how
family reunion works.”
His new book, A Practical Guide to
Obtaining Permanent Residence in Aus-
tralia (Legal Books Pty Ltd, $9.50) will
help remedy that.
In it he describes in plain English the
categories under which it is possible to
migrate, how to approach the Depart-
ment of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
and, if you fail, your rights of appeal.
The main fact which Joel says has
been overlooked in the arguments of re-
cent months is that refugees are not
chosen by race but “on the basis of
whether they have fled their own
country and have a genuine belief that
there would be persecution awaiting
them when they return home. It is an
objective standard formulated by the
United Nations and accepted by the
Australian government for selecting
refugees.
“What people must understand is
that refugees emerge as a consequence
of war or severe political disturbance,
not the political philosophy of a politi-
cal party in power (in Australia). The
reason why there happen to be people
who claim to be refugees that come
from Vietnam is the war they had
there.”
Hundreds of thousands of people
i fled Vietnam after the fall of Saigon,
i About 350,000 were in neighboring
: countries by 1979 awaiting resettlement.
! Some took to the sea in their desper-
ation and between 1976 and 1979 about


2000 “boat-people” arrived il-
legally on Australia’s north-
ern shores.
The scale of the problem
and Australia’s closeness to it
became apparent requiring
the formulation of a clear
refugee policy. By passing the
Human Rights Commission
Act in 1981, Australia con-
formed with international
declarations recognising the
plight of refugees and de-
signed to maintain human
rights.
“But,” says Joel, “people
from Asia can only continue
to apply for refugee status so
long as the political climate of
their homeland continues. As
soon as political and econ-
omic stability return to that
country those people lose the
right to be refugees. It’s be-
cause of the war the Vietnam-
ese have been let in. There’s
no guarantee that it will con-
tinue.”
But why are the Vietnamese allowed
in when there are so many flashpoints
around the world, Lebanon, for
example? According to Joel it’s simply
because they have not fled their home-
land. As long as they remain in Leba-
Solicitor Adrian Joel: plain English guide for migrants
KEVIN BROWN
non they are excluded from applying as
refugees.
Applications are heard by the Deter-
mination of Refugee Status Committee,
made up of representatives of various
Australian government departments. If
an applicant has arrived here, he or she
cannot be ordered to leave un-
til their claim to refugee status
has been heard. The commit-
tee applies the United
Nations’ test looking at
factors such as slavery, torture
and arbitrary arrest facing the
refugee in their own country.
If an applicant fails to be
classified as a refugee, he or
she may still be allowed to
stay in Australia (temporarily
or permanently) under the
Special Humanitarian Pro-
gram. Like the refugee
category, the Special Humani-
tarian Program allows a per-
son to apply for a change of
resident status while in Aus-
tralia and was set up “to en-
able the government to re-
spond compassionately to
those who are/were fleeing
substantial discrimination or
gross violations of human
rights.”
Applicants under the
Special Humanitarian Program must be
sponsored either by a family member in
Australia or, where there are no rela-
tives, a well-established community or-
ganisation.
According to figures given by the Im-
migration minister Stewart West, to par-

liament in September, about 36.3 per-
cent of the 62,350 migrants and refugees
who came to Australia in 1983-84 were
Asian (actual settler arrivals for the year
totalled 69,805). Refugees and people
who came in under the Special Humani-
tarian Program numbered 15,485.
The biggest category of migrants
(numbering 36,739) came in on the basis
of family reunion. All applicants under
this category must have a “blood rela-
tive” already living in Australia who
will sponsor them, ie, be prepared to
provide help and support to the intend-
ing settler.
All members of the family attempt-
ing to enter Australia must satisfy immi-
gration requirements, so, if one child
suffers from a “prescribed disease”
under the Migration Act, the whole
family is excluded.
The category itself is subdivided into
sections based on the particular family
relationship relied on, from spouses,
through adopted children and fiances to
non-dependent brothers and sisters. Pri-
ority is given to those categories higher
up on the list.
Sponsors may have additional obli-
gations imposed by the department, eg,
they may have had to be Australian resi-
dents for a qualifying period or they
may have to arrange employment for
the applicant (although current policy,
according to Joel, is that receipt of an
Australian government pension or other
benefit may satisfy the department).
Applicants under this category may
also have a claim for entry under the
Special Humanitarian Program or the
Labor Shortage and Business Migration
category.
As most people are aware, a person
can migrate to Australia if their occupa-
tion is one listed by the department as
being in demand. If it isn’t, then the ap-
plicant fails on occupational grounds
regardless of whether he or she has the
support of an Australian employer.
Two types of employer nominations
are possible group nomination where
the employer states the type of em-
ployees that are needed and the over-
seas posts of the department attempt to
organise the applications, and when the
employer nominates a particular per-
son.
But the employer must be genuine,
the nominee’s occupation must be in
short supply, he or she must be highly
skilled and have qualifications to match
the vacancy and the terms of the full-
time employment must comply with
Australian awards and standards. In
other words, job offers for piecework,
car detailing or selling on a commission
basis aren’t good enough.
The onus is on the employer to estab-
lish that the position can’t be filled by
an Australian citizen or resident.

here is whether the business

The fourth category is the

Needless to say this category

stantial financial backing to

to produce a weekly income,
in the form of interest, equiva-
lent to the average weekly
male wage) and creative and
sporting talents who need “exception-
ally high skills by international stan-
dards, a record of outstanding achieve-
ment overseas and generally still be in
the top rank in their areas.”
Depending on which category the
immigrant falls into, he or she must sat-

Points are awarded by the depart-

cation, employment record,
economic prospects and

The points system, which was

selection, is not applied to

in boxes. I had no trouble get-
ting anything I needed,” he
said with reference to Pro-
fessor Geoffrey Blainey’s alle-
gations of secrecy within the depart-
ment. “You need not even apply for it.”
While steering clear of political de-
bate, the book is a handy reference for
anyone needing information on the
workings of the department and the
practical aspects of immigration. □

MOTORING
The peculiar
attractions of
the Citroen
By ALAN KENNEDY
AT THE PARIS Motor Show two years
ago, an Australian motoring writer
asked to drive the new Citroen BX. The
gentleman from Citroen looked per-
turbed: “Australia. We sell cars in Aus-
tralia?” The journalist was dismissed
with a wave of the hand.
The man from Citroen was
right. No one sold his cars in
Australia, at that time. How-
ever, Maxim Motors, under
Jim Reddiex in Brisbane was
desperate to do so and Jaguar
Rover Australia had made
various approaches to this
most eccentric of French car-
makers for the right to sell in
Australia.
But, for the French, it was
just all too hard. The strong
dealer network had gone,
Australian design rules had
“killed” its engine and it had
no intention of tricking one
up to fulfil Reddiex’s 100
Citroen import licences. To
all intents, the marque was
dead in Australia.
Until this year. Today,
Citroen is being offered by
two companies in two very
different ways and a dogfight
has broken out.
What makes the bitter con-
test so remarkable is that the
parties, Citroen T.T. Australia
and Maxim, could not hope to
sell more than 1500 cars.
That’s low volume with slim
profit margins.
But this fighting is in keep-
ing with Citroen’s image. It is the
weirdest of the world’s mainstream car-
makers.
The cars have a reputation for relia-
bility which is, to say the least, poor. On
the other hand, every other car-maker
pays homage to the brilliance of
Citroen’s innovations. The company
pioneered front-wheel drive, wind
efficiency, hydropneumatic suspension,
ergonomically efficient dashboards,
wonderful handling and strange but ap-
pealing body design.
Talk to the people at Citroen and
you will find that the rest of the world is
out of step. Drive one for a while and
you start to believe the propaganda.
Citroen T.T. Australia is a division of
Wheels Abroad which specialises in
low-cost, long-term European car rent-
als and Citroen T.T. has joined forces
with former Citroen Cars Australia
managing director Ken Murden to pro-
mote a buy-a-Citroen-in-Europe deal.
The company’s newspaper advertise-
ments offer a new Citroen plus two re-
turn airfares, enabling people to fly to
France, pick up the car and then travel
around for three to six months before
shipment to Australia.
This three-to-six-month qualifying
period is to overcome Australian design
rules. It means the car you import does
not have a compliance plate which
could cause problems when you come
to trade it in.
As of next January 1, there will be no
Ken Murden: promoting a fly, drive and buy dealQ
KEITH BARLOW
advantage in staying more than three
months as the sliding scale of duty the
longer you stayed, the less you paid
has been abolished.
The investment for a top-of-the-
range Citroen 25 Fuel Injection CX is
around $31,500 if you stay three months
and $26,500 if you stay six months. This
covers airfares, insurance and registra-
tion fees in Europe, shipping to Austra-
lia and import duties. The contract also
guarantees the factory warranty
throughout Australia and guarantees
service and parts outside the warranty
period at the owner’s expense.
The same car is being offered by
Maxim Motors with full compliance
plates for about $34,000.
However, Citroen T.T. Australia also
is offering Citroens not available in
Australia. The warranty and parts guar-
antee applies to these cars as well. The
most interesting of these are in the mid-
range Citroen BX series which have
racked up big sales in Europe.
Agents for Maxim are unimpressed
by Citroen T.T. Australia. One referred
to them as “that travel agency down at
Mona Vale,” (a Sydney suburb). There
is talk of a law suit to stop Citroen T.T.
Australia using the name Citroen.
Reddiex has been importing Citroens
since 1948 and has remained faithful to
the marque during the hard years. When
Citroen was unable to supply a car
which complied with Australian design
rules, Reddiex rented his quota out and
hoped that Citroen would
come back one day.
The CX 25 satisfied Aus-
tralian design rules and
Reddiex used all his quota to
bring them in as soon as re-
leased. He has been in Europe
trying to get Citroen to build
some BXs to Australian de-
sign rules. Next year, under
the federal government car
plan, Reddiex can import as
many as he likes if he is pre-
pared to pay a 100 percent
penalty. But this could make
the cars so expensive that
even confirmed Citroen fans
might think again.
Reddiex’s Sydney agent,
lan Robinson Motors, says
the Citroen T.T. Australia car
is not the same. The Maxim’s
Citroen is built to what are
known as “tropical specifica-
tions.”
As for the models other
than the CX 25, Geoff Harris
of Robinson says parts will al-
ways be a problem. However,
Citroen T.T. has promised to
make an announcement soon
on an Australian servicing
network to look after cars
bought under its scheme.
Reddiex and the current dealer net-
work are determined to repel the
Citroen T.T. Australia threat. But the
winner will inherit a group of buyers so
small in number that it is hard to see
what all the fuss is about unless, of
course, someone has done their sums
and realised that even fringe importers
such as Citroen can make a pretty
penny in quota-free Australia under the
new car plan.
And what do the enigmatic Gauls
think of this battle for supremacy? Well,
when Reddiex’s first batch of CX 25s
was on the water heading for Australia
this year, the men at Citroen in Paris
told visiting pressmen that Citroen was
finished in Australia as far as they were
concerned and there was no intention of


sending out any CX 255. All of this was
news to Reddiex. He has since clarified
the lines of communication between
Brisbane and Paris. But the Citroen
head office is also entertaining represen-
tatives of Citroen T.T. Australia. This
has hurt the Australian Citroen dealers.
In the words of one: “The trouble in all
this is that Citroen just don’t seem to
care.” □
WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Cup challenge
bonanza for
home-owners
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
HOME-OWNERS close to Fremantle
or Cottesloe, Western Australia, the lo-
cale of the 1987 America’s Cup chal-
lenge, can look at taking lucrative hol-
idays elsewhere if they are prepared to
forgo the fun and the excitement.
The official accommodation agent
for the challenge, Clive Nelthorpe, of
Perth’s Motive Travel, believes that
selected homes will rent for from $5O to
$l5O a room a day in the few weeks up
to the end of the challenge in mid-
February.
After commissions and services are
deducted, owners could clear between
$lOOO and $3OOO a week for the three- to
four-week challenge period.
Now that some of the headier expec-
tations have simmered down, Nelthorpe
is basing his accommodation planning
on an influx of between 50,000 and
60,000 visitors at the climax of the cup
defence although the possibility of
other yachting competitions and the ar-
rival of and contests between prospec-
tive challengers mean there will be al-
most a year of yachting to attract fans to
Fremantle.
To try to spread the load, WA’s tour-
ism planners are doing their best to get
travel agents in the United States in par-
ticular to arrange tours to reach Perth
while the preliminary activities are
under way.
The prospect of a long season will
delight hoteliers in Perth where new
properties completed recently include
the five-star Merlin, belonging to the
Asian chain of the same name, which
was opened in July.
The major hotels last week appeared
to be running well below capacity and
Perth travel people doubt whether there
will be enough visitors in the next 12 to
18 months to fill the new rooms, which
cost $lOO and upward a night.
Nelthorpe said that hoteliers had
agreed to restrain prices during the
boom period of early 1987 to around
$165 a night for a standard room in a
five-star hotel. He pointed out that, as
inflation of hoteliers’ costs is predicted
to be about 10 percent a year com-
pounded, the figure will be close to the
published rate for a standard room.
Surveys show that about 15,000 beds
in hotels and boarding houses in the
Perth area will be available during the
challenge. This is the equivalent of
about 6900 rooms of varying standards,
leaving a big shortfall between commer-
Royal Perth Yacht (foreground): homeowners can anticipate lucrative holidays elsewhere
ROGER GARWOOD
cial accommodation available and the
trimmed-back visitor predictions.
Nelthorpe is checking out private
homes which will be available for lease
and also other homes where the owners
want to stay on but are prepared to ac-
cept paying guests. He estimates that
some 2000 acceptable homes will be-
come available and another 5000 rooms
in private homes.
Perth participants can expect a better
deal than those in Los Angeles where
residents offering homes for accommo-
dation during the recent Olympic
Games found that they were stuck with
crippling insurance and security fees.
Nelthorpe said he had negotiated
bulk insurance and security services at a
good rate. Catering services would be
available to provide meals and, hope-
fully, transport to and from the racing
venues.
A further 2000 beds will become
available in temporary hostels estab-
lished on crown land around Perth. Or-
ganisers are bidding for construction
camps in various parts of WA, which
will become surplus when jobs finished,
so they can be refurbished and made
available for visitors. Nelthorpe said
these cabins had bathrooms and air-
conditioning and could be made most
attractive for visitors.
There are also indications that ships
may be available for use as floating ho-
tels for part of the period of the chal-
lenge and its preliminaries.
A big visitor will be the Cunard
cruise liner QE II which will make its
first visit to Fremantle in February 1985
and, as it operates on a two-year cruise
cycle, probably be back February 1987.
Organisers have checked Fremantle
Harbor for the Queen and
found that it will have enough
room to turn and berth.
They also have their eyes
on government establish-
ments such as HMAS
Leeuwin, the training school
which will be phased out at
the end of this year when the
navy’s junior intake scheme is
closed. Leeuwin is a few hun-
dred metres from the heart of
the action.
Even with all this accom-
modation brought into use, a
last-minute rush may mean
some long-distance commu-
ting for visitors to Perth.
“Some may have to travel al-
most as far as Bunbury,”
Nelthorpe said.
But this would not be a
new experience for yacht-
racing fans: at Newport,
many spectators in the pre-
vious series have had to travel
up to 100 km to and from the
Rhode Island venue. □

The older generation
takes up the gauntlet
“Icebergs" line up at Bondi: the “broken-down athletes” still swim all year round
The ranks of Australia’s elderly are swelling but increasingly, too, retirement is not
seen as the end of the line. Attitude is vital and those who have it right are
pioneering new roles for the senior citizen. GLENDA THOMPSON reports.
THE BROWN old men are eager to be
helpful. “Lend you a cozzie?” they say
as they shiver round the pool. The
Bondi Icebergs Club pool looks green
and inviting but only to photograph
from the corner where we huddle out of
the wind, catching a little weak Sydney
sunshine. The big rollers come straight
in from the Pacific, slopping over the
edge of the pool, keeping it chillingly
topped up.
The five men swimming and crouch-
ing for our photographer are all in their
70s. The youngest, Mick Burke (73) de-
scribes them as “all broken-down ath-
letes.” But they swim every day of the
year and race on Sundays. “Icebergs”
are better known for winter swimming
but they keep going in the summer too.
“We’re all from surf lifesaving
clubs,” says Keith King (74), formerly
the manufacturer of California Choco-
lates. Reg Cameron, George Caddy and
Frank Humphrey (all 75) kid each other
“Everyone got their teeth in?” as
the shutter clicks.
“You’ve got to get up and get going,”
says Humphrey; “it’s hard physically
but you’ve got to make up your mind.”
These men are making a good fist of
their retirement years. They stay fit and
they stay interested.
Eminent physicist Sir Mark Oliphant
(83) summed it up when he told The
Bulletin-. “Keep going ... I think that’s
the only thing. The biggest fault that old
people can make is to give up working,
give up doing something that’s creative
and that they enjoy. I’m not talking


about playing golf; it might be writing
or reading or doing handiwork of some
kind. My hobby, for instance, is silver
jewellery.” Oliphant also launches
books and talks on technology.
In an ageing Australia, attitude is rel-
evant. Due to a lower birthrate and bet-
ter life expectancy, the older generation
makes up a bigger proportion of the
community than ever before.
The number of Australians over 65
years of age will jump by 50 percent by
the turn of the century. Lengthening life
spans and earlier retirement have
created a new social order. Today’s
oldies are pioneers of a role beyond
parent and worker.
It can be argued they are richer,
healthier and more independent than
their predecessors. That they are more
assertive has been measured by re-
sponses in the assets test debate. Politi-
cians particularly those whose elec-
torates attract retirees are recognising
grey power’s political clout. (See story
page 104.)
After the glorification of youth in the
1960 s and early 70s, the pendulum has
swung to a new interest in the ageing.
Whether old age becomes “a tremen-
dous opportunity for freedom or a dis-
mal stage where one has lost control of
one’s life” is surprisingly dependent on
attitude, according to gerontologist Dr
Hal Kendig. Kendig, who co-ordinates
the Ageing and the Family Project at the
Australian National University in Can-
berra, says that life expectancy is lm-
proving rapidly.
He says: “In the six years from 1976,
the life expectancy at 65 for women in-
creased a full year and for men 0.8
years. That is a dramatic leap - for
reasons we do not fully understand.”
Kendig says that life expectancy
jumped around the end of last century
with the control of infectious diseases
and fewer women dying in childbirth.
“That the latest increase is due to better
medicine is a fiction, though we have
more control of hypertension and car-
diovascular disease,” he says. “People
are healthier, both by exercising and by
controlling their eating and drinking
and smoking. But the group eftect otthe
people now old is that they had a ditter-
ent life experience from previous gener-
ations. .
Living longest is related to class. Ac-
cording to Kendig the reason upper-
middle classes live onger than working
classes is the cumulative effect of better
living conditions and education,
Relatively few Aborigines survive to
old age because, he says they are sti
products of a pre-public health era.
Migrants as a whole have good
scores, though the explanation could be
that the type of individual who migrates
tends to be more vigorous anyway,
Old people keep sharp minds and
healthy bodies by maintaining a sense
of self-esteem and purpose in life,
Kendig “And what or
that is much the same as for anyo
else: They need an opportunity to com
tribute and sufficient income to do and
have the things we all take for granted
The early
bird’s diet
A BRISBANE accountant,
Charles Viertel (82) has tried
to sleep in to 4.40 am but finds
that his “nature” makes him
rise an hour earlier than that.
He formed the habit of
awaking early during years of
study.
“I don’t drink or smoke. A
colleague said I live an aus-
tere life but I think I have lots
of fun,” says Viertel.
Said to be the biggest indi-
vidual investor in Australia,
this self-made millionaire’s
enjoyment comes from
playing the stock market. He
spends a lot of time reading
company reports and finance
news and hours on the tele-
phone to brokers.
“I’ve got a big cash flow,”
he says. He has been spending
on ANZ, National Bank and
North Queensland Telecasters
stock. He has also bought
Hardie, Humes, ACI and
OPSM recently. He made a
killing reputedly $5 million
when he sold out of LNC
Industries in March.
Viertel will not say how ac-
curate are reports that put his
Charles Viertel: “I have lots of fun”
SHAR ADAMS
fortune at $4O million. “What
you’re worth this morning
you’re not this afternoon,” he
chuckles.
His advice for others is to
eat bran and never retire ...
“I tried to retire in 1972 but
now I’m working harder than
ever. I still do the accounts of
some old clients who want me
to, mainly widows, and I own
the stationery firm J. Hooker
and Co.”
He made a study of diet
more than 20 years ago when
he set about losing 32kg from
his 167 cm frame. Eating bran
has kept him in good condi-
tion, he says “right for an-
other 60 years.”


such as transport, a telephone, giving
gifts.
“It is vital not to give in to the nega-
tive stereotype of the old as infirm, piti-
ful, withdrawn. People who deny
they’re old adjust the best.
“Three-quarters of older people own
their homes and only 15 percent of the
over-65s are substantially disabled, so
it’s not hard to be optimistic.”
Kendig says that most people enter-
ing old age remain sexually active and
capable. Decline in activity is linked to
lack of opportunity, such as widow-
hood, and to concepts of attractiveness.
He sees a basic human rights violation
where children have the right of veto
over a parent’s sex life in some nursing
homes.
“It is recognised that an important
part of an old person’s happiness is
based on whether he or she has a con-
fidante someone to share personal
thoughts with.” Kendig says there are
two schools of thought about social in-
teraction: the first says that older people
naturally withdraw from contact with
others as a preparation for death; the
other that, the more involved a person
is, the happier.
Dr Tom O’Neill, head of rehabilita-
tion and geriatrics at Royal North
Shore Hospital in Sydney, believes that
age brings the freedom and confidence
to try new activities. “People often come
to things they’ve always wanted, like
Grandma Moses and her art, at a time
when they have the confidence to be
different,” he says.
“When people were young, they
might have had to be extroverts to
tackle creative fields. Now they are
older, they might have the time and de-
termination to do their own thing.
“You see lots of retired people be-
coming involved in local government
and so on.”
O’Neill says that the elderly today
have more opportunities than did any
previous such generation.
Authorities are divided on whether
the elderly are better off financially.
The 1972-73 poverty survey put 36
percent of single men of 65 and over, 31
percent of single women aged 60 and
over and 5 percent of old couples under
the Henderson poverty line. No com-
parative study has been done since but
another set of figures compiled in 1981-
82 had the corresponding groups at 13
percent, 8.4 percent and 3.8 percent
poor, respectively, after accounting for
housing costs.
Dr John McCallum of the Ageing
and the Family Project says that old
people are both better off at the upper
income levels and worse off at the bot-
tom of the tree.
He says that, although the number of
people getting lump sum superannu-
ation is twice what it was 10 years ago,
the sum often is $5OOO or $lO,OOO which
does not go a long way. Public servants
are a group of their own as far as super-
annuation pay-outs go, he says.
As to becoming doddery, memory
loss, mental deterioration, confusion
and disorientation (often called senility)
do affect more of us as we age.
O’Neill says that the symptoms can
represent an incorrect drug or nutrient
intake or depression rather than brain
disease and that the condition can be
improved.
Alzheimer’s disease, in which physi-
cal changes in the brain cut mental
function, affects an estimated 6 percent
of people over 65.
For the over 80s, this increases to 20
percent.
O’Neill says: “The minute a person
forgets something, the purists say it’s the
beginning of Alzheimer’s. That may be
so but it also may be as bad as that per-
son will get. It is important he accepts it
and looks for aids to help him remem-
ber.”
Psychologists recognise several types
of intelligence. Crystalline intelligence
is said to grow with age it has to do
with judgment and insight. Fluid intelli-
gence, involved with abstract relation-
Keeping his
hand in
FLYING is important to Syd-
ney’s Joseph Palmer (83). He
has a commercial licence and
only recently relinquished his
single-seater fighter plane. He
owns a Beechcraft five-seater
and takes it out regularly.
Palmer spent more than
five years in the air force in
World War II but had learned
to fly in 1926. His first licence
was number 65 in Australia.
“I got my commercial li-
cence in 1928 and flew for
North Queensland Airways
for a while in 1939,” he says.
He has flown overseas a lot
since ferrying aircraft from
Burma to Ethiopia as recently
as in 1978.
He is keen on gliding and
has represented Australia in
rifle shooting. His last para-
chute jump was about 1960
when he wanted to cut travel-
ling time from Bankstown air-
port, where he was to repair

an aircraft, to Newport where
he was due to take part in an
old-timers’ yacht race.
Palmer is active in the fam-
ily stock and share broking
firm Joseph Palmer and Sons
which he joined in 1917. His
grandfather started it. The tra-
dition continues as one of
Palmer’s three daughters is a
consultant to the company
and a member of the stock ex-
change.
Palmer says that he does
not drink or smoke and that
the physical work he puts in at
his Tamworth cattle property
probably keeps him fit. (The
family also runs cattle in
England).
“A lot of our clients who
retire at 45 or 50 don’t last
long,” he says. “They don’t
have enough to occupy their
minds. By the same token,
others who retire but keep
busy are quite happy.
“I can’t profess to give ad-
vice. I’m no expert and I
wouldn’t want to appear to
skite but the main thing is not
to get bored.” □

‘Trying to
be useful’
LORNA HAYTER’S drive
was interrupted when she was
mugged this year. She was
walking to a car in Sydney
after a women’s club meeting
when a bag snatcher knocked
her down. She had broken
bones and a stretch in hospital
but is getting back to her com-
munity activities.
The tiny 86-year-old was
nominated for 1983 NSW
Senior Citizen of the Year for
her work for others. The
Council on the Ageing
praised her activities for the
Red Cross and for the Young
Women’s Christian Associa-
tion in particular. She is pa-
tron of the Australian
Women’s Army Service.
“I drive my car around to
groups and tell them about
my life; that’s about the only
useful thing I do these days,”
she says.
Hayter was one of the first
two women graduates in agri-
cultural science in Australia.
Hayter says that academics
tried to put them off the

course by saying it would in-
clude some practical farming,
tossing hay and milking cows,
“something ladies would not
like.”
“ ‘Yes we would,’ we said.”
She taught, then joined the
Agricultural department
setting up a leadership train-
ing scheme for rural adults.
She had a radio show on the
ABC for 13 years and was
women’s editor of The Land.
She was a major in the
women’s army during the war
and edited the War Widows
Digest until recently.
She married a sea captain
but he died of appendicitis
only four years later.
After she retired, in 1971,
she researched history for the
Bank of NSW Westpac) and
went to China at the request
of women’s organisations.
Hayter believes in “taking
life as it comes and trying to
be useful as long as you
don’t make too much of a fool
of yourself.
“1 hope 1 haven’t talked
too much. I suppose, with old
people, there is sometimes a
bit of grain to be got from all
that chaff.”
Grey power
flexes its
muscles
STAN DUNCAN is the self-labelled
founder of grey power in Australia, or-
ganiser of the elderly. He wants a better
deal for old people and those who have
retired.
Duncan and his group, VOTE (Voice
Of The Elderly), want assets test propo-
sals dropped. They want the aged pen-
sion increased and pegged to 30 percent
of average weekly earnings. They say
they are prepared to shop around to get
results.
“We will put pressure on politicians
to keep their promises,” says Duncan.

“We are not aligned with any party. The
four major parties have ignored the
aged.”
Duncan says that VOTE, started in
NSW in 1979, is the lobby arm of the
Council for the Ageing and has spread
in most states. He stood in a House of
Representatives by-election for the Syd-
ney seat of Grayndler in 1979 and this
election is standing for St George under
the banner Aged Action. However, he
says: “VOTE doesn’t aim to field candi-
dates. We’re a ginger group. We serve
notice to politicians that they had better
measure up or they’re out. We invite
candidates to explain their promises
and then we watch how they perform.”
Duncan says that elderly people are
relinquishing old party loyalties and
banding together to fight for their wel-
fare. He says they represent a potential
25 percent of the voting force.
“Even the relatives of the aged are
getting angry about the assets test. I’ve
been on talkback radio round Australia
and I’ve not found one person who sup-
ports it. The most vehement opposition
comes from former ALP card-carriers.
“The resentment against (Prime Min-
ister) Hawke is really solid and I think it
will project in election results.”
Duncan says the aged “don’t trust
Hawke any more. He said he would
raise the (aged) pension but nothing’s
been done about it.
“He said he’d make sure the pension
consumer price index adjustments
would be paid within one month. They
used to be paid within three months;
under Hawke, that’s gone up to four
months and you don’t get the increase
retrospectively so we’re losing a lot of
money.
“(Social Security minister Don)
Grimes said the computers were anach-
ronistic and couldn’t catch up or some
such nonsense.
“Grimes himself denied any assets
test was being contemplated by the gov-
ernment about one week before they in-
troduced it. They never said anything
about it before because they would
never have got aged people’s support in
the election.
“The Liberal Party isn’t lily white,
either. The year before last, they tried to
screw everybody down by saying you
could only have so much in your cheque
account. Fred Chaney asked me to ar-
range a meeting for him to explain to
people what he wanted. When he saw
the reaction, he buried it. It was a pater-
nalistic move a form of assets test
whether you like it or not.
“(Opposition leader) Peacock says, if
he gets power, he’ll repeal the assets test
legislation but what he’s not saying is
what would take its place.”
Duncan pauses for breath and says
wryly: “I’m a 65-year-old bloke who
should be taking it easy but I’m not I
think it’s worth fighting to give the aged
a sense of security they’re not getting.
Let’s have a moratorium on the whole
thing and take two or three years to get
it together properly.”
Governments make the mistake of
taking an institutional attitude to old
people, Duncan says. He claims that a
third of nursing home inmates are there
only because they have nowhere else to
go./‘I argue that we must maintain them
within their homes, rather than let them
run down to the point where they’ve got
to go into a nursing home.
“The McLeay (bipartisan federal
parliamentary) report said we spend as
much on the 3 percent of the people in
nursing homes as we do on the 95 per-
cent living in their own homes.
“We want more spent on home sup-
port services such as community nurs-
ing, meals on wheels, shopping services
and this type of thing. We need respite
centres where people can go when they
become ill or the people caring for them
need a month or two break then the
elderly can return to their normal en-
vironment.
“You’re looking at a pretty bright,
intelligent, experienced group of
people. The aged today are not what
they were 10 years ago. They’re much
more active, more alive.”
Glenda Thompson
Still in
the running
BILL EMPEY (88) started
running seriously when he
was 85. He competes in reg-
ular world veterans’ meets in
100 m and 400 m sprints and
the skm walk. He finished sec-
ond in the 100 m to a Swedish
athlete in Puerto Rico last
year. Empey’s time was
around 22 seconds.
“There are not too many
competitors in the 85 to 89 age
group,” he says.
One of the few in that
category competing in Austra-
lia, Empey got into the sport
through his brother Val: “He
is 89 but he has been out for
the past 12 months with ham-
string injuries.
“I was never this serious
about sport in my youth. I
didn’t compete in athletics but
I played football and cricket
and I took up golf at 70.
Empey has gone close to
breaking that difficult barrier
Bill Empey: running out of competitors
KEITH BARLOW
of doing a round of golf in
fewer strokes than his years
and he still hopes to do so.
He lives with his daughter
and son-in-law (his wife died
18 years ago) and tries to keep
up-to-date with the literature
in his fields of expertise, food
technology and animal sci-
ence. A graduate from Mel-
bourne University, Empey
was a veterinary officer in
World War 1 and worked
with the CSIRO for 35 years.
He believes in developing
a variety of physical and men-
tal interests, even though he is
rather single-minded about
running. He finished the 14km
City to Surf run in August. He
has taken part for the past
four years.
“I train about four days a
week. Some days I jog Bkm or
so and other days I concen-
trate on sprinting for half-an-
hour. I never dreamt, four or
five years ago, I would take up
something like this. I hope to
compete in the 90 to 94 age
group if I’m still around.”


The new Ricoh XR-P The first program camera
with the brains to let you be creative.
The trouble with program
cameras up to now has been that they
always thought they knew best. That
shooting perfect pictures was simply a
matter ofmatching apertures with
shutter speeds. And CLICK.
The Ricoh XR-P is much smarter.
It realises that taking good, memorable
pictures is a personal thing. That you
should analyse each situation ana
decide exacdy how you want to take
the picture. Only then will the XR-P’s
advanced brain step in to make sure
you get a perfect photograph. Every
time. Under any conditions.
Action
Say you’re at the car races and
you want to freeze Peter Brock as he
flashes by. Nothing to it. You just set the
program selector to PA and the brain
instandy knows it must pick the fastest
practical speed. Up to l/2000th second.
An LCD in the viewfinder will tell you
the brain’s choice. Then just aim,
squeeze and presto! You’ve stopped
Brockie dead in his treads.
Aside from sporting events and
other action situations, the PA mode is
also useful in negating camera move-
ment when you’re using long lenses.
Depth
When you’re shooting close-ups
or scenic vistas which require
maximum sharpness and depth of
field, set the selector to PD. The brain
will then choose the smallest practical
aperture to bring both the foreground
and background into the sharpest
possible focus.
Normal
Naturally, we also provide a
program mode for shooting ordinary
subjects under ordinary conditions.
Just like ordinary program cameras.
Greater Creativity
Chances are, the more pictures
you take, the more creative you’ll want

to be. So the XR-P has been developed
to let you develop.
Aperture Priority, the most
popular mode among the pros, allows
you to select the f/stop that will give
you however much depth of field you
want. The XR-P’s brain automatically
matches the aperture with the correct
shutter speed.
And vice versa. With shutter bias
you can either stop a fast-moving
subject cold or introduce a bit of blur
to suggest the movement. In each
instance, the brain automatically
calculates the appropriate aperture.
The 300 P Speealite gives even more
creative effects.
If you really want to give vent to
your creativity, full manual hands over
full control.
Incidentally, you can use any of
these modes with films ranging in
speed from ASA/ISO 12 to 3200.
The Brain
The secret be-
hind ail this versatility
(and a lot more
besides) is Ricoh’s
exclusive 4K ROM
microprocessor.
With as much power as a pocket
calculator, the XR-P brain offers
capabilities far beyond other program
cameras.
Such innovation isn’t surprising
when you consider that Ricoh is one of
the few camera manufacturers
producing their own LSI circuitry.
Still more Functions
Its superior brainpower also
enables the XR-P to feature the world’s
first TV mode for taking quality stills of
a TV or CRT picture.
The new XR-P Speedlite 300 P
unit provides full AE tnrough-the-lens
flash and simple daylight flash in a
combination ofseven different modes.
At any f/stop.
The Silicon Photo Diode
metering element is responsive
enough to automatically compensate
for sunsets, backlighting and other
tricky conditions.
When the exposure of your
subject differs markedly from its
background, the AE Memory Lock lets
you take an accurate reading in close
and then memorises it until you step
back and shoot.
Plus
As if all these features were not
enough, the Ricoh XR-P also boasts
options like motor drive, a data back,
three ultra-bright viewfinder screens
and a wide variety of quality lenses.
Low Price
Now for the clincher. Because of
longstanding Ricoh policy, all this ex-
cellence comes at a very affordable price!
The XR-P isn’t the only one
with brains.

Beijingi‘ the city is
now begfn'nlng to
take on a modern
look
FREDERIC LEWIS/AUSTRAL INTERNATIONAL
The changes began striking PAMELA TAN* from the time
she returned to Beijing. Through the new-found air pollution,
she sees much promise in the modernisation of China.
IT WAS THE TIDE of
world affairs which carried
me back to Beijing. The
need for trade, the devel-
opment of technology and
modern information have
broken down the last bar-
riers between Australia
and the “yellow peril” of
the 40s and 50s.
Australians of the 80s
possess an unprecedented
understanding, awareness
and tolerance of the Pacific
and Asian region. And
Chinese are becoming in-
creasingly aware of Aus-
tralia, her history, culture and people.
We flew in on a balmy evening.
Friends and relatives had written to tell
me that things were much improved. I
had been there most recently in 1981
and I was a little apprehensive.
An old friend met me and the drive
of some 30km into Beijing itself took us
through new streets, new overpasses,
past new high-rise buildings through
a Beijing 1 had never known.
I remember when we stood on Lon-
gevity Hill in the Summer Palace and
looked east toward the city 10km away.
The landmark on a clear day was the
White Dagoba, built in the 17th century.
Today, it is veiled by pollution and the
city landscape is beginning to look like
a central business district. Beijing is
taking on a modern look and not only
in its structure.
The traffic is congested and hazard-
ous. In the 60s, the back road to the
Summer Palace was as quiet as any
Pamela Tan
country road. Cars seldom
went there; if they did, it
was only to pass mule-
drawn carts plodding
rhythmically along with
nodding drivers at the
reins. This time, when the
mini-bus took the back
road, we were literally
bumper to bumper. Per-
haps needless to say, there
were no mule-drawn carts.
Housing construction
has increased greatly. The
tall new apartment build-
ings are a short-term
answer for a burgeoning
city population of nine million in
Beijing. The three-room apartments,
with kitchen and bathroom, are still
small by Australian standards for a fam-
ily of three or four people but a great
improvement compared with what
people had in China.
“Some foreigners say that these new
apartment buildings are ugly and don’t
make Beijing look a picturesque
Chinese city any more,” I told my for-
mer housekeeper who is as sharp-
tongued as ever at 74 years of age.
“Hmph,” she snorted. foreign-
ers want to, they can live in my pictur-
esque hut without a toilet and I’ll move
into their ugly apartment!”
What I liked about the city was a new
emphasis on greenery. Lawns, roses, jas-
mine, hibiscus, pomegranate - real
Beijing taste were planted liberally,
plus celosia and canna lilies, the fiery
red flowers of which brightened dusty
Beijing.
My deepest impressions, however,
were of my friends. I had not seen them
so relaxed and at ease since the Cultural
Revolution. “Even your wrinkles seem
smoother,” I joked with one.
The reason was not just that some of
them had been promoted or because of
* PAMELA TAN is an Australian-born
Chinese who lived in China for 27 years until
1979 when she began studying for an honors
degree in Political Science at the Australian
National University. She recently re-visited

the obvious improvement in standard of
living or even the important fact that
their children had found jobs; the
reason was that the political hounding
of intellectuals had stopped and those
who made a career out of it and never
really learned a profession were no
longer in positions of power.
Perhaps for the first time in Chinese
history, the government recognises the
need for intellectuals and the proper
utilisation of all talent.
Intellectuals are receiving greater
political trust even to the point of let-
ting them travel abroad alone be they
Communist Party members or not. That
would have been unthinkable in the 50s
and impossible in the 60s when most
intellectuals were laboring in the
countryside.
Non-communists are being
promoted, others who had “compli-
cated” class backgrounds (relatives in
Taiwan or elsewhere abroad) and others
again who in 1957 were dubbed “right-
ists”** are attaining positions com-
mensurate with their ability. An
example of this is Jiang Ping, vice-presi-
dent of the China University of Law
and Political Science.
A graduate of Civil Law from Mos-
cow University, he arrived back in
Beijing in 1957 and for a statement such
as “I think there is something in the
Yugoslav workers committees” was
**A political movement aimed at anyone who
was supposed to advocate anything anti-social-
ist or anti-communist, definition of which was
quite arbitrary.
branded a rightist. What followed was
more than 20 years of ignominy, per-
sonal disaster and social ostracisation.
Only the toughest could have survived
but he made it and today, with a deeper
understanding of human nature, chan-
nels his energies toward establishment
of a proper and sound legal system in
China.
The need to deploy China’s talent to
its modernisation is all too pressing.
The structural reforms of the present
government are trying to lay the institu-
tional basis for modernisation. Reforms
such as career mobility and changes in
the wage structure are essential. Wages
for intellectuals are low, especially for
teachers at all levels, and a particular
source of complaint.
The increased roles of intellectuals
and their general social advancement
are meeting resistance from some old
professional revolutionaries distressed
at seeing the world they knew pass by
them and themselves as has-beens.
Their resistance is fortunately not an or-
ganised one and becomes increasingly
difficult to establish in the currents of a
trend toward education. But more than
20 years of neglect have taken their toll
and sloppy work habits and discipline
and a general apathy have corroded the
workforce. Only changes in the wage
system to reward merit can change this.
This is the trend. A recent survey made
by a Guangzhou University of young
workers in the special economic zone of
Shenzhen revealed that most were re-
turning to study to improve their work
qualifications in order to get higher
wages and remain employed.
The individual workers,
too, have a new respect. In a
few years, they have become a
necessary addition to the
economy and play a flexible
and useful role in society.
China had enormous
shortages of everything. You
literally had to depend upon
“knowing people” to have
anything done. The state ran
the only stores and, since the
start of the Cultural Revol-
ution, their attitude to the
people has been rather callous
some individuals aside. I
found life made easier by the
individual enterprises.
When I arrived back in
Beijing, a niece said: “Fancy
coming from Australia and
not perming your hair. Come
on, I’ll take you to a hair-
dresser’s. She’s an individual
worker and does a good job,
better and cheaper than the
state shops.”
“Your hair does look
dreadful,” agreed the hair-
dresser. An attractive woman
in her mid-40s, she used to work in a
state shop but has set up business at
home with all the trappings. She told me
that she earned an average 200 yuan a
month but, knowing Chinese, I guess it
is probably more like the 300 mark (one
always makes understatements when it
comes to such sensitive issues). In any
case, even her estimate of income is
more than double an associate pro-
fessor’s wage.
I wanted a blouse made up for a
friend and, in three days, it was done
exactly as my friend wanted it for
about $2.
I went with friends to privately run
restaurants where the food was tasty, at-
mosphere pleasant, service good. They
were perhaps just a little more expens-
ive than the state restaurants where the
food is average, atmosphere noisy, ser-
vice lousy and the tables dirty.
“The government gets a good deal
out of it, too,” said the hairdresser.
“They get taxes out of us, we pay them
every month, the people get service ...
What more do you want?”
Not only is the individual economy
an important addition to the economy;
it also is an important channel for job
opportunities.
About 39.16 million people were
found jobs from 1979 to 1983. A min-
ority went into the state enterprises,
most into collective enterprises and 2.16
million became employed as individual
workers.
Some six million urban youths a year
have to be found jobs and the state can-
not employ them all.

A Beijing shoe repairer: individual workers give better service and quality
PAMELA TAN
Through bank loans, they are able to
set themselves up in business and some
160,000 people were granted 150 million
yuan (about $6B million) in loans last
year.
“Are you worried at all that the poli-
cies might change,” I asked a young
shoe repairer. “So what?” was his
answer. “If they do, I’ll still repair
shoes. The privileged ones will still be
privileged but, I tell you, only when the
people are well off can a country be well
off.”
Three things annoyed me during my
stay in Beijing. The first was the un-
couth ill-manners of men in the trolleys,
buses and underground.
There certainly are charming, well-
mannered Chinese men but the over-
bearing and almost unconscious male
chauvinism that continues to prevail
irked me deeply.
In four weeks of daily travel by pub-
lic transport, I saw only two men stand
up for women with babies. Normally, it
is other women who give their seats to
those with babies and to elderly people.
The young, strong men dash for vacated
seats. This, too, is a side-effect of the
Cultural Revolution in which real fam-
ily life was destroyed and the education
of children in traditional Chinese man-
ners and etiquette neglected.
To be fair, I must add that many
young women also are uncouth and ill-
mannered for the same reason.
My second source of irritation was,
sadly, the small children. I saw them on
the buses, in the parks, in restaurants, at
the dentist’s, in friends’ homes
spoiled, wilful, ill-mannered brats doted
upon by four grandparents and two
parents. This is a consequence of the
one-child family.
A study in the behaviour of 1000 kin-
dergarten and primary school children
aged four to six years found that only-
children generally were egocentric
while those with siblings exhibited posi-
tive social behaviour.
Chinese child psychologists studying
these problems consider the be-
havioural problems of only-children are
to be remedied through education in-
cluding education of family elders in
how to love the children. One dreads to
think of the social fabric of Chinese so-
ciety 20 years hence if work in that field
cannot be stepped up.
But my greatest source of irritation
was the service sector.
Before I left China for Australia, as
an ordinary Chinese woman, I used to
become exasperated but I was ac-
climatised. This time, coming from Aus-
tralia, I found it positively intolerable.
Take for instance the young women in
an art studio which I visited. They wore
unbecoming western-style suits and
even more unbecoming bored facial ex-
pressions. They appeared to know
nothing about the art they had to sell, or
even any interest in it. Before the Cul-
tural Revolution, the assistants knew
the art and every painting had a story to
be told.
Making money to escape poverty is
something upon which all Chinese
agree but, in the race to do this, the
quality of many things in China has
gone down. As I pointed out
to some hotel attendants:
“You’re keen to charge inter-
national prices but you’re not
too keen on providing service
at an international standard.”
Tiled floors in some hotels
are grotty, ceramic wall tiles
mouldy and exquisitely em-
broidered silk bedspreads
have become dirty rags. As-
sistants in state shops yell
across the counters at each
other as they serve. Customers
receive indifference.
How can these sloppy
habits be changed?
“If you want to complain,”
one young man said to me,
“complain to the Premier.”
“Could he make you all
improve your work, your atti-
tude?” I questioned. “He
could raise our wages,” the
young man answered.
Apart from that, a rigid
system of training, manage-
ment and inspection is
needed. I flew to Beijing on
Qantas and booked to return
on CAAC. The staff of the
Chinese airline were friendly enough
but it lacked the professional finesse
required of an international cabin crew.
“The thing is, they don’t have to com-
pete with Qantas,” a friend told me, “so,
why bother about strict training?”
Steeped in traditional but outdated
notions over all the years of isolation,
many Chinese still do not know how the
rest of the world works. Some officials
simply refuse to listen to criticism and
come out with bald statements such as:
“Listen to them! We can do anything
that any western foreigner can.”
I do not think that anyone in the west
doubts the capability of the Chinese
people. But a stumbling-block is some
officials’ stubborn refusal to learn. If
you cannot deliver the goods, what is
the point of being proud just because
you are Chinese?
Hopefully, the new policies will her-
ald the end of peasant egalitarianism
and false national pride.
One country, two systems, is the pol-
icy which plans to incorporate Hong
Kong and perhaps Taiwan with a diver-
sified system of economic ownership.
It is a bold experiment! Will it work?
Maybe it will, if only because these poli-
cies have popular support on the main-
land.
In any case, the momentum of these
policies has begun and there is no turn-
ing back. “Call it what you like,” said
one of my friends, a young engineer ...
“socialism, communism, capitalism ...
What’s important is that the people are
prosperous and happy. After all, what’s
in a name?” □

The People's Republic of China will soon

the Belgian government.
Together they formed a
joint venture company to
handle the transfer of tech-
nology for the world’s most
advanced digital telecommu-
nications switching system,
ITT System 12.™
With the full approval of
the United States and
Belgian governments, this
contract will help set a new
standard for telephone
systems in China.
After first importing
100,000 equivalent lines,
China will then produce up
to 300,000 equivalent lines
of System 12 a year.
But it’s not the digital
equipment alone that will
help the People’s Republic
of China meet the increased demand for telecommunications.
It’s the System 12 technology itself, a patented process called fully
distributed control.
It uses many microprocessors in a modular design to control the
network, rather than a large central computer.
So more lines or service can be added easily and economically. Without
upsetting the entire system as it grows.
Fully distributed control is an outgrowth of over $7OO million in research
and development by ITT engineers all over the world.
It’s also why the People’s Republic of China is one of 18 countries that
has ordered System 12.
It’s the kind of trade agreement that would have made Marco Polo proud

PHILLIP ADAMS
Zimbabwe keeps its goal in sight
TWO RACIST jokes, popular with
whites in southern Africa ... the first
from Johannesburg, the second from
Zimbabwe. The differences between the
cities and the jokes may seem subtle
but they reveal their worlds of differ-
ence.
South African joke
A WEALTHY South African returns to
Johannesburg after a couple of years
away. He is collected from the airport
by a friend in his new Mercedes. The car
is much admired for its styling, its com-
fort, the dials on the dash. As they drive
toward the city, the passenger asks
about the insignia on the bonnet:
“What’s it for?”
“I’ll show you,” says the proud own-
er, lining up the three-pointed star on a
black on a pedestrian crossing. The dri-
ver accelerates toward the terrified
black, swerving away at the last second.
There is, nonetheless, a dull thud.
“You’ll have to send this car back to
the dealer,” says the passenger.
“Why?” asks the driver.
“Because your gunsight is badly
aligned. If I hadn’t opened the door, we
wouldn’t have got him.”
Zimbabwe joke
A RHODESIAN returns to the airport
after a couple of years away. He is un-
aware of major political changes.
Climbing off the plane, he says: “Boy!
Take my luggage. Ah, it’s good to be
back in Rhodesia.”
The black replies: “Sir, you are not
back in Rhodesia. This is now Zimbab-
we.”
Expressing consternation, the white
recovers his composure and says: “Boy,
get me a taxi. I want to go into
Salisbury.”
The black replies: “Sir, Salisbury is
no more. The city is now called Harare.
And while we’re about it, sir, you
shouldn’t be calling me ‘Boy’.”
“What the hell should I be calling
you?” says the infuriated white.
“You should be calling me ‘Com-
rade’.”
“What’s ‘Comrade’ mean, then?”
“I believe it’s Russian for ‘Kaffir’.”
JOHANNESBURG is intractable. Five
million strong, the whites are armed
with everything from napalm to nuclear
weapons. Some of the whites are pro-
gressive and willing to negotiate but the
hard-line, Bible- thumping Boer knows
that God is behind him.
The Rhodesians, however,
are no more. They have be-
come Zimbabweans, living in
and largely reconciled to their
Marxist-Leninist state well,
at least, a notionally Marxist-
Leninist state. For all the min-
isterial rhetoric, most of the
comrades in cabinet seem to
be successful business entre-
preneurs.
Prime Minister Mugabe
keeps issuing directives to his
colleagues requiring ideologi-
cal purity but they do not take
a lot of notice not when so
much money may be made
from hotels, transport com-
panies and farms.
The President, the Rever-
end Banana (please, no jokes
about banana republics),
meanwhile issues statements
about the urgent need to collectivise the
farms. Ignoring the tragic mistakes of
Soviet collectivisation, ignoring the
painful and expensive failure of a simi-
lar policy in China, Zimbabwe’s
Marxist-Leninists seem determined to
make their own mistakes.
Mind you, Banana’s real passion is
for soccer not for politics.,! sit beside
him at the Cairo-Zimbabwe soccer final.
I subsequently learn from Barry Cohen,
who visited the Banana residence a few
years back, that Mrs President insists on
washing the team’s footy jumpers per-
sonally.
THE WHITES who have stayed on in
Zimbabwe still manage to preserve the
Rhodesian lifestyle by living more or
less beneath a glass dome. They have
large homes, large incomes, large comp-
lements of black staff.
Even if Zimbabwe television ran on
two channels (which it does not), these
whites would hardly need a remote con-
trol. To adjust the telly’s volume (or to
draw the curtains or to pass the crisps),
they simply yell in the direction of the
kitchen and Happy Black Sambo comes
trotting in. Worst still, five- and six-
year-old kids do likewise rather than
toddle out for a refill of Coke.
The Harare Country Club and the
golf clubs are integrated and most white
businesses reluctantly employ the odd
black in middle management but the
erstwhile Rhodesians stick pretty much
to themselves and they are oddly unin-
formed about black life and black cul-
ture.
Exhibit A. I comment on the num-
bers of blacks who, charmingly, stop in
the street and formally shake hands. I
am told that the handshake is somewhat
Masonic, that it communicates the most
subtle tribal information. When I ques-
tion black friends about this, they roar
with laughter: “Did they really say that?
Jesus Christ, we’re just shaking hands.”
Exhibit B. When I tell white friends
that I picked up a dozen or more black
hitchhikers while driving around the
country, they express shock and horror
I am asking to be mugged, to be mur-
dered. It is, allegedly, an everyday oc-
currence.
I ask well-informed blacks about this
form of road toll and they shake their
heads in disbelief: “It’s never happened.
Never, not once.”
Exhibit C. Noticing that Banana is a
Methodist and Mugabe a Catholic (an-
other contradiction, in this “Marxist-
Leninist” state), I ask whites whether
the old black religions survive. “Not a
skerrick,” they tell me. “They’ve all
gone.”
But blacks confirm the power of the
witchdoctor, whose herbal treatments
are recognised under the National
Health, and discuss as complex a myth-
ology and mysticism as anywhere else in
Africa or, for that matter, on Earth.
The whites speak English, having at
best half-a-dozen pre-emptory sen-
tences in the dominant vernacular
Shona. I find this the most astonishing
manifestation of the “glass dome” men-
tality and remind whites that Czar
Nicholas’ court spoke French and


never, never, Russian, before the revol-
ution.
Mind you, the Zimbabwe govern-
ment is hardly more interested in the
vernacular than is the white elite.
English is to be the official language and
all aspects of tribalism are seen as nega-
tive, backward.
Zimbabwean whites are careful to
avoid overt racism. Undercover signals
abound but they are not much worse
than the racism which you would find
among upwardly mobile Australian
whites.
Given that they are left alone to run
their farms and businesses, the
Zimbabwean whites are more or less
reconciled to living in a black man’s
country not that they wouldn’t like to
get out; the problem is that it would cost
them too much money. The most each
would be allowed to take out of Zim-
babwe is $lOOO.
“We’re kings in the land of the
kaffir,” explains a white millionaire,
“but we’d be kaffirs in the land of the
king.”
I TALK TO the pilot of a light aircraft
who takes people over the Victoria
Falls. He remembers the day freedom
fighters fired a missile at him. Missing
the heat of his engine, it homed in on
the air-conditioning ducts of the nearby
white country club and blew the place
sky high. Now it sits on the top of the
tallest hill near the falls, a ghostly
Xanadu, a ruin for the future.
Some black friends suggest that we
go camping overnight but I am less than
enthusiastic. A few days
earlier, a family had watched
helplessly as a lion wandered
into their tent and munched
their youngest child. Instead,
I opt for the familiar luxuries
of the Holiday Inn which is
Harare’s newest hotel. It is an
Identikit Holiday Inn: Once
inside the door, you are any-
where or nowhere.
But I do drive into the bush
and, ignoring good advice, go
on foot in search of animals.
Keeping downwind, I walk
through a devastated land-
scape where the trees have
leaves like Corn Flakes. Mir-
aculously, some of the ani-
mals survive.
I find myself amid a herd
of horses in football jumpers
(though, on close encounter,
zebras look more like gigantic finger-
prints no two the same). I see gnus,
warthogs and, suddenly in front of me,
a couple of ostriches. With their long
legs and feathers, the birds look like Las
Vegas chorus girls hoofing through the
bush.
Later, I hire a boat and paddle down
river. Baboons inspect me from the
overhanging trees, I see a few enormous
elephants with their map-of-Africa ears,
spraying themselves, and I see (or think
I see) the odd crocodile.
The Nile crocodile was almost ex-
tinct when a couple of whites started
farming them. They grow the ancient
creatures in cement tanks now, releas-
ing a percentage each year into the riv-
ers. Crocodiles have been around for
220 million years, virtually unchanged
for the past 120 million. One suspects
that the only hope for the rest of Af-
rica’s animals is to be similarly
“farmed” and exploited.
I learn that the Zimbabwean govern-
ment has “culled” 2000 elephants in re-
cent weeks, ostensibly because of the
drought. But the real reason, according
to those in the know, is that a few minis-
ters wanted to make a killing for the
ivory.
THE WORST thing that the new gov-
ernment permitted was the round-up of
2000 “prostitutes.” Shona men were en-
thusiastic hirers of streetwalkers so the
regime, in a mini-cultural revolution,
had everyone from police to Boy Scouts
out making arrests. The trouble was that
most of the women they mobbed were
not prostitutes at all just housewives
or servants of the rich white families,
doing the shopping. They were sent up-
country, to a large camp, with inad-
equate food and water.
Needless to say, the whites were
outraged at the loss of staff and some of
the more progressive white women tried
to form a feminists’ alliance. But, even
with the support of Mrs Banana and
Mrs Mugabe, they got absolutely no-
where. I was told that many of the
women were still in detention 12
months later.
A couple of women are in the Zim-
babwe cabinet but they are there as
widows of national heroes, freedom
fighters killed in the war. Women are a
long, long way from exercising real in-
fluence in black Africa.
MEANWHILE, white women are in-
creasingly unhappy. For all the luxury
of their lives, they know they have no
future. “For me, it’s been a lifetime of
saying goodbye saying goodbye to my
husband on Monday mornings when
he’d go off to the war, saying goodbye to
all our friends as they left the country in
their thousands and now saying
goodbye to our children. This has been
my country my home all my life but
there’s no future for them, so we scrimp
and save so that they can go away to
England or America or Australia where
they’ll have their children. I’m doomed
to stay here forever, hardly ever seeing
them, not knowing my grandchildren.
So, don’t talk to me about the luxuries
of my life, they’re small compensation.”
IN THE END, I found myself liking
most of the Zimbabweans I met ... the
beleaguered whites, the alienated black
middle class, the rather spurious
Marxists with their recycled rhetoric,
the farmers in their kraals.
It is easy to ridicule the newly emer-
ging nations of Africa until you remem-
ber Australia’s social problems and
difficulties, in a land which has had
much more practice at government,
which is far more richly endowed.
Where South Africa is a vast tragic
accident awaiting to happen, Zimbabwe
is at least making a go of it. There might
not be a lot of love around but there is
not much sign of real hatred, neither be-
tween the blacks and the whites nor be-
tween the dominant tribes. You never
know: with a little bit of luck and a little
bit of tolerance, they just might make a
nation out of Zimbabwe. □

Making a raw prawn out of a taxi ride
RON SAW
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN wrong, on
the night, to say that Godfrey Gruss was
intoxicated. Today, in the cold, hard,
unforgiving light of wowsering, it would
be fair to say that he was shickered,
fractured, Dunlop-legged, rocking-
horse-shoed, orry-eyed rotten.
But when a man, a newspaperman
what’s more, has been at the trough for
only five hours he is not intoxicated.
And as Gruss left the pub his dominat-
ing thought was that he should not in-
convenience his fellow man: that some
overworked constable might be worked
still more and made to ask him to blow
into a bag. It occurred to him, too, that
he might not be in the best of shape to
prepare his late supper. So Godfrey
Gruss did what any level-headed fellow
would have done: he went to a Chinese
restaurant, bought about half a gallon of
curried prawns and then hailed a cab.
He had just enough money to get to his
big bachelor apartment on Darling
Point.
The prawns were still hot when he
aimed his key, confidently, at the key-
hole. They were warm when he made
what he estimated to be the 14th pass
and missed. They were at slightly less
than blood heat when he put his bag
down in order to bring both hands to
bear he had been hitting the wall
more often than usual and they were
almost certainly stone cold by the time
Gruss dropped the key, cursed,
scrabbled, found nothing and ground
his teeth till the chips flew.
A lesser man, tired and unfed, might
have become emotional, too; might, in-
deed, have curled up there on the 34th
floor and taken a nap. But Gruss was of
sterner stuff.
He took up his prawns, walked care-
fully back to the street and caught an-
other cab. His friend and chief sub-edi-
tor, a man named Kelly, lived a few
minutes away in Paddington. He would
give him a bed.
After five minutes it became clear
that Kelly was either dead or pretending
to be dead. Either way he paid not the
slightest attention to Gruss’s howls and
the blows that he rained on the door.
In such crises a man turns to his
mother and, in this crisis, Gruss was in
no way dismayed by the fact that his
mother lived at Palm Beach, some 50km
away. “Onward! To the north!” he told
the cabbie in the same ringing tones
with which the late Robert O’Hara
Burke must have stirred W. J. Wills, and
the driver stirred.
Neutral Bay, Cremorne, Mosman,
The Spit and not a wink of sleep. Manly
Vale, Brookvale, Dee Why, Collaroy,
Narrabeen, Warriewood and the meter
kept ticking. At Mona Vale, Gruss sat
bolt upright.
What, he asked his bag of prawns, if
Ma has taken out her hearing aid and
can’t hear me knocking?
At Newport, he stopped the cab and
called his mother’s number. Not unlike
Kelly she had either removed her hear-
ing aid or was pretending to have done
so.
It was then that Gruss played what
should have been his trump card: his
sister, Grizelda, the black sheep of the
family, had left the Grussery and gone
to ground with a musician in Avalon.
She would help. “ On!” cried Gruss.
Grizelda answered the door at once.
Most certainly he could use the spare
bed, she said, but she had no money for
the cab; and the musician was out of
work and, even now, was working for a
milkman, delivering bottles of the stuff
on the Pittwater side of the highway. A
temporary loan ...
“West!” cried Gruss.
Avalon, Clareville, Taylor’s Point,
Paradise Beach ... and at last, halfway
along Stokes Point, they found Henry
Jumper, the milko-musician driving his
little electric cart.
The trouble was that he didn’t know
Gruss from Adam. He was
ready to believe that Gruss
was the brother of his inamor-
ata but before he risked his
employer’s money the
meter was now nudging the
$45 mark he would need
proof.
“So call Grizzle,” said
Gruss. “She’ll identify my
voice.”
“I can’t call her,” said
Jumper. “The phone’s been
cut off.”
“God almighty. Well,
come on. Jump in. We’ll zoom
over to your place and she’ll
okay me.”
“I can’t go zooming all
over the Barrenjoey penin-
sula. I’ve got milk to deliver.”
“Ar, the hell with your
milk. Look, what if I identify
her! She’s got a birthmark
shaped like a teaspoon on
her right tit, right? And a
little brown mole thing about
two inches or so under her
belly button.”
“I don’t think we should be talking
about Those Parts,” Jumper said primly.
“Anyway, that doesn’t prove a thing.
For all I know half of Sydney has seen
the teaspoon on her tit.”
“That,” said the cabbie, “is a nice
way to be talking about a bloke’s sister.”
“I hear all this but I don’t believe it,”
said Gruss. “I go to the pub for The One
and wind up with a bag of prawns half-
way to Brisbane talking to a musical
milko about my sister’s tits. Look, her
second name’s May, she went to school
at Wenona, she dropped out of Sydney
Uni in Arts II ... right?”
And, grudgingly, Jumper unbelted a
$5O bill; Gruss paid the cabbie and
passed what remained of the night in his
sister’s spare bedroom and, in the un-
friendly right of day, his fingers nimble
again, he found, in his hip pocket, his
credit card, which would have been ac-
cepted by any cabbie.
Moodily, he took another cab to
town and, having called a locksmith,
watched his door opened. He carried in
his sack of prawns and, his belly rum-
bling began to prepare one of the break-
fasts that only crapulence permits.
He lifted the little plastic bucket of
prawns from the paper sack, lifted its lid
and saw everything go black as his
front-door key tinkled, triumphantly,
on the tiled kitchen floor. □

Mary Travers:
in an election
year
everything is
political
June Dally-
Watkins in the
beginning:
now for Hong
Kong
Edited by c ß(mSaw
At a Democratic Party fund-raiser on
Long Island, Mary Travers — the Mary
of Peter, Paul and — told the crowd of
an invitation she received to a White
House egg-rolling contest. They told her
it was non-political and she told them:
“In an election year everything is politi-
cal.” The White House rep kept trying
until Travers blew her top. “I don’t want
to roll an egg with Ronald Reagan,” she
shouted. “I want to throw one at him.”
Reagan rolled without her.
Prince Rainier
of Monaco:
golf helps
ease the pain
UPI
Inevitably there are rumors that Mon-
aco’s former Mr Grace Kelly Prince
Rainier is looking for a new wife. He
told the London Daily Mail: “Just the
idea that I could remarry is absurd. I’ve
grown used to being alone, and when
my loneliness is too much I forget by
playing golf.”
Nearly 40 years ago June Dally-Watkins
was one of the sights to carbonate the
blood. Then she made a not-so-small
fortune by running, in Sydney and Bris-
bane, modelling, charm and finishing
schools which taught a gel everything
from how to be sought by photogra-
phers such as Laurie LeGuay and David
Mist to how to eat artichokes with only
one shirt. On November 19 Dilly-Dally
takes her first step outside Australia: she
opens her school in Hong Kong, the
opening to be held at the Nautilus Club,
Repulse Bay, “the world’s most exclu-
sive and expensive private club.” We-e-
-e-el . . . The Millionaires’ Club in
Acapulco might be a bit more exclusive
and a bit more expensive, but hyper-
bole is part of the finish of a charming
model.
Five Sullivan brothers Jack, 26, Steve,
24, Eugene, 21, Frank, 20, and Vic, 18
joined the 2nd AIF, served in almost
every theatre of war and in a few prison
camps, and all lived to come home to
Toowoomba, Qld. Jack died in 1969,
but the other four allowed author
Patricia Shaw to drag their stories from
them, Frank Sullivan said that he and
his brothers hadn’t wanted to glorify
war. On the contrary: “We went in as
gung-ho youngsters and came back very
anti-war. We all did.” RSL executives
have called for calm in the clubs.
In the federal electorate of Wannon,
deep in the Nareen belt of western Vic-
toria, the sitting Liberal, David Hawker,
who got the seat when Malcolm Fraser
retired, is stiffening the sinews, so to
speak. In the by-election he was
opposed by the Nationals’ Roger
Hallam and Labor’s Nancy Genardini.
This time his opponents, from all three
parties, will be women. For some reason
hidden deep in bumf of bureaucracy, we
are not allowed to know who they are
“until nominations have closed,” and
they haven’t yet, but it’s a fair bet that
Genardini will be having another crack.
The overall redistribution of hormones,
with the added complication of men
jumping, as on springs, Out Of The
Closet, has made life tough for the
predatory, or even politely hopeful, fe-
male. There are, apparently, so few un-
attached heterosexual males around,
and so many women who don’t know
how to find them, that Sydney secretary
Julie Hunter has compiled a directory.
She nominates 200 available males and
conservatives will be relieved to know
that these are only the Top Aussies
the name of the $7.95 compilation.
There could be another 100 or so left
who are only so-so.
Queensland has a loathsome rash of
monstrous fibreglass bananas even
though it’s probable that more are
grown at Cofifs Harbor, NSW. Mel-
bourne has great big footballs, Perth
and Adelaide are thinking about swans
and piping shrikes and in Sydney there
are 4 million opinions on what, if any-
thing, should be put on the Sow ’n’ Pigs
reef for 1988. But in the little town of
Donnybrook, WA, Graham Preston,
who owns the Glen Karaleea Deer Park,
watches contractors who have nearly
finished the biggest apple of them all:
6.8 m in diameter, 7m high and red as
the Lady Williams that are Donny-
brook’s own fruit. The fibreglass apple
will sit atop a steel tower the whole


thing about 30m high. It can probably
be seen from the Sow ’n’ Pigs.
At the age of 74, and even though he
hasn’t put his lips to a clarinet since Sen.
Joe McCarthy’s Un-American Activities
Committee sniffed him in 1953, Artie
Shaw is still a distinguished musician.
And distinguished lover: he is not mar-
ried to his present girlfriend, flautist
Jennifer Carey, but his “eight stupid ad-
ventures, some of them called mar-
riages” have included unions with Lana
Turner, Ava Gardner, Kathleen (Forever
Amber) Winsor, Jerome Kern’s daughter
Elizabeth, and Evelyn Keyes. He is by no
means hungry: his royalties from re-
cordings of numbers such as Begin the
Beguine, Frenesi, Stardust and Lady Be
Good still roll in. But now he is again
leading, but not playing in, the 17-
strong Artie Shaw Orchestra at the high-
school auditorium at Brockton, Massa-
chusetts. Why? Part of the theory is that
Shaw is an illuminator, trying to shine
light in dark corners, a musician trying
to do the same with a clear, sweet note.
From London, in 1958, the Australian
actress Coral Browne went to Moscow
to play Hamlet. In Moscow she met Guy
Burgess of the Kim Philby-Guy Burgess-
Donald Maclean axis. He seemed to be a
rather lost, dreary fellow, and Browne
was sorry for him, not for his cause.
Somehow all this has been made into a
telemovie An Englishman Abroad
by the BBC. The reviews say that it’s de-
lightful; with Burgess played by Alan
Bates and Coral Browne by.. . Coral
Browne.
The awful case of Bill Dunlop is not be-
ing ignored by maritime authorities, but
it’s easy enough to understand the frus-
tration of his friends. Dunlop was sail-
ing his tiny (2.2 m) yacht from the Cook
Islands to Brisbane. He didn’t make it.
His wife came to look for him, gave up
and went back to the US after calls to all
shipping and all coast and island
stations had brought no result. Then a
note, in a margarine container, washed
up on a beach near Proserpine; and that
was enough to bring Jeff Weinstein, rep-
resenting Dunlop’s family and friends,
from Portland, Maine, where he said,
there was a feeling that the Australian
government didn’t care much about a
search. That was a bit tough. The Aus-
tralian Coastal Surveillance Centre,
which tracks all shipping, had contacted
every possible point. As for a “search”:
it had been estimated that to cover the
necessary area, searching for only eight
hours a day, would take 121 days.

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
The great leap forward into history
YOU MUST appreciate that,
with marvellous enthusiasm,
we are moving back into the
19th century. The ruthless
nostalgia battle is being
fought aspidistra for aspi-
distra, potted palm for potted
palm, brass bedstead for brass
bedstead.
Melbourne offers you a
remarkable choice of antique
accommodation. For a start,
there is the Old Melbourne
Hotel. It used to be Ma
Dailey’s junkyard. They got
their bluestone from a
demolished Methodist hotel
in Fitzroy. The building has
enough cast iron balconies to
fit out all New Orleans. It has
gas lamps and rooms are fitted
out with brass bedsteads
which have an authentic
Victorian squeak.
Gordon Place was named
in honor of General Gordon
of Khartoum. The grand palm
in the courtyard was planted
by actor George Coppin in
1883. Gordon Place became a
home for derelict and homeless men but
has become converted into apartments
for the rich homeless and over Coppin’s
palm is the biggest sliding roof in
Australia.
Or would you prefer the Hotel
Windsor, also 1883? The Oberoi chain
and the state government have spent
$ll million on its restoration.
You ought to see the main dining-
room, with its glass domes. They have
used so much gilt that it looks like the
throne room of the czars of all Russia.
Not a lion’s head, not an orb, not an
urn, not a frieze has not been restored;
not a Corinthian column has not been
re-Corinthed.
The first new domestic dwellings in
La Trobe Street in 100 years have just
opened. I think they are called mews.
Those responsible have superbly
ignored architectural advances these
past 300 years. These are town houses.
They would be suitable accommodation
for Samuel Johnson.
But, unquestionably, all these estab-
lishments have been out-nostalged by
Menzies at Rialto. At a cost of $5O
million, it is clearly the most expensive
piece of recycling we have seen in these
parts. The recycled are near-twin build-
ings, the Rialto (1890) and the Winfield
(1893). In Batmanic terms, they could
Menzies at Rialto: nostalgia with all mod cons
BRIAN FERGUSON
be described as neo-Victorian Gothic
gone berserk.
Ah, we remember the Rialto well.
Back in the old days, the department of
Shipping and Transport was there.
Legend had it that the young Nellie
Melba practised in one of its rooms.
In more recent years, it was Hector
Crawford’s headquarters nearly all of
television’s Homicide scripts were
hatched there. If you looked carefully, I
am sure that you would find sets of
handcuffs under the floorboards and
sometimes in the early hours you still
can hear the ghostly noises of Crawford
Productions’ FJ Holdens screeching
around corners on tortured tyres.
Federal Hotels, which operated the
old Menzies, took over the new pub and
craftily thought much nostalgia would
rub off if they called it Menzies at
Rialto.
The Rialto and the Winfield are side
by side with galleries going up nine
floors. So they put glass right over the
top and glassed in both ends. Lo, they
had an atrium! If you have done any
travelling lately, you know that on the
world hotel # scene it is practically com-
pulsory to have an atrium. Nostalgia in
an atrium is really something.
But the piece de resistance is the
Royal Suite. This comes at $6OO a day.
You get a four-poster bed
about the size of a squash
court, with canopy. The His
and Hers bathrooms have
gold taps. And there is a
jacuzzi bath. It is ex-
traordinary how clean they
expect their guests to be.
A stereo comes equipped
with a cassette library and, if
you cannot find what you
want there, the suite has a
$30,000 Steinway piano.
Room service will provide
you with someone to play it, if
necessary. The dining-room
has a table that seats 16
people with a dinner setting of
fine china, silver imported
from France and crystal from
Germany.
Service that comes with the
Royal Suite includes a
chauffeur and courtesy car, a
chef to cook in the suite’s own
kitchen, a barman for cocktail
parties, a personal room at-
tendant and a valet.
On the roof is a swimming-
pool. The lobby is surrounded
by floor-to-ceiling white marble.
Elevators tell the time and outdoor
temperature both in Celsius and
Fahrenheit, so you can decide whether
it is too horrid to venture abroad.
The lifts also are being programmed
so that a recorded voice will announce
each floor. Last heard, the management
was negotiating with Paul Hogan to be
that voice (a mistake, of course; they
should get someone nostalgic. A wispy,
badly-recorded Melba would be ideal).
One serious problem has not been
mentioned not a word in the publicity
notes. At the end of each of the galleries
are the historic dunnies which once
contained porcelain urinals which fed
straight to the street.
The Historic Buildings Council
fought to save the dunnies, as superb
examples of primitive Melburnian
sanitation. The council argued that
tourists would be fascinated by this
piece of history.
Well, I looked to be fascinated. The
dunnies are there but only the
corrugated iron shell. Suspicion is grow-
ing that Menzies at Rialto will just
quietly forget the most intriguing piece
of nostalgia of all. But I, for one, want
to see them restored to 1890 mint
condition in the finest fin de siecle urinal
porcelain. □


Time to honor a brave man
DAVID M c NICOLL
WHY NOT a posthumous Order of
Australia for Donald Mac Kay?
In Sydney, there is strong support for
the idea. It would be a fitting tribute to a
man who literally gave his life in the
battle against drugs. I am sure such an
award would be received with acclaim
throughout Australia.
THIS IS the horsey season in Australia.
But don’t think that everyone’s interest
is going to be in race horses.
Next week, Sydney will host the
World Arabian Horse Conference.
Arab horse lovers and breeders will de-
scend on Sydney from all over the
world America, Canada, England,
Egypt, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Uru-
guay, among others.
One of the most interesting people
attending: Princess Alia, of Jordan, a
world expert on Arab horses. The prin-
cess will have quite a big entourage, in-
cluding stud chief Ursula Lopez who
manages 200 horses.
Arab horses are quite magnificent
(race horses are merely an offshoot of
Arabs). They are not used for racing but
for riding and showing. In fact, there is
quite a bit of criticism about rich people
who see ownership of Arabs as a “living
art form.”
In America, an Arab horse has sold
for $300,000 and sales up to $50,000 are
not uncommon in Australia.
How does the Arab rate against a
racehorse? Well, a racehorse would beat
an Arab up to Melbourne Cup distance.
But, just as the thoroughbred race-
horses started to falter, the Arab would
be coming into his own. Their en-
durance is remarkable.
They are beautiful and quite distinc-
tive animals bright of eye, very for-
ward ears, distended nostrils. The one
illustrated is Ambition, pride of
Mulawa stud.
THAT remarkable man of finance, Sir
lan Potter (who claims to be more than
80 but obviously is in his early 60s) has,
among his multifarious interests strong
financial links with Sweden.
Last year, in recognition of his
efforts, the Swedish government made
Sir lan a Knight of the Northern Star.
As a knight he will be invited to Nobel
Prize presentations he leaves for
Ambition, a prized Arabian stallion which stands at Mulawa stud
Stockholm in a week or so to join the il-
lustrious heavies who will see Bishop
Tutu, among others, get his Nobel.
SUPPORTERS of Clunies Ross (among
whom I am numbered) were delighted
at the High Court decision to permit the
family to continue residing on part of
the island they pioneered and devel-
oped before the Malays had even heard
of the place.
I have a feeling that quite a few
members of federal cabinet (including
Tom Uren who had to lead the moves to
expel Clunies Ross) will be secretly
pleased at the High Court decision.
Australians, whatever their political
color, like to see people getting a “fair
go” and John Clunies Ross was not
getting one.
I HAVE the greatest admiration for Sir
William McKell and am proud to have
him as a friend. But I feel that the New
South Wales government decision to re-
name the old Canonbury estate on Dar-
ling Point the McKell Harborside Park
is a great mistake. I would not be sur-
prised if Sir William agreed.
There are many monuments to Sir
William’s life and services buildings,
streets, horse races, etc. The government
view is that Sir William’s services to
conservation merit giving his name to
the park. Surely it is better to preserve
history the original Canonbury.
THE Sydney Morning Herald (and the
public) suffered when cartoonist George
Molnar retired.
But Molnar has turned, in his retire-
ment, to whimsical, slightly barbed
sketches and paintings depicting pos-
sible incidents in Australian history. His
exhibition will open at Sydney’s
Holdsworth Galleries on November 24.
Among the offerings: “Mrs Burley
Griffin helping her husband design
Canberra”; “The stalking of William
Dobell by Joshua Smith, intent on re-
venge”; “Industrial Action at The Syd-
ney Morning Herald on the introduction
of typewriters”; “The Very Rev Dick
Hughes CBE, DD is interrogated by
Agent MIS about the assault and rob-
bery allegedly suffered by His Grace”;
“Secret meeting between Patrick White,
Gough Whitlam, Manning Clark and
Donald Horne to find out which of
them has been infiltrated by the CIA”;
“Dirk Hartog decides on aesthetic
grounds not to discover Australia.” It
all sounds like something not to be
missed. □

THE ARTS
The topsy-turvy world where
the wild things are written
Once censored, the disturbing books written and drawn by Maurice Sendak have
been sanctified as children's classics. Meanwhile, he has turned his attention to
creating opera. TREVOR GROVE visited the artist for an interview.
VISITORS to Maurice Sendak’s home
in Connecticut must follow a compli-
cated set of instructions, culminating in
a mailbox marked Evans. He had failed
to mention that along the route we
would pass 10 elephants browsing in a
buttercup meadow. But this was where
the wild things were, so it was no sur-
prise that Clyde Beatty Close Bros’ cir-
cus was in the neighborhood.
Just beyond Evans’ mailbox is
Sendak’s secluded homestead, a pretty
putty-colored stone-and-clapboard
house circa 1790, surrounded by
hillocky lawns and dense woodland.
Alerted by the elephants,
we were on the look-out for
creatures lurking in the
laurels. But only the bees, the
crickets and a pair of finches
attacking a feeding table were
there.
Sendak was inside watch-
ing an early-afternoon tele-
vision program called All My
Children. He answered the
door wearing jeans and a
green shirt, then padded
straight back to the TV, asking
to be excused if he continued
with his daily soap opera
“fix.”
The series had reached a
gripping moment. The her-
oine unwittingly had just mar-
ried a psychopath,
Sendak would not miss his
soap opera any more than he
would neglect his dogs or fail
to put in seven days a week in
his studio. His most famous
children’s books Where the
Wild Things Are, In the Night
Kitchen and Outside Over
There lure readers into
topsy-turvy worlds but their
creator leads a life of exemp-
lary orderliness. His studio is
as neat as an operating
theatre. Pens, brushes, inks
and little pots of watercolor
are laid out like surgical in-
struments.
Those who imagine that being an il-
lustrator and author of children’s books
involves no more than musing and
doodling are dealt with firmly. “People
say, ‘Oh, Maurice, you have such a nice
life staying in the country and painting
those cute little pictures ... ’ Lirst, I
want to break their jaws for saying ‘cute
little pictures.’ Then I say, actually it’s
like living in an army camp. Every day
is the same. It’s a ritualised, hard busi-
ness. Even the dogs are ritualised. They
have their snack times, their dinner
hour, their walk.
“I think artists are the most practical
Maurice Sendak: Short, Jewish, Marlboro country
people on Earth. Probably Jackson
Pollock used to wash up after he’d
splashed all that paint around. If I were
impractical and silly, how could I have
accomplished all this?”
By “all this” Sendak could be taken
to mean more than our immediate sur-
roundings, visible rewards of success.
“All this” must include the glittering
prizes of his profession the Caldecott
Medal and the Hans Christian
Andersen award. It embraces millions
of readers all over the world, parents as
well as children. There can scarcely be a
household that does not contain at least
one book illustrated by
Sendak. He has done more
than 80 mostly in partner-
ship with other authors such
as Else Holmelund Minarik,
creator of the amiable Little
Bear stories, and Charlotte
Zolotow who wrote Mr Rabbit
and the Lovely Present. But the
best-known are those which
Sendak has written himself.
His earliest big success as an
author was The Sign on
Rosie’s Door.
Lately, he has launched
himself on a new career as an
opera designer and librettist.
Glyndebourne, in Britain,
last month staged the world
premiere of his opera based
on Higglety Pigglety Pop\ This
is the story of a discontented
sealyham called Jennie who
runs away from home to be-
come an actress.
The score for Higglety is by
Sendak’s British composer
friend Oliver Knussen, to
whom Sendak took at once
because Knussen is very tall
(Sendak is aware of being not
very tall). “It was love at first
sight and ear.”
Knussen also composed
Where the Wild Things Are
which children and critics
liked when it was shown in
Britain this year at the Na-


The style of Maurice Sendak’s drawing in Where the Wild Things Are
tional Theatre and on TV.
Glyndebourne is taking the operas on
tour as a double bill.
The Bodley Head has just published
Sendak’s latest book, a Grand Guignol
version of Nutcracker.
Sendak has painted graceful court
scenes but also rascally rats in Turkish
pantaloons, storms at sea and a yellow-
eyed monster. “I made the story as grue-
some and sexual as I could,” he says
coolly. “First, we dumped the Sugar
Plum Fairy. Then we turned the ending
into an orgy though quite a nice sort
of orgy. Mozart is depicted as a candy-
eating giant.”
The artist himself is best described as
stocky. He has a beard, heavy glasses
and prominent cheekbones. Posing be-
side a rustic gate for a photograph, he
offered the caption: “Short, Jewish,
Marlboro country ...” He is 56. When
he was in England to launch the United
Kingdom edition of Where the Wild
Things Are, he had a heart attack right
in the middle of a chat show in full
view of the cameras.
“It was a terrific coronary,” he re-
calls back at home in America. When he
recovered consciousness in the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, a
smiling Geordie nurse was bending over
him saying “Champion! Champion!” in
an encouraging but mystifying way.
That was in 1967. Recovered, he
produced In the Night Kitchen which is
the story of a small boy called Mickey
who falls out of bed and drops naked
into a gigantic bowl of cake batter in an
outlandish bakery presided over by a
trio of bakers who all look like movie
comedian Oliver Hardy. There is a
Manhattan skyline composed of
grocery cartons, pepper pots, jam jars
and pop bottles. Looking very carefully,
you can see that one carton has “Q.E.
Gateshead” written on it in small letters
and that one of the bottles has flying
from its cork a flag which reads
“CHAMPION.” This was Sendak’s
thank-you to the hospital staff who
saved his life. He sent them each a copy.
Sendak’s work is full of thank-yous.
Students are prone to search his fantasy
worlds for hidden psychological mean-
ings. “Heavy, heavy!” they exclaim
when they notice that Ida, the name of
the heroine in Outside Over There, con-
tains the Freudian “id.” They would do
better to go to the movies.
As a small boy in New York’s Brook-
lyn in the 30s, Sendak says, the cinema
saved his life. “Movies dyed my im-
agination a silvery Hollywood color.”
As well as the three Oliver Hardys in
In the Night Kitchen, there are allusions
to King Kong and the hero is named
after Mickey Mouse.
Mickey Mouse was born just six
months after Sendak was, in 1928. Al-
though the Disney brand of sentimen-
tality has lost its charm for him, Mickey
remains a talisman and an obsession.
The house is mouse-infested. It has
wooden, tin, plaster and plastic
Mickeys; Mickey clocks, trains and
dolls. A 1.3-metre-high storefront
Mickey waves when you plug it in.
Sendak is rather critical of this one, vin-
tage 1932. He draws attention to the
waistline. “You see here,” he points out,
“Mickey is already getting that rounded
look. As soon as he married Minnie, he
started going downhill. In the early
days, he was as thin as a rat.”
In his own early days, Sendak was a
rather sickly infant. He was the third
child of a Polish couple who had
emigrated separately to the United
States before World War I. When they
married, they settled in Brooklyn where
pigs still roamed the streets.
Maurice (pronounced in the French
manner) spent much of his childhood
indoors. His father wanted him to be a
doctor.
“My favorite memory is of sitting on
my grandmother’s lap by the window,”
Sendak says. “She’d pull the shade
down, then snap it up again; pull it
down, snap it up. It was like a change of
scene. One minute my brother and sister
would be outside building a snowman;
the shade would go down, then up, and
they’d be gone!” Windows are magical
casements in Sendak’s books opening
on to perilous adventures outside, over
there.
As a bachelor, Sendak is asked regu-
larly how a childless man can be so
attuned to the imagination of a child.
His answer is that he has been one.
His childhood memories with their
cargo of remembered fears and
pleasures, tantrums and reconciliations
are still his richest source material.
The growling, prancing monsters in
Where the Wild Things Are look as they
do because Sendak remembers friends
of his parents bending over him as a
child and saying: “Oh, I could eat you
up ...” “They had great big teeth, im-
mense nostrils and sweaty foreheads.”
If the children whom Sendak draws
sometimes look oddly like stunted
adults, as though (in his own words)
they had been hit on the head, it is be-
cause that is what the immigrant chil-
dren of his childhood looked like. That
is what he looked like, as an early snap-
shot of a bulgy-headed baby shows ...
Such straightforward explanations
were lost on a large swathe of the adult
American public. A fearful to-do
ensu'ed when Wild Things was first pub-
lished, in 1963. The Journal Of Nursery
Education wrote: “We should not like to
have it left about where a sensitive child
might find it to pore over in the twi-
light.” And that was one of the milder
criticisms Sendak has had to endure
which is why he now prefers writing op-
eras to writing books.
“There have been years of hullabal-
oo,” he says.
“When The Wild Things caused such
a furore, I was only in my 30s; I could
afford to sit through it. It was saved by a
children’s crusade: the kids wanted it.
And now it is a sanctified classic.
“But then The Night Kitchen was
banned from certain libraries because
Mickey, the little boy, has a penis. I
have school copies where diapers have
been drawn in. And, with Outside Over
There, there has been another outburst
of Sturm und Drang. These people
parents, Moral Majority types find
something troubling and uncertain


about my books. They are saying that
the disturbing element in them is bad.
They say that I’m writing for small chil-
dren and frightening the bananas out of
them. I say that, if these kids haven’t
thought or experienced such things,
then there’s something wrong with
them.” Sendak seized a pair of secateurs
and attacked a lilac tree.
“I write for adults. I don’t know how
to write for children. But my subjects
have been doomed to be treated as chil-
dren’s subjects. To have a book dis-
counted because of what people think is
proper for children is depressing.
“The other day, a professor wrote to
me about Outside Over There to say I
was a pederast: ‘Babies marrying gob-
lins who are really other babies you
don’t fool me. r I’m bored with it all. It
doesn’t happen with opera.”
To be an artist, says Sendak, you
must be selfish. “I would have been a
bad parent, because I’ve always been a
worker. And I would be riddled with
guilt. I would hate to fail; I’d be too
vain to get it wrong. I would go into my
study and write a book about how much
I loved my children.”
Surprisingly, Sendak has never been
asked to be a godfather. “But I have in
absentia. Because of Wild Things, there
are thousands of little Maxes all over
the country with starey eyes ... I was
given an honorary degree at Princeton
recently (if my father could have lived!
He’d have loved to see me do the whole
thing in 24 hours and so cheap!) and
when I was called up to get my doctor-
ate there was a great shout from the stu-
dents. There were all these kids who had
been brought up on Max.”
Another generation is being brought
up on Outside Over There, the story of
how distracted, dauntless Ida recovers
her baby sister from the goblins after
they have stolen her away and left an ice
changeling in her place. Sendak took
five years to write and illustrate it. “I
can say Ida is my favorite child. No real
parent can say that. You can’t say that.
She’s the kind of daughter I’d like to
have had. She’s so beautiful and so
brave!”
He also says: “I love Ida the same
way I love Pamina.” Coming from
Sendak, a passionate Mozartian, this is
to put Ida among the angels. He does
not believe in God: “If you have to live
with Jehovah for a God, then you’ve got
a problem Jehovah’s got a problem. If
you have to have a god, let him be
Mozart.”
Sendak lives with Ida and his dogs
and his pantheon of household gods:
Mozart and Goethe, Beatrix Potter and
Edward Ardizzone, Blake and Henry
James. That is not to forget his contem-
porary, Mickey Mouse, who is now well
fed and famous but once was as thin as
a rat. □
THEATRE
Arthur gives
his queen the
tutorial rounds
Marina Pryor: “Guenevere is growing each time I play her”
By SHELLEY NELLER
THE regal performance that Marina
Pryor has been giving in the stage revi-
val of Camelot is, she says, largely at-
tributable to her “king” Richard Har-
ris, who plays Arthur.
“He is an absolute perfectionist,”
Pryor says of the 50-year-old theatrical
trouper who has played the off-stage
role of teacher, director, mentor and
father-figure, supervising every aspect
of Pryor’s presentation.
“We all look to him for approval
to check wigs, make-up, the publicity we
should do and so on. All of which says
how much he cares about the show,” the
20-year-old actress/singer says.
“I think the world of him. He’s an
actor’s director fabulous. He’s
brought out abilities that I didn’t even
know were there. And he’s done it
steadily; he’s never pushed me.”
Harris also has been setting an ad-
mirable example in the way in which he
has continued to hone to perfection his
role as Arthur an even greater height
he has sought to attain after giving hun-
dreds of performances throughout the
United States and England.
Watching him, following his
example, I find that Guenevere is grow-
ing each time I play her,” Pryor says.
“But I have to be careful not to in-
dulge myself, playing around with the
role to stave off boredom.”
Boredom is likely to be the least of
Pryor’s problems in the near futue.
She has her eye on a recording con-
tract and is keen to try her hand at film
and television acting.
“There are so many mediums I want
to explore.
“But, first, I want to do more stage
acting.”
And ... viola! She will resume the
role of Mabel when the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust’s The Pirates of Penzance
has a return season in January.


Richard Harris in Camelot: “He is an absolute perfectionist,” says Marina Pryor
Pryor burst on to the Australian pro-
fessional theatre scene as Mabel in Pi-
rates this year.
Landing the Mabel role dramatically
affected her life. She had enjoyed a quiet
existence as a student of music and
drama at the Melbourne College of Ad-
vanced Education.
“After the success of Pirates, I’d
wondered what to do next,” Pryor says.
“I didn’t want to retreat to the chorus
line. So when I landed Guenevere, I
thought, ‘Thank God I’m still employ-
able’.”
Pryor is, as the critics appear to
agree, “a pretty girl” who sings “sweet-
ly.” But she is no puffball. Astutely
aware of her attributes and her limita-
tions (her youth, minimal acting experi-
ence and soft-timbered but resonant
voice), she is determined to accelerate
her career at an appropriate pace.
“A lot of people have told me my
talent is difficult to fit into roles,” she
admits. “There are not too many in-
genue roles available these days. The
fashion now in Australian film and
theatre is for the quiet, tough Australian
woman. I’ve played very young girls on
stage. Mabel was a light, naive character
which suited me perfectly.
“I related to her youthfulness.
Guenevere is a step up from that. She
matures and grows during the show and
I feel a parallel with her in my own per-
sonal growth.”
Pryor has come a long way from the
days (not so long ago) when she used to
sneak through the stage door because
she could not afford to buy tickets to
watch opera or drama at Melbourne’s
Concert Hall.
Half wistfully, she says it would have
been nice to have completed her degree
but working with “seasoned profession-
als” she has learned “10 times more”
than she could have in college.
On another level, however, she
misses her student days.
“One of the most frustrating things
about being out in the real world is the
lack of in-put of stimulating infor-
mation. I find that, now that I don’t
have to study, I have to make a con-
scious effort to read. I never thought I’d
miss sitting in lectures having ideas and
philosophies thrown at me. But now I
can see it’s a luxury to have a learned
person spouting at you five days a
week.”
Pryor seemed destined from a young
age for a career in showbusiness. She
has sung and played guitar since she
was five. Both her parents have beauti-
ful singing voices (although her brother
is tone deaf) and they encouraged
“but never forced” her in all her musi-
cal endeavors.
Until Pirates, her theatrical experi-
ence was confined to singing in cafes
and small restaurants and busking in
Melbourne’s Bourke Street Mall.
She took a calculated gamble in per-
sisting with the long series of auditions
for Camelot. She had been offered a
cabaret job. Material was being written
for her; the show was set to tour Austra-
lia; the money was good.
“It meant solid work and I was in
agony. I had to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to it. I
didn’t know if I’d get the Guenevere
part. I was terrified I’d end up with
neither job and be unemployed for God
knows how long.
“But I thought that one of the things
about showbusiness is that you’ve got to
have guts and you’ve got to take risks. If
there’s something I want badly enough,
I go after it.
“Now I realise there is nothing to
stop you except yourself and your
own fear of failure. Once you start in
this business, the sky’s the limit.” □


TELEVISION
It’s time for
the birth
of the blues
By RON SAW
SO HERE we have another Non-Rating
Period another of those seasons of
misery which are explained glibly by the
ratings people and in confusion and
embarrassment by the networks and
which we, the viewers, man-
age, incredibly, to suffer
without actually running
amok in the streets.
Nothing really matters at
these times and so the
networks could run, say,
public readings of the charter
of the Women’s Christian
Temperance Union and get
away with it. Naturally, they
pick stuff which they think
would not rate a damn. This
wilderness hosts some hor-
rible beasts but others can
become loved pets. Take the
case of Hill Street Blues.
What came out of the off
season was not just another
cop show. It turned out to
have everything: intelligence,
wit, entertainment, sex and
good looks. It took time to
rate well but it rated.
Now we are to have a
further cop show: from
November 17, the Seven
Network will run Cagney and
Lacey. Same old stuff: comic
cops, dumb cops, cops who
sound like PhDs, cops who sound like
cops never do, trite situations ... yawn.
The difference is that Cagney and
Lacey are lady cops (I beg your pardon:
patrolpersons) and Cagney is played
in the pilot, anyway by Loretta Swit,
a/k/a Major “Hotlips” Houlihan, the
hospital scold of M*A*S*H.
That should not be right and it isn’t.
We see Patrolperson Hotlips in the sack
with her boyfriend and, instead of
getting a bit of a buzz, we tend to
wonder what Major Frank Burns and
Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Penobscot
would say.
Wc have Hotlips, the cop with (of
course) the heart of gold, sympathetic
with a clutch of hookers. Major Hotlips
would have had them shot.
The Hotlips who snaps like a man-
drill and makes you laugh becomes a
character who plays it straight and
makes you wonder what is hot on the
ABC.
Also in the pilot is a character who,
when she looks down, is the thpit and
image of Ita Buttrose. She acts better
than Ita does, too, and that alone should
make the show rate. But, if it does, it
will be a miracle.
FIFTEEN million years ago, give or
take an aeon, the cave, castle, Emoh
Ruo of the average Briton was alive
with hedgehogs.
They bayed, barked, jumped through
hoops or whatever it was that so endears
them to the Brits. Nobody wanted to get
rid of them, which was just as well
because nobody could have done.
The sabretoothed tiger came and
Loretta Swit: Hotlips becomes a patrolperson
went, as did the dinosaurs and the
woolly mammoths, but the good old
hedgehogs stayed on.
Their habits and their history were
examined in dismaying detail on ABC-
TV by the übiquitous Mr David Atten-
borough on an otherwise restful
Sunday; their habits and history and the
history of their habits: 16th century
naturalists decided, apparently, that
hedgehogs mated belly to belly and
standing up. Wrong, said Atten-
borough, who, with his rubbernecking
little camera, showed that the beasts do
it lying down. And, heh-heh, with ex-
treme care.
Oh, I say, look here! Is nothing
sacred?
But worse was to come.
At the very same time as the sensitive
soul was a-writhe with the picture of
hedgehogs locked in love on their hind
legs, the Leyland Brothers were Great
Outdoorsing on ATN7 and telling the
fascinated population of NSW all about
life on the Galapagos Islands. Life there
apparently was mostly to do with the
mating game because the Leyland boys
ogled as the frigate birds got at it; and
flamingoes, lava lizards, Sally Lightfoot
crabs, penguins and ... marine iguanas!
An iguana seemed to be about to
mount a crab! Had I seen it, I would
have pulled my weskit over my head
and screamed but mercifully I was able
to look back to my prayerbook.
What on earth is going on? Is the
Reverend Fred Nile able to do nothing
about this appalling prurience?
MEMO Rex Mossop (ATN7, Sydney):
Manuka, Australian Capital
Territory, where Western
Australia and NSW were
playing cricket, is pronounced
Marna-ka, not Manooka.
THE ABC covered world
championship tenpin bowling
at the Rushcutter Bowl in
Sydney and, like pretty well
all sports, it made good TV.
And the commentators
were good, if the merest
thought florid at times: Teruo
Kawabata, from Japan, one of
the finalists, was having bad
luck and was reacting as a
gentleman from Japan trad-
itionally reacts. But. . .
“That unnerved him . .
we were told. And “He didn’t
like that . . etc. How could
they tell? On radio, they could
have gotten away with it. But
on TV it was different.
Kawabata could have been
told that his house was on fire
and his children were gone,
that he’d just won the world
championship by default
because all his competitors had been
attacked by squadrons of kamikaze pigs
and owls and his expression would not
have changed by a twitch.
SOMETHING will have to be done
about television terminology.
ATN7 was plugging the airing of The
Scarlet and the Black with Gregory Peck
playing the part of an Irish priest in the
Vatican in World War 11.
TV premiere, they said, and to
make that clear “first time on TV.”
Oh, come on! That show had been
available on videotape for months and
probably had been discussed every-
where from Gulargambone, NSW, to
Widgiemooltha, WA.
What ATN7 meant was that it was to
be screened for the first of 30 or 40 times
by ATN7. □

Justice at
last for
two classics
By SANDRA HALL
CLASSIC works of art and literature
have to be tough. Not only must they
contend with the tests of time; they have
to bounce back unbruised from the “im-
provements” imposed by interpreters.
Shakespeare gone punk, Brecht in
drag the permutations are endless as
adaptors and producers pick over the
classics scrabbling for what F. R. Leavis
called, with a high-minded quiver of
distaste, “social values.” Then, once in a
while, things come full circle and some-
body announces that he or she is return-
ing to basics with a production devoted
to the author’s “original conception.”
So it is with two new films, Francesco
Rosi’s adaptation of the opera Carmen
and Michael Radford’s chillingly faith-
ful version of 1984 last seen on the big
screen in a thoroughly Hollywoodised
incarnation of 1955.
Rosi’s faithfulness to Bizet is tem-
pered slightly by first loyalty to film
rather than to opera. Even so, Rosi’s
version handles Bizet and Prosper Mer-
imee rather more delicately than has
been usual lately. For it seems to be the
season of Carmen. We read late last year
of Peter Brook’s 82-minute production
staged in a gasworks in Copenhagen
with only four singers and one set, a
sandpit. And last Christmas brought
Carlos Saura’s flamenco Carmen
done, with Antonio Gades’ Spanish
dance troupe, as a contemporary
tragedy about a serious man’s love for a
trivial woman.
Happily, there is nothing trivial
about Rosi’s Carmen. Played by the
American soprano Julia Migenes
Johnson, she has freckles, a streetwise
look and a profile as strong as
Streisand’s. Rosi does not have to go far
for his “social values” they are all
there on her face.
In Migenes Johnson’s hands, Car-
men becomes a thoroughly modern
woman with a dangerous sense of
humor and a robust contempt for all re-
straining influences.
Nor is there anything serious about
Placido Domingo’s Don Jose. Rosi de-
fines his character during the opening
credits, superimposed on a sequence
showing Don Escamillo (an elegantly
sanguine Ruggero Raimondi) at work in
the ring, easily dispatching a bull. The
associations are obvious. Dogged and
unthinking, Don Jose allows himself to
be tormented by Carmen until just as
unthinkingly he brings about their
mutual destruction.
Rosi is frequently sardonic about
Don Jose, most successfully in the scene
which has him interrupting his night of
love with Carmen to tell her that he
must get back to the barracks in time for
roll call. She is vamping him with a
smouldering flamenco display and so
pleased with the performance that at
first she takes no notice of him. Then his
words sink in, the seductive pose is
abandoned and she flies into a rage
telling him in effect that here she is, go-
ing to all this trouble, and he has to go
off and answer a blasted bugle call.
Rosi filmed mostly in Seville and the
hot, bright colors of dust and sunlight
prevail. Enrico Job’s costumes stress vi-
tality, rather than lushness, so that the
only theatricality of design is in
Antonio Gades’ choreography which
sets a rhythm for the film and helps
make music and action flow together by
striking a fine balance between drama
and naturalism.

men and Don Jose take to the
mountains with the smugglers
do things begin to go awry,
partly because the direction
has to accommodate the
libretto’s weakest develop-
ment. Both Don Escamillo
and Don Jose’s pining lover
Micaela (played with approxi-
mate wimpishness by Faith
Esham) come seemingly out
of nowhere and, with the ac-
curacy of homing pigeons,
happen on exactly the right
jagged outcrop.
But that’s opera and Rosi
has chosen to go with it, rather
than against it. He has
produced in the process a
Carmen of verve, character
and sensuality.
There is nothing sensual
about 1984. Radford has managed to
create an environment full of surfaces
which one would not want to touch.
They all look grimy, bleak and ill-used
the products of years of hostility or, at
best, indifference to the concept of
beauty or of pleasure.
It seems that 1984, written in 1948,
should still pack a punch especially in
a year when audiences have been
encouraged to become connoisseurs of
depictions of the apocalyptic. Yet it is
A scene from the latest Carmen: back to basics
so much more horrific than any of the
recent nuclear holocaust pictures and
that is precisely because of its faithful-
ness to George Orwell’s vision.
Deliberately, Radford has not even
moved it forward to the present. He has
said that he did not want to do the story
as futurology but as the cold war satire
which Orwell originally devised. And
that is the way it looks.
London, capital of Airstrip One, “the
third most populous of the provinces of
Oceania,” has the decayed ap-
pearance of the archetypal
20th century war time city. Its
inhabitants badly dressed,
badly fed and utterly
brainwashed are eerily
commonplace. Despite their
interest in Newspeak and joy-
ful participation in Big
Brother’s Hate Sessions, there
is nothing exotic about them.
They are, as Orwell meant
them to be, Londoners sent
mad en masse.
The aptly-named John
Hurt surely the most elo-
quently suffering actor in films
is wretchedly affecting as
Winston. Richard Burton, all
the fire gone out of him, is ter-
rifyingly bloodless as the
gruesome torturer O’Brien.
This is not a film to be recommended
to anybody but a masochist. None-
theless, it is already doing very good
business. Such is the power of a classic
when treated with an understanding of
what it stood for in the first place. □

BOOKS
The political
life of
Daniel Mannix
By EDMUND CAMPION
Daniel Mannix: A Biography, by
B. A. Santamaria. Melbourne
University Press, $27.50
THERE ARE more lives of Daniel
Mannix than of any comparable figure
in Australian history, apart from Ned
Kelly.
None is quite satisfactory. Most of
them are fan mag stuff, uncritical and
adulatory. Some try to answer the ques-
tion of why Mannix was so important
not only to Catholics but to Australians
generally. But no one, it seems, can
pierce the enigma wrapped in mystery
which Mannix has presented for most
of this century.
The man who knew him best was
B. A. Santamaria. They met when the
prelate was 72 and his admirer 20. Ac-
quaintance ripened into friendship.
Soon they were meeting three times a
week. Such intimacy led historians to
urge Santamaria to attempt a full-scale
biography of the archbishop. At last, he
has obliged.
The book is a signal achievement.
What he has done, he has done su-
premely well. Santamaria traverses the
public — or political — life of the arch-
bishop and presents his side of attend-
ant controversies. With forensic skill,
Santamaria moves great blocks of evi-
dence about in a series of arguments
that both absorb and compel a reader.
The intellectual rigor is sustained to the
end.
Conscription, Ireland, state aid, the
Movement — the old controversies are
given new life by Santamaria’s mental
energy and by the use of new material.
He gets into the archives to reveal how
the British government felt it was threat-
ened by Mannix — they arrested him —
and how Australian prime minister
Billy Hughes wanted to be rid of him.
Against those who crossed Mannix
Santamaria argues forcefully. The
churchmen Kelly, Gilroy, Carroll and
Panico all get their comeuppance.
Panico was the Vatican diplomat who
broke Mannix’s Irish hold on the ap-
pointment of bishops in Australia. With
something almost like anger,
Santamaria punishes Panico for dis-
courtesy to Manpix. The new evidence
he prints will fascinate historians. They
played an extremely rough game in
those days.
The instrument of the Vatican’s de-
Irishing was the Australian Justin
Simonds who was foisted on Mannix as
his successor. Mannix, however, lived to
99 and the new man grew old waiting to
take over. Santamaria is suprisingly
gentle with this wasted figure, under-
standing the frustration that cursed the
life of Melbourne’s first Australian
archbishop.
Something of the same quality of
gentle sympathy pervades the final
chapter, set round Mannix’s deathbed.
As nowhere else in the book,
Santamaria allows his imagination to
flow in these pages. The result is a mem-
orable piece of writing.
Some will wish that he had allowed
himself more of the same freedom in
writing of Mannix as a man. Despite
those three meetings each week, we
learn very little about the archbishop’s
person. Told, for example, that he was a
ceaseless reader, we are nevertheless not
given the name of one book that he
liked. Apart from politics, what interest-
ed him? Did he follow the footy?
There are just enough anecdotes to
capture the larrikin quality which
enraged Mannix’s opponents among
the apostles of respectability. Santa-
maria must be a walking archive of such
Mannix stories, but for the most part he
keeps them to himself.
The reader interested in the Church
may be disappointed, too, by the slight
space given to religious matters. But the
political historian will find an elegant
and measured study of the days when
Australia was two nations and Mannix
was a leader of one of them. □
Archbishop Mannix: intrigued historians
Cricket as
the game
is written
By BATMAN
Bat and Pad, by Pat Mullins and
Philip Derriman. Oxford University
Press, $25.
I HAVE happy memories of a nice
piece that Henry Blofeld wrote about a
fifth test between England and the West
Indies. Henry devoted almost half a col-
umn to Mozart’s Concerto for the Horn
which he heard on the car radio while
driving to The Oval. It suited perfectly
the melancholy mood of England’s pos-
ition.
I have just received a delightful little
book, Bat and Pad, compiled by Pat
Mullins and Philip Derriman. In his in-
troduction, Derriman says that Austra-
lian newspapers have been prepared to
settle for sports reporting while English
newspapers have aspired to sports
“writing.”
I suppose this is true. English sports
writers such as Blofeld have always
been best when they have not been
writing about the game at all. Neville
Cardus wrote a famous piece during the
third test at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground in 1936. There was no play that
day but Cardus was brilliant. He wrote
of the various excursions to the wicket;
of how captains and umpires walked
around it warily, “half expecting it to
get up and shake itself and wet every-
body.”
What a man was Cardus! In 1930, he
described the dazzling Bradman reeling
off runs at one end and stolid Woodfull
plugging the other. “Woodfull ...,”
said Cardus, “was as much forgotten by
us, as much taken for granted, as
Kreisler’s accompanist.”
This book is a collection of writings
on Australian cricket from 1804 to 1984
with a foreword by Prime Minister Bob
Hawke. Clearly, Hawke is becoming
more Menzian than ever. Back in the
50s and 60s, nine out of 10 of all cricket
books had forewords by Bob Menzies.
Hawke was fascinated to learn that
violence in cricket had been around for
a long time. He picked out with his good
eye these lines from an “Anon” poem
written in 1898:
Hit him - body, head or wicket
’Tis the soul of modern cricket.
Hawke was delighted to see that
sledging had been going on for a long
time. Two elite Sydney clubs - the Aus-
tralian and the Union had a match on
February 7, 1838. The Commercial Jour-


rial reported: “We have no objection to
a little humorous chaff but we certainly
condemn that low slang and insulting
remarks so often resorted to by the Aus-
tralians.”
There’s some very readable stuff, par-
ticularly about the old times. It was fas-
cinating to discover that Banjo Paterson
was a devoted cricket enthusiast. He
wrote of the mighty men of old, how in
the last century we would send an XI to
England. By heavens that would be it
just 11. They would go through a gruel-
ling tour, managing to turn out every
day. Now we have to send at least 16, to
say nothing of replacements when a fast
bowler gets a sore finger or sore knee.
There is quite a bit from cricket
writer R. G. Menzies. Menzies told how
important it was to know your judge.
On this day, he had in court a dull and
almost incoherent client and an elderly
judge who was not a great lawyer but
had been a better-than-average crick-
eter.
Menzies’ client fortunately once
played for Ballarat against Ivo Bligh’s
XI.
After a poor start from his man,
Menzies said: “Take your time, witness.
I know that dates are not always easy to
remember. Now, if I were to ask you
about the date you played cricket for
Ballarat & District against Ivo Bligh’s
XI, that would be much easier!”
According to Menzies the judge
beamed with excitement. “Were you
batsman or bowler?” For half-an-hour
they reminisced about cricket and the
judge said that, in all his years on the
bench, he had never been more favor-
ably impressed by a witness. Naturally,
the Menzies client won the case. □

of reading but Eudora a name which
combined with Welty, could only have
come out of the southern states of Am-
erica continued through it into
writing.
Not well known beyond the United
States, she was (is) a brilliant part of the
southern literary scene which is as im-
portant in American fiction as the New
England and New York scenes. She is a
generation later than Katherine Anne
Porter; a contemporary of Robert Penn
Warren and T. S. Stribling; older than
Jean Stafford, Flannery O’Connor and
Carson McCullers. All these writers
have been relegated from library shelves
to the stacks or bins at the school fete.
Sometimes, suddenly, one will re-ap-
pear in paperback to signal a burst of
enthusiasm from some reprint publisher
who has been alerted to a possible or
probable film. So the respected 50s
name is projected into 80s popularity.
Welty, whose great talent is revealed
best in her collections of short stories
portraits of eccentrics, neurotics, out-
siders and individualists was born in
Jackson, Mississippi, in 1909 in the big
bedroom in her father’s house where her
mother read to her, seated in the rock-
ing chair, and she still lives there.
Her father gave her a typewriter and
a dictionary when she was 16. He told
her to write if she wanted to but to find a
way to earn a living, writing not being a
moneymaker. After university, she got a
job as a radio publicist with the
Roosevelt-invented scheme to employ
people during the depression.
Her fiction was much admired by
other writers and brought her critical
acclaim but no wide acceptance until
she was awarded a PUlitzer prize and an
American Book Award for fiction. Later
she became a gold medallist of the Am-
erican Academy and Institute of Arts
and Literature. Her short story collec-
tions include A Curtain of Green, The
Wide Net, The Golden Apples and The
Bride of Innisfalien; her best known
novels are Delta Weddihg and The Pon-
der Heart.
This book is what its title implies. It
is entertaining in an oblique way,
understated and written in three parts
each one of which was a lecture given at
Harvard University ilhder the auspices
of the Harvard History of American
Civilisation.
The relatively recent preoccupation
of biographers and autobiographers
with sexual and social confusions is not
to be found here. Her personality comes
through strongly and attractively.
The last paragraph in this book
should lead readers to look for her idio-
syncratic stories: “As you have seen, I
am a writer who came of a sheltered life.
A sheltered life can be a daring life as
well. For all serious daring starts from
within.” □

by Patricia Rolfe
AN ANGEL at my Table, the second
volume of autobiography by noted New
Zealand writer Janet Frame will come
from Cape on November 22. Frame was
recently awarded the first Turnovsky
prize of $20,000, tax free, from 90
nominations. Czech-born Frederick
Turnovsky, an industrialist, is a notable
figure in chamber music and opera in
New Zealand.
An Angel at my Table covers the
period from the late 1940 s to late 1950 s
when Frame was in and out of mental
homes and began writing a turn of
events which, according to Sydney liter-
ary agent Tim Curnow, saved her from a
lobotomy. Frame lived close to the
Curnows. Allen Curnow, Tim’s father, is
a noted poet.
Tim Curnow has something of a the-
ory that as Australia gained more confi-
dence in the 1970 s it became more self-
sufficient and inward looking. He be-
lieves that Australians may now be less
familiar with New Zealand writing than
they were in the 19605. If this means that
we do not know the work of Janet
Frame, it is our loss.
ROBERT McKay has joined the British
publisher Hutchinson as non-executive
chairman of the Australian subsidiary.

McKay was one of the founders of
Sun Books in 1966. In 1979, after a spell
as managing director of Macmillan’s
general books division he went to Lon-
don as managing director of Macmillan
London. He has been back in Australia
for a couple of years but not in publish-
ing.
ON A winter’s evening in 1860, Joseph
Elliott sat down and began a letter to his
mother in England. The letter turned
into a detailed description of his family,
cottage and furniture, and grew to
14,000 words. “I have written it on
strong though thin paper so that it may
last a long time,” he wrote to his
Mother. The letter remained with the
family for many years then went to the
South Australian archives from which it
was rescued by architect Stefan Pikusa.
It has now been published as Our
Home in Australia by The Flannel
Flower Press which is very much a “cot-
tage” publisher. The Flannel Flower
Press is run by lan Evans, a former Syd-
ney journalist. He began several years
ago with The Lithgow Pottery, and with
the subsequent The Australian Home
and Color Schemes for Old Australian
Houses is developing a useful, and
fashionable, area in publishing. Evans
uses freelance sales reps in all states.
They forward order slips to him and he
fulfils them direct to the bookshop and
pays the reps a commission on sales. So
he has no wholesaler. The arrangement,
he says, works well.
Joseph Elliott’s letter may be the
most detailed description we have of
everyday life in a colonial cottage, as
opposed to life in grander houses. The
book has an introduction by Dr Brian
Elliott, retired reader in Australian Lit-
erary Studies at Adelaide university,
who is Joseph’s grandson.

They hope to improve their distribution

NEIGHBORHOOD
The Maori crisis: paupers
in their own land
The myth of racial equality in New Zealand has been shattered by the disclosure
of a series of statistics on Maori standards of living. lAN TEMPLETON reports
on New Zealand’s other problem.
MAORIS HAVE become deprived citi-
zens in their own land. They can expect
a shorter lifespan, lower earnings,
poorer standards of housing, more diffi-
culty in finding jobs and a greater likeli-
hood of ending up in prison than New
Zealanders of European descent. Maori
infant mortality, crime morbidity and
unemployment are at unacceptably high
levels. All of this points to one con-
clusion: Maoris are in a state of severe
stress and, if something is not done
about it quickly, racial strife and viol-
ence will be inevitable.
This was the verdict not of wild-eyed
radicals but of a government-sponsored
conference in parliament buildings,
called by minister of Maori Affairs
Koro Wetere. With the full backing of
Prime Minister David Lange, Wetere is
seeking to re-direct the energies of his
people into a Maori renaissance. The
task is daunting. Yet the Maori econ-
omic summit displayed an even greater
depth of commitment than the largely
Pakeha (European) economic summit
of the government last month.
The myth of racial equality in New
Zealand, perpetuated largely by white
New Zealanders, has died hard. The
years of economic recession have thrust
the harsh realities into full view. Maoris
make up 35 percent of the unemployed
nationally. The percentage is much
larger in some areas. A Christchurch
youth training organiser, Hori Brennan,
told the conference that unemployment
among Maoris had become the social
and economic disaster of the age.
Maoris were the last to be considered
for permanent jobs because of a lack of
skills, experience, good work habits, at-
titudes to responsibility and authority
and the prejudice and racism of some
employers. “If the anger of the Maori
throughout the nation is not heeded, the
widening gap in race relations will con-
tinue,” he said.
Even government agencies recognise
that they have not done enough to help
the Maori.
The Maori Affairs department re-
ported that the level of Maori home
Prime Minister David Lange: supporting the bid for a Maori renaissance
ownership is low compared with other
New Zealanders. Only about 45 percent
of 60,000 houses occupied by Maori
families are owned by the occupiers,
compared with the overall New Zea-
land level of owner-occupied homes of
72 percent. Many Maoris live in over-
crowded and sub-standard conditions.
Grievances over land are more deep-
seated and harder to assuage. Yet the
conference did not sink, as it might eas-
ily have done, into bitter recrimination
about how the Maoris were deprived of
their ancestral lands.
Instead, the delegates took their cue
from elder statesman Sir James Henare
who urged Maoris not to dwell on the
mistakes of the past. There was no time,
he said, for self pity and vain regrets.
Maoris had to help the government in
finding innovative solutions to econ-
omic problems.
Perhaps because the Maori realises
he is fighting for survival, young Maori
leaders focused, too, on the way in
which language and culture have been
submerged and the Maori made to feel
inferior by the institutions of a
westernised economy. Psychologist
Donna Awatere said the hopes of Maori
children had become stunted and their
dreams turned to pain because tele-
vision and radio taught them they did
not exist. She saw the need for a depart-
ment of Maori broadcasting. Welling-
ton actor Rangimoana Taylor made an
impassioned plea for recognition of the
new Maori who belonged in the city and
for the importance of the arts in Maori
economic development. The chairman
of the Waikato Maori Trust Board,
Steve O’Regan, said the government
should immediately close two teachers’
colleges and re-structure them around a


bilingual and bicultural
curriculum. Such a curricu-
lum, he said, was needed to
remove the incredible bur-
den placed on two-thirds
of all Maori children who
came out of the system
each year as total failures.
Wetere says that to
maintain or perpetuate the
present situation is to court
disaster. The next decade,
he believes, is the make or
break period for the Maori
people. “The bottom line is
that our people must have
an improved standard of living and that
the pace of their development must be
at a quicker pace than the non-Maori.
That will not be done by government
handouts but it must come from re-
directing resources from negative areas
such as social welfare benefits, the dole
and keeping people in prison.”
He sought and won endorsement for
establishment of a Maori economic de-
velopment commission to initiate a de-
velopment plan. The conference also
decided to call for a professional feasi-
bility study on setting up a Maori devel-
opment bank proposed by Victoria
University professor of Finance
Whatarangi Winiata. Existing state
agencies, Winiata believes, have not
provided sufficient resources for a great
leap forward. A Maori bank could help
to finance particularly land-based
Maori business ventures.
The summit recognised that under-
developed Maori land calls for the de-
ployment of finance management skills
and technical expertise. It saw Maori
land and labor development in tandem
as an aspiration for many people
involved in tribal development. The
lack of information on development op-
tions which meet the labor, soil, finan-
cial, climate and transport requirements
of Maori people is a continuing source
of frustration. The conference proposed
regional task forces to help disseminate
information and expert skills to region-
al and tribal groups.
Perhaps one of the most imaginative
ideas to emerge from the conference
came from film actor Zac Wallace who
urged the establishment of an alterna-
tive kind of prison system for Maori
offenders. Wallace said he was qualified
to speak because he had spent the best
part of his life in penal institutions.
He presented statistics which showed
that young Maori criminals risked
spending at least 15 years of their lives
in and out of the penal system if they
offended in their mid-teens. Young
Maoris make up 65 percent of young
people on remand, on probation or in
state custody and 48 percent of the in-
mates in prisons are Maoris. Wallace
notes that Maoris are not equal partici-
Koro Wetere
JOHN SELKIRK
pants in the judicial sys-
tem. Only 8 percent of
police officers and 14 per-
cent of prison officers are
Maoris. In the courts only
1 percent of lawyers and 4
percent of district court
judges are Maoris. An al-
ternative jail using Maori
culture and language and
promoting Maori commu-
nity ideals and needs
would encourage offenders
to develop self-esteem and
confidence, as well as mo-
tivate Maoris to return and
participate positively in society, he said.
Some observers might fear dangers
for New Zealand if it seeks to go down
the road of separate development. But
the great achievement of Wetere at the
summit was to inspire his people to set
out on a decade of development within
the framework of both new and old in-
stitutions. The Maori delegates gave
their commitment in the final session
when they spontaneously sang Arohaina
Mai, a song written for the Maori bat-
talion and traditionally sung at the end
of Maori gatherings. □
THE PACIFIC
Political rifts
divide the
island nations
By STUART INDER
SERIOUS POLITICAL difficulties this
week confront governments of the three
main western Pacific island groups
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands
and New Caledonia.
PNG is faced with seces-
sion threats from some of its
provinces, a split in cabinet
and a final decision on the re-
patriation or otherwise of
10,000 border crossers from
Irian Jaya.
Solomon Islands has just
emerged from a general elec-
tion forced on it by a constitu-
tional crisis which has thrown
up no outright winner. Parties
are attempting to put together
a coalition government with
the support of independents
who hold the balance of
power.
In New Caledonia, ten-
sions have heightened further
as the French overseas terri-
tory approaches the Novem-
ber 18 election date for the
territorial assembly, which most of the
pro-independence Kanak parties will
attempt to disrupt.
A series of violent incidents over the
past few weeks has caused the French
High Commissioner in Noumea,
Jacques Roynette, to warn in a tele-
vision appeal for orderly elections that
he had strengthened “the means at his
disposal” to ensure public order.
In one incident, the home of one of
the European leaders of the pro-inde-
pendence forces, Jean Dion, was petrol
bombed and his car destroyed. Pro-in-
dependence supporters had earlier set
up road barricades to disrupt the annual
international cycle race around the
island.
Opposition forces, in retaliation,
threatened to disrupt the New Cal-
edonia soccer final in Noumea. Fearing
serious racial clashes, Roynette called it
off “until conditions in New Caledonia
improved.”
There are 348 candidates represen-
ting 11 parties contesting the 42-seat as-
sembly. They are elected to four elector-
ates under the proportional representa-
tion system. The main pro-indepen-
dence parties, under the banner of the
Kanak Socialist National Liberation
Front, plan to establish their own pro-
visional government on December 1.
They are boycotting the elections.
The Solomons election was forced
on the government of Prime Minister
Solomon Mamaloni when the opposi-
tion showed that the life of the third
post-independence government had run
out on August 18, not November 6 as
Mamaloni believed and that his govern-
ment held office illegally.
The constitutional crisis was re-
solved when the governor-general fixed
new elections and swore in Mamaloni
to head a caretaker government mean-
while.
Solomon Islands’ 38-seat parliament
MICHAEL ALFORD/UNHCR
Border crossers in quarantine, Papua New Guinea


Blackwater camp, PNG: border crossers cater for their fellows from the sea
(there is no upper house) may be con-
trolled by Mamaloni’s Alliance Party
which has won 12 seats or by the oppo-
sition United Party, led by former prime
minister Sir Peter Kenilorea, with 13.
Mamaloni lost his junior coalition
and most of the independents who sup-
ported him. More than half the sitting
members, including eight ministers, lost
their seats which is not unusual in
Solomons elections where party al-
legiances are never strong.
Independent members and the four
members of a new party, the Solomon
Agu Fenua Party, which was formed be-
fore the elections by disaffected young
public servants, are being wooed by the
major parties before the vote is taken
to elect a new prime minister on
November 14.
But the parliament will be one mem-
ber short. Threats against polling offi-
cials in a Malaita electorate prevented
voting there.
The fortnightly newsletter South Sea
Digest has predicted that, if returned to
power, Mamaloni will move the Sol-
omons toward the status of a republic.
Papua New Guinea’s border prob-
lems, which will be brought to a crucial
stage this week, are being dealt with
against a background of internal politi-
cal upsets.
Cabinet unrest came to a head last
week with the resignation of the minis-
ter for Health, Martin Tovadek, because
of what he terms “frustrations and in-
fighting” in cabinet. He was supported
by the Deputy Prime Minister, Paias
Wingti, who said he was seriously con-
cerned about cabinet and had expressed
his views to Prime Minister Somare.
Some people, Wingti said, had to go.
There have been reports for some
time that Somare’s grip on cabinet and
the Pangu Party has been weakening.
There has also been a revolt by some
of the provincial premiers at a move by
the national government to hold a refer-
endum to decide the future of the prov-
incial government system in PNG.
The referendum is at least 15 months
off but premiers of what are known as
the “islands” provinces last week de-
manded to know what the government’s
motives were and what alternative form
of government would be introduced if
the referendum decided against provin-
cial government.
At a meeting of the premiers in Ra-
baul, former prime minister Sir Julius
Chan himself from the region said
the islands region had nothing to worry
about if it decided to secede. But amid
the anti-central government atmosphere
was a view by the premiers that seces-
sion should be considered only as a last
resort.
The islands region represents almost
a quarter of the population and gener-
ates up to 60 percent offgovernment rev-
enue.
Somare, in a strong attack on the
breakaway movement, said it was
“doomed to fail” and that PNG’s three
million people wanted a reform of prov-
incial government.
The system, which enables each
province to control a big proportion of
its own affairs including the right to
tax was introduced as a result of pres-
sures before independence for secession
by some of the same areas behind the
present moves.
Complaints of provincial govern-
ment waste, mismanagement and cor-
ruption have been frequent and some
administrations have been suspended.
The repatriation of up to 10,000 Irian
Jaya border crossers is expected to be-
gin soon, following a visit to the border
this week by Indonesian and PNG offi-
cials.
The visit follows the signing the pre-
vious week of a new Indonesian-PNG
joint border agreement and work which
has been going on for months in PNG
to sort out genuine refugees from tem-
porary crossers who could easily return
without fear of recrimination.
The joint visit will be aimed at verify-
ing the bona fides of those in the refugee
camps along the border, beginning with
the long-established Blackwater camp
near Vanimo in the north and extending
to the far south.
However, tension is still reported in
some of the refugee camps and fears
persist that people returned to Irian
Jaya may be the victims of guerillas in-
sisting that they decide whether they
will support the Indonesian government
or the rebels.
Security will be stepped up during
the tour, in case of any attacks by the
rebels.
One of the main problems may turn
out to be the refusal of many of the
people to return despite the views of
both Indonesian and PNG officials that
they should go. PNG has made clear
that genuine refugees will be given
asylum. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Boomtime team charges
out of the valley of debt
Promoters Ron Wise and Josse Goldberg have turned the corporate crumbs which
remained when their empire fell flat three years ago into a whole new cake.
DA VID HASELHURST examines a remarkable resurgence.
PERTH BOOMTIME promoters Ron
Wise and Josse Goldberg are back on
their feet less than two years after
handing over most of their business
assets to Alan Bond in a “rescue” oper-
ation that left them with a few corporate
crumbs.
The crumbs comprised a heavily
mortgaged property, two near-bankrupt
companies and some uncertain share
portfolio holdings.
The partners have rebuilt substantial
interests and board control over a group
of public companies with a combined
market capitalisation of $55 million.
They were on the brink of bank-
ruptcy as recently as in December 1981,
after fund-raising plans had collapsed
leaving their flagship Western Continen-
tal Corporation with debts of about $3O
million.
The two entrepreneurs had personal-
ly guaranteed the debts and, as Wise re-
called last week, bill lines secured over
his house were worth nearly double the
value of the property in a weakened real
estate market.
They sat down with Bond on
December 15, 1981, to unburden them-
selves. Bond who, from experience,
must have shared a keen appreciation of
their feelings is reported to have said:
“You fellas ought to stick to dealing
that’s what you’re good at. Forget about
all this investment business.”
Bond assumed all their major
liabilities together with all their most
promising assets in real estate, resources
and shares.
Wise says today: “Bond gave us
breathing space to start again.”
The truncated Western Continental
group was left with:
■ The 2-hectare Swan Brewery site, a
riverside property which had been
acquired for $4.85 million and over
which stood a $4 million mortgage eat-
ing its head off.
■ 50 percent of Caris Corporation,
the listed jewellery merchandiser which
was losing money and in desperate need
of re-organisation.
■ 60 percent of Eastern Petroleum
Rod Wise: back from the brink of bankruptcy
Australia Ltd, over which hung a peti-
tion seeking a wind-up of the company.
Subsequent events, as a result of
complicated debt settlements involving
the Bond group, saw them retain con-
trol also of Black Hill Minerals NL
which has been one of the linchpins of
the group recovery.
At the same time, among personal
assets Bond agreed to leave with
Goldberg and Wise was a majority
holding in a little company called Ran
Data Pty Ltd which was involved in
electronics development including
encryptors to scramble and unscramble
messages. Its future was uncertain, ex-
cept to the believers but it has become
another linchpin of regeneration.
After the stripping of Western Conti-
nental, audited accounts were prepared
to show its sorry position at December
31, 1981. Total assets were reduced to
$14.45 million (down from $42.5 million
at June 30, 1981) and total liabilities
$11.9 million ($25.45 million).
By June 30 the next year after further
extraordinary write-offs and
an operating loss, share-
holders’ funds were in deficit
to the tune of $ 1.1 million and
even then the accounts were
heavily qualified by auditors
Price Waterhouse.
Nevertheless, Wise and
Goldberg got stuck into the
task of restructuring the group
with a small but sound team
of management executives.
They sold off remaining sur-
plus assets, including airy
strata title offices in West
Perth, and moved into a rab-
bit warren of old offices be-
hind the Caris warehouse in a
down-at-heel part of the city’s
Murray Street. Caris Corp’s
jewellery shops and business
were sold and that company’s
activities re-directed into gold
exploration and investment.
They were also lucky the
gold plays in which the
group was heavily invested
ultimately came good.
The old Swan Brewery site was sold
into an associated company with new
funds to reduce its debt and holding
charges. The entire group structure was
gradually remoulded into its present
format (see diagram, page 154). With
the aid of underwriting brokers such as
Jackson Graham Moore and Partners,
new capital was raised by way of place-
ments and share issues in both group
companies and the parent. This enabled
Western Continental to maintain its
equity in associates.
Accounts to be released this month
will show a significant turnaround in
Western Continental’s fortunes, as the
following table shows:
1982 1983 1984
Total liabilities 13.0 m 15.45 m 11.00 m
Total assets 11.9 m 15.90 m 17.085 m
Shareholders’funds -I.lm 0.45 m 6.085 m
Net assets/share —1.3 c
Although the company is still heavily
in debt, the worst is behind it. Of the


Monte Sala: impressed Americans with his data scrambler
latest June 30 liabilities, $10.29 million
is current that is, debt repayable with-
in 12 months.
Since balance date, part of the out-
side debt has been replaced with un-
secured loans from directors up from
$1.24 million at June 30 to $5.24 mil-
lion. That would appear to confirm the
directors’ confidence that they will turn
the show around.
The liabilities also include $2.5 mil-
lion still owing on the brewery site. Di-
rectors have hopes of selling the site at
close to book value, for between $5 mil-
lion and $6 million, in the next few
months.
Apart from the hard work, two
factors have played major roles in pull-
ing the group out of the mire that
good luck with bold investments in gold
plays and the canny gambles which
Wise and Goldberg have made in back-
ing technology innovators such as
Monte Sala’s inventive genius in Ran
Data Pty Ltd.
Sala was developing, in conjunction
with the University of Western Austra-
lia in the latter half of the 19705, an
encryptioning device or data scrambler
with potential applications in high-
security communications and electronic
ic money transfers. Wise and Goldberg
put money into Ran Data and worked
with Sala to sell the idea to Merrill
Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith the
world’s biggest stockbrokers, with total
assets of SUS2S billion and funds under
management exceeding $3OO billion.
Sala and two of his four sons flew to
New York in 1981 and put up a presen-
tation. Merrill Lynch was impressed
and commissioned McKinsey and Co to
carry out a $500,000 study on market-
place potential. As a consequence, Mer-
rill Lynch made its first direct invest-
ment into high technology. It pumped
SUSI. 2 million into Ran Data for a 13
percent interest.
Goldberg and Wise since have trans-
ferred their interest in Ran Data Pty Ltd
into Caris Corp and Merrill Lynch’s in-
terest will be taken over also by the pub-
lic company for shares.
When Caris Corp’s listed name is
changed to Ran Data Corporation Ltd,
Western Continental will hold 25.6 per-
cent of the listed company.
Merrill Lynch will hold
10.4 percent, the Sala fam-
ily 6.6 percent and the pub-
lic the balance of the 62.5
million issued shares.
The public company in
turn will hold 92 percent of
the operating subsidiary,
with minorities associated
with Sala having the bal-
ance.
Apart from the data
scrambler, Ran Data also
will market telemetry sys-
tems for security surveil-
Josse Goldberg
lance and a low-cost electronic moving
sign system known as the Betagraph
display for advertising and informa-
tion billboards.
Ran Data’s world-patented en-
cryptor has a potential market es-
timated at $6 million over the next two
years within Australia where major gov-
ernment departments, banks and the
Australian Building Society network
have adopted it.
But the big growth potential is in
Europe and North America.
The device is priced at around
SAISOO a unit.
In its 1982 study, McKinsey and Co
identified a potential market in the
finance and insurance industry as com-
prising 15,000 banks’ home offices and
36,000 branches plus 25,000 automatic
teller machines. Further market poten-
tial was seen in nearly 5000 brokerage
offices, 500 insurance offices and
100,000 of their agents.
In a study yet to be released, Sydney
brokers Bain and Co have prepared the
following “low-range” earnings
forecasts for Ran Data Corp. They are
based on a Price Waterhouse study and
McKinsey’s market research:
Net Earnings/
Year profit share
1984- o.Bm 1.5 c
1985- I.Bm 3.2 c
1986- 4.0 m 7.0 c
1987- 9.5 m 16.8 c
High range earnings projections are
nearly four times those “most conserva-
tive” forecasts which, if correct, would
put Caris Corp shares on a low poten-
tial price-earnings multiple for a
“hi-tech” stock.
With the recent rise in Caris’ share
price since its 1984 low of 12c, Western
Continental’s holding in its associate
has risen in value from $1.92 million to
$5.28 million more than its own mar-
ket capitalisation.
As for the gold plays, when Western
Continental appeared to be riding high
in early 1981, the company sponsored
two affiliates into new capital raisings:
■ Black Hill Minerals Ltd, in which
WCC at the time retained a 33 percent
interest, raised $5 million
with an issue of 50c shares
to acquire a group of gold
prospects around Sand-
stone. Soon after, the com-
pany paid $300,000 to
prospector Tony Tomich
to buy his 25 percent inter-
est in a block of prospects
north of Kalgoorlie under
joint venture with Occiden-
tal Petroleum of the United
States. But the gold price
fell for most of the year
and Black Hill shares fell
away with it, to 8c by the


‘Believed to be held for Carr Boyd Minerals Ltd.
Listed companies shaded
time Western Continental was on the
skids.
■ Eastern Petroleum Australia Ltd
was even more of a disaster in 1981. it
was put together to acquire a major in-
terest in the Woodada gasfields for
$22.5 million. But, with a downturn in
the market, Perth brokers Hartley
Poynton and Co withdrew their
underwriting support for a $22.5 million
issue. The company’s share price had
collasped to 4c by the time Bond moved
in. Bond took the gasfield interest for
which the company could not pay and
left WCC with the company shell.
Within six months of going through
the Bond wringer, however, the gold in-
vestments started to come good after
WCC had regained control of Black
Hills. Occidental confirmed encoura-
ging gold values on the blocks north of
Kalgoorlie in mid-1982, with one inter-
section of 40 metres averaging
9.42gm/tonne.
Proven and probable open-pit re-
serves stand at 4 million tonnes of
3gm/tonne ore and a mine development
plan is expected soon.
During the proving-up of this de-
posit, Occidental made an expensive
takeover of the City Services oil group
and to help pay for it ordered a world-
wide cutback in exploration. In Austra-
lia, the Kalgoorlie venture was the only
exploration project not affected but
Black Hills was able to negotiate an op-
tion to lift its stake from 25 percent to 45
percent by assuming more of the ex-
ploration expenditure. With a further
share issue underwritten by Jackson
Graham Moore, that exercise was com-
pleted this year.
As a further consequence of Occi-
dental’s pullback from Australia, Bond
Corp last month negotiated a $6O mil-
lion purchase of most of the American
company’s remaining Australian assets
including a 32.6 interest in the Harriet
oilfield off the WA coast, 14.9 percent,
percent of Laurel Bay Petroleum Ltd
and the Kalgoorlie venture.
So Wise and Goldberg are in part-
nership with Bond circumstance they
welcome, particularly since the Bond
group controls the under-utilised treat-
ment facilities at the nearby North
Kalgurli gold mine.
“We’re delighted with Bond Corp’s
takeover of the Occidental interest
Alan will get on with it,” said Wise.
The shell of Eastern Petroleum also
came good. Early in 1982, when the
Kalgoorlie ground began to look prom-
ising, Jackson Graham Moore
underwrote an issue to enable Eastern
Petroleum to acquire for $1.5 million in
cash and shares a 37.5 percent interest
in adjoining ground which today holds
half the group’s Kalgoorlie reserves.
After another underwritten issue
later in that year, Eastern Petroleum
paid $4 million cash plus one million
shares for 35.6 percent of the Horseshoe
Lights gold prospects 160 km north of
Meekatharra.
That venture has commissioned a
plant to produce 55,000 ounces a year
making it Australia’s seventh-largest
gold mine.
With a breakeven of $2OO/oz and
gold at SA4OO/oz, Eastern Petroleum’s
share of current year net profit should
be $3.90 million equivalent to 7.8 c a
share, assuming conversion of 10 mil-
lion outstanding options to lift paid
capital to 50 million shares. At 35c,
the shares are on a prospective
price/earnings ratio of 4.4 based Horse-
shoe Lights alone.
London broker T. C. Coombes and
Co recently described Eastern Petro-
leum as Australia’s cheapest gold stock,
when the shares were under 30c.
In line with the group’s improved
fortunes, Western Continental and as-
sociated companies last December
moved back to West Perth where a
building was bought at the right time
during the city’s commercial office
space slump. A three-year mortgage was
negotiated.
The four-storey building in Ord
Street, fully-tenanted, is valued at
$910,000 This is comfortably above the
purchase price for which Western Con-
tinental completed the acquisition after
balance date.
WCC, at 14c a share, carries a mar-
ket capitalisation of $4.9 million rep-
resenting a modest discount on net
assets of 17.4 c a share but putting no
value on the “blue sky” potential of the
company’s speculative investments, nor
the proven (if volatile) track record of
Wise and Goldberg as entrepreneurs.
Those speculative investments range
from a revolutionary balloon (see
Speculator’s Diary) to a high-rebound
tennis practice net, and interests in po-
tentially lucrative US-based patents in
thermo-technology and a gasfield lifting
system.
Another Perth mining promoter at
the respected end of the scale has recog-
nised some potential in the group. Wise
and Goldberg jointly control 50 percent
of Western Continental but they have
been joined by a 10 percent holding in
the company under the name of Street
Nominees. That interest is believed to be
held for the Bill Galbraith-managed
Carr Boyd Minerals group which, in
turn, has investments in technological
developments and likes the prospects
for this revival. □


MANAGEMENT
The laird of
AMI finally
calls it a day
Former AMI chief John Leard: the fun has gone out of big business
ROBERT DORAN
By DAVID HASELHURST
IT WAS day one of John Leard’s retire-
ment from big business and he was
ready to offer some opinions and advice
... advice to young people seeking a
career in business, his opinion of politi-
cians, his favorite brokers and merchant
bankers, his preferred share investments
and what he sees as his greatest achieve-
ments.
The day before, Leard stepped down
from the board of Australian National
Industries Ltd the company he led for
17 years. During that time, it grew from
a poorly-rated manufacturing company
with $l9 million in annual sales to a
blue-chip stock with sales of more than
a billion dollars a year.
Leard was like the dux at the school
prize night when he appeared for the
final time before ANI shareholders last
week.
A headmasterly chairman, Ted
O’Halloran paid him proud tributes and
admiring shareholders heaped spon-
taneous plaudits on the man who had
shepherded their company into produ-
cing an unprecedented 26 percent com-
pound growth rate in their dividends
over 17 years.
Leard thanked everyone, including
his wife Pam, his five children and his
mother and father all of whom were
there at Sydney’s Regent Hotel.
He told shareholders of two adages
with which his parents had armed
him in his early life. From his 78-year-
old mother Joan: “Whenever you do
anything, give it all you’ve got”; and
from his father Tod, also 78: “You can’t
always make them love you but you can
make them respect you.”
The somehow old-fashioned but re-
assuring folksiness continued after the
annual meeting with tea and cakes in
the foyer. The big day finished with the
directors hosting Leard and his family
to a testimonial dinner attended by
senior executives, Leard’s secretary
Erica Hassett and his chauffeur Stan
Macready. The Leards were presented
with a silver service.
Television viewers may remember
Leard in his safari suit standing among
the sober suits at the economic summit
in Canberra last March.
Never one for the traditional execu-
tive look, he wore a sports coat for his
last formal appearance at the annual
meeting and the next day a maroon
skivvy with leather jacket when he came
down to Sydney from his Blue Moun-
tains home to do a bit of private busi-
ness, have lunch with a friend and see
The Bulletin.
For once his day had begun late. He
slept in after staying out “till all hours”
with his children at a disco. As chief
executive of ANI he followed a rigid
timetable beginning with a 6am run be-
fore travelling down to his office in the
industrial suburb of Lidcombe in the
company’s chauffeur-driven Cadillac.
Leard still insists that he has retired
from corporate life to devote himself to
his family, his sporting activities and a
rural property he bought two years ago
in the foothills of the mountains behind
Mittagong. Although he is still a very
young and fit 49, he says he will not go
back into big business or accept any
board positions - and he has rejected
many since he stepped down from the
managing-directorship of ANI on June
30 and finally retired from the board
last week.
Leard’s sporting activities are not
those of a retiree. He is looking forward
to competing in masters tournaments in
golf and athletics. He can still run 100
metres in 12.3 seconds and in 1981 rep-
resented Australia at the world veteran
athletics championships in Christ-
church.
“I’ve still got the same body
measurements I had at 25,” he said
but declined to disclose them for The
Bulletin photographer Robert Doran
also takes photographs for Cleo.
We asked Leard to name his favorite
brokers and merchant bankers in those
operations which saw major listed
forms such as Capitol Motors and
Comeng folded into ANI.
Although he has used various mer-
chant banking firms such as Martin
Corporation and BT Australia, the man
he nominated was Peter Joseph of
Rainsford Investments, which now acts
as a consultant to BT Australia.
“I first met him when he was at Mar-
tin Corporation in 1970 and in all major
takeovers he has had some role to play,”
said Leard. “I regard him as the most
outstanding takeover operator in Aus-
tralia in the advisory and merchant
banking area.”
For his dealers in the stock-broking
area he picked Clive Powell of T. C.
Powell and Partners and Powell’s Mel-
bourne partner Frank Buckle, together
with Brent Potts of Potts, West and
Trumbull and Co. For underwriting he
sticks with J. B. Were and Son.
In his years at ANI, his proudest mo-
ment was when the US investment
bankers Kidder Peabody and Co named
his company as having the greatest
growth record of any company its size
in the western world. His other greatest
achievements, as he sees them, were the
1977 takeover of Capitol Motors (which
doubled earnings but increased issued
capital by only one-third), the Comeng
takeover, the great battle to get Coates
Hire and the building of the manage-
ment team he has left behind.
Leard said he had no regrets about
the course of his career but if a young
person who wished to make a mark in
business asked his advice, it would be
different to the course he followed.
“Twenty years ago, I would have
said big business is the place to go and
have fun. But, with all the bureaucratic
controls that politicians have now in-
troduced, the fun has gone out of it.
“There are more opportunities today
in small business if you have some en-
trepreneurial flair and capacity to be a
freelance.
“But you still need basic qualifica-
tions in some particular persuasion and
accountancy is still the best basic train-
ing.”
And while he declined to name the
contemporaries he most respected in the


business world, he made an exception
for Arnold Glass, former deputy chair-
man of AN I and the creator of Capitol
Motors.
“I’ve never been in the position
where I’ve been able to admire someone
up the tree but I would add one other
name W. J. Smith.” (“Gunboat”
Smith was the autocratic boss who
forged Australian Consolidated Indus-
tries into a monopoly national
glassmaker.)
“When I was a 19-year-old audit ac-
countant with Smith Johnson, I used to
take papers around to him. He took a
shine to me and we often had long con-
versations. What I learned from him
most was the tough decisions can’t be
avoided and businesses that fail usually
do so because the managers are too
weak to take tough decisions.”
Interestingly, W. J. Smith did not re-
tire from the helm of ACI until he was
74 in 1957. Leard has taken that step at
49 but a lot of people will be watching
to see if he stays out for more than a few
years. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Up, up and away ...
IT WOULD not be overstating matters
to suggest that the balloon which rose
over Western Australia last week to set a
world record may well symbolise the re-
surgence in the fortunes of west coast
entrepreneurs Ron Wise and Josse
Goldberg. Their prime company, West-
ern Continental Corporation, owns the
balloon, with which it is planned to
launch a circumnavigation of the world
next May.
Our main business story this week
examines the revival of Wise and
Goldberg and that Western Continental
is selling below its net asset backing and
carrying no “blue sky” in its share price
for the wild cards the company holds.
The balloon is one of those.
Western Continental has put up $1
million to build the “super pressure”
balloon and underwrite a crossing from
Perth to Sydney, due to launch next
week. British adventurer and physicist
Julian Nott, who designed the balloon,
took off from Cunderdin airstrip (160
kilometres east of Perth) last week to
demonstrate successfully for the first
time a lighter-than-air craft designed to
withstand 1000 times more gas pressure
than can regular balloons. This will en-
able long flights such as the never-at-
tempted round-the-world project.
How Wise and Goldberg became
involved is another story, reflecting
their good contacts.
Nott and his Endeavour 84 commit-
tee in London calculated that the best
point at which to enter the jetstream for
the round-the-world attempt was 30 de-
gree south of the equator at a height of
38,000 ft (1076 m). They picked Perth
and approached Roland Becker then
executive director of Advance Australia
who introduced them to Wise and
Goldberg.
some 54 British, American and Aus-
tralian companies are involved in sup-
ply and support services in the attempt.
For Western Continental, the spin-offs
are:
■ Establishing a commercial rapport
with major overseas companies such
as Litton, Du Pont and Rockwell
which will help open doors in other
places and
■ Opportunities to lease the balloon
overseas for fund-raising projects
linked with its flight.
For reasons expanded on in the main
business story, I think that Western
Continental is a good punt for a rise.
Apart .from that, another stock in the
portfolio took quite a surge last week
when Meekatharra Minerals’ annual re-
port came out and confirmed that the
company was back in the running to
supply South Australia’s planned new
1000 megawatt power station with coal
from Meekatharra’s Wintinna deposits.
I must now confess to a recent gaffe
in selling Kalgoorlie Southern Gold
Mines NL too soon out a week ago, at
$1.50, for a profit of 25c a share. The
shares shot to $1.75 last week after the
company parent (Universal Milling Co
Pty Ltd, which holds 51 percent) an-
nounced that it was selling its major
wholly-owned operating subsidiary into
Kalgoorlie Southern for $900,000 half
its net asset backing. KSGM shares will
also be doubled through a split.
If (as seems likely) the 47 share-
holders in the privately-owned parent
follow with a wind-up and distribution
of assets to put the cash and KSGM
shares into individual hands, the biggest
shareholder would have only 11 per-
cent. It would then be open to a poten-
tial takeover raider. As a joint partner
with Western Mining in the Three
Springs talc mine, an unwanted mirier
would no doubt be topped by the : ' big
guns.” 4

AVIATION
Qantas going in
big to the
smaller centres
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
AUSTRALIA’S new international gate-
ways cities such as Perth, Adelaide,
Darwin, Cairns and Townsville can
expect a big increase in the number of
flights from next year, according to
Qantas director of corporate planning,
Peter Stainlay.
The changes, which mark a major
switch in the airline’s operating
philosophies, will follow the arrival of
the new twin-engined Boeing 767-
200ERs next year. Qantas has six of the
200-passenger jets on order.
Because they carry fewer than half
the passengers of the Boeing 7475, at
present Qantas’ only aircraft type, the
smaller planes will allow more flights in
and out of centres that at the moment
cannot fill the big aircraft.
Stainlay, speaking at the recent
Ansett travel writers’ seminar in Surfers
Paradise, outlined the airline’s new
strategy for the first time.
The first two 767 s a heavier, long-
range version of the type that Ansett
uses on domestic flights are to arrive
in July and be used mainly on Tasman
services, specifically to free the airline’s
mini-jumbos (the 7475 P) from Welling-
ton.
The high-performance SPs are
Qantas planner Peter Stainlay: a new
strategy outlined
needed because of the short runway in
Wellington. But they are designed
mainly for super long-range operations
and Qantas would like to use them full-
time on non-stop flights across the Pa-
cific, an important part of its strategy to
win the business traveller.
The last four 767s will be delivered
late in the year and early in 1986.
Final plans are yet to be made but
proposals include some of the “thinner”
Tasman services, such as Brisbane to
Christchurch, and elsewhere an increase
in schedules to places such as Port
Moresby and Noumea and to Fiji out of
Melbourne.
Qantas marketing people believe the
increased number of flights will give
the airline a competitive edge. Already
Singapore Airlines is putting pressure on
Qantas and the Australian government
to get additional flights each week out of
Perth and Brisbane to meet the chal-
lenge of the proposed higher Qantas
frequencies.
The promise of the 767 s was also an
important element in the rivalry be-
tween Ansett and Qantas to take over
the management of Air Pacific, Fiji’s
loss-making airline.
Qantas got into the competition for
Air Pacific’s affections later than its ri-
vals but put a successful effort into
wooing the carrier and the government,
headed by Prime Minister Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara.
Because of Air Pacific’s disastrous
losses, which already total about 10 per-
cent of the country’s gross domestic
product, Mara took personal charge of
the negotiations which resulted in
Qantas winning the contract to run the
ailing airline.
The technical differences between its
767 s and those operated by Ansett
played a major part in swinging the
Qantas bid through.
Ansett’s 767 s have nothing like the
range of the new Qantas aircraft, which
will be able to operate as far as Hono-
lulu out of Fiji’s Nadi Airport.
Ansett’s are also more expensive to
operate, with three-man crews against
the standard two-man crews Qantas will
use.
Qantas has faced a lot of flak from
Fiji which resented the airline’s decision
in the 1970 s to overfly Nadi on Pacific
services between the United States and
Canada and Australia. The use of the
big 747 s and the competition to provide
the fastest flights forced Qantas to ser-
vice Fiji with only a limited number of
flights from Sydney and this badly hurt
the nation’s tourism.
Now, Nadi looks like coming back
into its own.
A new pattern of travel marketing is
emerging in the Pacific.
The industry has noted a distinct
preference by Americans and Japanese
to organise an itinerary which includes
visits to several places as well as the
major destinations of Australia or New
Zealand.
Fiji is the logical place to collect and
distribute these tourists. And the new,
efficient, twin-engined aircraft offer the
flexibility that will make the concept
work. □

That was the
travel advice I
needed to help
me make an
important
decision. When I was planning my
trip I’d been inclined to give the Trade
Fair a miss. However, I was in two
minds - after all, Amsterdam was on
my way to London, and it was
possible the Fair could prove valuable.
It was my ANZ Business Travel
Consultant’s grasp of the situation
that finally decided me. He knew of a
hotel close to the Trade Fair, close to
the city centre and right by the
museums I’d always hoped to visit. It
made it all so easy So I stopped over,
at very little cost - and my business is
all the better for it. I’m grateful to
ANZ Business Travel for tipping the
scales in the right direction.
At ANZ Travel they understand

WILDCAT
A new catch from the fiscal fiend
EITHER the gremlins are at work in the
tax office’s assessing system or property
investors face a crackdown from the
taxman.
Last week the eyes of one taxpayer,
let’s call him Mr A, lit up as they beheld
the anticipated mail from the tax office
before them. Mr A was expecting a re-
bate of around $7OO for the 1983-84 tax
year after promptly shooting in his re-
turn in July. Opening the letter, his
own calculations and trip to the
Whitsundays disappeared. His rebate
was not $7OO but a touch over zero.
A letter with the assessment told Mr
A that the office had decided not to al-
low the interest paid on borrowings to
fund a property investment that ex-
ceeded the income generated by that
property investment.
Some figures illustrate Mr A’s di-
lemma. He invested $60,000 in a pri-
vately listed property trust a few years
back. The trust purchased all the prop-
erties in its portfolio of some $6O mil-
lion outright, that is, there were no bor-
rowings. However the trustee arranges
finance for its investors through an as-
sociated financier. Mr A “geared” his
investment with $21,000 of his own
funds plus $39,000 borrowed.
In the 1983-84 year, his income from
the trust shares, received as distribu-
tions, was around $5OOO and his outgo-
ings in expenses and interest were $6OOO
for an overall loss on the investment of
$lOOO. Mr A expected to be able to
claim the loss as a deduction against
other income he earned during the year.
Mr A had always been allowed the de-
duction in the past. So, fired up, he
plans to lodge a letter of protest with the
department.
What may scare property investors is
that the taxman’s action smacks very
much of a crackdown on the practice of
negative gearing where investors ar-
range borrowings on property so that
the outgoing expenses mainly inter-
est, exceed the income mostly rent.
In June last year Treasurer Paul
Keating made a firm statement that
negative gearing was fair go and that the
resulting losses were claimable. The
Treasurer’s action came after the
Victorian Taxation office had sent
shivers down the spines of many prop-
erty investors who had very highly
geared property investments.
A senior Canberra tax official said
Mr A’s case does not signal any change
of attitude by the government on nega-
tive gearing. Another official confirmed
this. It appears that one reason for the
office’s action in Mr A’s case may be its
attitude to level of the interest rate paid
on the borrowings during the year.
If the interest rate appeared to have
been charged at “an exorbitant or
unrealistic rate” the office claimed it
would probably reduce the amount of
the interest allowed as a deduction
down to the amount of the dividend or
income derived.
The trustee of Mr A’s property trust
told The Bulletin that the interest rate
charged is directly related to the mort-
gage rate ruling at the time. Last week,
for instance, the trust was paying inter-
est of 13 percent on borrowings against
a 13.75 percent mortgage rate, which
appears to rule out any argument of an
unrealistic rate.
Casino quandary
THE NORTHERN Territory govern-
ment could find itself in a financial mire
over its intervention to localise
ownership of Darwin’s Mindil Beach
and the Alice Springs casino. Its chosen
vehicle, Henry and Walker Ltd the
sole NT listed company is facing
problems.
Henry and Walker reported a loss of
$2.4 million in the 1983/84 year, put up
some of its choice assets for sale at a
Sydney auction last week and, accord-
ing to Darwin calculations, could
become the victim of a takeover raid.
However, any such takeover won’t
succeed without the consent of the
founders and directors, who reportedly
control 62 percent of the capital.
The assets for sale a 3400 square
kilometre cattle station, a Darwin
harborside site and four prawning
trawlers with licences were expected
to yield about $3 million, according to
Darwin estimates.
The sale, joint managing director
Neville Walker said, would allow the
company to narrow its range of activi-
ties and focus on the new tourism
developments.
Paul Everingham, in his last major
move as chief minister (he resigned to
contest the federal election) pushed
legislation through parliament to take
over the casinos from Federal Pacific
Hotels Ltd and hand a majority interest
to a local property trust, of which Henry
and Walker would hold 57 percent.
As valuations are contested in the
range between $47 and $55 million, the
company has to raise something like $lB
million.
Why a takeover?
Those who have been doing their
sums in Darwin are looking at govern-
ment estimates of the tax take from
gambling profits. The yield on an 8
percent tax rate is put at $1.25 million
and points to a predicted profit of $15.6
million. This would yield $8.9 million
for a 57 percent interest, more than
enough to cover interest costs in the
now fashionable cash-flow takeover
model. □

THE CHARTIST
The charge of
the industrials
by Russell Lander
THE CHARGE in the industrial
market since mid-year has been
led by a number of heroes. These
include Nicholas Kiwi, FAI,
Mayne Nickless, Industrial
Equity, John Fairfax, Boral, Lend
Lease and MLC. Our spotlight
falls on the latter two stocks.
These are related by virtue of
Lend Lease’s ownership of 49.45
percent of MLC which in turn
has 14.44 percent of Lend Lease
in the bag via the investment
portfolio of MLC’s subsidiary
The Mutual Life & Citizens As-
surance Company Limited. At the
end of June 1984 MLC was
priced at $18 and Lend Lease the
equivalent of $4.27, if adjustment
is made for the recent 1 for 10
bonus issue. Since then MLC has
been as high as $31 (up 72 per-
cent on the June 30 level) and
Lend Lease has been up to an
adjusted $5.91 (correspondingly
+ 38.4 percent).
The Bridge Data weekly bar
charts bring these moves into fo-
cus. Both stocks have run ahead
of their 15-week moving averages
denoted by asterisks. This phe-
nomenon is generally a pointer
to a period of consolidation or
retracement as it is indicative of a
stock having run up too quickly.
It would not be surprising, there-
fore, for both stocks to have a
pause for breath before attempt-
ing further upside objectives.
The third chart shows the rela-
tive strength of MLC to Lend
Lease over the past two years,
readings above the line represen-
ting weeks in which MLC had
the upper hand and, conversely,
below the line. In fact over the
two years MLC was the stronger
stock in 61 percent of the read-
ings while the area above the line
represented 69 percent of the
total area covered by the data.
Both stocks have outrun any
upside targets which could be de-
duced from these charts. The re-
cent strength of MLC has also
rubbed off on Industrial Equity’s
share price, IEL holding 19.9
percent of MLC most of which
was purchased below $8.
The writer discloses a shareholding
in MLC.

The most taxing question
“THE AMOUNT of political noise which
is generated in opposition to proposals for
tax reform usually varies inversely with
the rationality of the counter-arguments
or assertions which are advanced, the
justice and reasonableness of the oppos-
ing claims, and the strength of the case
for continuing to favor the narrow
sectional interests which those who resist
change seek to protect to the detriment of
the wider public interest. ”
The quotation is from Pro-
fessor Russell Mathews, who
rejoices in the jaw-breaking
title of Director of the Centre
for Research on Federal
Financial Relations at the
Australian National Univers-
ity. Pierpont put it at the head
of this week’s column because
it sums up so nicely the tax
debate which has been dragg-
ing its way so painfully
through the media for the past
few weeks.
Professor Mathews is also,
far from incidentally, one of
Australia’s foremost authori-
ties on taxation. He may not
always be right about tax, but
he has made taxation his life’s
work, and he is expert, ex-
perienced and politically un-
biased on the subject.
Given these credentials, and given
the fact that taxation has been the
dominant issue in the election cam-
paign, to the point where Pierpont has
taken up reading the Commonwealth
Gazette as light relief, one would have
thought our major political parties
would have been eager to seek his views.
Surprisingly, this has not been the
case, so it has been left to your scribe to
do so.
When Pierpont rang the good pro-
fessor, your correspondent discovered
he was about as welcome as influenza.
Professor Mathews, it turns out, thinks
that the chances of getting a rational
taxation debate during an election cam-
paign are somewhere below the chances
of an Irishman with a brown paper
parcel getting a hotel booking at
Brighton.
But your correspondent did manage
to dig up a copy of a speech, entitled
“The Mythology of Taxation”,
delivered by Professor Mathews to a tax
reform seminar last June. In it, he said:
“It would be difficult to improve on the
present arrangements if we deliberately
set out to design a tax system that
requires the poor to pay more taxes than
many of the rich; if we deliberately
wanted to discriminate against wage
and salary earners and the proprietors
of small businesses; if we deliberately
decided to distort production decisions
and consumer choice; if we deliberately
sought to destroy incentives to save,
invest, innovate, take risks and
undertake productive activity while
simultaneously rewarding speculative
activity and providing incentives as well
as opportunities for avoiding and
evading tax; and if we deliberately set
out to make the tax system as complex,
cumbersome, confusing and costly to
administer and comply with as poss-
ible.”
Apart from the disparaging reference
to speculators, Pierpont agrees.
One only has to consider the case of
the tyre retreaders who were slugged for
sales tax by the Taxation Office, even
though they were not legally liable to
pay it. The tax boys nevertheless
extorted the tax from them and even
though the retreaders have since won a
court ruling that the tax was illegal, the
Taxation Office refuses to hand the
money back and is appealing.
Meanwhile, we have all been paying 20
percent more for our retreads.
Mathews went on to say that wage
and salary earners and small businesses
had suffered severely under the tax
system in recent years.
Small business had been adversely
affected by the combined effects of
inflation, the form in which company
taxes were imposed and the measure-
ment of taxable income by reference to
historical costs. “Together these create
massive liquidity problems for the very
firms which, if they are to prosper and
grow even when economic conditions
are favorable, usually have all the
liquidity problems they can handle.
“We should not be surprised that
much of the impetus for tax avoidance
has come from the proprietors of small
businesses, many of whom have seen
cheating the tax system as a necessary
response to what they regard
as cheating by governments.”
Next he attacked the
notion that income repre-
sented the best measure of
ability to pay. Indeed, he did
not even concede that income
could be measured con-
sistently or systematically.
“Having spent some 20
years of my life studying the
theory and measurement of
income, I have come to the
conclusion that business
income is unmeasurable, even
for the normal purposes of
business management and
reporting and certainly for the
purposes of taxation,” he said.
The professor has thus
penetrated one of the inner
secrets of management ac-
counting. What, when you come down
to it, is a company’s income for the
year? Should depreciation be deducted?
Should the bad debts provision be
deducted? What do we do with income
due but not received? Should expendi-
ture on development projects be
capitalised or written off against profit
and loss?
From this the professor claims it
follows that:
■ Income is not a satisfactory measure
of ability to pay tax
■ Because of the opportunities for
avoidance and evasion which it pre-
sents, income tax ranks low on the
overall scale of tax effectiveness and
provides differing opportunities for
non-compliance for different income
classes and groups of taxpayers
■ A nominally progressive rate structure
does not necessarily make the rich pay
more tax than the poor, although it is
likely to make wage and salary earners
pay more than other groups with com-
parable abilities to pay tax
■ An income tax is consequently a weak
instrument for achieving vertical and
horizontal equity


So what does Mathews advocate?
The answer is a tax system, of which the
main features are:
1. Scrap the present income and com-
pany tax systems and replace them with
a “linear cash flow tax.” This would be
at a lower rate than the existing
standard rate and the exemption level
should be pitched in line with social
welfare payments. The tax base would
include all cash receipts net of outlays,
which means that capital expenditures
and purchases of inventories would be
deducted but proceeds of sales of assets
would be included.
2. Introduction of a broadly-based
value added tax (VAT) on the grounds
that taxes are more equitably and just as
easily imposed at the consumption end
as at the income end. Pierpont would
pay less income tax but more for caviar.
3. Greater reliance on earmarked
taxes, particularly for education, health
and welfare. This suggestion would at
last remove education from the political
arena and if properly implemented
would provide a properly funded
national superannuation scheme.
4. Introduction of annual taxes on net
wealth, at a modest rate above a
generous exemption level, along with
reintroduction of death duties. Your
correspondent does not mind the death
duties, because he has always reckoned
that will be a problem for his
beneficiaries, not himself. But he would
strongly opposed a wealth tax. There is
a world of difference between taxing
unrealised, as opposed to realised,
capital gains.
But never fear none of these things
is ever likely to be introduced. They
would be too politically costly for the
government introducing them.
So there is the prognosis. The present
system, designed to give us the worst of
all possible worlds, will continue to
creak along.
And Pierpont’s only consolation is
that he never buys tyres from retreaders.
CHESS
The tyranny of the clock
by Terrey Shaw
THERE HAVE been many times when,
left with less than a minute to make 10
or so moves on pain of forfeiting the
game on time, I have roundly cursed the
invention of the chess clock.
Games weren’t timed until well into
the 19th century, often being tests of en-
durance rather than skill. A tendency to
try to outsit, rather than outplay one’s
opponent (cleverly conveyed by the
German word sitzfleisch) was
picturesquely condemned in a letter to a
19th century American magazine:
“Time is the capital of our country,
and only a degree less valuable than
credit with our banker. Juries, ere now,
have convicted men, and judges have
hanged them, to save time. Railway
companies at the present day break our
legs, and sometimes our necks, to save
time. Our chessplayers are the only men
in this busy country who disregard it
and are insensible to its value.”
Games were first timed with an hour-
glass, one for each player, which was
placed horizontally on the table for the
player not moving. The first mechanical
chess clocks were developed in the
1880 s. The clock adds an extra sporting
element to the game, as you have to beat
it as well as your opponent. At the faster
time limits, chess has become a specta-
tor sport.
Perhaps the most successful victory
over the clock occurred in New York in
1931. The American master, Sidney
Bernstein, arrived late for his game, 1
hour and 59 minutes after his clock had
been started. The time limit regulations
required that each player make 40
moves in 2 hours each. As Bernstein had
White and had yet to make his first
move, his opponent still had a full 2
hours on his clock. Bernstein took half a
minute to toss off his coat, sit down at
the table, and start moving. He played
38 moves in less than the half minute
remaining on his clock and the game
ended in a draw.
Sammy Reshevsky is probably the
player best known for exciting clock
races. In the following game, played in
New York in 1942, both players had
only minutes left to get from move 30 to
the time control on move 45.

SPECIAL REPORT
After Indira
The body ofPrime Minister Gandhi lies in state at her father’s old residence in New Delhi: An act of ritual slaughter motivated by nationalists
A brutal act of revenge by Sikh bodyguards plunges India into a deadly crisis.
Indira Gandhi had spent the early morn-
ing with two of her grandchildren. Now
it was time to leave her bungalow and stroll
the hundred yards or so through the garden
to her office, where actor Peter Ustinov
waited to interview her for a television doc-
umentary. As Mrs. Gandhi and her security
men approached the gate between the resi-
dential and working sides of her 10-acre
compound, they saw the familiar figure of
Beant Singh, 33, a trusted member of her
bodyguard for nearly eight years. Nearby
stood a young constable; like his colleague,
he wore the beard and turban of the Sikh
religion. The younger man had raised his
sten submachine gun—in salute, the other
guards thought. Then Beant Singh drew a
revolver and fired five shots into Mrs. Gan-
dhi, while the constable snapped down the
muzzle of his sten gun and sprayed her with
bullets. The prime minister spun around
with a quiet little gasp and crumpled to the
ground, her saffron-colored sari already
soaked with blood.
The rest of the drama followed a sicken-
ingly familiar pattern: the struggle with the
assailants, the frantic rush to the hospital
in a blood-spattered car, the operating
room full of desperate surgeons trying ev-
erything within the scope of their skill and
technology. Sometimes on these occasions,
the victim is saved, as were President Rea-
gan and Pope John Paul 11. This time, after
five hours of heroic but hopeless measures,
an official of Mrs. Gandhi’s Congress (I)
Party appeared before a crowd of 100,000
Indians waiting outside the hospital and
announced simply: “She is no more.”
Three days later a funeral was conduct-
ed on the huge and turbulent scale that
only India can muster. More than 1 mil-
lion anguished, angry people poured into
the streets of New Delhi to watch as Mrs.
Gandhi’s body, draped in the green, saf-
fron and white Indian flag, was transport-

ed on a gun carriage to a riverbank crema-
tion site. There, as kings, presidents and
prime ministers looked on, the body was
placed atop a funeral pyre of fragrant san-
dalwood. Mrs. Gandhi’s son and succes-
sor, Rajiv, walked around the pyre, setting
it afire with a wooden torch. The flames
roared up, then slowly died down. When
the fire was reduced to smoldering ash, the
people went away bitterly.
Vengeance: The assassination of Indira
Gandhi was an act of pure and pointless
vengeance—the life of India’s prime minis-
ter in payment for the lives that were lost
last June when she sent her Army to root out
the armed Sikh separatists who had holed
up in the Golden Temple of Amritsar, their
holiest shrine. “We have taken our re-
venge,” boasted the inevitable anonymous
caller. “Long live the Sikh religion!” Al-
though their high priests and some of their
moderate political leaders deplored the as-
sassination, some Sikhs in India and over-
seas celebrated it, openly and indecently.
The answering round of atrocities began
almost immediately with cries of “Blood for
blood.” As Mrs. Gandhi’s battered body lay
in state, mobs rampaged through cities and
across the countryside, killing hundreds of
Sikhs, burning their cars and sacking their
houses and shops. The Sikhs fought back,
and one newspaper, The Statesman, report-
ed that the damage was “the worst in Delhi
since [the] 1947 partition,” when Hindus
and Muslims slaughtered each other by the
thousands.
As the chaos began, the leadership of
India was quickly transferred to Mrs.
Gandhi’s 40-year-old son Rajiv, an unas-
suming man who was groomed for the suc-
cession only after his more ambitious
younger brother died in a plane crash. The
new prime minister belongs to democracy’s
most durable dynasty; his mother and her
father, Jawaharlal Nehru, governed India
for 32 of the 37 years since independence.
But Rajiv Gandhi has not yet shown that he
possesses either the idealistic vision of his
grandfather or the pragmatic toughness of
his mother. India needs those qualities des-
perately. With ethnic tensions rising all the
time, there is no guarantee that the Indian
democracy can remain governable.
Fervor: Ripples from the tragedy in New
Delhi spread quickly. The Soviet Union
provoked an angry reac-
tion from the United
States by hinting that the
CIA had been involved,
somehow, with the ter-
rorists who killed Mrs.
Gandhi. In fact, the as-
sassination was an act of
ritual slaughter motivat-
ed by nationalistic fervor
and a sense of ancient
grievance. It was an-
other sign that terrorism
has become a new form
of warfare, at times
fought one-on-one. On
his way to Mrs. Gand-
hi’s funeral, Secretary of
State George Shultz said
that “we in the United
States have to wake up”
to the fact that “terror-
ism is a major interna-
tional problem.”
Indira Gandhi may
have sensed what was
coming. Campaigning
for a national election
that was expected to be
called soon, she faced huge crowds with
relatively little protection. “I don’t mind if
my life goes in the service of the nation,” she
said the night before her death, as she spoke
on the hustings in the state of Orissa. “If I
die today, every drop of my blood will invig-
orate the nation. ’’She died the next day, and
her blood was shed copiously. As he waited
outside her office, Peter Ustinov heard the
shots —firecrackers, someone told him at
first. There was silence, eerily punctuated
by the chirping of birds in the garden. Then
came more shots, apparently aimed at the
assassins. By the time Ustinov and his crew
were allowed to look around the compound,
Mrs. Gandhi was in the hospital. “The gar-
den reminded me of the scene in ‘Gandhi,’
the film, where [Mohandas] Gandhi was
shot in a garden,” Ustinov told an
interviewer.
Fatal Wounds: While three of Mrs. Gan-
dhi’s guards wrestled with the attackers, the
other two helped carry her to a car. With her
head in the lap of her daughter-in-law Sonia,
the 66-year-old prime minister was rushed
to the All-India Institute of Medical Sci-
ences. She appeared to be in a coma when she
got there; she may have been dead on arrival.
“Anyone with so many bullets in them can-
not survive,” said one of the doctors who
tried to revive her in the emergency room.
Nonetheless, Mrs. Gandhi was wheeled into
an operating room where a team of 12 doc-
tors tried to restore her heartbeat. But 16
bullets had struck vital spots, piercing the
aorta, lungs and liver. The doctors ordered
massive blood transfusions; they attempted
a heart bypass and tried to remove some of
the bullets. Finally, at 2:20 p.m., the medical
superintendent of the institute, Dr. A. N.
Safaya, was forced to acknowledge: “The
prime minister is dead. ”
Mourners: Some demanded a payment of ‘blood for blood’
By then, one of her attackers was dead,
too —shot while trying to escape, it was said.
Beant Singh and his accomplice, Satwant
Singh, 21, had been taken prisoner after
they shot Mrs. Gandhi. But sources claimed
that as they were being led away, the two
men attempted to grab the weapons held by
their captors. The enraged guards opened
fire. Beant Singh was killed on the spot, his
body riddled by 40 bullets. Young Satwant
Singh was hit by 11 shots, but late last week
he was still alive. Army intelligence experts
and police officers were standing by in
hopes of interrogating him.
The obvious question was whether the

two men had acted alone. So far there was
no solid evidence that anyone had helped
them. But common sense, if nothing else,
suggested that other Sikhs might have been
involved. “One certainly would not want
to rule out the possibility of a wider con-
spiracy,” said a Western diplomat in New
Delhi. He noted that Sikh militants “have

been saying this would happen since
June.” The Indian newspaper The States-
man claimed that Satwant Singh, along
with other Sikhs, had taken an oath to kill
Mrs. Gandhi —and to murder Rajiv Gan-
dhi and Indian President Zail Singh, him-
self a Sikh. The paper also charged that the
murder ring “was being masterminded” by
an Army “major general based in
Chandigarh,” the Punjab capital.
The Defense Ministry denied that
the Army was involved in any
plot. But at the prime minister’s
residence, all of the guards were
changed, just in case a conspiracy
was afoot.
Trust: With or without the help
of other plotters, the two Singhs (a
name shared by all male Sikhs)
clearly had coordinated their own
activities. Beant Singh had been
scheduled for duty on Wednes-
day afternoon. Pleading personal
problems, he swapped shifts with
another security man, so that he
would be on duty in the morning,
when his accomplice was sched-
uled to stand guard. Then he used
his seniority to wangle an assign-
ment that allowed him to move
around the compound freely.
There was nothing unusual about Beant
Singh’s role on Wednesday. Mrs. Gandhi
herself had praised him a few months ago
when a foreign reporter asked whether she
felt safe with Sikhs guarding her. By one
account, Beant Singh was so thoroughly
trusted that he regularly was selected
to drive Mrs. Gandhi’s grandchildren
to school.
Satwant Singh returned from leave only
two days before the shooting. He came from
Gurdaspur in the Sikh-dominated state of
Punjab; his home district is a stronghold for
followers of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale,
the militant preacher who died when the
Golden Temple was stormed. Satwant
Singh had spent several weeks in troubled
Gurdaspur, from which hundreds of
Sikhs—including women, children and old
people —have been sent to government de-
tention camps. Possibly some of his own
friends or relatives had been incarcerated as
suspected terrorists. When he reported for
duty on Wednesday morning, Satwant
Singh complained of stomach problems and
asked to be posted near one of the buildings
in Mrs. Gandhi’s compound, so that he
would have access to a bathroom. He was
assigned to guard the gate in the hedge that
divides the compound (sketch). Beant Singh
joined him, and there, under an arch of

bougainvillea, the two Sikhs gunned down
the prime minister.
As the doctors struggled fruitlessly to
save Mrs. Gandhi, her cabinet ministers
huddled in small groups along the hospital
corridors and held a meeting in a ground-
floor conference room. Most of them owed
their careers to Mrs. Gandhi, and at first
they were stunned by grief and concern.
Then the leaders of the Congress (I) Party—
the “I” stands for “Indira,” the legacy of a
split in the ruling party six years ago—began
to think about the future. National elections
were due no later than Jan. 20, and the party
needed continuity. The obvious answer was
Rajiv Gandhi, a member of Parliament,
though not yet a cabinet minister.
‘Kingmakers’; Young Gandhi was ad-
dressing a party conference in West Bengal
when his mother was shot. He flew back to
Delhi, and Mrs. Gandhi’s death was an-
nounced soon after his arrival. Another offi-
cial who rushed back home was Zail Singh,
the ceremonial president, who had been
visiting Yemen. He was met at the airport
by three “kingmakers”: R. K. Dhawan,
Indira Gandhi’s senior personal aide, and
Rajiv Gandhi’s men, Arun Nehru (a distant
relative) and Vishwajeet Singh. The three
men told the president in firm tones that he
was to swear in Rajiv Gandhi as the new
prime minister. Within hours, the ritual was
performed—quickly, almost furtively.
“Nothing would hurt the soul of our
beloved Indira Gandhi more than the oc-
currence of violence in any part of the coun-
try,” the new leader said in a radio broad-
cast. “We should not let our emotions get
the better of us.” Similar sentiments were
expressed everywhere. President
Reagan, who had been awakened
twice during the night by news of
the shooting and of Mrs. Gandhi’s
death, formally presented his con-
dolences at the Indian Embassy in
Washington. British Prime Minis-
ter Margaret Thatcher, who es-
caped an attempt on her own life
not long ago, told the House of
Commons that she would miss “a
wise colleague and a close person-
al friend.” Pope John Paul, a third
survivor, said in a sermon that he
felt “weighed down at the thought
of so much human bloodshed, so
much suffering, so many tears.”
The pontiff said he was referring

dered Polish priest and other
“victims of violence” all over

In India, however, new victims
were piling up. One of the first ugly inci-
dents occurred when President Zail Singh
visited the hospital where Mrs. Gandhi had
been taken. A mob stoned his car, smashing
the windows. Strangely, there were no secu-
rity precautions. Zail Singh quickly tried to

Trampled to death: A victim at the lying-in-state


The Son Stands Alone
‘Mr. Clean ’ on the stump: An energetic campaigner against corruption
SANTOSH BASAK—GAMMA-LIAISON
Will Rajiv be tough enough to keep India in line?
He never wanted his mother’s job—but he was always a
dutiful son. The new prime minister of India lived at home, as
all good Indian men do, even after he had sought and won his
mother’s permission to marry the beautiful Italian-born stu-
dent he had met in England. If he was looking forward to
ruling India someday, lie kept it to himself. A lover of dogs,
designer jeans and Mozart, he looked like a weakling com-
pared to his younger brother, Sanjay, whom Indira Gandhi
had groomed as her successor. But she pushed Rajiv into
politics after Sanjay died in a plane crash. “Rajiv has to stand
on his own two feet,” she told one visitor. How well he does
that should shape the course of India’s history.
Rajiv Gandhi is only 40 years old, yet his life spans the whole
of India’s history as an independent nation. Mrs. Gandhi once
recalled standing outside a British jail with her newborn son,
holding him up proudly for inspection by his grandfather,
Jawaharlal Nehru. Yet his apprenticeship for his new job began
barely more than four years ago, after Sanjay died while attempt-
ing a dangerous stunt in his private plane. Sanjay was a skillful
and ruthless politician who helped engineer his mother’s return
to power in 1980. Rajiv was virtually unknown, a homebody
growing slightly plump on his wife’s pasta, a devoted father to
their two children. His background was technical —two years at
the Imperial and Scientific College in London and another two
years at Cambridge, earning a degree in mechanical engineering.
Since returning to India in the mid-’6os, he had spent virtually
his whole career as a commercial pilot for Indian Airlines —a
post whose modesty he emphasized by introducing himself to his
passengers as “Captain Rajiv” rather than the considerably
more impressive-sounding “Captain Gandhi” —and his only
known ambition was to fly more sophisticated jet planes.
Even after Sanjay’s death in 1980, it took Rajiv almost a year
to agree to run for his seat —a move that may have been
encouraged by Mrs. Gandhi in part to thwart Sanjay’s glamor-
ous and ambitious widow, Maneka. (Maneka, with the support
of some of her husband’s former friends, broke with Mrs.
Gandhi completely two years ago and
is challenging Rajiv for his parliamen-
tary seat in the upcoming elections.) His
hallmarks have been a becoming modes-
ty and a commitment to technological
solutions to India’s overwhelming prob-
lems. As a campaigner, he filled his
speeches with statistics about kilometers
of roads built and liters of drinking wa-
ter delivered. His nicknames were “Mr.
Clean” —a reference to his strenuous
campaign against the corruption endem-
ic to Indian politics—and “Computer-
ji,” for his fascination with high tech-
nology. One of the few differences he is
known to have had with his mother was
over the use of astrologers in politics;
when Mrs. Gandhi questioned when
the stars might be most propitious for the
upcoming elections, he is said to have
remarked that he thought this was
the 20th century, not “the age of the
Flintstones.”
‘lndecent Haste 5 : In all, Rajiv’s parlia-
mentary experience amounts to a little
more than three years. As one of the five
general secretaries of the Congress (I)
Party and the most trusted confidant
and adviser to his mother, he was widely
regarded as the second most powerful
politician in India. But he has not held a
ministerial portfolio. “A small coterie in
Indira Gandhi’s house selected him with indecent haste,” pro-
tested Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party. Rajiv’s inexperience still shows through at times,
as when he surprised his colleagues with an offhanded prediction
of another war with Pakistan in the near future.
The question now is whether Rajiv will be tough enough
and adroit enough to put the creaky, crony-ridden machinery of
the Congress Party in good working order. PJe has the name
that has always rallied his fractious country. And he brings to
the job his native good sense and dignity, traits that showed
in the speech he gave to his seething nation right after taking
office. “He was calm and
controlled in a high-
ly charged atmosphere,”
said an old friend, New
York University profes-
sor of political science
and author Ralph Buult-
jens. “He refused to take
political advantage by
whipping up sectarian
feelings.” Besides Indira
Gandhi’s famous name,
Rajiv will have the exam-
ple of his mother’s —and
grandfather’s —strength
and cleverness to inspire
him. Mrs. Gandhi, too,
was called inexperienced
and naive when she took
office. And like her, Ra-
jiv may prove all the
doubters wrong.

gence officials. They did not
respond to his appeal for action
against the rioters; nor did reg-
ular police units. Even a special
telephone system for ministers
and other top officials had gone
dead; it was riot manned that
day. Everyone, it seemed, was
paying court to the new prime
minister, and meanwhile the
apparatus of government was
virtually paralyzed.
Within hours, fighting had
broken out all over the country.
The next morning there was
more violence as Mrs. Gan-
dhi’s coffin was placed atop
a Soviet-made howitzer and
moved to Teen Murti House,
where her father had lived and died. People
on the street outside shouted: “Sikhs should
be destroyed!” When a few Sikhs tried to
pay their final respects to Mrs. Gandhi, they
were stoned by the crowd.
Soon a pall of smoke blanketed large
parts of New and Old Delhi. When
Newsweek’s Ray Wilkinson toured the
city in a taxi, he saw Sikh homes and busi-
nesses systematically destroyed. His report:
In one small Sikh community in southern
Delhi, at least four temples were gutted. A
Sikh named Inderjit Singh told me how a
mob of 2,000 people had attacked his two-
story yellow-brick temple and
set it afire by dousing carpets
with gasoline. “I tried to save
our holy book, but my father
and I were beaten up, kicked
and trampled by the mob,” he
said. “They burned everything.
They even looted our charity
cash box.” “We called the po-
lice,” said a neighbor, G. S.
Sethi. “We called the fire bri-
gade. No one came.” The next
day the Sikhs in the area
mounted their own guard.
At the Willingdon Hospital
in central Delhi, a spokesman
said that 51 bodies were deliv-
ered to the morgue on Thurs-
day and Friday. According to
doctors, many of the dead had
been killed by repeated jabs and
slashes from the ceremonial
swords carried by Sikhs. But
there were both Hindus and
Sikhs among the corpses in the
morgue. The hospital also
treated 622 injured people dur-
ing the first two days of rioting.
One of them, Amar Jeet Singh,
said that he and a friend had
been “dragged from my car by
a mob who began to beat us
with long sticks. As I was on
the ground, they set my car
ablaze.” The corridors and
wards of the hospital were
clogged with riot victims. At

the nearby Irwin Hospital, more than 100
people underwent emergency surgery, and
at least 12 people died. On Friday police
vans began to round up the wounded and
the dead. My visit to the hospitals suggested
that the casualty toll might be far higher
than the official figures indicated.
By late in the week the official count
stood at 500 dead in the country as a whole,
and the number was expected to rise. Horror
stories poured in from all over. In New
Delhi an angry crowd surrounded a Sikh
temple. First a sword-wield-
ing Sikh decapitated a Hin-
IB OHLSSON —Newsweek
du; then a Sikh swordsman
charged into the crowd, which
seized him and set him on fire,
according to police. In the cen-
tral state of Madhya Pradesh,
villagers reportedly stopped a
train from New Delhi, dragged
out 12 passengers—presum-
ably Sikhs —and clubbed them
to death. In Uttar Pradesh, bor-
dering the capital, another
train was said to have been
stopped, and 25 Sikhs were
lynched.
As the violence continued,
Rajiv Gandhi and 15 opposi-
tion leaders issued a joint
appeal for the restoration of
“sanity and harmony.” Their
statement insisted that “Sikhs as a whole”
were not to blame for Mrs. Gandhi’s death.
“This madness must stop,” said the political
leaders. Curfews were imposed in about 80
Indian cities, and in most of them, including
New Delhi, soldiers were ordered to shoot
rioters on sight. But the government still
was not in full control. After 50 Sikhs were
killed in an eastern suburb of the capital, the
new prime miriister tried to visit the area in
hopes of calming the mobs himself. But
even Rajiv Gandhi—the grandson of Jawa-
harlal Nehru, the son of Indira Gandhi —
couldn’t get through.
The funeral was
scheduled to begin at
noon on Saturday with
a seven-mile procession
from Teen Murti House
to the cremation
grounds on the banks
of the Yamuna River,
where the bodies of Neh-
ru and Mohandas Gan-
dhi had been burned.
Tradition called for a series of
Hindu rites, after which the
body would be placed on the
fufieral pyre, to be lit by Mrs.
Gandhi’s surviving son. After
two days Rajiv Gandhi would
return to the site to collect his
mother’s ashes in copper and
brass urns. Ultimately, the
ashes would be scattered on the
waters of rivers and lagoons all
over India.
Threat: For security reasons,
no foreign dignitaries or gov-
ernment leaders were allowed
in the funeral procession; they
would be shuttled to the crema-
tion site along various routes
through New Delhi, many of
them riding in bulletproof lim-
ousines. In Bombay another
anonymous telephone caller
warned that Sikhs would kill
sorrie of the foreign visitors.
The caller said he spoke for
the Sikh Dashmesh Regiment,
which claimed responsibility


for terrorist atrocities in northern Punjab
earlier this year. He declared that the group
would attack official mourners from the
Soviet Union, Vietnam and the Palestine
Liberation Organization, all of which, he
said, have opposed the creation of a separate
Sikh homeland called Khalistan.
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Tikhonov
and Vietnamese President Truong Chinh
were on hand for the funeral, along with
Yasir Arafat of the PLO. Among the other
foreign leaders were French President
Franqois Mitterrand, Britain’s Margaret
Thatcher, Japanese Prime Minister Yasu-
hiro Nakasone, United Nations Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar and George
Shultz at the head of the American delega-
tion. Normally, Vice President Bush would
have represented the United States. But
with the presidential election campaign
winding down to its final few days, Bush
decided that he couldn’t be spared, and
President Reagan concurred. “I think peo-
ple will understand, ” said the vice president.
U.S. officials hoped that Shultz would
have an opportunity in New Delhi to dis-
cuss arms control with Soviet officials, but
the omens weren’t good for any kind of
polite conversation. The official Soviet
press repeatedly dropped heavy-handed
hints that the CIA had been involved in the
assassination. Although the Soviet govern-
ment made no direct accusations, Pravda,
the Communist Party newspaper, charged
that “large-scale CIA activities” had been
mounted in support of Sikh separatists. For
weeks the Soviet press had been accusing
Washington of waging “state terrorism.”
Last week Tass, the Soviet news service,
reported from India that demonstrators
outside the U.S. Consulate in the southern
city of Madras “blamed the Central Intelli-
gence Agency of the U.S. A. and its agents
The Sikhs’ Blood Feud
Bhindranwale (center) at the Golden Temple last June: More bloodshed
DIETER LUDWIG—SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
In the west London suburb of Southall, old men in turbans
and flowing beards passed out sweets; others set off fireworks and
shouted “Khalistan Zindabad!” (“Long Live Khalistan,” the
dreamed-for independent Sikh state). In New York, Sikhs drank
champagne and danced outside the Indian Consulate, chanting
“Hindu dogs—no more” and “Who’s next? Rajiv Gandhi!” But
even as the most reckless among the Sikhs were cheering the
assassins, moderates deplored Indira Gandhi’s murder and
braced for further retributions. “You cannot meet violence with
violence,” said Pritam Singh, a prominent Sikh in Hong Kong.
“It is a slur on India and the Sikhs.”
The diverse reactions mirrored deep divisions in the Sikh
community—and paradoxes within the religion itself. Founded
by a 15th-century mystic, Nanak, as a monotheistic blend of
Hinduism and Islam, Sikhism emphasizes morality and good
deeds —but centuries of perceived persecution have suffused the
sect with a martial creed of fierce self-protectionism. Male
members wear turbans, never cut their hair, adopt the name
Singh—for “lion” —and carry ceremonial daggers to symbolize
their readiness for combat. The sect has long agitated for greater
autonomy, and India’s economic realities only stoked their
frustrations. A hard-working and prosperous elite, the Sikhs
account for only 2 percent of India’s population —but make up a
disproportionate number of its business and military leaders,
including roughly 30 percent of its Army officers. Centered in the
Punjab, India’s breadbasket, they also provide much of India’s
food supply —and have long felt that they gave India
more than India returned.
The Sikhs’ blood feud with Mrs. Gandhi began in
earnest when the Sikh political party Akali Dal began
pressing for reforms. Militant Sikhs, led by Jarnail
Singh Bhindranwale, the “Sikh Khomeini,” went
further —waging a terrorist campaign based at the
Sikhs’ Golden Temple and bent on making Punjab a
separate Sikh state. Moderates hardly expected India
to yield the prosperous Punjab. But some accused the
government of covertly backing Bhindranwale in
hopes of dividing the sect, then standing idle while his
terrorist raids grew intolerable. Government leaders,
in turn, faulted Sikh moderates for letting Bhindran-
wale turn the Golden Temple into an armed camp.
Whoever was to blame, the siege of the Sikh holy
shrine left at least 600 —and perhaps as many as
1,200 —Sikhs and Army soldiers dead —and united
moderate and militant Sikhs in anger. “You cannot
begin to understand our reactions unless you think in
terms of the Vatican being besieged and overrun by
storm troopers,” one Sikh told Newsweek.
What comes next for the Sikhs will depend largely
on whether Rajiv Gandhi opens negotiations with the sect and
moves to quell the violence by vengeance-seeking Hindus. “It
must be made clear that the Sikh community as a whole is not
being held responsible,” said one Hindu leader. But the fact that
Mrs. Gandhi’s assassins came from her trusted guards has
brought all Sikhs under suspicion. Indian officials “must be
asking themselves now who the loyal officers in the Army are,”
said one old U.S. India hand. “If they start cleaning out the ones
they think aren’t loyal, they could cause resentment among the
ones who are.” The raid on the Golden Temple has also left the
Sikhs effectively leaderless. Bhindranwale died in the assault,
other militants remain jailed, and the five high priests at the
Golden Temple are seen as too weak to cope with the sect’s
political problems. Besieged by calls for help from frightened sect
members, Indian President Zail Singh, himself a Sikh, began
telling callers lamely, “Why don’t you leave your home? That
way, if they set fire to it, at least you won’t be there.”
Tlell’: Some Sikhs held out hope that the assassination would at
last focus attention on the need for a peaceful settlement. But
others predicted only a vicious circle, with violence against
Sikhs turning more sect members militant —and that, in turn,
strengthening the hand of Hindu extremists bent on retribution.
“The Sikhs have never known what it is like to be a minority—
now they will,” said one United Nations observer. “The worst is
yet to come,” said another worried diplomat. “It will be similar
to the times of partition,” when an estimated 1 million died in
sectarian bloodshed. The Sikh Holy Book offered little consola-
tion. It warns: “The fires of hell still lie ahead —and I am afraid.”

in India for Indira Gandhi’s death.”
Washington officially protested Mos-
cow’s “absurd and irresponsible” allega-
tions. Administration analysts suspected
that the Soviets were concerned about pre-
serving their own special relationship with
India after the death of Mrs. Gandhi, who
had played a major role in cementing the
ties. American officials also suggested that
the Soviets were trying to divert attention
“from their own military operations in
Afghanistan.
In India, however, geopolitics were of
little interest at the moment. Domestic con-
cerns loomed far larger, including the ques-
tion of how well and how quickly Rajiv
Gandhi would establish his new regime. In
his first few days the signs were mixed.
Understandably, the new prime minister
benefited from a vast outpouring of sympa-
thy. The opposition parties could hardly
afford to attack him now, and in any case,
no single challenger to his rule had yet
emerged from the ranks of the other parties.
Diplomatic observers believed that if Gan-
dhi called an election soon, he would win it
handily, probably securing more seats in
Parliament than his mother would have
won, had she lived.
Sparks: The longer-term outlook may be
less sanguine for Gandhi. Despite four years
of intensive grooming for the succession, he
lacks his mother’s experience, her decisive-
ness and her charisma. The new prime min-
ister may have trouble holding his party
together. His own supporters and those of
his late brother, Sanjay, already seem to be
striking sparks off the older Congress wal-
lahs who owed their loyalty to Mrs. Gandhi.
The abrupt manner in which Rajiv took
over the government may have alienated
some of the politicians and administrators
whose support he needs most. “I wouldn’t
be too happy if I were in P. V. Narasimha
Rao’s shoes,” said an opposition source,
referring to Mrs. Gandhi’s minister of home
affairs. “Under the precedents established
in the ‘6os, he should by rights have become
an interim premier.”
Most of all, the new prime minister will be
criticized, eventually, for the way in which
he handled his first crisis. When the rioting
began, his government did far too little to
head off trouble where it hadn’t yet begun or
to restore order where it had already broken
down. “Delhi is burning, and there is no
administration,” complained one opposi-
tion leader, socialist George Fernandes. No
prime minister, not even Indira Gandhi in
her prime, could have stifled the fury that
swept India last week. But her son’s slow,
uncertain response to the communal blood
bath was not encouraging. The cycle of
senseless violence that took Mrs. Gandhi’s
life was likely to claim more victims —and
to settle nothing.
RUSSELL WATSON with FRANK GIBNEY Jr.,
EDWARD BEHR, RAY WILKINSON and SUDIP
MAZUMDAR in New Delhi and bureau reports
Is India Governable?
A prime minister reviews her troops: The Sikh uprising may threaten the Army’s unity
A bereaved nation now faces a severe time of testing.
Economist John Kenneth Galbraith, the
U.S. ambassador to India during the
Kennedy administration, once described
the world’s largest democracy as “a func-
tioning anarchy.” Now, with the assassina-
tion of Indira Gandhi, the problem is
whether India will continue to function at
all. Formost ofits 37 years of independence,
the nation has- been held together by the
strong leadership of the Nehru family—and
even the powerful Mrs. Gandhi was forced
to resort briefly to what amounted to mar-
tial law. What she has bequeathed to her
inexperienced son Rajiv is a country whose
political institutions have eroded while re-
gional and ethnic tensions are growing dan-
gerously strong. “There’s a real question
whether India can be governed effectively in
a democratic system,” says Amos Jordan,
president of Georgetown University’s
Center for Strategic and International Stud-
ies. “The coalitions which brought inde-
pendence to India have dissolved.”
Indian democracy has survived political
crises before; Indians are fiercely proud of
their political institutions, and even serious
local disruptions seem remote in other areas
of so vast a subcontinent. In addition, the
entrenched Indian bureaucracy can be
counted upon to continue functioning even
in a power vacuum. Traditionally the coun-
try has managed to contain its internal divi-
sions through a strong central political ap-
paratus or a charismatic leader. If Rajiv
establishes himself in his mother’s and
grandfather’s role, the threat of disintegra-
tion will diminish.
What’s clear is that Rajiv will have to
learn his job in record time. Relations be-
tween India and Pakistan have soured bad-
ly, and there’s a danger that India, the
stronger power, might be tempted to take a
swipe at its archrival. Meanwhile, India
faces the most poisonous domestic situation
since the British withdrawal in 1947. Ethnic
hatred is not confined to the Punjab; it exists
in pockets from Assam in the northeast to
the southern tip of the subcontinent. Fol-
lowing repeated episodes of sectarian vio-
lence, tensions between Hindus and Mus-
lims are at their highest level in 20 years,
Gandhi’s ruling Congress Party “used to
be a splendid institution,” says one Ameri-
can analyst. “But it was important to Indira
not to have any challenge from within the
party. People no longer rose to responsibil-
ity through skill; they rose to responsibility
by toadying up to her.” Meanwhile, the
political opposition remains weak and di-
vided. “The top leaders were competent and
effective men in their prime,” says Paul
Brass ofthe University of Washington, “but
now they are old.” As for Rajiv himself,
most observers are not impressed. Mr. Ra-
jiv Gandhi by himself is no one, says Bha-
bani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy
Research in New Delhi. “He is a symbol.”
Enemies: There was no early indication
what the assassination would mean for
India’s relations with the United States,
Despite Indira’s official policy of nonalign-
ment, she tilted toward the Soviet Union,
The reasons were plain. The United States
had been supplying arms to Pakistan since


1954, and perceiving itself surrounded by
enemies, India turned to the Soviets for
help. Soviet support, particularly arms aid,
helped her to capitalize on the opportunity
of the Bangladesh uprising to dismember
Pakistan and make India the dominant
power on the subcontinent. There was a
brief thaw after Gandhi visited Washington
in 1982, but she was soon again making eyes
at the Soviets. During a six-day visit to India
last March, Soviet Defense Minister
Dmitry Ustinov agreed to supply New Del-
hi with a new generation of weapons, in-
cluding, U.S. officials believe, the new
MiG-29 jet fighter and the T-72 tank.
Vegetable harvest: A bumper crop raises new economic problems
SVEN SIMON—KATHERINE YOUNG
Still, the Reagan administration remains
eager to improve its ties with India. After a
thorough policy review, Washington decid-
ed to search for ways to reassure the Indians
that its military aid to Pakistan was not
getting out of hand and that, in the words of
one official, “no one except the Soviets
stands to gain much if the Indians and the
Paks go at each other again.” How Rajiv
would regard the American initiative re-
mained unclear, but U.S. officials hoped
that they could win points by working to
reduce the border tensions. Pakistan itself
seemed eager to oblige: immediately after
the assassination, Zia praised Mrs. Gan-
dhi’s “valuable contributions to the nor-
malization of relations” and ordered three
days of official mourning.
Bomb: For the moment, Washington is
convinced that the possibility of actual
warfare remains remote. Nonetheless, it
watched with increasing nervousness as
India and Pakistan broke off talks on a
nonaggression treaty, clashed in disputed
territory in Kashmir and exchanged re-
criminations over the hijacking of an Indian
jet by Sikh militants last August. Of particu-
lar concern are the reports that Pakistan is
“on the verge” of developing a nucle-
ar bomb. In September Ronald Reagan
warned Pakistani President Mohammad
Zia ul-Haq that Washington’s five-year,
$3.2 billion aid package might be jeopard-
ized by Pakistan’s continuing nuclear pro-
gram. Nonetheless, on a visit to Washing-
ton last month, the Pakistani foreign
minister warned that his nation would re-
taliate if India tried an Israeli-style attack
on its uranium-enrichment plant at Ka-
huta, near Islamabad. Some American ex-
perts believe Rajiv will resist the temptation
to stir up further trouble with Pakistan. He
is preoccupied with domestic problems,
and, with Sikhs making up 20 percent of the
Indian fighting force, he may not be able to
count on the Army’s cohesiveness. Still, the
fear remains that Rajiv might eventually
undertake a foreign adventure to consoli-
date his shaky political base.
Rajiv’s leadership will be sorely tested in
the months before the national elections
scheduled for January.
Before Mrs. Gandhi’s
death, the Congress Par-
ty seemed headed for a
major setback; now ana-
lysts expect a wave of
sympathy to pull the
party out of its dive. It
remains to be seen, how-
ever, what kind of a par-
ty will emerge. “The
Congress Party of Neh-
ru is not the Congress
Party that Indira Gan-
dhi has bequeathed to
her son,” says Jordan of
Georgetown.
The one positive thing
that Rajiv can point to is
a relatively robust Indi-
an economy. It is expected to grow by more
than 7 percent this year, thanks in part to a
benevolent monsoon which is expected to
increase grain production by 17 percent to
150 million metric tons. But “even India’s
economic successes have been a mixed
blessing,” says one U.S. diplomat. “With
the rich getting richer, some of the poor are
not as patient as they used to be.”
The major challenge for Rajiv will be to
restore the old coalitions by wooing dissi-
dent politicians and attracting new blood.
Analysts in the United States are skeptical,
however, that Rajiv will be able to declare
his independence from his mother’s cronies.
“What will really happen,” says an Ameri-
can analyst, “is that he will be surrounded
by a cabal of people who will try to get his
ear, or act as if his ear didn’t matter and
simply make decisions around him.”
‘Trouble’: The danger is that such an iso-
lated government will be unable to contain
the centrifugal forces that have always
plagued India, a land of 16 official languages
and six major religions. “It was the attempt
to impose uniform central control over a
country so vast and diverse that led Indira
into so much trouble,” says Selig Harrison
of the Carnegie Endowment for Interna-
tional Peace. Ethnic and regional differ-
ences cannot be suppressed; the only solu-
tion is to give them a greater outlet. “When
you look at people not as statistics but as
human beings, you find that they are at-
tached to their languages, their local cus-
toms and traditions,” Mrs. Gandhi once
told Newsweek. “We feel that if a person’s
local pride is satisfied, he is more likely to be
a good citizen and accept the larger unity.”
That unity might come from a more effec-
tive opposition, or perhaps Rajiv can prove
himself to be an effective national leader.
Whatever the case, the Indian government
is nowhere near collapse. “The struggle
continues to be a democratic one,” insists
Sen Gupta. “It is waged by street demon-
strations and elections rather than revolu-
tion.” Still there is little hope that the ani-
mosities between the Sikhs and Hindus will
soon die down: according to one Indian
analyst, “Much hatred will have to be vent-
ed and much blood shed.” And as tensions
continue to rise among other ethic minor-
ities, the long-term danger is that the demo-
cratic center may not be able to hold. The
one thing that is certain is that India faces a
time of testing as daunting as any it has
confronted since the days of the British Raj.

Type 2400
In Defence of The Nation
VSEL Type 2400 will be in the water in 1987
when Australia is expected to award its own build
contract for RAN submarines.
VSEL Type 2400 is backed by a $585 million per
annum defence research programme allocated to
sea equipment in the U.K. defence estimates.
The Royal Navy has announced its willingness to
change the design of its own later Type 2400
submarines to match Australian requirements.
VSEL is developing one of the largest "greenfield"
warship sites in the world on a 24-acre site at
Barrow U.K. at a cost of $336 million.
The "greenfield" facility incorporates modern
production technology and build strategies and
will be on-stream in mid 1986 for the Trident build
programme.
This "greenfield" design technology experience is
available to Australia for its submarine/1
warship programme.

Ethiopia’s Starving Millions
Refugees in Korem, Ethiopia: A film shot by the BBC jolted people into realizing that millions of Africans are starving to death
After two years of famine in Africa, the West finally launches a relief effort.
It is known as triage, the grim act of
determining who can be helped and who
is too sick to save. A doctor at the relief
camp at Korem in northern Ethiopia wends
his way slowly among the masses of emaci-
ated people huddled together on the stony
ground. Suddenly he stops and, using a
marker pen, draws a cross on a young man’s
forehead; the cross signals that he is consid-
ered strong enough to have a reasonable
chance of overcoming starvation and ill-
ness. The man is taken aside and given a
share of the scarce supplies of food, clothing
and medicine. The doctor moves on. Thou-
sands of other refugees, their foreheads un-
marked, will be left to die.
The immensity of Ethiopia’s disaster has
forced relief workers to make such painful

decisions. But Ethiopia is not the only Afri-
can nation whose people are suffering,
starving and dying. A relentless drought is
withering food supplies throughout the
continent. For two years African officials
have tried to call attention to the crisis. In
much of the Western world, however, poli-
ticians and media executives have seemed to
brush it off as just another sad story from a
hopeless continent. Recently, if rather be-
latedly, the American government did
launch a generous emergency-aid effort.
But public opinion still was not galvanized
until the British Broadcasting Corporation
recently televised footage of the starving
Ethiopian refugees. A few actually died on
camera. That, more than anything, seemed
to jolt the public to the realization that
millions of people are starving to death.
The BBC film has been telecast around
the world in recent weeks, and as a result
relief organizations have been deluged with
money and donations of food. The aid effort
remains focused on relief for Ethiopia,
where U.S. officials estimate that more than
1 million people could die in coming
months. There is still very little public un-
derstanding of the extent of the famine in
such equally hard-hit countries as Mozam


bique and Chad. The continentwide crisis is
the worst since the Sahel famine of 1973-74
that left more than 300,000 people dead. In
the words of Edouard Saouma, director of
the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), “A nightmare has be-
gun for millions of Africans.”
The initial reluctance of Western govern-
ments to help Ethiopia had its political
reasons. The Addis Ababa regime is a
staunch ally of the Soviet Union and its
satraps; there are at least 3,000 Cubans and
numerous Soviet and East German advisers
in the country. For a time, Washington
argued that it was Moscow’s responsibility
to help its client. In 1983 the Reagan admin-
istration temporarily cut off all food aid to
Ethiopia. The Soviets, meanwhile, supplied
$3 billion to $5 billion in arms —and only
10,000 tons of rice. The Ethiopian regime
could be faulted for insensitivity. Two
months ago the government staged a cele-
bration of its 10th anniversary in power.
The party cost $250 million.
American congressmen and aid officials
continued to send grim reports to Washing-
ton —and, eventually, the administration
responded. “Our policy,” says M. Peter
McPherson, administrator of the Agency
for International Development, “has been
not to give economic assistance to our en-
emies, but to give food to starving people.”
Last month Washington authorized the de-
livery of $45 million in food aid, making the
United States the most generous of all for-
eign-relief donors to Ethiopia. And
last week American officials met
with Dawit Walde-Giorgis, head of
Ethiopia’s Relief and Rehabilita-
tion Commission, to discuss the re-
lief effort. After the talk, Washing-
ton boosted the aid yet again by $6.2
million, agreed to loan Ethiopia two
L-100 cargo planes for two months
to help deliver the food and prom-
ised to help the Ethiopians expand
their port facilities.
Donations: But it was the BBC
film that caused an extraordinary
outpouring of donations from citi-
zens in the United States and in
Europe. Officials at the Boston
headquarters of Oxfam, a British
agency, said last week that it was
receiving an “incredible” $30,000
to $60,000 a day—all of it from
average American citizens. A 90-
year-old woman living on social se-
curity sent in a $5 check. Someone
else delivered a bag full of pen-
nies. Children contributed their
allowance money. In Britain a farm-
er in Cambridgeshire began a cam-
paign to collect grain. Before he
knew it, he had collected $300,000
worth of donations.
Despite the sudden concern
around the world, the help is too late
for thousands of victims. “It was too
late for many six months ago,” said
one Oxfam official, “too late for
Ethiopian child: ‘A nightmare has begun ’
UNICEF
others today and too late for many tomor-
row.” The main problem is to get the food to
the hungry. Ethiopia’s small ports are al-
ready clogged. The Ethiopian relief com-
mission has only 200 trucks, and nearly one-
third are crippled by a lack of spare parts. At
The faces of hunger: Hundreds are dying every day
MOHAMED AMIN-CAMERAPIX-HUTCHINSON LIBRARY
least 100,000 tons of food are now sitting in
the ports waiting to be picked up. Even if a
massive airlift can be arranged, it will be
difficult to distribute the supplies inside the
country. Only about one in seven drought
victims is easily accessible. Many live in
mountain villages that cannot be reached
even by four-wheel-drive vehicles.
The northwest corner of Ethiopia is the
area of most intense suffering. In those
stricken remote territories it takes people
days or even weeks to walk from their
homes to refugee camps. Some die on the
trip, while others make it to the camps only
to die there. In the Alomata refugee camp in
Welo province, relief workers have supplies
for 3,000 people. There are 100,000 people
there. They are dying at a rate of 100 a day.
Bodies are collected and then laid out each
morning to be counted, washed and buried.
Starvation: Kenyan doctor George Nga-
tire is one of the doctors at the camp. Re-
cently, he stood in the midst of a group of
mothers carrying children suffering from
pneumonia, scabies and outright starva-
tion. “I’m sorry, there is nothing I can do, ”
he told them. “I know your children need
treatment, but I have nothing to treat them
with. Come back in five days.”
Throughout the northern territories,
such scenes occur again and again. In the
town of Makele, a British team feeds 500
children a day but turns away another 300.
BBC cameraman Mohamed Amin filmed
some scenes there and reported: “I watched
a dying man being given a last drop
of water before he closed his eyes to
wake no more.” Along many of the
roads, people wait patiently for any
handout from people in passing ve-
hicles. More often than not, they die
where they sit. Some of the starving
arrive in towns only to be rounded
up and trucked back to the country-
side. Government officials say they
are trying to prevent the cities from
becoming overcrowded.
The food crisis is clearly aggra-
vated by widespread guerrilla war-
fare in the Ethiopian provinces of
Eritrea and Tigre. The central gov-
ernment contends that there is only
a minor problem with the “bandits”
in these provinces, but in fact the
rebels control much of the country-
side, where as many as 3 million
people live. Food-relief convoys en-
tering rebel areas must be heavily
guarded. As a result, most of the
people living in the rebel territories
have only recently begun to receive
any food aid at all. “What kind of
relief effort can be mounted in a
province run by secessionists that
the government is trying to isolate?”
asks Jay Levy of the Washington
office of the FAO.

fering, Brtain, Germany, Italy, Ja-

In the rear part of its main deck the

six large pallets quite easily. This
doubles the cargo capacity compared
with the standard Jumbo to a maxi-
mum of 34 tons.
But it wasn’t the B-747-357 Combi
which made air cargo one of
Swissair’s big strengths.
It was the fact that Swissair doesn’t
just carry cargo as a sideline, but
devotes a quite unusual amount of lov-
ing care to it. It gets packaged, protect-
ed, wrapped and secured with such
painstaking attention in properly air-
conditioned cargo holds that nothing
can happen even to the most sensitive

And we also recognized in good
time that the most important things in
the transport of air cargo often take
place not in the air but on the ground.

No wonder Swissair employs

food aid to Africa. The European Common
Market, which has already sent about $35
million in aid to Ethiopia, has pledged an
additional $24 million both for Ethiopia
and for its drought-stricken neighbors. But
despite such efforts, Western officials are
now facing criticism for their initially hesi-
tant reaction to the crisis. Edgard Pisani,
the European Common Market’s Commis-
sioner for Aid and Development, last week
was forced to defend the EEC against a
barrage of charges of callousness and ineffi-
ciency. He said that he had been trying for
years to awaken member nations to the need
for providing long-term development aid —
not just quick fixes for Africa’s food prob-
lems. Pisani was even a bit sarcastic about
the British government’s recent interest in
the plight of the Ethiopians. Britain, he said,
now seems to be “sensitive” about sending
food to Ethiopia. But he also took note of
the fact that Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher has “been constantly asking for
reductions in food aid with the almost insuf-
ferable slogan of ‘trade not aid’. ”
Threat: In the United States, Democrats
were annoyed that the Reagan administra-
tion, which has pushed for reductions in
Third World food aid, now seemed to be
gaining a reputation for generosity because
of its emergency-relief effort. The speaker
of the House, Thomas P. (Tip) O’Neill
pointed out that the White House had
threatened to block increased economic
aid for Africa unless Congress also
voted to continue financial support for the
Nicaraguan rebels. “This administration
has shown that it is ready to starve Afri-
cans so that it can kill Latin Americans,”
O’Neill said.
While Western leaders try to pin the
blame on one another, the situation across
the continent continues to deteriorate. At
least 25 African nations are experiencing
severe food shortages, and 150 million Afri-
cans are said to be starving or suffering from
diseases related to the famine.
Western governments are stepping up
their aid to the other suffering African
countries. Last week the Reagan adminis-
tration announced that it would ship a total
of $45 million in emergency food supplies to
Kenya, Mozambique and Mali. But as past
crises have shown, the developed countries
have short attention spans and a limited
interest in the fate of Third World people.
For now, dollars, pounds, Deutsche marks
and other currencies are flowing into the
Ethiopian relief effort at an unprecedented
rate. But the odds remain high that other
crises will erupt, other concerns will preoc-
cupy the governments of the developed na-
tions—and Africa’s suffering will be ig-
nored, and the flood of aid will slow to the
usual trickle. Meanwhile millions of Afri-
cans will continue to die.

A General Fights Back
Philippine generals know where their
loyalties lie—and how their bread gets
buttered. Early last week the names of 68
generals appeared in a newspaper advertise-
ment that pledged “unwavering loyalty and
support” to Gen. Fabian C. Ver, the armed
forces chief of staff. Ver had taken a leave of
absence to prove his innocence after being
declared indictable in the murder of opposi-
tion leader Benigno Aquino. But many gen-
erals owe their posts and purses to General
Ver. “We are morally convinced,” the ad
said, “that [Ver] is innocent of the dastardly
crime attributed to him.” Only 15 generals
did not sign the “manifesto.” One was Lt.
Gen. Fidel Ramos, Ver’s longtime rival
and his temporary successor as chief of staff.
Ver, Ramos: A stained commander, a tough reformer
ANDY HERNANDEZ—GAMMA-LIAISON
Questions quickly arose over the authen-
ticity of some signatures, but the ad suggest-
ed that Ver and his clique still hold consider-
able power. When 1,500 protesters marched
into Manila’s financial district demanding
that Ver be tried in a “people’s court,”
troops were sent in to disperse them with
tear gas, water cannons and rifle fire. Such
demonstrations posed little threat to the
government of President Ferdinand Mar-
cos. But the restoration of stability in the
Philippines did seem to depend in part on
cleaning up the ill-disciplined and unpopu-
lar armed forces. The fact that many of the
old guard remained in power may not bode
well for that effort.
A wild card was thrown into the game
last week when a progovernment newspa-
per, Bulletin Today, revealed the existence
of El Diablo, a 30,000-man secret society
within the military. The newspaper de-
scribed a vigilante-style “El Diablo crime-
busters association,” whose members are
identified by tattoos on the hand or shoul-
der. Bulletin Today reported that the myste-
rious group “could possibly supplant the
command set-up” in the armed forces.
Little was known about El Diablo’s po-
litical leanings, if it had any. The group
registered with Philippine authorities last
March, saying that it aimed to “foster the
spirit of unity, brotherhood ... and disci-
pline” in the armed forces. Its members may
simply be military reformers intent on
cleaning up a service rife with cliquishness
and corruption. Earlier this year human-
rights activists on the island of Mindanao,
where the government is fighting commu-
nist guerrillas, spoke of “Diablo vigilantes”
who were punishing “abusive”
military men. One Malacanang
Palace source says the story about
El Diablo apparently was leaked
by the Ver camp in an attempt to
discredit reform-minded soldiers
identified with Ramos.
There is no sign that Ver has
relinquished his key post as head
of the National Intelligence and
Security Authority. Many Ver
loyalists continue to hold other
important commands. Ramos and
Defense Minister Juan Ponce En-
rile had been trying, unsuccessful-
ly, to loosen Ver’s grip. News-
week has learned that both men
offered Marcos their resignations
last July, but the president refused
to accept the gesture.
Evidence: It isn’t clear yet that
Ver will ever face an impartial trial
for his alleged role in the killing of
Aquino. Last week an official om-
budsman was studying the evi-
dence against Ver and 24 other
military men compiled by the in-
vestigative Agrava commission.
Ver could be ordered to stand trial in a civil
court, but it is possible that the case will go
no further than the ombudsman. One gov-
ernment official predicts that Ver will be
acquitted and returned to his post for a few
months, just long enough to save his face.
Then, this source says, the general may be
retired and sent overseas as an ambassador.
The United States has been urging Mar-
cos to clean up the military, and the pressure
intensified after the report by the Agrava
commission. Some Reagan administration
officials believe that time is running out for
the Marcos government. Marcos recently
lashed out at his critics in Washington,
insisting that he will not be “the pet dog of
any Western ally.” But how Marcos handles
the military—and the rest of the Aquino
case —could be critical to the chances for
long-term stability in the Philippines.

EUROPE
The Making of a Martyr
A special squad of police divers searching for the body: A flurry of speculation over who might have been behind the murder
Poland’s crusading priest becomes as formidable in death as he was in life.
All week long the mourners gathered
outside St. Stanislaw Kostka Church
in Warsaw. The Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko,
who once preached fiery anticommunist
sermons from the church’s pulpit, was
gone—murdered by Polish security
officers. A bed of flickering candles
illuminated the sidewalk around the
church as parishioners tacked up po-
ems of homage. Inside, a large por-
trait of the slain priest hung next to
the altar, while four steelworkers
stood guard nearby. The new martyr
was to be buried on the grounds of
the church that he had made into a
symbol of opposition to Communist
rule. And as tens of thousands of
Poles paid their last respects, Father
Popieluszko became as formidable
in death as he had been in life.
Three Polish security officers
were charged with the priest’s kid-
napping and murder. But signs
of a wider —and higher—conspiracy
emerged late last week. The govern-
ment arrested a colonel and a lieu-
tenant colonel in the Internal Affairs
Ministry in connection with the kill-
ing, and suspended one of its gener-
als. The official news agency PAP
reported tersely that the action
against Brig. Gen. Zenon Platek was
taken “for lack of sufficient supervi-
sion” of his department’s operations.
The simplest theory was that a small
group of communist hard-liners in the se-
curity forces decided to eliminate Popie-
luszko. A more far-reaching possibility
was that the murder had been aimed at
Popieluszko: Fiery sermons from the pulpit
BOLESLAW WINCZEWSKI—GAMMA-LIAISON
ultimately ousting Polish leader Gen. Woj-
ciech Jaruzelski. Some Solidarity support-
ers believed that Jaruzelski himself was
behind the murder. And then there was the
most sinister theory: that unidentified So-
viet KGB agents had engineered the
plot to bring Jaruzelski down.
Warsaw’s official line suggested
that a faction within the government
was trying to weaken Jaruzelski and
his interior minister, Gen. Czes-
law Kiszczak. Before Popieluszko’s
death had been confirmed, General
Kiszczak said that Capt. Grzegorz
Piotrowski had admitted to murder-
ing the priest. But the accused man
later recanted his testimony. The
other two original suspects, identi-
fied as Lt. Waldemar Chmielewski
and Lt. Leszek Pekala, testified that
they were only acting on orders.
Parallels: The question was
whether the line of command could
be traced to Moscow. Popieluszko’s
murder came at the same time that
Italian officials were releasing de-
tails of the assassination plot against
Pope John Paul 11. The coincidence
of timing suggested parallels be-
tween the two apparent conspiracies.
“It is exactly like the pope plot,”
said one Western diplomat with long
experience in Poland. “You have a
charismatic figure who is a symbol


Mourners gather at St. Stanislaw Church: A controversy that challenges Jaruzelski
AP
for the nation. By eliminating him, you are
demonstrating that totalitarianism is more
powerful than the nation.”
The comparison was highly speculative.
But Italian Judge Ilario Martella’s recent
findings in his investigation of the 1981
papal shooting, if proven accurate, did
make KGB involvement in the plot against
the pope look plausible. The Polish secret
police, like its Bulgarian counterpart, al-
most certainly contains KGB agents. If the
Kremlin decided to back a plot against a
Polish dissident such as Popieluszko —
whether because of dissatisfaction with
Jaruzelski, or simply to remove a key op-
position figure—it could use its remote
KGB operatives to put such a plot into
motion. Some analysts, however, said that
the theory of a Kremlin connection was
taken a step too far. The only certainty was
that Popieluszko, 37, was very unpopular
in Moscow. In September, the Soviet news-
paper Izvestia wrote that the Polish priest
had “turned his apartment into a ware-
house of illegal literature, and he closely
cooperates with inveterate counterrevolu-
tionaries.” Late last month Popieluszko
was kidnapped on a wooded road north-
west of Warsaw. Eleven days later, police
divers found his body in the icy Wloclawek
reservoir, 45 miles down the Vistula River.
Communist officials expelled the accused
security officers from the party. They al-
lowed a church-approved lawyer and a
court doctor to take part in an autopsy,
though they have not yet disclosed the re-
sults. And they made no objection when
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, Poland’s Roman
Catholic primate, announced the public fu-
neral and burial at St. Stanislaw Church.
Reconciliation: Former Solidarity spokes-
man Andrzej Gwiazda called for a one-hour
strike in Gdansk during the funeral. But
Lech Walesa urged his supporters not to
take part in any protest demonstrations. He
called for the resumption of talks between
the opposition and the government, and
offered to step down as Solidarity leader if
that would help such talks. “This death
must become a building material of social
peace,” he said. “Let the silence of mourn-
ing reign in the whole of Poland, but also the
silence of hope.”
The timing of Popieluszko’s death was
awkward for Jaruzelski. It came just as the
West seemed inclined to restore a sem-
blance of normal relations with Poland. But
most Western officials appeared willing to
give Jaruzelski the benefit of the doubt.
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Die-
trich Genscher said that he intended to
carry out his plans for an official visit to
Poland later this month. President Reagan
issued a personal statement calling Popie-
luszko “a champion of Christian values and
a courageous spokesman for the cause of
liberty.” U.S. officials said they had no rea-
son to disbelieve Jaruzelski’s declaration of
innocence. But there was a heavy burden on
him all the same. At the very least, the blood
of the martyr demanded that those who
committed the murder —and whoever was
behind it—shouldn’t get off scot-free.
CRAIG CANINE with DEBBIE SEWARD
in Warsaw and bureau reports
Stalin’s Prodigal Daughter
She was Joseph Stalin’s child, but in 1967 she startled the
world by defecting to the West. She burned her Soviet passport,
married an American and settled down to a bourgeois life in the
United States. Outraged, the Kremlin stripped Svetlana Alli-
luyeva of her Soviet citizenship and denounced her as
a “traitress to the homeland.” But last month Svet-
lana, 58, quietly withdrew her American-born daugh-
ter, Olga Peters, 13, from the private school she
attended in England. Then she defected again—back
to the Soviet Union. In a terse statement, the Soviet
news agency Tass confirmed the return of Stalin’s
prodigal daughter, and said that Moscow “had con-
sidered and complied with” her request that both she
and Olga be granted Soviet citizenship.
Apparently, Svetlana had suffered from acute
homesickness. She recently had a long series of tele-
phone conversations with relatives in Moscow, in-
cluding her children from marriages that ended be-
fore her first getaway. “She said she was disappointed
Svetlana: Homesick
AP
in the West and that she missed her children,” said a Muscovite
who is acquainted with some of Svetlana’s relatives. For a while
she had appeared to embrace the American way of life. She had
celebrity status. Her book “Twenty Letters to a Friend” —
containing revelations about life with her tyrant father —was a
critical and financial success. But her marriage to William
Wesley Peters, an architect, broke up and she moved to Britain in
1982. In an article published there this year, she said
she could no longer see any real difference between
the Soviet and American political systems.
The Kremlin was not likely to pass up the propa-
ganda windfall of Svetlana’s return —or to avoid
exacting a price for overlooking her past transgres-
sions. Sometime soon she will probably appear at a
carefully scripted press conference in Moscow, or on
Soviet television. It is even possible that she will say
that her 18 years in the West were a mistake —
perhaps forced upon her somehow by the CIA —and
she will rejoice in her return to Mother Russia. Then,
perhaps, Stalin’s daughter will be left to search for the
peace of mind that apparently has eluded her
throughout her life.


SOMETIMES A
PERSONAL COMPU
SOMETIMES A
Presenting the NCR Tower.
This year, a lot of businesses will go out and buy
personal computers only to discover thousands of dollars
later that they need something more to hand e their
problems. Something more powerful. More
expandable. More economical.
That something is the NCR Tower. -
When Personal Computers
Aren’t Powerful Enough.
Compare the Tower with a personal computer
like the IBM XT and you’ll find there’s no
comparison.
The Tower processes information at
twice the speed. It comes with over four times
the storage capacity. It can stand alone or as part of a large
distributed data processing network. It runs all the different
types of software that personal computers do. And a whole
lot more. They can help you control inventory better.
Run a data processing department better.
Even manage a nationwide network of hospitals or auto
parts stores better.
In short, whether you run a small business, a
department of a large business or a nationwide network
of businesses, the Tower will help you do business
better. Why does the Tower perform so well?
Because it's built so well.
It is powered by the Motorola 68000, one of
the most powerful 16-bit micro-processors around.
It comes with other guarantees of high performance
like a Winchester hard disc and the Intel Multibus*
And it offers you the UNIX* operating system.
So it’s simple enough for general
' managers (just plug it in and go) or
sophisticated enough for systems
analysts (you can do your own thing).
When Personal Computers
Aren’t Expandable Enough.
Any small business computer will grow as you grow.
The question is, how far? The Tower’s storage
capacity expands from 40 million characters to 214 million.
Translated, that means it will hold anywhere from 13,000

WORLD BUSINESS
The Graying of Japan Inc.
An obsolete silk factory: Investments in high technology have surged—but traditional plants are hard pressed for cash
Aging plants in basic industries are eroding the nation’s competitive edge.
When Japan’s government-owned Me-
chanical Engineering Laboratory opened its
new $56 million gearbox factory near Tokyo
earlier this year, it seemed the embodi-
ment of the country’s economic miracle.
Crammed with state-of-the-art robots work-
ing round the clock, the glittery facility
promised to slash production time by half
and set a new standard for manufacturers
seeking to boost their efficiency.
Nippon Steel Corp., however, is not faring
so well. When the giant conglomerate re-
vamps its Kamaishi works next year,
the aging mill will be stripped of its
blast furnaces and turned into a
mushroom factory. The drastic sur-
gery is a desperate bid to find jobs for
employees idled by sagging demand
and the steelmaker’s inability to keep
pace with foreign competitors.
That study in contrasts under-
scores a little-known but poten-
tially dramatic development: the
graying of Japan Inc. For years, the
country has been the economic jug-
gernaut of the world. Springing from
the ruins of World War 11, its new
and stunningly efficient factories un-
dercut and overwhelmed one foreign
industry after another. But Japan’s
image of invincibility may soon be
tarnished. The country’s basic man-
ufacturing plants are aging fast—so
fast, in fact, that Japan might soon
become an industrial “old man” compared
with its most important rival, the United
States. “It may come as a surprise to West-
erners, but Japan is in fear of losing its
international competitiveness,” says To-
shiki Tomita, senior economist at Tokyo’s
Nomura Research Institute.
Numbers tell part of the story. Japan’s
Ministry of International Trade and Indus-
try recently reported that the average age of
the country’s industrial plant (8.35 years)
has risen to the point where for the first time
it exceeds that of the United States’ (8.2
CHRISTOPH BLUMRICH— Newsweek
years). And the shift is no temporary aberra-
tion, but the culmination of a long-term
trend. Since 1973 the average age of Japa-
nese plants has crept upward from 6.65
years—while the age of U.S. plants has
fallen from 9.2 years. Significantly, that
growing obsolescence is concentrated in the
very industries that powered Japan’s
postwar economic growth. The country’s
blast furnaces are on the average more than
10 years old, its polyethylene plants 15 years
and its paper mills are creaking along at 19.
The reasons for this uncharacteristic
laggardliness are many. Stiff in-
creases in Japan’s corporate taxes —
now among the highest in the
world —have dampened the hefty
investment rate that fueled the
country’s growth during the ’6os
and ’7os. In addition, rising labor
costs and intense Third World com-
petition have sapped the profits of
many low- and medium-tech indus-
tries —even as they are being forced
to spend millions of dollars to up-
grade their facilities.
That gloomy picture has alarmed
many Japanese. The Federation of
Economic Organizations, the coun-
try’s most influential business asso-
ciation, is calling for special tax
breaks to encourage investment. Ja-
pan’s 53 percent corporate tax rate
is about that of the United States,
but its allowances for depreciation,
investment credits and other incen-


tives are far less generous. As a result,
Japanese companies paid an average tax of
51.2 percent last year, compared with 32.3
percent for U.S. companies.
Fearing that they may be left behind by
their American competitors, Japanese firms
are beefing up investment. A Japan Devel-
opment Bank (JDB) survey of more than
2,000 companies found that Japanese man-
ufacturers planned to boost their capital
expenditures this year by 17 percent, after
cutting back by almost 9 percent last year.
Leading the way are the coun-
try’s electronics and machinery
industries, which are hiking
their investments by almost
half. Smokestack industries,
except for steel, are trying to
follow suit. “Industries realize
they cannot grow without in-
vesting in leading-edge tech-
nology,” says JDB economist
Hiroshi Ikeda.
Surge: Whether Japan Inc.
can rebuild quickly enough to
keep pace with the United
States is uncertain. A tax cut
would stimulate new invest-
ment, but its chances of being
approved are almost nil. The
reason: Japan’s already mam-
moth budget deficit would be-
come virtually unmanageable
if tax revenues fell. Another
problem is that the country’s
latest surge in industrial invest-
ment is concentrated in high
technology. That may help Ja-
pan to expand its research abili-
ties and commercialize new
products, but it will not help its
faltering traditional industries.
The Japanese are also con-
cerned about the growing over-
seas investments of their largest
and most profitable companies,
which siphon needed capital
out of the domestic economy.
Partly to avoid future protec-
tionist barriers, Japanese man-
ufacturing firms have pumped
more than $5 billion into the
United States alone in recent
years. The results have been
mixed. While Japanese auto-
makers, for example, have se-
cured a guaranteed share of
their most important market,
they have also contributed to
an unexpected competitive rea-
lignment of the industry. Ja-
pan’s technology and joint ven-
ture investments have helped
U.S. automakers modernize
their own plants—and last
year, for the first time, Ameri-
can auto plants were newer on
average than their vaunted
Japanese rivals.
Japanese executives clearly fear that they
will be overtaken by the United States in
other industries, with potentially dire re-
sults for the country’s economy. Japan still
devotes a larger share of its gross national
product to new investments than does the
United States, but the gap is closing fast.
With an economy only a third the size of
America’s, the country’s executives are
afraid of being steamrollered by a resurgent
United States. If Japan does not act soon to
refurbish its aging industry, that concern
could be well founded.

The Saudis Go Big
For Brazilian Arms
The Saudia jet touched down to a recep-
tion fit for a king. A red carpet stretched
across the tarmac at Brasilia’s military air
base, while a line of limousines waited to
whisk the robed dignitaries to the posh Al-
vorado Palace in the heart of the capital.
There, at a lavish reception, Brazil’s Presi-
dent Joao Baptista Figueiredo and Saudi
Defense Minister Prince Sultan traded gifts:
a silver cigarette case for the visitor and a
Saudi-made machine gun for his host.
The prince’s gift could hardly have been
more fitting. His visit was less a diplomatic
summit than a highly specialized sales
meeting. Prince Sultan was in Brazil in part
on a simple weapons-buying spree. But
when he left five days later, he had also
signed a precedent-shattering cooperation
agreement. Brazil, the developing world’s
largest arms exporter, signaled its interest in
selling the Saudis advanced weapons and
possibly providing them with weapons-pro-
duction facilities inside Saudi Arabia that
could be worth more than $1 billion to
Brazil —money that would go far in wiping
out its trade deficit with the Arab nation.
Toe to Toe: The accord marks a coming-
of-age for Brazil’s defense industry. Riding
a surge in weapons production that began in
the 19605, Brazil now competes toe to toe
with the major military powers. It is now
earning up to $1 billion a year in sales to 35
countries, producing everything from com-
bat boots and ammunition to technological-
ly advanced tanks, radar and missiles. In
recent years Brazil has sold hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of rocket launch-
ers and armored vehicles to Iraq. And with
the Saudi deal, Brasilia seems to be cement-
ing a long-term position in the arms-hungry
Middle East. “The visit of the Saudi prince,
one of the world’s leading arms clients, is
proof of our industrial maturity,” says
Paulo Tarso, Brazil’s under secretary gen-
eral for economic and commercial affairs.
“We have been put into the spotlight.”
The Saudi shopping list reportedly
includes the AMX subsonic jet fighter, now
being jointly developed with Italy, as well as
a Brazilian-designed ship-to-ship missile
system that could be used with devastating
effect in the narrow Gulf. Other purchases
reportedly being negotiated include several
high-speed patrol boats as well as amphibi-
ous vehicles. The attraction of these and
other Brazilian weapons is not only their
availability and sophistication but their reli-
ability and comparative simplicity. “Brazil-
ian products are efficient and simple to
operate,” says Roberto Bernardini de Cury,
head of a prominent Brazilian armaments
company. “They have found an enormous
receptivity in the Third World.”
An equal attraction may be political.
Aside from Cuba, South Africa and the
countries of Central America, Brazil’s qua-

From Inner to Outer Vision.
Every artist knows the problems of giving
birth to an inner vision.
Now, suppose there existed a paint
brush that actually told the painter : “too
much blue” or “more white”. Would he be
helped?
Or suppose there was a typewriter that
told the writer that his syntax was off.
Would he really be helped?
Hardly.
Then why should a photographer be hel-
ped by a camera that tells him, what to do?
Yet many cameras today do just that.
They are small wonders of creative engi-
neering. But what do they do to creative
photography?
At Hasselblad we regard photography
as an Art.
That is why the sophisticated technology
of the Hasselblad camera is designed to
support rather than replace the creativity of
the photographer.
A fact that makes it the choice of astro-
nauts in space as well as most of the leading
photographers here on earth.
Since Art and Quality are relatives, the
Hasselblad is built mainly by hand. It actu-
ally spends a full year in the factory before
graduating.
After all it takes a good education to
become a skilled midwife for the delivery
of visions.

si-public arms manufacturers will sell to
virtually any foreign government, with few
strings attached. For Saudi Arabia, that
means none of the diplomatic wrangling
that has hobbled its purchase of AW ACS
from the United States, the kingdom’s tra-
ditional supplier. In addition, Brazil does
not require buyers to present “end user”
certificates —leaving the new owners free to
transfer or resell Brazilian weapons to other
countries, no questions asked. That flexibil-
ity is especially vital to Saudi Arabia, which
for years has provided arms for Egypt, Jor-
dan and Iraq, and major backing for the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
New: The arms-production accord signed
last month could even further enhance
Riyadh’s arms maneuverability. Saudi Ara-
bia already makes its own automatic rifles
and small-caliber ammunition but has so far
failed to secure U.S. or European help in
making more advanced weapons. Under the
new accord, say Brazilian officials, it is like-
ly that the Saudis will jointly manufacture
Brazil’s state-of-the-art Astros II mobile
rocket system, the Osorio heavy tank and
the Tucano turboprop cargo plane. Brazil
may also train Saudi workers to assemble
and manufacture the weapons and give the
kingdom a full share of the technologies
involved.
For all its own success in the arms busi-
ness, Brazil itself spends less than 3 percent
of its gross national product on defense.
Ninety percent of its arms production is
sold overseas —and that unfettered export
policy has begun to raise eyebrows. Wash-
ington has pressed the Figueiredo govern-
ment to reduce its sales to Libya, which
reportedly transfers many of its weapons to
Iran. And even many Brazilians were dis-
tressed by the sale earlier this year of eight
Tucano military training planes to Hondu-
ras, an apparent violation of Brazil’s pledge
to honor the Contadora accord banning
weapons sales to conflict-ridden Central
America.
Debt: So far, the fact that Brazilian weap-
ons may end up in the wrong hands has
apparently not bothered the Figueiredo
government. “It is not our problem,” says
Paulo Tarso. “Our position is very commer-
cially oriented.” Flavio Bierrenbach, a
member of the opposition Brazil Democrat-
ic Movement, recently sponsored a bill that
would prevent Brazil from selling arms to
warring nations. “It is extremely discom-
forting,” he says, “to be supplying both
sides of the conflicts in Central America and
the Middle East.” But Bierrenbach con-
cedes that the bill has little chance of pass-
ing, even if the opposition manages to win
January’s presidential election. Strapped
with a huge foreign debt and needing dollars
to finance its development, Brazil is unlike-
ly to take any steps that would hurt a boom-
ing industry—especially when arms-hun-
gry countries like Saudi Arabia are just
beginning to buy.

OPEC’s Crude New Strategy
The atmosphere at OPEC’s emergency
meeting last week in Geneva was
tense —and the talk was tough and testy.
For 2Vi days oil ministers from the cartel’s
13 member-nations fought among them-
selves as they tried to halt a slide in oil prices
triggered by recent price cuts by Nigeria
and such non-OPEC producers as Britain
and Norway. In the end, they finally agreed
on a compromise strategy: OPEC would
“temporarily” cut its daily production ceil-
ing of 17.5 million barrels by 1.5 million
barrels a day. “We are now in a position to
fight back and put the price up where we
want it to be,” pledged Sheik Ahmad Zaki
Yamani, the oil minister for Saudi Arabia.
Surprisingly, OPEC might be able to
make good on that promise. Even though
Yamani (right) with Nigerian oil minister Tam David-West: A plan to prop up prices
worldwide demand for oil has been weak in
recent weeks, the coming winter heating
season should help to reverse that trend.
The cold weather may have an added
impact, say industry analysts, because com-
mercial inventories of crude oil in the Unit-
ed States and Europe are lower than normal
for this time of year. As a result, forecasters
at the Department of Energy say OPEC
must supply 18.4 million barrels a day dur-
ing the remainder of this quarter and slight-
ly more than that for the first quarter of
1985 to meet the world’s oil needs. “The
market will go up as soon as everyone real-
izes that they are serious and that crude isn’t
available,” says Philip Verleger Jr., a senior
energy adviser to Charles River Associates,
a consulting firm.
Spot Market: The job ahead for OPEC
may not be as tough as it has been in the past.
All of its members —except Nigeria and
Iraq—have agreed to immediate produc-
tion cuts of about 8.5 percent each. That
task probably won’t be too hard for most of
them in the short term; many industry ex-
perts believe that OPEC producers have
already begun pumping substantially less
oil than was allowed under the old quotas.
And it’s clear that OPEC’s largest produc-
er, Saudi Arabia, retains ample flexibility in
setting its oil production targets, despite the
fact that weak prices and lower sales have
caused it to run a severe budget deficit this
year. In fact, the cartel’s new strategy al-
ready seems to be working. Since the cuts
were announced, the price of Arabian
Light, the OPEC “benchmark” crude,
inched up in the spot market.
Pricing Problems: But if prices begin to
rise substantially, the continued success of
OPEC’s strategy will depend on its ability to
hold down production levels. Keeping some
members honest might not be easy. “There
were all kinds of games played in the past,”
says John Lichtblau, president of the Petro-
leum Industry Foundation. Some produc-
ers, for example, had been circumventing
OPEC’s price and production restrictions
by bartering oil at bargain prices for jet
airplanes or weapons. Others, such as se-
verely cash-strapped Nigeria, simply flout-
ed the cartel’s rules and slashed prices in
order to sell more oil.
Potentially more troublesome, though, is
OPEC’s failure to remedy a more serious
problem: price differentials between light
and heavy oil. The official OPEC price for
Arabian Light crude is currently about $3
higher than for heavy oil, which is now in
greater demand. Analysts say that the only
solution is to adjust the differentials to re-
flect market realities—a change OPEC
leaders are determined to make at their
regular December meeting. If they do not,
OPEC probably will be back in the hot seat
once the spring thaw comes.

MEDICINE
A Breakthrough Transplant?
The anonymous child in a ‘warmer ’ crib at Loma Linda University Medical Center: A new record for life with an animal heart
A baboon heart keeps Baby Fae alive —but the surgery stirs a medical controversy.
The brown-haired, blue-eyed baby girl
squirmed, yawned and sucked greed-
ily on her bottle last week, much like any
other newborn. She was not, however, just
any infant: she was the famed “Baby Fae,”
and she was causing a vast stir merely by
being alive. Animal-rights advocates pick-

eted her hospital, the Loma
Linda University Medical
Center, carrying signs that
read “Stop the Torture”
and “Ghoulish Tinkering
Is Not Science.” The cen-
ter’s switchboard ignited
with outraged telephone
calls —and administrators
sent beefy security guards,
some with attack dogs, to
protect the nursery and pa-
trol the grounds. Even
members of the medical-re-
search establishment broke
ranks to level strong criti-
cism at the doctors who
were tending to the child.
Baby Fae owed her survival to a young
baboon whose heart was beating away in
her tiny chest. And, however controversial
her operation or clouded her prognosis,
one fact was undebatable: Baby Fae had
already made history as the only person to
live for more than a week with an animal-
heart transplant.
The life that became so celebrated began
sadly on Oct. 12, when she was born three
weeks prematurely in a hospital in Bar-
stow, Calif. It was clear at once that some-
thing was wrong, and doctors at nearby
Loma Linda confirmed that she had a
congenital heart defect that was almost
always fatal. Faced with this prospect,
her mother and father took
the baby to a motel. “They
did not want this inevita-
ble thing, death, to hap-
pen in their home,” said a
hospital spokesman later.
Then, when Baby Fae be-
gan gasping for breath, her
parents rushed her back to
Loma Linda. And there,
Dr. Leonard L. Bailey,
chief of pediatric heart
surgery, who had been
experimenting with heart
transplants between sheep
and goats for seven years,
offered them the desperate
chance to save the infant’s
life with a transplant from
a baboon. They agreed, in-
sisting on anonymity, and
the operation was performed in the early
morning of Oct. 26.
Only a handful of animal-to-human heart
transplants had ever been performed, and
all had been failures. Twenty years ago, Dr.
James Hardy of the University of Mississip-
pi School of Medicine implanted the heart
of a chimpanzee into a 68-year-old man,
who died in an hour and a half. And in 1977,

Since the first electronic brain began
"thinking” almost four decades ago, Hitachi
has been steadily advancing the art of
machine memories. From paper tape and
punch cards. To magnetic tape and memory
drums. To the very latest optical technologies
for high-density information storage.
Technology that never forgets
Today, the results of Hitachi research are in
use all around you. Floppy disks that can hold
hundreds of pages’ worth of text for ready
reference via business or personal com-

allow industrial robots to memorize dozens of
job routines. Semiconductor memory devices
for data processing, satellite communica-
tions systems, office automation equipment,
and even home audio/video components.
In fact, we are constantly coming up
with innovations and new applications.
Quite recently: A mirror-like optical disk no
larger than an LP record, which permits
inscription of pictures and sounds as well as
computer-encoded text and numbers
for laser scanning of any bit of information
in just a quarter of a second.
The best of worlds is yet to come
Our vision of the future includes whole librar-

even smaller than a standard textbook.
Visual memory banks that allow designers to
create new works of art from stored images.
Automotive microcomputers that recall
routes, driving conditions and destination
data. And much, much more.
We'd like you to share in the benefits
of our scientific research, covering the next
generation of microchips, sensors and other

of Cape Town implanted a baboon heart
“piggyback” next to the diseased heart of a
25-year-old Italian woman. She died after
five hours. Later that year, Barnard placed a
chimp’s heart in a 59-year-old man in a
similar operation. He lived 3Vi days.
Given that discouraging record, some
physicians were quick to criticize the
Loma Linda team for trying another pri-
mate-to-human match. “It doesn’t seem
likely that, at this stage of our knowledge,
we are ready to embark on cross-species
transplantation,” said Dr. John S. Najar-
ian of the University of Minnesota Hospi-
tals, one of the country’s leading organ-
transplant specialists. “Everything we
know indicates that this heart is going to
fail.” The objections of some researchers
took a more personal tack: they noted that
Bailey had never done a heart transplant in
humans before, that he had not published
results of his cross-species transplant ex-
periments in the leading medical journals
and that he had no federal funding. Others
questioned why Bailey hadn’t looked for a
human-heart donor before resorting to a
baboon. Some also expressed doubts about
the wisdom of operating on someone so
young; in London three months ago, sur-
geons did implant a human heart in a nine-
day-old girl, but she died 19 days later. “I
find myself worrying about the way things
were handled —the timing, informed con-
sent, the publicity,” said Arthur Caplan, a
medical-ethics expert from the Hastings
Center in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Be-
yond the expert questions, the Loma Linda
team also faced some uneasiness among
the public about whether such “alien”
transplants were proper, and fair to ani-
mals —or humans.
Temple of God’: To many, Loma Linda
also seemed a rather obscure place for such
a daring advance. Founded in 1906 as the
College of Medical Evangelists and located
60 miles east of Los Angeles, the school
specializes in training Seventh-day Advent-
ists as medical missionaries. A tenet of the
faith is the sanctity of the human body as a
“temple of God.” Health, therefore, is a

religious ideal —Adventists shun smoking
and eating meat. While most of the staff
belong to the denomination, the 546-bed
hospital serves patients from all over
the area and has a solid reputation for medi-
cal care and research. Indeed, one of the
classic studies showing the link between
smoking and lung cancer was carried out at
Loma Linda.
Bailey, 41, graduated from Loma Linda
and put in a year of surgical training at
Toronto’s top-flight Hospital for Sick Chil-
dren. He became interested in cross-species
heart transplants a decade ago and devel-
oped techniques in experiments on sheep
and goats, honing his skills on same-species
work and doing transplants between the
two. Over the past seven years, he per-
formed 150 such procedures.
The main reason Bailey has concentrated
on “xenografts”—as transplants between
distantly related species are called (box) —
is that donor organs for
infants are in even short-
er supply than they are
for adults. Bailey admits
that most of his surgical
peers have been skeptical
about his unusual goal.
“People didn’t understand
why I thought this was
important,” he said. “They
weren’t watching the ba-
bies die that I was.” Dr.
Jack Provonsha, director of
Loma Linda’s Center for
Christian Bioethics, also de-
fends his colleague’s record:
“Bailey has tried to get a
hearing. He has tried to get
published, but the proce-
dure was so novel that pres-
tigious journals would not
print his articles.” Actually, Bailey has pub-
lished at least 30 articles on various aspects
of pediatric heart surgery, but apparently
none on xenografts.
He was encouraged to pursue xenografts
because of recent successes with cyclospor-
ine, a drug that has virtually revolutionized
the entire transplant field in the last few
years. Conventional drugs used to prevent
rejection suppress the entire immune sys-
tem, including the cells that make anti-
bodies. That leaves the patient highly vul-
nerable to infection. Cyclosporine, on the
other hand, tends to attack only the so-called
“T helper” cells that are involved in tissue
rejection, leaving protective white blood
cells alone.
Meeting: Baby Fae had been born with
hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a condi-
tion that afflicts 1 in 10,000 babies. The left
ventricle, or main pumping chamber of her
heart, had failed to develop; she also had
defective heart valves and a dangerously
underdeveloped aorta, the main artery from
the heart to the rest of the body. When her
parents brought her back to Loma Linda,
Bailey was attending a medical meeting in
San Francisco. As a stopgap until his re-
turn, doctors gave the child a substance
called prostaglandin to keep open the duc-
tus arteriosus, the tiny blood vessel between
the pulmonary artery and the aorta that
permits blood to flow around the heart
during fetal life when the mother’s lungs
and circulation are supplying the oxygen
the baby needs. Normally, the ductus closes
and atrophies shortly after birth when the
baby starts breathing on its own. Keeping
the ductus open allowed Baby Fae to re-
main alive —with a mechanical respirator
supplying the oxygen as though she were
still in the womb.
When Bailey got back to the hospital at


midnight on Oct. 19, he told the parents
about the possibility of the baboon trans-
plant. And he also pointed out that a
“palliative” procedure, called the Nor-
wood operation, could be tried instead.
Developed by Dr. William Norwood of the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the
operation involves creating a tube between
the pulmonary artery and the aorta to
serve in much the same way as a ductus
arteriosus. This tides the child over for a
year and a half, when a second operation is
performed; surgeons make a direct connec-
tion between the lungs and the aorta and
create an extra chamber in the right side of
the heart. The Norwood procedure is no
easy undertaking, and few surgeons have
had much experience with it. For Nor-
wood, the mortality rate is 25 to 33 per-
cent, but for others it is at least 50 percent.
Bailey, in fact, had tried it once, but the
infant died. Given these odds, Baby Fae’s
parents chose the transplant. They signed a
detailed consent form on Oct. 22 and re-
peated the signing 24 hours later.
Bailey and his colleagues then began
tissue-typing on six baboons that had been
shipped from the Southwest Foundation
for Biomedical Research in San Antonio.
They finally chose a 10-month-old female
East African “olive” baboon weighing IV2
pounds. The baboon’s heart, about the size
of a walnut, is structurally the same as a
normal baby’s, except that two, rather
than three, arteries lead from the aortic
arch to the neck and head. The actual
transplant took five hours, and was com-
plicated only by the difficulty Bailey had
suturing a heart and connecting blood
vessels that were so small. “When the
baboon’s heart started beating in Baby
Fae, there was absolute awe,” recalls San-
dra Nehlsen-Cannarella, an immunologist
from New York’s Montefiore Medical
Center who was present.
Testimony: As required by the federal
government, Bailey had to obtain approval
from Loma Linda’s Institutional Review
Board (IRB) before taking his research
Crossing the Barrier
Transplanting a baboon’s heart into a baby girl is only
the latest and most dramatic example of putting an animal’s
organs to work for man. For the better part of a century be-
fore Baby Fae made medical history, surgeons have tried to cross
the species barrier. Their success rate has not exactly been
overwhelming, but they have found ample evidence that
the barrier is not unbreachable.
Surgeons already tap animals for
medical procedures—especially for
spare parts. “Catgut” (actually sheep
intestine) is used for surgical sutures.
Pigskin can serve as a temporary graft
on burn victims. Cow tendons and
bones are frequently used to replace
those damaged in accidents. Human
hearts have also benefited from ani-
mal implants. Patches cut from a
cow’s pericardium sac, the mem-
brane surrounding the heart, are
used to repair human heart valves.
Pig heart valves, purchased from
slaughterhouses, are preferred over
synthetic ones in aortic valve surgery
for older patients. They’ve been in-
stalled in an estimated 100,000 pa-
tients since 1970.
Kidneys: Full transspecies organ
transplants are still a rarity, to be
sure. Transplants fall into three cate-
gories: homografts, between the same
species; heterografts, between such
closely related species as the dog and
the wolf, and xenografts, between
species that are distantly related.
Baby Fae received a xenograft. Such
operations pose the greatest threat of
rejection, but surgeons have periodically turned to xenografts in
the course of research. About half a dozen terminal patients
received kidneys from a pig, goat, lamb or nonhuman primate in
the early part of this century, before human donor transplants
had been developed. Those organs never functioned, however,
and surgeons abandoned the effort. Interest quickened in the
1960 s when two surgeons began more sophisticated study of
kidney transplants from animals to humans. Dr. Keith
Reemtsma, then at Tulane University, transplanted chimpanzee
kidneys into six patients and Dr. Thomas Starzl, then at the
University of Colorado, placed baboon kidneys in six others.
Baboon colony: Potentially compatible
OAKES—SOUTHWEST FOUNDATION
Although all 12 transplants eventually ceased to function, they
were “surprisingly long-lasting,” says Starzl, now at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The baboon kidneys functioned up to two
months; one chimp kidney worked for nine months until the
patient died of infection.
Immune: Both Starzl and Reemtsma, now at New York’s
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, abandoned animal-to-
human efforts. But they, and a handful of other scientists,
continued to investigate transplants between animals of differ-
ent species in an effort to understand immunological resistance.
In general, the experiments showed
that compatibility is determined by
blood grouping, cellular reactions
and tissue typing. The better all three
match, the greater the chance that an
organ transplanted from one will be
accepted by the other. By such crite-
ria, the pygmy chimp is regarded as
man’s closest relative, followed by
other great apes (chimps, gorillas and
orangutans). Baboons are not apes
but monkeys and therefore less close-
ly related to humans.
Their evolutionary status, howev-
er, doesn’t necessarily make baboons
a poor match for humans. The species
share similar organ architecture and
several blood types —A, B and AB.
Reflecting this, baboons have on rare
occasion acted as human stand-ins.
In 1968 Dr. Joseph Fortner of Memo-
rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
in New York connected the circula-
tory system of a 21-year-old woman
dying of liver cancer to that of a ba-
boon. For eight hours the woman’s
blood passed through the baboon’s
liver, allowing her diseased organ to
detoxify and regenerate. The unusual
procedure prolonged the woman’s life by seven weeks.
Besides being medically useful, baboons are also plentiful.
While many great apes are endangered, baboons from Africa
and southern Arabia are so übiquitous that in many areas they’re
classed as pests. Moreover, baboons now are being raised for
research in the United States. In San Antonio, the Southwest
Foundation for Biomedical Research has a colony of 2,500.
About 200 animals a year are shipped from there to some 25
scientific facilities. The heart of one such baboon was transplant-
ed to Baby Fae.

“Begin at the bottom and
learn everything you can every
step of the way”
That’s the credo of Allen
Paulson, majority owner and
operator of the largest cor-
porate aircraft manufacturing
company in the world.
His spectacular rise in the
aerospace business can be
matched only by the exquisite
aeroplanes he makes and sells.
Starting at 18 as a mechanic
for TWA, he’s worked as a
flight engineer, a test pilot, a
commercial pilot and, even
today, he’s still flying.
And flying high. “Behind
the controls, 40,000 feet in
the air, you can get back to
basics’,’ he says.
Remembering the basics is
probably what’s behind Gulf-
stream’s continual success.
A lot of it, he puts down
to single-mindedness about
corporate aircraft. Decisions
are made swiftly. Actions take
days, not weeks.
And yet there is a calm and
studied precision which he
applies to his forward plan-
ning. And Allen Paulson is one
of the world’s great planners.
You can’t build a plane like the
Gulfstream HI any other way.
As with any well-built ma-
chine, the process is long, the
timing precise and the result
—a masterpiece.

Cheering for Baby Fae: Supporters of the daring transplant demonstrated as well
LEVON PARIAN— SYGMA
from the lab to the operating room. He
applied to the 23-member committee in
August of last year. On Oct. 24, after Baby
Fae entered the hospital, the board gave
final approval, specifying that Bailey must
operate only on newborns because their
immune systems were presumed to be less
mature than those of adults and, therefore,
less likely to reject an organ. They said
Bailey could do five such baboon trans-
plants. The board had been persuaded in
their decision by testimony from Nehlsen-
Cannarella that the tissues of one baboon
and this particular newborn were “strong-
ly compatible.”
Too Large: As it turned out, Baby Fae
might have received a human heart, if
Bailey’s team had sought one. The Califor-
nia Regional Organ Procurement Agency
in Los Angeles had learned of a two-
month-old baby who had died suddenly
and whose organs were available. By
this time, however, the baboon transplant
was already under way,
Loma Linda spokesmen
said. Moreover, they noted
that the heart might have
been too large for the tiny
infant. And, in any case,
Loma Linda’s IRB has
never approved a human-
heart transplant program.
When news of the opera-
tion broke, it provoked
headlines around the world.
The ethics, and the pro-
priety, of the procedure
were debated on U.S. tel-
evision from the “CBS
Morning News” to ABC’s
“Nightline.” Several ma-
jor newspapers weighed in
with cautious endorse-
ments. “Medicine’s goal is
to reduce suffering and pre-

serve life,” said an editorial in the Los
Angeles Times. “Baby Fae is on the fron-
tier of that quest.” To many, that seemed
an appropriate sentiment. But Michael
Fox of the Humane Society’s national of-
fice in Washington questioned whether it
was proper to put “the burden for our
suffering and that of our loved ones on the
animal kingdom.” On the other hand, Le-
Roy Walters, director of the Center for
Bioethics at Georgetown University’s
Kennedy Institute of Ethics, observed that
the risks and benefits to the patient must be
weighed. “It is regretful that an animal has
to be killed to allow a human a chance to
live,” he said. “But in a showdown, it is
appropriate to come down on the side of
saying ‘let the human live’.”
Too little: Even as Baby Fae improved
during her first postoperative week, many
transplant experts remained cautious. Min-
nesota’s Najarian and Dr. Randall E. Mor-
ris of Stanford questioned the assumption
that a baby is less likely to
reject an organ. “The major-
ity of the immune system
has developed by the time of
birth,” says Morris. Dr.
Marvin Garovoy of the
transplant team at the Uni-
versity of California, San
Francisco, said no one
knows how well—or poor-
ly—an infant might react to
cyclosporine. Even in
adults, he explains, the dos-
age range is very limited: too
little leads to rejection, too
much causes kidney dam-
age. Some scientists argue
that the “remarkable” post-
operative progress Baby Fae
seems to have made may be
misleading; a rejection cri-
sis, if it comes, wouldn’t be
expected until this week at the earliest.
Yet others were enthusiastic about the
operation, especially those who had worked
in the same area. “I don’t think they did
anything irresponsible,” said Dr. Thomas
E. Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, who tried baboon-to-
human kidney transplants in the 1960 s and
is now the leading liver-transplant surgeon.
“The question is, can these improvements in
immunosuppressive drugs allow an exten-
sion of survival [of xenografts].” “We’re
watching medical history every day that
child lives,” said Dr. James Hardy, who
performed the first primate-heart trans-
plant. “I don’t think people outside the
transplant field can appreciate what this will
do for research.” Even some “outsiders”
were cautiously approving. “If the child
sails through, we’ll say they are heroes,”
said Dr. Aldo Castaneda, a surgeon at Chil-
dren’s Hospital Medical Center in Boston
who uses his own variation of the Norwood
procedure on infants like Baby Fae. “It
sometimes takes a daring surgeon to make
progress.” Implicit in the remark is the hope
that xenografts one day will substitute for
other organs, such as the kidney, and help
relieve the present acute problem of finding
human donors.
Soul: What does the future hold for Baby
Fae? Conceivably, she may require an-
other transplant if the baboon version fails
to keep pace with her own growth. “The
heart responds to loads by expanding and
thickening its muscle,” notes Dr. David B.
Hinshaw of Loma Linda; the hearts of
runners, for instance, often expand might-
ily with the demands of exercise. Hinshaw
scoffs at the notion that the child will be
any different from others if she grows up
with an animal heart. “The heart is a
pump, not the seat of the personality or the
soul,” he says. “I would envision she
would be a normal little girl.”
As of late last week, Baby Fae was be-
having as normally as any infant, under
the circumstances. In between intravenous
doses of glucose, cyclosporine and the ster-
oid prednisone in her nursery “warmer”
crib, she downed bottles of enriched infant
formula. She had lost about half a pound
from her birth weight of five pounds—due
to the expected loss of excess fluids —and
she complained lustily whenever she
seemed to think she was not getting
enough to eat. But whenever her mother
lifted Baby Fae out of her warmer and
rocked her, the squalls changed to gurgling
contentment. The mother was wearing a
sterile mask, gloves and gown, and the
infant was the historic recipient of recent
medical advances. The picture they made
together, however, was quite as old, and as
normal, as birth itself.

A Beautiful Vision of Hell
Khmer Rouge capturing Waterston: A gripping, disturbing canvas of war-torn Cambodia
Imagine a country where an estimated 3
million people—out of a population of 7
million —have either been massacred or
have died of starvation or disease. An
extraordinary movie called The Killing
Fields is about such a place—war-torn,
famine-plagued, murderous Cambodia,
where in 1975 the Khmer Rouge toppled
the government and began a relentless
reign of terror. New York Times corre-
spondent Sydney Schanberg was in Phnom
Penh when the government fell, working
alongside his Cambodian guide, trans-
lator and friend, Dith Pran, who saved his
life. Schanberg fled Cambodia soon after,
but he was unable to get his friend out of
the country. Pran had to survive by his
wits in the “killing fields” until, more
than four years later, he escaped across the
Thai border.
The story of these two men, which
Schanberg chronicled in a 1980 New York
Times Magazine feature, inspired produc-
er David Puttnam to make the film. The
screenplay, by Bruce Robinson, closely fol-
lows the personal relationship between the
abrasive, dedicated Schanberg (Sam Wa-
terston) and his loyal, resourceful col-
league (Dr. Haing S. Ngor, himself a Cam-
bodian refugee). It’s a moving story. But
it’s not, curiously, the sure-fire tale it
should have been: indeed, the narrative
thread often gets lost. This would have
been a crippling flaw in most movies, but
not here. For the tragedy of the Cambodi-
an civil war is greater than the individual
story in the foreground. “The Killing
Fields” paints a canvas of ravaged Cambo-
dia so compelling and convincing you can’t
tear your eyes from the screen.
In his film debut, Roland Joffe, a British
stage and TV director, has made a movie in
which the parts are ultimately greater than
the whole—but there’s real greatness in
those parts. It’s there in his tour de force
staging of the evacuation of the American
Embassy. It’s there in the heart-stopping
sequence in which Schanberg and his
Western colleagues take refuge in the
French Embassy and make a desperate
attempt to save Pran from the Khmer
Rouge by forging an English passport for
him. Some of these glimpses of chaos in
war may be too spectacular, for they tend
to overwhelm the personalities at the cen-
ter of the drama. After the intensity of
these war scenes, the story of Pran’s soli-
tary struggle for survival, though riveting,
almost seems anticlimactic.
Waterston and Ngor are joined by an
excellent supporting cast that includes
John Malkovich as a pot-smoking photog-
rapher, Julian Sands as a British journalist
and Craig T. Nelson as a military attache.
Yet this is not an actors’ film. Joffe and his
brilliant cinematographer, Chris Menges,
have conjured up a frightening but weirdly
beautiful vision of hell that helps us to
understand not only the horror of the
recent past but the addictive attraction
that war can have. In one ambiguous,
disturbing scene, Schanberg, safe at home
in New York, puts a ravishing Puccini aria
on his stereo while watching videotapes of
Cambodian atrocities. While he’s wallow-
ing in splendid masochism, Pran is stealing
lizards to eat in a land where brainwashed
teen-age soldiers kill their countrymen
without thought or remorse. “The Killing
Fields” is full of such harrowing conjunc-
tions. It’s not to be missed.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Accessory Software: Electronic Helpmate
The personal computer has become
such a familiar fixture in so many
homes and offices that users have started
thinking of their machines as electronic
substitutes for their desk tops. This idea
has spawned a new category of programs
called “accessory software.” Accessory
programs allow users to gain access to
such office aids as personal telephone
directories, calculators and index-card
files with the tap of a key. Instead of
cluttering one’s desk, these accessories
appear on the computer screen in “pop-
Display on the Xerox Star work station, ‘Get Organized!’
accessories: A low-cost twist on the electronic desk top
up windows” and can be quickly tucked
away after they are used.
This desk-top approach to computing
began some time ago. During the 19705,
employees at Xerox Corp.’s Palo Alto,
Calif., research center came up with
many of the ideas that are incorporated
into accessory software, including win-
dows and multitasking—the principle of
having several jobs available on the
screen at the same time. The Xerox Star
work station has made a sophisticated
electronic desk top available since 1981.
But such a hardware-software combina-
tion can cost as much as $lO,OOO. Acces-
sory software is a low-cost alternative for
those who do not need the power and
versatility of such a work station.
One of the least-expensive accessory
programs is called Sidekick ($5O). Bor-
land International of Scotts Valley,
Calif., has designed the program to use
only 40 kilobytes of computer memo-
ry—less than one-fifth of the memory
capacity of a typical IBM-type comput-
er. Like most accessory programs, the
software stays out of the way while an-
other program is being used. When Side-
kick is needed, a stroke of a key freezes
whatever is on the screen and displays a
“menu” over it. From the menu, a user
can call up a calculator, an appointment
calendar, a note pad, a phone directory
or an automatic dialer.
Like other programs, Sidekick’s ac-
cessories closely resemble their non-
computer counterparts. Sidekick’s dial-
er, for example, lists numbers in much
the same way as a standard telephone
directory. But a search function in the
computer allows the user to find one
number among hundreds. Sidekick is
available throughout the United States,
Europe, Japan and Australia.
Spotlight ($150), manufactured by
Software Arts of Wellesley, Mass., does
not offer an automatic dialer. But the
software offers a more flexible calendar,
A busy executive can easily customize
his appointment calendar to display
his workday schedule in one-hour, half-
hour or 15-minute segments. Once a
user lists his appointments for the
day, the program automatically draws
lines on the calendar to represent the
duration of each meeting. Spotlight is
available throughout the United States
and Europe.
Two other programs take the accesso-
ry idea one step further—at times, per-
haps, to the user’s detriment. The Desk
Organizer, by Warner Software Inc. of
New York, N.Y. ($195), needs up to
128 K of computer memory. Unlike oth-
er accessory programs, the windows in
The Desk Organizer occupy the entire
screen and cannot be made to overlap to
save space. Perhaps to compensate for
that inflexibility, the program offers a
sophisticated text editor, much like a
word-processing program. It also has
two calculators (one can generate corn-
plex formulas) and can “stamp” docu-
ments with information such as the date
and the time.
Get Organized! ($200), by Electronic
Arts of San Mateo, Calif., cannot techni-
cally be called accessory software, since
it does not supplement any other pro-
gram. GO! includes a full-fledged word
processor, a phone directory and dialer,
an appointment calendar, a note pad and
an index-card file. The program makes
extensive use of color. Each accessory
window appears in a different hue, ad-
justable by the user, from bright red to
lavender. Get Organized! is available
throughout the United States, Canada,
Europe and Australia.
As useful as it seems, accessory soft-
ware may have a limited life span. Firms
are already introducing programs that
will give the advantages of multitasking
and windows to nearly any IBM-type
computer running standard software.
Top View ($150), by IBM Corp.’s Entry
Systems Division of Boca Raton, allows
users simultaneously to display windows
showing several standard programs,
such as a word processor. If such systems
are successful, computer users may be
able to create an electronic desk top using
software they already own.

Picking a diamond in the rough
takes a special kind of skill.
Great ideas are like diamonds. In the
beginning, they’re hard to distinguish
from the ordinary. However, with the
right kind of skill, what seems ordinary
can be fashioned into a brilliant reality.
At Epson, we know how to select the
kind of ideas that will produce products
that people can trust. We approach
every idea from the very beginning.
We carefully evaluate its worth, and
before proceeding any further, we
examine its applicability. If we find any
flaws, any imperfections, we stop.
Most corporations can dream up
ingenious product concepts. But what
makes Epson different from everyone
else is that we create products for
people. Almost every single feature
on an Epson product is designed to
make your life easier. You’ll never
spend weeks trying to figure out how an
Epson product works. And you’ll never
find unnecessary gimmicks either.
Epson’s commitment to fulfill human
needs is apparent in such outstanding
products as our liquid crystal display,
and the world’s best-selling printers for
personal computers and totally portable
cordless personal computers.
Epson. We know the difference
between great ideas, and great ideas
that work.

FACT TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver 'super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the motoring writers
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
times.
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
"Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity* but all of mouth-
watering configuration." The Advertiser.
"The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning." The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological
fact after fact.
SR engines
feature fuel
efficiency in-
novations, ad-
vanced elec-
tronics, new
mechanisms,
and sophisti-
cated engine
analysis tech-
niques.
K
Special laser holography of the engine block
to huge weight cuts. New materials cut
friction and reduced inertia. With design innova-
tions such as pent roof combustion chambers and
SHUT
rn; P
mi 9
swirl control
valves.
In fact,
Toyota has devel-
oped several
world firsts in the
process. A hollow
camshaft, and
sinter-forged
connecting rods.
The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement.
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It’s a fact!
Oh what a feeling!

What a difference
a viewpoint makes
READERS of Woman's Day
are being asked to spot the
difference between the photo-
graphs, (right) in a contest
that can win them anything
from a tracksuit to a fashion
wardrobe. The trouble is that
there is not one difference but
several, as the quickest of
glances reveals.
To get around the diffi-
culty, the organisers are
asking readers to spot the
“single significant difference.”
But that depends on the
meaning of the word “signifi-
cant.”
To one interested in win-
ning a contest sponsored by
Coca-Cola, the significant
difference might be that the
model is holding the TAB can
upside-down in the right-hand
picture.
But, to a dentist, it might
be the toothy smile in the left-
hand photo. A meteorologist
might consider it to be the
movement of the clouds
whereas a jeweller could be
fascinated by the changed
angle of the bracelet on the
girl’s wrist.
To a printer, it might be the
difference in flesh tones. To a
hairdresser, it might be the
way the wind has caught the
model’s hair. To a romantic, it
might be the way in which the
couple in the background are
looking at each other in the
right-hand picture.
To an unreconstructed
sexist, the main difference
would be the greater length of
thigh visible on the right.

WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT THIS LITTLE EXERCISE
Sydney City Express, October 24
Doonesbury
gets zonked
QUITE A FEW American
newspapers have abruptly
dropped the much-syndicated
cartoonist Garry Trudeau
whose strip Doonesbury por-
trays trendy life, especially
political life, in the United
States. The papers object to an
increasingly anti-Republican
tone the strip has evinced
since Trudeau resumed it in
the run-up to the election.
The final straw was a strip
published last week which ad-
verted to Vice-President
George Bush and his “man-
hood.”
The Florida St Petersburg
Times, which normally sup-
ports the Democratic side,
axed Doonesbury immediate-
ly. “We wouldn’t allow a re-
porter to write a story with
this kind of double meaning,
so I don’t see why we should
allow a cartoonist to,” said
editor Mike Foley.

What about
Lady Chatterley?
THE CLASS system is still
alive and well, in Britain, with
one law for the rulers and an-
other for the workers.
In the Sussex village of
Singleton, a gamekeeper who
had four live-in lovers over
five years was dismissed be-
cause the landed earl who em-
ployed him said his lifestyle
had “brought the hunt into
disrepute.”
The gamekeeper and his
latest mistress were thrown
out of his cottage and a tri-
bunal which heard his appeal
said that the “earl had no
choice in the matter” but to
take action to preserve stan-
dards.
In the same week, Cecil
Parkinson who was dropped
from the Thatcher cabinet be-
cause he fathered a child with
his secretary was appointed to
the board of three major Brit-
ish companies Sears Hold-
ings, Tarmac and Babcock In-
ternational.


Getting ‘the
mail’ on US
top secrets
PSSST! Like to buy a top
secret?
The United States navy has
for years been operating a sat-
ellite maritime observation
system, designed to track
Soviet surface ships and sub-
marines, so secret that even its
codename Whitecloud
was banned from open tele-
phone lines.
However (according to
Aviation Week and Space
Technology), the cafeteria in
the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration’s
Johnson Space Centre in
Texas is selling for $1 each
souvenir postal covers that
provide “accurate details and
drawings of “Whitecloud.”
These show that the master
satellite dispenses “sub-satel-
lites” which monitor electron-
ic and other emissions and re-
lay these back to the navy.
To rub in the disclosure,
the covers are postmarked at
Vandenburg Air Force Base
in California launching site
for secret US space probes.
Presumably, by now, some
have been posted to Moscow.
Perhaps Australia, curious
about the exact functions of
US facilities such as Pine Gap
and Narrungar should check
cafeterias at NASA centres
for “wish you were there”
postcards that tell all.
Dry humor
from hospital
The London Sunday Times
had a nice scoop with its re-
cent expose of the link be-
tween Colonel Gaddafi of
Libya and the United King-
dom miners’ union. The news-
paper was even more pleased,
however, to receive a phone
call from Industry minister
Norman Tebbit who was in
hospital recovering from in-
juries suffered in the Brighton
Tory convention bombing.
“It’s the most cheering thing
that’s happened since I was
laid up,” said arch-dry Tebbit.
Ironies of the Filipino press
President Marcos with Imelda: an unlikely defender of freedom
PRESIDENT Ferdinand
Marcos’ attack last week on
western media for “persistent-
ly” focusing attention on the
troubles besetting the Philip-
pines is nothing new but it
does highlight a problem
which has vexed his govern-
ment since the imposition of
martial law in 1972: how to
deal with the local and foreign
press.
The dilemma is perhaps
best illustrated by the case of
Michael Richardson.
Richardson has covered
the Philippines for The Age of
Melbourne (and latterly for
The Sydney Morning Herald )
for the past 10 years or more.
When he first started writing
about Marcos and First Lady
Imelda, few Australians knew
who they were. Or cared.
The slow development of
an awareness in Australia of
the Philippines is partly due to
Richardson.
The Australian media’s
overall perception of the
Philippines being what it is
today of a troubled nation
under a dictatorship some
sectors of the Filipino govern-
ment felt that Richardson had
much to answer for. And so,
last year, he was told to leave
the country for “consistently
unfair and sensational report-
ing.” But, within 24 hours of
his editors’ receiving the
ouster notice from Manila
(Richardson, in any case, was
in his regular base: Singa-
pore), Marcos himself had
overturned the decision
saying that he wanted to show
the western press that his gov-
ernment did not practise cen-
sorship.
Insofar as western journal-
ists are concerned Marcos was
telling the truth. Ironic as it
may seem, it is a fact that the
Philippines is the easiest of all
the countries to Australia’s
near north to cover and its
leaders the most accessible. It
also may be the most ma-
ligned.. All this is due largely
to an English-speaking pop-
ulation, a predominantly
English-language media and
the Filipinos’ innate penchant
for political gossip.
But another factor is the
government’s puzzling atti-
tude toward western report-
ing.
Whereas Indonesia (for
example) would not hesitate
to kick out a journalist for
what it thought was lack of
objectivity, the beleaguered
Marcos would.
The government’s attitude
toward the Filipino press is
even more ambivalent.
While military censors
hovered over editors in the
early days of martial law,
these watchdogs very soon
disappeared from the prem-
ises. The media which have
been allowed to operate since
1972 have on the whole been
relatively free from direct in-
terference by the military or
even the information minis-
try. (This is not to say, that in-
dividual editors and reporters
do not fear for their jobs
should an item prove particu-
larly embarrassing to the
presidential palace.)
The consequence is that
the western media are quite at
liberty to say whatever they
want to about the Philippines
whereas the local press is not
by its own expedient
choice.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
THE MOST rewarding experience
in Backgammon (outside winning
a major tournament) probably is
to pull off a victory from a back-
game position. Your opponent
has streaked ahead to an extent
where your prospects of winning a
“race” are zero. Taking the bit be-
tween your teeth, you have left
blots open purposely and con-
trived to have men hit and sent
back to your opponent’s home
board so that you can attack from
the rear.
The danger now is that you
will hit too soon.
Consider the illustration:
White has a great back game in
progress, his positioning is superb
and he stands a good chance of
victory. He rolls a 6-4. What is the
play?
To hit the blot on the 8 point
from the 2 point at this moment
would be a disaster. To do so,
White would have to relinquish
his hold on Black’s 2 point when
not strong enough to do so.
White holds Black’s 2 and 3
points the best ones to have in a
back game. The strategy in a back
game is twofold: You consolidate
your home board, then you hit
making it difficult for your oppo-
nent to escape.
As the game illustrated stands,
Black would have little trouble in
re-entering from the bar if hit
now. Furthermore, he would at-
tack his own 2 point and White
probably would lose a double
game.
White should stay put on
Black’s 2 and 3 points and use the
6-4 to capture White’s own 4
point. He is almost certain to get
another shot; when he does, his
home board should be impreg-
nable and he could double Black
out of the game.

MOST PLAYERS tend to be lazy
about counting to 13 and, as a re-
sult, miss much of the satisfaction
that comes from counting out a
hand.
Some of the “guesses” in
bridge are not guesses at all if one
pays attention to the fundamen-
tals of the game. Everyone knows
that each player is dealt 13 cards
and each suit has 13 cards but not
everyone takes advantage of these
facts.
Here is an instructive case
where South is in four spades and
should go down one. However,
there is a good chance he will
make the contract if East is not on
his toes.
West leads a diamond, East
winning the jack with the queen
and continuing with the ace.
Declarer ruffs and plays the A-K
of spades, hoping for a 2-2 div-
ision. West shows out on the sec-
ond trump and it seems that
declarer must go down one.
But South sees a ray of hope
and plays accordingly. He leads
the A-K and another heart, sad-
dling East with the lead. East
cashes the queen of trumps and is
faced with the problem of what to
play next. He realises that if he re-
turns a heart or a diamond South
will get a ruff and discard.
If East succumbs to this fear by
returning a club, South makes the
contract with proper play. He sal-
vages his club loser.
But if East is alert to the situa-
tion he recognises that South
who is known to have started with
five spades, three hearts and one
diamond must have four clubs
and that a ruff-discard cannot
help. So East returns a heart or a
diamond and South later loses a
club trick to go down one.
